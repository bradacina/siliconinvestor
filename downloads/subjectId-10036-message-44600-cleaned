why would investors sell the stock down to less than 100k when they know
Buffett would buy back shares? I think theres enough buffett fanatics out there
to jump on the shares as soon as it falls below 100k, setting it as a floor.

you obviously are wanting to limit your downside --- and that's smart.

<u>My concern is that if, for whatever reason, the earnings revert to 2009 or
worse levels, the stock could revert back to the 0.50 range.</u>

ok... so how is that different from any other stock? Ford went from $18.00 into
the $9.00 range in 8 months. that's what stocks do.... and they dont have to be
penny stocks to do it.

<u> If I continue to wait long enough, maybe they will build up a low long-term
PE :)</u>

if you wait long enuf you will know everything you want to know --- cuz hind

just put it on your watch list and buy it if/when you feel the price is right.

every 10 to 100+ bagger i have ever owned was a penny stock. just sayin'.

Hi MCsweet -

Armanino Foods of Distinction Inc. (AMNF.PK)

<u>Wb Site:</u> http://www.armaninofoods.com/Food_Service.aspx

The key with this one is to structure your buys at a price that's in your
comfort zone and keep your overall position w/i your portfolio diversification
allocation. For me I have built my position to a 1% portfolio position w/ three
different buys since 10/2010 at $0.64/share, $0.71/share and $0.86/share.

AMNF is not a typical penny stock and with some research you will see why they
have structured the company to keep their stock price below $1.00/share. It has
to do with certain type of SEC reporting requirements and filings that make it
arduous and costly for a small company. That said, as the company grows (they
are now expanding their distribution through out the U.S.), builds out their
product lines (a new "pesto lite" product introduced in late 2011) and grow
their revenues, it's just a matter of time before they will either (1) be
acquired or (2) expand their operation through merger or organic growth to a
$100M company (Current Market Cap is $26M).

Also, most of the monthly Pink Sheet share volume (w/i next 12 months) should
come through ATM (At The Market) buys from the company through their announced
stock repurchase program. This should help stabilize the pink sheet stock
price. There are times you can buy shares with a "low ball" GTC Bid order when
a seller wants out and there are no buyers. The spread change can be as much as
10% of the price or about $0.07/share. Make sure you use "limit" buy orders and
"limit" sell orders on this one.

This is a long term hold for me and I earn 6% while I wait. As long as the
company grows their business and does not try to expand too fast (w/o using
debt), I will continue to hold. They are on track to earn $0.075/share this
year and $0.09/share next year (my guess - reflects 3M share buy back
2011-2012).

<u>The company is growing their sales by 20% per year and had their YOY annual
earnings increase by 16%</u>. They are maintaining (and even expanding) their
margins w/ more efficient facility processing even as they expand their
distribution network nationwide. As the company shows they can maintain this
growth over the next 24-36 months, I expect the stock to be priced at a 12 PE.
<u>This should price the stock at $1.10/share in 2012 which would still be a
value considering their 20% growth rate.</u>

I also like this "food" sector as it is in the value added food chain where
they deliver excellent value to their customers while maintaining their "High
End" quality (healthy & organic). In 2011-2012 the company is introducing a new
"lite Basil Pesto" line with 50% less Fat and 25% less sodium. This product is
targeted to the health care market which is a new niche market segment that one
of their Food Service distributors sell through.

That's my take. It's not a screaming Value Buy but one that should be a good
grower and over looked because it is only sold in the Pink Sheets.

re BRK.b - I don't think that buybacks do much to limit the downside. Based on
current excess cash levels (~17B$), BRK.B cannot buy back much more than 10% of
their shares, which is significant but once you look at it - a lof of stocks
have cratered while they were buying back 10% of their shares or even more. An
I doubt that he is going to buy back 10% after all, for one thing he will not
buy back shares just to keep the stock price up - he will only buy if the stock
is low enough to meet his discount to NAV hurdle.

FWIW, the buyback is less of a valuation call but more so a call that he cannot
generate more value buying other stocks. This is different than in the past
where he always thought that he could generate more value, reinvesting BRK
funds than just buying back stocks. Also note that it was Ajit that was making
the offer for TRH (traditionally that was WEB job to handle acquisitions) and
that he has now two money manager working for him. These are all indications
that WEB get's ready for retirement, which is doubt his followers consider a
bullish indication.

I like BRK.B but I am thinking it's more fully valued than other stocks. it's
quite possible to build a portfolio with BRK type quality stocks, probably at a
lower valuation than BRK itself.

>>Unless you are saying that Buffett is growing senile and cannot spot good

Her maybe able to spot them but he cannot exploit them any more due to BRK
size. BRK size reduces the the universe of stock investments to multi B$
companies. That is one reason why he prefers to buy entire companies, but that
downside of that is that he needs to buy them at a premium to market value. The
BNSF deal looks OK and even great especially when comparing to holding cash,
the Lubrizol deal just looks OK.

What he has not done but should have, imo is to court foreign companies as well
as buying foreign stocks to expand his investment universe. He has done some of
this (BYD, Tesco, Guinness, ISCAR Petrochina ) but not enough to move the
needle substantially. I believe many of us have an edge due to being more
nimble and having a larger universe of investment opportunities (small/medium

You are somewhat right, but I wish it was so simple. BASFY is 58B company,
HENKY is 18B, even MGDDY is 4B, so if Buffett doesn't buy them there is an
implication that he thinks BRK to be cheaper / more attractive than these
companies. OK, so you say these are international companies, but the same
argument can be made about US companies: CMI 18B, CAT 50B, NEU 2B, ETN 13B etc.
All of these were discussed on this thread and most of them might be
"Buffett-attractive" from a glance. So once again it should concern us that
Buffett does not consider these companies to be better investments than buying

Bunge Limited (BG)

I missed the most recent BUY point at $55.00/share but you and Paul were able
to pick up some very cheap shares. Here is an excellent report that Dennis Roth
posted on the Farming Board.

https://ir.citi.com/Tp84NsZbKFkQiqcyqWt5IhON0agNewB1uqONyjd%2FQP4%3D

I found this comment of interest:

"...Devaluation of the Brazilian Real Represents a Significant Catalyst for
Bunge Shares..."

The Brazilian Real has undergone a significant devaluation over the past month,
and at current rates would represent a 10% devaluation in 2012 relative to
2011. This is beneficial to Bunge’s Brazilian operations, given that the firm
has approximately $600 million in local Brazilian costs which are exposed to
changes in the Brazilian Real. We note that due to Bunge’s position as an
agricultural exporter out of Brazil, the majority of Bunge’s sales are
transacted in U.S. dollars, meaning that movements in the Real have no
meaningful impact on Bunge’s revenues. However the firm’s cost structure is
affected, as Bunge’s local Brazilian production costs (ie labor, energy etc)
are exposed to movements in the Real. Consequently, in an environment where the
Real is devaluing, Bunge’s local Brazilian costs decline without any offsetting
effects from the revenue line, causing profitability to increase. <u>Net, we
estimate that every 1% move in the Brazilian Real inversely impacts Bunge’s EPS
by 4c/share, and as such see a 40c benefit to Bunge’s 2012E EPS given the 10%
devaluation in the Brazilian Real implied for 2012 at current spot rates. </u>

<u>Further, Bunge has another $700 million of costs spread across Argentina,
Western Europe, and Eastern Europe, that we estimate add an additional 10c of
EPS upside because of FX rate movements for 2012. This brings the total FX
impact to 50c, of which 40c is captured in our new 2012 estimates...</u>."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------
They have an $88.00/share target value for 2012.

From their report:"...Our $88 target price utilizes a 12.5x-13.0x multiple
range on our 2012 EPS estimate
of $7.00, predicated on our belief that while Bunge's earnings are likely to
continue
growing due to the tight global grain environment, which should benefit Bunge’s
grain merchandising operations...."

I need to pull the trigger on more shares any time this one moves below
$60.00/share. My cost on shares I already own are pretty high at $72.40/share
so I have my work cut out to get my avg cost down by 2012 when BG should be
reporting good earnings.

Your 9/22/2011 Buys seemed to be right on. I picked up VALE, FWLT and GLW but
missed probably the most important one, BG.

Hi J Mako -

Re: Corning Inc. (GLW)

Good review on GLW. I have a pretty large position I acquired in May 2002 in
the $5.00/share range. I have been following the company for years and have
watched how they get a product to market from their R&D group and then into
their global sales channel. Specifically, they did this with their ceramic
catalyst diesel filters. These were introduced in Europe a few years back and
recently have been introduced to the U.S.. Countries that utilize both the
small and large diesel engines are now using this filter. It's a huge growth
product especially in CHINA.

Corning Announces Expansion of Clean Air Products Facility in China
Additional Capacity Will Address Increased Global Demand 

http://www.corning.com/news_center/news_releases/2011/2011072101.aspx

From the article:"...Corning Incorporated (NYSE: GLW) today announced that its
board of directors has approved a capital expenditure plan of approximately
$170 million to further increase the capacity of its clean air products plant
in Shanghai, China.

The investment will be used to expand the Corning Shanghai Company Limited
(CSCL) facility and to increase its capacity to manufacture emissions control
substrates for light-duty (automotive) passenger vehicles. This expansion is
expected to be complete and operational in the third quarter of 2013...."

I believe their <u>Environmental Technologies Division </u>is going to provide
the big growth kicker for GLW in the coming years. The profits from this
division could surpass those now generated from their LCD group. In any case,
this is a division that never seems to get mentioned when discussing GLW.

They estimate by 2016 there will be over 100 million vehicles (up 40% from
2011) that will install these new ceramic diesel filters .(required for new &
retrofit diesels). Their new Kaiserslautern Diesel Manufacturing Facility in
Germany is already producing at plant capacity for their European customers
(http://international.to/index.php?option=com_cboxnews&n=7808&Itemid=126 ). If
you add China to the mix it's definitely going to be a big boos to GLW's 2013
earnings.

I have been selling shares in the $22.00/share range and had an eventual price
target of $29.00/share before the 2008 crash. With their new China facility to
be completed in 2013, I expect their ceramic filters to fly off the shelfs. The
profit margins on these filters are quite good too.

Did you factor in the FCF from this Division (Environmental Technologies) into
your analysis?

Lazarus,

Earning on large caps are usually not as volatile as earnings on microcap
stocks. And prices are not as volatile either, and you aren't stock in a roach
motel if things go south. Also, if you can buy at a stock at or near book or at
a discount, then the book value gives you some margin of safety. There is no
such book value margin of safety in Armanino.

Ford and other cyclical stocks have volatile earnings. I usually don't invest
in such stocks either. I may consider them if I can get a good margin of safety
on book value with ok prospects for long-term earnings, but I won't back up the
truck..

I have made a lot of money in microcap stocks over the years, but with several
painful stingers as well. There are usually enough opportunities that I think
it is a mistake to stretch. That being said, if I like the fundamentals enough
I may take a starter position, even if I don't have a big margin of safety.

I upped my ULTR position by 30% and will give this company one last shot to get
their earnings growing again. There have been lots of excuses for earnings
misses over the last 2 quarters and now is the time to start posting their
gains. Here is their most recent report filed today.

http://xml.10kwizard.com/filing_raw.php?repo=tenk&ipage=7831330

With today's buy, I have got my cost basis down to a level where I can make a
good gain if Ultra's offshore business and Barge Division can get traction.
Lots of capital has been invested in upgrading their new offshore fleet and
completing a barge port facility. Soybeans from the early 2011 harvest season
have been stored for lack of water in the river and eventually need to get to
the sea port. I expect their 3rd and 4th Qtr River business to show some good
gains.

Hopefully during the next 12-24 months I will be peeling off shares for a gain
rather than booking losses and buying back shares.

re BG, real - the devaluation of the real would help many export oriented
companies with business in Brazil. Since they incur cost in real but sell in
US$ the high real impacts profit margins.

The other company impacted even more is Vale. i believe a lower real would do
wonders to Vale's profit margin, since almost all their product (iron ore and
other materials) goes into export.

I have been somewhat reluctant with repect to BG because they have sometimes
high earnings volatility, but then I really see a company that is retooling
itself after the sale of their fertilizer business, trades below tangible book
and probably far below replacement value of their assets and at a fairly low
PE. Furthermore it helps to produce and move a product that never goes out of
fashion and where demand is very likely to rise, worldwide.

This kind of makes it easy to buy BG versus a bank stock that may trade at
discount to tangible book as well, but has some crappy assets and a crappy loan
demand to deal with and trades with an equal or higher PE.

Thanks EKS for bringing this up. I haven't given GLW's Environment Division
much thought.

What's your impression of GLW's culture? Can we compare it to, say, Nestle
which preserved years of hardship to establish the Nespresso brand in the
market?

Back to its Environment Division. To me, both its Gorilla Glass and Environment
products have huge growth potential. But I don't know enough to quantify them.
Their contribution to both GLW's top line and bottom line are not material.
(Total 2010 revenue attributable to GLW is $12B. Revenue from the Environment
Division is 860M and net margin is 5%. Margin should improve when going forward
though. And IIRC, revenue from Gorilla Glass is projected at 1B this year.) If
these 2 growth stories play out well, they are icing on the cake. To some
extent, I tend to focus on my downside than the upside in analyzing stocks.

Btw, do you know why GLW stick with their low margin telecom business?

p.s. I placed an order at $12.50 today when I knew I could get the stocks at
$12.55. It never touched that level. Didn't Fisher say don't quibble over small

For those playing volatility, keep an eye on the trading range that we've been
stuck in since Aug. Wide swings, but we haven't gone anywhere. We are nearing
the top of that range now.

From a value perspective, stocks are trading at historically cheap PEs. I think
that the reason is that investors are worried about how substainable earnings
are in a difficult economic time.

Again from a value perspective, do you ignore the substainability and buy based
on past performance or consider the future in finding value? That's my
question, but heres a great article from Seeking Alpha on the historic

Yeah, great interview.

Macro themes he mentions are pretty common among people who mention bearish
arguments, like Seth Klarman's interview that was posted here recently and Ray
Dalio and so on:
- Negative feedback loop risk
- Deleveraging, austerity, less spending, more saving = drop in economy
- China bubble
- Companies expensive on Schiller P/E

I think that the delevering/austerity problem is the biggest real issue right
now. The negative feedback loop might happen, but it's not happening yet (no,
the current wobbly and 10% declines are not negative feedback loop ;)). China
may or may not burst - it's tough to say. Schiller P/E will work itself out if
we don't have second leg down.
Unfortunately, delevering may lead to negative feedback loop and bad Schiller
P/Es going forward. So there is a significant risk and perhaps I should hold
more cash. I am not sure I want to hedge the catastrophic declines as Prem does
- I don't think I am good at it.

But overall, I don't have answers to these and I don't think anyone does.
Buffett is the most optimistic of the crew with Klarman and Prem being possibly
in the middle and Dalio most bearish.

Going on to his investments, they are somewhat hohum and controversial. I held
RIMM and sold at a loss. You were right about it and I was wrong - it will be
very tough for RIMM to recover. I own some DELL and perhaps I should buy more
as HPQ is willywagging around. IRE might be a good call option on Ireland. As I
said during my travel through Dublin, the feeling is that Ireland can recover
better than Greece and other So Euro countries, since they do have
manufacturing, high tech, agri, exports, etc. But with IRE as with Berkowitz's
BAC there are huge risks that may also lead to significant loss.

(OT. When people talk about something being an option play, I always imagine
holding 80%-90% cash and buying the option with 10% capital. So if it goes up
10x, you get 2x return, but if it goes down to 0, you get 10% loss.
Unfortunately, usually people buy "option" positions with full capital and
then... shit blows up. I am not sure I'd have discipline to buy IRE at 10% of
regular position and hold the rest in cash though ;)).

Disclosure: I have a large position in Fairfax and may increase it if the stock
drops below book.

lodgings industry. PKF Hospitality Research recently revised its 2011 forecast
for domestic revenue growth for the industry, saying that “it’s tough not to be

We are talking about a manic depressive market that can be taken advantage off.

But seriously, trading around a part of your portfolio in a manic depressive
bear market can seriously improve performance. It may not be a value strategy

Here are the contracts awarded to Foster Wheeler AG (FWLT) - September 2011

<u>Sasol Chemical Industries Ltd has awarded Foster Wheeler</u> a contract to
provide engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCm) services
for the Sasolburg Utilities Expansion Project at Sasolburg, South Africa. Due
to be completed in Q212, the project involves the expansion of the capacity of
the utility systems at the Sasol complex at Sasolburg to support a program of
expansion projects. This EPCm award follows FW’s completion of the FEED phase
for this project.

<u>Foster Wheeler, through a collaborative agreement with Honeywell’s UOP, was
recently awarded a contract</u> by Oman Refineries and Petrochemicals Co.
(Orpic). UOP/FW will provide a basic engineering design package for a solvent
deasphalting (SDA) unit at the Sohar refinery in Oman. The unit is a major part
of a project to increase the refinery’s production of petroleum products such
as LPG, naphtha, Jet A-1 fuel, gasoline, diesel and propylene. The SDA unit is
to process 2,500ktpa of vacuum residue of Oman export blend crude to produce
de-asphalted oil and asphalt for road bitumen production. The SDA unit is
expected to come on stream in 2015.

<u>OJSC Omskneftekhimproekt has awarded Foster Wheeler a contract </u>for the
basic engineering design of a new hydrogen production unit – based on Foster
Wheeler Terrace-Wall steam reforming technology – at the Atyrau Refinery,
Atyrau, Kazakhstan – part of KazMunayGas group. OJSC is the project engineering
contractor for the revamp/modernisation of the refinery. The project aims to
increase the oil conversion rate and production of all types of motor fuels to
Euro IV and Euro V standards. The refinery will, as a result of this
modernisation, require more high purity hydrogen. The new hydrogen unit, which
will use high olefinic LPG as the main feedstock and natural gas as the
alternate feedstock, is to produce 24,000 Nm3 /h of pure hydrogen. The basic
design package is due for completion during Q3/11.

<u>Foster Wheeler is to perform the second phase scope for an existing contract
</u>with Ecopetrol SA for the project for the modernisation of the refinery in
Barrancabermeja (PMRB) in Colombia. This includes additional project management
consultancy and FEED, detailed engineering for the crude unit revamps,
assisting Ecopetrol in the selection process for EPC contracts, and control and
supervision of the EPC and construction contractors. The PRMB will add heavy
crude processing capability to take advantage of the available domestic heavy
sour crudes, and provide a processing configuration to meet the Colombian clean
fuels product specifications.

<u>Foster Wheeler has selected Emerson technology to control a new biomass
boiler at the Polaniec Power Station in Poland. </u>When operational in 2012,
this will be the world’s largest 100% biomass-fired boiler. FW is building the
190 MWe biomass-fired circulating fluidised-bed (CFB) boiler island for plant
owner GDF Suez. Poland has been investing in biomass power generation to
achieve a target of producing 15% of its total energy consumption from
renewable sources by 2020.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------

Several of these construction companies are landing some nice contracts (even
in challenging economic times). Many are selling near multi year lows with a
10PE or less and still maintain a pretty good back log of orders.

"Again from a value perspective, do you ignore the substainability and buy
based on past performance or consider the future in finding value?"

In less volatile times, I presume that the stock price of a company will
reflect the consensus of what people believe the company's future to be. If the
consensus' concern about sustainability is significant enough to where the
stock price is already very low in anticipation of this (i.e. the future's
already baked into the stock price), then based on past performance, some hope
that maybe people are overly negative, and that things might improve in 1-2
years, from a value perspective I might be interested in making a buy.

a split <g>. the reason for underperformance is bad execution, mostly in the

It is my opinion that Andrea is not cutting it, and new management needs to be

It seems that Clownbuck was wrong to suggest that "this company should cease
production and convert into a royalty trust instead". Their direct sales gave
the oomph this quarter while royalties continued to decline somewhat. It is not
clear if the trends are going to continue though. I would like to see both
numbers rising, but I'll settle for a mix that is not negative.

I think that's why Graham advocates using 10 years averaged earning as proxy
for "earning in normal business environment". Another thing is, this will only
work if the company operates in stable industry with stable profit.

UVIC,

Jurgis, thank you for pointing the results.

So you liked the stock earlier and now say don't invest after the stock has
been crushed and looks kinda cheap. That's not front running. Is it sand
bagging? ;)

It looks attractive to me here. Not enough for back-up-the-truck levels (I
don't like the negative book value and I don't like the royalty income
eventually expiring), but enough for wish I owned more.

By the way, regarding Clownbuck's comment: Even last quarter they were growing
their non-royalty business while their royalty income was declining, so I
didn't see the point of his logic about ceasing production from the get go.

Hi JMako -

Heavy Duty Construction Service Companies -

Every one of the large construction companies that I follow (and several of
those listed in the awarded contract directory) carry unique project/skill
expertise. You can go to their Web sites and study their large awarded projects
and the tasks that the prime contractor does and those that are subcontracted
out.

I have focused on two unique sectors: (1) Oil & Gas infrastructure (2)
Electrical Generation & Power Infrastructure. I would say that based on their
in house expertise/skills several of the prime players are preferred
contractors which may give them an edge when bidding (this could be seen as
"selective" type of mote).

For example, CBI is considered a leader in building very large specialized
fabricated steel tanks and connectors for very large infrastructure projects
like LNG plants. They are know in the industry for their wielding expertise and
even build nuclear containment vessels.

Looking at each of the main player's web sites and reading the awarded
contracts, you begin to get a feel for the major players and the type of
contract awards they land.

Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC) is know for their project management
expertise and task scheduling. They do consulting work too that includes large
scale project design.

I am no expert but for the past few years I try to follow who's who in the
industry and who is landing the larger projects. You will see that some of the
contracts state one-of-a-kind process or sole source and then name the
contractor. There are lots of variables evaluated when awarding a large
contract and many of the companies will partner together when submitting their
bid. Also, it is not always the low bidder that wins either. It can be
political too as some countries want to award (at least part of the project) to
a local bidder.

Therefore, I monitor the PE's of several of these companies as well as their
back log of orders. The business is cyclical and a slowing word economy implies
fewer projects (not the case in LNG projects). At this point in the cycle, many
of these contractors are selling at historically low PE's (approaching single
digit)and trading near multi year lows (but not at 2009 levels). This is
signaling a possible slow down in overall business but as of yet I do not see
it in either (1) their order book or (2) awarded contract activity.

Try looking at <u>ABB Ltd Common Stock (NYSE: ABB ) </u>and you tell me if this

http://www.theengineer.co.uk/channels/process-engineering/contracts-and-project
-tracker-september-2011/1000183.article

I like that they only have 11% exposure in new orders in Europe and most of
those are in Germany. So if there is a European blowup they would not get hurt
too much. Lots of business in Asia, US and Brazil.

I am thinking of starting a position on this one in the $16.00/share area but
if things really fall apart it could fall with everything else to single
digits.

I have owned this one in 2007 (before the crash) and sold in 2008 (during the
crash) and still was able to book a positive profit. It's now priced about 35%
below what I paid in 2007. It could fall another 35% if it goes back to it's
lows of late 2008.

Does this one meet your value eye?

For the long term investor ABB looks fine. Germany will be undergoing a massive
increase in power generation capacity in 2012 and 2013 affording ABB an

BAC. $30B non-performing? I didn't know it was that much. It's a lot.

If I assume none of the loans will yield anything and that they'll all be
written down to zero, then that would be $30B on 10B shares outstanding, or
$3/per share. On a 6 dollar stock.

With tangible book value reported to be at $11 now (although with these
black-box banks, who really knows?), that write down would bring tangible to
$8, I guess. (I don't know what tangible amounts of BAC assets those loans
actually represent -- I presume $3/sh)

With stock now at ~$6 and $8 tangible bv, the stock could still be a value buy.
Especially if most people then believed the really bad times were finally
concluded with this $30B write-down. BAC also would have hefty tax-loss carry
forwards to offset any subsequent gains in earnings.

So what could be a reasonable downside to the stock? Not sure what reasonable
is, or how far down down could be. I'll just say maybe the $6 stock goes to $3
if all non-performing loans ($3/sh worth) are written off. Which might make BAC
a very good buy: $3 stock price with a tangible book value of $8.

I'm intending to add to my position as BAC stock drops. Small amounts though.

A few observations on BKI.

Sales in the U.S. are in decline while sales in Europe have been increasing. If
this trend continues and this is projected to continue, then the value of the
Euro will be more of a factor for BKI going forward.

The question about how sustainable their earnings are is built in here creating
volatility of its own in a volatile market. Sales fell in 09, were flat in 10
and rose sharply in 11. Profits have also been anything but steady but they
have turned a profit since 2006.

The reduction in debt and the new green energy plant makes them more profitable
and they have little competition for their specialty products.

Hi Sergio

ABB and the Swiss franc -

When I saw they were a Swiss company, I immediately felt that this was a
positive (because of the strength of the franc) when looking at all the
potential problems one might have with a Euro denominated currency.

However, in the long run, it's more of a factor that their European customers
make current payments on their long term contracts and are not forced to spread
out their projects over a longer period because of financial problems. In
2008-2009 "crash" we saw orders get postponed or lengthened and a few of the
larger deals were in question because of financing concerns. Banks pulled
credit lines and/or froze lines of credit for projects which essentially
stopped work on everything until bank credit was re-established. I doubt this
would happen especially for non European orders.

I suspect because of their size and global sales, they must have some sort of
local currency hedge for their bigger deals in Asia, Brazil, US and Europe. I
would not be too concerned about currency gains/losses but rather their order
book and the growth in new orders given the future outlook of economic growth.
They do have a lot of business in China which to me is a positive. They also
have a lot work in Japan because of the recent earthquake and Izanami damage to
their power grid.

The risk/reward opportunity is looking positive to me if the stock can be
picked up at a bargain price. Other than having to eat (ie food), Japan and
China need an efficient power infrastructure to maintain their economic growth.
ABB is one of only a few companies in the world that can provide the needed
services.

BAC has 37B$ in reserves that are not included in equity or book value that
would cover a 100% loss of the nonperforming assets and have 7b$ leftover.
Those NPA are not the problem, the problem are the unquantifiable potential
losses due to bad mortgages written from tel:2005-2008 ,mostly from
Countrywide.

I don't own this right now (licking some wounds) as I am on. Wash sale timeout,

re: ABB and CBI

I read about CBI in Barron's. I took a cursory look of both of their
financials. Both look worth further investigation. Thanks for the lead!

CBI doesn't carry any inventories while ABB does. Interestingly, ABB has higher

One thing that caught my eyes is ABB's cash conversion cycle is trending up
over the years. Something needs to keep an eye on. It carries more inventories
and has less outstanding trade payables than it was 5-10 years ago.

Btw, I thought the prices of LNG and shale gas are correlated with oil price?

They are not just a large project construction company but they also sell
electrical components, controls. In that business they compete with a company
like Eaton. This is a smaller item business and carries higher margins but also
more inventory because it's manufactured rather than build to order.

UVIC,

Fido has this annoying habit of marking OTC positions (especially UVIC) to
low-ball bids if there are no trades for a given day. This screws up my daily

I have complained several times. Fidelity said it will be fixed in Q4, but

ABB several years ago paid Kvhi to create a Fiber Optic Gyro that senses which
way electricity flows with in a wire.

It would replace a much larger transformer and has a much smaller foot print.

Patents like these I'm sure give ABB a higher margin .
They are prepared to build a much more technology leading edge smart grid - if
/ when feasible.

My neighbors son works for CBI and was assigned the task of doing an analysis
of the fesibility of fo buying ABB.

At the time it was deemed too expensive.

Is this compared to it's peers or just by overall historical levels?

Based on my 2008 purchase, the company is selling at a lower PE now with a
larger order book. I have not compared their relative margins from then and now
but I suspect they may be lower as a result of their recent acquisition of
<u>Baldor Electric Company</u> ( Jan 2011:

Hi Robert -

Re: ABB Ltd. (ABB) - Smart Grid Technology

Researching this company, I was surprised to see recent acquisitions into
network management and "smart grid" software technologies. These types of
"Services" (ie software license fees, re-occurring network IT management,
network design & consulting) typically generate excellent FCF and is a high
margin business.

"...Power and automation technology group ABB has made another investment in
data center power infrastructure technology by purchasing a controlling
interest in Validus DC Systems, a U.S.-based company that provides direct
current (DC) power equipment for energy-draining data centers.

DC power offers a lot of advantages for data centers, which can consume up to
100 times more electricity than an office building of similar size. The
technology is much more energy efficient than traditional AC for electrical
distribution: It can bump energy efficiency by 10 to 20% compared to AC systems
by cutting power conversion losses....".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------

It looks like the company plans to marry many of the efficiencies in DC motors
and DC Power conversion with "Smart Grid" distributed systems. Direct
applications are found in energy intensive Data Centers and other industrial
applications.

Their recent investments total several Billion of dollars so it appears that
management is driven to develop this emerging market opportunity.

I think that is correct.

They funded Kvhi's research years ago and Kvhi made the FOG based device.

Since ABB has the patent it never came into volume production as I tyhink the
cost was too high.

When originally discussed it was a product that would become in demand when
smart grid technology was enabled through what appeared to be a lot of
legislative changes.

Just a nonte from the past - but I do believe ABB has a lead in the smart grid.

RE: BAC & non performing loans

It looks like those loans that were/are modified have a 20% of going sour
again. How does the bank quantify (ie value) a non performing asset when
setting amounts in reserve. Is the value based on a percentage of the
"original" appraised value? Remember those appraisals are 40%-50% over stated
if marked to market.

I think their actual "loss" number is higher, perhaps $10B more than they have
set aside in reserves. Add that to all the potential loans that could be "Put"
back to the bank from Fannie & Freddie.

On the positive, a possible entry point for a value purchase is getting close.
BAC does have an incredible franchise "if it is not broken up". The FCF they
generate is huge especially with these new monthly debit card fees announced
today. If the stocks breaks into the $5's, I may begin to nibble. It's the
surprise dilution announcement that is the big land mine to avoid. Also, their
Merrill Lynch Broker Unit is worth a lot especially if it is spun off. There is
always the possibility that their Countrywide subsidiary could go into
bankruptcy to avoid all the potential liability from the fraudulent loans sold
to Fannie and Freddie. That would be another $3-$5 Billion write down for
shareholders to absorb.

Hi EKS.

A few notes on LLY:

LLY has spent more than its competitors on R & D and has an impressive lineup
of candidates pending FDA approval with over 30 in late stage development. In
comparison to small caps with one or a few candidates in the pipeline, bleeding
cash and selling for value of potential market, you're getting that for free
with LLY. No analyses that I have seen places any value on the pipeline.

Additionally as revenue from new drugs kicks in, the percentage for R & D as an
expense can be offset. LLY management has a great history of maintaining a good
balance sheet and this is reflected in LLY's low volatility in stock price as
well as earnings history.

Only one drug is coming off patent this year, unfortunatly it is their number
one seller, but drugs going off patent do not fall off the face of the earth.
Genstar, for example is still a money maker for LLY although is has gone off
patent a few years ago.

Hi Dennis.

HPQ may be a good entry point around now in normal markets, but it isn't
difficult to find bargains these days. All said though, HPQ at these multiples
does indicate that all in a rush to get out have exited. There's a reasonable
dividend and the co. may decide to spin off or as you said sell a division.

Looking at how HPQ stacks up against its two top competitors, its a bargain on
p/s. IBM and HPQ have been rallying strongly of late.

There's a nice short position building on HPQ, probably due to the shareholder
unrest, but this could give the price some rocket booster propulsion on any

Mr. Buffett is a "deep value" investor? His stock buys and acquisitions may be
of value stocks, but deep value? WFC, VRSK, MA, DG? Which leads me to ask
myself, isn't it very, very rare that a midcap or large cap stock can ever
become a "deep value" unless it's part of a market meltdown?

Mr. Buffett reads 5-8 years of annual reports? Do you have a source for that?
It doesn't seem to me he did that when he's made a couple of fast acquisitions.
I suspect he approved LZ acquisition without reading 5-8 years of past annual
reports.

What is the benefit of reading past annual reports? In my opinion, it is
reading the Chairman's letter, and comparing to past letters. Did he/she do
what they say they were going to do in the previous letter? Were the problems
encountered during a particular year explained and resolved in the next year?
Can the person write a letter that clearly summarizes what the state of the
company is? Is the bs level kept low? For me, the only part of annual reports I
keep, of the annual reports I do keep, are the management(Chairman's) letter.
Otherwise, for me, everything else historical I'm interested in can usually be

Rainmaker,

Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike. A value investor
thinks of buying the business, not the stock certificates, as if he were buying
a private firm. When you buy a private firm, you want to know its history. It's
a bit like marrying a woman. When you are dating her, you are also in the
process of discovering her history.

<Mr. Buffett reads 5-8 years of annual reports? Do you have a source for that?
It doesn't seem to me he did that when he's made a couple of fast
acquisitions.>

It's said Buffett analyses a company and/or an industry and file it away for
many years before buying it when the price has come down.

Another thing is, I'm not sure if Rainmaker is referring to reading 5-10 years
of financial statements as opposed to annual reports.

<What is the benefit of reading past annual reports? In my opinion, it is

The loan loss reserves are supposed to cover the expected losses from NPA
assets and those assets that are still performing but are expected to be
impaired. If you assume that no new performing assets go into the NPA bucket
(not too ridiculous of an assumption in an improving economy because some NPA
cure themselves) than in the worst case assuming a recovery rate of zero, loan
loss reserves of the same magnitude then NPA always cover the expected losses
(recovery rates will be far better than zero).

They have special reserves build up for putbacks that I believe do not count
towards loan loss reserves (I am not totally sure about that though) and those
very likely will not cover all the putbacks. This is the big question mark when
betting on BAC - on the one hand the nominal sums are huge, on the other hand
every month, loans are expiring or aged enough even if they do go bad, the
probably cannot be put back any more. My assumption is that the putbacks have
started to fall off for all years but 2007 and 2008 has already sharply reduced
nominal volume, so they may get over the hump. But I admit, I could be wrong by
a large enough margin that it could render that opinion worthless.

SO either make a bet because the risk reward is favorable or buy something else
like C or JPM which does not have a putback issue of BAC magnitude. That's all
I can honestly say about this.

Thank you for the explanation on how reserve losses are calculated. In BAC's
case, the numbers are so big that it is hard for me to quantify the risk/reward
opportunity. Berkowitz has bet so much on this one and is already down 50%.

I do see both your and Berkowitz's argument on the huge cash flow this
franchise generates. This will continue for month's and years. If they decide
to spin off Countrywide in a BK and dump all the garbage into that entity, BAC
will take off. I am not too sure if that was the plan all along but it would be
a brilliant move if they could pull it off.

It turns out that my MBNA credit card is owned by BAC. They earn a little on
every one of those transactions too.

I will continue to watch but have no plans to nibble on any of these bank
stocks (at least not yet).

FWIW, I did buy a few more shares of MHR today and looking to close out my FRD
