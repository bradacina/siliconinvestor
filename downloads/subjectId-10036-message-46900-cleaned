DCP is expensive and any growth that they have is by acquiring new assets....

Not to mention..... That alot of these mid stream players have a ton of excess
firm transportation that could potentially roll off the books on their pipes.
Even the most highly constrained pipes like Gulf South (DCP has assets in
similar geographic region) are not at capacity anymore. Its not just about
natural gas prices, its about someone paying a toll to ship on their pipes and
everyone that ships has to much capacity that they can not wait to get rid

< scary charts:> have to agree with you there. Difficult to evaluate highly
bullish stock performance, but I'm not smart enough to sell COR either. From a
rah,rah standpoint, using a smaller box size for noise (.30) than standard, I
could make a case that the stock did backfill to 21.30, holding above the
previous low of 21.00 and broke through a double top of 22.20. Stock has
recently held about the lower channel trend line and broke above the upper line
yesterday.

Make of it what you will, that is the bullish argument (ha) . Short interest
has been increasing of late.
Don't know how much of a value stock it is now, but it obviously in a good

>"Still holding on to a 25% position on COR and a 75% in DLR."

FYI. I just checked. I am holding similar, but opposite. I still own a 75%
position in COR and 20% in DLR. I sold quite a bit in 2012 however (I used to
have super sized position in COR). So far this year, I sold 80% of my DLR and
almost half of my COR. I will keep the rest for awhile. No complaints. I always
tell myself, "if unsure what to do, do half."

No matter how much we kid ourselves, the stocks are a bit overvalued. No one
can say how much. They have PEs of 15-16 this year, while some reits have half
that (AHT, HPT, BDN...) And others, like LXP, STAG, GOV and MPW are around
10-11. Many factors justify their higher PEs. Growth rate for one. And COR has
almost zero debt. Plus very low risk of losing tenants. So it is prob good to
keep some in the portfolio for diversification in case the economy crashes, and
good to keep while momentum and market attention is going their way. But hard
to justify on a rational basis. COR is almost at your 3% yield trigger anyway.
I see insider selling for DLR; none for COR.

Hi Paul -

Not quite sure what the best way to determine the "value" for these MLP's. You
can not use PE or dividend yield. Clownbuck suggests that EV/EBITDA is a good
measure but compared to what? I am holding these MLP's mainly for their
distributions so their ability to generate cash flows are important to me.

For example, CMCSA (Comcast) is a non MLP and is known for their huge cash
floows they generate. If you compare the MLP's cash flows to CMCSA, they are
not that good. CMCSA has a relatively high PE at 19 and their dividend is not
that good at 2.2% but they generate $4.61 cash flow per share. EV.EBITA for
CMCSA is 6.27.

According to my StreetSmartEdge Research profile for DPM, their cash flow per
share is $4.06 only 62% of what CMCSA generates when adjusted on an equivalent
share price basis. The positives are that EPS growth at 85% is very good and
the 5.5% dividend yield is much better than CMCSA and above my 4% criteria.

So, for me it comes down to where these MLP pipeline and gathering systems are
located, what their capacity is and if there are long term growth prospects in
the regions they service. Since the supply of both Oil & NG continues to be
increased from all the new drilling in the U.S. domestic shale, many if not all
of these MLP's should see continued sustained growth IMO. Probably better
sustained growth than COMCAST expects to get through new subscribers. So for
me, it's the growth story that makes me continue to hold.

Perhaps the only long term negative I can see is if the tax law preferential
treatment for MLP's change. This could impact their profitability.

However, at some point these MLP's are expensive. Would it be if the Market
price divided by the Cash Flow/share exceeds 10 AND the dividend distribution
is less than 5%. For DPM it is 11.3 and 5.5% yield (but remember 85% EPS
growth). So maybe it's on the border of being over valued even for me.

Barron’s: Do you seriously believe Japanese corporations are going to fail?

Hendry: Clearly, they can and do go bust. I’m buying the CDS on
investment-grade Japanese corporations because of the overpricing anomaly.
Japan had a bust 20 years ago, and yet today the banking stocks, relative to
[Japanese bourse] Topix, are making fresh lows.

If I’m a Japanese bank and I lend money to a new business, I get 1% on 10-year
paper. Then the bank gets a call from me, and I’m willing to pay 50 basis
points for five-year protection on this same company. So suddenly, the yield
has gone from 1% to 1&#189;%. Compare that to five-year Japanese government
bonds, yielding 30 basis points. The bank thinks: This is a great trade!
Japanese steel companies are investment-grade and won’t go bankrupt. So, the
bank gets this huge yen yield, and thinks it is not taking any risk. You’d
better believe it will sell way too much of that good thing.

One of my partners told me about Japanese steel: Here is a country with no
energy, no iron ore or coal, yet it’s the largest exporter of steel in the
world, exports half its output. To put that in context, China manufactures 700
million tons of steel and exports perhaps 30 million. Japan produces 110
million tons and exports 40 million. As long as Asia is strong, they are fine.
But if Asia hiccups or reverses, plant-utilization rates go from very high to
very, very low very quickly.

Then we discovered that Warren Buffett owned shares of South Korea’s Posco
[5490.S. Korea], and that Korea was the biggest importer of Japanese steel, but
Posco and Hyundai [5380.S. Korea] are building huge, integrated steel plants.
They have a surplus of steel capacity and—guess what?—they’re exporting to
Japan, because the yen is so strong.

Initially, I wanted to buy a three-year, out-of-the-money put on Nippon Steel.
My broker said, “I’ve been in a 20-year bear market; my boss will kill me.”
Then I thought, being long credit protection is being long volatility. I
redialed his credit counterpart. I said: “I’m thinking of purchasing up to a
billion yen of five-year credit-default swaps in Nippon Steel.” The first thing
he said was, “Would you consider 10 billion?” So one part of the bank is banned
from selling volatility, and the other part is having a party. I bought reams
of the stuff.

Hi Sergio

Re: Tax Lien Sales

When I was buying foreclosure properties in the 1990/1991 period, we had to be
aware of IRS Tax liens. These were not discharged in the sales so we had to
figure their cost to our overall purchase price if any of our properties had
such a lien. There was not enough time to check the property title because of
the number and frequency of the sales.

We had one $40K IRS tax lien that we were able to get discharged but it took a
lot of time and effort. I do not think any type of City/County and/or Federal
system is in place to buy/sell these liens. I do know that many of the Cities
are hurting for cash and past due property taxes would be something they might
negotiate in order to to get hard cash.

I am not sure it's an area worth exploring for an investment opportunity other
than perhaps buying foreclosure properties directly from City sales based on
delinquent property taxes due. Still too much work for me.

I like the sector and that the company has very little debt (ie excellent debt
profile) but the EK$ value is only $20.00/share, 40% below the current market
price. So for me, it's just too expensive. I guess, I would need a compelling
argument to buy them such as; they are the preferred suppler of pumps to the
E&P developers and/or margins are expanding w/ greater than expected orders
and/or some news that advances the state-of-the-art pump technology at a
reduced cost of production. Last earnings report they exceeded sales
projections but missed on earnings.

ROA (9.8%), ROE (13.9%) and ROI (12.1%) all in the OK range but expensive at a
20 trailing PE IMO.

------------------------------------------------

FWIW, after a brief scan of the companies in the <u>US Industrial - Diversified
Machinery sector</u> (using the ADVFN screener link above), I could find none
that sell at or below my calculated EK$ value. The only one that comes close is
Met-Pro Corporation Common Stoc (MPR) but it's 8% overvalued.

My conservative "value" approach would be to add GRC to my watch list and see
if at some point I can buy shares in the $20.00 price range.

RAIL is one I recently discovered. They make rail cars, specifically for coal.
They sell at 10 PE. Their EK$ value is around $25/share. The stock is selling
around $25.50. I am watching this one and may have more interest if they plan
on building OIL and/or NG tank cars. What is positive for the U.S.
manufacturing sector, is RAIL is building new rail cars in the U.S. that are
exported to other countries. It's not that often a U.S. company can compete
using U.S. labor especially building rail cars for export.

I like EV/EBITDA because it is possible to compare pipeline assets this way
regardless of the tax status. Good pipeline assets have trades as low as 7-8x
EBITDA in 2002 and 2008 (probably even lower in 2008) and that is when value
investors buy them. MLP usually go for a premium to the value of taxable C-
Corporation but i hate to pay much higher prices just because an asset is in a
tax shielded MLP.

The EV/EBITDA ratio depends on the life of the asset - a long aul pipeline may
have a service life of 50 year+ and hence deserves a higher EV/EBITDA ratio
than for example a gathering asset with a service life of 10 years.

EBITDA has become a dirty word in valuation because of the shenigans that
Worldcom and Global Crossing did but it's really a quick way to compare the
same assets/companies across different asset classes, countries or forms of
incorporation.

Right now, the only way to acquire a pipeline asset (although embedded in a
conglomerate) is buying L stock, imo. BRK has some too of course but they are
very small relative to the total size of BRK.

buys, processes and markets ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other recyclable
commodities for domestic users and export markets and offers programs and
equipment to help businesses manage waste, today announced financial results
for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011.

Revenue for 2011 was $276.9 million compared with $343.0 million in 2010. Net
loss for 2011 was $(3.9) million, or $(0.56) per diluted share, compared with
net income of $8.1 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, for 2010. Revenue for
the fourth quarter of 2011 was $50.0 million compared with $99.5 million for
the same period in 2010. Net income for the quarter was $(1.8) million, or
$(0.26) per diluted share, compared with $2.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted
share, for the fourth quarter of 2010.

Key Highlights 2011

-- Ferrous shipment volumes increased 7.5% year-over-year

-- Cash flow from operations was $19.0 million, primarily as a result of a
decrease in working capital

-- Repaid debt by $17 million

-- Current ratio at December 31, 2011, was 3.2 to 1

-- We exited 2011 with $29 million of working capital and $20 million of
availability on our revolving line of credit

Harry Kletter, founder and Chairman of ISA, stated, "The market demand for our
stainless products was extremely volatile in 2011. While this resulted in
short-term negative results, we believe the long-term outlook for this business
remains strong. We have continued to invest in our people and our processes,
and we expect to achieve improved profitability in our recycling segment. We
have brought new talent into the organization, including the addition of two
new board members with exemplary credentials, Dr. David Russell and Ms. Rudy
Scarito. We believe we can benefit from their varied but relevant backgrounds.
While we are still in the early days of 2012, we are beginning to see some
benefits from our efforts."

Brian Donaghy, President and Chief Operating Officer of ISA, stated, "We have
learned a lot since 2009 when we acquired the stainless steel business and
started operating our shredder. With more than 50 acres of land, access to
three major modes of transportation and ample on-site storage facilities, we
recognize that we have an ideally located, state-of-the-art facility. Despite
challenging industry conditions, which are apparent throughout the market, we
have maintained strong relationships with both suppliers and customers. Our
young team continues to season and we continue to believe ISA's performance
will steadily improve throughout 2012 and beyond."

net loss of $3,028,000 ($0.66 loss per share). The net loss for the 2010 fourth
quarter included a charge of $2,000,000 for costs related to non-renewal of the
former chief executive officer contract (including a non-cash charge of
$312,000 due to accelerated stock vesting) and $924,000 of non-cash impairment
charges taken in connection with recorded intangible assets and goodwill
related to its ICS subsidiary. Excluding these charges, the net loss for 2010
was $104,000 ($0.02 loss per share); and,

-- Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and stock
based compensation (EBITDA, as adjusted) was $1,162,000 ($0.25 earnings per
diluted share) compared to a loss of $1,564,000 ($0.34 loss per share).

Full Year 2011 vs. Full Year 2010

-- Net sales increased by 16% to $31,041,000 compared to $26,749,000;

-- Gross margin increased to 42.6% from 35.4%;

-- Net income was $3,147,000 ($0.67 earnings per diluted share) compared to a
net loss of $3,025,000 ($0.66 loss per share). Excluding the aforementioned
fourth quarter charges, the 2010 net loss was $101,000 ($0.02 loss per share);

-- EBITDA, as adjusted, was $3,845,000 ($0.82 earnings per diluted share)
compared to a loss of $831,000 ($0.18 loss per share); and,

-- Backlog at December 31, 2011 was $15.5 million as compared to $15.8 million
at September 30, 2011 and $20.1 million at December 31, 2010. Backlog was $18.7
million at February 29, 2012.

Commenting on fourth quarter results, Mitchell Binder, President & Chief
Executive Officer, stated, "The final quarter of 2011 was our strongest period
of the year. The 16.5% increase in net sales produced over $1 million in net
income, or a 12.5% net margin for the 2011 fourth quarter. The operating
leverage inherent in our business enabled us to achieve a 44.5% gross margin
and reduce selling, general and administrative (S, G & A) expenses as a percent
of net sales to 31.6%."

He continued, "Our strong fourth quarter capped our best operating year in
recent memory. Our net sales for 2011 exceeded $31 million and net income was
over $3 million, improving by more than $6.1 million year over year, due to the
increased sales, operating leverage (gross margin increased to approximately
43% returning to historical levels and S, G & A expenses as a percent of net
sales decreased to 32.1% as compared to 35.9% in 2010) and due to over $2.9
million of costs related to non-renewal of the former chief executive officer
contract and non-cash impairment charges which adversely affected the prior
year."

Discussing backlog and expectations for 2012, Mr. Binder added, "We closed the
year with backlog of $15.5 million and by February 29, 2012, backlog increased
to $18.7 million due to strong bookings from both our Power and Electronics
Groups. After a 35% increase in bookings, as well as record revenues and
backlog in 2011, our Power Group's 2012 year-to-date bookings have remained
strong and we expect to continue to receive follow-on orders for legacy
programs in both our COTS and Commercial Divisions. Additionally, our
Electronics Group started the year with a color display order from the U.S.
Navy valued at approximately $1.8 million with an exercise of an option to
purchase additional displays expected shortly. We are anticipating several
large orders for Remote Control Units under the Common Transponder Program and
for keyboards for the FAA, which as indicated by our customers, should be
awarded by the end of the first quarter to accommodate their delivery
requirements for this year."

Binder added, "Backlog from our TDL operating unit increased from year end due
to a $1.3 million contract received for the ground mobile marketplace. In
addition, TDL is also expecting approximately $1.5 million in new contracts for
avionic displays which we expect to receive prior to the end of the second
quarter. Our ICS subsidiary received an order for an additional two prototype
units for its Serial Data Converter, the replacement for the MK-119, and also
received an indication from the U.S. Navy of potential awards for additional
MK-119s for foreign military sales by the end of 2012. Based upon our backlog,
delivery schedules and expected orders, we anticipate another year of strong
operating performance in 2012, although as was the case in 2011, our comparable
and sequential quarterly performance may be uneven."

Mr. Binder concluded, "In addition to growing our business organically, in 2012
we continue our pursuit of strategic accretive acquisitions and we are
developing a pipeline of companies for consideration."

David Goldman, Chief Financial Officer, noted, "Our financial condition remains
strong. At December 31, 2011, total current assets were $20,876,000 versus
total current liabilities of $3,838,000 for a 5.4 to 1 current ratio. Cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2011, aggregated
over $2.6 million. Our inventory levels at 2011 year-end, although lower than
September 30, 2011, were higher than one year ago and will continue to increase
as buying has commenced for several orders expected for the Electronics Group.
To offset federal and state taxes resulting from profits, we have approximately
$9 million and $7 million in available federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards, respectively, which should enhance future cash flow. Our
tangible book value at December 31, 2011, was $3.76 per share, an increase of
22% from $3.07 per share at December 31, 2010. The Company was in compliance
with its financial covenants as of December 31, 2011 and our primary lender has
extended the expiration date of our credit line until June 1, 2012. We had no
borrowings under the line of credit as of December 31, 2011."

That looks like a pretty good idea, EKS. Your moves seem to be suitable for me
too. It just may be time to take some TPZ off the table. In since '09 with
additional buys and distributions reinvested, I'll follow you now: I sold a
chunk today. Also sold a small amount of GSTpa.

Nice article on COSWF. I'll look to start a small position.

(All this in an ira, so I'm assuming COSWF is like other Canadian
dividend/distribution stocks and there's no Canadian withholding taxes taken
out.)

I like SU Suncor Energy

Yield 1.32%
Forward PE 8.8
P/Book 1.4

Suncor Energy is an integrated energy company focused on the development of the
Canadian oil sands. Total production from oil sands and conventional assets
totaled 615,000 barrels in 2010, about 80% of which was oil. The company also
operates four refineries in Canada and the United States, with total throughput
capacity of 443,000 barrels per day.

Hi Brian -

SU Suncor Energy is another good one. This was discussed up thread around
12/2011 and was my first Buy into the Canadian Oil Sands. Paul Senior posted
this article ( http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27799398 )
where Charlie Maxwell a well known value investor talks about the Canadian Oil
Sand properties.

http://advisoranalyst.com/glablog/tag/suncor-energy-inc/

You can follow the discussion of the thread at that time between SU and
COSWF.pk. At the time I believe SU was just below $30.00/share. I started to
accumulate my position in SU at that price and COSWF.pk was selling at
$20.00/share.

Bottom line, COSWF.pk has not moved as much as SU. I like SU better especially
around $30.00/share because it seems to have more transparency & liquidity
selling on the NYSE. COSWF.pk is a good one to hold in the IRA as their
dividends are exempt from the foreign tax 15% withholding.

I pretty much gave up on my PBR shares and cashed those in to buy positions in
SU and COSWF.pk. So far it has turned out to be a good move. I will continue to
add to my SU position at prices $30.00/share or lower.

Also, once they get the Keystone pipeline built, much of the light, sweet
synthetic crude oil can be transported into the U.S. for refining and
distribution/export. This should be a long term positive for COSWF.pk as
pointed out in the SeekingAlpha article I posted.

Both Paul and Clownbuck provided some compelling arguments to own SU and/or
COSWF.pk. I ended up buying both.

Obama works the phones to block the Keystone pipeline again. The vote had to
have 60 votes and there were 58 Senators that would have votes in favor (with
two Republicans not voting)
 http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?c
ngress=112&session=2&vote=00034

Washington (CNN) -- The Senate narrowly rejected a Republican-sponsored measure
Thursday that would have bypassed the Obama administration's current objections
to the Keystone XL pipeline and allowed construction on the controversial
project to move forward immediately.
Fifty-six senators voted in favor of the amendment -- four short of the 60
required for approval. Eleven Democrats joined a unanimous Republican caucus in
backing the plan.

The proposed 1,700-mile long pipeline expansion, intended to carry crude oil
from Canada's oil sands to the U.S. Gulf Coast, has become a political
lightning rod. Supporters, including the oil industry, say it's a vital job
creator that will lessen the country's dependence on oil imported from volatile
regions.

Opponents say the pipeline may leak, and that it will lock the United States
into a particularly dirty form of crude that might ultimately end up being
exported anyway.

The measure has sharply divided key Democratic constituencies. Labor unions
largely back the plan while environmentalists oppose it.

President Barack Obama rejected a bid in January to expedite the pipeline,
arguing that a decision deadline imposed by Congress did not leave sufficient
time to conduct necessary reviews. Administration officials have said the
president may still eventually give the project a green light, though critics
accuse him of trying to delay a final decision until after the November
election.

Obama personally lobbied wavering Democrats to block passage of the amendment.

"He made some calls," White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters
before the vote. "The president believes that it is wrong to play politics with
a pipeline project whose (exact) route has yet to be proposed."

While the amendment would have approved the construction of most of the
pipeline expansion, it would not have allowed any work to begin immediately in
Nebraska. Dave Heineman, Nebraska's Republican governor, cited environmental
concerns in opposing the original route of the proposed expansion.

For their part, congressional Republicans blasted the president for twisting
the arms of fellow Democrats.

"By personally lobbying against the Keystone pipeline, it means the president
of the United States is lobbying for sending North American energy to China and
lobbying against American jobs," House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a
news conference.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Obama is "out of
touch" on the issue.

"At a moment when millions are out of work, gas prices are skyrocketing, and
the Middle East is in turmoil, we've got a president who's up making phone
calls trying to block a pipeline here at home," he said. "It's unbelievable."

Republican presidential front-runner Mitt Romney called the decision a
"no-brainer."

"How in the world can you have a president who doesn't understand the
importance of getting energy from our next-door neighbor?" he said.

Democratic opposition to the Republican measure was complicated by reports last
week that former President Bill Clinton came out in favor of building the
pipeline.

GM: In for a position today. Somewhat late, I've missed the current run-up.
Although I'm not much of a fan of GM directors/management, nor of their cars
I've purchased in my younger days, at current price the stock does show some
attractive numbers which I didn't notice until now: P/e is 5-6; $31.6B in cash,
which is $20 on the $25 stock; total debt $14B with d/e ratio .36 (all numbers
from Yahoo).

Some analysts say in future, overall car sales volume will continue to improve
from past few years' low levels because the replacement market must grow. And
that would be because the average holding period for cars is at highs -- so in
time these older cars will be replaced. I'm not so sure I agree that that's an
important point in the here-and-now. After all, -g-, just on this thread alone
we've got many people content with owning and operating their 10,15, 20 year
old vehicles. Vehicle age and high odometer readings don't have to be
dis-satisfiers or reasons to buy new vehicles.

GM's got its problems in Europe (Opel), and although China sales are up,
there's the suspicion that China treats foreign auto companies as visitors --
tolerated short-term vistors only until Chinese companies acquire technology
and expertise to dismiss these guests. Otoh, GM is #1 or 2 in car sales
world-wide, so it gets economies-of-scale with manufacturing, etc.

I'm also considering whether I want to sell some/all Toyota shares I have,
because just looking at GM vs. TM, GM seems to me to be much more
bargain-priced than Toyota now.

I would keep my hands off General Motors. Yes, they have had a recent run up in
sales, but this could just be a result of channel stuffing (i.e. selling cars
to vendors and reporting the revenue). If this indeed was the case, expect a
very large drop in sales in the upcoming months.

GM: Could be. I'm buying though on strength of balance sheet.

Sales will slow; I'm assuming most of that will be slowing of blistering pace
in China:

I have been bitten by channel stuffing before (big pharma). So I don't doubt it
might be an issue with cars. I've no info that this is what's happening here
now though. GM gets paid when vehicles are shipped to or accepted by dealers (I
believe). Not when cars are sold to retail folk. I've seen nothing that says
dealers are complaining about being overstocked, although I've not really paid
attention to see.

Some Chevy's do seem to be very slow sellers:

tough business; I would go for companies that have sustainable advantages like
VW, BMW, Daimler or Toyota. I don't own any of these right now but I think
Daimler and VW are the best value from the lot.

OT - it appears that the ECB is flooding the European financial markets with
liquidity, more than a trillion Euros in December and another trillion just now
recently. This should set a fire under European based financials, IMO. I think
it might be a good time to buy some cheap stocks (European banks etc.).

Sometimes I can handle mediocre if price is right. Price is right for me for
GM. (I reserve right to change my mind on a different day.)

GM is #1 or #2 in new vehicle sales, so there are plenty of people who believe
they are getting value for money spent when they buy GM.

Do you have a favorite among those Euro banks?

BNP is now selling off some assets. I don't know if that's a sign of

BMW (BAMXY.PK ) just reported record sales with significant improvement in
China and the U.S. Also, upped their div. and are forecasting continuing
success.

Unit sales of the main BMW brand were up 12.8 percent, Mini sales raced ahead
by 21.7 percent and Rolls-Royce were up as much as 30.5 percent.

That pushed the automobile division's pre-tax earnings up by 75.5 percent to
6.823 billion euros or 92 percent of the group total.

The financial services division reported a 47.4-percent increase in pre-tax
earnings to 1.79 billion euros.

Robert b furman: I appreciate your opinion and respect your business experience
as a dealer. Do you have any opinion to offer as to the attractiveness or not
of auto dealer stocks at this time? The stocks are mostly all up near highs, so
that means somebody's got some confidence somewhere -- maybe it's only the
stock market moving up and market players looking at chart patterns (momentum
players), or maybe it's also in the outlook for the business itself (car
sales/dealer profitability). I assume there's some cyclical nature to the
business, and since most of the stocks are near 12-mo highs, it is not a time
to be being these stocks.

That said, I expect I'll continue to hold Penske(PAG) and my stub of Group 1
(GPI), with LAD and SAH on my watch list. I hadn't looked at AutoNation (AN) in
a while. I like that it's the USA's largest auto retailer and that it is
trading closer to lows than near highs. Otoh, on the metrics I'm looking at
(which may be the wrong metrics) -- on p/sales, p/book, p/e -- the stock at
current price is about as expensive as other public dealership stocks. AN might
be worth a small bet for me, although I'd not call it a value proposition as I
view it.

Hi Paul-

STORA ENSO OYJ ADS (SEOAY.PK)
http://www.storaenso.com/

Great find. Company appears undervalued according to the EK$ valuation
criteria. Forward PE of 11.95, 4% dividend yield and a debt profile that is a
bit higher than I like (but better than FBR) at 12X net income/LT debt. Their
TBV is $9.72/share. My EK$ valuation figure using their 2011 earnings of
$0.59/share is $11.36/share 55% undervalued from the current market price.

This is a cyclical industry and is very capital intensive. Earnings can vary a
lot over the business cycle so the EK$ value will too.

That said, seems like a much better operation than FBR and holds a lot of
valuable Forestry (above ground) assets. I am in for a starter position moving
the proceeds from FBR into SEOAY.pk.

Will add shares below $7.00/share or as the dividend yield approaches 5%.

Hi gizwik -

Coffee Holding Co., Inc. (JVA)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=JVA+Key+Statistics

The company is in a tough and competitive business. They appear to more of a
Micro Brewery type niche company. They did report very good earnings and from
my quick view of their financials, do qualify as a "value" candidate company
IMO (w/ a EK$ at $8.50/share but not reliable w/ their past earnings history).

Specifically I like their very conservative debt profile. Only 2.2x annual net
income covers their LT debt.. Their forward PE of 7x is attractive too.

My only concern is positive earnings growth may not be sustainable due to the
nature of their business and the small size of the company. However, you do not
expect a Micro Cap company to even fit "value" criteria. If management can
string together several positive earnings reports and continue to grow sales,
maybe there is another Starbucks in the making.

I suspect they will continue to do well as long as they stay under the radar of
the much larger coffee companies.

This is still one I probably would not own (I hold for 3-5 years) since it's a
tough market to operate in and I doubt JVA will be a survivor in this industry
in five years.

However, I have been wrong many times. For me, the risk/reward is just not
there.

Hi paul,

Having positions in 4 dealerships has kept me quite blind to buying more auto
stocks.I do need to sleep at night.LOL

That being said Auto dealerships are poised for a long run of good business.

Autonation gave up many domestics and bought imports and high end stores.I
think the worm has turned for Japanese imports - the strength of the Yen has
forced cost cutting and content reductions and will for a long time IMO.I think
there are a lot of Toyota stores that were thought of as the best and far too
high premiums were paid for them.

GM stock has a good business model, but there is surely a lot of supply out
there as /if price goes up.

The high end has good stability.

The beauty of most dealerships is the need for more fixed (parts service and to
a lessor degree body shop - some do and some don't do BS).

Used is a very hard business but very big business. Used is much bigger inb

Since the credit crisis,many small dealers have closed.

Most factory programs have image plans which are disguised multi tier
programs.These require mid sized stores to have a core volume or in the long
run they will disappear.

The big publicly owned dealerships are in a huge battle that is testing
margins.The internet is declining retail margins every where - especially in
big urban markets.

IMHO and it is just that,I see small ADI's as the future crown jewels.They have
geographic isolation - which magically supports somewhat higher grosses in new
and used and certainly supports the local need for advanced repair
capabilities.

I've not studied the public stores at all but the one that appeals to me the
most for my kind of dealership is Lythia motors.They have a big presence in
Alaska and those higher margin but smaller points are what I think will be an
annuity going into the somewhat pent up market we will have for many years.

Those are just my opinion and I have not studied the thesis at all as I have
all the auto based investments I want forever.LOL

Hope that helps put you in a correct direction.I'd like to know what you find
in your study.

They certainly aren't for everyone but they have been in business for

Mountain, their best customer. This company will have ups and downs due to

Robert b furman: Thanks for your considered response.

I have some of the same ideas in this respect:

"...I see small ADI's as the future crown jewels." (I assume by ADI you mean
independent dealerships)
My presumption, which got me interested in car dealerships in the first place
is this: If I go to any small town and ask the locals who the wealthiest
families are in their town, responses are going to be doctor(s), lawyers
(maybe), and the local car dealership owner(s). Maybe car dealership families
#1. (They have those little monopolies that pass from one generation to the
next.)

"...the one that appeals to me the most for my kind of dealership is Lythia
motors." Me too. Lithia's stores are in small out-of-the-way communities like
the independents above. And so Lithia has their local area as a captive area.
(Who's going to travel 150 miles to get their car fixed at some other shop that
has the good diagnostic equipment and cert techs? And if you're a local and you
buy your car at the big city dealership to save a few hundred bucks, then
you're faced with having to face your local dealer when you want service and
when you see him/them in the community -- which you just might in a small
town.) I'm sorry I let Lithia (LAD) get away from me at lower prices. (I sold
my position.) At current stock price, it's too expensive for me to re-initiate
a position. LAD may have its great locations; auto sales and auto retail stocks
can cycle though, and I guess LAD seems to be at a high point now.

I sold 1/2 my position in Toyota today, and opened a small position in
AutoNation (AN). Meanwhile I still hold a few shares of F, the GM which I just
bought, and some VLKAY (Volkswagen)

Hi Paul,

I must apologize for rambling in the jargon of dealer language.

ADI =A TV stations Area of Dominant Influence.

These are mid sized cities that have malls,hospitals and their own TV stations.

In Texas they would be Lufkin, Waco,Victoria,Corpus Christi. Not Houston,
Dallas, Austin, or San Antonoe

Wisconsin they would be Wausau,Green Bay,Lacrosse ,not Milwaukee,Madison

Lithia has mid sized dealerships with geographical isolation in those smaller
ADI's

They buy these mid sized dealerships and implement sound business
practices,common accounting systems,human resources,group purchasing power for
all products bought and sold.

I think they are brilliant.

I think they are high in price and I bet they go a lot higher.

Brazil to extend IOF tax to longer maturities, paper says
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/brazil-extend-iof-tax-longer-163450155.html
March 10, 2012
* IOF to be extended to loans maturing in up to 5 years-Folha

* Would be second IOF change in less than two weeks

From the article:"...Brazil will extended a 6 percent tax known as the IOF on
overseas loans with maturities of up to five years, local newspaper Folha De
S.Paulo reported on Saturday.
The tax had previously been charged when companies in Brazil took foreign loans
maturing up to two years, but was extended to three years on March 1. The
change will be enacted at the beginning of next week, the newspaper reported,
without citing sources...".

------------------------------------------------

Also with all the QE from the U.S. and EU, worldwide currencies are getting
whipsawed. The Brazilian Real is all over the board but many of the company
loans must be paid back in $US.

I am out of all Brazil stocks except VALE, ULTR and NPK.

I will not be buying any other Brazil stocks and am hesitant to add any Foreign
stocks because of all the ripple effects QE is having on country currencies.
The exception might be Finland. The other key is to look at the type of debt
from the Foreign company and see what the terms are for that being paid off (in
$US , EURO's or in the local currency).

So I will only be buying Foreign companies w/ little to no long term debt and
that debt must be paid back in the local currency.

Note: Several of these companies have used different types of currency hedges
but from my experience these hedges do not really smooth out the impact of
these huge currency effects. Some years large gains are reported and other huge
losses due to currency exchange gains/losses.

FWIW my most recent foreingn stock purchase,Stora Enso Oyj SEOAY did complete a
EUR 500 Million Eurobond refinance. The company also carries a lot of LT debt.
However, it replaced FBR which had much more LT debt that was to be paid back
in $US.

I would not be surprised that if the QE from Europe and U.S. continues, we see
more international barriers to trade in the form of tariffs, foreign taxes
and/or preferential deals to local companies over foreign for JV, partnerships
and other trade agreements.

this. The price of the stock has decreased by 1.7% since...."

-----------------------------------------------------

I have been looking at this one to start a tracking position in. If one feels
that management has positioned the company now for no more earnings surprises
and EPS are positive going forward, the EK$ value could top $50.00/share.
Therefore, if I can start a position at the right price ($24.25/share or
lower), the risk/reward opportunity appears good.

From their most current earnings report:
http://www.metal-powder.net/view/24306/om-group-sees-net-income-tumble-54-5-in-

Despite a 26.6% rise in net sales to US$1.5 billion, the operating profit took
a 70.2% fall to US$36.5m.
From the article:"...Joseph Scaminace, President and CEO, says: “During the
fourth quarter we felt the impacts of the slowing European economy and
disruptions to the electronics industry from the Thailand floods.”

Their Magnetic Technologies Division took a hit due to the recent Thailand
flood. I expect this was a one time event and revenues should catch up over
2012.

This has been one of Doug Kass' largest positions for a while - don't know what
he has said recently though. For those who don't know him, he tends to be an
ornery value guy, often net short the market, as he is now. He did call the
2009 bottom almost exactly as well as the rally this year.

CERGF. Somebody more knowledgeable than me will have to answer. I don't use
that metric. CERGF made a very significant acquisition (Riverland AG); it's not
been on the books a full year, and so I'm not understanding some of the
company's consolidation numbers or whether they are relevant when looking at an
interim report.

As I suspected, EBITDA does not look relevant. It looks like an Investment

only $2 million per quarter.

I established a position in ALU based on the fact that there is enormous hunger
for bandwidth and it will be increasing I don't know how far in the future. The
more we go "Cloud", "Netflix" and " iTunes"and it will all be wireless in
shorter distances and optical in medium distances. Alcatel has good technology
for both. Unfortunately I missed it around 1.6$ and I am very cautious with my
first buy. I am also sold some puts at 2$ strike premium 10cents which is 5%
till April 20. Or I will end up with the shares 20% cheaper than the current
price.

CERGF - i looked at this briefly. Robohogs is correct that they are an
investment holding and have disposition gains and losses which run through the
income statement. Hence EBITDA is indeed not relevant but NAV should be. They
eventually want to be become an operating business apparently but right now,
it's a mix between an investment holding and some AG assets.

It might be a good bet with Viterra now getting a bid from Cargill, who knows.

FDP: Paulelgin, I like your pick of Fresh Del Monte better than mine of DOLE.
I'll swap out my DOLE shares now and move into FDP. FDP has a lower d/e ratio,
pays a small dividend, shows growth in stated bv, trades at a somewhat smaller
p/sales ratio than its historical average.

Hi Paul -

The ADVFN Web Site has a visual Financial (Beta) link at the top middle of the
page. Here they present the key Annual Financials over several years ( as much
as 16 years).. The BV chart must be their total $BV not the per share amount.
This is confirmed by looking at the Shares Outstanding chart (bottom left)
showing that their share count doubled from 1996 to 2011.
http://www.advfn.com/p.php?pid=vfcharts&symbol=OMG

Therefore, the chart you posted provides a look at the growth per share which
is probably a better representation.

The nice thing on these beta charts is the long run look it provides especially
for EPS. I have been scanning this page every time I view the main ADVFN page.
Like a doctor reading an EKG, the company annual financials depicted in time
series graph form helps me see how management and the company have done over
the last 10 years.

True and knowing when to get out is instumental in owning. I can't complain so
far in owning it several times over the past two years. I was surprised at the

Re: FDP

Thanks, Paul. I was in Chiquita before I stumbled upon FDP. Chiquita was
trading below working capital, but I was very concerned with their debt level
(term debt = scary proposition).

I really like FDP at these levels. Right around/slightly below bv. Decent
little dividend. I think it wants to get up to $25.

After the Canadian Wheat and grain board gets dismantled soon it will do
wonders for margins and the ability of grain companies to expand their
businesses. This is a play on continued sale of commodities to China, Europe,
etc. PPS should climb as the business model gets fully developed by this former
investment firm. Book value over $10.00 and they partially own (25%) a railroad
in Canada as well that ships oil from Sask. Alberta.
