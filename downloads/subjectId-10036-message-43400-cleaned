>>This company is still overvalued. Once they mark-to-market their foreclosed
and shadow inventory loans adjust their loans refinanced after 2006 (especially
those that did cash out financing), I figure tangible book is overstated by at
least 60%. If you assume that these loans are overstated by $75K on average and
they refinanced a total of 500K loans during this period (remember they also
carry the CountryWide inventory) that's 37.5B in more write offs.<<

How to you get this numbers? Most of these mortgages are not on BAC books any
more. Some have deficient paperwork and can be put back (if indeed they went
bad.), but the total amount is going to be a small fraction of the nominal
value. The amount for putbacks/quarters has started to decrease for the Y2006
vintage (and of course for the vintages before). Y2007 is still rising and in
Y2008 the mortgage market and Countrywide already collapsed so there are much
less mortgages that can possible be bad.

My thinking is that we are close to the peak in terms of mortgage putbacks and
they are bound to fall, simply because the amount of mortgages that can still
go bad is limited.

A few other things - BAC has 5.3B$ in reserves against mortgage specifically
claims and a total of 40B$ in reserves against losses that are not accounted
for in equity. Also, you should not extrapolate findings from the worst bubble
markets like Las Vegas or Phoenix to the entire pool of mortgages, imo.

I guess we are all prisoners of our regrets:

Madharry: Regret: selling a profitable position too soon. Madharry counters
that, as I read it, by using technicals (ta) to stay with trend, even though
stock may appear fair-valued. Train oneself to stay with stock for years as
long as company produces per its plans. Train oneself to live with volatility
so as to avoid getting shaken out of a good stock.

EKS: Regret: holding a profitable position too long and then riding it down:
Countered by using fair value (fundamental value) to determine sell point (or
points).
I sense from your posts here, that the counter might involve trimming of
position as stock appreciates (partial sales vs. exit at all at once).

Paul Senior: Biggest regret: missed opportunities. Countered by increasing the
number of positions held in every category. Deviating from strict Graham, to
include gaarp, growth, speculative stocks. (Too much so, -g-, as some have
said: "You buy everything")

Hi Clownbuck -

I wonder if "Linda Green" now works with BofA. Last year "Linda Burton" aka
robo-signer was signing mortgage documents for several banks including BofA. It
doesn't look like they fixed the problem. Do you really think they also fixed
the way they account for their non-performing loans?

AP Exclusive: Mortgage 'robo-signing' goes on
AP Exclusive: 'Robo-signing,' at center of foreclosure probe last year, is
still rampant
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/AP-Exclusive-Mortgage-apf-3239330433.html?x=0&sec
topStories&pos=main&asset=&ccode=

From the article:"...O'Brien returned the nine Burton documents to Bank of
America in mid-June. He told the bank he would not file them unless the bank
signed an affidavit certifying the signature and accepting responsibility if
the title was called into question down the road. Instead, Bank of America sent
new documents with new signatures and new notaries.

<u>A Bank of America spokesman says Burton is an assistant vice president with
a subsidiary, ReconTrust.</u> That company handles mortgage paperwork
processing for Bank of America.

"She signed the documents on behalf of the bank," spokesman Richard Simon says.
The bank says providing the affidavit O'Brien asked for would have been costly
and time-consuming. Instead, Simon says Bank of America sent a new set of
documents "signed by an authorized associate who Mr. O'Brien wasn't
challenging."

The bank didn't respond to questions about why Burton's name has been signed in
different ways or why her signature appeared on documents that investigators in
at least two states have deemed invalid.

Several attempts by the AP to reach Burton at <u>ReconTrust </u>were
unsuccessful...."

It's still a big fraud over a year ago when they were supposed to stop this
robo-signing practice.

re Linda Green /robosigner. This does not sound like it's a BofA problem alone
since several banks are involved.

Apparently the arduous task of checking and signing foreclosures notices has
been outsourced to the lowest bidder.

Back to valuation, BofA practically already pre-announced earnings (pre-
settlement numbers) already when they issued a press release regarding the
mortgage warranty deal (P14):

AnthonyD. Here's a list of books I currently have on my shelf that I'm slowly
going through:

Outsmarting the Smart Money, Cunningham, 2002

A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market, Paulos. 2003. Taking me seemingly
forever to get myself to read through this.

What Investors Really Want, Statman, 2011. One of the few stock market books I
bought at full price. (If I buy at all, I almost always buy them used.) Pretty
eye-opening book if you believe the only reason people buy stocks is to make
money.

Money Wise: How to Create, Grow, and Preserve Your Wealth, Lipper, 2008. I find
it boring and for me, a slow read.

John Neff on Investing, Neff, 2009. Too much of an autobiography. Another slow
go for me.

Getting Started in Options, Thomsett. Really not significant to me: I avoid
using options.

---------------------------------

Just getting started in Value Investing? Then:

My most valuable, most annotated book is Intelligent Investing.

Suggestion: Go to Tweedy Browne website and order free copy of "What Works on
Wall Street"

I like Al Frank's New Prudent Speculator, by Frank. I've found his pillars of
"PASADARM" - patience, selection, diversification, risk management, to be
important.

Spooner's stock market books are good. I've liked, "Do you Want to Make Money
or Would You Rather Fool Around." His "Confessions of a Stockbroker" was
popular in its day.

I have Marty Whitman's "Value Investing, A Balanced Approach". Another where
for me the effort to get through it exceeds the nuggets that I got.

A Thousand Miles from Wall Street, Tony Gray, 1995. Easy and fun read. I
learned a lot. I sometimes reread sections when I need some encouragement.

I've more I could mention, but enough from me for now. I'll let others comment
about the Train books and the popular Greenblatt books, and the classic Peter
Lynch books. I assume most value investors have these on their bookshelves or
have read them.

You likely can get reviews about all of these books from people who commented
on them at Amazon.

Hi Clownbuck -

Bank loan valuations - classifying nonperforming loans - (Can you really
believe the reported tangible asset value?)

Can you explain how a bank classifies a performing loan to a nonperforming
status? Are there industry (or accounting) regulations that a U.S. bank must
follow in classifying the loan status (ie mortgage payments are in the rears by
90 days or more is nonperforming)? Are all loans that go into foreclosure
categorized as non performing by definition. What about those loans that are
titled back to the bank, are these loans classified as non performing?

I ask this because I am aware of no industry standard that banks must follow in
their public accounting that maintains a standard method for accounting for
nonperforming loans.

What adjustments do the banks make (if any) for their performing loans where
the collateralized assets decrease in value (based off their initial
appraisal)? Many of the loans done 24-36 months ago s/b be valued 30% less
because of a falling real estate market values. Do the banks set aside possible
loan loss capital because of falling real estate values. Or do they make loan
loss adjustments only when these loans become nonperforming?

Finally, are there any industry (and/or government) regulations as to how much
leverage a bank can utilize in their business ? Is it 10:1, 20:1 or even 30:1
or is it at the discretion of the bank(s) and the type of operation/venture (ie
derivatives, hedging, simple home loans) they operate. Is the recent stress
test guidelines supposed to control excess leverage? Is this an easy number for
me (or any other investor) to calculate for each bank?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------

I have no idea what standards the mega banks must follow. Their operations are
over my head when evaluating possible risks, amount of leverage, quality of
their loans and what they eventually report to shareholders. It all reminds me
of Enron accounting.

I do have a negative bias as I got screwed on Citicorp & Washington Mutual
owning shares in both which became worthless. I followed their quarterly
accounting, specifically the quality of their loan portfolio(s) but in
hindsight none of their reporting was a true picture of what actually was. What
has changed in the last 6 years (other than a falling RE market) and why should
I believe their accounting now?

FWIW BAC's report was pretty good (if you believe it) especially the revenues
they reported for operations other than real estate (like credit cards). I
still think they are too big and should be split up into separate companies.

Try "A Zebra In Lion Country" by Ralph Wanger:

Editorial Reviews
From Library Journal
Wanger has managed the highly successful Acorn mutual fund for over 25 years,
investing in undervalued but financially sound smaller companies with superior
growth potential. Because there are so many stocks to evaluate, Wanger first
looks for growth themes and then identifies specific companies. He doesn't
believe in market timing and considers mutual funds to be the best option for
most investors. Like Peter Lynch and John Rothchild's One Up on Wall Street (S.
& S., 1989), this book does a good job of explaining the basics of investing in
a nontechnical and often amusing manner, though it is largely limited to
Wanger's own investing experience. Recommended for general and informed readers
interested in investing.?Lawrence Maxted, Gannon Univ., Harborcreek, Pa.
Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc. --This text refers to an out of
print or unavailable edition of this title.

Review
Don Phillips Morningstar, Inc. Ralph Wanger's A Zebra in Lion Country is a
delightful book. Few managers can match Wanger's investment prowess. Fewer
still can share the secrets to their success with such wit and clarity. From
novice to pro, every investor should read this book. -- Review

Product Description

Ralph Wanger explains how to invest in small, rapidly growing companies whose
stocks represent good values. This should help readers maximize profits and
minimize risks - and survive the rough spells on the way to greater wealth.

About the Author

of small, rapidly growing companies, has one of the best long-term performance
records in the mutual fund industry. A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute

I'll challenge you guys again on Klarman.

I'll pull my Klarman book out again and look at my notes. Every time I do, I
just shake my head. I don't know what you want in a good value book, but for me
Klarman ain't it.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25667578&srchtxt=klarman

1. What's a methodology or what are the techniques the author uses that I can
apply in a similar way, so I can get favorable results too? Maybe not as good
as the author, but something that helps me? Something that's actionable.

2. How about something that gives me some encouragement that I can do okay in
investing if I use some of the principles that the author espouses?

I got nothing actionable from Klarman. Not only that, I found it discouraging
to read. Ooooh the world is so dangerous, and mistakes and losses are so easily
made. It's a miracle if somebody makes money in the market. Margin is safety is
so so so important and so difficult.

========
I been posting on Klarman's picks here for several years. As I often claim, I
can't figure out why he buys what he does. Couple years back he was buying
several SPAC's. What outsider can figure out what they are worth? And his
biotech picks. Try to ascertain value there, let alone what the margin of
safety is. It's inexplicable.

I'm willing to bet on Klarman though -- to follow him into some of his picks.

picks:

So odd that I trash the book but buy into some of his picks, and yet I don't
see any of you Klarman fans putting any of your money into anything he buys.

So how helpful or useful could this Klarman book actually be? Ha. --I guess

Hi elmatador - This looked like a different twist on using Brazil sugar cane. I
didn't realize that Dow already grows sugar cane on roughly 42,000 acres in
Brazil. The company has a forward PE of 9.6 and is in a sector that W. Buffet
likes which could bode well for the company long term.

Dow Chemical, Mitsui in Brazil sugar cane venture

Dow Chemical Co and Mitsui & Co Ltd have formed a joint venture to turn sugar
cane into ethanol and plastic, an area widely considered the future of the
chemical industry.

It looks like DOW was able to acquire these assets on the cheap: From the
article"...Dow first announced its sugar cane operation in 2007 as part of a
joint venture with the now-defunct Crystalsev. Dow bought Crystalsev's stake
after its collapse and has since been searching for a new partner...".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------

I will add this one to my AG watch list but this industry is quite cyclical and
could correct substantially on any slow down in the economy. An entry point
below $20 would reflect a 50% retracement from it's three year high to it's
three year low. At the current price DOW is not a screaming value buy but on
any substantial correction it might be worth a small buy as a tracking
position.

EKS, an analysis on BAC posted on http://www.distressed-debt-investing.com/ -
sorry graphs did not come out

BAC versus the ABX

At the IRA Sohn Conference this year, Jeff Gundlach, of Doubleline Funds put up
a chart of Bank of America versus the ABX 2007-1 AAA tranche. Here is that
graph:

Pretty tight correlation. A month or so ago I pointed out that non-agency
mortgages were attractive and an uneconomic seller (the Fed) was really
weighing on the market. With the Fed putting on hold any further Maiden Lane II
auctions, the market has really taken a leg up. And because of that, the above
relationship is falling apart:

This graph is normalized since January 1st, 2011 - I thought it better shows
the dramatic out-performance of the ABX vs BAC equity.

For full disclosure, I have been buying BAC leaps in the last few weeks (Jan
2013 @ 15 strike). Call me crazy, but all the data I have gathered and read
indicated the banks are ready to lend to their customers on the residential
mortgage side. All "lending surveys" out there show an easing of conditions for
everything but resi mortgages, but the tide is turning here and I believe this
metric will go positive soon. Furthermore, the valuation argument is quite
compelling. Eventually, loss provisions will normalize, and at run-rate
operating earnings the equity looks like a steal (I have it at $2/share
normalized EPS)

Finally, there is so much negativity in this name. Here are the list of reasons
I've heard or read to not invest in Bank of America:

•They are going to have to raise more capital to meet all Tier 1/Basel 3
requirements
•They will have to settle with all the bond guarantors at billions of dollars
each / Other put-back issues
•Their housing exposure dwarfs the other money center banks and home prices
still have a long way to go before reaching bottom
•Litigation coming from every which way (AGs -> robo signers for instance)
•The debt ceiling won't be raised and the world comes to an end (Side note:
That August 2nd date is silly...if push comes to shove, the Fed will accept
expiring bills as repo collateral to give the morons in Washington a few weeks)
•China Construction Bank trade likes a dog
•They aren't well positioned for a rise in rates
•Etc. Etc.

Why the leaps you ask? I very rarely invest in leaps just because the potential
downside is 100% (option expires). In this case, I feel like I've given myself
enough time for the market to reprice BAC's equity to a more normalized level
and I've converted my upside downside from say 1:1 being long the stock (b/c
BAC's equity, in theory could still go to zero) to 3-4:1 for most likely a
binary situation. For the conservative investor you could buy 2 year protection
on BAC at 100 basis points running and simply go long the equity. I've been
spending a significant time on financials the last few months and will try to
update my thoughts here as trades unfold.

During the last credit crunch in 2008, some hedge funds owned cattle and goats

Here is my first crack at a value play:

ABITIBIBOWATER INC., ABH

Revenues: 4746 million 2010

Share price: $19.45

P/E: .66

Diluted EPS with extraordinary items: $28

 Base on 1Q2011

Profit margin: 6.6 %

Long Term Debt; $2410

Total Assets: 7178

Total shares outstanding: 114.1

BV/share: 41.79

ROE: 2.52%

Free Cash Flow/share (using shares issued 97.1M): .55

Salient points as I understand them:

1. ABITIBIBOWATER INC is a Canadian based paper and wood products company with
global operations. They recently emerged from bankruptcy and is a successor
company.

2. The company faces strong headwinds as a result of ongoing decline in
newsprint readership, the feeble house starts situation in the U.S., and the
global economic downturn.

3. Through the resolution of bankruptcy proceedings the company will pay the
remaining $4852 million of unsecured debt with shares the company has put
aside: approximately 22.3 million shares.

4. The a company has put aside $35 million for remaining debt obligation, which
they claim is the maxim aggregate amount to be disbursed should they loose
their litigated cases.

5. Thorough Wells Fargo, the company have approximately $750 million available
as revolving credit. (ABL Credit Facility) The covenant of this agreement is
restrictive. The company must maintain certain financial ratios and cash on
hand requirements.

6. $903 million, 10.25% senior secured notes due 2018

7. The company is planning on exploiting the increased and larger newspaper
markets in Asia, the middle east and Latin America. I believe newspaper
readership in China may decline however in favor of electronic devices.

8. The CEO, Richard Garneau, took his position in June of 2010. Prior to this
appointment he was the CEO of Catalyst paper. At Catalyst Paper, Mr. Garneau
streamlined operations, and improved efficiency.

9. Their new marketing head is Mr. John Lafave, promoted from within the
company. This leads me to believe marketing may not have a dramatic changes in
it's method.

</u>Threats:</u>

1. The paper industry is in secular decline. There are less costumers and
intense competition. The wind is not at their backs.

2. The company has a case in front of the Supreme Court of Canada, "On March
31, 2010, the Canadian Court dismissed a motion for declaratory judgment
brought by the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, awarding costs in our
favor, and thus confirmed our position that the five orders the province issued
under section 99 of its Environmental Protection Act on November 12, 2009 were
subject to the stay of proceedings pursuant to the Creditor Protection
Proceedings. The province of Newfoundland and Labrador’s orders could have
required us to proceed immediately with the environmental remediation of

re ABH -
we, I had a crack at it first:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27392581&srchtxt=ABH

Good summary overall. the attraction is that after the sale of hydro assets,
the debt is down to ~600M$ - if yiou substract the cash on hand (~300M$), you
get ABH almost free and clear.

+ assets probably below replacement value (management is instinctive is to
undervalue assets post bankruptcy)
+ cyclical upswing possible
+ very good balance sheet
+ larger players may want to buy it
+ asian demand
+ other value investors have bought at higher prices mostly (3rD avenue,
Fairholm)
+1.6B$ in NOL available = no taxes for a long time

- cyclical industry with bad LT track record
- old management in place (partly)
- missed earnings last quarter
-secular decline in paper business

I own quite a bit of ABH. Based on my experience, most post bankruptcy plays
work out OK.

Yes, a pretty good summary of ABH with salient points and threats.

I generally try to find one or more ruling reasons to buy a stock. Although you
indicate ABH is a value play, you don't actually come right out and say why you
believe the stock should be bought now, or if it should not be bought at all
now

Company is a cigar butt at this time. Imo. And I'd guess Dr. Graham might
classify it as such too. I further speculate that he'd say for the conservative
investor, it's a no-go because the company's just out of bankruptcy, and
there's not enough history of positive earnings. For his enterprising investor
though, he might say, your stock fits. Because the stock's way below stated
book value, the company does have real assets, the debt looks like it might be
manageable, and looks to be reduced. I would assume Dr. Graham would say if it
were to be bought, it should be in either a diversified portfolio or within a
package of other cigar butts.

The stock appears to be selling at prices below what it traded for when it just
came out of bankruptcy. I don't know at what price the big investors bought
their shares (maybe at lower prices when the stock was in bankruptcy): There
are a number of supposedly astute value investors who still may be in this
stock: Fairholme (indirectly buying more last month: $10M worth at over
$22/sh), Paulson, Chou (ref: my earlier post here on him and ABH), Steelhead
Partners, Clownbuck.

I am following along with a few shares which I intend to hold 12-18 months to
see if the value in the company that might be there, gets realized.

Paul and Clownbuck, Oops, I didn't know you picked that one already.

I really appreciate the feed back. I haven't bought any shares because of the
upcoming ruling, and the unfavorable industry fundamentals. I will read a few
of the books that the value investing folks recommended, then try to find
another value play to present and try to avoid duplicating picks. Hopefully, I
will refine my analysis further.

Someone mentioned biotech stocks earlier. There is a biotech company i really
like because it has the best potential treatment for my condition. They are in
phase one clinical trials now. I am certain they will pass that trial. I have
some background in medical biology, so I understand some of the science behind
the treatment. It is possible I will be a participant in the Phase two trials.
I own shares of the company, so that may disqualify me. At least, I will be one
of the first to receive treatment once available for the market. If this
treatment works well it will open a $60 Billion market (at least). They will
not be in direct competition with major pharma. If I am not bound by any
confidentiality agreements, I will share my personal experience with the
treatment. I will get a better sense of what is going on around mid 2012. I am
willing to share information, however, I felt this type of stock was
inappropriate for this thread. It is too speculative. If it is okay to suggest
speculative a stock from time to time, let me know and I will post the company
name for the member's scrutiny The company could be a MAJOR multi-bagger.
However, I could be deluding myself with a personal hope for a cure.

Re: Southern Union Co. (SUG)

Energy Transfer to Buy Southern Union for $5.7 Billion to Counter Williams
By Mike Lee - Jul 19, 2011 1:12 PM PT

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-19/energy-transfer-equity-raises-its-offe
-for-southern-union-to-5-7-billion.html

From the article:"...Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE) agreed to buy Southern
Union Co. (SUG) for about $5.7 billion, its second effort to outbid Williams
Cos. and complete the biggest purchase of a pipeline operator this year.

The proposal values the company at about $44.25 a share, redeemable in cash or
stock, according to a statement today from Dallas-based Energy Transfer and
Southern Union. It’s a 57 percent premium over Southern Union’s closing price
on June 15, the day before the companies first announced the takeover.

“Our ability to be creative with our structure has improved the tax efficiency,
therefore allowing us to increase our price,” Energy Transfer Chairman Kelcy
Warren said in the statement.

Williams and Energy Transfer are vying for Houston-based Southern Union’s
15,000 miles (24,000 kilometers) of natural-gas pipelines, which can connect
new fields in Texas and Oklahoma to markets in the U.S. Midwest and Florida.
..."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WMB's previous offer is all cash and appears a safer bet than ETE's raised bid.
This should help raise the value of all those other pipeline companies like EP,
SEP and many others discussed here over the last year.

>>Can you explain how a bank classifies a performing loan to a nonperforming
status? Are there industry (or accounting) regulations that a U.S. bank must
follow in classifying the loan status (ie mortgage payments are in the rears by
90 days or more is nonperforming)?<<

I am not sure what a performing loan to a nonperforming status is. A loan is
either performing, delinquent (30-89days) or non-performing (more than 90 days
late). Each bank has to classify every loan into one of the 3 buckets. A bank
is supposed to have enough reserves to cover losses from existing delinquent
and non-performing loans. it is simple but the devil is in the details. The
above is all mandated by the FDIC and the information is accessible to everyone
for each bank doing business in the US, regardless whether it is public or
private:
The link below is the most important tool for bank investors in the US, imo:
http://www3.fdic.gov/idasp/main.asp

>>What adjustments do the banks make (if any) for their performing loans where
the collateralized assets decrease in value (based off their initial
appraisal)? Many of the loans done 24-36 months ago s/b be valued 30% less
because of a falling real estate market values. Do the banks set aside possible
loan loss capital because of falling real estate values. Or do they make loan
loss adjustments only when these loans become nonperforming?<<

Banks classify performing loans into different buckets as well but most don't
publish the info. Below is an example of a bank that does so (P.11, UVSP):
http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/102212/000095012311047892/c16583e10vq.htm

Again the reserves are supposed to cover all known losses but obviously there
is a lot of wiggle room there.

>>Finally, are there any industry (and/or government) regulations as to how
much leverage a bank can utilize in their business ? Is it 10:1, 20:1 or even
30:1 or is it at the discretion of the bank(s) and the type of
operation/venture (ie derivatives, hedging, simple home loans) they operate. Is
the recent stress test guidelines supposed to control excess leverage? Is this
an easy number for me (or any other investor) to calculate for each bank?<<

Yes there are rules. They differ from country to country. These are called Tie
ratios (tangible equity ratio is not important although it is sometimes used),
since assets are graded based on riskyness. SOo the risk weigthed asses are
always less than the total assets of a banks. The new rule is going to be Basel
III, which is tougher than Basel I and of course Basel II( a total joke).

Megabanks follow the same standards in principle than the smalltown bank with
one or two offices. of course they got a much more complex business that cannot
easily be decribed by just a few numbers.

I actually think that the new BAC CEO is doing a good job- he seems to know his
numbers and the balance sheet impact of certain changes by memory, which tells
me that he seems to be able to run BAC efficiently. He has to play a tough hand
but as far as I can tell, he is doing to well.

http://seekingalpha.com/article/280317-bank-of-america-s-ceo-discusses-q2-2011-

I am inclined to add to my still small and loosing position. overall, I have
done much better with small bank stocks than with large one. As for splitting
up BAC, I tend to agree with you and I think it would be good for shareholders.
I don't think it is going to happen - the new requirement to add an additional
capital buffer of up to 2.5% is the next best solution.

re WHR - I agree with Ami that WHR cash flow seems to be lacking. I have a hard
time seeing where the earnings for the last 3 years went - they didn't buy any
business, they did not buy back any shares and the business didn't grow much,
even in South America, where they make 60%+ of their profits (which was
surprising to me).Capex is pretty heavy for a stable businesss without growth,
imo.

I would have guessed that they can achieve volume growth in South America's
booming economy but they do not - which must mean that they loose market share
there. My guess is the Koreans are eating their lunch, at least that is what
they do in the US, where the Koreans are doing a terrific job capturing market
share in appliances. I'll pass on WHR even though it does look cheap based on

That's a 12.5% increase in the number of shares. Once the shares are issued and

It's not so much an investing book as profiles of successful traders/investors.
I found it very useful to help me generate new ideas. It's very easy to become
ideological when investing - and it's useful to see all the varied approaches

when looking at companies that have yet to hit their stride and are climbing

All US banks will be downgraded, regardless of the debt ceiling or not. This
was already communicated from the rating agencies a while ago. The reason being
that implied support by the US government in case of a failure may not be
forthcoming any more in the future. BAC will receive the biggest debt downgrade
- I believe it's 4 notches. FWIW, I do not think it matter much for

Dilution might be looked at differently. They are issuing shares with stock
below current stated book value. So maybe current stockholders see more
dilution; assets per share though -- that's not being diluted. (Somebody
correct me if that's wrong.)

selling down my Itochu 8001.T position @891.6Yen to 50% of my peak holdings. it
still a 5% bet at this point. Itochu has done very well since the tsunami. They
have increased they coal business during the last few years and gained access
to more supply since the tsunami hit - obviously betting on increased demand
for power plants. They plan on paying a 30 Yen dividend this year.I feel it's
still a good hold. Still the increased debt due to the huge investment program
worries me a little.

Itochu. Not sure what you are saying. Itochu is now reduced to 5% of your
portfolio? You're selling at 891, and before that there was a sale at 850? I
assume you're taking some short-term trading gains, although you believe the
stock is a "still a good hold".
Congrats to you on this one that was successful for you and others here you

Paul, yes I run up Itochu to about 8% of my portfolio at the peak I bought most
of my shares at 700Yen on 3/15. I have now sold half and I still a 5% position
currently, due to appreciation. I am taking larger swings with individual
positions when I feel confident.

I think most of the risk is macro (at least with my picks) not with individual

my 2 cents on gold and silver.

I recently looked up silver mining stocks. Some in Canada, some here, most
elsewhere. None paying a dividend. If they are not paying a dividend at present
prices, when would they?

In looking at "proven reserves", these usually expand as the mine is processed,
because as they dig they find other veins. Mines last longer than their
indicated lives.

It seems that the gold and silver stocks are priced on the assumption that
future prices are dropping. Most feasibility studies assume a much lower price
for gold and silver.

If one just thinks the price is going up, the ETF's are a good way to play it:
GLD and SLV.

I am watching a few stocks, including TC and MSQ.v. Have not pulled the trigger
yet on any of these.

Yes, agree with you there Clownbuck, though I did not realise that BAC could
possibly receive 4 notches downgrade! If that happens I can imagine the
institutional investors dumping BAC fixed income instruments due to their
(typical) investment guidelines of having to hold A grade or better. Maybe
there's a buying opportunity there but I have not invested in fixed income
instruments before so would take a lot of research.

Two things I like about BK are:
1) Together with JPM they have the biggest share of the repo market in the US
2) BK has the biggest custodial business in the world, and IMO is a relatively
safe, fee income earner

Between JPM and BK, I prefer BK as I get the impression that the investment
banking side of JPM does increase its risk profile

Yes, I have. FLU.VI is by far the cheapest I can find, albeit with some
issues.. They do have an ADR VIAAY.PK but I trade directly in Europe via
Interactive Brokers. The advantage of the latter is much better liquidity and I
am currently hedged, since I am short the purchase amount of Euro's. In this

GOV. I also sold shares at $27+ earlier in the month, around 25% of my
holdings. Yep, based on PE. (paul: "Okay, I'll agree stock may be overpriced if
traded on p/e. Does it trade on p/e though? Or maybe more on dividend
yield...") And I kept the rest because of yield. So, with paul, I bought quite
a few GOV back today.

UNP. I bought UNP yesterday, and I normally don't do this, but I sold 1/2 today
after a nice pop. I needed the $$ for GOV. I think UNP is a fair holding now,
so keeping the rest.

And sold a very little OFC, since i overweighted it recently. GOV now seems
like a better deal, equal PE, higher yield, lower debt. My $GOV = $OFC now.

Hi EKS. Some of my utility stocks are interwoven with pipeline businesses. This
tactic you mentioned - "Any forward PE under 13 becomes a Buy candidate and
over 15 is a Sell candidate" - I find does appeal to me. Even though it does
seem a little bit like pure trading.

Anyway, following your 15-13 tactic, I've sold more CNP, and look to buy more
AGL, I'm tired of chasing it up, so I just put in a market order for a tiny few
more AGL shares. I'll add more AGL if/as AGL drops back.
===================================
Terrible day to buy stocks though (Dow up 150). Well, maybe except for Pepsico
(PEP), which I show as my biggest $ loser today:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pep&ql=1
Not sure what I'll do with this one, my choice being either to just hold or to
add a few more shares. Likely I'll just hold.
Stock is inexpensive on a number of metrics. Although as discussed here, may
almost be a value trap.

Hi Grommit -

Re: Government Properties Income Trust (GOV)

Their is still the dilution factor that 6.5 million shares produces with a 40
million share base. That represents a 16.5% dilution. However as you say, their
LT debt is low and depending how they use the $164 million of new capital, GOV
could be a better buy now than it was earlier this month.

I think the value proposition can be stated like this: Is the capital raised
from issuing more shares (and resulting in the stock dilution) produce a better
return (and margin of safety) than equivalent borrowing off the company's
credit facility. If management is smart, they have a basket full of new
properties bought on the cheap that generate a sufficient cash flow to make the
transaction a net positive to the company.

From a recent article:"...Government Properties has been expanding its
portfolio of properties through big-ticket acquisitions. In May, it paid $114
million for a New York City building leased to the United Nations. Last summer,
it purchased 15 properties from another commercial landlord for $231
million....".

=======================================================================

The wild card in the mix is that CommonWealth Reit (NYSE: CWH ) owns 25% of the
outstanding shares (it is rumored that the extra 1.5 million shares in the
recent offering was due to CWH selling a portion of their holdings). At some
point CWH may want to sell all of their shares as their main business needs the
capital.

Is their any chance that GOV could be packaging itself up for a pending private
placement leverage buy out? That would allow CWH to sell it's 25% interest in
the company at a much higher price than selling "at the market".? Is GOV worth
more to a a leverage buy out prospect than currently structured. A $30.00/share
- $35.00/share was discussed in a recent blog posting I read.

I just do not see the screaming Value proposition and by some measure GOV is
overvalued by as much as 7% if priced by Mr Market in May 2011 (w/ their $114
Million property purchases) or even early last summer 2010 ( w/ their $231
million buys).

Therefore, I can see more value since the company has less debt and their
leverage profile is low compared to its peers, they operate in a segment where
their lessees pay their rent better (however in CA you may get IOU vouchers),
and in the current environment there may be more lease back deals w/ FED &
State municipalities which could significantly increase cash flow for the
company.

Do you see any compelling positive argument that the company is packaging
itself up for a private party leverage buy out? If so, to the right group GOV
could be worth 30% more from today's price of $25.20/share.

Thank you for the book recommendations and advise. I am working through some

intelligent investor however, I heard Security Analysis is a good book. Did
anyone read the new edition? Opinions?

I am getting the sense that mastery of an industry or specialized knowledge of
some sort is a good thing to develop. A problem I see ahead, for myself, is
-failing to screen companies/market correctly. In other words, developing the
wisdom to look at the right places for the best opportunities.

I don't know much about Mr Buffets techniques, so I ordered Buffetology and the

Many thanks for this Paul. Good ideas to start from, although imo with
infrastructure assets like these they firstly have to have good, steady yields
and one must be willing to hold them for more than the 3-5 years for a typical

A couple of the biggest risks i find with these stocks is that they're usually
accompanied with heavy levels of debt, and changes in regulations (that would

Yeah, I will.

And like said earlier it is nothing like collecting lottery tickets, it is
about understanding uncertainty and studying a company's exposure to very big
growth: Black Swans.

This is value investing, you just didn't know about it until I told you.

My strategy is about studying a company on several levels, some of the
important ones:

1. The approach to randomness
2. The scalability of growth

1.) The approach to randomness is a very wide subject, but I will give you some
examples:
a)Overspecialization reduces exposure to Positive Black Swans, on the other
side it might increase exposure to Negative Black Swans.

b) Having a research and development facility increases exposure to Positive
Black Swans, here the management style of the research/development/innovation
facility can influence the exposure.

One very important factor here is management style.

2.) The scalability of growth, some examples:
a) A barbershop isn't expected to take over the biggest share in the market no
matter what good service it provides. The barber's revenues are stable and not
expected to make very big growth comparing to competition.
b) Internet companies are great example of Positive Black Swan businesses, i.e.
Google dominates the internet search (for now), this is very unstable market on
both ends: the small may grow fast, and the big may fall fast.

Here I study the type of business the company is involved in, the type of
products...etc
I also try to answer questions like the following:
The fast growth of sales will it be held down but the investment limits? As in
the internet business any company may be the next one to dominate a given
market while having the increase of investments very small comparing to the
increase in sales.

As I said in the first post I am not very good at presentations, but I can
answer questions or provocative attitudes.

P.S.: can any admin give me the upgrade? As I have some private messages that I
can't answer with my current account status.

Thanks !

Callon Petroleum Company Common (NYSE: CPE) - Closed position
Triangle Petroleum Corporation (AMEX: TPLM) - Closed position

A few changes to my E&P basket. The basket is now composed of 16 stocks. With

and TPLM (2.15% of basket) for a 3.07% gain. The proceeds were invested into
LEI (which now makes up 7% of my E&P basket).

LEI owns parcels (approx 4,400 acres) located in the Eagle Ford shale region
contiguous to Petrohawk Energy's land recently purchased by BHP for $22,000 per
acre.

Lucas is anticipating increasing operated gross production this year due to a
new drilling program that includes the Rainey Unit No.1H well currently
drilling as a new horizontal well in the Austin Chalk formation.

The company is planning at least three new Austin Chalk horizontal wells, and
three new Austin Chalk laterals from old well bores. The outside operated Eagle
Ford program is anticipated to add another two to three wells.

My only other sale in my E&P basket were some shares of LEI on 3/2/2011 for
$3.66/share when the stock spiked up on news of a Joint Venture agreement with
Marathon Oil (East Texas) LP for the development of the Eagle Ford and Buda

"Mr Womack"

I used to clip and keep articles. I've got notebooks full. Some articles have
become classics, almost collectible: Buffett quoted in Forbes in '74 for
example, something about stocks being so cheap and available for the taking
that he felt like "an oversexed guy in a harem". (apparently Bowdlerized by
Forbes, we learn years later -g-)

I recommend "Mr Womack". I'd guess in my collection, this 1978 John Train story
is the article I most remember, and my favorite. I go back to it every few
years, and I believe I have mentioned "Mr. Womack" here too. I'll just pull the
article up from the internet now and put it up here. Imo, if anyone wants to
read about value investing, if anyone wants to claim they are a well-read value
aficionado, they ought to be able to say, yes, they read about Mr. Womack.
(jmo, of course)

http://dir.rbcinvestments.com//pictures/account-geoff.guy/womack%20article.pdf
============================================================
How Mr. Womack Made A Killing
By John Train, Fortune Magazine, 1978

Everybody who finally learns how to make money in the stock market learns in
his own way.
I like this tale of his own personal enlightenment sent in by reader Melvid
Hogan, of Houston:
“Right after I was discharged from the Army at the close of World War II and
went into the drilling-rig building business, on the side (and at first as a
hobby) I began buying and selling stocks. At the end of each year I always had
a net loss. I tried every approach I would read or hear about: technical,
fundamental and combinations of all these…
but somehow I always ended up with a loss.
It may sound impossible that even a blind man would have lost money in the
rally of 1958 – but I did. In my in-and out trading and smart switches I lost a
lot of money.
But one day in 1961 when, discouraged and frustrated, I was in the Merrill
Lynch office in Houston, a senior account executive, sitting at a front desk,
whom I knew, observed the frown on my face that he had been seeing for so
manyyears and motioned me over to his desk..“Would you like to see a man”, he
asked wearily, “who has never lost money in the stock market?”

The broker looked up at me, waiting.
“Never had a loss?” I stammered.
“Never had a loss on balance”, the broker drawled, “and I have handled his
account for near 40 years.” Then the broker gestured to a hulking man dressed
in overalls who was sitting among the crowd of tape watchers.
“If you want to meet him, you’d better hurry”, the broker advised. “He only
comes in here once every few years except when he’s buying. He always hangs
around a few minutes to gawk at the tape. He’s a rice farmer and hog raiser
down in Baytown.”
I worked my way through the crowd to find a seat by the stranger in overalls. I
introduced myself, talked about rice farming and duck hunting for a while (I am
an avid duck hunter) and gradually worked the subject around to stocks.
The stranger, to my surprise was happy to talk about stocks. He pulled a sheet
of paper from his pocket with his list of stocks scrawled in pencil on it that
he had just finished selling, and let me look at it. I couldn’t believe my
eyes! The man had made over 50% long-term capital-gain profits on the whole
group. One stock in the group of 30 stocks had been shot off the board, but
others had gone up 100%, 200% and even 500%.
He explained his technique, which was ultimate in simplicity. When during a
bear market he would read in the papers that the market was down to new lows,
and the experts were predicting that it was sure to drop another 200 points in
the Dow, the farmer would look through a Standard & Poor’s Stock Guide and
select around 30 stocks that had fallen in
price below $10 - solid, profit-making, unheard-of, little companies (pecan
growers, home furnishings, etc) and paid dividends. He would come to Houston
and buy a $25,000 package of them.
And then, one, two, three or four years later, when the stock market was
bubbling and the prophets were talking about the Dow hitting 1500, he would
come to town and sell his whole package. It was as simple as that.
During the subsequent years as I cultivated Mr. Womack (and hunted ducks on his
rice fields) until his death, I learned much of his investing philosophy.
He equated buying stocks with buying a truckload of pigs. The lower he could
buy the pigs, when the pork market was depressed, the more profit he would make
when the next seller’s market would come along. He claimed that he would rather
buy stocks under such conditions than pigs because pigs did not pay a dividend.
You must feed pigs.
He took a “farming” approach to the stock market in general. In rice farming,
there is a planting season and a harvest season; in his stock purchases and
sales he strictly observed the seasons. Mr. Womack never seemed to buy a stock
at its bottom or sell it at its top. He seemed happy to buy or sell in the
bottom or top range of its fluctuations. He had no
regard whatsoever for the old clich&#233; – Never Send Good Money After Bad –
when he was buying. For example, when the bottom fell out of the bottom in the
market of 1970, he added another $25,000 to his previous bargain-price
positions and made a virtual killing on the whole package.
I suppose that a modern stock market technician could have found a lot of
alphas, betas, contrary opinions and other theories in Mr. Womack’s simple
approach to buying and selling stocks. But none that I know put the emphasis on
“buy price” that he did.
I realize that many things determine if a stock is a wise buy. But I have
learned that during a depressed stock market, if you can get a cost position in
a stock’s bottom price range it will forgive a multitude of misjudgments later.
During a market rise, you can sell too soon and make a profit, or sell on the
way down and still make a profit. So, with so many profit probabilities in your
favor, the best cost price possible is worth waiting for.
Knowing this is always comforting during a depressed market, when a ‘chartist’
looks at you with alarm after you buy on his latest “sell signal”.
In sum, Mr. Womack didn’t make anything complicated out of the stock market. He
taught me that you can’t be buying stocks every day, week or month of the year
and make a profit, any more than you could plant rice every day, week or month
and make a crop. He changed my investing lifestyle and I have made a profit
ever since.

Re: El Paso Corporation Common Stoc(NYSE: EP) - acquired @$7.60 9/03 - peeled
off a few shares
Marine Harvest ASA (MNHVF.PK) - added to position.

Peeled off some EP shares to buy Marine Harvest ASA (MNHVF.PK). This was one of
those long term holds (almost 8 years) that netted 165% return or about 20% per
year. It also paid a small dividend during the period.

Marine Harvest is a speculative Buy for me and I am adding to an already losing
position. You generally want to buy this when you think salmon prices are at
their low for the cycle. This one may not be classified as a true "VALUE" stock
but their operation is very efficient. Net earnings is driven by the price of
the commodity and that price (for me) is coming into value range again.

A five year chart of salmon prices shows that current prices are now close to
their five year average of $5.50/Kilo. The July Fish (salmon), Farm Bred
Norwegian Salmon, export price, US Dollars per Kilogram is just under
$6.00/kilo.

I may be a bit early but the position is small and the stock is off more than
50% from my earlier buy.

According to the Womack article that Paul Sr. posted, <u>"...The lower he could
buy the pigs, when the pork market was depressed, the more profit he would make
when the next seller’s market would come along...."</u> . My timing may be off
a bit but salmon prices are pretty depressed now so I bought a few.

I am not ready to load up the truck on this one yet, but if salmon prices get
into the low $4.00/kilo range, I may double up my current position.

ASTC,

With the recent drop to 0.94, I decided to look more closely at this one and
follow up with MikeS97707.

MikeS97707, any reason why the stock is down recently? Blues about the end of
the space shuttle mission? Worries about possible cuts in government spending?
Specific company news I don't know about?

According to what I see in the filing, ASO made only $1,107 mil for the 9
months ended Mar 31, 2011, which is about $0.06 per share not $0.35 per share.
My estimate for ASO profit for the 12 months ended Mar 31, 2011 is actually a
little worse.

So I am assuming you are using the June 30, 2010 to get the 0.35/share in
earnings for ASO? If so, why is that more representative than the trailing
twelve months, particularly if you are using it as a base 2012 earnings number
to which you are going to add the earnings from the latest project???

Cash per share is nice, but they owe almost that much in a term note payable,
so net cash is not that great.

The stock still seems like a cheap option on the possibility they can make
something out of their other business, but it seems to me that your numbers are
overly optimistic unless I am missing something.

Thanks,
MC
