re: REF accounting. Bob. Looks to me that from '97 on, shares outstanding are
roughly the same and so is equity. So book value hasn't changed. It does look
like deferred income taxes have come down each year -- that might be the debt
you mention that's being paid down. If so, that amount is getting close to
being paid off. So subsequent earnings then might be used for other corporate
purposes. That could be a positive for the company ---IF that's where the
earnings have been going in past.

Regarding CRED....

When I looked at the data at Yahoo Profile, all indications were that this
might be interesting. However, when I did a quick cash flow analysis for the
last 4 reported quarters, I get a negative free cash flow if I make no
adjustments to the amount of Capex investments (which, not knowing anything
about the industry, I'm inclined not to adjust). If I do say that the Capex of
1.278M for the quarter ended 10/00 was too high for the average of about
.65M/QTR and adjust cash flow accordingly, I still get that the company is
overvalued for me at these prices.

No doubt this may be a good investment opportunity for some, and I appreciate
you bringing it up for review. I'm just looking for really great values as
defined by being below either NetNet or throwing off cash in excess of
reasonable price for that cash flow.

Thanks again,

Timba

TimbaBear,

I wonder if you (or anyone else) could take a look at the following company.

International Aircraft investors (IAIS), trading at
around $1.60, owns and leases a fleet of 15 airliners
to smaller airlines. It has fallen hugely over the past
few months due to fears of contraction in the
industry.

It has been profitable over the past 5 years with an
average income of 30 cents a share. Moreover, as I
understand it the planes are depreciated at 7% while
the real world rate is closer to 5%. This difference of 2
percentage points equals 4.5 million, almost the market
cap of the company.

Tangible book is about $10 a share but that may be
understated for the same reason as above.

There has also been insider buying (post 9/11) by 3
different people at 2-3 times todays prices (and
already 66% insider owned):

http://biz.yahoo.com/t/i/iais.html

Risks are the continuance of demand for used airliners
and the very high amount of debt, though that is being paid
off by 5 million a quarter. The book value is highly
leveraged to the value of their fleet, so that if that
value was reduced greatly the book value would vanish.

Being so small now it is also fairly illiquid, so much
so that with some moderate buying in late December I
now hold close to 1% of the float.

I would not invest any money you could not afford to
lose - the stock is basically a call option with no
expiration. Still the risk/reward looks favorable to
me.

IAIS....

This one is a tough one!

From a liquidation standpoint, I'd stay away because they have a NetNet value
of MINUS $12.

However....there is more than one way to calculate value and my most favorite
way is free cash flow generated vs. the cost for me to own that free cash flow.

IAIS has a lot fo free cash flow....about $.78/share last year.

Questions for me are: 1).What happens if their debt gets downgraded? Their
interest coverage ratio isn't that great, while their amount of debt is huge.
2). What impact does 9/11 have on their brand of operation? Do airlines enter
into the leasing business as well to recover money from planes they're no
longer flying? I don't know the industry, maybe you could give some insight?
3). Paying down the debt at the rate of $4.6M/QTR is a good use of cash flow,
but at that rate it would still take them 13 years to pay off existing debt,
what is the expected productive remaining lifespan of their fleet?

I have some other thoughts on this, but have been called to dinner!

Share some of your thoughts with me if you will.

TimbaBear,

Yes, debt is the big risk here. Higher interest rates or some trouble with
operations would put the business in a possibly terminal decline. Even then
though, there's a possibility someone could buy the aircraft for close to book
(or even more as I said earlier).

I suspect 9/11 is a double-edged sword for them. If one of their airlines goes
belly up, they're involved in costly repossesion but on the other hand when
airlines are looking to save money, leasing used airplanes rather than buying
new begins to look attractive, sort of like pawn stores in a recession. The
insiders certainly seem to think so and they also have a buyback in operation.

To be honest I don't know the industry any better than you (and possibly worse)
but I do see that the risk is no more than the stock price while the reward is
up to $10 or even more.I like these call option microcaps but that's just a
personal preference.

For some more background, here's an old (2000) newspaper report. Lieblong by
the way is one of the insiders now buying:

DAVID SMITH
ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT-GAZETTE

Alex Lieblong, president of Lieblong & Associates Inc. in Little Rock, and his
investment fund, Key Colony Fund, have acquired more than 5 percent
interest in a small California aircraft leasing company.
Since late December, Lieblong, Key Colony Fund, Lieblong Transport Inc.
and Paul Spann, senior vice president at Lieblong & Associates, acquired
239,700 shares of International Aircraft Investors Inc. of Torrance, Calif.,
for
almost $1.6 million. Lieblong Transport is a small company that owns
Lieblong's private airplane.
The stock, representing 5.6 percent of the company, was bought at prices
ranging from $5.69 to $6.75 a share, according to a filing last month with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. International Aircraft Investors closed
at $6 a share Thursday on the Nasdaq market.
Lieblong, renowned for his investment savvy, was named the country's top
stockbroker by Town and Country magazine in the early 1990s while
working for PaineWebber Inc. in Little Rock.
International Aircraft Investors acquires used, single-aisle jets for lease and
sale to domestic and foreign airlines. It finances the purchase of the
airplanes
with a balloon payment due near the end of the lease and then renegotiates the
lease.
It has 16 aircraft on lease to 12 airlines, including Southwest Airlines, Delta
Air Lines Inc. and Trans World Airlines Inc.
International Aircraft has only six employees, but generates annual revenue
of about $40 million and net income of $3.6 million. What attracted Lieblong
to the company is its cash flow of about $22 million.
"You can make the argument that it has a market cap of $25 million and a
cash flow of $22 million, selling at about one times cash flow," Lieblong said.
"I buy on cash flow."
Lieblong consulted with the company's top executives over the past several
weeks and met the chairman and chief executive officer, William Lindsey, for
the first time last week in Florida. Lindsey, 61, is the former Western
Airlines
Inc. leasing director, Lieblong said.
Lieblong said he doesn't plan to seek a seat on International Aircraft's
board of directors. International Aircraft is not one of the larger investments
in
Key Colony Fund, Lieblong said, but it is "not insignificant."

I think that the danger in leasing companies is that they have accurately
estimated the residual value of the equipment. Unfortunately in banking my
first hand experience has been that leasing executives tend to inflate profits
and their bonuses by taking as much income up front as possible. then moving on
to greener pastures as new management comes in and takes the hit to earnings as
a one time accounting charge to more accurately reflect the true market values.
My guess is that the market for used aircraft is lower than it was pre 9/11.

I'm coming up with $13+ per share for SOFN. I can't help it if they're trading
at $2.

- SOFN's (Softnet's) true cash position - per their 10K just filed on 12/28/01
- is over $3/share:

-total curr assets: $79.5 mill
- restricted cash & other non-curr assets: $8 mill
- total liabil: $11 mill
- shs o/s: 25.2 mill
- therefore: $76.5 mill/25.2 = $3.04/share

- then there's the $400 mill in loss carry-forwards; which at 40% federeal is
equivalent to $160 mill; divided by 25.2 mill shs is $6.35/share

- then you have the broadband satellite segment which appears to be doing very
well & can hopefully fetch $100 mill; which is $4 share

- then you have certain intangibles, like the fact that SOFN is NASDAQ listed
company

- if you add up each of these, you get $3+6+4=$13+ intangibles

- so what is the real value we'll get? I don't know - but we'll have a clearer
idea by 3/31/02; & I'm willing to bet that today's $2 stock price will be
laughable

A point about the article you included in your post. It says, in part: "....The
stock, representing 5.6 percent of the company, was bought at prices ranging
from $5.69 to $6.75 a share...." and "...."I buy on cash flow."

Well, IAIS is selling at $1.67/share now and the article was reported to have
been written in 2000. That means his investment has lost 70% in that time
frame. If he has still held the investment, I'm not sure that I'd call that a
ringing endorsement of his acumen.

As far as the payment of $4.6M/QTR against long term debt....this may not be as
much of a good decision as a necessity. I haven't looked at the annual report,
just the numbers from the financial statements, but if I take $253M in debt and
amortize it over ten years, the principal portion of the payment would be 15.7M
(approx), so a little difference in rate or term would bring that in line with
what they are actually paying. No discretion, just meeting the terms of the
loans.

When I invest these days, I like a margin of safety to back up my position.
With a huge (relative to stock price) negative Net worth, I have no margin of
safety here if my assumptions about cash flow take an unexpected hit.

While I see your point about the most I can lose being the cost of the stock
and the cost is only $1.67, I usually look at the percentages instead of the
dollar amounts. (i.e. I can lose 100% of my investment, whatever the dollar
amount). After all, Mr. Lieblong could only lose $5.69/share when he bought,
but if he held until now, he is down 70%.

I thank you for bringing this company to my attention because it is an
interesting situation and history.

Hi Bob. Yes they are. And some small companies

are a lot better than others in all areas of disclosure. This isn't always due
to any ulterior motive to withhold information or mislead. Sm caps have such
small staffs that investor relations can even piggy backed other
responsibilities for a single employee.

To be honest, find myself reading between the lines in some cases. But after
what we've seen happen with large cap tech stocks in recent years, the need to
do that is proving to be increasingly important no matter what size company

Timba. Yes Capex has to be included.

It's one of the most important considerations with energy stocks. Oil and Gas
is one of the most capital intensive industries.

Only have a partial position in CRED myself due, in part, to the low volume. In
fact, that's what prompted me to shy away from PHOC. Although it's somewhat
interesting, vol is so low, it's an easy target for a small group of traders to
manipulate. Have seen that happen many times in companies with illiquid markets
for their shares.

Have you looked at HOFF. Some good value parameters there and it's making money
due to the fundamentals driving energy markets in the current environment.

FLM: I've been a holder of FLM since before their big deal to be prime

fortunes of KM - at least as far as KM stock price. That was good when KM stock
was moving up last year, not so good now. Rather than hold all my FLM stock as
it's dropped 50% from highs, I've sold some - hoping to buy it back at even
lower prices. I presume FLM is not being pushed into survival mode with

NSI. -g- I will assume this discussion is about NSI and not a collateral
skirmish among people of the SUNW wars of '96 onward, so I will contribute my
NSI opinion:

From what I understand, company is nearly debt-free. It plans to have an
"initial" dividend at an annual rate of .04. Expected '02 earnings, per
company, if I remember correctly, .15-20. Stock is selling at @$2.11.

It's those "other liabilities" related to the dread word ASBESTOS.

"During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2001, the Company was served with
approximately 30,000 claims and settled approximately 16,000 claims for an for
an average of approximately $1,035 per claim..."

At this point, if someone hasn't just said, "fuhgeddaboutit" and moved on to
another stock, I will add:

It appears to me that there may be about 22,000 open pending claims as of Oct.
2001. There's an estimated $113M accrual liability for asbestos claims. There's
a $95M accrual (or liability offset) somewhere in the balance sheet for $$ that
NSI expects to get from insurers for claims paid and "pending and future claims
to be paid through 2004".

I tried to see at what price the management was granted NSI options. I couldn't
find that info. Looks like past options were prorated based on stock price on
first trading day. Not sure.
Looks like Mr. Hattox, CFO, got a nice deal. Apparently his bosses agreed with
the "independent compensation consultant" who said his 122,000 options of past
couple of years were worth "by the Black-Scholes value at the time of the
exchange election" at about $8. So the agreeable Mr. Hattox cancelled those
options in exchange for the cash -- about $988,000. An astute decision! Since
the stock actually reached its high of $2.68 on its first trading day, and it's
been mostly downhill from there, I guess Mr Hattox has gotta love Black-Scholes
and "independent compensation consultants" !!

------------------------
NSI has had a very good record for increases in income, earnings per share, and
dividends. Alas, that all seems to be very, very much in the past.

Long: Investing in restaurant stocks - where we are, where we might be going.

I've noticed that several restaurant stocks mentioned here have done very well
lately, and in general, the sector seems to be up.

There are several questions that I have:
Will those restaurant stocks that have been performing well continue to perform
well?

Will those restaurant stocks that have under-performed get an upward
re-evaluation --dragged up by the sector that apparently now is in investors'
favor?

Are the valuations sustainable or will restaurant stocks (-g-especially the
ones I own or will buy) come down once again?

Perhaps these questions are unanswerable with any accuracy. We know how to
evaluate restaurant stocks -some key metrics are comparable store sales, p/e
compared to growth, per-unit ROI, capacity increases, and so on. (Not that this
information is easily available.) The stocks of the good companies maybe are
already near highs, so their good future may already be reflected in their
stocks' prices.

Following are what I believe thread posters here have bought and may still own.
(I may have old data, I may have forgot somebody, I may be wrong in other ways.
I'm just trying to get an overall picture since we've got value investors who
have bought value stocks. I'm not trying to intentionally exclude anybody or
judge anybody or hold anybody accountable for what they may or may not have
said or done 0-2 year's ago.)

Now I am going to classify a stock arbitrarily as either
being very close to its high (in its SI-reported 52-week range)
close to its low, or
within range/indeterminable/other

(aside: other people will likely have different ideas or criteria as to what
constitutes "very close to its high" or "close to its low".)

I find 11 of 14 stocks at or near highs, two in midrange (PZXI & JBX) and only
one (STRZ) near lows. (Krispy Kreme, the 15th stock, being my attempt at
humor.)

I suspect that almost all thread posters above prefer to buy low and sell high,
so I am assuming most of these folks have done very well with their restaurant
investments. (Aside: I included a Dale Baker pick here. It was mentioned on his
thread, not here. Imo, Dale sometimes is more willing to buy a stock as it's
breaking to highs than some of the other posters mentioned above. That's only
imo, from my casual observation.)

I've taken the restaurant stocks mentioned by Francois Tremblay on another SI
thread and created the following portfolio:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/portfolio/detail.gsp?pid=9292469

Dang. Changing from an SI watch list to an SI portfolio eliminates the yearly
highs and lows! And I can't get back to my watch list. Very sorry!!

Of the 85 stocks on my list, I characterize 34 as being neither near their
highs nor at their lows (for that SI 52-week range). I characterize 14 that are
near their yearly lows. And there are 37 stocks near their annual high.

37/85 = about 43% of the stocks in the restaurant sector are at their highs vs.
about 14/85 = 16% at their lows. To me that does give some indication of how
in-favor this sector is. Roughly speaking, if somebody randomly chose a stock
in the sector within the last 52 weeks, the chances are about 43% that the
stock would now be at its high. My agglomerating the posters' picks here show
that the thread's posters picked 11 highs of 14 selections or 78%. We could
have expected 6 out of 14 (ie. 43%) on average; the guys here got eleven or
five more than would be expected. I conclude there was good stock picking on a
sector where the opportunities were rife and sweet. (Easy to say now. -g-).

Lot of very dinky restaurant stocks in the 85 list. Maybe if I looked at the
stocks and the picks and the record by just large capitalization stocks (size),
I might find the number of highs and lows comparatively different. Thread
posters here seemed to have a propensity for picking large caps. Perhaps for a
margin of safety. (?)

From now, whereto?

For me, given that I prefer to buy 'em when they're low, and the ones that are
up look too expensive for me, I'll hold the restaurant stocks I've got but look
now at the 14 restaurant stocks that seem to be at their lows. Being quite
aware that if a stock in a hot or up sector hasn't moved, there could be very,
very good reasons why investors are shunning it. And if it ain't up now in a
favorable market for restaurant stocks, it may be a long, long time (if ever)
before it moves up.

Here's my list of 14:

but do have some effective tools for timing short/intermediate to intermediate
holding periods pretty well.(1-7 months) And it's greatly increased my returns
vs just buy and hold everything LT.

My ST trades are usually failed longer holding periods that I was stopped out
of for a small gain or small loss.

But, yes patience - when applied in the right circumstances - is very valuable.

Best of all is being in the situations were the fundamentals have improved more
than expected. Then then I'll shift an Intermediate trade to a Long Term
holding period.

re: restaurant business
the restaurant business is so competitive that I wouldn't want to go with
smallcaps unless they were very low P/E (<=7) or P/CF or had great growth
prospects. I don't know any of the names you listed so I can't judge their true
growth prospects. The largecaps can at least accrue some advantage from brand

I didn't think you'd have time for me. Accountability isn't something you wish
to answer to.

You're quick to let people think you've made lots of money and you're an
investment PRO. Yet your record is dismal!You're quick to tell people you
worked for a major Wall Street broker. You're quick to give advice to people on
how to invest and you're quick to come back with "I told you so's" when you're
correct.

Hence, this opens you up to those of us who disagree with your calls. This
opens you up to check your credibility. I can post links to many calls that you
simply blew. MANY! Yet you want to wave it off as though nothing happened.

That's OK with me. Wave it off. It doesn't change the fact that you have made
more poor calls than good and I think people should know your record if they
wish to take your advice.

It isn't attention I'm looking for Mr Patch, I'd just like you to explain how

Looked at TBL. Pass. P/sales too high for me.

Looked at RCKY. numbers look okay. Small, niche, risky(?)
-- Too late to buy? I have to defer to rjm2 who mentioned it here.

SKX might be the 3rd branded sneaker after Nike and Reebok.
Very popular now (not that I'm observant enough or knowledgeable enough to

Since you have mentioned SOFN so many times, I decided to look at it. I think
you will be lucky if you get $3.

1. Realistically, how much would you pay for a business currently doing less
than $4M sales and losing 4 times that amount. It isn't worth much. The growth
you refer to is entirely speculative, since they are spending resources far out
of line with sales. Almost any business could show growth if they give the
product away or throw huge resources at developing prospects.

2. The NOL's have small practical CURRENT (discounted) value, since the rules
as to the speed with which they can be taken mean that they have to be taken
evenly over 20+ years. Furthermore, I recall (but am not sure) that the amount
that an acquirer can take is limited to no more than the purchase price for the
company. The announcement that they are no longer concentrating on selling to a
company that can use them up proves this point of view.

3. By the time a deal gets done, another quarter or two will have passed and a
lot of severance may have to be paid. Overhead costs so out of line with sales
means that there are a lot of people an acquirer won't want on whom severance
will have to be paid. I would not be surprised if the company has no more than
around $60M cash at closing if someone buys them soon - and maybe $50M if they
get no offers and end up liquidating.

In sum, what should one pay for a business without much value plus maybe $60M
cash? $1.75 is not a big enough discount for me.

Jeffrey - I've profitably traded in & out of SOFN (Softnet)over the past year
for exactly the reasons you mentioned - it's real hard to value them as a going
concern - but as a company that's going to announce by 3/31/02 how they'll
liquidate - i think it's about as sure a bet as one can find - remember it's
still under $2/share

- now on to your issues:

"how much would you pay for a business currently doing less than $4M sales and
losing 4 times that amount" - they're not - you're looking at write downs -
they're losing about $800k/qtr

"The NOL's . . " - you may be right here - i know they can be used - but
exactly how - i don't know - I'd hate to think the rule are as ridiculous as
you mention - let's hope not - maybe someone who knows for sure can comment

"By the time a deal gets done . . . " nope - they're down to a skeletal crew -
so no big expenses down the line

- we'll see - but i think at under $2; with a minimum buyout of $5 IMHO; it's
worth holding for another 82 days

Paul Senior,

Have you taken a look @ AIF? Management has changed and refocused the business
model. I've bought for the following reasons:

1) insiders buying at current prices
2) ratios are strong (debt level; price/sales; etc.)
3) selling at less than 1/2 book value

The price/sales calculation can not accurately be interpreted due to the new
business model's focus upon selling marginal business lines. But the other
figures (from the 10k & 10q) and the fact that the current shares are in strong
hands -- has convinced me to take a position.

Management is focused upon achieving a goal of a positive cash flow -- in the
near future. The steps the company is taking to obtain this goal have indicated
-- to me at least -- that the people and resources are in place to turn the
company around.

re: Kmart

About ten years ago Rainman won the Oscar for best picture, and perhaps the
best line in the movie was "Kmart sucks". I'm 33 - anybody my age knows that in
middle school the biggest insult somebody could give you was "your Mom get that
at Kmart?". If you want to look up "negative brand equity" in the
dictionary...you'll find it in the K's.

KM has a greater than 50% chance of filing for bankruptcy in the next year in
my view, let me just say that. I've never owned it, but I consider it at every
new low and pass. I've never shorted it either. If you haven't read the sell
recommendation that broke the stock last week, tread carefully. It wasn't an "I
hate this stock, they're going to miss their numbers, sell it" report - the
kind you'd bet against - it was quite detailed, and quite thoughtful. A
sellside analyst can't say a company is going bankrupt, but this guy
essentially did just that without actually saying it. Their last conference
call actually made me laugh multiple times. For Kmart's turnaround plan to make
sense, some laws of finance have to be temporarily repealed. This is the kind
of place one would look for a turnaround, and I'm looking, but I just don't see
it. And they've got enough debt to eliminate any margin of safety.

Somebody must own this stock - there's a lot of shares out there. I'd be very
interested in a contrary view (I hate sounding like the consensus).

Hello James Clarke, long time no talk! Hope all has been well with you and
yours!

"....For Kmart's turnaround plan to make sense, some laws of finance have to be
temporarily repealed. This is the kind of place one would look for a
turnaround, and I'm looking, but I just don't see it. And they've got enough
debt to eliminate any margin of safety.
...."

It just doesn't seem like it would be that tough for good management to turn it
around. The problem is the "good management" part. If they had it, I suspect
they wouldn't have reached this point.

I know they have property that is in excess of their needs for the stores. We
have offices in a plaza that is owned by Kmart and adjacent to one of their
stores. If they unburdened themselves of some of the non-core assets, they
could use that to reduce debt. I don't know how much property they have, and am
too sick to try to decipher it right now, and too unmotivated (in all
likelihood) to do it later.

I didn't read the analyst report, but my own calculations on the 10Q data did
not give me anything positive to build on. So many times though, the people on
this thread have come at the analysis issues from different perspectives than I
would have, and have done so quite credibly, that I thought I'd ask.

Thank you all for keeping this thread an objective source of value (and
valuable) insights and discussion.

Nice moves recently in SPOR ($4) and RAGS (3.22, but hit $4 yesterday)

Both stocks are still selling at a fraction of book value. But I took the
opportunity to sell some of each.

SPOR sports a $7.38 book value with approx $6.93 in NCA and $3.17 in cash. And
I was buying shares back in sept at just over $2.

Of course, I trust the mob more than the management ! LOL

RAGS has a new CEO who bought 6000 shares in Dec at $2.75.

In other news, MAIN had an earnings warning and lost about 20%. I will be
adding to my position if it falls to the $3.50 range.

I remain concerned. The market has shrugged off 9/11 like it didnt happen even

Insiders became more bearish in Dec and I am just not finding the kind of

Allen, you're welcome.

I'm not looking to stir up trouble. I do think we have a right to know if a
poster is credible or not when they are telling people to buy stocks they own.

Isopatch has been here, telling people to buy the dips in the natural gas and
oil service stocks. Meanwhile, he's been selling out of many of his positions,
while telling everyone else to hold on for 4-8 weeks.

Most of his calls are atrocious! Back in October, he went on a "RANT" about
fading the PPT, in essence the markets.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=16580568

The day after his call, the NASDAQ went on to record what Financial Times
reported as the best seven week performance in over 20 years. It did this, the
day after his call!

3!Lc5!Ll14!Lj[$spx]]

Again, I'm not interested in pointing out the mistakes of others, we all make
them. However, in the case of Isopatch, he's running around the web, telling
people he's a professional investor and former Wall Street broker, inferring
that people should follow his advice and his results were dismal last year.

Sharing ideas, thoughts , opinions and analysis is one thing. Pumping your
positions while you're bailing out is another. Presenting yourself as market
savvy and having the results that Isopatch had last year is shameful at best.

Sorry for the intrusion, best to you and all the others here.

taken evenly over 20+ years. Furthermore, I recall (but am not sure) that the

for the company>> Would it be correct that the PV is low for firm that now has
them since it can't effectively use them until it becomes profitable...and that
may take awhile, so the value of the NOL is discounted possibly at a high cost
of capital?
Would it also be correct that a profitable acquiror could use the loss to
immediatly offset profits with the limitation that the loss didn't exceed the
purchase price?
Or is there some per year limit that necessarily turns the NOL tax benefits
into a series of future flows no matter how profitable the acquiror?

TimbaBear,

I applaud you for staying to what you know best! :)

I won't invest in a micro cap unless I see the usual suspects: 1) low
Price/Book, 2) low Price/Sales, 3) significant liguid cash assets and

4) insider buying, 5) and a catalyst to move the stock price.

I see AIF meeting these conditions with a significant amount of insider buying
and a catalyst to move the stock price (new management buying stock, management
selling the money losing prop/casualty business which has caused recent losses,
and increasing reserves for any additional prop/cas losses). The company will
be leaner with a profitable asset base. This leading crop insurance company
also bought the 2nd leader in this industry.

The company has $0 debt and a book value of $10.52 ($151,739 equity
investments/14,427 shares).

Marty Whitman always repeats the mantra: a bargain that stays a bargain is no
bargain. If I don't see insiders buying the stock and no catalyst -- then count
me out. :)

I can't figure out why no insider have been buying ref -- for example. No
directors for the past year has even purchased 100 shares. This tells me it
isn't the screaming bargain that the balance sheet says it is.

I'll go with Spekulatius here on MIR now.

Co. is attempting to strengthen their balance sheet with asset sales, stock
issuance, deferral of capital spending projects.

Company projects about $2/sh earnings for '02. If it happens, that's a p/e of
about 7 at current stock price.

Price/sales is low. (Might change though with asset sales and increase in stock
outstanding.)

Stock is selling near stated book value. (Given ENE and other companies in the
sector, book value, at best, imo, can only be used as a reference point now. So
I make reference to it and move on -g-)

Not much public history for this company. And other negatives, mentioned
earlier on this thread, are a valid concern.

Entire sector seems to be in turmoil. Hard for me to believe that companies
here which provide services that consumers want and expect, won't somehow get
the funding they need or be able to provide those services at a profit.
Ultimately. I hope.

My entry into an issue isn't based on market cap or trading volume or price per
share (per se).

The issue has to be traded on a major exchange (no BB or pennies), usually it
has to be US traded because I feel more comfortable with US GAAP than any
other.

I look for cash flow, and then paying a price for that cash flow that allows me
to make a great return. I don't look at future cash flow, I don't discount to
present value, and I derive cash flow by starting with the change in cash for
the period and working my way back up through the statement of cash flows
through financing and investing entries.

I don't look at EPS because, to me, it's bogus.

If the cash flow last year would have made it a good investment, and the cash
flow the year before would have made it a good investment and the current YTD
cash flow makes it a good investment, then I'm interested to look further.

Usually I start off with a list that I found somehow....here, stock screeners,
recommended lists, whatever....and then use Yahoo Profiles to winnow out the
obviously overpriced, over-indebted, under-profitable companies. There's just
not enough hours in the day to be thorough on all of the stocks, so this
process eliminates anywhere from half to all of whatever list I have.

Then I take the survivors and do my quickie cash flow analysis for the last 4
periods. Most are eliminated on this step.

Those few that survive go to the full number analysis of balance sheet, income
statement, and statement of cash flows for the current YTD and the prior two
full years.

Few survive. But those that do generally have proven to have more winners among
them than any other methodology I've used.

rating agencies. I like this better than Calpine's credit line because the
lenders are common shareholders like I am so they're taking a risk here like
me. This company has hard assets unlike Enron. This sector has gotten bad rap
from Enron fiasco and investors are on the edge making them to jump quick on
little things. Soon enough this sector will come back like always and restoring
their reputation once again.

Hi Paul - I kept the portfolio of value plays you posted here a while back;
SAFM is looking very good right now, any current thoughts on them?

I like ROAD too but the best entry there was 10 points lower. ROAD popped while
I was still watching.

in the letter to shareholders:

"...Your directors and your management team are
"eating their own cooking." Managers hold
more than one million shares and options on
Acceptance shares, and will be rewarded only
if the share price increases. Your Company's
directors hold more than 3.9 million shares,
assuring their attention to our business.
Collectively, directors and Company associates
acquired more than 580,000 shares of Acceptance
stock in 2000 affirming, with cash, their belief
in the long-term prospects of the Company.

Thanks for sharing in our holdings!"

Michael R. McCarthy
Chairman

In my biased opinion, all things
considered, I want my money in the same
camp as the insiders who are buying stock
with their own cash -- not exercising
options. It allows me to sleep better
knowing that I will prosper/suffer
with the individuals that know the
company the best! :)

Dale, I don't follow either of those stocks now, so I have no opinion to offer
there.

Given the way that I perceive that you invest, I offer instead three others
that might have potential for your investing style:

Good morning all!

Does anyone have a favorite site for getting the listing of companies that fall
within a certain grouping....say, Internet Security companies? The closest I've
been able to come gets me all software companies.

Is there any interest in putting our various favorite research sites together?
We probably use many of the same ones, but I bet we'd find some benefit from
sharing in a more structured way, like maybe listing those sites that have
three positive reviews from posters here. Maybe listing them on the same page
that we list the picks(if that's possible). Just some thoughts.

But I would appreciate help on the listing of stocks in the internet security
business.

Buck, the producer of upscale golf shirts and sportswear, are well-regarded in
their niches by consumers, but remain little-known on Wall Street because of
their tiny stock-market values. Yet both are attracting some value-oriented

Can't say the same about DECK's stock price and lumpy revenue. Maybe their

Bob, as far as NOL's go, the company which generated them could use them all
tomorrow if they had the earnings, although corporate minimum tax might
possibly get in the way. It is exactly to step in the way of a rich acquirer
doing the same thing that some complicated rules were developed.

I believe that you can't deduct NOL's of more than you paid for a company. I am
also certain that the gross amount can't be taken at an annual rate which
exceeds some (low) tax exempt interest rate on the initial amount. Thus you are
probably talking of their value being spread out over some 25 years now. I also
do not know how the expiration dates of the original NOL's fit into the
picture, but might cut off the ability of the acquirer to take the later ones.

For example, if you have a company with $250M NOL's that sells out for $100M,
if I am right they can take NOL's of perhaps $4 million over the next 25 years
(perhaps cut off earlier). That saves about $1.4M taxes per year. If you pick a
discount rate appropriate to investing in the crummy company that generated
them, like 20-30%, you can see that in my example they would not be worth over
$10 million, a far cry from the $250M NOL's to start with.

TimbaBear,

I find the MSN stockscreener to be the best on the Web and should give you what
you want. I've just checked and from Software they have a sub category called
“Security software and services”.

It’s free but you do have to download some small program first.

On SOFN (Softnet), I think the net operating losses can be fully taken - it's
tricky - but i think SOFN has to be the surviving company - so SOFN takes over
company A - & all of company a's profits then go untaxed until teh NOL's are
100% drawn down - but don't hold me to this

thanks

re: "Marty Whitman always repeats the mantra: a bargain that stays a bargain is
no bargain."

I guess his pick of CPCL keeps reminding him of that!

I've followed him into that one, and from what I can see, he still has it.

Unfortunately so do I. Since 7/99. And when the stock came down to 2x cash and
2/3 book value in 2000, I added more. Now the stock is below cash, which mgmt.
is trying to conserve given that CPCL is very (imo) unprofitable. And CPCL is
about .4x book value. That CPCL is trading below net current assets may not
outweigh the negatives that sales declines continue year after year, and
earnings losses seem to be increasing.

Still, this week I added more to my position.

Once you check in, it may be a while before you check out.

Although he said, if you buy a bargain and it remains a bargain, then it is no
bargain, he -- you are definately right! -- has had his share of perpetual

I believe that you are right, which is why a company like Penn Central, many
years ago, which had cash and huge NOL's from railroad losses, tried to buy
money making businesses to use them up. However, I thought we were talking
about SOFN selling out to another company, where I believe my general
description of the rules is correct.

- if SOFN owed creditors $100 bill, then SOFN wouldn't be able to use its NOL's

- but since SOFN is basically clean, then SOFN can become the holding company -
& the acquirer becomes the subsidiary of SOFN -

- it sounds nutty - but I've seen these types of mergers before - & i think
they were done to take advantage of the NOL's

The problem is there are lots of others out there with cash too.

And if too much of a % change in ownership occurs they are pretty much
worthless.

The biggest thing to me is them openly soliciting even parties not interested
in the NOLs, thats not a sign of strength.

Liquidation may be their best option. I think your confidence in $3-5 is
misplaced.

From:Bob Rudd
Jeffrey: Thanks for NOL info. I dug thru about a dozen texts before coming
across a decent explanation of this...which pretty much confirms what you've so
well stated here. Basically a change in ownership and a change in business
kills the NOL. A change in ownership while maintaining the lines of business
produces the limitation of taking the loss in annual increments limited by the
tax exempt bond rate and equity value before the change. There are other
limitations and constraints - it's a real bag of snakes.
As to structuring this as a deal where the company that has the loss buys a
profitable business as blankmind creatively suggested, I suspect there are
provisions that limit this...it's pretty apparent that a lot of folks have
spent sleepless nights making it difficult for a NOL to survive an ownership
change intact.
Thanks again for NOL insight. I have no SOFN, but this signficantly alters
value and margin of safety in other situations compared to what I had
previously assumed.

Glad to help, Bob. Because of these complications, I have come to value NOL's
as worth little to an acquirer. However, they are not worth little to an owner
at all. If the owner can become highly profitable in its existing business,
then the NOL's are very valuable in enhancing cash flow, versus a competitor
who has to pay taxes. COO is the best example I know of, where I used to say
that tax savings paid for some stock buybacks or acquisitions once they started
making real money again.

BAMM came out with a PR today, Upped their estimates for the year to 39-43
cents from 36-40 cents and gave guidence for 2003 of 15-20% EPS growth.

This looks good and with the stock at $3.60, i think it will/should move up to
$4 in short order.

A modest 12 P/E would give these shares a $4.80 Value next year and then
$5.52-6.00 the following year.

Although most of my shares we bought under $2, I believe there is more upside
in BAMM shares.
