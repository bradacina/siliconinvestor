Why I bought Olsten
12/20/95 $14.75 - Buy

1. Portfolio diversification.
2. 44% market share in US home health care. ($1.0B Revenue)
3. 3rd largest provider of temporary staffing services in US.
($1.4B Revenue)
4. Competitors are Manpower with $5.4B revenue and Kelly Services
at $2.7B.
5. Key player in two rapidly growing sectors.
6. International growth and expansion with focus in Europe and
Asia.
7. They are focused on home health care and temp staffing selling
off units that do not fit into this business model.
8. They are growing rapidly acquiring well established and
profitable companies locally and abroad.
9. Good brand recognition caused by great marketing.
10. Competent management as evidenced by 6 years of strong growth
gaining market share against competitors.
11. Well positioned to benefit from Medicare reform since home
health care is more cost effective than in-hospital or nursing
home care.

Analysis
1. Pretax profits have increased to 7.0% in 1996 averaging 4.9%
over last 5 years compared with 10.7% for entire industry.
Margin squeeze due to big contracts and sluggish growth this year
caused the Glitch. Management should be able to remedy these
problems. OLS margins are typically lower than other similar
companies because they deal in lower paying nonprofessional
workers.
2. ROE is 22%. Average over past 5 years is 17.3%. Industry
average is 21%.
3. PSR is 0.33 which is below 5 year low average of 0.36. 5 year
high average is 0.61. Industry average is 2.96.
4. 5-year average sales growth rate is 27.6% and EPS growth of
17.2%.
5. Current PE is 11. 5-year average low PE is 16.6 and average
high PE is 24.6.
6. Zack's ACE EPS growth rate is 19.3%. Based upon current
pricing and 1.2% yield and expansion to maximum PE will yield
annual return in excess of 35%.
7. Debt coverage is 33.8x.

Conclusions
1. Small margin increases will produce big gains in earnings.
2. Lots of room for PSR and PE expansion.
3. Little downside risk with current PE.
4. Debt is reasonable.
5. Good domestic and international expansion potential.
6. High customer and employee satisfaction.
7. Competent management.
8. Company lives in a continual state of transition. Expect
glitches.

Risks
1. Management has been able to expand and solve problems in the
past but there is a risk that they may be expanding too fast
through acquisitions relative to industry growth.
2. Competition from hospitals on the health care side could
restrict growth both in revenue and margins.
3. Federal legislation could cut Medicare payments for home
health care.

Literature Review
1. Value Line
- 25% insider ownership.
- Slightly higher than normal insider selling over past
year.
- Ranked 5 (lowest) for timeliness.
- Industry is consolidating and Olsten is eating a lot.
- Low margins also squeezed because of startup costs on big
contracts which should disappear after contracts are
underway.
- Company is rated A.
2. Zacks
- Zacks rank 5 (lowest)
- Average broker rating 2.8 (slightly better than neutral)
- 3 consecutive negative but small earnings surprises.
3. 3rd quarter 10Q
- Lots of nonrecurring charges integrating acquisitions.
- Revenues increased 22% for the quarter and 18% for the 9-month period. (Great
for a PSR play!)
- SG&A costs decreased as a percentage of revenues. (Good
controls)
4. Preannouncement on 11/21/96
- Cited near-term challenges in both business lines. In
temp staffing because of disproportionate startup costs for
big long-term profitable contracts.
- Liguori (CEO) wants to keep customers happy by maintaining
high quality and efficiency. (Good sign)
- Expanding into higher margin areas of professional
services like accounting, legal, and IS.
5. They shifted from defense industry staffing of 50-60% revenues
in 70s-80s to 8% now. Biggest growth area is OA and DTP.
Screens and trains employees on computer skills to fill these
jobs. Pays for benefits. LI Commercial Review 1996.
6. Temp staffing industry consolidating. Small high-tech
placement firms are being bought out by bigger firms. Kelly,
Accustaff and Olsten are the big players to diversify their
service lines. Many companies don't pay benefits to temps. Lots
of M&A activity in this area. San Francisco Business Times,
6/14/96, Pg7.
7. Olsten bought out Quantum health care in a stock swap. Olsten
won exclusive contract for Cigna Health care home health services
which has 10M enrollees. Big contracts are increasingly being
negotiated on a national basis. The Quantum acquisition makes
Olsten the 3rd largest home infusion provider in the country.
Quantum was a $286M company. Arizona Business Gazette, 6/13/96,
Pg 6.
8. Great article in a home-town newspaper about how Olsten treats
its employees - very well. The story is about a woman who
started with Olsten fresh out of college 11 years ago and now
runs a branch in Wooster, Ohio. They are very accommodating of
life styles and schedules of placement workers. People work long
hours but "have fun". They feel productive. Although they have
fun, "environment is very professional with rooms for testing
training and evaluation in a peaceful setting." The company is
in constant change and they constantly adapt. She praises the
competency of the staff and the late Bill Olsten. Talks about
life being good with a real family complete with husband and
kids. Hubby is very supportive. Daily Record Wooster, 5/12/96,
Pg D1.
9. Olsten acquires another Information Technology in UK. They
now have 2,100 consultants serving US, Canada, UK and Norway
through 34 offices. Rapid revenue growth tripling in past year
to $200M. Bought other IT consulting companies in US also. They
have a total of 700 offices in N. America, S. America, and Europe
for providing IT services. Business Wire, 9/19/96
10. Olsten has over 400,000 patient accounts and 150,000 care
givers on the health care side of the business. The provide
infusion therapy, physical/occupational/speech therapies,
respiratory therapy, rehab services, pediatric and prenatal care
in-home. In January 1996 they won Aetna Health Plans bid as one
of two providers for 7M members. Reiterated CIGNA deal.
Staffing services side of business is partnering with Fortune 500
companies as exclusive provider of temp services. They had over
300 contracts in place by the end of 1995. This accounted for
30% of staffing revenue in 1995. They are going after Info
Technology market next which has higher margins. Foreign revenue
was 20% in 1995. Better Investing, 6/96, Pg 78.
11. CEO Frank Ligouri CEO and Chairman received Natl Assoc of
Temp and Staffing Services Leadership Hall of Fame Award. The
award was presented to 10 executives in past 9 years. Lots of
time given in acceptance speech about gainful employment,
dignity, family values, job security, career and corporate
loyalty. Temporary staffing accounts for 2% of US workforce. He

Paul,
Got the 5% in BPT in 2 days, so I'm out.
ZILA is not exactly a value stock, but it has huge potential. I don't know why
they haven't been able to get their cancel detection process thru the FDA, nor
have they been able to sell much to other countries, but the good news on it's
results keeps coming out. With nearly 1.44 million shares compared to a normal
of 100,000 or so, this is a definite breakout and should restest the old highs
near 10 with support at the 7-1/2 barrier.
DSWLF (up 50%) had the pullback that can be expected after 5-7 straight up
days. If it holds above 13 for a few days, it can keep going up now.
ADEX (up 25%) & SNSR (up 35%) also pulled back today, but recovered a lot of
their losses.
BONT (up 10%)started working its way higher today.
REA (up 10%) and MAL (up 10%) - keep going higher, GLR should trad between 17 &
18 for a while.
LUKN (up 20%) and MODA (up 35%) are basing at their new higher levels.
BCU (up 8%)came out with a mediocre earnings, so I'd clear out with a 8% gain
since my original 12/14 post. Same with FRP (up 8%) which is up 8% and has a
mediocre outlook for the next quarter.
MWL (up 6% formerly MLWL) showed a lot of strength and could break through the
17 barrier. Probably a good short term trade if it does.
BMLS (down 25%) is pulling back more. I'd wait for the earnings before adding
to my position, but it's tempting, since I'm 95% sure they will earn more than
.10 this next quarter, which is a lot for a stock trading at 3-3/8, especially
if they come in above .13 which I think is do-able.

Comments on your value screen analysis

I looked at the screen on companies discussed on this thread that you posted-
but I see a problem. It implies that most of the companies here don't qualify
under your standards. But this sceen could be hiding quite a number of
compelling reasons to buy a stock.

For example, earlier on the thread, someone gave the example of CPCI, a $14
stock with 7.50 cash. Your screen doesn't adjust for this, so it doesn't look
good. Another example, the stock OJ is valued as much basically for the almost
16,000 acres of Florida real estate, as for the sale of the OJ. Assuming
Florida real estate increases in value, this could be a good long term
investment. (for the record I don't own either of these stocks yet; I'm still
looking) Basically the screen doesn't adjust for hidden, or undervalued asset
values. This is a value thread, so these stocks should be discussed here.

Another case where the screen doesn't pick up value, is where a number of
extraordinary events don't show up in trailing numbers. To pick a stock from
this thread that I do own to illustrate, lets consider BHE. The screen shows a
PSR of 1.27 and no debt. But BHE just bought out a company about the same size,
in the same business for $50M. They then did a secondary for $11M, with the
resulting debt/equity of 0.75. But the forward PE is 13 and trailing PSR is
0.76 . (For the record I do own stock in this company. A problem; of the five
analysts who have reports out on the company, all five have issued stong buys,
according to Zack's.)

Another example of where the screen doesn't pick up an unusual event, is the
new joint venture for LUKN discussed previously on this thread. (I passed on
this stock.)

Most of the companies on this thread have something unusual that draws the
posting investors here to their value. It takes some time to dig out what makes
these stocks interesting. We just need to keep plugging away to more fully
understand some of these situations. I suspect these may be some of the reasons
that you are finding only four stocks worthy of investing in now.

I almost sold DSWLF yesterday at 15+ but didn't; here's why.

This extraordinary run-up was sure to retrench as you suggested. But every time
I start getting into this trading game, I don't do as well as buying and
holding for at least a reasonable amount of time. If I had bought a larger
position, or owned the warrants, I would have dumped some.

I will hold for a higher price. Last year the Dec Q had the best sales and
earnings, I understand. I suspect the same thing will happen this year. So the
TTM earnings will be at least $1.62.

Worst case: Even if revenues and pre-tax earnings grow only 10% next year, the
pre-tax will be $1.78. The downside is that the new regime taxes earnings at
say 35%. That still leaves $1.16 in after-tax earnings. The stock trades at
only 11-12 times what I believe is reasonable worst case earnings.

Now if the earnings grow faster, as is likely, a more reasonable number is
$1.94 pre-tax. A 25% tax (stil large by HK standards), will leave $1.46. The
stock should trade at about 12 times this number, or about $17.50. If I see the
stock jump to the 17 level, I am out. The other day, I think the bid only got
to 15 1/4 or 15 3/8.

If the stock doesn't jump, I'm content to hold and let the magic of compounding
do its work, and accept the risk.

Show me evidence that there is a high correlation between amount of cash and
the increase in the price of a stock. I like cash rich companies but I don't
use it for a primary screening tool.

This is true. This is traditional Graham-Newman-Buffett stuff. This may indeed
be a good value play. The problem is that they are difficult to identify. You
typically have to rely on analysts who pore over this stuff day-in and day-out
and only make a public statement about it after they and all the other Wall St.
buddies have bought all they want to.

I found two on my own in the past several years. Texas Industries (TXI) is the
biggest supplier of cement in Texas and owns 85% of Chapparrel Steel which
produces rebar for building roads and structural steel. Texas is in a mini-boom
but fear of reduced tariffs is keeping people from expanding capacity.
Everything is running at capacity. Cement demand is very high and prices are on
the way up still 20% below the national average. Meanwhile, they keep on
selling off land periodically to buy back stock. They've bought back over 10%
of the stock in the past 18 months and they plan to continue. So this is also
an asset play. I think I've averaged around 25-30% return in the past few years
now and it has a dreadfully low PSR of 0.6 so there is very little downside
risk.

The other one is Terra-Nitrogen (TNH) which IMO is a bungled attempt by Terra
Industries to pick up another fertilizer plant. This is a very long and complex
story and I'm not going to get into it at this time but THN pays around
25%/year in shareholder distributions (like dividends except that its an LP)
and the stock price has nearly doubled in 2 years. Total return is something
like 200% in 3 years. The PSR remains a paltry 0.5!

If the trialing PSR=0.76, then this would be a good candidate based upon the
PSR apporach IF THIS IS TRUELY AN EXCELLENT COMPANY.

I stick with PSRs because they are easy to identify and they have a proven
track record of verifying value. Granted - it is going to miss a lot of the
special situations that you describe but I've been burnt too many times when
something goes wrong in special situations. TNH and TXI are cases that meet
both of our criteria.

Paul and a lot of others on this thread are traditional Value Investors in the
vein of Graham/Newman/Buffett and are looking for "hidden" value like assets or
something that isn't obvious by number crunching. The reference to "meeting
both of our criteria" was that TNH and TXI meet my PSR criteria and Paul's
"hidden value" criteria.

PSR is price/sales. I use it on all types of stocks but its traditional use is
for stocks that have unpredictable earnings - hence PE charts are pretty
useless. The basic idea is that a company with a upwardly trending sales
history is a growth company even though it may have volitile earnings. This is
true of most tech stocks. The biggest detractors of PSR are those that buy
strictly on PSR without evaluating the company. The key here is that PSR is
only reliable if you truely have an excellent company. I posted my evaluation
of OLS o this thread during the past week and it has the basic concepts. The
other reason I like it is that history shows that in a correction, high PSR
stocks may never recover while most low PSR stocks do recover for truely
excellent companies in both cases.

My favorite text on the subject is "Super Stocks" (Ken Fisher, 1984). The most
recent one that I know of is "What works on Wall St." (O'Shaughnessy, 1996).
Fisher's book is a manual on "how to user PSR's". The latter book analyzes
around 25 different stock picking techniques by the pros and various variations
on PSR finish on top. This is based upon historical data back to the 1950s. It
caused quite a stir on Wall St. among fund managers 85% of which can't manage
to beat the S&P!

In the event that you are intersted in mutual funds, you should know that James
O'Shaughnessy, author of "What Works on Wall Street" has established a family
of four mutual funds that emulate the back-tested strategies that have been
successful going back 40 years. His Cornerstone Growth fund uses PSR as the
primary screen for stock selection in his portfolio. He screens for stocks with
PSR < 1.50, then proceeds to screen for year-over-year earnings growth and
price momentum.

The question I have regarding the low PSR strategy has to do with the bias
towards low margin retailers and old-line manufacturers. I am not sure that PSR
is an appropriate valuation yardstick for micro cap companies and companies in
high tech or biotech.

Brian - PSRs actually work pretty well across all industries and company sizes.
O'Shaughnessy categorically puts a limit at PSR=1.5 for all his picks
regardless of size however Fisher has a nice chart on page 49 that shows a
reasonable range of PSRs for various company sizes. I should note that he uses
only tech stocks in his chart but I have been successful using it for other
companies as well. Also, Fisher encourages buying below 0.75 for smaller
companies and rarely over 1.0 unless it is a very good company. He also has
other rules for big industrial companies. It may sound complicated but its
actually easier compared to other methods I've tried.

Sirs: More on PSRs.

Also proponent of PSRs is Charles Allmon of Growth Stock and Junior Growth
Stock newsletters. He has written that his emphasis on sales to price predates
the importance of the PSR measure attributed to Ken Fisher. Fisher is a regular
columnist for Forbes. Both his PSR beliefs and PSR stock picks are occasionally
discussed there. Also you might review Al Frank's New Prudent Speculator,
currently in print and in some bookstores; he uses Fisher's data and very
briefly explains importance of PSRs. But, echoing, Jeff Maresh, Fisher's '84
book is the classic work for PSR.

I believe it is as easy or easier to "alter" sales as earnings. I've seen
plenty of stories wherein managers shipped to inventory but recorded these
shipments as sales; where managers recorded sales at 100% on the dollar when
customers paid in partial payments (and later defaulted on the payments - (like
in some of my real estate stocks - ouch!), or where customers - like resellers
- could return unsold merchandise (the ole sales that ain't sales trick). So, I
would not consider PSR as a "safer from management finagling" tool than any
other tool you might use to analyze stocks which is based on managers supplying
data. Less confusing than earnings calculations maybe, safer . . . no.

(I have to say I am both shocked and very disheartened to read profiles of
various people with 10-15 years "experience" who are unfamiliar with PSRs) Paul

Jeff, I find your approach very informative and I promise to someday look at
Fisher's book to find out more about PSR's.

I would very much appreciate it if you could apply your analysis to OTEXF after
their earnings release this Tuesday.

Looking forward to hearing more about your approach and how it might be applied
to all kinds of stock investing.

Paul - Charles Allmon is also a regular contributor to NAIC's Better Investing
mag. He recommended Euro-Nevada Mining as a gold value play in the 9/96 issue.
Its traded on the TSE as symbol YEN.

YEN is not a traditional mining company. They work strictly with potentially
high-yielding deposits anywhere in the world. They secure land rights, map the
deposits, make estimates on yields, then turn over the actual mining operation
to one of the big mining companies. In return, YEN gets royalties based upon
the amount of gold extracted from the mine. They are responsible for a few of
the biggest "finds" in the past several years and have a bunch of new areas
that are expected to start producing this FY. They have a nice balance sheet -
$20 in revenues, 52% profit margins, no debt, over $160M in cash and gold
bullion, lots of free cash flow, a current ratio of 35 to 1, and only 35
employees.

The stock has been practically flat since September even with gold prices
dropping. Allmon stated that if gold doesn't go anywhere, the stock will go up
because of the new mines opening. And if gold prices increase, he expects big
price appreciation.

Ginger - Data for YEN is quite elusive. Your local library should have the Sep
issue of Better Investing which has the article by Charles Allmon. You can get
a chart from the TSE and other very basic data at

http://www.telenium.ca :80/TSE/texthdr.html

and current prices at

http://www.telenium.ca :80/TSE/e.html

Prices on the TSE are quoted in C$ so you have to convert to US$. The current
exchange rate is about $0.72US per C$. So multipy the values on the TSE by .72
to get US$. The symbol on the TSE is EN.

Also, you can call the company's IR folks at (416) 480-6494 and request an
investor's kit. This is one of the more useful packages I have obtained as far
as investor kits are concerned. It included a number of brokerage reports and
several articles about the company in addition to the usual 10K and recent
10Q's.

As far as analysis goes, I bought based on the fact that they have no debt,
very high margins, very low variable costs, a lot of cash, a very good
long-term track record of coming through on things they have promised, and a
number of "world class" mines that will start producing in the next four
quarters. They only have a total of 35 employees. I am planning to add to my
position again in the next month.

Happy Investing!

To Jeff: Right. Which leads me to guess that you are thorough enough in your
research to have probably seen the 6/96 article on OLS in the Undervalued Stock
column.
I must have overlooked Allmon's YEN recommendation in NAIC; I'm in same camp as
prior poster - Ginger. After you posted, I punched symbol in Yahoo, etc. got no
response - figured it was a typo or obscure co. and got sidetracked by other
stock lookups.
Re Allmon: yes, I try to check out his recommendations - he's made some great
long term buys over the years. Sometimes a little too growth oriented for me,
and he regularly gets taken to task in the press for his very high cash
position and bearish views over the past what - 10 years! - - still, his ideas
are worth reading and checking. But of course, I think that you already know
all this. Paul

that it was still a bit overvalued for my tastes.

Also, on the ticker symbols for Euro Nevada just to clear any past confusion I
may have caused - the ticker is EN on TSE, and YEN in the US. Also, on the
stock chart you get from the TSE, there is a huge drop around 7/10/96. Not to
fear - it was a split.

I am not questioning the use of PSRs in evaluating stocks, however I believe
that different screens or thresholds must be applied to different industries or
sub-industries. Strict adherence to a PSR < 1.50 would virtually rule out
investment in higher-margin companies and/or industries and place
disproportionate emphasis on industries with razor-thin margins like retailing.

I think your point makes a lot of sense, Brian. Just as industry averages are
used for P/E's, should they not also be applied to PSR?

Also, higher p/e's are tolerated by the market if earnings are increasing
rapidly...should the same not go for sales?

GS - Obviously it depends upon what buy/sell rules you want to use to pick
stocks. I like picking stocks based upon PSR because its going to reject
companies with rapidly growing sales with subjectively high valuations. I use
PSR ranges as suggested by Fisher depending upon company size. While a very
small company ($20M sales) may be able to make huge gains in sales in 1 year,
this is rarely possible with larger (>$600M) companies.

Sure there are going to be very large companies that have large PSRs because of
incredible sales growth such as INTC at 7+ and MSFT at 10+ (I think). IMO these
are not bargain stocks. But in general the larger the company gets, the smaller
the tolerable PSR if you use Ken Fisher's method. The beauty of stock picking
based upon PSRs is that in general sales tend to be less volitile in either
direction compared with earnings.

And then there is the case of high PSRs on smaller companies such as Cascade
Comm. CSCC was PSR=20 Friday AM and PSR=13 Friday PM. This is a great example
of risk associated with high PSRs. Or how about Netscape that is somewhere
around PSR=60 right now? This is the risk if one tolerates higher PSRs on
companies with rapidly increasing sales.

These rules work for me: My goal is to achieve good price appreciation (buying
low PSRs) and to minimize downside risk (selling PSR>6 for midcaps and much
lower for large caps). You may want to use a different set of rules for your
goals.

DSWLF had a blowout earnings report. They should earn near $2.00 this year and
are trading a bit above 15. Painting a negative scenario, earnings would drop
about 15% from dilution when they call the warrants (assuming the cash raised
earns no money) and another 30% if China raises taxes by 30% for Hong Kong
companies in July. That leaves about $1.20 in earnings still with a 20% growth
rate for a pessimistic view and 30% for mildly optomistic. It still looks cheap
to me. Bad news is there is a huge spread. Good news is that the stock can be
bought cheaper by buying the warrants. I show a closing bid ask of 15-1/4 to
16-3/8. The warrants are 2-13/16 to 3-1/8 which equates to 14-11/16 to 15-5/16
since it takes 2 warrants to buy one share of the stock at 9-1/16
(aporximately). The warrants can be called if the stock trades above 12-1/16
for 20 consecutive days, which looks very likely to me.

I also like OGAR and think it should creep up some more each week for a while.
They just made an acquisition which appears will be accretive to earnigns

Appreciated your PSR response to my AMAT valuation questions on that thread and

equipment and software for newsroom productionas well as television and movie
production. This niche is growing at 30% per year and Avid is the respected
leader in this industry. Avid ran into management problems at the end of 1995.
It seemed they pursued market share at the expense of profitability. New
management with experience in turnarounds is in place. Company had a losing
1996 but looks to turn profitable in 1997. Current PSR is somewhere around .60.
I'll try to provide further information if you have an interest.

Jeff:

I'll attempt to bring you up to speed on Avid as much as I am able. I am no
techie and will have to defer those questions to others.

I first got interested in Avid when in kept showing up in the portfolios of
Montgomery mutual funds, especially those managed by Roger Honour who manages
the Micro Cap and Growth funds. This was one of his largest holdings and showed
up in other Montgomery funds as well. Back then, about 80% of was Avid was
owned by institutions. I think about 70% is owned by them today.

If you have access to America Online, the Fools did a value analysis of Avid on
8/6/96 and is still available if you do a search. They put fair value at 13 but
that analyis is based on old news. Still, good backgound on Avid.

Also, Barron's had an article on Avid within the past 6 months. You should be
able to access it at their site at http://www.barrons.com/
. Do a search with "Avid" and you should get the article. You will get answers
to your management questions and see that a small competitor of Avid was bought
out at a little over 1 times sales. You will also see that Avid has some cash
flow concerns. In my talks with investor relations, they have stated that Avid
is not lacking in research money. Their primary goal at this point will be to
get the accounting straightened out and improve cash flow. Note the series of
one time charges to earnings. They will even have one this quarter. But notice
that sales revenues seem to be increasing.

Avid pursues four markets. I don't have market share information. I do beleive
they have a good share. I also beleive their market share has declined,
especially at the lower end priced area of their markets. All things
considered, people in the industry of editing would rather do it with an Avid
product but there has been a pricing problem with their products in the past
that has put their products out of reach of many editors. Their is an inactive
Avid folder on Silicon and DKuspa there has a good handle of the technicals. He
is neutral to bearish on the stock but I beleive he is not looking at it from a
pure value play.

The stock is now selling at about $1 over book. It is now selling at near its
all time low. The effects of tax selling are still in the stock. Sentiment is
about as negative as it can get.

Avid has a site at http://www.avid.com/
which is worth checking out.

I have a small position in Avid.

Good luck and let me know what you think. I'll try to answer any other
questions you may have.

One more thing. There are 21.16m shares outstanding with a float of 9.3m. If
and when things turn around, this small float combined with the institutional
ownership should move it quickly to the upside. The institutions have been
burned on this stock so bad in 1996 they are probably waiting to see what
happens. My guess is that they dumped about 14% of their holdings since June of
96.

using their valuation techniques. No position was ever established nor even
really considered as this stock is not part of the growth genre they generally
pursue.

Regarding Power Investor from the Investor's Alliance, I used it and found it
good except for one major flaw. They relied upon (at that time) companies to
provide them with financial information. Many companies, especially the small
ones, did not provide that information. Even the information for the larger
companies was not up to date. A program like this is only as good as the
information it is based upon. It is not real time information; rather it was

Tom - I found the stuff on AVID in Barrons. I have this pile sitting here
including the latest 10Q I will start reviewing.

Another thing we need to establish in this kind of situation is the
compensation package of upper management. They are losing money AND under new
top management. Lots of turnover in the last 18 months. (Geez - who needs soap
operas!) If management is getting a big salary, owns little or no stock or
options, then there is no real incentive to fix the company. He always draws a
fat paycheck regardless of performance. This would be a show stopper for me.
What would be ideal is for management to get a modest salary compared with
counterparts in similar businesses with a lot of stock, options, or performance
bonuses. This info is usually in a proxy statement but I couldn't find one on
Edgar.

Also, another sector that is beaten up right now is manufactured housing. A
couple have already been mentioned on this thread. I think people are scared
about interest rates. Any other insight here?

think I moved the market but I think the expiration of the 31 day wash rule for
those intsitutions that sold below 12 at end of year is beginnnig to expire.

No real insight on manufactured homes except that quality has improved
reportedly. I don't think this is a high end product. If you have the money,
you are going to go custom. So I guess I would look for a company with a
presence in real estate markets in first time or low end homeowners that was
booming. One big advantage to manufactured homes is that they can literally go
up in a day after the foundation has been poured. In a boom market, you want
your house pronto and if builders are swamped you can go modular and have it
built in that fashion. I think interest rates are too high and will trend lower
over the year. If I find anything else, I will post.

Tom - Take a look at the products by Southern Energy (SEHI) and Clayton Homes

long way from trash trailers. I sat in on Clayton's presentation at an
investor's seminar last year and I was quite surprised. People were going ga-ga
over CMH. It was the darling of the investor's fair! The PSR was too high and
it has subsequently dropped because they had a couple of negative surprises.
CMH is still too high to buy IMHO. But others are not. I've had about 3 or 4
pop up on my Value Screens lately and haven't had a chance to investigate
further. SEHI was written up somewhere (I can find it if you really want to
know) as one of the top small companies in the US.

Also on AVID, I should be able to understand their product line somewhat. I

Hi Tom - I went through about 100 pages of Avid stuff including the latest 10Q
and unfortunately this one might not turn the corner IMO. It looks like another
SRM scenario. Here are the details:

The good news:
==============
1. The compensation packages for Miller (CEO), Flaherty (CFO), and Jenks (VP
Worldwide SLS/MKTG) appear to be reasonble for a turnaround situation.

Now the bad:
============
1. They have 2 patent infringement suits pending against them. Both were filed
in '96 and they have no plans on losing. One company I own spent millions over
a couple of years and won and got nice royalties from the loser. Shaving a few
points off of a an already margin is not good.

2. They are about a $500M company and made their money selling $50K-$80K
systems that use technology that they pioneered. The potential base worldwide
is only supposed to be 10,000 units and they don't replace these systems every
year. Run the numbers and you find that $50K x 10,000 = $500M. Sure they are
selling other stuff but the market looks saturated particularly if the life of
one of these boxes is 3-5 years.

3. A lot of little ants are crawling all around selling less capable but
adequate systems in the $10K-$20K range. Prices keep on dropping and soon you
might be able to buy a chunk of software for a couple of thousand bucks that
runs on an NT box.

4. By replacing most of top management last year, they might have lost a good
bit of corporate history. Some people are still on the board but others left
entirely.

5. The receivables quantity and aging indicates that the sales they are making
are marginally credit-worthy. I think the Barron's article also commented on
this one.

6. New technology may completely render this technology obsolete. DVD which is
due out shortly doesn't require this kind of equipment for editing since it is
digital in nature. This equipment exists solely because broadcast stuff is
currently analog.

Jeff

Jeff, here are the figures for OTEXF.

Revenues:

Q2 1996 $2,400,000 (approx)
Q3 1996 3,300,000 (approx)
Q4 1996 3,734,000
Q1 1997 4,042,000
Q2 1997 5,216,000 (released yesterday)
Q3 1997 7,200,000 Tom Hua's wild prediction

Current price $8.125
Shares outstanding 16.7 million

For PSR, maybe you can tell me how to calculate this by myself. Are we talking
about market cap divided by the sales for the past 4 quarters? So in this case
about $110 million/ 16.3 million = in excess of 6?

You can see what I mean though...if you take the first 4 numbers listed above
you come out with annual sales of $13.4 million. If you take the last 3
quarters plus a projection for next quarter, you get annual sales of $20
million. If you look at potential numbers for fiscal 1998 you may be looking at
30-32 million, so we're clearly looking at a growth play and not a value play.
And one I am sure you might find overpriced...but there is, surely, a lot to
the story, margins, growth, potential earnings, etc.

Any input or help with calculating these numbers would be appreciated.

Cheers, Geek

Jeff, what do you think of XICO? They had a disappointing quarter in terms of
revenue and dropped from around 11 to 8 with a PSR of 1.3 at today's closing
price. You can check out their thread/profile under Semiconductors. This might
be attractive because the revenue hiccup was caused by "temporary"
manufacturing problems. This looks a little like the situation APCC went
through although I hope it is of shorter duration.

Jeff: Appreciate your review. No doubt Avid has problems. No denial there. But
one major question to me in value investing is whether the market has
discounted Avid's problems and maybe missing something. In adopting a
turnaround situation like Avid, you are betting either for management or
against it. I like the change in management and believe it can turn the company
around to some extent and even maybe to a large extent although Avid will have
problems achieving its former level of market value. But I have not bet the
ranch on Avid.

1. Yes, Avid has patent infringement suits against it. I am fairly certain one
of the is merely a counterclaim to Avid's original suit against it.

2. Avid's Media Composer (I believe this is your 10,000 unit reference) is only
one of fifty products the company sells today. Take a look at the annual report
if you are still interested. The company divides its products into seven
categories: editing products, audio products, image manipulation products,
newsroom automation systems, newsroom automation systems, playback products,
network and server products and storage systems. Note that Avid's revenues have
increased sequentially in 1996: 1st quarter, 92m; 2nd quarter, 109.1m; and
third quarter, $114.7m. Gross margins have improved from 43% to 47% over the
same time period.

3. No doubt there is competition, especially at the lower end. But 90% of all
this seasons prime time television shows are being edited on Avid systems. I
hope management can dominate the lower end markets as well some day.

4. Unfortunately, management was the large part of the problem and that history
had to be lost it would seem in order for the company to survive. I don't think
Mr. Miller would leave the comfort of a successful turnaround at Quantum and
Imprimis if he did not think he could do the job at Avid. His actions so far
have been positive for the bottom line.

5.Receivable problem being addressed. Aging improved to 66 days outstanding
from 72 days and net receivables declined from June, 1996 to September, 1996.

6. Avid is involved with digital film and video production. This market is
growing at 30% per year. Avid won't get every drop but will have market share.

I am not trying to sell you on this company. It sounds like it does not meet
your criteria if you are looking for the super-stocks. This one is complex and
a little ugly. I kept asking myself what the institutions saw in this company.
I think they view Avid's problems as management issues in large part. I believe
what they see is a very positive change in management and a good chance at a
turnaround which may not produce the next Microsoft but would reward them with
increased shareholder value.

Geek - These are the numbers I'm working with for OTEXF:

Q3 1996 3,300,000 (approx)
Q4 1996 3,734,000
Q1 1997 4,042,000
Q2 1997 5,216,000 (released yesterday)

Current price $8.125
Shares outstanding 16.7 million

Total Sales last 4Q = 16.2M
Market Price for the entire company = 8.125 x 16.7 = 136M

PSR = 136 / 16.2 = 8.4

Also, IMO it doesn't make a lot of sense to use future numbers on sales because
you'd have to project the price at the time of future earnings which is a crap
shoot.

Think of how much you would have made on PSR expansion if for some reason you
could have picked up this company at PSR=.75. The point here is that if you
pick up a glitched company at a low PSR, you make a lot of money through PSR
expansion. A PSR>8 is pretty achievable for successful companies of this size
over the long haul.

Tom - I left it up to you to make the majority of the positive points for AVID
which you have done. Where did you find the 30% growth rate figure?

Also, there are a two potential reasons why Sony and Matsushita didn't jump
into this fray:

1. Its too small a market and wouldn't add much to the bottom line. The big
boys like to sell large quantities of stuff and they are going to compare a
development project for film editors against other projects and pick the one
that is going to give them the best bang for the buck. Large companies go after
large markets.

2. Asian companies are very strategic and are patient to gain marketshare. They
may have sunk their R&D money into pure digital technology which will render
obsolete the current film editing technology.

In any case, this is one to keep an eye on to see what materializes.

Jeff: Montgomery's Roger Honour stated recently: "More and more, film and
broadcast professionals, as well as home video makers, are using digital film
tools to edit video footage on computers. That market is growing at 30% per
year. Avid is a leader in the business but focused more on market share than
profitablity. Going forward, new management is in place, and the company is
focused on profitable growth. We saw this as an opportunity - which is why we
made Avid a top priority in the Growth Fund."

Morgan Stanley, Piper Jaffrey, Prudential Securities and Volpe Welty follow the
stock. If anyone has a broker with these firms, they can get their reports and
perhaps shed more light on the company.

Followup on BHE versus DIIG; DIIG takes off

We've been discussing BHE on the thread and you asked:
"I'd say it is a solid, good company with value features, no?"

I agreed, but suggested you look st DII Group:
http://www.techstocks.com/~wsapi/investor/s-10036/reply-214

Well today DIIG took off; the earnings came in as expected, and all they did
was repeat their projection of $600M in revenues and $2.50 a share earnings for
this year. Even with the run-up to 24 today, the stock trades at PSR=0.43 TTM
consolidated revenues, and PSR=0.33 this year's projected revenues. And the
forward PE=10. And the company's long term growth over the last five years is
very good.

There is a thread on DIIG on SI, suggest to anyone interested to post there:

OK Jeff, I think I'm finally getting the hang of this. I was pleased this week
to see that Leo Oorts' 'wild' predictions of a turnaround at Centura (CNTR,
formerly Gupta) came true. The stock is up a bit on the recent announcement
that shows they have really turned it around and are now in the black.

Even after a good bounce in the stock price from recent levels below $4 to
today's close at $5, the PSR is 1.20 based on sales of 63.233 mil and a market
cap of 75.900 mil. They have just acquired a company called Infospinner which
is likely to add value & they will probably carry this momentum with stronger
earnings next q after really slashing costs.

Believe this is a buying opportunity. Anyone agree?

And...Corel Corporation (COSFF), everybody's favourite punching bag, has a PSR
of 1.17 based on sales of 334.2 mil and a market cap of 389.35 mil. Go figure.

125 million of these sales came in the most recent quarter. If next year's
sales hit 700 mil (not unlikely) then I think we'll start to see this turn into
a major momentum play. But it may be 4 quarters away.

Anyway it is comforting for us Corel punching bags to know that the stock is
now less risky, now that it is trading for peanuts.

New value hit list

I had some time to run some screens last night and dredged up the following
possibilities. Bear in mind that I haven't done any further research so this is
definitely not a buy list, just a list of possibilites.

I screened on:

Price within 50% of 52-week low
D/E < 50%
PSR < 1.5
Historic growth > 10%
Estimated LT growth > 12%

The screen turned up about 240 issues and the following ones at least look
promising as value plays.

around $28 before it started to drop. They have lots of cash, but
also lots of stock for a new IPO (100 million shares), but they are
opening new restaurants at a pretty fast clip, the last two in
Singapore and Thailand within the last several weeks. Volume has picked
up, running close to 1 million shares per day for the last four days.

Pete - Steel in general is depressed right now. Last year was bad for the
entire industry. I own NUE (Nucor) and Chaparrel (???) through Texas
Industries. I saw WHX too but I already own enough steel. There has been quite
a few articles over the past couple of years (I can get you sources if you have
further interest) that suggest that NUE is going to move from #4 now to #1 in
the next few years. Its not really a value stock but I'd call it the best of
all steel companies and its fairly valued right now. They just spent a lot of
money on capacity expansion over the past couple of years and I think they are
going to be running on all 8 cylinders when as the industry turns around. The
last article I read stated that NUE will be running at full capacity by the end
of '97.

The primary problem with most steel companies is labor. Just when they get
enough money to innovate to keep ahead of NUE, the unions grab it. Neither NUE
nor Chaparrel are unionized yet their employees make a lot more money than
union workers in the majors. NUE also pays for college for the kids of
employees, pays for ongoing technical training for employees, and pays big
performance bonuses.

What I saw in WHX was a potential short-term value play.

Dropping stock prices of computer resellers are used as a bell-

Whereas Fry's stores are always jammed full of customers, even
