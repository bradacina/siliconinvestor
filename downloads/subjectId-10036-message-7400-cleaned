Has anyone read or know anything about Marty Whitman's new (4/99) book, "Value
Investing, A Balanced Approach". I'll get it if you guys say it's worthwhile.
But it is $50 bucks from Amazon. That is stiff imo for a stock market book.
When the market turns (down), these books often show up in many 2nd-hand book
stores. Where a value investor probably ought to buy them -g-.

I brought this one up before but didn't receive much input. But I feel I should
bring it up again. Novacare (NOV) is trading way below book value in an
industry that has been hammered by the BBA of 97. Here is my initial post:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=9814016

Anyway, management is selling off parts of the company to pay off debt and
return to the core business, outpatient Physical Therapy. One of the latest
press releases has stated that they will sell their shares of NCES, which is
the company they created for their own use of labor. The sale of NCES will make
them long term debt free. The following analysis is from NovAnalyst on the
Yahoo thread.

<<My guess is the Pre-Tax (earnings) of a stand-alone Outpatient with no debt
(it will all be gone with the close of O&P and NCES) is in the $40mm range.
With roughly 62mm shares, that's $0.65 per share Pre-Tax, or $0.39 after-tax
whenever NovaCare will have to pay those again! Put a 12 multiple of on it and
the stock should trade for $4.65.>>

It is also a strong possibility that HealthSouth, their main competitor, could
buy them out. Senior management owns a bundle of options with a conversion
price of 2 5/8. The stock is currently trading at 2. In my viewpoint, there is
only the risk for upside here with a return to profitability or a buyout.

Another thing that I like about this stock is the fact that all the employees
that have had to take pay cuts, spun off to another company, or rif'd are
constantly blasting the stock on the Yahoo thread. And as Mike often says, when
the sentiment is negative but the stock is undervalued, it looks good to me. I
have taken a position.

While this looks like a useful addition to "Financial Shenanigans" and "Quality

it's solid gold stuff. Mulford is an accounting prof and he looks awful young

as growing A/R, cashflow vs. GAAP earnings, that sort of stuff.

Can anyone who has read it comment on this? Is it a first level introductory

correctly. SI's a good example. With rare exceptions, it is rather difficult to
pin down a person's age/experience by their stock picks/ideas. And no matter

re: accounting/financial prof's and making money in the stock market

I never can come to a good conclusion on this stuff.

If accounting professors are expert at financial warnings and this is
important, then categorically these folks should have an overwhelming advantage
over the rest of us who are ignorant. So why aren't they rich from stock market
investing? Or maybe at least a few are. (Graham/Whitman??) Seems to me, when
there's a company blowup, people -- especially professors -g- -- go back and
look at the financial statements, and say, "yes, it was obvious if only anybody
(who knew anything about financial statement analysis) looked". But just prior
to the blowup, one probably saw plenty of buy recommendations on the stock from
analysts.

If expertise in financial accounting is profitable and important or necessary
for investment success, why aren't these guys managing funds rather than
teaching MBAs in ivory towers? (Again, maybe they are. And I may be confusing
accounting and finance expertise here.)

My own proclivity is to assume that some stocks suffer from misleading or
illegal accounting. Rather than spend eons combing through each potential and
actual purchase, I'll play the diversity game and just assume 10% of my
positions will bite me because of financial items that could have been detected
but were not.
And I do have my 10% :>(

Re: stock picking vs. stock selling.

It has been said that a stock well-bought is half-sold. IOW, if you've done
your DD on the front end, it is obvious when to sell. There's value in that,
but the cliche is incomplete, IMO. It is one thing to wait for a fat pitch and
quite another to assess, upon attaining 2nd base, whether stretching for a
triple represents a favorable risk/reward. This situation can be further
complicated by the fact that the very next batter also possesses your exact
same ability (or inability) to wait for a fat pitch. Why shouldn't one just
wait for the absolute fattest pitch, making every swing a home run and
eliminating the sell decision? Well, even Buffett hasn't done that. A nice
goal, but possibly impractical.

I think we are combining two distinct issues. One is stock picking/ideas
related to age. I don't see anyone arguing that stock picking/ideas/good
thought-through posts/etc. are a function of age (assuming one is at least old
enough to read/write). The 15 year-old can be assumed to be indistinguishable
from the 50-year old. And wisdom and perspective don't necessarily enter in to
it.

But if anyone "doubts there is such a thing as grizzled veteran's wisdom and
perspective" regarding making money in the stock market, I will argue with
that. There's a heck of a lot more to the process, as we know, than just
identifying good stocks. Like knowing when to hold, being able to hold, when to
add, when to sell, understanding our own risk tolerance (which means being
aware of our own personality), understanding the purchase in terms of the
overall portfolio (not just as a stock out there by itself). In this market,
with 15-year old kids having newsletters and national followings, and maybe
even good performance records (why not? Everything seems to be blooming now.),
it just isn't easy to see. But for anyone with 8-12 years buying and selling
stocks - imo, they will have have a veteran's perspective which is quite
different from someone with ony three years' experience (whether that three
years is from a 15-year old or from a 50-year old).

I agree with you and the tenents of net-net investing, but the combination of
laziness and not knowing what to do with the cash and an aversion of paying
capital gains, keeps me holding on. And, somehow I rationalize an excuse for
holding on (have the ability to fool myself)like the business is better than it
really is. I need to remember that net-nets are a short term strategy and to
get out when the price pops.

I recently purchased a small stake in LANC (I believe that was your find), and
I to have been watching Disney. I never stumbled upon LANC before, and based
upon its past performance which appears excellent, I started taking a small
position.

As for net-nets, the topic of this thread, I took a shot on DAIO. This appears
a pretty risky situation and I probably should have steered away from it, but
dollars for 60 cents was tempting and a friend of mine in the 'Valley' said
they were once a leader in their field, so they have or had somewhat of an
established business and I had some spare cash sitting around so . . . For
sure, I'm out on the first pop on this one, if ever given the chance.

I am very seriously looking at CSE (Case/New Holland) situation. As Mike Burry

commit funds in anticipation of several net-nets that you might be sharing with

While someone with eight years' experience in equity investing will have a
perspective somewhat "deeper" than someone with only three years' experience, I
don't think I would give him/her the title of "veteran." Someone who has only
invested for the past eight years has never been through something like the
extended, emotionally draining 1973-74 bear market, the feeling of sixteen
years (1966 - 1982) of sideways market while inflation runs rampant, or the
rapid plunge of '87. I believe that many of today's investors will get to live
through periods like these, perhaps beginning in the not-too-distant future. I
will award the title of "veteran" to those that still invest in equities after
periods like these.

Hi I2. Yes, I thought about that when I wrote it. I sluffed it- took the easy

stock market players, unless they are very exceptional - most guys aren't going
to make (and hold onto) serious money in the stock market until they are about
fifty years old with at least a couple of decades of experience. It's when
their personality settles down, they know who they are, they've tried it all
and know what works for them, and they have a rich man's mindset (they've got
enough capital and they don't panic or get seduced out of their picks). (And by
then, maybe like you I think, they've got stocks they've held on to for decades
or more.) Who even wants to hear that? If true, could be disheartening for a
young guy.

When people who know me say, well I ought to be rich because I've been doing
this investing thing for so long, all I do is sigh and say no. The best and
only thing that I can say for myself (I tell them this too) is that I'm still

still finding stocks I like.

them. I've studied the crashes and crunched the inflation-adjusted numbers, and
I can imagine how scary it would feel to be in a market that cut Disney not

If "Paul's side" is that grizzled veterans mean anything, then I stand firmly
on the other side. You can read through Forbes or Fortune or Worth and find any
number of grizzled veterans with lucrative money management businesses writing
absolutely moronic crap. I'm reminded of the time I interviewed a grizzled Mr.
Dalman, head of US equities at Salomon Bros and PM of their balanced funds.
Valuation to him evidently means low PE, big dividend, duh, looks good. Ken
Fisher evidently now thinks reseaching a stock means looking up its profile in
Yahoo, and Lynch should feel lucky he gave up managing big money a long time

Your point on options is reasonable. However, if I am going to buy one of these
beaten down dogs, I want potential to make 5 times on my money -- otherwise why
take the risk, just wait for a NH with 2-3 times potential, a big dividend and
trivial downside risk. If insiders see 5 times they will be buying in the open

A potential benefit to NOV is that one of the head bureacrats, to whom

All told, with the aging population, the proven invaluable nature and
efficiency of outpatient PT, and possibly a higher percentage of the health
care dollar going to PT, it makes things sound a lot better for NOV than a
quick look at the finances might seem. It's already doubled off its bottom. I'm

Mike, I am not better than anyone else here, but I assure you that if you had a
lot of money invested in 1973-74, some kind of value parameter in a purchase
would be religion not just style. AMZN going from 220 to 10 would be comparable
in today's environment to what a hot stock like University Computing did then.

Requiring some traditional measure of value actually has hurt me in technology
investing where the companies with apparent value often are priced that way
because of poor or deteriorating market positions. I

OK, here's where I go and offend a lot of people. Religion? Style? What's the
difference? I'm sitting here fully expecting AMZN to go to 10. Don't expect
incredulity from me just because I haven't seen it happen before. At some
point, I did give up on my tech ban. Reason being that they are businesses like
any other, and I couldn't justify not valuing them. It's fashionable for value
investors to steer clear, certainly because of Buffett's influence. But it is
possible to invest intelligently there, IMO. I can't just stick my head in the
sand and say Microsoft didn't make a lot of really intelligent investors very
wealthy. Ratios bite. That's gotta be lesson number 1 in tech value investing.
I learned it with one stock - Creative Labs. Applying a little bit of Buffett
to tech isn't heresy or impossible, IMO.

On Novacare, it doesn't seem like it is too hard to get a grip on it. But basic
Yahoo ratios won't do it. The book value is basically all goodwill and crappy
AR. In fact I would argue a conservative estimate of book value is nigh near
negative, if not blatantly negative. It seems it all comes down to what that
last remaining business would earn, and how much somebody else would pay for
it. One could even just make a bet that Medicare funding of PT will indeed be
increased, and know that the day it happens, NOV will jump at least 50%. Not
necessarily a bad bet. I guess this would be a workout.

The psychological and physical damage that a period like those can inflict
often causes people to "swear off" equity investing. Many, including one of my

Jim,

I did go ahead and buy a smallish position in Autodesk today. Used tech money
to do it, as I got rid of 40% of my Apple position just above 48 (the rest I'm
holding onto).

Reading through the SEC filings, Autodesk seems to be a lot more complicated
than one would think. But this is mainly a contrarian play. The stock is now at
the bottom of a years-long trading range, half it's 52 week high, and there is
evidence of significant insider buying the last time it was this low. In fact
insiders seem to reliably buy at this level and sell at double this level over
the last few years. Debt next to nil, a hoard of cash that makes the stock
cheaper than it appears, and a history of tremendous intraquarter order
volatility that repeatedly seems to provide buying opportunities in the stock.
This is another instance of the majority of its shareholders being the wrong
kind. If we're looking for a double in 10 years as the absolute minimum, this
thing is a lock. Right now, it has a quadruple bogey : sia flu, strong dollar,
product transition, Y2K spending slowdown. Expected weakness the remainder of
the year. But if history serves as any guide, Autodesk will survive and grow
yet again. On a ratio basis, FWIW, the stock is at historic lows, especially if
you count enterprise value as the main numerator rather than market cap. It
might hit 22 yet again, but at 24 7/16 I see 10% downside and 100% upside as a
potential long-term play.

Mattel was my other candidate for the Apple money, and it was nearly a toss-up.

As far as round-trippers, I see FINL heading back down. I originally got in at

Re: ADSK, MAT

Re: cash hoard of Autodesk vs. WALL, there's simply no comparison. I know WALL
and its competitors generally have large cash hoards, mainly because their
business/industry segment is disappearing and they've sold off different parts
and there really is no place left to invest in their area. Some of these cos
like WALL and its competitors are better off just changing industries and using
their cash hoard to fund a different business plan, IMO. That's not the case
with Autodesk.

Re: briefing.com's analysis of Autodesk, seems that every time they're in a
product transition, the same exact criticism comes out - no need to upgrade.
Then people go and upgrade anyway as the product gets distributed. And
surprisingly, new biz buys the product too, especially as the product cycle
matures. For really successful software firms with industry-dominating products
(ORCL, MSFT included), such criticism only brings about buying opportunities.
So IMO briefing.com's criticism (echoed/copied from many other sources) is
rather old and known. They're sales are very lumpy, and their quarters are
erratic, no doubt. But while someone might skip one upgrade, they won't skip
many. Because ADSK's customers are very much in very competitive businesses
themselves and can't be caught short-handed against the competition.

Re: Mattel, be aware that the WSJ has a front-page story on them today.
Basically incriminates the CEO as something of an airhead Barbie herself, and
notes how much faith has been lost both among institutions and previous Barbie
faithful. Having gotten my info mainly from the CEO herself, I'm rather
disappointed that she can be so illogical and foolhardy. Makes me doubt her
guidance to shareholders even more. Still like MAT at its lows.

I'd bet you that ADSK will outperform Mattel over the next few years, but I've
already got money riding on it ;) One thing that is helping me a bit is the
tremendous support that ADSK has in the low 20's. I mean, going back years, the
stock has always jumped from this level. I would sit up, pay attention, and
possibly exit the postition if it broke through to new years-old lows.

Funny, I looked at the same thing and didn't come to the same conclusion. In
any case, I'm talking contrarian value here. I'm not saying it's Buffett, and
I'm not saying it's Graham. The stock is down 50% with insider buying at this
level, which happens to be big support going back years. No debt, a quarter of
the share price is cash, and the company has always shaken out of this
recurrent funk that it seems to hit with regularity - precisely because it
leads the industry. Your interpretation might explain why the stock has had
trouble adding big value over time, though. I'll certainly give you that, and

be the last. It makes for good copy, and Jill Barad as the female CEO of a

absurd promise to Wall Street, short-sightedly wrecked the product line to keep
the promise, and then massively broke it anyway. Talk about no credibility. The
article also seems to imply that she has contempt for market researchers,
preferring instead to go with her gut. For a company like Mattel, all I can see
coming of that is ruin. It calls into question the reliability of cash flows, a
big issue given the large debt and acquisition. In this perspective, mattel.com

Mike I strongly disagree re validity of the mattel.com plan. In fact, it seemed
downright mission critical after reading a recent article about Hasbro
Interactive. Excerpt follows to facilitate conversation only. Below is the URL
but I believe it is time-sensitive & only good for a few more days from date of
this post.

Bottom line, the TLC merger is an absolute winner, and leveraging TLC titles
and Mattel brands in a internet venue is a logical and timely extension of the
synergies between Mattel brands and TLC games and market share. To suggest this
was slapped together in some knee-jerk reaction to appease analysts is
nonsensical IMO. The same analysts who have a hold on the stock will climb
aboard the bandwagon again once the TLC merger bears fruit.

I also suspect if the TLC merger never happened WSJ would be torpedoing Jill
Barad all the more as ignoring electronic games and toys...hey, fits the
negative portrayal of her as basically obsessed with the Barbie doll and
nothing but. The fact is the TLC merger did not happen in a vaccum. It is why I
am long the stock and may well add to my position.

http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/153/business/Video_game_wars+.shtml

...But the fast-growing company <<Hasbro Interactive>>, already fending off the
likes off Microsoft
and Sony, faces a new challenge from its old rival Mattel Inc., which last
month completed its $3.5 billion acquisition of Cambridge-based Learning
Co., the nation's second largest maker of entertainment and educational
software.

Now armed with such popular titles as the Carmen Sandiego and Reader
Rabbit series, along with best-selling strategy games Myst and Riven, Mattel
has been transformed overnight into a $1 billion behemoth in the explosive
interactive industry.

''They're players. They've gained a significant amount of market share in a
short time,'' says Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital
Software Association, a trade group representing computer and video game
companies. ''Their acquisition of the Learning Co. is a pretty strong
statement about their commitment to the interactive industry.''.....

....And MattelMedia, the toy giant's interactive division in El Segundo,
Calif.,
seems ready to meet it. Since starting three years ago, the company's on-line
and CD-ROM products have focused mostly on the always-fashionable
Barbie, and Hot Wheels. Still, sales for the division soared to $100 million
last year, from $20 million in 1996, the company said.

Mattel, which posted a $17.9 million first-quarter loss because of sagging
retail sales in its traditional business segments, is now gunning for a bigger
piece of the fast-growing interactive children's and family game market.

Drawing on the technology of Learning Co., Mattel said last month it will
spend $50 million to create a new Internet subsidiary, Mattel.com, which
will bring together its top brands, such as Barbie, Carmen Sandiego, and
American Girl, for both sales and play. Mattel expects total e-commerce
revenues to reach $60 million this year.

''As with all our interactive products, we want to do things that relate to the
basic play patterns of these properties,'' said Glenn Bozarth, a Mattel
spokesman. ''We see a lot of synergy between the Learning Co. titles and
our own brands.''....

3. It is indeed cyclical.
4. There's a doubt in my mind whether the founder isn't trying

That said, I like SCS a lot. It's basically got 9 of the 10 characteristics I'd

now, and I'm hoping to get it cheaper. I put it in the same league as Champion

Your point about options as a real shareholder cost is well taken. Charlie
Munger spent a fair amount of time at the Wesco meeting talking about this -
particularly with SW Companies.

When I do the arithmetic on ADSK, it looks like they award 5% of the stock per
year in options. It appears that most of the management shares are priced in
the $40's. Previous years show much of the overhang from $27, with ~1/2 above
$40. This type of compensation offers the absurdity of a senior partner of
Wilson, Sonsini on the board who is shown owning 44,000 shares of which all but

I read the WSJ article. I was relieved to see it was not an overtly hostile
piece replete with Jill & Barbie analogies. However the message of the article
was clearly "What have you done for me lately" directed to Jill Barad. She is
portrayed as basically having one big score to her credit - devising the
high-end collector Christmas Barbie - and that's it. I do agree Barad & Mattel
clearly overrelied on the collectors Barbies revenue, but can't accept this
simplistic conclusion that this one coup comprises everything Barad's skills
has to offer Mattel.

The TLC merger earned an ever-so-brief and dismissive mention, referring in
passing to Reader Rabbit and Carmen Sandiego as "aging." The article I referred
to in my last post seemed much more informed on the importance of the TLC deal.

Bottom line, I agree with the gist of the article that the burden of proof is
on Jill Barad to execute and dispell the critics' assertions her success so far
is of the one-trick-Barbie's pony :-) variety. I believe the TLC merger is
proof that is not the case.

On SCS, my issues are lack of a catalyst for a higher price (which I have also

The insider buying is impressive! However, it seems that insiders own 91% of

off to institutions and add the risk of going private
at an inadequate premium if the price drops too much. Therefore, I doubt it

You're right about options. They are just another negative to be counted. But
your analogy to the "minutia" of operating leases misses the point. Operating
leases are already accounted for in earnings. Options aren't. It's their
invisibility to GAAP accounting that makes them so insidious. And they are
hurting Microsoft - you just don't see it yet. When Microsoft finally collapses
under its own weight, options will be in large part to blame.

How to quantify the negative value of options? On Autodesk, my methodology was
I believe to look at the cash flow statement and observe that they had bought
back a lot of shares. But the share count had not gone down because of all the
options exercises. So I simply said the cash used to buy back shares is
compensation expense. I don't have the financials in front of me, but that is
what I usually do - I think that was Autodesk. I've never heard of others using
this methodology, but I find the disclosure in the annual report of options
cost systematically low. I have several other methodologies to do this - I
think about option accounting a lot - but this one is my favorite because it
really gets to how much cash is this costing me. (and if they are not buying
back shares, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out how much it would cost to
buy back enough shares to keep the share count constant. That number is the
cost of the options.)

But Mike, I don't think you wanted to say that dilution of 5% a year is
minutia, did you? I agree it is one of many negatives to take seriously, it is
just much more difficult to quantify than other negatives. And it is much
bigger than most people think. And I might add...Mattel executives have fed at
the options trough much more than I would like. Their proxy statement is simply
unacceptable for a Fortune 500 company.

ASDK and options: Munger went so far as to label companies that use off income
statement equity compensation as Ponzi schemes. He noted that they are
operating non-profit businesses. On the other hand he admitted that in the
current environment to keep employees, it is expected that generous options
will be given. He said that if he were operating a SW company, he would be
tempted to do the same.

I framed such questions recently to the CEO and CFO of HNCS - a direct
competitor to FIC. They blew me off, saying that "everybody does it" and "it
doesn't cost the company a thing". When I pointed out that from the
shareholder's perspective you had to back it out as a cost, and the company was
operating as a non-profit. They agreed, and ended the Annual Meeting.

From Munger's point of view - he wants to buy and hold forever. Non-profit
revenue growth isn't interesting. From a trading standpoint, it doesn't matter
unless the music stops.

In the ASDK situation, it appears to me that significant dilution from these
options doesn't kick in until the high 20's, or 30's. Therefore as a trading
vehicle from current level to that upper bound, the options may be irrelevant.
The cash hoard they have is the result of a secondary floated in the $40's to
get favorable tax treatment for their merger. Back it out, and the stock looks
cheap on an historic basis.

The reference universe I follow it in: DASTY (Solid Works), MNS, Bentley, SDRC,

Steelcase...no catalyst. Clayton Homes...no catalyst. I agree fully. I like
catalysts if they're free. They usually aren't.

And I don't know what you'd want as a catalyst on Clayton. This shareholder has
no desire for a change of management or a takeover. Clayton as is earns 17% on
equity year in and year out. As long as earnings continue to go up 12-15% every
quarter, I am very very happy to own a small piece of the business. In time I
will be well rewarded for that, and I bet it will happen way too fast for those
waiting for catalysts to participate.

Steelcase is another story. This is one where you want to watch for catalysts.
You correctly pointed out the biggest issue with the stock. 90% of it is owned
by insiders - there is no liquidity for institions to buy, so they pass it by.
This is one of the rare cases where a secondary offering would be a positive.
If you want to follow Steelcase and look for things to change, just watch
return on capital. The reason I own Steelcase is that I think return on capital
should double, which still would trail the level of its competitors (HNI,
MLHR). These two are excellent companies, and value investors, especially of
the Buffett variety should be calling and ordering their annual reports. But
Steelcase is #1 in the office furniture industry. There is no reason why they
can't earn the same return on capital once they get the discipline of being a
public company. There is nothing wrong with management - now they have new
incentives. And if that happens, the share price triples. This is a 3-5 year
investment for a triple. You heard it here first.

Re: Autodesk, your cash flow options accounting is a bit coarse for this case.

By my calculation of cash flow, they had about 190M in operating cash flow less
38M in cap ex, or about 142M in free cash flow in 1998. They spent $28M buying
back stock last year. By your method that's still $110 mill give or take a few.
But it's wrong.

To be more precise, the latest SEC filing. They spent 22M, 65M and 76M issuing
stock and options for employees in 96, 97, and 98 according to their detailed
cash flows. This would cut 1998 free cash flow in half at least. In the end, I
still see a free cash of about $1.15/share coming out of the company last year.
1197 by this method was $1.12 per share, and 1996 by this method was $0.80 per
share. Not zero by my calculation.

A catalyst for me is something that I can see might happen in the next year to
change the perception of a company from a glass half empty to one half full.
Given the pricing I like to have on these, the expected result is a 50-100%
gain.

On NH, for example, I saw two potential catalysts -- if the industry
did not lose as much money as the stock prices predicted, or we got an
uptick in commodity prices (temporary or not).

On SCS, of course you were joking about something 5 years off being a catalyst.
But that company forecast of sales and operating margins 5
years from now is what caught my attention and, if they do it, the stock will
be a triple as Jim says.

However, because of the stock ownership situation, I will probably require an
exceptional price to buy it, not just a very good one.

Beer plays: Rock Bottom Restaurants....???

Re: Wallace: I considered the beer biz ...(snip)... I haven't dug real deep
into this, so take my comments with a grain.

Ugh...tell me no pun was intended! :-) I agree with you...unless you are buying
a market leader like BUD, or willing to buy Miller owner Philip Morris, ciggies
and all, there is not much here IMO. A lot of wreckage here...Redhook, Pete's,
Sam Adams...some expensive hobbies were funded by shareholders IMO!

That said, I did a quick check on BREW: Rock Bottom Restaurants, once a
high-flying chain of brew-pubs. Trading at $9, there is an approved merger
agreement to buy the company at $10...FWIW, here is the PR:

Rock Bottom Restaurants Enters Into Merger Agreement

PR Newswire - March 19, 1999 08:36

LOUISVILLE, Colo., March 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Rock Bottom Restaurants, Inc.

Hi Mike and all

As you brought me over from the dormat Mattel thread, I will contribute as
probably many on this thread are more to my investing style than some of the
threads I frequent.

Long term Mattel at 24 is a good buy. It is worth a few point pop for a trade
too near term.

Other stocks I consider reasonably price for the long term that I own are:
BA
SLB
COMS
BGP
CPQ
NETA
WIND
All bought low. Just waiting to sell high.

I think I will lurk for a while on this thread. Looks interesting.

Is this the wrong thread to bring up my favorite stock RMBS on? :)

BREW... At this point I'm disinclined to bet on merger consummations. I just
tend to think the fellow on the other side of the trade knows the odds better
than I because I haven't studied the methods and wouldn't put enough into the
individual situations to justify the research. The maximum reward would be
11%...not bad if the deal closes quickly at about that price, but if buyout of
BREW goes flat...
It looks like it was trading a bit above 5 when the deal hit. That's 40+%
downside for 11% upside. Not odds I like in a game I don't really know how to
play.

FWIW. Adding a little to small CMH position. Initiating position in CAB.

I continue to maintain very broad and diverse positions in the real estate and
homebuilding industries. All REIT positions and all real estate companies I've
posted on that I bought, I still own. Ditto for home builders - the stick
builders as well as the manufactured home builders (that would be CMH and FLE
for me).

I'm interested in Building Materials Holdings and Cameron Ashley. They have
three characteristics that appeal to me:

1. They both are relatively cheap (pe/psr/bv).
2. They are distributors. (And I still hold positions in all the distributors
that I've mentioned on SI. --Sold off most TOY though.)
3. I missed Home Depot and am sorry about it still. (And HomeBase) Now here are
two companies (BMHC & CAB) serving the professional market by distribution
(compared to The retail market distributor Home Depot). For the price-to-value
I'll go with these companies (BMHC or CAB), and I think I can live with the
difference in business models (professional vs. retail).

I like BMHC but the price got a little ahead of me. At current price though,
for me, I'll take a CAB. Starting a small position.

James, on SCS: I trust you saw this equivalent of a warning in the latest news:

In recent months, several factors were slowing purchases in office furniture,
Hackett said.

''We think that volatility in corporate profits has made some people suspend
some capital improvements until they see a little
more'' quarter-to-quarter earnings consistency. Hackett said.

Also, customers are limiting changes in their office spaces and systems as they
focus on testing and repairing computers for the
year 2000 computer glitch, he said. Troubled Asian economies and companies
suspending purchases while they absorb mergers
and acquisitions have also constrained the office furniture sales said.

Beer Cos.

Sam Adams is not as bad as some of the others. The current environment is
tough, the business is fragmented and very competitive, and they're having
trouble growing sales, but the company has a terrific beer (take my word for
it). It's the best American brew. The company also has excess cash on the
balance sheet. Subtract out the cash and associated interest and it looks kind
of cheap on earnings. I don't have a position in it right now, but it's on my
watch list for any stock price decline or some positive sales news.

No arguing SAM makes some great beer & ale, but then so does Pete's, as well as
those from Redhook, Killians, brew pubs up and down the street, and for that
matter, anyone who wants to brew as a hobby. Truth be told, anyone who wants to
brew their own beer can do it and if they can follow a recipe, can do a good
job. My .02 on SAM is ...yes, the product is great, but I will continue to
"invest" in increments of $5.99 (for a rack of Sam Adams or Boston Ale :-)

BTW, Mike, my favorite "macro-brew" is Rolling Rock :-) And a very good premium
lager is Three Stooges beer! No I am not kidding: http://www.3stoogesbeer.com

Curly and the Three Stooges Stun Their
Competitors
Curly's Light named "Best Lager" at prestigious industry
competition

WESTWOOD, MASSACHUSETTS, NOVEMBER 18, 1998 -- In a stunning upset
befitting the antics of The Three Stooges themselves, Curly's Light took first
prize for
"Best Lager" at this year's Great Northeast Beer and Cider competition held
recently
in Providence, Rhode Island. Beating established competitors from fashionable
microbrews to industry giants, this newly introduced light beer shocked
industry
participants and judges alike.

Panther Brewing Company of Westwood, MA which makes both Curly's Light and The
Three Stooges Beer, entered the light lager into the blind taste test, and it
was
deemed best of class by a panel of 30 brewers and industry professionals. To
the
attendees surprise, Curly's Light beat out Boston Beer Company's Samuel Adams
Boston Lager and Castle Springs' Lucknow Munich-Style Lager, which came in
second and third respectively. Final results for all categories in the
competition will be
posted on the Internet at www.lovecraft.com.

"This is an important win for us," said Dewey Parsons, president of Panther
Brewing
Company. "It shows that fun and great beer are not mutually exclusive."

The Great Northeast Beer and Cider Competition drew a total of 130 entries in
nine
categories. A panel made up of professional brewers and industry journalists
from
across the country judged the entrants as an estimated crowd of 5,000 sampled
the
many fine beers and ciders.

Panther Brewing Company is located in Westwood, Massachusetts. Their products,
including The Three Stooges Beer and Curly's Light, are distributed at bars,
restaurants, and retailers throughout New England, Minnesota, Florida, and
Kentucky.
Further expansion will soon include New York and Ohio. For more information on

Re: MAT, Three Stooges

Three Stooges beer? I just gotta try it ;0

I'm reposting my post on MAT from the Buffettology thread, as it has
some relevance to some of the discussion here.

Barbie's numbers revisited

I did go through the available information on the pro forma Mattel-TLC
combo. Here's what I found. Not that I believe it twister-proof, and
there is a lot of assumption and missing pieces here for the
determined to pick at. Late last pm, I just didn't have the time (not
that I do now either).

We all know that TLC has had an ambitious M&A program. This has
resulted in a lot of intangible assets to be written off. Moreover,
both Mattel and TLC have undertaken large restructuring charges in the
last few years. The following are rough, as detailed pro forma cash
flows have not yet been provided.

1998 1997 1996
NI 150M -189M 14.6M
Amort 135M 487M 467M

Cash flow 285M 248M 482M
Per share 0.65 0.81 1.31

Charges 130M 344M 12M

Operating
Cash Flow
before charges 414M 641M 493M
Per Share 0.95 1.73 1.34

Return on Equity isn't a good measure here because the debt/equity
ratio is high. And in this case, how much we want to play with
intangibles is questionable, since we all agree that brands are a big
part of this business, and the intangibles likely do represent some
fraction or multiple of real value. Invested Capital was 3.54 billion
at the end of 1998. So ROIC at the end of 98 was about 8% after
charges, 12% before charges. Assuming a similar capital structure in
prior years (a big and probably wrong assumption), the return would've
been 7% and 18% in 1997, and 14% and 14% in 1996.

This is return using operating cash flows, not free cash flows. It
appears that Mattel typically spends about 200M/year in cap ex, and
TLC spends about 25M/year, so that could be deducted from the above.
As well, TLC typically has had tremendous working capital requirements
that have actually knocked back operating cash flow significantly, to
the tune of 90-100M/year at TLC. At Mattel, this has been a negative,
but to a much lesser extent of say 25M/year. As well, Mattel spends
relatively little on stock option and incentive plans, but TLC has
been a big offender in that realm, and discloses that such plans would
have lowered net income by an additional 53M in 1998, 39M in 1997,
and 31M in 1996.

All told, just these "smaller" issues add up to an additional approx
400M/year that comes out of operating cash flow. So cash return on the
capital turns negative for 1998, falls by 2/3 in 1997, and remains
barely positive in 1996.

All said, though, I do really believe Barbie is fine. I kinda got on
the wrong side of Mattel when I was chided for choosing Autodesk over
Mattel. Fact is, I do think there is turnaround possible here. Lord
knows I've invested in companies with good concepts and numbers
worse than these. But, as with Disney, the story is a lot, lot more
than "Mickey is fine."

I think we can also file this as another example of how NI/ROE, as
imperfect as they are, do often reflect the underlying story. Not that
we shouldn't look behind them.

Re Whitman book. Are there any insights that would help evaluate the cmm
bankruptcy. Crimi Mae had positive earnings last quarter and stated in 10Q that
none of their portfolio is in default. The rub is that they have violated
covenants with Merril Lynch among others on their short term borrowings and
must replace these lines of credit. So we have situation with decent assets but
a squeeze that only the expert players can evaluate. My guts instincts tell me

Alan: <<My guts instincts tell me that they will survive>> I just glanced at
CMM, but I concur. The question is less whether they will survive, than whether
the shares are a good value at present level. According to the recent release,
<<The company anticipates filing a reorganization plan by August 2, 1999, which
is the conclusion of the period during which CRIIMI MAE Inc. and two affiliates
have the exclusive right to file a reorganization plan with the court.>>
We'll be in a better position to judge the value of CMM after the reorg plan is
finalized. The release I saw certainly indicated positive equity for
shareholders though. http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/990514/md_criimi__1.html
This is unusual, as often existing shares are diluted to nearly nothing in the
