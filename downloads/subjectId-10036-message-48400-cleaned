Spanish banks face similar pressures. Fitch cut its ratings on the covered-bond
programs of seven Spanish banks Monday, with most now residing in the single-A
category, far below the triple-A standard that was usual precrisis. Of the €239
billion of Spanish covered bonds in its index, Barclays estimates 85% are still
held by foreign investors, mostly in Northern Europe, who might be forced to
sell if there are further downgrades. That would leave Spanish banks even more
dependent on European Central Bank funding.

Spanish Banks may get some short term attention:

<ECB to relax loan rules for Spanish banks
The European Central Bank is expected to give Spanish banks a much-needed boost
with a significant loosening of rules on collateral required to obtain its
liquidity, which could be followed by steps to reduce the role of credit-rating
agencies.
The concession, which could be announced as early as Friday, would allow
Spanish banks to make greater use of asset-backed securities when drawing ECB
funds. The move – coming as European authorities and Madrid draw up plans to
recapitalise the country’s banks – will help to offset a possible liquidity
squeeze caused by downgrades by credit rating agencies.
The
decision by the ECB’s 22-strong governing council is part of a review of
collateral rules aimed at ensuring liquidity continues to flow to sound
eurozone banks – and to reduce its reliance on external bodies such as Standard
& Poor’s and Moody’s.

Flight to Quality - Strong $US implies Safety & Value in U.S. equities
(companies located in the U.S. w/ little to no foreign exposure).

J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP) -NYSE - This one may fit the theme.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=JCP+Key+Statistics

Hi Sergio -

Spain had a pretty successful bond sale this morning but rates were at five
year highs. What surprised me is that most of the buyers of these bonds were
Spanish Banks. So, the banks that are already showing stress are buying the
governments (Spanish bonds) own bonds which have a $100B backstop pledged from
the ECB. There is something wrong w/ this picture.

For me, that's not a signal of strength (or value).

The smart money seems to be running to the $US and as a result we are seeing
commodity prices falling (relative to the stronger $US). So, to me, the value
proposition that seems to be setting up are the U.S. equities that generate $US
and have limited exposure in Europe or in any of those foreign countries that
may be contracting (due to slowing economies) and/or that have currencies that
are falling in value relative to the strong $US.

There are many U.S. equities in the U.S. that are doing quite well. In fact,
many U.S. cities are showing higher tax receipts (ie. higher sales tax
collected) YoY indicating continued growth and recovery. Consumers are buying
local like in Florida, California and many other states. Several Cities have
addressed their unsustainable on going unfunded pension issues (like San Diego
& San Jose).

On the sell offs, I am going to be looking for those U.S. companies that are
generating $US and are locally based and supplying products and services to
local U.S. consumers (at least for now). I expect the U.S. dollar to get
stronger, much stronger over the next 18 months perhaps to the level it reached
in 2001.

<img
src='http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/us-dollar-chart.png'

As a result commodities (including Oil) should fall in value, so I am staying
away from natural resource companies or those companies that buy their inputs
based on long lead time fixed prices. If those input prices fall in value
future EPS and margins will suffer. If/when the U.S. dollar reaches it's
normalized peak value (maybe in 18-24 months), then a different value matrix
for estimating EPS and Forward PE's may be necessary.

Therefore, from my perspective a strong U.S. dollar could provide some
interesting value propositions. One candidate stock that may fit this new theme
is J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP) -NYSE. There is still a lot of
restructuring management needs to do to get sales going again. Many of JCP's
stores are located in those U.S. cities showing a modest sign of recovery. They
have no current PE since they took a large restructure charge but analysts have
their forward PE around 9. For me, it's still a bit early but I would consider
starting a tracking position around $19.00/share.

There are many other U.S. equities that fit in with this theme. Spanish banks
and/or European banks definitely do not.

Maybe you have some candidate stocks that fit this theme.

JCP will likely lose some portion of mutual fund investors because they dropped
their div. Additionally, their market share has been slipping. In a recent
report Credit Suisse warned ...." In the history of the department store
industry, we have not been able to find a situation where sales volumes fell so
quickly and dramatically as we project for JCP in ‘12."

I think that consumers are shopping for discounts and go to stores like DG and
WM or are willing to pay for higher quality items and go to stores like Macy's.
Target looks interesting, although I have not checked out their numbers. TGT
has been attracting customers in new ways.

Some U.S. based ideas from my portfolio:

I like community or local banks right now. Particularly in areas of the country
that are experiencing growth. My best purchase in this sector has been Texas
bank TCBI which I found after doing some research based on one of Paul Senior's
posts.

I like specialty companies that have established a niche and have a long
history of performance for their investors and that pay a dividend to help ease
the volatility in the market.... MSA, SLM are two stocks I own that fit this
category for me. MSA I thought might attract you.

I put a few small caps in my folio that I think are worth waiting for and keep
them as long as I can wait or until they pop. I have SEV and SSRX and have
posted on this thread when I bought them. Both are losing positions for me at
the moment.

Earlier this year or late last year we were talking about investing in apt.
rentals and this theme seems to have become mainstream at the moment. Anyway, I
have several reits in my folio in this area including IRET that I learned about
from you.

My latest purchase is CSX. I think its cheap (value play) and added after Ditch
brought up talk about his interest in choo choo trains.

I doubled down on RGR recently, breaking my own rule. I don't think this is a
value play necessarily but I like a company that sells their product in advance
and they don't have much competition.

On Spanish bonds being bought mainly by the Spanish banks, nothing new here.
The Italians buy the Italian bonds and the English buy the English bonds, etc.
One factor is that the banks are screwed if their country goes under so they
consider it no risk to buy their govt. bonds. And since they are considered no
risk, the banks are not required to hold additional reserves to offset their
investment as they are with other types of loans. And the kicker is that they
get to borrow money at a lower rate from the Euro Central Bank then they loan
out to their govt.

Earnings this year less than last year. At glance, net assets increased, some

My concern with European-based companies is the Euro vs. dollar relationship.
If the Euro (now at $1.255) drops to parity -- as some pundits
postulate/predict/warn? -- and although that might affect earnings positively
or negatively depending in which country products are produced vs. where the
customers' countries are -- I wonder how I would fare if I were to sell

they lost 10% of market share in all their segments, which is huge. Ten think
about the pension liabilities, which have
Grown by ~880M$ which makes me think that bankruptcy is a definite risk, if
they continue on this path.

RE: Nav

I have bought into this company at $29 for my virtual portfolio :) I'm quite
optimistic that Navistar
will not file for chapter 11, and if they do then it is unlikely liquidation
will occur but some sort of restucturing could be possible. I still dont think
it will get to that point to be honest. The company has consistently produced
earnings. It is only now that Navistar is seeing problems and the stock is
getting beat down hard- the stock is selling below working capital! I still
think a take over is possible to be honest although they have just declared a
rights issue or some sort of merger. Carl Ichan has been saying that Oskosh
could merge with navistar- I'm no expert but I just dont see a liquidation
(definitely not trading below liquidating value) happening nor a bankruptcy.
Gabelli, Ichan and Ichan's prodigee are invested and all our value players, so
from a qualitative stand point I do not think that it is in there interests for
a bankruptcy- although I could be wrong. Any other views are welcomed

Imo, you'll just spin yourself if you focus on "intrinsic" value. This term
never comes up that I see in "Intelligent Investor, A Book of Practical
Counsel". You don't need to obsess over "intrinsic" because it's not a number
that's necessary to figure out so as to use as a bogey to tell whether a stock
is overvalued or undervalued.

A company is a thing that does something or has something that is of value.
That thing, the company, has value of itself -- i.e. intrinsic. A 2006 Ferrari
P4/5 Pininfarina also is a thing that has intrinsic value. In my view it's as
difficult to come to consensus on what intrinsic value is for a business as for
the car or anything else.

--------
On the balance sheet, subtract total liabilities from total assets. That gets
you to your equity. If you further subtract from this equity the category
that's listed in total assets that is called "intangible assets", then what you
get is something called "tangible equity". If you divide equity by number of
shares outstanding (as is done in most screening programs) you get "book value
per share", or what I refer to here as stated bv/sh. If you divide "tangible
equity" by number of shares outstanding, you get what's called tangible book
value per share.

This is in general. And sometimes that is good enough. Sometimes not. For
example, sometimes not all liabilities are stated on the balance sheet (e.g.
contingent liabilities). Sometimes, it's good to check that the divisor in
bv/sh is based on "fully-diluted" shares, not just on shares outstanding or
average shares outstanding during the particular year

When companies earn an after-tax profit, and that profit is not all distributed
to shareholders, then usually, that retained profit drops into the category of
retained earnings (an asset sub category) which usually means that book value
per share increases. Which is what Mr. Buffett asks his stockholders to look at
in evaluating his performance/the performance of Berkshire --- that is, how
much is stated book value of Berkshire increasing year after year.

Sometimes this works for looking at other companies too. Sometimes not.
Sometimes sales are not sales in the sense that a deal is done, something is
given and money is received. So not all sales result in earnings that drop
promptly into retained earnings.

Different businesses have their terminology differences. As do analysts.
Sometimes on a value thread, net assets means net current assets (= current
assets - current liabilities). I notice in looking at oil stocks, net assets --
net asset value (NAV) is some weighting of proven/probable/possible oil and gas
holdings adjusted with a discount factor. This is different from the assets the
company has on its balance sheet.

I'm getting tired. Someone else here will reply. Or try another thread like
"Fundamental Value Investing".

Cheap isn't always Good - What's the Real Value Proposition
Watch out for hidden land mines when looking into a company's "intrinsic
value".

(Remember those Blue-Light Specials . . they were not always that good)

Some times it is good to review the "value" metric. For me, I find that I focus
on different areas of the balance sheet depending on: a) the "macro" economic
cycle we are in, b) the current theme I am exploring or c) when I am searching
for "hidden value" gems. Many of my discoveries could be categorized as
"intrinsic" value components. Others could be seen as negative value components
like (1) off balance sheet transactions (remember ENRON & WorlCom) and/or (2)
unfunded liabilities (including pension, pending lawsuits etc - HAL or Corning
w/ asbestos) and/or (3) currency exchange losses (ULTR seems to get hit w/
these Brazilian REAL into $US) and/or (4) assets priced on a mark to market
bases vs stated value (BAC, C, JPM and all of those other TARP borrowers).

I have found there is no one absolute measure of a company's intrinsic value
(for me) as accounting methodology allows for "tricks" and/or a 2nd set of
books to deceive if that is what the company wants to do. Why have we seen GAAP
vs Non-GAAP accounting? I prefer GAAP and maybe one time restructuring charges
but never understood why investors put up with Non-GAAP accounting w/ so called
one time charges that seemed to appear ever quarter for years (ie. BRCD).

After over 25 years reading annual reports, the simplest ones that were easy to
understand and were very straight forward generally reflected the "best"
companies. No tricks or funny line items. Management just told you the current
state-of-affairs of the company, both bad and good. I always found the letter
to the shareholders in the annual report worthwhile to read. For me, if the CEO
can explain their operation(s) (what they have achieved during the year and
what they want to change in the upcoming year) in no more than two pages is my
simple measure that things are under control.

In the current environment, I am focused on the "quality" of earnings, currency
exchange losses/gains, unfunded liabilities, LT Debt and exposure to falling
commodity prices. Looking forward 18-36 months, how is the company set up for
rising interest rates. Are they generating a lot of cash now, paying down debt
and/or buying cheap assets with their huge cash reserves. Do they even have
huge cash reserves (if not why not)? These attributes signal to me that these
company's are value candidates and I want to own them. It's going to be the
surviving companies that make it through this next macro economic cycle I want
to own. Cheap isn't always good. It's the "quality" companies you want to buy
on the cheap.

I estimate or guesstimate or presume margin of safety in a number a ways
depending on what the company's business is. I never try to calculate something
called "intrinsic value". It's not necessary to figure out what a company's
intrinsic value might be in order to have a feel for what margin of safety
might be.

"...intrinsic value is not something that comes up at all in the intelligent
investor (it isnt meant to be too complicated) but intrinsic value does come up
in Security Analysis."
If you were to follow Dr. Graham's later work then and be an "intelligent

follow Dr. Graham's "Intelligent Investor".

"Retained earnings is what buffett means when he talks about the cash that can

I don't know. I'll say, maybe that's an approximation. Possibly too simplistic.

"Buffett states that focus on the balance sheet is more effective when working

More effective than what? More effective than with working with larger pools?
More effective than focusing on the income statement? Not clear to me.

Hi EddyRiquelme -

My reply is in the form of an example of a current value candidate stock I am
researching. It does not exactly address your question on calculating the
company's intrinsic value but rather what I look at for a "margin of safety"
not necessarily as reported by the numbers published in their 10K report
report.

GT Advanced Technologies Inc. (GTAT) - Is this a "no brainier" value Buy?
http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9NDMzNTExfENoaWxkSUQ9
DUyMDgzfFR5cGU9MQ==&t=1
http://www.gtat.com/index.htm

The more I think about the question of "value" and what is the absolute way to
measure that, I am coming to the conclusion that one formulaic approach (w/ a
binary result: Yes - Undervalued vs No- Not undervalued) just does not happen.

With all of the accounting tricks, scrupulous cheating managements (the Chinese
accounting acceptable practices come to mind) and GAAP vs Non-GAAP reporting,
just makes me cautious especially when looking for an investment with a "margin
of safety".

Now more so than in the 70's or perhaps the 80's, I am skeptical when things
look too good to be true. That's why I do not put too much into those absolute
balance sheet numbers and/or those one time excellent revenues that were just
released.

Maybe this is because I stepped on one too many land mines when I thought the
value proposition was too good to be true. Therefore, when looking for a margin
of safety, I now look at a lot of the intangibles that are outside the reported
numbers in the 10K. These include: (a) does the company do business in China,
(b) who are their top 10 customers, (c) how long has the company been in
business, (d) do they have 10 years of positive earnings, (e) is the operation
diversified, (f) does management have a vested interest in the company and many
more items that I roll into my "buy" decision.

Here is an example of a company I have been studying as a possible value buy.

PE is around 3.5, the company has over $3.05/share in cash, $1.8B in back
orders, 2nd generation technology ready to deploy that is 15%-20% more
efficient . . . all is good.

What's wrong w/ this picture? Top 10 customers all located in China. All
revenues reported reflect underling contracts w/ these companies w/ no detail
on receivables, returns if not sold (or wanted by larger customers), who eats
the potential losses of the finished product when it becomes obsolete from next
generation products?, Do those standing orders really have value or could they
be a huge future liability if/when manufactured and returned to GTAT because
they could not be sold?

W/O seeing the details of those top 10 supplier contracts and if they are
enforceable in China, those future revenue streams (and perhaps current revenue
streams) are suspect to me. The positive is w/ their next generation technology
new orders are coming from Europe (including Germany) and India.

This looks like a no brainier value proposition. Here is what Motley Fools
think ( http://goo.gl/0wPUH ). I am still skeptical especially when management
will not use some of that cash to buy back shares.

What's your take?

P.S. I have been using the Graham number recently to determine fair value.
Graham felt that using this approach (be advised that 10 yr positive EPS, use
TBV rather than BV and PE<=15 must be used as constraints in doing the
calculation) provided a "fair" level of safety in all types of markets.

ha! Paul point taken. With all due respect, tech companies can be value plays.
however, i will look into it further.

but with retail sector under duress and at the same time showing slagging
growth, anyone who helps them save costs, automate their systems will be a
great play given the current restructuring cycle. These guys are well placed
for that.

The company is just more food for thought for people looking at stuff. When i

GTAT - the numbers look so good, they are hard to believe. 45% gross profit in
an incredible tough market like solar and crystal growth equipment does not
look credible to me. Furthermore,GTAT has a very small manufacturing footprint,
almost none of which is in China which seems to imply that they buy most of
their components. Compare this to Centrotherm, which is in a similar business
and is struggling mightily. Seems not credible to me.

Hi Paul,

Thanks for the help, and I take your point; I need to do further research then.

Apologies for not being clear, I meant smaller pools of money compared to
larger pools of money, so I'm not really sure how the amount of money affects
one's focus; that is, according to buffett when dealing with larger pools of
money focusing on the income statement is more effective than focusing on the
balance sheet. The opposite is true when dealing with smaller pools of money.
Why though?

Re: GTAT

I am not quite sure why they made the name change and then did a secondary
offering. When the dust settled it looks like they have some notes due in 2013.

<blockquote>From their 10K "...On August 8, 2011, we changed the name of the
Company to GT Advanced Technologies Inc., and such change was effected pursuant
to Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
by the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company into the Company. At
the same time, we changed our NASDAQ stock ticker symbol to GTAT
..."</blockquote>
<blockquote>In September 2010, the Company completed a secondary offering of
11,000 shares of common stock by GT Solar Holdings, LLC. At the same time the
Company completed an additional secondary offering of 14,000 shares of common
stock by GT Solar Holdings, LLC, such sale was made to UBS AG and UBS
Securities LLC in connection with an offering by UBS AG of its Mandatorily
Exchangeable Notes due 2013.</blockquote>
---------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe it was a slick way to pull money out of the business. That $3.08/share in
cash may already be obligated to pay off those exchangeable notes due in 2013.

For me, just too many restructuring parts w/o a detailed explanation.

I did notice that Jurgis Bekepuris started a position in GTAT 6/4/2012 w/ the

Hi Grommit -

It looks like all commodities are selling off due to fears that China and other
world economies are slowing down. I have a GTC order in for CLF at $38.50/share
(a low ball offer). I am also trying to sell off (small sales) other resource
positions I hold that still have gains. These have/are long term holds.

I think I can buy back many of the good resource companies at much lower prices
in 6-18 months.

I am building my shopping list too. CLF, CUM.TO (CPPMF) below $3.00/share,
AUNFF (below $0.80), RIC (below $5.00/share) and many others. I need to be
careful that the cost of production is not higher than the eventual price of
the commodity.

The Candian Oil Sands have the highest cost of production so SU and COSWF may
seem cheap as Oil falls but really could get much cheaper when they have to
shut down production to stop the large losses.

Therefore, SU is my favorite and if Oil falls to $40/barrel (perhaps worst case
w/ maybe a 10% probability), I will double my position if I can get it below
$20/share. Stock is selling now at $26.83/share with oil at $78.25/barrel. The
longer oil remains low, their hedges run out. I believe their cost of
production is around $65/barrel (vs XOM has some oil at a cost of $15/barrel).
It's all about where their marginal cost is and how long the market price of
oil stays low.

This is the same thinking for coal, iron ore, copper, silver and gold. You must
watch the price of the commodity as I believe many of these prices have a lot
more to fall. This is what I watch and track that help me decide where we are
in the commodity cycle http://goo.gl/71Xo ,
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------

I did buy some EXLpB and have an order in for Excel Trust, Inc. Common Stock
(NYSE: EXL). I think it is a safe place to hide as their properties are located
in SO. CA and have a reasonable debt profile. SO. CA is still growing and still
spending money at the local malls.

JCP is on the same pathway as Montgomery Wards I think. Towards oblivion.

My impression is that JC Penneys and others like it make a lot of their profit
off jewelry with 300% mark-ups. That requires foot traffic. Sales bring foot
traffic. Everyday low prices do not. I checked out a JC Penney recently. Some
of their kitchen stuff was decently priced but no one was in the department.
Clothing was cheap but of poor quality.

One thing JC Penney has is some real estate. One might think of Penny's, Macys,
Dillards as being a REIT paired to a retailer. On that basis they might seem
fairly priced. However, that class of REIT's is not a good class I think. Big
boxes like Circuit City, Toys are us, Best Buy, Barnes and Noble, Borders have

Hi Geoffrey. In 2010 Vornado Realty took on 3 million shares of JCP and at that
time the value of JCP's real estate holdings was about $14/share. So, at
today's stock price, assuming a flat change on real estate, you get the retail
biz and furniture for less than book value.

Using these numbers, JCP does offer value, but I still think it will get
cheaper than it is now before value hunters step in. On the other hand, maybe

Hi Paul - /profile.aspx?userid=455172 one of the shrewd value resource
investors on SI provided me w/ this report.

<u>Gold Mine Cost Report</u>

http://www.virtualmetals.co.uk/pdf/ABNGCQ111.pdf

The Gold Mine Cost Report is produced as part of a joint venture between ABN
AMRO Bank N.V. and VM
Group/Haliburton Mineral Services. It surveys the gold production cash costs of
111 gold mining companies.

From pg-3- of the report:
<blockquote>Average gold mine cash costs rise 1.8% to $620/oz in Q1 2011.
<u>One obvious factor in this rise in production costs over the past few years
has been the weak US dollar</u> – in which gold is priced.</blockquote>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This should help you determine a base line for the miners you follow. I also
see it as a hedge since many of the Canadian miners will see a net lower cost
of production if/when the $US gets stronger. Therefore, for me, the value
proposition is not only owning a profitable mine at book value w/ a lot of
cash, but should become more profitable as production costs decrease due to a
rising $US.

smartphone platforms (Windows Phone, Android (mostly), Apple (as announced))

Hi EKS. Let's look at your post mathematically. If you set those parameters,
then a program can pick it out. Things change and in this age of computerised
trading isn't it more worthwhile looking for paradign shifts or
disruptive technologies to find true value?

<blockquote>A company would have to meet seven of the following ten
criteria</blockquote>To even have a chance of satisfying seven criteria, the
company has to be profitable.

If company is profitable, the chance of it satisfying criteria 4 and 5 is
negligible. There are some Chinese (and some Japanese - yes, Clownbuck?)
companies that are profitable and satisfy criteria 4 and 5. In USA, you'd be
lucky if you found couple microcaps that satisfy this.

So we are down to eight criteria with seven to be satisfied. Now we go to
criterion 10 - there are very few companies that satisfy this in 2008/2009
frame, so we are left with seven criteria, all of which have to be satisfied.
To satisfy criterion 3, company has to pay dividend, so you have to look only
at dividend paying companies with yields greater than 2/3 of AAA bond...

On the positive side, bonds yield almost nothing, so criterion 1 is easy and
criterion 3 is somewhat easy for divvie paying companies. Criterion 2 is
somewhat easy too, companies are still at low PEs. Criterion 6 is easy, since
most companies are delevered. Criterion 7 is IMHO worthless - I never
understood fascination with current ratio - it makes sense only for companies
close to bankruptcy, not for healthy companies. Healthy company can always get
cash, so current ratio is pretty much meaningless for anything that is not
Kmart...
Criterion 8 is easy for unlevered companies. Criterion 9 is passable.

So overall, you may be able to find some companies that satisfy criteria
1,2,3,6,7,8,9. Might be able to swap 10 for 3 or 7 for a few cos, though not
many.

Paul,

RIC looks to me like a pot of gold (no pun intended). Do you like Barrick Gold
(NYSE: ABX) at the current price levels? The CEO being ousted could have been
the catalyst that led to the continuing slide and you it seems that we know
where we stand with Barrick.

Have you heard of Nevsun Resources (NYSE: NSU)? Financials look enticing -
approximately 40% of the book value is in cash, profit is up in the first 3
months of the year although I am a bit suspicious of the level of the capital
expenditures, seems awfully low compared to peers. Nevsun has diverse staff
too: 751 full-time employees and 179 part-time in Eritrea (I admit I needed a
map to find where Eritrea's location - it's between Ethiopia and Sudan) and a
total of 8 employees in Canada - Berkshire Hathaway Omaha headquarters watch
out, Nevsun runs efficient operations. And finally, a letter from Statman,
Harris & Eyrich, LLC which among other things says:

"(i) Nevsun’s mining at the Bisha Mine resulted in a material amount of waste
rock rather than gold ore; (ii) gold ore and gold from the Bisha Mine was
materially less than the amount estimated by Nevsun’s model, and defendants
knew or had reason to know this based on data routinely collected from the
Bisha Mine throughout the Class Period; (iii) Nevsun was progressing through
the ore body much more quickly than planned in order to maintain gold
production at a rate that would not reveal to investors that the amount of gold
at the Bisha Mine was materially less than the Company’s model; (iv) the
Company was aware that its model was materially defective because the actual
amounts of gold mines at Bisha did not reconcile with the Company’s model
previously disseminated to the investing public; and (v) Nevsun materially
overstated its gold reserves at the Bisha Mine.On February 7, 2012, Nevsun
issued a press release disclosing: (i) that it had materially overstated gold
reserves at the Bisha Mine by 30-35%; (ii) that the amount of gold to be
produced in 2012 would be about half of what Nevsun previously represented to
investors; and (iii) that it would restate its proven reserves. Following this
news, Nevsun’s common shares fell from a closing price of $6.34 per share on
February 6, 2012 to close at $4.40 per share on February 7, 20.12."

NikhilJog,

I just find water operations very interesting- it's one of those resources that
could be a focal point in the future. Ecolab (NYSE: ECL) is expensive to me.

I'll give you another Baupost investment that I thought is interesting.

What casino game gives the experienced player the best odds against the house?
I won't leave you in suspense, it is blackjack.

What game then has the worst odds? Slot machines, which are based on tallies
rather than probabilities and the company is Multimedia Games Holding Company
(NASDAQ: MGAM). Don't check the price, but read the annual report.

"A company would have to meet seven of the following ten criteria (as laid out
in Security Analysis) before Graham would consider it a cheap stock:)"

This may be valid today. In his last years though, Dr. Graham, as regards
building a portfolio, did not advocate "elaborate techniques of security
analysis in order to find superior value opportunities".

In answering the question, "Can you indicate concretely how an individual
investor should create and maintain his common stock portfolio?", Dr. Graham
gave two examples of his suggested approach: The first was selecting stocks "at
less than their working-capital value, or net current asset value". This
technique he said, "appears severely limited in its application".

The other approach "consists of buying groups of stocks at less then their
current or intrinsic value as indicated by one or more simple criteria. The
criterion I prefer is seven times the reported earnings for the past 12 months.
You can use others - such as a current dividend return above seven per cent or
book value more than 120 per cent of price, etc... I have every confidence in
the...merit of this general method based on (a) sound logic, (b) simplicity of
application and (c) an excellent supporting record. At bottom it is a technique
by which true investors can exploit the recurrent excessive optimism and
excessive apprehension of the speculative public".

conversation with Benjamin Graham"

Difco. I've not heard of NSU before. This one I would have to look at closely
to understand why I'd want to add it to my small basket of gold stocks.
Earnings seem fabulous now, but this year seems to be the only year in the
company's past in which the company has had positive earnings. Need to know why
and if such good earnings would likely be sustainable. I'm kind of overwhelmed
right now with what I believe are opportunities in the market --- I don't have
energy for stocks like NSU that seem obviously questionable and require time
and effort to understand the risk vs. reward with them. Certainly am willing to
listen though to your's or anyone else's opinion here on why they would be
buying the stock, if they are.

"Do you like Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) at the current price levels?" That's an
interesting question since I did say in the post that I added again to my
position today. Maybe my 25th or more add since I began buying in March at $42.
So I will say this, actually, no, I don't like ABX at the current price levels.
With trepidation and reluctance, I want the stock to go down further so I can
buy more-- or better, I want the stock to move up to where I might show green
instead of the red that's now on so many of my purchases. I don't want the
stock to stay where it is (at current price level. If you are asking me whether
I might suggest the stock now as a buy for you or anyone else, decide for
yourself. So far I seem to be wrong with my original small buy and 21 of the 25
or so adds I made to it.

Hi pcyhuang -

From that list there is only one stock I own. It is Halliburton Company (HAL)
-NYSE. I have owned a small position in HAL for over 10 years. There may be one
or two others I might consider but several I would still pass on. My initial
thought was that more might show up on a stock screen because of the historical
low 10 year Treasury rate of 1.66%.

Paul Senior posted some additional Graham investing criteria that also may
yield some additional candidate stocks. The relevant thing is because of QE3
and "Operation Twist", 10 year bond rates are at historical lows (the lowest in
a generation). Some of these companies using Graham's screens may yield some
once in a generation candidate picks.

Kronos Worldwide Inc. (KRO) -NYSE
Anglo American plc (AAUKY) - closed out shares bought in 2009 @ $10.47/share

Started a tracking position in this one. Must be some end of quarter selling. I
calculated the Graham No. at $24.36/share so there should be some level of
safety at $15.43/share.

Will add more shares to this one at or below $15.00/share.
