All: We either are in the process or have missed out on a great stock
move in the last week. Would someone else take a look at the chart
and fundamentals of this stock and tell me whether to:
a) buy on a pullback if one occurs, say down to $1.00, especially
if the overall market pulls back on Monday.
b) buy the stock at the opening on Monday.
c) forget the stock, as it has already gone up more than 200% on an
intraday basis from low to high.

If the answer is a, then how low would you think the stock will pull
back? Note since the annual consumer electronics show is coming up
at the Las Vegas Convention Center on Jan 6-9 and this company will
have a big display there, it will undoubtedly generate media interest
and cause the stock to go up even more. So time is short and it may not
pull back.

There is a lot of news available out on Yahoo or at the site I mentioned
earlier in one of my postings here.

No, I do not own any of this stock yet.

Oh, the stock name is Curtis Mathes, CRTM, currently trading at
1 7/16.

Can someone else take a look at CRTM and offer their opinion.

Thanks, Harlan

Traditionally, a good leading indicator for the business cycle
is the Dow Transports. The theory is that if the economy is slowing,
then the transports will feel it first as people reduce capital investment. If
the economy is recovering, then the transports
would recover first. Basically, If I'm Amoco and I'm going to surprise everyone
with great earnings, then the companies shipping my product are going to report
great earnings earlier. People have
panned this recently as the economy has shifted its mix from goods to
services and as techs have come to dominate the market, but
it might be something to watch.

Mike, here's where I think you are wrong:

1)Everyone preach buy, hold, patience. To me, as I read the SI threads, I don't
see this. TA people - aren't they jummpers who will deflect the moment their
charts tell them? Look at all the option players - that can't be buy (stock)
let alone hold, patience.

2) Raging bull for 10 years. That would make it leap over '87, '90. I don't
feel like I've been in a 10 year raging bull market. And I was in the market at
these times.

3) I know people who were in in'69. If they had a significant loss in '83 it's
news to me. Maybe because they were in before '69 and after '83 - they stuck
with their stocks or planning. If you are trying to make the point that we are
now at a top, similar to '69 and a subsequent drop is inevitable and will be
similiar to the drop and extent of '83, I say value investing and time (Doc's
post) will overcome it. There's a risk to be totally out of the market when it
goes down. One thinks one saves money, but one risks misjudging when to get
back in. The 25-75% rule of Ben Graham applies IMHO.

4) Plenty of people thought stocks went up and down in the 1940's and 50's
There were bull and bear markets in airplane manufacturers, movie
makers/theatres, television mfgers too, I think. Things I read about the period
indicated that people thought stocks were risky - they could go down (and up);
therefore they wanted a premium to invest - like a larger dividend yield than
bonds were paying. Maybe the DJ didn't move much, but there was action for
those who played the market of stocks.

5) Well the market can crash, and it probably will, and possibly stay down. But
where else can people put their investment money that looks better from a 20
year view? Real Estate, Bonds? There're just too many new capitalists
world-wide entering the market place with too many good ideas, and too much
capital for stocks to stay down for 20 years. Couple that with government help
- like lowering capital gains taxes, partnering with businesses vs. adversarial
- - I say times are indeed different now, and the best is yet to be.

6) Mike, I haven't meant my comments as a personal attack.

Paul,

1) I guess we just disagree. Currently, the theme is, if you
are a prudent investor, you buy and hold, IMO.
2) 87,90 were just corrections in the overall bull market with no
real effect on the economy, IMO
3) I'm just going from my reading about the stock market from
this century. I obviously wasn't there. But what I've read
indicates the high inflation combined with the crash-at-first-then-
stagnant market of the 70's made the market even worse than
29-32 in terms of investment returns. We are set up for a scenario
where the market will crash (not correct, but crash) if we have
sustained upward movement in rates. This would be doubly bad for
equity investments, and similar to the 70's after the go-go period.
4) I apologize for taking your comments as personal attacks.

In response to your request of an opinion:

There has been significant activity in the stk over the last few days and
therefore has shown some appreciation. No one can tell you your RISK tolerance
or understand your financial circumstances better than you.If you have the
capital, I say there are much better opportunities available in which to
invest. I have found that most investors put more time into buying a car, than
spend time selecting the appropriate investment to attain their goals. If you
need additional info on this particular security and have a fax no., then email
it to me & I will fax you some of my research. In closing let me say that an
alternative idea would be to invest additional capital availble in an
international security (ie ADR or ADS). Diversification is an investors best

Hi Mike,
I have a general question for everyone. I own a group of stocks all of which I
like. As in many portfolios, some are doing quite well right now, while others
are stagnating, and still others have been loosing ground.
If I need to sell shares periodically to put my neice through college, is it
wiser in the long run to sell some stock that is doing well, stagnating or
losing ground? Which do I choose to sell?!
Thanks for your ideas on this. Denise

Denise:
Have you checked with your tax adviser for tax consequences?? You may be able
to donate your winner stock to your niece or the college, maybe avoiding
selling and paying tax gains?? On the other hand, selling losers might give you
a write-off and be better.
I think sell decisions could be based on one's philosophy of portfolio
management. I assume each stock added to the portfolio is thought to be a
winner when bought. But how soon? If you view purchases as planting vegetable
seeds in a garden, then there is an expectation that some stocks are ripe for
picking, some are dormant and that's okay, and some must be pruned because
they've failed to sprout. If you can tell where you are on the continuum, you
can maybe decide which stocks to sell. Anyway, this sometimes helps me. Selling
is always tough. I've found that the common wisdoms don't much help, although I
do like "let your winners run and sell your losers" and do not like: "you can't
go broke taking a profit" - especially for growth situations rather than value
plays.
Another thought process you might consider is mentally selling your entire
portfolio. It's coming up on the new year, cash out, total the winnings and
losings, look at the $ and ask yourself, "okay, what stocks of all the stocks
that I know of, will I purchase right now at these current prices?" The stocks
that you leave out of your list or rank low.... maybe those are the ones you
really should consider selling out from your portfolio.
And for a completely different response: You say you like your stocks. So keep
them all and get rid of your niece! (joke). Paul Senior

my portfolio like a garden. That seems like a good way because I like to think
of it as a useable tool. Also, I like to garden. I will think of my stocks more
in that manner when it comes time to take money out.
I don't know if you follow it, but I would like to know your opinion on Nike. I
bought some for my 17 year old son recently. The reason I find it interesting
is that although it just had a great quarterly report, Motley Fools does a YPEG
analysis and has a negative long term perspective for the stock. This compares
to Greentree Financial Services which has a glowing long term perspective from
Motley Fools. I went with my own analysis and bought Nike. Plus I wear their
clothes so I'm supporting my son's financial future.... (Do you think I should

Harlan,

I took a look having never been to the Whistle Stop, and to tell you the truth,
being a Motley Fools fan. Searching around, I found their current list of "Hot
Stocks" and noted that the last one they placed there was Acres Gaming Inc.

First, I looked it up in InvestQuest and saw that they had a 10K report as of
30 Sep 96. Looking down through it I noticed things I liked, particularly a lot
of money spent on research and development, and the fact they formed a
strategic alliance with International Gaming Technology in Aug 96. But reading
further, I did not like some of the discussion on stock offerings on page 29.

Second, I looked up the stock in stockmaster and noticed it has gone from 3 up
to 20 this year and about Nov 1 dropped down to 11. Interesting. For a variety
of reasons, I did not like this.

Third, I looked up the stock in Infoseek and found no noticeable news about it
in the last several months. I did note what in my mind was at least one
questionable individual promoting the stock.

Having completed this basic research, I would wonder why Whistlestop has put
this on their "Hot Stock" list. THEY never said why. I can't find anything in
the news, and I'm not sure the stock didn't get run up over the year by
momentum investors and has now dropped to a reasonable price level. Or, in fact
the price will continue to drop to a more stable level. I certainly do not see
why this stock should make a sudden upturn again.

I guess the bottom line to me is...YOU need to do the research yourself and
verify to yourself that a stock is worthy of your money before you take the
advice of Whistlestop or anyone else and invest. At this point in time, I would
need a lot better information than what I've seen before I'd invest in their
latest "Hot Stock."

Denise,

Welcome to the thread. I hope you are having a nice holiday. I don't
mean to usurp Paul's response, but here's an additional opinion on
Nike. An awful lot of the casual investors I know have been asking
me about Nike in the last few months. For this reason, given my
contrarian nature, I have tried to ignore it.

But Nike does stand out. PE 26, last Q EPS +50% on an 11% upside
surprise, very manageable debt/equity, only about 48% institutional
ownership (surprisingly small for such a well-known company -- does
anyone have an idea why?), currently in a basing formation (having
recently bounced off its 200d MA), brand name + new overseas markets +
proven ability to outlast the competition. Definitely more of a
growth pick than a value pick. PE is a little rich, and NKE may
be already fairly valued, but I for one am watching it.

Here's a potential strategy -- Nike is currently basing near all
time highs. Wait for it to tell you which direction it wants to
go. Buy the day it sets a new closing high on a volume upswing.
Given the current basing formation, such a day should make a long
term up-move a high probability. Think of the couple points you
lose (vs. buying now) as insurance against a potential market downdraft.

Just my opinion,

Mike

Mike,
Thanks for your ideas. Paul, I'm still interested in what you think! NIKE is
interesting. Looking at its chart for the year shows a 2 for 1 stock split in
October, then the stock dived about 10 points. Part of this dive however I
believe was due to some well known stock forecaster saying that NIKE's
soon-to-be-releasded quarterly earnings would be below estimates.
However, when NIKE announced its last quarterly earnings a week ago, they were
well above the estimates. This makes me think that someone may have been trying
to push the stock down so they could buy low and make a good profit as it
started up again.
NIKE is about at 61 right now and has had an all time high of 64 before it
dived when the stock split. I think it's going to get back to 64 and then
there's a strong possibility it will climb higher based on its last superb
quarterly report.
Interestingly also, I like what I see of NIKE in the women's clothing sections
in stores. I like it enough that I spent about $100 on myself on NIKE products
during the Christmas season. I think with such great product lines, their
revenues will continue to grow at a good pace, and thus their stock also. I've
already bought the stock for my 17 year old son and think I will enjoy watching
it with him. It gives him a good reason to be interested in looking at graphs,
reports, P/Es and such.
Have an enjoyable holiday season. Denise

To Denise: I regards to your question on which securities to sell.

Sell the losers. The loss is a deductible expense on your Federal Income Tax in
the year of the sale as long as you don't repurchase the identical security
within 30 days
(ie you can repurchase it AFTER 30 days without consequences). Your loss will
be reduced by the tax bracket in which you are incl: (ie 15%, 28%, 38%). These
percentages may be off a little for middle income & high income individuals,
BUT they are pretty close. In laymans terms: you cannot deduct the loss
directly against ordinary income (income from Working or from Interest)--You
file a Schedule(Sch D) with your Federal Income tax return due by April 15th.
If you have sold securities with capital GAINS this year (1996), you subtract
the Loss from the previous Capital Gain transaction. Anytime you sell a
security you have a taxable event.

Date:12/26/1996 4:21:00 PM
From:Doc

That is a good question which requires a complex answer which is rooted in
Economics. History shows that the Federal Reserve's ability to keep the rate of
growth of the money supply (M1,M2,M3) within its predetermined target range has
been relatively POOR. But interested parties should keep in mind that there is
more to monetary policy than the determination of the growth rate of money. For
one thing, the "OPTIMAL" growth rate of money is NOT easy to define because the
ultimate GOALS of monetary policy (low unemployment, price stability, growth in
the economy, balance of payments equilibrium) may be in CONFLICT. In addition,
the lag time between implementing a change in monetary policy and its effect on
the economy make the notion of "OPTIMAL" quantity of money very difficult to
APPLY in practice. A favorite FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) tactic is to
manipulate the total level of reserves held by banks, S&Ls, and credit unions.
In so doing, the Fed controls the supply of money that financial institutions
have for making loans. A bank with more reserves than it needs can lend some to
a bank that's temporarily short of reserves. Borrowing to boost their reserves
allows banks to satisfy their customer's cravings for CREDIT; lending out extra
reserves lets banks that are flush with cash earn money on their otherwise idle
excess. The interest charged for these overnight loans is called the Federal
Funds rate. The Fed affects that rate by manipulating the level of reserves via
huge purchases or sales of U.S. Treasury securities. The Fed SELLS Treasury
securities to one or more of the 40 banks or brokerage firms that act as
primary dealers. Reserves at the buyer's bank are marked down (debited) to pay
for the transaction. The bank makes fewer loans, competition for the available
money heats up and short term-rates should rise. Thus, with less money
available in the economy, the federal funds rate should rise and short-term
interest rates should follow. My ORIGINAL SCENARIO put a little more concisely.

As far as what I watch to determine clues to the direction of interest rates,
let me tell you a story. In 1988, Fed Vice Chairman Johnson indicated what he
thought was the proper manner in which to conduct monetary policy. The evolving
CONSENSUS among Board members was that they should consider 1> the yield curve,
(see Wall Street Journal Money and Investing Section) 2> the value of the
dollar to other national securities (see Nightly Business Report; Wall Street
Journal), and 3>commodity prices (CPI--see ticker CNNFN during market hours). I
watch these areas closely.

Let me further substantiate my reasons for concluding that interest rates will
rise in the first quarter of 1997. At some very low interest rate, virtually
everyone becomes convinced that the market rate of interest is below the
natural rate of interest and bonds are considered EXTREMELY RISKY. Money
becomes far superior as an asset at this low interest rate. As a result, any
increases in the real money supply are held by investors and consumers, and the
interest rate will NOT fall in this liguidity trap (ie my original post:
Greenspan has backed himself into a corner).

Let me conclude my post by saying: 1) economics is NOT an exact science; 2)
Opinions are like noses everybody has one. Happy NEW YEAR.

I am selecting Penney as a stock for a value portfolio. For this portfolio, I
define "value" as meaning a favorable risk/reward relationship- that is safety
of principle and adequate return (Ben Graham words and meaning, but not a Net
Net Net play). Like a lot of value stocks, I think there's a lot NOT to like
about this JCP. I think for some (maybe me too) it's the shame factor:
Everybody knows Penney's - what a dull? co. and stock? This is what we are
coming up with? And for people who post on SI? As the fifth largest US
retailer, it isn't even dominant in its market. Sales have only been growing 5%
over the past five years. Any place else seems like a better opportunity.
Financial World (12/16/96) sneeringly says that Penney has bought Eckherd drugs
because retailing is so crummy and so the purchase is the only way to get some
earnings. I have not read one favorable word about the Company or the stock in
any newspaper or magazine EXCEPT that ---- like Mike Burry has noted!! -- a few
professional investors who call themselves value investors, have mentioned it
(sometimes more than one time) or put it in some lists of stocks they like.

For example, there are:

James O'Shaughnessy, author of "What Works on Wall Street"
Barrons 12/96

John Fields, Delaware Decator Fund, Barron's 12/3/96

Post #70 of this Mike Burry Value Investing Thread (12/10/96)

Tony Spare, Spare Bischel & Assoc., Barron's 10/96 (when JCP was at $54), also
in June `96 Institutional Investor Magazine.

Nancy Tengler, Los Angeles Times 12/96 who GOT MY
ATTENTION WITH THESE WORDS........ "Most attractive retailer on a relative
dividend yield basis; nation's largest retailer of Nike products and diamonds;
largest operator of beauty salons; as cheap as it's ever been; other times this
low have been followed by double and triple stock price performance over 2-3
years."

Ah Nuts. I am so embarrassed with writing this. I feel like everybody is
thinking "old geezer touting an old geezer stock" and my heart cries that I
don't want it to be true but maybe it is true.
Anyway, let me wise you up to relative dividend yield. It compares (it ratios)
current JCP dividend to a base dividend (like from the S&P 500). For Penney the
ratio now would be somewhere around 4.2%/2.0% or about 2.1. (The S&P currently
yielding 2.0%). Now you track this ratio back for a long time - - 10 or 15 or
25 years. Plot the ratio every month (use what the S&P yield was for that
particular month and what the Penney div. yield was). Look for a pattern. Are
you still with me???? For Penney, the 2.1 plot point is the highest it's ever
been: It's been as low as .5, and maybe a good sell point is when the ratio is
1:1 (which is the same thing as 1.0) which has happened frequently. In other
words, what some of these people are saying is, I think, that if the stock
market doesn't go down too much (the 2.0% figure stays good) and if the Penney
$2 dividend doesn't shrink (I think it'll grow), the stock of Penney will sell
at double or $100 because the ratio will once again be 2%/2.0% or 1:1. That's
when you sell. It will take maybe 2-3 years. Maybe 1 year. Maybe never.
Meanwhile you get spending money: you could send your nice niece the nice
dividend check :-) The idea is that with these behemoth stocks, history repeats
- you will see the stock of JCP trade at the S&P yield again. And that
dividends are real - there's no EPS (reported earnings) phoney baloney. And
there's little risk of the company disappearing.

What's the downside? Think the div. will be cut? Not likely. How low can the
stock drop? And it's dropping every day. Test the low? Get to 40 so that the
yield is now 5%+? I don't know. BUT, even at 40, would these value investors
discover an error and jump off, or would they be likely to increase their
commitment? Where will this stock be in 1- 3 years? Only just test it's high in
50's?? To me, I'll bet with the pro's- I've tailed them before and I've been
happy with the results .

I don't have all my research right handy. Don't have latest annual. 1994 report
says JCP stock price has appreciated (with div. reinvested - ha! whoever does
that but DRIPers?) 21% past 3 years, 8% (that's not good!) past 5 years, and
about 19% past 10 years. Look, an INTC (Intel) it ain't never gonna be. I'm
talking an undervalued, underfollowed, underloved stock with a chance for some
appreciation and not a lot of risk of losing money. (Gee, now that does sound
like a geezer ad in the singles wanted section -g-.) Penney is trying a lot of
things - retail, catalog, private brands (jeans to cosmetics) insurance,
credit., drug stores. 200,000 people work for the Company. That's a lot of
momentum, and a lot of room for good things to happen. Maybe JCP will get to
the internet.; they've got huge distribution centers and I'd guess a pretty
reasonable image for quality and customer satisfaction. They say they're trying
to be a leader in "technology and systems " (They better be.)

Given all this info. I say the stock is currently undervalued at the current
price. There is a place for it in a portfolio where it can develop - where you
must have the time to see if it will work. (I think key things are: to bet this
stock, you've got to have others going too (a portfolio) and you must make the
time to let it happen (tough for me too, in spite of what I say in this post.))

I find interesting: Penney's numbers sure look lousy as shown by Chris Kay's
Telescan report. . . and the stock of TGIS sure looks good. I mean 4.6X cash
flow, 20% ROE, 7 pe and if it could do a retracement to even a 2/3 of its past
few months high, you'd get a double. Seems like a study of why we need to go
beyond looking at screens and superficialities to get to the real analyses and
values.

TGIS: Booming, popular business. It's hot stuff this reengineering and cycle
time reduction (well it was in 1994, 1995, and 1996) Except where's it gonna be
18 months from now? (yeah I know, in 1.5 years who cares?). Big contracts (big
co's , world-wide operations) disappear so easy. Big companies already moving
beyond expensive consultants and doing it themselves, training cadres of
internal people. Cadre guys figure it out: anybody can print a manual and set
themselves up in business, And they do. (You're reading from one who did.) And
TGIS's business is consultants, and they walk real easy too. Further, if you
promise the client results, my guess is you have to have on site consultants.
They ain't so easy to get , esp. if you land that multi-site contract where the
big $ are. TGIS begins with niche --but then just try competing when Andersen,
others catch on.
One more lost contract, one disappointing stumble, you'll see the stock selling
for Penney's dividend ($2) -g-. I say this trying to be a value investor on
this thread weighing risk and reward potentials. Heck, maybe the stock will go
to $50. Maybe it should go to $50. But I surely don't want it at $7.50 . Sir,
Madam: may I show you a tennis shoe in your size, or pehaps a nice tie or
necklace?

regards, Paul.

Mike: 30 min. analysis of PRNI.

Co. says (3q rpt) that the measure of performance is EBITDA.

For 3q's they report $5.3m EBITDA. Need full year guestimate: real rough could
be 8m, with error on high side (?). There are roughly 9m shares out selling at
about 12/sh. So buyer of co. is paying 108m for 8m, which is saying EBITDA
multiple is roughly 13.5 For value analysis on what the co. says is important,
I need to have compares with other similar cos. (ie. I can't tell if 13.5 is
high,avg. or low ---maybe avg??) Stock rated buy by 3 brokerage type (?)
companies, but stock has not moved much in '96. (There was a 1 for 2 stock
split which made stock in 18-20 range equal to 12-14 on new share amounts.) Co.
does seem aggressive in purchasing/selling assets and partnering (partial
acquistions), and has been in bus. at least since '87. I would need to know
more about co. and mgmt to get comfortable.
Seems though that co. is growing; Also seems downside is limited. (Ha! They'll

William Lippman, of the Franklin Balance Sheet Investment Fund (which
can't buy a stock selling for more than book, but still has beat
the S&P every year since inception six years ago), is profiled in
Forbes under "Ben Graham Lives."

He lists the following as potential picks:

Aydin Corp (P/B .53)
Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal (.46)
American National Insurance (.88)

The following sell for less than current net assets:
Allou Health and Beauty Care
Allstate Financial Corp
Espey Manufacturing and Electronics Corp
Harding Lawson Associates

Other stocks he likes that bend the rules a bit:
Oil-Dri Corp (upward earnings jolt as marketing expenses decline)
Morgan Products (erratic earnings on mend)
Little Switzerland (Caribbean retailer lost a season due to hurricane)
S&K Famous Brands (men's suits in an era of casual dressing)

No analysis cuz I have no time, but I just wanted to bring them
to everyone's attention. As an aside, it looks like Nortek's rise foreshadowed
the recent good economic news. The market as a whole
looks as risky as ever, especially if the good news keeps coming.

Yep, Mike, PRNI looks good. Rupert Murdoch ownership is probably indicative of

decaf nowadays. ;)

I will be watching it. I did some of my amateur T/A on the stock and some of
the indicators are very strongly bullish, more so than for most of my favourite
stocks. Maybe this is an indicator that takeover talks are indeed in the works.
(Is this one of the reasons people get into value investing...potential suitors
due to strong financials can drive stock price up?) Good luck tomorrow.

(Remember where OTEXF was when I mentioned it on this thread several weeks
ago...5 3/8...now at 8 1/8 after some uncertainty...should be a fun week. I am
expecting $15 this year but I'd be happy to sell if it hit $12 this month.)

Open Text In Livelink Licensing Pact With Hewlett-Packard

Dow Jones News Service ~ January 6, 1997 ~ 10:23 am EST
WATERLOO, Ont. (Dow Jones)--Open Text Corp. (OTEXF) said it has
concluded a corporate licensing agreement to supply Hewlett-Packard Co. (HWP)
its Livelink WorkSMART technology worldwide to implement a global virtual
information repository for Hewlett-Packard's internal use.

In a news release, Open Text said the repository will allow users of technical
documentation on Hewlett-Packard's UNIX operating system within
Hewlett-Packard to access these documents for research, authoring, re-use and
re-packaging uses.

Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, Calif., makes computing, communications and
measurement products and services.

Open Text is an intranet applications company.

(END) DOW JONES NEWS 01-06-97
***********
Is it just me or is this not incredibly positive. Basically, it
appears HP will use Livelink Suite worldwide and tie it intimately
to its business operations. Great publicity and validation even if
no dollar signs are mentioned. OTEXF now up to 9, having bounced
off its 50 day MA and broken through its 200 day MA.

From the chart OTEXF is going up.

But I can not consider it a value investing idea, This small company lost $45M
in 1996 vs. a total sales less than $10M. I can not get the book value number,
it is probably zero or negative.

What's your argument that it is a value investing idea?

Steven,

Actually, it is not a value company, as I mentioned in some
previous posts. However, it was brought up on this thread
way back when the thread started, so I'm just posting the info
to keep everyone up to date on it, like I have other companies
I haved discussed.

OTEXF is speculation and a growth play. It re-organized this summer,
and all but 11M of that 45M is a restructuring charge, not operating
losses. The company has moved from being a search engine company
to offering comprehensive intranet products. Hence, I am discounting
most of its past performance and focusing on the immense number
of contracts it is obtaining from name companies like the US Gov't,
Siemens, HP, Ford, etc.

My previous posting recommended Closed-Ends CEE and CRF

I previously posted on two European closed end funds:
http://www.techstocks.com/~wsapi/investor/s-10036/reply-76

Since then CEE paid a $1.90 end of year dividend and CRF paid a $0.50 dividend
and the stocks have moved up to narrow the discounts, so they are not as good a
deal now as they were then.

But CEE still returned 25% last year and still can be bought for a 20% discount
to NAV. If you are worried about US market overvaluation, and want to park
money overseas, this is a good vehicle. If the US market drops big, foreign
markets will also drop, but I think the European markets tied to the
Deutschmark won't drop as much. Furthermore the US dollar is hitting multiyear
highs against foreign currencies. If you want to trade the contarian side of
that, buying CEE moves dollars into DM. Finally, if the European markets drop
in sympathy, I think the discount will narrow, meaning the stock price won't
drop as much as the NAV.

Hypothetically, the US market could drop 20% (with many stocks off 40-50%), the
European market could drop 10%, and CEE may only drop 5%, and still trade at a
15% discount. Conversely if the US market goes up 10%, the European markets
could rise 15-20% (because they have a much better valuation), and CEE could
rise another 25% (with the discount narrowing). If the dollar also weakens 5%
against the DM, then CEE could return 30%.

CEE trades on the NYSE and the discount and NAV is published every week in
Barron's and the Monday WSJ. You should check out the page that lists all the
closed end funds. Its pretty strange to buy $100 worth of stock(at market
prices) for $80.

Try EVT and UNC both on Toronto and excellant investment track records

Also BGR Precious Metals, trades Toronto, good track record, holds

one.

Re Fiat, I believe if you want a value play in automotive sector you
have to look at Chrysler, with all the cash, the divident payout,this
cash cow should be good for 20% return over each of the next 3 years.

There is a link to a Carlston homepage where news and quotes are

I would think a US broker could easily trade canadian stocks, since
I am a Canadian and trade US stocks through my canadian broker, if
not you would have to open an acct with a Canadian broker, however they would
probably want a canadian address (Check out kerm's thread,
he's a US citizen who trades Can oil's extensively).

Re European closed End funds, dont think any would be 30% Disc, although I am
basing that on Barrons which has a pretty extensive list of closed end funds(I
believe they are more popular in Europe so probably less discount).

To All: Does anyone follow LTUS (Garden Fresh Restaurants) which
operates restaurants under the name Souplanation and Sweet Tomatoes
in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Florida. Just got a recommendation
on LTUS from Whistling Billy (The Whistle Stop internet newsletter)
on my E-Mail. Normally, I haven't been too excited about his stock
recommendations, but this stock might have some potential if it isn't
too pricey already.

Current earnings for FY 96 ended on Sept 30, 1996 were 0.72 per share
based upon 4.1 million shares. FY estimate for 97 is 0.86 per share.

Company is expanding to open new restaurants in 97 and 98.

The menu consists of fresh salads, soups, pastries, and desserts.

Technically, the stock price has been going sideways for about 6 months
and now seems poised to head up if it closes above 11. It closed today
at 10 3/4 on volume of 46,000, up 1/4.

I would appreciate any opinions on this, especially do you think it has
already moved up too much in the past year looking at its chart
pattern, and how upside potential do you think it has this year.

To All: One more stock candidate to examine (this is not from
Whistling Billy) is Zaring Homes on the NASDQ, symbol ZHOM, currently
trading at about 11 5/8. This is an upscale home builder with
headquarters in Ohio, has about 4.5 million shares, of which 55% is
owned by the Zaring family. Earnings estimate for 97 is 1.27 per share.
The company is expanding into manufactured housing as well.

Technically, the stock has been moving up recently after declining most
of 1996. If one subtraced the percentage of shares owned by
institutions as well, the float is quite thin.

Would anyone like to share their opinion on either ZHOM or LTUS,

yet in either of these stocks.

Harlan,

I haven't had time to look into this, but some Lynch-type personal
stories: This is a Fresh Choice look-alike. However, I've eaten
at these restaurants, and Souplantation sucks, especially relative
to Fresh Choice, which offers much higher quality fare. In fact everyone I ate
with at Souplantation said they would never come back. How has Fresh Choice
done as an equity investment? Terrible.

The restaurant phenomenon of "open new stores to sustain growth then
cut costs as much as you can once you can't open new stores" bodes
poorly over the long term for even good restaurants like OSSI and
Longhorn. My personal feeling is that if the restaurant is mediocre
in the first place, then where are you going to cut costs?

Anyway, that's my two cents.

Zaring Homes (ZHOM)

11 3/4, PE 9.5, P/B 1.2 ($9.13 book), ROE 12.4%, ROAvgAssets 5.1%
Market cap 58 million with 12% held by 15 institutions (4.4 mill sh)
Current Ratio 4.72, Quick Ratio 0.28
Total Equity/Total Assets 0.52
Long Term Debt is ZERO. Has 3.5 mill cash.

Compared to the industry, ZHOM has not fared well. $1000 3 yrs ago
in the DJ Home Construction Industry Index would have turned into $1502, while
in ZHOM it would now be $783. Pre-tax margins have
widely fluctuated from 2.2% to 8.5% in the last four quarters.
The 8.5% occurred in the 12/31/95 quarter, which produced extremely
high earnings. "And Stanley predicts Zaring Homes Inc. (ZHOM), of Cincinnati,
will earn 26 cents a share in the fourth quarter, below the 47(!) cents it
earned last year." Does anyone have an explanation for this?

Zaring recently acquired a manufactured housing concern, and was
mentioned in the most recent Barron's. Basically, the mention concerned home
manufacturers allying with builders/developers in what
analysts believe will be a long term trend, to paraphrase.

The stock is currently above both the 50d and 200d MA on no volume.
I wonder if we could wait on this one until we see the current
earnings. Last quarter it beat estimates .36 vs .34.

Any news on insider buying?
Also, Harlan, can you give any justification for repurchasing NTK?
I like it but am worried about buying back in after its recent
steep run-up. What has occurred is already a historically huge
move for NTK.

becomes a game of cat and mouse with the specialist to find the
appropriate entry point again. I believe the stock had a gap of
1/8 point at 17 7/8 which has not been filled yet.

I will watch it closely to look for an entry point and let you know.
Of course, the extended overall stock market itself poses an extra
big risk for overextended stocks.

I should be getting my latest copy of Daily Graphs from LA today, and
they will have an estimate of when the company will report earnings,
probably in late January. I will post that date.

As an aside note, BZH which was recommended on this thread back in
November and which had also performed very well fell yesterday
because Solomon Brothers downgraded it from a buy to a hold based on
the recent runup in the stock price.

I will check further to see if any news on NTK accounted for the
drop today, or if it was just because of the sharp runup in the
price since November.

DO you reside in CA? I used to, but now reside up near Seattle.
I wonder if you have any knowledge of a company called
California Amplifier (CAMP), which has been in a downward glide path
from 50 to about 5 5/8 during this past year. I wonder if this
stock may become a good buy down at these levels sometime in the
near future. Do you have any opinion on when CAMP might turn things
around? CAMP cannot be called a value stock yet, unless of course the
price keeps dropping. I have also been watching ZTEC, which has been
going sideways around 10 3/4 to 11 1/2, but have not bought any yet.

Michael: Regarding NTK, Schwab did not have any news on NTK today.
In looking at the Lombard intraday graph on the internet, I see that
the stock dropped quickly from 22 7/8 to 20 1/4 on light volume from
2:30 PM to 4:00 PM EST. 15,000 shares were sold at 22 7/8 the high
for the day. Seeing that many shares for sale at 22 7/8 prompted me
to sell out at 22 3/4. Someone bought 300 shares at the close to
move the stock back up to 20 3/8. Since there was not any bounce at
the close, I imagine it will move lower. I haven't looked, but it
is probably being mentioned in Investors Business Daily, and that
attracts a lot of traders, who try to "flip" these stocks for a point
or less, and will quickly run for the exit when the stock starts to
drop. Maybe news tomorrow will surface to account for the drop.
I think it is just profit taking, unless, of course, the company
announces that it has completed its purchase of 500,000 shares, which
if some knew in advance would trigger a sell off. But I have no
knowledge of that.

The Daily Graphs for the week ended January 3, 1997 show that they
expect earnings to come out around January 31. These graphs show
no insider selling as of January 3, but it is always possible there
could have been some this week, but I don't know that.

The short interest is shown as 3.8 days; the relative strength is 94.
The fast upward move started at about 16, so it went from 16 to
22 7/8 or lets say 7 points up very quickly. If it were to retrace
50% of that, it would come back down to about 19.5. I think it will
probably consolidate around 20. Any further move down into the 18's
tomorrow would constitute a buying point, I would think. I often
check to see if there are any blocks of 5000 to 10,000 bidding, this
often indicates that institutional buyers see that as an attractive
entry point again. The 50 day moving average is at 16.25, but I can't
see it dropping to that point, unless the entire market has a sudden
and severe sell off. And I know that many of us feel that such a
sell of is lurking out there somewhere in 1997.

The earnings that NTK must beat are as follows:

4th qtr, dec 31, 1996 0.33
1st qtr, 1997 0.20
2nd qtr, 1997 0.55
3rd qtr, 1997 0.64

The first two look very easy for NTK to exceed.

Since BZH ran up in tandem with NTK, it might be interesting to see
where it bottoms out since it started dropping a day earlier and is
now in its second day of decline.

BTW, scratch my earlier comment in a previous post about a gap at
17 7/8. The stock did gap from 17 7/8 on one day to open at 18 3/8
the next day, but several days later, it declined back down to 18,
so that probably is not to be considered an unfilled gap any more.

Scott: Regarding ZHOM, the thin float that this stock has causes me
some concern, since it will be difficult for institutions to
accumulate this stock without driving up the price significantly,
unless they do so over a protracted period of time. Thus, most will
probably not bother with it. If this were a high tech stock, it would
be a different story.

The stock is not in the Daily Graphs, so it is not followed very
actively. I have no way to see what their earnings for 1996 were
on a quarter to quarter basis to see if they have a reasonable chance
of bettering these in 1997. Someone could probably look at their
10Q filings out on Edgar to find out this information. I think we
all agree that this is probably the key to any sustained upward move,
i.e., significantly higher earnings for their quarters in 97 than for
the same quarters in 96. I don't know how much their acquisitions in
manufactured housing and their new housing developments in Knoxville,
TN, and Raleigh, NC will enhance earnings in 97. With the exception
of BZH and NTK, none of the other housing stocks have been doing very
well, e.g., RYL, KBH, CON, TOL, CHM, PHM, LEN, WBB. I think that MDC
in Denver has had a nice move lately.

Technically, it looks as if the stock has to close above 12 to break
a downward sloping trend line. I also have no information on insider
buying or selling, which is normally readily supplied by Daily Graphs.

Dow Jones News Service ~ January 8, 1997 ~ 2:17 pm EST
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Premiere Radio Networks Inc. (PRNI) acquired
After MidNite Entertainment Inc. for $9.2 million, consisting of $3.9 million
in cash
and 400,000 Premiere common shares.

Premiere also named Eric Weiss, After MidNite's chairman and chief executive,
to
its board. Further information on Premiere's board size was not immediately
available.

One year from closing, if the market price of the stock is less than $16 a
share,
Premiere will pay additional consideration equal to the shortfall.

In a press release, Premiere said it expects After MidNite's 1997 revenues to
be
more than $4 million, and says its contribution to Premiere's earnings before
interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization for the twelve-month period beginning
April 1,
1997, may exceed $1.5 million.

For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Premiere's net income was $1.26 million.

After Midnite produces country music programming and services.

Premiere Radio creates, produces and distributes comedy, entertainment, music
radio programs, research and other services.

(END) DOW JONES NEWS 01-08-97

2:16 PM

*******
PRNI's net income for the 9/30 quarter was 1.3 million, so the
extra 1.5 million/year increases is a fairly big boost. Additionally,
PRNI has been making about 24 million/yr, so the extra 4 million is
helpful. The acquisition ought to boost margins and make PRNI more
attractive to buyers. PRNI had 28 million in cash and no LT debt,
so the 9 million price is definitely tolerable.

Paul,
DSWWF is the symbol for the Deswell Warrants. They are callable just over 12
with 2 warrants needed to buy 1 share at just over 9, so the warrants will be
worth about $1.50 when the stock gets to 12. I think it needs to trade above 12
for 20 days. Since the old high is 11-1/4, it will likely run way past 12 when
it finally runs. I think the biggest risk is that the Chinese may tax Deswell
about 30% more which would still have earnings around $1.15 with a 20% + growth
rate. Pretty cheap for a $10 stock. The warrants also trade on the Nasdaq and
are listed directly below Deswell common in Barron's.

I was looking back on my post #85 and all but 3 of the stocks are up out of 21
listed.
All 3 REITs were up 5% or more, with GLR being the strongest and having the
most potential.
MODA ran the most - up over 60%, most of it this last week. LUKN is breaking
out now and could easily run also. SNSR is also up over 15%. It seems the ones
that broke out to new highs kept running the best.
The only group that performed flat was the dogs that got some extra year end
tax selling, with OLGC and MNPI being the only ones down more than 2-3%.
Neither one has based on earnings, just they were technically strong on dead
cat bounces. I need to stick to my fundamentals on 'value'. The other dogs have
started to trend up.
I still like EXLS and BMLS though their spreads are too large right now. I
think they both could be 30-60% higher in 3-12 months.

RHT was the only other stock down, but I thought it was ahead of itself and
suggested buying it on a pullback to 4-1/8 which was the low yesterday and
today.
regards,

I see lots of talk about the same 3 or 4 stocks and would like to discuss one
or two of these. I am also accumulating a REIT whose symbol is HFD. I want to
wait for the next dividend declaration in the next few weeks, but I expect a
10% quick pop and maybe as much as 30% + a 11% yield inside of 6-12 months if
the fundamentals are real. The downside is it is such a microcap. The upside is
that it has a FFO multiple that appears to be below 7, while most REIT's
growing at that rate are around 11-15.

Mike: You are right on. Nothing but good news from the co (PRNI).

I wanted to add to your analysis. It seems that PRNI has emphasized EBIDTA,
which I pointed out in one of my previous posts. (The EBIDTA figure 1.5 is
given even before earnings are mentioned.). Given PRNI outstanding sh of 9m and
sh. price approx now 14, we are looking at a market cap of 126M for PRNI.
EBIDTA which I gussied up to be about 8m annually, now I rough guess at 9.5M.
So PRNI sells for 126/9.5 or about 13.5. If we take out your figure of 28m in
cash which is just sitting there - then we are looking at ratio of 98m/9.5 or
about 10:1.
PRNI says it likes to be evaluated by EBITDA. They paid Premium
16x400k + 3.9m or about 10.3M (or that's what I figure the obligation is) for
1.5M in EBITDA. That is, the ratio here is about 7x.
Not sure what this all means. If they got a good deal 7, then to an acquirer of
PRNI, is 10x too much or okay or undervalued? I think 10x is too much, but as
you have mentioned - there's a lot of good stuff happening with the aggressive
management, and this IS starting to be reflected in the price. Paul S.

Only once have I ever been holding stock in a company that
got taken over, and the price was less than the current market
price. Can PRNI be taken over at less than the current price?
Sure. Will it? Probably not. Is 10X too much? Probably. But
if a company is looking to gain market/monopoly power (such a goal
seems to be the driving force behind most media mergers vs. tech
where they are just trying to add business at a reasonable price), then PRNI
has sufficient market share in what it does to be an
attractive target. Further, it is actually making decent money.
I'm not counting on a takeover (it's just not worth the effort
for me to hope for one), and I'm just happy to be invested in
a profitable company with aggressive management. Are you at all considering a
position?

He also recommends Continental Homes Holding (CON) for the same reason. He

Deswell Industries gapped up and set new 52 week high today

DSWLF gapped up to 10.80 on the open and climbed as high as 11.75 today.

Last Friday, Sir John Templeton was on Wall Street Week and said he liked the
Hong Kong market. He forsees an orderly transition to PRC rule. The new
governor is in place, and he doesn't expect major problems. Incidentally, the
PRC helped rescue the new governor's family shipping business in the 80s when
it got in trouble. They helped out with loans, loan guarantees, and new
business, I understand.

I passed on the warrants; if I understood you, the maximum conversion value is
1.50 per warrant. Today, I saw a trade for DSWWF cross the tapes at 1.50. I
suspect the MMs will take most of the profits on these at this point, using an
unreasonable spread. I wonder who would pay 1.50? Maybe a short covering?

Now I got to get to work, and analyze some of your other stock selections. I do
have a problem this year, though. I have some stocks I'd like to sell, but I
face some really daunting capital gains taxes if I do. That is one more reason
to find a stock that I could buy and hold for a long time.

Paul,
The warrants can go higher if the stock doesn't get called or if it runs
quickly to 13 or higher. If it runs to 13, the warrants would be worth almost
2. I was ready to buy 5000 warrants at 1.25 and short 2000 shares of the stock
at 11-1/8. If the stock drops 2 points the warrants would only lose 3/8, in
which case I would cover the shorts. Unfortunately the ask on the warrants went
up just before the stock crossed 11. Since the warrants have a few years, they
are a good way to hedge if you can short the shares(not easy), when they have
almost no premium.
ADEX is one on the list that got a buy recommendation today and is running
further.
OGAR isn't exaactly a value play, but it's not far from one. They got a buy
recommendation also today and is growing rapidly with a fairly low P/E (earning
about .70 based on the last quarter). The upside potenetial is huge. On Dec
20,1996 some guy testified to congress about their air bag sensors being able
to detect the weight of the person to determine if an adult or a child. If the
technology is for real, it won't be long before it gets hot. The 4 biggest HOT
HOT industries right now are: Year 2000 software solutions, Bomb Detectors for
airport security, Common Cold Cures, Air Bag Solutions. There are probably many
more, but these seem to have no solutions previously and have some huge market
caps if a real solution can be proven.I have no opinion as to how effective
OGAR's solutuion is, I just liked the fundamentals and the stock action based
on it's current price. The air bag thing is just a huge potential bonus.

Thanks Scott! I'll keep watch. To all interested: IMO there is a
huge turnaround story here. Greyhound spent a mint a few years back
on an airline reservations system, and it flopped miserably. Many
bus riders do not use credit cards, and most did not want to make
reservations. This purchase killed their numbers for a couple of
years. I can see the 5 yr. earnings picture on E*trade, and the numbers were
horrendous. Prior to this purchase the stock had traded
as high as the 20's and the EPS was higher than a dollar for the
3rd qtr. in one year. If you do a search on Greyhound at www.Forbes.com you can
read the same article that sold me. This is
a turnaround and growth story. BUS is filling in where Amtrack has
shut down, w/ depots at the train stations. They are going to serve
Mexico, beyond the border. This Thanksgiving was fantastic for them;
December was also good. I'm ready to take my chances here. They have
a bit of debt, but that is improving. If the Fiscal '98 estimate, $1.00 a share
is achievable this should be a 12-18 month double, IMHO.

You were right about DSWWF going above 1.5

Thanks for putting me in this stock, Richard. Your timing for me couldn't have
been better. The stock now has broken above 12, and now if I understand you, if
it stays here for 20 days, the company has the right to demand the warrant
holders exercise. Is this right?

Boy, what an interesting arbitrage you suggested; buying the warrants and
selling the stock short. But it really only works if the stock drops in the
next 20 days. And you incur the trading costs of the commissions and the
bid/ask spread. And you have to find the shares to borrow. So I am not sure I
am nimble enough to do it.

But if the stock continues to zoom up, I guess I could buy the warrants and
sell my shares as an alternative to selling outright. Still, given the trading
spreads, I don't think I'll mess around. I just think this stock can go a lot
higher, so I'll just hold for the ride and get my 50+% return (using margin).
You can have your 200-300 % returns on the warrants. Enjoy and good investing.

(To the thread: Richard's stock picks have really been hopping since he posted
them in early December. I bought DSWLF, and it is up about 40% in the last five
weeks since he recommended it. But he doesn't give a lot of info, so I will
post some info and give another perspective. Note: He is more of a short term
trader than me, so my perspective is from a longer term view.)

So far, I've checked Lukens(LUKN) some. I'd thought I'd post my thoughts so
far.

LUKN is a micro-micro cap ($16M cap) that produces disposable medical products
like sutures. It has a TTM PE of 21 and only did $6.1M in revenues through the
nine months ending Sep 30. It is trading at 2.5 times book and 2.3 times sales.
By these measures it seems expensive. The current 97 estimated EPS is $0.45,
which is a 12% rise over the annualized 3Q 96 earnings. Based on this estimate
the stock is trading at a forward PE of 13.

Luken announced a joint venture to manufacture syringes in India on Wednesday.
Based on the press release, this joint venture could generate up to $5.0M in
sales next year (but probably less). The plant will begin production in April.
They do say they have some orders for syringes in hand.

They don't say what portion of the joint venture is Luken's, but did say that
Luken is the majority shareholder(51% ?). The 20,000 square foot modern plant
is owned by the joint venture. Almost $2M was raised through bank financing and
partner contributions, but the release doesn't give the details how much was
raised from the partners. If the facility operates at 80% of capacity, then
this new facility alone will increase Luken's sales by over 20%. If the syringe
business is at their normal gross margin of 11-12 %, then they will be
generating a possible total $0.55 annual earnings stream, but probably less
based on financing costs. The stock is trading over 10.5 these optimistic
earnings.

The the stock has run-up in price to 5 7/8 since Richard first recommended it
around 4. It appears to me that part of this recent run-up is in anticipation
of the start of the syringe business. At the current price, it looks fairly
valued given the risks and uncertainties. It could be worth more, if we had the
details of the syringe business deal. Management seems to be pretty effective
turning this company from a loss situation to a profitable company.

I think I will pass on this one for the time being. If you have any thoughts or
disagreement, Richard, post them back to me.

Paul,
LUKN had my favorite technical pattern. A stock that trades in a tight range
for 2 years or more and then breaks out. I read a book by Ted Warren written in
the 60's that tried to buy these patterns. It appeared that the stocks would
triple in 7 years or less more than 2/3 of the time. It seems that everything
is faster now and they do it in 2-3 years a lot. DDDDF is another one that
recently broke out above 8-1/4 and is now around 11. LUKN had earned .08 two
quarters in a row and seemed cheap when it was near 4. Now that it is near 6,
I'm not going to argue and expect it may well run a lot more, but I'm not
accumulating unless I put in a buy stop at new highs for a short term trade
until I see some more quarterly earnings. It's more of a momentum play then a
value stock after the 50% run up.
For those who want a very likely sure thing (or as close as you can get) BPT
apparently announced their dividend today and raised it for the 2rd quarter in
a row, but a huge increase this time. Since it is trading at the smae price as
3 months ago, it should go up 5% or more in the next week. I just hope it
doesn't gap up.

David, you probably read the boo by Brown and Bently "Cyber Investing -
Cracking Wall Street with your Personal Computer". If not it is a must for new
searches in Telescan. I found that momentum searches work for me for the short
term. The truth be told I have the best results when I go all greedy with the
criteria and put high 100% on about 20 criteria. (This way they get weighed
equally). You get the top stocks here. Some that I have found are: Cliffs
Drilling, ESOL, Western Digital and Mcafee).

Search Criteria (200% growth)
-----------------
FUNDAMENTAL RANK High 100%

Then I do a backtest and see what how well this search worked before. It always

Richard: Can you share any more info. about that last one?

Having trouble finding info.- even at my local library. See where one of the
Bass brothers is making and increasing a stake in the Co. Co. profile I found
says BPT gets rev. from portion of first 90k barrels of ea's days production
with a proven reserve of 80m. Looks like roughly 1000 days of rev (assuming
90k/day production - and I realize there's more out there than just net proven
reserves). What's your objective re. BPT? Seems like div. reflects a very
quickly depleting resource. Tracked down some of your other posts re: BPT, but
still I can't get a clue. What am I missing that you and Bass boys see?
Appreciate any info. Paul Senior

Paul,
I'm just looking for a 5% gain in a week with BPT. I don't know or understand
oil royalties that well, but I do understand trading cycles and momentum. This
stock usually runs 5-8% in the 2-3 weeks before the dividend. Since they are
raising the dividend so much, many players who buy dividend rises will be
jumping in. It may take 1-2 days before the news trickles down that they raised
the dividend as I didn't have it show up on my Dow Jones ALERTs.
Long term the stock is cheap if oil is going to stay at $25.00 per barrel or
rise; if it goes back to $20.00 per barrel the stock should fall back into the
14-16 range. Until it becomes apparent that oil is going to drop, momentum
should continue going up on this stock. I hope to see it near 18 before
Thursday and if it doesn't drop below 16-7/8 after going ex-dividend, then it
could rise to 19 or 20 in a month, especially if oil stays strong. If I'm
wrong, the Bass Brothers should be buying my shares only 1/2 point below where
it is now.
If you are interested in high yielding stocks, I list my preferences for short
term trades in the REIT's topic, Trades 1-2 before dividends.
HFD, GRE and REA are the best values in terms of low FFO multiples and FFO
growth, but both are micro,micro-cap & below the screens for many REIT buyers.
I own REA & HFD & BPT.

To all: I'm new on this thread and ran my value analysis against all of the
stocks I could find on this thread for further discussion.

I look for 20%+ forecast growth, price near 52-week low, high ROE,
low D/E, high Margins, PSR <.5 for nontech and <1.25 for techs,
and PE/LTG < 1 for the initial screen.

I'm having a hard time finding good value in tech stocks lately. The ones I
sitting on right now are AMAT, SGI, APCC, and KMAG all of which I bought near
the bottom. These are all too high for me to buy more. My other favorite
long-term ones I bought using the above criteria that I am not necessarily
buying now are:

TXI - cement - ongoing stock buybacks, undervalued assets, big market share.
TNH - fertilizer - 25% "dividends" and 15-20+ appreciation per year, high
margins and ROE.
YEN - gold play - high margins and ROE, no debt, (no its not a mining company!)

I bought OLS after the drop and am considering buying more but it looks scary.
Any comments? I've already read the past posts on this thread.

Regards
Jeff Maresh

Ciprico as a high tech value play.
Current $14

Seems like well managed Co, makes RAID disk drive arrays and is the
leader in the field. They will be releasing 4th Q earnings very shortly and Im
expecting a surprise on the upside simply because
management is very comfortable with meeting current forecasts and they
are not the type to disappoint.

Hi Scott - Thanks for the ideas. Thats a lot cash but the high PSR of CPCI
really bothers me. Thats getting close to the "sell" zone for moderate risk
takers and definitely above where I like to jump in which is usually <0.75 and
sometimes as high as 1.0 if its really good.
