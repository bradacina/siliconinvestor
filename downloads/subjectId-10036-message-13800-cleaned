AOL I don't really follow, but it seems those that do have always had their
eyes on the far horizons: Willing to overlook absurd multiples and funky
accounting for promise internet dominance...and now perhaps concerned that the
shift to broadband will bring a wholsale shift away from AOL...that and the
tendency of many experienced netizens to drop the training wheels.
None of the above should be considered a serious 'opinion' just sharing some

Yeah, but will the kids be able to live without their AOL IMs and chatting?
That to me is the question. Plus, it appears that broadband penetration is
going to be slower than previously thought, absent any major government
initiatives (and most likely rural areas will not have any broadband option
except satellite). So while subscriber growth may slow, as long as AOL retains
membership, they should be in pretty good shape.

Just an off the cuff calculation:
33 million AOL members (assume worth $2,000 per member)
12.7 million AOL-TW cable subscribers (assume worth $4,000 per subscriber)
Networks (assume worth $20 billion)
Film (assume worth $10 billion)
Other (assume worth $5 billion)
Total = $152 billion

Or roughly $30 per share, after subtracting out $20 billion in LT debt. Not a
screaming bargain, but not ridiculously overvalued at this level either.
Writing covered calls may be the best way to play this.

Hard to tell how market will react to earnings release this week. Will success
of Harry Potter offset potential goodwill writeoff?

That's my 2 cents.

AOL - not exactly a value stock but the Street's not giving the world's
dominant media company any slack or premium value right now. Might be the right
time to jump in though as earnings ought to surprise to the upside and the
media assets are solid and substantial. Certainly the value of the pieces is
much more than the current share price.
This wave of worry about accounting practices has been overdone IMHO at least
in terms of AOL. When you subtract 60 billion in good will the market cap is
quite reasonable. I think they'll get away with their price hike which will
improve profits (globally as they expand) and Warners and HBO are booming. At
this price I like it for a $4 pop short-term (market conditions permitting).
Longer term I like it even more. Reasonable chance to return to the 40's this
year as ad revenues recover, assuming tehy do as predicted by summer.

Another value I like is PALM. Though their financial situation ain't great
their brand name and recent re-structuring make its 2+ billion market cap look
pretty small. As frosting on the cake I like the odds of takeover bids. PALM
would be a great strategic takeover for one of the majors. Their new 705 looks
to kick some ass. I know one company that just bought their whole system and
they love it.

Other values I like are HAL (asbestos fears overdone and still very cheap with
a great dividend) and SCRM (top rec of a broker friend of mine who has
researched deeply and says "just wait")

For what it's worth. Of course the market can and will do almost anything. But
better to buy near the bottom into uncertainty IMHO than catch it after it's
popped. The pops don't seem to last very long these days.

Sorry to hear your ISTN position didn't work out.

The non-recurring loss didn't surprise me. Earlier I noted the lawsuit issue,
with ISTN releasing a press anouncement and 8-K regarding the settlement costs
of the lawsuit, which I assume are in line with the non-recurring loss.

However, it is regretful that the company doesn't provide more information to
investors regarding future company prospects and the progress of the
shareholder buybacks. Although shares outstanding seem 10% lower this year
versus last, the company doesn't highlight or do anything to "sell" the stock.

I'd like to see a more pro-active and shareholder friendly management.

negatives:
too rapidly (?) growing revenues, debt, shares outstanding earnings losses
several years of decreasing book value
CEO has sold a chunk at lower prices recently

Negatives seem to outweigh positives as I list them. Company is a long-tail
insurer by having "an emphasis on catastrophe cover and unpredictable events".
Maybe only Berkshire Hathaway is big enough and smart enough to do this
successfully. TWK seems to have very good and very bad years. Given that the

Elan's Revenue Gets a Quick Lift From Its Complicated Accounting

By JESSE EISINGER
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

DUBLIN -- Some pharmaceutical companies are known for their research
excellence, others for their marketing prowess. Ireland's Elan Corp., the
world's 20th-largest drug company, with a market value of about $12 billion,
stands out for its accounting.

Consider its more than 50 research and development joint ventures. They
simultaneously shift R&D research costs off Elan's books and allow Elan to book
revenue long before the ventures have developed any products to sell.

In their most typical form, Elan invests $20 million in a partner and the joint
venture, and the venture immediately pays Elan $15 million for a
medical-technology license. Elan books that as revenue. But the money that Elan
invested doesn't cut into its earnings because that's an investment, and
appears only on the balance sheet, where it's an asset. In effect, Elan
converts $15 million of money it already had into new revenue.

"What's the real substance?" asks Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant for
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "I'm taking money out of one
pocket and putting it into another. That is a charade." Elan firmly rejects
that notion. "There is nothing inappropriate about our accounting," says its
executive vice chairman, Thomas Lynch, a former partner at KPMG LLP.

Uncommon Setup

In the wake of the scandal over Enron Corp.'s misleading accounting, the ways
that fast-growing companies reach their stellar numbers are drawing a closer
look. In the case of Elan, whose revenue and earnings have soared in the past
decade, such scrutiny reveals some unusually structured deals that contribute
to financial results, but that are difficult for investors to evaluate.

In one case, a joint venture with a small North Carolina biotech firm designed
to find a treatment for ulcerative colitis, Elan booked revenue even though no
cash appears to have changed hands when the venture was set up. In another
joint venture, with a Canadian biotech firm, the partners hadn't decided what
research the venture would pursue before it paid all of its funds to Elan for a
license.

Among Elan ventures' other quirks: After buying a license from Elan, the
ventures typically have no money left to pursue research on new drugs. Elan
sometimes makes them a loan. Then they contract out the research work, often
partly to Elan itself, again producing revenue for Elan.

Lately, the drug company has been selling off smaller product lines. It books
the proceeds as "product revenue," although some accountants say they should be
described as one-time gains, under generally accepted accounting principles.

Short-Sellers

Questions about Elan's accounting have dogged the company for years.
Short-sellers, who benefit when a stock goes down, have often criticized it.
Mr. Turner, now head of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado
State University, says Elan is "too fast for the regulators and too fast for
their own good. They appear to have gotten around the accounting rules and
around the system." The SEC wrote to Elan in 1999 expressing concerns about
some accounting maneuvers the company was using at that time. Elan restated one
year's earnings a few months after receiving the 1999 letter, and it now says
the accounting issue has been laid to rest.

Some investment professionals seem to agree. The matter "is clearly historical,
and doesn't play a significant part in the business currently," says John
Murphy, a Goldman Sachs pharmaceutical analyst. Goldman has the stock on its
recommended list, its highest rating. Analysts at Merrill Lynch & Co. and 10
other brokerage firms also recommend the stock, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.

Elan's American depositary shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange,
requiring it to show its results under U.S. accounting rules. Annual revenue
jumped to $1.5 billion in 2000 from $323 million in 1996. What Elan calls
earnings per share before other charges rose to $1.46 in 2000 from 48 cents in
1996. Analysts estimate the 2001 figure at $1.92 and peg Elan's 2001 revenue at
$1.9 billion. Elan expects its revenue, most of which comes from sales in the
U.S., to double again in the next four years.

Elan currently sells dozens of drug and diagnostic products. It is developing
drugs for multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, although the Alzheimer's
product recently hit a snag and trials were temporarily suspended. Besides
Ireland, Elan has labs in San Diego and South San Francisco, Calif.

Elan says it currently has about 55 research joint ventures, but stopped
creating new ones in mid-2001 to focus on developing their products. The
ventures have more than two dozen potential drugs in human testing, it says.
The system is "very productive," says the company's chief scientific and
medical officer, Ivan Lieberburg. Because of this research setup, he adds, "we
don't have to do the Merck model of bringing everything inside. The advantage
of that is complete control. The disadvantage is it costs a lot of money."

In each of these joint ventures, Elan holds a 19.9% interest and its partner
the rest. The ventures, several based in Bermuda, have few or no employees.
This system contrasts with a more common way pharmaceutical companies link up
with small biotech firms, which is to acquire equity in the small firm in
gradual steps as the research advances, and receive co-marketing rights to any
drug produced.

Cross Receipt

Though Elan doesn't announce the joint ventures' financial results, some
details can be gleaned from SEC filings by the company or its partners, such as
Incara Pharmaceuticals Corp. of Research Triangle Park, N.C. According to a
securities-purchase agreement filed by Incara with the SEC last January, Elan
invested $2.985 million in this joint venture and $16.015 million in Incara
stock and a warrant. Incara, the majority partner, then put $12.015 million
into the joint venture, bringing the venture's funding to $15 million.

The SEC filing said Elan would pay Incara the $16.015 million by wire transfer.
But in Incara's subsequent quarterly filings with the SEC, its statements of
cash flow don't show a receipt of this cash in financing activities, nor do
they show any payment from Incara to the joint venture in investing activities.
Yet SEC filings say the joint venture bought a $15 million technology license
from Elan.

Asked why the quarterly filings showed no payments of cash, Elan says in a
written response that "cash was transferred by way of a cross receipt," which
it calls a "legal mechanism under which amounts owing under different contracts
are amalgamated with the resulting amount being settled by wire transfer." Elan
says it is "not aware of how Incara disclosed the movement in cash." Incara
declines to comment on its accounting for the transaction.

Assuming Elan did pay the $16 million to Incara, it would still seem that all
the money the joint venture used to pay a license fee to Elan had come from
Elan itself. Asked if this doesn't amount to what accountants call "round-trip
revenue," Elan's Mr. Lynch rejects the characterization, noting that "we end up
owning equity" in the majority partner. Incara says its venture with Elan has
started a late-stage clinical trial in ulcerative colitis patients.

A Year Ahead

One joint venture brought revenue to Elan 12 months before the partners had
even mapped out a research program. Formed a year ago, it involved Generex
Biotechnology Corp. of Toronto. Generex's CEO, Anna Gluskin, says the venture
paid Elan a $15 million license fee for drug-delivery technology. Yet the
partners didn't know which chemical compound they would develop or even which
disease they would target. In an SEC filing at the time, Generex said the
"parties intend to select at least one pharmaceutical product for research and
development under the joint venture within one year's time."

How could they decide a year in advance that the medical technology was worth
$15 million -- all the money the joint venture had? Elan says the price of its
licenses is based on what the technology is worth, not on the use of it. Ms.
Gluskin says the joint venture -- which, like Incara's, is based in Bermuda --
could afford to pay that much for a license "based on the potential for coming
to market sooner than other" competing drugs. She says the partners estimated
that the market for whatever drug was eventually developed would be at least
$500 million a year.

But actually, "we don't know what the market will be. It's all assumption," she
acknowledges, adding that "any [products] that sell over $500 million would
justify the payment" of $15 million for the license. The largest-selling drug
Elan has ever had, Zanaflex for muscle spasms, sells only a little over $150
million annually. This month, Generex announced the joint venture's project:
formulating morphine to be absorbed through the inside of the cheeks.

Elan used to book the full license fee from new joint ventures as revenue right
away. But the SEC ruled in 1999 that companies shouldn't immediately book
revenue from agreements in which they have continuing involvement, but should
book it over the life of the agreement. In response, about a year ago Elan
announced a $344 million retroactive charge against earnings. The seemingly
adverse SEC ruling has actually made Elan's later growth look better, because,
having reversed the premature booking of revenue, Elan became able to record
this revenue in the future.

Joint Ventures' Losses

All of the joint ventures run losses, Elan says. Just how these losses affect
Elan's earnings isn't very clear.

If a company's stake in a joint venture is below 20%, as Elan's are, it may use
"cost" accounting and needn't reflect a share of the investment's losses on its
own profit-and-loss statement. But, as Elan points out, if a company has
significant influence over the investment, it ought to use the "equity" method
of accounting and record its share of the losses in a line on its P&L
statement, reducing its earnings.

In Elan's typical arrangement with joint ventures, it has veto power over
research, 50% board representation and a right to raise its 19.9% financial
stake to 50%. Yet Elan's P&L statements don't break out any losses from the
ventures. The Center for Financial Research & Analysis Inc. in Rockville, Md.,
a firm that analyzes companies' books for big investors, has said in a report
that Elan appears to be using cost accounting.

Elan says it uses the equity method "where appropriate." It adds in a written
statement that it "expenses its share of the operating losses of all business
ventures regardless of whether the equity method or cost method is used. Such
amounts are included, in full, in net interest expense."

"Why in the world would they put this in interest expense? That doesn't make
any sense at all," says J. Edward Ketz, an associate professor of accounting at
Penn State, when told of Elan's statement. "What they are doing is not
consistent with either cost-method or equity-method accounting. I don't see
how, under U.S. GAAP, that would be." In addition, the interest-expense table
in Elan's SEC filings doesn't seem to show such losses.

Elan's auditor, KPMG, declines to comment, citing client confidentiality. Elan
is managed by a former KPMG partner, Donal Geaney, who has been at Elan for 14
years and chief executive since 1995. Mr. Lynch, the executive vice chairman,
came over from KPMG in 1993, and Elan's chief financial officer, Shane Cooke,
also is a former KPMG partner.

A couple of the businesses with which Elan has formed research partnerships
were tiny firms that were running out of cash. Celtrix Pharmaceuticals Inc. had
dismissed 90% of its payroll and was down to fewer than 10 employees when Elan
formed a research joint venture with it in April 1999, generating $10 million
of revenue for itself. The joint venture, based in Bermuda, has made little
progress, and Elan says it has written down its investment in the venture. An
Elan partner now called GlycoGenesys Inc., a firm that had gone public through
a reverse merger into a dormant company, had reported there was doubt it could
continue as a going concern shortly before Elan formed a joint venture with it
last June.

Elan says the prospect of quick revenue wasn't a factor in setting up either
joint venture, or any others. "Some of the best bargains can be made bottom
fishing," Mr. Lynch says.

Product Lines

Elan recently began a program called "product rationalization," in which it
sells product lines it considers too small. Its handling of the proceeds raises
a question of how accurate a picture investors get of Elan's ongoing revenue.

For instance, Elan is selling a Parkinson's-disease drug called Permax to a
small London company called Amarin Corp. Amarin paid Elan about $47.5 million
in last year's third quarter, is paying a royalty to Elan and has an option to
make another payment before mid-May to extend its rights, according to an
Amarin SEC filing.

Elan says it is booking the cash from Amarin not as a one-time gain but as
product revenue. That's wrong, says Mr. Turner, the former SEC chief
accountant. "This is not the ongoing sales of pharmaceuticals -- this is a sale
of an asset," he says. According to the SEC, gains or losses from asset sales
should be reported as "other general expenses." Elan's accounting, says Mr.
Turner, "appears to be an attempt to inflate revenue and give a picture to
investors that in reality doesn't exist."

Elan says its revenue-accounting policy couldn't possibly mislead investors or
analysts because it's known to them and publicly disclosed. It adds that its
accounting for sales of product lines is correct because it makes the sales in
steps or retains certain rights.

With this particular sale, there are other reasons that listing the proceeds as
product revenue could give investors an exaggerated impression of Elan's sales.
First of all, an Elan affiliate lent $45 million to the buyer, Amarin.
Secondly, Elan has extensive ties to Amarin. It owns about 43% of the buyer, on
a fully diluted basis. Amarin's CFO, Nigel Bell, maintained an e-mail address
featuring an Elancorp.com suffix until several weeks ago. Five Amarin directors
or executives are current or former Elan employees. Amarin's chairman is Mr.
Lynch, the Elan executive vice chairman, who says he engineered a rescue of
Amarin in 1998.

Related Party?

The following year, Amarin paid Elan $25 million for 15 product lines. But Elan
hasn't listed Amarin as a "related party" in its SEC filings. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board, which creates accounting standards, says this label
should be applied to transactions with affiliates, owners or management, or
wherever one party "might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate
interests" because of the other party's influence. The label can help investors
to evaluate a corporate transaction.

Asked whether Elan will list the Permax sale to Amarin as a related-party
transaction, Elan says it will "disclose the transaction ... in accordance with
the appropriate accounting literature" in its filings for 2001.

Occasionally, a company that buys a product line from Elan relies on Elan
itself for the money to do so. Last June Elan sold Midrin, a headache drug, to
Women First Healthcare Inc. of San Diego for $15 million. In the same
transaction, Elan invested $4 million in Women First shares and $11 million in
promissory notes.

Xcel Pharmaceuticals Inc. of San Diego bought two epilepsy product lines from
Elan last year. Xcel's filing for an initial public offering says the net price
was $150 million, $99 million of which it borrowed from Elan, while Elan also
put $15 million into equity of the buyer. Xcel had no operations before it
bought the Elan product lines. Elan says Xcel, whose board includes one Elan
executive and one former one, made the best bid in a competitive auction.

SEC Letter

Mr. Lynch says Elan's sales of product lines accounted for just 15 cents of its
2001 per-share earnings, which analysts peg at about $1.92 in all. Some
outsiders who have studied Elan think the product-line sales are a bigger
factor than that. Ian Sanderson of SG Cowen Securities estimates they accounted
for 40 cents of Elan's 2001 earnings. Maverick Capital, a New York hedge fund,
estimates 50 cents, based on its analysis of product-line sales throughout the
drug industry. Cowen rates Elan stock a buy. Maverick won't disclose its
position in the stock.

Some of the product lines Elan is now shedding came to it through a spate of
1990s acquisitions. The company's acquisition accounting was one of the topics
of the critical letter the SEC sent Elan in 1999. The SEC objected to Elan's
taking huge write-offs for acquired companies' research, sometimes even more
than the acquisition price. The move ensured that "goodwill" -- the difference
between an acquisition price and the acquired firm's net worth -- could never
burden Elan earnings.

The SEC also criticized some of Elan's off-balance-sheet R&D vehicles, which it
said "may materially inflate reported earnings," and questioned whether Elan
had accounted properly for its joint ventures. After several months, Elan made
a small restatement of 1997 earnings.

All the controversy over accounting gets wearying for some of Elan's staffers.
"It's frustrating," says Dr. Lieberburg, the chief scientific officer. "It's a
concentration on the wrong issue that, as a scientist and physician, I don't
see as relevant. At some point, I want to wake up and say, 'We've cured
Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis.' "

mrcjmoney,

I have to draw the line at the allegation of Tyco 'cooking the books'. I'm not
sure if you mean using 'aggressive accounting' that ought to be frowned upon or
outright illegalities of which I firmly believe there are none. I invite you
over to the Tyco thread to further discuss this because even at these prices
the level of risk in Tyco shares would likely disqualify it as a value
(although I have added).

Here are a few comments from a SSB report on Tyco's accounting:

"A recent argument we've heard about TYC's margins centers around how
acquisition purchase price is allocated between goodwill and fixed assets. The
argument goes goodwill is overstated, so fixed assets will be understated, so
depreciation expense will be lower, so margins and income will be higher. We
believe this argument does not hold water relative to an analysis of TYC's
disclosure, or comparisons to peers. By our calculation using data from TYC's
10-K, 79% of the purchase price of 2001 acquisitions (including purchase
accounting restructuring costs) was allocated to goodwill. We ran a calculation
of approximately 10 acquisitions done by several other companies in our
coverage list and found that on average that a very similar 75% of the purchase
price was allocated to goodwill. Further, if fixed assets were being deflated
in the acquisition accounting wouldn't
TYC's depreciation/sales ratio be lower than other companies? You would think
so, but that is not the case. For example TYC's depreciation/sales was 3.8% in
2000 and 3.7% in 2001 compared to 2.7% for GE (2000), 3.4% for
Danaher (2001) and 3.0% for EMR (2001). "

Look forward to discussing this further,

Is there an accountant in the house?

While going through some SEC filings, I ran across an entry for "Deferred
Income Taxes" and realized I didn't have any idea where "Deferred Income Taxes"
come from. Asking around, I've seen one theory that "Deferred Income Taxes"
result from the difference between earnings reported to the SEC and earnings
reported to the IRS. That seems almost impossible to believe except for the
fact that there are an incredible number of companies with very low PEs that
have to constantly borrow money to fund operations.

Out of curiosity I checked the filings for Enron and found "Deferred Income
Taxes" to the tune of $1.7 billion. Since I've never paid much attention to
looking for this particular type of entry, I'm wondering if I've been missing
out on a quick acid test for the quality of reported earnings. If a company
isn't actually paying taxes on the earnings they report to Wall Street, it
seems to me there is a rather high probability they aren't really earning any
money.

If anyone on the board is familiar with this particular entry, I'd be very
interested is seeing some discussion on the topic; especially if anyone is
using it for fundamental analysis to screen junk out of their portfolios.

Hi Don,

I'm not sure it would serve as a good test. I think it has more to do with the
different set of accounting rules allowed for GAAP and those for tax acounting.
So that theory you saw is probably right.

I think it goes like this: Say you have an asset (a piece of machinery) and
under GAAP you depreciate its value over 7 years for your SEC filings. Well,
the IRS doesn't go by your SEC filings so when you file your taxes you can
depreciate that asset over, say, 3 years (I am making up these numbers for the
example). Now this depreciation is like a tax break for both sets of books. For
the SEC books your income is less 1/7 the value of the asset and for the IRS
books your income is less 1/3 the value of the asset. Therefore, your income
reported to the IRS is smaller and you pay less tax for years 1-3. The
difference between the taxes paid the IRS and those reported to the SEC are
"Deferred Income Taxes".

Of course, in years 4-7 you subtract from that column until it is zero at the
end of year 7.

As to how it relates to actual earnings I am unsure. The only things the
company can control are the valuation of the asset (by how much they pay for
it) and the length of the schedule of depreciation. I'm not an accountant so
there is likely something I am missing.

My best guess,
Terrapin

I also am unsure if it serves as a good test - in the sense that we acertain
that a company has reported earnings and deferred taxes, yet actually pays no
taxes to the IRS, and so therefore those earnings are 'iffy' or not-so-real for
a stockholder or potential investor.

Occasionally I've seen a media report of a company in trouble wherein the
author asks readers if the trouble could have been anticipated by investors.
The author then will say, yes there was a significant clue because the company
in fact paid no income taxes (sometimes even getting a refund)while reporting
earnings to investors.

What I've never seen though is a report BEFOREHAND that predicts a company or
companies being in trouble based on the discrepancy (between deferred taxes
from reported earnings, and actual taxes paid), then demonstrating that this
discrepancy is a valid predictor because the stock or stocks subsequently
declined.

In other words, in my experience, anomalies between deferred and actual taxes
paid are usually not very helpful in making stock buy or sell decisions.

Paul Senior
I'm no subject-matter expert here
and I've been wrong many, many times

(Sometimes if the deferred taxes are relatively very large to other balance
sheet liabilities and/or growing substantially, further study of the financials
may be beneficial.)

Accounting -

Terrapin's got it right. When IRS reporting allows different tax-reporting than
financial-reporting, you get deferred income tax. For depreciation, it catches
up (for a particular asset), however, companies are always buying new assets so
there will always be deferred income taxes on the books. So it is not really a
liability that will ever be paid.

At least that's what I remember from my school days.

Thanks everyone for the good feedback. Usually when I read SEC filings, I'm
looking for red flags. It sounds like Deferred Taxes are a good place to spot
check for potential danger signals. To be honest, I'm feeling about like the
kid who just discovered babies don't come from storks. It never crossed my mind
that earnings in SEC filings could be different than earnings in IRS filings. I
suppose I assumed paying higher taxes was the price for cooking the books with
the wonders of GAAP. Oh well.

The funny part is I've long been aware that too slow a depreciation rate can
make a huge difference in what is reported on the balance sheet. Assets with a
finite life have to be replaced, and if the assets have to be replaced faster
than they are written off, it shows up as a higher book value with a lower PE.

GAAP is so twisty it's hard to back out some of the entries. Deferred Taxes are
evidently based on a 35% tax rate. Using Enron's $1.7 billion as an example,
that would work out to around $4.8 billion ($1.7 billion divided by .35) in
pre-tax earnings, which are not considered earnings for tax purposes. I suppose
a person could compare the statements from quarter to quarter and calculate the
change in Deferred Taxes, but that seems like a lot of work to go through when
viewing documents which are supposed to fairly present a company's financial
condition.

The scary part is if GAAP changes enough to expose all the Enrons, we're
probably going to be in a bear market which will last for a very long time.

strong buys on it & Paul liked it...at 40+ prices. For me, this didn't provide
a sufficient margin of safety...but at a 45% discount, I was, and am willing to

difficult to really evaluate the earnings. But with R&D based companies, even
if the accounting is conservative, you've got considerable uncertainty...Only
rarely does the market offer a price that overdiscounts that uncertainty...I

• GAP hasn't been getting it right recently
• 4 analysts have sell or strong sell - Despite a lot of pressure not to do
sells and 2/3's of analysts are hold [euphemism for sell at most shops] or
below. The bad rap analysts get is for being too optimistic due to IB conflicts
so this negativity carries, for me, a great deal more weight than an optimistic
concensus would.
• Minimum Lease committment $5.4 Billion - Not sure how to weigh this, but it
has debt-like qualities [anyone with insight care to comment on how operating
lease obligations should be viewed?]
• Negative free cash flow recently
The guy that bets against the above factors should, IMO, understand the fashion
business better than those analysts or needs to wait for a price that more than
discounts the negatives and the risks.

worried the company could go bankrupt.

I don't like being pinned down like this, especially as I don't now what % GPS
is of her portfolio or what her risk tolerance will be from GPS's current
price. Nor do I know her financial goals or financial situation. I suspect
she's not so financially secure that she can take losses as recklessly (?) as I
sometimes seem to be able to consider.

Luckily for me, whatever opinion I offer, she knows that I'm wrong many, many
times. -g-

My opinion will be - unless someone here has better ideas - that I believe GPS
is a hold. At least to see if further bad news will be forthcoming.

As long as she's still with the company, she should try to have patience to
hold on a couple of more years and ride the down cycle trough that GPS is
apparently in. I will assume it's a cycle, a fashion cycle, and that the
company can get financing to last through this until they better align their
products with what customers will buy - maybe that will be two or more seasons.

I see negative reports in the media that GPS might/could/may be in serious
trouble (these reports may be what's concerning this woman), but there are also
several astute professional value-type investors who are in this stock (based
on 2001 data that I have), so that's an offset to the negatives. OTOH, we don't
have anyone here clambering to buy this stock now. That is a big negative imo.

As a long time GPS holder, let me chime in. I agree with Mr. Clarke that
bankruptcy is not an immediate concern, although Gap certainly can't afford to
have another disastrous year. The one thing I would point out is that, as an
employee, your wife's friend is in a much better position to make a judgment on
this than she thinks. The key factors for a Gap turnaround are a better handle
on merchandise selection, more timely delivery of merchandise, and overall
better management of their supply chain. She is right there at the front and
should be able to judge this. Are the new computer systems finally working
effectively? Are the stores busy? How is the merchandise moving? Are they still
marking down like crazy, or has that finally stopped? Is the merchandise
arriving from the warehouse when it is supposed to? Have they cut down on the
lead time required for their overseas suppliers?

For portfolio allocation issues and the like, she might want to consider
consulting a professional. But assuming her overall financial house is in
order, she probably has a lot more insight on her investment than she thinks.

When you speak of asset allocation what do you mean? I know what the phrase
means, but I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on implementation.

<<When you speak of asset allocation what do you mean?>>Good question. Most
broadly, when you look at the type of situation Paul brought up, or any
situation involving retirement fund strategy, I would define asset allocation
broadly. That is, to include employment as an 'earning asset' as well as real
estate such as equity in a personal home. A high concentration in an employers
stock in a retirement account results in compounded risk because of job
exposure and perhaps risk to the value of home equity if the employer, like
Enron, is a substantial presence in the area. But from the stand point of
keeping it simple, the retirement account should be considered part of the
overall portfolio and unless one has extraordinary competence [inside info]
with regard to a holding, concentration in a single issue shouldn't exceed 10%
of total assets, equity holdings should represent a cross section of industries
[read mutual fund] and shorter duration assets [money market for emergency fund
outside of retirement] or short term bond funds should be considered if there
are near term needs. Generally the market, when it's working, prices assets
based on the idea that business risk can be diversified out. So a concentration
in a single issue is a bad deal from a risk return perspective...unless you
have a decided edge with regard to analyzing that issue.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket unless you're a stone expert on baskets
generally and that basket in particular. Even then, know that you can get it
wrong.

But 20 to 30 analysts follow this and some of them visit stores weekly
interviewing employees. For an employee to be led to beleive he/she will be
ahead of the curve when the turn involves credit [What manner of evil hides in
covenants], fashion and, from Mark's comments, logistics as well, is a mistake.

Some analysts do this, but where were most of them when the company first ran
into problems and they all had strong buys on the stock? I'll admit that I
don't read every analyst, but I still have read nothing from any of them on the
systems problems Gap has had. They were a little better on covering the fashion
goofs, but they were still well behind the curve when it came to downgrading
the stock, and they didn't tell me anything I couldn't find out for myself by
going into the stores and looking at the traffic and the markdowns.

I agree that the financing issues can get much more complicated, although once
again I'm not seeing much of use coming from the analysts other than a
generalized fretting over the debt level. But even here employees, even part
time ones, are not completely clueless. When a company begins to experience
cash problems there are usually plenty of signs at the employee level.
Seemingly irrational cutbacks in expenditure, deferral of maintenance,
cancellation of projects, the signs are always there.

You are right that someone asking those types of questions should be seeking
help for some of the issues, especially the overall portfolio ones. But I also
think she can take a lot more responsibility for the areas in which she has
some advantages over the rest of the world.

Mark, In response to Paul, I mentioned minimum operating lease obligations of
$5.4 Billion. Since I use enterprise value that includes debt, I'm curious how
others might see this...should it be considered part of the debt structure,
partially so, or ignored...? Any thoughts?
In my message, the key take away is that in a well-followed company, analysts
will be better informed about a company's situation and prospects than a
low-level employee in a store. This doesn't mean that they are highly likely to
predict the problems or the turns...especially regarding internal systems.
Upper management and perhaps systems analysts might pick that up early, but not
retail employees. A retail employee might see that the new fashion offering is
going well...but does success in San Francisco mean it's working in Peoria?

Regarding operating leases....some of my thoughts:

If I first view this situation from a personal financial planning paradigm, how
would I account for rent in my equations? If I were on a month-to-month lease
instead of a multi-year lease would it make any difference from an analysis of
my finances? Would the difference it make be significant in understanding my
cash flow?

I think that the lease amount in this situation would go against current
liabilities but I would not count anything against long-term liabilities,
unless the purpose of the accounting was for bankruptcy filing (in which case
there would be more long-term liability in a longer term lease).

Taking the personal perspective to the business paradigm, similar thinking
applies. If I am attempting to arrive at a total liabilities number in a
bankruptcy situation, then I would factor in the long term leases(although the
total amount may be discounted somewhat under the presumption that a portion of
the obligation would be discharged), in all other scenarios I would only count
the current portion.

My rationale is that the lease is just a method of standardizing the rate and
term of the monthly or yearly rental situation. It serves to benefit both
lessee and landlord. If I would only count a yearly lease against current
obligations, why would I treat a multi-year agreement any differently?

I'm at work, so admittedly I haven't thought through this response as much as
perhaps I would have over the weekend, but I think this is the essence of my
position. I am always willing to modify the positions however if another,
clearer method of thinking is presented.

Jeff B., Jim C., Mark M., Bob R: Thanks all for comments related to GPS.

I talked with my wife’s friend and conveyed a summary of thread responses
regarding Gap prospects and other factors that affect a decision, such as the
portion that GPS is of the portfolio, prudent asset allocation, and risk
tolerance.

She tells me the amount of GPS is only a small amount – she had sold most of it
when the stock got to the $70’s, after she held through several stock splits.
Her big concern is that GPS does not become another K-Mart now and GPS stock go
to 99 cents.

(I don’t like it that I now have the feeling this “novice” investor might be a
more successful investor than I am. –g-
And maybe on days like today I ought to be asking HER for advice on what to do.
–g-
Must be that Lynch thing – she bought the one mall company she knew, and she
held on until the right time to sell.)

She says based on what she feels and what she hears from me (us) now, she will
hold her shares “for a while”.

Aside: In our conversation I said that I don’t own GAP and that there were no
people on the thread who said they were enthused about the stock now or Gap
business or clothes. Then I mentioned to her of reading here where a couple of
people do shop –Coach, Abercrombie, etc., and I asked this woman about having
alternative choices for her money if she did sell her GAP shares. I said for
example that I own Quicksilver (Roxy brand), Gadzooks, and Skechers. She
commented that Quicksilver stock ought to work out well – its Roxy is VERY
popular with her kids and their friends. I mention this fwiw – which is not
much – very anecdotal. Nevertheless, I’m hoping she is as right about that
stock as she apparently has been about GPS.

Operating Leases & Enterprise value - This is what I've come to so far: If
operating leases aren't a substantial part of the business, just ignore them.
If they are then look at a lease adjusted version of EV/EBITDA that reflects
addition of the present value of the leases in EV+L *AND* adjusts EBITDA TO
reflect adding back of rent which is the normal return on the leases. Just as
enterprise value that includes debt has, as a denominator income that includes
interest [Earnings BEFORE Interest] as payment for the debt capital, the rent
expense would be added back to earnings as payment for the lease capital. So we
get EVL/EBITDAR:
Not as a universal substitute for the EV/EBITDA multiple, since there's no
published comparables, but as another way to look at a business where operating
leases are important.

Any opinions on AES? $12.27 now.

AES Aims to Demystify Its Reporting, Which Has Long Befuddled Investors

By CHAD TERHUNE
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Even before the collapse of Enron Corp., energy giant AES Corp. was trying to
explain itself better to bewildered investors. Now the stakes are suddenly much
higher.

Investors will get their first taste of the company's expanded financial
reporting when AES releases fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday and follows up with
a two-day investors' conference in Florida, which will be available over the
Internet. AES, which builds, buys and operates power plants, long has befuddled
Wall Street and investors with its complex operations, which span 40 countries.
It has been one of the most aggressive U.S. companies to invest in overseas
energy and telecommunications markets, often buying assets in newly privatized
markets that other U.S. companies are ignoring or leaving.

It isn't the reliance of the Arlington, Va., company on its foreign markets per
se that is making investors and analysts increasingly antsy; indeed, these days
many big companies such as Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines
Corp. and Boeing Co. get lots of their sales and profits from business abroad.
But AES critics, noting that the company obtains a big chunk of its cash flow
from Latin America, and is particularly dependent on the volatile Brazilian
economy, complain they are often left in the dark on how the company accounts
for its earnings from foreign entities.

Its depressed stock price -- AES shares are down 83% from their high in 2000
($70.63) -- underscores how today's investors are wary of companies with
hard-to-understand businesses or opaque results. As of 4 p.m. Monday in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, AES shares fell $1.03, or 8%, to $12.27.

Until recently, Wall Street largely took AES management's word on future
performance and risk as the company nearly tripled revenue to $6.69 billion in
2000 from $2.39 billion two years earlier. "AES was definitely a trust-me
story," says Bob Becker, portfolio manager for the $1.4 billion Franklin
Utilities Fund, a unit of Franklin Resources Inc., of San Mateo, Calif. "It
worked for many years as the company successfully navigated devaluations and
concerns about coup d'&#233;tats where they do business. Now it remains to be
seen how far the company will go" in unlocking its accounting practices.
Franklin Utilities Fund owns 125,000 AES convertible preferred shares.

AES vowed to do better after surprising investors with a profit warning Sept.
26, saying its full-year earnings would be down about a quarter from its
previous forecast to analysts. The news knocked nearly 50% off AES shares,
closing that day at $12.25. AES blamed the 2001 earnings shortfall on the weak
Brazilian currency, declining power prices in the United Kingdom and the
canceled purchase of an Arizona power plant.

AES has said it expects to report fourth-quarter earnings of 25 cents to 35
cents a share, before any charges for such things as restructuring, currency
translations or divestitures. In the year-earlier quarter, AES posted net
income of $221 million, or 46 cents a share. Revenue through the first nine
months of 2001 increased 29% to $7 billion.

Shortly after the September profit warning, AES President and Chief Executive
Dennis W. Bakke sought to reassure institutional holders in face-to-face
meetings in the U.S. and United Kingdom. On Oct. 8, Mr. Bakke stopped by the
California offices of Franklin Resources. "Dennis said they were making a
significant effort to make the company easier to understand," Mr. Becker says.
"The plummeting stock price was a wake-up call to them."

AES plans to report additional segments within its power-generation and
distribution businesses, but the company acknowledges it may never give the
details some analysts and investors want. AES declined to specify exactly what
information will be in Tuesday's earnings report. During recent weeks, other
power companies have resorted to lengthy tutorials on their accounting
practices to extinguish any whiff of Enron-related shenanigans on their books.

AES critics say they have seen no evidence of the misuse of off-balance-sheet
partnerships or special-purpose vehicles to hide debt or inflate earnings
problems that plagued Enron. So far, about the only tie to the Enron meltdown
has been that former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling initiated a short sale on AES
shares during late August, gambling that the power company's share price would
tumble.

AES obtained more than 40% of its cash flow from Latin America in 2000, and the
company's business in Brazil particularly confounds Wall Street and investors.
Paul Fremont, analyst at Jefferies & Co., says Brazilian financial statements
show that AES earned less than $80 million in 2000 from its ownership stake in
three energy-distribution companies there. In its financial statements, AES
reports $426 million in operating earnings from those affiliates during 2000.
"This is a large piece of their accounting we don't understand," says Mr.
Fremont, who downgraded the stock to "hold" after the September profit warning.
"In our view, it's a conscious decision not to disclose information to
investors."

Kenneth Woodcock, senior vice president of investor relations at AES, says
there is frequently a discrepancy between results reported elsewhere and AES
results in the U.S. due to differing accounting standards in each country.

"Generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. and Kazakhstan GAAP are
very different," he says. "In certain categories, an item that would be
expensed is capitalized under different accounting principles. That can turn
one quarter from profitable to a loss."

Mr. Woodcock says the company doesn't share details on the numerous accounting
adjustments applied to Brazilian results or for other foreign entities.

Other investors and analysts were troubled by AES booking $86 million in
revenue for the second and third quarters from the Brazilian government as
compensation for electricity rationing there. Dot Matthews, senior utilities
analyst at CreditSights Inc. in New York, says most companies would put aside a
reserve because the rationing payments are contingent upon the government
collecting a consumer tariff during the next three to four years. Wall Street
worries that an uncertain economy or changes in political leadership in Brazil
could jeopardize those payments to AES. "In Brazil, who knows if they'll get
paid," says Ms. Matthews, who advised bondholders to sell AES debt starting
last summer. "I want to see the cash."

AES said a reserve wasn't deemed necessary because it has an agreement with the
Brazilian government for the rationing compensation.

Further deterioration in Latin America economies is a concern among credit
analysts. Debt-rating agency Fitch Inc. put AES on a negative rating watch in
December, citing the Latin American risk, weaker earnings prospects in the
United Kingdom and negative sentiment in the capital markets toward the entire
energy sector. As of Sept. 30, AES had total debt of $22.15 billion.

In response to the increased concerns, AES has said it is reducing
discretionary spending and looking to sell some assets to shore up its balance
sheet.

<<<If I am attempting to arrive at a total liabilities number in a bankruptcy
situation, then I would factor in the long term leases>>>

Actually, bankruptcy law allows the debtor to reject leases without penalty.

Where lease obligations start looking like debt is when a company is forced to
down size to curb expenses. A good example is SCNT, which I don't own, trade
sometimes, and am not overly impressed with at the moment because of their
recent merger and cash burn. Scient was one of Wall Street's darlings during
the Internet boom and was experiencing huge growth. As a result of their rapid
growth and mass hiring, they assumed huge commitments for lease space to
accommodate their expansion. When the bottom fell out of their market, and they
laid off around 80% of their employees, they were stuck with a huge overhead in
unused space with long term leases.

In a healthy company lease obligations are basically just normal operating
expenses quarter to quarter. Where leases start looking like debt is a
situation like SCNT where they have to either pay for space they are unable to
utilize or negotiate some kind of a settlement to cancel the lease.

I agree with what you say in your post. I am not up on bankruptcy law, but had
anecdotal evidence from the KM news stories that bankruptcy offered them a way
out of their non-performing leases. In my post, I think I indicated that I
thought the long term leases obligations in a bankruptcy would be discounted
somewhat due to the court discharging some of the obligation. There would still
be some obligation until the date of discharge however (at least it seems like
it would work that way).

I agree with your point about heavy overhead for down-sized companies with full
size lease commitments. My method of using Positive Free Cash Flow as one of
the main determinants of suitability would generally show such companies to be
less favorable investments as their current portion of the lease would be
listed as part of current liabilities would negatively affect current cash
flow. If that effect is such that the cash flow doesn't look attractive for the
price of the stock, I move on.

Bob Rudd:

What a mouthful of a post! :~)

I don't yet use EV/EBITDA as part of my regular valuation techniques. I think
that is because I don't feel as comfortable using "earnings" as I do "free cash
flow".

Having said that, it seems as though the EVL/EBITDAR reasoning would account
for the lease situation after a fashion. But my question is: Is it appropriate
to treat a lease like a mortgage? I mean if we put the "L" on the EV side then
we are treating it just like any other long term debt. I'm mixed on the
appropriateness of that approach. On the one hand, a lease is a commitment, but
so are other negotiated arrangements (like long term bulk discounts). On the
other hand, if there was no lease, I wouldn't have anything listed on long term
obligations, but still the same impact (or worse) on working capital.

I've decided that I really don't go out my way to factor the long term lease
obligation in unless I'm thinking of going against my better judgement that has
been based on free cash flow analysis. In this case, I might look at a
favorable development in lease commitment release of obligations to evaluate
the impact on cash flow.

The FCF equivalent of EVL/EBITDAR would be EVL/FCF+R since FCF is a replacement
of EBITDA...The reason I use EBITDA despite serious flaws is that accrual
accounting tends to smooth it by matching expenses with the appropriate period
regardless of when the cash goes out. FCF bounces around for reasons unrelated
to health of the business. Three other reasons I use EBITDA are convenience...I
can put together EV/EBITDA from a Yahoo profile in under a minute, the EV
portion removes the effect of debt that distorts PE or P/FCF, and it has become
popular...for both quick and dirty valuation and as takeover potential
indicator. I use FCF as a check on it....if there's a multiperiod divergence, I
look for why.
Here's a great peice on various multiples I stumbled across:

motivation for the KMART bankruptcy...they had 250 or so LT leases on already
closed stores and other stores with lease obligations they wanted to close.
Only thru bankruptcy would they get out from under those obligations. With The
GAP suffering hard times, I see similarities. A retrenchment by closing
underperforming stores would leave them with lease obligations. Since the
Operating lease obligations listed in 2000 K of $5.4 B were 41% of EV without
lease inclusion [$13.26 B], and since lease obligations, like debt can usually
only be avoided thru bankruptcy, the case of doing some sort of lease adjusted
supplementary multiple looks strong.

On XICO, not a value stock, note this post of mine yesterday in response to
some short who showed up:

http://messages.yahoo.com/bbs?.mm=FN&action=m&board=4687949&tid=xico&sid=468794
&mid=27519

You should read recent releases and listen to the conference call, with some
frames of reference:

-The historical track record was due to founder and former CEO R. Klein who is
no longer affiliated with the company in any way.

-He was replaced by Dan McCranie current Chairman of the Board and recently
retired #2 man at CY. Also added to Board was Manny Hernandez, current CFO of
CY.

-McCranie brought to the company CEO Lou DiNardo from a senior position at LLTC
where he was in charge of some Mixed Signal product lines (sales background).
He got 600,000 options at $3.75, which I have heard he needs many times the
current XICO price to make up for what he left behind at LLTC. Also, several
other high level people have been recruited from first class companies. These
recent guys came in the recession with their eyes wide open.

-These folks are bringing product development leadership and sales expertise to
a company which owns (key point) unexploited, proprietary Intellectual
Property, which will enable them to address NEW large markets - and potentially
do very well despite the economy (in 2003).

-Products are being announced regularly now and new-IP is starting to be
publicized (listen to CC). But in this industry there is AT LEAST a 6-month
lead time from product announcement to material sales.

-Recent private convertible note was issued convertible just above $11 to
institutions, mostly to Templeton, to ensure they have the needed financial
resources to succeed - although they had a good cash position already.

-For most of this year I believe reported results will be unspectacular - but
announcements will make the future increasingly clear as the year goes on.

A valuation parallel that I like is CYMI, which is losing minor money now but
is making new highs because the Street believes they can make $4 per share in
the next recovery. In my opinion, Xicor is not there yet in terms of full
understanding and recognition of its potential by the Street, but it is covered
and it presents to the Street regularly. For example, I believe there is a
presentation at Robertson Stephens later this month.

I have owned the stock for 8 years and my view of the future stock price is
well said by XicoBull on Yahoo, who has been involved as long as I have:

http://messages.yahoo.com/bbs?.mm=FN&action=m&board=4687949&tid=xico&sid=468794
&mid=27521

The Yahoo thread is excellent except for the occasional short who shows up -
many sophisticated investors who know the company and industry very well.

I have recommended to my own family that they buy the stock, on an increasing
scale if the stock declines further, starting now and ending at $6.

Hope, this helps.

not purchased), mostly from a Peter Lynch standpoint - I've used the product,
and am interested in it. The company is also HQd near me, in Montreal, and has
opened up a manufacturing facility nearby in Plattsburgh, NY.
Does anyone on this thread know anything, or have an opinion on OPMR (Optimal
Robotics)? The company manufactures, and markets, self serve checkout machines.
They compete with NCR, and perhaps others, in this market.
They are projected to grow smartly in the coming years.
Currently the machines are used primarily in grocery stores, but drug stores
and the likes of Home Depot (which is testing both OPMR and NCR machines) are
probably on the way.
Any comments?
TIA,
Wallace

Wallace, I took a casual look at OPMR. It looks like sales are flattening out.
That would be a critical investment issue, if true. It looks to be selling at
20 times last quarter's annualized results. That is probably reasonable unless
major additional sales growth is ahead. The patent suit is an issue I can't
quantify. Solid balance sheet.

The chart looks kind of poor, with the stock going from nothing to the 40's and
then trending down except for a blip last year.

Mike Burry pick of IBA looks good to me. I've been watching the stock also,
after Dale Baker mentioned an egg producer stock he was buying. I've been
hoping to buy around low 8. Now that Mike has posted on it in his column, I'll
place an order to buy a little bit at current price, even as it's over his buy
price of $8.50. This stock jumps around on low volume; if MSN followers buy,
stock could rise substantially.

Note high dividend. I'm still trying to figure out how that's paid, and if
before/after Mexican withholding taxes.

On ELN, I think Mike will be right for technical reasons - the stock is due for
a rally regardless of anything else, just like it temporarily went from $22 to
$29. However, for me, quality of management, including honesty and integrity,
is the single most important investment criterion. My view is that to
paraphrase the old saying is appropriate. "If you knowingly lie down with dogs,
you deserve to get fleas". ELN is a trade only.

Without having looked at the fundamentals closely, it would seem to me that if
they have questionably booked payments from partners as revenue, you end up
with overstated earnings and phony cash flow, which disappears when the
partnership schemes stop.

That does not mean that pure product revenue and R&D aren't worth more than the
current stock price, in comparison with what the market pays for the same thing
elsewhere. It may well be.

Both the science and the accounting are beyond me, so this is a low conviction

Paul - IBA: It's probably a weakness of mine that when I look at a chart that's

can't get excited about it.
On the other hand...given the same set of valuation parameters, but a chart

Yeah, I've been considering that short-term aspect of ELN also.

I am trying to play it as if ELN has a real business and that eventually, the
stock will recover to somewhere near its avg. annual price. I am trying to
convince myself that I may have to hold the position a couple of years.

OTOH, it's likely imo, most people are interested in trying to trade this thing
for maybe 20-50% quick gains. That is all their expectation is for this stock.
And that the price gains come quickly so that they can capture them and move
on. That may be much better than my idea of ltb&h. Mike Burry is in a contest
on MSN: ELN could be very suitable as a stock that provides quick trading gains
to power his portfolio.

Wallace, regarding your inquiry of BMY. I'm holding my shares. My positions
were acquired years ago, and it surely looks like I ought to have sold anytime
in the past couple or more years - BMY is now at a four-year low.

They don't seem to be doing anything right, right now. Overpaid and/or did not
do enough dd on their purchase of Imclone. Could not get their potential
blockbuster Vanlev through an FDA review. And lost patent protection on an
important drug.

Analysts have said the worst is over for BMY - but they were saying that when
BMY was 48-50, and now BMY is at 43-44
-g-.

Normally, I'd be adding to my shares (I tried that at 55 level -- oops), but
now I'm just a little too frozen to add to an already overly large position.

If you are looking at BMY, I'd guess you might be looking at others too for
diversification. MRK, SGP are out of favor - so they may be candidates. You
might check out BAY too, which has very recently commenced trading on the NYSE.
Spekulatius' pick of PHA might work at this 36-38 level. (I keep considering
buying, but I am just very afraid of the falling knives in the sector.)

I am assuming these pharmaceutical stocks will return to investors' favor. The
companies have historically produced successful drugs and have sold at high
multiples of eps, sales, book. However, given recent warnings by many of the
companies, of earnings disappointments (declines!) and patent expirations, this
year imo will be terrible for them. So there may be much more downside to these
stocks than we have seen.

The question for anyone venturing into these stocks now is, imo, "How long do
you plan to be in for?"

I am hoping that 2003 will be a recovery year. But who knows?

FWIW, I think SAFM deals with the chickens, not the eggs. As long as it keeps
going up, I don't plan to pry, however.

Sanderson Farms Inc. is a fully integrated poultry processing company engaged
in the production, processing, marketing and distribution of fresh and frozen
chicken products. In addition, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sanderson
Farms, Inc. (Foods Division), the Company is engaged in the processing,
marketing and distribution of processed and prepared food items. The Company
sells ice pack, chill pack and frozen chicken, in whole, cut-up and boneless

distributors, and fast food operators principally in the southeastern,
southwestern and western United States. The Company's chicken operations
presently encompass five hatcheries, four feed mills, six processing plants and
one by-products plant.

ELN: Merrill, which recently downgraded to neutral offered 3 scenarios that
boil down to 1.46 in 02 with 6.7%, 11% & 15.5% earnings growth thru 06. The
lowball reflects increased generic competition for Zanatec which they consider
unlikely; the high est reflects successful purchase of other products that fit
their system. Major fraud wasn't on their radar screen. That may be because
it's so difficult to catch.
In Barron's 'They Get Credit' interview piece on credit analysts, they flatly
state: "Nothing can protect against fraud."
Another factor that doesn't seem to be on their radar screen would be a
breakthrough on Alzheimers...maybe it did but they forgot about it ;) Anyway,
it would seem the above estimates don't reflect wild card potentials in their
R&D, but the share price seems to reflect a high probability for massive
fraud...a rare and nearly unanalyzable occurrance, IMO.
On Mike's move: I still feel some comfort that physician/value guy Mike sees
enough value in the science to accept the risk. Course some of it is his
contrarian nature...to be against the crowd.

Bob, although as I posted I thought ELN would go up for technical reasons, if
you had read that WSJ article you would not be so comfortable about believing
there wasn't massive fraud.

In my opinion, a key purpose of financial statements is to properly allocate
financial performance by time period. From reading the WSJ article, I would
conclude that ELN couldn't have been further from that view.

Over the years, we have seen examples of misallocation of immense magnitude,
such as huge writeoffs by major corporations, which in effect meant that prior
results were, in effect, misreported (too little depreciation, too small
reserves for obsolete inventory or bad receivables, etc). In the insurance
business you often see cases of large adjustments for incorrect prior estimates
of reserves needed for unpaid claims - something which I personally know is
tougher to determine than a layman would think. In my opinion, ELN and Enron
have brought allocation of financial performance by time period to new lows.

I would be a little careful here about using the word fraud with respect to
ELN. Whether you agreed with what they did or not, it seems that it was ok
according to their accountants. What ENE did is another matter entirely. And
the uselessness of company appointed BODs at protecting shareholders is just
amazing. Hopefully, this is one of the items that will be remedied from all of
these disasters. It sounds like CEPHALON did something similar although perhaps
on a smaller scale-setting up a marketing company where it seems the sole
purpose was to defer reporting marketing costs for two years and then amortize
them over 12 years. Seems like a good deal to me if my bonus is tied in to
profits, controlling costs and share values. I wonder how many CEPHALONS are
out there now.
Leasing companies were notorius for using advantageous income recognition
methods and then overestimating residual values. Oops- meanwhile the executives
took their bonuses and headed off to new leasing companies.

Jeff, Thank you for your recommendation on XICO. I will keep it on my watch
list. My first impression on it did not make me want to own it. I think the
chance for XICO to go up or down is 50-50% for the next half year. I don't see
any sign of big potential long term.

I am watching AWRE to go down a little more to buy. Also have MTLK on watch
list. They are both DSL companies, I think long term high speed Internet access
have good potential, they may have a chance to benefit from that, also they are
both close to "value stock" prices.

BMY and ELN
I do think that BMY is good (and probably the best) bet in the drug sector,
because all the bad news are behind them - the earnings warning, the Imclone
scandal and the Glucophage patent expiration.
This masks some real progress in rejuventating BMY's R&D and pipeline.
SGP is a riskier bet because they are about to loose 30% of their revenues (and
40% of their profits) if the Claritin/Clarinex gamble does not work out.
However i do like their Zetia drug (with Merck).
I have big concern's about about Zocor, MRK's 7.5B$ cholesterol drug for which
the patent is due to expire in Y2006. They may need several blockbusters to
make up for this one alone.

ELN is a very interesting bet at this point. ELN has a very viable pipeline and
trades at a P/S of 2. I don't believe that ELN management is fraudulent, indeed
it has been known for years that ELN's accounting activates R&D costs and
subsequently overestimates profits. However, the money spent in the biotech
ventures has led to real products, so I believe that the company will survive
or will be bought at significant premium (+20$/share).
