A quick look at MAXF Statement of Cash Flows indicates that a lot of the cash
flow appears to be coming from insurance payments for 9/11 when they lost their
offices in the Trade Center and also lost 61 people out of a staff of 300.

The adjustments to income for 2001 include adding 15M for an increase in
accounts payable.

Additionally, the usual method of CFO-CAPEX shows me that they are spending
less on CAPEX than they are depreciating as an average over the last three
years.

You are probably much better versed on MAXF, but for my quick looks, it doesn't
look like an easy job to filter out the 9/11 effects to get a true picture of
cash flow. Cash flow for 2000 and 1999 average about 50 cents/share after I
adjust CAPEX to reflect average depreciation.

I did it with wcom, covd, cmgi (the last 2 were a while ago). I bought ELN
(actually added) but haven't sold the calls yet. Usually the premiums are
pretty rich right after a fall as people buy calls to bet on a quick bounce. It
hasn't been a moneymaking strategy yet but certainly been better than buying
those stocks outright.

To put these accounting scandals in perspective, let me just say I think it
gets worse. There's a lot still to come out here.

Think about this for a minute.

First let me ask if anybody can name a couple examples of "accounting scandal"
stocks which you could have made a significant profit (and kept it) by buying
when it looked cheap? Quick, there must be a couple...still waiting...This is a
fool's game in a bear market in my view and I am staying far away from these
except on the short side. (I made my mistakes shorting the mania three years
ago. Buying sleaze in this environment is the same thing as shorting an
internet stock in 1999. With one exception. With the internet stocks you knew
you were right - the company was clearly worthless - you just didn't know if it
could double again and too often they did. Can anyone explain to me how one
would value a company where the accounting is untrustworthy and there is a lot
of debt? Tyco for example). I think a company where the numbers are uncertain
is outside the discipline of value investing and I just stay away.

Let me give you my thoughts on a catalyst for this accounting thing to get much
worse.

There were five big accounting firms, one of which is very disproportionately
the accountant on so many of these scandals. Andersen was the accountant of
choice for those companies who wanted to play games and were willing to pay
extra fees to the accounting firm to do so, because apparently Andersen would
sign anything if the company paid enough. There is just no other way to explain
Worldcom's last annual report.

And now everybody who formerly retained Andersen has a new accountant poking
around and getting familiar with things. What would you do if you were a new
accounting firm hired by an Andersen client? Would you just assume everything
is OK? In this environment where signing off on a fraud bankrupts a blue chip
accounting firm? Uh, no. You do a proctological audit, and if you find the
slightest little thing you call the company on it. I believe that all former
Andersen clients are in for a very probing audit, and there are going to be
many that the new accountant is going to demand restatements or refuse to sign
off. This will play out over the next 6-12 months and could make the last six
months of accounting scandals look like child's play. There are going to be
companies that will not be able to find an auditor to sign off on their annual
report - I am short one or two of them. This ain't done.

What I would suggest is to look through your portfolio and make sure you know
which stocks were Andersen clients. And if there is the slightest doubt in your
mind about the integrity of management or the integrity of the numbers on those
stocks you are playing with fire.

Its been very difficult for even the best value investors to make money owning
stocks this year. Last year it was easy to make money - this year I have found
it nearly impossible on the long side. I'm mostly on the sidelines now waiting
for stocks to start screaming "BUY ME!" Virtually nothing is screaming at me
now, in stark contrast to the post 9/11 market when everything was screaming
"BUY ME!", and until they do I'm in cash and shorts. I think the market goes
significantly lower before this phase of the bear market is done, not that
there won't be rallies along the way.

It does seem strange that so many of the problems are Arthur Anderson but there
must have been several different people involved in the various audits. I am
more concerned about the lack of appropriate corporate governance than the
quality of the accounting. What reasonable board of directors authorizes a
company to lend over $400MM to any excutive secured by company stock. This is
just bad business practice and I feel exactly the same way about repricing
options , and giving executives bonusses when the stock of the company crater
and they write off billions of dollars of assets which they overpaid for.
Unfortunately we have rewarded CEO s in the past several years for creating
companies , taking on debt and creating revenues, not for generating profits or
creating viable economic entities. There have not been any penalties for
covering up bad news until the last possible moment , or offering misleading
projections to the investing public. I think that shareholders will have to end
up appointing a board of directors that is completely independent of
management.
This is not the first time that there has been devastation caused by faulty
accounting standards coupled with a downturn in the economy.
The other problem is all of the investment banks/major brokerage houses floated
hundreds of ipos- the vast majority of whom have already failed or are
teetering.. there has to be some responsibility for a creditable financial
company to do some due dilligence and not just do a deal because they can make
6% on it. Right now out of hundred of ipo-s it looks like AOL ebay and yahoo
are survivors. and there have been some horrible looking deals along the way.
Most of the ipos brought out by MOrgan Stanley Merill Lynch and Goldman have
faired poorly.
So experience had now taught us that we cant rely on the brokerage house we
cant rely on the investment banks we cant rely on company information and we
cant rely on financial statements. Not much is left.

J. K. Galbraith describes the phenomenon in his book on the '29 crash:

“In many ways the effect of the crash on embezzlement was more significant than
on suicide. To the economist embezzlement is the most interesting of crimes.
Alone among the various forms of larceny it has a time parameter. Weeks,
months, or years may elapse between the commission of the crime and its
discovery. (This is a period, incidentally, when the embezzler has his gain and
the man who has been embezzled, oddly enough, feels no loss. there is a net
increase in psychic wealth.) At any given time there exists an inventory of
undiscovered embezzlement in—or more precisely not in—the country’s businesses
and banks. This inventory—it should perhaps be called the bezzle—amounts at any
moment to many millions of dollars. It also varies in size with the business
cycle. In good times people are relaxed, trusting and money is plentiful. But
even though money is plentiful, there are always many people who need more.
Under these circumstances the rate of embezzlement grows, the rate of discovery
falls off, and bezzle increases rapidly. In depression all this is reversed.
Money is watched with a narrow, suspicious eye. The man who handles it is
assumed to be dishonest until he proves himself otherwise. Audits are
penetrating and meticulous. Commercial morality is enormously improved. The
bezzle shrinks.”

From:sjemmeri
A lot too summarize so I suggest you check out the very active ELN thread but
here's how I see it.
There are 3 major issues:
1) Sector got the stuffing knocked out of it (they are sort of half
biotech/half pharma as they have several products on the market). This would
probably account for half the drop even if nothing else happened.
2) Overhang of accounting issues and SEC investigation. They have a complicated
structure with lots of joint ventures. For many of these, they invested in
joint ventures then were paid for technology licenses. The good side of this is
they have pieces of lots of potential drugs. I first became interested as they
looked almost like a mini-mutual fund of small cap biotechs which I couldn't
find anywhere else. They were investigated by SEC once before with a minor
restatement as the result.
3) A chunk of outstanding debt due next year - wouldn't be an issue if they
weren't already beaten down from #1 and #2.
Other minor issues such as generic competition for 1 drug earlier than
expected, a disappointment on a drug test, etc.
I think they are worth 10x the current price without any sector/market recovery
if they can get past the debt (which is really an issue of timing as the total
amount is reasonable relative to sales and assets) and no major issue comes
from the SEC (they are narrowing focus, selling non-core assets, etc.).
There's plenty of risk but I think the reward potential is large.

TimbaBear, re: TRCI,

Your net-net is the "Timba net-net", I am guessing. Different from the Graham
net-net of (8.8-1.5)/5.44, which = 1.34, and is higher than the stock's current
$1.21 price. Stock is selling about 11x it's best year's earnings of the past
five years. Revenue seems to be rangebound between $15-18M per annum. Stock has
often traded at or above $2/sh. That'd be a nice percentage gain from today's
$1.21 if the stock once more trades there ($2.00) or higher again.

Unless I could see a catalyst for TRCI though, for me,I'd rather make new stock
market commitments elsewhere. With the market risk apparently very high
(contining downtrend in stocks), I'd rather be looking to make new purchases in
downtrodden companies where at least the business risk is perceived as
low(because of earnings or sales history, or market share, or patents,
resources, etc.)

In other words, for me, given that I have a finite amount of funds to invest,
I'd rather be looking at a Citicorp now(used here as an example, not a
recommendation), where I'm comfortable (but not assured) that the business will
be intact and possibly grow--- and that if there ever is a market upturn, there
might be a decent chance that the company might participate. Whereas, while
committing funds to TRCI @1.21 offers support from the balance sheet, it's more
iffy to me that TRCI would participate in an up market. OTOH, if it did, I'd
guess the percentage rise in TRCI might surpass the percentage rise in a
Citicorp.

Hi Paul!

I'm not sure what formula of Graham you are using, but my NetNet formula IS
almost purely Graham's method of discounting the various asset classes by
various percentages, totaling the results, subtracting 100% of the liabilities
and then dividing the answer by the number of shares. The only "liberties" I
take with his methodology are that I don't count real estate at 50% if it is
already greatly depreciated(especially in the current real estate environment)
and I don't break out inventories into raw, in-process and finished, but
rather, take the whole inventory and discount it by 1/3.

You would like to see a catalyst for TRCI? How about the increase in military
budgeting and the fact that they used to be entirely dependent on military
contracts and now have 35% of their revenue stream still coming from there? Or
possibly the real estate building boom that is occurring when they supply the
GFI circuit-breakers that have become mandatory in so many building codes?

Regardless of whether either of these or something else is a catalyst or isn't,
the purpose of value investing for me is to buy cash flow cheaply. I get
.37/share cash flow versus my entry price of 1.27. That means they are
producing 29% of increased real value for my investment dollar. Sooner or later
the market will recognize that and price it accordingly. I don't know when or
why, I just believe I bought a nice return on my equity with a substantial
margin of safety from both the NetNet value and the 5% dividend rate.

As far as C is concerned: I haven't done an analysis of C, but when Enron and
WorldCom and Global Crossing and KMart, etc. started going down the tubes with
big debts on the books, I just figure that the biggest US Bank has some
exposure. I don't know how to quantify that exposure partly because they don't
list it by company and partly because I'm not privvy to their underwriting
standards or consistancy of application. I also don't know what exposure they
have to overseas liability or where.

C is just an example of the problem I have with banks, finance companies and
insurance companies. I'm sure that you are far more qualified than I to analyze
these type of companies, so I'll have to take your word for it. I advised a
friend of mine to get out of C in March and he did at about 49. The advice at
that time was based on the cockroach theory as they were being linked in some
way with the Enron blow-up. I forget the particulars now. But, given the
stock's performance since then, he's happy he followed my advice. Could have
just been dumb luck.

Given the way the charts are looking, I don't think I'd be in any hurry to
employ new money in equities right now. It looks to me like bad times mostly
from now through March and maybe into April. But, that's another type of
thread! :~)

I always appreciate your input, Paul. I may not always sound like it, but I do.
Good Luck, and be defensive!

That was an excellent post. I agree with everything you said.

I, too, feel that neither the accounting scandals, nor the market drops are
anywhere near being done.

This is not a good time to be fully invested (or on margin, even). When this
has run its course those with money left to employ will reap the outsized
returns. By the time this correction is over, I suspect there will be a lot of
value on sale and too few players, perhaps, to drive it up very quickly.

Bargain Hunters Take Look At Depressed Biotech Shares

By AARON ELSTEIN
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE

Biotechnology stocks, for years the ultimate in boom-and-bust investing, have
lately been mostly a bust. But investors who once avoided them like a plague
are now poking around for value.

These stocks once fetched hundreds of dollars a share on little more than the
promise of a potential new medical treatment. But with a bear market and
concerns about the pace of the development and approval of new drugs, among
other worries, the American Stock Exchange Biotech Index fell 30% in the second
quarter and is down 62% from its March 2000 high, and individual stocks have
fallen even more.

Take Diversa Corp., an unprofitable San Diego developer of enzymes for medical
and agricultural purposes. The shares hit $169 shortly after the company went
public in 2000, but now go for $7.41, a 96% plunge. That's about the right
price to attract investors such as Preston Athey, who manages T. Rowe Price
Small Cap Value Fund. He has been adding Diversa to his portfolio in hopes of
getting the same two- and threefold gains he got from biotechs after they
slumped in 1995 and 1998.

"When these stocks fall into the bottom 10% of their range, I buy them," he
says. "Actually, I rent these stocks. These aren't the kind you want to hold
forever." Biotech stocks account for less than 1% of the stocks in Mr. Athey's
fund, according to regulatory filings.

Jay Markowitz, a biotech analyst at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, compares
bargain-hunters' interest in biotechs these days to Warren Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. agreeing last week to participate in a $500 million investment in
Level 3 Communications Inc. Mr. Buffett had shunned telecommunications and tech
stocks for years. "Biotech valuations are in such a state that people who
ordinarily wouldn't look at [the sector] are looking at it," he says.

David Brady, a money manager at Stein, Roe & Farnham Inc. in Chicago,
traditionally hasn't kept many biotech stocks in his portfolio. But he has been
adding Genentech Corp., a South San Francisco, Calif., drug company. He now has
$11 million of Genentech stock in his portfolio, a 1.4% chunk. "The biotech
stocks are extraordinarily cheap now," he says. "Maybe the pipeline of new
drugs is better there than for the big pharmaceutical companies. So I think
it's worth having some exposure there."

Another stock Mr. Athey finds "attractive" is NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Salt
Lake City, which is developing drugs for gastrointestinal and
central-nervous-system disorders although none have gotten beyond the
clinical-trial stage. Mr. Athey says he first bought the stock in 1998 at $6 a
share and sold most of it when the shares rose as high as $52.50 in 2000, and,
after a dip, he sold again when it climbed as high as $41.14 in December. But
the stock has since been hit hard amid news of manufacturing problems, and now
fetches about $17. The company had a first-quarter net loss of $22 million, or
73 cents a share, on revenue of $787,000.

The biotech sector has certainly seen its share of setbacks. ImClone Systems
Inc. has fallen about 90% since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said late
last year that it would refuse to approve the New York company's proposed
cancer treatment and its former chief executive was charged with insider
trading.

Meanwhile, investors say the FDA seems to be taking a more cautious approach
toward approving many new drugs, though the FDA says on its Web site
(www.fda.gov) that the median time to approve nonpriority drugs has been
holding "relatively steady." Some investors attribute the FDA's apparent
caution to the agency lacking a commissioner since George W. Bush was
inaugurated last year. But analysts at Prudential Securities told clients last
week that even if a new commissioner is selected, it's unlikely the FDA would
change course.

On the earnings front, biotech bellwether Biogen Inc. last month lowered
forecasts based on weak sales of its multiple-sclerosis drug, blaming slower
growth in the U.S. market and significant reductions in wholesaler-inventory
levels. And Genzyme Corp. guided down 2002 sales of its dialysis drug, also
citing inventory issues.

Given such sluggishness, some biotech specialists see little reason to step up
buying. Brian Clifford, manager of SunAmerica Biotech/Health Fund, says his
fund has 16% of assets in cash now, which he says is higher than normal and
tied to difficulty in finding stocks at attractive prices, even after the
sector's drop. "Outside of the dozen or so companies that make money and can be
valued pretty much like any other, with biotech you're talking mostly about
companies in the development stage and the math that goes into valuing them
gets looser," he says.

Indeed, few investors agree on what "value" in biotech stocks means. Mr.
Markowitz, the T. Rowe analyst, says one reason Diversa seems attractively
priced is that the company has about $5 a share of cash and short-term
investments. More conventional valuation tools, such as price-to-earnings
ratios, don't apply to Diversa, which had a first-quarter net loss of $7
million, or 20 cents a share, on revenue of $7.2 million.

But you can't necessarily judge a biotech's health by its cash. Consider Celera
Genomics, a publicly traded business of Applera Corp. The unit had $608 million
of cash on its books as of March 31 and currently has a market capitalization
of about $720 million, with shares at just over $10, down from $276 in 2000.
While shares of the profitless Norwalk, Conn., company, which aims to make
money by selling data on the human genome, might seem a bargain with all that
cash, the company is expected to use about $120 million of it this year.
"Despite the fact that CRA's share price is approaching cash, lack of
foreseeable near-term catalysts and the early stage of CRA's therapeutic
pipeline lead us to reiterate our hold rating," wrote Credit Suisse First
Boston analysts in a recent report.

Dave, regarding TYC:

I choose to believe that TYC stock at current levels is a decent value
representing the real companies they bought with debt and higher-priced Tyco
stock.

------------------
On the TYC thread I recently posted the names of several value funds that have
bought TYC at what might be 20 or below. In my limited experience,it's not
usual that I see these funds agreeing on a particular stock. Or agreeing, that
they would be wrong. But they could be. So my position in TYCO is just one
among a diversified portfolio.

I expect to continue to be a long-term holder of the stock. (I originally
received TYC shares when they bought CIT which I owned.) I've added more TYC as
the stock has dropped.

If there's no further bad news announced, and if the stock drops to ll+ again,
I'll again consider adding more to my position.

Well, I tried going through their financials last weekend, but I gave up. My

On one hand, there has been such bad press concerning Accounting Irregularities
with Tyco. That scares me. The last thing I want to do is own a company with
the "Accounting Irregularity" Dark Cloud hanging overhead.

Now, on the other hand, I have noticed that many "value funds" have purchased
Tyco since it was in the low 20s. It appears that these funds or perhaps
different funds have purchased more. Could all these fund managers be wrong? Is
there a herd mentality among these fund managers?

Hi Paul!

Isn't your formula called a quick ratio or something like that? I believe that
long-term assets have a value, especially when they are 90%+ in tangible items
like PPE.

In any event, this formula does not account for profitability or cash flow. I
believe once these issues are made part of the determination process, the
performance of the portfolio is more likely to be closer to what I would like
to achieved for my investment dollars.

There is a Chinese curse that goes something like this: "May you live in

Paul: Merrill is out with this on TYC today FWIW: Tyco (TYC; $13.73; D-2-3-7)
Updated Sum-of-Parts Valuation Analysis Sep02E$2.09 03E$2.40
• Tyco's near-term profits and margins may not fully reflect both ultimate
distraction costs and the requirement to focus resources more on driving
organic growth.
• We think, however, that sales versus profits should be more insulated from
downside risk due to Tyco's broad geographic and customer end markets.
• diversified product base, high recurring revenues and customized products.
• We therefore took another cut at our "Sum-of-the-Parts" analysis using only
Enterprise Value/Sales and reduced debt following CIT's IPO.
• Our analysis yields a median value estimate per TYC share of $31 using 5-year
average peer multiples, and $27 using current multiples. Our forecast could be
conservative as we have assigned higher current net debt levels and the
electronics industry could begin to rebound next year.
• The market may opt to wait for the arrival of a new management team (an event
that could be many months away) before it begins to treat Tyco's valuation more
in line with peer averages, we believe. In the interim, the stock could remain
extremely volatile. Still, even if current and new management were to
principally pursue a strategy of liquidation, our analysis suggests there would
appear to be substantial valuation upside from present levels. (J. Inch)

TimbaBear: net-net or net current assets as used by B. Graham is current assets
minus all liabilities (current and long-term).

In my interpretation of how this is used, if an investor uses what I call the
"Jim Clarke approach", where net-nets are carefully further screened for
business prospects or a catalyst, then one would likely also at least consider
off-balance sheet obligations, pension obligations, etc. as liabilities that
are to be subtracted from the current assets figure. Here, one is looking to
buy only a very few "high quality" net-nets.

If one takes the approach that one buys as basket of net-net stocks - if there
even could be such a quantity available today as there was in Dr. Graham's time
- then perhaps Dr. Graham would say the typical investor is likely not to have
the time or inclination to dig out off-balance sheet obligations. And that it
might not be necessary since the basket approach might offset risks that one or
two stocks don't work out because of surprises in off-balance sheet issues.
OTOH, it's my impression that there weren't so many off-balance sheet items in
Dr. Graham's day, so perhaps he might say today to stick with his original
method - find and subtract all these liabilities also.

----------

Quick ratio is quick assets divided by current liabilities. (Where quick assets
are cash, near-cash, and accounts receivable)

Timba,

This is the criteria for a true "value" stock as proposed by Graham

1. Adequate size (Revenues > 100m)
2. A sufficiently strong financial condition (Current Ratio > 2.0)
3. Continued dividends for at least 20 years.
4. No earnings deficit in the past ten years
5. Ten year growth of at least 33% in EPS (remember this is not annualized)
6. Price of stock no more than 1.5 times net asset value adjusted for
intangibles
7. Price no more than 15 times average EPS of the past three years.

Now, in the book "The Intelligent Investor" in Chapter 15, Graham discusses
what is called "Net Current Asset (or "Bargain") Issues. (See Page 205)

Here is a quote from Page 205 regarding this philosophy.

The idea here was to acquire as many issues as posible at a cost for each of
less than their book value in terms of net-current-assets alone - i.e., giving
no vlaue to the plant account and other assets. Our purchases were made
typically at 2/3s or less of such stripped-down asset value. In most years we
carried a wide divesification here- at least 100 different issues

Now, I believe that in order to do a proper analysis of a companies assets and
liabilities, one would need to read and understand all the footnotes to a
company's financial statements and adjust accordingly. For example, if a
company has sold a portion of their A/R, have they guaranteed any portion of
that A/R? If so, that is a potential liability that should be added. What about
operating leases? That should be added.

Nowadays, I believe analyzing a company as a "value" investment has become
quite complex.

Hi Dave!

Do you know of any companies that currently meet all 7 of these criteria?

In my calculation of NetNet value, I use Graham's methodology for discounting
all assets (long and short term). In reading his reasonings, I agreed with his
paradigm of conservative valuation and adopted it as my own.

Many things are different today and many are the same. When he wrote Security
Analysis, the real estate market was also in depression. Additionally, the
value of the real estate and equipment (from what I have been able to gather)
that was carried on the company books was also an inflated value. Today we have
a strong real estate market and real estate seems to be carried at or below
market value and has been depreciated from that value as well. I feel that it
is appropriate to carry PPE valuations for my analysis at his 50% mark, but it
is, to me, more than just taking 1/2 of the number listed for PPE.

Goodwill, on the other hand, seems to me to be rarely worth anything, let alone
50%, so I am quite harsh in my markdowns of that line item.

I agree that analysis is complex today, but I suspect good analysis has always
been so. I have developed a spreadsheet that I use that has 40-50 data fields
and 100 different calculations and manipulations of that data. The process of
reading the 10K's and culling the data is time consuming, so I reserve it for
those stocks that have survived through all of my other, quicker screenings.

I don't believe that I can follow 100 different issues that would comprise a
basket of "bargain issues" so I have tried to adapt Graham's style to my
particular strengths and shortcomings (my wife will confirm that the latter
often seem to outnumber the former). One of those adaptations is the use of
cash flow analysis. I will buy a sufficiently strong cash-flow even it isn't
also a discount price to NetNet.

James Clarke's preference for a dividend opened my eyes to the value added by
that aspect. If I have a decision between several companies, those paying a
dividend will survive the process of elimination (all other things being
similar).

Hi Paul!

Thank you for reminding me of the formula for quick ratio, I have it on my
spread sheet, and probably could have dredged into the forebrain with enough
time, but you made it easier!

I use Graham's methodology for discounting all assets and counting all
liabilities at 100%, so I feel comfortable in also referring to the number so
derived a "NetNet" number according to Graham.

I believe pension obligations would not be considered "off balance sheet", but
perhaps I misinterpreted what you were saying.

I agree that the footnotes are as vital to the analysis as the Income, Balance
Sheet and Cash Flow statements that they refer to.

Interesting day!

Do you know of any companies that currently meet all 7 of these criteria?

No, not yet. I have found companies that have met the requirement of trading
below book value, but those companies appear to have all sorts of problems
associated with them.

Goodwill, on the other hand, seems to me to be rarely worth anything, let alone
50%, so I am quite harsh in my markdowns of that line item.

Interesting that you should mention the "Goodwill" word. Today, I just finished
reading "The Intelligent Investor"

On Page 213 of "The Intelligent Investor", graham admits that companie with, at
that time, a substantial amount of goodwill on their books did quite well.
Interesting, huh?

Since I am a starting to learn the "Graham Philosophy", I would be interested

Dave:

I would be interested in knowing your "critera". 

I'm not sure that I'm clear enough to list all of the criteria that I use. It
has become almost intuitive at this point. I think Graham and Philip A Fisher
do a much better job of it, but since you ask....

I have a wide variety of places that the symbols come from. This board, Motley
Fool, stock screeners, the paper, friends, etc.

I use Yahoo Profile as a preliminary quick look.

1). Are they profitable? Even under GAAP I like a positive number for starters.
2). Are they selling close to book value?
3). What is the ROA? I like to see double digits.
4). What is the Current Ratio? Minimum of 2.0
5). What is the Debt Ratio? I like <.4 generally but the maximum can vary
depending on ROA and, later, ROIC.
6). In the business narrative area Yahoo outlines the latest gross revenue and
net profit, under it they list the earnings of the top four or five officers
for the previous year. I like the net profit to be at least 4 times the total
income listed for the officers.
7). Do they pay a dividend? I like it to be at or above money market rates.
8). How many shares outstanding? I like smaller numbers in the millions.
9). Does the described business make sense?
10). How much cash do they have on hand? I don't like to see them needing to
borrow to pay the dividend.
11). What is the average trading volume? If I'm going to buy an illiquid
company, I want to know it going in.

There's probably more, but that's primarily what I look at on the first "sniff"
test.

The MAXF insurance payments have confused everyone since 9/11; I had the debate
too many times to repeat it again.

Fortunately we have a "clean" quarter coming now where you can see how the
actual business operates. Annualized EPS from the expected .25 quarter gives a
current forward PE around 5, plus the mid-$4's tangible book value.

Monday July 15, 4:04 pm Eastern Time
Press Release
SOURCE: Maxcor Financial Group Inc.
Maxcor Financial Group Inc. Anticipates 2002 Second Quarter Net Income of
Approximately $2.1 Million, or $.25 Per Share
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 15, 2002--Maxcor Financial Group Inc. (Nasdaq:
MAXF - News) today announced that it expects to achieve after-tax net income of
approximately $2.1 million, or $.25 per share, for its second quarter ended
June 30, 2002.

The quarter will be Maxcor's seventh consecutive quarter of profitability.

Maxcor emphasized that substantially all of the anticipated 2002 second quarter
results will represent operating profits. The net income effect of
non-recurring items is expected to be less than $50,000.

On a world-wide basis, Maxcor said that its 2Q 2002 revenues are expected to be
approximately $38.5 million, an improvement from 1Q 2002 revenues of $37.5
million, but down from 2Q 2001 revenues of $40.5 million. The comparison period
in 2001 was a record one for Maxcor, with operating income of $2.15 million and
total net income of $2.72 million.

Maxcor's New York-based brokerage operations, which had to be rebuilt entirely
after September 11th, are preliminarily calculated to have accounted for $23.8
million of the 2Q 2002 revenues, up from their contribution of $22.4 million to
1Q 2002 revenues and of $23.4 million to 2Q 2001 revenues.

Maxcor expects to provide its complete earnings report for the quarter ended
June 30, 2002 in early August.

Maxcor Financial Group Inc. (www.maxf.com), through its various Euro Brokers
entities, is a leading domestic and international inter-dealer brokerage firm
specializing in interest rate and other derivatives, emerging market debt
products, cash deposits and other money market instruments, U.S. Treasury and

for releasing reports without approval. Inch started TYC at neutral but
recently upgraded to buy.
My view on analyst research is to read for facts, insights and
perspective...and not to blindly follow rec's. A good research report can tip
you off to issues and considerations it would take quite awhile to dig out on
your own. Often reports contain data from user/vendor surveys that would be too
costly to do or buy. OTOH, the investor must be aware that IB relationships or
other incentives could distort the views of the analyst and thus to expect a
somewhat bullish bias..especially where IB relationships exist.

Good list, Timba. I tend to look at some of the following:
1. Insider activity
2. Short interest - high levels can mean fundamental shorts, doing thorough
research, have uncovered some stinky stuff.
3. EV/EBITDA, EV/EBITDA-CAPEX, EV/FCF The EV adjusts for debt & cash levels
which price multiples do not...thus producing lower multiples for debt ridden
companies.
4. Competition & competitive position. Hoovers or quicken compare can be good
sources for competitor info as is 10-k.
5. Receivable & inventory vs sales compared to PY QTR.
6. Spreads...trading liquidity...avoid excessive spreads.
7. Message boards...sometimes there are well informed posters that can and will
point out key issues As an example, here's a response I got today on an inquiry

I agree with what your saying. and I guess what im getting at was that when the
whole breakup was first mentioned the range of all analyst that I heard was a
high of 90 down to like the mid 50's. no where did I hear 20. I guess if the
stock starts going up they may all change back to a breakup of 50 again. Its
seems likely that the company will NOT breakup at this time (I actually think
this is the right approach anyway). I have also found breakup value for
companies not likely to break up have not really been indicative of stock
direction ie paper companies. If they really do break up the company it is
likely to be done under pressure like CIT and we will find out the break up
values is much less then anticipated.

I do own the stock and am disappointed with the current situation, but it is
likely that the prosects of this company will be determined by growth in
earnings. Im not sure how the breakup story helps in making a decision. Do you
think the underlying fundamentals are intact or will the pall over the company
ultimaley effect earnings?

I trimmed my small position in FBP today and cut back more of my long-term and
disappointing FSS. I've added to EP and will try again with ABN by restarting a
small amount.

S&P says to avoid EP based on changes in business strategy and negative
investor sentiment regarding its industry. There are balance sheet and dilution
issues. Still, EP, among other things, is North America's largest pipeline
company and the fifth largest natural gas producer. (As has been alluded to
here before in EP discussion, natural gas is expected to be a fast growing part
of the "energy complex".) Imo- or at least for me, the stock is impossible to
analyze given its complex businesses and accounting. I'll go with the stock
being under stated book value, near multi-year lows, and possessing over a 5%
dividend yield. (And that dividend, according to S&P table, has been raised
many times.) I'll hope the dividend continues and that I can hold the stock for
an eventual price improvement.

Somewhat similar with ABN. I can't figure the financials, but the size and
breadth of the company provide some assurance that it might survive business
setbacks. A lumbering giant, selling at lows in a channel very roughly between
15-25, there's a 5%+ dividend while awaiting a possible upmove in the stock.

As far as the "inflated valuation of assets" issues raised with these companies

annouce profits, they are required to pay them out.

ALD is expected to announce dividends in a week or so. A lot more insider

greater than 1 and their book value about 23.86.

CUM does appear to be an interesting value stock. What percentage of their
sales are tied to those Dodge Trucks? Is Dodge offering 0 percent financing?

Jurgis Bekepuris: I have some of those stocks. Uh... at higher prices.

I looked at COF yesterday on the sector's crash. Passed on it in favor of PVN.
And I did buy a little to add to my position.

I gave up on CDT and closed my position several months ago. Decided I would
rather be in TLAB which seems to me to be stronger and will also, I presume,
come back if the network business ever does. (I have an exploratory position in
TLAB.)

I've seen CHKP recommended several times recently. I'll look at it a little
closer now.

Paul,

I was looking at their Balance Sheet and their adjusted book value is around
16-17 per share.

Yes, their D/E ratio is a little over 1 and rising. That, of course, is not
good news but it appears it is a stock to watch.

I have much more faith in individual company fundamentals than how they trade
as stocks for the time being. The market has temporarily suspended most links
between business performance and share prices.

But the link always returns eventually.

re: "The market has temporarily suspended most links between business
performance and share prices." Maybe so. Maybe not.

The metric I'd use as a link is price (share price) to earnings (business
performance). What seems to be happening is a general lowering of p/e 's across
the board. Certainly I see this with high p/e stocks such as pharmaceuticals,
all of which (that I'm aware of) have had their p/e's cut. While it might be
argued that this is just one sector decline, I'm not aware of any sector that
hasn't had a p/e contraction -- chemicals, industrials, tech... even REITs to
some extent have been affected.

People just don't seem as willing to pay as much for earnings, or maybe it's
earnings growth. What's bothering me is that I could see stock prices coming
down in sectors with lowered earnings (p/e's rising), but I just did not expect
that p/e's overall would be dropping when interest rates are low. I remember
those low under 10 p/e's on Coke, Intel, etc. decades ago, but that was when
bond yields were much, much higher than now and provided an alternative to
stocks. I recently read though where somebody did a study and found that p/e's
can be independent of interest or bond rates. Which might mean that a return to
the low p/e's of decades ago is a possibility in today's low interest rate
environment. That's what seems to be happening, and I'm not liking it.

I was thinking more in terms of my own portfolio of value small caps. I did a
chart early in July with their trailing PE's and 2002 estimates (these are real
estimates for financial and retail stocks, not software company "hope we close
ten deals on June 30" types) and found them pretty low already.

Then most of those stocks sold off 10-30% this month.

To me, that indicates panic selling by the little guys and fund selling to meet
redemptions. Quality is thrown out along with the junk if the price is going
down, fundamentals be damned.

If I am right, these stocks will have a modest rebound once selling exhaustion
is reached. If you are right, I have a long wait ahead for any substantial
gains.

They are now saying, "Alliant Energy affirmed its commitment to the current
$2.00 per share annual dividend. The company has paid a dividend for 226
consecutive quarters. "We remain committed to the dividend policy we have set
in place and have no current plans to change that policy," stated Davis. "We
continue to generate strong cash flows that will provide the financial
flexibility to pay our current dividend in spite of the 2002 earnings
challenges."

That is of course the major risk. However, Jobs has been sitting on that stash

I'll take profits and close small positions in RLI and CIX. Also trim (at loss)
tiny position of EMN. Take my lumps on RX (not a value stock) and close the

Opening a small position in HI. Very good ROE, relatively low p/e, recent
history of very good earnings increases, 10 years of dividend increases., 11 of
23 analysts rate it a strong buy (Is this a positive or negative? -g-) Many

Purchased CVS today at 24.84.

FWIW, a consulting group I have dealings with is of the opinion that we are
nearing a bottom....lots of emotional/panic selling by retail investors,
causing massive mutual fund redemptions in June/July. That is just one opinion,
of course we are nearer the bottom.

IMO, this is probably close to the way it is. A lot of the weak hands, and
margin calls, have been purged. But, I've been wrong (a lot), and am probably
too much of an optimist.

Yes. I've suspected Dale Baker's short of JPM would be a real success as JPM
and C have become embroiled in the Enron issues. (Lawyers suing the deep
pockets.) I trimmed back my JPM position to a very small amount. With no
further bad news forthcoming, I figured it was okay to start back with C. Looks
like I was wrong - now it comes out that C may be involved in a conspiracy, or
perhaps illegal activities or just more shady or greed-induced deals. The
company will eventually work through this, and the stock will recover. It may
take years though.
