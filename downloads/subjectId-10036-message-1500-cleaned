Ron: Thanks for info on NATS - seems to fit into their overall plans. BTW, I
get the "Investors Hotline" cassette newletter-like service and when I heard
their latest tape this morning I thought about you right away.

One of their value investing type interviewees recommended GeneTech (GNE around
58-59), that he evaluates "performing strongly as a growing pharmaceutical
company". But the real story here is that Roche has an option to purchase the
rest of the company that it doesn't own at a price that is currently at 72.5
and escalates quarterly to a maximum of 82.5 in two years. In addition, Roche
also guarantees to purchase the shares at 60 on 6/30/99 (again, 2 years). There
doesn't appear to be any downside at all (except opportunity loss and maybe
commissions) - if the market tanks, you are guaranteed to be able to get your
money back.

I haven't had a chance to look at beyond the above, but might be worth looking
into just based on the Roche takeout possibilities/guarantees.

Good Investing,

. THE NAPEAGUE LETTER
Sunday, July 6, 1997

Editor: Bob Davis http://www.napeague.com

Kaneb Services, Inc. - (NYSE:KAB)

For the last several quarters, Kaneb Services (NYSE:KAB) has produced
an impressive series of positive earnings surprises:

- In the fourth quarter of 1996, analysts were expecting $.04 per
share - Kaneb Services delivered $.06.

- In the first quarter of 1997, Analysts were looking for $.03 per
share - Kaneb Services delivered $.04.

In fact, Kaneb Services's earnings have been rising steadily for the
last several years, as shown by this chart.

1996 1995 1994 1993
----- ----- ----- -----
Earnings per Share $0.19 $0.10 $0.02 $(0.01)

And there are solid reasons to expect that this growth will continue
well into the future.

But before I outline these reasons, I would like to explain that this
New York Stock Exchange listed Company occupies two important and
inter-related niches in an industry whose importance can only grow in
the coming years.

- Its Furmanite business unit provides diagnosis and on-line
repairs of leaks in valves, pipes and other components of piping
systems and related equipment.

- Kaneb Pipe Line operates over 2,000 miles of petroleum pipe lines
and specialty liquids terminals which make up the third largest
independent operation in the US.

Both of these operations are expanding rapidly, through internal
growth and acquisitions.

- Furmanite has just announced its acquisition of its licensee who
services the "expanding markets" of Australia and New Zealand,
and in December 1996, it announced a joint venture which has
added to its already-impressive technology base.

- Kaneb Pipe Line has recently added additional terminal facilities
which are synergistic with its current operations.

Kaneb is structured in such a way that the holders of Kaneb Services
common stock will receive substantially greater benefits from this
growth.

- The pipelines and terminals are very capital-intensive, and
normally this need for capital would put a brake on potential
growth.

- However, the pipelines and and terminals are owned by Kaneb
Pipeline Partners, which is also traded on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbols KPP and KPU. Shareholders in the
Partnership receive a largely "fixed" dividend, while
shareholders in KAB receive the benefits of growth - in the form
of accelerated earnings per share.

This is generally referred to as "leverage", and this leverage is
working effectively for KAB shareholders.

The Napeague Letter projects that Kaneb Services will earn $.27 per
share in 1997 - a 42% increase over 1996. An analysis of the Company's
balance sheet shows that it is strong enough to support this growth.

Likewise, The Napeague Letter has analyzed the Company using a variety
of fundamental valuation tools, and believes that KAB can support a
market price of at least $6.00 per share based on trailing earnings,
and can justify a much higher market value based on both its projected
future earnings and on its ability to generate cashflow.

Technical analysis indicates that KAB may be primed for another move
upward in the next few weeks. the stock has steadily appreciated since
early 1995, but this growth has come in spurts. there are strong
indications that such a spurt may begin shortly.

This is a Summary of a complete Analysis of Kaneb Services which can
be found at The Napeague Web Site at

http://www.napeague.com

I encourage you to read the entire Analysis as well as the Company's
investor relations information and its reports to the Securities &
Exchange Commission prior to making any decision to invest in this or
any other Company.

NOTICE
This analysis is based on publicly-available information, and is in no

From:judge

FYI, Info on NCR. this was taken from the prelimary evaluation of NCR by morgan
stanley.
o OPERATING LEVERAGE IS SIGNIFICANT. NCR appears to have succeeded in the
fastest turnaround in industry history, but there is further to go. The way to
achieve management's goal of an upper-single operating margin is by gross
margin expansion since expense ratios are competitive. The current gross margin
of 27% through nine months should rise into the low- and possibly mid-30s
through a combination of product mix shift and process improvements. We believe
NCR has earnings power of $4.00-5.00 by the turn of the century.

o THE BALANCE SHEET IS CLEAN. AT&T spun off NCR with a great balance sheet that
should give customers confidence. At year end, cash could be $900 million, debt
just $90 million, and equity $1.2 billion. Inventory turns and receivable days
are decent and are likely to
improve. The company should be a modest cash generator.

Risks

o DATA WAREHOUSE COMPETITION IS INCREASING. Both server hardware and database
software rivals are rushing into data warehousing given the high growth rate
and attractive margins. The two concerns we have are (1) users opt for
databases perceived as open, such as Oracle ($48) and Informix ($25), and (2)
Teradata loses share in the medium and
lower end at 100-700 gigabytes, where symmetric multiprocessors and NUMA
systems are alternatives. NCR is deflecting these threats by making the
Teradata system more open and scaling it downward.

o SALES FORCE PRODUCTIVITY IS POOR. NCR's revenue per employee of $175,000 is
below that of competitors. Part of the explanation is the significant portion
of revenue from services at 37%. In addition, we think sales productivity is
low at about $2 million per sales person. With modest indirect distribution,
the company relies on its direct channel. Previously high turnover and poor
processes may be to blame and will take time to fix.

o NCR MUST ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS TO SUSTAIN GROWTH. NCR's slash-and
burn period is over with costs under control. That means the emphasis is on
profitable growth. The first priority is to gain share of spending in the
installed base. Eventually, NCR must increase its mind and market share outside
its base. Our surveys find low recognition outside the base, with the company's
data warehouse capabilities underappreciated. Management must make good on its
goal of making NCR a "thought leader."

VALUATION

Our analysis suggests NCR is reasonably valued given our current estimates.
Relative to its computer comparables, NCR is somewhat cheap on enterprise
value-to-revenue, fairly valued on enterprise value-to-EBITDA and on a multiple
of earnings, and expensive on price-to-book. A reasonable price range is $30-40
per share, we think. Valuing NCR's stock is not simple given a mix of
businesses and low near-term earnings. We believe the closest comparables are
computer
vendors undergoing turnaround situations, such as Digital ($40), Data General
($16), Unisys ($7), Amdahl ($12), and Tandem ($14) as well as IBM ($156). We
expect the stock to be covered primarily by computer analysts. We show the
valuations of Imation ($33) as an example of a
spinoff and of Diebold ($55) as the primary ATM competitor.

Enterprise value-to-revenue is a useful measure given subpar profitability in
1996-97. At $36 per share, NCR is trading at a ratio of 0.49 on estimated 1996
revenue and the likely year-end balance
sheet, similar to Data General (0.44) and above DEC (0.35). Unisys (0.66),
Tandem (0.92) and Amdahl (0.82) are higher and indicate where NCR's valuation
could go as profit margins improve and investor confidence increases. The
first-tier vendors such as IBM sell at one times or higher.

Price/earnings is more meaningful on estimated 1998 results. By 1998 NCR should
be closer to normalized earnings; in our calculation we use a 35% tax rate for
comparability, though NCR's actual rate should be about 50%. Comparables are
varied, but a multiple of 11-13 times 1998E net income appears reasonable. At
$36 per share, NCR is at the high end of the range.

Hi Jeff,

Took a long look at CBI, and am impressed by their international
aspect -- maybe a good way to take advantage of the building
of infrastructure in Asia, India, and other developing areas.

But I am disturbed on most other counts, and as I am not smart
enough to do 100% top down investing, I'm inclined to
leave this one be.

On most standard value ratios, it is at or above the industry
average -- even if one doesn't include the PE, which granted is
misleading. Yet its ROE and ROA are much less than the industry
average. Further, the company is experiencing falling margins
due to product mix changes -- not a transient thing.

Maybe you can help me see the margin of safety here, cuz I
don't get it.

What do you think of HP's news that it is taking on SGI with
machines orders of magnitude faster?

Hi Mike - Re: CBI - The Barrons article has the skinny on CBI. Since they were
just spun off of Praxair, I'm not sure how you did a year over year comparison
unless you used the numbers in the Prospectus. Shafer notes in the Barrons
article that they were writing business at break even. The PE is definitely
misleading because 1) they don't have much history on their own and 2) earnings
are negative. As for ROE and ROA, what industry did you look at for comparison?
I think these guys are a specialty company whose primary competitor is Flour
which is diversified so I'm not sure what a fair comparison really is. Also,
the low margins on this kind of play are actually good. The goal is to improve
margins significantly through international business and they are demonstrating
that this can be done. So in this type of situation, low margins are good and
it's reflected in the PSR.

I'm still not convinced myself I want to play this one but I will be looking
over more material this weekend.

I didn't see the article but in the past, this has been a lot of media hype.
Until they've sold a few and posted standard benchmarks, I'm a doubter. I think
this is a good sign for SGI since at least somebody now sees SGI as a
competitor. This hasn't happened in the past year.

I have followed SGI for a few months. I regretted I didn't buy it
when it hit $13. Then it jumped back to ~$19 and now back to $16.

The SGI book value is $9.51. The price/book looks good. However,
the P/E looks pretty high. And the high P/E ratio was one of the
reasons that I didn't buy it earlier.

I will continue to keep my eye on SGI.

From:Jeff Maresh

dd - I have no target for SGI simply because the market is irrational. The
price was irrationally low at $13 and will probably be irrationally high at
some point. The issue is that they've missed the ACE for about the last 6
quarters and have lost a lot of credibility with the street. During this
period, they bought and digested Cray, promoted from within a new CEO,
reorganized the corporate hierarchy to be more efficient, and completely
redeveloped their entire product line. This was no small feat but it has put
them on top of both SUNW and HWP in terms of technology and price. During all
of this, they never lost money except for writeoffs for the Cray acquisition.

In the last quarter conf call, they stated that about 80% of everything shipped
this quarter would be new products. Last quarter will be the first where all of
the new products are in volume production. Earnings announcement is scheduled
for 7/24 after the market closes.

The current quarter **should** confirm the turnaround but I think they won't
regain their former "Wall St. Darling" status until there are at least one and
perhaps two more quarters of improvement. Margins will probably still be low
this quarter but thats normal for a company introducing a completely new
hardware line. The expected life of the product line is about 4 years. If you
have further interest, check post #867 on this thread.

Lisa: re turnarounds. I sorta like Peter Lynch's approach for turnarounds (in
Beating the Street, in The Two Minute Drill, p173):
"If it's a turnaround, then has the company gone about improving its fortunes,
and is the plan working so far?"

He gives some examples like they have divested non-core operations, new
products are selling well, buying back millions of shares, earnings are up
sharply.

Note the past tense. IMO, you don't get all of the upside, but limit downside
and mimimize risk of buying too early.

My opinion only.

I found it hard to leave TA completely behind. Mainly I use
it only to avoid falling knives and to find buy points at
very solid support. I try not to use it to sell stocks
because my horizon remains long-term. With the
market this toppy though, I find it hard to ignore when
TA says sell after a fast rise. It's the old take the money
and run. It has helped me tremendously, and I have been
hurt when I ignore it completely. The four companies I hold

I'm amazed you picked up on the SNIFF mention here. It certainly wasn't
something to jump in on at that time! (Or now!) They had their credit line
revoked by the bank and are now under bankruptcy protection in Canada. They
also announced a corporate restructuring. If the company comes through the
creditor protection process OK they might be a good buy right now. For some
reason the ticker symbol had to be changed to SNIFQ due to these woes...the co.
is still trading normally on the Toronto Stock Exchange as ASZ.

Someone on the SNIFF thread said a friend analyzes these situations for a
living and the company could be a goner. It bounces between 25 cents and 37
cents these days. Would have been a value play based on the assets and decent
sales but now the creditors may gobble up everything. Hmm, pretty bad
management you'd have to say. Bank calls the loan and it's all over. In these
markets they could have had a stock offering last year to raise $20 mil and no
one would have batted an eye.

I think there is a subplot here. Something about an ad agency or distributor
who failed them and they don't want to pay...as I recall...there are lawsuits
back and forth...more than meets the eye as usual.

Ivy,

You're asking me? For what it's worth I took a quick look.

Were you giving me a dig with AMP because of my Insider mistake? If you weren't
and meant AMP, take profits and run. The run up makes no sense to me.

I'm pretty sure you meant APM. If I had it, I'd hold. If I had free margin, I'd
buy, if I had cash, I'd go for the July $25.00 Options at $1.25.

So they lowered projections - to PE of 6.78 for '97 and 5.6 for '98 based on a
$26.25 price. Anytime!!

There's 58% institutional holdings. Huge earnings growth over last few quarters
in spite of the ReadRite expenses. A little debt, but nothing excessive.
where's the downside and why is this stock selling so low? This makes less
sense than the AMP run up.

You say earnings to come out next week - I will be looking further for a
downside with plans to put in an option order before market opens. So far I've
only 20 minute quick look at SEC, news, profile, research, and some other
stuff. Will run thru thread and other resources and make a posting before
Monday open if I find something. Right now, I'm thinking about putting in an
order for July or August options.

Ivy,

Total revision of earlier post. The company is fine, but the market is not. All
of the interest is short term, those looking for profits from a price increase.
The long term money isn't in play and it takes the 'funds' for a real price
increase.

If I were to buy in, I'd be out before the earnings report came out. I feel the
price might rise until then and who knows what will happen after the report.
It's a risk because profit taking may start before earnings report comes out.
Not a gamble I take.

If I were already long, I would likely pick a price that gave me a decent
profit and sell my shares short. If it continues up, I sell my shares and cover
the short. If it goes down, I cover short with my stock that I've sold at the
higher price.

I don't like it for short term or long with the play that's on it now. This is
why I got out of techs.

For what it's worth and that's not much.

Ivy,

I would ignore most of what I've posted on APM. This is a market driven stock
with a lot of action, the kind of stock I avoid. I look for companies that the
market isn't driving, that they haven't found yet. It is only these companies
that seem to sell on value.

APM financials are good and it appears to be a good investment. I have doubts
about the long term because I have doubts about hard drives. I feel flash cards
will be replacing in the near future as their capacity increases and prices
lower. If you are already long, you've likely gotten in at a good time. I think
you should consider profit taking, but I might be wrong.

For what it's worth.

When I first posted here recommending APM, it was July 9, please
look at post #1509. It was trading ~ 23 and it was not a momentem
stock. The daily volumn was less than 1 million.

Within a week, mostly because APM earnings beat the estimated
and the current high-tech rally, it went to ~ 31, a jump of more
than 35% in a week.

It attract a lot of momemtum now. Actually, I am pretty happy
that it finally gets the street attention because I accumulated a lot of calls
when it was between 23 to 27. However, with its low P/E, still less than 10. It
is still a good and safe play.

What are the value stocks are you holding or planning to hold?

Ivy,

I envy the run-up you are getting out of APM. Had I looked hard at it two weeks
ago I might be doing the same. With all the shorts out there it could be a long
ride up. Oh well!

I pretty well ignore stocks recommended by brokerages, newsletters, and other
sources. I'm trying to find before they do. It gets harder and harder and I now
put more into the good stocks I do find versus some of this and some of that.

My most recent and major position is now ELAMF. Other than this, I just bought
a very boring BOTX with nice PE and under book value.

Play money - I sometimes take some long shots like gambling that NATS can
resolve a lawsuit.
Am having some fun by buying ELSE. If you like to read balance sheets, look at
theirs. I've never seen a company try so hard to hide info. They come across as
a small marketing company, but they have a division that's heavy in market
investments. On March 30, they had 86 cents/share of unrealized gain. Not bad
for a $4 stock. The market was in correction on Mar 30, Betting on some major
profits and gains for 6-30 that they can't hide.

Long terms - My biggest holdings are METH, OAS, and SWST. All bought well below
current value and are definite holds.

Recent sells are SNDK, DSWLF, NTAIF. Tracking all three to buy back in because
they have great long term prospects. IMO - SNDK is overbought again.

Other than this, I'm doing the same thing it appears you are doing, trying to
find some value in this crazy market. Spend 2-3 hours a day searching and
rejecting. Now reviewing REITs because they are about only thing left that's
under valued.

And I know you are having a nice day - go APM.

Some stocks and some talk:

Been building my new computer. Argggh. Seems like every year I go through
this...for me it's a Hell week or two. It's what happens when you don't know
what you are doing... and won't pay for advice or to get the job done right...
What a jerk :-). Save money on computer... forgo maybe large profits by being
out of touch with the market also maybe.

Responding to comments directed my way some time ago:

The person who had no more than a couple of years experience in the market and
who used margin and who had less than 6 stocks and who said he knew that
experts said don't do this (but was doing it anyway), and who then asked
something about did people think he was overextended... the answer is YES the
man is overextended. However, we are in a bull market and if the goal is to
make the most money, the ones taking the most chances in this market make the
most. Furthermore, I own some of the very same stocks. ELAMF for example,
mentioned by me in posts here in in '96, at about 9; now at 10. Finding that I
own the same stocks is VERY disconcerting to me. Sheesh, we must both be
jerks-of-a-feather. Being gone for a couple of weeks, I have thought some about
this. Neither of us apparently listens to or values experts. And in my case, I
believe in addition, I am not listening carefully enough to the messages
(posts) being delivered here. Lots of good suggestions which maybe I am
dismissing too fast. My thanks for the posts on APM- I did get that message and
buy some about 2 weeks ago.
Regarding DRKN: I am still working on getting the requested list of
competitors. It's a fragmented market apparently. Some competitors include:
Deflecta Shield (TRUX), Glas-aire (GLAR) and Lund Intl (LUND), also GM. I've
added to my position at 9+.

Other additions: Reynolds and Reynolds (REY). Recommended by mutual fund "value
investor" mgr in last week's Sun NY Times. Yahoo has recent history- Motley
Fool commentary is actually relevant. I like co. for cash flow, rising div,
possible combo of value and growth. Should work out okay for value investors
with long term time frame. -Are there any other kind of value investors? :>)
Missed IGT. If it drops back to 16 range, I will add slightly to my very small
position. (A strong co. in an unpopular sector - maybe the bet is that the
sector gains favor before the company runs out of steam). Been selling SUN
Micro on scale up from 34. Seems like an obvious mistake at this point (SUNW @
47) (Shoulda been buying not selling.) Hard for me to tell where fair value is
on some of these tech stocks.
Gotta go... the @??#$ computer is still not right. grrrr.

Ivy,

I don't recommend. I listed some of the things I'm in.

The only stock I would even begin to recommendbuying is ELAMF. It is a long
term growth stock moving fairly conservative to market. They showed lower
earnings due to 1) a stock issue to pay off bank loans that added dilution and
2) had ongoing contracts when the Mexican Minimum Wage Law was raised that
lowered margins temporarily. They are expanding, gaining new customers in
addition to new business with prio customers. One of the big things that sold
me on the company is the amount of repeat business they get and their
diversity. Next earnings should show recovery of margins and the order
visibility should provide increased revs and earnings thru end of year. They
look solid and are currently priced right.

This is one of 4 large holdings I have for long term, the most recent, and the
only one currently at a good buy-in price. (My others are METH, OAS, & SWST)
Any others I've listed are small buys that I feel have potential for good
gains.

How about something you are strong on?

A near net net that warrants a look:

Chris-Craft Industries (CCN) has a market
cap of $1.58B, cash equivalents of $1.54B,
and no debt. It also owns a 76% stake in
BHC Communications, which owns eight metro
TV stations. Forbes values this stake at
$2.20B, though it is carried on the books
much lower. Even so, P/B is 0.88 compared
to the industry-average >4. Net Net value

stock and recently the stock broke out
of a years long sideways channel to the
upside. Management is Herbert Siegel,

Paul,

I've missed your input. We're more alike than owning some of the same stocks.
Just finished going thru the same !@#$%^^&& of upgrading to 686-200. First
motherboard was bad, battle with tech support, what should have taken an hour
took over two weeks. I should have learned from past problems. My sympathies.

After I made the posting about 'making a mistake' (everyone knows it was me) I
realized that I had done very well in the last 14 months (it hasn't been 2
years) having almost tripled my original buy-in. I did it using margin so why
would I stop? The worst thing that could happen to me would be a lower return,
likely far more than I ever expected when I started. It helps that only a small
portion of my investments are in the stock market.

Am I good at this? No!!! I read and write down every stock that's mentioned on
these postings then buy what I feel is good. I missed APM, not because it
wasn't good, but because I would have had to sell something to buy it and I
didn't feel that strongly about it. Then I make a fool of myself trying to act
like I know something.

Please get that thing fixed and get back on the threads! Gotta go, REY needs to
be looked at along with a couple of others I've picked up.

The "worsening cash flow" comes from the spin-off of the tobacco unit. What you
see is cash flow from non-tobacco operations. Check the SEC filings for
pro-forma information. Further, net debt is low in comparison to cash flow. I
own the spin-off (Gallaher Group PLC - NYSE:GLH) rather than Fortune, but
that's not because Fortune is not a very good company.

The valuation is even better than you said, Mike, although you've got the idea.
You don't need Forbes to tell you the value of BHC. BHC trades on the market,
so its very easy to back that value out of Chris Craft. And what you find is
that everything else, including the stake in the UPN network and a good deal of
cash, is free. Gabelli loves this one. Incidently, he also likes BHC as an

Kaneb Services (NYSE:KAB) Earnings Announcement

Exciting announcements from Kaneb Services over the last few days....

- Today KAB announced second quarter results which once again
exceeded "street expectations". Per share earnings reached $.08, a 60%
increase over the $.05 in the prior year quarter and well ahead of the $.07
that analysts were expecting. Revenues for the quarter also rose, to $58.4
million from $57.2 million in the prior year quarter. The press release
can be found at
http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/97/07/23/kab_kpp_y_1.html .

- On Monday, Kaneb Pipeline Partners announced that "its independent
terminaling group has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the
Chicago area terminal assets of Stolthaven Chicago, Inc. The terminal to
be acquired is the only deep water facility in Chicago with 90 tanks and a
total capacity of 794,000 barrels." The Company expects to close this
transaction in September, so its first impact should be felt on 4th quarter
results. The press release can be found at
http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/97/07/21/kpp_kpu_y_1.html .

To quote the press release itself, "Our operating results continue to be in
line with our expectations in all areas of the Company. We had a very
strong quarter in our industrial field services unit. Improvements in
terminaling operations, which have been very strong all year, offset a soft
quarter of pipeline operations. Also during this quarter, we bought in
443,400 shares of our common stock bringing the total number of shares
purchased since October of last year to 1,191,200 shares."

I am anticipating obtaining additional information over the next few days,
and I will e-mail it to subscribers and place it on the Napeague Web Site at
http://www.napeague.com . I will also update the KAB in-depth Analysis
when I receive the 10-Q Report for the Quarter.

Kevin,

Excellent return on NTAIF. I had thought as much as .60, never expected this
kind of single Q growth. I'm sure the Officers and Directors knew they were
having a great Q and am wondering why they have been selling stock.

I bought NTAIF at 13 and took profits to almost 3x as many shares of ELAMF
@8.50. Now I need for it to go to $12 to equal the gain I would have made on
NTAIF. I'm confident it will reach at least 15. It looks like most all of the
companies in the ECM sector are doing well.

You definitely found it at the right time with this earnings report.

Paul,

Re: CCN

During 1997, an heretofore unseen flurry of S-4's ("insider
sale" forms) were filed.

Going back several years, this hadn't happened before. In
fact, we generally only got the form s13G/A's signifying another
major holder still holding.

Further investigation reveals these individuals were all
either Directors (7) or Board members (2). This all happened
during the long period the shares sat in the 40-42 range.
The executions ranged from 39.84 to 41.52. Recently the shares
have broken through the 45ish resistance and are at about 50.
Bad timing. The CEO, who holds a huge chunk, and his other
senior executives haven't sold a share.

In sum, this news is equivocable, so I need a tie-breaker.
Hence I look at the balance sheet, the assets, the business,
and the quality of the large shareholders. This all tilts
me in the solid "Buy" area.

In general, I don't pay attention to insider sales as
much as buys. Of course, when I see the CEO, the COO,
the Pres, and 5 VP's all selling 30 kabillion dollars worth
that's one thing. But two officers/board members here
and there, even in a clump, doesn't worry me.

Hi Paul - Thanks for the kudos! It's still not too late for SGI. Depending on
what I hear on the conference call which I will listen to this weekend, I may
buy more.

SGI is STILL a very depressed tech stock although it's outside of the
parameters of the classic Fisher Super Stock because of price. By all
indications, they have done everything right to ensure a long-term competitive
advantage in both price and performance. They are shattering significant
performance records with modestly equipped database servers (O2000) on almost a
weekly basis and there is a lot more to come.

In addition, no other competitor (Sun, HP, Dec) has scalable machines like the
SGI Origins. For example, you spend $250K for a Sun or HP server and you can
add components over several years to increase performance by a practical
maximum of 8 over a couple of years and now have a $2M box. You can buy an
Origin for as little as $60K and increase performance by about a factor of 250
(yes 250!) over several years. Internet commerce is growing at several hundred
percent per year and this is the most practical system to use for these
applications. This is a significant technological break through that IMO they
can maintain their advantage for at least several years. This is part of the
technology they got from Cray.

There will be some that say "one data point doesn't make a trend" and this
attitude can keep the stock below it's true value for awhile yet. They have
embarrased a lot of folks on the street for many quarters now. What they
FINALLY did this time is take their cue from Microsoft and guide estimates so
low that they can't do anything but beat them.

The big unknown at this point is how they are going to handle marketing. I
haven't seen a lot of ads in the trade rags along side Sun and HP but they are
selling a lot of O2000 systems to big customers. They've definitely cracked
this market but it remains to be seen how they market the goods long term.
They've hired a new ad agency and are supposed to be starting a major new
campaign for servers in the next month. I am optimistic since the systems are
selling well with little visible advertising. What's going to happen when the
ad campaign starts?

Ron,

I like ELAMF, the P/E looks good. Most of the stocks you have are
small cap stocks. Since I usually buy calls, I prefer mid cap or large stocks.
I just feel safer with larger cap stock options.

I currently betting my life on APM, it represents more than 50% of my
portfolio. Lately I sold most of my calls in AMAT and put the money on
APM. However, AMAT is still going like crazy.

I also have ATML. I entered a small position when it was $40. Then, it dropped
all the way to 20's. I bought a lot calls when it was 20's. When it ran to ~
$35 two weeks ago. I sold a lot of the ATML calls and bought more APM.

Since I like technical weak well-known large cap stocks, I also bought
some COMS calls when it was 30's. I regretted I didn't buy more when it was
20's. I also have some INTC and IOM calls, and tiny position in ESST and GES. I
paid too much for ESST and GES calls. I am losing money on both of them.

I have followed SGI for the last few months but didn't buy it. I missed the
run.

APM is trying to consolidate at $30. I hope it will not go back to $23. I have
a lot of Oct calls. With 1997 estimated earning of ~$4,
it is still trading at a very low P/E of less than 8.

Happy investing!!!

As a value investment it leaves a lot to be desired. They are changing so fast
it is impossible to evaluate. By the time a 10Q is filed, they have made
numerous deals and acquisitions that completely changes dilution, revs, and

Good bye STJ, hello BNO:

Purchased small amt. of Benton Oil @15.375.
PSR low relative to past years.
P/E okay at 11+. Increasing revenue stream (barrels of oil) from Venezuela
fields. Possible kicker if it can get oil with/from "long-time" Russian
partners. Stock near its low for year.
Been kinda looking for an oil stock - this is the one I've chosen. Undoubtedly
lots of risk...but the potential is there too. There's a BNO thread... not too
much enthusiasm -- apparently it's just another dull stock...

Say... if you could believe that dog owners look like their dogs, I hope you
are not the type of people who also could believe that people resemble the
stocks they own - I would hate to think someone might think that I, Mr. Bon
Vivant, am a dull, cheap, low-priced person.

Chris Craft was written up in Barrons today. I think they had the numbers
wrong. I know its extremely cheap, but I don't recall it being as cheap as in
Barrons today when I analyzed it six months ago. I think they double counted
the $45 in cash. BHC is consolidated, and I think the cash is on the BHC side.
Its still incredibly cheap, but not the steal Barrons said.

James, here's what I see re CCN

No. shares and share equivalent of Chris Craft = 32M

No debt.
Cash and cash equivalents = $1.5 billion

Thus: cash and equiv./sh = about $48 dollars (Note: if anyone uses Yahoo
figures here, they are incorrect IMO because they do not include preferred
stock in their calculations.)

So cash/sh is close to the price of CCN stock, about $50.

One key is: What is the value of the 76% (approx) CCN holding in BHC?
I checked Mike B's Forbes' ref., and think I saw that Forbes did say that BHC
was worth almost $3 Billion. Well, there are about 5.3M sh. out and the
price/sh is about $125, so the market is saying the BHC is worth $668M. So for
me, what I can see right now - not being able to figure the true value of BHC
-and not believing in Forbes' glib number - each sh. of CCN has - in addition
to $48/sh in cash, some small industrial holdings (@$2/sh??), and
$668M X .76 / 32M or $16 worth of BHC.
By my scratch pad... CCN is worth at least $48+2+16=$66.
CCN is definitely undervalued at today's prices! How and when that value is
going to be released, I do not know :>). Paul

Paul,

Re: CCN's value

BHC has $668M in Class A shares, but it also has Class B shares
entirely owned by Chris Craft. How much are those Class B
shares worth is the question. If you count each of those
shares as worth one A share, then you get $3B, which is
what Forbes did. Looks like a call to the company can clear
this up.

Good Investing,

Your number of shares outstanding for BHC is wrong by a factor of 3. There are
23 million shares outstanding. Your 5 million shares is the FLOAT - i.e. what
CCN does NOT own. Do the math again and I think you'll come to a much different
conclusion. BUT I think you double counted the cash. I believe that the cash is
on BHC's balance sheet, so it is consolidated onto CCN's. Check me on that.

From:Paul Senior

James and Mike B. Yes. You are right, my numbers are wrong and my analysis is
not correct. I'll try to move us a little further in the right direction:

There are 5.3M shares of Class A BHC sh.
There are 18.0M sh. of Class B BHC sh.
Total therefore: 23.5M

I think CCN contols or owns the 18M B shares because:
18/23.5 = .76, which also is = 76% that CCN contols or owns of BHC.

The $1.5B is stashed away in BHC and consolidated in CCN, according to my
reading of SEC docs. (James, you are right, sir!) It seems to me that each
share of CCN is thus backed by 76% of $1.5B divided by 32M CCN shares. That's
about $35-$36 per share.

If I go further ---and really there's no stopping me at this point :>)
and BIG IF, BHC is valued by THOSE WHO KNOW AND WHO REPORT IT IN FORBES, as
$3B, I guess I'd back out the $1.5B of cash, which leaves $1.5B which again
going to CCN stockholders at $1.5B x .76 divided by 32M = $35-36/sh. So BHC is
worth in total, a little north of $70 per share of CCN stock. IS THIS HOW
ANYBODY ELSE SEES IT? ...whew.

And some more: If the company is worth $3B with cash, and $1.5B excluding cash
in till, then the market is undervaluing BHC, because
the market cap is 5.3 Class A sh. x $125/sh = $662M. ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THIS
CONUNDRUM? (Sorry, I'm too tired to think of a simpler word -g-)

Paul, you're still off. There are 23 million shares of BHC outstanding, agreed?
They trade at $125 a share. CCN owns 76% of them. Do some basic math and I
think you will agree your $1.5 billion is shy by about 40%. I don'thave time to
figure out where you missed it and I don't have a calculator on me, but BHC is
worth a lot more than $36 per CCN share. But you've got it though on the cash -
that is on the BHC side and thus is part of the $125 per BHC share value. This
looks like a maze, but is not real tough once you get both sets of financials
in front of you at the same time.

So the Forbes number of about $3 billion is the market value of BHC, and CCN
owns 76% of that. The teaser is that both Gabelli and Michael Price think that
BHC itself is way undervalued. What does that say for CCN?

Oh, now I see what you did. My apologies, we should come up with the same
answer. Paul took out the cash and valued BHC (the business minus the cash) at
$1.5 billion. Thats fine. Then add back the cash (which appears to be on CCN's
balance sheet through consolidation) and maybe subtract 24% of it for the
minority interest. You should come up with the same answer my methodology would
get. This is alot less complicated than it sounds if you just get a hold of
both sets of financials, as Paul did, and just say "who owns what?"

All :

Please check out http://www.scottburns.com There is an article about James
Grant's observations regarding stock options and stock repurchases by Intel and
Microsoft. The article also mentions how the "effective trailing P/E" of Intel
(after accounting for repurchases) should be about 50% higher and Microsoft's
"effective P/E" should be "much, much higher" than 51.

I am looking for somebody like Jeff Maresh (or anybody else, please!) to

James, don't apologize... I did get it not so right. But... to go on:

My problem is what to value BHC. No question CCN is UNDERVALUED based on price
of BHC stock today. If I bought CCN and the price of BHC dropped, I'd be in
some trouble because I'd redo the calculations based on stock price of BHC and
CCN wouldn't be such a great deal. So, 1)I have to have faith in the BHC buys
of the smart money boys (which I sometimes do and sometimes don't have) or
2)I'd have to know the underlying real value of BHC (which I don't know).
Othewise, I'd get nervous and sell CCN.
However in this rising market, with the rep of Mr. Price et. al, my concerns
are maybe totally wrong. Got to think on it some more. Paul

Deep Ben Graham value with a catalyst and a technical breakout. It doesn't get
better than this. I pitched this before, but there are a couple new
developments, and the stock has started to run.

Put on your research caps and pull up the financials for Tejon Ranch Company
(TRC). The stock broke out yesterday to $21 a share - today $22 on increasing
volume - and looks like it could go much further. I call this St. Joe Jr.
because it looks so much like St. Joe Corp. a year ago. Pull up a chart (SJP)
and see what happened to that one (and yes, I did catch that gain - I'm not
Monday morning quarterbacking)
- 275,000 acres of land 50 miles north of L.A. Thats the entire company and
they have done nothing with it to date.
- The majority shareholders announced in February that they want out and have
retained JP Morgan to execute it (you would think to get the share price up for
them to sell)
- last week it was announced that a vulture fund bought a large chunk of stock.
you know these guys are not going to sit around for 10 years waiting for the
price to rise on its own. They're probably in for about $17 a share, and these
guys don't invest unless they think they can get a 25-30% IRR.
- the company hired a real estate development guy two weeks ago. You will
understand how critical that fact is if you look at the 10-K and see how
undermanaged this company has been. They have literally "watched the grass
grow" until the real estate market turned up.
- The stock traded for $50 a share in 1989, the last time people got
enthusiastic about California land development. I think we are 1-2 years away
from that kind of enthusiasm now.

Got your attention? When I bought this in April, I applied some of the analysis
that worked for SJP. The qualitative stuff is there. As for quantitative, it is
easy to calculate that the land trades for about $1000 per acre. If you want to
try to buy land 50 miles north of L.A. for $1000 an acre, you better be one
hell of a negotiator, because it sells for more like $4,000 or $5,000 in the
county TRC's tract is located in. You do the math. But do it quick. I don't
like to hype stocks, but if you believe at all in technical analysis, this is a
breakout.

This is not a hard one to research. You need to look at the news releases since
January, and find some way to get comfortable that developable land 50 miles
from LA is worth much more than $1,000 an acre. Any real estate professional
will confirm that for you.

James, have you actually visited this place?

After I got the annual report, I had occasion to drive from LA to Bakersfied on
the main highway. And I passed by Tejon Ranch. I started out 4pm on a Fri. Well
of course, traffic jams. The odd thing I thought was that I am out of LA (or so
it felt), in the countryside on a four, maybe five lane expressway going North
(and there are maybe 5 lanes going South) - nothing on either side of the road
but countryside - and I am dead stopped in a traffic jam. No accidents - just
people trying to get home (they must live underground? or on houses in way off
side roads). Finally traffic eases up, and I pass more miles of flat land and
rolling hills. A sign for Tejon Ranch. I keep going, down a long hill coming
into Bakersfield. Miles of farmland - no shortage of buildable land I would
guess.
I gave up on Tejon, because I couldn't see who would live in such a place. Too
difficult to get to LA-it's not the 50 miles,it's the time in traffic, and if
it's Bakersfield you want - plenty of land there already. Who is going to live
in all the 1000's of homes that Tejon is envisioning? Well maybe if you just
build it(them), They will come. And Mr. Whittman of 3rd Value always seems to
have a back door to his investments - I can't recall him EVER missing. I
thought I read him as saying it would take several years to develop the land or
see the payoff as an investment? Probably will be more opportunities to buy
into Tejon. Meanwhile ... very nice call on your part. Paul

Jim: No, I don't use the product, but it's not fundamental for me.

I'm not really a believer in the Peter Lynch school that says invest in
products you use. Oh, I think about it and sometimes ask around for retail
stuff, and I own MFI (McFrugal's) because it's near me and always has a few
customers (including me)(the only stock I own BECAUSE I use the product and can
see the sales environment), but generally I believe that if you only invest in
companies whose products you use, you limit yourself too severly. Conversely
(if that's the right logical word), I've learned too too late that it's okay to
buy stock in companies who's products you almost certainly might never buy...
like Ford or Chrysler (for me)... The big benefit IMO to owning stock in a
company whose products you do use and like is that sometimes this gives you
confidence and patience to hold the stock as it rises or if it encounters bad
times. Paul

Paul: <I'm not really a believer in the Peter Lynch school that says invest in

I do, but that's beside the point. Peter Lynch indicates invest in stocks where
you have an edge and you can get in ahead of the crowd - maybe once or twice
per year will have opportunity - i have made money using that approach (like
triple on my local bank based on leafing thru annual report while waiting).
That is just one part of his approach.

IMO, this is more like prudent due diligence for this company in this industry.
I would think that if a product is available to me and I don't use it (and the
product's success is based on how many people watch it) that would be a reason
not to bet on the company's success - that's what you are doing with ccn on
UPN. Especially if it's free!

Now that you suggested it, maybe I'll reconsider Little Switzerland for a visit

Your suggestion of CRG highlights the entire CRG circle of companies - ie
Reading Entertainment and Citadel Holding. RDGE pops out because after Stater
Bros. redeems its preferred, RDGE will have $100 million in cash, no debt -
which translates into $13.33 cash with the stock selling at $11.25. Of course,
CRG owns 78% of RDGE (assuming conversion of their preferred at $12.50; and per
share cash declines with conversion) Complicated interlock, but if you like

And the other vulture who just invested, Carl Marks (nice name), is also a
highly respected opportunistic investor. Just because it may take 3 years to
start development doesn't mean the stock won't run in anticipation. Up another

thirties because I know there would be a different kind of risk at that point.
