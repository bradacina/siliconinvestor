Mike, re: ANLY,Bill Miller,PEP

ANLY: the dividend will be paid to shareholders of record as of Aug 13, Friday.
How much of the quick move this afternoon relates to the upcoming dividend?

Bill Miller: He focuses not much on PE but return on capital. See this 8/99
article from Money:
http://cgi.pathfinder.com/money/archive/magarticle/0,4015,9060,00.html
Here is an excerpt included here for discussion purposes:
Unwilling to accept the idea that value investing was something
that went in and out of style, Miller began to look back at his
picks over the years to try to figure out what characteristics
his winners had in common. "It became clear to me," he says now,
"that low P/E and low price-to-book were not the best predictors
of return." After all, he adds, "crummy" valuations don't
automatically signal that a stock is undervalued; sometimes they
mean that "the underlying business is crummy." The measure that
he locked on to instead--the one that best predicted whether a
stock would be a winner, according to his research--was return
on capital. That is, the companies that did the best job of
creating new value by reinvesting their capital were most likely
to be rewarded with high stock prices.

PEP: Held tough yesterday, more or less treading water today. Read your
thoughts on it on valuestocks.net...what is your target? I may take a position.

Two value (imo) stocks I like: BBDC, ACAS: I like the general category of
"investment companies." With them, and especially with these two, because they
are microcaps with not a lot of history, and because this also holds true for
the companies that they loan to and/or invest in (often private companies, so
there's not much info. available to the general public) -- it's perhaps prudent
to own a package of these "investment companies". I'd say say that an investor
ought to have patience- stock performance seems (imo) to come slowly. And
earnings can be erratic as the companies sell some of the stocks or options
that they hold.

I forgot who else on the thread besides me likes the category, but for that
person, here's some info on the two I am buying now:

ACAS: Added to my position after they reported good quarterly earnings. They
just now are completing a secondary at $17. (Stock is at 17 this am.) Book
value (Yahoo) about $14. No LTD. They primarily loan money to small businesses.
9.7% dividend yield.

BBDC: Started a new position. Stock is going for about 7 3/16 this am. They are
investors. They hold $5.7/sh in cash (including about 80c just committed to a
new business investment). Book value is about $12.8. No LTD. (These are based
on Yahoo figures. Latest SEC Quarterly slightly different.)

-g- JMHO, but these two companies might be better investments now than for
somebody to wait for a hurricane to strike NYC so they can short BRK. . . . .
Although. . . . one never knows -g-

HGR -- It looks good to me, opinions appreciated.

Hanger Orthopegic Group. Health Care. They mfg and sell orthotics (braces) and
prosthesis (artificial limbs) -- O&P. They manufacture, distribute (they sell
to non-Hanger O&P centers) and also have "stores" -- patient care centers.

They have a nice history of sales and revenue growth. Clean accounting. No debt
until recent acquisition of a larger company in the sector -- Nova Care. So now
half debt/equity. They are the dominant company in the market. All the analysts
see the merger with Nova Care as very strategically sound. The company has been
increasing market share and has been doing it while increasing margins -- so
they are not stealing volume via price reductions.

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/990809/md_hanger__1.html

I've got copies of all the anaylst reports and I do not see anything negative.
Well one thing -- Alex Brown mentions that they do NOT think that a proposal to
reduce Medicare O&P rates is under ACTIVE consideration by Congress. I am
unsure what "active' means. But since them mentioned it - maybe something's up.
Company mgmt believes that a law requiring disbursement of orthotics only to
certified O&P professionals is more likely to be passed. This would benefit HGR
since all practicioners are certified. This negative item was not worth a whole
paragraph here, I think.

Novacare's branches have just started buying thru Hanger's distribution system.
They expect $11 million of G&A savings with the merger, I have read. I haven't
looked too closely at the acquired Nova Care since it seems to be a division of
a larger company. Analysts say it is 1.5 Hanger's size, more profitable but
slower growing. Blah, blah, blah....

I will buy this one soon unless you smart guys see something that I missed.
Thanks for the help.

Here's a clip from their webpage, the Nova care paragraph seem up to date, but
the 1987 info is old -- 1998 revenue mix is 81%, 14%, 5%.

Hanger Orthopedic Group, Inc. is the largest public company specializing
exclusively in practice management for orthotics and prosthetics. Following the
acquisitions of J.E. Hanger of Georgia and NovaCare Orthotics and Prosthetics,
the company owns and operates over 650 patient care centers in 42 states and
the District of Columbia.

Hanger is vertically integrated, manufacturing custom-made and prefabricated
orthotics and prosthetics, as well as being the largest distributor of
components and finished patient care products in the 0&P industry.

The company has aggressively addressed the impact of the growth of managed care
with the formation of OPNET, a unique national managed care network that
provides patient care services to over 336 managed
care programs.

Hanger's 1997 revenues of $130 million were generated from three operating
segments: patient care -74%; distribution -19%; and manufacturing -7%.

MOO,

Thanks for the Miller insight. Re: ANLY, thought it was really taking off there
for a second. But only a second. It hit all kinds of old resistance, and once
it started to back off a significant number of those holding from the last time
it was at 16 started to sell into it. Think I may have another Deswell or
Midway on my hands. My hope is that when these types of companies really do
take off, it will be huge enough to justify all this teasing.

Re: PEP, I don't have a target. Plan on just holding it for a good long while.

Grommit,

Thanks for mentioning HGR. It looks like after many years of sub-par
performance management has started focusing on ROA and ROE. The other part of
HGR that I like is that you can get a solid growth rate (20+%) along with it.
You get margin expansion and potential for multiple expansion with PE at @15.

To a degree I liked the way the company was looking _before_ the acquisition of
Novacare added the debt to the balance sheet. The acquisition sortof throws a
monkey wrench into things. Clearly though, things were improving dramatically
before the purchase.

Thanks again for mentioning

HGR is a 'could be'. I'd guess it depends on the pe multiple you accord the
earnings. And that pe has been all over the place in past years. HGR's never
earned better than 10% on its BV. BV is 9. So, analysts' estimates I see about
.90 for this year look reasonable to me. At current price-- 13-13 1/2, it might
work out okay.

That price is about 1.5 book which seems fair value to me. For me, nothing
catching my attention to look further. JMO after a 3 minute look. (But I've

Put MCK in my "professional" basket - i.e. if you have to be fully invested and
have to buy large cap companies, this is a buy. Personally, I am not buying
much of anything.

So far my short positions are working out great despite a hit today. Amazon
looks like a dying stock, and I have been in and out of it - shorting rallies
and covering at 83. So far that strategy has worked perfectly, and the rallies
are getting smaller and smaller. When this stock breaks that support level,
look out below - next stop 50. The other two, The Globe.com and The Street.com
have fallen 20-30% each since I first shorted, but I have been feeding them on
the way down, so my cost basis has decreased. Significantly, TGLO has broken
through all support levels and TSCM broke through its $19 IPO price. I'm
feeling comfortable and just keep shorting more as they drop. Today was a
pretty good rally though nothing like the rallies this sector has seen before.
My other short, Citigroup, was more symbolic of a market call, though the
valuation also looks pretty extended. I should have gone with my initial
instinct to short Goldman, but Citi has still moved about 10% in my favor.
Hopefully we didn't just see a bottom in the internet sector, or I'm in trouble
because I've got a pretty big line cast at the moment.

My first baby is going to be born tomorrow (planned delivery so we know). If
the market crashes the day he is born, I told my wife his middle name is going
to be Amazon. (No, not really) The market tanked in '97 when I was on vacation.
Maybe history repeats itself - my two week vacation starts tomorrow. Not to
make anybody nervous or anything...I would never do that!

Bob, I followed your HRP link to your interesting post on the REIT thread. My
questions are:
(1) Do you think the SNH shares will fall fairly quickly as HRPT shareholders
simply choose to dispose of the distributed shares of this spin off?
(2) HRPT is spinning off 51% of its senior housing business. Will that be
enough of a spinoff to change HRPT's "identity"? If not, the risk is the
dividend yield stays near current levels, continues to be valued as a
healthcare REIT with a similar yield. Worse case, the market does not "revalue"
HRPT, and the market simply maintains a similar dividend yield, the price would
= 1.24/say 11% = $11.27.
Seems like that is the real risk...good luck

Mike MOO: HRP Regarding how the SNH spinoff shares will respond - I'm expecting
some sell-off as holders of the office HRP that don't want the healthcare SNH
sell the shares, but I expect the office shares to gain more than enough to
offset that. The risk you identify is real, but the valuation disparity offsets
it for me. I wish I knew better how to anticipate the the market's response,
but the best I can do is bet on the value and hope the catalyst of the spin is
enough to release it. In the meantime, I'm collecting over 10% yield while
waiting for the market to come to see the value. The spin is evidence that HRP
is scramblin to get real value recognized and presumably will continue to do
so.
According to Merrill's Eric Hemel, the office pipeline has contracted quite a
bit recently implying stability [overbuilding is key risk] and superior value
for REIT market segment with 7% yield and 10% growth factor. He also sites lack
of retail investor interest - which plays to your point that this may take
awhile to play out - as one reason values are generally compelling. This is a
much better value than that already undervalued office reit segment, IMO.
The healthcare portion, I may sell on the spin and buyback as selling is
exhausted.

I picked up some shares of Flowers Industries (FLO) over the last 2 days. Their
55% stake in Keebler is worth about $13 per share. That means the rest of the
business is selling for $2-$3. It's hard to place an exact number on the

Wayne,

Thanks for posting on Flowers Ind. Interesting situation, but I'm not sure how
to value the $2,75/share value that's non-Keebler. (Keebler doesn't look to be
largely over or undervalued, so I'll assume the market is pretty efficient
there.) Flowers does have a lot of quality brand names, but up to now these
brand names haven't been able to produce a whole lot of earnings yet ( but have
plenty of recurring "non-recurring" charges). That said, they are investing
more heavily than in the past, so if that works out on their quest to be the
low cost producer then maybe there's hope for improving EPS. I guess it comes
down to how much do I pay for probably a fairly probable $0.40-$0.50 EPS a year
out, and what are the odds of growth?

If the growth story is not good then this is an asset based buy with a sell
around perhaps $20/share. If this is a growth story - which some of the
elements seem to be in place - then perhaps a longer term hold. I guess I
kindof wonder what kind of investment this is for you? I would appreciate your
input here. I'm leaning towards making a buy - but probably based on assets
rather than growth.

I generally agree with you. I'm not quite sure how to value Mr's Smiths or
Flowers Bakeries either. There's a lot of investment going on, but there's a
lot of one time charges too. I think at a stock price of 15-16 you are getting
them very cheaply though. Keebler also looks like they are really getting their
act together so that stake could become much more valuable over time.

If anything I expect the surprises to be on the favorable side. At least if you
look out to next year. In this environment that's the best I can do within my

I think if you look at Keebler's future, they're trading at less than 12 times
cash earnings a year or two out. We don't really know where they'll be, but a
good guess is that they'll keep growing and surprising. KBL itself is
undervalued IMO, and the analysts are behind on that story.

I'd say with FLO we're getting KBL at fair value, and Mrs. Smith's and the
bakery for free. Mrs. Smith's is about to run out of one-time charges. I look
at it as a growth story, producing earnings where there were losses. The
bakeries are slow steady growth.

It's an asset play now that likely will turn into a Buffett-like steady grower.
One of those where the ones buying now could look like geniuses.

A couple net-nets. One old one and one new one.

I posted Lazare Kaplan, a net-net diamond cutter, in April when I bought it at
an average cost of about 8. The rationale was that a) it is a net-net, b) the
diamond business is turning (look at the charts of DBRSY and TIF, and c) the
company is buying back shares. The stock ran to 11 in two months, but the
latest quarter was miserable and the stock has fallen back to the price I paid.
What have I learned? First, this is an even worse business than I thought it
was. And second, when a net-net goes up 50% from your entry price (7) in two
months, sell half at least. I got greedy after following my discipline on HYDEA
and PSO and making good money, then watching one double and the other
quadruple. LKI is a buy where it is (8 1/4). Just print out a chart of DeBeers
for the last ten years and a chart of LKI and you will see why I think there is
a catalyst here for this net-net.

And a new one. You should take a good look at Elder Beerman (EBSC) over the
weekend. It is a department store chain in the midwest. I own this at about 6
1/2. It has gone up in the last few days, but let me just point out four
things: 1) The company is profitable, 2) Net-net value is about $7.50 a share,
3) Book value is about $15 a share. 4) An investor filed a 13-D last week
saying he owns 5% of the company and will take steps to get rid of management
or sell the company. The stock now trades at 6 3/4. I think you're looking at
$9-13 once the sellers get done selling (they issued shares above $20 about a
year ago, and the IPO price in December 1997 was in the high teens.) Look
forward to hearing any insights if others look into this one. (hint: before you
tell me they have $140 million of debt read the 10-K. They don't.)

James:

EBSC looks intriguing. Wondering how you figured the $7.50/share net cash??? I
found only $6.50/sh per 1999 most recent 10-Q. Also, lots of inventory and
receivables.

Nevertheless, at today's price you receive an operating entity that dates back
to 1847 and currently generates $632 million annual sales revenue (per 1998)
for free. Not bad.

Who is DAVID NIERENBERG??? HAREDALE, LTD.??? JAMES HENRY HILDEBRANDT??? TOXFORD
CORPORATION??? Has anyone ever heard of these guys??? Have they ever been
successful in any other similar endeavors????

The Chapter 11 is concerning, and for no tangible reason that I can point to
either, except that, in my mind, irrationally or rationally, it sometimes is
the final symbol of the culmination of poor business economics working in
combination that ultimately results in business failure, even though, as the
10-k reports, the company maintains an historical competitive advantage having
a niche in medium and small size cities, selling higher end brands of
merchandise, etc., etc.

Down side risk is first and foremost concern, and it seems at cash or net cash
value there is a floor not much lower than perhaps 1/3 off todays price.
They're not presently losing much money (($188,000) for 13 weeks ending 5/1/99)
and made $1.76/share in 1998.

Also seems there might be a quick upside potential given the NIERENBERG, et al
factor.

Hope the thread shares further discussion on this one, as I am tempted, but
undecided, with uninvested cash kicking around in an overvalued market (e.g has
anyone been in any of these stores??? are they merchandised well??? are they
similar to, maybe, Kaufmans? Peebles? The Bon Ton?? Do they have any pizzazz,
or when you walk in does it look like death warmed over??)

-- off topic --

Also, James, congratulations on the birth of your son. I know that's pretty
exciting and I am sure you will know soon what a thrill it always is to hear of
others experiencing parenthood. Brings back a lot of fairly recent happy

By coincidence, EBSC is outlined in a Barrons interview today. I don't know if

I was concerned about the chapter 11 filing too - they went bankrupt in late

in 1997 under new management. I am more concerned about their expansion plans.
They should be using their capital to buy back stock, not build new stores.

Hi Jim. Yes those two-- LKI and EBSC might work out as net-nets.

I'm not understanding what to infer from your statement that EBSC does not have
$140M in long term debt. I calculate from the 10k, p.20 that net-net is 338M of
current assets minus 87M of current liabilities minus $121.5M of "long term
obligations" minus 8M of deferred items which is about $7.5/sh. Which is what
you are saying.

These "long term obligations less current portion" are "three-year variable
rate securitization loan agreements" -- whatever that is. If you're saying
$140M is actually about $121.5M, okay. If there's more that I should be picking
up on, like these securitiztion loans are some bookkeeping entry only, it's
going to get to be too complicated for me -g-.

a lot of debt. I checked to see if there are signs of the credit card portfolio

Easy shot. Most people value FCH as the REIT that it is, so they use funds from
operations as a key measure of performance. FCH dropped to new lows after
reported FFO was not as high as expected. This coupled with an analyst
downgrade tanked the stock. REITs are still not much liked by most investors
imo, and FCH being a hotel REIT is even less favorable because investors
perceive that in an economic downturn, hotel occupancy rates increase and/or
revenue per room stagnates or declines. (Unlike commercial or apartment REITS
with more stable income streams.) When you read the Yahoo posts you will see
that several posters fault FCH in particular for overpaying for its past hotel
chain acquisition plus criticize FCH for trying to upscale the hotels which
they do have. Some believe FCH may be ineffective in trying to move away from
the overly "hoteled" midprice market they are in.
In short, not a pretty picture.

I'm a buyer of FCH in low 20's and have added to my position as the stock has
dropped into the teens. My reason for buying is that IF the company can
maintain its dividend yield (now 12%), and IF I can find the patience to live
with this company for a few years, I maybe might be satisfied with the yield
(I'm old enough to have gone years with some companies and not seen 12%
returns); plus I also expect somewhere along the line to get a chance to see
something good happen to FCH stock. So far, the insiders seem to be buying or
holding as you've mentioned, and that is possibly a good sign (i.e. at least I
don't see the management bailing).
FCH was discussed on this thread before. At the time, some people also liked
LHO. You might look at that hotel REIT also. (smaller, but primo properties,
imo; although the price has gone up quite a bit). You should also check with
Richard Barron on his REIT thread on SI. His last post, for example---- and
this one: Reply #1431, Date: Aug 4. If Jim Clarke on this thread offers a REIT
for consideration... it should be considered.

Didn't mean to make it sound like any more than it was. Just a read of the

the company. All I was trying to say was that I had looked at the issue of
credit card receivables, and it looked OK. If I had seen steadily rising
delinquencies, or no reserves, I would have considered it a negative. You're
right to call me on that though - my statement probably sounded like I had done

Felcor sounds interesting. Hotel REITs are in the outhouse behind the doghouse
right now. I own LaSalle, which pays an 11% yield, and I like management. They
have done everything they said they would do a year ago, and continue to buy
their own stock. I have looked at Felcor a couple of times on the way down and
said yuck. One of these times its going to be a screaming buy. Thanks for the
heads up. I'll look at it one more time. (But as Paul said, book value doesn't
matter in this industry - all that tells you is what they (over?)paid for their
properties. Maybe that was the right price, maybe not. I spent three years with
a major real estate vulture fund in the last downturn, and we NEVER even looked
at book value. Just watch cash.) My REIT buys now are Colonial Properties for
the very conservative, and Host Marriott for those who want to take a little
more risk - hotel REITs are about as out of favor as you can get, but there is
no hotel REIT with a better quality portfolio or management than Host Marriott.
8.4% yield. And these are Marriott flagged properties. Take my word for it -
whatever the macro environment for the next five years, Marriott flags are
going to do a lot better than Felcor's hotels.

David, you asked if anyone had been in Elder Beerman's. I grew up in Dayton,
Ohio, and in that time Rike's and Elder Beerman were the big downtown stores
and that was the pinnacle of shopping. Rikes was like Macy's, complete with
Christmas window display that you packed up the whole family to go see. Then
the malls came. Rikes is now Lazarus. And Elder Beerman's is basically the same
size fish it always was but the pond is now bigger. There are malls the size of
Wright-Patterson AFB, Best Buys, Toys R Us, so much development where there
used to be cornfields. There are mall anchors like Parisian that until recently
Elder Beermans never had to compete with, and they are indeed snazzy stores.
Beermans is the kind of place my grandma shopped at. I haven't been home much
lately, but I wouldn't say their stores were bad at all, just typical and dull.
They have a showpiece location on Courthouse Square, the center of Dayton. I'll
have to ask my mom, the shopping expert, but I think they are fine. Hope that

Thanks for your brief personal recollection of the Elder-Beerman's department

What a disappointment to find out about the Barron's write-up from James after

I am seriously looking at LKI. Yesterday's price is as low as I've seen in

Dull translates to consistency and this company certainly has a long history,
although their new approach and perhaps new competition has caused problems. 

To expand on the earlier historical story of Elder-Beerman, I would add this:

the forerunner that dates back to the 1800's is Elder-Johnson, long knosn as
Elder's. It was the original competition to Rike's for most of the 100 or so
years of both their histories.

Elder's was eventually being run by the family by an excessively dull witted
descendant of the founder and the company went bankrupt or threatened too
(after a decade or more of failing to keep up with Rike's after it affiliated
with Federated Dept. Stores, aka Lazarus.)

Arthur Beerman, a Dayton real estate wheeler dealer, who had a line of
extremely cheap fourth rate discount stores, came in and bought out the Elder
family for pennies on the dollar and appropriated the name to his. After that,
they did upgrade their stores significantly and expand around the metro area
(Elder's had kept a single downtown store all through the exodus to the
suburbs, while Rike's had moved to the suburbs and kept the flagship store
downtown. If Rikes/Shillitos/Lazarus/Federated made an error, it was to try to
do both - just in the last few years (less than 10) they finally closed the
downtown store.

I haven't lived in the area for 30 years, but I would say that Elder-Beerman
still has second rate locations compared to Rike's/Lazarus. They also operate a
line of discount furniture and discount shoe stores under the name El-Bee,
unless they gave that up or spun it off.

I don't know how much geographic diversification Elder-Beerman has achieved,
certainly not anything like Federated.

None of this is intended to express any opinion about it's current value, just
wanted to add some company history and context, raise some questions.

All, this might be flame bait, I hope not, but what catalyst would
Elder-Beerman possibly have to justify investing in this apparently sleepy
old-style dept store chain? Does the company manage its inventory particularly
well? Do they have some unique niche? It appears they are doing nothing
different in the face of a host of new competitors and new retail environment.
I never heard of them but it sounds like another chain I remember called
Rich's...another old style department store, very clean, but also very
ordinary. The chain is long gone. One possibility might be if there is still
significant family ownership, perhaps they may try to take the chain private.
Otherwise, I think this great "value" will remain a great "value" for a long
time indeed. JMO.

was aware that the stock had tanked and thought it best to stay away from it.
She mentioned that it was always a family run company and that some people were
still loyal to it becuase it was local. She said some people still don't shop
at Lazarus (used to be Rike's) because of that loyalty. I'm guessing that
wouldn't apply to younger people who wouldn't know. She thought the flagship
store in Courthouse Square would have a hard time making it, since the only
business they get is from the business crowd doing lunchtime shopping. However
it has been there a long time. As for the store condition, she still frequents

world "investors" don't care if "analysts" add the extra zero (and I think they
do). GM trades at $67. What a bargain.

I am short Amazon, and it is kicking my butt. Again. I hate this stock with a

David, I looked at CDEN. It's too tough for me to figure, but I'll put it on my
watch list and defer to anyone who might have a knowledgeable opinion.

The financials look very good as you point out. I've followed a couple of these
dental practice accumulators; the one stock I did buy worked out well for me
(they were taken out by a large insurance company). So CDEN could work out very
well too, possibly, based on my experience.

There's just something odd about this whole industry. Run by dentists - I'm not
sure how good they are as the corporate types they must become. The practices
that are bought out have trouble keeping the spirit of the sole practitioner.
The guys who get stock seem, imo, to look for exit points. And - surprising to
me - the business depends on the economy. (I always thought if people had
problems with their teeth/gums they'd go seek assistance. Not so, according to
dentists I know. If economic times are tough, lot of dentistry is postponable
or postponed.) Anyway,IMO, somehow it is just not so easy to get synergy or
profits out of these consolidated dental practices. So earnings IMO are erratic
and subject to manipulation as dental practices are bought and brought into the
fold. (note: I claim no analytical, financial or dental skills here.)

On the other hand (again -g-), if we look at it like I might look at DAIO, then
we just say the heck with the business model - buy based on cash in the drawer
and get the going business aspect for free. Which might be possible-- this
stock fluctuates quite a bit (?) moving yesterday between 3 3/8 and 4 5/8.
Right now, for me, CDEN @ 4 5/8, I just don't see as a compelling buy.

Comments on stocks in this week's Barron's Bill Nygren article:

Bill Nygren, "a value-oriented investor (who) specializes in sussing out
erstwhile growth companies that have been left for dead" is manager of the
Oakmark Select fund.

I'm going to mention some of the stocks in his top 10 holdings (as listed by
Barron's), because most of them have been discussed here (or on the Buffett
thread), and there may still be some interest for us. Also, I've been thinking
about one in particular and would like to bring it to the thread's attention
for any comment. (Aside: man, does this guy run a concentrated portfolio- the
10 stocks are almost 2/3 of the whole thing.)

USG: Discussed briefly here last year (? )I think. At the time, some of the
media pundits (in Barron's!) thought there was a big shortage of gypsum
wallboard - one of the few things in building industry that was going up in
price (so recommendation in Barron's was to buy the largest producer-- USG) Now
we're seeing additional supply (from others) coming in. Stock is down from its
high. It's Nygren's biggest holding (according to Barron's) and "his most
contrarian play".

REY: Discussed here 2 years ago by me at lower prices. I still have a small
position A number of paragraphs are taken up in the article to say: REY is
selling for a low pe and benefits from it's internet venture with Microsoft,
and with the consolidation of the car business. They are a management info.
sys. company dealing primarily with major car manufactures- also (not discussed
in article) they are expanding into the health care industry. Also, imo, REY
are very tough business people (afterall -g-, everyday they have to deal with
car salesmen), and the company does have a history of generating profits. And
the stock, imo,is undervalued. However, the car business is stable or
declining,and the health industry info. sys. business is competitive and so, I
would not be a buyer of REY here (unless just playing for a 2-3 point
short-term gain).

Washington Mutual (WM): A Mike Burry pick, and Mr. Nygren's #2 holding.

Thermo Electron (TMO). I like the stock here at the current price. I have a
position. A bet that they will successfully, eventually consolidate their
operations and that there are some profits to be had in fewer number of
businesses and better management of their technology expertise. (So far, the
bet is not working out.)

Ralston Purina (RAL): discussed on Buffett thread

Partner Re: I looked at it and passed. Having some profit problems this
quarter. But selling below book. I'll try to remember to relook after hurricane
season.

US Industries (USI): Seems like I look at this one every year or so and never
can get any enthusiasm for this conglomerate. They just seem so mediocre. I
would not by it at current price, unless somebody could offer a compelling
reason.

Dun and Bradstreet (DNB). Well, I've been thinking about it for a couple of
weeks. Price has come down. PE might even be reasonable. They have a couple of
things going for them which fit into a Buffett model (maybe): Brand name (in
addition to 'get me a D&B on them', they also own the profitable Moody's).
Consistency - been around a zillion years. Moat?-- Pretty hard to avoid them
when you need the info. they provide. What I don't like is: lots of negativity
about crummy management on Yahoo. And it does seem like the managers are
entrenched, slow, complacent (which of course is way away from what Mr. Buffett
seeks). Which affects my belief that this quarter's lousy earnings could be or
would be recovered as the business plans and/or management's corrective actions
kick in. In the 10k, there's a little note saying the gov't is suing for back
taxes and if they prevail, it's very possible (to me) that a big surprise hit
to the stock will occur if the gov't does move closer in on DNB.
I need to get to a Value Line-- can't find a long history on the company due I
think to some transitions. Meanwhile, anybody out there with an opinion?

<So earnings IMO are erratic and subject to manipulation as dental practices
are bought and brought into the fold. (note: I claim no analytical, financial
or dental skills here.) >

Especially after CFO resignation. Any obvious signs of any such manipulation
that you can detect???? I'm not sure that I am good a detecting these types of
things.

Also, I view this one for me as a DAIO type of investment, but in this case
purchase of an extremely discounted business. The history (although short)
makes the recent lows tempting. Curious why this company has fallen from grace
so rapidly. Perhaps that's indication enough that something is not quite right,
although it would certainly be nice if this was an example of extreme market
inefficiency.

Seems that this consolidation of dental/orthodontic practices was the rage not
too long ago.

Would appreciate any comments from Mike Burry if he happens to be reading these
posts, who I know might be able to draw some analogies from his medical
background.

Yours & etc.

Michael, I didn't know Miller was long Bank One. But you're right...I see at
6/30/99 it was one of his top 10 holdings. LMVTX's NAV barely budged in
response to ONE on 8/25, suggesting he had skinnied down his position during
the qtr (doubtful, he does not trade per se) and/or simply his pet top 2
holdings Dell and AOL buoyed his portfolio. Both stocks had a great day on
8/25.

Has anyone looked at restaurant stocks lately. I noticed some insider buying

Speaking of Miller and Nygren and me, I just noticed that Washington Mutual
(WM) saw 4 different insiders buy significant amounts of stock at the end of
July. IMO, given that the risk here is that there is some trouble behind the
scenes that is not now apparent (after all, it is an S&L), the insider buying,
which is backed by previous insider buying last year at these levels, is
comforting. Looking to add more.

BTW, I did buy Ross Stores (ROST) yesterday. Excellent returns on investment,
no long-term debt, with improving operational efficiency. All at its historic
average PE of 13. My feeling is that there will be multiple expansion as the
Ross concept becomes more and more efficient. Earnings should bump along at
10-15% growth.

I added more Pepsi and more Fair Isaac yesterday as well.

Both Fair Isaac and Washington Mutual were blindsided by the Bank One fiasco,
somewhat unfairly IMO.

for Cognos (COGN), a co. with good technology but stuck in the mud at 20, PE

Yeah, I saw your post to this effect on the Yahoo Board. My feeling is that we

new platforms. And the report was delayed. I expected horrible numbers. And I
bought back in at 11 1/8 during the wait anyway. The numbers were surprising
but don't bother me.

I'm not buying this for earnings predictability. I'm buying it so I can be
there when the fruition of Redstone's activities comes to pass. Hopefully it
won't be the unloading of his shares ;) I have a strong suspicion - based on
the spin-off tax rules, the insider buying -we'll get bought out mid-2000. In
the interim, I won't buy at higher prices than Redstone has recently paid. His
slowdown could be just the result of higher share prices.

CHB I was very wrong, and right, on. The way I saw it, there were forces
occurring that I could not possibly be the first to know about. If I'm in
clinic all day, I just won't know when the sh** hits the fan. So I just let the
chart dictate. I knew it was more contrarian than anything. No tangible book
and debt isn't bad if things turn around even a little bit. But no way was I
going to hold once it made new lows. That was a strong psychological barrier
that got blown off its hinges.

An interesting thing about CHB is that as long as I was long, I was definitely
biased. From the sidelines, something cleared and I realized that no matter how
good the demand for these homes, barriers to entry are low and sooner or later
supply would create a soft market. I'm sure Clayton will survive, but it's a
vicious business.

I think Fair Isaac is another similar problem, as is Mattel. Fair Isaac has
been very steady over many years, and sports excellent numbers. But if all new
home buying, car buying, and credit card issuing declines significantly, will
lenders still be buying into FICO? Will it become even more important? Maybe
so, but maybe the software won't sell as well anyway. If it really is the end
of an era at Fair Isaac, I suspect that it will break through the bottom of its
years-long trading range on the strength of insider leaks. The stock has a
history of reacting correctly in the day or two before significant news. I'd
bet it was happening again and get out quick.

Mattel is simply a contrarian play with a lot of good brands that may or may
not be becoming obsolete. I'm betting it isn't and feel the odds are on my
side. But if it is, someone else will know before me. The support will be
busted, and I'll end up selling my Mattel to Jim at 20 or so.

Bob,

Sorry to say I haven't seen or done any research like that, but I think it
would be quite revealing.

I think the key is to find companies that earn a high return on capital because
they have some sort of business edge, superior model or other advantage that is
sustainable. They must also be in a business that does not change much.

If a company possesses those qualities and the market for potential growth is
large enough you might have a company that can grow rapidly for a very long
time.

They are few and far between and not very easy to identify. I think that's why
there are so many bloodbaths when people pay high prices for growth.

Ross Stores: I looked into them before, not recently. Here in No. Cal. they are
big. When they started they were clearing a lot of dept. stores materials
(e.g., Macy's spring clothes that got remaindered out in July), but as a
percentage these sales are much smaller now it seems. Sort of like the
transition where outlet stores went from selling overruns, seconds, etc, and
just became more like a regular retailer. Much of the Ross inventory now is
"no-name" stuff now, made in China etc. They are at Market saturation in the
Bay Area now.

What turned me off about Ross before was the pay of the top executive. It
seemed out of line at the time. But maybe he was worth it.

re: CHB/FLE/CMH,SPF,MWY, NOC, DAB

Because some of these mobile home manufacturers have expanded into retail
sales, I believe they will eventually get better control of the entire supply
chain from build-sell-install. This should alleviate some of the problems of
each company overbuilding and excess supplies in retail centers. But not
necessarily reduce the overbuilding in toto because of too many competitors. We
are seeing manufacturing rationalization (layoffs)now by several manufacturers.
I still like Fleetwood (FLE): lots of cash, dividend, large, and I see now they
are advertising on TV. I still own Clayton Homes (CMH)too - as they hit new
lows. Oops. They are not going away though, and I am considering adding to
position if/when the stock drops further.

I've added to my position in SPF (Standard Pacific). They are a homebuilder
which serves a market niche I like: move-up homes in California. And they've
got the land to do it. When some of you Silicon Valley guys start looking to
transfer your options and stock profits to tangibles-- I suspect that an SPF
home might be a consideration.

I've greatly reduced my position in Northrop (NOC) after some favorable
analysts comments pumped the stock and the stock has started to retrace; I have
taken some profits in Midway (MDY)this week too, to trim my position a little.
Unfortunately or unwisely for me, I own Dave & Busters (DAB). With Friday's DAB
debacle, I used funds to add to this position.

but in view of the earnings forecast and regaining their international markets
have been thinking of buying the stock back.)

My biggest holding: HDWY, a true value play.

This company (by the way, don't look into the thread, not active)is a real
value play. They have grown this company considerably, look at the growth in
EPS and revenues. EPS for this year expected to be 0,52 and for next year 0,62.
The company is valued now at 10 times this year earnings and about 8 times next
years earnings. The company is growing about 15-20% each year. Soros (through
White Rock Capital) has a holding of about 11% in the company. The stock is a
take over candidate, the CEO is a winner.

I think this stock could be taken out around USD 10,- soon, otherwise the
downside risk is limited, only when there are fears of a recession the stock
could go down.

The problem, the company is too small to have analysts cover the stock more and
give strong buy ratings for it. Matt Roswell of Legg Mason is enthousiastic
about this company but is not allowed to give a strong buy rating because of
the size.

The stock has been trading above 12 last year, so look into it.

Another company, not a real value play but a take over play is HAIN. Look at
the story about Kellog who wants to expand in the health food business. I think
something is in the works here and I expect the company to be taken out within
a few weeks above USD 30,-.

These are just my predictions. Do your own DD. If you have any questions just
let me know.

I like this board because it is looking into real value plays. I will keep
coming back here.

IDTC is also a real value play, remember that they own 58% of NTOP. If you
calculate with a NTOP price of USD 40 (conservative, look where it is now),
this would reflect a price of USD 28,5 for IDTC without their own core
business. A conservative price for their own business is worth about USD 15, so
that would make a total of around USD 44. The market is not looking at it now
that way, I had several discussions about it with one of my brokers. I am a
portfolio manager BTW and manage portfolios worth USD 400 mio.

Take care,

Jeffrey, yep I read everything you post here and when I come across your Yahoo
posts.

To recap (as I see it): The top manufacturing housing wholesale market share
leaders (1998) were: Champion (18.3%), Fleetwood (17.7%), Oakwood (10.2%),
Clayton (7.6%), and Cavalier (6.5%) (ref: Manufactured Home Merchandise, June
'99, per FLE Annual).

They are all taking a hit. I own FLE which is similar to CHB in that they are
both RV mfgers too. Because of CHB, I think FLE is very likely to drop further.
But for me, at current prices, a small initial position within a diversified
account, is okay. I hold CMH because of its parks, financing and mgmt record.
For me, if the entire sector drops further, it would be difficult to pick the
best value among the 5. If, as you point out, they move up as well, in tandem,
it might not be necessary. I assume the demand for rv's and manufactured homes
will continue. I would like to believe that what I read about mfg. housing not
being too much affected by interest rate increases (because their financing
charges are already 2-3? points higher than home mortgages) is correct.

I think you are very right in being concerned about the consolidation of mfg.
housing retail stores. One issue is whether that is a good business strategy.
The previous CEO of FLE says it is not. He is upset that FLE is going that
route. Secondly, the prices these acquisitors pay very well may be too
expensive. This (poor strategy and overpaying) may be characteristic of other
industries as well. Wayne Huizunga (spelling?) consolidating car dealerships.
Perhaps also dental firms. I'm seeing this I believe with RDO, a consolidator
or mom-n-pop ag. and construction equip. firms. Also, as you point out, the
funeral industry has grown this way, and the big funeral firms are now paying
the piper.

So I am making possibly even a worse mistake by buying Stewart Enterprises
(STEI). But here again, for me, it's a big player and the financials look good
to me at current prices. Scary though when company itself says their business
model is changing. (I'm not so concerned that they say not enough people are
dying. That should change. Except of course in California, where the beautiful
people think that death is an option. -g-) Not at all comforting though to read
this week's Barron's hedge fund manager say that STEI-- already way down to
about 6-- is shortable to about $2.

that I don't really know what's what with the company, and I can't find
anything to hold on to that I think or thought provided a margin of safety. So
I sold bunches and missed the latest rally. A couple of times recently, I've
tried to trade the stock, and that has not worked out well. I do believe that
there are some stocks that no matter what one does or when, the fates are
against you. And I've found IDTC to be one such stock for me. Plus, I know it's
really very dangerous to get sucked into the enthusiasm of a particular

temptations. And to consider Vegas, the dice tables, more carefully as an

My opinion is that if it's a war - a toy business and business model war - then
I bet on the power and brains of 70,000 people versus 3 or 4 hundred. And for
each 4000 shares of TOY, there's a person somewhere doing something - stocking,
ringing up sales, solving customer problems. You get one different person,
maybe a super peson at ETYS--- but for each 370,000 shares. Maybe it is a whole
new paradigm and 300 people are the better of 70,000. Some risks too. If
there's a big earthquake in Los Angeles or the Flu hits Southern California--
any of those 300 employees could be very much missed by the stockholders. As
etoys builds out, they are going to have to invest in more employees or more
contracts or more outsourcing. More expense cutting into possible profits. As
TOY counteracts, they have the ability to reduce, consolidate, transfer, or
shift jobs and people. They have an ability to reduce labor expense and
increase profits.

destination for kids. If your kids can keep hounding you to take them, TOY
should be able to get some of your toy dollars.

And do you know about the great strategy for parents regarding THE most popular
Christmas toys? It's very okay for the toy companies to be out of THE item and
promise a raincheck for after Christmas. Because the toy companies know you'll
buy something for the kids at Christmas anyway and maybe promise the kids THE
toy later, and maybe hope they forget about it. But they won't (especially as
THE toy will continue to be advertised), and you will be hounded and you will
buy. So you will buy two toys. If they can just stimulate demand and withhold

Bob, yes there surely is some disagreement about the benefits or pitfalls for
vertical integration (selling retail) for these mfg. home builders. Regarding
FLE in particular, we have these concerns: retail not being a high-return
business, retail being over stimulated by manufacturers wanting to increase
market share, FLE retail purchases (16) diminishing FLE cash, belief by some
FLE managers that retail is not FLE's business. Offsetting arguments are FLE
concern they have to meet competitors' push for shelf space.(CHB took away
FLE's no. 1 market share spot.) Plus FLE does have a history of exiting
business that just don't work out (FLE Credit).

This will all take time to resolve itself. Like possibly years. Meanwhile if I
can have patience to wait, and can collect my 3.4% dividend... sometime in the
next few years, I've got a shot at seeing FLE double in price. And I'm also
confident - although not necessary more correct or correct at all-g- with
Clayton Homes at current price.

Jeffrey:

I have followed midway for quite some time, got out on a bump after having
bought low. This is one I would wait until it was selling for below assets. (ex
any intangibles)

I am unimpressed with there game offerings. They seem to have lost something
after release of MK (imo). None of my kids have ever expressed interest in any
of their games.

There operating results continue to deteriorate & as far as a buyout, although
odder things have happened, I wouldnt count on it without a hit game in the
works. Someone needs to revisit the fundamentals and explain how this still
ends up on the value investing thread. At one time yes, but the operating
picture for this company appears to have changed over the past several quarters
& I have as of yet to see mgmts responce to it.

Re: Midway & video games vs. interactive net games

I wonder whether solo or 2-player video games are becoming passe, given the
success of interactive games over the internet like Everquest, distributed by
Sony. Amazingly, Everquest players are indeed very happy to pay $25 or so to
buy the game itself, then $10 per month to play the online version with other
players. Contrast that with a game that can be "solved" (ie., just read a cheat
sheet and you know when to click which button, etc.).

This lead me to do a text search for "Everquest" and I came up with this
interesting article someone kindly posted. It makes for very interesting
reading. I think the final conclusion at the end of the article will make the
value investors on this thread smile :-)
