MPW - me too. Adding more now. At current price, I'll step up: The distribution
yield is now over 8%. Cut last year, I assume it's reasonably safe now. Cash
from stock issuance, gives a little reassurance.

Company can make quite a bit of profit on each dollar of revenue. Otoh, it
takes so much capital (hospital facilities) to get that revenue, that roe is
terrible. I generally will avoid companies like this. With MPW, the dividend
attracts. And with community hospitals, and ownership of medical facilities
surrounding some hospitals, there's a bit of a moat with these.

Hi Madharry -

Good price on MDW. I got my two orders filled for $9.85.

Regarding your Gulf Resources, Inc. (GFRE) stock. The company continues to grow
it's earnings, is located in a huge growth market (China) and according to the
new book I am reading (Warren Buffet and the Interpretation if Financial
Statements - The Search for the Company with a Durable Competitive Advantage) (
http://books.google.com/books?id=7iqO6rGdrAYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Warren+Buf

=result&resnum=2&ved=0CA4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false ), qualifies as having a
significant competitive advantage over it's peers. As a result, Buffet would
see this company as a very long term keeper and you should look forward to a
multi bagger. Their bromine product used in the water purification process is a
highly needed "value added" chemical especially for the geographical region
they sell to.

==============================================================

Here is the MEDICAL PROPERTIES TRUST INC - FORM 8-K - April 12, 2010 that
discloses the three additional properties they have under contract. Everything
I have read says that management is quite good in building their book of
properties and is quick to take action when a problem arises.

From the report:"...On April 5, 2010, we entered into a non-binding letter of
intent to acquire three healthcare properties from a single seller for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $74 million. The properties were
constructed in 2008 and are presently leased to an operator of inpatient
rehabilitation hospitals with whom we do not currently have a relationship. The
transaction is subject to the completion of satisfactory due diligence, the
execution of definitive documentation and customary closing conditions. We
cannot assure you that we will successfully complete these acquisitions, in
whole or in part...".

They do have one loan outstanding which is impaired but it appears to be backed
by enough collateral so they should not get hurt too much if it goes sour.
From the Form 8-K report dated April 12, 2010
"...Since approximately January 2007, we have made loans to the operator of our
Monroe Hospital to partially fund the costs of operations. We have also accrued
rent and interest on the loan, including $7.2 million in 2009. The operator has
not made certain lease and loan payments required by the terms of the
agreements and the loan is therefore considered impaired. As of December 31,
2009, we had accrued $12.6 million in interest, rent, and other receivables and
had loaned the operator approximately $27.0 million, which includes $2.2
million of working capital advances we made in the third and fourth quarters of
2009. <u>These receivables are collateralized by $3.8 million in cash that we
possess, a first lien security interest in patient accounts receivable, and
100% of the equity of the operator.</u> We continue to consider alternatives
for our investment in Monroe Hospital, some of which may result in the further
impairment of our loan should we elect to pursue them. It is possible that we
will not be able to recover our full investment and that a future impact on
earnings of between $0 and $15 million may be required. If we elect to
terminate the existing lease, we would be required to separately write off
accrued straight-line rent which at December 31, 2009 was approximately $2.5
million.

When management discovered that the Hospital was on shacky ground in 2007, they
fired the manageing CEO Dean Melton. At that point Melton was replaced by Mike
Soisson of Vibra Healthcare. Vibra Healthcare was an investor in the property.
At the same time, a new loan from Medical Properties Trust was secured for the
continuing operation of the facility (see form 8-K above).

Monroe Hospital is qualified as a medicare reimbursement facility so all the
patient receivables due are government guaranteed.

re GFRE - I am skimming thought the last 10k. It seems that 80% of their
profits come from the bromide production. on thing I noticed it that despite
the claim that demand is higher than th current production output, their
price/ton is down 15% YoY from 14.500 RMB to ~12.800RMB. Also their revenues
for the bromide business were only up 17% YOY, the assets related to this
business were up 69%. So it seems like their ROI si sinking quite rapidly or it
may be that the Capex they put in place is yet to generate more incremental
income.

It seems to me that their business strategy is to be a rollup for underutilized
or non-producing bromide wells in thier geographic area. I think I'll pass on
that one too - it's hard with so many moving parts to determine the real like
for like numbers and too easy for the Chinese management to fudge them and do a

thanks for your comments on gfre they force me to dig deeper. a previous post i

also gfre latest plant shows that they got higher pricing on bromine.

re the possibility for fudging that always exists but I like a company where
management owns a big stake close to 40% and are trying to expand and move up
the value change. not to mention the moat of being one of a handful of legal
operators in china.

As far as your comment about the assets increasing faster than revenues from
this you can see the lag in asset utilization:

"Net Revenue Net revenue was $110,276,908 in fiscal year 2009, an increase of
$22,788,574 (or approximately 26%) as compared to fiscal year 2008. This
increase was primarily attributable to the growth in our bromine and crude salt
segment with revenue increasing from $63,664,156 for fiscal year 2008 to
$74,330,586 for fiscal year 2009, an increase of approximately 17%; and in our
sales of chemical products, which increased from $ 23,824,178 for fiscal year
2008 to $35,946,322 for fiscal year 2009, an increase of approximately 51%. The
increase in the net sales of bromine and crude salt was primarily due to the
net effect of i) the increase in sales volume arising from the increase in
production capacity after the asset acquisitions made in January of 2009 and in
September of 2009, which are now in full operation and ii) the decrease in
average selling price of both bromine and crude salt. As the demand for bromine
always exceeded the supply available, the increase in production of the Company
contributed to the increase in sales in the current year. Among the total
increase of net sales, $7,145,507 was due to the asset acquisitions. The
increase in the sales of our chemical products was due to the introduction of
new environmental friendly additive products which was in operation since
September 2008, solid lubricant and polyether lubricant, for use in oil and gas
exploration in fourth quarter of 2009, and improvement of our pesticide
intermediate products. "

Have they given a production estimate (in tonnes) for bromide production? That
could gives us an idea if the new Capex and the acquired bromide properties are
are going to generate a reasonable ROI.

Their profit margins on bromide are very high, so understanding what is going

They are making no claims as to their ability to predict long term pricing or

seeing. I am skeptical of anyone who is confident about their ability to
predict the price of any commodity. I think all we can say is that management
seems to be doing the right things and there is a moat as far as competition
goes. Clearly what happens with the global economy will have a huge impact on
demand for bromine world wide. But what i see as around 8-9 times next year
earnings this is a good company at a cheap price, with aggresive management who
own a big piece of the company.

ATPG still among my favorite oil stocks, and one of my largest individual
positions. I'm still adding, albeit very small amounts right now. I may add
even more.

I am still researching how I want to or should value e&p companies. I'm looking
for a number, something to calculate that's quick, easy, consistent - something
I can use for a screen and something that sets up a bar -- above the number,
it's a value; below the number it's a pass. I've got information on how
acquirers use reported data to analyze value. There are three aspects I don't
understand or am not comfortable with: valuing flowing mmboe, valuing
undeveloped land, valuing oil and valuing gas.

What I AM using now is NAV. It's a number that's based on somebody's opinion
(an independent company's independent analyst, presumably) on what proved and
probable reserves are. This number changes every year -- for gas stocks, it may
be going up with new drilling techniques (horizontal drilling), and it changes
depending on prices and estimates of oil vs. gas (vs. condensates?). And by
whose rules apply: gov't saying use average prices during year vs. prices last
day of year.

Apparently, my issues or lack of comprehension aside, NAV is a standard measure
that some analysts do like. What surprises me is that in reviewing couple dozen
e&p companies, maybe only a majority of them provide nav numbers; and fewer
talk about it as a key metric. Perhaps it's like insurance companies, where not
all managers talk about book value as being a key metric for them. Whereas in
their sector, book value performance is key for me, and for many pro value
investors.

Anyway, I don't know that the companies that do report nav, report it on the
same basis. So that comparisons across companies may or may not be valid. The
"standard" number I'm using is something called "2p npv 10". (aside: or labeled
differently, but the same numerical result) And where I can find that number
for a company, I'm putting the number over the company's enterprise value.
Where that ratio exceeds 1, I'm saying the company's nav exceeds its stock
value and as a consequence, the stock is a buy. Rightly or wrongly. And
wherever I find such companies, I am a buyer. I have mentioned several here
previously that I've bought. They are dink companies generally, and my bets are
small.

Because ATPG is both a decent size (imo) e&p company and has such a large $nav
number to enterprise $value number --- the largest ratio I've found-- and
because ATPG is moving to mostly or more to oil vs, gas (and I like oil for
demand/supply pricing vs. nat gas which may be in glut), and because there's so
much hoopla about ATPG's bringing up oil - transformational amounts of it
compared to ATPG's size and previous production - from new oil operations
(rigs) - I've made a significant (for me) bet on ATPG.

Hello Paul,

I agree with you regarding using NAV analysis to at least initially screen E&P
companies. If NAV is greater than EV, there's at least a potential value stock.

In theory, if NAV is greater than EV, the projections by analysts of eps, cash
flows, and p/e should also make sense from a valuation perspective. So, the way
that I'm looking at things, I'm looking at NAV first and then seeing the other
projections to make sure the story seems reasonable. It does with ATPG, but I'm
having a harder time finding such favorable ratios and valuations with other
E&P's out there. I see slight discounts, but not enough for me to take the
plunge.

As you mentioned, I too don't really look at valuations based on mmboe,
undeveloped land, or total oil and gas as main screening tools for stocks
because I'm more comfortable with a NAV approach. But that being said, I do
think that looking at recent acquisition values (lots of e&p acquisitions these
days) based on these metrics and comparing them to ATPG has still made the
stock look favorable. I think that if I were in another oil company, I would
tend to use these metrics as check figures to make sure again that the overall
undervaluation seems reasonable.

Thanks,

re NAV of E&P

>>As you mentioned, I too don't really look at valuations based on mmboe,
undeveloped land, or total oil and gas as main screening tools for stocks
because I'm more comfortable with a NAV approach<<

the problem with NAV is that management has a lot if discretion to determine
what NAV is. Most firms put a value on undeveloped properties which may or may
not be viable. Also be careful to subtract the going tax rates when the NAV is
given as a pre-tax value (in some cases it is not clear which taxes are
included in pre-tax values (royalty taxes etc.). The proven reserve number
which enables you to determine $/BOE number is from the 10k and determined from
an independent company , so there is a lot less opportunity for fudging.

%BOM---------------------

If found it's somewhat as you say. With nav, if it's even stated, some
companies use an after-tax number, some a pre-tax number (e.g. ATPG). Also,
some of these e&p companies only accrue taxes, if that, and don't pay taxes, so
I wonder what after-tax nav really means there.

Regarding mmboe and $/boe, there are several factors with the number provided
by the company. First, in my looking around, the most concrete number and one
frequently provided, is $/boe produced, or some equivalent. And those dollars
received are often from oil that's hedged, and so in future $/boe can change
very abruptly after the contracted prices expire (and if production expands or
contracts). Secondly, there's produced mmboe, proven mmboe, proven+probable
mmboe, proven+probable+possible mmboe. Somehow, all that should somehow be
considered in a nav calculation.

I am currently researching if I can determine a factor - a constant dollar
amount - to attach to each 1mmboe produced by a company. If I were to multiply
that number by the number of mmboe's produced, and if that resulting dollar
value is greater than enterprise value, I wonder if I can have a bogey that
just might be good enough for screening purposes to determine the
instantaneous, point-in-time of the value of the company vs. its stock price.

Hi Paul -
RE: E&P company valuation

The only other factor which might differentiate one company from another is the
company's cost of producing one barrel of oil (or equivalent unit of NG). This
would include their average cost per acre under production to extract and
process the oil for distribution. There might be some really cost efficient
producers (those using vertical drilling technology, modern gathering systems
and the newest capital equipment) that are getting screened out from your
simple value analysis.

Different producers have significantly different costs for extracting their
resource and making it deliverable to the market. In the long run the low cost
efficient producer should demand the highest value.

My Dad did a similar analysis 25 years ago with many of the small to medium
size gold mining companies. I still own several which were eventually bought by
BHP (received BHP stock). He arrived at an average cost to produce 1oz of gold
from each of the specific mines he reviewed. The production costs (by mine)
were available in the annual reports which allowed him to identify the low cost
producers. He charted the average extraction cost to market the price and
established a Buy point when the market price was x times the company's average
extraction cost. He accumulated shares over time when his buy point was
triggered. It turned out to be a quite profitable value buying system

The biggest problem in using stated reserve numbers is that these figures or
only as good as the independent engineer's review UNTIL they are adjusted! This
occurred for Royal Dutch Petroleum several years ago where out of the blue they
readjusted the value of their "proven" reserves down by $1 Billion.

I like the concept of identifying the low cost producer. Different parcels have
significantly different costs involved in producing 1 barrel of oil. By ranking
the cost to produce 1 barrel of oil by parcel(s) location by company might
allow you to create a top ten list of the low cost producers. I might pay a bit
more for a company that is a low cost producer (or owns parcels where it is
cheaper to extract the oil) than for one that is a higher cost producer but may
have larger proven reserves.

Paul, the $/BOE number is available with the annual report and for most
companies it is filed on 12/31/2010 so the underlying price assumption would be
the same. This does not replace NAV valuation but is an easy way to compare
similar companies and a way to tell if NAV values are out of whack.

I also like to look at finding cost. Some companies publish these numbers but
again it is unclear how these values compare. So one can look at the DDE in
$/BOE to get a feel what the historical finding cost really was. The DDE cost
is nothing else than the depreciation of the capitalized value of the producing
properties. Of course the historical cost may be different than what the
present finding cost. However I found that some companies like XOM and EOG tend
to beat their competitors in that metric. This means nothing else than they are
very efficient in finding oil or gas.

There's enough correlation between the number of analysts following a stock, vs
pricing inefficiency/efficiency measures, that it's a bet that the more
analysts = the more efficient the stock price?

Enron was a stock that confirmed for me that that is a dangerous bet.

enron was an unrecognized fraud by most although chanos picked upon it, I guess
most analysts refused to the consider the possibility of fraud, and the banks
complicity in this was not pursued criminally by the sec as i think it should
have been so history repeats. if weve learned anything at all, it's caveat

Analysts vs stock efficiency,

I agree with Madharry that I think there is more opportunity/inefficiency in
stocks covered by fewer analysts (or not covered at all). In the later case,
you may be one of the few people have done homework on the stock. Every once in
awhile, I am in a situation where I think I know about as much about the
company as anyone else who is not in the company or a related party. That
doesn't mean I always get it right, but my odds are usually better (IMO).

That being said, it doesn't make it impossible for the analysts to get it wrong
or that there are no opportunities in stocks covered by analysts. In the case
of ATPG, it appears to be a high risk/high reward stock, so it could generate a
high return despite analyst coverage because it is perceived as a high risk
stock.

Looking for, not finding my copy of interview with Bill Miller wherein he says,
essentially, the number of analysts who actually follow the companies they are
assigned to is small. Most/many analysts follow the lead of one or two other
analysts on a particular stock.
So that in effect, if one assumes a large cap stock is well-covered from all
aspects because many analysts are assigned to it and delve into it, that is not
the case.

ValueAmigo. Most of these stocks have been mentioned here before, some many
times.

My comments:

SEB. I have a position. Tough year for those guys, according to their annual
report. Maybe at 1250 - just an arbitrary point - I might add more.

ATPG. It doesn't "need a pullback" imo.

VOD. I'm considering. Have traded VZ. Like VOD better for a value proposition
because of the VOD-VZ relationship & VOD being wireless.

CNO. Haven't looked at it in a while.
KCLI. ditto. Likely will pass. Have enough of these type insurers already.

NE. I like it. High roe, low p/e. I hold a position.

NWLI. Have held a position for many years. Just going through annual report
now. Also holding ANAT which is also run by the Moody family. NWLI alwayslooks
like an undervalued insurer imo, because it always trades under stated book
value. OTOH, however, stated book value increases most years, and I do expect
stock to rise commensurately.

AOI. I figured as long as I'm holding several tobacco stocks, I might as well
hold aoi too. In since '05, I occasionally trim position. Likely will exit if
stock gets above $6 again. Seth Klarman's buys are inexplicable to me
generally.

Shipping stocks. I'm a buyer (adding to a small position) of SBLK around
current price. While their fleet is on time-charter, some of the charters seem
like they might be renewed at lower prices. I need to study this one and the
sector a little closer before I commit more money to this one.

I've mentioned NM many times. My favorite. I'm not buying more at current price
though. Also I like TOO. Seems like its ships, which deal with off-shore
oil/gas companies, should be in demand as off-shore exploration is emphasized
more. A limited partnership setup, the distribution at 9% if attractive. (It
was higher though when the stock was lower.) I'll continue building a position
if stock will drop a bit on no adverse news.

when they're values. I'm currently using enterprise value to nav. Nav, we've
had some discussions of what that number could or should best entail. On proved
and probable reserves after tax, there's a number that's often published for
these companies. ATPG has the highest such nav/enterprise value of any company
that I've come across. That's one reason I like it. Also, ATPG isn't exactly an
e&p company in that it doesn't really explore ('e') as do typical e&p
companies. It buys positions that already have been explored and produces from
them. For this reason and because there's a large oil component in addition to
gas component with ATPG, I also like the stock.

Would you buy Viterra under the buy the whole company scenario with your

As for Joe I think like all the stocks berkowitz owns he is getting a ride off
of other investors following his picks now similar to the past with B Miller

you can get better leverage in the sector than mdc. Kind of like buying the

Viterra-- annual report
The benefits have translated into
significant growth in market capitalization, which, since
January 2005, has increased from approximately $80 million
to nearly $4 billion today, (Have sharehiolders made 50 times their investment?
I doubt it with many acquisitions using stock)

In fiscal 2009, our consolidated sales and other operating
revenues reached $6.6 billion, which compared to $6.8 billion in 2008

Net earnings were $113.1 million for 2009, or $0.45 per share
compared to $288.3 million or $1.31 per share in 2008. Cash
flow from operations remained strong at $223.4 million, while
free cash flow (prior to working capital changes and after
capital expenditures) was $148.1 million.

We executed our transaction with ABB and, as promised,
retained a very strong balance sheet. The total value of this
transaction was $1.4 billion, achieved through an offering to
ABB shareholders of a combination of equity and cash, in which
ABB shareholders elected the maximum share consideration.
The transaction was completed on September 23, 2009. At
October 31, 2009, our total debt-to-capital ratio was 31%, and
we had over $1 billion of cash and short-term investments on
the balance sheet.

Our investment guidelines and profile are clear: we strive for
profitable growth by investing to earn more than our cost of
capital. We intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet with
a debt-to-capital ratio of between 30% and 40%.

Yeah, Loews (L) is one to consider.

I've liked some of the companies in their portfolio better than L itself. So
I'm holding DO (added more shares recently), SUR (a subsidiary of CNA), and
BWP, which I might add to around current price ($29+)

I generally hold at least 200 positions.

I try to control risk by position size. Since I'm not so knowledgeable or
comfortable with VTRAF yet, my position size is small. I'm looking at it for a
long-term hold - at least several years - so as I get more familiar with
company and if company produces results as expected, and if stock price doesn't
seem out of line with that, I'd be a likely buyer of more shares.

"My basic idea is why compete against the professionals when you can compete

your not really competeing, unless of course you see it that way. The
professionals, as you call them provide basic financials as they see them and
trends as they see them. Then they extrapolate some kind of opinion based on
whatever they think is important. What does that have to do with you?

When you discover and idea or stock and develope some kind of criteria, do you
think its a new idea never thought about? By looking at widely followed
companies you can see how much of "your " idea is actually consenses (and
therefor priced in) or contrary (higher risk reward criteria).

Underfollowed companies leave you more in the dark about the current "value" of
the company and therefore demand a higher risk/reward evaluation. IOW just
because its not followed well doesnt mean your idea isnt completely priced in.
You just dont know it.

What ive found that the individual has over the professional is time. They need
to be right, now, as they are judged quarterly/annually where as you have time
for your supposition to play out. So if you in early (a contrarian) you can
watch the timeliness of your idea unfold as people that need to be right, now,
fall in line. The more analysts, the more you know where YOU stand. Sorry to

I don't feel like I have any competitive advantage in large cap stocks. I own

risk/ reward goes hand in hand. less coverage may mean more risk. The idea that
you feel youve made out just means expected return versus the risk you took is
ok. So who were you competing with?

"but I don't pretend that my largecap picks will do any better than the overall

If your expected return = the market, why not just own the market instead of
"value equities"?

over the company, and Munger once commented that because of the volatility
investors have the opportunity to make far greater returns than they would in
bond funds. NSRGY has lots of fans outthere although ive never owned it. Im

Hello Paul,

I've seen in various posts from you throughout the years that you tend to like
Insurance company valuations if they have a price/book < 1.

How do you take into account earnings of a company? Say, for example, you have
two insurance companies. Both have a book value of $1 billion, but one had a
book value of $2 billion 5 years ago, and the other had a book value of $0.5
billion 5 years ago. So, one has been earning money and growing book value,
while the other has been losing money.

Looking primarily at book value, if they were both priced at a $1 billion
market cap, would they both be reasonably valued?

Or, say that you had two companies at a $1 Billion market cap with $1 Billion
book value, one had a p/e of 8 and the other had a p/e of 20?

I guess my overall question is, shouldn't earnings be a large part of the
valuation of any company, including an insurance company?

Thank you,

cw

The sale should help them maintain their high dividend (6.4%) by reducing their

The loss to be recognized in the second quarter of 2010 could exceed this range
because unrealized losses on certain contracts will be required to be recorded
during the quarter. PHI currently estimates that these unrealized losses will
be offset over the next twelve months by gains from the liquidation of load
service supply contracts.

cwillyg. Yes, earnings. Per Dr. Graham, we don't want to see losses.

For insurance companies I tend to look at the balance sheet numbers before I
look at the earnings statement. I'd look at market cap as well as p/e and bv
for the insurance companies.

I'm looking for growing bv, so declining is a big negative for me. OTOH, we
have '08 or '09 where so many insurance companies reported declining bv and/or
earnings losses or high p/e's. I view that as an anomaly -- when I've had
courage to see things in that light.

Consider a company like Allstate last year. Sharply declining book value, price
below stated bv, earnings cratered. Likely - in retrospect anyway, or if
somebody had courage to believe in its business model, size, market presence,
etc. - that company would recover.

"...shouldn't earnings be a large part of the valuation of any company..."
Some companies are a value because of their assets vs. stock price, regardless
if they're if they're profitable now or haven't been for past years. My belief
anyway. Example might be JOE for land values. Some cash-rich net-nets.
Insurance companies though, they should be making money on their book and
float. So earnings - relatively low p/e - should usually be a criterion for a
buy decision.

Yeah DEO. Buffett stock. Time to buy was last year; seems fairly valued now. I
generally don't follow it. Have a few shares though, stub position, set&forget.

None of the beverage companies I'm seeing appear to me attractive enough to buy
now. Maybe Pargesa with its holding of Pernod Ricard. Otoh, PRGAF mostly trades
below the value of its holdings and doesn't have much growth over the past few
years, so maybe it's a value trap.

Thanks, Paul.

I see where you're coming from.

My specific struggle is that I'm trying to get to a reasonable valuation of a
non-traded insurance company that is, per my view, trading close to a 2
price/book but at a p/e of 7 or 8 based on stable historical earnings. I feel
like maybe those two equal and opposite indicators tell me that it's maybe
fairly valued now.

These insurance company valuations are a bit tricky. And even as a CPA, I have
some trouble really analyzing financial statements of insurance companies.

Thanks,

AMPH, I just took small position in this malpractice insurer. Nicely steady
business with low PE and low P/BV(just over 1). 15% ROE. Insider buying near or
above this price. Solid balance sheet and cash. Capital backing for future
losses is at top end of industry standard (I guess you could take this a few
ways). Earnings release coming in a few weeks.

AMPH - From Zacks
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/American-Physicians-zacks-2655405311.html?x=0&.v=

The insurance unit continues to experience increased pricing competition from
both new entrants and existing competitors in the Texas market. Though rate
declines have moderated recently, we think that the increased competition will
somehow restrict significant improvement in rates in the upcoming quarters.

Hence, we believe that the positive and the negative factors for the stock have
balanced each other and there exists no significant catalyst for a substantial
share price movement in either direction.

Cwillyg, I don't know about your specific company (p/bk of 2, p/e 7-8), but
looking through my insurance company positions, I've got a goodly number that
trade below 1.2x stated bv and under 8x, where the company also seems to have
profits each year, stable - if not growing. Just catching my eye, here are SUR,
TRH, ACE, AFG, ESGR. My preference of course has been to buy a package of these
companies.

Regarding financial accounting, here's something I ran across from ANAT's
annual report, something that surprised me:

"American National recorded $98.9 Million of other than temporary impairments
during 2009, primarily due to stock valuations in the first quarter. However,
many of the securities impaired in 2008 and early 2009 rebounded to show
unrealized gains at the end of 2009. Due to accounting rules, these gains are
not allowed to be reflected in income until the instruments are disposed of."

"a competitive advantage to who?"
To the other buyers of large cap stock (i.e., the market)

"risk/ reward goes hand in hand. less coverage may mean more risk. The idea
that you feel youve made out just means expected return versus the risk you
took is ok. So who were you competing with?"

Less coverage means more uncertainty (lack of information). I think investors
are rewarded by taking uncertainty risk). Less coverage also tends to correlate
with less trading liquidity, which is a risk. I feel I am amply rewarded by
taking those risks, although being stuck in 2008 in some "roach motel" stocks,
I do appreciate the risk more than I did.

"If your expected return = the market, why not just own the market instead of
"value equities"?"

For largecap stocks, I prefer value to the general market, but sure I could
just buy a value fund and it would probably do just well for that portion of my
portfolio, except with investing myself I don't have to pay the management
fees.

"Good ideas are good ideas whether followed by 100 analysts or none. Analysts
really cant compete with your time horizon. Think how much money youd make,
even versus your high risk stuff, if 100 analyst disagreed with you and you
were right?"

Ahhh, but I have more good ideas in microcap stocks. There are more valuation
discrepancies in those. That is the very point of mine that you are missing.

Paul,

With ANAT, sounds like reasonable accounting to me but a conservative approach
taken regarding asset valuation. Since they said the impairments weren't
temporary, they shouldn't be allowed to reverse that impairment until sale.
Now, whether they should have concluded the impairments were temporary or
permanent is another story. But permanent impairment is certainly more
conservative.

AMPH - "Their current share price is just stupid."

That might be a red flag by Michael Burry's standards. He advocated selling on
new lows because he deemed it irrational selling. If the price of AMPH is
'stupid', then it might be irrational selling. I guess you have to figure out
when the insanity stops and get in at the right time. Personally, if I relied
on proper timing I'd be absolutely broke.

Anyways, i think i'll take a little AMPH

For value investors, I don't see the point in mimicking what is considered to
be irrational behavior. That's a momentum chaser's game.

I have watched AMPH for several years and have no problem with how they do
business. Just one of those cases where the market doesn't get it.

I'm not sure it's "mimicking" irrational behavior as much as taking a time-out
until the market comes to its senses. If a value stock shows strong irrational
downward momentum, I think it's perfectly rational for a value investor to get
out.

If I'm in a nice bar when a brawl breaks out, I don't mind stepping outside
until the brawl is over. There's no sense in risking a Shiner Bock to the head.
Hell, there might even be another nice bar across the street with cheaper
Shiner - and no brawl.

I think the key here is strong irrational downward momentum. I completely agree
value investors shouldn't chase momentum. I certainly don't make it a practice.
However, I don't think we should ignore it completely.

Regards,
Dr.I
