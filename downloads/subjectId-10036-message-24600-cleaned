Analyst upgrade boosts WCI Communities
By John Spence, MarketWatch

BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- WCI Communities Inc. led home-builder stocks higher
Tuesday, gaining ground after a brokerage upgraded the company's stock from
market underperform to outperform based on valuation.

Last week, shares of Bonita Springs, Fla.-based WCI fell sharply after the
builder of luxury homes and towers in Florida posted a 70% drop in its
quarterly profit and also lowered its 2006 earnings outlook.

"It appears speculative demand has disappeared, real buyers are 'on hold,' and
people in backlog continue to cancel homes, believing it is better to lose
their deposit than close on a unit and incur indefinite carrying costs,"
analyst Alex Barron of JMP Securities wrote.

"We do not believe these conditions are likely to change anytime soon given the
sharp rise in the number of resale listings in the Florida market," Barron
wrote. The analyst also expects the default rate on WCI's towers to increase
now that it has lowered deposit requirements on new sales from about 20% to
10%.

Yet the upgrade is based on valuation -- the stock was down 48% in the year to
date through Monday's close -- with many investors apparently betting the
company will go into bankruptcy. Barron noted WCI has put in place several
initiatives, "such as dramatically lowering the number of new towers it
launches, and implementing cost-cutting measures, which may imply some degree
of earnings loss in the next few years but should ensure solvency, assuming the
level of defaults remains manageable, in our view, below 50%."

Shares of WCI gained 93 cents, or 6.7%, to finish trading at $14.80.

WCI in June also increased its unsecured revolving-credit facility to $900
million with an "accordion" feature permitting increases up to $1.5 billion.

"We believe this borrowing capacity should be sufficient to weather a severe
downturn in its condo business, such as the one we envision," JMP said.

Along with the ratings upgrade, JMP cut its 2006 earnings estimate for WCI to
$2.40 a share, down from $3.40 a share previously, on lower units and margins.
JMP also lowered its 2007 forecast to a loss of 75 cents a share from profit of
$1 a share.

"We will continue to monitor the level of resale listing and believe the number
of defaults will be the key metric to watch over the next few quarters," Barron
said.

Builder confidence plummets

The home-builder stocks got a lift on Tuesday from Wall Street's somewhat eased
inflation fears, even after an industry survey showed confidence in August fell
to the lowest level in 15 years.

August was the seventh straight month of deteriorating builder confidence, the
National Association of Home Builders reported.

"Two factors are coloring builders' perceptions of the market right now --
rising sales cancellations and substantial growth in inventories of both new
and existing homes," said David Seiders, chief economist for the industry
group.

"These factors are largely the result of an increasing number of potential
buyers adopting a 'wait and see' attitude because of uncertainty about where
the housing market is headed," Seiders said.

Additionally, speculators are exiting markets, which is compounding the
inventory upsurge, he added. See Economic Report.

So far in 2006 through Monday, the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index was
off about 38%.

WCI -The research report that you are referencing is a pretty generic Reuters

into this report you will that WCI free cash flow has been negative as far as
the eye can see. I don't have a position in homebuilders right now, but WCI
looks like one of the worst choices to go long in this universe.

Don't mean to sound pretentious but if the Clearstation link represents the

The thing with blood in the street is that you want to bet on those that have

There is nothing wrong with the concept of blood in the streets, but there is
nothing to indicate that builders and such shares have bottomed. Not only that
but such builders are usually highly leveraged in terms of deposits being
cancelled, building on spec, and then having to compete to sell their
properties with investors who want out at any cost, foreclosure sales and the
like.

As far as blood in the streets goes - I have Dell and SIL and others, which are
relatively unleveraged and are not caught up in asset bubbles. At least I see a
catalyst for upturns. Not sure what the catalyst is for an upturn in some of
the builders. Where are the buyers going to mysteriously appear from? Now that
adjustable rates have soared , and credit standards if anything are bing
tightened, I just see a lot of pain going forward. Even wealthier people who
have adjustable home equity loans are complaining to me about how much more its
costing them now. The time to buy homebuilders and the like will be when some
of them announce restructuring of debt, bankruptcy and the like. I dont know if
you were investing during the asian collapse in the late 90s but at the time
private investors were snapping up condos in major cities in asia for about
15-20% of original pricing from financially strapped builders. That is blood in
the streets.

You can't compare oranges with apples. The financial condition in the United

Madharry,

What catalyst do you see for Dell? Certainly the company has a pristine balance
sheet. The strongest segment for PCs is laptop growth in Asia and Dell
currently holds a third place position in market share with about 10% of the
market. Furthermore, there is plenty of competition from Lenovo, Acer, etc. 07
estimates for Dell are all over the place, so it looks likes the market is
really unsettled about its prospects going forward.

From my experience, most sectors bottom from a benign indifference after
investors have accepted their market losses. I like to see a decrease in short
interest and some insider buying. Maybe even a 13-D filed. None of these are
evident to this point. Furthermore, with tax loss selling expected to continue
into the end of the year, I don't see a recovery in WCI for 06.

Naturally, your blogger will now take a look at one aspect of the collateral
behind housing agency notes (and by extension asset backed debt). I will go
into the trends in foreclosures and delinquencies Thursday, but today's focus
is on land values. Land is an important component of housing collateral and
valuation, especially in Bubble locales. As homebuilders have reported for the
last quarter, we see a number of them doing substantial land inventory
writeoffs: DL Horton, $57 million, Pulte $62 million, NVR, $26 million, Centex,
$23 million, Lennar $22 million. If Riskloves have any notion whatsoever about
the land portion of their mortgage backed collateral, then maybe they missed
DL. Horton's Don Tomnitz's frank comments:

"June absolutely fell off the Richter scale for us." Twenty-nine percent of
Horton buyers walked away without closing their deals in the quarter, the
highest bust-out rate in company history. Horton responded by canceling option
contracts for more land, eating the earnest money and other fees. It took a $57
million write-off in the quarter, primarily because of the land deals. Profits
will be squeezed, because Horton will have to give more incentives to move
homes; it expects to cancel more land contracts; and its average home price is
falling. Now the company is demanding some relief from suppliers and
subcontractors. Division presidents are pushing land sellers, who had agreed to
an option price, to reduce it. "It doesn't make any difference whether we're
short [of] land in that market or not," he said. "We're basically using the
excuse that the market is softer across the U.S. ... Across the board, we're
asking for decreases in our land prices." The company is getting some
discounts, just not as deep as they need to be, Tomnitz says. Some land sellers
are still in denial, and he wants the big write-off to send a message: "The
first loss is the best loss, and we're going to walk away if we can't get the
land price correct," Tomnitz said. Horton had 396,000 home lots, 43 percent of
them secured through options. It plans to reduce that to 340,000 and get a
50-50 mix of lots owned and optioned.

Apparently one of the nations largest banks, Bankamerica has figured this one
out now too, even if Riskloves haven't.

There will be a slowdown," said Eugene Godbold, president of commercial real
estate lending at Bank of America, speaking of both residential and commercial
real estate. "The question nobody knows the answer to is how far will it dip
and how long will it last." BofA's commercial real estate division specializes
in loans to professional developers of income-producing real estate, including
retail, office, industrial and multifamily properties. Godbold said at the
webcast conference. "We're watching residential builders very closely in those
areas," he said. Capitalization rates, which measure how fast a real estate
investment pays itself off through the income the asset generates, remain at an
all-time low. But "this doesn't make sense mathematically," Godbold said.
"They're going to have to go up" as energy and insurance costs on real estate
properties have soared. The BofA executive said his division began taking
defensive measures such as cutting back on its land advances to developers and
keeping tight debt-to-cover ratios. The debt coverage ratio measures the
ability of an income-producing property to cover monthly mortgage payments.

Hi Jurgis - My Home Depot got assigned to me today so I hope it hit bottom like
TLB. TLB has some excellent real estate assets and they seem to be making the
J. Jill purchase work. If you caught TLB near it's bottom at $17 then you
netted close to 6 points or almost 35% in two months. That's a very good return
and to take some profits now is a good idea.

Many times I tend to hold on too long looking for a much better long term
return. My new strategy is to take enough profits on an over sold pop that
provides me my 10% return per year. I will let the rest ride or hedge by
writing a covered call.

TLB is a good one because they pay a 2.5% dividend. You only need a 1 1/4 point
pop to lock in your 10% return. At $23.5 you already have a nice gain of 35% I
am struggling with my Comcast (CMCSA) as it continues to have a great run (up
30% since April) but I receive no dividend (therefore no booked return). In
fact I also have shares from 18 month's ago that make my average cost around
$29. I like the company long term and believe there is good value up to $41.
So, I think I will sell the $35 covered call (perhaps October) so I can at
least generate some income and book a 30% gain on a portion of my holdings if
it continues to move higher. There is nothing worse than a round trip roller
coaster ride and at the end of the day you have no booked gain to show for your
work.

I want every one of my stocks to continually to add "return" to the portfolio
or else move the money some place else that does.

EKS

FWIW SFL back up to $20 and still pays a 9% dividend. One could have backed the
truck up at $16.5 in June and locked in a 10.5% dividend.

A more interesting question is to ask for stock recommendations with 10 bagger
potential. I have been thinking about this for a while and my best bet is FLWS,
the online Florist/gift company. Last earnings report was not great due to high
marketing costs. the long shot to 10 bagger potential for FLWS is the low P/S
and the earnings leverage that goes with reducing the cost. Admittedly a long
shot, but with a little bit of luck and capable management this be able to
generate decent margins. Even though FLWS missed earnings by quite some margins
there were some positive developments under the hood that reverse the trend. I
bought some FLWS a while ago at above 6$ and today doubled my position.

re: SIL

A PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Bolivia's decision to suspend an ambitious plan to
nationalize its oil and gas industry has reinforced doubts about the ability of
its state-run energy company to manage the country's extensive gas reserves.

A statement issued Friday by Bolivia's Hydrocarbons Ministry said the "full
effect" of nationalization would be "temporarily suspended, due to the lack of
economic resources" of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Boliviano, or YPFB.

"The truth is coming out," Pietro Pitts, oil industry analyst and
editor-in-chief of the online magazine Latin Petroleum, said Sunday. "The state
oil company in Bolivia doesn't have the technical know-how, doesn't have the
capital, and doesn't have the experience to run those fields that were run for
a long time by the bigger guys."

The state-owned company has asked the Central Bank of Bolivia for $180 million
in financing needed to assume complete control of the country's production
facilities. However, Bolivian law prohibits the bank from extending credit to
public entities except in case of emergency.

In addition, the ministry announced plans to restructure and modernize the
70-year-old YPFB, which was partially privatized by former president Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada in 1997 but re-nationalized in 2004.

When President Evo Morales nationalized Bolivia's oil and gas industry May 1,
seizing the assets of international companies that had long controlled most of
Bolivia's considerable oil and gas reserves, he called for YPFB to be
restructured within 60 days as a "transparent, efficient, and socially
controlled" corporation.

Bolivian opposition leaders say Friday's announcement underscores the lack of
progress made since Morales' decree.

Nationalization was a "media show," said Fernando Messmer, leader of the
conservative party Podemos' congressional delegation. "The refineries are still
in the hands of multinational companies" and many of those firms are not yet
paying the Bolivian government the 82 percent share of revenue ordered by
Morales, he said.

Since May 1, YFPB has failed to acquire a 51 percent share in Bolivian
facilities owned by several international interests, including Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, one of the largest operators in Bolivia.

"YPFB has demonstrated that, as a business, it has nothing more than those four
letters," said Eduardo Perez, director of the La Paz-based Radio Catolica Fides
and an influential political commentator here.

Long-running negotiations between YPFB and Petrobras will continue with a
meeting set for Sept. 14 in Bolivia. At issue is the price the Brazilian
company will pay to export Bolivian natural gas.

Other foreign interests whose Bolivian operations were effected by
nationalization include the Spanish-Argentine company Repsol YPF, the French
company Total SA, and affiliates of BP PLC.

An association of Bolivian oil and gas companies announced that since May 1
more than 30 foreign and domestic petroleum businesses have ceased operations
or taken their business to other South American countries.

Should YPFB prove incapable of developing Bolivia's still largely untapped oil
and gas reserves, oil industry analyst Pitts believes foreign investment will
return to South America's poorest country, albeit cautiously.

"Before those guys come back into the picture, things are going to have to be
very, very clear," he said.

Dell's Woes:

Full Story: http://www.slate.com/id/2147952/fr/nl/

Then there's the issue of quality control and responsibility.
This has proved to be something of a lost decade for Dell.
And a chunk of its woes can be ascribed to its propensity to
avoid integration. With prices of raw materials and
transportation rising, Dell has had a difficult time
maintaining profit margins. And there are ways in
which outsourcing the down-and-dirty, low-margin production
functions can harm the high-margin intangible assets, like
your brand.

Customers have complained about the decline in service. Most
recently, Dell has had to contend with the burning laptop
phenomenon. Dell has taken pains to note that the batteries
that are being recalled were made by Sony. But customers and
investors have poured out their wrath on Dell, not Sony.
Letting somebody else do the hard work to guarantee the
quality of your components used to be a great advantage of
deintegration. But in this age of selective vertical
reintegration, it can also be a liability.

RE: DELL

The company's revenue grew just 2 percent in Japan, a key market. But sales
jumped 31 percent in China and 63 percent in India.

Dell's chairman declined to provide any outlook for the current quarter.

"I think we (Dell as a whole) got a little too aggressive in pricing strategy.
But in Asia we did see good elasticity," Dell's regional head Steve Felice told
reporters in a conference call. "In Asia, we saw very solid profitability."

Asia, which accounts for 14 percent of Dell's revenue, has been a bright spot
for the company.

"We will continue to provide competitive pricing," Felice said when asked if
Dell would lower prices in Asia still further for market share.

Felice said the company's plan to launch Dimension consumer desktop PCs with
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NYSE:AMD - News) microprocessors could have a
"profound impact" on growth in China.

"Customers asked us to expand the product line to include AMD, and the
Dimension line has a lot of appeal in China. We've had good growth in China so
far and this will help us accelerate that," he said.

In Japan, Dell sold 14.5 percent more PCs in the April-June quarter than a year
earlier on aggressive pricing, nudging out Fujitsu Ltd. (Tokyo:6702.T - News)
to become the second-largest PC supplier in Japan after NEC Corp. (Tokyo:6701.T
- News) in the quarter, according to research firm IDC.

Dell's unit shipments in India surged 82 percent in the quarter, giving it a
market share of about 7 percent. Growth in India is "phenomenal," Felice said,
saying he expected high double-digit percentage growth for India in both
revenue and unit terms.

Thanks for the mutual fund ideas.
I have said essentially that BRK was a lukewarm sell based on being able to
find a better position or positions, which may require delving into individual

Interesting that you mentioned MDT. One stock that I own and have posted about
from time to time is NPTH. The stock has done well the last year.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=1y&s=NPTH&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=mdt

But I think it could still be considered a bargain in its space on a price to
book, price to sales, and enterprise value to sales basis.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=NPTH
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=mdt

Furthermore, the company is currently spending an extraordinary amount of its
revenues on research and development, probably fifty percent more than their
historical norm, so some earnings have been masked by the large R&D line item.

John Hartig is the new CEO and he has brought to the company a more bottom line
approach to developing all of the opportunities they have on their plate. David
Grenz came out of retirement from MDT to head up their leads division. The
company is currently working on developing a minimally invasive epicardial
lead. Epicardial leads have a zero failure rate vs. endocardial leads which
have been projected to have a failure rate as high as thirty percent. The
problem is that epicardial leads need to be place through a surgical operation.
So if this procedure could be moved to a cath lab, it would result in increased
sales. NPTH is currently exploring partnering with a big medical device company
and I wouldn't be surprised if they sign a deal with MDT. The epicardial lead
project is two to three years in the making, but NPTH has other products for
the end of this year as well as the beginnin of next year.

Of course, the problem with NPTH is that it is a small cap with a lack of
liquidity. That is something to consider. But I believe the company will grow
both organically and through acquisitions.

Regarding MDT, you might be interested a recent Merrill Lynch survey of the
sector. Below is a portion of their report.

Merrill Lynch

MEDICAL-TECHNOLOGY REVENUE GROWTH has slowed dramatically with just a 4% gain
expected in the second quarter (versus a 15% gain in 2003-2004). But after
sluggish results in the first half, we look for sales momentum to rebound to
the 7% vicinity in the second half of 2006 and 10% in 2007.

Sales growth will actually slow sequentially in the second quarter versus the
first quarter owing in part to a further slowdown in the High Power market.
[High Power devices include cardio-inverter defibrillators, or ICDs, and
cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, or CRTDs.]

Revenue momentum looks poised to stage a rebound, albeit somewhat modest,
beginning in the third quarter and continuing into 2007. The expected
acceleration in sales growth is noteworthy given the historically high
correlation between reported med-tech revenue gains and the relative
performance of the stocks versus the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks.

Earnings growth in the second quarter of 2006 of 2% looks anemic, but is
heavily skewed by Boston Scientific. But Boston Scientific and Abbott's
acquisition of Guidant (Abbott purchased Guidant's Vascular Intervention
franchise, while Boston Scientific acquired the rest of the business) and the
resulting earnings dilution have significantly skewed results for the overall
group.

Excluding results for Boston Scientific (with earnings expected to decline 41%
in the second quarter) and Abbott (just a 2% increase in second-quarter net
income forecast), we look for second-quarter earnings to increase 9% with
full-year gains pegged at 11% (excludes Guidant from 2005 results for
comparative purposes).

We expect 80% of the companies we cover to top the forecast of 4%
second-quarter revenue growth with approximately half the group projected to
deliver solid double-digit revenue gains. And note that Abbott's reported
revenue growth is being adversely impacted by the change in accounting for
certain distributed drugs, partly offset by the acquisition in April of Guidant
Vascular Intervention; excluding these items Abbott's second-quarter revenue
growth is estimated at 9%.

Admittedly, earnings growth for a number of companies is below trend line
(Zimmer Holdings, Biomet, Medtronic, St. Jude, Johnson & Johnson), but in each
case we expect an acceleration going forward.

We like Medtronic's diversified sales base, solid double-digit sales and
earnings growth in fiscal 2007-fiscal 2010 and consensus earnings-per-share
(EPS) estimates that are at the low end of Medtronic's targets. The biggest
risk is the lack of a rebound in the High Power market (which makes up 25% of
Medtronic's revenue) and reimbursement cuts.

Such a loss would almost never happen on a value thread where somebody is

value stock, it's not likely to be undervalued by 1000% (i.e. worth $10/sh.,
but selling for only $1/sh.)

Certainly possible for somebody here to figure a stock could be a 10 bagger and

Spekulatius, my opinion is it's not possible to give recommendations for stocks

In other words, while I acknowledge that anybody might say and offer evidence
that a stock - like any $1 stock for example - is a potential 10-bagger (and
the person recommending it could turn out to be be right), I'm guessing that no
recipient of the recommendation will really act on it at the time of
recommendation -- and even if they did, I would be guessing they'd not make it
a large bet in their portfolio (and then hang on until the 10x gain was
achieved, if it were in fact reached.)

Based on the stocks that I've mentioned here that turned out to be ten baggers
plus, I certainly was surprised in every case that they did so, and I never
could or did predict a priori that they would turn out to be so.

With regard to the 10 Bagger potential of FLWS, Spekulatius, it would be
interesting to know within what sort of "time frame" you envisage this

With their current stock price at $4.80, not to mention a current TTM P/E of
48, they’d need to go to $48 a share.
It seems the highest they ever got to was $23.19 in August '99.

Although their last Annual revenue was up quite nicely, EBITDA, pre-tax income
and Bottom line all declined by fairly large percentages.
Their last Quarterly was, IMO, a disaster, with virtually everything down, and
a Bottom line loss of -$1.5mil. compared to a previous profit of $10.3mil.
It will be very interesting to read the contents of their next set of Annual

Considering their TTM Operating Margin and Pre-tax return on CE of only 3.3%
and 5.6% respectively, I’d certainly agree with your contention that it’s
"admittedly a long shot".

Comments in Barrons about builders and book value that I found worthwhile.

With the market feeling better about interest rates, many investors jumped back
into the builders, whose stocks could be expected to soar ahead of a potential
Fed rate cut. The stocks certainly looked washed out before they attracted the
renewed attention.

But the builder's rally is likely just an enjoyable summer zephyr.

Larry Jeddeloh, chief investment officer at money manager TIS Group, did buy
shares of Toll Brothers (ticker: TOL) and Ryland Group (RYL), but he notes that
it's a quick trade to take advantage of a likely short-term rally. "My gut
feeling" is that there is another leg down for this group, he adds, as the
stocks typically fall significantly below book value before they rally on a
sustainable basis.

On that score, they aren't close. The accompanying chart shows that the S&P
home builders are still trading, on average, at 119% of book value. Jeddeloh
says he won't be convinced that the stocks have bottomed until they're at 80%
of book. There will be another retest of the lows in the fall, he offers, as
some of the institutions stuck with huge chunks of these stocks will want to
exit, particularly in the tax-loss selling season. Anecdotally, a quick glance
at recently filed 13F documents shows that funds are still weighed down with
home-building shares.

Technical analysis also suggests that the worst isn't over. Says MKM Partners'
chief market technician, Katie Townsend: "There's perhaps another 5%-to-8%
rally left, based on the short-term oversold condition, but the group's
long-term technical picture remains bearish."

About the best that can be said is that these stocks probably are closer to a
bottom than a top. But when you're descending, the last step down can be as
painful as the first.

Columbia River Basin Washington State

Regarding concentrated positions, Canadian Eric Sprott's largest investment is
in Delta Petroleum. Some $ 150 million.

Eric's track record is something like 25% compounded return for many years. I
started following Delta when Eric in a conference (see below for details) call
talked about Delta having potential of being a 40 bagger. That got my attention
for DD going.

When someone like Eric says that I set out to determine if it could be true.
Well the trigger event for me was Thursday August 17, 2006 when the CEO of
Delta spoke at the Enercom Gas & Oil conference spilled the beans. I was
patiently waiting for this event. It took over 10 months. I now own high six
figures in this. I got the reporter to generate the news story below. The chase
is what it is all about.

Below is a summary of where I am today.

Columbia River Basin Multiple Trillion Cubic Feet Natural Gas Potential

Since we are talking about potential of 200-300 Trillion Cubic Feet of natural
gas and the ANNUAL U.S. usage of natural gas is about 23 Trillion Cubic Feet
you would think there would be more news coverage. Eric Sprott's firm largest
natural gas position is in Delta Petroleum.

Encana the operator is trying to keep tight wraps on this. Not sure why. Delta
Petroleum has been very open. Delta Petroleum has 20% of the play. Their
website is here: http://www.deltapetro.com

Target: Columbia River Basin ("CRB") Washington State - The largest unexplored
onshore basin in the United States

*****************************************News Story:

Headline in the Yakima Herald Republic Friday August 18, 2006

Sitting On a Gold Mine?

Columbia Basin could hold huge natural gas reserves

by Leah Beth Ward

A Denver-based petroleum company with significant mineral rights in the
Columbia Basin says drilling results so far at an exploratory well near Mattawa
indicate the region could hold significant reserves of natural gas.

"There are many different estimates out there, but the reality of the situation
is this basin, in all likelihood, represents the possibility of being able to
prove up in the tens of Tcfs (trillion cubic feet)reserves if not possibly in
the hundreds of Tcfs reserves," Roger Parket, chief executive officer of Delta
Petroleum said Wednesday at an annual oil and gas industry conference in
Denver.

If volumes ever approach those levels, the region would rang among the most
productive in the nation, alongside or exceeding such hot spots as the Jonah
Field and Green River Basin in Wyoming and the Piceance Basin in Colorado.

Parker's comments were available from a replayed Internet broadcast of the
conference.

The Mattawa well described by Parker was drilled by EnCana Oil & Gas USA, a
Canadian company with U.S. headquarters in Denver. EnCana has leased 800,000
acres in the basin. Delta has an interest in the Mattawa well and another
outside Sunnyside.

In 2002, the United States used about 22.8 Tcf of natural gas, making it one of
the world's largest consumers of the fuel, according to the federal Department
of Energy. A trillion cubic feet of natural gas can heat 15 million homes for
one year.

Dave Donegan, Delta's spokesman, said Thursday that Parker's remarks at the
conference could be characterized as cautiously optimistic.

"That's a fair assessment," he said.

Delta is not drilling in the Columbia Basin yet, but Parker said it's planning
to start later this year or early next year. The company has leased the mineral
rights on about 400,000 acres in the region, which state geologists say is the
largest unexplored area within the United States.

Encana has completed one exploratory well, known as the Anderville Farms 1-6
well, on a private farm in the Saddle Mountains east of Mattawa and is nearing
completion at a second site eight miles north of Sunnyside in the Rattlesnake
Hill. A third well is planned, but
company officials haven't revealed a location yet.

EnCana USA President Jeff Wojahn told analysts last month that the company
plans to conduct completion studies in the third quarter of this year, with
results known sometime in the fourth quarter.

Completion studies have a strict definition in the natural gas business,
explained Bill Lingley, lead geologist with the state Department of Natural
Resources. The well operator runs the
equivalent of a pistol down the well casing and shoots holes through the metal
into a potential gas zone. If a fluid forms, its likely to be gas condensate, a
sign of natural gas.

The plan for completion studies means EnCana is encouraged enough to spend at
least another $ 250,000 at the site, said Lingley.

"When I hear completion studies, I perk up. That means the operator is putting
his money where his mouth is," he said.

Encana, as is customary in the speculative business of exploration, is not
ready to call the venture a success.

Company spokeswoman Wendy Widenbeck said in a telephone interview that it will
be sometime next year before it can determine the results of its exploratory
program.

If the completion studies are positive, the company will seek permits for
delineation wells, which are drilled away from the original location in an
efforts to find out how large and prolific
the field might be.

Geologists have believed for some times that the Columbia Basin is rich in
hydrocarbons. In the early 1980's, a partnership of Shell and Arco hit a
reservoir that showed impressive initial pressure. But drilling technology at
the time made further exploration in the region's notoriously stubborn basalt
layers too expensive.

Partker, the Delta CEO, referenced the Shell experience in his
remarks.

"The main thing to say about the Columbia River Basin at this point in time,
the geologic theory that we've all kind of operated under here for the last
couple of years, and really was identified by Shell 25 years ago, has been
confirmed, if you will, with another well," Parker said. Parker said, referring
to the well near Mattawa.

"We believe we have encountered what we had hoped to encounter prior to
drilling the well and we will be very interested to see what actual completion
results are as we go into the remaining part of this year." END

Columbia River Basin Multiple TCF's NG --

The key speech happened Thursday August 17, 2006. Appears no one is paying
attention. Delta CEO Roger Parker is meeting with analysts today so the story
may get out later today.

Target: Columbia River Basin ("CRB") Washington State - The largest unexplored
onshore basin in the United States

Industry wisdom: Says the U.S. Pacific Northwest holds trillions of cubic feet
of natural gas, waiting to be discovered and produced.

More: Experts have long believed a 125-mile-long and 60-mile-wide patch of land
between the Columbia River and Wenatchee -- shaped like a massive footprint --
is rich in natural gas. So rich, in fact, its potential may be similar to the
vast supplies of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British
Columbia.

Potential: 200 to 300 TCF of natural gas. Each TCF proved is worth
approximately $ 1 to $2 Billion in market cap. The potential is substantial !!
(since Delta Petroleum owns approximately 20% of the CRB area play and has a
market cap of only $ 1 billion this play is
significant to them)

Research report: Ross Smith (highly rated independent Canadian Research firm)
on September 11, 2005 released a report on the CRB that estimated 228 TRILLLION
cubic feet of natural gas potential in the CRB. Delta has over 20% of the total
CRB land acreage tied up. Eric Sprott has said each TCF is worth $ 2 billion of
market cap..... ROSS SMITH ENERGY GROUP http://www.rseg.com/

Players: Shell (been interested in area for 25 years—only recently has
technology allowed feasible exploration), Encana and Delta Petroleum (DPTR—owns
20% of acreage in CRB)

potential of a 40 bagger and another occasion stated DPTR has the potential of
$800 NAV (DPTR Market price now under $ 18 with market cap of approximately $ 1

(Listen at 11 minutes 6 seconds Eric Sprott mentions could be 40 bagger (this
is early 2005-Delta has expanded play since then to own 20% of the CRB play up
from 12%:

http://events.streamlogics.com/sprott/jan19-
05/auditorium/index.asp )

http://tinyurl.com/qwhpv $ 800 NAV

Background: There is no natural gas wells in the state of Washington. Zero.

Geologists have long suspected that the Columbia Basin harbors hydrocarbons.
The trick has always been a matter of getting past thick layers of basalt to
the sedimentary rock below and then finding a large reservoir. Basalt is not
only hard but porous, and tends to absorb energy from seismic waves sent
underground to detect gas-holding formations.

In 1913, the Conservative Land Investment Co. of Spokane was drilling for water
in the Rattlesnake Hills and found gas instead.

The field didn't go into commercial production until 1929. By the time the
operation shut down in 1941, the field produced only 1.3 billion cubic feet of
gas, paltry by today's standards. Seattle consumes more than that in one day.

But back then it was enough gas to warrant construction of a wooden pipeline to
serve Yakima homeowners.

The region's production potential beckoned again in the late 1950s when what
was then Standard Oil of California began a test well. But the company soon
abandoned the effort and found no oil or gas.

Fast forward to 1984 when a partnership of Shell and Arco hit a reservoir that
displayed impressive initial pressure. But the companies quickly encountered
obstacles that made it too expensive to continue drilling.

The Shell/Arco well was not enough to extract commercially. Since then the
technology has advanced to make it easier, and cheaper, to recover gas from the
tight sandstone beds beneath much of southeastern Washington.

In late 2005 Encana as operator joint ventured with Shell and Delta Petroleum
began drilling the first 14,000-foot test well, the Anderville Farms 1-6. (note
Shell still involved !!)

EnCana's well is only six miles from the Shell/Arco site, which is now capped.

Encana has gone out of its way to keep everything secret and very quiet. They
just finished a second well. Encana may be quiet but Delta CEO Parker spilled
the beans at the 11th annual Enercom Gas & Oil Conference. Listen to the
results disclosed yesterday by Delta
CEO Roger Parker at the Enercom Gas & Oil Conference below. The wells appear to
be huge success.

Companies have been snapping up oil and gas leases near where EnCana is
drilling. More than 175,000 acres of federal land has been leased in Grant
County alone in the past three years, according to Bureau of Land Management
records.

MATTAWA —

Bill Delahoussaye, EnCana 's on-site consultant, can be both poker-faced and
ebullient when asked about the prospects for reaching what some have taken to
calling "the new black gold."

"With the technology we have and the market right now, this may become a
commercially viable project," Delahoussaye says, as if reading from a company
script.

But the veteran oil and gas man can't resist the scenario that could turn this
rural region into a prolific natural gas field over the next 20 years, similar
to now-booming areas in Wyoming, Montana, Colorado and New Mexico.

"I want to retire here," says the 56-year-old Houston resident who, for now,
lives on site in a trailer.

Jesse Palacios, Yakima county commissioner from Sunnyside, is rooting for
EnCana.

"I hope they are successful. It would mean great things for us," he said.

Delahoussaye (pronounced "della-HOO-see") said Shell used a conventional rig
that ran into a problem common to drilling in porous basalt.

Think of the rock formation below the ground as a piece of Swiss cheese.
Drilling fluids sent down the hole to help bring up the "cuttings" — mud and
rock loosened by the drill bit — like to enter the holes in the cheese. As a
result, the cuttings fall on top of the bit, the drill pipe can get stuck and
the whole mess is costly and time consuming to fix, Delahoussaye explained.

EnCana specializes in unconventional drilling technology, and it's brought that
to bear on the basalt. After starting to drill conventionally last December,
the company decided it was going nowhere fast and stopped. Then it ordered a
relatively rare type of rig, at least for the natural gas industry, from Lang
Exploratory of Salt Lake City. Drilling resumed in August.

Lingley, who has been to the site and is an expert on the geology of the
Columbia Basin, called the new rig "amazing. Even for a geek like me, it was
pretty cool."

A compressor injects air into a narrow space created by placing a smaller pipe
within a larger one. The pressure is a whopping 1,070 cubic feet per minute,
which would fill about 144 55-gallon barrels in one minute.

Air under such high pressure takes the path of lease resistance, creating a
vacuum. The cuttings are then "vacuumed" up the smaller pipe and out the hole.

The four-man crew working for EnCana is drilling three times as fast as Shell
in the 1980s, or about 156 feet a day.

"We're doing much better on time and cost," Delahoussaye said.

buying stock and then compares it to all the stock options that are exercised
and uses the the same price for the cost of the exercised options, then takes
that amount of money and subtracts it from net profits (as I think it should
be) then their profitability is very non-impressive.

Last I did the numbers was probably including FY 2004 and it was just

Wallace Rivers,

I am a mutual fund investor, too.

In my IRA I hold 1 small cap growth mutual fund, the Brown Small Company Fund
managed by Eddie Brown. He was the short guy that was a regular guest on the
old Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser show.
Eddie Brown invest in small medical, technology, and consumer stocks. I have
held the fund for 7 years and have achieved good results.

Also, last year I bought into the Baron Partners Fund, managed by Ron Baron, an
old Barron Roundtable guy. He had been sending me quarterly reports for 15

While I am not going to argue that DELL is not giving away an awful lot of its
income to insiders, I think your analysis does gloss over a couple points.
Insiders did pay to exercise those options, and that partially offsets Dell's
cost of repurchasing shares; also there are tax benefits to distributing
compensation via this route that you do not account for.

Also the way you're accounting for newly issued options is quite unfair; by
counting the change in fully diluted shares, you are treating Dell as if (i.e.
in 2005) they handed out 85 million new shares for free, rather than options
with an average strike of ~$35, for which they will collect ~3 billion at

I think your analysis does gloss over a couple points.

Sure it does....there's a lot of issues I don't address. I narrowed the vision
down to the one item that I believe is the single most important issue for me
as a shareholder: Can I trust management to have my best interests at heart?
I've answered the question for myself, how others answer it for themselves is
their own baliwick.

Insiders did pay to exercise those options, and that partially offsets Dell's
cost of repurchasing shares; also there are tax benefits to distributing
compensation via this route that you do not account for.

If this issue is significant for you, by all means use it. According to the
Statement of Cash Flows, DELL received $1,023M from those generous insiders, if
it makes you feel better that real net income was $1.5B instead of the reported
$3.5B and that insiders are only making away with 57% of the profits, well then
I stand corrected. However the tax benefits were already included in net income
so I'm not going to double credit that.

Also the way you're accounting for newly issued options is quite unfair; by
counting the change in fully diluted shares, you are treating Dell as if (i.e.
in 2005) they handed out 85 million new shares for free, rather than options
with an average strike of ~$35, for which they will collect ~3 billion at
exercise.

Newly issued options would not be included in fully diluted shares unless they
were in the money. If the options are in the money, then I as a shareholder
will get diluted in my ownership stake. I only used the number for fully
diluted shares that DELL used on their Income Statement, I did not "massage" it
in any way.

By the way, are you taking the position that 85 million shares in options is an
OK thing?

I have been watching HD as well (PE and P/S look attractive), but I think HD
will continue to underperform in the short-term for the following reasons:

1) Earnings outlook - All one needs is to look at what LOW did today (-4%) and
the overall housing outlook (for new homes and improvements) does not look good
for the next several months.

2) Management - I have no faith in Nardelli and believe pressure needs to be
placed on the board of directors to remove him. In 2005, Nardelli received
almost $30 million in salary, bonuses, restricted stock, and other
compensation, including a 590,000 share stock-option grant. BTW, HD's common
stock for 2005 was down 5.3% and its down 14% YTD. (Note to HD's board: Google

employment action). The recent annual meeting was a travesty and insult to all

FLWS - I agree that FLWS last quarter does not look good. As I see it, FLWS is

obviously the bottom line is the problem. if they can FTD ( a competitors)
margin within 5 %, we have FLWS making 2B$ in revenue and trading at a P/S of
1, which is a 5 bagger (not counting dilution).

Of course those assumption are a stretch, and a 5 bagger is not a 10 bagger
yet, but I don't think that without stretching the imagination as an investor
it is possible to get 10 baggers at all. Weather FLWS is a value stock at this

Your analysis is interesting but and clearly understates profitability.

Clearly understates profitability.....well, if you think so then by all means
compute profit by whichever means you think best suits your needs. From my
viewpoint I look at all claims to profitability with a very jaundiced view. I
especially do not count as profit anything that, as an owner, is clearly an
expense. By reading Security Analysis I learned a very conservative approach to
reviewing company financial statements and although the issue of stock options
was not covered in any great detail, I feel that my approach is one that treats
the issue in it's proper manner.

Now that the price has dropped substantially below $35 it would seem only fair
that you rework all your numbers because dillution will be a much lower number
at the margin and this will of course impact greatly upon your implied true
profitablity.

Nowhere in my analysis did I use stock price. I used the company's 10-K and the
data contained therein. If their next 10-K contains different information, then
I'll look at it when I get around to it. However, I look at the pattern over
time as well and the pattern at DELL is clearly (to me at least) one of
obfuscating the facts of real expenses and vastly overstating net income
because of it.

Your question implies that because the price is below $35 that somehow the DELL
insiders won't have as many options in the money, what about their largesse in
awarding them leads you to believe that that condition will be allowed to
continue for very long? I have no doubt that the management will be just as
clever as always regarding both the issue of taking the profits and in clouding
that they're doing so as they have been.

Alternatively you need to incorporate Crazy Pete's point that if you include
these 85MM shares you needed to also add back $3Billion to the implied profits

I don't know what you're talking about here.

Or are you saying that because of the options issued you have no interest in
being an investor period?

I am saying that because of the vastness of the options and the clear way that
management intended to cloud their real impact, I would not own this company.
The history as outlined in the financial statements is one of insiders getting
the lion's share of the profits and management complicit in obscuring the
expense of this employee cost.

Third natural gas well in pipeline for EnCana

YAKIMA HERALD-REPUBLIC
Published on Tuesday, August 22, 2006

"EnCana Oil & Gas has proposed drilling a third exploratory natural gas well
next month in western Grant County near Beverly.

The Denver-based company filed for a drilling permit with the state Department
of Natural Resources, which will take public comments until Sept. 1.

According to state records, EnCana proposes a 14,000-foot well about three
miles northeast of Beverly, east of the intersection of State Route 243 and
Beverly Burke Road.

EnCana has finished drilling an exploratory well east of Mattawa and is
approaching final depth on a second well eight miles north of Sunnyside.

The latest proposal, called Brown 7-24, would occur on private land in three
phases over 363 days. The site is roughly a dozen miles north of the Mattawa
well. Mint and wheat are grown in the area of the project, which is surrounded
by grazing and farm land. EnCana said agricultural activities won't be
disrupted by the drilling.

Last week at an oil and gas industry conference in Denver, a petroleum
executive whose company has an ownership interest in the Mattawa well said
results so far indicate there could be a substantial reserve of natural gas in
the Columbia Basin.

That company, Delta Petroleum, has announced plans to drill its own exploratory
well later this year or early next year. Delta leases about 400,000 acres of
mineral rights in the basin.

EnCana plans before year's end final tests for the presence of natural gas
condensation inside the Mattawa well. EnCana leases about 800,000 acres in the
basin."

Dynasil and EMF Announce Acquisition Agreement
Business Editors

WEST BERLIN, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 21, 2006-- Dynasil Corporation of
America (OTCBB:DYSL) and Evaporated Metal Films Corp. of Ithaca, New York
("EMF") are pleased to announce that a definitive agreement has been signed for
Dynasil to acquire 100% of the stock of EMF for a cash payment at closing.
Dynasil is a manufacturer of optical blanks from synthetic fused silica and
other optical materials as well as optical components and specialized optical
systems for the laser, optical instrument, and general optics markets. EMF
Corporation produces optical thin-film coatings for a broad range of
application markets including display systems, optical instruments, satellite
communications, and lighting. EMF has optical coatings capabilities that are
targeted additions to those currently offered by Dynasil including its
Optometrics subsidiary.

Consummation of the transaction is contingent upon several important conditions
including successful completion of debt and equity financing efforts which are
currently well underway. The transaction closing is currently scheduled for
October 2, 2006. The current EMF owner and CEO, Ms. Megan Shay, plans to
continue in an active leadership role and executive position for at least one
year after closing. If consummated, Dynasil's plan is for EMF to continue to
operate from its Ithaca, N.Y. facility as a Dynasil business unit. Ms. Shay
commented that "This is a very positive development for EMF customers and
employees since Dynasil brings increased capabilities and resources to EMF."
The acquisition of EMF is expected to immediately increase Dynasil revenues by
40-50% and to contribute significant net income in the future. Mr. Craig
Dunham, Dynasil's President and CEO, had the following comments on the
definitive agreement: "I believe that EMF will be an excellent addition to
Dynasil with EMF's broad capabilities for optical coatings, strong people, and
optical customers and markets that fit well with Dynasil. EMF and Dynasil have
some complementary strengths that we expect will result in increased growth and
profitability for both companies."

About Dynasil: Founded in 1960, Dynasil Corporation of America is a fabricator
of optical blanks from synthetic fused silica, fused quartz, and other optical
materials for the semi-conductor, laser, space and optical components
industries, and its subsidiary, Optometrics Corporation, is a worldwide

Timba was right that I'd misinterpreted the dilution; the 85 million increase
probably doesn't include a significant number of new options (which should be
mostly out-of-the-money given Dell's stock performance), they must be older
in-the-money options vesting. But still, the strike prices of those options
need to be considered.

Options certainly make Dell's financial picture much more murky and I'm not
trying to defend them here. They're certainly less profitable than it would
appear at first glance. Whether they are guilty of robbing stockholders... I
don't think you can conclude that from these numbers. It isn't as simple as
saying they shouldn't do what they're doing, because option compensation would
to some extent be replaced by other forms of compensation. I don't know to what
extent Dell's option handling is unjustly enriching management, as opposed to
enabling them to retain rank-and-file technical staff in a competitive
industry.

as crazy pete pointed out if you are including dillution when you calculate the
net effect of the buy back in terms of profitability you are assuming that all
those in the money options are exercised but if thats the case the company
would have received 85MM times $35 or $ 2,975MM so you have to add that back
when trying to calculate your implied profits

I did not massage any share statistics. I only used the fully diluted share
counts as provided in the Income Statement. The company is assuming exercise by
including them in "fully diluted" and they are doing so because accounting
rules require them to do so. It might be in order to think about why the rules
require this treatment!

It is simple math: the company says it bought back X number of shares and that
it paid Y dollars per share to do so. So far so good. But when one does an
elementary crosscheck to see whether the amount of shares purchased is matched
by a corresponding drop in diluted shares outstanding, one finds the
discrepancy.

I counted that discrepancy as an expense.

Now if you can account for the discrepancy in some other manner that holds
together under logical scrutiny, I'll take a look at it.

As you know, when a company buys shares those shares go into "treasury stock"
and shareholder equity gets reduced by a corresponding amount. There may be
good business reasons for putting those shares into treasury rather than just
retiring them. However, there is also created a loophole in the normal expense
accounting procedure: issuing shares from treasury to fill previously issued
stock options does not get reported on the income statement.

When the options are originally issued, their cost to the company is usually
computed using Black-Scholes and, oddly enough, the cost is alway at or near
zero. Then, years later (one hopes) when the options are exercised, the shares
are taken out of treasury stock and are not then treated as an expense either.

So what is the critical reviewer of profitability to do? Ignore that this is
happening? Not count some of the true expenses of doing business?

Each of us must come to their own resolution. My solution is as outlined. Is it
exact? No. But I believe it to be a lot closer representation of real earnings
than that put forth by the company. Is it fair? I guess it depends on modifying
the question by asking: Fair to whom? The company or the potential investor?

This investor takes a very critical eye to the evaluation of earnings and I
make no apologies for it. I am not interested in being "fair" to the company. I
am interested in deriving a conservative estimate of earnings from which to
assess whether the current pricing represents a value to me. That conservative
estimate does me no good if it eliminates real profit, and I don't believe this
treatment of stock repurchases does so. Stock is being delivered by the company
to the holders of vested, in-the-money options. When those options were issued
the company recorded no expense and when the stock was purchased, that
expenditure was not treated as an expense on the income statement. But real
profits were spent and thus real expenses occurred.

To treat the issue with absolute objectivity one must audit all stock option
grants and marry all exercises to the expense recorded when issued and then
match the correspondingly awarded stock to the actual price paid to acquire
that stock.

I am not about to go through all of that as an individual investor (even if the
company would make available all of the data needed) but feel that I have
developed a work-around that gives me a reasonable back-of-the-napkin estimate
of the cost of this expense and then all I have to do is subtract that cost
from reported earnings to get a value for net income that more accurately
reflects the costs of doing business.

I'll finish with a quote from the sage of Omaha:

“If stock options aren’t a form of compensation, what are they? If compensation
isn’t an expense, what is it? And, if expenses shouldn’t go into the
calculation of earnings, where in the world do they go?” – Warren Buffett, CEO,
Berkshire Hathaway

First Alabany came out with a buy on Delta today. Read a portion of what they
said:

Regarding: Delta Petroleum DPTR

(My Note if you don't believe in Eric Sprott's $ 800 potential (he has over
$120 million invested in Delta) how about the analyst report that came out
today First Albany at $ 175?)

From attached analyst report First Albany:

Two World-Class Prospects Expose Investors to $175 per share in Potential Asset
Value; Initial Results Anticipated in Next 3-6 Months

In the CRB, the Anderville Farms 1-6 (7.5% WI) has been drilled and logged. At
its analyst meeting, management described the log results as "better in some
ways than anticipated." Completion is anticipated in the next 30-60 days. The
second well in the basin, the Anderson 11-5 (7.5% WI) has spud, and Delta
recently announced it has begun permitting two Delta-operated locations (100%
WI). Delta's partners in the first phase of the play are EnCana and Shell
(RDS-$72.03-Not Rated ).

We consider this play to be the highest potential natural gas resource play
being evaluated in North America.

The CRB boasts the potential for a thicker pay section (1,000' versus 600' )
and better permeability (3 millidarcies versus 0.1) than the Pinedale and has
similar pressures (0.8 psi). One of the original wells drilled in the basin in
the early 1980s, the Shell BN 1-9, was completed in two sands that IP'd at 17
MMcfe/d and settled in at 5 MMcfe/d over an extended (62 days) production test.
Other wells in the basin had mixed results, but the primary challenge was
completing in multiple sands to increase production rates and unlock the
economic potential of the rock. Delta and its partners believe the multi-stage
completion technology that transformed the Pinedale into a world-class
play could have similar effect in the CRB.

A thick layer of basalt overlays the play from 8000-11,000'. The underlying
sedimentary layers total 3000-9000'. Delta and its partner have been using a
closed system "mining" rig to penetrate the basalt, which allows them to avoid
circulation issues and mud flow into fresh water aquifers. Drilling on the
first modern well in the basin, the EnCana-operated Anderville Farms 1-6 was
challenging, but the second well has drilled twice as fast to date. Delta
projects it should be able to drill at a rate of 200' a day through the basalt
and 400' a day through the sediment for a total drilling time of 105 days on
average (60 days through basalt and 45 days through sediment).

compensation. I don't know to what extent Dell's option handling is unjustly
enriching management, as opposed to enabling them to retain rank-and-file

I definitely agree that the options would be replaced with some other form of
expense. But don't you see....that means they already are an expense! So they
need to be treated that way and shown as a reduction to income just as all
other expenses are subtracted from income to derive net income.

As far as the options being effective as a tool to retaining quality
personnel.....I come from the old school in that I thought that was covered in
the paycheck. Pay them what their worth and they'll stay. If options are a part
of that package, count it as a real expense. Claiming the options have no real
value when issued because they are issued at or above current market price and
then buying stock to meet the demand in vesting options but not counting that
cost either is just a shell game.

We as value investors hold a mandate to perceive these shell games and not be
taken in by them. Whether the shell game is inflated assets or understated
liabilities or understated expenses, we make our bread and butter by clearly
and objectively assessing these elements and then using our revised valuations
to determine whether opportunity exists or not.

Here are some quotes on the stock options issue please also take a look at the
names and titles of those providing their comments:

“Those who argue against including options within the standard accounting
frameworks try to have it both ways: They believe that market participants are
smart enough to read through dozens of footnotes to figure out the implications
of options for the value of their shares, but so dumb that they would be misled
by the more accurate numbers that would be provided under the reform proposals,
and unable to redo the calculations themselves.” – Joseph E. Stiglitz,
Professor of Economics at Columbia and winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize for
Economics. 

“Money may not flow out of company coffers when options are granted, but real
costs are incurred…the argument that expensing stock options might hurt share
prices was akin to complaining that investors would pay less for shares if they
knew that profits were inflated” – Arthur Levitt, former Securities and
Exchange Chairman

“To assume that options grants are not an expense is to assume the real
resources that contributed to the creation of the value of output were free.
Surely the existing shareholders who granted the options to employees do not
consider the potential dilution of their share in the market capitalization of
their corporation as having no cost to them,” –Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve
Chairman

I think we are almost completely in agreement. Maybe our only significant
disagreement is semantic. You implied that Dell was (unjustly?) passing most of
its profits to insiders rather than to their investors. I'd say that those were
never profits to begin with, to the extent they are offset by option expenses;
Dell simply isn't as profitable a business as it appears. And I'm not sure that
is Dell's fault, exactly.

I certainly agree that options should be expensed, and that handling of stock
options makes financials more opaque. Other than swearing off investing in high
tech entirely, I'm not sure what to do about that.

Timbabear - Dell revisited:
 At the end of the fiscal year 2005, the fully diluted shares stood at 2,568M
and they were reduced to 2,449M by the end of FY 2006. A reduction of 119M
shares for a cost of $7,249M, or $60.92/share.
According to the financial notes, the repurchased shares cost an average of
$35.29/share. I look at the difference between the two as an expense of doing
business. Some may strongly disagree with that notion, but I feel that what is
spent that doesn't come to me, the shareholder, is an expense. Therefore if I
take the number of shares purchased times the difference in price I get (60.92
- 35.29) X 119M = $25.62 X 119M = $3,049.97M (call it $3,050M). This number
represents to me an expense item that needs to be subtracted from net profits
for me to get a handle on a more realistic net profit. 

I like the way you look at stock option expense, however there are different
ways to look at stock option expense. Much of it depends on weather the stock
option expense is indeed a discretionary expense ( reward for performance) or
just a way to pay employees regardless of performance. A fictional example may
illustrate the point:
Let's for example assume a hypothetical company trading at a PE of 30 and
growing revenues and earnings by 30% annually. As a founder I own the majority
of the shares, so i can almost do as I like. I have no Capex requirements to
grow my business, so all earnings are converted into Free cash flow. Because
much of the future of the business depends on keeping outstanding employees, i
made a simple deal. I give away 1% of the company for every 10% of growth. The
question is: am a foolish to do so?
Let's do the math: Since the company is growing 30% per year, I can assume that
the business by itself is worth 30% more; but wait - i have now 3% more shares
outstanding which means that each shares is only (1.3/1.03-1)*100=26.2% more.
Still not a bad deal for me, i think. Since I have no use of dividends and the
company generates excess funds, i decide i simply buy back shares using the
Free cash flow. Since I have an earnings yield of 1/30=3.33% I can buy back all
the diluted shares from my employees (and then some) and have the same amount
of cash in my balance sheet. Again, am I stupid? I don't think so...

OK I admit my company is hypothetical but what I say is that if i have a fast
growing company, trading at a reasonable valuation and a management I can trust
that gives out stock option on a discretionary basis, giving away some
ownership (and having a smaller piece of a much larger cake) then buying back
shares can be very reasonable, even though the picture in your math would make
it look bad. The problem with Dell for example is that stock options are given
out probably anyways, regardless of performance and growth, so it's not
discretionary and should be pretty much treated like an expense. The example
that I have been illustrating above for example pretty much applied to MSFT in
it's early years when giving out stock options was very reasonable and did make
sense.

As such i like to look at revenue and earnings share growth per share. I am Ok
to give away part of the company to employees and reward them for performance,
as long as the intrinsic value of the company increases and compensates for the
shares i am giving away, as I am OK to own a smaller piece of a much larger
cake. I would drastically cut down stock options if performance is below
average.

In my limited experience there are very few companies that can sustain high
growth for even the period of time it takes the average options to vest.

If a company believes that the best way to incent their workers is with stock
options, then let them be expensed at something like the real cost.

In your example, how would you treat the 3% of stock issued? If you claim that
because you bought them back, therefore there was no expense, the example
leaves out the impact of the continued company growth in price on its publicly
traded shares. Let's assume for a moment that the share price is stagnant.
(Just to get to the real point I want to make without getting all complicated).
In that scenario, the average number of diluted shares has a net change of zero
and the company experienced a net gain of 30% with no cost?

The problem is....you gave away the shares and then paid money to get them
back. So there was a cost, an expense if you will. This cost will reduce your
net profitability if expensed.

In certain limited cases, options may have some redeeming value, but I don't
see why just having a policy of: "For every 10% increase in net profit you guys
bring, we'll give you 1% of it as bonus." Because it is not done like that, one
has to wonder why not? This old dog has come to understand that it is because
one can't fudge the impact of the wealth transfer very easily by being direct
in the accounting.

Options are endemic to corporate America. They are the way that management
insiders transfer the net profit of the company to themselves thus leaving
scraps for the shareholders. They throw a few options to the employees through
ESOPs and such, but that is only to provide cover for themselves and their
massive options awards.

A prudent investor today needs to take a very critical view of the profits
distribution before accepting the EPS as being representative of anything but
GAAP-acceptable PR. Imagine the hit if the accounting treatment were the way I
figure it!

I've railed against the options treatment here years ago. Nothing much has
really changed in bringing their real cost to the bottom line profitability,
but at least the small changes were done with a lot of fanfare!

I thought about it and i was never a big fan of giving away lots of options. I
also am a little suspicious of the SEC investigation. I wondered why they
disclosed it now when apparently it has been going on for quite some time. The
last concern I have is that because Dell share price is such a large multiple
of book, the real earnings and cash flow are of critical importance. I confess
I did not pay attention to the option issue before purchasing.

The short interest is large at 13% and the First Albany analyst is very
surprised that it is that high.

Here is my new summary with some key extracts:

Columbia River Basin Multiple TCF's Natural Gas Potential

“We consider this play to be the highest potential natural gas resource play
being evaluated in North America.” First Albany August 22, 2006

Executive Summary

Target: Columbia River Basin ("CRB") Washington State - The largest unexplored
onshore basin in the United States !!

Industry wisdom: Says the U.S. Pacific Northwest holds trillions of cubic feet
of natural gas, waiting to be discovered and produced.

More: Experts have long believed a 125-mile-long and 60-mile-wide patch of land
between the Columbia River and Wenatchee -- shaped like a massive footprint --
is rich in natural gas. So rich, in fact, its potential may be similar to the
vast supplies of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta and British
Columbia.

Potential: 200 to 300 Trillion Cubic Feet or TCF of natural gas. Each TCF
proved is worth approximately $ 1 to $2 Billion in market cap. The potential is
substantial !! (since Delta Petroleum owns approximately 20% of the CRB area
play and has a market cap of only $ 1 billion this play is significant to them)
The ANNUAL United States usage of natural gas is about 23 Trillion Cubic Feet.
You would think there would be more news.

Research report: Ross Smith (highly rated independent Canadian Research firm)
on September 11, 2005 released a key report on the CRB that estimated 228
TRILLLION cubic feet of natural gas potential in the CRB. Delta has over 20% of
the total CRB land acreage tied up. Eric Sprott has said each TCF is worth $ 2
billion of market cap..... ROSS SMITH ENERGY GROUP http://www.rseg.com/

Players: Shell (been interested in area for 25 years—only recently has
technology allowed feasible exploration), Encana and Delta Petroleum (DPTR—owns
20% of acreage in CRB). Another player is Essex EXX.v.

The key speech happened Thursday August 17, 2006 by Delta Petroleum (DPTR) CEO
Roger Parker at the Enercom Gas & Oil Conference in Denver. On Friday, August
18, 2006 Mr. Parker hosted a analyst conference in Denver. Few are paying
attention.

Comments from Various Sources:

Delta CEO Roger Parker said Wednesday at an annual oil and gas industry
conference in Denver.August 17, 2006

“The main thing to say about the Columbia River Basin at this point in time,
the geologic theory that we've all kind of operated under here for the last
couple of years, and really was identified by Shell 25 years ago, has been
confirmed, if you will, with another well," Parker said.

"We believe we have encountered what we had hoped to encounter prior to
drilling the well and we will be very interested to see what actual completion
results are as we go into the remaining part of this year."

"There are many different estimates out there, but the reality of the situation
is this basin, in all likelihood, represents the possibility of being able to
prove up in the tens of Tcfs (trillion cubic feet) reserves if not possibly in
the hundreds of Tcfs reserves,"

August 22, 2006 First Albany Capital

“We consider this play to be the highest potential natural gas resource play
being evaluated in North America.”

“Two World-Class Prospects Expose Investors to $175 per share in Potential
Asset Value; Initial Results Anticipated in Next 3-6 Months”

“In the CRB, the Anderville Farms 1-6 (7.5% WI) has been drilled and logged. At
its analyst meeting, management described the log results as "better in some
ways than anticipated." Completion is anticipated in the next 30-60 days. The
second well in the basin, the Anderson 11-5 (7.5% WI) has spud, and Delta
recently announced it has begun permitting two Delta-operated locations (100%
WI). Delta's partners in the first phase of the play are EnCana and Shell
(RDS-$72.03-Not Rated ).”

“The CRB boasts the potential for a thicker pay section (1,000' versus 600' )
and better permeability (3 millidarcies versus 0.1) than the Pinedale and has
similar pressures (0.8 psi). One of the original wells drilled in the basin in
the early 1980s, the Shell BN 1-9, was completed in two sands that IP'd at 17
MMcfe/d and settled in at 5 MMcfe/d over an extended (62 days) production test.
Other wells in the basin had mixed results, but the primary challenge was
completing in multiple sands to increase production rates and unlock the
economic potential of the rock. Delta and its partners believe the multi-stage
completion technology that transformed the Pinedale into a world-class play
could have similar effect in the CRB.”

“A thick layer of basalt overlays the play from 8000-11,000'. The underlying
sedimentary layers total 3000-9000'. Delta and its partner have been using a
closed system "mining" rig to penetrate the basalt, which allows them to avoid
circulation issues and mud flow into fresh water aquifers. Drilling on the
first modern well in the basin, the EnCana-operated Anderville Farms 1-6 was
challenging, but the second well has drilled twice as fast to date. Delta
projects it should be able to drill at a rate of 200' a day through the basalt
and 400' a day through the sediment for a total drilling time of 105 days on
average (60 days through basalt and 45 days through sediment).”

August 21, 2006 Petrie Parkman

“With news on several key exploration projects likely in the next several
months and a significant (13%) short position built, we believe DPTR shares
have little downside risk and encourage investors to be in front of these
potential catalysts.”

"In our view, Delta holds the greatest leverage for investors wanting exposure
to the Columbia River Basin play."

“In our view, Delta holds the greatest leverage for investors wanting exposure
to the Columbia River Basin play. The company currently holds interest in six
prospects with a 100% WI and five prospects with a 15% WI, with each prospect
looking to test a separate geologic feature.”

“The long-awaited Anderville Farms 1-6 (EnCana-operated) well is currently at
total depth and is waiting on a completion rig to be moved on location so that
the well can be tested. The completion rig is expected to be on location in the
next several weeks with test results anticipated sometime in October. It is
worth noting that Delta’s geologic assumptions that defined the prospect prior
to drilling, which included the expectation of numerous stacked, over-pressured
sands in a basin-centered setting, appear to have been encountered in the
drilling of the well. Importantly, management believes that the prospect has
the potential to hold a separate shallower conventional play that was not seen
in any of the earlier wells. It was noted at the meeting that this conventional
formation could be similar to a typical south Louisiana gas play that is
characterized by high porosity and produce at very high flow rates.”

Columbia River Basin Background

Background: There is no natural gas wells in the state of Washington. Zero.

Geologists have long suspected that the Columbia Basin harbors hydrocarbons.
The trick has always been a matter of getting past thick layers of basalt to
the sedimentary rock below and then finding a large reservoir. Basalt is not
only hard but porous, and tends to absorb energy from seismic waves sent
underground to detect gas-holding formations.

In 1913, the Conservative Land Investment Co. of Spokane was drilling for water
in the Rattlesnake Hills and found gas instead.

The field didn't go into commercial production until 1929. By the time the
operation shut down in 1941, the field produced only 1.3 billion cubic feet of
gas, paltry by today's standards. Seattle consumes more than that in one day.

But back then it was enough gas to warrant construction of a wooden pipeline to
serve Yakima homeowners.

The region's production potential beckoned again in the late 1950s when what
was then Standard Oil of California began a test well. But the company soon
abandoned the effort and found no oil or gas.

Fast forward to 1984 when a partnership of Shell and Arco hit a reservoir that
displayed impressive initial pressure. But the companies quickly encountered
obstacles that made it too expensive to continue drilling.

The Shell/Arco well was not enough to extract commercially. Since then the
technology has advanced to make it easier, and cheaper, to recover gas from the
tight sandstone beds beneath much of southeastern Washington.

In late 2005 Encana as operator joint ventured with Shell and Delta Petroleum
began drilling the first 14,000-foot test well, the Anderville Farms 1-6. (note
Shell still involved !!)

EnCana's well is only six miles from the Shell/Arco site, which is now capped.

Encana has gone out of its way to keep everything secret and very quiet. They
just finished a second well. Encana may be quiet but Delta CEO Parker spilled
the beans at the 11th annual Enercom Gas & Oil Conference. Listen to the
results disclosed yesterday by Delta CEO Roger Parker at the Enercom Gas & Oil
Conference below.

Maybe short interest is due to the possibility of "backdating of options". The
following is quoted from Rocky Mountain News:

"In a June investigation, the Rocky Mountain News found that in four of the
past eight years, when Delta Petroleum granted stock options to its top
executives it issued them with an exercise price equal to the stock's 52-week

Dell - revisited II
 If a company believes that the best way to incent their workers is with stock
options, then let them be expensed at something like the real cost. 

We are in total agreement on this point.

What I wanted to point out with my hypothetical example of a 30% grower that
you option math can make a company look bad when in fact management makes
totally responsible decisions. In this example that I have been referring to,
the free cash flow would all be used up to prevent dilution, yet the
shareholder would be doing OK. This was the point I was trying to make.

There are other problems with your math - the dilution that you have been
calculating is really caused by stockoptions granted many years ago. What is
more relevant IMO is the rate at which stock option are granted today and in
the future. This is somewhat accomplished by directly expensing stock options
using the Black Scholes model. In fact many tech company have reduced their
stock option grants over the last few years quite substantially, so stock
option related expenses should be going down in the future.

As far as DELL is concerned, growth in the single digits does not justify
annual dilution larger than 1%.

Madharry,

While I understand that the majority of Dell's repurchases of common stock is
to offset the dilution from stock option issuances, one reason why Dell's
multiple of book value is so high is due to its share repurchases which are
classified as treasury stock.

As such, back out Treasury stock from Shareholders' Equity and add the market
value of Dell's Treasury Stock to Shareholders' Equity. That should give you a
"truer" reflection of book value.
