Anyone checked IIIN.OB? ... selling at 7.40, they just made .73 in the last
quarter, price/sales around 0.25. Mkt. cap around $64M, sales over $73M in
latest quarter. Not many OTCs like this...
Next quarter earnings on 7/16, company hinted for more than $1 per share net
income on last CC. That would amount for a 12 month trailing earnings close to
3 bucks!

Nasdaq or AMEX listing will be addressed after next shareholder meeting on

The problem with Cardinal seem to be company specific at this point. So I think
the current weakness caused by Cardinal's earnings warning is a good
opportunity to add to ABC, which I prefer to MCK.

I do agree with Spek, it is pretty easy to manipulate a stock which trades only
about $300K/day volume - even more so if it's a BB stock. $300K is a drop in

Paul Senior,

For BLUE I think Yahoo is counting cash (9.743) + short-term investments
(32.044) / outstanding shares of 12.0 million = 3.48 per share. Current
liabilities do not seem to be in there, that could be the reason for the diff.

I could be very wrong, but seems reasonable.

edit: The 3/2004 10Q suggests liquidity problems if they can't get their
customer base producing better:

We currently anticipate that our existing cash and investments will be
sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital, capital
expenditure and operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. Either
within this time period or at some future date, if our current financial
performance continues, we may need to raise additional funds in the future
through public or private debt or equity financing. There can be no assurance
that this additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on
reasonable terms. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we
may have to accept financing on terms we view as unreasonable or that are
dilutive to our stockholders, or to cease operations. If we were to seek
additional financing today, we do not believe it would be available on
reasonable terms. 

The existence or even the anticipation of an uncertain economic and political
environment by potential customers in the markets we operate in has affected
the demand for our applications, caused pricing pressures for our products and
increased customer requests for extended payment terms. We expect current
conditions to continue in future periods, which could in turn materially reduce
our liquidity.

Jarden Corp. (JAH) discussed now in this Motley Fool column:

303100&logvisit=y&npu=y

As relates to the Value Investing thread, this is an interesting stock and
company from my viewpoint. To me, the stock's performance illustrates the
benefits of having a diversified portfolio and maintaining a long-term
perspective.

The company's products are dull stuff used around the house - twine,
toothpicks, pencils (e.g. Ticonderoga, discussed here previously). One would be
correct to expect not very much interest in the stock based on the company's
businesses.

The stock was discussed here around 11/2000. (Name was Alltrista then). Couple
other times maybe. (I recall such, but searching SI history doesn't show this.)
A very positive article on the CEO and his drive and business acumen was
published in Forbes, 10/'03.

In any case, had a person taken a few shares when the usual financial ratios
looked decent in late '00, or when they still looked okay in subsequent years -
and if the person had held on to the stock and gained more knowledge over time
about the company's prowess and acquisition skills (as shown by JAH's earnings
gains) - that person would have seen unusually good percentage gains in the
stock. Perhaps very surprisingly good, given the prosaic nature of the products
the company sells.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=JAH&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=

I came across another bank where Jeffrey Gendell is a 5% holder. The symbol is

mortgage originations, the p/e at 11, the p/b at 1.15 and the dividend yield at
almost 4% look pretty attractive. There is always the chance that they will get
bought out at some point, but even without a buyout, it would seem that decent
appreciation should be attainable from this price, with a nice dividend while

WNMLA,

I have tracked this not very closely for a few years (and bot/sold a couple
times). This stock seems perenially cheap except the time when the huge bull
run in gold occurred, which helped their gold fund and the stock price.

With the huge amount of cash and positive earnings, there is no way the stock
should be selling this cheap, yet management isn't doing anything positive to
help the share price.

The management seems like slimeballs, which would cause me to tread carefully
despite the compelling valuations.

I own some WNMLA at a cost of 3.91, having traded it many times but having been
caught with one position when they announced this delisting. I think the
delisting makes sense from a financial point of view, as the new regulations
are onerous and expensive, but of course it will make it harder to trade the
stock. It wasn't that easy to trade it as things were, as it often had a wide
spread and fairly low volume, but this will make things worse from a trading
standpoint.

I'm curious as to why you view the management as slimy. I know that the A
shares are not voting shares, and all of the control in terms of voting rights
is held by the insiders, but the chairman and others also own a large position
in the A shares, and their pay is not at all out of line. There have been no
options exercised in over a year and a half.

I think more and more companies will choose to delist and/or go private in the
coming months, due to the recent regulatory changes, so perhaps it will become
more accepted for a company to trade on the pink sheets. I don't have any good
reason to dump my WNMLA shares at this price given the company's underlying
value, but it may be a while before I can sell them for a profit. A share
buyback and/or a dividend would be nice.

WNMLA,

Maybe I am too cynical.

First, if management had shareholders in mind the stock wouldn't be languishing
at discounts to cash and book for so long. The one big run-up was not
management-driven in my mind, but due to the gold run-up (since the fund
manages a gold mutual fund). I think WNMLA should be using its cash hoard to
buy back stock or just take the darn company private and put shareholders out
of their misery.

Second, this company manages small, junky funds like MIDSX, MISEX, and GIF that
have huge expense ratios and seem to have little reason for existence. For
example, MISEX has a huge 3.67% expense ratio and a significantly negative
five-year return. IMO that fund should be put out of its misery as well ...

Again, maybe I am too cynical, but my view is that management cares about
itself, not its its shareholders.

MC
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:7/15/2004 5:08:59 PM
From:Carl Worth
I agree with you that the expense ratio on MISEX is excessive and
unjustifiable. I'm surprised there is any money left in the fund given its
performance.

When the stock made a run in early March, it was during that short period of
time when the opportunists were running small float stocks. I had other stocks
which ran at the same time (TORM, HIHO, CULS come to mind).

The run that the stock made in mid May was on earnings, and those earnings were
mostly due to the appreciation of BXL and TUX, in which they have significant
positions.

It's true that their assets under management increased due to the gold market,
but I don't think that had much of an effect on the stock, unless it was before
I started following and trading it, which was last summer.

I agree that it would be nice if the company would do a buyback. At this point
it would be even better if they would just take it private at 6 bucks, because
I'm not sure it will be much of a trading vehicle as a pink sheet stock, and
that's all it has been for me anyway. I wouldn't dump it here given the
intrinsic value, but it may end up being a tax loss candidate by the end of the
year. <g>

Perhaps the management is paying itself much more than the stated salary
attributed to WNMLA by serving as paid advisors to the various funds, and if
that is the case then I would agree that they are looking out for themselves
more than I had considered. I can't blame them for choosing to delist, as
another company I have spoken to told me that it will save them 400K a year to
go private, so I would guess WNMLA will save a similar amount of money.

Thanks for your input, it will be interesting to see how this one progresses.

Chip stocks continue to look weak - i added a few TSM yesterday. TSM is the
largest and most profitable foundry company worldwide and forward PE's look

AUO is also weak, i continue to hold my small position. Flat panel prices are

plants, right now leading edge is 6 and 7G. However these plants are almost
depreciated to 0 now , which could compensate for most of the cost
disadvantages.

PFE and WYE are both weak and look attractive to me. The legislation around WYE
is pretty scary though. PFE with weaker than expected revenues due to currency

Recently, I have sold covered calls to generate extra income and rolled some of

I have been a holder since this company was first mentioned on this message
board around September of 2000. Since them the company underwent an SEC
investigation for understating earnings and a class action lawsuit. When I made
my purchases the company sales were declining rapidly.

Over the years that I've held on I believe sales stabilized (I will re-check
this). Operations have not improved greatly, but the company seems to put out a

The balance sheet appears to remain strong, although somewhat deteriorating

RE: Lafarge (LAF) I never realized that concrete was this hot:

Recasting Concrete

The Drab Stuff of Sidewalks Takes On Hues, Translucence, Intriguing Building
Designers
By RAY A. SMITH Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
July 21, 2004; Page B1

Colorful concrete?

It's happening -- among other places in Hillsborough, N.C., where Meg Perry
started a decorative-concrete business last year after attending a seminar at
the 2003 World of Concrete Convention. Ms. Perry, a 42-year-old former
homemaker and onetime horse trainer, stains concrete floors, patios, pool decks
and sidewalks different colors, resulting in what she describes as an almost
marble or stone finish. "The reaction we want is: 'Oh my God, that's concrete?'
" she says.

Ms. Perry is one among a loosely knit cast of inventors, architects, companies
and entrepreneurs trying to recast concrete -- the humdrum stuff of sidewalks,
roads and utilitarian structures -- as an exciting material with endless
decorative and structural possibilities. There is even translucent concrete --
concrete embedded with plastic or glass fibers that transmit light from one
side of a wall to another.

"Concrete had been taken for granted at some level," says David Shepherd,
director of sustainable development for the Portland Cement Association, a
trade group based in Skokie, Ill., representing about 49 cement companies in
the U.S. and Canada. "There's this new artistic sense of what can be done with
it."

Designed by LiTraCon of Germany, this concrete wall owes its translucence to
embedded glass fibers. The company says its product is strong enough to be used
to construct buildings.

Over the past two decades, there have been a number of efforts to push the
possibilities of concrete aesthetically -- from the embracing of concrete
floors and countertops in homes to concrete staining, stamping and stenciling.
(For those mixing their own concrete, the basic ingredients are cement, sand,
aggregate -- usually gravel or crushed stone -- and water. Cement is the
binding agent, essentially the glue, in concrete.)

At first, the concrete craze was confined to retailers, avant-garde architects
and ultra-trendy individuals, mostly in California. Lately, it's gone
mainstream. Elaborate designs and patterns are increasingly being incorporated
into driveways, entryways, and pool decks of homes, in states such as Georgia,
North Carolina and Texas.

Jill Hesterlee, a 34-year-old homemaker, was convinced concrete would be right
at home in her family's five-bedroom, six-bath home in Carrollton, Ga., after
falling in love with a countertop she saw while shopping in an Anthropologie
clothing store in a local mall. "I asked the manager what it was and found out
it was concrete," she says. She hired Decorative Concrete Institute of
Douglasville, Ga., to have the kitchen and bathroom countertops, the back
splash behind the stove, the floors, front porch, and veranda near the pool
done up in decorative concrete. At first, she says, "my husband was a little
skeptical of the idea, but he is really pleased with it also."

Concrete is even getting more respect in people's homes on a functional level
as well as a decorative one. Insulated concrete, which is said to keep air from
leaking better than wood, thus reducing air-conditioning and heating bills, has
gained popularity. In fact, concrete homes, including ones that have insulating
concrete forms, represented an estimated 16% share of new-home construction in
2003, compared with 3% in 1993, according to the Portland Cement Association.

On a larger level, post 9/11 national-security concerns have prompted growing
use of the material in the form of concrete cores, to enhance stiffness in
buildings, notes Richard L. Tomasetti, co-chairman of New York-based
engineering firm Thornton-Tomasetti Group. Design plans for a major building at
Ground Zero on the site of the destroyed 7 World Trade Center call for using
reinforced concrete to surround the building's core, which contains stairs,
elevators and antennas for emergency communication.

Kennedy & Violich Architecture Ltd. of Boston is testing "smart" concrete,
which has embedded sensors so that sidewalks and highways, for example, would
light up in dim situations. "It could increase safety," says Sheila Kennedy, a
principal at the firm.

The momentum building around the material is in evidence at the National
Building Museum's eight-month-long exhibition/celebration of concrete called
"Liquid Stone: New Architecture in Concrete." On display at the museum in
Washington, D.C., are 29 architectural projects that use concrete -- a material
believed to have been first used more than 2,000 years ago -- in what the
museum says are "exciting" ways.

The exhibition, which opened last month, is sponsored by Lafarge, a
manufacturer of building materials. Among displays generating the most buzz is
a small-scale model of a chapel with translucent-concrete walls; the walls
contain embedded plastic fibers that transmit light from one face to the other.
The chapel "shows that something so historically inert can become light," says
Bill Price, a 38-year-old architect from Houston, whose company designed the
chapel. Beaming, he adds: "Concreteness is not so concrete."

The show also features a series of translucent-concrete panels developed by
Will Wittig, an assistant professor at the University of Detroit Mercy. The
panels are a tenth of an inch thick, which is thin enough to be translucent
under direct light. The panels are made of Portland cement and sand, reinforced
with a small amount of chopped fiberglass.

While translucent concrete has been attracting attention, it is also prompting
skepticism as a viable building material. "There's no way a building is going
to be built with it," scoffs Kenneth A. Hiller, a senior vice president and
chief structural engineer at construction giant Bovis Lend Lease, a division of
Australian real-estate services company Lend Lease Group. He says he can't
envision anyone using translucent concrete to hold up loads. If it is used in a
building, he says, it would be "purely for artistic reasons."

Christian Meyer, a professor of civil engineering at Columbia University, also
wonders about the practicality of see-through concrete. "Strength isn't the
first thing that comes to mind when you talk about translucent concrete," says
Prof. Meyer, who developed a concrete that incorporates crushed glass and is
being used in floor tiles and other products made by Wausau Tile Inc.
Translucent concrete "is probably more for interior decorating," he says. "I
can't imagine you would use it to build an 80-story building."

Mr. Wittig says he never intended his material for structural use and saw it
more as a "poetic gesture." But Mr. Price says his product is thick enough to
be used to construct buildings. "Absolutely," he says, citing the chapel. "It's
structural and decorative." Translucent walls he designed were installed
earlier this year in a boutique in Korea. He says he has a licensing agreement
with an Austrian concrete manufacturer for the material, a deal that includes
building the company's headquarters with translucent concrete.

Also on display at the exhibition is a 5-foot-high concrete wall designed by
LiTraCon GmbH, of Aachen, Germany, that transmits light via embedded glass
fibers. LiTraCon says that its product is strong enough to be used to construct
buildings, but that doing so would be too expensive because of the glass fiber.

The issue with LR has previously been high debt and low return. They recently
paid off debt, but the return has not increased. On the other hand, CX's return
on equity has also dropped to almost LR levels, so both companies are somewhat
comparable now. I would probably avoid buying either here, though I continue to
hold CX.

There is also an issue of partial holdings (like LR's holding of LAF) of
companies around the world. CX has similar holdings in various countries. I
don't like this, since it makes the financial statements almost impossible to
decipher, especially since both LR and CX are foreign companies themselves. You
have to trust that the management does not play games with accounting.

Sam,

I did not try to imply that LR or CX has bad or dishonest management. I just
said that these companies have so many partially owned subsidiaries that
understanding the full picture of parent company financials is very difficult
for me. It is compounded by foreign listing, where the results of subsidiaries
are first converted to parent's currency and accounting standards and then has
to be converted again to US currency and accounting standards + adjustments for
ADR ratios, different shares outstanding, etc. As Buffett says, it is outside
my sphere of competence. I bought CX without realizing this, but I would not
buy more of it unless it was vastly vastly undervalued because of this reason.
I am afraid it is the same issue with LR.

From:- with a K
Paul, I sold my KTEC a while back, as reported here, and haven't followed it
since. My main concern was the extreme lack of volume and interest, and I see
their business is still soft, except for the aftermarket space. I imagine they
are concerned about the shrinking backlog.

Net sales for the three-month period ended June 30, 2004, totaled $22.2
million, compared with $25.0 million in the same quarter last year. Net
earnings for the third quarter were $2.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share,
compared with net earnings of $3.0 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in the
same period a year ago.

New orders received during the third quarter were $15.9 million, compared to
$15.7 million in the same period last year. At the close of the June 2004
quarter, the Company's backlog was $12.7 million compared to $18.0 million at
the close of the corresponding period one year ago.

Morton commented, "With order volumes for the third quarter flat compared to
the prior year, we did not rebuild our backlog, which had declined in the
second quarter of this year. Our customers continue to have a conservative
outlook on market conditions and the timing of capital projects approval is
hard to predict."

"While our operating results and cash generation continue to be good, we remain
cautious about the short-term outlook for our markets where we have seen a
number of deferred projects. We are continuing our strategy of investing in new
product and new market development, and will be introducing over a dozen new
products and product families this fall and winter. We expect to see the
benefits of these investment programs during fiscal year 2005. As previously
announced, our recently completed InspX joint venture adds an important new
technology, x-ray inspection, to our offerings and we have other interesting
product line extensions in our development pipeline," said Morton.

did announce an increased dividend (which'd yield .48/$18.70~~2.6%) and
reaffirmed their expectation of $2.65-$2.80 earnings for this year- which
implies a p/e or 7 or less at current price.

Wallace Rivers, re: HBP. I've always considered BMHC as a similar company in
that materials supplier-to-the- building-construction sector (although Yahoo
doesn't show them as competitors). BMHC hasn't had the move that HBP recently
has, especially when looking up from HBP's lows.

Good news forthcoming from BMHC today. I continue to hold a few shares.

More bad news for CAH holders. (Stock drops on sudden departure of CFO). I'll
add just a very few shares now to my small, but losing position.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=t&s=CAH

I'm not so much concerned long-term about financial shenanigans here (of which
there may be valid suspicions), as I am about the viability of their drug
distribution model. Margins have been shrinking over the years; rev. growth
that I see may be declining as both ends - drug makers and consumers -
seriously seek to cut costs of expensive drugs. CAH does have other businesses
(e.g. medical device sales) that are a large component of overall revenue and
that are growing and promising, but these may not strong enough to compensate
for the drug distribution issues that investors are looking at.

I'll add back to my small NUTR position now on today's price drop.

Company is still relatively expensive. That is, based on previous p/bk, p/e,
and p/sales. But it seems like it is able to continue delivering very good
returns on assets and good profit margins. On that basis, p/e and psr look okay
to me.

"Nutritional supplement" competitor Nature's Bounty's stock has had a rough go
of it recently. (Stock near 12 month low) I'm more familiar with NUTR, but I'll
look at NTY too. (NTY seems a bit more expensive.) I'm under the impression
size is very important in this fragmented business, and if so, NTY would have a
competitive advantage over rivals.

re CAH: I do own ABC and I am not too concerned about the drug distribution
business. Sure, gross margins have been going down for years but so have costs
and net margins for some of the players have actually improved. The pharma
companies are cracking down on speculative buying ahead of price increases, but
this is a practice that ABC has not been involved that much. What i see is a
low risk distribution business with the underlying growing by low double
digits. At the current valuations for distributors, i consider this a good
value.

CAH is a little different than MCK and ABC as it has some higher margin
business with medical devices as well as manufacturing component (sterilization
etc.). It's probably a company that will not look as good going forward as it
used to in the past, but at a PE around 11 (if current estimates are correct)
the expectations are very low as well. Worth a buy, IMO (although i don't have
a position right now).

Nice quarterly reports out by home builders SPF and LEV.

SPF may have a p/e about 5.5 now based on management's new estimate of year's
earnings. I just guess though - with all the negativity about a "housing
bubble", rising interest rates, and home building stocks dropping from highs
(thus sort of confirming for many people that home builder stocks are indeed
unattractive) - that regardless of p/e, it would be very difficult for anybody
who's been a thread reader for a few years and who's not bought the home

From:- with a K
I bought some OVTI this morning, even with the ugly chart and noting Jurgis'
flags.

Per Yahoo, 10 analysts expect an average of $1.48 next year with EPS growth of
22.5% annually for 5 years. Per First Call, OVTI has had a PE above 20 from Q1
'03 to Q3 '04. I've scaled both of those back but it still has a compelling
value IMO.

Company: OVTI
Date: 7/29/04
Next year's expected earnings: $1.48
EPS growth rate used for estimate: 15
P/E maximum used for estimate: 12
Graham Fair Value: $43.76
Current Price: $11.48
$ difference: $32.28
Percent Growth to Fair Value: 281.19%

SM July 12 column snip: 

OmniVision's stock woes began when, instead of reporting fiscal 2004
fourth-quarter and year-end results on June 9, the company announced on that
day that it would reschedule the release to June 23, and would likely be
restating past results. Management in the release tried to put on a happy face
— "Could Upwardly Revise Prior Sales and Net Income" sounded almost like a plus
— but nervous investors bailed, sending shares to $16 from $25 within a week.

The June 23 report did little to help, despite showing sales for the fourth
quarter ballooning 150% to $99.7 million and earnings jumping 242% to $20.8
million. Per-share earnings of 34 cents topped analysts' expectations by two
cents. But the restatement, which raised per-share earnings by four cents in
the second quarter and a penny in the third, nonetheless left investors
rattled. Shares today fetch about $13.

Needham & Co. analyst Quinn Bolton calls the restatement "unfortunate but not
fraudulent." He notes that it relates to two things: a distributor being slow
to report sell-through revenues, and certain shipments being incorrectly
classified. Bolton calls the pullback "an attractive buying opportunity."
(Bolton doesn't own shares of OmniVision; Needham & Co. has an
investment-banking relationship with the company.)

How cheap is OmniVision's stock right now? Plenty, it appears. It trades at
just 9.8 times Reuters Research's fiscal 2005 earnings consensus of $1.33 per
share, compared with an average price/earnings multiple of 24.4 for
semiconductor companies. And OmniVision is projected to boost earnings by 22.5%
annually over the next five years, compared with 18.0% for the group. That
gives the stock a price/earnings-to-growth, or PEG, ratio of 0.43, well below
the peers' 1.36 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index's PEG of 1.56. That looks
to us like the very image of a bargain.

Why The Lawsuits will FAIL
by: ws2000trader
Long-Term Sentiment: Buy 07/28/04 06:48 pm
Msg: 64127 of 64502

Here is why the lawsuits will fail:

OVTI has conducted an internal review which was initiated in response to issues
raised by an employee of the company.

As a result OVTI notified the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the
issues raised, and the Audit Committee conducted an independent investigation
in cooperation with special legal counsel.

As a result of the internal review and the independent investigation,
management and the Audit Committee determined that certain errors had occurred
which principally affected the timing of revenue recognition for certain sales.

The independent investigation concluded that there was no evidence of
wrongdoing in connection with these errors.

As a result of their findings, OVTI, under direction from the Audit Committee,
is in the process of making improvements to its internal controls and
information systems.

So what happened?

There are only two (2) issues regarding the restatement:

First,
beginning in the second half of fiscal 2003 and continuing through the first
nine months of fiscal 2004, certain distribution sales, for which the Company
recognizes revenue on a "sell-through" basis, were not reported to the Company
by one of its distributors in a timely manner.

Second,
In the second and third quarters of fiscal 2004, during the transition of
testing operations and certain international sales functions to overseas
locations, some shipments made to
customers late in the quarter were “incorrectly classified” as transferring
title upon delivery as opposed to upon shipment, and therefore revenue was not
recognized when product was shipped.

The result:

Increase of Revenue of some $8.9 Million and Earnings of $2.8 Million. On June
9th, OVTI thought there might be an increase of approximately $5 Million in
Revenues.

As for the current Qtr:
Projected Wall Street Revenue forecast was for was $102 Million with Earnings
at $0.32/share. Actual is $99.7 in Revenues with Earnings at $0.34/share. In
actuality, OVTI beat the street by $0.02/share on earnings.

Gross Income = Revenue
Total Earnings = Revenue less Expenses – what’s left over is most important

Earnings are what rules and dictates a company’s health. If the earnings per
share increases, the company is doing very well. In OVTI’s case, the revenue
miss between Wall Street Revenue forecast of $102 Million and the actual $99.7
Million is mute since the earnings are greater on the actual lower amount than
the projected forecast amount

BMY. I suspect it might be going even further into the valley of down.
Eventually though, it'll climb back up. (I hope.) Maybe in three years. Maybe
five. How high from lows I do not know. In any case, I'd not buy now,
especially not BMY. I have a small position and while I'm very tempted - like
every single trading day - to sell and move on, I have continued to hold. This
could apply to almost all the old drug companies: I'm in 'em, earnings look
lousy, pipelines are iffy, and the outlook ain't rosy.

There's got to be better bets out there. Where one can do some handicapping of
the company vs. expected future events. BMY's been a powerhouse, but going
forward, how can one see much positive?

Stocks you might like:

ABC - pharma distribution, recent weakness due to Cardinal fallout. PE around

operating cost than MCK and I believe maybe CAH as well.

Viab: media powerhouse with strong FCF (Yield around 5%). Management overhaul
has brought stock under pressure, but recent results show excellent execution
nevertheless. Trading at the lower end of P/CF valuation ratio.

WPI: generic and branded pharmaceutical company. Trading for 2x sales. PE
around 14. Solid balance sheet. They had their ups and down before but always
came back

PRE: Reinsurance company. Historically has averaged 15% ROI over 10 years.

TSM: The biggest and most profitable Semi foundry. Excellent balance sheet and
high profitability. Clean accounting and low stock option expenses. The
business is cyclical but growing. Excellent earnings report. Trading at around
12x earnings.

All these stocks are trading near their 521 week lows.
