Hi Spekulatius -

RE: Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB); Cheniere Energy Partners, LP Ch (AMEX:
CQP); BreitBurn Energy Partners, L.P.(NasdaqGS: BBEP)

I have a small position in WMB that I bought 9/29/2009 at $18.25/share. It may
be one I might want to add to again. It's selling under it's 200 day MA of
$25.00/share which is my initial short term price target. However, as you
stated, their Midstream operation looks fairly cheap and if NG prices run
higher the stock could test their 2007-2008 valuation levels of
$35/share-$40.00/share more than a double from current levels.

I did not realize they owned so many acres in the Marcellus shale area. Their
land assets are a good way of owning potential reserves while their cash flow
generators (Midstream and pipeline operations) bring in the money. I originally
bought them for their Gas Pipeline segment and their Midstream gas gathering
business.

Two new MLP's that I am looking at are Cheniere Energy Partners, LP Ch (AMEX:
CQP) and BreitBurn Energy Partners, L.P. (NasdaqGS: BBEP).
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CQP,BBEP&d=s

Both have had a good run and each generate good cash flow. Paul has mentioned
BEEP on this board but I have not seen anyone discuss CQP.

I am looking at selling some of my recent utility gainers and starting a
position in each of the MLP's. They generate good income and have a possible up
side of 10%-15%. CQP also has the ability to increase their distributions once
they ramp up their receiving terminal LNG volume.
http://www.cheniereenergypartners.com/presentation/CQP_July_2009.pdf

CQP plays into the LNG theme. Chevron and Total SA (TOT) are each 25% partners
with 20 year Terminal Use contracts valued at $252 Million. Therefore the MLP
cash flows s/b pretty stable. It's sort of like a midstream pipeline
distribution business but the distribution hub is around a terminal rather than
gathering tanks out in the field.

I like the reoccurring revenues that a distribution operation generates. It's
consistent and not really affected by the price of the commodity. Revenues
increase as volumes increase and as you expand the overall system capacity.

What possible downsides do you see in any of these MLPs?

re MLP's - I would be careful with MLP's. investors are hunting for yields so
naturally the MLp's have been discovered. However those MLP's are very
dependent on credit markets (or thee spreads) that are at almost record lows. I
think the MLP's mimic the bond bubble. I would not advice putting new money in
this sector.

TOT is a great yield play, better than utility stocks at this point. I have a
full position but would not hesitate adding some more. Their last quarter
results were stellar. A few European utility stocks have been decimated too
(Atomsteuer - an extra tax on nuclear power plant fuel) but they are dirt cheap
and pay big dividends (RWE.DE, EONGY).

re WMB - I think it's a great asset play but the return on investment in the
E&P sector is just plain awfull. it's just another example to show that all
those NPV and IRR calculations don't add up. For example in one of those
presentations, they go through the economics of a Piceance well (P18) and get a
44% IRR after tax.:

http://www.williams.com/investors/docs/Morgan_Stanley_Energy_Ideas_Conference.p
f

Sound great but how come their whole E&P only made 500M$ annualized (pre tax)
on 10.4B$ of assets (per latest quarterly report)? That is 5% pretax and does
not earn WMB's cost of capital, which is around 7% currently. Apparently with
this IRR calculations, they forget to allocate, cooperate overhead, the
interest cost (it often costs 5 years with interest on capital outlay racking
up until all wells are drilled and the IRR is based on average cost etc. etc.).
This applies to many E&P's not just WMB.

I wish WMB would spin off the E&P or let it go into runoff mode, pay back some
high yield debt and build on their pipeline business which earns about 10%
return on assets and is lower risk.

Hi EKS. My turnover will be higher than usual this year. My accounts aren't set
up to where I can calculate the percentage though.
Since I tell myself I look to generally keep stocks 18-36 mo., and I'm a big
believer in diversifying by time too, I suspect I might have turnover about
33%-50%.

Pretty hard to lose money in anything bought early '09 and held. In taxable
accounts, that gives capital gains for these stocks harvested in '10. I've been
doing that. I have a lot of capital loss carryovers from '09; this makes it
much easier to sell stocks which have short-term gains and long-term gains.
Having these carryovers, I just find I'm much quicker to sell stocks recently
bought if I have a small profit in them in this volatile market, than to hold
on to them. Plus, I've got enough dividends this year in my taxable account now
to where I don't want more, so that gives me some impetus to sell
preferreds/reits/utilities held there.

I'm also refocusing my stocks somewhat similar to you. For sure I'm increasing
my positions in dink e&p companies. I'm not looking to buy any more MLP's
though. If the one's I have (e.g. Tortoise, BWP) drop enough, I'll add.
I've sold utility stocks and will sell more if/as they hit new highs. For most
of the gas/electric utility stocks I have, I don't see the attraction with the
stocks close to highs and if they have yields at only 3.5-4%. I'd rather be in
bond funds with 7-8% yields in my ira's. I intend to still keep water utility
stocks, s l o w growers that they are.
There seems to be a good number of large cap stocks that are selling near 12-mo
lows. I'm looking in that sector as a place to into which I might move monies.
(Well Fargo stock, for example, being a recent start for me)

Euro net earnings during Q2. Net debt for the industrial part (no counting the
financing business) is about 3B Euro. Total market cap is ~ 27B Euro (amongst

this offering is overpriced.

I think they should do something novel like a discount coupon attached to each
share that you can add up to get a discount on the purchase price of a GM
vehicle (up to a certain %tage of purchase price). This would get some interest
for individual investors and might even get more people in the showroom.

re E_K_S / GMXR.
Intersting angle on GMXR Midstream business. I think there is indeed some
hidden value, but the asset should already be on GMXR balance sheet at cost. I
think it would probably fetch more than that if sold ,and that the differential
would be value that could be unlocked.

I still wonder if we overlooked something with GMXR. one thing I noted are the
high G&A expenses of 1.44$/MCFE while the much larger peer CHK ( which I do not
even consider a low cost operator) stands at 0.34$. Even accounting for the
difference in size,that is a huge difference and the real reason for GMXR's
lack of profitability.

I wonder what the reason for the high G&A expenses is, 1.44$/MCFE is a lot of
money if you need to sell for 5$/MCFE. Certainly, based on the proved reserves
they have in the ground, GMXR is cheap, with a valuation of <1$/MCFE proved and
that not even counts the undeveloped part and the land.

Are you a USAA member? Take $750 off. Are you a GM employee or GM employee
"friend" or family member? Special pricing for you. Do you work for a supplier
company to GM? Special pricing for you too. (Not saying these "special prices"
are worth anything now though with end-of-model year discounts and overall
discounts off list. Sometimes they very well are worth taking advantage of
though, if you qualify and want a GM product.)

Just sour grapes on my part. I guess good car shoppers would deal from invoice
price, not list price, so these discounts from list would possibly be
irrelevant. Still for me, knowing these "discounts" abound for which I don't
qualify, it's one more reason I have a bad feeling about GM when I'm looking to

Hi Spekulatius

Re: GMXR

It's possible that one or more of their hedges went sour and this was a one
time event that impacted their MCFE expense calculation. I do know that their
midstream business has value as they already sold a 40% interest to KMR. There
was some mention that they also have extra capacity and there was some
discussion to solicit third party "gathering" contracts which would be
additional revenue to ad to the current stream.

On the negative side, the bank lowered their line of credit a bit to account
for the equity interest in their Midstream subsidiary they sold ($36 million)
to KMR.

It's a moving target on revenues and expenses. The market seems to think the
stock is still over valued but I suspect the tide will turn especially as NG
prices rise.

My strategy is to accumulate shares at prices below $4.50/share. I get their
gathering business worth $1.91/share and the rest of the company for
$2.50/share. I am buying the assets "in-the-ground" for at least a 50% discount
to market even if I account for their carrying cost of the borrowed money.

This seems like a pretty good deal as long as Mr. Market eventually sees the
same long term value.

Hi Dale -

The Morningstar analysis seems to show a 200% base when measuring Sector
percentages for the S&P 500 vs the test portfolio. I am not sure why it does
this as the data I enter are my stocks and the % value they make up in the
portfolio (total is 100%).

I also do not generally agree with the way they categorize some of the
holdings. It appears that some of my natural resource companies are categorized
as Industrial Materials and a few of my Technology companies (HON,GLW) are
classified in their Manufacturing Sector. Shipping may be put in their Service
categories.

If you just divide by 2 for the S&P benchmark and also of the test portfolio
you can calculate the percentage based on 100%. This is useful as I can tell
where I am over weighted to the S&P category.

I also noticed that the portfolio dividend yield was off too. It seems to not
calculate the Preferred stock dividends correctly so I would not take their
calculation(s) "as fact".

It does provide me an interesting over view of the portfolio and allows me to
see what asset classes I might be too concentrated in. I thought I had a large
utility exposure and oil exposure (the analysis showed 6% & 15% respectively).
I actually may want more oil exposure.

With my next quarter sells and purchases, I will do the same X-Ray analysis and

Been in ERF for several years ('06-'09 buys). One of my biggest losers
currently. Is what happens more times than I like when I reach way up for yield
and the distribution subsequently gets cut.

I continue to hold, will follow you now though with a bit more in after-hours
today. I like ERF's positioning itself in the unconventional shales, esp. for
oil.
Aside: Holding ERF currently in an ira, so not able to get the foreign tax
credit. (It amounts to about 15% of the distribution.) Have made new buy now in
a taxable account. (Just to get the tax credit, although it seems useless to me
now, because I've already got more credits than I can use for taxes on
"offsettable" income. Hence these credits just get carried over.)
===========================
I don't like the Marcellus, and I try to avoid companies that are concentrated
there. Marcellus is primarily gas; gas prices are in a downtrend. (It's a
seasonal effect "they say".) To me, there's a glut or will be with all these
unconventional drilling operations. I'd read in past that when glut happens,
the companies aren't profitable or profitable enough, and so they stop
drilling. Otoh, I've also read recently that some of these newer leases are
held with the contractual requirement that drilling must proceed within a
certain time or the drilling rights revert back to the land owner. Canada or
maybe it's just one of the provinces, has a policy (or so I read again) that
they give some land to drillers with the proviso that the drillers will drill,
and then they get to keep the drilling rights. And if they don't drill and
produce gas (or oil), the land leases revert back to the gov't. So this gives
the drillers an incentive to drill even at unprofitable prices so that they can
continue to control desirable acreage that will be valuable if/when gas prices
increase.

Hi Paul

RE: ERF & PWE

I have been harvesting my losses and buying back after 31 days. Therefore, it's
not really an add but basically reducing my average cost basis. I then use the
losses to off set my stellar gains. It's not the best way to work a stock but
at the right price (ie cost basis) both PWE & ERF are good core positions to
hold.

From their presentation ERF has 7-10 years of reserves that can be used to make
the current distributions even if nothing is replaced. My strategy is to use
this as a parking space for capital (as long as my cost basis is low) and then
from time to time I can peel off shares if I need a source of funds.

I will be adding TOT tomorrow as I believe they go x-dividend. I have been
picking through my stocks to build a sell list and am really working hard to
pull the trigger on several winning positions that are in fair value territory.
The decision is difficult as (1) I have good profits that I need to book, (2)
they are still ok "buys" but not as good when I originally bought, (3) I have
identified some new buy candidates but I think I will get better entry points
in the future. So do you sell now or just wait?

Therefore my new strategy is to make several partial sells now similar to when
I create a new position, park the cash in some steady high yield equity (or
fund) for 30-90 days and eventually I hope to get several good buying
opportunities that will allow me to establish some new "value" buys in out of
favor sectors. If I need a source of funds, I can then peel off shares from one
or more of my parking high yield funds (ERF, PWE, PVX, TPZ, or PFD). Note: All
of these funds in my list pay their distribution monthly which is good for my
cash flow needs. I believe you even posted a few high yield bond funds you are
using in a similar manner.

A new screen on my Schwab Street Smart Pro allows me to sort my positions by
"Dividend Yield" so I can actively monitor my positions w/ this sort key in
mind. I also use the PE field as a secondary sort so I can also apply a "value"

I'll continue to hold EGN. I'll look at their upcoming presentation to see if I
can glean some further information. When I bought this stock, it was because it
had a utility component and an unregulated component (the bigger piece). Having
the unregulated business justified to me EGN's very low dividend yield compared
to other utilities. Although I guess now, comparing its regulated portion to
other regulated gas utilities, it's similar (and has "28 years of dividend
growth").

I'm looking to buy oil producers. Gas producers, I'm generally staying away
from. It's good to see EGN's acquisition is mostly for light oil, and that the
bulk of EGN's capital expenditures is going to oil now. Seems like all these
companies are going that direction (toward oil, away from gas) if they can.

Aside:
I'm self-taught in evaluating these e&p companies, I've come to the sector just
recently, and I have no real-world business experience regarding. So I feel
I've got a lot to learn. Also I worry that I'm on shaky ground in that I may
know just enough to get me in a lot of trouble with stock buys here (and not
know enough to know when to extricate myself).
I cannot seem to evaluate gas in the ground: These conversions to "barrels of
oil equivalents" with gas confuse me .... So I ignore this (-g- uh oh!)
All this as prelude my analysis of the pending EGN acquisition. Imo, EGN got a
most excellent deal. I value the oil component to be worth $310M dollars based
on the announced reserves they are acquiring. They paid $185M for the whole
kaboodle. EGN says they are a "proven, low cost acquirer" of assets. Perhaps
so, but this is a deal which I find so good that that I also find it somewhat
unsettling. It may just be me who is using unrealistic multiplier factors to
come up with the worth of assets in the ground. Which means since I'm using
these metrics elsewhere to make e&p stock buys, then I may very well be buying
e&p oil stocks by calculating they're worth a lot more than they actually are
(at least to a knowledgeable/strategic acquirer).

STO, Yes, I don't understand it either. But I did read it.

I read the report in a magazine article in a library today, and later, all the
time I was driving home and then around the house, I was wondering how is that
such a positive for STO, if oil is priced in dollars? Dollar falls, oil price
rises, so labor in Swedish krona what, the same? So Statoil profits more? If
dollar becomes cheaper, dollar-based companies have less expensive labor.
Statoil biggest retail seller of gasoline in Poland, if I read correctly.
Something to do with the zloty vis-a-vis oil pricing or the US dollar? STO has
operations in a lot of other countries too. So how much could the krona be so
significant or relevant?

I decided way too many variables or implications for me to see what that
Norwegian currency benefit could be or would be or is. So the krona base is not
the reason or a reason I'd be a buyer/holder of the stock.

Spekulatius, it seems from your examples you're preference is the larger, more
established E&P companies. I hold shares of MDU, NBL, EOG, CSCTF.pk, PBR. (And
TOT and XOM, CVX, etc.). I have PBKEF.pk, but there's not much public history
on that one. Just letting them percolate in my portfolio, and I haven't run
numbers on them recently to see if they are buys now based on their assets. I
also have a few shares of SU and a very outsize (large) losing position in
ATPG. Not sure these latter two would be considered E&P companies because they
say they don't take on exploration (E) risk. Development and production risk,
yes, but the exploration risk has been done by someone else previously.

My focus is small E&P companies. They may be undervalued or not depending if
I'm adequately evaluating reserves and production (which I may not be
adequately doing). As far as being "solid buys", I do not know. I suspect not.
I believe though that somebody now buying a package of these that might be in

EPD. Spekulatius, for a different way to play the E&P's, I'm looking at limited
partnership EPD (mentioned by EKS as being in Tortoise fund). Stock prices of
limited partnerships have risen of course, and distribution yields have fallen
even as distributions may have increased. EPD yields 6.2% per Yahoo.

Tiernan Ray in Barron's today wrote:

"Overall, the easy money for the moment may have been had (edit: referring to
energy MLPs), given that money has been flooding into the sector, with 12% and
25% increase in dollar volume in Q2 and now in Q3, respectively. The money’s
been chasing MLPs because of low rates (versus high cash flow yields for MLPs)
and because MLP distributions are taxed at ordinary income rates, unlike stock
dividends.
But weak GDP expectations could keep cash flow growth at the MLPs “muted” in
coming months, in general. Longer term, Durbin is still favorably disposed
toward MLPs, as the dividend tax issue should continue to push some investors
into the MLPs. Moreover, if the Bush tax cuts “sunset” this year, it could add
12 percentage points to MLPs’ relative returns, he believes...
At the same time, Durbin (edit: Goldman Sachs analyst Theodore Durbin) raised
price targets across the board, with his “Buy”-rated picks Sunoco Logistics
(SXL) rising to an $87 price target from $80, and Enterprise Products Partners
(EPD) rising to a $41 target from $38.
But Durbin’s strongest pick of the bunch is actually diversified pipeline
operator Spectra Energy (SE)."

In looking at these companies in library articles, I found that one analyst
said about SXL: it has the "highest quality from a price performance
measurement". Again, here too, I shake my head, not understanding what his
statement means. -g- (And SXL appears too expensive for me anyway.)

About EPD it was written, it's in a lot of "developing energy areas". I looked,
and I like what I see. Apparently as a midstream energy mlp, its goal is to
earn fees at every link of the value chain. It's in three areas where there's
E&P activity: Haynesville, Barnett, and Eagle Ford (I like Eagle Ford!). So EPD
should profit whoever explores and produces in these developing areas. I'm
considering EPD as a conservative buy and hold.

That said EPD is a class act - they have a lover burden from GP "taxes" than

is too expensive with 12.3X EBITDA. If I were to value WMB like that, i would
get the their complete E&P division for free. And something like this might
happen - all these gassers, pipeline companies and gas utilities will spin off

re E&P - I agree that a lot of money can be made with E&P but I have a hard
time to tell the winners from the loosers. I do seem to recall the looser's
better than the winners - there was DPTR, DBLE and many other flameouts. There
is always a new crop of E&P's around to ignite excitement - IOC, MHR are the
ones currently. So I tend to stick more with what I know - value companies
based on proved reserves in the ground.

The way I see it, small E&P's do well when crude prices are rising - they their
reserves increase in value, they can borrow more, create more value. The same
feedback look works in reverse in a deflationary environment which we had in
2008 and 2009 and may have again right now. In this environment, only the cost
leader thrive - companies like EOG, UPL, XTO.

So I think for a small E&P, the management is more important than the perceived
quality of assets. A good management will probably find good assets to explore
while a mediocre or outright bad one will botch it even if they happen to sit
on good assets. But how do you find a good management before it's obvious to
everybody else based on their track record?

What I like to do for example is to look in presentations from good companies
with strong management teams and learn about other companies in comparative
studies. For example UPL had a nice chart showing reserve growth/share over a
couple of years (P. 6) :
http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9NTc2OTd8Q2hpbGRJRD0t
XxUeXBlPTM=&t=1

GMXR for example shows at the bottom of the barrel with a reserve
shrinkage/share of over 10% annualized. Together with the fact that I pointed
out about the G&A costs running at around 1.5$/MCFE, with not much indication
of economies of scale; I don't really think that GMXR is worthy of an
investment (maybe a Spekulation <g>).

Anyways, NG looks like a hopeless case with a shear endless supply of potential
shale plays lined up. it's going to be hard to make money selling NG is North
America for all but the lowest cost operators since any slight rise in NG
prices will bring a new shale in play that would otherwise be non-economical.

As for the oily plays, I sort of like NXY amongst he bigger players with
somewhat solid base operation and as an option kicker large oil sand holdings
that may be great if crude goes higher. GEOI does not seem to be that cheap but
seems to be a good one to keep an eye on since they are still small and
executing well, as far as I can tell.

re BAC, WFC - I decided to sell of my starter in BAC for a small loss and put
funds into WFC. My rationale is simple - WFC and BAC are valued similar with
respect to any metric (PE, balance sheet size, except the tangible book value
mutiple ; WFC trades at a 1.5x tangible book while BAC at 1.05x. Against BAC
counts that investment banking, which is not a business I am very fond off is a
substantial part of BAC business nowadays. Even worse is that Merrill Lynch has
time and again shown that they are a chumps on Wall Street, so if I really
wanted to own a Bank_ investment bank at the same time, I could as well buy

FWIW, i noticed you posted about WFC on the Buffettology thread as well, of
course because he owns WFC stock. However I think the classical Buffet bank
stock would be BK (I bought a few more shares today) since this is a high ROE
operation (fee based business) with a real moat. Unfortunately right now the
their business isn't growing much and earnings just get boosted by cost

not too much of a wager here. Well at least I hope not...

One of the things I'm trying to do is bet on the Bakken. The Bakken shale and
Bakken stocks don't get mentioned much on SI. Maybe that's a sign it's still
early.

I am convinced a LOT of money is going to be made in buying stocks in this
shale. However, I have a lot of issues.
1. I've been convinced of many things in my life, some related to the stock
market or stocks, and I found my "convinced" has turned out to be inaccurate or
false. I just have been wrong so many, many times.
2. I ask myself, if I am so convinced about the Bakken and thus Bakken stocks,
just how much of my portfolios should I commit or am I willing to risk on these
stocks? And even more importantly for me (given my
age/lifestyle/needs/wants/current overall portfolio size, etc.), I wrestle with
what is the point of taking such a risk?

Anyway, as I find E&P's that may have Bakken leases I check them all (looked at
PETD tonight), find a few that I like, and buy shares. (I reiterate, I'm no
expert in evaluating E&P companies, and I'm not saying I buy every E&P Bakken
stock solely or even primarily on strict analytical methodology.)

==========================================
Okay, if GEOI doesn't seem that cheap to you, of course you skip it and move on
to something else. As I mentioned here previously, management - if you believe
them - has stated their net asset value is $22/sh. on proved reserves. And the
stock price is a bit now above $14. My scribbled notes show that they cost
their Bakken land at $1000/acre. The Bakken can be fairly big, and I'm not sure
where their land holdings are relative to other E&P Bakken players, but some
areas of the Bakken now are being leased for $3000/acre. I acknowledge poor
research on my part. And I don't know management's capabilities to deliver
performance. For me the stock overall looks attractive though, and it's one
I've been buying.

----
I'm partial to Denbury (DNR) because it seems to be a specialist in using its
large CO2 reserves for "enhanced oil recovery". I got scared out of some of it
in the stock's fall in '08 (still holding shares from '01), and I'm slowly
adding back shares. I like it at the current price. You might look at Denbury
as a possibility for you.
Imo, it's one stock of a decent company with proven performance that could
continue be a sturdy performer. And it's also moved into the Bakken. So I'm
viewing it very favorably.

"Based upon recent drilling results and technical data in the Bakken area, the
Company has re-evaluated the potential barrels of oil equivalent recoverable
from its approximately 300,000 net acres in the Bakken. Based on these updated
internal engineering estimates, the Company projects its total potential
recoverable BOEs in the Bakken could be approximately 350 MMBOE, of which
approximately 29 MMBOE is considered proved at mid-year 2010..."

DNR may or may not be as good or better a value than GEOI or any other dink one
I'm buying; it seems a lot safer to me though. My DNR buys this year have been
at $18, $17, $16, and $14.44 last month. I catch it below my last price, I'll
add more. Looking here for a five year holding minimum (and some confidence not
to get scared out if/as stock drops perilously again). -g-

The 15$ for crude and 1.5$/MCFE are my values. They may be a little low but
some of the reserves are still not proved, so warrant a discount. TOT for
example trades at about <12$/ BOE proved reserve value (about 1/2 that if you

they have about 10.5B boe proved reserves. Per share, that's 10.5/2.23 = 4.7
boe/sh, which if using 60/40 oil/gas (I'm not sure that's the right split

.4 x 4.7 x 6 x $1.5 = $16.92
.6 x 4.7 x $15 = $42.30

Not bad. I'd add in probable reserves, discount some amount because some of
that oil is in "unstable" countries, add points because the company pays a nice
dividend. All-in-all, not a bad buy for a conservative investor looking for a

Add 13B$ in net debt to the balance sheet but subtract ~9B$ in equity value
(Sanofi, others) plus the value of refinery and chemical business (20B$ in
revenues for the latter, probably worth ~10B$). I think the downstream
operation is ~20-25% of TOT value.

Also keep in mind that TOT even in the upstream sector owns many hard assets
other than just the reserves, tanks, pipelines, LNG facilities, production rigs
etc. while many juniors own virtually nothing since they use rented rigs.

Of course it's easier for GEOI to move the needle - they added 20% to their
reserve base last year - this is much harder to do for TOT of course. But know

their net debt exceeds their cash quite a bit.

Having their cash in Krona while their debt (which exceeds debt) in Krona as
well does not help them at all, in fact it would hurt them.

Again there is no way around that - if you get paid in US$ (as every E&P does

maximize their profit.

I thought conceptionally about the E&P valuation and management efficiency a
bit. One thing is clear - E&P cannot be valued based on their income statement
or PE ratio or EV/EBITDA ratio. The reason for this is simple - the income
statement is misleading because the proved reserves are always booked at cost.
If we stick with a oil company it means that if an E&P incurred 10$ cost to
find a BOE in the ground it would show up as a value of 10$ if the same BOE
would cost 20$ ( a more inefficient operator) it would be valued at 20$. if
course a barrel oil in the ground is a barrel, no matter how much money was
spent to find it and it worth the same, but the balance sheet does not work
that way.

So, the way I look at things, we should forget about the income statement and
just look at BOE rather than $. After all it is the E&P job to find more oil
and eventually lift it and sell as a profit. So if you accept that BOE on the
asset side is the important unit (rather than the arbitary US$ it costs to find
them) then all that matters to calculate the ROA is to find out how much their
reserve base increased during a year. So you essentially compare the prove
reserves/share in Y2009 with the proved reserves Y2008 and the difference is
the profit (in BOE) and the ROE would be BOE [(2009)-BOE (2008)]/BOE(2008).

For simplicity let's assume they paid no dividends and invested all their cash
flow):

Example: A company start up in 2008 with 100m BOE and ends up with 110M BOE .
They now have 10M BOE more than they started out with, so essentially their ROA
(in BOE units) is 10%.

The advantage of this method is that it does not matter how their got their -
one company may have lifted 20M BOE but found 20MBOE new reserves for a net
gain of 10M - another one may just have lifted 10M BOE and used the cash flow
from that and found 20M BOE for a net gain 10M$ as well. Both companies would
be worth the same but they probably would show a vastly different income or
cash flow statement.

Now in most cases, adjustments need to be done for dividend payments and free
cash flow. Those adjustments should be done based on an agreed upon reserve
valuation equivalent (I suggest 15$ for oil and 1.5$ for gas/MCFE

If you look at a few examples (assuming I believe UPL's data) then CHK is a
company with a lousy management because they have accomplished only a 4%
reserve growth annualized over then years while paying minuscule dividends. UPL
has grown their reserve base/share by 20% annualized so it's a vastly higher
ROA company. Interesting enough CHK has much higher lower cash flow ratios and
lower PE's so based on their income statement, they look much cheaper. What
happens of course that most of this cash flow is blown back into operations to
find new resources and it costs them about twice as much to do that than UPL.

So, I think I have explained that in a rather clumsy manner, but for me that
was sort of a revaluation so i wanted to put it down. Hopefully somebody else
finds my reasoning useful.

Your valuation seems to me to combine production and reserves.

I like to value the companies both, but separately

On their flowing production, and I like to value the companies on their
reserves. For reserves I'll take proved and probable barrels. Alternative
2pnpv10 if the company provides it.
===========================
If your 100mm boe company lifted 10mm boe and didn't report that reserves were
replaced by 10mm boe, that would seem to result in a negative roe number. And
if they lifted say 12 mm boe the following year from a 90mm reserve base
remaining and still didn't announce new reserves, that would be a further
negative both in that roe is negative and the company seems to be depleting
itself as well. I view it a a positive though in that the company is increasing
its production (flowing production from 10mm to 12). And I just will assume
that the revenue generated is either being reinvested in the business or
distributed to shareholders. Perhaps your method would make adjustments for
free cash flow, but I don't know how to do that satisfactorily.

Perhaps what you are suggesting is maybe a good way to evaluate one e&p company
against another.

We have different interests here. For me, I'm looking for a quick easy method,
that while perhaps inaccurate, is good enough. Good enough to cause me to
believe the particular company is undervalued. Not necessarily to determine if
it's a better value or that it has better management efficiency than any other
e&p company. This view can work for me, perhaps not for anyone else though,
because I'm willing to hold a couple dozen e&p companies in my portfolio. So
I'm not so concerned in limiting myself by picking only what appears to be the
best of the best.

Hello Paul,
my thesis is that flowing production is irrelevant. If we talk about a
situation where a company invests it's entire cash flow and does not pay any
dividends (if one of both would occur an adjustment to the reserve base would
be made of an agreed upon value of the reserves) then it does not matter if a
company just sits on reserves and does nothing or another company lifts 10% of
their reserves and invests the cash flow but achieves nothing else but
replacing production. Both would end up with the same reserve base after a year
except that in the first case, the company does essentially nothing, while in
the second case they have been keeping the rig owners happy but added no
economic value for their shareholders. In other words, only the owners earnings
count and they would be zero in both cases.

The model has some weakness in the sense that not all reserves are created
equal, but I feel it's better than relying on the income statements to see
where the value is or value is created.

How about trying your thesis value on Coastal Energy?

It's one I've mentioned here before. It also gets some press on other SI sites:

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26779276

Its latest presentation is here:

http://www.coastalenergy.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Corporate%20Presentation
20August%202010.pdf

It gives most of the information I'm looking for. Not all, and not in the
format I'd like, but still, flowing production of oil, flowing production of
gas, 1p+2pnpv10. Also fwiw, company estimate of nav per share. I see 113M
shares fully diluted. I use that and cash = $10M, debt = $3.5M to rough out
enterprise value at C$470M.

For me, the presentation confirms what I've believed to be so from my prior
look at the company: namely, with the metrics I'm using and on the current
approximate enterprise value of the company, that the stock's cheap -- still
cheap enough for a buy for me. I've a few shares, and I added a few more today.

This evaluation all jmo, and of course I could be wrong in a lot of ways (the
metrics I use, the future price of oil or gas, the future behavior of Thailand
toward the company, and so on)

First of all I appreciate you comments here a lot Spek. We have been here
together a long time. Let me know what I may be missing.

Norway the country has no net debt. It is the most fiscally sound developed
country, with natural resources to boot.

As for Statoil:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=STO+Balance+Sheet&annual

They have lots of cash.
They have little debt and what debt they do have is cheap.

A large global oil player based in a country with sound financial fundamentals,
not a terror target and little comparable regulatory risk..I like the bet on
Norway and I like the bet on oil and Statoil covers both and boasts a good trck
record with upside given the above...

re CEN.V - with 470M Can $ (447MUS$) market cap plus 40M Can $ in net debt and
23 BOE proved reserves (2/3 crude and 1/3 gas) the BOE is valued at 21$ which
is not terribly cheap. The 2P reserves are emphasized in their NPV calculations
which i think is a little bit aggressive (2P means that there is a 50% chance
of economic recovery) Their 2P reserves are 2.3X their 1P reserves (typical
value for a mature company is around 2x) so it does not seem that Coastal has a
higher potential for growth than the average crude company. I ignore 3P or
"resource potential" numbers entirely.

Their proved reserves seem to fluctuate - from 18M BOE (2008) to 15M BOE (2009,
the reduction is probably due to lower crude prices). if I take the Y2008
number, I see 18M BOE / 95M shares =0.184 BOE/share in 2008, compared to 23M
BOE/113M shares=0.203 BOE/share in 2010. the balance sheet looks about the same
in.2008 and 2010 ( about 40M Can $ net debt). This get's you a roughly 5%
annualized ROA (based on BOE units).

This all looks pretty mediocre to me. it certainly would not be a buy in my
model. Of course with this kind of company, much depends on exploration success
and this could either way. I cannot predict future results based on past track
records and current reserves but I can say that based on what they accomplished
in the past and what they currently own the stock does not look like a value to
me.

It has been a while since I have seen a stock buyback by a bank. They are
trading at <0.9x tangible book and have been increasing their dividend for a
few years. Currently the stock is yielding close to 5%. NPA seems to have
stabilized. ROA is close to 1%. Reading through the annual reports and
presentations I see indications of a consistent strategy for many years.
Evidence suggests that they know what they are doing.

re CNX (31.2$) - I followed you into CNX for a starter. I sold my small
position in GMXR (4.32$) at a loss to do so and added some funds to make it
worthwhile.

I do like CNX for their exportable coal and their very well managed gas unit
(used to be CXG). This gas unit is a hidden asset so to speak - they were
adding reserves at a 10-15% clip annual. They were naturally active in the
Marcellus shale but exploiting CBM mostly, now they have multiple objective. I
think they can grow reserves nicely - currently those stand at 3TCFE (at least
worth 4.5B$) but I think it's more because they have low finding costs and can
grow reserves quickly over time.

GMXR is cheaper based on their 1$/MCFE reserve valuation but their a destroying
value (~ 1.5$high cost overhead apparently) If I add the excess cost (let's say
1$/MCFE) to GMNXR cost base, GMXR adjusted value is 2$/MCFE, which is not a
great valuation.

I have more ideas than funds to invest right now unfortunately :-(.

Sold out my EEQ position (@ $53.12/share) acquired 12/2008 based on your post (
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25282178&srchtxt=eeq ) at
$19.53/share. I failed to pick up LINE or BBEP two others you found
significantly under valued. BBEP at the time was around $6.00/share and at
$16.50/share still looks interesting.

I concur with you that many of the MLP companies have moved much higher during
the period with investors chasing yield and expectations are now way too high.
Two much risk for me unless I can buy at a significant discount. I will
probably focus on the TPZ Fund but only if I can buy in at a 10% lower price.

I am looking to increase my exposure to Oil & NG companies and plan to start a
position on TOT and add more shares of CNX. Both companies have excellent
proven reserves AND have shown they can replace those reserves over time at a
rate better than the industry average.

The charts for CNX and TOT look like they want to test their LT lows which
could translate into another 18% & 6% decline respectively. We are definitely
much closer to the bottom than the top for these two companies. Therefore, I
will wait for one of those watershed down draft sell offs before adding shares.

In the mean time I am raising funds and taking profits in positions bought
18-36 months earlier especially those companies that may have difficulty in a
slower economic recovery than first expected.

re GS - I kind of start to like it in the Mid 130$ range for an entry. I don't
own it but I think the risk reward is better now than it was before they paid
off the devil with 500M$..
After reading "The big short" I understand the CDO topic a bit better and agree
that the risk to find fraud with GS transactions is much lower. With a CDO
there is a short on the other side of the trade by design - he is the guy who
pays out the small yield premium every year in the hope of getting a huge
payoff when the benchmark bonds default.

This whole CDO business is really a stupid (or devilishly smart depending on
your point of view) construction allowing to clone financial risk in same bonds
multiple (actually infinite #) of times. Those things belong gambling casino
but banks that have access to anything related to government funds, deposits,
FEd windows should not allow to own this kind of stuff or anything having a
close resemblance. it sort of makes me wonder if it's worth investing anything
in the financial sector, given the risk of a black swan colony coming our way.

One last thing, whoever reads " The big short" carefully, should notice that
Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are at much higher risk of getting sued
successfully than GS. You can take that to your bank. LOL.

A Google search turns to a few links for as low as 43$ - i do not know if this

card - they are very good at protecting you from fraud one call is enough.

I also got an offer through email "Dion's Fidelity Independent Adviser" from

BPO too tough for me.

Yield is 4%.

From Barron's couple weeks ago, "Citigroup analyst Michael Bilerman raised his
rating on the stock to “Buy” from “Hold” with a $16.50 price target, up from
$15, echoing the thoughts of Stifel Nicolaus analyst John Guinee, who last
Wednesday also upgraded the stock."

Stock is $14.50.

What's the attraction for an investment in BPO vs. other stuff that's out
there, that look either safer or that have better capital gains prospects (or
so it seems to me, anyway)?

And a question always is, how long would you be in for?

=========
About what's relevant in evaluating performance of these real estate companies
and BPO in particular, I'll defer to others on the thread who are more
knowledgeable and/or have a better record with these type stocks.
