AMCE is pretty much an empty shell. Its a bet-the-jockey type play that I have
been trading for years. Historically, anytime its fallen to these prices its
proven to be a good buy.

And book will be closer to $1.90 after the IVCO merger goes through.

One of these days, AMCE will complete some kind of reverse merger or aquisition
that will deliver lots of value to shareholders. And it trades BELOW CASH with
no recurring significant cash burn.

SoftNet Systems, Inc. Reports Fiscal 2001 Year End Results
SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 28, 2001--SoftNet Systems, Inc.
(NASDAQ:SOFN - news), today announced that revenue from continuing operations
for the year ended September 30, 2001 was $4.2 million compared to $9.9 million
for the previous year. Net loss per share for the year ended September 30,
2001, from continuing operations was $2.16, versus a net loss of $0.87 per
share a year ago. SoftNet had a net loss of $57,647,000, or a net loss per
share of $2.31, for the year ended September 30, 2001, compared to a net loss
of $232,353,000, or a net loss per share of $9.88, for the year ended September
30, 2000.

As of September 30, 2001, cash and short-term investments totaled $75.4
million, compared to $172.1 million on September 30, 2000. This decrease was
primarily caused by the discontinuance of ISP Channel, Aerzone, and corporate
restructuring. These costs primarily included settlement of liabilities,
severance and contract termination payments, offset by proceeds from the sale
of assets.

Discontinued Operations

SoftNet recognized a $4,898,000 loss attributed to discontinued operations for
the year ended September 30, 2001, compared to $211,799,000 for the year ended
September 30, 2000. For the year ended September 30, 2001, the loss
attributable to discontinued operations consisted of a $10,008,000 gain due to
the revision of the loss on disposition of ISP Channel, resulting from lower
than anticipated costs of closing ISP Channel, and a $14,906,000 loss on
disposition of Aerzone, resulting primarily from the reduction of the estimated
sales proceeds of Laptop Lane. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the loss
attributable to discontinued operations consisted of a loss on disposition of
ISP Channel of $97,200,000, a net loss from the operations of ISP Channel of
$60,249,000, a loss on disposition of Aerzone of $42,200,000, and a net loss
from the operations of Aerzone of $12,150,000.

Continuing Operations

While SoftNet is currently exploring strategic options, SoftNet currently
conducts its continuing operations through its wholly owned subsidiary,
Intelligent Communications, Inc. (``Intellicom''), which provides two-way
broadband satellite connectivity utilizing very small aperture terminal
(``VSAT'') technology to a wide variety of business customers. Although
Intellicom has grown in the Latin American marketplace, Intellicom has
sustained losses since its acquisition on February 9, 1999. In an effort to
reduce Intellicom losses, SoftNet initiated an overall cost cutting program and
organizational restructuring during the year ended September 30, 2001, which
includes the elimination of certain departments and closure of selected
offices.

For the year ended September 30, 2001, Intellicom recorded a decrease in
consolidated net sales of $5,750,000, or 58%, to $4,177,000 for the year ended
September 30, 2001, compared to net sales of $9,927,000 for the year ended
September 30, 2000. Net sales from Intellicom's core business of
satellite-based Internet services increased $1,373,000, or 122%, to $2,498,000
for the year ended September 30, 2001, as compared to $1,125,000 for the year
ended September 30, 2000.

Additionally, SoftNet recognized a gain of $1,326,000 for the year ended
September 30, 2001, as a result of the payment made to settle SoftNet's
obligations to former Intellicom stockholders.

SoftNet's Future

SoftNet's Board of Directors continues to evaluate options for the future
strategic direction of SoftNet. As previously announced, the Board of Directors
has expanded the scope of its exploration of strategic options to include
merger partners that may not make immediate use of SoftNet's net operating
losses.

Acting Chairman Edward A. Bennett said, ``The Board of Directors of SoftNet
continues to explore options for the future direction of the Company, and
expects to make a decision within the next 90 days. When a decision is made, it
will be disclosed to the shareholders, and appropriate actions, including, if
necessary, a stockholder vote, will be taken.''

rjm2, if you take the fourth quarter operating loss and adjust it for non cash
charges and add in the interest income, the net burn approximated $3.5 million.

I think that it is going to take a bit of time for the company to complete its
cleanup and sell off the shell.

As of September 30, SOFN was liable for future minimum lease payments of $10.7
million and had the following outstanding litigation:

Legal Proceedings

On September 26, 2001, Lucent Technologies Inc. ("Lucent") brought action
against the Company, alleging that the Company breached a contract by
failing to purchase Lucent's shares in Freewire Networks, Inc. and claiming
damages of approximately $3.5 million, which may be subject to increase
over time. The Company continues to believe that Lucent's claims are
without merit and will be contested vigorously.

On November 9, 2001, Nokia, Inc. ("Nokia") commenced an action in San
Francisco Superior Court against the Company and Aerzone alleging breach of
contract arising out of the Aerzone's proposed operations in certain
airports. Nokia seeks approximately $2.1 million in damages. The Company
believes that Nokia's claims are without merit and will be contested
vigorously.

The Company is also involved in other legal proceedings and claims, which
arise in the ordinary course of its continuing and discontinued businesses.
The Company believes the results of the above noted legal proceedings,
other pending legal proceedings and claims are not expected to have a
material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition
or cash flows.

Some tax-loss sales.

Looks like I'll end the year up in all but one of my portfolios. This year,
errors in my losing portfolio were brought about by:

1. Buying into tech stock hype, riding some stocks up, and all the way down.
Down was lower than my buy price.

2. Failing to sell stock near highs. Failing to add to a losing stock position
when stock was at low...

3. ... failing to recognize low point for stock ...

4. ... wrongly guessing low point for a stock, adding to position thus
compounding the loss.

5. Not finding arbitrage plays in '01. They seemed to be plentiful in '00 (and
so added to '00's performance).

6. Picking stocks that were cheap, assuming a business and/or stock price
recovery that never happened. (My patience level with the stocks I've been
selling seems to have been 18-36 months.)

I also have as a partial explanation, and not as an error in method or tactics:
Riding a position in a stock to large gains over several years, holding on to
the stock which then creates an oversized position in the portfolio. As the
stock drops from previous year, the large position magnifies effect of drop on
portfolio value year-over-year comparison.
---------------------------------------
Overall, what sticks out most to me this year is that I likely may have a real
problem in that I seem to be in EVERY company that subsequently discloses
serious accounting shenanigans that then destroy stockholder value. Some
examples would be Aremissoft (AREME), CLRNE, ENE, and now perhaps CHEZ too.
Looks to me like the only one I avoided was ACLN Ltd.(ASW).
I do not know how to defend against this except by maintaining well-diversified
portfolios.
---------------------------------
There were swings in the market, and my portfolios weren't immune to them. At
one point I was in the curious position of having all my portfolios' values
below previous year's values, yet at the same time all my taxable accounts for
this year showed me having both net long term taxable gains as well as net
short term taxable gains.

I decided to sell some deep-in-the-red losers to offset capital gains. Most
were sold yesterday. Following is a list, fwiw. These stocks were all mentioned
and bought by me. I hope nobody else has bought or held on for losses! I still
have positions in all of these stocks (except GX), but my first batches that
were bought in '00, '99, or earlier, are now gone. Also 1/2 of '01's AREME:

How do you correct for 2/3/ and 6? This was a market where many stocks which
had declined 75% declined another 80-90% thereafter. I sure would like to for
my own portfolio, which was devestated by the telecom supplier disaster. I
certainly did not have any insight or foresight that that industry or its share
prices would decline as heavily as it did or the clecs for that matter. I now
have a significant portfolio of penny stocks all of which used to sell for over
$20 in the 1999-2000 era, so far only UCOMA has shown any significant recovery
it is now down only about 70% from my first purchase of it.
of the stocks you mentioned I continue to hold LDP. in a tax advantaged account
as selling it at a tremendous loss offers no tax advantage and it was paying
quite a good yield at these levels. I may have to hold this one many years but
so be it.
With respect to accounting problems- My bitter experience continues to be- if
you know there is one -get out and stay out as the magnitude is usually
impossible to ascertain.
2001 has taught me that I know even less than I thought, and that corporate
integrity leaves a lot to be desired.

Hi Madharry.

I see three components:

Recognizing that it's time to consider making a decision about a stock one
owns.

Choosing the decision to be made. The choices being:
add more (when stock is down), sell some at loss, sell out completely, or do
nothing.
Or if the stock is up- add some or sell some or sell all. Or do nothing

Having the will & resources to take action.

I believe that investors can improve the recognition aspect by being alert. For
me, the recognition cues come almost randomly from external sources. Three
examples are:
One notices that insiders are buying or insiders are selling one's stock.
Articles in the media. For example, if one reads that Marty Whitman or another
value investor one respects is starting a position or re-affirming his
confidence in a downtrodden stock that one already owns.
From people on this thread. People who one day say they're getting into or
they're getting out of a particular stock that one already owns. That’s a clue.
Or if the stock is discussed and yet there’s no positive response from posters,
that could be a sign that value investors don’t see the value to the stock.

In these cases there's an assist not only in bringing about an awareness that a
decision might be appropriate, but also what that decision might be (buy or
sell).

In general, my opinion is that everyone (except Buffett, Munger, and maybe(?)
one person on this thread) has losses. Losses cannot be avoided, and so they
must be expected. In other words, there will be mistakes made in the "choosing"
decision – mistakes that can't be corrected. Imo, that's a reason for having a
well-diversified portfolio – I believe diversity is important in mitigating
disasters that occur with a few stocks.

Sometimes the correction decision is to wait for the turnaround. At some point,
if it doesn't happen, then the stock has to be sold. Dr. Graham picked 2 years
for net-nets. So I arbitrarily decided to capture a tax offset by selling some
stocks that I owned about 2 years where I still didn't see the recovery.
(As regards LDP in particular, I otherwise find it attractive here, and will
likely add back to my position in 31 days if the stock remains below 5.)

Perhaps ’02 will be a good year for stocks, especially value stocks. I am
hopeful!

I used sales proceeds to establish new positions in GEHL and CBE today.

I categorize Gehl Co. as a small-cap cyclical company that's in the lousy end
of its cycle. I am hoping that construction/agricultural equipment - Gehl's
products - will once again have good customer demand. If/when that happens, I'd
expect the company once again to sell at book value or higher. Book value has
been steadily rising, and now it's close to $20/sh; the stock's at $14.90
today.
I'm buying because of insider transactions. If I understand/interpret the story
correctly (and I'm not saying I do), a large investor (CIC Equity Partners),
frustrated in its inability to force Mr. Gehl and management to take action to
increase shareholder value, sold its stake to another investor, Neuson AG, for
$20/sh.
Neuson apparently at least once before made an offer to acquire GEHL, but was
rebuffed. Neuson now has about 13% of GEHL. I will believe they are buying GEHL
stock because they either expect to participate in a cyclical recovery of the
business or else they perhaps again will make a run at GEHL itself.

CBE. I might as well just start out and say CBE has an asbestos exposure
somewhere. It's presumably small and manageable. Jim Clarke has said, if I
recall, that there is NO small risk -- just forget about such stocks. Run.
-g-I'll try a small position anyway, keep my eye attuned for company news, and
if it's bad, hope there's room for me to escape with the bulk of my dollars
intact.
CBE (Cooper Industries) is suffering this year, but will still earn $2.75/sh,
analysts say.(Compared with more than $3 in a good year). P/e about 12-13, div.
yield about 4%, p/b =1.7 (often 2.2 in better years). Stock repurchase plan in
place. Danaher (DHR) recently has shown some interest in acquiring CBE, but has
not made a formal bid, as far as I know.

OT -- I am happy to report on my fine year in 2001. I am up 23.4% for 2001. My
2000 performance was tolerable at +4%. 1999 was a very dismal loss of 19%. My
nest-egg is now re-established. :o)

More importantly, I think the investment lessons I learned are truly learned. I
am diversified with 80 stocks, in many sectors -- the pick of the sectors, I
hope. Around half are income generating (high dividend, REIT, or preferred
stocks) which will comfortably provide me with eternal meal-tickets, campground
fees, plane fares and whatever.

I worked full-time until I was 40, then part time up to 50. I have been working
part-time an a financial manager for the past year. I just had a health scare
with my eyesight, so when I asked the retirement question "why not now?", I
clearly couldn't not answer. (I lot of people were asking themselves that
question after 9/11, according to a Wall Street Journal article). My recent
answer was "because it is entertaining", is not valid.

I am leaving the work force for good this time. I have a new boat, a nice
camper, a great motorcycle, and my wife has been beating me at raquetball so I
clearly have to practice. My eyes are still at risk, so I am going to have fun
full-time. I felt like sharing my story.

Grommit, nice performance from your stocks this year! But you only have 80
stocks? You might improve there by getting it up to 100 or so. -g-

And while that seems to read silly, I'm still arguing for big diversity,
especially for people with good size portfolios and experience in the stock
market and in life. (That might be you!) One way of looking at it is if
somebody realizes that maybe 1 of 10 stock picks turns out to be a really,
really big winner - overcoming losses in so many other stocks (how about the
thread GTSI for example?), then if that somebody has a sense or skill or
experience in going for these kinds of stocks (maybe while maintaining income
producing REITS, utils, etc), then to me, it makes sense to up the chances of
finding such winning, winning stocks. Say by having 10 chances in a portfolio
of 100 stocks. (Of course, one increases the number of stocks in one's
portfolio if and as one finds the apparent opportunities. I'm not suggesting to
increase numbers just to increase the number.)
-----------

I'm acutely aware of the importance of the eye organ -- my eyesight is giving
me troubles as well -- age related stuff-- I'm not the man I used to be. I
notice it most with night driving. Sigh.

Looks like you have all the toys. I am currently fighting new car fever. I want
a new top-of-the-line Lexus, but living beach adjacent and spending most time
locally, man, I just cannot justify any new car given the few miles I am
driving now. Maybe I'll drop back down and look for a small motorcycle.
Although a new bicycle is what's really most appropriate.

I hope you enjoy your new freedom and lifestyle!

Interesting that you bring up something I said generally about asbestos in the
context of Cooper. I've got a history with Cooper - very good company. Your
post is so ironic because I have a history with Cooper that I've probably never
posted on this thread. I nailed the bottom on Cooper in early 2000, lost track
of it for a while, bought it again a couple months ago on speculation of a deal
coming together, but then sold it the moment I saw they had asbestos exposure.
No way Danaher is going to acquire asbestos exposure and expose their whole
business to that - they'd have to be nuts.

Best of luck to everybody in 2002 - I am not at all optimistic. And I'm not
talking about the general market - last year I saw the general market as
dangerous, but I knew I was finding opportunites that would go up. And they did
- I'm coming off a very good year. Today I still see the general market as
dangerous, but the kind of things I buy look fully valued - a very picked over
market without a lot of outliers - those outliers are my game and they're just
not there.

PMFJI, but after taking a quick look at your list, I kind of wonder about the
value. One thing I noticed on nearly all of them is the very high debt to
equity ratio. While I have a personal liking for buying below book, I tend to
avoid companies where book value is leveraged to the teeth. IMO, the whole idea
of buying below book is to purchase equity at a discount. If that equity is
highly leveraged, book value belongs to creditors, not shareholders. To a
certain extent I'll go along with the idea of leveraging assets to fuel growth,
but GAAP allows so much room for abuse in capitalizing expenses, that highly
leveraged assets is often a prime indication the company is unable to generate
enough free flow cash from operations to run the business. As I see it, the
main trap for investors screening for value is, "If it looks too good to be
true, it's usually too good to be true."

I'd be interested in seeing some discussion from those who use some form of
fundamental analysis in screening for value, on debt to equity ratios. I
generally screen out anything above .5 to 1, and tend to favor those at .2 to 1
or better. If nothing else, it does eliminate the Enrons. Comments?

Would you be willing to share your analysis on MDU and why "you're loading up
the truck?"

I took a look at it and see mixed things: nice yield, but low margins, only 10%
earnings growth, high debt, and valuations that may be high for a utility, but
I don't follow this sector and may not be accurately gauging these things.

What was the catalyst for you to buy?

RJM - you almost made me faint:

- i think SOFN gets an offer of between $5-10 by 3/31/02

- in addition to everything else, their broadband satellite segment is doing
extremely well

- but the 10K - just filed - says:
"The total number of employees of the Company has decreased from 552 as of
September 30, 2000, to 44 as of September 30, 2001."

- Here's SOFN's true cash position - per their 10K just filed on 12/28/01:

-total curr assets: $79.5 mill
- restricted cash & other non-curr assets: $8 mill
- total liabil: $11 mill
- shs o/s: 25.2 mill
- therefore: $76.5 mill/25.2 = $3.04/share
- but you & I know there's going to be winding down & other expenses; so figure
instead of $76.5 - make $66.5 mill - & you get $2.64/share in liquidation

- of course, none of the above counts the $400 mill in loss carry-forwards

- so what is the real value we'll get? I don't know - but in 90 days we should

Greetings Thread. Some good values in the NG stocks.

After months of warm temps, we got the typical capitulation and year end tax
selling just as the deep freeze of the past 10 days caught a lot people by
surprise.

Here's one of MANY examples: a small cap natural gas exploration and production
company with an excellent record of finding the resource. EPEX has no LT debt,
sells for less than book value, less than 1.5x sales and sports a very low PE

http://biz.yahoo.com/p/e/epex.html

But look at the insider buying

http://biz.yahoo.com/t/e/epex.html

They've recently settled what could have been much more costly law suit against
them

MDU --

I do not do very extensive analysis of stock. I just look for decent companies.
I see historical growth, even though the next year will be flat, as you
noticed. These ratios seems better than the utility industry averages.

http://yahoo.marketguide.com/MGI/mg.asp?target=/stocks/companyinformation/ratio
Ticker=MDU

Their construction business has growth from $132 million in 1996 to $631
million in 2000. Construction and mining are giving them most of their earning
increases. Natural gas prices gave them a pop in earnings in 2001, from 1.80 in
2000 to around $2.20 in 2001. They expect around $2.00 in 2002 which is based
on normal nat gas prices. If you compare 2002 EPS (estimate of $1.90 to $2.10)
to 2000 EPS ($1.80) and 1999 EPS ($1.52) , there is decent growth. If you
mentally knock 2001 earnings in natural gas down by $10 or 20 million, EPS down
to $1.65 or so, then 2001 EPS of $2.00 is a healthy increase.

Dividends are continually growing. Management seems honest, isn't overpaid, and
they are buying stock. Stock price heading up and it used to be alot higher.
This just seems like a decent, growing, honest, no-worry, company to add to the
portfolio.

Please let me know if you find a black mark somewhere in your analysis.

Any opinion on FVE the recent spin from SNH & HRP?
This is an excerpt from a Merrill report on it:
<<Five Star [FVE] will continue to operate the 56 properties transferred to SNH
from bankrupt operators post the spinoff. As a separate entity, Five Star will
pay SNH annual rent payments of $7 million with a very modest expected rent
increase beginning in 2004 calculated as 3% of revenue growth from the prior
year. The cash flows generated from these 56 properties are currently running
at around $6.5 million to $7.0 million, so SNH’s rent payment from Five Star
will absorb all of the cash flows from the properties initially. But, SNH had
expected these properties to generate cash flows in the $10 to $12 million
range once property operations are turned around. This leaves strong growth
potential for Five Star if it can indeed turn around the operations of the
properties.>>
Filings indicated FVE is funded with 25mm in receivables and 25mm cash.

I'll swap some Fleming for some K-Mart.

FLM is a big food supplier to KM, so it's being dragged down with K-Mart as
K-Mart has been falling. There's a sell-off in both stocks today as an analyst
puts out a sell rating on KM.

My FLM position is still profitable, but I shouda sold anytime in the last few
months. I figure KM right now is the better place to be, so I sold some Fleming
and bought K-Mart. KM now has a price/sales of .06 (I estimate), and that
offsets somewhat, imo, the large and increasing debt, and the poor management.
Given KM's size and resources, they can still turn KM around. (Maybe.) If
there's any hint of that occurring, the stock will rebound.

Just my opinion, but I would only load up partially on natural gas stocks right

in the ground. Gas could fall quite a bit more in the next couple of months.

Personally, I am hoping for the gas glut to drop prices a bit more, at which
time I would buy up as the long term prospects of the industry appear to be

<<<EPEX has no LT debt, sells for less than book value,>>>

Keep in mind most exploration companies use full cost accounting and EPEX is no
exception. Typically, only 40% of wells drilled produce. That means roughly 60%
of book value is the cost of digging dry wells on most of these companies. It
looks great on paper, but the resale value of dry wells is zero. Capitalizing
these expenses as assets skews EPS numbers also, as expenses are only incurred
as depletion and amortization. Natural gas prices are close to two year lows
and there is a glut of natural gas on the market. To make matters worse, MTBE
is on the verge of being phased out, and MTBE is made from methanol, which is
made from natural gas.

I'll give the company credit for zeroing out debt while natural gas prices were
at historic highs. With very few exceptions, it's rare to see debt to equity
ratios much less than 2 to 1 in oil or oil services. Most of these outfits only
source of cash flow is debt or equity offerings, with the main purpose of the
business being an excuse to glom onto public money. Unfortunately, if we see
anything in the way of recovery in the economy, it's going to have to come at
least in part from lower energy prices. I don't think EPEX is a bad pick, but I
do think energy stocks are headed toward a prolonged bear market. Capital
spending in the sector has all but dried up, and rig count in North America has
been falling off steadily since the end of summer.

Hi Bob. Energy stocks are very cyclical.

So there are huge swings in earnings. The stocks tend to trade in anticipation
of those swings. So you buy into the trough and sell when earnings are peaking.
Easier said than done, of course. But we try.

My approach to trading/investing is very unorthodox. Instead of focusing first
on earnings, I attack the growth equation in reverse. If the company has a good
balance sheet, and an exceptional record of drilling succes there will be good
earnings and shareholder value growth.

Use some fundamental screens. But once I've got a basket of good stocks to work
with, most of my focus is on timing Intermediate (1-7 month) entries and exits.
So most of my work is in trend and trend reversal analysis via sector and
market sentiment, flow of funds in the underlying energy commodities, the
impact of weather and seasonal factors, etc.

Getting back to your question about earnings. You've probably already found it,
but Yahoo has a good layout on earning estimates for each company along with a
lot of other useful information about how many analysts are following them and
what their opinions are.

http://biz.yahoo.com/z/a/e/epex.html

In addition to EPEX, some other good small natural gas explorers I've been
trading in recent years and recently reentered are CRZO, CRK and PQUE.

Hope that's helpful,

Near-term gas fundamentals are weak with record storage levels and low demand.
Prompt-month NYMEX gas futures are down 50 cents in the past week or so despite
this cold spell --- very bearish.

If you are comfortable loading up on natural gas stocks during potential for a
sizable gas price decrease then that's fine. I am thinking about buying some
myself, but am hoping these stocks will be even cheaper in the next few weeks.

I agree with Isopatch that the long-term fundamentals for natural gas are
strong. More and more of our power infrastructure is becoming gas based. Our
current gas wells are depleting and with the current low gas prices, not much
new production is coming online.

about 10 days ago. You're in an entirely different ball game now, my friend.

Almost every energy stock I positioned 1-2 weeks ago is higher, some
substantially higher. And they will go higher still over the next 4-8 weeks.

Watch and see or participate and profit. It's up to you. All of you folks

like good adds today.

But for those of you here who sit on the sidelines, I'll be around to say "I

I work in quantitative research in the energy trading business, so this
information you are spouting about weather does not impress me.

You are clearly wrong about short-term natural gas prices. Look at the last ten
days of natural gas prices for the forward NYMEX strip (the key measure of
expected future natural gas prices in the U.S.). They have fallen dramatically.
The fact that weather has been so cold and prices have still fallen is actually
very bearish.

As for gas stocks, yes they have been up the past few weeks but the drop in
natural gas prices could cause downward pressure on these stocks, a downward
pressure we are seeing today in fact.

<<<You sound pretty negative.>>>

I am bearish on energy stocks right now, at least as far as oil and gas are
concerned. I do follow the sector, and there just plain isn't anything I can
see to justify current prices anytime in the next year. Demand is down, prices
are down, exploration is down, production is down, capital spending is down,
the only thing that isn't down is supply levels and unemployment. The stocks
are very volatile right now, which makes for increased day trading activity,
but day traders tend to burn out a stock fairly quickly. As you mentioned in a
previous post, these stocks are cyclical. Trailing PEs are meaningless coming
off a market top. There also tends to be a delayed reaction coming off a market
top in revenue and earnings as companies will usually hedge prices when
conditions are good. It normally takes a good 6-9 months for the full impact of
lower commodity prices to hit revenue and earnings. The same applies to oil
services as they tend to build large backlogs of business during a good run up
in prices. IMO, the bottom of the cycle is still a long ways off. The only wild
card in the deck is OPEC and their track record as oil's white knight is not
exactly impressive.

FWIW, my current positions in O&G are put options. So "pretty negative" is an
accurate description.

Current price is $2.35; I arrive at a NetNet of $3.60; Book Value is $4.79;
Current ratio is 4.44; Acid ratio is 2.93; Operating margin of Profit is 11.4%;
ROA last fiscal year was 14%; Virtually no long term debt.

Negatives: Low trading volume means it is somewhat illiquid; 50% of last year's
revenues were with one client and that client's contract has been filled.
However, being currently priced at .3 to sales, it appears to me that this is
already in the price.

Long term management, prudent money management, current price is not much above
value of cash on hand of about $1.88/share.

Softechie :

Any opinions on MIR DYN? TIA

I didn't have any opinions on these two before you asked, but here goes:

Neither has a great position vis a vis their ability to meet their current
obligations. MIR has a current ratio of .82 and DYN 1.06 (1.0 means you just
have enough assets to cover current liabilities), so MIR has to borrow just to
meet its nut.

Neither are a value relative to equity as MIR has a debt to equity ratio of
1.87 and DYN's is .83 (Here 1.0 means you don't have any equity and over 1.0
means your creditors can go whistle if you close your doors).

Both companies are sporting nice ROEs, but that's not hard to do when there is
little to no equity. Because then, any return looks huge.

Normally, I wouldn't look past these numbers, but since you asked, I did a
quick cash flow analysis on both for the last 4 quarters. DYN had positive cash
flow and MIR had negative.

So.... of the two, I would say the DYN is the better company, but I wouldn't
invest in either, because neither offer me a "margin of safety".

Some posters here, especially recently, seem to be far more in touch with the
energy sector than I, and i will defer to their opinions, as they will probably
be much more timely and include factors that raw numbers crunching don't

SOFN's operating losses are really over-looked - here's how easy it is to use
them to offset taxes:

"If your business is organized as a C corporation, any net operating loss it
suffers provides no tax benefit to the shareholders. Such a loss can only be
used by the corporation itself: it may be offset against the income of its
subsidiaries (if any) if a consolidated return is filed, carried back against
past income, or carried forward to reduce future income. A corporation can
carry a net operating loss back two years and forward 20 years. If net
operating losses are anticipated by a corporation, it may be beneficial to
elect S corporation status and pass the losses on to the shareholders."

- shs o/s: 25.2 mill
- $400 mill in loss carry-forwards

- plus around $3 in net cash per share

- we'll know by 3/31/02

Isopatch, although you're presenting yourself as making money in the markets,
the fact is you've had some very poor calls this past year.

Over on the Strictly Drilling II thread, you made a major call to go against
the PPT following the WTC attack. The NASDAQ then went on to its best seven
week performance in over 20 years, according to Financial Times. Anyone
following your advice on that call lost out on a 50% move. No telling how much
they lost investing the other way.

I can provide the link if you wish.

You've been calling for a major move in the gold market.

The portfolio I put together of your picks on 12/3, the day after you posted
your selections on same thread, is up 0.1% as of today. 1/10th of a point on
what you called a major move.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/portfolio/detail.gsp?pid=9289202

And following your advice to your fellow threadsters, you sold out 2-3 weeks
later after calling a major move.

I can provide the link if you wish.

And let's not forget your admission of having a disappointing year.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=16560738

And now in your post to Bob Rudd, you speak of using fundamental screens to
form a base of what you call unorthodox investing, yet on your thread you said
fundamentals are best answered by others.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=16842463

You are right about one thing, your investing is unorthodox. I can provide the
links showing more losers than winners if you wish.

I'm not looking for a debate here, I just thought showing some balance to your
calls was warranted.

SOFN as far as I can determine has no business prospects. Ever since new
management has come in they recognized and announced their intention to sell. I
think this has been going on for over a year now. I just dont see it happening
as a cash deal. but I have been wrong in the past and doubtless will be wrong
again.
I suggest you all take a look at LYNX. I owned this company in the 30s a year
or two ago. sold off my position in the teens and reentered in the 2-s. It is a
biotech company with real revenues, and lots of intellectual properties and
sharp scientists. I don't understand the technology but derive comfort from the
myriad of deals they have done. a kicker is a joint venture that the company
has with BASF called Axaron. This is not a net net, just a very cheap biotech
that has lot of potential. there was a private sale of stock in the 6s and some
insider purchases as well.I like the risk/ reward ratio here. Another company I
like and dont understand the price on is IBAS. this is another speculative
company with lots of cash and losses. but its too cheap right now. it too is
doing some deals in the voice over the internet space. It made a poor
acquisition a year or so ago which did not help its price but i dont see it
going bankrupt in the next 12 months either. I wish someone could explain the
satellite business to me so i could understand how all the companies seem to be

REF. I hate it when I come across these simple, little companies where I can't
easily figure out the financials.
-g-

I show that every year from '95 to latest figures (3Q '01) this company has
been profitable. In some years making more than a buck a share. Total reported
earnings, '97 to present:
$4.61/sh.

Okay, so what did they do with all these profits?

There's not been any long term debt since '95.
Stock outstanding has remained the same roughly since '97.
There's no dividend that's paid.

Book value in '97 was $6.19
Currently it's $5.90

So if they didn't pay down debt, and they didn't pay a dividend, and they
didn't buy back stock, and the money isn't kept internal (book value
decreased!) where did that $4.61 go? Or did it not really exist for
stockholders?

a clue. (?))

Interesting questions regarding REF Paul!

I can't say that I can answer them.

My analysis only goes back through 1998 for sales and cash flows and through
1999 for the rest.

A quick look at my data this morning indicates that while they did not have any
long term debt, I had amounts listed under "other long term obligations", and
those amounts have declining balances since 1999. Additionally their CFO has
been negative since 1999 so maybe they've improved the situation for their
working capital demands going forward. In line with this possibility is the
fact that although their book value hasn't changed much since 1999, their
NetNet value as I calculate has improved somewhat from $3.87 to $4.22.

I wish I had more time today to look for the answers, 'cause I love a good
problem! Maybe over the week-end.

Thank you Mr. Patch for the kind words.

If people are interested in credibility, all they have to do is read the last

As I said before, I'm not interested in a debate over your calls, here on this
thread. However, when you tell posters unfamiliar with your record that you're
making tons of money in the market, when you're not, I think they have a right
to know.

When you use phrases like, I'll end up telling you, "I told you so," then
people need to know your record. Wouldn't you agree?

It's one thing to share ideas, concepts and strategies. It's another to tell
people to get on board or they'll be sorry because you're going to come back
and tell them, "I told you so."

From what I've seen here, these folks seem fairly intelligent, they'll be the
final judge.

Sorry for the intrusion folks, you are just getting a glimpse of the type of
reactions Mr Patch makes when people disagree with him.

Timba. An energy stock idea that might interest you folks.

Mishedlo suggested CRED and posted it a few days ago on our Strictly Drilling
II thread. After some DD I bot a partial position in this sm NG E&P. There's an
additional kicker beyond their growing gas production. Seems they've developed
a viable enhanced recovery technology for obtaining significant additional
natural gas production from wells classified depleted based on conventional
technology.

http://biz.yahoo.com/p/c/cred.html

Thought selling above book and not technically a "value stock", they have an
excellent balance sheet with no debt and a 4.80 to 1 current ratio.

A bit larger in cap and trades somewhat more vol than PHOC, but still a thin
trader comparted to most of my other energy stocks. I'm in only a partial
position for that reason. But IMO it should be a money maker over the next 4-8
weeks with the rest of the sector.

Thanks, ISO. I just hate to see so many investors with tunnel vision - thinking
that tech is the only area and also buying when a rally is almost over.

Heck, a bread company mentioned on CNBC recently went up like 600-800% in the
last couple years. Tech is sexy, but its reward to risk ratio is far from good
at the moment.
Like I said earlier this morning when the SOX was near 600....WATCH OUT!

It's much more important to look for great REWARD TO RISK plays and now sectors
like Biotech are looking way better than tech, although it is probably not wise
to invest in that area yet until we are convinced it will hold support at
539-543 on the BTK.

Sector rotation is something we watch real closely to see where the trendy

Everything else steady as she goes.

From Marketwatch on Oil funds- speaks to some of Isopatch's ideas:

http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=
{3AE47362-3DD4-41A4-BE80-FCEBE5905CEB}&siteid=mktw&dist=mah

Of the energy focused funds, most concentrate on three major sub-sectors: Major
integrated oil players, such as a Chevron or an Exxon; energy service
companies, which are a lot of the oil drillers; and then the smaller
exploration and production companies.

"Those last two sub-sectors are the ones that are really respond to price
changes in oil. So those are the places that investors really want to look if
they want to make a play that's sensitive to the commodity prices of oil and
natural gas," hinted McNeela.

State Street Global Resources (SSGRX: news, chart, profile) is one such fund
that's highly sensitive to energy price changes, observed McNeela. As of
Monday, the fund has gained 8.5 percent in the last 13 weeks.

Investors looking for a little bit less volatility might also consider Vanguard
Energy (VGENX: news, chart, profile), which is more diversified throughout the
energy sectors. It also benefits from low expenses and a very experienced
manager, Ernst von Metzsch, at the helm for 17 years. Vanguard Energy rose 6.2
in the last 13 weeks.

Clearly one of McNeela's favorites is Excelsior Energy and Natural Resources
(UMESX: news, chart, profile). Michael Hoover, running the fund for six years,
has been getting a lot of attention by becoming more aggressive at the "right
times."

"Yet when energy prices looked to be a little more unstable and vulnerable to
price decreases, he's been able to get that message relatively early in the
game and moved to protect the fund by buying some of those major integrated oil
companies," McNeela noted. The portfolio picked up 5.2 percent in the last 13
weeks.

Icon Energy (ICENX: news, chart, profile) is another fund in McNeela's radar,
though the fund is quantitatively managed, which means that stock selection is
driven by numbers rather than the quality of management.

Computer stockpicking has certainly worked for the portfolio both long and
short-term. Icon Energy has an impressive record, ranking at the top of the
natural resources group for the three-year period with average annual returns
of nearly 36 percent. While the fund dipped by 3.3 percent in 2001, Icon Energy
had a blowout year in 2000, up roughly 79 percent, which followed a 50 percent
return in 1999.

In the last 13 weeks, this fund added roughly 12 percent, but it should
probably be avoided if oil prices take another turn for the worse. When oil
fell in 1998, this fund fell with it, losing over 37 percent that year.

You know, I really don't invest based on "catalyst". I've found that I'm not

Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm not. When I'm right, sometimes the market
still yawns. Haven't been able to hone that skill.

Any investment you see me make will be made primarily on the numbers,
secondarily on my "feel" for management, tertiary would be technical analysis.
I won't say that these are my only considerations ever, but the high proportion
of my successful results have been when they were.

I like that they are diversifying into the Apple docking station product when

Bob. Don't use that approach myself

so I'd only be speculating on someone else's motives which is always iffy.

Most industry people put a lot of emphasis on cash flow per share and at what
multiple to cash flow a stock should trade at to be fully valued.

Although I think that's a very useful approach. I don't put a lot of weight on
it in my own work. Once I'm satisfied that the company has a good balance sheet
and has a mgt team committed to increasing shareholder equity?

I'm more interested in the quality of the prospect portfolio the companys
geological and land acquisition team has assembled in combination and what
their field operations people are doing with those prospects.

In other words, what kind of drilling success have they demonstrated over time?
The productivity of the wells that are brought in, etc. Is their overall annual
production flat, growing or declining?

Then it's mostly a matter of timing my entry and exit from the position. If I
can get most of an intermediate term move I'm happy. Think it was Baron
Rothschild who said, "I'll give up the first 10% off the bottom and will gladly
sell to someone who will hold for that last 10%. Just give me the 80% in
between and I'll be happy"

Me? I'm happy with 60 to 75% of the move.<g>

Topannuity. Good mutual funds such as those

individual stocks.

Your article also points up how successful portfolio managers often use very
different approaches to stock selection, sector timing, etc.

My old mentor, a wealthy and very successful professional investor concentrated
his work in the 1st group. He'd often be fully margined in the big
multi-national integrated giants like XOM. RD and BP. One of the best things he
did for me was NOT try to change my style which was quite different from his. I
like the small to mid-caps and almost never use margin.

One of the most fascinating things about this game is how many different ways
