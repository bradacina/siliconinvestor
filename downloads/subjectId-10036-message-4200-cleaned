Thanks, Shane:
Seems like WOSI has interesting stores which sell novel products, but the
question is how much do they sell?
If you notice in their most recent release, a good deal of their sales most
recent Q was in the "plush toy" category. That hardly seems to be the type of
product for their target market, IMHO.

Thread,

I meant to throw this out earlier, but forgot.

Since all of the net-net discussion here, I've begun to monitor (current assets
less total liabilites) as a percentage of mkt cap. (BTW, is there an agreed
upon "term" for this ratio?)

The following company showed up on a recent screen. It's not a net-net, but the
above "ratio" was 1.05.

Company is Cidco, CDCO. They make what are internet phones, supposedly a
rapidly growing market. I'm not conviced that the world will want internet
phones in an environment approaching the $500 PC, but many feel it's the
appliance that will push e-mail, and minor browsing (such as monitor stock
tickers, sports scores, etc) beyond the current computer literate population.
There is a sparsely populated SI thread for the company.

Some stats (financials as of 12-31-97):
price last I checked $8.75
mkt cap $122 mil.
PE 9.6
P/S 0.47
P/B 0.93
P/CF 6.6
no debt
pct cash 40%
sales growth of 40+% in recent quarters.

RE net nets from Shane Milburn.
Received your spreadsheets and reviewed company data from AAII data base of two
years ago. For the benefit of the thread these were companies that had
demonstrated net net properties in the past and to which a retroactive review
was made. Three factors were used as primary screen ,free cash flow for each of
preceding 8 quarters,current assets to current liabilities and long term debt.
Only BELM had significant LTD. 8 of the 15 companies had negative cash flow in
at least 5 of the past 8 quarters and were not considered candidates for
purchase. Collateral data was also used,by comparing companies to peers(4 digit
industry code used by AAII). These factors were P/sales, P/cash flow and
Inventory turnover. Only 4 companies had 4 or more quarters of positive free
cash flow and current net asset ratio greater than 5(arbitrary cutoff). Of
these ESP was strongest but had inventory turnover which was only 25% of peer
group and was eliminated. Only 3/15 companies seemed strong enough to
consider,HBW,MAJ, and PSO.. None has performed well and in fact only 1
company(BELM)out of the entire list of 15 doubled since mid 96 (but then
retrenched). Bottom line is that net net money was dead money for this small
group of identified companies during this powerful bull market.
Having said this I plan to follow ASFN in the near term, not from financial
considerations but because of a Washington Post article about dissident
shareholders winning control of the board.

I have seen references to ASFN in the Washington Post several times in the past
3-4 years and have not investigated thoroughly as of yet. Shane Milburn's
posting joggled my recollection. The dissident shareholder story appeared
perhaps one month ago. The story was that the new board members reversed their
pre vote course, and decided that the president could stay since the companies
woes were not his fault and that his performance was adequate. The stories that
preceded that stated that the contesting shareholders believed that the board
was controlled by family interests including the president (and I believe his
father??)and the family was receiving unacceptible levels of compensation
relative to poor financial performance. Can't remember whether full board or
partial board was replaced. Probably easiest way to find out is to call the
company.

Aside: Just want to acknowledge the passing of mutual fund pioneer and value
investor, Philip Carret last week at age 101. Actually a remarkable fellow IMO.
Of course over the years he was interviewed because of his longevity (which
apparently runs in his family - his mother told stories of about hearing
reports of Civil war battles.) The family had its ups and downs (chronicled
briefly in one of Mr. Carret's books, "A Money Mind at Ninety".) I've got a
March 1986 article about Wall Street's elder statesmen which says of the then
89 year-old Mr. Carret, that he "still logs full workweeks plus three hours on
Saturdays to try to spot good stock buys." He was a buy and hold guy it seems
to me. Many articles written about his Greif Brothers holdings -- I often
wondered what would have happened if he bought MRK or LLY or BMY in 1947 (or
whenever he started his Greif position). He, like many people on this thread,
believed management was crucial. "He insists on knowing a company's management
personally." He liked companies he could understand (not tech stocks!), was
attracted to companies with unbroken (or almost unbroken) 10 year record of
earnings increases, and preferred debt-free companies - leaders in their fields
- with stable management.
I think he was particularly proud of his small, original ($16k)investment in
Neutrogena in 1979 which returned him profits of $137k in 1986, $90k in '87,
and a further $265k when the co. was sold to JNJ. He originally found the
company when he saw the soap (it's a soap co.) in the sink of the hotel room in
which he was staying. (This info. comes from a Washington Post article on him
on his 100th birthday.)

I will be presumptuous and say that Mr. Carret's lesson for us (and me for
sure) is: PATIENCE PAYS. I believe the profits Mr. Carret achieved came as a
result of applying his approach over a long period of time. He bought quality
and held.

In one of his books, he discusses how it was difficult for him to accept that
he was not as good an investor as some of his peers. But yet, from 1932 he was
almost always his own boss, he was able to survive on Wall Street (he was a
founder of one of the earliest mutual funds (1928) - successful enough that it
paid dividends right through the depression); and I see that he raised two sons
who followed him into the business.

I never knew Mr. Carret, but I will miss reading of his ideas and stock picks.
I think it's been great to see someone continue to do the work he loves --even
when it's not necessary financially -- and share that learning and wisdom which
comes with the experience of so many decades.

I believe a lot of people on this thread are going to make a lot of money in
the market over the coming years -- and I suspect maybe it will come a lot
easier if we could take a long term view as Mr. Carret did.

As an aside, I note that he is in the same camp as Buffett on tech stocks.
However, I wonder if they would understand biotech any better?
Or, by extension, drug companies? Is the real issue a company that requires a
major amount of R&D and new products all the time to stay
in business?

I do not find it difficult understanding that Intel and Microsoft have powerful
monopolies on microprocessors and operating system software, even though I do
not know much about the design of a chip or writing software. In fact, you can
make a case that just because so much R&D is required, a large company with an
entrenched technology monopoly is harder to dislodge than in other industries -
since no one can come close to their R&D budget.

Michael, James and others,

It looks we are getting very close to "value"
levels in the semi-equipment industry. Overall
the industry is growth-cyclical and now it's being
punished by both overcapacity and Asian crisis.

However, the secular trend is up, and the
worse the current downturn, the better should be the
next upturn. We may be early, but on the upturn
we may get 2-3 baggers. The downside: almost all companies
are cash-flow negative, so Buffett fans need not apply. :-)

What are concrete buys? The "gorilla" of the
industry AMAT is still expensive. All other players
are smaller and have their niches. Michael mentioned
SFAM, which I like though it's competing with AMAT.

My current pick is ASYT.

http://biz.yahoo.com/p/a/asyt.html

It's a monopoly leader in its niche and the niche
may even hold steady during the downturn because automation of
fabs has a nice ROI and semis can retrofit older fabs,
even when they are not building new ones. It is selling at
~1.3 PSR, 1.8 p/book, has ~$6 cash per share. They are
expecting to remain profitable during the downturn.
I added some at 15.75 and plan to average down.

If you are looking for more net-net type of plays,
KLIC is a market leader, but most volatile of the semi-equips.
Now down to .8 PSR, 1.3 p/book. Buy at $12. CFMT, COHU,
EGLS, SMTL may appeal to someone who wants to have a
broader portfolio. Each has their own positives and negatives.

For hi-yield suggestion, look at HELX. It has high
PSR, but its ROE is phenomenal.

Good luck

If you ask yourself, "Should I buy?"

Yes, but Intel and Microsoft look like
counterexamples. There are few long-term holds in
tech area: ADBE, CSCO, HWP, with a stretch IBM.
Even they cannot compare with KO in longevity.
As Mr. B says: "KO's gonna be here in 50 years."
I would not vouch for any of tech companies to be
here in 20 years. Sure, they may be here
as fallen giants (IBM).

In addition, almost no tech stocks have
positive free cash flows - a requirement in Mr. B's
long-term hold world.

Moreover, Intel, Microsoft and CSCO are bad counterexamples.
I would have never owned them because of high valuations.
I recognize them as "Gorillas", but I can't justify buying
a "gorilla" at high price even if it's "gorilla". I had a
"gorilla" discussion with a friend long before the
book was published. And I still could not come up with
reasonable buy-sell strategy. "Dollar-cost-averaging buy and
sell never" might work for gorillas, but I don't like it.

My real philosophy is "Superstocks" which calls for
trading because you sell or lighten-up if "high" valuation
is reached. I would be happy to be long term investor, but
when ASYT goes from ~$10 to ~$50 in a year, I have to sell
some. :-) And now I'm back in the ride. I held some ASYT
through the $50 down to $16 again, but was that wise?
I don't know. ;-)

I'm agree with you 100%. I am tired of people saying they don't
understand companies such as Microsoft (even though I am a fan
of Buffett and Berkshire). Buffett gets a
break because he is over age 65.
80% of msft's sales are from Windows and Office (1/2 each).
Both are pure monopolies. Both with huge critical mass
and momentum.
It's like English, the language we all use to conduct
business on this globe. It's not difficult to understand it
would be very hard to replace English (e.g. with French).
You don't need to have a technology background to understand
that Windows is a platform that all PC software builds on
(just as all books in this country is written using English).
You don't need to understand technology to understand that
humans have a need to send Word and EXCEL attachments
with our e-mails. Come on you value guys, get with it!

Even if you don't understand the java fuss I would suggest
it's entirely possible to monitor how Windows is doing
against java-vm .... just monitor the unit-count on
a quarterly basis ... Windows is such a big ship...
it's possible to see it turn (north or south).
A similar business example in the past was Novell.
Years ago you had to be brain dead to not see
NT was going to kill Netware way before it happened.
Netware was built on top of DOS. DOS was replaced--
game over.
Java-vm is msft's only real threat today
--Ballmer and Gates said so themselves--the
company's strategy has always been "embrace and extend";
so far that has always worked... we'll see.

Lastly, I don't agree with your statement about Intel.
Intel's chips can/is being cloned. You can't clone
Microsoft's Windows/Office. (just watch the ASP trend!)

The intrinsic value of Microsoft is way way north
of today's $85/sh price. The company has a long long
way to go.

Just think ... about everyone is sure the company
will have a run-rate eps of $3/sh in 18 to 24 months.
Will have $10/sh in cash then. The growth picture will
still be great then as it is today. Product pipeline
is fine: W98, Office2000, NT5, SQL7, W2000,
CE is doing great, web apps are just beginning to grow
for real, PC prices are going down further.
Lots of insider ownership. Management seems fine.
This is a no-brainer.

Just my 2 cents.

For value investors with a contrarian approach, a company that I recently
bought, Midway Games (MWY), at 12 3/8 just reported heavy insider buying (with
the CEO in for over $1M). The company has been
slammed since ~90% of it was spun off from WMS a few months back. The shares
have now rallied to around 14, but hopefully will fall back. Down 50% with
insider buying. What else? Well, IMO, it has great business economics - it is
the only producer of home video games (it made Mortal Kombat) that also is big
into arcades. So it has a bit of a ready-made testing area. I recently toured
the local Target - its games are selling very well. I myself play most of my
games on my Nintendo 64 rather than a PC, and I really don't feel the Nintendo
is going away (though Midway makes games for all formats, the highest margins
are in home video games) because to me at least there are native advantages
(including bigger screens and faster 3D play) to dedicated video game systems
over PC play. They recently reported they would be less profitable than
expected, and the shares tumbled. But there's no debt, a a chunk of cash, a
profitable business, solid economics, and large discount to its peers from a
valuation standpoint. I attribute much of the fall to weak shareholders.

In any case, the insider buying might qualify it for some of the readers here.
Another pick of mine, BMC, had huge insider buying at 17 and is now down to
13-14.

Mike. Well, I've come back this weekend to look at MWY: and I did notice it
when you first mentioned it here, and I see it on your web page- also the MWY
posts on SI. Bottom line is that I agree with you. Actually it's a buy here
imo. BUTS, HOWEVERS, and DOUBTS follow -g-:

I'm not understanding your (Sealpoint) reasoning why MWY is better vis-a-vis.
ERTS, but I think you are correct that MWY is a good buy.

This darn stock - MWY - causes me to question my whole logic in investing --- I
hate that -g-. Let me recap what I believe:

These game stocks are like movie stocks (which I sometimes buy --hello VO -g-).
A hit can come out of the blue - from a small shop or a big shop. Where the hit
will be - that is not predictable. It's not correct to value these kinds of
software companies on book value. After all, it costs only pennies to reproduce
a hit game on a CD. I do not know how to value such companies. One way might be
price to sales. (Yes, we've kinda beat this psr thing, but maybe it will
actually be helpful to us here.) There are a bunch of such game companies out
there. If I use number of employees per firm -- and why not? - The more
employees, maybe the more chance for one of 'em to come up with a hit -- then
clearly ERTS is the big kid on the block (from what I can tell) with over 1000.
And this is reflected in ERTS's stock price - it looks pretty high to me. MWY
with a psr of 1.3 and 326 employees (per Yahoo) looks like a VERY GOOD BET to
me. I like it better than THQI with a similar psr (1.3) and only 81 employees.
I like that you have reported that there's insider buying on MWY. I don't
recall seeing this for THQI or ERTS on their threads.

If you read the THQI thread, there's a guy there who's a professional analyst.
This guy IMO will know more on his pinky finger than I will ever know about
THQI or the software games business. Actually, he may know more on that finger
than I know in toto -g-. He seems very, very good. That he likes THQI and I am
so simplistic in my MWY decision (and maybe even utterly misinformed & confused
about THQI and MWY and ERTS) says it all -g-. Once again -- over and over and
over again - it comes down to: Does superior knowledge lead to superior
investment performance? And you know-- I believe it does not (somebody show me
a study which shows that it does); but man, I hate to go against (well, away
from, not really against) a Pro who seems to really, really know his stuff. But
I will. IMO, the buy is MWY. You get a reasonable pe, perhaps people selling
because of the spin-off- and as you allude- even more selling as they exit,an
okay psr, and a shot -- a very good shot-- that MWY could deliver a blockbuster
game.

Anecdotal info. -g-. The 7-year old I hang with likes his family Nintendo 64
(Nintendo --NTDOY-- arggh I missed it at last year at 8-9-- thought ELAMF which
I believe got the South American assembly contract would be better -- wrong,
wrong, wrong) and is saving to buy his 13 year-old brother a Nintendo game for
his birthday present. And they all still like to go to arcade games (and with
me and my quarters). I do not like any of this (it's not about the .25 pieces
but shouldn't these punks be doing history papers or algebra or something?
Shouldn't these games be rated R?-- (Rhetorical). These are normal kids - as
far as I can tell (I ain't a psychologist). So maybe it's repeated many, many
times all over the US, Canada, etc. (I won't opine about it, though it does
pain me -g-)

Believe I will try to match your order size on Monday. Not too happy coming in
behind you 2 points higher though. But I'll stick with my opinion- MWY is a buy
for long term investors. It's a GARP stock---not necessarily a value stock.
Looking for 18 in 18 months. JMO,Paul. (and I know how James Bond can escape at
the end of the the OO7 game -g-)

Alan,

Martin Whitman has been buying semi-equips for
some time now. But then he's a fund manager and has
to buy $mln dollar positions. :-) FSII and SVGI
are second tier companies in my opinion, so I would
not buy them when first-tier companies are on sale.
ESIO is definitely a first-tier company.

ADEX is also a second-tier company that
supplies wafer-producers. As such it's not interesting
to me. Wafer-producers are dead until wafer overcapacity
is soaked. Semis may buy semi-equipment even while bleeding
to death - they have to play the no-limit poker. Wafer cos
can (and have to) stop ordering until the fortune
turns. They are not so dependent on innovations as semis are.
I'm afraid that ADE is not in the best position
right now. They may be an excellent investment when
wafer cos massively convert to 300mm wafers.
However, this is just my opinion, biased
by fact that I foolishly hold some WFR. :-(((

Regarding Whitman's opinions about Japanese Banks,
he probably has more info than any of us. IMO, foreign
investment is risky enough without delving into
cross-ownership, dubious reporting on books, and high
debts prevalent in Japan. I'd buy a good mutual if I
went foreign, or at least stick with companies
that conform to American reporting standards, and have
an excellent long-term financial history.

Good luck

JB,

I think you can make the point that SVGI is presently second tier with respect
to litho, but their Thremco business is top of the line and their Track
business is not to far behind. In previous cycle (pre-photlitho SVGL) they were
a niche player true, but had serious marketshare to my knowledge in both. Third
Avenue's angle is probably looking at the SVGL portion as gravy if it doesn't
sap resources from the rest of the two other business units. By the way, rumors
are abound that at Semicon West, AMAT will make yet another pitch for SVGI.
They have in the past, and whether this is wishful thinking or not by way of
rumor, only time will tell.

Re: BMC, with a balance sheet $100 million weaker and the income statement only
$35 million stronger (on the top, who knows on the on the bottom), to me the
market is reacting as if it thinks (1)BMC's management are con artists lying
about the company's transisition (2)Asia will last for at least 2-3 years (3)
the Orcolite acquisition was neutral at best and probably a negative. Given
management's historical record, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, but now
that the company is more leveraged, I think the margin of safety disappears.
Management was quick to jump in at 17, and it was quick to buy back stock, even
borrowing money to do so, in the 16's. Now at 13, it is a contrarian dream but
something of a valuation and safety question mark, with debt>equity.

Personally, I still buy managment's argument. Looking at the margins on the
various segments and management's capital reallocation, it seems to make sense.
I think it is falling because of inertia now. I got out when it broke to new
lows in the 15's and would love for it to just bottom out somewhere between
book and sales. It's high on my list, but I'm willing to wait for some price
stability, since I'm happy with my portfolios as they are now. I'm also waiting
to talk to the company about some details re: the Orcolite transaction.

<<We shouldn't forget that it is not Marty Whitman but his heir-apparent Jensen

So you are implying that Whitman blindly let Jensen do the picking? Also, how
does one get to be an heir apparent? I assume by showing some talent. If I were
a 3rd Avenue mutual fund holder, I would hold Whitman responsible, as would
most likely other holders. The fact that a supposed heir apparent made (or
suggested) the pick wouldn't phase me, because Whitman's got his reputation on
the line. If they screw up, my money moves. Whitman knows this, so don't make
him out to be an old, blind fool. He may not know tech stocks, but investing is
not purely a techical or fundamental analysis. Many people don't have a clue
what the companies they hold stock in "really" do. They just pick them because
they have attractive data points: including P/E, PSR, Growth %, P/B and
marketshare.

I'm not saying that Whitman is an old blind fool. Geez, not even close. I'm
saying that if we are judging a man on his record in a certain area, and he
brings in a partner that introduces him to another area, then the mix changes.
And we don't know whether it's for the better yet. When Whitman says Tokio Fire
is a steal, I think, who would know better? When he says that Jensen has
convinced him of the value in certain semis even though he never considered
them before, then I think, does he (the proven genius of the two, but still
human) really know semis? And why is it he couldn't come up with this on his
own? There's an unproven element that makes me less likely to run out and buy
FSII than I would TRC.

that no one is infallible, if you believe in Mr. Whitman, one must conclude
that he has performed substantial DD on those who are involved in the decision

re: Whitman. Mike, don't kid yourself that he made every decision in the past
on his own. He has amassed a great track record because he hired great people,
and of course has the insights to say "yes" and "no" at the right times. I am
an analyst working under a value investor with a track record, and believe me,
every pick I write up does not get into the portfolio. If you're not going to
second guess Whitman's track record, don't second guess his choice of people,
because that track record is a function of his choice of people. Nobody can
cover the whole market on his own, except maybe Buffett who has the discipline
to make just one or two buy/sells a year.

On another note, I was reading about a real estate investor today who said "I
make all my money in just six days of the year" (when he does deals). His wife
asks, "so why do you work every day?" To which he replied "Because you never
know when you are going to find the idea." This is so typical of great
investors. You don't need to find a great idea every day. As an individual
investor, I need to find two or three great ideas per year. I look back and see
that the investments I researched hard and was sure of were almost all winners.
I gave a lot of the winnings back, though, investing in marginal ideas for
various stupid reasons because I was bored or cash was burning a hole in my
pocket. I'll learn eventually.

The latter part of your post is so, so true. Warren Buffett looks at it as his
20 ticket approach - think of investing as if you had only
20 stocks you could buy in your lifetime. I'd have a lot better results with
that approach than the "don't let money burn a hole in
your pocket" approach.

In fact, I would go further. If one is unable to do the due diligence to be
able to distinguish such great ideas, putting your money in an index fund will
probably match the results you do get, with no work and a lot less stress.

Fed Filings disclosure today on Buffett. Doesn't seem to have hit CNBC or the

(WMT) and a smaller position in Tupperware (TUP). As you know, Buffett delays
his filings, so this is as of early 1997. But it appears he already has a
double in the Gap and Walmart. I looked at both closely, leaned toward buying,
but somehow never did.

Tupperware is more interesting, in that it is DOWN since then. We don't know if
Buffett bought on the way down or blew it out, but it passes the rigorous test
from Contrarian Investing. Down by half, low P/E, with free cash flow AND major
insider buying (without a single sell). I bought 200 shares today.

Re: Tupperware, I looked and looked over the same time he must have
been buying. I refuse to buy now just because he did, but I'm intrigued. I'll
try to understand why. It kept popping up on a large percentage of my value
screens, but it seemed you had to have confidence in the brand name for it to
recover. And I didn't. Maybe I grew up in the wrong era to appreciate it. Just
another example of why Buffett's feats are probably irreplicable.

Re: Gap, my wife has been telling me to buy the stock for 6 months now,

Re: BMC, I'm learning a lesson. On this one, I got out when it broke to new
lows in the 15's. On Oxford and Swisher I wasn't so lucky. Buying in the area
of the first big break is turning out to be a riskier contrarian move than I
thought, even with big buybacks and significant insider buying backing it up.

I am not sure about BMC at this point. There are people who claim to be
employees over on the Yahoo thread who seem to be calling it right, and they
still say it's a stinker. I'd hate to be scared off by that, but would it be
just as stupid to ignore it? While I figured they could have even no earnings
this Q and it wouldn't phase me, I certainly didn't expect the line shut downs,
and with their spanking-new debt/equity >1 it's hard to pin down a fundamental
floor.

Another lesson fresh from my pocketbook - when your investment sets off a
nuclear warhead, it's never too late to sell. Down 25% and counting in the

Mike:

A couple of questions for you and others on this thread. Is there value in
knowing if your portfolio correlates to the DOW or NASDAQ market indices? If
so, how do you establish a correlation, if not why not if we think the indices
in general are waaay overvalued? Correlary, if we want to be contrarian our
portfolios shouldnt correlate with the averages, than we should be afforded
more downside protection and more upside potential - in the long haul. In the
short term, the momentum stocks will always look to beat us. (or me at least)

In terms of your investment in IFN, while its never too late to sell, our
tendancy is to get caught in the short term moves.(a day, a week or a month
even) A way that has worked for me (actually lifted from following M. Burke on
the Ask M. Burke thread) is to treat investments in stages. If I like IFN or
ROC than I buy 1/3 ($value) of what I want, if I still like it weeks later and
the price has dropped by 20% I may fill in a little more - it tends to average
out the nuclear bombs in my portfolio.
The same also applies if it goes up to fast.

United Asset Management (UAM) looks very very interesting to me too. Anybody
who knows what free cash flow is should have this one near the top of their
watch list.

As with most value investments, there are some real negatives. Take this one
for example. In the money management business, your fees are based on assets
under management. Which is a function of two things. 1) appreciation of the
market (yeah, you get paid 20% more if the market goes up 30% even if you just
go up 20%! what a business!) - as long as you retain your clients, bringing me
to #2, which is UAM's real problem: 2) additions or withdrawals by investors.

UAM has been enjoying the market appreciation, of course, but has not been
growing earnings because of some pretty massive withdrawals. That means the
customer is not satisfied and is going elsewhere. It also should be obvious
that if the market drops significantly, these guys are in real trouble. My view
on the market is probably the main reason why I passed on this one. The value
is there provided the bull market continues, but the earnings themselves have
market risk and I am not interested in taking market risk. This is very
different from a cheap stock whose EARNINGS have no relation to the stock
market.

Plus they've got a bunch of primadonnas at the firms they have bought who don't
feel like working hard now that they've sold their firms to UAM. Thats a big
issue in the business of consolidating money management firms.

But a 9% free cash flow yield is nothing to sneeze at.

UAM - in order to buy up asset managers - structured deals to allow quite a bit

Mike Burry-

I haven't had time to do the promised "good writeup" on Conso Products Co.
(CNSO), but I saw they just purchased Simplicity Patterns Co. for $33 million
(Simplicity's net sales were $55 million last year).

CNSO a textile company here in upstate SC. They occupy a niche making fancy
tassels for furniture, drapery, etc. Sounds mundane, and Warren advised us to
avoid textiles like the plague, but CNSO has a very sharp husband & wife
management team, who are both accountants and own 42% of the company. They have
hit a rough patch due to competition, but appear to be getting back on track
and still are by far the dominant player in their market. They have grown by
making smart acquisitions, and the Simplicity purchase gives them a solid brand
name at what may be a very reasonable price, though I have seen no detailed
financials on Simplicity to indicate profitability.

If anyone is interested, I'll try to post more on CNSO this weekend. I've just
been too snowed under with my own small business, and picking apart another
company's numbers seems to take me quite a bit longer than most of you folks.

But, hopefully I'll get a bit faster soon. Recently I used your Sealpoint web

Most haven't been too successful, IMO. Even the InsiderTrader seems to lag in

Count: re. trying to catch the falling knife. You will want to develop a
methodology for dealing with these types of purchases. A three-year holding
implies to me an investment operation (although I'd guess from your your post,
you don't hold a stock that long). Anyway... my general guides are:

1. When I see value...I try to buy it. I don't dodge away waiting for the
absolute best price. If there is no doubt about the value (which means some
margin of safety is already in the stock price) and yet also there is fear and
loathing about the falling knife ---BUY the stock.

2. Anybody whose name is Count de Monie or Senior will see the stock drop after
he/she buys it. Therefore, purchases are lagged into. Like 1/3 now, 1/3 few
points lower, etc. (I say 1/3 based on Mike Burke - see his thread-- but other
fractions okay; or lag in by time- 1/3 now, 1/3 in next quarter, etc.; or by
quantity-- 100 sh. to start, 300 sh. bought 3 points lower, 500 sh more added 5
points lower. Main thing is keep diversified portfolio of stocks. (Unless
you're shooting for the moon and putting all your knowledge and dough into one
position-- then none of this applies.)

(To me, how one establishes a position in a particular stock is a huge key item
in investing. And to me, it's almost like determining whether you are a TA
person or a fundamentalist. Will you be a person who primarily averages down or
will you be a person who primarily averages up (pyramids) in a stock? Or
perhaps something else- just a large initial purchase with short-term trading
smaller amounts as stock moves up/down? Each must determine his/her own
preference.)

3. It isn't going to be about buying. The problem will be holding. On the rare
times when Monie or Senior buys a stock and it bounces up and maybe stays there
-- that's easier. Hold those sweet gains for more or even sell out for a quick
profit - or sell half and hold rest. But... when the stock just declines or
just sits and sits -- and other stocks seem oh-so-tempting---- that's where the
difficulty is-- IMO.

And I'll state right now -- I don't feel so successful with either being
able/willing to employ these guidelines or in sticking with them once I start a
position. Apparently, not very successful at all as I look a my portfolio
screen with lots of stocks I'm underwater in, and portfolio value dropping
steadily -g-. Paul Senior

You could make that "Monie or Senior or Burry". Thanks for highlighting your
problem areas, which also seem to be mine, and
probably several others here. The holding...why is it so hard to
imitate Buffett?

On the subject of insider buying, I spent some time looking at this, and it
turns out it is not too hard to find stocks in which insiders made buys at
significantly higher prices than current ones. So either they misjudged the
market or their fundamentals. I will still look in this area. Yahoo may not be
up to date, but it sure makes it easy. It will be very interesting to see if
any of these stocks see additional insider buying now that the market is
turning down and their stocks have tanked even more.

MarkM: for web-based value articles that are "good" -- that would be in the eye
of the beholder IMO. To get started on SI, I'd look at any of Mike Burry thread
topics -- there's a "related site" spot on this thread page that will take you
to there. For starters also - ideas, books, more info., go to his web page:
www.sealpoint.com.

Also, for investment ideas, sites, etc. scan through this SI thread:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=8625 .

Other value web sites are maintained by people who either have a thread here on
SI or post to this particular thread. In my opinion- they have something to
sell or to hide or else are way too whiny in anticipating the end of the bull
market and the world as we know it. I find these sites disconcerting and
worthless. You maybe as a beginner should read what they say-- but imo, that
will likely just confuse and distract you from what is the basis of value
investing: Finding, buying, and holding undervalued stocks until they become
fully or fairly valued. But of course, this is my definition and my opinion--
not necessarily what is, and what you see as best for you.

Also check out http://investor.msn.com/downhome.asp?

Also moringstar.net.

Try this search engine organizer??(sorry not sure what they call these things)
set to value investing: www.dogpile.com. You should come up with some
interesting sites.

There isn't a free lunch around here -g-. I spent > .5 hour writing this to
you. So if you do dig deep into any of these general starting points... come
back here with what you've found, the "how to's" and the names of good
potential sites and the stocks recommended there -- and share that info. with
us.

Aside: This is not an endorsement of Mike or his recommendations, his
philosophy, his ideas, his stock picks, his friends or associates. And I am not
trying to curry favor with him either! It's just that when there are good (IMO)
sites out there, and I refer to them myself, I am just acknowledging that. And

Paul-

Thanks for your post on web info on value investing info for the less
experienced investor. Glad you took the 0.5 hour to share your thoughts <g>.

I would add www.berkshirehathaway.com as another good starting point. Buffett's
annual letter to shareholders archives is full of value investing wisdom and is
eminently readable.

Burry's book recommendations at his www.sealpoint.com site have also served me
well thus far.

The link you posted to investor.msn.com\downhome.asp? happened to include an
article on Aspen Technology, a company which I should have long ago included on
my watch list, because their unique software is used extensively in my work
(industrial automation). Of course, a good company worth watching does not
imply an undervalued stock.

This brings to light two contrasting approaches to value investing.

One approach, which is to watch companies whose operations or products you
understand very well, and then to buy just those companies on your list which
appear to be underpriced. My watch list includes about 50 good companies right
now, and now and then a couple of great ones take a hard dive for the wrong
reasons. This approach works well when you really have a strong understanding
of the companies and products involved. The Buffettology book seemed to
advocate this sort of approach: Choose the companies, then choose the price at
which you are willing to purchase.

Contrast this to the approach of taking the "stock universe", applying
limitations such as country, company size, etc. and applying other filters
(e.g. net-net criteria) to come up with a short list of companies which bear
looking at. Then, following due diligence, investing in one or two of these
companies, and selling each when it is no longer undervalued. The beauty of
this approach is that quantitative discipline keeps emotion from mucking things
up.

While I do not knock the latter approach, I find the former approach much more
practical for my situation, where time and analytical prowess are both limited.
I do not relish the idea of putting money into businesses which I barely
understand, even "simple" "underpriced" ones like metals, oil drilling, or
Greyhound Bus. While I might succeed, failure seems just as likely because I
will have no clue when to sell beyond my initial investment criteria, and this
is a tough discipline to maintain for the less-seasoned investor. While
learning to invest, one's approach and criteria often change over time, making
the buy and sell decision criteria less coupled, especially when buy and sell
points are years apart.

I would be interested in hearing any comments on the usefulness of the two
approaches, especially as a person's analytical skills develop over the years.

It is funny how investors are generally lumped into two camps, novice and
experienced. "Experienced" seems to generally mean that a person has invested
for more than three months and had a positive return at least once <g>.

I have been investing for about 15 years, though blindly through mutual funds
for ten of those years. I run a very small corporation, so I understand basic
balance sheet numbers, but I wouldn't go so far as to say I know a thimbleful
about "finance".

I still consider myself a novice, because I do not have a rock-solid intuitive
grasp for the interrelationships between the various investment criteria (P/E,
ROE, growth, present value of future earnings, etc. etc. etc.), which make a
stock clearly undervalued or not. I have some of the basics down, enough to
understand what I am buying, but not enough to comparison shop with ease like I
would prefer. That takes a lot more knowledge than is readily acknowledged.

This thread remains an excellent source of real-time education on value
investing. A person just needs to incorporate (and contribute) only those ideas
which you can apply wisely.

Thanks.

<Although I want to keep a stock for three years, a better valued

Value, at least in economic terms, is best viewed as the future potential for
additional market gains a stock has, and not necessarily how cheap it is
relative to the past. Often, there is a very good reason why someone is willing
to sell you a stock at a bargian basement price. For instance, MSFT - pre win
95 was not considered a value play by many. Consider the validity of that view
point with the benefit of hindsight. MSFT had considerable value when taking
into effect its uncontested postions in 32 bit OSs, productivity software and
network effects. Remember, look for price as a function of potential
appreciation/return and not price alone.

XTON- parts are worth more than whole (from Yahoo post)

these things are pretty good value plays when there is a catalyst present.
Seems company announcements (see press releases and/or edgar filing) and recent
13-D filings may bring this one home.

Lawndale files Executone 13-D

In a filing with the SEC on June 15 1998, Lawndale Capital Mgmt filed a 13-D
with over 5.8% of the shares of Executone Information Systems, (OTC-XTON), a
Milford, CT-based company involved in voice and data communications systems. We
believe that the value of the Stock in the public market does not adequately
reflect the value of XTON's underlying businesses and assets.

Our actual 13-D filing can be found directly in SEC's Edgar database at:
http://www.freeedgar.com/search/WL.asp?C=725282&F=SC_13D&D=6/15/1998

summarizing ITEM 4 of our filing:

1) Lawndale believes that, to preserve and maximize shareholder value, XTON's
Board must take other actions in addition to "spinning off" its UniStar lottery
subsidiary to shareholders. In this regard, Lawndale has been in contact with
management and members of the Board of Directors of XTON to discuss the
restructuring alternatives XTON plans to employ to maximize shareholder value.

2) Lawndale agrees with XTON's decision to reject a recent unsolicited
"low-ball" acquisition offer for its $120 million revenue telephony business.
Lawndale believes, however, that the Board of Directors have a fiduciary duty
to negotiate in good faith with any party, (including that which has bid for
the telephony division), when and if such bidder(s) present bona-fide offers
for all or any part of XTON's operations within the range of values determined
by XTON's recent restructuring analysis.

3) While XTON's computer telephony division has a large installed base and
distribution network, recently introduced award-winning products, brand-name
recognition, recurring service contract revenue and a federal/national direct
sales force, Lawndale believes this division does not currently generate enough
revenues to earn an adequate return for shareholders.

4) While Lawndale believes that the termination of geographic exclusivity
previously granted to its largest distributor, Claricom may allow XTON to more
rapidly grow revenues in Claricom's territories, further restructuring of the
computer telephony unit is required to preserve and grow shareholder value.

5) Lawndale believes that XTON's Board of Directors should aggressively pursue
a transaction or transactions that would generate additional stable computer
telephony revenue leveraging XTON's fixed overhead costs thereby increasing
operating cash flows. Transactions accomplishing the above-mentioned goal could
include, but are not limited to, strategic alliances or joint ventures
combining XTON telephony operations with synergistic industry participants that
might also provide additional management with experience and demonstrated
success in the telephony arena.

6) Lawndale has introduced XTON management to prospective customers and
transaction partners for both its computer telephony and healthcare
communications businesses.

7) Lawndale has also been in contact with other significant shareholders of
XTON regarding all the above-mentioned matters. Lawndale may continue such
activities.

Goldman going Public! Sign of a top?

Goldman Sachs has been one of the most bullish firms throughout the 90's as the
market broke every traditional valuation standard in existence. It pretty much
threw caution to the wind as middle class investors plowed ever higher
percentages of their income and net worth into seemingly very overpriced
securities when judged by traditional standards. Throughout that time, any
objective observer of the interpretations of the valuation data that were
coming from Goldman would really have to question what was going on. To call
the interpretations very rosy, overly optimistic, or a bit disingenuous, really
does not do it justice.

Now that financial services stocks are trading at century long highs from a
valuation point of view, Goldman's partners have chosen to cash in their
tickets and come public. (Goldmans may come public at 5X book vs. a long term
average of 2x book for investment banks)

My suggestion is that you take any comment that comes from this firm with a
grain of salt! (Especially Now!) They continue to recommend and interpret
everything in the most favorable light possible while heading to the exit with
their own money and trying to use their overvalued stock as currency for
acquisitions!

Wright: regarding the two approaches to investing:

You crossed a wide swath, fertile for discussion opportunities -g-.
I know I change my investment ideas and methods over time as I gain experience
(or maybe as I lose it if there is such a thing as lost experience). And I try
to maintain a couple of investment approaches -- at the same time. A main thing
I try to watch out for is that I don't confuse myself -- I try to determine
exactly why I am buying a particular stock.

As far as I'm concerned, the holding of the stock may be more critical than the
stock selection. And there's no way to take the emotion out of that aspect of
the buy/hold/sell process. People who do a lot of research on a particular
company may get some relief - they get the confidence or smugness of thinking
they are right. And so I think in that respect, research is beneficial.

Not sure when you came onto this thread, but I've posted before that I am a big
believer in well-diversified stock portfolios (for anyone trying to make/keep
money over a long period-- not for the person trying to retire rich quick.) The
tradeoff then must be that there is no way one person managing in such a
diversified way can be knowledgeable about each particular company, its
competitors, industry outlook, etc. (And I'm not convinced this knowledge is
even necessary for good market performance for growth or value portfolios.)

Probably for a person with limited time to research and follow stocks, a
buy-and-hold concentrated growth portfolio will be better ($ performance as
well as less draining on the psyche) than a value portfolio. The growth stocks
I see though, all seem very expensive -- at least they were before today -g-.

Mike: re. insider trading. I am still developing my understanding of how this
characteristic relates to value investing. We know there are some fund managers
who consider insider buying very important - but what aspects of insider buying
and how do they relate to other factors that the managers use? (I often read
that buying is more significant than selling, since insiders buy to make money,
but they may sell for any number of reasons -- not sure if I believe that, but
I'll confine my remarks to buying.) We also know that there are scads of
insiders out there buying their stock every day -- yet, not all of these
purchases result in profits - either for them or for people
(outsiders)following their lead.

Some criteria which appear significant are size (ref. Bettis, et. al.,
"Mimickers of Corporate Insiders Who Make Large-Volume Trades", FAJ, Sept/Oct
1997), where large-volume is at least 10,000 sh.); who is buying (some say if
CFO buys, that's better than an associated person who might buy more (ref.
articles Indivdual Investor, 2/98); time between purchased date and actual
published date (although apparently some evidence that "abnormal returns appear
to persist for extended time periods" (ref. Bettis); number of buyers (eg.
three or more -- per F. Ponticello of Pru Securities, (Indiv. Investor, op.
cit. p.56); insider buying even after the stock has moved up ("that's awesome"
-Ponticello).
I recall checking all of the picks highlighted in that article, about 3 months
later-- I was not impressed with the stock performance results. Unrelated to
the articles, I've also found out that some companies (one REIT I was
following) pay or subsidize their execs to purchase directly. (That would
nicely mislead outside investers -g-)

That all said, I am buying or have bought into some companies which
concomitantly have insider buying - some heavy or persistent. This includes:
Midway Games (MWY), SWR, RDO, TCMS, LTV, WES, MMO, UC and some others. I may
not make any money (after all, I've been wrong many, many times before), but
from what I can tell, if I go down, there are a bunch of insiders here who will
lead the way. That gives me some comfort to hold on as these stocks 'seek their
support levels' -g- Paul. (And I own a bunch of stocks where there's insider
selling too -- some of these are up and some are down)

I'm curious what the Value Investors in this thread might think of Peapod

Peapod is the leader in online grocery orders / deliveries. It's been around
since 1989, and is *not* an "internet stock". There is a lot of confusion (or,
more bluntly, ignorance) about this stock --- something I like a lot because
it's scaring off a lot of people. But the value is still there.

The company is in the middle of a transition to a warehouse-based business
model, the results of which should start appearing in Q2/Q3 of '98 but more
fully in Q4'98 and Q1'99.

I own some PPOD, wish I owned more. I think buying below $5/share is a fairly

Global Depression Warning from World Bank

By Peter Hartcher and Tony Boyd

A global depression is in prospect unless Japan takes decisive action to
arrest its yen crisis, senior international officials warned yesterday,
amid turmoil in world financial markets and wild swings in the Japanese
currency.

The World Bank's vice-president for East Asia and the Pacific,
Jean-Michel Severino, said that Asia had "entered a period of deep and
long-lasting depression and one should not fool public opinion".

He warned that it was critical to stabilise the yen to help stop the
Asian economic crisis spreading to the rest of the world.

He was backed by the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, Dr Supachai
Panitchpakdi, who said that further big falls in the yen could lead to a
"second Asia crisis" and a "first world depression".

The mounting global pressure on the Japanese Government came as the yen
went for an extraordinary rollercoaster ride, swinging through a range
of more than 4 against the US dollar in a few hours on rumours of Bank
of Japan intervention.

The erratic yen also sparked a volatile day for the Australian dollar.
It plunged to a fresh 12-year low of US57.10› - roared back to a high of
US59› and then fell again, ending in local trading at US58.68›.

Turmoil also hit the sharemarket, with more than $6.96 billion wiped off
the value of Australian stocks as the market fell 1.6 per cent in a
torrid day of trading.

It followed a 207-point, or 2.3 per cent, slump on Wall Street on Monday
- its second-biggest points drop this year and its fifth-biggest loss on
record - sparked by fears that the Asian economic crisis will hit the
earnings of US multinational companies. Pressure on Japan from its Asian
neighbours intensified when Malaysia's Minister for Finance and Deputy
Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, called for speedy government action to
solve its problems. "The weakness of the yen and Tokyo's slowness in
putting its economy in order, particularly its foot dragging instead of
strengthening its fragile banking system and opening its markets, are
making the regional situation gloomy indeed," he said in a speech in
Kuala Lumpur.

Speaking in Melbourne, the chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-Hwa,
and the deputy director of the International Monetary Fund's
Asia-Pacific office, David Nellor, also nominated Japan as the central
element of the unfolding crisis and called for urgent action from the
Japanese Government.

The World Bank's Mr Severino - who is responsible for $US6 billon in
annual lending to the region - said the next four to five months were
critical to stop the spread of the economic crisis from Asia.

"The depression is being exported from one country to another and
everyone is going down at the same time . . . it's also very clear that
if this situation lasted, no country could be left out of the problem,"
he said.

"I would find it absolutely critical that one find a way to stabilise
the yen," he said.

"This is a critical juncture for management of this crisis. In the
coming four to five months, we can find a way out . . . or enter a
period [where it will be] spreading around the world."

He said that while stabilising the yen was necessary, it was not a
sufficient condition to halt the spread of the crisis.

Dr Supachai - a former central banker with a doctorate in economics -
shared Mr Severino's concern.

"If the yen would drop without limit or bottom, then a second Asia
crisis will take place.

"And that would mean a first-world economic depression."

He said that "pressure could mount if Japan is left alone - the whole
world should concentrate on Japan" to bring about decisive action. He
was "deeply worried", he said.

Asked what level the yen needed to reach to set in train a global
depression, he declined to nominate a figure but said "it's already
hurting us at 145" yen to the US dollar.

The two men were speaking to reporters at the Australia Summit
conference in Melbourne.

The yen has lost about 80 per cent of its value against the US dollar
since its peak in 1995.

Market nervousness about central bank intervention saw the yen move
through a 4 trading range in the space of a few hours yesterday
morning, from a high of 146.75 to a low of 142.35, before it slumped
back to a close at 144.85.

It was believed to be the most volatile day's trading in the yen since
April 1995, when the G-7 central banks began a concerted intervention to
turn around the US dollar.

The wild day on Tokyo currency and stockmarkets ended last night with
the yen back near 145 at 144.85. The stockmarket was at its lowest
level in six months and on the brink of breaking through a two-year low.

Gloom about the Japanese economy deepened when Japan's central bank, the
BoJ, raised doubts about the likely impact of the Government's 16.6
trillion yen ($US188 billion) fiscal stimulus package.

The BoJ, which has been noted for its frank assessments of the economy,
said the positive impacts of the package could be weakened "if the
ongoing rapid deterioration in employment and income conditions further
dampens the overall economic activities".

It said that because of the present high inventory level and the
relatively large output gap, "prices are likely to be weak for some
time".

Mr Severino said there was limited time to deal with the crisis.

He said that the situation in Asia was more serious than the Latin
American debt crisis of the 1980s. In that case, he said, "only some
countries were going down and there was a major engine of growth in the
region [the US]".

In Asia, however, everyone was going down together and, with Japan's
recession, there was no engine of growth.

"Finding a way of bringing the whole region up together is a critical
challenge," he said.

Mr Severino, formerly economic and financial adviser to the French
Cabinet, listed three prerequisites to a regional recovery:
Stabilise the yen.
Prevent a Chinese devaluation of its currency.
Adopt more expansionary policies in the five most desperately
crisis-racked economies of Asia.

re PPOD. Well it certainly is scaring me off too. If it's not an internet
stock, then it must be a grocery stock. Competing with Albertsons and Wal Mart
and/or Price/Costco. Ha. Going to be a lot easier for these grocery/warehouse
companies to get up on the net and home deliver than it will be for little PPOD
(200 employees)to compete in their biz. That would happen to PPOD maybe the
first time one of these giants sees PPOD make a profit. PPOD's PSR, P/BV look
mediocre to me. Only two years history I can find. Sure there's a margin of
safety with $3 cash. And I see that sales are growing. But with their losses
... they could burn through that $3 fast.
No way do I see this stock at $15 === 'course I've been wrong many, many times
before. You see value here at near $5 and a triple. And you want to buy more.
This is the best value stock you can find???
I think you fell in love. Here's what I sometimes do when I get like that. Sell
the position. If you read the Crimi post here, the world is coming to an end
anyway, or the market will collapse at best. So just wait it out for two weeks.
Just stay out of the position for two weeks. Then, if you still think PPOD is a
value, you haven't found anything better, buy it all back. It's amazing that
when you ask people if they could divorce their spouse with no consequence and
remarry 'em again (also with no consequence) how many people say they'd divorce

grocery delivery is deli-sliced-extra-thin (near 0%!!). PPOD's business plan
defies logic: sending people into grocery stores to fill orders at retail.
Their website is user-unfriendly, requiring users to download software unlike
every other on-line store. We're hardly talking value here. Now PPOD is
switching to a warehouse-based system. This will simply burn cash faster; the
business plan simply doesn't and won't add up to profitability ever. The stock
actually should sell at liquidation value (cash per share + nominal additional
for assets).

Please don't take as a flame, it's not. My .02, sell, and if you are looking
for a grocery value stock, consider Albertson's on NYSE.

Allen, I wouldn't pay .78 to see you get NAKD -g-. Why don't we have any
females on this thread?? -- then it might be a different story -gg-.

To make any money on this stock, I think somebody has got to be a financial
analyst with guts -- like Marty Whitman. And I think there are actually a
couple on the thread who could do it. In these situations, the
lenders/creditors cover themselves I'd guess-- it's just too tough for me to
figure if there's any value for the stockholders. And as I've said before, I
thought I had $4 of bv with my RACC (now at .2). But in bankruptcy, apparently
I do not. So I now leave it to my attorneys to determine and sort out.
Also, my opinion is that if you are calling NAKD a bet on a long shot-- save
the money for Vegas or the track. That would seem to be more fun IMO. Paul.

FWIW, I find Peapod very interesting. I'm putting some time into it, with a lot
of questions to answer. Certainly not a classic value investment, but not one
to dismiss out of hand either. The potential upside if anything went right is
very high (I'm not talking about it becoming the next Microsoft, I'm talking a
two-cent surprise one quarter driving it up $5. The problem is getting a handle
on the downside. Most of the share price is indeed cash on the balance sheet,
but I agree with Paul that they could burn through that in a couple of
quarters. Nowhere near a conclusion yet, but I think its worth the work. Neat
business too. Thanks for the idea. And yes, Paul, I am skeptical. I am always
skeptical.

Hi Ron. No, I don't feel comfortable with insiders holding large positions of
the company. I think they have a tendency to run the biz. as if it's their own
private honey pot. But that's true as well (IMO) with many of these entrenched
managements (and they get these darn humongous option deals ---yech.) Sometimes
though (maybe always), investing is about living with paradoxes. If the stock
price of the owner/manager co. looks right, I'll buy (e.g. VO, ICOC, CCN, OEA,
etc.); sometimes I'll just build a small position over a period of years as I
get used to management (e.g. Block Drug=BLOCA). Although I have no idea how any
of these owner/managers actually spend their SG&A monies, and I'm very much
subject to somebody's personal whim on what the business model will be (e.g.
VO) Paul

Andrew: re. XTON. I still think the price is too high at 1.3x book and losing
money, and no assurance that 5% owner can achieve changes.

Difficulty I have is that the market is down so much and small cap stocks in
particular, that there seem to be a plethora of possibilities out there now.
And some of my current holdings are down so much, it's very tempting to just
add to my positions (which I'm doing). So I weigh all this in looking at new
things. And if I can't see the value real quickly, I want to move on to the
next possibility. In this context, in the quick scan I gave XTON, I wasn't
tempted to look further. Paul

paul, take a look at summit tech. ticker beam. it has been beaten down for a
while, has a market cap of 160 million and over 100 million in cash. plus, it
has finally started being profitable in what appears to be a good industry. oh,
and almost no debt and insiders buying. looks like an excellent opportunity for
a long term gain to me.
just thought i would add some to the thread. good luck

You comments on Peapod got me interested enough to spend about two hours
scouring the financials. It is interesting. The business model makes sense, and
the balance sheet is just as you say. More than 2/3 of the share price is cash,
with no debt. I don't care if its an internet stock or not, its a business and
if I can understand the economics, which I think I can, I can evaluate it
intelligently.

I would pass, for the following reasons.
1. Although I like the balance sheet, the business plan is going to burn
through the cash long before they generate positive earnings.
2. The Wall Street research is simply funny. Membership has been growing at
50-70%, and for any young growth company, you would assume that would decline.
But the Wall Street models assume 50% growth in 1998 and 1999, then 100% growth
in 2000 and 2001. All this with minimal dilution from new equity financing,
even though the company will be HUGELY cash flow negative throughout that
forecast. (If you are looking at an analyst's forecasts for a growth company,
and there is no balance sheet, be VERY skeptical!) IF THIS ROSY SCENARIO COMES
TRUE, you get a profit of $1.00 per share in 2001. Keep my critique in
perspective, you wouldn't need $1.00 a share three years out to make a $5 stock
a winner if you held it until then, but thats not the kind of bet I make.
Especially when I understand the reckless assumptions needed to even get to
that number.
3. At first glance, I thought I saw a barrier to entry in that they can sign
exclusives with grocers in their local market. But on further review I see that
they link up with one grocer in each market. Which means that IF it works, a
competitor comes along and links up with a competitive grocer. The technology
is not a barrier to entry - that can be copied - There is no barrier to entry
in this business. The moment it looks like it might become profitable, these
guys have a lot of new friends. The business model has severe flaws.

Not to say it couldn't triple if they beat a quarter by a couple pennies. Its
an internet stock, and these are all "valued" on these highly speculative
assumptions. By that logic, it probably should trade higher. But that's not my
game. I see no reasonable margin of safety here. It was an interesting exercise
to study the business, since we are going to see more and more of these (and a
lot of them are going to bust) in the next few years. And several of them are
going to be phenomenally profitable investments.

So thanks for the idea. Hope my comments are helpful to you too. Bottom line, I
agree with Paul. You're looking for value in a place you are very unlikely to
find it. Value meaning a reasonable margin of safety. Wait a year or two, and I
think there will be plenty of busted internet stocks at very interesting
valuations, just as they start generating some real earnings.

Paul, re: TIMT

What's your take on the stock price fall. I still can't find
a good fundamental reason, and insiders bought up in the upper
20's. I'll keep holding.

Also, I'm on the verge of buying Seagate under 20, but am
debating SEG vs. QNTM. QNTM remains amazingly profitable,
and SEG has the lower debt load. Both should last to the next
up cycle.

I have never seen a company with less direct insider ownership, even counting
small recent purchases, and would not consider it for that reason alone.

Virgil V. re: BEAM. Not sure about this one. Business model is changing with
new mgmt. PSR and P/BV about 1.7. Little high to me on straight numbers basis.
Price is creeping up from lows. BEAM requires more study now than I can devote
to it. Looks like if they can execute their plans, they could capture
investors' attention- become a hot stock. (Although I don't know their
potential eye doctor market.) JMO; I'll watch it for a bit though. Paul S.

re TIMT: Still holding TIMT and adding as stock has dropped. I see no change in
fundamentals. Probably if there is a change and when I read of it, the stock
will be lots lower (:-/ (wry grin)). Negatives appear to be slowdown in Boeing
build rate, general decline in metals/minerals stocks, and decline in some
metals prices. I'm still betting with the insiders: Boeing will eventually
build planes on a schedule that doesn't get pushed out in time, and many of
those planes will use titanium.
Kind of comes down to: does one believe a mistake has been made just because
the stock price declines? Does the market KNOW more than we do, and this is
reflected in the price? Sure seems that way now. However, I bought based on
some factors that don't seem to have changed... and now I want to give those
factors a chance to work out and lift the stock higher. Well, that's my plan
anyway.

I have no opinion right now on SEG or QTN. Disk drive investments - WDC and APM
have been my worst investments that I can remember. And I am still in these
disk drive business (I know SEG has other offsetting businesses also). Seems
like all these stocks reflect going-out-of-business prices. Now I think that at
least one or more will.

Re: XTON changes already in works

appreciate demands on your time limit you to quick scan. More importantly as a
value investor I know "parts are worth more than whole" situations could take
time when management doesn't recognize situation or they have to be persuaded
to do something. So to make work easier, simply read Lawndale's full 13-d at
ITEM 4. It summarizes the dates and details of company actions/announcements
all in one document. the 13-d could be found at
http://www.freeedgar.com/search/WL.asp?C=725282&F=SC_13D&D=6/15/1998

1) the company recognizes and stated publicly XTON parts are worth more than
whole (when stock at $2.125/share)
2) retained furman selz to prepare restructuring alternatives;
3) set in motion full distribution/spin-off of UniStar lottery subsidiary (runs
the USlottery on the internet at http://www.uslottery.com )
4) exploring options on core healthcare communications and computer telephony
businesses.
5) CEO who owns 8% of stock stepping aside, facilitating all options
6) Heartland Advisors amends 13-G into 13-D with almost 25%
7) Lawndale files 13-D with 5.8%
