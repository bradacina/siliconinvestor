Staples (SPLS) on sale here... Imagine that weak Europe Demand.
Earnings are still growing and Current PE is 10.5 with 3% yield,

Staples international sales fall on weak Europe demand
Wed May 16, 2012 9:23am EDT

* Q1 adj EPS $0.30 vs est $0.30

* Q1 revenue $6.10 bln vs est $6.18 bln

* Outlook for 2012 unchanged

* Shares down 4 pct in premarket trading

May 16 (Reuters) - Staples Inc, the largest U.S. office supply chain, said
sales at its international business fell for the third straight quarter, as
demand in Europe remains weak, sending its shares down 4 percent in premarket
trading.

Sales at Staples' international business, which makes up about 20 percent of
the company's revenue, fell 8 percent, as same-store sales in Europe declined 6
percent.

The company -- which operates in 26 countries in North and South America,
Europe and Asia -- kept its 2012 outlook, as a slow recovery in the U.S.
economy is also curtailing sales growth.

"The international business continues to flounder, but that really does not
come as a surprise," UBS analyst Michael Lasser wrote in a client note.

Staples has cut costs as sales in Europe and some other international markets
show no signs of recovering.

JPMorgan analysts said they were encouraged by the company's cost-cutting
efforts.

"It is only a first step on the path of acknowledging the issues facing the
business," JPMorgan analysts said in a note.

The company's smaller rivals, OfficeMax Inc and Office Depot Inc, have also
been reducing costs to boost profits.

First-quarter net income fell to $187.1 million, or 27 cents per share, from
$198.2 million, or 28 cents per share, a year ago.

Excluding items, the company earned 30 cents per share, meeting analysts'
expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Total sales fell marginally to $6.1 billion, missing analysts' expectations of
$6.18 billion.

For the full year, Staples said it expects sales to rise in the low
single-digits, with <a href='http://www.reuters.com/finance/earnings'

I agree on Gold. I down own a bit of NEM at 44.1$ a few days ago since it does
look cheap based on metrics (not that it seems to matter much). I also added s
bit CLF@52$ (getting close to a full position there) BUT, some KSB3.DE @407Euro
and a bit more DELL @15.15$.

Right now I am about 75% invested, up from 50% a few weeks ago.

The 15 day deadline "to replace imports with goods manufactured in the country"
from the Argentina government is impossible to meet (imo), and I think the
failure to make the impossible happen is going to be used as an excuse to
nationalize the mining operations from the companies in question as well.
Argentina is uninvestible right now and other South American countries like
Brazil and Bolivia seem to be going down a similar, albeit less extreme path.

On another note, here is an example that patience pays off. i have been sitting
on this duck since 2010 and accumulated shares here and there in the 4's and
finally 3 $ range. I accumulated over a long time in this two Branch failed
mutual thrift conversion that went dark (per SEC). I sold some shares at 5.85$
and most today at 6.46$ and thereabouts. Not a huge gain (~50%) for a microcap
but i don't think it has too much risk either.

Yes looking at REPYY.PK but i have not done my homework?

What is the value of REPYY assuming they get nothing from Argentina in return
for the YPF stake. Do you know Repsol's reserves ex. YPF? I looked at it a
while ago and found only consolidated numbers. I hope someone did do the
homework and calculated valuation ex YPF.

Do you think they can keep the dividend? YPF paid an extremely high dividend
and Repsol benefited from that but that source is gone. I think this makes a
dividend cut likely.

>I think the failure to make the impossible happen is going to be used as an
excuse to nationalize the mining operations from the companies in question as
well...

Here's 2 clips from PAAS conf call. sounds like they are working the issue and
that they are not expecting nationalization.

"It is important to note that we have succeeded in reducing our reliance on
imported parts and materials by some 50% since we started operating in
Manantial in late 2008. We believe these discussions will result in a more
realistic expectation of Argentine supply development timelines, which will
bring improvements to the current situation in the near future for all mining
companies who currently operate in Argentina.

Q: And just lastly, you talked about a 50% reduction in import exposure. What's
the exposure now? And is there a level of exposure to imports that management
has a goal in terms of being comfortable with?

A: That 50% reduction went from $25 million down to $12 million for those
materials and parts. Our goal is to make sure that we keep quality parts and
materials that allow us to operate our mine effectively and efficiently. And
that's been our challenge now is trying to push through that barrier where
we're at to get the quality parts that we need to operate. And what we're
finding is those that have attempted to replace some of our parts, they haven't
always performed the way we'd like. So there's 2 things going on as the
Argentine suppliers are trying to improve quality of their supplies and as they
realize what they can and can't supply, they're starting to release and allow
us to import those things they can't and they recognize they can't. So what our
goal is long term is to continue to work with the mining association in
Argentina with the secretary of mining, with the production ministries and try
to optimize and expand their capabilities to find better mining operations in
their country...

(Of course tangible bv for oil companies can change depending on several

Tesco: Relatively low p/e for a relatively high roe. Apparently not doing as
well now in Britain as it has in past; still dominant --- not just a grocery
store there-- I've read more like an Amazon where you can order food and other
items on-line. I like its geographical diversity. Its stores in my area seem to
be struggling though -- they're going from small to smaller stores, and trying
to adjust products to local tastes (more Hispanic, more recognizable brand
names, etc). So far, several misses and not great pricing.

I believe I'm now entering the stock somewhere near the price where Mr. Buffett
made some of his purchases:
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/9024976/Warre
-Buffett-ups-his-stake-in-Tesco.html

Fwiw, looking at SWY and KR, while they can show relatively low p/e for
relatively high roe, their numbers (results) are more erratic than what TSCDY
has shown over the past decade. (Just talking numbers. I realize they have
different business model than TSCDY does.) Plus, as I look at the raw numbers,
these two big USA companies have a much high d/e ratio than TSCDY. I'm still
waffling on SVU. I have AHONY (owns one of the convenience chains where Mrs.

BDC - I read Einhorn's book that you recommended. Very good recommendation. The
level of blind acceptance of company propaganda by retail investors and lack of
effort by professional portfolio managers is astounding. Especially the latter.
The facts of ALD's accounting misstatements were there, the work was done and
easily available. Lazy lazy lazy!

At any rate. page 153: on march 25,2003:

"...subpoena from the SEC... related to Farmer Mac, MBIA, Allied Capital. and
ACAS. ACAS was one of ALD's competitors, which we had not shorted or
criticized. In fact, we owned it in 1998-1999. It had the same business model
as ALD, so some believed that our criticisms applied to it as well. In fact,
most of our criticisms had nothing to do with the business model. I don't
believe that there is anything inherently wrong with BDCs. Greenlight's
criticisms are specific to ALD, its accounting and corporate behavior."

For myself, I got out of ALD in 2002, and moved to ACAS. I got nailed with ACAS
in 2008, but I sold sooner than most, and moved my ACAS $$ to beaten up pref
shares which went 2x or 3x since then. So I got my money back, but rode a
different horse to do it.

I saw that ARCC weathered 2008 pretty fairly, and they bought ALD in 2010 (but
not all of ALD's assets). I own a bit of ARCC now. My remaining issue with ARCC
is that they now have as CFO, the same person who was CFO at ALD -- Penni Roll.
According to Einhorn, she was in it deep at ALD. She allowed and contributed to
the bad "accounting and corporate behavior" that Einhorn documented. She was
behind the the bogus accounting and valuations, made false statements, and
published a white paper with faulty accounting arguments justifying that ALD
did not have to follow SEC rules for BDC accounting. How in the hell did she
end up on her feet? Sure someone can change their spots, but a CFO should have
the backbone to stand up to an unethical CEO. That is a CFO's job. This doesn't
necessarily blacklist ARCC for me, but their choice of a CFO is astounding.

Article in today's Barron's by V. Racanelli on Hess:

http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111904370004577396404247922194.h
ml?mod=BOL_hpp_mag&_nocache=20120519073245#articleTabs_article%3D2

Negative aspects about HES include:

"On April 25, Hess reported first-quarter net of $509 million, or $1.50 a
share, down from $619 million or $1.82—a bit less than expected. (Both periods'
results exclude extraordinary items.) Meanwhile, revenue at the mostly
oil-producing company—its output is 70% liquids and 30% natural gas—fell 7%, to
$9.75 billion.

Still, this wasn't what caused investors to dump the stock. In a conference
call, Hess reduced its production expectations for its important Bakken fields
in North Dakota to less than 60,000 barrels per day oil equivalent (Bpoed) from
60,000 Bpoed. Currently, it averages 47,000 there. In addition, it suggested
that it might have to raise 2012 capital expenditures higher than its original
$6.8 billion guidance. The market took that badly. Hess stock fell 7% that day
and slid as low as $44.10 Wednesday. And analysts have been piling on, with at
least six cutting their rating on the stock since mid-April.

Longer-term, Hess shares are down almost 50% from highs of 87 in February of
last year, wildly underperforming crude oil itself, which is essentially flat
over the same stretch. Such a sustained divergence suggests shareholders are
unhappy with the company's production disruptions—as in Libya last year—and the
its habit lately of missing analysts' expectations."

Positives include:

"Hess trades at less than seven times consensus analysts' earnings estimates of
$6.40 a share this year, not much above its low of 6.4. The shares are also
near all-time lows in enterprise value (stock-market capitalization plus net
debt) to Ebidta, too. Hess seems like a bank; the stock is trading at just 0.8
times book value.

Based on existing assets, production, and proven cash flow, there's long-term
value in Hess, says Cameron Clement, a portfolio manager with Cornerstone
Investment Partners, which owns a significant stake in the exploration and
production outfit. Granted, it's a show-me stock now, but after the steep drop,
'the bar is pretty low.'

Hess's balance sheet is strong and, on average, the company has returned 14% on
equity over the past decade. As of Dec. 31, it had 621 million barrels of
proven oil, condensate, and natural-gas liquids, plus 1.2 trillion Mcf
(thousand cubic feet) of natural gas.

There are other subtle factors that suggest Hess might be at least bottoming in
the mid-40s. Insiders have started to buy significant amounts of stock in the
open market. In an April 30 SEC filing, Chairman John Hess, for example,
reported purchasing 48,000 shares at $52.

What's notable there, says Jonathan Moreland, director of research at
insiderinsights.com, is that the executive previously had been a steady

Re: Hess Corporation (HES)

Paul -

When they calculate Tangible Book Value (TBV) and/or BV are the BOEPD reserve
estimates used in the calculation? Therefore, with their Bakken property
production reduced, I would think that the TBV and/or BV would be reduced a bit
too. In this case it would be quite small but I just was not sure how the TBV
is derived (especially for Integrated Oil Companies) and how the reserve
estimates are factored into this number.

I recall several years ago where Royal Dutch had announced on a Monday that
their estimated reserves were 30% too high and with one news release adjustment
over $1B in "perceived" value disappeared "poof". The stock sold off but not by
30%. It still made me sell my position as I was suspect on all their other
reserve estimates. The stock traded flat for several months but eventually
traded at similar PE's to it's peers.

I know that these calculations are not an exact science especially with well
depletion estimates that vary significantly from type of well and geographic
region. I wonder what the average age of their Bakken wells are and if they may
be seeing larger depletion amounts vs their estimates. This may be the case
with many if not all of the older production wells in that region. Maybe many
of the other E&P companies may experience the same accelerated depletion rates
as their wells age and this has yet to be priced into the market for those
companies that operate in that geographic region (ie Bakken Shale area).

That may be another reason to go with a larger well diversified (across several
geographical regions)company rather than a a specific E&P play.

Hmm. I have to say I am not sure about these tangible book value number
valuations for oil companies as generated by by the people who publish the
information I use.

I will guess (I will defer to people here who actually know the accounting
methodology.) that fluctuations in reserves - in the amount of reserves and the
pricing of those reserves - is accounted for in net asset figures. Which I
guess are available (if the company publicly issues this info) once a year
after the independent firm that the oil company hires to make these
evaluations, issues its report to the company. NAV fluctuates based on this
info. Otoh, book value I guess is based on lower of cost or market of assets
acquired, and with that being the case, I further guess that book value is not
usually or routinely adjusted for the dollar value of reserves on the balance
sheet. And therefore not by the stock screen people who just use the company's
balance sheet to make a routine calculation of tangible book value from the
company's balance sheet.

For example, here we have YCharts giving us HES's tangible book value of $16.8B
(higher than HES's market price of $15B) from subtracting a couple of items
from HES's balance sheet:

http://ycharts.com/companies/HES/book_value_of_tangible_equity
==============
I well-remember the Shell abrupt reserve adjustment and the resulting sharp
stock price drop. (I don't know if book value was affected or not. Seemingly,
it was such a large drop in reserve amounts that it was significant and
material, so maybe it did drop book value too.) In any case it was a very
shocking announcement. And cautionary for investors.

re HES - the Credit Suisse Report dated 4/26 (available in Etrade) and the
April earnings transcripts in Sekingalpha provide some color. There seems to be
a consensus that based on a Sum of parts, HES is worth 80-90$/share. You can
throw just about any value metric at HES (EV/EBITDA, EV Cash flow, Tangible
book, EV/ BOE, PE) and HES looks cheap.

The problem is managements track record which basically boil down to a high
finding cost for reserves. Last year for example, they spent almost 50$/brl to
find reserves. HES claims that some expenses (like the Bakken acreage,
infrastructure spending in Bakken etc.) are prepaid expenses for 2P reserves.
The proof lies in the pudding and if HES management is correct finding costs
for proved reserves should fall, as spending flattens and becomes more
efficient. Right now, management record card looks bad, because they
essentially spent all their cash flow, pay very little dividend and show little
proved reserve growth. But we know from some comparisons with competitors data
(discussed earlier in this thread) that HES got their acreage in Bakken very
cheap and has at least some very high flow rates. I also think that the money
spent on rail loading infrastructure (to move the oil) and pipelines will be
worth the expense. Shuttinfg down the money loosing refinery (while a hit too
book value) is a win win too, so at some point (2013,2014?) management should
be able to unlock value.

Incidentally, reading through the report (and some others), CVX (which I don't
own) looks pretty good on almost all metrics, including upstream PV10/ EV. CVX
is also a company that has become better over time from a laggard to almost
being on the same level than XOM and probably better on some counts. So, I
think I'll do some work on CVX and maybe start a position in that name rather
than adding to TOT or COP.

All of these large oilers seem to have some plusses and minuses to consider. As
others here seem to be doing, I hold a basket of several integrateds, rather
than trying to pick "the best" one. If I had to choose a favorite, as of today
and subject to my changing whims, I'm for Charlie Maxwell's (refer to earlier
posts) Suncor. I hold some SU shares and am waiting to add more if stock will
continue to fall closer to its 12-mo lows.

Reiterating, SU's plus is that it already has 35 years of oil to be pulled up
and out from its oil sands,i.e. it has no exploration risk (and presumably no
geopolitical risk with Canada). Otoh, the minus is that SU is oil sands, so
there may be cost per barrel issues (as I believe you may have suggested), and
there may be as-yet unknown or significant environmental issues that may come
to the forefront.

I also am considering SU. Now that PWE and ERF are at or near long term lows,
do these begin to rank higher on your list? PWE and ERF have exposure in both
Canada and the US while SU is strictly Canadian Oil Sands (w/ very long term
proven reserves - a big plus).

I do like to have diversification into other geographical areas, especially
Australia with their NG resources (large potential exports to Japan & China).
However, many of these countries are looking at or have implemented a
"resource" tax. Australia is one of these countries. Do you know if Canada has
considered such a tax.

This last week, it seemed like several of the Canadian natural resource
companies sold off more than the others. I wonder if the market might be
pricing in some other costs (like a resource tax). The only other thing I can
think of is their NG and/or Oil may be discounted as (1) it is somewhat land
locked until new pipeline(s) are built and (2) Canadian NG is worth less
because of the over supply in the U.S..

I still have CNX (New 52wk low) and CLF (very near 52wk low) on my buy/watch
list. CNX is 50% NG and 50% coal and CLF is 80% iron ore and 20% coal. CLF w/
interests in Australia may also have to deal with their new "resource tax".

So far w/i the last 10 days, I have added to both ERF and PWE. I have owned
these for years and have lowered my average cost substantially. Both positions
are underwater as of last week.

There has been some discussion Oil prices could drop substantially further
(maybe into the $70.00/barrel-$50/barrel) area. My strategy is to continue to
add shares to my current oil/ng holdings as oil prices fall. I can always sell
my higher priced shares on any price rise so for me, another drop lower is a
gifted buying opportunity.

My future buy strategy is going to be more based on price than any other
factor. I will be watching the price of Oil and the new 52wk lows hit in the
companies in my basket. The difficult part is going to be just when to pull the
trigger as Oil cracks through each $10.00 barrier.

look to re-enter at some point.
2. SLW i added some shares and bought some leaps.
3. axu i sold 1/2 of my position at a loss.
4. mil- listening to the conference call. I think this is a huge bargain at
these levels. smith says company is doing well now operating on all cylinders
so far in 2012. bv up to $8.90 and a lot of that is cash. div is around 2.5%.

5. aab.to sharply reduced their investment nav ( not including their royalty )
to .71 since they sold their royalty for at least .21 that makes their nav at
least .92 in the meantime the div is around 5%. if junior miners ever recover
they should do well. in their reduction of navs looks like they dropped the
value of their private holdings by 50% because of market conditions, and the
value of their warrant portfolio dropped from $15 million to a little over $1
million or so.

6. als.to continues to be very cheap. they have lots of cash and the value of
its stake in alderon is close to $100 million.people close to the company
believe alderon has lots of potential upside so the rest of the companies
royalty streams and business acumen is free.

I may stop reporting on these companies as there doesnt seem to be any

Paul -

Thank you for the link. It puts Australia's "resource tax" into perspective.

<blockquote>The new mineral resource tax does not apply to all minerals. It
applies only to iron ore and coal. Gold, copper, nickel and uranium miners all
are off the hook. And at 30 per cent, it sits well below the 40 per cent
petroleum resources rent tax introduced by the Hawke government in
1986.</blockquote> Australia, like many other Countries already impose a tax on
Oil & NG so the new tax does not make their petroleum tax any higher.

Still no mention about Canada. Hopefully, if they ever consider increasing
and/or adding any new "resource" taxes, they will float a trial balloon. I
still remember the 'Halloween Massacre' on the Royalty Trusts - no warning.

Didn't realize HES had exposure to Australia NG; From the article you posted:
<blockquote>Hess plans to make a decision by the year-end on whether to fund a
five-well drilling program that’s expected to start in 2013, he said. Any
partnership accord to develop Falcon’s additional holdings in the Beetaloo
region, about 600 kilometers (373 miles) south of Darwin, would probably be
reached after Hess commits to the drilling plans, he said.The five wells may
cost about $50 million, Macaulay estimated, saying those expenses have yet to
be determined. Hess has paid the company $20 million and agreed to fund $40
million of initial work that started last year, Falcon said in July.
</blockquote> So, maybe I will just hold onto my HES shares and focus on my
small E&P basket of stocks.

FWIW, I checked out the most recent presentation for Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)
(Q1-2012) and according to pg-10-. Total Supply Costs (per barrel of Oil) range
from $45/barrel-$55/barrel. (Note: Pg-18- show the cash flows they generate for
each barrel as this varies with the price of oil).
http://goo.gl/JUL7b

SU at the margin only is really profitable when Oil is well above
$70.00/barrel. So, perhaps the real "Value" is to accumulate shares (ie all
their proven reserves) when/if Oil prices "crash" and short term SU speculators
throw out their shares at bargain prices. It's just a matter of time to see
that we are again at "peak oil" pricing and $100/barrel Oil seems cheap again.

AAB.TO,

I have owned AAB.TO under the mistaken impression at the time that gold miners
were cheap relative to gold, that the discount to NAV was attractive, and that
management would be able to add value to the portfolio. That was a huge
mistake. Junior miners have gotten killed, and thus the NAV has too. Junior
miners are way too dependent on investor sentiment (continually need to raise
money to develop projects).

I have a lost a lot on this one -- it still seems attractive to me, but the
risk remains -- the sector is too dependent on investor sentiment. It is
preferable to invest in value plays where Mr. Market can't drain all the value
away.

That being said, I'm inclined to hold this one in light of the attractive
discount and the depressed nature of gold mining shares. I am not convinced any
more that management is adding value. I hope they prove me wrong.

stocks are the combination of hedge funds entering , bigger mines coming in and

trade and it has not been a good time for this sector. aab.to is one of my
largest positions and my portfolio has really taken it on the chin. now the nav
has not only been marked down by public valuations but by management decision
to mark down how they valued their private investments as well. and the warrant
holdings values have been decimated. however eventually i belive the sector
will recover and hopefully aab.to will recover with it. in the meantime the
dividend of close to 5% means you get paid to wait. i also derive solice from

stocks often turn up before good news is widely known (due to what I call
Silicon valley information leakage) , so it is in my opinion to buy now close
to multi year lows.

I think the Varian buy is an example of questionable capital allocation and it
is one reason the price is low, but I think it will be accreditive to earnings
eventually. Semi equipment is not a growth industry any more but it is an

re AMAT - they don't disclose their clients in their 10K but I think analyst
know who they are - Intel,TSMC and the memory chip and LCD makers. Largest
sales by Geography are China, Taiwan and Korea (Samsung?).

Per the latest reports ASML surpassed AMAT for the number one position. These
numbers do not include Varian, so AMAT may possibly regain the top position.

Several recent analyst reports vary widely in opinion on AMAT from buy to
avoid. Seems like the avoid and/or mixed ratings stem from the weakness in
AMAT's solar division which is undergoing restructuring.

I am not a trader, so the short term gyrations are not that important to me.
The big question is if DELL can continue to succeed long term. This quarter was
weak, but the real question is where we go from here. If they can recover and
grow, then the stock is very cheap. If they can't and will lose more sales,
then even $12 may not be good price.

I agree. Also, you would think their business model is changing. Before they
were a low-cost producer of pc's now they are competing with the big boys with
IT services/Hardware cloud etc. Will margins shrink?

IMO, if you want to own this one I think you can get it cheaper than what it is
now.

Hey all, sorry about my lousy mention of DELL on this board a short while back.
I was very wrong...

I'm mostly cash looking to put some money to work, but recently nearly
everything I want to buy is just going down...

Jurgis, well i do trade short term. More importantly i do try to buy cheaper if
i can help it. My experience is that a severe earnings miss (and this was a big
miss, not just a headline issue) is mostly followed by an extended weakness, so
it is often (but not always) best to sell quickly , before the institutions are
going their thing.

FWIW, i bought back 3/4 of my DELL sold shares at 12.36$.

DELL right now trades for the price of a cigar but, which is not justified,
imo.

"...glad to finally see some serious redness out there."

Imo, value investors who have cash should be looking at this market of falling
stocks and be making selective purchases now. Of course when fear rules- if
that's what's happening, then it may be difficult to not also follow the crowd
that keeps moving to the exits. And it could be that maybe the building really
is on fire.

Anyway, many fills (buys) for me today.

I did not get any fills today. I do have a lot of buy points - as always. All
are lower and none were hit.

~20-25% cash.

i bought more mil today. i like the company i like mr. smith approach to making
money. buying assets on the cheap and then developing them.he says the equity
is around $8.90 the stock sells for $6.90 and has lots of cash and little debt.
Mr. Smith has overtime delivered returns of better than 15% on equity to
shareholders. So I hope he will be able to take advantage of some more
opportunities down the road. in the meantime i will take the 3% div.

Market down again, now -150 or more on the Dow. Good buying opportunity. it
seems to me.

Agree, valuations in many cases on alot of stocks I'm following are getting
attractive to me again (many that show up on my watch lists have been crushed
more than the market overall), and I did buy a couple small caps today (GTAT
and TCX) and had a couple other orders in that didn't get filled.

I'm just getting gun-shy as I'm not in sync w/ things at the moment. Seems
nearly everything I've bought recently is underwater - often getting trashed at
earnings (PETS, GES, AIXG, DELL...). It's like the market is telling me the
things I'm buying are down for a reason right now, and I'd be better off
waiting to find out why. The only recent buys I have that are up are BRK.B and
a little company that got bought out, ESIC. At some point things will bottom
out (unless we're entering another 2008 scenario) but I'm just trying to stay
small while keeping dipping my toe in the water w/ attractive buys until things
stop getting regularly crushed.

MET @ 30.2$ - looks like I got some more MET today too. I like their plans to
increase ROE from ~10% to ~13% in 2016. If that works, the stock should trade
at a premium to the book value at that time. Assuming it just trades at book in
2016 and that book value keeps growing 8%, MET would be roughly a double in
2016 and the PE would still be only ~7.7x.

None of the above assumption is overly optimistic and 8% book value growth is
easy to beat, if they can buy back stock below book. Big picture talk while the
price of shares goes up and down (mostly down) with the news flow from Europe,
notwithstanding the fact that MET does not even have much exposure to PIG debt.
