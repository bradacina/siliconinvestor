Georgi, FTR pulled a fast one when they cut their dividend dramatically after
issuing a press release stating that the dividend was safe. The stock now
trades at a discount to its peers and still offers a higher dividend than its
peers. FTR carries a lot of debt with a large chunk due and payable next year.
They don't have much cash, so the div. cut is understandable.

The payout ratio is now just over 40%. I don't know why Yahoo has 500% or what
Google has. So, overall FTR is a value play relative to its peer group and now
has a generous and substainable dividend. I don't own it and won't be buying
because the same management is in place that lied about the safety of the
dividend.

I had followed Ditchdigger into FTR and he was more nimble than I in getting
out.

Georgi, I'm exhausted after all of those posts!

Prior to the div. cut, the payout was in the 60% range. I am going to try to
post this only once.

Yes, good article. On one hand L is cheap. On the other hand, the article
explains the issues with L holdings quite well. All of them currently have
warts - DO, HighMount, CNA (I don't have an opinion about Boardwalk).

Risk with DO is a major disaster on one of the old rigs. That's always risky.

They can't do much about nag gas prices for HighMount.

They may have most control over CNA, so they could turn it around. However,
"the most control" is also a problem. They have owned CNA for ages and the
company has not done very well, which means that the control is not that good.

It seems they made hugely good gains on Lorillard, but that's gone now and the
future is quite uncertain...

Disclosure: I have small position in DO. I had a small position in L that I
sold last year. I am not sure I want to rebuy...

Bad day means a few buys. Mine today - A few more CLF at 58.25$ and HES at
50.3$ which have been discussed previously.

Starter positions in XRX at 7.53$ and Dell at 15.85$ (both very small). XRX is
an Einhorn pick (which traditionally have not worked for me but I try again).

BH.PA 46.25 Euro - French Cheese and Dairy product manufacturer. 3.1Euro/share
in earnings or a PE ~15x this year which was not a good result for them, in
20100, they made about 6Euro/share. Cheap, based on P/B, P/S and EV/EBITDA, but
low profitability compared to most consumer product peers.

What attracts me to them is that I am a big cheeselover and many names are
household names in Europe like Balade ( a great butter substitute like
Smartbalance, try it at Trader Joes!), Caprice des Dieux, Milkana, Bressot< Le
Tartare, Henri etc .etc. They are #1 in Germany and #2 in Europe (after
FBEL.PA). These two companies appear to buy more and more brands and continue
to increase market share, which I guess at some point should increase their
profit margins. I am not sure, if I hang around that long but I think chances
are good, that they make 6 Euro/share again and I can unload my shares for a PE
10 or better for a nice profit.

I rarely have lost money with food stocks, if I got a reasonable entry and I am
hoping this will be no different. I am bid for some shares in my IRA account
too on Monday.

I also continued to ad to HES on Friday.

Today's Barron's has people who express positive opinions on some stocks that
have been mentioned here, e.g. HES and your XRX. Favorable mentions too of SVU,
INTC, MET, GM and others

Regarding HES:
http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111903623804577384422283315762.h
ml?mod=BOL_qtoverview_barlatest

"On April 30, Chairman and Chief Executive John B. Hess bought 48,000 shares of
http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=HES (ticker:
HES) for $2,496,082, an average of $52 each.

John Hess now directly holds 333,435 shares, a stake of less than a 1%.
However, John Hess indirectly holds at least a 10% Hess stake through phantom
shares and trusts." ...

"'This was definitely a notable trade,' says Lon Juricic, president of
StreetInsider.com, noting John Hess' purchase of shares earlier in the year.

'He was a seller for a long time and recently started buying; he's a smart
buyer. With any energy stock, you've got to watch oil prices and they've been
coming in lately with a pretty big move," says Juricic. "That's a major
consideration when playing this.'

On May 9, 2011, Hess shares reached an intraday 52-week high of $80.29,
adjusted for dividends and splits. Shares slipped to a low of $46.66 on Oct. 4
and have recovered slightly since then, closing down 2.79 percent at $50.94 on
Friday.

More recently, on April 25, Hess reported an inline first-quarter and forecast
a weaker production outlook related to the Bakken shale in North Dakota. Hess
had previously set a production goal of 60,000 barrels of oil per day at that
location. In response, Credit Suisse analyst Edward Westlake downgraded Hess to
Neutral from Outperform and cut the price target to $70 from $95."

Regarding SVU:

http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111903935304577376040360999520.h
ml?mod=BOL_hps_dc

"Only two of 18 analysts recommend the stock, and more than 40% of its shares
have been sold short. The stock was just ejected from the S&P 500. Its dividend
yield of 6.3% implies some market fear that it might be cut, which is possible
though not yet necessary.

Still, valued below five times current-year earnings, most of the challenges
seem accounted for.

The company comfortably covers its debt service with cash flow for now. If a
new value-pricing strategy—and a new head of retail operations hired last
week—helps results, it would feed a relief rally.

Plan B would be a break-up to separate from the main supermarket unit the
stable wholesale-distribution business and the strong Sav-A-Lot chain of
independently owned deep-discount grocers, which by some estimates is alone
worth Supervalu's share price. Analyst Ken Goldman, of JPMorgan, applies
conservative discounts to comparable companies to arrive at a sum-of-the-parts
value for the stock near $11."

Re: Intel Corporation (INTC)
 Microsoft Corporation (NasdaqGS: MSFT)
Sony Corporation Common Stock (NYSE: SNE)

http://goo.gl/lEVaQ

INTC is one I am looking at for selling a few shares at any point above
$30.00/share. That would represent an all time high for the stock. TBV is
around $6.00/share and BV is $9.17. Using 2013 EPS of $2.68/share and BV
(really you should use TBV), the GN value is $23.00/share. Therefore INTC
appears overvalued by 30%.

The positive for INTC is they finally are ramping up production for their low
powered chips that will be used in smart phones and tablet devises. Initial
margins are quite high but the product cycles are a bit less than traditional
PC chips.

Not sure what INTC has in mind with this?
<u>Intel may launch its own set-top box & streaming service</u>
http://venturebeat.com/2012/03/13/intel-streaming-tv-service/

Seems like they are searching for a new business to enter where there is
already a lot of competition. To me, this could be a money pit w/ little to no
margins. Not sure if is the best use of their FFC.

I still hold 40% of my shares bought below $20.00/share and thought that I
might peel off another 50% and deploy the proceeds into other technology value
candidates. SNE is one that I starting a tracking position in. SNE is trading
at an all time low. I had the same thought about NOK last year but was wrong as
NOK hit another all time low last week.

Sony Corporation Common Stock (NYSE:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q;_ylt=Ak55eRbbq4tyJX79q2CIRxoHv7gF;_ylu=X3oDMTEybmp1Z
ZoBHBvcwMzMQRzZWMDeWZpU3VtbWFyeVRhYmxlBHNsawNzbmU-?s=SNE )

is selling below it's TBV of $18.29 (BV= $28.85). The company has several
profitable divisions; Music, Movie and Insurance. They own a lot of valuable
intangible assets patents, trademarks (mainly in their music division) and have
recently completed major company downsize/restructuring. As a result a one time
loss was booked that resulted in breaking a streak of positive earnings.

<img src='/public/342737_5b0ac9e73e213e11c42cdaffeed32f09.jpg'>

Any thoughts about INTC and/or technology "value" candidate stocks. MSFT is one
I had previously owned but sold out too early as it proceeds to reach new
recovery highs. The GN for MSFT is similar to INTC at $23.63. MSFT falls into
the overvalued range (for me) and could be as much as 30% overvalued at current
levels. This metric has been wrong for determining my sells, so I am probably
wrong this time too.

EKS, my opinions on some tech stocks, fwiw.

INTC at p/e of 10x for tech "chip" stock might be a sell for me for a few
shares also. P/e 10 and its high roe (on stated bv) otoh, seems like a
hold/buy. Back otoh, that high roe I'm looking at has been in past three years.
Before that it was much lower for a few years. (So I'm not so sure of
sustainability of its roe.) Result, I may follow you and sell a few shares if
stock hits your $30 price.

I haven't looked at SNE. MSFT is a hold for me.

I'm holding ORCL. Waiting for trial outcome to see if I might add more shares.

Might add to AAPL if it drops back a couple dozen more points.

My latest tech stock buy was a recent small purchase of AVX. Dull company ---
punk roe, not particularly cheap on p/e, not much growth in bv (stated bv),.
Otoh, sells slightly below stated bv now. I suspect not much chance of large
stock rise; otoh, maybe not a great chance of large stock loss either. Perhaps
it's okay for me; I wouldn't recommend it for anyone else though.

Whose asset allocation model is that, I2?

For me, I'm in no individual bonds, I'm in about 3-4% bond funds and I have
about 6-7% in net cash (which is the largest amount of cash I've held in maybe
20 or more years). I'm 89-91% in individual stocks including a small exposure
to stock (equity) funds.

Where might you be vs. that model, given that you are a senior also?

Asset allocation seems to me to be such an individual thing depending on one's
goals, one's risk tolerance and the changing relationship between bonds (bond
yields) and stocks, that a general model not only doesn't work, but it doesn't
really give a general indication of where one "should" be in life.

Interest rates climbed from lows in the 1950's to highs in the 1980's, and have
again reached lows comparable to the 1950's. Hard to get excited about long bod
investments today if one believes in the power of long cycles.

I'm turning 60 this year, and my investment allocation is close to Paul's.
Instead of bond funds, I've got about 10% invested in preferred stocks bought
in late 2008-early 2009. Hopefully I'll be nimble enough to exit sometime in
the next five years or so when rates start to rise IMO.

Sony Corporation (SNE) -NYSE 
Last $15.30/share (TBV = $18.29 EV/EBITDA= $7.02)

It may be early but as I research more about the company and their massive
turnaround project, the value proposition is definitely there. I suspect the
bottom will be in later than sooner so (for me) no rush to buy.

Here is a very good article outlining a few of the main areas that will reduce
costs and increase growth.

Can Kazuo Hirai save Sony?
April 13, 2012
http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/can-kazuo-hirai-save-sony/

Highlights from the article:

1) Sony is looking to spin its expensive small- and mid-sized LCD production
off into joint ventures, letting partners shoulder some of the costs for
producing the flat screens that are part-and-parcel of almost every electronic
device today. LCDs are now a commodity item, and Sony needs to reduce the
amount of money it puts into manufacturing them. A good portion of the savings
will come from backing out of its joint venture with Samsung to make LCD flat
panels

2) Sony will be selling off it's Chemical divisions and looking to form some
type of JV (and/or industry alliance) for electric vehicle batteries and other
forms of energy storage. Sony is one of the biggest battery-makers on the
planet.

3) Sony is looking to increase sales in China, Mexico and India. In fact Sony
India will be their biggest growth market in 2015. Sony India will focus on
developing new devises that use new OLED displays that deliver the convergence
from their networks, mobile and digital content into one end user package.

India to be in the league of top five markets for Sony by 2015
http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-04-30/news/31508469_1_masaru-
amagawa-kazuo-hirai-sony-ceo

From the article"..."India is becoming one of the most important market for
Sony globally, is highly profitable and has potential to figure amongst the
largest markets in three years," says Tamagawa who has helped the brand triple
its Indian revenues since he took charge as the managing director five years
back...."

4) Sony looks to expand their professional imaging technologies, specifically
developing their Medical peripherals business. Sony bought
http://www.micronics.net/about last September and just closed a deal for
http://www.i-cyt.com/ , makers of diagnostic equipement and cellular analysis
systems, respectively. This is a huge growth market that is very profitable.

5) Sony's Financial Service Group is their most profitable division.

Sony’s Most Profitable Business Is Not Related To Gadgets
http://pulse2.com/2012/04/30/sonys-most-profitable-business-is-not-related-to-t
chnology/
From the article"...Sony Financial is a holding company for Sony’s financial
services. It owns and oversees businesses like Sony Life Insurance, Sony Bank,
Sony Assurance, and Sony Bank Securities. The market cap of Sony Financial
Holdings Inc (TYO:8729) is $568.98 billion and they are headquartered in Tokyo,
Japan...."

This link shows just how profitable this division is:
http://www.sonyfh.co.jp/web/en/financial_info_e/highlight.html

What if Sony decides to expand their Financial Services into India and China,
two markets where their brand is rated very high for "quality". This is the
hidden gem for me. I do not think the company has planned this far down the
road for their financial services division. If Sony India delivers the 5%
growth, bringing their Finance Services into the fold could be very profitable
for the company.

----------------------------------------------------

Therefore, it's a developing transformation that is worth watching. It's the
two growth markets in China and India that attract my attention. I also believe
finding their way into the medical imaging market could prove a good move. For
example. dentists across the world are installing new imaging equipment, their
single largest capital investment for new equipment. Maybe there will be
further acquisitions by SNE to enter this part of the medical imaging market.

With the company now selling 20% below Tangible Book Value it's worth looking
at SNE (for me) as a value candidate stock. It's still a work in progress. (

Asset Allocation - the formulaic age dependent ratio approach ignores specific
situations. For example, if you don't need to draw down balances, more equities
may be in order even for someone over 80. If you need to pay huge tuitions
soon, more bonds might be better for a few years even if you're just 50. If I
knew I had just X more years to live, I'd have more bonds as I closed in on
that date, but my crystal ball is lacking such insight. With 3 grandparents
reaching 94+, I doubt I'll be anywhere near 20%bonds at age 80.

Another formula you might noodle over is: 1 or 2 years' expenses cash, the rest
equities.

i like your answer. much better than a one size fits all.

as i approach a hopefully impending retirement, i am loosely targeting
something like the following.

3 years of expenses in MM outside the investment accounts (to carry me through
until i can make withdrawals from IRA).

one more year invested in BSV 'indefinitely' within investment accounts (IRAs).

aside from that, maybe 10-15% bond funds, maybe 10-15% target cash and the rest
targeted for equities. at the moment, actual cash above target. all this gives
me the opportunity to make gradual adjustments as necessary as well as have
some flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.

the above works for me, but each of us, as you say, will have our own specific
set of circumstances we need to manage to.

While it's true that the typical formulas for asset allocation ignore specific
situations, the formulas are generally based on valid statistical relationships
of risk and reward over different periods of investment. The assumption is that
the investment period is related to the age of the individual.

I'm currently between 65% and 70% stocks. That allocation (which I'm
considering changing) is not so much based on my need (or lack thereof) to draw
money from the accounts in the near future, as it is my evaluation of the
risk/reward of staying in equities.

Thanks for your thoughts!

Hi Sergio -

So where do we find the "value" private equity investments?

<blockquote>The Committee approved a modest increase in the private equity
target from 33 percent to 34 percent. </blockquote>
<blockquote>"...Yale’s private equity assets concentrate on partnerships with
firms that emphasize a value-added approach to investing. Such firms work
closely with portfolio companies to create fundamentally more valuable
entities, relying only secondarily on financial engineering to generate
returns. Investments are made with an eye toward long-term
relationships—generally, a commitment is expected to be the first of
several—andtoward the close alignment of the interests of general and limited
partners. Yale avoids funds sponsored by financial institutions because of
because of the conflicts of interest and staff instability inherent in such
situations...".</blockquote><blockquote> Private equity earned 10.2 percent
annually over the last ten years, under performing the passive benchmark of
University inflation plus 10 percent by 3.1 percent per year and outperforming
the return of a pool of private equity managers compiled by Cambridge
Associates by 1.0 percent per year. <u>Since inception in 1973, the private
equity program has earned an astounding 30.3 percent per
annum.</u></blockquote>
That is a pretty good return in their private equity bucket. How do we do that?

Hi EKS. There are private equity funds available, usually with an intitial
investment of at leat $250k. You could probably sell the 250 stocks that you
own to raise enough capital to establish a position.

Other options are getting a job at Yale or you might take a look at BDCs.

Have you looked at any BDCs and if so, what have you found of interest?

Take a look here for more on Yale and why I associate it with asset allocation.

Are BDC's equivalent to Private Equity and are the overall returns the same. If
so, I guess I should at least start a small position in one or more of these as
I have a compiled a pretty good list of BDC companies.

I never really understood them but maybe it is worth another look using Yale's
screen. Do you know if there are any funds I might be able to piggy back on
that are invested in Yale's Private equity bucket?

Might want to look at MAIN. It specializes in equity, equity related, and debt
investments in small and lower middle market companies. It does not seek to
invest in start-up companies or companies with speculative business plans. It
seeks to invest in traditional or basic businesses. Market cap around $800.M.
Just recently raised dividend. MAIN has traded publicly since 2007, so not a
long dividend history.

I think its Texas location for its main office is a plus, too, giving the
company physical and hopefully relational proximity to the business community
of the Southwest and Southeast.

It took a leap of faith to buy MAIN above NAV but I took it mainly because I'm
a great believer in insider buying as an indicator. From the 8K: <li></li>

Each BDC is different and should be evaluated on its own. There were some
earlier posts on how to evaluate a BDC on this thread.

A friend of mine uses mostly Vanguard funds for setting up asset allocation
similar to Yale's. There are certainly other methods. Here are two ideas that I
found doing a search.

Clear Rock Capital uses an ETF strategy.

re BDC -
Aren't BDC just crappy junk bonds with leverage in disguise. They have nothing
to do with private equity, although there are a few that take stakes in smaller
companies as well.

Based on my observations, BDC are mostly a Ponzi scheme catering to investors
reaching for yield a bit too far. in most cases, the yield is just a return on
capital, either directly, or the loans are so risky that a default rate erodes
the principal. These are not stocks you want to own if there are any problems
in the credit market.

on another note- has anybody looked at GPN, the payment processor, that had a

Thanks Sergio -

Somewhat OT but if I can duplicate even 50% of Yale's long term performance, it
will surpass some of my best value plays.

I have several Vanguard Funds, in fact moved 1/3 of my S&P 500 and 1/3 of my
International Growth Fund into their Tips fund today. If you know of any of
their specific funds that track Yale's endowment holdings, I might consider
moving the proceeds there. My last trade in these was in March 2009 where I
added to my S&P 500 and International Growth Fund positions. Do not trade these
but simply hold and reinvest dividends. The Funds consist of GNMA, S&P, Tips &
Int Growth.

I really like Vanguard as they have low cost funds, are very efficient and even
their brokerage side has treated me well ($7.00 trade w/ good execution). I use
them both for personal and IRA money and these account have grown over the
years.

Therefore, any links and/or ideas on how to duplicate Yale's endowment
portfolio, this would be the best place (for me) to set it up.

Maybe start at Winkipedia which has more correct information than your post.

BDCs are not for everyone but no one should read your post in determining if a
BDC is right for them.

<Aren't BDC just crappy junk bonds with leverage in disguise. > No. Don't know
of any BDCs that offer crappy bonds with leverage in disguise. Please show me
one.

<They have nothing to do with private equity, although there are a few that

private equity in one way or another.

<Based on my observations, BDC are mostly a Ponzi scheme catering to investors
reaching for yield a bit too far.> Please show one example of where a BDC is
similar to a Ponzi scheme.

<in most cases, the yield is just a return on capital, either directly, or the
loans are so risky that a default rate erodes the principal. > Not true. BDCs
are governed by law on what they pay out to investors.

<These are not stocks you want to own if there are any problems in the credit

market?

BDCs. "These are not stocks you want to own if there are any problems in the
credit market." There are a lot of stock that you do not want to own under such
circumstances. It would prob be easier to list the stock that you would want to
own in that case, and it might be zero. But I would not put all BDCs in the
same boat. I bought ARCC after the 08 crunch, and one significant factor
tipping the scale was their performance during the credit market crunch.

Reiterating, I like PNNT among the several BDC's I own (which includes ARCC).

Stock cratered mightily in '08:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=PNNT+Basic+Chart&t=5y

Dividend (distribution) was never cut though. Only increased:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=PNNT&a=03&b=19&c=2007&d=04&e=8&f=2012&g=v

Hard to get everything with a stock, and with PNNT already yielding over 11%
annualized ($1.12/$10), I don't expect much capital gains, or growth in book
value. Growth in stated bv has been minimal or non-existent (hovering slightly
above $10 past few years). Because stated bv seems to be holding steady -- and
at least not decreasing year over year, it gives me some indication that the
relatively large distribution I have got and am getting is not significantly
made by giving me a return of my capital.

If there were to be another credit crunch, it's possible that PNNT and its
access to, and history with, SBA monies, and the government perhaps wanting to
make getting loans easier for small companies, PNNT might still have more
ability to get even more SBA monies to loan out to these cash-strapped
companies. Which might put PNNT in a good situation compared to banks or other
financial entities.

Stock could of course fall further from its current price, as it has in past. I
notice one insider has confidence to step up for some shares though recently:

One of the most interesting features for me was/is is the requirement for the
company to distribute 90% of it's net investment income to shareholders, which
allows for the high yields which, along with MReits, provide some juice in my
otherwise ABT-like portfolio. Down side is that most of the dividend income is
treated as ordinary income for federal tax purposes, so they are better in an
IRA if possible. Who knows in the future what that will mean??

Most BDCs make money by lending to companies in the small to mid cap range and
sometimes take an equity interest in the firms they invest in and can even get
involved in the management in some cases. My personal opinion is that they are
helpful to capitalistic and entrepreneurial business development, and they
charge really high interest rates, thus the healthy dividends.

Banks have been and remain tight in lending to anyone or anything that doesn't
have a perfect rating, so BDCs currently have good opportunities to make loans
on advantageous terms, but in a downturn these can go bad FAST.

My impression is that most BDCs have much less leverage than most financial
stocks, but will be and are usually painted with the same brush.

<u>Be aware that CODI is also structured as a Master Limited Partnership.
</u>
I read through these decent presentation on BDC's which explain them fairly
well.

MAIN is wildly overvalued IMO, although they recently raising the dividend. I

PNNT. there no employees as far as i can tell. they pay a fee for
administration and a fee to the investment advisers. for 2011 it looks like
PNNT advisers got $27 million, plus $2.6 million of admin services paid. that's
32% of $90 million of income! it seems very rich to me. and they have this
strange dividend opt out plan. this doesn't smell right. i'll pass.

" We maintain an “opt out” dividend reinvestment plan for our common
stockholders. As a result, if we declare a dividend or other distribution, then
stockholders’ cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional
shares of our common stock, unless they specifically “opt out” of the dividend
reinvestment plan so as to receive cash distributions."

So I looked at ARCC. they have the same greedy structure. In 2011, they paid
$112 million of incentive fees plus $17 million of management fees. that's 20%
of $634 million of revenue. who do they think they are? I need to rethink this.

Afaik and in my experience, it seems that all these bdc's are structured so
that the managers/insiders who do all these deals get a VERY substantial piece
of the action. As in bonus when loan is made, large profit percentage if bdc
sells warrants or stock in a company that's been on the bdc books, etc.
Sometimes (or more?) there's no financial risk to the managers themselves if
the deals don't work out.

Certainly a troubling aspect of this business. I can tolerate it if the
dividend/distribution is high enough, seems safe enough, and if the managements
aren't giving me my own money back again (i.e. if return of capital is a big
component of the distribution.)

RE: The <u>EKS Tactical Asset Allocation</u> 

The value investor in me says I should build up the Real Estate component.
Therefore, according to David Swensen Tactical Allocation Model, I should sell
50% more of my SPX 500 Fund and move the proceeds into VNQ (Vanguard REIT ETF)

After today's Sales & Buys my IRA Vanguard Fund allocations look as follows:
58% Vanguard 500 Index Fund VFIAX (VTI has performed 2% better than VFIAX),
32.5% Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund (VIPSX),
3% Vanguard GNMA Fund (VFIIX),
6.5% Vanguard International Growth Fund and International Growth

In the same account I hold SeaCube Container Leasing Ltd. (BOX) which I bought
as an undervalued EK$ stock at $11.00/share earlier this year. BOX is still
undervalued w/ an EK$ value of $21 but it might be a good time to just sell
these shares and put the proceeds into the Vanguard REIT VNQ Fund. The Real
Estate component of this allocation should still be undervalued when compared
to the other asset classes. The other Bond classes (other than Tips) are
probably over valued so no big hurry to put new monies there.

<img src='/public/342737_216200f3009f0dd22cc7bbb92b2d184a.png'>

Of the three positions (VNQ, VFIAX & BOX), VNQ is the lagger selling at a 20%
discount to the other two Funds/equity.

I will call this my <u>EKS Tactical Asset Allocation</u>. I am able to tweak
the account with individual equity buys. So I will put Hercules Technology
Growth Capital, Inc. (HTGC) on my equity watch list. FWIW, 25% of this account
are equities that include: BOX, AMNF and PBA (the merged Provident Energy
Pipeline Company)
http://goo.gl/vR48l

HTGC might be a good replacement for BOX as they have similar distributions but
I am skeptical of the ongoing management fee HTGC may charge. I will have to
review their most recent prospetus before I make any move.

BDC management fees.

From Barrons Investment Ideas column:

<Given the active management of BDC assets, companies in the sector typically
pay a base management fee to external asset managers of around 2% of assets,
and an incentive fee of 20% of the upside over pre-defined hurdle rates. This
is very different than a passively managed ETF which typically has a management
fee ofbetween 0.15% and 0.5%… Investors will need to account for the above
factors when assessing the attractiveness of BDC equities.>

The wikipedia article says very little about the risk inherent for BDC.

1) name me one BDC that does not use debt to enhance returns.

As you mentioned before, BDC leverage is limited to 50% of the assets. if
management is going close to the limit, breaching the limit means that
a) Assets have to be sold (almost impossible because assets tend to illiquid)
b) Capital has to be raised, often to very bad terms.

Even if the loan limit is not breached, there is a risk that financing falls
apart, which can result in a death spiral.

The Ponzi scheme comes from various aspects.
a) Management get's paid a fee, typically 2% of the assets. That incentives
them to ramp up assets and leverage.
b) High distributions are likely to attract investors reaching for yield, which
push up the share price. This enables selling more shares, which increases
management fees. This is the positive feedback loop that management tries to
accomplish. The problem of course is that high yields can only be generated
using the highest loan yields which almost certainly are the least creditworthy
companies. it also encourages to use as much leverage as possible.
c) management has a lot of leeway to value their assets. Because they are not
liquid they are almost by definition Level 3 assets. Although, if a loan goes
bad, there is a great incentive to roll it over with the company to avoid
writeoffs. There is no FDIC looking over the shoulder like for banks that
audits the results and sometimes catches shenanigans.

presumed for the reasons that have been cited (the structure, leverage,

Hi Grommit -

Good to know that you find CLF of value. I own CNX that has similar coal assets
but also owns NG assets that are being jointly developed by Noble. I like that
CLF pays a higher dividend (4.5%) and is diversified in Canada and Australia.

I was going to add to my CNX at 10% lower price but I think now I will buy a
starter position in CLF. CLF sells 45% below it's GN value of $80.66. I have a

The risk is that Beazer will push its own inventory that it can't sell to the
REIT. If it does not sell, does it mean that it will rent well? I wonder. :)

On the other hand, the fact that they will push the inventory from single
subdivisions/communities to the REIT may make it easier to do the
maintenance/upkeep. As Buffett said, the big issue with big single-family house
investment is the lack of scalability. If houses are located in more
concentrated clusters, at least part of the issue goes away.

Finally, renting out houses in partially sold subdivisions/communities might
increase community attractiveness to buyers: there will be less of a ghost town

The stock is still significantly undervalued when compared to it's GN (as much

Re: HES

It's the TBV value that may be off. I am using the Street Smart Edge that shows
the TBV at $56.09/share. This site confirms that number:
http://www.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&btn=s_ok&mode=&symbol=NYSE%3AHES

You are right about their EPS. For a first pass I use the 2012 average analysts
EPS (this is not Grahm's approach), I also calculate using the most recent
"actual annual EPS "as reported. For HES it is $5.88/share.

Finally, earnings are supposed to be positive over the last 10 year but five is
acceptable. I do see that there was a period where EPS were negative (perhaps
due to a one time charge) so I am wrong to call my value a GN value.

<img src='/public/342737_d89406497cded327355028200e92c032.png'>

You must realize that HES has used much of their FCF to finance their CAPEX
especially over the last few years. These large investments have built up their
TBV. So maybe a better measure of "Value" is to just look at how the company
has grown their TBV and how aggressive they have been in making large annual
capital investments over the last five years.

<img src='/public/342737_555ce04cefbe9bf862199a5d923c0073.jpg'>

I guess one of the negative arguments is that recently the company has made
some lousy capital investments that have not contributed to EPS.

This is why (as you point out) it is important to look under the hood at the
specifics. No one measure of value is correct. I just hope HES can report a
sustained positive EPS for years to come reflecting their agressive capital
investments over the past few years. Oil priced above $100/barrel would help
too.

Thank's for the reality check.

re GPN - a GARP stock (maybe). They have shown 10-15% revenue growth using mix
of organic growth and acquisitions. Most of the earnings flow through as FCF
(unless you count acquisition expense of course).

Past history with security breaches suggest that severe consequences are rate
(Heartland had a huge issue in 2008, but survived unscathed even though the
stock chart suggest otherwise). This seems to indicate that these payment
processors have a moat.

I think maybe a first buy at around 40$, looking for a return to 50$ (highly
likely if above assumptions are true). The downside tail risk is that GPN is
blacklisted and business starts to implode. I am guessing they would be
acquired in this case to restore credibility. Max. Downside risk to maybe
20$/share. It depends on the probability that you assign to each outcome and
there are lot's of shades in between. Right now, I think it's a so so bet.

OT.

So far there has been inflation in certain sectors (oil, agriculture) and
deflation in others (housing, obviously, but also natgas). I see no reason why
similar bifurcation won't continue although sectors could change. natgas and
housing are unlikely to deflate much more, since both are selling under
replacement rate in some cases. Oil might deflate if natgas can replace some of
it. Agri could deflate a bit too. Wage inflation is unlikely in most fields for
now although it is visible in high tech (again). Wage inflation may come back
if wages inflate fast in cheap countries and production/services are
back-sourced to US. Medical costs are likely to continue inflating, since there
is no good solution suggested to fix it.

It is not clear that the government (and private?) models are well equipped to
deal with all of this.

There is also global environment to consider. Although people are well aware of
US$ printing which may lead to debasing (Clownbuck, anyone? ;)), it's not clear
whether these people account for other currencies printing quite a lot too. If
everyone prints, do the commodities inflate while everything else
deflates/stays constant? It is unclear IMHO. :)

There's also population growth, which is still inflationary in USA (growth
above replacement limit), but is becoming deflationary in Japan and soon
Europe. If population shrinks, fewer services and products are needed, which is
deflationary.

This whole deleveraging that has to take place does not let the money go into
