re Pargesa , i plan on holding until i see the following:

- NAV discount shrinks far below historical average (10% ?)
- Pargesa's holdings are become overvalued
- Management issues.
- Arbitage opportunity with GBL.BR, NAT.BR, Power Corp.

I think Pargesa should become a LT holding - i certainly plan it this way, but
if the market sends me a gift and shrinks the discount or sends me a gift i am
going to take it.

I agree with you, I believe the price to be exhorbitant. Especially given the
fact that value plays dont tend to disappear overnight. Im surprised no one
here is commenting about the wm deal and dillution for existing investors. I
dont own it but to me its yet another reason to stay away from financials and
the dropping of more heavy shoes that can squish ones portfolio.
Its remarkable to me that regulators have premitted entities which time and
time again have demonstrated their inability to correctly monitor and assess
risk to be so leveraged. As an investor/speculator it seems foolhardy to invest
in such mismanaged entities and I wonder about the quality of analysts and

BID does not seem to get any bids today <g>.

I agree that seasonality is the main reason for their balance sheet expansion
during the last quarter.
Going down the history lane it appears that current liabilities at year end are
always around 1.1-1.2x annual revenues. That's a high number and implicates
that BID does have risk that they don't get paid when the art market turns bad.

I also read that shortsellers use BID stock to make bet's against the art
market, for lack of another vehicle. So these may be business bet's rather than
company specific bet's.

Hi Spekulatius- Added shares to my BP position. Last buy was 8/29/07 at around
the same price. BP is selling at a forward PE of 8.8, pays a 5.5% dividend and
is one of the most under valued in the group according to McDep Oil & Gas
Investment Research (http://www.mcdep.com/mr80318.pdf ).

The problem is that BP's management is not very good and has been held back
with maintenance problems in their Alaskan pipeline which should now be behind
them. My main motivation for adding shares was this announcement today; **
headline:" BP, ConocoPhillips Plan Gas Pipeline
..."(http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080408/alaska_gas_pipeline.html?.v=3 ). They are
finally going to start construction.

Conoco's management should provide the expertise in seeing the project through.
Both companies have a huge vested interested in getting the pipeline project
completed on time and on budget.

I now own equivalent amounts of BP and COP in the portfolio. Each company has
made it into my top 10 holdings. With todays buy, BP represent a 2.5% position
of the total.

I have not paid too much attention to BP as it has significantly lagged my
other oil holdings and has underperformed the S&P 500 by 10% over the last two
years.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=BP&t=2y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=cop,xom,cvx,%5EGSPC

Perhaps its time to begin to accumulate more shares of BP at these levels or
think about peeling off shares of CVX or XOM and buying more BP.

For now I am satisfied with what I have and will wait and see if there is a
steady improvement in management. This Conoco pipeline project will be a good
test to see how well BP's group performs.

I guess Im losing more brain cells. I dont understand the logic of the article
which seems to imply that since the lows arent so low and were assuming that
those were the lows the conclusion is that we are still in a bull market I
guess until the previous low is broken, then Mr Russell will declare it to be a
bear market again. It reminds a little bit of a story about a guy who carried a
seashell around with him and made trades based upon what the seashell told him.
The guy was doing pretty well and it eventually turned out that he would buy
based upon shares making new highs and sell when they failed to sustain those
new highs. No one was really sure whether he actually heard anything out of the
seashell.

Meanwhile the retail news seems to continue to stink. I guess the retailers are
blaming it on unusually cool weather. and the first marblehead news isnt
exactly cheerful not to mention wamu successfully raising more money at a 30%+

CSCO, well Jurgis, those would be the GAAP earnings numbers. they reduce
earnings by 15-20%. Annual stock option dilution is about 2% and has been
shrinking slowly. you need to relate that to the growth, which has been 12%+
during the last few years.

So, the way i look at it they are paying out around 15% of their earnings power
(or 155 of their growth) to their employees, on top of their salaries. it's a
high number but not absurdly high if they can keep up their growth.

GE with their top-notch credit rating can borrow big money cheaper than most,

to sell off their financing arm that has been so profitable in past. A bad year
now and a bad appetite by investors now for "financing" "credit" "loans"
doesn't mean such are not important aspects for most USA businesses.

Perhaps it is "too hard to value". That hasn't stopped people from buying
Berkshire or others where there's certainly some faith-based investing - with
BRK confidence in Warren or some assurance past results can be or will be
carried through into future. (Unless these people actually find that BRK with
all its businesses and long-tail insurance risks is not too hard to analyze.) I
see nothing detrimental in same faith-base approach to GE. (reliance on Immelt
and GE's historically good management and business performance.) This in spite
of Immelt's credibility slip with investors today. And same somewhat faith-base
aspect for me for several other companies, e.g. MKL, Y. Of course, that's how I

According to Morningstar's Fair Value Estimate, GSK's intrinsic value is $57.
At current prices, this represent a 33% discount to the long term intrinsic

Hi Paul - In your post of 8/10/2007
(http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=23783627) you alerted me of
Schwab's equity rating of Grade "D" on GE which is based on several valuation
criteria. It's interesting that GE is down more than 16% from your post.

GE generally hits their earnings forecasts +/- 1% from their actual. I believe
their most current report was off by more than 10%, one of the biggest misses
in recent history.

From a Bloomberg article today:
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a_IMUb7mT4T4&refer=home
On a conference call today, analysts demanded that Immelt explain why he told
retail investors on a March 13 Webcast that Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE
would likely meet its annual forecast of at least $2.42 a share.

``Two days after the Webcast, the Bear Stearns situation took place,' Immelt
said. ``The last two weeks in March were a different world in financial
services.'

The market turmoil also prevented GE from selling some finance assets, Immelt
said. GE put its U.S. credit card business and Japanese consumer finance units
up for sale last year. The health-care unit also trailed expectations....

"We had planned for a difficult environment," he said. "We had planned for an
environment that was going to be challenging, but what I would say is kind of
late in the quarter, particularly after the Bear Stearns event, we experienced
an extraordinary disruption in our ability to complete asset sales and incurred
marks of impairments and this was something that we clearly didn't see until
the end of the quarter."

=======================================================

My take away is even with one of the best management teams, GE was caught in
the Bear Sterns downdraft. I just wonder if many of those "financial" assets
Immelt said incurred "marks of impairments" were a few of those balance sheet
valuations that Schwab late last year had categorized as Grade "D".

No comment on TZIX fundamentally, but 7-8% potential arb return for 4-6 months

You want value, but with some protection, take a look at taking positions and
writing covered calls on:

- Gold miners such as Yamana, closed at 14.25 and can get 1.50 for the July 15s

- Dry bulk shippers such as Dryships, closed at 65.41 and can get 8.70 for the
June 65s

EKS, I just reviewed that post and note that the reason for the "D" rating by
Schwab was a negative rating on the fundamentals: "Free cash flow generation
and growth; efficient mgmt of capital; and ability to fund capital."

I don't know if ANYbody anticipated the almost total shutdown in the capital
markets that has been going on this year. But I guess the Schwab research group
correctly identified a potential problem area for GE.

Some felt that given GE's credit rating, it should be able to have ready access
to credit markets. But when banks are scrambling to re-capitalize, even highly
rated customers simply cannot get credit.

FWIW, as of April 4, Schwab had a "C" rating on GE. I'm going to keep an eye on
when they update that rating. Maybe on valuation basis, GE gain a little, tho
on momentum, it'll be downgraded.

Don't you think that the FED and central banks globally are working overtime to
do everything they can to get credit markets flowing again?

I'm musing that if GE, within the next couple of years can get back to where it
closed yesterday (36.75), then with the divie of 3.5% each year, it might
generate average yield of 10.9% over the two years. Hmmm... Does it drift lower
from here or put in a V-bottom. We're at the beginning of reporting season for
Q108. There will likely be more than one negative earnings surprise.

GE had an excellent quarter for their international infrastructure businesses.
I agree with you that the credit markets should be in much better shape next
year but there are probably still a few surprises yet to come for some of the
more leveraged companies.

It just surprised me that with GE's great management talent that they missed
their number by so much. I guess the issues with the capital markets are/were
really bad and hopefully are getting better.

I wonder if GE still plans on selling some of those financial assets that were
mentioned in the article. It seems like this would be the wrong time in this
environment to try to structure such a sale.

The stock traded down on over 7.5x its average daily volume.

It's better to be cautious, so I will pass on this one for now and monitor
management's announcements.

GE - I am also surprised by the recent shortfall. Luckily i did sell out GE
recently in my IRA accounts because I considered it close to full value at
around 37$.
A few things:
1) They did make less money in their financial business but they did not have
large writeoffs like many purebred financials either.

2) Weakness was not just in financials. the industrial part and even NBC showed
shortfalls as well (except for energy and oil)

I bought back a partial position today at around 32$. i still think it's one of
the better plays. As I mentioned before, it looks like the pain in spreading to
industrials as well. I imagine that most foreign industrials that have export
business in the US is hurting quite a bit due to the lower US$. The lower US$
has shielded many industrials with international business from the downturn so
far and it looks like this backwind is overshadowed by the macro headwinds.

15-20% gains possibility on anything in this market looks good to me. -g-

To me it is a pretty good return, because it's in the ballpark of what most of
the buyouts go for -- the one's that are getting completed. That would be my
opinion, based on my experience. 15-20% annualized or maybe a little more...
just about right. If there's a much greater return, then imo, the pro's are
saying the deal won't be consummated. I am still holding losses in TMY and COMS
-- which had larger annualized potential gains and which both then failed to
consummate. PENN is one that I have with a large potential gain and therefore
it imo is in now doubt (i.e. has high risk) too:

Living in the Berkshires I can certainly see the havoc GE has caused between
its pollution of the local landscape and all the jobs gone forever with GE
pulling out for greener pastures. One of the things that surprised me before I
moved here was going to a website of a school near a house suggested by a
broker and finding out that their comparative scores were way below the state
average despite not having a diversified mix of students . Then we found out

Im skeptical about "GE's great management team" . Living in the Berkshires I
can certainly see the havoc GE has caused between its pollution of the local
landscape and all the jobs gone forever with GE pulling out for greener
pastures. One of the things that surprised me before I moved here was going to
a website of a school near a house suggested by a broker and finding out that
their comparative scores were way below the state average despite not having a
diversified mix of students . Then we found out that the house backed out onto
the local polluted river and close to a toxic waste site that needs to be
cleaned up. Nardelli didnt exactly do a bang-up job at Home Depot either. I

Madharry, i share you concern that the credit freeze is an excuse. If the last
2 weeks were indeed what's causing the problem it must mean that the quarter
was backend loaded (a lot of deals needed to get done) during the last 2 weeks.
The math is simple: each quarter has 121+ Days so 14 Days / 2 weeks of that is
11.5%, so assuming business ground to a halt there would have been an 11.5%
revenue shortfall, which theoretically could have caused a 20% earnings
reduction. However that would be the extreme assumption that business went to
zero, which i think is quite unlikely.

Also it looks like both commercial finance and GE money had revenue increases
of 7% YoY . The quarter before commercial finance was up 9% (revenue and
earnings) and GE money 22%, so it seems that commercial finance slowed only
little and GE money much more so. Then we also have shortfalls in industrial,
healthcare and NBC which are not directly credit related.

Based on the above numbers , it seems like margin pressure in the financial
sector is much more to blame than revenue and we also have slower growth in
industrial NBC and healthcare.

So it seems that a lot of GE business are under siege now and quite likely
we'll hear more bad news. it would not surprise me to see this stock quoted
with a 2 as a first number down the road. Also a lot of institutions are
holding GE and will now have to decide what to do. they probably got caught at
the wrong foot, like the rest of us so i expect that significant selling
pressure may be present during the next few weeks.

UHR and CFR (SWX Swiss stock market)-
anybody interested in Swiss watch/jewelery manufacturers Swatch group and
Richemont. both trades at the SWX.

Swatch group trades at a trailing PE of 12.5, Richemont's PE is higher ,
however with Richemont you have to consider that almost 1/2 the value is in a
nonconsolidated stake in British American tobacco BTI (there is talk about a
spinoff too).

Both seem nice luxury plays with bulletproof balance sheet and they have not
seen a slowdown yet. Will they sail through a recession? I don't know but if
they do, they are grossly undervalued.

since they are fashion and prestige items, but I do not like the long term

hands, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. ;)

I have not looked of the revenue and income percentages coming from different

Wb - interesting numbers.

Subprime exposure now only 1.7B$, whittled down through writeoffs from 3.8B$.

There is also still about 11B$ in commercial mortgage and leveraged finance
exposure. they have only written down 5% of the total - this does not sound
like enough many leveraged buyouts have been trading at 90c on the $, so
roughly 500M$ more in writeoffs to get them down to market value.

Now the big problem are the 60B$ in home equity and 120B$ in pick a payment
mortgages plus 60B$ in traditional mortgage. i'd guess when it's all said and
done, WB will write off 10% of pick a payment and 3% of home equity loans and
mortgage loans. that would amount to 15.5B$ in additional writeoffs - minus 50%
of existing reserves (50% of 6.5B$ -3.25B$ which also cover credit cards and
other loans) , so i think they show about 12-13B$ in additional losses down the
road.

WB shows that we are basically going from a subprime (and Alt-A ) crisis to a
"prime" loan crisis. Not a lot of fun to be a banker these days. of course i
have no idea of these numbers are correct, they might be off by a 100% and I
have no clue in which direction, but i sort of trust my back on the envelope

Paul - You were right on the Seadrill rigs. It appears that with the new PBR

Seadrill Rises to Record on Brazil Oil-Rig Contracts

http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&sid=aI7Fc1RJd30c&refer=latin_am
rica

From the article:"...Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA, also known as Petrobras,
awarded Seadrill six-year contracts for three semi-submersible rigs to start
operating offshore Brazil between the first quarter of 2009 and the third
quarter of 2010. The orders will increase the company's backlog to more than
$12 billion, up from $7.8 billion at the end of last year, Seadrill Chief
Executive Officer Kjell Jacobsen said today in a statement.

``They signed three fantastic contracts with Petrobras at day rates averaging
$100,000 above our expectations,' said Stian Eliassen, an analyst at Carnegie
ASA in Oslo who has an ``outperform' rating on the shares. The daily rental
rates for the rigs vary between $570,000 and $630,000, he said. ..."

===============================================================

The market for these deep water drilling rigs are being bid up since companies
have to wait until 2011 for delivery of new equipment. I believe that BOTH
SeaDrill and OceanRig have new rigs on order for delivery after 2011.

Based on future demand, both these companies may still be a "value" opportunity
with yesterdays announcement of the huge PBR oil discovery.

OceanRig AG 33% owned by DryShips reported a huge insider buy by Blue Concept

2007. Their 33% holding may turn out to be a hidden "value" gem as insiders
accumulate more stock.

"...Blue Concept AS, a company controlled 100 % by Geir Aune, Chairman of the
Board of Ocean Rig ASA, has on April 10, 2008, rolled-over a forward contract
earlier disclosed by stock exchange notice dated January 11, 2008. Under the
forward contract, as rolled-over, Blue Concept AS will purchase 1,200,000 Ocean

Doesn't appear to be any interest in EXH among the many who follow oil/gas

many other suppliers/servicers to the industry are near highs. And this is no
dink company: it has 11,000 employees and does several billion dollars in
revenue. Company seems pretty aggressive too - making acquisitions, buying back
its stock.

OTOH, forward p/e seems high (to me)at 15x. The company is the result of a

Oil stocks are beginning to be less attractive. The "cheap" ones usually have

"hold" area. I may even take some profits if things run up even more. I don't
have a target oil price though. IMHO, it's very tough to estimate considering
that we are not really in oil decline yet, but on the other hand demand is
probably still increasing more than supply.

Most attractive stocks right now seem to be COP and PTR, though both suffered

file. I may have other stocks that are involved in the Bakken play, but I
haven't so characterized them as Bakken. And these companies below may not be
only or primarily Bakken plays:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PBEGF.PK,TOGSF.PK,CPGCF.PK,WLL,ERF,MDU,CLR,TEC,ABP
KOG&d=s

PBEGF: 2007 position. Latest: small adds in early/mid 4/08. Have not decided if
I will continue to add now.

TOGSF: early 2008 position. Have not decided if I will continue to add now.

CPGCF: Averaging up. My latest buys 4/10 @$29.67 and 4/16 @$33.40. (Closed
today $32.29) Sorry to acknowledge though, only a relatively very few shares
total in this one. My error, or at least I'm disappointed (as of today anyway)
that I didn't start off with a larger buy or add more earlier/quicker.
I like this one because it's a Canadian energy trust, and there's some
protection given the dividend. Crescent Point apparently has been an early
mover (securing leases) in the Bakken. Here are the problems: To a lesser
extent, the yield decreases if/as stock price increases (so maybe its
margin-of-safety decreases thereby also). To a greater extent, the problem with
these trusts is that they pay out so much money to stockholders, that it's
questionable that any can afford to really develop their acreage (horizontal
drilling required and each such well costs several million dollars - much more
than "conventional" drilling). Perhaps only by raising capital and diluting
current shareholders.

I've looked at LINE a couple of times. It's recommended by several on Big Dog's
thread. (I generally use Big Dog's thread as a contrarian indicator, but in
this case, maybe people are right. Or not.) LINE as a Canadian trust maybe
could face same issues as CPGCF. From reading some posters/reports, there's
some uncertainty if LINE has any deep drilling exposure/experience. I've
decided to pass on LINE every time I've considered it.

I have http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=XTO which I've not characterized (owned) as
a Bakken play. They just announced purchase of some (all?) of LINE's Bakken
holdings:

http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/newsanalysis/energy/10412173.html?cm_ven=YAHOO&
m_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA

I added small to my XTO position 4/15 @ $64.57 and 4/16 @ $66.32 and $67.50. I
am considering adding more if stock surpasses these prices.

I'm also adding to my small position in http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MRO which
has a Bakken component:

http://www.marathon.com/Global_Operations/Exploration_and_Production/United_Sta
es/North_Dakota/

MRO might be more risky buy now because of its large refinery business.
(Refinery stocks have really dropped in price this year.) Also it's a
diversified exploration company, so the Bakken is only a part.

I keep adding to ERF. Canadian oil trust.
My intent: build to a full position. My notes show I'm still underwater with my
initial 12/06/06 position. Based on my Bakken interest, I show I've made SMALL
adds this year 1/22, 3/27, 3/31, 4/01, 4/02, 4/03,4/07, 4/08, 4/09, 4/11.

WLL is one of the stocks I sold down in reducing my stock exposure at E-trade
last November. Recently, and perhaps too late, I've been reentering to add to
my small position. I made small buys from 4/7 to 4/15.

I'm considering going for an overweight position in MDU, and I've been buying
shares there. Would like to see the stock come down though, and I will consider
going in aggressively. I started to buy 4/8, and my latest purchase is on 4/16
@$28.10.

This seems to be a very good stock for me (FOR ME) for my desire for a ltb&h
(10-year plus holding). It's a company apparently characterized as a natural
gas utility. It has a construction (cement type) component and an exploratory
section. I like the stock's history over time:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=MDU&t=my

There's a small dividend that gets increased.
It may be a geezer stock. Which is okay by me, because I am one. lol. I have a
lot of bdc's, refinery stocks, others. Sometimes it's nice to have something in
the taxable portfolio that seems to have good, maybe not great prospects, yet
which might be a steady-Eddy. A company which has good prospects yet is
diversified enough and good enough that based on its history, wouldn't have a
large volatile affect on the portfolio if it were a substantial component of
it. (Aside: Are there really such stocks? -g-)

All jmo and what I am doing. And I've been wrong many, many times.

Anybody here with additional info./opinions/corrections to my comments on these
stocks or the Bakken, please feel free to post.

Paul,
XTO purchased all of Line's Marcellus Shale acreage. Line is not a Canada
trust. It's headquarters are in Houston. I sold half of my holdings the day
they announced thier asset sale to XTO. I'm holding the other half.

MH,

We might disagree on this point, but I think that public policy should be as
neutral as possible in regard to investment. The preferential tax treatment of
housing was one of the catalysts of the housing bubble, and it results in a
suboptimal pattern of saving and investment over the course of one's lifetime.

I liked this editorial:
http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2008/04/repeal_housings_mortgageintere
html

What I think you touch on is the emotive aspect of housing: "a policy that
encourages people to stay where they are instead of turning the keys back to
the bank". Why don't we say something similar about people who get sold out of
their stocks because they couldn't meet a margin call? The current policy
reflects our emotional preferences with respect to different asset classes. I
would say that (against the current policy) policy should not exacerbate the
unintended consequences of these preferences.

Thanks for the link. Couldn't agree more.

It inflates housing prices which allows people to buy more toys with the
leverage. Interest on cars, boats, etc. are all written off here.

I think it would only be fair to limit stock losses to balance gains with no
extra 3K deduction for more losses.

While we are at it we could limit gambling losses to offset winnings only.

Three gambling scenarios with one blow!

interesting article

and from the article

And while the direction of the dollar is the biggest driver of nominal home
prices, the theoretical fall-off in demand for housing would lead to lower
prices that would enable what is an unproductive asset to be purchased with a
smaller percentage of total individual wealth. 

But isn't society telling us that our houses are an asset and that we should
take the equity out to buy the things that we need like Ipods, WII's, etc.

Maybe there is more merit in that article than I first thought....
