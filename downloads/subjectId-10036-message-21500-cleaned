Good to read your reply Paul.
Needless to say, we have our own opinion on one or two aspects, but that's to
be expected in this business !
Personally, I never like to see large intangibles. I like numbers that can be
backed by "definable assets". It's sometimes the case that a company's
Financial Management can hide a variety of "sins" in these Intangibles. An
Intangible can also be a number based on the "value" that's given to a
company's Brand. That's not very "definable" as far as I'm concerned.
But more important for me is what is contained in the Capital Employed side of
the Balance Sheet and how much a company earns with that Capital. I use a ratio
which I calculate from the Pretax Income figure on the Income Statement. You
say 9% is a "decent number" for you. Well, it's too low for me, but that's JMO.
With regard to the long term debt, what's more important, as far as I'm
concerned, is what this debt is costing the company as reflected on its Income
Statement. At the moment that cost, as reflected in its last Annual Report, was
over $140 million/year, which was about 10% of its Annual Bottom Line. That has
increased to about 17% of its Bottom Line, according to its last Quarterly
report. This, in my opinion, is why large Long Term Debt is not a good thing to
have in the current financial climate in the USA, as Greenspan continues to
raise interest rates. I'm sure the shareholders would prefer to have that "debt
cost" paid to them in a dividend !
Yes, maybe GCI hasn't seen a P/E below 13 in recent times, but a P/E's value
can be dramatically reduced by a substantial increase in its latest EPS, which
corresponds to a substantial increase in Bottom Line, which corresponds to
greater Turnover etc..etc.. So, in my opinion, it's "bargain time" when a
company shows very much improved results in its latest financial report, such
that it's P/E is now lower because the "denominator" in the equation has
increased before its stock price takes off due to its improved financials.
I agree with you regarding GCI's Operating Margin at the EBIDTA level. It's
showing a good percentage. However, the company isn't showing recent growth at
the Net Income level. In fact, its latest Quarterly showed a fall in both Net
Earnings and Turnover compared to the previous three periods. Maybe this is why
the stock price has been falling off in the last 8 to 9 months.
So my summary, for what it's worth, is this ....
GCI appears to be an efficiently run company as can be seen by its good
Operating Margin (at the EBIDTA level). However, it needs to CONSISTENTLY
increase Turnover and reduce Long Term Debt (especially as interest rates
rise). Both these aspects will lead to increased growth in its Bottom Line and
improved dividends for shareholders. I believe that will make it more
attractive for investors. Good growth in Turnover and Earnings tend to be
reflected in rising stock price. This can be seen in the likes of OXY, HANS or
JLG.
Best wishes for your investments !

OXY, HANS or JLG.

HANS might be okay because it delivers results. But it also could be too late
to buy for value investors with its psr =4, p/bk = 13x, imo. And it's a gnat
among giants. Pepsi/KO/Cott decide to enter its niche, especially if that niche
grows (which the high p/e suggests), HANS business and p/e will suffer - imo.

JLG still has poor roa numbers, poor profit margins. The stock is selling at
multi-year highs. Business is good for the company as construction market
booms. Little late for a value investor to establish a position at this point.
Again, imo.

OXY is a buy at current price. Imo. I continue to add to my position.

hmmmm did you look at the cash flow statement at all?
I spent five minutes at yahoo and if you did too you would see a company that
has increased its FREE CASH FLOW on a gross and per share basis for the years
2002 thru 2004. FCF is what matters, not text book financial "ratios" based on
EPS that mean next to nothing. You will also see a company that has paid out
more in dividends each year, bought back $1.5b of stock in 04 alone, and over
the years of 2002 to 2004 actually paid down about half a billion $$ in debt.
These are the things that Really matter to shareholders. These are signs of a
business that is very healthy indeed.

Hi Paul - I liked JLG under 10 but have not paid attention to the company for
the past year. Wow! Over $20 now.

That list of remodel companies continue to do quite well. I want to thank you
for the heads up on WHR (Whirlpool) where I made an excellent return w/ my
straddle position. I suspect this housing boom will continue especially w/ the
way I am buying power tools. I noticed that both WallMart and Home Depot carry
all the Black & Decker (BDK) tools each with a different "package" set taylored
for the customers in each store. You will also notice that the boxed sets have
both Spanish and English all over the packaging.

I do not think BDK can be considered a "value" stock anymore but it still
carries only a 13 forward PE eventhough it is trading at an all time high.

The Economist Magazine recently had several articles explaining that this real
estate boom is a "Global" bubble rather than specific to any one country (like
Japan in the early 90's). The U.S. market could be 18 months behind many of the
other countries that have already seen double digit annual price increases.

I like both Citi Corp and JPM and believe they will continue to participate in
this "Global" real estate boom too. They provide the necessary financing to
both their retail and corporate customers that invest in this sector. What in
your opinion are the risks these companies have if this real estate bubble
begins to deflate? Both companies already took huge one time write off's for
their Enron & WorldCom deals in the late 90's (over $2 Billion!). Potential
losses from Global Real Estate deals that go sour could impact future earnings.

What's the best way to quantify this risk and as a value investor what should I
look at to alert me to any potential problems?

It's good to chat with someone with an insight and appreciation for the
contents of Financial Statements. So many other sites I've gone to are
"blinkered" by Technical Analysis and don't appear willing to consider and
incorporate Fundamental Analysis in their investing strategy.
Personally, I'm never too concerned about "multi-year highs" or "gnat among
giants" etc... I prefer to assess a company on the merits of its published
financial results. I utilise what I refer to as a 'QUALITY TEMPLATE', made up
of critical financial ratios and several other criteria, all obtained from
within the Income Statement and Balance Sheet. As long as a company can equal
or better these requirements, then I'm happy to consider the stock. I also
determine whether that stock is currently "cheap" or "expensive" and what its
medium term target price is likely to be. This last calculation narrows down my
selection to those stocks with the greatest price increase potential.
With regard to our own individual stock choices, time, and "the numbers", will

P.S. I'm not quite sure what your reference "psr" refers to.

Hi Suma - I have not followed LNC (Lincoln National Corp ). They offer multiple
insurance and investment management products and services primarily in the
United States and the United Kingdom. LNC is quite profitable and has excellent
free flow cash flow from operations ($6.50/share annual). Their PE seems to be
consistent with other financial stocks at 10.5 and they do pay a "qualified" 3%
dividend. A similar company that you might want to look at is AIG which is
about 20x larger in market cap and pays a much smaller divided. In fact, I
think I like LNC better than AIG because of their larger dividend.

LNC has significantly outperformed AIG and the S&P 500 over the last 5 years.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=5y&s=LNC&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=aig&c=%5EGSPC

========================================================

Perhaps there are some other "Value Investors" that can provide their opinion
on LNC specifically and the insurance industry in general.

I currently do not have any pure insurance company plays in my portfolio(s) and
it might be something I may want to add. I do know that Warren Buffet made a
substantial investment in General Re a few years ago (General Re is one of
Berkshire Hathaway's biggest buys -- and worst investments). Here are some of
the problems Buffet is having with his investment.

I guess the key again is "can management be trusted" and are there any past
deals that may come back to sour the investment. Buffet is now finding this out
with his big investment in General Re.

I happen to like C, mostly because of their diversified business and less
exposure to domestic mortgage earnings than most other banks. C has a worldwide

If I'm correct in assuming you're referring to DHB Industries on the AMEX, my
personal comment on the stock is ...
It's fundamentals look in "good shape", especially when one considers its
Annual results. Most of the important Income Statement criteria I like to focus
on, are in an upward trend. However, its Quarterly results are looking "flat".
Turnover has slowed, with the inevitable dip in other areas such as Return on
Cap. Employed, EPS etc.. DHB also carries a bit too much long term debt for my
liking. This looks like it's currently under control when one considers its
finance charges, but with Greenspan currently raising interest rates, this will
inevitably chip away at the Bottom Line. These aspects seem to be reflected in
DHB's price performance in the last 3 to 6 months. It's fallen from a high of
$21 to its present $8.60. It's currently in a "trading range", i.e. moving
sideways, almost as if the stock is waiting for something to happen !
Compared to other stocks in the same business, its P/E is relatively low. If it
wasn't for the flattening off of its Quarterlies one could regard this as a
good buying opportunity. In my opinion, for what it's worth, I'd wait for its
next set of results. If they show a decent improvement in Turnover etc.., and
the P/E still sits at its current 11 to 12 mark, then DHB's stock price should
have good reason to move upwards from an undervalued position.
But that's JMO.

re DHB - the stock market is looking forward and my guess is that it is
comparing the current order flow rate to the frenzy of orders last year (where
it received a 200M$+ order and some subsequent orders in the tenth million of
US$). it indeed looks like DHB's business will flatten out once the huge orders
from last year are worked off.

FWIW, i don't think it is easy to find stocks with a low PE and accelerating
earnings and revenue growth - since almost everybody is scanning for the same
companies. From the stocks you have brought up, most are cyclicals (oils stocks
like OXY) or are ridiculously overvalued (like HANS).

Hi there Spekulatius ... so you believe HANS is "grossly overpriced".
Well, if your definition is related to a stock's P/E, which, in my opinion, is
an important indicator of this aspect, let's apply some mathematical
analysis...
Below is a table of HANS's EPS (trailing 12 mth), Price, P/E and percentage
increase of its EPS since its previous Quarterly Results :-

DATE......EPS....PRICE....P/E....% INCREASE IN EPS
13/5/05....251c...6230.......25..........31%
14/3/05....191c...5370.......28..........41%
22/11/04..135c...3100.......23..........34%
27/8/04....101c...2121.......21

So we see that HANS's stock price increased by some 194% with its P/E in the
region of 21 to 28. When its stock price was about 6200 just before its results
were announced on the 13/5/05, its P/E would have been 6200/191 = 33, based on
its last 12 month trailing EPS.
From what I think you are saying, HANS would have then been regarded by
yourself as "grossly overpriced", because its current P/E is 8536/251 = 34.
Similarly, on the 14/3/04 HANS's P/E would have been
5370/135 = 39. Yet these "grossly overpriced" periods didn't appear to stop
HANS's stock price from continuing to rise from 2121 to its current 8536, which
is over 300% !!
What I recommend one does is to look for an "average" percentage increase in
EPS and apply it to a stock's previous 12 month EPS and project it forward.
This can be effective if there's been a fairly consistent increase over time.
From the above table, the average percentage increase is (34+41+31)/3 = 35%. If
we now increase HANS's latest EPS by 35% we get
251c x 1.35 = 339c as its "predicted" EPS. Dividing this into its current price
we get a future P/E = 8536/339 = 25.
So we are now back to what HANS has generally been showing, while still
providing a steady increase in stock price.
Since 15/5/03 HANS has never failed to show an increase in its EPS.
So maybe it's not so "grossly overpriced" after all.
I take your point about OXY. However, in my opinion, I don't think it's a case
so much of "cyclical", but rather one of a resource stock's vulnerability to
the price of its resource. In this case, the oil price. This is why I
personally prefer to tread warily with regard to resource stocks, be they oil
based or mineral based. They may be very well run companies in their own right,
but they are generally powerless to influence the falling price of their
resource, which can result in a depleted stock price.

Hi Paul - I also like the water utility sector but am a bit concerned with how
they are currently regulated, specifically many of these private water
utilities are limited (by the local municipality) on what and how much they can
raise prices. Have you seen this constraint in your research of companies in
this industry?

Many municipalities and local governments control the rate of return these
private companies can make on their fixed capital investments. Some
municipalities actually own the infrastructure but outsource the maintenance
and operation of their facility to private companies like SWWC.

Here is the real problem I see in the next ten years. Several of these
municipalities are going broke through unfunded pension liabilities,
artificially high real estate values which (in the short term) provide extra
high property tax revenues that will disappear and potential huge city budget
deficits that will force or delay critical capital spending on water
infrastructure upgrades. Water quality and capacity will go down and the only
solution will be for the municipality to solicit the services of these private
water utilities.

Private water utilities will be more than willing to spend their own capital
and resources to bail out these bankrupt cities but will expect a higher rate
of return and a more flexible pricing policy to recover their investments. I
believe those private water companies that have the experience and capital will
be solicited by these failing (and bankrupt) municipalities to come in and take
over their local municipal water services. This will only occur if these old
pricing (and ROI) constraints are removed.

I believe some of these private water companies are well positioned to provided
many of these necessary and needed services. At current prices they are
extremely undervalued if a "market ROI" is allowed and they can raise customer
prices (w/in reason).

It looks like the end-user will ultimately pay the higher rates and it will be
a windfall for the well managed private water companies.

(http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=5y&s=SWWC&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=awr&c=%5EGSPC )

I continue to like Southwest Water Co (SWWC) and American States Water Co (AWR)
as they are U.S. based companies (pay "qualified" dividends), have operations
in areas of the U.S. where water is in high demand and short supply, and (with
SWWC) seem to have good management in place that currently have gained a lot of
experience providing water treatment outsource services to many municipalities
both large and small.

Your calculation regarding the PEG ratio (PE to earnings growth ratio) is a way
to value stocks but of course a dangerous one with high growth stocks. The
questions is what earnings growth rate will HANS in the future, not in the
past.

My calculation is as follows. I assume that HANS will not be able to expand
it's margin's any more (as it did in the past) since it's gross margins have
already reached 50%, which is a good value for a beverage company. Subsequently
the earnings growth rate will equal the revenue growth rate. I don't think that
HANS will be able to grow as it has in the past,and think a forward growth rate
of 15% is more reasonable. That by the way is higher than the analyst revenue
growth rate estimate of 10% (per yahoo) (for whatever that is worth). From that
perspective, HANS does not look cheap. So much depends on what growth you
assume going forward, which is always a wild bet, IMO.

Incidentally, HANS is a stock i studied 2 years ago - i found it via a low
price to book screen. Trading at around 4$, i put in a lowball bid, which never
came to pass. Oh wey! The stock looked cheap but not a screaming buy back then,

Carl, seeing as you seem determined to drag this issue out into the public
domain, let’s get it over with once and for all.
I did not join this web site to get involved in personal confrontations. I
joined because I have an interest in analysing companies from a Fundamentalist
point of view. From what I saw, initially, that’s what most of the contributors
also appear to do. If I saw otherwise, I wouldn’t have bothered. There are more
than enough Chat Rooms and Message Boards devoted, primarily, to Technical
Analysis.
I cannot understand your paranoia about people creating other identities. Do
you have much personal experience in this regard ? Because Dale Baker saw fit
to ban me without having the courtesy to discuss the matter and preferred,
instead, to insult me without my being able to defend myself, I saw no option
other than to create a once-off, new identity and have my say, face to face.
After being banned from ‘50%’, I noticed an ongoing attack on me from several
members, including yourself. Is that your example of grown up individuals
acting their age ?
Ernest Hudsonman has become a good friend of mine. We share an interest in the
stock market, we regularly correspond via the Net, and follow similar methods
of analysis which we both obtained from the writings of Dr. Karl Posel. As it
happens, Ernest and his wife are spending a vacation in my part of the world
and are using my home as their base. After showing him this web site, as well
as the unfortunate incident at ‘50%’ etc…, he thought it a good idea to (a)
join siliconinvestor and (b) provide some ‘friendly support’ should I need it.
Unfortunately SI’s Management seems to have made the same assumption as you,
probably because of an IP address. But that’s their prerogative. All I can say
is, that’s the way it is. How you, and others, wish to view it is your affair.
With regard to the private message, Yes, maybe I shouldn’t have publicised the
contents together with the author’s name. However, stating one without the
other could be presumed to have come from me. I searched several threads to
find another L _Long message so that I could at least acknowledge receipt, but
could find nothing. I don’t have the luxury of being able to reply privately. I
thought he might have used a once-off identity to have his say, because he
could have no guarantee that what he said may not become public.
With regard to admitting mistakes etc…, I believe I’ve done enough to publicly
make my apologies to Dave Lawrence on several threads. I don’t believe I have
anything for which to apologise to dale baker. My original referral to Senior
Management on Baker’s thread was because I assumed that Dave Lawrence and his
partner were the final arbiters as to what could or couldn’t be done on
SiliconInvestor. I obviously wouldn’t have made that reference if I knew that
Baker had FULL control of that thread, now would I ?!!
Anyway, as I said in Message 21513 below, I’ve now put that unfortunate saga
behind me. I’ll not be spending anymore of my time on this issue. I wish you
well with your investments.

Yes, if you’d bought a 1000 of HANS at $4.00 2 years ago, you’d be worth an
additional $81000 today !
Actually it wasn’t my intention to present HANS according to the PEG theory,
but rather to highlight the fact that its P/E ratio just prior, and just after,
the publication of its Financial Results would show very different scenarios
based on what HANS showed in its Bottom Line, and hence in its EPS and P/E.
Once HANS showed the market what it had earned in the last Quarter, the market
responded by buying its stock and so raising the price. The market also
appeared prepared to trade HANS with P/E’s of between 21 and 28. My last
calculation of 8536/339 = 25 is unlikely to occur as we can expect HANS’s price
to increase by some amount. If we take the average of your 15% and the
Analyst’s rate of 10% we have a future price of 8536 x 1.125 = 9600, giving a
forward P/E of 9600/339 = 28. This is at the top end of HAN’s past acceptable
price, all things being equal !
I see you prefer to look at a company's Gross Profit. My personal preference is
the relationship between Turnover and EBIDTA. I like to see the effect of BOTH
Cost of Sales and Running Expenses, but that's JMO.
I would agree with you that we aren’t likely to see the sort of price growth
rates, in percentage terms, that we’ve seen in the past. But, as always, the
proof of the pudding is in the numbers, which is why I prefer to wait and see
what a company’s published financial statements tell me before I come to any
conclusions. Thanx for your in depth replies.

Well, in my opinion TWIN is certainly undervalued with its P/E at just under
10. Its competitors seem to operate between about 14 and 22. But more
importantly, a far as I'm concerned, is what its P/E should be, based on a
combination of its Dividend Cover and best market interest rate. Using this
info I get TWIN's P/E to be +/- 16. All we need now is to see TWIN improve its
Turnover on a regular basis. Unfortunately it's much the same as it was 4
Quarters, and also 4 years, ago.
It certainly has a nice Divided Yield of 3.2%. Hopefully it won't be a

re TWIN - I guess you have failed to notice that TWIN's revenues, while they
stagnated between Y2000-2004 are up 20% YoY in 2005:
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/100378/000010037805000014/r10q305.txt

Earnings are down however in the last quarter, due to rising material cost and
the increase in the Euro. With steel prices and the Euro retreating, i suspect
that the pressure on TWIN's gross margin should abate.

Legg Mason Deal with C -
i don't think that a 3.7B$ deal will chan ge much for a company with a 240B$
market cap (although it will be a big deal for LM with a 10.%B$ market cap).
Since the deal is accreditive to LM, i assume that we will see a very modest
earning reduction for C, unless they find a new home for the cash they are
getting ( I assume it is C's plan to sell the LM stock). So in a nutshell,
while it's big deal for LM, it's almost a non-event for C.

I see you have based your "20%" increase on a comparison of 9 month to previous
9 month financial results. In my opinion it’s more common to compare Year end
to Year end. If we do that and look at the Turnover achieved at those reporting
periods, we have :-
Year end 6/2004 = $186.1 mil.
Year end 6/2003 = $179.6 mil.
Year end 6/2002 = $179.4 mil.
Year end 6/2001 = $180.8 mil.
Year end 6/2000 = $178.0 mil.
The percentage increase is now only 6.5% between 2003 and 2004.
In addition, if we want to look at TWIN’s recent trend of Turnover, we can
study their ongoing Quarterly results :-
25/05/05 = $56.4 mil.
11/02/05 = $54.7 mil.
18/10/04 = $45.4 mil.
21/09/04 = $57.1 mil.
13/05/04 = $48.6 mil.
The latest Quarterly increase is 3.1%. If they can keep this up from now on,
then prospects may be better. We’ll have to wait and see what their next set of
Financial Results look like.
As I stated in my previous message, and as things stand, both period analyses
look pretty flat, "up and down" and un-inspiring in my opinion. I personally
don’t see a nice regular, uptrend in Gross Turnover, for whatever reason.
I use a company analysis strategy that I learned from my friend, Dr. Karl Posel
D.Sc. Ph.D. He advocates that one should ensure that a company’s results
etc..., satisfy 12 "Laws", or criteria, before one considers their stock for
purchase (a sort of QUALITY TEMPLATE). Six of those "Laws" are based on
critical financial ratios, each with a target percentage, obtained from within
the Income Statement and Balance Sheet. A company’s ratios must equal or exceed
these target percentages for it to qualify for further analysis (One tends to
see above average companies exhibiting/exceeding these specific financial ratio
criteria). If it does, the next step is to determine whether it’s currently
under- or overvalued. If it’s the former, the final check is to determine a
probable future price increase. If one now has a short list of 4 or 5
companies, the one we would target is that one showing the largest, probable
price increase.
One of the ratios we would target is the EBIDTA/Turnover number, viz. Operating
Margin, which takes into account both Cost of Sales and Running Expenses.
In TWIN’s case this is just over 8% in its last Annual and just over 7% in its
latest Quarterly. We’d be looking for more than that.
If you, or anyone else, would like to see what companies can achieve, that
consistently satisfy these 12 Criteria, you can go to the SI Board "50% GAINS
INVESTING", and find message 41699, "That guy caught my interest also", by
Sergio H. He kindly ? or inadvertently ? put a link there, that if you follow
it, will lead you to a web site that shows you 3 examples of these companies.
Wilson Baley Homes is currently at 3050 and Dawn is at 595. These 3 companies
achieved between 96% and 154% price increases within a 12 month period.

Bruwin: re TWIN - obviously, one needs to look at 2005 revenues and they are up
20%. I don't think that this is a fluke and may be a sign of better signs to
come. If not, the stock will probably just stay stuck in the current trading
range.

If you look at 2004 to 2003 revenues you invest by looking into the rear mirror
and will never catch a rising star. HANS had stagnating revenues in 2003 when i
looked at it back then and a low profitability. Your website reveals little
about your investment methodology. The charts that are presented look great of
course but the question is, when did you method give the buy signal? Based on
the way you look at the fundamentals, i'd guess not too early.

Yes, I agree, it is necessary to look at 2005 Revenues. But in the case of
TWIN’s latest report, they are comparing 9 Months with 9 Months. There’s a 3
Month set of figures still to come. Personally, I like to look at the full 12
month picture and compare it with the previous full 12 month picture. The last
5 Quarterlies were not, in my opinion, terribly inspiring. However, there was a
positive 3.1% up-move in its latest 3 Month T/O, so if that trend should
continue then TWIN’s price, and Bottom Line, could benefit.
I’m afraid I cannot agree with your "rear mirror theory". The best one knows
about a company is what one sees in its LATEST Financial Reports. That’s when,
in our opinion, one should be making decisions about a company’s future
prospects. But included in those reports will be the prior financial
performances of the company. One needs to see how trends have developed in
certain critical areas of the Income Statement and Balance Sheet and draw
conclusions from those calculations.
As I previously mentioned, one is looking for those characteristics that ABOVE
AVERAGE companies generally display, which generally indicate that they are
probably outperforming their competitors and producing regular, and increasing,
profits. This makes them more attractive to investors, who will then want to
invest in QUALITY, and so produce a BUYING DEMAND which will, inevitably, raise
the stock’s price. The 3 companies on my web site all exhibit these qualities,
and one could have confidently bought in several months from their ‘start to
rise’ and still have made very good profits.
Yes, back in 2003 I wouldn’t have bought HANS’s stock either. But back in 2003
HANS wasn’t displaying the Critical Financial criteria that it started to show
during 2004. If the "buy signals" you are referring to are those from Technical
Analysis, then we may be on a different wave length. I have my own "horse and
cart" theory, where the "horse", i.e. the performance of a company’s
Fundamentals, PRECEDES the "cart", i.e. the reflection of those results in a
company’s charts and Technicals. Therefore I prefer not to put the cart before
the horse ! The quality of the financial reports that HANS produced early in
2004, and to follow, would have shown one that this was a company to consider
investing in. We prefer to "sacrifice" an early bit of price increase until we
get suitable confirmation that, fundamentally, things are going well. Because
then one is not SPECULATING, but INVESTING.
The one current aspect about HANS that may affect holding the stock, is whether
or not it is entering the area of being too expensive.
Yes, you’re quite right, there is not much about my investment methodology on

"Falling knife" you say ? Well, in my humble opinion, I'm surprised that MAXY
(and I'm assuming here that you're referring to Maxygen Incorporated) hasn't
used that knife to commit 'hari kari' !
When I called up MAXY's Financial Statements, the first thing that caught my
eye was the fact that, in the last 5 years, they haven't managed to make a
profit at the EBIDTA level !!
Now if one is running a business, and after purchasing whatever you need plus
the cost of running expenses, you are still not able to show a positive profit,
then there's something not quite right with your business plan. Fair enough, a
lot of MAXY's expense goes into R&D, but when are they going to come up with a
product that produces a decent revenue ? With the exception of their last
Annual results, published on the 8/2/05, they've shown regular Bottom Line
LOSSES. The only thing that saved them in their latest number was a $58.4mil.
net income from 'discontinued operations'. They're unlikely to have that come
to their rescue next year.
And another offshoot of these ongoing losses, is the effect it has on the
company's Equity. In order to stay away from looming Insolvency, MAXY has to
continually add in Capital. One wonders where this is coming from ? I can't
imagine many bank managers are going to lend money for ever and a day to a
company that shows regular losses. And it's always more expensive selling
shares to the public.

DRL - I think if you have some patience the stock could easily be a double... 

I picked up some DRL last week. This Yahoo post summarizes well my take on its
fall:

Re: value
by: ghbond
Long-Term Sentiment: Strong Buy 06/20/05 10:20 pm
Msg: 18025 of 18054

Unlike some of the value investors who have been lead here by scans, I have
been tracking DRL for years, as one of the top performing stocks in the stock
market. What I do is track the great stocks/companies, and buy them when some
temporary ill befalls the stock.

An example is Sysco, SYY, the name you see on the food delivery trucks. SYY was
beaten up in sympathy with Royal Dutch Ahold when they went through their
financial scandle. I fearlessly bought the bottom, and was rewarded.

In the case of DRL, there was no scandal, just a disagreement on how to best
report the value of some mortgage packages sold by DRL. DRL sells fixed rate,
and borrows at variable rate, puts the whole thing together as a package, and
values it based on the expected life of the mortgages and the difference in the
rate over the life of the mortgages.

To figure out the life of the mortgages, they have the history of the behavior
of borrowers, so that they can say that the average life of the mortgages will
be "X" years. To figure out the rate, they take the difference between the
fixed rate, which they know, and the libor rate. The libor rate is a banking
standard for interest rates, kind of like the daily fix for rates.

DRL was using the actual value of libor when they reported the earnings from
these packages, which were reported at forward discount, meaning that the value
of the money was reported in one year, even though the payments were to be
spread out over several years.

Enter the pesky accountants, who complained that using the current libor was
giving too rosey of a picture, because rates were likely to rise over time,
reducing the actual earnings of the packages. This means that the earnings
stated by DRL MIGHT not be accurate, because interest rates MIGHT rise. The
pesky accounting types wanted DRL to use the "forward libor curve" which takes
into account the EXPECTED decay in the value of these packages.

To summarize, DRL is going from an assumption of consistant interest rates
going forward, to a curve which predicts rising interest rates going forward.
Of course, when they do that, all the packages they sold, which were valued
using the constant rate assumption, must now be revalued using the rising rate
assumption. Thus, the infamous "restatement".

Investors are confused and frightened by the scarey libor curve, thus the
stampede out of DRL stock, and the stampede of lawyers eager to collect fees
from those who don't understand their own responsibility when they undertake to
invest in stock.

We should see a strong recovery in DRL stock as the masses slowly realize that
there is nothing wrong with DRL, just accountants jerking each other off.

re BSX : down but not out, IMO. The 74M$ fine and the payments to JNJ hurt but
will not damage the company. With respect to the Isreali company that was
supposed to manufacture the stents for BSX, i was following this situation a
bit and believe that damages will be far lower than the sum you mentioned. In
my opinion it was the Isreali company that could not get things done, until BSX
lost confidence in them and had no choice but to build their own plant. I don't
see how that can lead to multi billion $ damages.

The bull side for BSX is that they are very competitive in the growing stent
market, despite strong competition and appear to make good progress developing
next generation products in the stent and other medical device markets. For my
part, I am holding and inclined to add on weakness.

Greetings Madharry ... thanx for your response. As you quite rightly said,
"everyone looks at things differently".
In my case, whether a PUBLIC company is involved in the Biotechnology business,

shareholders. I believe I alluded to the nature of MAXY's business by stating
that a lot of expense goes into R&D, which is what you'd expect from
Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Pharmaceuticals etc.. They need to spend on
research in order to come up with the money-making products. However, in MAXY's
case, all we can see are 5 years of Bottom Line Losses (It would have been six
years and -$49.1 mil. in the latest Annual, but a Net Income from discontinued
operations gave it a $58.4 mil. boost). Now maybe there's some great product
about to be launched, and maybe it will sell well. But there again, maybe
there's also a competitor with his own "great product" that may provide strong
competition to MAXY. The end result of that scenario will be viewed in the
Bottom Line. But until we see those numbers in print, it's all speculation.
Probably my choice of "looming" gave the wrong impression. Maybe "potential"
would have been a better choice. I wasn't trying to infer that MAXY would be
Insolvent in the next few months. My reference to "Insolvency" comes from the
traditional Balance Sheet equation which says :-
Shareholders funds+long term loans+deferred tax = Fixed assets+Current assets
-Current liabilities.
This can be re-arranged to state :-
Shareholders funds = Total Assets - Total Liabilities.
In MAXY's case, its ONGOING Bottom Line losses get algebraically added to
'Shareholders funds'. So continual negative numbers reduce the total on the
left hand side of the equation. When that reaches a minus value, then Total
Liabilities EXCEED Total Assets, which, as far as I'm aware, is Technical
Insolvency.
So ... in my opinion, it's in MAXY's interest to start making Bottom Line
profits in order to boost Reserves within Shareholders Funds, and so avoid
having to issue shares to the public to increase Share Capital in order to
avoid potential Insolvency.

Biotech is frequently a winner take all game- thats the reality- If the company
develops a successful products its a home run otherwise the name of the game is
survival. The trick is to either develop products or obtain sufficient
financing to develop products before the money runs out. If you are a cash flow
investor -Biotechs are not for you. The profit from a discontinued operation
was not a fluke- MAXY sold one of its two subsidiaries, in order to focus on
drug development. The fact that it sold at a nice profit should tell you that
they were successful at something. To me this is one of the strongest small
biotechs around because their cash to net cap is so large. Its also
strengthened by the their deal with Roche and their minority owned subsidiary
which is also generating some revenues. I estimate that the company can go
another 4-5 years without needing cash infusions and thats pretty good for a
biotech.

Yes ... well ... personally I don’t have a problem investing in Biotech
companies, but I prefer not to speculate in my purchase, be it Biotech, Motor
car parts, Building Supplies etc.. What I need to see is a company with a solid
financial pedigree that has, and is, making regular profits. We can determine
that by targeting several strategic areas in a company’s Financial Statements,
such as Turnover, EBIDTA, Finance Costs, Profit before Tax, Long Term Debt
etc.. etc.. We look for relationships between these items and compare them to
targets that have been set. These targets are generally met, or exceeded, by
QUALITY, profitable companies. Then, as I’ve mentioned before, we ascertain
under-overvalued status, and a probable price increase percentage. Needless to
say, no company exhibiting regular bottom line losses will ever pass those
tests.
Even if MAXY comes up with a good product, how does one know at this stage,
whether or not it will make decent, regular profits ? How efficient will they
be ? How stiff will the competition be ? Will something better arrive on the
scene a year or two later ? These and other aspects affecting MAXY’s financial
performance will only become apparent once we see the numbers contained in
their future financial statements. If MAXY’s future results give it QUALITY
status, then we move from the arena of Speculation, into the less risky one of
sound, verifiable Investment. Yes, maybe their "cash to net cap" is large, but
the question is "how well will they use that cash, and what profit will it
create?" The same can be said for "their deal with Roche". The "proof of these
puddings" will only be seen in the quality of their future financial results.
At the moment, MAXY may, in your opinion, be "one of the strongest, small
biotechs around", but have they proved to their investors that they can deliver
regular profits ?
This, of course, is just my opinion. How others invest, and what they invest
in, is entirely their own affair.

re GCI. While I do agree that GCI has good economics, I abstain from buying
this stock as well as any other newspaper stock because I believe that their
main income source advertising is under serious attack from many different
angles:

1) Reduced circulation (which is an indication that newpapers are less
relevant)
2) Online competition (blogs for news, internet sources) listing services (ebay
and in particular craigslist).

The latter could be the dark horse that could bring newspapers in serious
trouble. This article from the FOOL's makes a pretty good point imo:

http://www.fool.com/News/mft/2004/mft04123013.htm

You may be right about GCI; stock does continue to drift down.
I'll hold for a while longer, but I'm not inclined to add more.

FII. I'll continue to hold this one.

BSX. I'll continue to hold too. My shares are few so my exposure isn't that
much. I'm not inclined to add more though - there just seems to be one item
after another of bad news with this one.

OFG. I'll bet along with you that the stock might recover. In past they've been
very successful, but if there are/were accounting issues, then going forward,
past performance might be misleading if one relied on it. At my first glance, I
don't see where they have reported derivative issues like DRL. Regardless, they
now say they are changing their business model as regards what they will do
with loans they make and that that change will take some time. So there'll be a
couple or more of difficult quarters ahead. I've taken a few shares today,
betting that eventually OFG's management skills and the apparent asset
strengths of the company will enable an earnings and stock recovery. I'll plan
on adding more if/as stock drops with no further adverse news.

AIG: Greenberg seemed to be less trustworthy and more arrogant than was good
for the company. I suspected AIG's problems were deeper than had been revealed,
so I did not re-buy any shares. Looks like I was wrong. Recent news indicates
AIG's size and earnings power apparently outweigh any shenanigans that Mr.

Auto retailers. The stocks continue to drop. The drop has been sharper after GM
announced it will sell cars at the employee price, and Chrysler is considering
the same tactic.

Apparently this hurts the retailers two ways: first, the price is apparently
fixed - no haggling, so that perhaps reduces the ability of the salespeople to
negotiate higher profits among the otherwise not-so-savy car shoppers.
Secondly, that low employee price also drops the price of used cars, so there's
apparently less profit potential from used cars on the dealers' lots. (Used car
sales are a significant contributor to dealer profits.)

Over time I've sold down my positions in the sector, and now I only hold stub
positions. At this point I'm willing to begin building up GPI, which is at a
12-month low now. Merrill Lynch has downgraded the sector, and estimates that
GPI will earn $3.20/sh. next year. Imo, that's not too bad given that the stock
is under $25/sh., trading close to stated book value, and with a price/sales
figure of .11. Debt/eq. is high per Yahoo number of 1.9/1, and that stated book
value number includes the acquisitions GPI makes as it expands geographically
and by franchise.

Suma, from what I can understand you take concentrated positions and
plan/want/expect gains fairly rapidly. So perhaps you exit positions quickly if
there's no gain or if the gain occurs quickly.

Imo, no person who doesn't have some good insight/insider information should
have committed big to MEH with big dollars expecting quick gains. The stock
surprised (imo) and did well and quickly. So on a percentage gain and on an
annualized basis, the numbers look good. But - in my case anyway, it's small
potatoes - the actual dollar amounts aren't noticeable in my portfolios.

If you're kicking yourself for not buying, that's one thing. But if you're
jealous of me, that'd be a mistake. As I look in my portfolios, I see many
small potatoes, and some rotten ones too. Plus, you are assuming I am actually
a real investing person who exists outside of cyberspace. That could be a
dangerous assumption!

---------------This is my truth---->>
Imo, the BIG profits are not being made by the things you are seeing. They are
being made quietly in corners where you are not seeing them. That is, for
example, MEH was mentioned, you looked at it, you made your decision, and
fairly quickly and somehow you saw that the stock moved up and maybe moved up
strongly. So you are reacting to what you've observed.

However, catching the posts about MEH and getting the stock's subsequent
movement is NOT where the real profits are being made here.

Where you are not looking and seeing is the stocks that have been mentioned
here in 2003, 2002, 2001, and earlier that have moved up really substantially -
multibaggers. Stocks from several different sectors that people have bought and
posted on, occasionally reposted about, and occasionally added to if the value
still seemed compelling. You will only rarely read of these stocks and the
successes people have had with them. Imo, if someone needed to kick themselves
for not buying and holding, it is these stocks that one should have regrets
about.

Recent Activity.

Bought First Marblehead (FMD) at $34 and $39. Per Yahoo, it "...provides
outsourcing services for private education lending in the United States. Its
integrated suite of design, implementation, and securitization services for
student loan programs...." The forward PE is around 12 and it has compounded
revenues at 120% the last two years. IMO, the company may benefit from a
secular change toward private funding of education loans and it seems to be
building a decent moat around its business. The company is designed to not take
risk as a lender. The business is complex enough that I don't understand it
well enough to put a lot of money in, but it's pretty interesting.

Bought St Paul Travelers at $39. PE is under 9 and price to book is about 1.3
without a whole lot of goodwill on the books.

Bought the New York Times around $31. Forward PE is about 16. I don't believe
NYT is particularly vulnerable to loss of classifieds to the internet and the
stock is at a 5 year low.

Sold Natuzzi (NTZ) at around $9. Recent news has not been good and I felt
fortunate to exit with a small loss.

Sold Furniture Brands (FBN) at $21. Buy mentioned here:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=18522731
Their recent decision to have retail outlets is risky or dubious depending on
how much credit you wish to give management. Again, fortunate to exit with
small loss.

Sold Pier 1 (PIR) at $16.57. Buffett recently bought in but I've held since
9/2001 (buy price: $8.41) and the 2005 and 2006 earnings estimates produced PEs
in the 27+ range.

Sold Constellation Brands around $30 with a 110% gain. Current year PE is over
18 and it's relatively leveraged. I am more comfortable with BUD and DEO.

Sold Lab Corp (LH) at $49 for a 70% gain and Equifax (EFX) at $30 for a 33%
gain. (Buys discussed here:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=19433079
I'm still holding Quest Diagnostics because it's organic revenue growth was
less anemic than LH. With regard to EFX I benefitted from some multiple
expansion and worried some about the free internet credit report requirements.

Sold QC Holdings for a 12% loss (QCCO). Their recent earnings report undercut
the growth story and I was chastened by their report that loan loss ratios on
their de novo stores were 30 to 35 percent. Buy discussed here:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=21308167

Closed out my Bennett Environmental (BEL) at around $3. I made 20+ percent
because I swing traded it when it bounced above $4. It looks like the company
will have to go back to the equity markets again this year the way it's burning
cash. I'm interested in reinvesting but not until they have issued the equity
or fixed the cash burn.

re VIA - this one refuses to follow my logic. LOL. Adding a few shares makes
this (together with Via.v) my largest position. 1.63B shares outstanding, with
roughly 3B$ in FCF this year. EV (including around 9.5B$ in net debt) is around
61B$, EBITDA is around 5.5B$. Growth in the near term future in the low single
digits. I am estimating that the company should bring the sharecount down to
1.5B shares with buybacks - 2$ earnings/share (which are almost entirely
converted into FCF). Low risk business model and the split into cable/film and
CBS/outdoor/radio should enhance shareholder value. Lower quality media
properties (like broadcasters) are going for 12-15x EBITDA. The relative
valuation of Viacom makes little sense to me and i am betting that this will

EGR doesn't look an oil company to me. It looks to me a like retail energy

Margins are thin for retail energy, and these companies face a lot of

energy. I worked for one such company, and it went bankrupt. Note: We had

This_is_the_end: Yes, that figure might be a bottom, but who knows? I see that

last December.

This stock just seems so thinly traded. I'd like to pay lower for my recent
purchases, and the trading range indicates that I could. I've tried over the
past couple of weeks, but I've had no good luck. If I put in a day order for
say @1.60 it either won't trade there that day or if it does I get a fill for
only 100 or so shares. And when I figure in a cheap commission on $160 purchase
- that does raise the cost/sh.

My total position here would be small - not a big dollar amount. And I guess
I've lost patience. So I've decided that for me, rather than play around with
VERY small orders every day (I'd be looking for $1.55/sh) , I'll take shares at
the $1.6+ area and be done with it unless I spot a big gap down on no adverse
news. (Then I'll add at that price.) If the stock behaves as it did in the past
- and that is my hope, but I have no real basis for suggesting it might - then
being in the stock at $1.65+ would be better than not being in it because I
couldn't get my buy price of say $1.55.

Paul,

I bot this near end of last year (possibly mentioned on this board? --- I
probably sold too early but made some decent money), so I am not totally
against the idea. Just letting you know this has been a horrendous business and
that the business could easily eat them up. For a normal stock with decent
prospect, I would normally back up the truck given the balance. Here I am not
so sure.

They are in a terrible business (at least it was when I was in it), and the
excerpt below doesn't give me any confidence these guys know how to navigate
it. Retail suppliers usually get hurt by commodity volatility, up or down
(i.e., if cold winter -> have to buy gas @ skyrocketing high prices to supply
greater customer demand. if warm winter -> have to dump extra gas @ low prices
cuz customers don't want it). Same idea with electricity supply during summer.
Plus you have customers churning out all the time, and you have to compete with
utilities that want to drive you out of business and have lots of money and
political connections to do it with.

Just keep that in mind.

In the second quarter ended January 31, 2005 the Company announced a strategic
realignment of its Pennsylvania customer portfolio and the sale of excess
supply contracts. Due to timing and forecasting issues associated with the
implementation of the portfolio realignment, the Company incurred costs for
more electricity than planned during the transition period. As a result of
these issues the company is restating the previously reported second quarter
gain from $9.3 million to $7.2 million to account for the higher cost of the
replacement power. The effect of the restatement is to change the previously
reported net income of $1.4 million in the three months ended January 31, 2005
to a loss of $0.7 million, and the previously reported net income of $0.3
million for the six months ended January 31, 2005, to a loss of $1.8 million.
As a result, the Company has filed a Current Report on Form 8-K and an amended
second quarter Form 10-Q today reflecting the restatement. The Company has also
determined that the timing and forecasting issues related to the implementation
of the Pennsylvania portfolio realignment constituted a material weakness in
internal controls. Improving the Company's internal controls is a significant
issue that is being addressed by ongoing process improvements, which include
new reconciliation procedures and capital investment in new, externally
developed, systems to replace internally developed software.

Well, it just goes to show you what PR is worth sometimes, especially if it
comes from the company itself. They’re not likely to highlight the negative
aspects.
It’s stated that "on April 30 2005, company had total assets of $101.2 mil."
.... "stockholders equity of $72.4 mil". I say "So what !". Maybe it had Total
Assets of $101.2 mil., but it also had Total Liabilities of $101.2 mil. In Oct.
2004 it had $107.6 mil. in Total Assets and $74.5 mil. in Shareholders Equity.
So both numbers have actually COME DOWN. Instead of focussing on the Balance
Sheet, maybe they should have spent some time looking closer at the Income
Statement.
What the PR department doesn’t focus on is the miniscule Operating Margin of
-0.6% in the latest Quarter and only 1.19% in Oct. 2004. A drop of 50% !!
Several of their competitors show Op. Margins of between 11% and 37%.
It also doesn’t mention the fact that Turnover increased by 17% from $58.5 mil.
in Oct. 2004 to $68.5 mil. in Apr. 2005. But the Bottom Line was -$1.1 mil. in
2004 and ANOTHER LOSS of -$1.0 mil. in 2005. So EGR increased Turnover by $10
mil. but could only reduce it’s Bottom Line LOSS by $0.1 mil. !
Personally, IMO, this doesn’t strike me as a company that is, or was, going
places.
However, from what I read, there were others who thought, and maybe still
think, differently. I read that $1.50 may be "the bottom" .... I wonder.

I have operated over the last 20 years on the assumption that smallcaps
outperform larger caps and the value outperforms growth.

Ive read dozens of books and things over the years that have pretty much said
the same thing.

I prefer microcaps because I figure that most of the really smart folks are
running a large enough amount of money that they have to play in bigger
playgrounds.

That way I am not competing head to head with folks who are a lot smarter than
me and/or who might have better access to information than I do.

Tweedy Browns "What Has Worked In Investing" seems consistent with my belief
and my observations over the years.

http://www.tweedy.com/content.asp?pageref=reports

As a general rule, I tend to avoid the larger cap stocks and probably
over-diversify with the smaller ones.

Over the last few years, I have not been finding the kind of values that I like
and as a result, I have been holding more cash as a % of my portfolio than I
ever have.

Over the years, I have followed "the insiders" and picked up a number of
overlooked microcaps many of which I still follow and/or trade on a regular
basis.

I also follow insiders in the aggregate for a clue as to the overall market.
The insider buy/sell ratio has been pretty darn bearish for years now. Some,
like Hulbert attempt to "explain away" that by saying stock options account for
the extra selling.

I disagree because on the same hand, we have a LOT of supposed "insider" buys
by folks who are NOT insiders and have no insider knowledge, they are just
running hedge funds and have to put that money to work somewhere.

So, I believe the real insiders....the smart money....is and has been voting
with their pocketbooks which suggests to me the market as a whole is not
undervalued. Nor are there any obvious "pockets of value" like I used to be
able to find.

Ive recently had good fortune with what was & is my largest position. PURW
which Ive been following for many years.

Its been a good trader but I was convinced it was going to be bought out and
have been adding to my position for some time.

They recently announced a buyout at $4.30. This is a stock I was buying for as
little as 41 cents a few years ago.

This buyout is bittersweet though because it was a fantastic trading stock for
me. Wide swings as a result of flucuating sales & earnings. So, I bought low
and sold high and now, will be bought out at higher than I even reasonably had
hoped.

Here is what I posted on another board where a number of us had just enjoyed a
nice buyout with ONYX.

12/31/04

PURW....$1.56 Book value of $2.04. Replacement value $3.50-4.00+.

They put themselves on the block in Jan but in June despite getting numerous
indications of interest they chose not to pursue any of them at the time.

Since then, they have resumed their buyback and bought back stock in June,
July, August and Sept at prices averaging $1.96. I suspect they have continued
buying as the price has dropped but that information wont be out untill the
year end report comes out.

I believe that PURW will be sold, its just a matter of when. The chairman &
majority owner is 68 however so I dont think it will be a 5 year wait.

My guesstimate of an eventual sale price is in the $2.50-$4.00 range or more to
a strategic buyer.

---------

My search for low priced, value stocks goes on.

But, unlike others, I dont feel the need to buy something just to be buying it.
I want stocks that fit the profile of my past winners. (Below book value,
insider buying and/or company buyback, low P/E, low price/sales & so forth)

There are some perils with the microcaps. They can & do deregister on you. I
have been hurt pretty bad by one that did that but a number of others havent
been so bad.

On the flip side for the low floats that havent deregistered, the low float
pump & dumpers tend to pile on & off every so often and allow nice trading
opportunities.

Im a little suprised that more on this thread dont focus on the lower priced
stocks. Its easier for a 40 cent stock to $4 than a $20 stock to go to $200.

I realize there arent dozens of attractive 40 cents stocks but the point
remains valid.

One more thing that is consistent with my lack of not finding good stocks is
Tweedy Brown cant either...

"Please note that effective May 4th, 2005, at 4 P.M. , the Tweedy, Browne
Global Value Fund and the Tweedy, Browne American Value Fund, will at least
temporarily, no longer accept subscriptions from new investors. Management of
the Funds has come to this decision as a result of what it believes to be a
limited amount of new investment opportunities available in the United States
and around the globe. "

Grommit, others interested in mez. debt and equity companies:

I wonder if this company could see some of the success that the BDC's have
seen:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=PSEC

Apparently structured differently from BDC's and with enegy sector as a
specific focus. Stock up from lows but below its IPO price. Sells below book
value.

I'll take some shares now. Add more if positive indications emerge.

And I'll take some VLTX.pk

From their press relaease:

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/050629/law055.html?.v=18

"Veltex currently has approximately ten million shares outstanding and
forecasts that 2005 total revenues will exceed $60 million with net earnings
easily surpassing $1.00 per share."

I must be missing something in these numbers. But if not, and management isn't
hyping/lying, with the stock at under $1.70/sh, that's a p/e under 2, and an
automatic buy, as far as I'm concerned.

Well, judging by the number of ‘complaint’ e-mails that SI Admin (Dave) said he
received regarding my recent posts, I must again apologize. I really thought I
may be doing folk a good turn by bringing a consistently high paying investment
source to the attention of all. Yes, there is a referral benefit, but that
applies to anyone. I certainly wouldn’t have brought it to your attention if I,
and others, hadn’t proved its ongoing returns.
Quite honestly, I saw this in the same light as contributors to this Board
bringing stocks or funds to the attention of all concerned, which they thought
exhibited Value, and would increase in price and outperform their competitors.
Anyway ... sorry folks. Forget I said anything.

One thing you might be missing is financial reporting. These guys don't put out
stuff in a timely manner. There are no filings with the SEC. On their webpage,
in March '05, the CEO brags about a consolidated report the makes his
complicated corporate structure easier to comprehend. That report gives the
numbers for year 2003. And the numbers are terrible. There's nothing for 2004
or 2005.

I see that their new business plan is to purchase promotional gear, and certain
rights in Canada. I didn't think anyone ever paid for that stuff.

In any case several years ago I read some of the VLTX fluff and asked someone
who ran a silk screen shop about the advantages of using T-shirts from
Bangladesh. He said none. He said that he would worry about quality, sizing,
etc. and said that there were lots and lots of these suppliers out there.

Before I spent a nickel on their stock, I would drive over to their
headquarters (Anaheim or City of Industry?).

I think this Veltex (VLCX) is a scam for several commonsense reasons:

(1) They have tried to hype the stock through several OTC websites. They claim
they are going to get audited financials and have never done it. They tried to
pay for analyst coverage, but the analyst wouldn't do it.

(2) I ordered online through their website last December, had to revise my
order because they didn't have it in stock (they called a couple weeks after I
put in my initial order), and still never got my revised order.

(3) If the stock were that cheap, why wouldn't the CEO and his brother buy the
stock rather than hyping it??? Just doesn't make sense.

If you can prove otherwise, I'll back up the truck, otherwise I'm not touching
this one ...

Firstly, I believe your "VLCX" and Paul Senior's "VLTX" should possibly read
"VLXC".
Secondly, I'm surprised to read comments about an OTC stock, for which I cannot
find audited Financial Statements, being seriously considered in a forum which
I assumed was frequented by Value Investors and Fundamental Analysts ?
Probably there's a source of Financial Statements that I'm not aware of.

I notice that you, and one or two other contributors to SI's Boards, use the
P/BK ratio as a stock "Value" consideration. I assume that P/BK stands for
Price to Book ratio.
I'd be interested to know what your definition of "Book Value" is, and why you
consider the P/BK an important ratio
(with regard to Industrial companies only).
