OT somewhat.

OK, I looked at the oil futures contracts. It is quite interesting that the
more in the future you look the lower are oil future prices. Let's compare with
gold, for example. June 2009 gold futures are the most expensive. The oil is
completely reversed - December 2009 contracts are the least expensive.

Unless I don't understand something about futures - my understanding is that I
am buying a contract for set amount of raw material to be delivered at the
given price on the indicated time - oil future pricing means that the market
believes that the oil will drop from current prices to at least $35 in the next
5 years. Is my interpretation correct?

Thanks for any feedback

Oil futures,

Jurgis, yes the market believes oil will drop.

I think there might be a risk premium in oil futures so the futures price may
not quite be the expected spot price (i.e., investors are rewarded for the risk
of owning crude oil for future delivery so the futures price may be slightly
below the expected future spot price), but the futures prices would be my best
guess for where the market thinks oil is going.

Hi Paul - I bought some ALD today and noticed from previous posts that you also
own some shares in this company. What's your opinion of management? Do they
manage their loan loss risk in a prudent manner?

ALD serves a need but from my view they are the lender of last resort. Their
combined portfolio of loans return around 12% to 14% but I was unclear as to
what they set aside for loan losses (ie loan loss reserve account) and if they
were conservative in their estimates.

I also noted that they continue to take large quarterly charges for
depreciation expenses but was not sure what type of assets they were
depreciating.

Any opinion on this company would be helpful as my buy was based on current
valuation, dividend yield which is covered by earnings (which is safe IMO) and
their overall portfolio coverage (they recently purchased a company that
finances capital asset lease back programs for small business which is very
profitable!).

If the economy continues to muddle through and grows slowly with a positive
bias, these "hard money" type of loans should continue to payoff with a low
default rate. The key is if management can avoid any land mines from sour
loans. This can only be accomplished by a seasoned management team that has a
proven track record with internal procedures that nip potential bad loans
quickly.

ALD. A controversial company. Several shrewd investors have studied it and have
bought. Others have said it's a Ponzi operation, and consequently there's a
good-size short position on ALD. For still others, the complexity of the
underlying assets and structure of ALD's deals are not clear enough to them to
warrant making a decision. (A no-decision. Which means pass on it.)

I'm one who places weight on the company's multi-decades of very excellent
performance (capital gains from the stock - calculating with dividends
reinvested.) The belief among the vocal short community is that ALD must
continually offer shares to raise funds to pay high dividends, because the
dividends they do pay aren't sufficient or consistent enough to come from net
operating income (NOI). I don't see management trying to extricate themselves
from the shares they own though, and there's even some insider buying near
current levels. Yahoo message boards can provide more detail and maybe better
insight regarding the pro vs. con argument.

This stock's been mentioned here several times. (Grommit -or others - could you
weigh in with an opinion that might help?) It seems to me some of the guys here
who do really detailed dd and/or who are value oriented have passed on it.
Perhaps one might infer from that that there may be more risk to the stock than
I suspect. One could also argue that the high dividend yield itself suggests
the riskiness that might exist. Nevertheless, I have a full position in the
stock, and I'm holding shares in an IRA and a regular account.

I like the Business Development Companies in general, and I've also got a very
full position in ACAS and a lesser one in MCGC. Fwiw, I got some good feed back
here on another BDC, AINV, a company that recently became public and is now
looking to invest the cash it's received. I decided not to wait to see what
management did, and I sold my few exploratory shares.

Hope this helps.

I plan to hedge my new position with covered calls but I did like their recent
purchase of Financial Pacific Company (they paid $94 million for the business).
These capital lease back loans can be very profitable w/ fees and interest
charges. Although there is the pending SEC probe on their Business Loan Express
transaction. I think management has addressed it appropriately. The main
negative I see is that some of their loans are not asset based but merely
bridge loans. This is the nature of their business and these types of loans as
a percentage of their total are falling.

Did you see where Citi Corp announced another bank acquisition?..."Citigroup
Acquiring First American Bank of Bryan, Texas to Expand Retail Banking
Operations" (http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/040824/citigroup_first_american_9.html)

My one best pick for next year is NYB. There is talk that Wells Fargo and Citi
Corp are interested. My target is $27 and I continue to accumulate shares that
I plan to hold for 18 to 24 months. A successful "value" investor buys a
company that eventually a larger company discovers. I buy a company based on
the intrinsic value not because of a potential buy out. However, if a buy out
does occur, you know you have done your homework correctly.

I will have to check into ACAS, MCGC,BDC and AINV.

Thank you again for your input.

Covered calls to hedge ALD,

Selling covered calls on ALD make be a good, profitable strategy, but I'm not
sure whether it hedges you well in this instance. If the short sellers are
right about Ponzi schemes or financial irregularity, you would lose a lot of
money on the long side, far outstripping the premium you make from selling the
call.

By the way, I don't know whether the stock is a buy or a sell or whether
selling covered calls on this is good or bad. Just making a general comment on

IPG is poorly managed and overly diversified (e.g. their "ill-fated" entry into
the auto racing business being the most egregious). Those issues are what's
hurt the company.

IPG is a substantial company - 43,000 employees. I don't see revenue growth,
but still, there's $15 now in revenue behind every share. Given that the ad
business is cyclical, and this year brings the Olympics and Nov. election, next
year may be worse for IPG (business and stock) than this year.

My bet is that the stock might be expected to drop again to a point or two
under $10, but since the problems with IPG seem to be all publicly known now,
and there's a turnaround plan presumably in place and being executed, I can bet
small that the stock might recover again to $15 or better within 12-18 months -
if the market doesn't crash.

From:- with a K
WM Story from LA Times:

What went wrong with WaMu? Start with strategy

By E. Scott Reckard
Los Angeles Times

For Washington Mutual, the glory days of growth and acquisitions have given way
to layoffs and lowered expectations.

The Seattle-based savings and loan, which became the nation's largest after
swallowing other major thrifts, is completing 13,450 job cuts, closing 100
mortgage offices and shuttering all 53 of its commercial-banking branches.

WaMu reported zero income from home loans in the second quarter, compared with
$611 million last year. Overall profit was down 49 percent. And its share price
has dropped 11 percent since the end of May, closing Friday at $38.80 on the
New York Stock Exchange.

What went wrong? A national decline in mortgage lending, a business in which
WaMu is No. 2 behind Wells Fargo, is partly to blame. But at Wells Fargo and
Countrywide Financial, the third big home lender, second-quarter profit still
managed to rise.

Industry analysts point to a series of management missteps, including:

• Too-rapid expansion in the last decade, including the takeovers of
California's American Savings, Great Western Bank and Home Savings, plus four
mortgage companies, that kept WaMu from smoothly integrating disparate
accounting systems.

• Botched use of financial hedges, investments that were supposed to offset the
risk of servicing its $7.5 billion in mortgages.

• Trouble fixing billing errors, misplaced loan payments and other banking
foul-ups, leading to an unusually heavy volume of complaints for a major bank,
especially one that boasts of in-branch service. The Better Business Bureau of
the Southland, in Southern California, rates WaMu as "unsatisfactory" in
business performance.

The stock's come down from recent highs, and given the company's good revenue

I'll bet that being lumped in that sector has incorrectly tarred ALV. Per

Spekulatius, Grommit, others who might be interested in trucking stocks: Fwiw,
I decided to step up for a just a very few shares of HTLD today. To me, it
seems the clear top-performer in the truckload sector (as measured by ROIC and
avg. annual stock return).

I don't like paying for the high p/sales and high p/book that I see. OTOH, it
might be worth it when stacked against the company's very good (imo) ROA,
revenue growth, and profit margins. One normally presumes (okay, well I do
anyway)that the trucking business is highly-competitive with low barriers to
entry, and consequently not very profitable. The profit margins for Heartland
though haven't been below 10% since 1995. And sales have grown about 10% on
average over the last five years.

Here are some positives from the latest quarterly:

"The Company ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and
investments of $229.1 million, a $26.7 million increase from the $202.4 million
reported on December 31, 2003. The Company's balance sheet continues to be
debt-free. The Company opened its newly acquired (December, 2003) Carlisle,
Pennsylvania facility in June, 2004. This location is much larger than the
previously leased facility and will provide a solid base of operations in the
Northeast."

To me, if one is going to invest in the sector, one ought to consider HTLD.
Maybe the price isn't quite in bargain territory, but otoh, trucker HTLD
delivers results better than some growth stocks I own. (Which might not be
saying much, but it's enough to get me to purchase a few HTLD shares today)

SHRP. The negatives are the insider sales and machinations by that key
insider/his family. An issue is whether their best seller - Ionic Breeze - is a
sham or maybe already has saturated the market. Also, same-store sales, a very
signifcant indicator for these retailers was down in August.

SHRP has a unit devoted to coming up with new products. They've been successful
in past, and I suspect they will have additional successes (not as good as the
huge Ionic Breeze though). At a p/sales of .39 and a profit margin of 3.7%, I
expect that to be reasonable compared to past years. I could be anchoring
poorly though. Similarly, although I now value SHRP as undervalued up to
$23/share (lower than my last $28 adds in June and July)based upon SHRP's
current ROE, that valuation figure could drop if earnings decrease. I am hoping
a 16% overall gain in sales this quarter will help translate into okay earnings
this year and next, although I suspect quarter-to-quarter (year over year) same
store sales comparisons may be difficult.

All that aside, you could be right that I'm anchoring incorrectly with this
stock. I still have some shares bought in '01; I bought and sold some in '02
and sold more late '03. As the stock has come down I added a bit, and now again
10 points lower. Possibly the stock will drop yet another 10 points; I am
hoping gas prices will not have that dramatic effect on retail sales.

SDS's had good revenue growth and now has a relatively (compared to past years)
low psr. It also displays a relatively low forward p/e (Yahoo estimate). ROE
not so great; ROA is okay imo. There've been some recent acquisitions. Perhaps
they'll work out okay, maybe not. Profit margins have dropped to a tad under
12% from the high 12's of the past few years. That's not so good. Still, given
where the other metrics are for SDS, I say profit margins trump - ~12% makes
the stock a buy for me at current price.

I'll take a few shares.

SDS appears to be interesting. About two months ago, I read a few reports by a

re SDS - I agree that SDS looks attractive. Valuation is reasonable on forward
earnings. The company has a nice growth record and so far acquisitions seem to
work out. SunGards products are sticky and the high switching costs give the
company a "moat". The chart looks like it's bottoming out and may be ready to
head higher. I'll put it on my watchlist.

that if the market bottom is close at hand it would be unique from a historical

On averaging down. As I say, it's best to have a plan in order to react to
unforeseen events.

A harder way of looking at it is, if a person's XYZ stock drops, he/she has
only two choice categories - sell all or sell some, or buy more. Remaining
unchanged and transfixed for months/years is NOT an option. Essentially, you
admit you're wrong and move on or believe you could be wrong and partial sell
until you confirm, or else you reconfirm your initial reasonings and thus buy
more.

If a person only has one stock and averages down on it, that becomes
exceedingly dangerous. (As the stock gods showed Dr. P.) One "ought" to have
many stocks and average down on several where there's some support that the
ruling reasons for buying are still valid. In that way, when one is wrong (and
one pays the price with a large, unrecoverable loss), the losses are made up
for (I so hope) by the times when one reaps the outsize gains from increasing
positions in the other stocks which subsequently recovered.

But of course, that's all jmo. And I certainly could be very wrong - especially
if the entire market falls and doesn't recover or recovers slowly only over
several years or decades.

Also, since I very much like normative approaches - i.e. what "should" be done,
perhaps this leads me here to an opinion which is either too simplistic or too
absolute (in addition to maybe also being wrong -g-)

3 of them are biotechs, 2 of which have-Maxy and catg have agreements with

is majority owned by liberty and has products which will be in demand over the

good that optv will either become profitable or be bought by the parent company
for a premium. Maxy is sitting on tons of cash as they have sold one of their
subs for $64MM to Dupont i believe. Both Maxy and Catg have proven to me that
they have a business. Certainly either could squander their cash on an
unsuccessful trials. The jury is out on optv and xnva. however should either of
them start generating profits they will likely sell for multiples of what they
are selling for now. maxy and catg at the moment are easily my largest
holdings. Also I note that your comment about the insider selling on MAXY is
misleading- there is a smidgeon of automatic selling by one director, there is

Thanks for the update on IIG. I've corrected for that and also reduced HLSH to
1 share in the couble portfolio as a placeholder. The total cost vs. value has
always been off a bit because I can't get a quote for HLSH on SI. These changes
show the porfolio now with a loss of 1.6 % ytd. If SI had a quote on HLSH, it
would be up couple hundred also - making the portfolio pretty close to even on
the year. BTW, I've only ever updated the safe portfolio for ACAS dividends -
certainly the overall return should be a little higher than shown.

As for Madharry's comment: at some point, I decided (with a little feedback
from the board) to just track the stocks without making portfolio changes.
Certainly, one could have made excellent trading profits in a lot of the double
stocks as many were up 50 % to 100 % (and some of use did successfully book
some of those profits). My conclusion if the double goal was to identify
low-price stocks that might have the possibility of outsized short-term trading
gains, we were successful. Maybe purely by accident - maybe we could
collectively do it again. If the goal was to identify such outrageous values
that the market would eventually appreciate such stocks in the long (or at
least intermediate) term, we're struggling.

RAD. My last add was $5.58, 3/3/04, so I don't look so good if you go by that.

If RAD is down because of "mandatory mail-order prescription refill programs"
as they (RAD) say, then we've got a problem because the business model has
shifted (imo). The extent of this and whether or not RAD can adapt (if this
situation does exist and if RAD fully recognize it), is questionable (for me)
at this point. OTOH, Motley Fool says Walgreen and perhaps CVS will/are
reporting much better than Rite Aid, "the tortoise in the bunch". If so, that's
good news - to me anyway - because I am just looking for RAD -the number three
in the sector - to eventually get its fair share of the business. To the extent
that WAG and CVX are doing okay and might continue to do so, means -to me- that
RAD might also have good quarters ahead of it. In which case I might add more
shares. But back on that other hand, the more that "customers" are forced by
their insurance carriers to purchase mail order, the stiffer the consequence
for the brick retailers/prescription fillers like RAD. In which case, maybe all
the companies - WAG,etc. - are too richly valued.

For now, I've no strong opinion, so I figure I'll just hold my RAD position.

Late reply:

"I am just concerned when a stock drops as much as this and one is adding for a
third time."

I have no opinion on SHRP, but I have a comment on your comment. :) I have
added to stocks that dropped more percentage-wise than SHRP. Actually, now I
usually (note: "usually" :))) add every time stock drops to 0.75-0.8 of my last
purchase price. Of course, I have to be sure that there are no issues with the
company and its future to do that. If I discover such issues, I sell
immediately even at a loss.

Note that I only invest in companies with high ROE possibly temporarily (!?!?)
fallen on tough times. I don't usually buy high D/E companies losing money, so
except for fraud or total company collapse, I am somewhat protected from the
worst outcome.

How has this worked? Fine for me, although I have sold some companies at a loss
for issues that did not come to roost. I also got some good positions in stocks
that were hated for no reason. ARMHY is probably the biggest success story.

You pay your money and you make your choices. :)

I don't invest for trading, but if Mr. Market gives 50-100% gains in couple of
months and I believe the stock is fairly valued or overvalued, I will take
them. So I don't see a problem if something I invest in goes up significantly

I think KO is a reasonable buy here, although even with a drop it is as

>=25% ROE going forward, which is a high hurdle, though possible for KO/PEP.

Hi Paul Senior - Did you notice the $677 million offer for SJH
(http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SJH) today. This is another oil tanker shipper.

From the article:"...Stelmar, which operates 41 oil tankers, said the
$38.55-a-share purchase price represents a 55 percent premium over the share
closing price on May 14, the last trading day before tanker owner and operator
OMI Corp. of Stamford, Conn., announced it was seeking to merge with
Stelmar...."

I bought more SFL today as they have a PE of around 5 where SJH's PE is now
around 12.

It's possible there may be other bidders for SJH's assets. SFL traded at a new
all time high today on double than normal volume. SFL should be a $40 stock if
valued similar to SJH. I think part of the reason for SFL's low price is that
it is still an undiscovered stock. I have been trying to identify all the
negatives (or hidden land mines) in the SFL balance sheet and have yet to
discover anything significant.

Have you in your due diligence uncovered any items for SFL that justify such a
low stock price?

SFL appears to be extremely undervalued even at today's all time high.

Eric Strohmeyer: Saw the offer, but have not looked closely at it or the
implications for SFL. SFL is more difficult for me to figure than other tanker
stocks because of its relationship to controlling stockholder FRO.

It seems to me that tanker stocks historically have sold at low multiplies
(when they've had earnings).

I'm holding my tanker shares but I'm wary because of the move these stocks
already have had.

Perhaps you are right though that the SJH offer indicates that it might be a
good bet to add to SFL (or FRO) positions. I will consider this.

Added a few more NSRGY as it hit my limit while i was out on vacation. Mostly
bad new from consumer goods company (see CL and Unilever) seem to have dragged
down Nestle stock as well. PE should be around 13 at current stock price of
57.5$, which is a bargin considering in the stellar balance sheet and the
strong FCF.

re SPW - earnings look relatively strong but FCF is weak/non existant, yet the
SPW's management touts strong free cash flow around 350-400M$/year. For me the
numbers don't add up - I would not invest in SPW.

I know UTSI has been discussed here. Seems like the floor keeps getting pushed
lower and lower. They keep dripping out bad news. Don't own it, just interested
in opinions.

Re: SPW. You might want to go back to the Barron's article of 2 or 3 weeks ago.
A multi-faceted criticism that should keep everyone but an insider away.

Bought more CL today at 46.55, although the stock still appears in free fall.

re: SPW. Godfrey Daniel! That is one heck of a negative article! 

I agree w/you. I've got no business being in that stock. Sold my few shares.

Thanks. (Thanks also, Spekulatius)
