Too early Sat am. bs.: INT vs. QCOM. Absolutely everybody must be talking about
the popular stock International Fuels. Not too many (value investors)likely
know about Qualcom though. Here's an update of my 12/28 post (#9463), wherein
is I suggested I would probably have to go with the crowd on INT, although my
heart was with QCOM. After all, an analyst had just predicted a 12 mo. stock
target of 1000 (QCOM was up strongly @ 660 when I wrote). So a month later
(after QCOM's split), we have:

INT: my last purchase 12/30 at my high buy price-- 7.1875; close now-- 8.6875.
Just a measly 1 1/2 point rise there. (But it is a 20% paper gain.)

QCOM (split adj), then-- 12/28 165; close now-- 110.56. A drop of 55 points
translates to almost exactly a drop of 1/3 in price.

So far - and given that it's all on paper and subject to change and being early
Sat . am, -- the INT bulls were right! INT beats QCOM. Good thing I followed
the crowd and bought INT. GO INT!

I probably need to get some more sleep Paul.

Meanwhile, is there a better defensive position than MO? Dividend >9% with and

Armin, I am waiting for the dividend cut on SNH. That may create the bottom. If
the bottom is now on "sell on the rumor, buy on the news", that's the breaks.

I also like CMH, but am waiting as well. The homebuilders like CTX are making
new lows and FLE has been clocked recently. I am just guessing that we may have
a capitulation decline of a couple more points on CMH to go, perhaps after they
have reported a quarterly decline in earnings.

I share your general view on tech stocks, and haven't sold much of low cost
smaller company positions I have held for years. I still can see sufficiently
more upside in ones I own not to trade a long term tax position for a short
term one in something else after a correction. Furthermore, I regard technology
as the place to concentrate on for long term investment, so long as you avoid
ludicrous valuations.

Jim mentioned Proctor and Gamble recently as saying they could not justify a 35
multiple. In my opinion, there are a lot of well positioned technology
companies where that kind of statement does not apply. For example, I mentioned
semiconductor distributor SEMI a couple of times here at $3+. Even though it
does not produce proprietary products it benefits from good times in the
semiconductor industry. At $7 7/8 it has recovered to a bit above book value.
However, I saw no reason to sell it last week at $10 as I expect them to report
a 50 cent quarter sometime in 2000 and the stock reach $15-20.

Help!! How would those of you with good accounting skills attack the problem of
evaluating inacom(ico).
1) 8K on Edgar has section on adjustment of 360 million CPQ cash offer, but
possible impact is hard for me to determine. ICO cannot use goodwill or
intangibles to establish asset value. Since most of their shareholder equity is
goodwill(316 out of 441 million) I do not see how they are going to justify the
asset sale at the full 360 million.
2)In any case if the 360 million is any where near the amount which will be
realized this 230 million market cap company should come out of the proposed
deal with a pretty pristine balance sheet since most of the vanstar acquisition
of goodwill should disappear. Is that right?
3. Remaining company will have the assets relative to service niche which got
everyone excited about company last year.
4) Hooray, the board dumped Fairfield, the CEO who couldn't stand the street
evaluating his company at only 15 dollars last year. The new management seems
intent on redirecting the company into service niche.
5)Shouldnt we be willing to pay more than 4 7/8 for a company which will
benefit from close tie with cpq and which will probably have p/b less than 1
and which also is in an excellent market niche.

I agree that MO belongs in a diversified value portfolio (If I had to lay out a
portfolio of 20 stocks, MO would be one of them). I wouldn't make a
concentrated bet on it though. Somewhere in Ben Graham's original Security
Analysis he singles out legal problems as something investors nearly always
overreact to, and where you should take the other side. Philip Morris is one of
my favorite companies in the world - I used to love to trade the shares up and
down with litigation. And I've been too scared to buy it (good thing too,
because I almost pulled the trigger at 28). That might tell you this is a
screaming contrarian opportunity, if you have the guts.

I had the good fortune to spend some time with a former big-time Fidelity
portfolio manager, who I will not name, about a month ago. One of his two best
ideas was the long term calls (LEAPS) at 25 strike on MO. You might want to
look into whether that might be a better deal than buying the stock outright.
The risk/reward might have changed since then.

I would guess a number of investors are waiting to buy SNH on the news of a
dividend cut. Thus I think you are right that makes the bottom. But if I have
the chance to steal shares what I think is a 18% stabilized yield (i.e. after
the cut), I'm not going to get too cute with my thinking. I've done the
analysis of the fundamentals, and I have more faith in that analysis than in my
analysis of how the stock will trade, though I suspect that would be a sound
strategy. Like I said before, what I like about this one (the difference
between SNH and CMH) is the dividend. If the stock bottoms at 8, I really don't
worry about that as long as my fundamental case holds. Because I'm collecting a
huge dividend while I wait for the market to sort things out. If CMH falls to
6, I don't worry too much either, but I have no dividend to compensate me for
the time the stock takes to stabilize. Part of me would like nothing better
than waking up someday with cash in my account and seeing CMH at 6 and SNH at
8. And I do not consider that far-fetched in a significant market downturn.

Jim, the one thing Graham could not know when he wrote about overreaction to
legal problems is that we would end up with a society willing to bankrupt
entire industries over real and imagined problems, and real and imagined
contributions to those problems. Asbestos and breast implants come to mind.

Speaking as someone trained to evaluate risk, I would not touch MO with a 10
foot pole. That is because, in my opinion, one can not assess/guess the
probability of bankruptcy, or even less horrible outcomes. Therefore, you can't
have any idea whether the current price adequately discounts it or not. I buy
stocks all the time where I can conceive of circumstances where the company
goes bankrupt AND based on experience feel comfortable assigning a probabilty
to that risk, and that the price adequately discounts it (GDC, for example). I
can't do that with MO. (By the way, I learned this lesson up close and
personal, many years ago, with an investment in Eagle Picher, which at the time
was a solid company, down, cheap, but not out from asbestos involvement --
yet.)

I would like to suggest that the good numbers we've seen coming out of airlines
represent an anomaly due, in part, to exceptional domestic demand coupled with
abnormally low fuel costs. The two are related. The marginal pool of flyers
contracts when rates increase as airlines pass on higher fuel costs to
customers.

At the extreme ends of fuel costs, I view airlines as cyclicals who lag and
move inversely to oil prices. MAIR, as noted, may be able to tolerate higher
fuel costs better than most. But all will see margins hurt and growth slowed if
oil sustains it's current price. FWIW, I don't think it will and am investing
as if oil will hover around $20-24. When it does, I will re-evaluate airlines
and then think about a purchase during the first full quarter of lower fuel
costs.

In any case, ng seems the better of the two long term.

I'm adding more AVS to my position again today. I particularly like the MRO
aspect (maintenance/repair/overhaul),since I figure that's a function of either
air miles flown or number takeoffs & landings. And which I assume is mandated

Arch. There's a lot in your post -g-.

1."The marginal pool of flyers contracts when rates increase as airlines pass
on higher fuel costs to customers." I don't believe these marginals who are so
price conscious that they won't fly if price if too expensive are necessary for
bottom line performance. If so, Priceline etc. offer a possibility that if
people are flexible, they can get very good prices still. (Assuming the
marginal flyer pool has access to computer, appropriate computer skills.) Maybe
Priceline increases the size of that marginal pool.

2. I say price of airline stocks already reflects oil price increase. I have no
facts to support my opinions. My other opinion is that by the time oil prices
come down (if they do), the airline stocks will have made their move.

3. I don't know about "exceptional domestic demand". I have anecdotal
indications that more international travel is taking place. Immigrants in the
US returning to visit relatives. Higher standard of living overseas letting
foreigners visit us on their vacations.

4. Switching to ng. Maybe so. Looked at a couple of co's that distribute gas
through their pipeline systems, but stock price too high for me. The link you
provided was good -- but a long presentation! Sponsored by a French e&p company
specializing(?) in deep-drilling offshore gas. About which they said of natural
gas, it would be in long term growth. No surprise there.

Something about French logic -- I forget who the guy is they emulate -- but
it's different from the way we Americans present our logic (and I forget who we

developing assumptions and steps and finally delivering the conclusion. What I

Another way to play the ng story is through a ng trust. Some boast 10-12%

is limited to very low risk, generally long lived reserves. I have no

that MO employs thousands of people all through the US and is linked with the
US Gov't who supports tobacco farmers. Plus MO may be the largest individual
taxpayer (fed+state+excise). They have tremendous pricing power still, and just
put through another increase. There is a demand for the product. Would be
foolish for the gov't to kill this goose, imo. On the other hand, the legal

Armin,

Regarding why MO is not spinning off their food business to shareholders....

For arguments about the implication of this type of corporate restructuring
take a look at the proxies filled regarding RJR's spin-off of Nabisco (NGH) in
spring of '99.

Carl Icahn proposed the spin off of Nabisco shares in opposition to the
board-proposed plan of spinning off domestic tobacco and (as far as I can see)
leaving some litigation risk with NGH (a holding company for Nabisco shares).
Clearly spinning off NA would give shareholders the food business without the
implied litigation risk (as you propose wih MO) - this would clearly improve
the valuation (tobacco with litigation risk, food without).

IMO, the primary reasons the board recommended rejecting the Icahn plan were:

1. There might be a time-consuming (the board said years) litigation necessary
to defend the position that the tobacco company could pay for all potential
litigation cost.

2. Such a separation might expose the board and potentially shareholders to
litigation because the separation would constitute a fradulent conveyance (my
rough translation - the board and shareholders hide assets from litigators).

As a result, I think until such time as the potential litigation costs become
clearer, you will not get a true 'litigation-free' food spin-off, though, you
might get a separation similar to RJR (tobacco separate from food, with
litigation risk attached to both stocks).

Stew

NGH owns 80% of Nabisco plus (actually this would be a minus) tobacco liability
if RJR goes underwater. You can buy NGH for less than 50% of the value of the
underlying value of Nabisco shares, and Nabisco itself is arguably undervalued.
Check me on those numbers - I just did a quick look at the financials. 6%
yield.

This is a double contrarian - you get a contrarian bet on tobacco and a
contrarian bet on a very out of favor food group at the same time. One step
removed from bankruptcy. Though one must remember that several companies two
steps removed from asbestos went bankrupt in the end.

Would appreciate comments. The financials for NGH look very simple. Quantifying
the risk is not at all simple, though.

re: big tobacco going bankrupt
New York state and several other states are selling bonds based on the revenues
from their tobacco settlements. If the companies file for bankruptcy, those
bonds are toast. It would be very interesting to know whether those bonds trade
at a lower yield than Philip Morris stock - I would bet its close, but I will
try to look it up at work tomorrow. If my hunch is the case, what a wonderful
long-short trade that would be, to isolate the entire upside of Philip Morris
for free. I'll get back to you on this.

The fact that they sold these bonds tells me Philip Morris is not going
bankrupt. Let alone the tax revenues, which are getting simply obscene in my
opinion (I'm paying them). The government has too much of a stake in them
prospering to put them out of business.

The risk of downside in Philip Morris is that the government is collossally

Alcohol and sugar, not the best comparisons. Alcohol in moderation actually has
a beneficial effect wrt health, i.e., lowering of cholestoral. Sugar exists
naturally in nearly all the foods we eat, fruits, vegtables, etc. and in an of
itself is not harmful to health to the general populace.

The quality of "natural" is irrelevant. Arsenic and hemlock are natural but no
reasonable person would accept them as additives for food products. Lead,
another natural ingredient has been banned from paints and water pipes and
there is no rise of objection from any sector of society that I know of.

Tobacco use on the other hand is harmful to health, period. Whether it's use is
in "moderation"; it's been shown to be harmful to the health of secondary
users, i.e., non-smoking bystanders that inhale the airborne smoke over a
period of time.

I'll offer a different question...Does society [governement] have the authority
to ban the use of poisons for human consumption?

It's hard to find a true comparison, as they have full service and discount

Did a quick screen of SWS vs. SCH, NITE, MER, RJF, AGE. On a P/BV basis, it's
lower than all at 1.2 times (it's about 2 times if you back out the NITE
holdings, still only slightly higher than AGE and RJF, which I'd guess you
refer to as super-regionals). Growth, per Yahoo, is projected to be at 15% over
the next 5 years. With limited analyst coverage, and the last earnings report
being what it was, I would think the company could match or exceed the growth
rate of a NITE or SCH, which are projected to be 25% and 22%, respectively.
These two trade at much higher multiples than SWS.
So that's my thesis for the value in SWS. One could be disillusioned with

On my watch list (do not own) are home related/interest sensitive CTX and CMH.

Tobacco/state bonds....

I disagree with your statement that the government has substantial risk
associated with letting any tobacco company going bankrupt.

If MO and other U.S. companies go bankrupt clearly someone still supplies
tobacco products to the consumer. The states would just slap on the same tariff
on those suppliers that, effectively, they had MO do for them onto tobacco
products as a result of the tobacco settlements. So I don't see government as
being particularly stupid if they allow MO to fail. They have only a minor
financial stake in this (e.g., difference in dealing with foreign companies vs.
U.S.-based MO, increased potential for a black market, and perhaps some
temporary disruption in supply/tax collection). But in the end, they will
extract their tax from tobacco.

What is clear is that they have taken a legal road to tariff the consumer as
opposed to a legislative one. As a governor it's probably better to say your AG
taxed the tobacco consumer as opposed to you doing it directly.

What would be very interesting to consider is if somewhat developed a
'health-risk' free tobacco replacement. I'm sure the government would try to
tax this like tobacco.

Stew

I agree that big tabacco is everybody's favorite whipping boy, and we're

Perhaps we're getting off of the investment topic and onto the moral issues of
self-destruction and ones right to it, however, since it tends to affect the
investment, I suppose there's some merit to its discussion...

Alcohol, which I'll agree whole-heartedly, is addictive and detrimental to
one's health when consumed irresponsibly, can have positive effects such as
decreasing one's risks of heart disease and cancer. The big problem with
tobacco, and therefore Philip Morris and the industry at large, is the fact
that they chemically altered their product to INCREASE its addictive properties
knowing full well that the product was harmful at ANY dose to both primary and
secondary users. All ethical consideration aside, the legal liability that such
action involves is extremely dangerous to the company's profitability, general
existence, and ultimately to shareholders.

My point in all this, is that I don't view MO as much of a value play. At the
very most I would call it a speculative gamble. If you're up for a gamble and
have no problem with the ethics of the industry, I suppose it offers some
possibility for capital appreciation. I, however, would rather put my
speculative investment capital into a pioneering tech or biotech company with
the potential not only to grow profits exponentially, but to also BENEFIT
society.

Oakley (OO) is also at lows which indicates an industry problem (probably the

In my opinion, the stock may go lower ($5), is not in a very attractive

I'm taking a position in Houston Exploration Company (THX). In some ways it
fits, imo, the classic Ben Graham definition of an investment operation.

THX is trading about 17 1/2- 17 3/4. The majority owner (64%) is seeking bids
to sell the company. They are looking for bids of $24 to $27 per share. If they
are successful in getting a buyer, my guess would be the price gap will close
somewhat. (THX stock price will move up on the news.). For stockholders to get
the full buyout price- that will take some time - maybe as much as 6 mo. or
possibly even 1 yr (regulatory/gov't approvals). But I'm not sure of this, and
so the timeframe might be shorter. Still, with patience the rough return would
be 6 points (or more) on an 18 dollar stock for a 33% gain.

If no deal is forthcoming, I figure the risk is time value of money. THX is now
announcing gas finds, "positive reserve replacements", improved earnings. The
stock has generally traded at 17 or better in the past 2 years, so I don't see
a large downside risk (from 17 3/4) if no buyers are forthcoming. If there's no
deal, investors should be able to "eventually" unwind their positions with
little capital loss, maybe even a little gain.

Just my analysis, and I've been wrong many, many times before.

The catalyst for Mattel may be in the works.

Mattel board to meet Thurs. to decide CEO's fate
By Sarah Tippit

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 3 (Reuters) - The board of embattled toy giant Mattel Inc
(NYSE:MAT - news). will hold an emergency meeting Thursday in New York to
discuss the fate of
Chief Executive Jill Barad, who may be pressured to step down after a series of
disappointing quarters,
a source inside the company told Reuters late Wednesday.

Mattel, the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels, is expected to report fourth
quarter earnings next Tuesday
most likely below Wall Street's expectations, the source said. A shortfall,
which would mark the
company's third disappointing quarter in a row, could spell the end of Barad's
two-year rule over the
company.

The Mattel source said a likely Barad successor -- whose name has been widely
circulated within Mattel
over the last few days -- is 41-year-old Matt Bousquette, a rising star who is
in charge of the boys' toy
and entertainment division. Bousquette, who works at the company's El Segundo,
California
headquarters, has been with Mattel about eight years and rose quickly through
the ranks of senior
management, the source said.

Meanwhile on Thursday the Wall Street Journal reported that Mattel had sought
help from a search firm
to fill its chief operating officer position, vacated by Bruce Stein who left
last year.

The Journal quoted a source familiar with the search as saying that Mattel had
made it clear the spot
could become a chief executive officer assignment.

One of the country's most prominent woman executives, who joined Mattel in 1981
as a $38,000-a-year
product manager and eventually rose to CEO in 1997, Barad has been under fire
for months ever since
Mattel's $3.5 billion acquisition of The Learning Co., last year went sour.

The unit, maker of educational and entertainment software programs, CD-ROMs and
interactive games
such as ``Sesame Street,' ``Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?' and ``Myst'
had been touted as a
way to help stem sales declines in Barbie dolls and other traditional toys.

Rather than stellar 30 percent sales growth and 20 percent margins that were
expected, the unit produced
a disastrous and unexpected loss of $105 million in the third quarter as
software was returned by
distributors and the unit lost a major licensing agreement.

Last October Barad, amid calls for her ouster by angry shareholders and
investors, blamed the losses on
discrepancies not uncovered during due diligence. She assured the board that
problems would be
controlled and losses stemmed.

Last month, Mattel's chief financial officer, Harry Pearce, said he would
retire in March, becoming the
third senior executive to leave Mattel since its problems became apparent in
October. Analysts said that
senior management positions were unlikely to be filled until the fate of Barad
was decided.

Last Tuesday, senior executives flew to New York for the start of a series of
emergency meetings, the
Mattel source said. Thursday's meeting is expected to include discussion of the
fate of Barad's position
at the helm of the company, the source said.

``It wouldn't surprise me if they said they needed some fresh leadership,' said
Collins & Co. analyst
Bruce Raabe. He said the timing would be right to make a management change
announcement in
conjunction with fourth quarter earnings reports. ``Investors aren't happy,' he
said. ``Certainly they
haven't been able to convince financial markets they are doing better. The
Learning Co. purchase is
being questioned altogether. People are saying the price paid was excessive. I
don't know how you fix
that company.'

It was unclear whether a management change would occur immediately but after
plummeting from a
high of $46 to just above $10 the stock on Wednesday rose 13 percent as rumors
circulated on Wall
Street and the Internet as to Barad's fate. At the close of trading Wednesday
the stock was up $1-7/16 at
$11-3/4.

A Mattel spokesman declined to comment Wednesday afternoon.

Mattel is expected to present a new line of toys at the annual toy fair in New
York City Feb. 12. It was
unclear whether Barad would be addressing investors at the fair.

Timberland seems like a totally undervalued company. They reported yesterday
and posted 1.38 versus a consensus estimate of $1.04. That is 53% EPS
growth. On the Conference Call management said that they would continue to grow
sales at double digit rates in the coming year. This company has beaten
estimates for 14 straight quarters. They also have $5 in cash.

During the quarter, they further reduced Accounts Recievables and Inventory and
increased Accounts Payables. This is a great company and an unbelievable value.

Armin,

I've recently been reluctant to suggest or invest in E&P's balanced toward oil
because of that very reason. The case for natural gas, from a value stance, is
far more compelling. Not only is there no cartel, there is no strategic ng
reserve. There are clear reasons why ng should and will be the hydrocarbon of
choice in the next decade. There are, I believe, environmental arguments that
ng should be priced at a premium to oil. Currently, on a BTU to BTU basis, ng
sells for a significant discount to oil.

While there is no counter argument to the idea that low cost producers (OPEC)
control oil prices by impacting marginal supply, there are very good arguments
that these nations desire oil to remain high. The primary argument is; A barrel
of oil sold from Arabia not only must pay for lifting, administrative, and oil
infrastructure costs, but it is also the primary revenue stream for these
governments. So while a US company can be profitable at, say $14 oil, an OPEC
nation may need or desire a higher price to finance its health care system,
maintain its infrastructure, and do all those things that our government does
through taxes. Simmons has calculated the price of oil necessary for economic
health in most OPEC nations to be around $20.

I've done OK recently by combining two strategies. In the first, I

worth looking at at a time when anything remotely connected with homebuilding

garden & pet supplies (of course), pet books, retail relationships, acquisition
developments, seeds (Pennington may have developed a potential blockbuster
virus-resistant grass seed). Also positive, as you mention, I see the large
insider buy by the CEO.

My belief is that the stock will recover as business picks up, which I believe
will occur. I hold a small amount of CENT within a diversified portfolio. I
don't know what you mean by "I am holding a significant position of CENT", but
THAT does sound risky to me.

JMO, and I've been wrong many, many times before.

Sold MAT @ 18%loss. I asked myself: Would I buy this if I didn't already own it
and came up with NO after reading reports from Merrill and SSB
SSB sums it: "While a turnaround at Mattel cannot be discounted, a depleted
management team, an undefined strategy, limited earnings visibility, a
difficult road ahead for TLC, and fluctuating international markets all pose
major CHALLENGES for the company"
The value in Mattel depends greatly on who they get, not just as CEO, but CEO,
COO, International manager as well as success of new COO for TLC. When Bob
Olstein bailed at 12 after riding it from 20's I shoulda gotta clue - there was
big ugliness coming.
My thinking is that as bad news and uncertainty continue to come out there are
going to 'buying opportunities' at significantly lower levels - I can see 7 or
8 within the next 6 months. SSB is taking estimates to .50-.60 for 2000 and
commented that MAT has traded as low as 9x earnings in tough times. On this
board, we've talked about a lot of stuff selling well below that. Mat has some
great brands, but this isn't a market that values brands and since toy brands
have to continue to be reinvented [Kids outgrow, new kids must be sold on
brand], management is critical.
I may jump back in as new info and/or lower prices alter the risk return to
more favorable levels, but it doesn't look like a hold for now.
Be well,
bob

Although I don't follow RBMG I'll offer my 0.02.

I wouldn't own an interest rate sensitive co. in this environment. The CRB is
up >16% since last Summer and I refuse to admit that we live in an economy
sheltered from commodity driven inflation. The government statistics we receive
about inflation are grossly wrong, IMO. The move in oil alone is enough to
spark an inflationary fire (not to mention heating oil and jet fuel), and
there's demand driven moves in base metals and lumber.

If you're a buyer or holder of RBMG or similar stocks you are arguing either
that - a) this stock is not sensitive to interest rate hikes or b) there will
be no further interest rate hikes. I don't see how one can confidently claim
either one of those. The only way out of it is to say that the current price
discounts another rate increase.

My recollection on Mattell when the subject first came up on this thread which
I think was a year ago or so it seems, that there was a wall street journal
about the CEO, and channel stuffing. I subsequently surfaced that there were
problems with the learning company acquisition. It would seem to me very
difficult to put a value on mattel until you can figure out the channel
stuffing and what went wrong with the learning company and is it worth anything
at all? Did the reports you got address these issues?

Armin: MAT - the broker reports didn't specifically discuss channel-stuffing,
but indicated considerable uncertainty going forward regarding TLC. MAT had
indicated last reporting period that it was pretty much in the rear view mirror
- clearly that was not the case. My sell reflected a combination of
uncertainties - not just TLC. Barad didn't get to be CB/CEO by being a control
buyer - she was put there by the board - this board. A leader will always have
strengths and weaknesses. As a marketing person, one would expect Barad to be
optimistic and enthusiastic about concepts and strategies - like buying TLC to
offset electronics invasion of traditional toy biz. It was up to the board to
rein in the enthusiasm and make sure DD was done and price was right. So they
not only 'Peter Principled' Barad to the level of incompetence, but failed to
recognize and offset her weaknesses and weakness of her purchase strategy.
These are the same Bozo's holders are hoping are going find a new Moses to lead
Mattel back to the Promised Land - color me skeptical.
I'm sure a big reason Mattel didn't totally collapse on the earnings news is
the near universal glee over Barad's departure. But I suspect she'll be missed
operationally within the company as she probably was top notch traditional
[especially dolls] toy marketer - too bad the board put her in a position
beyond her capabilities.
Beyond that Mattel is having problems with international business - not as
critical as leadership or TLC, but an additional challenge nonetheless.

Paul, Thank you for your message. I am holding over 10k shares of CENT
averaging around $8. Very few times in my investment history that I invest over
$100K on a single stock and planning to hold for long term capital gain.

I think CENT is a good value stock now. It will never go up as fast as a tech

Based on my "value investing" stock selections, the market is still favoring
the high-flying growth stocks and value investing is still dead. I.e., my

NASDAQ type stocks are going great guns.

Are you all seeing the same phenomenon with your portfolios?

Fred Andrews: Yes, you may see me in a number of areas because I like to keep a
diversified portfolio. And to my mind, the received wisdom that 10-15 or 20
stocks (or whatever number from whatever study one cites) in diversified
industries and areas is enough... well it is not enough to both reduce risk and
improve likelihood of profits (imo)

If you were one of the people who first mentioned here the idea of selling just
a portion, or withholding some back from a total sell, then thank you. (I do
recall Burgis B. in such a discussion.) That has proved to be very significant
advice and most helpful to me. And I'm still working on improving my sell
decisions. Stocks that I've posted on here before and that I sold profitably
but have moved up without me :>( include FIC, MIKE, ILFO, plus more. (Not to
mention the ones I sold unprofitably that then moved up.)

Sometimes I've taken profits as a stock has moved up and so there's not much
left (to hold back) when I make a final sell. Sometimes I just want the cash
for other investments; sometimes I just scare myself out of a stock. Sometimes,
I'm inflexible or unable to recognize when a value stock becomes a "growth
play". (VVTV bought about 3, sold at 6 if I recall, now at 42 down from high of
62 comes to mind. Here's a case where, had I been attuned to your advice and
sold a small amount initially instead of the entire position, the absolute
dollar gains from a small position might have been noticeable and noteworthy to
the portfolio's performance. I guess most of us have stories to tell like
that.)

And so about the very dumb saw, "you can't go broke taking a profit" that I
often hear. Bushwa, I say. I've learned you can (sometimes)lose a fortune
selling too soon for too little.

Selling -- always a tough decision. Paul.

Not your typical value play, but I am starting to look at a "boring" utility -
DTE.
More than a 6% yield, BV about $27, trading at the low end of its 52 W range.
The kicker: owns about 1/3 of PLUG (high flying alternative energy stock),
equating to about 10-11 bucks of DTE/share.
Funny thing is, at current prices, market caps of DTE and PLUG are almost
identical.

Gold rallying through a support level, the yield curve doing weird things, and

I'm very cautious about miners as protection against a severe correction. If
you must, bear in mind that fund families will cross fund boundaries if a
market correction triggers a liquidity crisis. ie, Au miners with even moderate
fund holding will get taken down right along with Mr .com in the event of a
severe correction.

Ag has a better chance of sustaining a rally than Au, IMO.

The handwriting is on the wall for utilities.

Generating and distributing electricity across wires for any distance is less
efficient than distributing a hydrogen source which can then be cleanly and
efficiently converted into electricity by fuel cells.

I wouldn't be surprised to see every utility in the country try to jump on the
fuel cell story in some way or another.

BTW, sources of H+ used in FC's are derived from natural gas.

I suspect that when PLUG cools off, DTE will soften. Currently the buyers of
DTE and the buyers of PLUG are on different planets - so don't expect the PLUG
mojo to rub off on DTE. This will change if PLUG proves itself through it's
products.

At some future point we will be better able to judge the merits of PLUG's
products vs. Ballard's and others. In 2-3 years there will be one or two clear
leaders in the field with a tight ring of patents around their products. Watch
the doors the auto industry is knocking on - currently that's Ballard.

As another plug for commodities, fuel cells require platinum for the basic
reactions. Much rarer than gold.

>>The handwriting is on the wall for utilities.<<

I will love to see these systems widely available because I live in rural
central PA and have access to 1 million cuft. of free gas per year.

We have been considering a fuel cell system for some time to reduce a
significant demand charge (30+% of our monthly bill) on our farm. Even in our
application the the fact that the battery pack will have to be replaced at 5-7
year intervals and the system may only last 20 years makes a purchase debatable
vs current electric cost.

Also after looking at the PLUG model system it doesn't seem efficient for
residential use unless there is a way to use the waste heat for heating or hot
water. And with residential users paying $5.00+/mcf. for fuel vs. $2.50/mcf. or
less for electric utilities, the power may be more dependable but when system
maintenance is factored in I would like to see how economical it is.

The THQI sale went on much longer than I expected due to a shorters convention
taking place in the stock aided by the media CNBC and The Street com, as well
as an unexpected large sale by shareholders who received shares in THQI in
exchange for the purchase of their company but I believe this is all behind the
stock now and it is poised to move forward, possibly quickly. This will be my
last post on the subject until it hits 30, which would be about a 27% increase
from todays levels. My one year target remains $62.50. As an aside today ORTL a
company I mentioned several times on these threads in the low and mid twenties
was purchased by Lucent for around $175. Needless to say I
sold out at lower levels.

I hate QQQ with a passion. I shorted a parabolic move, up something like 40% in
2 months, double in 12 months, about 100 times earnings. Seemed like a good
idea at the time.

Then the damned thing went up another 25 or 30% in another parabola. It
flattened out for a while but now is making new highs again.

This is gone beyond absurd - we have put a mania on top of a mania. This isn't
some small-cap overhyped stock, this is a diversified index that makes up about
25% of the market cap of the S&P 500.

Here's an article on fuel cells that you might find interesting.

http://www.motherearthnews.com/altenergy/altenergy176.cells.middle.html

Some quotes . . .

"...though a latecomer to the fuel cell field, stationary power systems will be
first to go commercial, as soon as January 2001. And while the initial units
will likely sell for $7,500 or more, that price is expected to quickly tumble
below $4,000 as manufacturers move into mass production."

"Acker predicts his company's fuel cell systems will see useful life spans of
15 to 20 years, or about what you'd expect to get from a typical home furnace."

"Ten or 15 years ago, we would have needed close to $10,000 worth of platinum
to make this device," says Acker. "Today, we need well under $100--and it has
absolutely nothing to do with the price of platinum."

"But what does using platinum, a nonrenewable resource, do to a fuel cell's
environmental score sheet? Acker notes that while platinum is not renewable, it
is recyclable. And since the platinum used in fuel cells is neither diminished
nor degraded, it can, at the end of a system's useful life, be retrieved and
used again."
