re: Buffett and "The only better way to beat inflation, he said, is when
individuals improve their earning power through further education and skills."
Until about age 50, most people are better off investing most of their
disposable time into their work skills/career instead of into investing. After
that, there's a tipping point where their portfolio is sufficiently large that
a marginal improvement over average market returns will offset what marginal
impact they might have gotten from work income. This is pretty simple to model
in Excel and I used it with my kids to show where their focus should be coming
out of school. However, I did encourage them to do a little investing in the
market now so when the time comes they've seen a variety of ups/downs/bubbles
with minimal exposure.

That was not true for Buffett and I think it is not going to be true for anyone
who is a good investor. If a person is interested in investing and is good at
it, they should put their time there as early as possible. Compounding is real
and if you have great returns early, compounding is supercharged.

On the other hand, if person is not a good investor or they don't like
investing, then they should not spend disposable time on investing even if they
are over 50. They should find a good fund or investment manager and let them do
the work.

that is easier said than done. if you have notions how to find an excellent
investment manager let me know. it would seem like the ones who are really good
will only do it for a short time . by then they have accumulated enough money
to just do it for themselves. I would guess that 90% of the investment managers
out there dont outperform the market over any length of time.
I dont think Mike Burry got a single reader of this thread to invest any money
in his fund. On top of that many of the good ones buy into illiquid investments
and you cant get out if you want or need to if there is a real market
correction. then you run the risk assuming its a hedgefund. that they drop
enough below the high water mark. that they just wrap that fund up and open a
new one up. if they have a personal account for you, then you dont know if they
are front running your stocks or not.

I have given this a fair amount of preliminary thought because if something
were to happen to me no one of my family is capable of managing my
investment/speculations.

Yes, that makes good sense to me, also.

If people would start out concentrating on their jobs, but saving in 401's with
funds and maybe company matches, it's the amazing affect compounding has:

From nothing, one day you notice your small ira made more money for the year
than what you got as a raise that year. Or maybe at some point you notice that
your portfolio for the year increased in value more than a promotion or bonus
got you for that year. The ira rewarded you more than your company.

A few more years of the same: The contributions to the portfolio have increased
-- the person has kept the percentage contribution the same (one hopes at the
max); the salary has increased so the dollar contributions have increased; the
ira portfolio itself has increased with the compounding effects of stock growth
and dividends.

... And now it starts to get interesting...

Reading the year-end portfolio statement, one day you realize that the
portfolio increased from beginning of year to end of year, more than what your
entire salary was for the year.

And maybe sometime later, perhaps a few years, you happen to notice in reading
your monthly 401 statement, that you made more money in one month in the ira,
than you will make from a whole year's salary.

...and if somebody were careful and consistent and maybe somewhat prudent and
lived in the right time, we get at least to the point you are making, Dan
Meleney, that the 50-60 year old person has a couple of decisions to make.
Because the daily changes in the ira portfolio can equal the person's salary!
1)Just stop looking at the daily changes in the ira portfolio, and just get on
with working and life, or maybe 2)to really consider if working is worth it
because "average market returns will offset what marginal impact they might
have gotten from work income."

All from just saving, getting average returns from stocks, and compounding it
all over several decades.

You are thinking about it wrong way.

Yes, it is hard to find a great investment manager if you want them to
consistently and considerably outperform the market.

However, a person (from your family), who is not interested in investing or is
bad investor will underperform market and funds much more.

You are choosing between a fund manager and your family member, not between a
fund manager and a great investor. :)

Here are two possible solutions:

1. Graham solution for passive investors. Invest 50% in index fund, 50% in
treasuries (or TIPs). Rebalance yearly.

2. Pick somebody you believe is good enough manager. Third Avenue. Dodge & Cox.
Tweedy, Browne. Fairholme. No guarantees that they will outperform for decades,
but they may do OKish. You don't need super returns of Mike Burry to do OK.

You can also mix 1 and 2, e.g. by putting the stock portion of 1 into one of
the funds from 2.

The really tough part is to make sure your family follows your plan. Cause I'm
sure they gonna get spooked and sell when index or fund crashes. :(((
--------------------------------------------------

General note: Somehow people think: fund managers are difficult to pick, they
underperform market, therefore I (my wife, my kids, my friends) should all
learn how to invest and do it themselves. Cause obviously they can do better
than fund managers, yes? Well, for some of us this is true, but for 90% of
people it is not. Your wife, kids, friends may have no inclination or
capability to invest well. So you either have to tell them to hide money under
mattress or a simple strategy that will yield average/OK returns. If they are
not interested/capable, telling them to spend their free time on investments
will not lead to anything good.

Hi rllee:

Re: Gulf Resources, Inc. (GFRE)

I like the low valuation, the extremely low PE, excellent future earnings but
still will not invest because of the Chinese exposure. The option market
agrees.

The May $5.00 calls theoretical value s/b $1.94 but is bid $1.00 Ask $1.40 a
28% discount at the ask and a 41% discount from the last trade at $1.15.

I thought it might be a trade to buy the stock and sell an in the money covered
call but not at such a huge discount. You would have to sell them at the bid
($1.00) which is a 52% discount from the theoretical value.

On the flip side, the market is buying over 289 contracts of the May $5.00
Puts. Theoretical value s/b $0.32/contract but at $0.50/contract at the bid and
$0.65/contract at the ask is a 36% premium (bid) & 51% premium (ask) and on
heavy volume 2x OI.

Market thinks this stock is headed lower.

Possible trade: Buy the stock and sell the May $2.50 Call for $3.00. Expect to
buy the Calls back for $2.00 or less in 60 days.

I've yet to be burned on Chinese stocks and I own at least 3 of them now, so
I'm not as gun-shy as others. I'm not going to pound the table on GFRE, but
here's why it's reasonable for GFRE to be earning solid earnings in relative to
the share price:

1) If you search the internet in general for large bromine Producers in the
world, GFRE comes up as one of the names.

2) If you search Bromine prices over the last couple of years, those are up
also a good deal.

So, from a general standpoint, I think GFRE should be earning a lot of money in
their business. And they're reporting good earnings, so it makes sense to me. I
haven't done an exhaustive search, but it seems like various Bromine producers
are doing well these days...

I'm not pounding the table, and I'm not going to take a large position in GFRE
unless it slides under $5 and option premiums make a covered call a good
risk/reward, but it looks like a value to me.

Well, I've been battered by most of the Chinese stocks I hold. If they were USA

expectations for business for '11-'12, one has to wonder if there's something
else going on other than misplaced fear continuing to drive these stocks down.

I closed JST. Have been in this one since maybe '03. No longer willing to hold
a small Chinese company with moderate prospects and a p/e of maybe 8x in

I added to GFRE today also. Very small position for me. With a p/e of 4 for an
industrial chemicals company, I'll chance holding on.

Gave up on auto parts supplier, WATG. Sold at loss.

Hello Paul,

Yeah, I guess my strategy so far with these Chinese stocks is to either buy
companies that are selling below cash and buying back their own stock (ACTS)
and/or ones with resources in the ground selling with projected p/e's under 5.
I'm also beginning to look at the solar sector for stocks with projected p/e's
under 5.

I feel like those three criteria:

1) Cash + Buy Backs
2) Resources in the ground of commodities where prices are rising
3) Decently-sized Solar companies known in the sector

Limit the likelihood of a stock being a fraud. So far, that's worked for me,
but who knows. The stock market is a game of probabilities.

Madharry, couple of points:

I distinguish between fund manager and investment manager. If someone hires an
investment manager because they don't have the skill set or inclination to
manage money themselves, the job of the investment manager as I see it is to
manage monies with an appropriate and agreed upon risk level for the client.
It's not the job of such an investment manager to continuously (year after
year) beat the market. It's to help shepherd the client's money so that the
client can achieve financial goals within an appropriate and agreed upon risk.
Of course in the good times, when the market is up, young family members want
to "invest" - everybody's doing it and it's so easy (e.g Barbra Streisand is
quoted in Fortune giving her investment tips)- well then, the investment
manager is history if he/she can't at least beat the market, no matter what
kind of investing or desired results were agreed on previously.

in any scientific way that makes sense. most seem to either use a yardstick of

which is based upon past performance obviously. it seems like a few might have
some models where they adjust the percentages based upon relationship between
market pe or dividend and treasury bonds. not convinced that any of these
approaches work that well or is very efficient. I have one wealthy friend, who
more or less took the buffet approach and tweaked it a bit. has i think 5 years

Re: BHP & BBL

I see that BBL has traded a long time so it is not new (even though it is
labeled BHP Billiton Adr New). BHP did announce they would be buying back 5% of
the BBL shares because of the discount. From what I read, the two companies are
indeed one (a merger of sorts) via some sort of contractual agreement. They
both show 2.78 Billion share outstanding, pay an annual dividend of $1.84/year
and show the same BV (according to Yahoo).

I never really paid too much attention but BHP is my 3rd largest holding so if
BBL is the same company but selling at a discount, I thought I would move 1/2
of my BHP shares to the BBL shares.

I will need to research it a bit more. It may have something to do with one
being an Australian ADR (BHP) vs a London ADR (BBL) and there could be some
currency conversion difference.

Both are selling near their all time highs. If you find anything new please

CVX. Foolish to do a relative p/e comparison of CVX to XOM which the author
did. P/e of XOM will almost always be higher than the other integrated oil
companies, because it's biggest, has best balance sheet, and arguably is best
managed. As someone stated here, perhaps XOM's the best managed of any (large)
company. Can't therefore correctly conclude CVX is cheaper - a bargain - just
because its p/e is lower than Exxon's.

However, if you are a young guy and a value investor and a long-term
buy-&-holder, you could likely buy CVX here at current price, add to it
occasionally, and eventually retire comfortably just from doing that. You might
have no need to buy other stocks or play the market.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=CVX+Basic+Chart&t=my

Plenty of people owe their comfortable retirement to making that one buy
decision and holding on. I worked for CVX in the 1990's as a consultant, and
came across several such people. (aside: Fabulous company to consult for. They
had money, were willing to spend it on something they believed in. And they did
not cut corners to jeopardize quality or safety. jmo)

Good gosh, CVX stock reminds me I know someone in my neighborhood who was
oldest of ten kids, ran away from home and was on her own at 13 because there
wasn't enough beds/space in their two-room family shack, married twice, left
with a kid, broke, no money, no job, no education, and by dint of perseverance
got a low-level job at an aerospace company. Every dollar precious, she saved,
learned about investing, began picking a couple of conservative companies she
saw around her. This after she guessed she could do as good or better than the
broker(s) she initially relied on for help/expertise when she started out.
She's retired now in a paid up home with a nice portfolio consisting I believe,
of primarily Chevron stock.

Oh well, do as I say, not as I do. Sorry I ever sold part of my CVX holdings,
sorry I did not continue to reinvest dividends back into the stock, and sorry I
have the position in an ira (where I won't get capital gain break if I sell). I
show I still have shares acquired in '05, '06, '08, '10, and this January.
Maybe not much compared to some of my other holdings, but glad for what I still

bought dell stock, we could have bought the whole apartment a few years later
with the profits, and retired on the balance, and we could have done the same
thing later when my wife bought an apple for her next computer. two years ago
she bought a subscription to netflix- sigh.

I agree with what Madharry said. Also, although I think Chevron may be good
investment for five years or so, IMHO, we will get to oil replacement at some
point. And it's not clear what will happen to oil companies then. CVX and XOM
are really large companies, so it's tough for them to grow. Assuming you want
15% return per year, the size has to double in 5 years, go up 4 times in 10, 16
times in 20 years. Of course, that does not account for dividends and stock
buybacks, so theoretically you can get good returns from megacaps. It's still
not as easy as starting with CVX or BRK twenty years ago.

All these stories of people who just did the buy and hold thing with one stock
suffer from survivorship bias. We here the stories from the winners but not
from the loosers
that held on stock that did not do too well or went to zero. I work for a
company with a very volatile stock but it was mostly down since 2002 - the
stock lost 95%+ of it's
peak value since Y2000. A lot of people were betting on it - some got out close
to the top but most rode it all the way down and didn't retire and kept working
many years longer
than they thought they would.

Those starting at a pharma company in the 90's propbably thought they were set
for life - great benefits, great business with 20% net profit margin, growing
15%+ year. You get a good salary ESPP and stock options on top and keep it
rolling. Most stocks like PFE, MRK and many others are ~50% of their value in
2000/2001. Many of these aspiring armchair millionaires probably got laid off.
the index tells a truer story, They are flat for 10 years, so on average people
did not get rich. If they constantly put funds in to their 401k they bought a
lot at the top during the last decade. Many folks had to take serious salary
cuts in the last great recession, 401k matches were cut, bonus payments cut,
furloughs, 10% pay cuts etc., so I do not think that the law of averaging
work too well when contributions are by design procyclical. Even worse, I do
not think that the outlook for the next 10 years is much better than for the
last 10 ones, due to Bernankes clownbuck policy.

I say stay nimble and look out for opportunities as they arise and keep a bunch
of cash (or quasy cash or at least a bond fund) waiting for the fat pitches
that come along.I expect a crappy but unefficient market going forward and I
think the nimble strategy will work.

next 10 years will be bad as it was "obvious" in 2000 that next 10 years will

There are two things going on here, imo, Madharry.

There's me and my liking of CVX, and my experience with employees who've bought
and held this stock.

There's my acquaintance who never worked at CVX, but bought and held that stock
as a major part of her investment portfolio.

Fair enough to say there's plenty of risk with working for a company and making
its stock a significant holding. And also, fair enough to say there's
survivorship bias with looking at this as a investment method.

I point out though, this acquaintance, using only her limited academic skills
and limited funds, but looking around at investment possibilities, found CVX
and invested in it and held on to it. (Aside: self-taught, she can talk
bonds/annuities/stocks/real estate.) It seems to me what she's done is the
exact Buffet espoused way. What stocks have you guys found that you have been

Jurgis, which stocks are cheap? Most groups except financials are up and
trading at even higher multiples than they did in 2007. This is particularly
true to industrials. Financials are probably cheap for good reason. FWIW, i do
think that most insurance stocks are undervalued relative to historical
baselines. Industrials seem overvalued. Energy is somewhat cheap, most
metal/raw material stocks seem expensive as earnings are based on very high
commodity prices.

Stocks are cheaper than they were in Y2000 for sure but compared to historical
baselines, they are not cheap (with the exception of financials) based on P/S,

Well, as far as Third Ave is concerned, that may be true unless you look at
Y2008 performance - many 3rd Ave funds lost 50%+. They have some good ideas but
they also go spectaculary wrong, like with MBIA (when they argued in Y2007 that

TAVFX is a good one to study on long term performance:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=my&s=TAVFX&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=&c= ^GSPC

It underperformed market during ~2K bubble. Caught up (down ;)) in 2002 crash.
Outperformed market in 2002-2007. Caught down in 2008. Is outperforming again.

Overall still, I would say it has been a great fund during its existence.

Interestingly enough Tweedy Browne has underperformed:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=my&s=TBGVX&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=&c= ^GSPC
Sequoia too:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=my&s=SEQUX&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=&c= ^GSPC

But then 1990's is the decade when market beat most of the funds and 2000's is
the opposite. So any fund that started before 1990 will have underperformance
from the start. Another couple examples:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=my&s=LMVTX&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=&c= ^GSPC

Paul,

You are right that most of us are trading too much, even the ones who think
they follow Buffett. I am definitely guilty in this.

On the other hand, it is very very hard to hold a stock that might be MSFT or
CVX or whatever that you bought for long term, but which has become overpriced.
GOOG or AAPL might be recent examples. Other companies seem cheaper and more
attractive and there's the trade.

Just to clarify: when you say buy-and-hold for very long time. How do you
determine what company qualifies? What price do you buy at (valuation? no
valuation at all?)? Do you sell at all and when (valuation? business change?)?
How big position you take?

The longest I held stock I think was in a company I worked for. Maybe 5-7
years. I sold couple times at pretty high prices, mostly because my options
were expiring. The stock is now much lower than where I sold most of it and
it's not clear if it will ever recover. So it's not a happy example of
buy-and-hold forever. But then it was a tech company, so perhaps it does not
qualify.

From my pure investment stocks, I think BRK is my longest holding and that's
only because Buffett runs it. I will double check what others I have held long.

I don't have that many that where I'm still holding the original shares years
later. Nestle from '03 would be one. Bought because I believed it could/would
be around for 20+ more years doing good business. Stock price was relatively
(to itself) low when I bought, if I recall correctly.

I have some like Big Lots (BIG) where I've held shares in the company and its
predecessor companies (e.g. PicNSav) for maybe 25-30 years.

With NSRGY my plan is to just hold on.

With BIG, I've bought, sold, rebought, resold several times as the stock seemed
under or over valued to me. Almost always, if not always, kept at least a stub
position.

The stocks I have such as NSRGY or http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IBM (acquired
in '96) where I believe I know in advance that I'm not going to be selling or
trading them, I have bought in small amounts. If I had a large position or even
if it grew into a large position relative to other stocks I hold, the
volatility that it would bring to the portfolio would be too difficult for me
to handle. I'm not as tough as the retired lady I mentioned who apparently
sleeps okay with only a few stocks that she owns.

With small positions in stocks, and if they're tucked in a diversified
portfolio, I find it's easier to ride the stock's ups and downs.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TDW , initially acquired in '01, for example, is
one I've been able to do that with. An example for me of what can happen if a
stock kind of gets lost in a portfolio. A double in ten years roughly, but
maybe such a stock should have been culled from the portfolio, not kept in it.

Hi Paul

My two success stories are CVX and BHP. In the late 90's I bought Texaco
(around $28.00/share) for it's 5% dividend and in October 2000 CVX purchased
them. In September 2004 CVX split 2:1 so my $28.00 shares are now $14.00
shares.

One of my largest long term holds w/ very large capital gains is in BHP. I
started to accumulate shares in the 90's and with two stock splits (one in 96
and another in 2001) my cost basis is now around $10.00/share. Stock is just
off it's all time high of $96.00/share.

These two were easy holds as they paid a pretty good dividend and both owned
valuable assets "in-the-ground". They are also my #1 and #2 holdings. I only
sell shares now from time to time as I do not want any one position to be too
large a % of the portfolio.

During the Dot Com blow up, I loaded up on GLW (2/2002) at an average cost of
$5.00/share. I still hold 75% of those shares waiting for $30.00/share. Not
sure if this one will make it back to it's 2000 all time high of $100.00/share.
This one is a harder hold for me as it pays little or no dividend so I do sell
covered calls on some of the shares from time to time to generate income.

It's interesting that some of the big movers now are these E&P companies. Since
October 2010 my basket of now 15 companies are up more than 42% due mainly to 3
or 4 of them launching into multi bagger status. I am not sure how long I will
hold these but I would not be surprised to see a few of them taken out by a
much larger integrated Oil and/or Natural resource company for cash or my
preference shares in the acquirer.

The biggest problem with holding such large gains inside the portfolio is that
when you peel off shares it creates a significant costly tax event. Therefore,
I do a lot of tax loss harvesting to offset some of the gains. It's a good
problem to have and you can decide when you want to pay the tax man.

3rd Ave is too focused on private market value. The problem is that in some
situations there is no private market. japan is such an example or during the
credit crunch, due to lack of financing. Then the stocks that are held based on
private market value expectations can fall very deep.

There is a difference between investing based on private market value and
investing based on value (as is). If you buy based on private market valuation,
availability of financing is important and the presence of buyers. Both can
disappear rather quickly. If you buy based on the value (NPV of the discounted
cash flows) of the entity in it;s existing form, you neither need a buyer nor
cheap financing to come out ahead.

I also think that 3rd Ave has a bad hand with financial entities - they are
late to acknowledge mistakes in their analysis and then ride the stuff all the
way to zero. I do like to read their letters for ideas. In many cases, I have
been able to buy stocks cheaper than they do, in other cases I buy their
discards. I also like that they prowl around the Globus and buy wherever they

I agree with your points about 3rd Ave.

Where 3rd Ave got hurt too was by their fundholders. As stocks everywhere fell
in '08 - early '09, there were just too many fundholders who wanted out of the
fund. So, whereas Mr. Whitman and staff I believe would've at least liked to
have held on to stocks they favored, or maybe add to positions or start new
positions, instead, they were forced to sell large amounts of stock to meet
redemptions. They so stated this in one of their letters. And if the the fund
held stocks that didn't have much of a public market (some of their Japanese
stocks?), that likely added to the problem of exiting positions. A risk that
had a fierce bite -- getting locked into a position but having fundholders
demanding their money...and no banks or financial firms willing to lending
money to backstop the fund.

I wonder if the fundholders exiting and forcing the buy/hold Whitman to sell,
may have kept him from losing even more as the market fell.

Life Partners Holdings, Inc. (LPHI)
Recent Price: 8.24
P/E: 5.0
Current Yield: 12.62%

The Skinny
There’s a saying that life insurance is great. The downside is that you have to
die to see the benefit. LPHI to the “rescue”! Seriously, though, the company is
in a unique financial services niche in that they purchase life insurance
policies from holders at a discount to the face value.
Let's say, God forbid, you’re terminally ill and would like to use money from
your insurance policy’s death benefit (DB). LPHI might purchase it at say 60 or
70 cents on the dollar from you. If the DB is $300,000, you’d get $180,000 to
$210,000. You might leave some on the table. But that’s the trade off. If you
really need the money or want it to take the round the world trip you’ve always
wanted to take, that was facilitated. And..when you get closer to the light,
LPHI gets the $300,00: A nice little 30 or 40% ROI. An oogie business? Yes
indeedy. But the numbers are worth a look. ROE is a massive 54.9%. Low to no
debt. 8.2% EPS growth assisted by 9% earnings growth. The pay out ratio is
unassuming at 54%. Not bad. The stock price is almost 58% off of it’s 52 week
high. The business might be creepy, but there might be some value there as
well.

The Danger
While LPHI has turned in some consistently good reports, Q3 2010 saw a 15%
decrease in net income. Not a good trend. Also, the business has done well
partially due to the low rate environment. As rates tick up, who knows? And
let’s face it, it’s kinda like buying a tobacco company, there’s a bit of scary
dance with the devil to it. Most glaringly though is an SEC investigation that
the Wall Street Journal reported in late January which the company has

lawsuits and more than a handful are popping up. Maybe those numbers ARE too
good to be true. Dance at your own risk.

i dont remember what these companies used to be called only that investors lost
a ton of money when aids patients were able to live vastly prolonged lives. I
would question whether an investor would have enough access to portfolio
information to determine the likelihood that this yield will continue. I also
wonder to what extend they can book profit based on actuarial and other
assumptions without actually having the cash.

re 3rd Ave - I agree with the fact that redemptions hurt their funds
performance. Marty even kicked in a lot of his own funds in 2008 to boost the
fund and increase the confidence of his shareholders. I think he is sincere.

1) The redemptions hurt because he is in a lot of illiquid positions. those
were not necessarily the Japanese stocks (the stocks he owned there are liquid
enough for his fund) but questionable (imo) situations like Forest City,
Alicon, St Joe.

2) The redemptions forced him to keep a larger cash balance than he otherwise
would have to avoid further liquidity situations. This hurt his performance in
the recovery. Despite that, his performance in the recovery was quite good.

The above shows me however that his funds are not recession proof. I expect
that he may run into the same situation with the next market downturn, unless
he changes his investment approach (unlikely imo).

I publicly say it here:

YOU WERE RIGHT. I WAS WRONG.

As of today, I don't have buy orders for Chinese RTOs, I am liquidating my
existing positions (some of which are halted, so not going to liquidate for a
while).

GMXR's hidden value begins to be revealed . . .

From the Big Dog's Boom Boom Room thread - 3-31-2011.

Re: GMX Resources Inc. (GMXR)

Pritchard

GMXR – Strong Performer Yesterday – GMXR was a top performer yesterday, rising
more than 9% vs. a 1% gain for the EPX. Possible explanations include 1)
unconfirmed reports of 2 extremely good Three Forks well results from another
E&P company in the Lewis & Clark prospect in Stark County ND -GMXR has 10,368
net acres in the area; 2) the company has started the first of 7 planned
vertical tests of the Norphlet and/or Smackover Sands which are believed to be
below the Haynesville Shale in its own backyard in Harrison County in East TX,
where GMXR has 40,000 acres of deep rights. There has been some recent activity
nearby targeting the formations which are believed to be oil bearing. The
company plans to utilize existing Cotton Valley wellbores to initially test the
formation thus keeping dry hole costs at a modest ~$0.5 mm; 3) a growing
comfort level in the company’s liquidity position and ability to finance its
2011/2012 drilling plans, which feature getting more oily with the entry into
the Williston Basin and Niobrara. We remain buyers of GMXR.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

They just closed their GMX Resources, 9.25% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock
offering. Distributions of 9.25% ($2.3125) per annum are paid quarterly on
3/31, 6/30, 9/30 & 12/31 to holders of record on the 10th day prior to the
payment date. I may add a few of these to go along with my MHR preferred
issues.

not a bad return on the preferred but i think i will stick to the gmxr and mhr
stock that i own. after listening to the conference call on TTT I decided that
I continue to be very comfortable with Mr. Smith managing my money. Since I can
buy shares at a small discount to tangible book value,. I added about 25% to my
already substantial stake in the company and i hope he will be able to grow the
book value of the business over time. I would recommend those interested to
listen to the conference especially to the Q&A. Mr. Smith seems forthright
about his goals for the company and he seemed responsive to the many questions
asked.

GMXR and its pref:

Can you explain why they have huge "Impairment of oil and natural gas
properties and assets held for sale" for the last 3 years? Did they buy some
assets that suck so much they have to be impaired for 3 years running? Is it
because they are gas-heavy and natgas prices keep crashing? I find it
disturbing that E&P has to impair assets during a year when oil price went up
to $90 or so.

Balance sheet is a mess. There's debt, then there's prefs accounted as equity
but which really is about another 50M of debt (look at how MHR accounts for
prefs), there's no cash.

IMHO GMXR pref should drop quite lower to be attractive. At least MHR has
cleaner balance sheet.

TTT - Nice pop up and thanks for the buying alert. Glad I held on to my shares
after the rights offering and the slide downwards just prior. The spinoff of
KHDHF was an added bonus.

What's your prognostication of both TTT and KHDHF going forward? I already have
a good profit in this one and do not wish to lose it since I do not follow this
company as closely as I should. It seems to put out a lot of news releases
since I do get an alert whenever a TTT new release occurs.

Some thinking on GMXR - The newly restructured company

I am not too sure what their reason was for taking the impairment charge but it
is history now and reflected in the stock price.

My intended small position in the newly issued preferred shares is basically to
take proceeds from a portion of my stock that I sold covered calls on (May
$5.00 Calls) and buy the 9.5% preferreds. It is important to me that I show
some type of income from the stock position and by holding BOTH the preferred
and common shares I accomplish this.

The impairment charge was large and I have to applaud management for accounting
for the worst case and booking the loss quickly. That is one of the reasons the
stock dropped from it's earlier highs at the $10.00-$15.00 share range. What
ever the reasons were (production issues, no JV partner interest, location did
not complement a NG gathering business, or merely the company had limited cash
resources to fully complete the project and had better uses for what they had -
ie. completing their Endeavor Gathering LLC project), it is what it is. I do
not believe their is any impending lease expiration on these parcel(s), so any
eventual sale will be gravy for the company (as the loss is already booked).
Some other group may find more value in the project than GMXR. This would be
the best time to sell especially with interest in US shale.

Along the same time line, the company completed the build out of their NG
gathering facility (Endeavor Gathering LLC) and subsequently sold a 40%
interest to Kinder Morgan Endeavor LLC (KME) to raise more cash. Endeavor
Gathering LLC is a midstream gas gathering operation that currently has 109
miles of pipeline, both high and low pressure, 25,000 horsepower of compression
with an estimated enterprise value of $95-100 million. Endeavor Gathering LLC
(a GMXR subsidiary company) generates good free flow cash so this assets s/b
able to help service the preferred debt.

Along with the new preferred issues, they refinanced their senior debt which
give them a bit more flexibility in their day-to-day credit facility. This
should allow their new wells under development to be brought into production.
The combined net cash flows should more than cover the new debt service. I am
expecting them to turn the corner and report positive net income and hopefully
a steady stream of growing earnings.

I have been wrong in the past and could very well be wrong now but I do like
the way management has maneuvered the company past this bump in the road. At
least I am pretty sure their is no fraud, their wells actually produce NG and
their bank accounts really do show they have $2.35 Million cash.

i sold a lot of my khdhf and put the funds generated into ttt. i dont really
have a prognostication on ttt. I putting my faith in Mr. Smith's continued
ability to generate price appreciation on his business purchases. I am
satisfied that he knows what he is doing, and look at it as akin to putting
money into a hedge fund.
I wont know what he is doing with the money most of the time but i hope he
keeps making me money over time, and i put the additional money to work with
him at less than book.

I still own some khdhf, but I just dont want any more china exposure than i
have already. so if what i have appreciates that will be great but I wont be
following it particularly.

Hi Mr. Gogo -

Re: Armanino Foods of Distinction Inc. (AMNF.PK)

I have never checked on who or what the company does regarding audited books
but I have reviewed their entire report(s) and found them easy to understand,
very conservative, and they appear to follow the overall management style in
general. I believe one or more of the board member(s) is a CPA and one or more
of the principals who prepares the reports is a CPA (and one may even be a
general partner in a local CPA firm). I will have to make a mental note of the
exact relationships next time I review their reports.

The most current quarter is typically the slowest of the year and Q4 generally
has the biggest growth. However, the company has landed some large regional
(entire U.S.) distribution deals specifically with Cost Plus and Dot Foods (
http://www.dotfoods.com/about_us.html ). I expect to see the impact of these
deals flow into their Q1 & Q2 sales. It will be interesting to see just how
much they impact the total sales numbers.

This link provides a company history and why the company now trades on the pink
sheets. I think they wanted to reduce the complicated NASDAQ filing
requirements and took this approach in 2005.

cription-51495.html

Again, this one is no fraud. I have visited their facility in Hayward, checked
my local supermarket for their products and feel very comfortable that they
really have $800K worth of CD's in their corporate bank account.

EKS

FWIW- I have been fooled before and no doubt I will be fooled again. I even
remember many years ago a local disk drive company had put bricks inside their
boxes on the pallets in their warehouse. It fooled the auditors for awhile then
once it was discovered, the stock tanked (not sure if the company went BK). Oh,
the CEO and top management were Asian and had ties in China. This happened in
Milpitas Ca (Silicon Valley) sometime in the 90's.
