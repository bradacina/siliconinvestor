Not good for the long term if James Tobin's Q Ratio tests previous lows....

Tobin’s Q Ratio Indicates ‘Horrific’ Market Bottom, CLSA Says
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601110&sid=a6iiap2DL_gQ

From the article:"...The ratio, a method of valuing U.S. companies developed by
Nobel Prize laureate economist James Tobin, indicates that the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, set for its worst year since 1931, may sink by another 55
percent to 400 when the market bottoms around 2014, London-based Napier said.
The ratio divides total market capitalization by the cost of replacing
assets...."

==========================================================

The key is if there is a huge long term deflation spiral that makes it cheaper
to buy replacement assets than the market now values them.

BWP - i take it that you sold your position when it went to 24$+? Good move,
you've got to take profits when you can in this market.

I like the MLP's. The companies that find stuff make a lot of money when stuff
goes up. Those that move it always make money even if stuff goes down. If you
own an MLP the money get's paid to you straight away with little excuses from
management.
FWIW I am interested in BWP when it yields 12%+.

BWP: Yes, Spekulatius, sold. Not so high as 24 though. I intended my post to be
a response to your post, but I accidentally misdirected it.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25121831&srchtxt=bwp

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25122071&srchtxt=bwp

I'll add some more info about why I'm interested in BWP. First, there's the
"usual obvious stuff": There's the distribution yield - now about 10%. Maybe
it's going up/maybe it'll be cut (I've no idea). There's the Tish family
involvement: apparently they hold 70% and plan to, or will, invest another $1B
in the company. This will be both helpful - BWP will get access to funds to
meet its growth potential or growth targets -- and hurting. Because the Tish
investment will dilute current shareholders. And of course, there's the whole
mlp tax thing we have discussed here (whether it's worthwhile for small USA
investors to have to go through k-1 partnership agreements).

For me now though, it is particularly about these two articles published today:

"Haynesville discoveries lift Exco, Petrohawk shares"

http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/exco-petrohawk-rally-haynesville-natural/
tory.aspx?guid= {BE369C75-B4C8-4D81-A67C-54BF9F670F9D}&siteid=yhoof

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Two-companies-producing-gas-apf-13788217.html

This Haynesville thing is going to be prolific - I am guessing. CHK is there
too, and I'm adding a little to my CHK position based on that.

As I said earlier though, my concern is that if this shale is so good, and
there are other shales that have potential too with the new horizontal drilling
technology, we are liable to see a glut of natural gas. Something where no e&p
company can make a profit.

I am going to bet though, that if the gas can be produced at a marginal level,
rather than shutting down the wells that are built, the shale e&p companies
will continue to produce. And THAT brings up BWP who has a pipeline
transmission business in the area. I am believing that BWP gets its revenue
from volumes of gas moved, sometimes through fixed contracts, and not by $
value of gas going through the pipes. That is, BWP could be a winner no matter
how gas prices affect individual e&p companies.

http://www.bwpmlp.com/uploadedImages/Shared_Assets/Maps/JPEG/Map%20JPEG%20-%20B
P%20all.jpg

From the Oct. 27 BWP earnings call:

"The Haynesville Shale could be one of the biggest shale plays of all and all
of our systems essentially sit in the Haynesville Shale area which gives us
opportunities to enhance capacity on our pipes to move that gas to the
Perryville market or farther east if there’s interest in doing that. We are
well positioned for the Haynesville play."

If BWP keeps falling on no adverse news, my intent is to add to build a decent
position.

El Paso Corporation Successfully Prices $500 Million of 12.000% Senior Notes

http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/081209/0459113.html

From the article:"...Net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $438

general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt maturing during
2009. 2009 maturities include approximately $112 million of El Paso's 6.375%
notes due February 1, 2009; approximately $539 million of El Paso's 7.125%

===========================================================

Notice that the debt they are paying off is between 6%-7%. They will now pay
almost twice the rate they did with their old debt. To make things worse is the
average price of the NG they sell is around $5/cfm down from a high of $12/cfm.

Not a very good combination of events to grow the company. However, with the
financing the company should survive. I do like their pipe line delivery
services and perhaps they may be able to offset some of these higher debt
service expenses by raising their delivery prices.

The electronics distribution business has inventories subject to quick

years gives me some confidence that inventory management is an important
management skill set for these folks.

Otoh though, we're seeing this sudden downturn in the economy unlike other
downturns so maybe there are business aspects that just aren't going to be
resolved without a lot of pain.

I'll bet management will size their inventory properly and if required,
restructure their business for profitability. I look for a reversion-to-mean
with at least a double for ARW and AVT from current prices within the next
three years. More risk with the other (smaller) players; also perhaps more
potential reward.

Here is another idea on how to invest in oil so you can lock in your monthly
gasoline costs for many years out into the future.

I suggest buying a Canadian Oil Trust that spins off dividend distributions
each month. For example, buy 400 shares of ENERPLUS RES FD (NYSE: ERF) for a
total investment of $7,800 and you will receive $124.00 each month, plenty to
fuel your cars.

If you are lucky, after four years your initial investment should double in
value to $15,600 or $39/share which is just above its 200 day MA of $36/share.

ERF tracks USO so as oil increases then the price of your ERF shares should
rise too.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=USO&t=1y&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=erf

You do have to pay tax on the dividends you receive and a foreign tax is also
withheld by Canada (which you get back when you file the appropriate IRS form).

You want to buy the shares when you believe oil is near its low. You can also
increase your return by selling covered calls against the shares you own which
allows you to peel off a few shares for a nice gain when the stock is called
away.

I set up a similar investment (1,390 shares of ERF) to cover my monthly health
care premiums but the only problem was oil went down while my monthly health
care premiums increased 16%. I double down when oil fell below $40/bbl and plan
to sell covered calls on my excess shares once oil moves back over $60/bbl.
Hopefully any gains I might make on the oil investment long term will cover the
annual increase in my monthly health care premiums. In the meantime you
continue to receive your monthly distribution even though the underlying
commodity has changed in value.

Be aware that if oil remains below $40/bbl for a significant amount of time
(like more than 12 months), ERF will probably cut their distribution payout by
50%. Management trys to maintain a constant payout by hedging their production
in the future.

Inventories- Also keep in mind that if inventories have ballooned and the
materials prices then cratered, that inventory could be worth less than what
the company paid for it - the inverse has happened with building products, for
example - sales have looked better than expected in 2008 in $, but then you
look at unit volume and it tells a different story.

The metric I'm focusing in on is A/R and DSO for a lot of companies.

From:Paul Senior
I don't know how to relate A/R and DSO figures to stock price. We're in a
recession, nobody buying nuthin, people saving not spending -- so I have to
believe inventories of all non-JIT companies are ballooning, lots of customers
are late pays, DSO figures are high. No surprise stock prices of distributor
companies are down substantially. How can I tell if the stocks are down enough
to reflect the bad A/R, DSO figures? Or that there's worse to come? Seeing A/R,
DSO figures now, doesn't tell me that stocks might or might not be buys at
current prices. (That's just me though. Maybe others can use these metrics in a
better way.)

I haven't heard much about DSO for a while. Reminds me of the Motley Fool
writers who back in the late '90's early '00's used to like to use the DSO
metric: A company would announce surprisingly bad earnings, the stock would
drop sharply and make headlines. Next the MF authors would come in and write an
article saying, well really, the troubles and stock drop shouldn't have been a
surprise to anybody because look, you can see that DSO were rising quarter over
quarter and so it was apparent that things were not going well, and you as an
investor could've avoided this problem company if you only tracked DSO.

Well for me, that wouldn't be easily accomplished because I have so many
stocks, and DSO requires some calculations. More significantly imo, was that
the MF articles always came out after the fact of the stock fall. Never any
article with a prediction of a stock drop based on an analysis by the author of
DSO.

Anyway, maybe DSO is helpful/useful to others. I'd like to see it's predictive
successes - not ex-post facto reports. Right now, since all stocks are down, as
I say, for me, I don't know how DSO use might help or influence my buy
decisions.

A/R- A greater discount to the price one is willing to pay for a company with
rising A/R and higher DSO is warranted. Customer risk is growing as you noted.
If I buy a company for assets today and value those assets (a/r, inv among
them)without a sufficient discount when the transaction closes those assets
might be worth significantly less if the a/r cannot be collected and the
inventory is now worth lower because materials prices have dropped a lot from
where the inventory purchased.. just something to consider, esp when valuing

Not saying what I do is the best way, or only way, or that a/r dso couldn't or

To me DSO is not so much a valuation metric as a go/no go metric. If you're

little use. In that situation you're probably better off using balance sheet

In other words, the article representing BK as a buy because of its cash is

"BK tangible book value is <5B$ and their market cap is almost 30B$."

Yes, I spotted that relatively low tangible book value. Quite a difference
between market cap (and stated book value) and tangible book. Now if BK - The
Bank of New York Mellon Corporation - were actually a bank - or primarily a
bank, then I would expect/hope that most of its assets and liabilities were
financials such that tangible and stated book value figures would be closer
together. (In normal times, buying a bank at its book value has been considered
a good bet.)

If I were to buy, I might pick $23 as a somewhat arbitrary point for a small BK
buy.

I like that BK in every year in at least the past ten, has sold for at least
twice stated book value (except maybe '07, selling at 1.9x stated book value).
So this might give a 2:1 upside.

I don't like that stated book value seems to have dropped (in '08). If that
continues, that 2:1 upside might not be so profitable a bet. I also don't like
(maybe because I don't really understand) the big discrepancy between stated
and tangible book value - maybe it's due to the Mellon acquisition (buying over
book of course).
--------------
All this may be somewhat inconsistent on my part (I hope not hypocritical
though), because I have bought and am holding a few shares of STT which has
some of the same aspects I question about BK. BK at current price and prospects

the stocks like STT where I really don't know all the details of their balance
sheet, but where I am willing to bet on reversion-to-mean?

I would like to believe that if I were my normal suspicious self and if I had
gazillions of dollars, in normal times if somebody showed me where a company
delivered 12% steady returns but couldn't explain how, except by saying
something about it's due to some arcane financial transactions that no normal
person understands, that I would sneer and pass on the investment opportunity.
More likely, based on what I do, I might try to look at the history, assume
future would be similar, and invest with the guy. I would like to believe there
as here, only a small $ amount though.

This time of financial/economic distress is the Warren Buffett tide running
out, and as the tide recedes, as he says we see who's swimming without
swimsuits. I just wonder how many are out there and if I'm in the water with
them.

So many people were apparently duped by this guy either directly or through
funds tied into him, that there is going to be a lot of pain for many. Not all
these folks are going to be rich people only losing a fraction of their wealth.

Very sad.

I read the article in the ny times and several points struck me;

1. Complacency - they produced decent consistent results for decades. after
awhile customers accepted the black box approach and didnt care that the
financial were audited by some unknown firm. See lehman bear stearn, aig, maybe
gm too.

2. What happened to diversification? how does a charitable organization have
all their funds in one place?

3. The hired gun approach. is the hired gun responsible?
Many of the investors who were burned had no idea they were investing with
Madoff they entrusted their money to a manager who in turn invested in a madoff
fund.

This is similar in my view to those foolish cfo-s who took their companys short
term cash and put it to work in auction rate securities at a rate marginally
better than t bills and are now stuck with it for multiple years. I expect we
will see lots of lawsuits and a withdrawals from funds of funds after this
fiasco.

The lessons that are here for the taking are: its foolish to believe that
because some name has invested in a ________________ thats it ok because they
have vetted it.

investors have to do their own due diligence. If we dont understand the way
they make or lose money and the risks that are being taken, the investment
should not be big no matter how well the company or shares have performed in
the past.

I guess for me that means listening to the conference calls and reading the sec
reports more carefully than I have been.

re madoff from one of the hired guns, according to a poster on a another site:

FGG's Due Diligence Process

FGG's due diligence process is deeper and broader than a typical Fund of Funds,
resembling that of an asset management company acquiring another asset manager,
rather than a passive investor entering a disposable investment.

A number of areas of inquiry are examined by a team of FGG professionals who
specialize in evaluating respective areas of risk. Typically, a manager has
been investigated and monitored for six to 12 months before that firm can be
accepted onto the FGG platform. Long negotiating periods enable FGG to be more
confident of its decisions before proceeding with a manager. Areas of
examination are centered around the following:

1. Portfolio Evaluation, Investment Performance, and Financial Risks:

A core area for further analysis is to attempt to dissect and further
understand investment performance, how a manager generates alpha, and what
risks are taken in doing so. As portfolio management and risk management
incorporate elements of both art and science, FGG applies both qualitative and
quantitative measures. FGG:

Examines independent prime broker trading records
Conducts detailed interviews to better understand the manager's methodology for
forming a market view, and for selecting and exiting core positions
Analyses trading records
Conducts a number of qualitative and quantitative tests to determine adherence
to risk limits over time
Confirms portfolio loss risk controls, diversification and other risk-related
control policies, as well as any experience regarding unexpected or extreme
market events
Reviews the risk and return factors inherent in the strategy
Evaluates capacity issues, which may affect alpha, as well as expected
opportunities going forward within each candidate's strategy
Analyses the various drivers underlying a particular portfolio's risk
Evaluates credit risk and market risk both at the instrument and portfolio
level
Assesses the extent to which leverage is used by a manager, as well as how it
is used, the funding sources, and the impact on the risk profile of the fund
Investigate whether or not private or special registration securities are held,
and determine how the daily trading volume and inventory held compares to the
float and/or daily trading volume for a given security
FGG also conducts many quantitative reviews of investment performance in light
of:

Fees and fee structure
Historical draw-downs
Return volatility
Commissions earned
Performance return in calm versus volatile markets
Current/historical correlation of the fund under consideration with standard
industry benchmarks, peer groups, and other FGG or competitor funds used as
benchmarks
FGG attempts to understand the return attribution for individual securities in
the portfolio, and conducts a full suite of VaR analyses and stress tests to
model the loss distribution function under extreme market scenarios. Leverage,
concentration limits, and long/short exposures are examined over time to assess
whether they have remained within operating guidelines.

Style fidelity is another key area of inquiry; the manager's trading pattern
over time and through various market environments, FGG determines whether the
manager is prone to trade outside of their area of expertise.

2. Personal Background Investigation:

FGG examines the abilities and personalities of the individuals involved in
managing the fund through extensive interviews, as well as background
investigations.
FGG verifies:
Education
Personal credit standing
Litigation and regulatory background
Track record
Other indicators

FGG explores the manager's experience and qualifications relative to the
strategy being managed. Prior professional associations of a manager's key
personnel can be crucial in understanding a person's experience and character
and how they run their investment management business.

3. Structural and Operational Risk:

"Operational risk" refers to the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, human resources, or systems, or from external
events. Operational failures, including misrepresentation of valuations and
outright fraud, constitute the vast majority of instances where massive
investor losses occur. Other operational risks include staff processing errors,
technology failure, and poor data.

Pricing models, as well as the adequacy, independence, and transparency of
valuation procedures, contingency plans, and other trading and settlement
procedures are all matters for close scrutiny by FGG professionals.

FGG seeks a sound understanding of whether a hedge fund possesses key controls
in the areas of portfolio management, conflicts of interest, segregation of
duties, and compliance. FGG carefully assesses the controls and procedures that
managers have in place and seek to determine actual compliance with those
procedures, often suggesting modifications, separations of responsibilities,
and remedial staff additions.

4. Legal, Compliance, and Regulatory Risk:

FGG's legal, compliance, and accounting teams specialize in investment
management regulation, securities compliance, corporate operations, and tax
issues. Hedge fund managers function within an ever more complex legal and
regulatory landscape, and the role of this part of the diligence exam is to
determine the seriousness of any deficiencies in this area which may cause risk
of sanction, loss, or reputational embarrassment.

Both in-house and retained legal professionals interview the management and
staff of the manager, research regulatory filings, and review corporate
organizational documents, as well as fund memoranda and related material
contracts.

re Maddoff -
it is quite apparent that all the investors in his ventures were assuming that
somebody else has done his research. My fear of a bllowup out of the blue is
the reason I would have a hard time to invest in those alternative investments
or hedge funds. Just too much incentive for the folks running these things to
bet it all on red. the most likely outcome of this mishap is that those
unregulated assets will have even higher outflows.

I do not think that such a thing could happen with mutual funds where auditing
is much more regulated and the incentive to do such a thing just isn't there
for the manager. FWIW LSBRX is still heading down as well as the junk bond
funds that I am following. The persistent decline of the bond market (sans
treasuries) is one of the reasons why I am fairly skeptical about the near term
outlook for stocks.

Also in Obama administration there might be emphasis on health care too. I'll
take a very few starter shares in http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BEC .

This author says he likes BEC's recurring revenues:

"Preventative Medicine In The Obama Era (BDX, BEC, DGX)"

http://community.investopedia.com/news/IA/2008/Preventative-Medicine-In-The-Oba
a-Era-BDX-BEC-DGX1126.aspx?partner=YahooSA

(aside: And in my day - when we were working tactics/strategies for preventive
maintenance for the machinery industry, we'd never ever use "preventative" for
"preventive".)

The guy here though is downgrading BEC today to ""Neutral" from "Outperform"
because it has the most exposure to weakening systems sales.":

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Sector-Snap-Med-Tech-stocks-apf-13832464.html

From BEC's 10/28 quarterly:

"Recurring revenue comprised of supplies, test kits, service revenue and
operating-type lease payments, increased more than 10% to $594.7 million, or
78.4% of total revenue. Clinical Diagnostics' recurring revenue increased 10.8%
over prior year quarter, led by Access-family Immunoassay growth of nearly 18%.
Total company cash instrument sales increased more than 25%...
In the quarter, we continued to expand our installed base and grow our emerging
markets position, resulting in unusually high cash instrument sales. As we
mentioned last quarter, growing our installed base shifts our product mix to
lower-margin hardware. Although unfavorable in the short-term from a gross
margin perspective, the associated recurring revenue in future periods
positions the company for reliable and sustainable revenue and earnings
growth...

Based on current exchange rates, full year revenue growth should be in the
range of 12% to 13%. We expect 2008 adjusted operating margin to be on par with
prior year. The outlook for adjusted non-operating expense is about $45
million. Adjusted pretax profit growth should be around 10%, with an adjusted
tax rate of 26% to 27%. Consequently, our adjusted EPS outlook remains at $3.55
to $3.65 based on a share count of about 64.5 million."

That'd be a p/e of 10-11 for the company. A relatively low p/e and p/sales for
BEC. Company profitable every year in past ten. I enter for just a few shares,
add more if stock drops on no adverse news. Also will consider
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BDX - if I can catch it under $60.

The idea of self testing kits that utilize consumable testing agents is a good
investment idea. One example is with the Lifescan diabetes glucose testing
equipment. This at home test is used daily (sometimes several times a day) and
requires a fresh testing strip for each test. The retail cost for each testing
strip is $1.00/each and with some medical co-payment plans can be as low as
$0.09/each. The manufacturing cost has to be very low (maybe no more that
$0.05/test strip).

It is estimated that 11% of the population have diabetes (either type 1 or type
2).
Prevalence of Diagnosed and Undiagnosed Diabetes among People Aged 20 Years or
Older, United States, 2007
<img src='http://ih.fotothing.com/71319.gif'</img>

Type 2 diabetes is the fastest growing of the two types. The first line of
control is at home testing (w/ daily testing that use the expensive test
strips) with a change in life style that focus on exercise and diet. A lot of
the drug therapy utilize generic low cost drugs (not much money made on the
Type 2 diabetes drug therapy).

The leader in the at home Diabetes test equipment is LifeScan owned by Johnson
& Johnson (JNJ). This could be a huge growth area for JnJ especially if an
Obama administration pays for the prevention therapy that includes the testing
equipment and (the expensive)consumable testing strips.

Paul - right on with BEC, I was looking at this one just this weekend. I
decided to go with TMO instead - they offer broader Product range and
consumables are 70%+ of the revenues as well.
TMO is acquisitive and has expanded margins quite a bit in recent years.
However in some respects I like BEC more. BEC is cheaper by some metrics and
may become a takeover target. I also note large insider holdings. BDX is
probably best in class in this space. The whole sector should be somewhat
resilient. I do know that consumables in this business are "sticky" products

re Cost of capital: there is no simple answer. I also have used 8% as cost of
capital in the past but I do not think it makes sense to use an arbitrary
number. I'd rather say that the cost of debt is whatever the bonds of the
company (if there are any) are yielding:

AA rated: 6%
BBB rated: 9%
B or less >15%.

Even within ratings there are large differences. The above numbers tend to be
values on the low end. These large interest rate differentials are due to the
perceived risk differences. I has a large difference for the perceived value of
a business. The most obvious example is the decline of the REITS. in fact if
you believe that current conditions exist for a long time, almost all REITS are
worth nothing.

Another example is MIC, the heavily indebted infrastructure business the equity
is in fact worthless (IMO). I am sort of tempted to try a short of SPG on the
thesis. This one is still trading at a fairly lofty valuation with an implied
cap rate of probably 8%. They own nice malls that people may use for little
more than window shopping while they buy their goods at discounters
(exaggerated but I think I got the trend). Short term catalyst may be retailer
going out of business or closing shops after XMAS.

I'm looking at lots of these bond etfs also. I've no experience with them, so
I'm still trying to understand what I'm getting when/if I buy.

Among the group, I looked at NCO last night. Looks like I wrongly decided to
pass.

Here are some of the puzzling aspects for me:

1. There are so many of these etfs by many different purveyors.
For example, with Nuveen's NCO, there's also NCL, NCP, and more. How to decide
among them?

2. Some (most?) of these look pretty dinky by assets. NCO, for example, only
has $168M in "total assets". I don't know what "total assets" or total
liabilities consists of (see #3)

3. Of course, we like the 9% yield and the equivalent of 13+% after-tax
equivalent. To get that though, these funds use leverage. 40% in the case of
NCO. Now if this leverage is some sort of sophisticated thing where there's no
real market for it (and we have seen this already - "auction market preferred
shares" anyone?), then if people want out of the fund, it's difficult for the
fund managers to sell out of positions, esp. sell out of thinly-traded muni
bonds and even more so of these thinly-traded (or even un-tradable) margin
vehicles.

4. I hadn't considered buying just for a trade. That seems like a possibility -
esp. for somebody who bought today and is already in positive territory. I'm
not sure how expensive it is to buy these things -- my broker charges an extra
fee if there several trades (buys&sells) with the etf. Also, I believe if
there's a trade out within 180 days there's a charge (not sure about this).

5. I guess, given the size and maybe how these things are managed, the sponsor
fees might be reasonable. Nevertheless, they seem unexpectedly expensive to me.
I see these things as bond funds - different from stock funds - and so as bond
related, the fees to me are off-putting . For example, NCO charges 1.29%. Of
net assets, I presume. So the positives are the great discount to nav which one
hopes narrows, the 9% yield, the 13+% equivalent yield. I get somewhat stuck
mentally though when I consider that muni bonds pay what -- 3%-4% -- and Nuveen
grabs 1.29% of nav. That seems like a big portion of the bonds' distribution.

http://www.etfconnect.com/select/fundpages/muni.asp?MFID=3887

Anyway, just some of the stuff that stopped me last night. Perhaps I need a
little more time to consider how I'm looking at these things- maybe I need to
consider both risks and rewards more carefully, before I get comfortable
buying.

NCO - I use them as a trading vehicle. I basically watch the NAV and when it
stops falling and starts to rise and the discounts look good I buy. Generally
speaking I am not a big fan of leveraged CEF because if the NAV goes down and
they bump against the leverage limits things can get pretty painful.

Those CEF's trade just like stocks. There is no difference to a stock trade.
FWIW my broker charges one fee even if the trade happens to break down in
several lots as long as the trade get filled the same day (I use GTC
orders).All brokers I deal with do it this way (Interactive Brokers, ETrade,

Nemours & Co. (DD). They have a GMC seed division (Pioneer Hi-Bred
http://www.pioneer.com/web/site/portal/) that competes worldwide with Monsanto.

They did release this press announcement where they plan to grow their hybrid
seed business in particular in Mexico and Brazil.

Nice gain in NM. Congrats. GMK - I've liked it because it's the dominant
producer of packaged tortillas, and that food product is now a staple for more
and more Americans (USA people). I'd say the business is still intact, and that
the stock might recover in time.

I'll pass on it. I don't like that I'm getting beat up with food company stocks
I have that suddenly announce that they have derivative or option or future
exposure. I bought these food companies because I believed they would be slow
growers and not become risky investments because of hedging operations. Perhaps
a majority of food producers have to hedge (but big-time?), and I'm only aware
of it now because the amounts and surrounding issues are so big that they've
become material.

I sold at losses, Brazil's http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SAD (<span
style='font-size:11px'>LAST</span>: 6.46<span style='font-size:11px'>
12/18/2008 1:50:42 PM</span>) , and recently Mexico's dominant chicken producer
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IBA (<span style='font-size:11px'>LAST</span>:
13.978<span style='font-size:11px'> 12/18/2008 1:35:22 PM</span>) , after each
announced their earnings would be substantially affected (lower) because of
their attempted hedging operations.

In the current market environment, I'll look elsewhere. GMK might work for
you/others though, once GMK (or IBA or SAD or others) get past current
troubles, and if they don't mess up the next time (I assume there's a next
time) they try these financial machinations. GMK a low, low priced stock -
almost like a perpetual call option bet.

GMK - I am in. Total losses on Sept. 30 were only about 15% of tangible book
(28Pesos/share). Book value per ADR is about 8.5$. If it weren't for the
derivative stuff, the balance sheet would not look bad with about 50% equity.

They did announce that they got a loan for the derivative payments in Y2008, so
i assume that the possibility of an imminent collapse is small. So now the
question is how much worse did the derivative losses get since Sept. 30. They
are certainly higher now also it may help a little that the MXN Peso did bounce
back.

FWIW this is a stable business that got into trouble because their were
spekulating <g> in derivatives. I am thinking that based on the numbers I am
seeing that this company should survive and hopefully become a nice stable
business again. I am in for a few lottery tickets in GMK.

I think a good LT play is BG, but it has run up beyond where I consider it a
buy (sub 40). It is currently trading at BV and at 5.5x FCF, but this was based
on the FCF for the past year.

I have been trading it some, buying at 36-37 and selling in the mid-to high
40s.

I think you are correct that it may still be too early for some of the pure ag
stocks such as ANDE and CDZI, not to mention foreign plays such as CRESY.

I think the fertilizer companies have also run up beyond where they might be
bought on a valuation basis.

SYT is a great company, one with excellent long term appreciation potential
IMO, but I can't justify buying it on a valuation basis alone here.

WMB and EEQ -

bought some WMB today on the late day swoon at 13.35$. Decently valued and
managed Pipeline, midstream and NG company. Well NG is low but WMB is a fairly
low cost producer and the pipeline and Midstream business earns good cash even
at lower NG prices.

EEQ, the IRA friendly sister stock of EEP (paying stock dividends instead of
cash, so no K1). Current yield is 16$ and the stock has found a bottom at 24$
before so i am hoping it holds. Not the best pipeline MLP but not the worst
either. Large project outlays caused some fear I think but the recent equity
injection (500M$ @30$/unit) should have alleviated those concerns. Decent BBB
credit rating. EEP/EEQ is mostly fee based business (transporting crude) so
their is not much pricing exposure. This is for yield hogs and risk are
moderate, IMO.

Ive now found something even more shocking- an experienced derivative money
manager named Markopolis pretty much did the sec work for them and alerted he
SEC to the Madoff fraud in a detailed report in 20005. He specifically referred
to it as high probability ponzi scheme with a small probability of it being a
front running scheme benefiting from inside information. He revealed enough red
flags to merit a full scale investigation in my view, and there should be a
full scale investigation by congress as to what went so terribly wrong at the
sec that they werent able to hit the side of a barn when pointed in the right
direction. i read the report at talkingpoints.com. At this point whatever
little confidence I had in the SEC as an enforcement body is gone. I mean its
great that they nailed martha stewart for inside trading, but they have missed
the boat on every major problem in the past 10 years.

The SEC is a Federal Agency. I work for one. Almost every Federal Agency I know
of is nothing but a welfare program. With EEO and other obstacles the
Government imposes on these Agencies, the have a mandate to bring up and
promote uneducated workers and minorities from within. At least 35% of the
workforce at these agencies should stay home and the Government should mail
them a paycheck bi-weekly. That would certainly increase productivity as these
people not only don't produce, but they actually hinder the productive efforts
of those who try to accomplish something.

Job announcements at the SEC are a joke. What they are looking for in terms of
qualified applicants won't apply because salaries are higher sweeping floors
and cleaning toilets for union workers.

I can tell you stories that would spin your head around. We have a guy who puts
in his hours as 40 per week. He teleworks from home 3 days 11 hours a day and
comes to office 1 day for 7 hours. He uses those 7 hours to file EEO complaints
about mistreatment. When the Supervisor responds to EEO complaints, they get no
backing from high level management.

Bottom line was the employee got a monetary award. The award was for :

Water Stocks - CALIFORNIA WATER SVC (NYSE: CWT) continues to hit new highs
while other water companies are at or near their lows (AWK,SWWC, HOO). Do any
of these companies (or other water companies) provide a value proposition to
you? Everybody needs water but many of these companies still appear to be
priced at the high end.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AWK,WTR,CWT,AWR,SJW,SWWC,HOO&d=s

S J W CP (NYSE:SJW) is one I have followed for a long time but the common
dividend was never really that good. Maybe there are preferred shares in some
of these companies that might provide a good yield and the safety of municipal

I too did my time as a gubmint employee, and I agree that it's frustrating.
However, right now count your blessings. You have a secure job in an economy
that has reached a level of insecurity we haven't seen in decades.

Plus, if you started around when I did and you didn't do something stupid when
they tried to switch everyone into Social Security, you have a good pension
with good health insurance, and you can retire before you're 60.

I agree and will stick around till I can go. Some features of Government
employment do offer stability. I have a good health insurance plan with B/C B/S
but the premium increase for 2009 was alot while the benefit reductions are
significant. This will offset our 3.9% raise for 2009. Increased taxes are
another issue and anyone who believes that 95% of all workers will get a tax
cut better start reading Obama's lips.

I expect when all is said and done and the 2009 raise becomes effective, that
my net pay will decrease.

One good thing is the TSP which I've had in the G fund for 21 years with a 5%
of salary Government match. That alone gives me a 33% yield on a safe special
issue of Government bonds that never lose principal, but yield about 3.5%.

Water Stocks: Here are my domestic choices (i.e. in which I have shares): WTR,
MWA, and the remaining shares of CWT.

Too slow on PICO, I missed my chance at lower prices. Still have an open order
in for some at a bunch of points lower.

I don't know international http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=HOO , I'll look at it.
For overseas I have shares in Brazil's http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SBS . No
dividend, but a very low p/e there. Not paying close enough attention I missed
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=VE . Again, I have an open order at much lower
price ($24.5), if it'll ever get back there.

I've no interest in AWK (erratic dividends?), but I am interested in AWR, which
has something like 53 (?) years of consecutive dividend increases (wow!). The
yield is not so great,but might work for me in a marginable portfolio if/as I
weigh jacking up my risk profile.

Water stocks - AWK just had the secondary, so I wonder why you think the
dividend is erratic. FWIW they just announced a secondary, so they may be a
good entry point if there is overhang.

All US waters stocks seem fairly expensive compared to other utility like
sectors (pipelines, gas & electric utilities).

Apparently only trading in its present form since this year and that's why only

"The deals of recent years mean these industries are more concentrated and

Concentration helps but companies with high debt load keep on churning stuff
out as long as it is cash flow positive since they cannot afford to shut down
without going under. Indebted industries exhibit less rational pricing as a

They may have looked like value stocks when they originally got put on watch,
but I no longer plan to keep monitoring them, Hopefully I'll come across some
new ideas to replace those removed.

So far a sustainable market advance looks very iffy. The only thing that has

HUN - what do the value folks here think about that one? A mediocre chemical
company with a bad balance sheet. They were supposed to be taken private but
that deal failed due to the credit crises and Hexion and their banks getting
cold feet. However they get a 1B$ in cash (250M$ thereof as a convertible @7%
interest rate through a settlement with Hexion and they now have even better
hand to settle with the banks. Now HUN total market cap is only 800M$ and their
tangible book value (pre settlement) 1.4B$. HUN sure looks cheap although I
expect some pretty crappy operation results for the next few quarters.

Opinions welcome.
