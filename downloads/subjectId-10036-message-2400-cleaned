Words of wisdom from a value investor with a great track record. I saw this
gentleman speak last year and was reviewing my notes on his lecture for a
discussion I was having with Mike privately. I thought this might interest the
group, though I will not use the investor's name because I do not have his
permission. You have never heard of him, but that's only because he does not
seek the spotlight.

Advice on finding good value investments.
1. Go where the grass is not trodden down. i.e. don't look at the stocks
everybody else is looking at. Don't compete with smart people, compete with
dumb people.
2. Stay within your "circle of competence"
3. Think honestly about how many other people have probably done this same
analysis. i.e. if you got it from the Wall Street Journal or a Wall Street
research report, you're probably not the first one to figure this out and there
may be something you're missing.
4. If the stock is recently up a lot, it means a lot of other people got there
first. Look for a flat line, left for dead chart pattern.
5. When you tell other investors you're buying something and they make a face,
you know you're on the right track. Learn to recognize that face and to
understand what it means.
6. Primary research. Talk to the company and get to know the product. Everybody
already knows what's written in the paper.
7. Always go through the proxy with a fine toothed comb. Consider carefully
who's in charge, who owns the stock and what their motivations might be.

I make my biggest mistakes when I forget this simple, but very difficult to
follow, advice.

Excellent analysis on CREAF! Nice job, particularly the concrete reference to
Mr. Philip Fisher. When analyzing companies, rarely do journalists attempt to
educate the reader regarding general investing fundamentals as they apply to a
specific stock. Frequently the writer's deference is necessary toward another
authority (you toward Fisher, in this case) and it is necessary for the writer
to check his ego at the keyboard. Few can get over that hurdle as easily as you

I'm buying more WHX this week and I put my mother into it (I think long and
hard before doing that because she makes me feel much more guilty than my boss
does if a stock goes down!) The market price is 13 1/4. Book value is roughly
$25 and its as real as book value gets. Earnings are about to turn very
positive, and with the share count way down from the last time earnings were
positive, EPS could be well over $2 a share.

Once again, the market price is 13 and change. What that means is that there is
somebody willing to take the other side of that trade and sell this stock to me
at half of book value. Do they know something I don't? So far all the only
negative I have heard is that the steel business is crappy. I know that. And
believe me, I have no desire to buy steel assets unless they are being given

James,

Not to disagree with you on WHX because BV is likely understated if anything. I
feel caution is necessary when referring to earnings. Past earnings have been
sporatic and the pre-strike earnings did not indicate major strength. Two
factors work against them: most steel companies are not reporting substantial
profit growth in spite of not having WHX as a competitor and Wheeling must
convince customers to leave current suppliers and come back.

Much of the BV was generated thru past earnings and recent sales of assets, not
recent year earnings.

The stock is definitely undervalued on an equity basis but they are also
issuing another $350M of debt that brings their debt to asset level over 50%.

I'm not arguing against buying, just urging caution. To quote a post on another
thread, 'not to look at a stock with rose colored glasses'.

Lot's a luck,
Ron

I took a very quick look and decided to pass - on the casual observation that
at the current price it did not look particularly
undervalued relative to past pre-strike valuations, considering the effect of
recent losses on the balance sheet. I may or may not
be correct, but that is always a key issue with a value stock.
How does the current valuation compare with previous ones for this company and
its industry, and is there any catalyst to change the perception? (Obviously it
would be worth knowing what price the company paid for the recent repurchases,
as this would be a good measure of where insiders see value.)

James,

Ignore my words of caution. I can't control my own irrational exuberance and am
a poor one to caution others.

You posted a very good piece of investing wisdom last week. I'd like to add
something I'm learning the hard way. If you have a loser, get rid of it and put
the money to work in something with more potential.

I held a turn around company (or so I thought) thru 2 quarters before I was
convinced the losses were poor management giving seemingly plausible excuses.
Companies with a track record of success can have obstacles to overcome (like a
labor strike) but will get back on track. Companies that lose will probably
continue to lose.

WHX was a profitable company and will be again. They are to be commended for
the actions they took during the strike to minimize the impact on shareholders
and for holding out against conditions that would have reduced their ability to
compete. There is little doubt that the share value will substantially increase
as soon as they begin showing profits.

I'm just too impatient to make the investment.

For what it's worth,

Mike,

See DSWLF thread. It has a lot of garbage on it from me, but there's some very
knowledgable people on it.

Purely conjecture - NamTai owned a large amount of DSWLF and they've been
raising cash by selling off the stock. The price showed slight weakness to
18.75 on low volume before the earnings release. After the release it ran up to
19.50 on a slight increase in volume, then suddenly plunged to 17.50 on high
volume. It appeared to me that a market maker had timed a sale of stock with
the earnings release. Would have had a group of buyers lined up.

This is the only way I can account for the sudden drop and extremely high
volume against the earnings report.

This company has been showing 60% growth every Q!! Price down due to Asian
selloff, but everything that's happening is beneficial to Deswell. I have been
acquiring and it's now a huge part of my holdings. Also have the DSWWF
warrants. Two Ws entitle a buy on one share for 9.00. Generally sell at a 10%
premium. Right now stock is better value on growth, risk, and for dividends
($1.00 and likely to go higher as they pay a percentage of earnings)

MB, BTW great thread. I'm a long time lurker and appreciate the good FA here.
I've got a few stocks I'm looking for turn arounds in that I feel have good
fundamentals - UGLY and INVN.

UGLY sells used cars. Their revenue this last qtr increased 150% c/w last
year's qtr, but they had a one time charge of $6MM for switching to a new loan
servicing program(??). First call estimates 30% long term growth and they have
the lowest PE since the co's history (14). Plus, they announced a 1 MM share
stock buy back program last month.

INVN makes explosives detection equipment for airports. They recently blew out
earnings over 50% above estimates for this qtr. No debt and also at the lowest
PE since their IPO. Long term growth estimated at 35%.

Both stocks have been in free fall lately and are making new 52 week lows. What
do you think? (I don't own either stock, yet.)

It is falling even
more today to 10 1/2. A 5% one day fall on
only 80 grand in trading dollars on a 200 million
dollar stock. There are
just absolutely no buyers out there, but there
are hardly any sellers left either. If it hits
$9/share (discount to book) I'm in. The margins
are better than most in the industry, and the
quick ratio of 8 is phenomenal given the industry. I like the fact
that it is growing while only incurring an 11%
debt/equity, and still has a lot of cash on hand.

Even better, it has announced a buyback. I like to see that, especially after a
misunderstood
earnings report. I don't see anything in a two-second review of the income
statement that is both bad and recurring.

Overall, not a bad idea. Typically, I can throw out ideas in less than a

Thanks for the reasoned response. After more DD and reading other inputs, I'm
not that impressed with INVN. They are backlogged to the tune of $47MM, their
CT machines are expensive and are time intensive for busy places like airports,
and the future for prospective customers is uncertain. More of a speculative
play.

If UGLY shows technical strength, such as going up on some increased volume or
even just plateaus, I'm in if I can get some $$$ freed up.

Mike, what is your take on the dd's as a sector and some specific co's? Selling
sure seems overdone, but is it over? Jumped too quick on QNTM at 30. Thinking
about HMTT if they level off. They announced a big deal with IOM (who's
business is booming and is bucking the tech wreck trend) and beat earnings

I have very little extra insight into the disk drives as

now. So much so that I got two limit orders on Quantum filled in the
last two days - one at 27 3/8 and one at 25 1/2. I put them in a long
time ago as GTC orders thinking I'd never see these prices. I have
friends in the disk drive industry that are jumping on
Seagate stock now. Western Digital has been punished the
most. But Quantum is the most diversified and has the
biggest commitment to R&D. The way to look at these
stocks is as Ken Fisher Super Stocks IMO.

Out there, my favorite buys right now remain Telebras,
Quantum. Seagate had good relative strength today. I would
buy at 22 if it gets there. Note that Creative Technologies has been
showing incredible relative strength during this sell-off.
It has been criticized as a momentum stock, but as
my Investor article points out, there is value there too,
and it seems to be holding up. I also bought Deswell
Industries at 17 5/8 a few days ago. Now I'm fully invested,
with overweighted positions in Micron Electronics and
Telebras - I bought more Telebras today at 85 and 87.

Seagate is likely undervalued more than it appears. They have a major holding

is the leader in flashcard tech and sales. They also hold interests in other
companies and, if memory serves me right, they have on the books at cost.

I'm not jumping into anything either, but I've been doing a lot of research to
build a list of beaten down stocks with potential. When this market breaks, if
it does, I want to have a list of buys ready. I'm looking for market plays
based on value because I feel they will be the first to recover. Sending broker
some fresh money I had in reserve and it's been a while since I used my margin
account.

I doubt very much if you were beaten down any worse than I was (15%). I had 60%
of my holdings international, much of it in HongKong. My answer was to sell my
US holdings and buy more of the HongKong based stock (DSWLF). My thinking is
that I know the company well, it's solid, it's selling off for the wrong
reasons, I was willing to buy at the higher level, why not take the opportunity
to average down when it's cheaper? I had 9 stocks, I now have 3 and I'm happy.

I don't feel we should run scared. I sold good stocks that would gain back the
10% or so they lost in favor of stocks that will gain 50% or more when the
market recovers.

INVN - I'm looking at it because of Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and all the new
publicity on terrorism. It looks like they have the premium product for
explosives and related detection for airports and other susceptible sites. They
were losing monies in development and are now starting to show profits. They
sell in $US and they've fallen to half of earlier price.

Two things I noticed in looking at Hyde's 10Q very quickly. 1- They have $50M
in inventory and receivables which is about 26 weeks of sales. 2- Their net
profit margin is about 1.5%. The inventory and receivables may make the balance
sheet look attractive but it may not be solid, especially with winter knocking
at the door. I don't know what the running shoe trade is like but if product
can be returned for credit then I would view these amounts as a yellow flag.

You are 100% correct. With all manufacturers we have to

not all solid. I like Jan Bell Marketing's balance sheet
better, but I like Hyde's potential better. In Hyde's
case, you have a net net with 20+% revenue growth. And
in Jan Bell's case you have a better balance sheet and
solid cash flow, but no growth.

I can't decide which is better, so I just bought both.
Hyde at current prices is less a steal than when I first bought
it at 4 1/11. But I did add to my position at the 5 bid

Re Buffett and Book: I read a clip somewhere that said about one of the authors
who is described in adverts. something like "a friend of the family for 30
years" - that actually Warren Buffett wouldn't recognize the man if he saw him
(Warren not having actually met or talked with the gentlemen apparently).

Of course Buffett is well followed or at least commented upon by this thread.
Buffett is so secretive about much of his work, that it's pretty hard to
categorize and be sure exactly what he does -- especially now that he must (I
assume) deal with large cap stocks. If Buffett is a unique, true genius when it
comes to investing, and if his results cannot be reasonably or easily
duplicated by others who follow what they perceive as his methods, then perhaps
it is more profitable to emulate methods and people who are able to show us The
Way. Like Graham.
(Uh, that being said, I will admit that my largest position and greatest gains
have come from purchasing one particular stock after reading that Buffett
purchased it, and after I came to believe Buffett inadvertently publicized his
holding of it.)

Buffett is God. If value investors discount him for being "not value anymore"
they're stupid. Learn from him. I try to combine his style with my affinity for
Ben Graham. Occasionally, just occasionally, you find an "almost Buffett"
business at an "almost Graham" price. Those you jump on. In a market with so
few cheap stocks, I think you can't be too rigid. Sure, you look for stocks
selling well below what they're worth. But you need to be able to do many
different kinds of valuations. Graham did it one way (which Buffett certainly
knows how to do - Graham was his teacher), but Buffett teaches you different
lessons. Never refuse to listen to anybody who is worth $25 billion dollars. I
call my style "somewhere between Graham, Buffett and Lynch". I hope my results
are too.

My two cents on Buffett:

Reading both Graham and Fisher has helped me understand Buffett's
approach much more than I did just from reading American Capitalist
and the annual reports. I guess I took the same approach Buffett
did, studying Graham first, then reading Fisher. Now, every one
of Buffett's purchases make sense from a value perspective, if
not a strict Graham value perspective. The fact that he has NEVER
had a down year over such a long period of time while averaging something like
28% returns is the only proof needed that he's the greatest investor ever.

Now, can we apply his methods? I'm not sure. I mean, Buffett, despite
his hands-off approach, is not totally uninvolved in the management.
The newspapers are good examples, but it seems that all his businesses move to
new levels of achievement in terms of cash flow, returns
to shareholders, and cash flow after he's on board. Heck, I know
what would've happened if I'd bought the Buffalo newspaper - zippo.
Further the guy is a certified genius who's talent is in shareholder
returns. Would he have made a good neurosurgeon or psychiatrist? Not
necessarily. Should I expect to do as well as him without his specific talent?
Not at all.

To each his own talents. I'm just content to sit back and dissect
each move he's made now. I mean, his movement into bonds (zeroes
no less) was incredibly prescient. Throughout the huge 20 year run up in stocks
he held on, then makes a massive switch
to zeroes within months of the uncoupling of the stock and bond
markets. Wow.

I appreciate him greatly and, if I had followed his example of buying bonds, I
would have a lot more money now than I do have. I believe
that his best single piece of advice is to look at stocks as if you have
only 20 "chances" to spend in a lifetime, one for each stock. The point is to
wait for the one that is irresistibly attractive, perhaps only
one or two a year. I personally find that my results are seriously affected by
buying too many, too often.

Jeffrey Bash: I disagree with that advice, and I don't believe Buffett himself
follows it. His GEICO holds a bunch of securities, and every once in a while we
get glimpses of his personal portfolio which include a variety of stocks
different from his Berkshire holdings.
In EVERY SI thread where I see examples of whining and crying about stock
losses I believe I observe an overly concentrated portfolio. Also, if we all
waited for the perfect 20 pitches, I believe (just from the ownership of co's
we see here) that very few of us would even have a minority, let alone a
majority, of the same stocks. That means to me, that we would have mostly
different stocks and that we all can't be right. Therefore, many of us would
lose using this 20 ticket method (unless the market took us all too new highs,
in which case who cares if it's 10,20,30 or more). Buffett's advice regarding
this concentrating of ownership, IMO, is very dangerous to most investors. But
of course, Buffett might say---maybe.. so what else is new. The majority can't
beat an index fund; go with that. JMO. Paul Senior (I'm one to try to buy value

Paul,

While holding a diversified portfolio might protect against
loss, it limits one's ability to beat the market. In his book
Investment Psychology Explained, Martin Pring points out that
diversifying to only eight stocks takes about 90% of the situational risk from
a portfolio, and further diversification limits the ability
to produce superior returns at the same time you are increasing
exposure to market risks.

I'd have to go with Carnegie's advice to "put all your eggs in
one basket and watch it very closely." I think the big lesson
from Buffett is that the advantage individual investors have over institutions
and the S&P is that they can wait for the very best. The other major advantage
for individuals is they can hold indefinitely while not having to report to
anyone. Most individuals trade on a whim and frequently, thereby negating their
natural advantages and guaranteeing the majority will always be wrong.

Of course, I'm still only striving to follow this seemingly simple advice,
which indicates how against human nature it is, and how
those that can buy well and hold long are accomplishing something
few can. For this, they deserve extra returns.

Mike

James: If you appreciate Buffet, you will extol BUFFETOLOGY. My sense is that
Mary Buffet distils the confusion concerning his methodology, the
misunderstanding about his shorter-term holdings (which accounts for 25% of his
return over the years), his understanding of the stock of extraordinary
companies as an "equity/bond with an expanding coupon," a thorough explanation
of "business-like investing," how the magic of compounding is a pillar of his
philosophy, the "expanding intrinsic value," the necessity of a minimum 15%
return, the myth of diversification, his view of earnings, how the avoidance of
taxation for as long as possible is central to his methodology, how he no
longer quantifies a stock's intrinsic value. I think she explains very well the
differences between Buffet's methodology and pure Grahamesque value investing.

Mary has astutely written the book in two sections: qualitative, then
quantitative in an easy-to-understand format.

Thus far, after one complete reading, my only disappointment is her catty,
grossly abbreviated explanation of Buffet's sell strategy.

I'm hoping that some of the seasoned value investors, such as yourself, that
frequent this thread will read the book and dialog about it.

adequately answers that question in the affirmative.

As for Buffet never experiencing a bad year, Mary Buffet attributes his
shorter-term arbitrage plays as a primary factor. And, herein lies much of the
confusion about many of his stock picks.

John: I'll be back with a review. But the following from Chapter 3 of the book
seems to address your issues regarding how Buffett is perceived by the masses:
"One would think that anyone whose profession is investing would make Warren a
serious case study and analyze and dissect his philosophy. But the investment
profession and its academic brethren seem to prefer to label him a four-star
enigma, and pay essentially only lip service to his real gifts as an investment
genius.
What few people realize is that Warren is first and foremost a thinker, a
philosopher whose subject matter and realm of expertise are the world of
business. He is a man who has taken the investment and business philosophies of
some of the greatest minds that have addressed the subjects of commerce and
capital and synthesized an absolutely new approach based on these old lessons.
His approach is in many ways contrary to conventional Wall Street wisdom.

A bit long winded but I agree with the point that when we see something out of
the ordinary we tend to think that it is beyond our realm and choose not to
analyze it closely. It is somewhat of a fluke.
Like many on this thread I have read several books about Buffett and read his
anual reports to Berkshire sharholders.
He does speak in imageries that people tend to take literally and extrapolate
that his theories are impossible to put into practice. An example of this is
the 20-punch lifetime stock selection card.
We are all prone to the problems that Jeffrey Bash pointed out of buying too
soon and too often.
Buffett is an extremely patient and disciplined investor. He lives to the
letter Graham's tenet: "Investment is most intelligent when it is most
businesslike".

Buffet focuses on (1) what to buy, and (2) at what price.

Mike: re diversification: Well I'm with Graham on this. I say diversify. I say
this as a person knowing of the academic discussions regarding numbers of
stocks for an 'optimally' diversified portfolio. (The numbers I see are
generally larger than 8 but less than 20.) Such academic numbers don't take
account of the reality of investing IMO.
Furthermore, I think the oh-so-standard line that academic concentrationists
take --diversification prevents market out performance --is not thought through
nearly enough for real world use. For example, we've seen sector breakdowns
(healthcare for example). A person wanting to invest here who already has
his/her 8 stocks, either has to have proportionately 1/8 or 1/9 cash avail. -
or go margin- or else has to sell one of the 8 stocks already in the portfolio
(assuming the person has and wants a balanced $ portfolio.) This means the
investor is either reducing performance by keeping large cash or what I think I
see more frequently playing off margin or playing "pig at trough" investing ("I
see a better stock so I push aside (dump) one of the ones not as strong"). So
there's this downside to concentrating a portfolio. (Risk being that now one
moves toward trading side of the continuum, away from Buffett/Graham.)
Mike, in all these discussions I am trying to understand my own proclivities
and balance them off what I see that works. What I think vs. what I see. I'll
give you concentrated portfolios ala M. Whitman, Torray, others. Buffett I
still say keeps or trades many more stocks than generally acknowledged I
believe. And just looking around SI, I only find ONE person with a concentrated
portfolio who is doing great compared to many who are crying. Maybe the fault
is with the people (too much tech?), but still... given that I want to see what
works...
diversification looks better than concentration. (And also from Pring... "Place
numerous small bets ... not more than 5% of your capital on any one trade",
p.217)

I'm a big Buffett fan but I recently looked at a 10 year graph of Berkshire
Hathaway on MarketPlayer I saw that Buffet has indeed averaged 28% p.a. return
but that includes some significant down years, as much as 25% or so.

BTW I posted what I thought was the most promising of a Buffett screen of
stocks (done on MarketPlayer) on this thread a few weeks ago. The company is
NCI Building Systems (BLDG). It looks like a totally typical Buffett purchase
but it drew no response whatsoever. Perhaps it'll be more popular when he buys
it .

Great post, Paul.

Those are exactly the practical problems of a concentrated
portfolio. Academics don't always translate into practice,
of course. Thanks for pointing that out. I've been running
a very concentrated (4-6 stocks) portfolio, but now am
moving to a 9-10 stock (goal) portfolio diversified across
industries. By diversifyin across industries, I am still
picking the best deal in each industry and therefore
running a concentrated portfolio with less risk. But the practical
problems that you mention are exactly what I deal with.

In the vein of natural talents, could it be that person A's natural
talent may be in a concentrated portfolio, person B's is in a
diversified portfolio, and that's the way it should be for
each to maximize his/her returns? "Know thyself and follow your

As for investors, I think the smart ones understand Buffett. Some others think
they do, but it is only an uninformed characiture. Other investors are
contemptuous, whether out of jealously or ignorance. They fault him for not
sticking to the value style, and they think he is just lucky.

I have read his chairman's letters many times, cover to cover, and I think the
man is a genius. He doesn't spout academic wisdom or investment wisdom. His
ideas are his own, and if some of them sound like conventional wisdom now, its

Paul,

I prefer BLDG to its competitors because it has a better margin and appears to
be more focused on increasing its market share.

I call it a Buffett stock because 1. It was identified in a "Buffett" screeen
that someone ran that seemed to be carefully thought out and happened to
identify Dairy Queen among 15 other stocks. Since Buffett bought Dairy Queen it
would seem that the fellow who built the screen did a credible job. 2. Steel
buildings seems like such an old, boring business that it just sounds like
something that only a true value investor could love. 3. Management at BLDG
includes founding members of the industry. They sold the company several years
ago, watched it flounder and then bought it back. Also, the Chairman (I'll
check if you wish, I'm just going by memory here) has considerable skill in
acquisitions. BLDG is continuously acquiring small businesses that increase
BLDG's capacity. I don't usually like companies that grow through acquisitions
but these guys do it without increasing debt or diluting stock, they generally
use cash.

I haven't bought any yet because I'd have to sell something else and I don't
think I have to chase BLDG right now. Anyway, that's what I've been able to
find out in the past few weeks. And while we admire Berkshire's 28% return over
time, BLDG's has been 40% over the past 6 years. I find that impressive for
such a "low tech" business.

I'm not sure if a mediocre or cyclical business would dissuade Mr. Buffett, but
I know that Peter Lynch likes to recommend well managed companies in boring
businesses in industries that are not growing quickly. BTW, I caught Peter
Lynch here in Toronto a few weeks ago (thanks to Scott Mc) and he was quite
entertaining but didn't say anything that isn't written in One Up on Wall
Street.

Others may have quite different takes on BLDG. There is a thread on SI. I'd
like to hear other sides while I'm just window shopping.

As I've once posted, some of these companies are like old girlfriends - they
pop back into your life in very surprising ways -g-.
Jeffrey, there is something not right to me about pig-in-trough investing but I
just can't articulate it quite right --but I'll try -g-: I've recently bought
Western Digital, LSI Logic, Fluor, and more of Applied Magnetics. I think
they'll work out (higher stock price)over the next couple of years. (And given
that we know that the big companies in the DD sector have been hard hit -
Quantum, Seagate, and WDC - -how much exactly do we have to know to make an
investment in this industry? I will defer here to Mike Burry's investment skill
and just give you that Quantum is the superior investment. To me the question
is should an investment be made at all - I say yes, and I figure if Quantum
rises, so will WDC at some point in this very competitive business in which
king of the mountain is by no means assured. So I'm comfortable with purchase
of WDC at current price vs. its fundamental numbers.)
And I would've bought a few more companies in other industries if their prices
hadn't bounced on Fri. Then there's the arbitrage play in those 2 Canadian
stocks mentioned here that I want to look at too. Next week there will be more
opportunities. If I have to weigh the next purchase against these most recent
and upcoming buys, I don't know how to evaluate it, because I can never be sure
what the time frame is for these stocks which I now own and think are
undervalued, to move to full value. Plus, my natural inclination is that the
last stock I buy is the greatest stock buy, so I have to temper that by not
succumbing to the idea that some of the stocks which I've owned for a while are
dogs (which they probably are -g-) and should be discarded poste haste for a
large position in my latest find. In my own case, a majority of my sales
recently have gone on to even higher prices so my decisions to sell and move to
other undervalued situations have not been so great it seems. Secondly, there's
something about turnover. If a person maintains 8-10 stocks but has turnover of
100% what does that mean? Churning, trading, lack of conviction, (brilliance?
-if the positions work out)?
Finally, there's the issue of portfolio $ value. Maybe a young person with just
$100k might want to go for 8 stocks plus an index fund, but for older and
bigger $ players, putting 1/8 or 1/10 of a portfolio into one issue has much
different consequences if the stock doesn't perform. JMO, Paul.
It would be interesting to see how or if people change as they invest. Buffett
apparently has moved from diversification to concentration. I've moved the
other way ... from just a few stocks to many. Mike B. says he's moving to a few
more but still concentrated. Wonder what others are doing.

John Langston: I'm just a formal kind of guy -g-. re s.t. trader and l.t.
trader. Well, if you think we're all traders, I guess you're right; at some
point we sell and buy something else. No reason why a person can't be both
long-term and short-term trader. Somehow though, the words trader and Buffett
don't seem to go together -g-. My belief is the conventional belief that
Buffett is a long-term holder. In one of his letters to stockholders, he said
he wouldn't just sell a mediocre investment in his portfolio of companies for a
better investment, so in that sense to me, he's not a trader. There's a mindset
there too, IMO. If one identifies oneself a trader, then one much more easily,
IMO, comes to the opinion that it's time to sell or sell and swap -- much more
easily than if one thinks of oneself as a Buffett follower, an investor, or a
holder. So how or where do you see yourself? Or maybe say again some stocks you
like and I'll figure it out (maybe).
My opinion is that that short-term traders are stupid, idiot, adrenalin
addicts. However, it has recently come to my attention that I myself might be a
stupid idiot because of this view. (I heard a tape of Hulbert - he of the
Financial Digest - who said there are very excellent performance records of
people who espouse short-term trading). Figured I better see for myself, so I
signed up for a subscription. Good Trading, Paul.

I am an older and bigger dollar investor who is very experienced, with highly
developed analytical and risk evaluation skills (due to my career).. I find
that only a small percentage of my "mistakes" are due to getting blindsided and
that most are due to minding too many stores
without full attention. And I can do this full time, use modern EDP
resources, and often have access to mgmt.

I stick with what I said in my prior post. I am trying to reduce the number of
positions and control the risk by spreading around unrelated industries and
companies. If I were not OK with the potential loss from a single investment in
a fewer stock portfolio,
I would add index funds, fixed income, increase cash, or select larger,
more stable companies - rather than double the number of individual stock
holdings..

Re: Portfolio Management, WDC/QNTM, APM

<<If a person maintains 8-10 stocks but has turnover of 100% what does that
mean?>>

With such a concentration at the heights of a raging, volatile
and possibly crumbling bull, turnover doesn't mean much to me.
If the reason is that stocks are being knocked down 30-70% all
around him/her, then it is logical.

Now, if a person is selling solely because a stock is falling, then
that is an indication of trading, churning, and lack of conviction
as a result of lack of due diligence in the first place.

Personally, when I sell to make moves into other stocks, I sell
the stocks that haven't moved either up or down. My hope is that,
systematically, I will be leaving stocks that are on avg inherently
less volatile and with little market correlation. In this way,
I am maximizing my chances of returning at the same value price
at a point in the future when that stock becomes the best relative
value. If one of my stocks falls, like MUEI, TBR, QNTM, and HYDEA
all did recently, I average down by selling one of the "quiet" stocks. After
all, a good value just got better and I want
to take advantage. Turnover can be high, but I see reason in this.

Re: WDC/QNTM; I took my off WDC for a bit and then I see it
at 19. Good price. If I had a diversified portfolio I would
probably have bought it. Having looked into it pretty extensively,
and owing to my diversify-across-sectors strategy, I only need one dd.
Quantum at 25-27 fits the bill as the single best idea, but
WDC at 19 or SEG at 21 are both definitely good ideas.

Re: APM, from what I understand, the current balance sheet and
cash flows and all are threatened with extinction due to
a paradigm shift within the industry that's moving manufacturers
away from APM. There is huge speculation whether APM's management
can pull it off. If not, there is question whether APM can
survive. Paul, could you describe why an investment in
APM is not speculation? Not being critical; just want to learn
more since it looks so good numbers-wise and I do not understand
the situation perfectly.

Paul: I've been studying short-term trading for three years. I've looked at
numerous approaches. I use Pitbull (a variation of CANSLIM) for short-term
trading, long and short (short-term meaning my average hold-period is 5-1/2
weeks). It works well. I have a friend here in Houston that is a very
successful CANSLIM investor who owns more than 100 stocks. He buys stocks
making "new highs" with the intention of never selling them unless he is forced
to. I couldn't do that. I can't bring myself to make a long-term commitment to
a stock without using some form of value approach. And, I see the need for
long-term investments. I am trying to learn the best method for picking solid
long-term holdings.

I DON'T believe that "we are all traders." Most on this thread are "investors,"
and I try not to interject any short-term perspectives out of respect for those
who are here. I read notes on this thread daily, trying to learn.

Mr. Buffet participates in shorter-term (not short-term by usual standards)
arbitrage plays. I'm interested, but unknowledgeable about this area. So, I
stick with the short-term plays that I feel comfortable with. If I were to
discard one or the other, it would be short-term trading. I'm not ready to to
that.

I understand your concern about "mindset." To do what I intend will take
discipline, and granted, maybe more savvy than I can muster. (g) But, since
I've seen others do it, I'm confident that I can also. I have an acquaintance
who runs a hedge fund who adheres to several strategies concurrently and is
very successful doing so. Hopefully, I'm not barking up the wrong tree. I do
know that it won't take very long to find out. (g) I don't claim to be in the
same league with Erick Van Waggoner. (g)

Okay I had my say on diversification. Graham says 10 to about 30 issues. That
would let everybody (else-g-) on the thread nod their approval. Anybody want
less, they can get confirmation from Loeb ("The Battle for Investment
Survival", p. 118) for one or perhaps 2 or 3.

Mike, APM certainly is a risk. There is a new technology and APM is behind in
incorporating it. 6 weeks ago, this was seen as a positive (older tech more
profitable); now, and with the price halved, it's a terrible negative - or so I
read. Well APM has qualified this new technology with 2 customers - this was
reported in the last quarterly. My bet is that if they qualify, they have the
money and resources and flexibilty and will actually be able to manufacture to
customer requirements. After all, this isn't a regulated business -- these
people exist in a tough competitive environment (which indeed has seen more
then one company go down.) If there is a paradigm shift, then from what I can
tell all competitors will be at ground zero. I am betting that APM will get its
share of the customers' business.
Any concern over the Asian market for computers is, IMO, overdone. A computer
will be or is, a must for parents trying to provide education for their kids.
Furthermore, DD's are mechanical - they do wear, so there's replacements,
upgrades...lots of good stuff. Of course for APM there's competition, ramping
up mfg. problems, few but large customers (and at some point this is a positive
as I would guess the customers would not like to see their supplier base (APM)
diminish (APM go bankrupt)), and maybe even more problems the Market or I don't
now see. So the next quarter or two isn't going to be so great. Co. has earned
good money before and IMO will do so again. 4-5 quarters from now the stock
should be at a good place compared to today's price. So, for the way I invest
(or keep telling myself I would like to invest -g-)... a small position in APM
in a well diversified portfolio, held for the long term, maybe avging down more
as tax selling, fear, etc. drive the price even lower... should work out okay.

Paul - Your remarks on APM make sense. However, I made a point on that thread
several months ago. The stock never traded over 20 until a year ago, or over
about 15 until 2 years ago. I was concerned that if the recent improvement in
results was an aberration, the stock could return to its historical trading
range. (I have neither knowledge or opinion on the fundamentals.)

Jeffrey Bash: re APM. Retesting lows doesn't affect my ruling reason for buying
the stock (or so I am telling myself -g-). It's possible that the price could
indeed regress to its mean trading price of that time. If stock remains within
range you suggest, then I would be concerned. But with much higher computer and
disk drive sales now, my expectation of this higher sales volume continuing and
the new management team in place, I am betting that there will again be larger
profits (than in past years) and a different and a higher trading range in
place. Now if I can just hold on for 6 quarters to get through the valley to
that higher range -g-.

Darth: re YOUR style: Well you must be carrying a lot of ammo for your
six-shooter. Maybe you only own now and always a few stocks, but with your pick
of the week and numerous stock selections, I'd guess the number of different
stocks you buy/sell in a year is very high indeed. Or you do not purchase the
stocks you recommend? Or your portfolio is way unbalanced (Didn't you say 75%
was in WHX?), so a small amt is for trading?
Jeffrey Bash says its best to remain focused (not diversify) because it's not
possible/practical to follow so many stocks in the detail required. That makes
sense to me (but its not my way.) If you argue against diversification, you
want to focus ("if aim is good, don't need diversification"), but then you
follow and recommend rat-tat-tat so many stocks... I am bewildered as to what
your reasoning is or the depth of research you require for these purchases. Ah

Actualy I rarely have more than 5 or 6 sotcks in my portfolio at one time. My
picks of the week are more of an exercise then anything else.
WHX was at one point 75% of my port. but that is a very rare situation that
doesn't come along too offten. A typical holding period for me is in the 2-4
month range so yes I do make a lot of trades over the year. As to why I put the
time into so many stocks is simple I like to have a nice shoping list ready for
when I sell something.
Stocks I'm in or may be buying from a value point are

APM we all know about this one

SFC ditto

BATS trading near book, 10x this years earnings, and 7x next

QUIP undervalued and a real posibility for a takeover

TK Oil shipping Co that could benifit from the move from asset pricing to

Paul, I can agree with your post 2481. I am a small investor with 8-10 stocks
that makes up 70% of my portfolio, the rest is in indexed mutual funds. This
limits me to about 8% in any one stock. I feel that this limits my risk at a
time when I need to conserve my limited capital. Once I have built up my
holdings to the larger status (over 1/4M) I will probably move more to mutuals.
Currently I am in highly speculative issues trying to make something happen.
But I also like to short term trade with 3-4 issues with a target of 15%
profit, after commissions. I have been failrly successfull while holding these
issues for only 60-90 days, implying a much larger annual profit. While the
volitility of my portfolio swings 8-20% a month, I am 25 years from retirement
and don't worry about these monthly swings. Annaulized I am still doing
something right by making 15-17% a year. Less than an index fund but i am
learning as I go, and should improve over time! I am also learning about many
industries and how they cycle. Currently I am in technology, biotechs, oil&
gas, software, new technologies, mining, medical, and entertainment areas. I
see no reason that I can't follow this many areas. Also note that while the
market lost 5% in October, my portfolio went up 8%!

Wink: Well you agree with me but somehow this agreement makes me want to move
to Jeffrey Bash's view -g-. Seems like you follow a lot of areas, but for the
purpose of dancing in and out them. You're a short term trader in speculative
stocks in complicated areas. Sigh... but if such methods work for you over an
extended time period, then you must have the skills, flexibilty, etc. I'll find
out more as I read through Hulbert's review of newsletters that apparently do
this successfully also. It seems like you are spending the time and effort to
learn about a lot of industries (which is IMO do-able and which I think I try
to do), but then you go and shoot for 15% profit (which seems too small, given
the expenditure of effort). However, it's not possible for me to argue with
success (your success). So I will argue for failure (not yours):

I personally for young people encourage stock market failure. The quicker and
more severe the better.

For example regarding biotechs. Standing back, it's pretty straightforward to
see that it's a complicated, risky business, wherein the cash in the till of
some of these companies gets burned up real fast. At least one other chap -
besides Dr. Burry - has posted here within past few days and has an MD. THEY do
not recommend biotechs or THEY are very cautious about them. So where's the
edge for us "civilian" investors or even speculators. It ain't there. So the
smart thing to do is draw that Circle of Competence (idea ala Klarman?
Buffett?) and exclude this area from your indvidual stock purchases. HOWEVER,
the only way to really KNOW this and DO this (exclude biotechs) is IMO to buy
or speculate on a few "good" biotechs and lose heavy and lose hard. That's how
the stock market learning finally gets internalized for most of us.
Of course these are my opinions only. If you've had great success or have
relative success over a long period...my hat's off to you. (I want to say
you're very lucky; Hulbert may say it's not just luck.)

Of all the money managers who participate in Barron's Year End Roundtable, IMO,
the individual who brings the most to the table is Michael Price. "The scariest
SOB on Wall Street" is known as a value investor and someone who takes
advantage of special situations. I just read a short interview with Price. What
does he like?

DJ - while he's mum on his plans for DJ's board, he does believe there is
$70-80 in assets there.

GM - ditto. He believes there's real value in the "H" shares.

UMG - that's US West Media Group - says he loves it.

COL - claims to have his eye on this one, although he does not own any now
(considers it too pricey).

Price also said that George Soros took a big haircut in WMX because he bought
too high. Seemed to enjoy the fact that Soros took a beating more so than

Paul - I gave up on direct biotech investments a long time ago. No way that
could be within my circle of competence. However, there are other ways to skin
that cat.

For example, you could buy a supplier of instruments to the industry (like
Thermo Bioanalysis - which I own, but not a "value" stock), or a company doing
unique things with existing drugs (like Sepracor), or unique screening
technologies (like Affymetrix), without having to have the "impossible-to-have"
knowledge about the merits of various drugs of various companies in various
stages of the FDA approval process.

An interesting anecdote, a la Peter Lynch, about buying companies in your own
backyard where you have personal experience. I used to work for an insurance
company which provided health benefits to Amgen from its inception. I had
access to information on how the employee count was growing by leaps and bounds
but unfortunately never drew an investment conclusion.

So, you do not always need to know the drugs to invest in this industry.
