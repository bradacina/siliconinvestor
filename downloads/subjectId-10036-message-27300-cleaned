LLTC. Decided to start a few share buy of LLTC. I like those high and maybe
sustainable profit margins. (And although the price a stock buyer now pays for
each of those profitable sales dollars is high, it's not high enough to
dissuade me, based on my purchase criteria.)

I hate when that happens, doug5y!

Of course counting your blessings, you have at least two here. A gain of better
than 60% captured since your late '06 purchase. And you may have the
satisfaction of doing better than value investor M. Prabai, who exited his
position earlier at lower prices.

As I say, I'm a proponent of partial sales. To me, it's more psychologically
comforting if I sell partially and the stock then drops ("Oh well, I got a lot
of the gain at the higher price") or if it then rises ("Oh well, I've captured
something, and I'm still in for more of the ride."), than having sold all and
completely missing something very positive. Which is a "I hate that" outcome
vs. the "Oh well" outcomes.

Not saying I always make partial sales though.

I've had one recently where I just totally gave up after three years of
nothing, and the very next day the stock rallied. And that's not the first time
it's happened to me.

I tell ya, I can almost believe there really are trading gods who watch over us

Doesn't seem to have done much for the stock price today (or recently) though.

ACAS ought to look attractive now to S&P 500 funds that are interested or

Otoh, you do have a point. As you likely see, I am following a ton of stocks

me to be facts. So it is okay with me, and best for all of us, if readers
confront (my) errrors, misstatements, etc. on the thread.

So as regards ACAS, while I state ACAS is not doing well recently in spite of
receiving this soon-to-be S&P inclusion, if I actually go back (which I did
after I read you post), and check carefully, ACAS is up recently (not down)
(from late June, early July), and it is just from my perception looking at ACAS
from March & June highs, that ACAS is down recently.

Anyway, this seems to be turning into strange reply to your strange reply.
Maybe we should just move on. lol.

Banks. I'm concerned about the narrow bank spread rates. There's good
recognition of the vibrancy of ethnic communities (e.g. Korean, Chinese), and
as individuals and businesses grow financially, the larger banks, imo will come
in much stronger and be more attractive because they can offer better terms and
broader range of services. (just an opinion).

I'm nervous I'm overloaded with too many money center, regional, and local bank
stocks. I am considering only holding those regional and local bank stocks that
pay a relatively okay dividend (greater than CATY) or have a lower p/book, or
operate in an area I'm familiar with (VNBC).

Bluntly, I'm just scared.

ACAS was added to the S&P 500 on July 6. They replaced Dollar General.

"BETHESDA, Md., July 16 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- American Capital Strategies

selected American Capital to be included in the S&P 500 Index, effective after

approximately the 355th firm in size, based on market capitalization, within
the Index."

It sure has climbed since then, hasn't it? I haven't sold any shares and
actually bought some October 12.5 calls while they were still OTM at $0.65.
Sold 40% Friday for $2.50 and rebought some of those today at $2.10. Might buy
back the rest if it keeps fading a few more days.

There's only a 60-70 cent time premium on this one for calls that expire 3
months from now. Mind-boggling, especially in light of the way it's shown it
can sprint.

This is my second-largest holding (behind our parent company) and it's a WAY
larger position than what's in 3rd (probably ELN).

The calls are in my trading accounts so I'm not thinking all that long-term on
them and likely won't exercise them.

Normally in this situation (big position with big profits), I'd be writing
covered calls, but I don't like the price of the calls and what I perceive as
the likelihood of getting called out of my position too cheaply. And I really
like their idea of the 4th quarter dividend being a mystery amount and like the
chances of it being surprisingly high. And though I haven't dug thoroughly and
have no way of determining how much of their business went with their former
employees, the 15-cent dividend sure smacks to me of a bit of sandbagging so
they can be seen as knocking the cover off the ball in Q4.

Basell to buy Lyondell for about $12.14 billion

http://biz.yahoo.com/rb/070717/lyondell_basell.html?.v=5

Paul - You had this one back in 2006. Did you keep a stub position? I noticed
from your earlier posts that you had bought a starter position in February 2006
but sold out in September 2006.
You did a good job on finding value and like me it is difficult to determine
when and how much one should sell especially with a lagger. Sometime, I feel I
am the only one that recognizes the potential value in a company. Good job on
the pick but not such a good job on the sell strategy.

The moral is that it takes at least two good decisions to execute a profitable
trade. Also, it's another good reason to have those stub positions.

I have learned from you to now keep more stub positions in my portfolio. I am
still learning to refine my sell strategy and now unless there is really bad
news, I sell in 1/3 or more lots over time. I figured that I must have had a
good reason to buy at the time, so I should have an equally good reason to
sell.

I seem to have got this one completely wrong.

I believed I was pretty familiar with Lyondell - have known managers, something
of the business, markets, etc., and I felt the business was fairly valued at
low-mid $30's. Perhaps my knowledge was too outdated. Maybe they're now more
diversified now than I know. In past years they seemed to me too dependent on

believe however that the valuations are so low that smaller disappointments are
already baked in, so unless the bottom falls out of mortgages on a grand scale,
Bank stocks should do OK.

3 clips...

For most investors in general, selling the expensive asset, and buying the
cheap asset, seems like a logical strategy - except when you actually try to do
it. Because most people are actually not wired to be selling what's expensive
and going up, and buying what's cheap and going down.

I'm always much happier when stocks are trading at their 52 week lows than I am
at 52 week highs. It's simple: If you have a valuation discipline, then you
know that stock prices change more rapidly than business value... And that's
where people get into trouble, because they perceive risk to be high when
prices are low, and they perceive risk to be low when prices are high. That's
the psychological problem that most people have.

And, more importantly, a thoughtful individual investor doing a moderate amount
of homework can easily - and I emphasize easily - do better than the S&P 500.

PLUS looks like an interesting situation --- one might be able to buy some

Keith, no offense taken, I do agree that a PE of 20 for a company which is

reversion to the mean (as Paul would say), and that investor interest for a

trust will reconsider its position, given the stagnant stock price.

Should we discount assets more? Should we wait for another quarter to see how

Homebuilders. I don't trust that all the liabilities are so easily found that

Homebuilder stocks will turn up before the housing sector (house sales) turns

Paul,

took a quick look and noticed that they show assets of approx 5.3 million but a
closer review of the asset side show this:

Tradenames: 13,921

Goodwill: 2,879

so nearly 17 million of what they are considering as assets are intangibles
which when translated usually means they are worthless.

i HATE nearly worthless companies who post their goodwill <tradenames> as
assets. im not not the sharpest pencil in the holder - but this is a big red
flag for me.

take away their value for tradenames and goodwill and they are about 12 million
negative asset value.

also the debt issue from the last 8k is ominous:

Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On June 12, 2007, Steakhouse Partners, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into a
Forbearance Agreement (the “Agreement”) with the Class 4 Creditor Trust, which
was established pursuant to the Company’s Plan of Reorganization which was
confirmed effective as of December 31, 2003. Under the Agreement, the Company
is required to sell assets or secure financing to repay the Class 4 Creditors
Trust in full by November 15, 2007. The Company is also required to make
certain minimum payments as follows: (1) $2 million by June 30, 2007; (2) a
total of $3 million by August 31, 2007; and (3) a total of $5 million by
October 31, 2007. The Company is currently under contract to sell two
restaurant units to satisfy the June 30, 2007 payment. However, the contracts
remain subject to contingencies and there can be no assurances that such
transactions will be consummated.

looks like they can easily be forced into banruptcy by their creditors.

i will definitely watch developements from the sidelines.

do you recall my mentioning SYTE here?

Thanks for the quick response. I hadn't read the Material Definitive Agreement.
I view it as a very strong positive in the valuation of the company...if they
can sell two restaurants at prices anywhere near what's required to satisfy
their June debt obligation. If so, I'll not be concerned with the goodwill
category on the assets.

I don't have the belief that the stock price will hold gains over it's nav.

I'm not going to get the percentage gains you get. (It's only a small position

perspective, that's an okay trade off, because I don't have the risk of it
either.

If nav continues to grow as you have predicted/expect, and if stock price
remains below nav, I'm content to occasionally average up on the stock. Which
is what I've been doing.

The way I look at it, it is - or can be or could be - a win-win for both of us

The issue of diversification is very complex. I don't know that I have enough
knowledge to sufficiently discuss the many aspects that deserve to be
considered. Basically though, it comes down to I believe I am right and that
most everybody else is wrong about the subject -gg-. The key takeaway
conclusion for me is that to be "properly/sufficiently/optimally" (my quotes)
diversified in one's portfolio (my portfolios anyway) a shocking number of
stocks is needed. About 400.

(ref: AII Journal, Burnside, et. al. "How Many Stocks do You Need to be
Diversified?")

About the best article I've seen. In the sense it confirms and conforms to my
own experience -g-.

Their conclusion is that diversifiable risk (having a concentrated portfolio
when you don't have to), is "not consistently rewarded with higher expected
returns".

First of all, what are we trying to diversify from? It's generally not market
risk, because market risk is generally not diversifiable. More true today than
before, in that you can diversify among markets, but recently they mostly
(Euro/Asian/USA) fall together. Most academic studies focus on diversifying to
reduce risk, and that risk is measured by volatility. The reduction is measured
against a standard. Sometimes it's reducing risk (volatility) compared to
owning one stock which will fluctuate quite a bit. Sometimes it's being
diversified compared to a standard benchmark, like "the market". In this case,
to achieve the best diversification, stocks bought should be bought in size
related to the market cap of the stocks in the market. (e.g. you better own a
bunch of GE or other large cap. Your picks shouldn't be equal weighted.)

My idea has been different. Up until recently, it's not so much that I've
wanted to reduce risk by reducing volatility, it's that I've wanted to capture
the gains from the volatility while reducing business risk. Business risk can
be diversified (reduced). For example, VLO refinery could suffer major
shutdown, but with refinery stocks looking inexpensive still, that specific
business risk can be hedged by also buying and owning TSO. For me, why stop
with just one more? -g-. Diversify the geographical risk further with different
refineries producing different products in different geographical areas. (You
can see how number of stocks in portfolio increases quickly just from the
number of stocks held in such a small sub sector of the oil sector which itself
is a small sector of the market.)

How many stocks an investor should hold can be based on portfolio size, trading
costs, time to be devoted to investing, net worth, etc.

Anecdotally, it seems - seems - to me that the older and wealthier - or the
longer and more experienced - one becomes, the more stocks one has in one's
portfolios. Portfolio Creep. I have it too. You could look at Dale Baker's
portfolio. One of the few, maybe only one, which is published/maintained on SI.
69 things including funds now; 47 things (no funds) 50% posts earlier (4/'02).
Could be just chance; I see it as more anecdotal support. Also please note:
Performance of that published portfolio does not seem to have suffered at all
with turnover rate or positions held. Again one anecdotal case of one portfolio
manager where increased diversification has NOT led to either decreased
absolute or decreased relative performance. (The conventional wisdom being that
increased diversification must lead to lower average returns. Diversification =
diworseification. Nice wordplay that, but not so easily or correctly verifiable
or justifiable.)

Perhaps diversification through increased number of shares occurs because one
becomes more patient and is more willing to diversify by time. Time
diversification is a significant aspect, not often discussed academically or
here. One of the reasons I will post selling prices and dates of stocks bought.
When you look around SI you see how few posters have held stocks one, two,
five, ten, fifteen years. That is because, imo, so many people are buying
stocks now for profits now. Not so many planting seeds for a later harvest.

Running out of time/energy. What are your ideas here?

The book "stock market logic" taught me about diversification.

They say
"for most investors basic portfolio diversification should consist of holding
between 20-40 stocks unrelated to one another. Several closely related stocks
should be viewed as one holding for the purpose of estabilisting breadth of
diversification."

They show a chart that says 32 stocks eliminates 96% of risk, 64 stocks 98% and
500 stocks 99%. (Again, talking unrelated stocks)

They are talking about risk, relative to the market.

It says holding less than 20 issues exposes us to risks for which we cannot
expect to receive commensurate rewards.

Hi Paul - I noticed that you used some mutual funds to park money. How do you
utilize mutual funds (or ETF's) in your over all portfolio and do they make up
a large percentage of your total holdings. I use low cost GNMA and U.S.
Treasury money market funds to park my cash while I search for new value picks.
I like to have up to 10% of my taxable portfolio in these funds since I do not
want to be forced to sell or switch a position if a new idea or investment
theme presents it's self.

One of my top ten holdings is a low cost mutual fund from Schwab called Schwab
Dividend Equity Select (SWDSX)http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=swdsx
My goal is to use this fund to generate dividend income which is taxed at a low
rate and as a way to have exposure to "the market". If I feel the market is
over valued or I need to generate some cash reserves, I will sell shares or add
shares from time to time when the market has had big sell offs. I tend to have
shares that I have held over a year so sales are long term capital gains. SWDSX
makes up about 4% of the portfolio.

Over the last ten years I have sold most of my mutual funds and have
concentrated on individual stocks. I did this to save on the annual expense
fees these funds charge. They average 2%-3%/year which can add up over the
years.. As a result I have a basket of stocks that now run about 60 in the
taxable portfolio and is growing every year.

The number of different stocks continue to grow as I now try to keep stub
positions (based on your success keeping stub positions) on most every
profitable position I have owned except those that have either gone bankrupt or
continue to be owned or managed by directors that are unethical or promote
policies I do not agree with.

I try to add anywhere from 2-5 new positions every year based on investment
themes I feel are not yet fully valued in the global markets. I begin to
harvest profits on equities I have held for at least a year and one day and
will hold or add more shares based on the company fundamentals. I like to
average down on investments I still think have a good opportunity but are late
to bloom. This is where the tax loss selling comes into play w/ the idea to
repurchase the shares (or even increase the position) in 31 days or longer. I
do tax lot selling so I can manage my annual tax obligations.

On any new positions I take, I plan to hold at least 18-24 months. The hardest
decision is when to give up on an idea and decrease or just sell out of the
position. I have stocks that I have held for twenty years or more with a very
low cost basis. Texaco comes to mind. It is now Chevron/Texaco (CVX). Texaco
was a high dividend payer in the 80's and as CVX still pays a good dividend.
This is my largest position in the portfolio and breaks my 10% rule. CVX is
trading at an all time high so I probably need to peel off a few shares so when
we get a stiff correction, I can begin buying again.

The biggest thing I have learned over the many years of investing (I am always
learning new things) is to be disciplined in implementing my investment plan
including conservative money management, having an exit strategy, have a
realistic ROI expectation for each new position I accumulate shares in, buy and
sell in increments and focus on value opportunities.

My thoughts on the topic remain mixed. My feelings and thoughts come more from
actual experience and observation than so called academic studies. I doubt
there is a good rule for a nutty and volatile stock market. For example, I know
a very successful trader maybe 10-15 stocks at a given time who bases his buys
on when he sees little chu chu trains running around his refrigerator and hears
bells and whistles while some internal force pulls his arm to the telephone.
He’s a High School graduate who makes plenty of money and lives and breathes
the stock market. Then I see all these college grads being inducted by
brokerage firms out of school with the same standard academic education about
financial statements, diversification, head and shoulders tops, and forms of
analysis that just don’t work in the stock market.

It seems to me that a true successful value investor which holds 400 or so
stocks should have a continuous yearly rotation of stocks coming to fruition
after a 2 to 3 year stint, while the newbies need time to mature. I’ve seen
quite a bit of that from you in my short time here, but perhaps not enough to
compensate for such a massive endeavor. There are very few true value investors
as you say. With the world seeking performance now, this current year, and
that’s just the way it is. The pressure on portfolio managers to perform is
here now, not to plant seeds.
I do know successful value investors who own about 30 stocks as longer term
investments with several year horizons and do pretty well.

I think 400 is to many because I like to monitor the fundamental developments
on each holding, and even with the enormous amount of time put in, I don’t
think justice can be done to 400 stocks by one individual as far as real
thorough analysis and a good intimate feeling for each holding. Some recommend
8-12, as Madharry has alluded to, and that’s more in line with my thinking than
the larger number. However that does have its drawbacks as one bummer can
really set you back. Lose 30% on one, and you need close to a 50% gainer of the
same dollar amount to get it back. And bummers seem to come out of the woodwork
when one least expects it.

It also seems to me that consideration must be given to the total percentage of
assets that stocks represent in ones overall picture.

No good answers Paul. It’s a continuous learning process I suppose until we’re
gone.

Yes, that's about what I read from other sources and also what I argue against.

My opinion, it's dangerous to assume a stock portfolio of 32 or 40 stocks
diversifies away sufficient risk and provides for optimal profit making
opportunities (considering impairment risk.)

If we are talking risk relative to the market, what's the market?
If the bogey is something like the S&P 500, that market is heavy cap. weighted.
The larger the firm the more important that it then be included in the
diversified selected stocks. Otherwise, with a equal-amount driven
diversification strategy, the more stocks one picks, the more likely the
portfolio will have more small caps than large caps because the number of small
cap stocks in the stock universe is larger than the number of large-cap stocks
in it.

If one considers only 36 stocks, just how are the stocks to be allocated?
Choices could be:

small cap value - domestic and foreign
large cap value - domestic and foreign
small cap growth
large cap growth
dividend focused - either high div or div growth or both
specialized: business development companies, foreign real estate, reits, llc's

What is one to do? That's about nine or ten or more categories over which to
spread the 36 stocks. That to me, is way too thin.
36 stocks may eliminate "96% of risk", but that number is nowhere near enough
to adequately allow for gains within a category that moves into favor.

Again, what about the holding period? What's the difference between having a
portfolio with 36 stocks that one holds for two years, or that one rebalances
every year (Greenblatt's 20), or that one rebalances every month or every time
a sector goes into or out of favor? Somebody turns over their portfolio every
six months, is that for risk control purposes, like having two 36 stocks = a 72
stock portfolio? (I've no answers to these questions -g-)

If I buy stocks now with a view to hold them for 18 months on average, then
presumably the number of stocks I'm buying now roughly equals and replaces the
one's being sold now that I bought 18 months previously. So the number of
different stocks in the portfolio remains constant. But it doesn't work out
that way, because some stocks are held longer because they are producing gains
and still don't look overvalued, and because one buys more shares when more
opportunities are available, and that is not a constant thing. I'm saying for
me, I have a bunch of stocks in my portfolio that aren't doing anything -
volatility is low - but for which I have high hopes that as their business
improves, their stock prices will too. Put another way, if somebody's portfolio
only consists of 36 stocks, they are less likely to live with 2, 3 or 4 stocks
(9-10% of their portfolio) that do nothing and are expected to do nothing for a
year or more.
Or looking at it on another way, buyout offers can really pop an undervalued
stock. The more undervalued stocks one has, the greater the likelihood one
receives that good pop. Yes if the probability is only say 3%, it's 3%, but I'd
rather have a 3% chance on 40 undervalued value stocks in my large portfolio
than a 3% chance on 4 undervalued stocks in a 36 stock portfolio.

There are a lot of opportunities one gets when one's portfolio exceeds 32 or 64
different companies.

EKS, Thanks for sharing your learnings. Some nice ideas there. (Well, I agree

Once somebody gets up in number of company stocks held, that person essentially
has become his own mutual fund manager. I don't know what the critical number
is- maybe 60, maybe 160, maybe 260. The necessity for being diversified with
index funds or growth funds or value funds, diminishes, and - as you point out

with owning such funds disappear too.

EKS I use ETF's where I want exposure to a sector, but where it's difficult for
me to understand or buy individual securities in that sector.

To the extent that the individual ETF provides diversification in its sector, I
feel business risk is mitigated (but not the sector risk), and I'm willing to
increase my initial ETF bet to about 3x what I'd pay for an individual stock in
the sector. Still, it won't be much more than 1% of the portfolio, if that.

My wife has asked that I get a little more conservative with "investments",
which I interpret to mean ones that have less business risk, less market risk,
less volatility - perhaps just less exposure to stocks in general. I believe so
she doesn't have to listen to me walking around the house while whining on
about the treacherous stock market, my lousy picks, the volatility of my
portfolios, my bad luck, my stupidity, moronic TV business commentators/guest
idiots, etc. etc. -g-

Anyway I'm looking more closely to dividend payers now. And for the first time
in decades, I've even got a bank savings account and have actually put a few
dollars in it. Also, I've now bought initial positions in stock/bond thingys
like FRA, FRB, PFN.
I believe my wife has a bond fund and a preferred fund. These two would amount
to maybe 0.33% of our net worth. We have no other bonds or bond funds or any
index funds except as described below. So in the sense of typically-advised
diversification, I'm nowhere near a 60-40, 50-50 stock-bond split that I guess
advisers would counsel for my particular age group (old).

ETF types I have would be, for example,

IIF, INP for Indian stocks
EWY Korean exposure
IRL Irish
EGLRX, FIREX Asian real estate
RWX Wilshire SPDR International Real Estate

is now up to twenty years beyond retirement. If you factor inflation into your
savings you have to find some type of income that will continue to grown and
support you.

Those advisors also have never adjusted required percent of income to live on
in retirement. I never understand how they do not back out soc sec taxes,
commuting expenses, other taxes, 401k savings, and other work related expenses
before coming to an adjusted % of income for retirement. Yes, they can add back
medical costs and perhaps some travel which usually ends after a few years into
retirement, people get tired of travel or bored or slow down. They also never
look at a sliding scale of retirement spending. i expect we need more than
average salary earned in first few years of retirement. i would think average
retiree goes nuts with spare time and planned activities, but once that is
accomplished things tend to settle down. Expenses tend to drop.

sell. esp. losses.

I think focussing on the total count of positions is deceptive, because one
pays differing levels of attention to different positions. Most of us are
individuals managing our own portfolios, I think. If one has 400 positions and
spends 1/2 hour a month paying attention to each position, you are looking at a
2400 hour workyear... a bit daunting. However, if you have concentrated
positions on far fewer positions, and then higher numbers of starter, stub and
"source-of-cash" positions it becomes more doable.

I have 10 concentrated positions and 30 smaller ones, but I don't really manage
to the count and have had as many as 120.

What is not so widely acknowledged is that the QUALITY of ones attention
changes meaningfully once one owns a stock. My ability to find warts shoots up
once I stock I own goes down: I am pressed with the reality that the market
sees things I am not seeing and what could it be? I can often find things I do
not find or properly weight in my initial research.

I believe in concentrated positions: (a) why bother with this personal effort
when I could simply be in an index fund which will have lower costs than I do;
(b) i may have better knowledge than the market about some things but they will
be few and far between.

How many stocks?

I believe that the choice of which sector to invest in overwhelms the choice of
a particular stock. There is much more payback in being able to step back and
make the better macro decision. But with less data, it is more qualitative. and
probably more luck involved.

On the other hand, I remember reading a book by Lynch or somebody, and he said
that he had no sector strategy -- that he just found the best companies no
matter which industry they were in.

We seem to do both here. We wonder if now is the time to be in housing,
refining, retail, or banks, for example.

here's a chart of a few sector funds -- click on "5 year" also

energy
precious metals and mining
consumer staples
reits
health care
S&P 500

I am not diversified. I presently have this sector mix, oil sands 30%, other
energy 13%, miners 7%, other stocks 10%, and income 40% (reits, energy trust
and ACAS). 50 stocks.

Madharry,

PFN, FRA, FRB are lower return candidates edv.to, but they are much lower risk
imo, so I don't think they are even comparable.

Thank you for the edv.to recommendation.

A very interesting discussion - I will toss in a few thoughts at random:

--From the 4/02 benchmark you chose for my portfolio, the number of stocks has
grown less than 100% while the portfolio value is up 400% or so.

--I never chose 70-80 stocks as an ideal number, it just happened that way,
probably because it's all the stocks I can follow to the level I like, even
doing this full-time (50-60 hours per week). I noticed that if I had
concentrated even more resources in my top holdings I would have done slightly
better. But the thrill of finding the new ideas and watching them blossom is
part of the overall job satisfaction for me.

--Still, no one can follow 400 stocks beyond a cursory level. The average big
mutual fund has around 200 with a herd of munchkin analysts to do the legwork.
Once you get beyond that you are buying on a certain investment thesis then
just tucking the stock away and hoping it does OK.

--I pay no attention to whether my portfolio mirrors any index or set of
indexes. It's irrelevant to me except to measure my overall results against the
market. I invest strictly in stock stories, often with a notional sector
distribution in mind but I rarely set out to find a new stock in a specific
sector.

--The lesson for me the past five years is not new in the market; buy quality
companies and management when they are undervalued and just hold. My oldest
stock is now almost six years old in the port, and the majority of my top ten
are 18 months or older.

--If I had to limit my portfolio to 30-40 stocks (the minimum I would accept
for a portfolio my size) I could certainly do it. But it wouldn't be as much
fun as playing with twice as many. OTOH, holding 400 would drive me nuts as
much as you enjoy it.

To each their own. Many fascinating ways to make money in the market.

Here's where I stand up and say, "My name is Paul, and I'm also not
diversified"

-g-

It does seem for you and me, Grommit, that we're making heavy sector bets -
both of us being weighted quite a bit in energy and div. payers (bdc's
especially for me).

It's too bad my broker holding my main portfolios can't report (afaik) what my
sector weights might currently be. I can only find that they say I'm by
dollar-weighting 80% in domestic stocks, 12% in foreign, 6% unknown, 1% in
other, and .2% in bonds.

I've not intentionally, before-the-fact, picked these particular two sectors
and gone into them heavily. One or more stocks looked undervalued, I started, I
learned, I gained some confidence, I was willing to commit more funds to them.
Positions built over several years.

Once in a couple of energy stocks, and finding other stocks to be undervalued
in the sector - which means finding or coming to believe the sector itself to
be undervalued, I've found it difficult to pick the stock with the best
risk/reward relationship or the stock with the best potential. So I've been
willing to pick a package of stocks within the sector or sub sectors.

Also as regards some bdc's, rightly or wrongly, the historical record of
dividend payments gave me some confidence that there was a margin-of-safety,
and I convinced myself to make larger-than-usual purchases.

Not saying I'm right or wrong with these two particular sectors or my
weightings in them. My money still in play, and the sectors could crash, taking
me down substantially with them.

OT Got a multipage advertising touting JG Boswell without specifically
mentioning it by name. Not a bad tout and I have a decent size position. Bottom
line is They think the water in the ground is worth some $4billion or $4,000 a
share. Considering the stock goes for around $800, and has cotton and land too,
It looks ok. The advertiser is looking for 250 subscribers at around $1,800 a
piece. Not bad if you can get it. But if I were to offer such a service I think
Id be happy with a grand.

Holding a very large portfolio, does lead to some corollary conclusions. Maybe
more like operating assumptions rather than facts.

Analizer, given this:

"I don’t think justice can be done to 400 stocks by one individual as far as
real thorough analysis and a good intimate feeling for each holding." With
which I concur

and this,

"However that (8-12 stocks) does have its drawbacks as one bummer can really
set you back." We do see this happening sometimes to such portfolio holders.

Then I say that if "real thorough analysis and good intimate feeling" sometimes
surprises because it's not adequate to prevent the "one bummer" in an 8-12
portfolio, then what's the real benefit of doing "real thorough analysis"?

My point being agreement that it can't be done with a large portfolio, but that
it's importance and significance is greatly exaggerated in any case. Mostly -
enough times - good enough is good enough, and really thorough
monitoring/analysis/comfort levels are not necessary.

Paul,

With regards to this:

Then I say that if "real thorough analysis and good intimate feeling" sometimes
surprises because it's not adequate to prevent the "one bummer" in an 8-12
portfolio, then what's the real benefit of doing "real thorough analysis"?

I'd counter that thorough analysis has its merits and the likelihood of a 30%
gap down open on bad news becomes remote for portfolios that are conservatively
run and well thought out.

Perhaps Dale's portfolio is not a good example since its way more than 8-12
positions, but I've never seen a 30% blindsight gap down on bad news in that
portfolio. I think its because each individual issue is well thought out and
researched.

The 30% bad news gaps tend to be more in the micro cap and small cap stocks
that are of a speculative nature.

I think a portfolio of 400 or so will have better odds at mimicking overall
market performance while a smaller number is much more conducive to out
performance.

My portfolio also has grown, not due to intentionally making it an objective,
but really more the result of more stocks doing well in a market that has been
doing well since the 2002 October bottom. Also seems more good ideas have
cropped up over the years.

I agree that there is only so much we can do as far as DD and research. After
that we are subject to the whims of the marketplace. But we still must do what
we can to make sure we do our very best in each and every analysis of an
individual pick.
