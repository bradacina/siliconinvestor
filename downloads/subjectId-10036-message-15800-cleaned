<< Spekulatius. Fwiw, I'm continuing to add to a very small position in MRO as

yet again due to managements lack of execution on the upstream side - however
oil prices are still strong and the downstream business appears to be improving
as well so i think its a good buy. For the sake of diversification i am looking
to buy some BP instead of more MRO.

Spekulatius, I am diversifying among the bigger players also with a recent very
small buy of Chevron (CVX). BP is the more powerful company imo. May be the
better bet too long term. I'm a little partial to CVX as in another life I was
a consultant to one of their divisions, and they treated me well. (Hope I did
the same for them.)

Looks like stock performance of both companies is correlated:

A quick look at Dutch ADRS - the economic news here is uniformly crummy, so I
wouldn't recommend much. In addition to AKZOY's perpetual bad news, AHO and AEG
are still stumbling (though I don't follow pharmas much).

My main Dutch position is ING due to the international diversification and the
combination of insurance and banking. I have shares from the 16's and April 20
calls. I wish I had bought ABN in the 10's but won't chase it in the 15's. KLM
seems to track the US major airlines, and KPN had a decent report the other day
(but SCM seems more interesting for a European telco).

My main European bets are EWU (FTSE I-Share) and IRL, the Ireland Fund. Ireland
still has the strongest economy in Europe, and property values in the UK have
driven a nice boomlet there.

convert which had YTM of about 15% when I bought. The ELN has great return but
great risk. If company cannot cash out they have to issue stock at price on

More thoughts on UIC (United Industrial Corp.) I do not own any, although my
"significant other" made this her first purchase ever in her small account. She
purchased it for the AAI subsidiary (which makes TUAVs, or unmanned drone
aircraft), which has headquarters which we pass by frequently in the Baltimore
area. The asbestos exposure surprised us both, of course she and I were
dismayed when it was the number one loser on the NYSE yesterday.

Some thoughts on the company, and its potential asbestos exposure:
If you believe the company, and you believe that asbestos exposure can indeed
be quantified, then the most the company will be liable for is $15 mm over a 50
year period. That equates to $1.15 share. Were there to be payouts, I would
expect they would come in a few big hits.
Nevertheless, that also equates to about .02/share/year over the 50 year time
horizon.
I don't see that as life threatening. However, with cash on hand about 2-3
million, were there to be one or two big hits, the company would need to raise
cash somehow, which is a possible concern. Sources of cash might be equity (and
dilution), or debt (increased interest expense, less margin for error
operationally).
Here is the release detailing the asbestos exposure:
http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/021115/nyf098_1.html
Coincidentally, the company reported decent earnings yesterday.

6 years - wow. I remember I found this thread in November of 1996. I guess it
had just started. And I had just found St. Joe - remember that one? I was a kid
at Columbia Business School who was just starting to learn investing and over
the next few years I posted as somebody who sounded like he knew a lot more
than he did. And Paul always was one of the the ones who always saw through me
and I didn't realize how right he was about how little I knew until much later.
I learned a lot from this thread and other work I was doing at the time, and
now I'm managing a lot of money and doing it well thanks in great part to what
I learned in the give and take we had here from 1996 to 2000. Keep learning and
keep asking questions.

In that spirit, let me throw out a question which I really do want to hear some
thoughts on, because its big and I cannot answer it. Pension liability appears
that it might be the issue for old economy stocks the issue option liability is
for the Dells and Microsofts. And what do you do with it? Like options, it
depends on the level of the market, so it is impossible to pinpoint. But I find
the disclosure much more difficult than options - those are pretty transparent
to me. Anybody have more comfort with what to do with this? I'm not talking
about the extremes (GM or Goodyear) - I'm talking about any industrial company.
Can anybody point me to a study of pension accounting that focuses on value and
cash flow or has anybody written anything themselves on this topic? I think it
is going to be huge, but its an area of financial analysis I am not comfortable
with.

Pension accounting... that should take another six years to figure out!

SAFE MONEY REPORT
Cover Story -- September 2002
...............................................................................
....

NEW ACCOUNTING SCANDAL TO GUT STOCKS AND WIPE OUT AT LEAST ANOTHER $2.4
TRILLION IN SHAREHOLDER WEALTH!

Exactly three years ago, in a special Safe Money issue, I exposed widespread
accounting scams in Corporate America.

I warned you about the goodwill bubble that created trillions in make-believe
assets. I warned you how executives used options schemes to plunder corporate
America. I told you
these scandals would gut the stock market and rip the worst offenders to
shreds.

Now, the time has come to issue a new warning -- this time about an even larger
and more dangerous scandal that could make earlier accounting nightmares appear
mild by
comparison:

Many of America's largest corporations are drastically overstating their
earnings through manipulations of their employee pension funds.

Once the full scope of the scandal is exposed, it could help impact another
$2.4 trillion in investor wealth and help drive the market to my target of Dow
5000.

In this gala 12-page issue, I tell you how, why, and when. I name the 50 large
companies that are among the worst offenders. And I give you steps to take
immediately for your
protection -- and for potentially windfall profits.

This Is Not A Warning Of A Future Crisis. It's Right Here And Now!

I am not the first to warn about this looming pension fund disaster. Nor is
this a crisis that's months or years into the future. Quite to the contrary,
the news is already beginning to
spread, with a potentially devastating impact on the stock market:

* GM owes its pension fund $12.7 billion; its stock has plummeted a whopping
34% since mid-May.

* Delta Airlines owes $2.4 billion; its shares are down a whopping 55% just in
the last six months.

* Delphi, which also owes its pension fund $2.4 billion, has seen its stock
plummet from $17 a share in mid-May to just $9.60 at the end of August -- a
loss of 43.5% in just 90
days.

* Goodyear, Exxon, and other major stocks are also being impacted severely.

This certainly isn't the only force that is driving stocks down. But it's
emerging as a very significant factor.

Most Regulators Still Don't Get It

The SEC is hoping that simply by getting a few hundred CEOs to swear that their
accounting statements are "true," they can miraculously close an ugly chapter
in America's history.
But ... the primary problem is not the cheating and lying CEOs that break the
rules; it's the distorted and deceptive rules themselves -- rules that allow
the CEOs to juggle and
manipulate their books.

To understand this principal, just ask a simple question: What would have been
the result if the SEC had asked America's CEOs to certify the truth of their
financial statements back
in September 1999, when I issued my warnings about the coming accounting
disasters?

The sad answer: Almost every single CEO would have been able to swear on a
stack of bibles that his firm's distorted accounting was "100% accurate" and
"the gosh-honest truth."

Nearly all those horrendously deceptive financial statements would have passed
the SEC's inspection with flying colors!

How is that possible? Because nearly every one of the most destructive
accounting manipulations of recent years was considered "technically legal."

I repeat: Right now, major US companies -- the same ones that have sworn their
financial statements are accurate -- owe hundreds of billions to their employee
pension funds. They
are hiding those obligations through a series of accounting and actuarial
gimmicks. And they are twisting the numbers to greatly exaggerate their
profits, often hiding seas of red ink
... and it's all blessed by the auditors, and accepted by the SEC.

Please don't misunderstand: I'm not talking about defined contribution plans,
such as a 401(k). I'm referring to traditional defined benefit plans, in which
an employer promises a
specific benefit to the employee at retirement.

The trouble is, many US companies don't have enough money set aside to fulfill
those promises. The shortfall -- just among 234 companies in the S&P 500 that
have defined
benefit plans -- is at least a whopping $78 billion.

Sometime soon, that $78 billion (or more!) is going to have to come out of
their earnings. And with stocks selling for about 31 times those earnings, that
means the market caps
could get hit for 31 times $78 billion, or close to at least $2.4 trillion. But
it will probably turn out to be much worse. Reason:

Even This Huge $78 Billion Shortfall Is Based On Very Optimistic Assumptions
For The Markets And The Economy

The companies typically assume a recovery in the stock market almost
immediately -- despite the fact that there is no evidence of such a recovery
taking place.

They assume a steadily growing economy -- despite hard evidence of a choppy
economy at best, and despite the real possibility of another deep decline.

They assume high investment returns, ignoring the fact that all returns -- even
on the riskier bonds -- are far, far lower.

They're living in a dream world, and no one has bothered to wake them up.

Yet, with these optimistic assumptions, the companies do three dangerous
things: They delay putting money into their pension plans. They report that
money as a reduction in
pension plan expenses, which boosts profits. And worst of all, many have used
old paper gains from their pension plans to boost current profits. When those
paper gains disappear
in a cloud of smoke, there will be hell to pay.

To better pin down who and how much, we have pored through the pension plans of
each of the S&P 500 companies, and here's a summary of our findings:

1. Two-thirds are in the red: Out of the 354 S&P 500 companies reporting
pension data, 234 or 66% owed money to their company's retirement fund.

2. Thirteen corporations owed their employees' pension funds more than $1
billion each: These include GM ($12.7 billion), Exxon ($7.2 billion), Ford
($2.5 billion), Delphi ($2.4
billion), Delta Airlines ($2.4 billion), United Technologies ($2.3 billion),
AMR Corp ($1.9 billion), Pfizer ($1.3 billion), and Procter & Gamble ($1.1
billion). Chevron-Texaco,
Pharmacia Corp, Goodyear, and Raytheon -- $1 billion each.

3. Thirty-two S&P 500 companies owed more than half a billion dollars each.

4. More than 100 companies were short $100 million or more.

5. Trillions of dollars involved! The total amount of aggregate pension
liabilities for the 354 companies surveyed was $1.06 trillion. The total amount
of liabilities (funded and
unfunded) for all private pension funds in the US is $4.3 trillion. That's
nearly half the size of the entire US economy.

6. Huge impact on profits. Fully 150 out of the 354 companies we analyzed -- or
42% -- used their pension funds to manipulate their bottom lines, boosting
profits, or even turning
losses into profits. These companies took purely hypothetical gains from their
pension funds -- based on projections, not actual results -- and added those
numbers to their net
income.

And that was based on year-end 2001 data. Now it's much worse. It's also a lot
worse than most of Wall Street realizes.

GM Admits It Owes Its Pension Fund A Whopping $12.7 Billion. But It's Still The
Tip of the Iceberg.

The revelation that a $103 billion company -- WorldCom -- hid about $4 billion
in losses sent its shares into a nose dive and the company into Chapter 11. But
that was small by
comparison to the pension fund scam. Take General Motors, for instance. The
auto giant has $26 billion in total market value. But its debt of $12.7 billion
to its pension fund is the
equivalent of 49% of the company's total value.

This is mind-boggling. Here we have one of the largest automakers in the world
... and just with the money that it has failed to pay into employee pension
funds, those employees
could own nearly half the entire company!

The big difference is that WorldCom's manipulations were illegal and relatively
rare. General Motors' are perfectly legal and very common.

Here's what's been made public so far: GM assumed that its pension plan will
earn average annual returns of 10%. But instead, its plan lost 3% in the first
half of this year. That's
when GM announced that it would have to pay up to $12 billion into its plan by
2007 to make up for the mounting losses. And to get started, the company said
it was putting $2.2
billion into the fund this year alone.

Here's what GM did not tell you: Although the $12 billion shortfall GM admitted
to is already huge, it's based on optimistic assumptions -- that the stock
market will rebound and the
economy will resurge. This raises some serious questions:

Question #1. What happens if you don't assume a stock market rebound? Answer:
Rather than a 60% decline in profits, we estimate GM would be reporting a net
loss of $2.3 billion
right now!

Question #2. What happens if you assume a continuing stock market decline? Add
another billion or two to the loss column, depending on its severity and
duration.

Question #3. What happens if you assume another slide in the economy? All bets
are off! General Motors will be losing money hand over first from its car sales
plus taking a beating
in its pension fund. Ultimately, don't be surprised if the company winds up
reneging on its promises to retiring employees, canceling dividends to
shareholders, and if things continue
to deteriorate over time, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

Therein lies the accounting scandal that, when uncovered, is going to help send
the US equity markets into a downward spiral.

But it's just the beginning ...

Dead Ahead: $144 Billion Pension Shortfall

The rules for calculating pension liabilities have been so lax in recent years,
hundreds of major US corporations have been legally manipulating the way they
calculate the value of
the portfolios.

The market plunged in 2000, driving their pension fund assets into the hole,
and they ignored it. The market plunged again in 2001, and they still ignored
it.

But now, as the market continues to fall for a third year, they can't ignore it
anymore. So they're starting to admit the shortfalls, but only one small piece
at a time.

Here's what we see coming:

* If the corporate pension funds of S&P 500 companies lose just 5% this year,
the shortfall in pension funding is going to be at least $109 billion!

* If they lose closer to 10%, then the shortfall is going to be in excess of
$144 billion.

* If you look beyond just the S&P companies, the problem is even larger --
thousands of smaller pension funds that could drag down corporate profits for
years to come.

* If the pension funds really take a major beating of 20% or more in the next
year or two, the losses could set off a chain reaction of events that will make
the recent accounting
scams look like a Sunday school picnic. You'll see wholesale dumping of shares
by investors ... mass protests by employees ... draconian new countermeasures
by Congress and the
SEC.

The crisis could affect $3 trillion, even up to $4 trillion in market cap.
Unbelievable? Yes. True? Absolutely! For the evidence, take a look at ...

The Numbers Game Behind The Coming Pension Fund Disaster

There are three fundamentally flawed accounting rules that are at the root of
the pension fund scam:

Flawed Rule #1. Companies are allowed to calculate a pension's funding
requirements based purely on hypothetical projections of
annual returns, rather than on how well, or how badly, a pension's investments
have fared in the real world.

In other words, let's say Company A is projecting an annual return of 10% of
its pension fund assets of $100 million, or a $10 million
return. But in reality, Company A's pension has unrealized losses of 5% this
year or $5 million. What do you think Company A puts
down on its profit & loss statement? A loss of $5 million?

Sadly, no. GAAP accounting rules let the company spread out the unrealized
losses over a period of time. Let's assume it's 10 years. As
a result, Company A shows a net profit of $9.5 million (the $10 million
projected gain minus the half million dollar amortized loss) less
any costs associated with maintaining the pension fund. This phantom "profit"
of $9.5 million allows the company to postpone
contributing the needed money to its pension fund, and avoid deducting that
amount from its corporate bottom line. In short, they
postpone the day of reckoning based on the blind assumption that the losses
will "naturally go away."

The original intent behind this kind of creative accounting was to smooth out
annual swings in income for pension funds, so companies
can better plan their contributions.

The practical result, however, is far more sinister: Companies are allowed to
legally hide massive losses in their pension plans, avoid
contributing additional funds, and therefore exaggerate their profits in any
given year.

Flawed Rule #2. A pension fund's projected gains can be based on seriously
unrealistic assumptions regarding how well the pension
investments will perform.

Let's say you're managing your own retirement program and you determine you'll
need $1 million in 20 years when you retire. If you
assume you can get a 10% annual return on your investments, then you only need
to contribute $17,459 a year to reach that goal. But
if, in reality, you only get a 6% annual return on your investments, then you
need to contribute $27,184 each year -- or 56% more.

For CEOs with fat options packages anxious to show investors high net earnings,
the temptation to exaggerate their estimated pension
fund returns -- and add that money to the bottom line instead -- is almost
overwhelming.

It's hardly surprising, then, that dozens of America's largest companies base
their pension fund contributions on an assumption of a 10%
annual return or greater -- including Bank of America, Bristol Myers Squib,
Campbell Soup, FedEx, General Mills, Mattel, Lehman
Brothers, Pepsi, Sprint, and Weyerhaeuser, among others.

According to Milliman USA's 2002 pension study, the average assumed rate of
return in 2000 for the 50 largest American companies
was 9.38%, with an expected projected profit of $51 billion. However, the
actual return on investment that year was only $14 billion --
or $37 billion short.

In 2001, the average projected rate of return for the 50 largest companies was
a bit higher -- at 9.39%, with an expected profit of $54
billion.

Give me a break. The stock market had just taken a beating in the previous
year, and they were projecting even higher returns!? Actual
results for 2001: A loss of $36 billion -- or a shortfall of $90 billion from
what companies expected.

And it gets worse ...

Flawed Rule #3. Companies can count the hypothetical gains in their pension
funds as part of their own bottom line, even though it has nothing to do with
their operations, and
even though the money doesn't even belong to them.

Companies show their projected returns from their pension funds on their P&L
statements. As The Times of London put it, "any major U.S. company that is
worried about its
earnings can therefore engineer a $100 million boost simply by tweaking its
expectations about pension fund returns."

Consider this example: You own a hot dog stand that usually makes $10,000 a
year in profits. Plus, you have $100,000 in your pension plan, which you
optimistically project will
earn 10% a year.

Now, let's assume this has been a horrible year for hot dogs -- not one meager
dime in profits. What's worse, your pension plan, instead of making 10% this
year, has actually lost
5% -- or $5,000.

Pretty miserable, right? Not if you use the "legal" GAAP gimmicks to jury-rig
the numbers! First you could spread the $5,000 pension fund lost over five
years -- just $1,000 each
year. Then, you could assume a $10,000 pension fund gain. Bottom line: Deduct
the $1,000 loss from the $10,000 gain, and voil&#224; ... your loss of $5,000
has been transformed into
a $9,000 profit.

How common is this kind of creative accounting? It's systemic ... and massive.
As I told you earlier, based on our review of S&P 500 corporations, 150 out of
354 companies
reporting pension data were able to boost their earnings -- or actually turn
net losses into profits -- by adding hypothetical pension fund income when
calculating the company's
annual net earnings. For example:

* Verizon Communications had multi-billion dollar losses in 2001. But just by
adding in its projected pension fund gains exceeding $2 billion, the company
was able to magically
report a net profit for the year of $389 million.

* Eastman Kodak lost tens of millions last year. But by including its projected
$100-million-plus profit from its pension fund, the losses were magically
transformed into a $76
million profit.

* TRW also lost tens of millions in 2001. But by adding in a $100-million-plus
projected gain in its pension fund, it transformed the huge loss into a $68
million profit.

* Whirlpool should have told its investors that it lost over $20 million last
year, but because of the pension fund accounting rules, it was able to goose up
its bottom line, wash
away the loss, and magically create $21 million in profits.

* Honeywell International's loss of $99 million in 2001 would have been several
times greater. But they counted the company's projected pension fund gain of
hundreds of
millions on the corporate bottom line.

* Prudential Financial's loss would have been equally catastrophic -- over half
a billion dollars instead of just $154 million -- if they had not added their
pension fund's phantom
"gain" to the corporate bottom line.

* Northrop Grumman's 2001 income of $427 million would have been cut down to
about a quarter of that amount. Weyerhaeuser's 2001 profit of $354 million
would have
been sliced by two-thirds. Consolidated Edison's profit would have been cut
practically in half. Boeing's earnings would have been reduced by about a
third.

The examples go on and on. More than 140 other major companies in the S&P 500
did essentially the same thing. Now do you see why I call this the greatest
accounting scam of
all time?

When Will This Start To Hit?

Some of the corporations may be able to postpone the inevitable for some period
of time. But the accounting rules allow companies to hide the true extent of
their losses for only
so long.

When the assets in a company's pension plan lose more than 10% of their value
... or when companies are significantly short of their projected total pension
liability ... then they
are forced to contribute more money into the fund, and those contributions must
be deducted from corporate earnings.

At the end of this year, and for the next several years at least, corporations
will have to make up for shortfalls in their pension funds caused by massive
losses on their stock
investments, and deduct literally billions of dollars from their bottom-line
profits. And that's even without a deepening of the bear market! It's
impossible to pin down exactly how
much will hit when. But here are some good guesses:

* I've told you General Motors will have to pay $2.2 billion into its pension
fund this year. Even if the fund makes 5% in 2002, it will have to put up
another $3 billion in 2003.
And if the fund loses 5% this year, it will have to put up another $4.5
billion!

* Also assuming just a 5% decline in fund assets this year, United Technologies
will have to kick in $1.3 billion next year ... Ford Motor will have to pay out
$1.1 billion; Delphi,
another $1 billion; and Pfizer, at least $784 million.

The stock market will get killed -- either when the losses are announced, or
more likely, in anticipation of the losses.

Right now, most investors are just beginning to get wind of the problem. Once
the general public realizes how serious the problem is, you can expect another
hair-on-fire stampede
out of stocks.

What You Should Do Right Away

Step #1: If you haven't done so already, get the heck out of the stock market.
This is way too big to be limited strictly to the companies with pension fund
problems. Take
advantage of the lull in the market to sell right now, before the next wave of
panic selling hits.

Step #2: Check this list of the S&P 500 companies reporting pension fund data.
The list is sorted by the companies with the worst unfunded pension fund
liabilities. If you
still own shares in any of these companies, it's one more major reason to sell
them immediately.

Step #3: Don't forget to liquidate equity mutual funds. With so many major
companies embroiled in the pension fund scam, it's virtually impossible to find
equity funds that
do hold substantial amounts of their shares. Besides, the pension fund problem
-- plus a sinking economy -- will drive nearly all stocks down. The so-called
"diversification" that
mutual funds provide does you no good at all in this environment.

Step #4: Although I recommend that you steer clear of all stocks, if you do own
stocks and want to investigate the problem on your own, call the Investor
Relations department at the company and ask for these three numbers: (1) The
company's pension fund's projected rate of return; (2) How much profit from the
pension
fund the company is adding to its bottom line for the year; and (3) What the
company's current estimated unfunded pension liability is.

Step #5: If you have a defined benefit pension plan at work, find out as much
as you can about its current status. Remember: Unlike 401(k) plans, which

Sites that Look at ADRs

More Best of the Rest

Here are some worthwhile niche sites that look at ADRs and technical analysis

Reviewed by KATHY YAKAL
Edited by Randall W. Forsyth

"....ADR.com (www.adr.com), hosted by JP Morgan, is still our favorite place to
get the skinny on American depositary receipts. The site has been overhauled
and is easier to navigate than it was the last time we reviewed it -- and it's
still free. An in-depth market overview provides current data by region,
country, or sector, breaking out significant movers. You can also grab market
news and view institutional ownership. And you can search the site's extensive
database to see profiles of specific ADRs. Limited editorial content is
available, including educational pages and JP Morgan white papers, commentary
from Thomson Financial, and the S&P ADR Index. Account services for traders are
available, too, allowing online purchases, account access and Web-based
communications (like proxy voting)....."

"......Another strong site for the international investing crowd is Nikkei Net
Interactive (www.nni.nikkei.co.jp). Both English and Japanese versions are
available. The site is heavy on news, taken from several Nikkei financial
publications, updated 24 hours a day. News is not limited to the Japanese
market; coverage is provided for other Asian regions. Editorials are sprinkled
throughout the news stories, but not in great number. Data are in good supply,
between the site's economic indicators and forecasts, but tools are limited.
You can create a simple portfolio and link to a security's quotes, price and
volume charts (customizable only by period), financials, key ratios, analyst
estimates, and corporate profiles/news. Charts are available elsewhere, in the
Stock Trends feature: You can select one of five performance patterns and get a
list of securities (out of the site's database of 3,300) that most closely
match it. There's a two-week free trial; it's roughly $50 every six months
thereafter....."

"....Nikkei Net Interactive (www.nni.nikkei.co.jp) offers comprehensive
coverage of Asia with news, data and editorials in English and Japanese...."

"....News about technology can be found at TechWeb (www.techweb.com), a site
that scored well in our tech-news category. Timely information and features are
pulled together here from CMP's network of technology publications, including
TechWeb itself, InformationWeek, InternetWeek, and Network Computing.
Multi-source special reports cover hot topics in tremendous depth, like the
recent mega-story on the Microsoft ruling, titled, "Microsoft Parties While
Rivals Sulk." Breaking news appears up front, while additional new and older
stories are divided into categories, including Mobile, Software, E-Business,
and Networking. The financial technology section pulls content from outlets
such as Wall Street & Technology and Bank Systems & Technology......"

"......Lycos Finance (finance.lycos.com) scored well as a financial portal,
thanks in part to its absorption of strong brands like Raging Bull and
Quote.com. Its newest addition, launched last month, is an enhanced tool
LiveCharts Plus. For $19.95 a month, this one-screen browser page displays both
a bare-bones portfolio tracker (with links to message boards) and a very nice
charting tool. This is delayed data, but a minimal exchange fee will upgrade
you to real-time updates. Charts can be customized to display several styles
and sizes (with a handful of technical studies), and you can add your own lines
and export the charts. One window alternates between Time & Sales and detailed
quotes, while another posts "hotlists" of stocks on the move....."

Pensions

As a first step, I think you need to back out the unsmoothed pension liability
from the footnotes and adjust the balance sheet to reflect the true liability
versus the fake "smoothed" liability used in GAAP. This unsmoothed liability
gives you a true picture of the company's financial condition subject to the
pension estimate assumptions. Potential manipulation of the pension estimate
assumptions is more difficult to analyze, but as least you can compare general
assumptions across companies and look for dubious changes in assumptions.

One of the Financial Reporting books for the CFA talks about much of this. I
don't have the name of this book off the top of my head, but can get it. As far
as research goes, I am sure there is in the Financial Accounting field on this
topic. I am not familiar with the research myself, but I know a professor that
does work in this area. She would likely know.

This commentary from Stephen Roach who I think may be the smartest person on
Wall Street touches on the pension liability but also expands it to include
banks, insurance companies, debt-strapped consumers, etc. worldwide with what
he calls "a markdown of current asset values in the face of an unchanged stream
of future liabilities" or simply a mismatch between liabilities and the assets
available to pay them.

"Moreover, much of Corporate America is still building in pension-plan return
assumptions of 9% to 9.5% per annum into its earnings calculus"

Hard to believe they're getting away with that. It's been well documented that
historic growth in real earnings is about 1-2%, so adding that to dividends of
about 2% and inflation of 3% (?) total return is 6-7% if valuations remain the
same . Of course they could claim that their fund is above average but they
can't all be that like Lake Wobegon's children.

However it's my understanding that defined benefit plans are almost solely a
ball and chain for smokestack and older companies only with newer and smaller
firms having defined contributions. Is that correct?

ALVR - good outfit, but they are still bleeding cash with no end in sight. When
a stock stays in a trading range for so many months (1.60-2.60) since February,
I don't see any point buying until the stock is breaking up out of the range on
good news and good volume.

That said, I bought some CAMP around 4 in expectation it can move up off its
base soon. CAMP is a profitable outfit with future profits in their estimate
too.

MTLK - with news like this I would run like hell and not look back. They appear
doomed to collapse eventually. "For the nine months ended 9/30/02, revenues
fell 54% to $5.6 million. Net loss rose 62% to $11.4 million. Results reflect
challenging general telecom market conditions, lower gross margins due to
reduced revenues and increased non-cash compensation costs."

Focus on undervalued stocks with growth and profits and your odds will improve.

Veritas Software (VRTS ): Maintains 3 STARS (hold)
Analyst: Jonathan Rudy

Shares are down 12% on news that the SEC has requested information on dealings
the company had with America Online in 2000. The transactions in question
involve AOL buying $50 million in software and services from Veritas, and
Veritas purchasing $20 million in advertising from AOL. S&P thinks the SEC is
more concerned with AOL, because a number of questionable transactions have
surfaced there, and at this point, S&P has no reason to believe that Veritas
was actively engaged in swap transactions. The amount in question is less than
3% of Veritas' revenues.

Certain elements of pension expenses are smoothed (such as deviation between
expected and actual returns), such that the true economic reality is not
reported on the balance sheet immediately --- it is amortized over a period of
several years, with the true exposure held off balance sheet.

Hence, pensions are both an income and balance sheet issue. The true pension
obligation doesn't filter through the income statement correctly, resulting in
pension gains and losses that are not an accurate reflection of reality.

You can calculate adjusted income and balance sheet using the pension data in
the footnotes.

About two months ago, I was considering HD. Went to a store a couple of times,
the customer service was poor, verging on very poor in one store. For that
"kick the tires" reason, I opted out.
For the reason that these two companies give outstanding service IMHO, I always
have FDX and LUV on my watch list, buying them if the price is right.
Peter Lynch has always advocated "kicking the tires", it's helpful in side
stepping land mines, at times.

do it, you get the stuff and get the h*** out of there" store. Otherwise, you
might as well call someone to do home improvement for you... :-) Having said
that, our HD staff was really helpful to me, and I'm total home improvement
moron. :-)

LUV - never flown it and pray to god the big ones don't go bankrupt, so I don't
need to fly it ever. How is it possible to be excited about airline which takes
5 stops to get from point A to point B? I guess it's great business, but it's
really lousy experience for a flyer. But then I fly coast-to-coast and
international mostly, and I hate plane switches even more than I hate flying in

I live on the East coast, and I will tell you that as mundane as the experience
at LUV appears, it is anything but unrewarding. Everyone, from the occasional
phone reservations agent (I book almost exclusively online) to gate personnel
to flight attendants and pilots, have been uniformly upbeat and helpful. One
actually can use the rewards of its frequent flyer program.
I contrast this to US Airways and American, where I have oodles of miles, which
are extremely difficult to use.
I have been treated rudely on Northwest, found it insulting to be asked to pay
$5 on US Airways for a headset on a trans-continental flight.
Southwest has none of these pretenses - you pay your very reasonably priced
fare, find a seat, and are delivered on time (generally) to your destination.
If you want, bring a lunch, it will beat whatever the other "majors" shove in
front of you.
All this, and management actually knows how to run the company so that it makes
money, something few airlines can say!
I'm guessing I've made about 3 dozen round trips on LUV over the past 2 years
(including non-stop Baltimore to Vegas, they now offer Balt.-LA non-stop, as
well), and I'm completely sold on them.
Enough of my rant on LUV.

Wallace,

I guess I choose non-stop flights any time they are available vs. stopovers and
since Southwest does not fly to my neck of the woods and to my destinations
direct, I have avoided them so far. I won't say anything nice about other
airlines either, except for British Airways transatlantic World Traveler Plus
which is great considering price/benefits. Still, flying is not an experience I
look forward to. :-(((

store. Otherwise, you might as well call someone to do home improvement for

of product but helping DIYer's by hiring ex-contractors and knowledgeable
personnel to be able to help people with projects. They even held in store
seminars on various projects. Unfortunately, as the growth from new store
openings has dried up, They've tried to maintain eps growth by constraining
SG&A...cutting staff in store, so that in many areas the service sucks. This
drives DIYer's needing guidance back to traditional hardware stores and home
centers.
The growth has slowed as they continued to open new stores, of the same size
even, in ever smaller locations - the low hanging fruit in attractive markets
has been picked. Also Lowes has come into HD markets where there had been only
weak local competitors. Expectations of 15 to 18% going forward just don't seem
realistic based on this.

don't find it attractive at current levels.

Demand for its major product tetraethyl lead (that old gasoline additive) has

question though whether they should be taking "realistic" depreciation - hence
earning charges - on one or more of their plants.) Meanwhile they are making
acquisitions. Perhaps it's a race to see if they can get the earnings from the
other sources to cover diminishing returns from being forced to abandon their
major lead product(s).

If they could maintain the earnings they say they have for the next 2-3 years,

the business cannot seem to generate earnings now. CYN, otoh, is expensive on

I'll take a position in WRLD today. A regional finance company that lends money
to poor people who can't afford to borrow.

Decent earnings history. Low p/e (which seems to be the case with such
companies), good profit margins.
Reserve for bad loans is high; I can only guess that it's adequate.

Spekulatius: I'll diversify further in oil company stocks by adding a very
little PTR here:

io&Ticker=PTR&rn=A23D8&mxid=100204286&coname=PETROCHINA+CO+LTD

Aside: I find it interesting that this stock is owned by Wellington Management
whose best known fund manager was John Neff. Now what catches my attention is
that PTR actually meets Mr. Neff's once famous (well, I go back a while and I
remember it) Rule of Sixes. That was: earnings growth rate + dividend yield
summed and divided by the p/e ratio should be at least 2. And that was when
interest rates were near or at double digits. So that number 2 must be much
higher now for Mr. Neff. Anyway, fwiw, the numbers (from Multex) for PTR seem
to be roughly (8+6)/6
=2.3.

Of course, PTR itself, being a Chinese corporation with all the good and bad
that that implies, has to be judged too rather than just plopping its numbers
into an equation.

Paul,

RTRSY. The problem with Reuters is the same problem that I have with other
stocks. The $64M question is what is the forward going ROE that we can assume.
For example, take RTRSY. If we assume that they can return to 30% ROE, the
stock is an immediate and great buy with expected annual returns in the 28%
range. If we assume 20% ROE, which is below their ROE in EVERY ONE of the last
10 years, it is still a buy with expected annual return in 15% range. If we
assume only 15% ROE, then it's not a buy with an expected annual return in 8%
range. (RTRSY's 2001 ROE is 4% and 2002 will not be better either).

It's the same problem I have with INTC, MSFT, BMY, MRK, SGP and any other high
ROE stocks of last decade. If we assume forward ROEs in 20-25-30% range, they
are undervalued. If we reduce expected ROEs to ~15% or below - which is still a
high bar for most companies - the stocks are fairly valued or overvalued.

Any comments from anyone on this? How is it possible to estimate future ROE if
it is unclear whether the last decade was an aberration or if the last two
years were extremely bad?

Re: rapid runup. Yep, I am seeing the same too and I am reluctant to pay up,
since we could get a third dip if some more scandals, pension liabilities, no
pick up in H1/2003 materialize...

Oil stocks PTR, SNSA, STO
Paul: i do like oil stocks right now and PTR looks like a very interesting bet.
The stock looks cheap by almost any measure (P/E, price to book, dividend
yield, oil reserves).

I have not done more than a few minutes of research but here are potential
negatives:
1) PTR of course is a concentrated bet on China
2) PTR looks like a legacy company where the government makes the decisions.
The legacy companies have liabilities like a huge number of employees
(according to yahoo PTR has 440k employees!, corruption etc. ). It is also hard
to judge the accounting. With Chinese companies it is important to keep in mind
that numbers and documents mean nothing - trust and relationships mean
everything.

Myself has been doing some research in STO. Statoil is also a formerly state
run oil company based in Norway. P/E is about 8 and dividend yield. This is
much cheaper than the supermajors.
Potential negatives:
1) political influence due to state ownership
2) Tax laws in Norway unfavorable and make international diversification more
difficult
3) Uneven reserve replacement record

Overall, I think that both STO and PTR are good bets at current valuations.

Spekulatius,

I have also been looking at STO. I agree with the 3 points you make on the
risk. I believe STO represents 17% of the Norwegian oil resources and the rest
is owned by the government.

Do you have any information on the companies pension plan and their dividend
policy?

On the positive side, the Norwegian government ledger has a positive balance
sheet if you look at the debt vs. assets. Their currency does fluctuate with
the price of oil but I can not see the currency having problems with the
competing currencies in today’s environment where most governments are deep in
debt and a large portion of taxes are spent on servicing the debt.

I am looking for an entry point in this stock for a first third position.

I am in the process of researching SOSA after your suggestion. I am impressed

a very cheap price in relation to the value of its assets.

Of course, there has been a few problems in the business, but it seems to have
been addressed (this deserves to be check closely though). There's also an
issue regarding some trade with Iran, but again the penalty -- if there's any
-- would not be that bad according to what I have learned so far (the market
does think so too, apparently, when you look at the price action Friday).

An other point -- and not the least --, there has been a strong and steady
volume on the stock in the last weeks. I am not an expert in TA, but it looks
as heavy accumulation at these depressed prices. To summarize, SOSA looks like
an interesting turn-around play. Thank you for your tip.

What I like about the situation is that the CEO, COO, and CFO have all left the
company in the last two months. I guess the parent company is tired of bailing

Well, with the market up so strong lately, it's to be expected that the hottest

for profits NOW.

I've added money to stocks that don't seem to have anyone's interest or
attention and that are in areas that are dull now. I've been adding to my small
position in insurance company NWLIA; I started a speculative position in Dale
Baker's pick of ACGL; I added a bit to my shares of HUM.

I am figuring I will be holding on to CSG for quite a while; I added to my very
small position there, and ditto for my small position in COST.

17 of 22 analysts following CC have a hold or sell rating on it. I still see
some opportunity in CC at current price. I started a small position today. They
have cash to undertake their proposed store remodeling program. The stock sells
under book value with no long term debt. (But that's per Yahoo, and I haven't

Here's what I'm up to lately...

I hope housing will recover. I still hold some of the traditionals (RYL, KBH,
SPF) plus recently bought some CMH, which was discussed here years ago.

Truckers are doing fine, owning ROAD and YELL. These LTL truckers the best,
especially with the BK of consolidated. Plus they will automatically do well,
with the expected economic recovery.

Just bought some DRI to go with my JBX. I think JBX is the better value by far.
Sold all my other restaurants awhile ago -- IHOP, BOBE, maybe some others? YUM
is tempting.

NLS is high potential, but many will find fault with it. Cramer has been
bashing it, like ALD and ACAS. A grand opportunity to buy, perhaps. Any
opinion?

Groceries. I hope my ABS, KE, SWY will not get eaten by WMT. PSS, TOY and ANF
among the retail seem to be a fair price. Oh and of course, BL -- I added some
more recently. Bought some TGT too, but it's not a great bargain. One of those
"relative" bargains.

My largest holding is ACAS. If you have half-a-brain and do your homework, it's

I'm holding most shares of the BDC companies I have.

You've had those truckers for a couple of years now it seems to me. During that

I had looked at TGT, decided I like COST better and have been buying it. (Fwiw,

hoyasaxa, looked at LH once again. And again, it's still to tough for me to

company that has or is about to have or may have a very significant cancer
diagnostic test. I read the latest issue of Money mag. which has a positive
write up on LH. On the negative side, an analyst has apparently indicated that
more hospitals are increasing the amount of in-house testing they will be doing
(reducing need for LH services).

Back on that other hand, five of 14 analysts have a buy on the stock, and with
a p/e of 12 on next year's expected earnings, that seems reasonable, esp. if an
acquisition or two kicks in. Margins look high now; in past years they have
