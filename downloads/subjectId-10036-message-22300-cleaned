Slagle, I'm avoiding MRK - have sold, taken lumps, and moved on. Sorry I can't
say the same about PFE and BMY - both of which I still have a few shares of and
am suffering with.

I guess MRK's div. is more secure than most others of the big pharmas (based on
a cursory look at cash/debt per Yahoo). Whether dividend is actually secure,
who knows? With all the institutional holders in these companies, a div. cut
would send a very bad signal, imo.

SGP a few years back when they got in trouble, cut their div. It's possible
that MRK, BMY might be on the same path.

Paul - I added to my Comcast (CMCSA) position today. The value I see in this
company is there huge free flow cash flow but you pay for it in the PE. It is
trading near a 52wk low.

I also have a GTC on ACTI for a very small starter position. This will allow me
to have more interest in watching the company. These types of small cap
companies either do quite well or go worthless in the 10-24 month holding
period I have.

I guess I was a bit early on nibbling on several of the drug companies but none
of these announcements were unexpected. PFE is an excellent buy at these levels
if you have a 3-5 year holding period. It is my No. 1 drug holding with MRK &

Hi Suma - I was a bit early on my buy for PFE. Bought early last month at $26.
It was a large position for me as I doubled my original purchase from five
years ago. PFE is now at a multi year low about at my original price which I
paid five years ago. Like many of the drug companies their near term prospects
for growth are quite limited. If you plan to hold for 3-5 years (or longer)
they pay an excellent dividend and will have a growth kicker (double digit
growth) in three or more years.

The stock probably can be bought at these levels over the next 6-8 months but
sooner or later, the big money will move it's way in as management provides
more clairity on their future drug pipeline.

I held my nose last week and bought a bit of MRK. I dumped my long term holding
late last year at $30 (for a small loss). If MRK ever get's to $22 like PFE, I
will double up my positions. Any good portfolio should have a basket of drug
stocks and now is the time to rebalance your holdings.

I probably will sell some of my oils and natural resource stocks (it's never
bad to take a profit) and look at more drug stocks. Don't panic as you have
plenty of time to average into your final position. I like Paul Senior's
approach... a little nibble here and a little nibble there.

Good luck.

Selling in the face of unexpected bad news. Yes, that often works out well as a
tactic to minimize losses.

Usually the news is followed by an immediate stock drop.
For me, sometimes I just figure that the bad news immediately tanking a stock
means the news is then incorporated into the stock price, so it's too late to
sell the stock. That's not worked with pharmas where there seems to be no end
to a cycle of bad news announcements followed by stock price declines.

PEORIA, Ill. - Construction giant Caterpillar Inc. said Friday third-quarter
profit grew 34 percent as strong global demand and improved prices boosted
revenue, but the company cut its full-year profit forecast on potential charges
and a higher tax rate.

Its shares tumbled more than 6 percent in pre-market trading.

Earnings increased to $667 million, or 94 cents per share, for the three months
ended Sept. 30 from $498 million, or 70 cents per share, last year. Total sales
and revenue climbed to $8.98 billion, up 17 percent from $7.66 billion a year
earlier.

Analysts were expecting adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share on revenue of
$8.47 billion, according to a Thomson Financial poll.

The company cut its full-year forecast, saying it now expects 2005 earnings of
$3.85 to $4 per share, down from its previous estimate of $4 to $4.20 per
share.

Just tired of BMY's lousy performance, seeing it on my screen month after

This worked again with PFE. Sold my shares at 22.43$. Now they are trading at a

it did. I did sell right at the open because my experience is that i am not
going to be the only one to be unpleasently surprised and going to sell,
especially with a widely held and liquid stock like PFE.

I found again and again that in the face of bad news the best (or should i say
the least unfavorable prices ) are had right at the open before the avalanche
of selling sets in. In almost all cases one can be buy at lower prices the same
day or days later.

The hard part i found is not selling at a loss but buying with the bad new

I buy and sell for a combination of maybe rational and emotional reasons, so my
behavior is not necessarily consistent.

Each situation is different. Sometimes I try to put myself in the position of
an owner: Would an owner sell because of a bad quarter? Or as a stockholder:
Where will this stock be, or could it be, in 12-24 months?

I’m diversified, and my positions are relatively very small. This enables me to
sometimes consider each stock as what I perceive a rich person might. Bad news
and/or a stock drop in an individual position isn’t going to affect me that
much. (Conversely of course, neither is good news or a stock rise in any
particular stock)
I feel I don't need to rush performance. Since most companies’ fortunes are
cyclical – not too many have continuous good times – I sometimes feel I can
afford to live with what I have and wait for the better times to come around.
Sometimes I do panic or lose patience and toss out the stock.

I agree with Spekulatius – the difficulty is getting back in if one sell on bad
news. Even if I sell and put the stock on my watch list, it seems I don’t focus
on it as a buy if/as it drifts lower – my observation of it only confirms my
judgment to have sold it. If the stock recovers, sometimes it’s so gradual, I
don’t notice it – or so abrupt I figure I’ve missed my opportunity for getting
back in. (And I am one who will sometimes buy back at a higher price than what
I sold it for.)

I'm often willing to buy into a bad situation which I suspect might be
reversed. I find that value stocks (as I figure value) commonly get even
cheaper, so I want to be prepared for this by anticipating that I might be
adding shares if the stock drops.

WSJ article on oil:

IEA Head Warns Oil Supply Could Tighten Again
By BHUSHAN BAHREE
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
October 21, 2005 7:44 p.m.; Page A3

In a sign that the recent stability in oil markets may be a temporary lull, the
International Energy Agency's executive director Friday warned that petroleum
supplies may start tightening again as early as next month.

In a phone interview with The Wall Street Journal, Claude Mandil said he was
concerned that demand for petroleum products may rebound very soon, while
repairs to hurricane-damaged energy-production facilities in the U.S. will take
much longer. That dynamic could reopen a supply gap that may have to be filled
by additional releases of oil and oil products from emergency stockpiles held
by IEA member states.

"We are not out of the woods," Mr. Mandil said, stressing that the IEA, which
oversees emergency oil-sharing arrangements among 26 of the world's leading
industrial economies, is monitoring the situation closely.

On Thursday, the IEA's governing board met in Paris and decided to forgo, for
now, any further release of oil from emergency stocks, beyond the 60 million
barrels it made available to markets after hurricanes severely damaged oil
facilities and refineries along the Gulf of Mexico. But it kept open its
previous offer for oil and refined products, which hasn't been fully taken up
by buyers.

Oil use declined after the hurricanes, as the price of gasoline and other
products jumped, and possibly also because supplies at the pump were tight. But
the U.S. and its partners in the IEA moved quickly to offer large volumes of
oil and oil products such as gasoline from emergency stocks. The U.S. also
relaxed environmental and transport rules to allow the industry to provide more
petroleum quickly.

These measures, and a belief among some economists and oil analysts that the
blow to demand may be long-lasting, have pushed down oil prices in recent
weeks.

Now, Mr. Mandil, who heads the agency that keeps the closest tabs on world oil
demand and supply, is warning that the falloff in demand may prove to be
short-lived, and that a supply crunch may be just around the corner. "It may be
difficult in November and December," Mr. Mandil said, when asked about the
prospects for adequate oil products to meet demand.

Mr. Mandil said the IEA has advised its members of the potential for tight
supplies in the months ahead, a situation that could worsen if there is a
colder-than-normal winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

"For the time being, things are rather balanced," Mr. Mandil said, adding that
"it would be absurd today to make more emergency [stock] releases." But he said
"the effect [of the hurricanes] on the supply side may be long-lasting and
continue into 2006." He cited extensive damage to oil-production and refining
facilities, and the paucity of rigs and other equipment needed to restore
production.

The IEA chief said he hoped that consumer behavior has changed and that oil use
is moderating. But he expressed skepticism that such moderation would last.

"We hope it will not be necessary to release more stocks, but I will be
watching the data carefully and, if needed, will make a recommendation to the
governing board" to provide more oil, Mr. Mandil said.

Interesting comments. I’d like to make the following observation ... In my
experience, a stock’s price movement over the medium to longer term (say 3 to
12 months), is largely driven by the QUALITY of its Fundamentals. As Value
Investors, it’s a case of recognizing those signs of QUALITY within a company’s
financial statements. If one is alerted by ‘bad news’, I would personally
suggest one determines whether the nature of that news will adversely affect
those important QUALITY criteria.
A case in point was PDX. This, in my opinion, is a good company whose stock
price plunged about 24%, virtually overnight, from about $76 to $58 at the end
of Sept. ’04. In the last 12 months it’s come back to $77 a share ... a 48%
rise in price !
The so-called ‘bad news’ was a statement that PDX cut its 3rd. & 4th. Quarter
earnings forecasts by about 6% due to its shift from commercial to government
payors. Its $3.90 to $3.94 a share earnings would also be below the $4.09
estimate by Analysts from Thomson First Call. As a result several Analysts
downgraded the stock. Yet, in the same breath, PDX announced a share buy back
of $50 million !
So here we have a company penalised in the Marketplace by a 24% fall in its
share price because of a possible 6% fall in EPS, notwithstanding the fact that
$50 million worth of shares would be removed from circulation !
It shows, in my opinion, the disproportionate influence that ‘Analysts’ can
have on the Market, as well as the true nature of the bad news that they
sometimes disseminate.
Unfortunately, in my opinion, far too many investors (not you Paul !) tend to
base their investment decisions on what their favourite Analyst has got to say,
and not on a sensible analysis of a company’s fundamentals. The collective
number of these investors can adversely affect a stock's price for no good
reason.
To quote my good friend, Dr. Karl Posel, "Realise that the market price of a
share can move in an illogical manner. Have the confidence of your calculations
to make the most of such a situation, once again realizing that logic must, and
will, ultimately return to the market."

Reinsurance companies - MRH, MXRE, PRE RNR...

Reinsurer appear to be doing OK after the storm losses - even the basket cases
like MRH and MXRE, which needed to raise capital after substantial losses. The
ease by which those companies are able to raise capital makes me think that the
rates won't raise as much in the future. From the insurers above, i like PRE
which had moderate losses relatively speaking. RNR has heavy exposure to
Florida (based on last years losses) so i assume they may have more bad news in
store after Wilma is accounted for.

AIG's losses have been relatively moderate, so i assume they should be in a
stronger position going forward, ALL is hit pretty bad, i wonder why the shares
have not corrected much. Does anyone know a storm battered insurer that he

ActivCard lowers Q4 reveue view (by 30% from $12 million to $9 million). I am
unclear if management has everything under control at this point. A new CEO
came on board early this year (after another one previously resigned after on
board only three months). Seems like there is still turmoil at the company.

The positive is that their revised revenue number is still 30% higher from what
the company did in 2004.

I have adjusted my GTC order a bit lower and looking to pick up a small
starting position. Products and technology still very good and the company has
sufficient cash and assets to keep operating.

Trinity Biotech Announces Quarter 3 Results
Thursday October 27, 9:20 am ET

Revenues Increase 25%

DUBLIN, IRELAND--(MARKET WIRE)--Oct 27, 2005 -- Trinity Biotech plc
(NasdaqNM:TRIB - News) (ISE:TRIB.I), a leading developer and manufacturer of
diagnostic products for the point-of-care and clinical laboratory markets,
today announced results for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.

Revenues in the quarter increased 25.1% to US$26.9 million compared to US$21.5
million in the same period last year.

Gross profit for the quarter amounted to US$13.2 million, representing a gross
margin of 48.9%. This compares to a gross profit of US$11.0 million in the same
period last year and represents an increase on the Quarter 2 margin of 48.2%.

R&D expenses have increased from US$1.3 million in Quarter 3 last year to
US$1.6 million in the current quarter. The increase in Administrative costs
from US$7.6 million in Quarter 2 last year to US$9.4 million in the current
year is primarily attributable to the recent Primus and RDI acquisitions.

The net effect of the above factors was an operating profit of US$2.15 million
and a profit after tax of US$1.6 million for the quarter as compared to US$1.2
million in quarter 2. This equates to an earnings per ADR for the quarter of
10.8 US cents (earnings per Ordinary Share of 2.7 US cents).

Commenting on the results, Rory Nealon, Chief Financial Officer, said, "Quarter
3 has been a quarter of continuing progress for Trinity. Our revenues have
grown by 18% on Quarter 2 and our operating margins have increased to 8.0% as
compared to 6.8% at the start of the year. We have also funded our recent
Primus acquisition entirely by bank debt which will enhance our financial
flexibility and our ability to deliver further shareholder value.

"We are especially pleased with the growth across all of our key product areas,
each of which is outperforming the market growth rates. In particular, our
infectious disease business has benefited strongly from large sales of flu
antibodies in the current quarter."

Ronan O'Caoimh, CEO, commented, "Primus, which we acquired on July 21 has
experienced very strong instrument placements during the quarter. We are
particularly excited about the new Primus Rapid Gel product which is currently
awaiting FDA approval. We expect that this approval will be granted in Quarter
2, 2006 and will enable the Company to compete in the US$200 million point of
care HbA1c market.

"Our revenues have increased US$4.16 million from US$22.71 million last quarter
to US$26.88 million this quarter. Approximately 50% of this increase is due to
our acquisition of Primus with the other 50% reflecting an excellent 8% organic
growth over the three month period. With operating profits of US$2.15 million
in the quarter we have returned to the levels of profit achieved by the Company
prior to the huge investment in our sales and marketing effort in the US during
2004. Given the growth being experienced in all product areas we are confident
of continuing this trend in profitability in coming quarters.

"In September the directors acquired a total of 4,501,675 Ordinary Shares
(1,125,419 ADR's) in the Company through a combination of 1,954,800 Ordinary
Shares purchased on the open market and 2,546,875 share options exercised. The
Directors believe that these transactions reflect the confidence and belief
that the senior executives and Board of the Company have in the future of
Trinity Biotech."

CD is one of my largest positions. SOTP valuations range from $23-25...The
market's reaction to the breakup seems eerily similar to the response to TYCO's
breakup announcement...not to imply any accounting shenanigans are likely to
surface....present management was unwitting victim not perpetrator on it's
prior accounting problem, and have been very clean since,IMO. But people
'bought' both Tyco's & Cendant's visions of syngergistic growth & earnings
stability...yet both suffered a conglomerate discount...and both fell
precipitously on breakup strategies that, on the surface made great sense:
Deconglomeratize to eliminate the conglomerate discount. I don't expect CD
follow same path as Tyco because Silverman's greed is completely visible and
non-fraudulant [He defended his compensation on Cramer's showing saying he was
being paid for the E not the P...and he's grown both top and bottom lines
dramatically since he took over].
Either the market will come to recognize the wisdom of the breakup or it will
be cancelled, IMO...it's about getting recognition for the value of the
businesses.
Due to the size of my current position [Avg cost 9.55], I'm reluctant to add.
I'm gonna take another look at DIS.

Hi Jurgis - Palu Senior might be able to provide a better description than me
for the best way to value bank stocks specifically how to treat debt. I do know
that WM does carry a lot of their own loans (portfolio lending) so this may
factor in how they book their debt. Also they recently purchased Providian
Financial and may have incurred additional debt here. Based on PE, WM IMO is
very cheap.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=WM

The positives that led me to invest in WM are:
(1) Recent purchase of Providian Financial Credit Card Division. A great new
revenue source for the company.

(2) Excellent retail branch franchise w/ quite a bit of real estate owned
facilities. Many of the branches are being remodeled and extra sq ft being sold
or leased out.

(3) Large loan Service business.

(4) Towards the end of interest rate increases so margins and spread should
stabilize and/or start expanding.

Hope that helps. I also own JPM & C so starting a new position in WM helps me
diversify my bank holdings.

Well Paul, now that both COP and XOM have reported, looks like COP grew both
revenues and profits faster (once you take out XOM's one-time gain) for both Q3
and YTD. Annualizing their Q3 profits, COP PE is only 5.6 currently, vs. 10.5
for XOM. At some point, I think this valuation gap needs to shrink.

E_K_S: Not me on this one. I don't have a way of valuing bank debt. If I look
at WM's avg. d/e over the past decade, it seems to fluctuate quite a bite.
Current amount is within the range, but nevertheless might be high. I do not
know. I'd certainly rather see less debt than more, especially if people
believe high interest rates are killers for bank stocks.

------

I believe I need to do more work on how I do evaluate bank stocks though. Maybe
take d/e into consideration. My understanding is that there are several
statistics that analysts employ. Three common ones are return on assets,
efficiency ratio, and comps (e.g. at the prices and financial numbers that
different size banks being taken private in buyouts). For me simplicity rules -
even if I would be wrong sometimes. So I don't like efficiency ratio, because
that number is not easily available or easily screened for. Special companies
or devoted analysts keep records of all buyouts, and their reports of private
market value numbers aren't available to me. That leaves ROA, which IS easily
found in a Yahoo looksee. Consistent high ROA means a "good" bank, but doesn't
follow necessarily a value buy. Consistent low ROA means a "crummy" bank, but
doesn't necessarily mean it's not a good buy. What's needed (and again for me,
I want something easily obtainable) is to relate ROA to some other metric that
contains price. (Since price ultimately determines value, i.e. my assumption
being that most stocks could be a buy if the price is right.) Right now I'm
using p/bk in a rough judgmental thing (as opposed to a mathematical
relationship which is what I would prefer). So if a bank has relatively high
ROA, say 1.5%,and
relatively low p/bk (say 1.2), that bank would be a buy imo. But if the p/bk
were closer to 2.5, the stock would not be a buy. Anyway, as I say, I'd like to
eventually refine this approach to be more quantitative and maybe more
encompassing of important variables (if I came to know what they were).

For WM, with a p/bk of 1.5 (a positive: it's a relatively low ratio for WM) and
an ROA of 1.0%, I'd say now that WM is a mediocre bet at current price. Of
course there are other aspects here that might be overarching: WM's broad
geographic diversity, it's large business in mortgage servicing, the steady
climb in the stock's book value, the debt, etc.

For me, I have turned my Providian shares into WM, which I'm holding. It's only
a small bet or me. And also, like you for diversity, I have JPM & C. And BAC.

Sold my OFG on the bounce yesterday at a loss to buy a position in WHI, which
is a better managed bank (and more expensive by some metrics). Wrong decision
so far. I believe that WHI and OFG are the best buys amongst the Puerto Rican
banks out there. Those stocks have weaker earnings for sure but they have been
pounded hard due to collateral damage from DRL and RGF.

OSHC had a decent quarter 9c earnings/share (which earlly is 0.09/0.45=0.2$ if
one does not count the MHC shares). Decent loan & deposit growth but they will
need to work the efficiency ratio down by lowering the costs. Most mutual
conversions tend to have high efficiency ratios (which means high relative
costs) due to expenses associated with being a public company.

I am owning OSHC and ISBC in the mutual conversion space and intend to add more
WHI.

Franklin Street Properties Corp. Announces Stock Repurchase Program
Friday October 28, 1:40 pm ET

WAKEFIELD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 28, 2005--Franklin Street Properties
Corp. (AMEX:FSP - News) today announced that its Board of Directors has
authorized the repurchase of up to $35 million of the company's common stock
from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

George J. Carter, President and CEO, said the following: "FSP has recently sold
several properties in its portfolio. The sale proceeds have been reinvested in
new acquisitions. There continue to be properties in our portfolio which we
believe could have potential as sale candidates for a variety of reasons, some
"property specific" and some "market driven." However, we generally consider
property sales viable only if there is a potentially better property, or other
investment, in which to reinvest the sale proceeds. Without any permanent
mortgage debt, and with significant cash already on the balance sheet, property
sales generate cash that is not currently needed for reserves or for mortgage
debt pay down. Consequently, identifiable, targeted and controlled reinvestment
vehicles for these sale proceeds are important. Current high market pricing and
competition for potentially acceptable property acquisitions continue to
present challenges, but new opportunities are beginning to appear more
plentiful than in the past two years. Upgrading FSP's portfolio is an ongoing
objective. In addition to new real estate acquisitions in which to reinvest
proceeds from portfolio property sales, the company, because of its public
listing on the AMEX on June 2, 2005, now has the option to more easily reinvest
its cash into its own stock. The adoption of the stock repurchase program will
allow the company the option of investment of its cash in its stock in addition
to investment in new acquisition properties, when the relative financial
opportunity is favorable."

The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the
company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other
factors. Repurchases may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would
permit shares to be repurchased when the company might otherwise be precluded
from doing so under insider trading laws. The repurchase program may be
suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available
for use in connection with its stock plans and for other corporate purposes.

The repurchase program will be funded using the company's working capital.
Franklin Street Properties Corp. had approximately 60,525,608 shares of common
stock outstanding as of October 27, 2005.

working after a few months)

thing. (Along with the insiders)

Reinsurers - PTP and IPCR

IPCR: I've had the stock since '99. I sold all my shares off in late Aug. &
early Sept.

Too tough for me to figure out what's happening with their reinsurance
exposures and possible problems.

If I look at Yahoo, I see a company with no long term debt, selling 1.16x
stated book. The stock is at a three or four year low now.

Of all the times to issue stock, they have to issue stock now? I presume that
it is so - they must be in trouble and they have to. Looks like 12M+ shares to
be issued for a company with 48M out. That's a substantial dilution, imo.

For me, I have no sense now of what the price/value proposition might be. I
presume the stock is worth more than book value. But I can't say what book
value is at this time with all the claims they've got and might be getting. And
in previous years, the stock has traded below book value. OTOH, somebody will
be taking 12 million shares, so these folks who are buying must have some
confidence in IPCR's value and/or its future. I wonder at what price the stock
will be offered to them. Less than current price, I would guess.

Jmo, I could be wrong.

IPCR - The Company has no choice but to issue stock because they suffered
significant losses ($13.50 a share?) this hurricane season and needs to pacify
the rating agencies. If they got their rating cut below say A-, they would have
great difficulty writing policies in the US.

AIG is an investor in the company from what I understand and they intend to
participate in the placement.

I think the shares would be sold at a slight discount to its current market
price, probably $25.

IPCR. I've had a few insurance stocks where AIG was the principal and
controlling shareholder - TRH, TW. Never have been able to figure if that was a
positive or negative for the small shareholder. On balance, I'd say a negative.
For TW after the Calif. earthquake, AIG infused the company with money (in
return for more stock and control, of course); for TRH, it seems the company is
run under AIG and not really with an emphasis on maximizing shareholder value
(with TRH stock price gains). For IPCR, I never noticed AIG's influence,
although they're the big shareholder. I was always hoping to be surprised by
Greenberg (AIG) making a buyout of these companies, but that never occurred.

Thank you for the complement but I never get it completely right and I am
always off on the short term timing. What really matters is if you hit the long
term value proposition by selling the over priced equity and buying in on the
undervalued company.

Also, I never do the move at one time but in small chunks. I will never
completely sell out of any position as holding onto even a very small lot
allows me to continue to follow the company and sector.

I like LLY and have owned it in the past. I also like JnJ but it is not
undervalued enough (I am waiting for $55 or less).

The other sectors I like for a possible rebalance are moving some monies out of
my Oils and/or gold & natural resource companies and into the large banks (WM,
JPM, C). I have had excellent moves in my natural resource companies including
BHP, AU, and AAUK. I am over weighted in these stocks & oils. My theory on
holding these types of companies is it protected my purchasing power against
inflation. I will probably keep a slightly over weighted component of these
companies in my portfolios but will try to find a home for the excess gains in
other undervalued sectors like the drugs and large banks.

The final consideration is to make sure that any moves pay a comparable of
higher dividend. One would be surprised how this extra revenue stream from
dividends adds up especially in a tax deferred account (i.e. IRA).

Generally speaking, when big reinsurance/insurance companies invest in smaller
companies, they want to participate in the cycle. AIG really doesn't need to
acquire anyone, IMO. They already have the expertise and infrastructure to
write whatever business they want to and can move in and out of areas of the
market they see opportunity in.

I think there will be a wave of consolidation within the next couple of years
in the reinsurance sector as we have seen in previous cycles. Although if the
pricing environment continues to improve as I believe it will, the mgt of these
smaller names will be less inclined to sell or merge.

acquire, they also wouldn't much let anyone else acquire the company either.
And maybe they might constrain the smaller company from expanding in ways that
might be profitable for the smaller company but competitive with the larger.

I'm not so much aware of consolidation within the business cycle. I was more
struck by how many new players came into business when the business looked good
(that is, rates were increasing). Experienced insurance managers apparently
getting large amounts of capital, often backed by large insurers. (Wasn't there
a scandal involving AON and the reinsurer they set up????). Trying to recall a

I'm not sure how much an AIG would have in their investment if they don't
control a majority of the shares outstanding. As you know, there are other
investors like reinsurance/insurance brokers along with private equity
investors who will want to maximize their return on investment.

I don't remember the specific instance involving AOC though. An example that
comes to mind is AXS. They were backed by MMC and CB among others. MMC was
funneling the most attractive business to AXS for first consideration before
getting bids from other carriers.

itilis0023,

Nitpicking aside, your suppositions about the resignation aren't very
convincing. Usually execs hold on during a sell out because of the golden
parachute. Resigning early usually means foregoing a good package.

Similarly, they usually hold on if the operating situation improves
dramatically as they make money on stock options and bonuses.

That doesn't mean I am a seller here, but it doesn't make me enthusiastic.

Franklin Street Properties Corp. Announces Third Quarter 2005 Results
Monday October 31, 4:15 pm ET

WAKEFIELD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 31, 2005----Franklin Street Properties
Corp. ("Franklin Street Properties", the "Company" or "FSP") (AMEX: FSP - News)
announced today net income, Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Cash Available for
Distribution (CAD) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005.
The Company evaluates its performance based on net income, EPS and CAD, and
believes each is an important measure. The Company considers these measurements
in determining distributions paid to equity holders. A reconciliation of net
income to CAD is provided on page 2 of this press release.

EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2005 increased $0.30 per share to
$0.44 per share compared to the three months ended September 30, 2004. Net
income was $26.8 million or $0.44 per share (based on 60.5 million shares),
compared to $6.9 million or $0.14 per share (based on 49.6 million shares) in
2004.
CAD for the three months ended September 30, 2005 increased $0.10 per share to
$0.31 per share compared to the three months ended September 30, 2004. CAD was
$18.7 million or $0.31 per share (based on 60.5 million shares), compared to
$10.3 million or $0.21 per share (based on 49.6 million shares) in 2004.
EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 increased $0.16 per share to
$0.84 per share compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2004. Net
income was $46.7 million or $0.84 per share (based on 55.7 million shares),
compared to $33.8 million or $0.68 per share (based on 49.6 million shares) in
2004.
CAD for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $48.0 million or $0.86 per
share (based on 55.7 million shares), compared to $43.0 million or $0.87 per
share (based on 49.6 million shares) for the same period in 2004.
The increases in net income and CAD for the three and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2005 were primarily attributable to:

Increased net operating income from four properties acquired by merger
effective April 30, 2005, and acquisitions of two properties in Colorado and
Indiana. The purchase price of the properties acquired was financed with
proceeds from asset sales of properties in our portfolio. The last two asset
sales, which were for two residential properties in Houston, were completed in
October and our line of credit was repaid in full.
Gains on sales of assets for the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2005 of $14.3 million and $13.2 million, respectively. Included were sales
of a residential property in Louisiana and sale by transfer of interest in an
office property in Maryland, which were sold at an aggregate gain of $14.0
million; a gain on contribution of land of $339,000; and a loss on the sale of
a property in California of $1.1 million, which had been provided for in our
second quarter, and closed in early July. Net gains on sale of assets were
$0.24 per share for both the three and nine month periods.
Stronger investment banking results in the third quarter of 2005 compared to
2004. Gross proceeds on the sale of securities, which our investment banking
revenues are based upon, for the three months ended September 30, 2005 were
$44.0 million compared to $2.7 million during the same period in 2004. However,
investment banking results for the nine month periods were lower in 2005 than
2004, as gross proceeds were $105.3 million compared to $134.9 million during
the same period in 2004.

Real Estate and Investment Banking Update

During 2005 we have acquired four properties by merger and two by acquisition.
We have sold, or are under agreement to sell, a total of six properties. As of
September 30, 2005, three of the six property sales were completed, and the
remaining three have been classified in our balance sheet as assets
held-for-sale. Earlier in October we completed the sale of two of these
properties at a gain of approximately $10.2 million, and the last property sale
is expected to result in a gain in December.

A supplemental schedule is attached which presents the continuing real estate
portfolio of 28 properties as of September 30, 2005.

During the quarter ending September 30, 2005 we completed two investment
banking transactions, one was for an office property in Dallas, Texas, and the
other was for development of an office property in Houston, Texas. Another
investment banking transaction is planned for the fourth quarter.

Dividend announcement:

On October 5, 2005 the Board of Directors of FSP declared a cash dividend of
$0.31 per share of common stock payable on November 21, 2005 to stockholders of
record as of October 31, 2005. The total amount of dividends declared to date
during 2005 is $1.24 per share.

Message from George J. Carter, President and CEO

George J. Carter, President and CEO of the Company, commented as follows:

"Improving Net Income, EPS and CAD levels for the third quarter of 2005 were
expected and, consequently, planned for within the FSP business/investment
model. I am optimistic about the Company's financial performance outlook for
the balance of 2005 and going into 2006.

More specifically, financial results for the third quarter of 2005 reflected:
#1) solid performance in rental operations from the Company's portfolio of
properties; #2) significant gains from real estate sales and the reinvestment
of those sale proceeds into newly-acquired properties; and #3) the closing of
real estate investment banking business totaling $44 million. All three of
these areas of the Company's operations are showing good potential for
continued contribution to FSP's financial performance in the coming months.

#1) For the third quarter of 2005, the Company's continuing portfolio of 28
properties was 93% leased. Most of FSP's properties are suburban office
buildings, and, in most of our markets, we are finding improving conditions for
both occupancy and rental rates. However, there are still many tenant leases
which were signed at the height of the most recent office market cycle
(approximately 1997-2001). If those leases were to roll to market today either
through renewal or vacancy/new tenant, many could still suffer a "roll-down" in
rental rates. An improving U.S. economy and corresponding increase in demand
for office space in most markets is very encouraging, and FSP is aggressively
managing its lease turnover to maximize our rental operations' contribution as
the office markets begin to climb back up their cyclical curve. Concern always
remains about the possibility of a new, significant downturn in the broader
economy that would reverse the positive trends our markets are seeing now.
Disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita still have unknown longer-term
economic effects, and concerns about potential rising worldwide energy prices,
inflation and interest rates are likely to be influencing factors.

#2) During the third quarter of 2005, the Company sold two properties for
significant gains. Early in the fourth quarter, FSP sold two additional
properties also for significant gains. All of the proceeds from these sales
were used to pay down the Company's line of credit, which had been drawn down
to purchase two new acquisition properties ahead of the contemplated portfolio
sales. FSP now owns the two new acquisition properties without any debt (i.e.,
all cash), as it does every other property in its portfolio. A portion of these
asset sales and new acquisitions were completed using a "reverse 1031 exchange"
program, which defers gain recognition for tax purposes. There continue to be
properties in our portfolio which we believe have potential as sale candidates
for a variety of reasons, some "property specific" and some "market driven."
However, we generally consider property sales viable only if there is a
potentially better property, or other investment, in which to reinvest the sale
proceeds. Without any permanent mortgage debt, and with significant cash
already on the balance sheet, property sales generate cash that is not
currently needed for reserves or for mortgage debt pay down. Consequently,
identifiable, targeted and controlled reinvestment vehicles for these sale
proceeds are important. Current high market pricing and competition for
potentially acceptable property acquisitions continue to present challenges,
but new opportunities are beginning to appear more plentiful than in the past
two years. Upgrading FSP's portfolio is an ongoing objective. In addition to
new real estate acquisitions in which to reinvest proceeds from portfolio
property sales, the Company, because of its public listing on the AMEX on June
2, 2005, now has the option to more easily reinvest its cash into its own
stock. On October 28, 2005, FSP's Board of Directors approved a share
repurchase program. The adoption of the stock repurchase program will allow the
Company the option of investment of its cash in its stock in addition to
investment in new acquisition properties, when the relative financial
opportunity is favorable.

#3) Third quarter investment banking business improved over the first and
second quarters of 2005, totaling $44 million of "closed-in" investor capital
subscribed in two separate property transactions. One of the transactions
involved the raising of $27 million to fund FSP Park Ten Development Corp., the
Company's first pure development project. FSP has several properties in its
portfolio which have excess developable land, and in the case of FSP Park Ten
Development Corp., the Company contributed land it owned for an equity stake in
the new project. We also earned a development fee from this transaction. FSP's
Investment Banking group has had a difficult time during the last two years
finding properties that meet its investment return criteria. Higher pricing and
greater competition for quality commercial real estate have reduced the number
of attractive potential acquisitions we would consider. However, new property
acquisition opportunities become available all the time, and with interest
rates just beginning to rise on medium- and long-term debt instruments, cap
rate pricing and competitive demand pressures may start to become more
favorable to our investment return model. Historically, our investment bank's
equity sourcing capability tends to be somewhat counter-cyclical, and we
believe that the current pricing/valuation climate for commercial investment
properties is likely to be viewed in retrospect as just another point in time
of what has historically been a cyclical capital market asset."

As for SPORs executive leaving....90 day notices are not common.

Maybe the company is getting rid of him because he is in over his head and
allowing him to "resign" this way to save face and increase his chances of
finding another job ?

Besides, he just got the job in feb 04.

This doesnt appear to me to be the captian jumping off the ship prior to it
going down.

VIA. Earnings beat estimates, like they did last quarter. 10% YOY revenue
growth. Sharecount down 7.5% YOY. Good FCF. Next year CBS will look much better
due to better add revenues (odd years are lean years for TV ads). Split
pending, yet the stock is near it's lows. I added some more yesterday and think
it's a great value amongst the media companies. What am I missing?

An earnings miss by MCGC has dropped the stock to new 12-month low and put its
dividend yield to over 11%.

A definite opportunity in my opinion.

I just can't be sure if it's an opportunity to buy or a signal to get out. -g-

Anyway, I've added more shares to my position this a.m.

Here is one I unloaded on in the beginning of October. I sold all of my shares

back and felt it got way ahead of itself. The company is Texas Utility (TXU).

It was quite undervalued a few years back but you can see when compared to the

It's never bad to take a profit. I was also a bit lucky on this one as I never
expected it to run so high... especially a utility company.

E_K_S: "I bought this one as a teenager a few years back",

You're a kid!! (Well, compared to me, anyway, lol) Usually, stockbuyers who are
teenagers aren't able to hold on to their "investments". Flit from one hot
thing to another is what I would guess.

"It's never bad to take a profit."

That is not true. It is often wrong to take a profit prematurely. Very wrong.
'You can't go broke taking a profit' is one of the worst of Wall Street
sayings.

Hi Paul Senior - No I am not a teenager but what I was saying is I was able to
purchase my small amount of TXU a few years back when it was around 19. For me,
selling is one of the most difficult decisions. I have a tendency to buy and
hold (something my father taught me). So, when I do have a profit, I like to at
least hedge a portion so I lock it in.

What I do find from many investors is once they sell, they must (or want to)
put their money into something else immediately. Sometimes its good to hold
onto your cash and wait for a buying opportunity later.

I am in my late forties. Just had my birthday last week. I starting investing
at age 15 with monies from my paper route. I have been managing my portfolios
full time for the last 10 years. I continue to study the market and learn new
things every day.

I have been most successful with the value approach in finding investment
opportunities. A lot of your work is right on in the way you select equities.
When you do sell, please explain more of your reasons as to how your arrive at
this decision.

To develop a good exit strategy on an investment is probably one of the most
difficult decisions.

E_K_S: I don't like that my portfolios have become a lot more volatile lately;
I'm either going to have to adjust my positions, stay away from my screen, or
learn to live with relatively large ups and downs.

I'm one of those investors who, once they sell, want to reinvest proceeds as
quickly as I get ideas, and I get a lot of ideas. You are right though (from my
experience) that sometimes, just holding on to cash is the better alternative.

I've decided to risk more money on MCGC. I'll take the dividend yield and
likely mediocre stock appreciation: I expect from here that the stock will be
pretty quiet, which is maybe what I need or just want in my portfolios. (OTOH,
it's possible that this stock could crater further or have its own volatile
performance.)

To that end, I've freed up some capital to buy MCGC which I purchased several
times during the day today. I don't normally describe sales - I assume not too
many here are interested in sales from purchases made years ago. Anyway, for
most of these sales today and yesterday, my reasoning is that I'd rather have
more MCGC than continue holding these stocks (all of which are in an IRA):

EPIQ: seems fairly valued at current and forward p/e. But co. has in past sold
at higher multiples of book and sales. Sold half my small position (purchased
3/05).

WRLD: Forward p/e is 11, but p/sales is over 3 - a historically high number for
this company. I have a small long term position in a taxable account. In my IRA
I've now closed out the shares there. (Resulting in a slight loss on a few tiny
purchases made in '04 and '05.)

CPT: A play on Houston apartments benefitting from Katrina move-ins. I now
guess the stock isn't going to move much, and if MCGC isn't going to move much
either, I'd rather have the much larger MCGC dividend. Closed my exploratory
CPT position.

FRO: Getting tired holding this tanker stock. It fluctuates quite a bit and
I've got a bunch of shares. I'd rather have a slightly trimmed position and
some freed-up cash for other, different bets. (I have several tanker stocks,
none of which is doing well these days.)

ORI: Nice insurance company with a good dividend history. Stock doesn't seem to
be going anywhere last couple years. I am guessing if I want to get back in
later, I can do so near current price. Sold my position (3/'03 purchase). I
experience some boredom here exacerbated by only holding a few shares.

VSEA: Tech stock holdover. Poor earnings recently announced. Sold 3/4 of a very
small position (3/'00 purchase). I'm tired of not understanding the business,
and I give up on the stock.

ATML: Okay, I mostly give up on this one. Sold 1/2 my shares. (7/03 purchase)
Losing money here, but worse than that, I have been VERY aware every day I see
the stock that I was once warned about ATML by J. Bash and Spekulatius. I
would've loved to have proven them wrong - and confronted them with it -g- ---
and now I sure don't like admitting they were right. So I won't. -g-

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readreplies.aspx?subjectid=10036&nonstock=False&
sgid=19102318

HUM: At current price I can't decide if this hospital chain is fully-valued or
not. I have more shares than I believe I'd like (11/02, 5/04 purchases); I'll
take some out of play.

MLS: Announced surprisingly poor earnings last night. I'd been trimming
position (3/'99 shares, held in a "mom" account), and I sold remainder after
hours yesterday. It's a REIT and now with poor earnings and possible
accounting/management problems, coupled with relatively low dividend yield -
I'm out. Perhaps better opportunities for me are with MCGC.

Also, again fwiw, in addition to buys of MCGC today, I added to small positions
in HBP (low p/e) and CRMT. (Their business model (used trucks and pay-where-you
buy)seems to be working.)

Nice to see PDX maintaining their good performance. Further to my previous
message, 22331, I see their latest declared Quarterly EPS is $1.29, up from
their previous $1.17. They also hit a high of $78.68/share yesterday, which is
about 50% up from their dramatic fall, in Sept.'04, to $52.65, primarily as a
result of shareholders reading too much into the "estimates" of "Analysts"
(those highly paid individuals who often don't appear to have a firm grasp of
the fundamental analysis of a company's financial statements). The ironic thing
was, that the next EPS, after the fall, was $1.08 compared to the previous
$1.03, before the fall !
I wonder if this stock ever formed part of the "50% Gains Investing" portfolio
?

I'd normally consider JBSS, given that its stock trades below stated book
value. Unfortunately that is often the case with this particular stock. So I
can't tell if it's a bargain now and worth a buy, or not. OTOH, book value has
increased every year for past ten at least. That's a positive imo for these
distributor type companies.
