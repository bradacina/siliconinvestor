<There are two ways of deciding on your discount rate IF you are going to
forecast. First, you could go the theoretical route and plug Beta into the CAPM
equation. Not hard. That's what Reginald is arguing, and it is totally sound in
terms of theoretical finance. OR you can say, what do I want to earn off this
stock over the long term. If that's 9%, use 9%. If its 15%, use 15%. I'm not
looking for the theoretical value of the stock - I m looking for the price at
which I would invest in it and sleep well.>

See the lsecond to last paragraph of reply #999. My method is much more
conservative than yours. The discount rate serves as a breakeven point (the
point at which you will be at equilibrium with a so-called risk free
investment. most of us wish to do better than that, or we would simply invest
directly into the risk free investment.

OK, lets get this right.

My discount rate has nothing to do with beta. It is what I want to get for a
return. If you do not understand that, then it is you, not me, that needs a
lesson on DCF valuation. The beta argument values a stock at what it is
"worth", in some theoretical sense, which I would question. I am trying to get
to the price at which I would buy. Lets not mix those up.

Asset valuation may or may not be based on the balance sheet. I am not arguing
for buying at book value. To return to my Red Roof Inns example, I don't care
what the book value of the assets is, I care what similar hotels are trading
for in the real estate market, and what it costs to build a new one.

But the argument I really want to explore with you is the basis for your
valuation methodology. I challenged forecasting by arguing that you cannot be
at all confident in forecasts 2, 5 and 10 years out. Let alone "terminal
value", which may make up 75% of the value of a growth company like the ones
you are talking about. You told me to refer to an example of an annuity. There
is a very big difference between an annuity and a forecast of the cash flows of
Microsoft or Intel. You know what you are going to get from an annuity. You
don't with a stock. Would you take a bet that your forecasts are within 50% 10
years out? I wouldn't. And that is not meant to say that your forecasts are any
worse than anybody else's. I am only questioning the reliance you place on
them.

The analogy between an annuity and a stock is only relevant in theoretical
terms, which is not what we are debating.

Reginald, this is a good debate which hopefully will unearth a lot of the

We are not alone, there are a lot of people reading this who know finance.
Referring to your post, tell me just how a 9% discount rate could possibly be
MORE conservative than a 15% discount rate, in our hypothetical (actually real)

I thought I explained it already. Let us use the economic charge approach vs.
your discounting approach, which should clairfy things. Your apporach says, I
want ot make 15% on my money, hence I use 15% as a discounting factor for
future cash flows and assets. I say that the discounting factor is simply a
breakeven point, or hurdle rate, at which point you start counting the basis
points to your return. If 9% is the agreed upon cost of capital, and you say
you wish to use 15% since that is the true return you desire (and more
indicative of risk). I am saying that you are not getting a 15% economic return
on your money, you are only getting a 6% return. To illustrate: You are
searching for a company whose "real" return is expected to be 15%, and you find
two companies whose cost of capital is 9%. You do not trust that as a risk
benchmark, so you use 15% as your minimum acceptable return (because you are
desiring a 15% return). Company A returns 15% per year net ROIC on $1000 (that
=$150), and company B returns 24% net ROIC on $1000. (that=$240). According to
your method, you are assuming that you are fully compensated for the risk wiht
a mimum of a 15% return (adjusted for the time value of money - that is what it
apears you are saying). I am saying that for a 9% risk, you are not receiving
due compensation for a 15% return. Let's walk through it. Company A returns 15%
on a $1000,investment which = $150. You then apply a captial charge (for the
risk assumed, which brings the investment on par with the risk accepted on a 10
year t-bill), which would amount to (9% x $1000 investment = $90) $90. Your net
return for a 9% risk in company A is $60 (ROIC of $150 less capital charge of
$90), or 6% ($60/$1,000). Now, company B, has a ROIC of $240 (24% times the
initial investment of $1,000) and once a capital charge is applied (less $90 or
9% x $1,000 initial invesmtent), you are left with a net, economic value of
$150 (or 15%, $150/$1,000 original investment), which was your original
requested return. If we both invested in company A, I would see a risk adjusted
return of 6%, (six percent as adjusted for the risk free rate), while you (as I
understand you) are syaing that you will see a return of 15%.

Which sounds like the more conservative method?

There is a HUGE flaw in your reasoning which it took three reads to capture.
You are implicitly assuming one pays book value for the investment. The return
on invested capital of 24% or 15% in your example is based on BOOK VALUE, not
the price one would pay for the stock. Let's get this right because its very
important - 24% ROIC DOES NOT MEAN 24% RETURN TO ME AS AN INVESTOR UNLESS I
PAID EXACTLY BOOK VALUE FOR THE STOCK. But of course you could never buy such
an investment for book value.

If I buy a stock, the 15% which I (and any DCF) uses to as a discount rate is
the return on the price you paid for the investment. This is the difference
between finance and accounting.

I am not interested in writing a finance textbook here, but that was a big one.

You are wrong, because I have not mentioned book value ONCE, nor implied it. I
have never mentioned what the indivudual pays for the asset, only what its
value would be after the calculation. Like you said, I don't want to write an
investment thesis either, but we are going to hafve to come to terms. I am
measuring cash flows, not book value. That is why I said you are going to have
a problem valuing companies in the information age. Book value does not
represent invested capital (at all). If anything, a reconciliation of the cash
flow statement is what you would use to base ROIC on, definitely not book
value.

< Let's get this right because its very important - 24% ROIC DOES NOT MEAN 24%
RETURN TO ME AS AN INVESTOR UNLESS I PAID EXACTLY BOOK VALUE FOR THE STOCK.>

24% ROIC means a gross, return less the capital charge, equals economic value.
Market value tracks economic value VERY closely. Let's look at the situation
from a historical (hence, factual) point of view.
http://www.sternstewart.com/1000performance1.html

Your misunderstanding is emanating from the use of the discounting figure. The
reason why the cost of capital is used as the discounting figure is because it
encapulates the risk the market has placed on an asset. Anything above that
risk level is considered economic value. I would link you to my representation,
but I have summarized it already. My site literally has several megabytes of
downloadable information on methods that I have used to improve upon this
concept and which I have encapsulated in what I call Knowledgeware. See the

After reading your reply over again, I think I can get you to see where I am
coming form. Treasuries often lead to a zero net real return, as I have
explained in earlier posts, factoring inflation, taxes, etc. Suppose you have a
10 year T-note yielding 6%. What will be your discount rate for a 10 year
horizon? I assume you say 6%, ro close to that. Now if you were to choose a
company like MO in lieu of the T-note, with a WACC of 9%, what would you see as
you discount rate and why. If you choose 9%, than you are requesting a return
that is on par with that of the T-note, adjusted for risk. If you choose 15%,
than you are requesting a return 6% more than the t-note, adjusted for risk.
24%? etc. What will your IRR be?

If I were to by MSFT two years ago, should I have used a 100% discount rate due
to the fact that it returned 200% over that two year period? Of course not, I
should use the appropriate risk rate, which is in most cases, the WACC.

About talking to a wall....... LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY. INVESTED CAPITAL CONSISTS

Once again for the road. Beta is used to calculate the equity capital charge
and is related to volatility which affects debt pricing. The most valuable
comapnies have overcome their capital charge by a significant amount. The most
valuable companies, I repeat. And if there is any doubt, you can refer to the
historical calculations which I posted earlier. This is directly related to the
subject of value, since the value of these companies are what is being
measured. I even went so far as to explain how one priced the value of these
companies in order to ascertain the "margin of safety" in a particalur
investment.

Ok, I understand now. Usually invested capital means something different. You
should clarify that one at the outset. Probably if I could have downloaded your
model (I can't do it without messing around with some Excel viewer on the web)
I would have seen how you calculated that.

The Stern-Stewert list (you might want to repost that link - everybody should
take a look at it) has been in a lot of publications. It does show exactly what
you said, that the companies which have created the most value have return on
capital (defined in the traditional way, I believe) well in excess of its cost.
Really, I cannot understand why this is taken to be so profound. This is from
the "Well, Duh" school of finance.

What that list of companies does not tell you is what this thread is supposed
to be all about. Value investing. This has a very different meaning than "value
creation" or "valuable companies". Value in the Graham sense is buying
something (whether a good company or a bad one) for a fraction of what it is
worth. We know these are good companies, but are they good investments at the
price you have to pay? Even superior return on equity (or return on whatever
denominator you want to use) is probably already discounted in the price.
History tells us that for truly great companies, it is usually over-discounted
(i.e. the stocks are overvalued) unless, like Buffett, you buy them when people
don't think they are so great. Also, the Stern list is historical data, and
extrapolating from great historical financials is exactly what a value investor
does NOT want to do.

Sorry about the misunderstanding on that one point, but it really doesn't
change my argument. Would love to hear some other opinions.

"It always seemed, and still seems,ridiculously simple to say that if one can
acquire a diversified group of common stocks at a price less than the
applicable net current assets alone...the results should be satisfactory. They
were so, in our experience for more than 30 years-say, between 1923 and
1957-excluding a time of real trial in 1930-1932. Has this approach any
relevance at the beginning of 1971. Our answer would be a qualified 'yes.' A
quick runover of the Stock Guide would have uncovered some 50 or more issues
that appeared to be obtainable at or below net-current-asset value." ??

Geez, on a Value investing thread, somebody should be able to stick up for Dr.
Graham. How could you ever imagine him NOT saying something about net-nets
(even, as I suggested, he moved away from it by 1976. And if you're gonna come

did not move away from it in 1976. "It has returned in quantity since the

Now that we can move on. You can use economic value, let's use true value (my
derivative) form now on, to ascertain a stock selling at a deep discount. What
you do is discount the economic value to be generated by the appropriate risk
rate, and compare that projection to the actual market value. That is part of
what my model does. Now, most of the market must disagree with the overvaluing,
or undervaluing, or a stock in order for a market oppurtunity to occur
(remember Buffet's comment - if there really were an efficient market, I would
be holding a tin can, or something like that). This is the reason why Buffet
saw so much oppurtunity in KO, and this is why there is so much oppurtunity in
MSFT, both companies are spewiing value at a rate that beggars the competition
and the broad market, yet the common (institutional) investor does not see it,
hence the discount in price. The MSFT is overpriced theory has been made for 4
year and running now, and both MSFT's economic spread and the net amount of
invested capital has increased significantly year after year (MSFT should be on
top of that list for the 96-97 year).

John Langston: You misinterpreted my post. I said if Graham were alive I

what worked. A product of the depression, he probably would continue to work at
his craft. The alternative being do nothing different and pull out of stocks
(if there were not enough stocks to choose based on his latest criteria.)

I do think value investors who follow Graham are adjusting their techniques to
reflect some of the reality of this market. John Neff, with his rule of 6's --
buy when the p/e is 6 and there is a 6% yield... those days are (mostly)gone.
But if John Neff is still investing, I proffer that he is still a value
invester and still picking stocks that will go up... but he has tweaked his
methods. Tweedy Browne, the classic Graham people. Now sticking to their
knitting, going overseas for their value stocks too. But also buying stocks
like Fuji Photo Film, Nestle (Sun 10/96 NYT)- stocks with a margin of safety,
but only if an expert looks at the balance sheet (I think). Also, as Buffet has
done, going beyond Graham, in looking at other criteria (Glassman, Wash. Post
12/31/95). Still using and basing on, of course, price to asset, low p/e, and
all the good value criteria.
It would be great if there were methods that worked absolutely - maybe there
are - but the market has to make appropriate stock available. I think value
investors have to change - NOT LOWER THEIR STANDARDS - to find where the
intrinsic value and purchase price points are in this market. For example,
using PSR's. JMO. Paul

Great post.

I had the good fortune to see a number of esteemed value investors speak last
year in a class at Columbia (Graham's old value investing class that Gabelli
and Buffett took). Almost all of them talked about net-net buys as the ideal,
but each said don't waste much time looking for them today. Though they did not
say you will never see them again.

In today's world of computer screens, net-nets of successful businesses are
just too easy to find, and there are plenty of us looking for them. So you
preserve Graham's logic of buying things for less than they are worth, not
based on some forecast, but based on what is there today. But you have to relax
the "2/3 of net-net value" criteria, otherwise there's nothing to invest in. I
don't think Graham would have had a problem with that. Although in today's
market I have no doubt he would have been at least half in, as he liked to say,
"high quality bonds". Held to maturity of course - not like Vinik.

Gottfried,

Certainly is. There are major flaws in the
model which are pretty obvious.

It is interesting, and there is
science behind it. But it ignores
cyclicals (GM), its costs of capital
are debatable, and it relies heavily
on projected earnings, among other
things.

Also, like all models based on
projection, the projections tend
to be optimistic and don't allow
for adverse news/new competition.

Good luck,

RESTATEMENT OF PURPOSE FOR THE VALUE INVESTING THREAD

This thread is about value investing "in the Graham tradition."

A "Margin of Safety" as Graham and Buffett and other well-known
value investors (Klarman, Kahn, etc.) define
it should be incorporated to some extent into approaches
and ideas posted here. Net asset plays, overlooked stocks, stocks under
temporary stress, a bear market/correction all create opportunities with a
margin of safety.

Keeping this key concept in mind, please feel free to propose approaches and
investment ideas on which the thread may comment. Questions of all kinds are
especially welcome, because if you have a question, it's likely many of us do
too.

In general the goal will be to present ideas, get feedback,
and move on. Updates on specific ideas at future dates are
most welcome and help us all keep perspective. But 10-20
posts should be the maximum for any but the most extraordinary
of subjects. Such volume indicates the subject is interesting and
especially deserving of its own thread.

Alternatives for greater discussion of particularly
controversial topics are e-mail and a new thread.

This thread, however, should focus on "traditional" value
investing based on a margin of safety in the stock price.

If you do not understand what I mean by "margin of safety,"
please e-mail me. Those that understand this concept
or want to understand it better, please continue to contribute.

Neo-value investing approaches that make extensive
use of projections into the future may be better served
by a new thread devoted entirely to them.

I apologize for the interruption, but it was never my
goal for this to become one of SI's most posted-to threads.
My own offenses are very much recognized and I will
limit myself in the future.

Good investing,
Michael Burry

An obscene value investment. One that won't show up on any of your screens.

Tejon Ranch Company (TRC) owns 270,000 acres of land in Southern California.
Just one hour north of LA. This is a pure asset play - the company earns
virtually nothing. The market cap is $220 million, no debt. Do a little
division and you get to about $800 an acre. Land in the area is selling for
$5-10 thousand per acre.

This won't show up on a book value screen because the land is on the books at
pre-1936 cost. About $15 an acre. If that did not make you smile, you are not a
value investor.

The stock peaked at around 60 in the last real estate boom. It now trades at
17.

And yes, Gabelli fans, there is a catalyst. The company has just hired JP
Morgan to evaluate alternatives. The largest shareholder wants to sell out, and
now the majority which has long controlled the company is no longer a majority.

I'm sure I am not the first to find this one. If anybody has anything further,
please post it or e-mail me privately. I'd be happy to share whatever else I
can dig up.

Arthur: No matter how hard you try, you can't marry value investing to modern
portfolio theory. Value investing relies on the fact that some market
efficiency does exist or their would be no predictability of a stock reaching
its intrinsic value. But, that the market is inefficient in sufficient
proportion to allow an astute investor to find undervalued stocks. The
academics of the MPT camp believe that the market is optimally efficient and
therefore no inefficiencies exist. Therefore, Peter Lynch, Michael Price, John
Neff and Warren Buffet were simply "lucky." I do believe that it is probably
more difficult to "win" now than thirty years ago, but do you really think that
successful stock pickers are just lucky? I use true diversification as espoused
by MPT for most of my clients for a portion of their portfolios. For some, ALL
of their portfolios. The predictability and reduced volatility is more
important to some than others. It probably should be of greater concern to
many. I also realize that few understand diversification. But, to attach MPT to
value investing is to infect it with mediocrity.

<Do you really believe investors are down on Microsoft? It is more popular with
Wall Street analysts than even Coca Cola, with the average rating between a buy
and a strong buy. You dropped in your opinion that the institutional investors
are missing this one, but the analysts (and I would say the price - you
wouldn't) indicate the opposite.>

Price and value are relative terms. The investors say MSFT is worth $100, I say
it is worth a lot more. It is irrelavant whether they are down or up on MSFT,
what matters is its economic value in realtion to its actual market price. If
you remember, forteh last four years MSFT was supposed to be overpriced, and
nearly 400% later.....
I am not the only one who sees this. Morgan Stanley picked this up. They did
such a fantastic job at selling that they convinced a programmer (Bill Gates)
to issue a structured security, the first time this has ever been done. MSFT
announced thier sturctured preferred offering wtih embedded puts which actually
guarantee the principal of the investor, while offering him participation in
the upside potential of the common and a current yield. Now, knowing that
management has the inside track and more information on the companies prospects
than most outsiders, why would mgmt. put themselves on the line with such a
generous offer when their stock is so allegedly overpriced. It happened around
December, was Bill Gates playing Santa Claus? The reason it was done was
because the MSFT common was so outrageously underpriced that the preferred
could have been used as a ultra low cost loan (a loan cheaper than MSFT's cost
of capital, cheaper than market debt,and cheaper than a bank loan) that would
have funded various projects such a a common buy back to fund the voracious
MSFT compensation system and increase the value of the comon shareholders at
the expense of the guys who do not know how to value the financial assets.

<No way would I short it, because I think the profitability is probably
sustainable for a while. But way undervalued? It just doesn't fit the profile.>

Did you see it when Buffet horded KO at prices that many deemed as extreme. It
becomes apparent when you use the discounted value approach. I use a very
pessimistic projection, and if I can discount the value from that pessimistic
projection to that above the current market place, then i know the market is
not efficient, or all knowing. If you ask the guys at MSFT vs, NSCP thread,
they will tell you how I consistently opined NSCP down with a series of very
inexpensive puts (average price $.80, or something like that), which I
announced on the thread before the fact. This was doen twice, from $80 to $40,a
nd from $60 to $30. This was not the result of techincal anslysis, but simply
the result of pure fundamental anlsysis - analyzing the true value of NSCP
under extreme conditions (stress testing, as some would say) and finding the
market to be way off cue.

Back up the relevance of the PSR with performance evidence in the technology

scale are very different to the ones that were prevalent when PSR was
originally concocted. There are times when you simply can't win a car race with
a horse and buggy :-) you should be counting the money made versus the price,
not sales. How do you compare two companies with disparate profit margins using
PSR. Compare Ford Motor Company with MSFT then compate them to Dell Computer.

Buy cheap sell dear, good old value investing method.

Buy high and sell even higher, new value investing method today. Basic reason
is liquidity changes over the years. The 401k money amount changes the value
investment environment. The amount is so large that only the most liquid stock
can be invested; so that people can buy and sell 15 million shares a day.

The cheap stocks never pick up the extra 401k money. For reasons of value and
risk, the market value of cheap stock is the fair value evaluation of the day.

Net-net. We've been throwing around this term without really explaining it. It
is classic Ben Graham concept at the core of value investing.

The more rigorous formula is:

Share price < Current Assets - All liabilities

A relaxed formula is

Share Price < Current Asset - Current Liabilities - Long Term Debt

The concept is this. Current assets are usually pretty certain, and the value
is pretty close to book value, even in a liquidation. By taking out all
liabilities, unadjusted, you build in conservatism. Essentially, the business
and all fixed assets are free.

Be very careful that there are no off-balance sheet contingent liabilities.

These are very hard to find today, but Mike Burry has found a few for us which
are very close.

TRC could work out in a number of ways. The company could get bought. Maybe it

What I do know is this. I bought (yes I already bought it) tangible assets for
a fraction of what they are worth. And there is a catalyst. Nice things tend to
happen in these kind of situations. And what's the downside? Even if nothing
happens, the assets are still there. I can't see this one going much below 13

Who told you that PSR analysis treats all companies on the same footing? May be
it is *you* who is confused! Ford would belong to what Fisher calls the
"smokestack" category. The highest PSR that he allows for such stocks is a
measly 0.8 As for tech stocks of Super companies (like MSFT?), they are
attractive buys at PSRs of 1.5, much higher than the PSR at which you would
SELL the "smokestack" stocks.

Then there is the issue of PRR (Price to Research Ratio) which could be used in
addition to PSR to evaluate tech stocks. This number should be between 5 and 15
(the lower the better) for a stock to be attractive.

If you want to consider the money made instead of the sales, it means you are
looking at profit margins. Now, if profit margins are high, which of these two
is more likely to happen in the LONG TERM -- the margins go higher, or they
revert to "normal" levels?

All this is irrelevant if you want to buy MSFT and sell it for a profit six
months from now. You might be able to pull it off. But I don't think we are
talking along those lines, are we? This thread is titled "Value Investing"...

<Reginald - You recommend looking at price to cash flow rather than price to

generates cash (or economic value" as you would say)?>

In a way, yes. Price to sales can easily be distorted when comparing companies
with different operating margins, you will not be comparingthe same thing.
Price tocash is better, especially if you are using a reconcilated cash flow
that adds back accrual accounting intangibles such as amortization and
goodwill. This will end up giving you NOPAAT (net operating profit after an
adjust for cash). The difference between this and economic profit (or value) is
that this is just the reward side of a risk reward calucaltion. To include the
risk, you will have to apply a capital charge aginst your reconciliated cash
flows that reflects the relative risk assumed in generating those cash flows
(owning the asset). This capital charge is the equivalent of the market
dictated weighted average cost of capital (risk as the free market prices it)
times the amount invested to receive the reconciliated cash flows (invested
capital). You can get this aomunt by culling the data form the income statment
and the cash flow statement.

Economic profit, True Value, EVA, and their derivatives are simply DCF
structured in such a fashion as to show the practitioner/investor the breakdown
of risk and reward on a proportional (percentage or spread) basis as well as an
aggregated dollar amount.

Including your "research ratio" how do you decide which company is the better
empirical (financial) risk if they are equivalently priced and have the same
research ratio and the same PSR in the same industry?

How do use PSR or research ration to account for excessive reserving of
revenue, which will severely distort a PSR calculation in the case of MSFT?
MSFT has reserved considerably over a billion dollars as an offset agianst
liabilities that have a very slim chance of manifesting themselves. They do
this in order to "bank" revenue, which serves as a resevoir of cash that
smoothes earnings volatility in future reporting periods.

How do you use PSR or research ratio to account for a comapny that is forced to
spend excessively in marketing in order to remain competitive (ex. AOL). This
will not show up in a PSR calculation. It will also not show up in a reseaerch
ratio calculation (if that somehow refers to R&D spending).

These are but a few of the pitfalls that can occur when you use a method of
valuation that fails to encompass most relevant parameters. Risk vs. discounted
cash flow adjusted for volatity (True Value) is the most comprehensive
measurement possible in this day in time. It may not be the easiest though.

just split your investment between the two. Better than tossing a coin, IMO.

If the company spends too much on marketing etc., its earnings will come down.
People then sell the stock. If the PSR reaches attractive levels, we pick it
up. As the company recovers and flourishes, it need not spend so much on
marketing anymore. The earnings increase. People start buying the stock again.
The PSR keeps rising. And when it reaches a sufficiently high value (between 3
and 6, depending on one's capacity to tolerate risk), the PSR investor pulls
the trigger. End of story!

I'm not sure if you are serious or not, so I will assume that you are and if i
am wrong, please forgive my lack of humor. Very, very few companies spend to
much on advertising. If you look at the most succesful desptop software and
hardware companies, you will conistently see a number that hovers around 40% in
the sales and marketing line. The problem is that companies don't spend enough
onsales adn marketing, or do so inefficiently (reference NOVELL). AS for
earnings, in many instances where you don't have a contigent quasi-liability
such as dividends, the less earnings the better. If a company is efficient, the
more money invested the better (invested as in R&D and marketing). If it is not
invested, it will be nearly halved by the tax man (do you attempt to show as
much income as possible on year yealry 1040 or do you squirrel as much or your
money away as possible in tax dedcutions and tax deferred investments - smart
companies do the same thing). There are two major needs for earnings in
technology companies, is actual and the other one is perceived. The first is
the need for retained cash as a buffer for unforeseen events, future cash flow
volatility, and acquisitions. The second is the rather ignorant (please forgive
my blatantness) perception of management that Wall Street wants to see
earnings. This is not true, Wall Street wants to see cash, money, moolah....

Many managers have a tendency to forego lucrative deals and operations because
of a diluition of earnings (such as acquisition of companies that result in
significant goodwill, or extensive investment in marketing or R&D, again see
the Novell Corp for and example). This in turn tends to reduce the value of
their company. Only small, retail investors or institutions that truly do not
knwo any better chase earnings. The very infuential players chase cash.

Getting back to MSFT, the bottom-line, at least to me, is that a lot of people
are chasing the stock (this might be a "less than empirical" method, but it is
also a matter of fact and I cannot but help notice it). Therefore, I refuse to
accept that $522 (or whatever) is the fair value of the stock. MSFT is not
exactly "a fruit that is hiding behind the leaves"!

I use PSR merely as a guide to confirm my suspicions. I don't expect it to be
infallible. After all, in investing, you don't have to be (and can't be) right
all the time. You only have to be right most of the time.

Things are great for MSFT as of now, and it is being bid up. (It is still a
long way from $522 of course!) The only unexpected thing that can happen in
this situation, is for the company to skid. If it continues to sail smoothly,
well, it was expected all along, wasn't it? That in itself, is a good enough
reason for me to avoid the stock. (Yes, I know this is definitely a "less than
empirical" reason, so let me say it myself and save you the trouble! :-) )

Good Luck. And when MSFT reaches $522 sometime during this bull-market, I
promise I will be among the first to congratulate you.

Dipy.

Hey C.A. Well I'll give you my .02 on HTCH:

Good little niche co. But it does get beat up every now and then as result of
being a key supplier to the disk drive industry. As I recall, (I owned it last
year) most business is with 3 key customers.
As you know, it's getting hit the past few days because of some delays in
introducing or ramping their new product line - and this, of course,is known by
everybody. The question is, is there a mispricing (misperception), and will the
stock come back to higher prices? I think it might, but I don't know that it
will, and the price has been a lot lower. (Last year was very tough for DD
makers, the cyclicality of the industry was reaffirmed - that's why I think the
P/E's could remain low.) I'd say there are better buys out there now right now.

Price today is about 25+
ROE of 24% (but it's been 1/2 that in previous years. Will their
customers let them maintain this high profitability?)
PSR is high at 1.2 (has fluctuated between .26 and 1.2 in past years)
Book is about 7.9.

Personally, I'd pay at most, $20 for this one.

Tim Russell: Why are you limited to 5 posts/day? Don't answer!-it's not worth
using 1 of the 5 -g-.
Okay, using the info. you provide, I now get 102.6 / 9 = 11.3 shares
outstanding for every pager. At a price of 6 11/32 per share (Yahoo, but
another quote service says 6.94?? how can that be? (don't answer! -g-)), I
figure it takes about $72 to control each pager. Oops, better add in the 1.46B
debt or $14.3/sh. Whaddya think? About $84 dollars for each pager? That might
be cheap enough for an investment in the stock. As for double to 6m pagers in 3
years, I can't evaluate that. Got to know who said it, their record (and don't
tell me! -- I am investing here on today's facts, not opinions) As for being
bought out because their stock is at current levels, that reads too much like
the hopes of too many frustrated investors seeing their stock on the new low

to use at least 1 of the 5 posts to tell me how wrong I was. ;-) Paul Senior

The URL for the new Web Site for The Napeague Letter is:

http://www.napeague.com/

Please "bookmark" it on your web browser.

A word of "warning" - This web site is not "pretty". It doesn't have fancy
graphics, pictures of my dogs or kids, or any cute stuff that flashes or
blinks. But, it downloads fast and doesn't use a lot of bandwidth. It is
stark, but it is functional....and you can reach it through the AOL web
browser!

If you are not yet familiar with it, The Napeague Letter identifies
undervalued small-cap companies which are investment opportunities. Its
Analyses are based on in-depth research and apply a variety of
fundamental analysis tools to identify growing small-cap companies whose
stocks are undervalued. It then uses technical analyses to identify possible
Buy and Sell points.

I'm Bob Davis, the editor of The Napeague Letter. I am a relatively
sophisticated individual investor, with 15 years of experience as Chief
Financial Officer of two different NASDAQ companies and an MBA from
Harvard Business. I am not employed by or compensated by the
companies that are analyzed in The Napeague Letter. However, I am
frequently a stockholder in the company, as the result of purchasing shares
on the open market.

The Wall Street Journal recently profiled The Napeague Letter in an
article about e-mail investment newsletters. Describing the Newsletter's
editor (yes...me), they said, "He uses a variety of valuation methods and
sends a description of them to anyone interested. His letters, running six to
ten pages in length, examine one company he is thinking of investing in
personally. He looks at the industry, the market segments, management,
clients, what kind of business it is, and includes a balance sheet
evaluation. "I do it to make up my own mind," he says."

The Wall Street Journal also interviewed investors who read The
Napeague Letter. They quoted one as saying "The ones that I've read
from Bob, I think are quality work. He does his homework".

Up until now I have been using E-mail to distribute TNL to a list of
subscribers. For the present, I plan to continue doing this, as well as
posting it to the web site. However, in the not-so-distant future, I would
like to use E-mail only for information that is "time sensitive" in some
way, and post the in-depth Analyses to the web site, where its HyperText
features can be more useful to you.

These Analyses rely on many different sources of data, most of which are
on the Internet already. By placing these Analyses on a web site and
including HyperText links to the original sources of data, you will be able
to carry out your own due diligence more effectively. After all, it is my
feeling that if an investor is considering committing funds to an
investment, they should know as much as possible about the investment
itself beforehand.

Of course, if you would like to be added to the TNL E-mail list, please
E-mail me a request at rmdavis1@ix.netcom.com. This is a free

Karl: re your HCIA, MRRW, ANET, FSII, CMOS. I looked quick.

Probably too quickly. (Volume of suggestions on this thread recently has
increased. So far not enough net-nets. I seem to be in a position now of
looking for reasons to exclude stocks, rather than include them. May be a good
sign, but I don't like it. Similar to being in HR, where volume of resumes
meant looking for reasons to exclude people... I didn't like that either.)

HCIA: AMBAC subsidiary. That would be a +, because they have a "sponsor".
Growing. At book all right, but no ROE.

MRRW: around book, 8%ROE, growing.

ANET: neglible ROE

CMOS: at 15.5 with book at 9.58 and ROE at 13% -- fairly valued.

FSII: 11.125, rising earnings (neg to pos from '91-96) book 9.58
PSR about .9, ROE 13, sell consumables? to electronics industry

I chose this last one for a closer look. If you or anyone else have any other
info/opinions re. these co's that you can share, now would be a good time.

(Don't mean to be fixated on ROE, but unless I can get more facts more easily
and quickly, I'll either move on (and risk missing an opportunty) or wait for
"the homerun pitch" -where the facts are apparent or opinions discussed
convince me.)

<<Getting back to MSFT, the bottom-line, at least to me, is that a lot of
people are chasing the stock (this might be a "less than empirical" method, but
it is also a matter of fact and I cannot but help notice it).Therefore, I
refuse to accept that $522 (or whatever) is the fair value of the stock. MSFT
is not exactly "a fruit that is hiding behind the leaves"! >>

(Sorry about following up on my own post, but had to add this...)

A friend of mine, a savvy investor, once said something I cannot forget -- "The
market is right!". And then he explained, "It doesn't mean that you have to
*agree* with the market. But you have to *accept* what it says. Sometimes you
might think you are right and the market is wrong. But if you are *indeed*
right, you will find that eventually the market will agree with you."

So, all those formulas and analysis that value MSFT at $522 are (gasp!) wrong
if the market doesn't agree! Now, I don't expect this to happen tomorrow, but
IF the analysis is right, MSFT should and will hit $522 during this business
cycle! Otherwise, the formulas and analysis rightfully belong to the dustbin.

As simple as that.

Hi Christian,

From a certain standpoint Hutchinson appears
appealing. It seems unfairly punished
amid a misunderstanding of its news that
it is behind in its capacity expansion plans.
Profits look good and it has 12 major
contracts in hand. Given the down tech
market and this temporary stress, there
might be a certain margin of safety in
the shares. For many investors, this
is a buying opportunity. And in my gut
I feel it will rise again.

On a valuation basis, however, I tend to
agree with Paul. Its ratios mostly approximate
the industry averages, with no special
value-based floor. While the PSR is getting low
for the industry (especially in light of the
good news on its margins),the future success of the
stock seems very dependent on it proving
future profit growth. While this seems
very likely, a srict interpretation may
call it speculation, IMO.

Good investing,

Mike: And here's one that works for me. Start your engines!

Exide, EX.

They've come from nowhere to become a major player in car batteries. Numbers
look like this:
Current Price: 15.75
PSR: .14
BV: 21.2
D/E: 3:1 (Wow!)

Their idea is to centralize the manufacturing of batteries (fewer but bigger
plants), cut deals with large retailers (they make, for example, Sears Diehards
(trademark registered Thank you, Reginald -g-), and manage many retailers'
battery operations. (Deliver, stock, set-up displays, maintain stock, collect
old batteries, remove, recycle). It's two-sided: they get economies of scale,
but they have large support expenses. Now they are trying the same thing in
Europe. They seem to think they can consolidate many small and unprofitable
firms into profitable operations. But as you can pretty well guess, it's not
been so easy. Very costly, - just look at that debt exposure - and not
profitable either. (A lot of this has to do with lead prices - they've gone up
a lot in `96, and EX is not hedged in its Europe operations. ) Furthermore,
there is a big (big!) credibility problem with management in their
communication to/with analysts (maybe stockholders too). Also, the Sears
contract expires this year, and the competitor that had it before, had it for
decades, so there is some bruhaha going to develop I'd guess. The top man at
EX, is from what I can tell, gung ho on a mission. They may be battery crazy
(-g-). They are big in marine batteries and are apparently looking into doing
deals for lithium batteries. I am investing in this company at this price for 3
reasons:

1. Somebody is going to be selling you a battery (Okay, maybe value investors
are too cheap to even buy cars, -g- but a lot of batteries are going to get
sold. (EX sales have been growing rapidly past few years.)

2. The PSR is just too low.

3. The stock is below book value.

Exide has a long history in the annals of rough instititional finance. I
suggest you read Dangerous Dreamers, by Robert Sobol, and the Money of the
Mind, they are quite interesting and detail (on a fairly objective basis) the
Milken story among others.

An interesting stock that will measure well in your PSR and Buffet Value
screens is NOVL. It is currently the industry leader with considerably over 50%
market share in networking, considerble licensed conusltant, contractor and
third party developer population, and a share price that consists of nearly 30%
cash.

The problem is that the primary asset of a software comapny is intellectual
capital, primarily, management. NOVL's management is much more technically
orientated than the carnivorous culture of companies such as MSFT, ORCL, INTC,
NSCP. Therefore, the street has priced in the domination of MSFT & crew. That,
in combination with the destrcution of economic value for several consecutive
years, has led to an extreme reduction of market value (destruction of
shareholder value). So, even though a Buffet style scan may find this an
interesting prospect, an analysis of the competitive environment and mgmt.
acumen finds them sitting ducks. The good news, IMO, is that they are PERFECT
buyout candidates. Plenty of cash and international subsidiaries, branded
assets, market share and declining sales/weak stock price. There is a
merger/acquisition scenario in PDF format on my site, as well as a live model
for those of you who want to price the acquisition yourselves at
http://www.rcmfinancial.com/test1/suggest.htm (this stuff is impossible to find
on the net).

For those of you who talk about my fancy formulas for valuation, I suggest you
browse through a couple of articles I wrote, about a half year ago, on the
carnivorous corporate culture and how that figures into shareholder value at

when somebody says definitely cheap. Most everythng I ever bought was/is

talking stocks, real estate, antiques, collectibles, cars -- turn out to get
cheaper and stay cheaper. Thinking about it, the only category that I am sure
got more expensive was "women" -g-.
Anyway, that is what makes a market, every buyer thinks it's cheap, every

I own SVGI. I know, I swore off tech stocks, but that was after I bought this
one.

The company seems to be at the high end of technology in the industry
(steppers, etchers, lithography...whatever they call it - the equipment to make
microprocessers). They are capable of .18 micron, and the competition is well
behind that. If somebody can correct me on that, please do, this in not my
industry, and I may be a year out of date.

Intel is a huge customer. There was a rumor a couple weeks ago that Intel is
ordering elsewhere. Apparently not confirmed on the conference call, but it
hammered the stock. Once again, if anybody knows what they're talking about,
tell me - I don't

The company has a big cash balance, and trades at a very low P/E when you back
out the cash. It is also very close to book value.

Management is the problem. These guys achieved notoriety a few months ago by
reducing the strike price of already issued options just because the price of
the stock was down. They did this when the stock was near its bottom. Then they
had the gall to say that it was to protect employees, when actually top
management owned the vast majority of the options. A pure gift from the board
to a management team which has hardly proved itself worthy of its base salary.

What you'll find with this one is that the industry (AMAT, KLAC, KLIC...) moves
together. SVGI will move with them, but will gets half the upside move and all
the downside move on the big swings characteristic of this industry's stock
prices lately.

But I own it because it is dirt cheap. And I am not selling at $20.

Karl C. "Cheap anyway you do the valuation." Oh boy I can take that one on. All
I gotta do is find just one way to value HCIA where the value is not cheap.

Well I will assume Mr. Market will continue to elevate the price of HCIA.
Everybody buying in now will make tons of money. (And with the recent rise from
14 to 19, I guess people really are excited to get a piece of the action -g-.)
I won't have owned it and will probably regret it for years afterword. But for
now...

If I look just a little closer at the screening numbers, I find:

Revenues have grown from 30.7M to 85M from 1994 to latest 12 mo
(Good revenue growth)

Net Income has gone from +1M to -41M from 1994 to last year
(not the right direction, I'd say --losing money every year since 1994)

EBIT has gone from 1.8M (in 1994) to -37M in 1996.

This is a for-profit company? (rhetorical question)

PSR 8.7 (1995) to 2.5 (1996)

not too impressed. But where's 1994 PSR? Doesn't look like stock traded. In
fact I will even suggest a profit was created in 1994 to enable 'em to float
stock in '95. (But that has not much to do with value)

If there ain't no earnings or EBIT, then how can book value per share grow from
6 to 11 to 17? I don't know, but I do notice that shares out. also grew from
5.4M to 8.9 to 11.8M. Could it be that HCIA is really in the business of
issuing shares -g-?

Robertson Stevens says it's undervalued any way you look at it. Bushwa I say!
Of course 128 institutions hold 72% of the stock, so they must think it's
undervalued on some important measures. And maybe it is. It's just that, IMO,
earnings isn't one of them. ;-) Paul
