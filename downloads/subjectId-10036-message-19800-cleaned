Timely article about "moat" or lack of thereof...

When Moats Collapse

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz (TMF Edible)
October 8, 2004

This past weekend I took the family out to see Shark Tale. As an investor
intrigued by the prospects of DreamWorks Animation going public -- and with a
6-year-old son who has memorized just about every line from every Pixar
(Nasdaq: PIXR) movie to the point where his meager college fund is resting half
in cash and half in Pixar -- it was what I like to call due diligence with a
side of popcorn.

Good point on MRK. Based on a possible $10B litigation liability exposure for
Vioxx and their current & future pipeline, what is your price estimate that
reflects fair value? I think we may have a chance to pick up shares next year
somewhere in the low $20's.

From Briefing.com:"...7:29AM National class action launched against Merck in
Canada (MRK) 30.98: Lawyers representing Canadians who used Merck's popular
arthritis and pain-killer drug VIOXX announce that a national class action has
been launched for those VIOXX users who suffered from cardiovascular
complications including heart attack and stroke. In 2003 IMS Health reported
that there were over 3.4 mln prescriptions for VIOXX in Canada last year,
making it the 10th most prescribed drug in Canada; more 700,000 Canadians are
estimated to have taken VIOXX to alleviate arthritis, acute pain and severe
menstrual pain...."

I started to accumulate BMY as it has been trading near it's five year lows. I
know their pipeline is sour for the next two years but if they can continue to
make their dividend, the risk is low.

Any comment on BMY?

I also own a few shares of JnJ that I bought 9/03 but it is still richly priced
IMO. I have been selling covered calls to generate a better total return and
will probably let them call the stock at $55 next week.

The pharmaceutical industry is a good long term investment IMO so I want to
maintain exposure to this industry. However, there may also be some political
risk as there must be changes made to help finance our health system.

Any other stocks come to mind other than WYE?

re MRK, PFE, BMY and AMGN -
I think your estimate of the low twenties for MRK is not too far off. i also
think htey will eventually cut their dividend.

BMY - i commented on this on a few times on this thread. While I like their
progress in their early R&D pipeline, they will have to paddle pretty ahrd for
20-3 years just to stay where they are revnue wise, due to patent expirations.
together with rising R&D costs this will mean flat to falling earnings.

In the pharma sector I do like and own PFE and AMGN. AMGN is expensive per P/S
but they have a pretty clear sailing ahead of them. I think the stock is
undervalued, as is PFE (and maybe WYE depending on litigation).

Thanks, Suma. Appreciate those kind words.

Sometimes I look at it this way: a decent objective is to try to accumulate as
much productive assets as possible at the lowest cost as possible.

I post most of my buys. Maybe somebody might be interested in the stock or the
company or its industry, or would have an opinion supporting or disagreeing
w/me. That's all to the good.

I generally don't post sales, and if I do I don't often relate them to buys. I
don't see where that's helpful to readers. I'd rather not have people here
judge if I'm a good stock picker or a bad stock picker. Rather, I'd prefer that
each stock I mention stand on its own and not have anybody weigh whether my
past record or posts should influence their decisions or opinions about the
stock.

For some detail though, here's what I've done today, fwiw.

Bought more PBRA (@ 34.50)

Sold small first lot of NDN to claim tax loss (in $20.17; out 13.99). May buy
back in 31 days.

Sold taxable purchase only of MHR (in 9.98; sell 13.20). Still holding shares.
Company putting itself up for sale apparently. I want to see what the other
investors here on SI might be doing with their shares.

Closed ALCO position (in 28.75, out 50.65) Oops, I may have been too quick to
sell. I figured controlling insider would not agree to potential buyout offer,
but co. now has announced a special committee of BOD has been convened to
consider the offer.

Sold 20% of SIRI (in 1.35; sell 3.68). My first sell. Yesterday was the day to
sell though with SIRI >4.

Sold latest, recent buy of CPRT (in 17.80;out 19.08)) Still holding shares
purchased 2/28/03 @ 7.49.

Bought AOBO (@ 1.40). Refer to Dale Baker thread.

Trimmed AACE position (in 12/4/2 @7.95; sell 26.63) Losing patience & some
confidence.

Trimmed CEE position (in 20.11; sell 25.45). Losing some confidence.

Bought more TIF (in 29.72)

I mentioned almost all of these stocks here when I bought them (exceptions
being today's AOBO and maybe NDN which might've first been discussed on Buffett
thread).

-------
Uh... as I look at what I've bought & sold today, no one should consider that
this is a typical day for me as regards gains vs. losses. I don't know anyone
else's portfolio, but I am willing to bet that I have among the very largest
number of different positions of anyone reading this. That's the NUMBER of
different stocks held --- NOT dollar value. So, since I try to hold stocks for
a while ... this leads me to confidently say... I very likely also have more
losing positions and more losers than anybody else on SI.

Your post makes a lot of sense in a world where information flows immediately

those hoped for profits and moats can disappear through either product recalls,
competition or deceitful/incompetent management ( questionable convertible

holdings, no reason they cannot release more oil on loan like they already have
to two oil companies.. In the industry they call it an exchange .. usually one
company will let another have oil and they pay back at later date , to same

plus some accounting costs and very small profit margin. So i sold perhaps way

Wait, you criticized Madharry for owning OPTV because they have no earnings but
yet you bought SIRI at $1.35? Won't it be years before SIRI has earnings, if at
all? OPTV's last report showed a growth of 21% and it's hard to find that kind
of growth anywhere anymore. Continued growth like that will make them cash flow
positive sometime next year. And they do have quite a bit of cash left and
expenses have been cut. I'm a long time holder and plan to continue holding
until they turn a profit. The stock should be considerably higher if they do.

You are correct on all counts, mike.com! Except I have no intentention of
criticizing anyone. Tweak Madharry, maybe -g-, but criticize, no. His
investment record could be quite superior to mine. He reports he's currently
pleased with his portfolio. I'm not so sure about the results of my main
portfolio.

SIRI's got to be a speculation. With so many outstanding shares, hard for me to
ever see it having a decent p/e (value or growth) - even if it ever does turn
profitable, which as you as you say, is iffy.

So of course my position SIRI position is very small and held among a large
number of diverse stocks.

You and Madharry like OPTV, so it is worth a closer look by others here. I
looked quickly, and from what I see, it's not for me. I've passed on many
suggestions made here - to my later regret -- so it's quite possible OPTV could
be another stock that climbs without me on board.

As far as structuring a portfolio, what I've tried to say is that it's my
opinion that it's very dangerous to build and hold major positions in companies
that for whatever reasons - cash, prospects, moat - at the end of the day show
no earnings. No earnings this year, last year, the year before-- and maybe - or
likely - even in the upcoming year. I'm not against owning such stocks - I have
many like this - they just aren't significant weightings in my portfolios.
Perhaps other people with different goals, objectives, skills, expertise, risk
profiles see it differently. That's fine. I just express my opinion.

For me, I want to hold productive (profitable) assets predominantly, hold fewer
if they are not productive but they have been in the past (rear-view investing)
and even less so if the assets have never been profitable.

Paul, looking at OPTV quickly, as you say you did, I can understand why it's
not for you. However, there are several reasons why an investor should look
more closely at it. First of all, they are heavily involved in interactive TV
which is gaining traction with the onset of the digital TV revolution. The
government is MANDATING the transition to digital so this is not something that
is going to go away. Second, OPTV is backed by Liberty Media Corp. and John
Malone. Malone made a major investment in OPTV in the $6 range and I have yet
to see him sell a single share. He has made some executive decisions in the
company, the latest being the appointment of James Chiddix as CEO. Chiddix has
a background in the cable industry so it is hoped that he will soon get OPTV
some lucrative contracts with Comcast or Time Warner. Thirdly, OPTV's software
is embedded in most of the digtial TV boxes made by Scientific Atlanta and
Motorola. They recently signed long term deals with both companies for the
relationship to continue. Most investors of OPTV feel that the pay off will be
when the targeted advertising it provides becomes the norm. Another thing to
consider when looking at OPTV is the patents and their projected future value.
I doubt a "quick look" even considered these. When you have more time look into
some of the patents that OPTV holds and imagine their value when every home has
a digital television. I remain very hopeful of the future for OPTV.

guess likelihood of another good upcoming quarterly report - makes the stock a
speculative buy, but perhaps a buy nonetheless. Does seem to me like we could
see a continuation of the stock's spectacular rise. OTOH, for a cyclical
business and in a sector that has had - in past anyway - chronic overcapacity,
I'd say most people would say earnings aren't sustainable and so the stock
deserves a low p/e.

Hi Paul - What's your strategy on tax loss selling?

The value investor tends to be a long term holder and really should not be
concerned with managing taxes. However, I have found that using the 31 day rule
and selling a stock that I have acquired in the previous year (to establish a
short term loss), there are times where it makes sence to do the sale.

I try to complete these tax loss sales no latter than October 25 because I can
usually establish the same position in 31 days and still participate in an end
of the year rally.

Tax loss sales that deal with long term losses are less attractive to me, since
they can only off set long term capital gains. These tax rates are already
quite low so generally if I am going to sell such a position, I do not get back
in.

I sold a few shares of MRK today that I acquired in 11-03(at around $41) with
the idea of buying them back in 31 days to lower my cost basis. I think the
real money will be made on this stock when it trades next year in the low
$20's. It's no guarantee that it will trade there so using this "tax loss"
approach should allow me to capitalize on the recent negative trend regarding
their Vioxx product. The risk is that the stock must trade near it's current
lows for the next 31 days.

My tax lossing strategy about the same.

Continuing now to be takimg the more valuable short term losses. For several
loser positions held less than a year, rather than selling with intent to buy
back 31 days later, I'm adding to the position now and intending to sell the
earlier purchases (losing lot(s)) in 31 days.

Like you, I'm working loss sales now so that I can still be in some of the
positions in December to see if they might participate in a year-end rally.

Fwiw, invariably I have much more dollars in long-term cap gains (1yr & 5yr) to
be taxed than I have net short-term gains (i.e. short-term gains minus
short-term losses). Only some of that is because I am looking to reduce taxes
by taking losses early (less than 1 year holding). More likely, it seems I'm
trading stocks and not doing well at it -- my short-term losses are larger than
the short-term gains in many years.

<<OTOH, for a cyclical business and in a sector that has had - in past anyway -
chronic overcapacity, I'd say most people would say earnings aren't sustainable
and so the stock deserves a low p/e>>

the times, they are a-changin'....

Less profitable product lines have been discontinued (e.g., nails), higher
margin opportunities have been pursued (e.g., engineered structural mesh),
productivity has increased, and LT debt is being reduced with a vengeance (and
may be eliminated entirely by YE 2005).

Furthermore, financing costs associated with operations have been substantially
reduced as a result of the new credit facility (the benefit of which will only
really be appreciated in this qtr's numbers).

The supply constraints identified by mgmt in the last CC have been relieved to
a great degree by the reopening of the Georgetown/ISG facility.

Additionally, the demand side should increase significantly looking ahead to
2005 as the commercial construction sector begins to pull itself up off of the
floor, and Congress appropriates the hundreds of billions of dollars necessary
to upgrade our nation's crumbling infrastructure (TEA-21).

In the dramatic industry downturn from 2000 to 2003, many competitive suppliers
were wiped out or shut down. To my knowledge, only 3 significant competitors
are still operating: IIIN, American Spring Wire and Sumiden Wire. Moreover,
much of the foreign competition has effectively been denied access to the U.S.
market by onerous anti-dumping duties imposed earlier this year

http://concreteproducts.com/mag/concrete_dumping_ruling_spells/

w/r/t pc strand in particular, IIIN is the largest player in the market (and
the number of competitors has grown quite small in recent years due to the
abysmal economy of 2000-2003), and is 3x larger than the next largest supplier

now that the market is heading back up, even modest increases in demand should
translate into very healthy profits for the three remaining players

also, if you look at CAT's forward guidance (as recently reported) -- as well
as other construction industry sources -- you will see that demand for IIIN's
products should pick up appreciably going forward

BTW, make sure that you study the recent insider transactions .... there is

Eric, don't forget that a long term loss can offset a short term gain.
Occasionally you will have the opportunity to clean out some old "clunkers" in
a year where you have mostly trading gains. That, in effect, improves the
"value" of the long term loss.

You have to remember that this is not a "neglected" stock and be sure you can

Hi Paul - Today an analyst at Smith Barney cut SFL to a sell from a buy based
on valuation. His argument for his Sell call is that the annual profit sharing
for SFL will be less than expected. Therefore, his call is based on the market
expectations of the profit sharing.

My Buy on this company was based on the agreements that SFL has with FRO (and
possible other similar companies in the future) and the cash flow that these
long term lease agreements generate. The general business model is an
interesting new approach to this industry as SFL provides the day to day
operation and management of FRO's tankers. I believe SFL will obtain other
similar long term operating agreements with other major tanker companies.

I never valued this company on the "profit sharing" clause SFL has with FRO but
rather it was gravy if shipping rates came in high for the year or in SFL met
other operating efficiencies.

Our analyst at Smith Barney reduced his estimate for SFL's profit sharing from
$600 million to $210 million. He also thinks the overall long term leasing
trends have peaked.

I believe the smart investor has been valuing the company based on the fixed
lease agreements with FRO not the extra profit sharing kicker. Fair value IMO
at a 10 PE based on FRO long term lease agreements is $35. Any extra profit
sharing is a bonus and should really has not created the over valuation that
this analyst believes.

I bought more SFL at $21 as I believe the 6% dividend is strong for several
years and eventually the market will discount this rate of return to the market
price (perhaps to a 4% return). This implies that the stock should sell for $35
BEFORE any extra profit sharing!

FWIW, 2010 all of the single hull ships must be double hull and the company has
a transition plan to achieve this for their fleet. The company recently
adjusted their accrual accounting to reflect this with an aggressive write down
to reflect the scrap value of assets of any single hull ships that may be taken
out of the fleet because of this 2010 requirement.

I have a hard time trying to see the concern this analyst has for this company
especially if he believes the recent stock advance is due to SFL's "profit
sharing" high expectations. My only comment is he should look at the fixed
contracts now in place and the cash flow that these agreements generate.
Perhaps you provide a small premium for the company entering into similar
contracts with other tanker companies that would allow them to expand their
model to other companies in this sector.

I continue to like this company and will add more shares over time. It is now
one of my top ten holdings in my taxable account and a top ten holding in my
IRA account.

What's your take? Did you even consider the SFL profit sharing "expectation"
when you purchased shares?

SFL: No, did not consider the profit sharing aspect when I purchased. I added
because of the dividend and because I've been in FRO a few years and I'm
somewhat comfortable with the management. I figured there might be a play with
SFL as an undervalued situation if perhaps many FRO holders might sell the few
SFL shares they received as a spin-off from FRO. I see FRO and SFL as linked -
that might be quite wrong - and I wanted to increase my exposure to tankers. I
chose to add to SFL. (FRO seems to me to have performed better though - until
today that is, when both were hammered.)

I see no reason to sell either stock - certainly not because of a Smith Barney
call. At this point I'm considering adding a bit to SFL again and may do it
yet.

From:Stewart Whitman
If I recall correctly, the profit sharing part of SFL is that, above a certain
base rate, SFL gets 20% of the rate and FRO gets the rest. The base rate, that
goes to SFL (less some expenses), is actually quite high - around average day
rates for prior periods.

The publicly reported info on the SB analysis indicated that part of the
downgrade of SFL was because it was trading up some percentage (e.g. 50% since
June, 30% in the last month). This was based on the initial trading price of
SFL post-spin-off. But, it's pretty clear that SFL shouldn't have been trading
around $12 - that's a ridiculously high dividend (about 12%). I think that's
higher than the bank rates they pay on their debt.

Another thing, if, as you mentioned, the SB analyst really expected that SFL
would get $600 million in profit sharing, that's about $8 per SFL share. If he
really thought that, I wonder what his valuation of SFL would be! That's their
mistake - I don't think anyone expected that.

I think that people have failed (or perhaps will fail) to correctly value FRO.
It doesn't matter too much now, as SFL is still mostly consolidated as part of
FRO and day rates are very high. But if FRO spun of all of SFL (which I doubt
will happen) and day rates drop significantly, FRO probably would make very
little money - less that in previous down cycles. I.e., during a down cycle,
separately, FRO might even be valued for less than SFL.

Also, if you believe FRO & SFL reflect day rates, and that day rates have
peaked and are going lower, then today's stock pricing action for SFL (-9.2%)
and FRO (-7.3%) is pretty irrational. After all, proportionally, FRO benefits
more than SFL from higher rates, so it should drop more than SFL.

Personally, I was happy buying SFL in the low teens. I'd be happy selling in
the mid to high twenties. I'd feel better about SFL if SFL had a business plan
that was more independant of FRO.

Stew

I know you didn't ask me on this, but here is a post I made to someone on a

Hello, Investor2. Ordinarily, I'd expect powerhouse MRK to come back - they
have new drugs in their pipeline, I presume, and I'd expect among these new
drugs a blockbuster or two to stimulate sales and investor interest in the
stock, as has happened in past.

But with the withdrawing Vioxx, nobody's got any confidence that the low's been
seen in the stock price until there's an assessment of the number of lawsuits
and the damage to claimants can be guessed.

It's hard for me to understand comparable situations because all the major
pharma's have been beaten down for so long. The three other companies that have
had legal or off-patent woes that I follow that've really seemed to have been
signifcant are SGP, WYE, and BMY. These companies have all survived, but their
stocks have never recovered. To me, the stocks have been mired in a tight
trading range. Years have past - it feels like - and there's no great
resolution to their problems. So I assume similar for MRK: there'll be a
trading range established - maybe 20-30, maybe 25-35 - I don't know, and MRK
will be mired in it for years.

This is not a situation in which I want to be in now. I've closed out my WYE
position recently, I cut back my BMY last year, and I've taken a few lumps in
MRK now by selling about 1/4 of my small position.

For you who is a bottom feeder and with the patience to hold for possibly a
decade or more - you might want to stab a little MRK now. Somebody is betting
on the company - there are buys everyday after all. OTOH, I don't know how many
more decades you've got left for holding on to a position, and there seem other
downtrodden A list stocks that offer better prospects of recovery and sooner
too. I offer CL as an example. (JMO and I could be wrong.)

Let us know what you finally decide to do!

I would think that the companies with problems behind them (SGP, WYE, and BMY)
are much more likely to leave the trading range on the upside than a company
(MRK) that still has most of the problem in front of them.

The reality is not as black and white though. SGP and BMY may still have issues
going forward: mostly pipeline issues, not legal ones. (I don't follow WYE,
though maybe I should).

Buffett said at some point that he missed huge profits in pharmas since he did
not understand them (or something similar). Now maybe is the time to see what
Buffett may have alluded to: pharmas depend on government regulation (think
price controls), pharmas are high-tech companies (think that new drug invention
is not guaranteed), pharmas have significant potential liabilities (Vioxx).
These three factors should contribute to being quite conservative while
investing in pharmas. (Or not invest at all).

Hi Paul

I am eyeing more bank stocks too. I added a few more shares of C to my IRA
portfolio at $43.49 (sold AWE). They go x-dividend on the 10-29-04 so you get
the next dividend of $0.40 too.

I am also buying more shares of NYB by selling the January $20 Put. They pay
$1.15 to buy shares at $20 in January. My expectations is to have the stock put
to me at $20. The stock goes x-dividend in February ($0.25) so you will get the
dividend which yields 4.8%. If the stock does not close below $20 in January,
then you keep the option premium.

I missed picking up more SFL at $19.21 yesterday but plan to buy more if we get
another chance at these levels. I have accumulated shares at $18, $20 and $21.

It appears that the market may be reacting to an apparent Kerry victory and the
rising oil prices do not help either.

Hi Wallace - I expect AIG will have problems with Spitzer too as this company
practiced unethical dealings with many of their customers. One of their
subsidiaries sold my 89 year old aunt an auunity (w/ very high surrender fees)
a policy that was in appropriate and bordered on "elder abusive". Their sales
people were farming elder accounts and some how got my aunt involved.

I suspect that Spitzer will take care of these companies. I doubt that any of
their customers (let alone shareholders) will see any of the settlement(s).
It's sad that companies act in this manner but with their greed and huge
potential profits, they do.

The lesson learned is "trust your management", a difficult thing to judge for

apparently there was a lot of selling of financial ETF's today due to spitzer's
announcement of the case against MMC, which in turn caused a lot of selling in
the stocks which make up those baskets, and this included not only insurance
stocks but banks and brokers, thus the widespread losses in financial stocks

not sure how this will impact stocks like NYB, C, BAC, etc. in the next few
days, but obviously the concerns that apply to MMC and AIG, etc., do not apply
to these banks (unless spitzer decides to go after them for something next -G-)

i am currently short oct 20 puts on NYB, so hoping it holds above 20 tomorrow
so they expire worthless, and then i will probably join you in december or
january 20 puts, though the chart is not yet oversold, so i might hold off a
few days to establish a full position...if it's under 20 late in the day
tomorrow i have to decide whether to take the shares and get the next dividend,
or roll the puts forward

i am also short puts farther out on C and BAC...not as interested in adding to
my small position in C as there may be additional scrutiny of their practices
in light of the troubles in japan and europe recently, but i'd love to add some
puts on BAC if the stock pulls back to support at 43, or gets to oversold

also short oct 85's on BSC, obviously they will expire worthless absent some
kind of calamity tomorrow, but i think this is another good one to capture
premium on, as the tangible book value is about 80 bucks a share and the P/E is
around 10...eventually i think BSC will get bought out for a higher price, but
in the meantime it seems like a fairly low risk play for capturing put premium
on a regular basis

Suppose that you needed to buy a car for one specific purpose--commuting to
work so you could earn a living. Now, suppose I offered to sell you a stylish
30-year-old used sportscar for $15,000, or a dull, barely used Toyota for
$12,000. You'd probably take the Toyota, right? It costs less, it's more
reliable, and all you need to do is get to work each day. Drag-racing your
neighbors isn't in the game plan.

Oddly, most investors are making the opposite choice right now by paying more
for lower-quality companies than they are for higher-quality companies. The
same thing is happening with regard to risk: Lower-risk companies are, in

Sold my DFNS.OB into todays crazy rally. Here is some info about USLM, in case
somebody is interested. USLM is a lime producer. it own a few lime quarries in
AR, CO and TX. Lime is used for constuction, paper production and steel, all of
which seem to be booming now. As Peter Lynch pointed out, quarries are one of
those business having somewhat of a moat, because of difficulties to obtain
persmission for quarries and transportation costs. Most construction material
companies trade at pretty nice PE's. USLM is a dinky little company of course.
Lot's of debt 9some as high as 14% interest) but after concluding an investment
progeam to get quarries up to snuff, the companies generates pretty improseeive
FCF and pays back debt. The recent refinancing will reduce interst rates
payments substantially, to about 2.5M$/year. This will improve the bottom line
quite a bit. Also EOG has obtained drilling permist on USLM properties and pays
over 1M$ upfront and 1/5 of the revenues as royalties (if there are some). What
I am hopping is that this companies get's further on solid ground financially
and that the FCF finally leads to a revaluation of the stock.

Hi Spekulatius - USLM is an interesting proposition. It is trading quite above
it's five year low of $4 so I may be late to the party. I like their business
including the turn around story and the barriers to entry to their business
(i.e. permit requirements you described in your previous post).

Are their any hidden assets in their land or mineral holdings? Specifically I
see that there may be potential royalty earnings from their Barnett Shale site.
Is this substantial and has it been imputed in the price or their book value?

If we do get a slow but growing economy and interest rates remain low, demand
for their product(s) should grow over time. Their recent restructuring of their
debit should help improve their cash flow which will eventually improve their
earnings. The PE is at 9 which qualifies it in the value sector but I am a bit
skeptical as to how far this and the housing/remodel boom will last.

I will watch this stock as I need exposure in my portfolio to this sector. I
was considering CEMEX the Mexican cement producer but their stock price is too
high and not at value at current levels. Perhaps USLM is a candidate. I was
hoping for a dividend paying stock but noticed that the last one noted on Yahoo
for USLM was in 05/03.

yes USLM has been on a tear recently but I still think it has further to go.
The dividend was suspended because in the bleak years of 2002/2003 USLM had to
incur debt to upgrade their facilities (as they stated their facilities were
outdated and they lost customer because of that). Because of their alread weak
balance sheet and operating results they had to tak on 14M$ of debt at 14%
interest rates (the sub notes). Their 1st priority needs to be to pay off this
loan which is what they are doing right now:

 The Company made a $3,000,000 principal prepayment on the Sub Notes on May 7,
2004. Pursuant to the terms of the Sub Notes, a $30,000 prepayment penalty was
also paid on $1,500,000 of the principal prepayment. On July 29, 2004, the
Company made another $3,000,000 principal prepayment on the Sub Notes. No
prepayment penalty was required for the July payment. .

The remaining (recently financed) revolving debt to Wells Fargo has an
effective interest rate of less than 6%. Once the subordinated debt is gone,
the load convenants should be gone and the company should be able to pay
dividends again. According to my notes the future projected capital outlays are
less than depreciation (due to the just completed moderization program) for a
couple of years which should mean a generous FCF going forward.

Again, it's a dinky little company but it'sperating in a nice little niche,
profiting from the commodity boom and it does not yet gained any recognition.

from a strategic kind of view (moats, FCF growth , Fair value) I found that
their research is somewhat stale and did not take recent developments into

AIG trades at a substantial premium to peer companies because of its impeccable

ACE is also affected by the Spitzer investigation trades at a much lower

calculate the real free cash flow.

it's a similar situation with some of the specialty pharma /licensing
compenies. They have low R&D expenses but by big chunks (with real cash) of
research and products. Then they do "nonreoccurring non cash writeoffs" on same
intagibles which reduce subsequent amortization expense and make earnings
appear higher. Those companies typically trade at lower PE's and some people
wonder why - it's simply that those companies over the LT down't generate the
cash flow that other companies do that expense R&D rather than buy capitalized
chunks of it. Enough of a rant for today, I guess.

Dean Foods' growth and earnings are stymied now: accretive acquisitions have
stopped, and raw material prices have substantially increased for milk
producers. The conventional wisdom is - as I understand it & I could be wrong -
you don't want to be in food companies when oil and other raw materials
(grain/transport/storage) are increasing, because these prices cannot
easily/quickly/totally be passed on to consumers. Nevertheless, I'll go for a
few shares of DF now. Families will continue to consume milk; I just hope DF
can figure out how to maintain its profitability.

re PFE Bought this stock about 6 years ago and it has never never never been in

When you bought PFE 6 years ago you bought the stock when it was everybodies
darling and trading at a PE > 30. Now it's in the doghouse and trading at a PE
of 12-13. The stock has risks without doubt but it certainly has a good chance
of earning you greater rewards going forward than in 1998.

Paul, one thing that can be said for your rationale for the stock, is that you
are not limited by rational analysis. :o)

every statement that you made is a reason NOT to own it. sounds like you really
wanted to own it, however.

FOOD FYI: my food stocks are low these days. no grocery stores (we discussed
that sector!). I Still own SVU (from 2002) and FDP (from August). Thinking of
buying back SLE. I always wanted to buy chickens, but never found the value.

CArl, this charge was reported on CNBC Friday too. that there was a lot of
selling of the financials ETFs. Now, I understand that if the financial ETFs
own financial and insurance stocks, they will go down because of the lower
pricing of the stocks that make up the index (ETF). But why would that selling
of the ETFS cause pressure itself on the underlying stocks? I thought ETFs were
like closed end funds, a finite number of shares were issues and
traders/investors bought or sold each others shares? am i missing something?

I believe "ETF" in this case referred not to exchange traded vehicles such as
XLF, but to baskets that some of the brokers (someone like Merrill) sell which
are like mutual funds, but are traded intraday, so when shares are sold they
are in effect "redeemed." As such, if there are significant redemptions, the
brokers must then liquidate the underlying positions to fund the redemptions.
There was an article I read which discussed this, but now the link is dead.

Certainly you could see the overall pressure on the sector on Thursday, and the
pressure on the banks and brokers seemed to occur in unison, but it could also
have been just the overall market weakness pushing down the most visible
financial stocks. The interesting thing is that the banks and brokers rebounded
nicely on Friday, even while the insurers were still down, so whatever effect
there was from the baskets only lasted one day.

It seems like the damage to some of the insurers might be overdone, as they
will have to pay some penalties and perhaps shake up management, but they
should still generate tremendous earnings in the long run. I wouldn't buy any
of them until the case and its effects are better known, but there will
probably be some nice trades/investments in that sector when some of the smoke
clears.

Hi Paul - One pure play for chicken is a small producer in Georgia called
Cagle's (CGLA AMEX listing). Cagle's, Inc. along with its wholly owned
subsidiary, Cagle's Farms, Inc., produce, market and distribute fresh and
frozen poultry products. The operations of the Company consist of breeding,
hatching and growing of chickens; feed milling; processing; further processing,
and marketing.

When feed prices were low, Cagle's always had a good and profitable quarter.
(http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CGLa)

With overall chicken prices so low, I do not know how they can continue to
remain profitable.

I also, like your idea on GMK who is a dominant tortilla maker but can you
think of any company that is a pure play in this space? I recently read that
tortilla consumption now exceeds that of white bread. GMK has paid a dividend
in the past but Yahoo does not show any recent dividend activity.

I sold 2/3 of my ABS holdings but like the stock below $20. They have a hidden
jewel in their undervalued real estate holdings which eventually will give them
a competitive advantage against their competitors. They bought Bristol Farms
last month which is a high end "gourmet" food provider located in Southern
California. They plan on rolling out this specialized store concept into their
exclusive geographical markets (a store w/i a store perhaps) to compete with
the likes of Whole Foods. The CEO has a lot on his plate and I do not see a
turnaround in sustained growing earnings until late next year.

Here is an excellent article on companies that have significant real estate
holdings. (http://www.buildings.com/Articles/detail.asp?ArticleID=1525)

Notice that JCP already divested their drug division and Sears has almost
tripled from their lows last year at $19. Both of these companies had
significant real estate holdings that they acquired 20 years or more ago. The
company real estate acquisition "land" costs are carried on the books at "cost"
not "market" value. ABS is the only company on this list that has not had any
significant price move. I estimate that ABS may have at least $1 million per
store in unrealized "land" real estate gains for their stores 20 years or
older. I think on my last review of their properties, over 50% of their stores
fell into this category. These unrealized gains could represent as much as
$5-$8 per share. The CEO could unlock these gains by creating a separate
division that acts as an REIT or leasing agent to their other subsidiaries.
This may be his long term plan but as of yet it is unannounced. He has however,
begun to create separate profit centers with each of their separate store
within a store centers (Bristol Meyers, Sav-On, Shaws etc).

ABS is an excellent value play as "work in progress". I will be loading up next
year at prices below $20.

Nice writeup on the Big Pharma.

If you wanted the negative argument on PFE I think it would center around the
2005 PE of 12 being much greater than the 2005 - 2008 growth rate of about 5%
per year (or at least Goldman Sachs has 2.86 EPS in 2008). And if you believe
that Kerry will be elected that growth rate is probably too high as the
democratic party relies on lower drug prices to win popular support, and lax
tort reform so that trial laywers can continue to line the coffers of the
democratic party. If you believe Bush will be reelected I think you have a

of risks to its upside price target which include political risks facing the
pharmaceutical industry which may result in major changes affecting drug

attempted changes to healthcare delivery that were potentially damaging. The
level of damage possible if a Democratic administration gets creative
(single-payering Medicare, whatever) is not estimable. It is not clear that a
Kerry administration would continue support for the private sector's drug

I have PFE, BMY, JNJ, NVS also.

Have FRX on my watch list. Guess I missed an opportunity to buy when stock hit
lows few weeks ago.

I've been willing to make small bets recently on a number of other drug
companies in the hope that their earnings or revenues or drug approval
prospects might improve, and they might consequently be looked upon more
favorably by the market. These stocks include:

PRX: generic drugs. Pretty decent profit margins in recent years. Sales growth.
But much of that from acquisitions. Sometimes generics don't have much of a
profit life; not only can I not understand if this company is paying a fair
price for its acquisitions, I can't even see the bigger picture which is, is
buying other companies here a strategy that is reasonable and sustainable?

(Bus. Week now has a positive article regarding some analysts' expectations for
the company.)

AMGN: Biotechnology. Strong sales and earnings. Stock seems to be at relatively
low price imo. (However, "relative" is such a dangerous word, and as regards
"imo": I've been wrong many, many times.)

IVGN: supplier of research data, reagents, tissue culture, etc. Good sales
growth, relatively low forward p/e, some insider buys @$50 (stock closed Fri.
@55+). A real speculation at this point, imo.

OSIP: a speculative bet on cancer drug Tarceva being approved in '05.

IMDC: Medical device company. Averaged up a little on this one after FDA
approved Genzyme's Hylaform Plus for facial wrinkles. Inamed will market and
distribute drug world-wide.

Hoping I can get a decent gainer in one or more of the above and that the gains
will exceed the losses I might see on any of the losers.

I had seen low commodity prices discussed in this article about #3 chicken
company and IPO, Gold Kist (GKIS).

aside: Apparently this Gold Coast IPO wasn't such a great success (for sellers
and brokers). And the stock still looks expensive to me.

4-10-06_22-48-10_n06515355_newsml

Somewhat confusing to me as you had indicated that chicken prices were so low
as to perhaps tank profitability while this article suggests that earnings of
producers are being helped by HIGH chicken prices. Perhaps it's a judgment and
depends on one's perspective.

My opinion: Because commodity prices might have or do have, such a great affect
on profitability of the chicken/egg producers, and that commodity prices
fluctuate quite a bit (sometimes), that for small companies in the sector that
have to compete with well-capitalized giants like Tyson, investors in the
smaller producers might best be served by assuring themselves that a margin of
safety exists such that these smaller companies should not have a lot of debt
compared to capital. To me, there's a risk with CGLA which sports a d/e of
about .9, according to Yahoo. So I remain more attracted to Sanderson Farms
(SAFM) with a d/e maybe about .1. (I'm looking at it but I have no position.)
SAFM also shows more cash than debt, according to Yahoo, although this might be
inorrect because SAFM's just paid a special dividend. Again, jmo, I could be
very wrong - there are a lot of other factors that could be more significant in
affecting stock price of either company in future.

Paul, I was just looking at Gold Kist and have to agree with you that it was
not a great success. The underwriters had to cut both the size of the offering
and the price. However I would like to know why you think the price still looks
expensive.

I do not want to put words in Eric's mouth but I think we are both looking at
current high chicken prices and the fairly recent collapse of grain prices. The
low grain prices should hold, due to bumper crops, at least through next July
and then adjust to crop expectations and demand. As you stated it could be
one's perspective, we could be looking slightly more down the road. I thought
GKIS looked rather interesting although I am not crazy about the 50M shares and
only 12M float with an " additional 1,800,000 shares of common stock at the
initial public offering price solely to cover over-allotments, if any."

tough and too competitive for that large difference to be a sustainable. (I
could be wrong.)

I'll just take a chance and jump right in to presume I might guess what the
board's ideal criteria might be: A stock that:

sells below net current assets
has many years of earnings
pays a dividend that's not been cut in 10 years
has good liquidity

But who knows?

We've found that it's difficult to get more than three people to agree on a

seems to come to a valuation opportunity differently.

just to throw in my two cents' worth, when i look for a value stock, i am
usually looking for:

a stock that trades well below what i consider it to be worth based on its
earnings, growth, and book value, and with some kind of consistent or
innovative product or business, to help ensure future growth

or:

a stock trading at or below what i consider to be its current fair value, with
consistent earnings growth, a solid balance sheet, some kind of dividend
(usually), predictable future growth, an established niche and/or customer
base, leadership in its sector, and then optionable so that i can sell puts

in the first case i look to accumulate the shares expecting that i will be
rewarded in the long run as the price of the stock appreciates to reflect the
company's fundamentals as they become better known and continue to
improve...this often takes a while to bear fruit, but the returns can be
significant once the company finally gets discovered

in the second case i watch for the stock to become temporarily oversold in
order to sell puts, figuring that the fundamentals will keep the stock from
taking any major hits, and capturing the put premium over time...if the stock
moves down to where i think it is especially compelling, particularly during a
time when the overall market is also well oversold (such as the august
decline), i will often sell in-the-money puts in order to also attempt to
capture some of the upside of the stock...obviously this increases both the
risk and the potential reward of the trade

for me stocks like MRK, PFE, MO, etc. would automatically be excluded due to
litigation risk, unless they dropped so low that the potential downside was
already more than factored in, as in MO when it was around 20 a few years
ago...that would be a different category of value, sort of a hybrid of the two
above scenarios, where basically "things can't get any worse," though of course
we all know for some companies, they still can -G-

JMHO, and curious to know what others would view as the most important factors
in buying a "value" position

Thank you for the input. I really did not consider Cagle's debt to be an issue
as their current cash flow is now at sufficient levels to cover it. However,
after looking at SAFM's financials compared to Cagles, I like SAFM's much more.
They have a low D/E as you stated and good free flow cash flow. They also pay a
dividend and are selling at an equivalent PE of around 6.

Cagle's at one time paid a very large dividend but this was many years back. I
suspect that may have been before they spent all that money to modernize their
facilities and cash was pouring in. I believe the Perry Complex that they sold
the first quarter of this year was an inefficient plant and compounded their
losses when margins were tight.

SAFM was a potential 6 bagger if acquired in the 2000-2001 period around
$6/share. Based on their relative price performance SAFM vs CGLA (over the last
five years) http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=CGLa&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=safm
SAFM has done very well.

From:- with a K
HELE's Q3 earnings guidance, a penny shy of analysts' expectations, hurt them.
Yet HELE has held firm on its 2005 guidance of $2.50 to $2.70, first raised on
April 30 and reiterated May 13, July 12, and Oct. 12. (Reuters) Its Q3 sales
guidance on Oct. 12 was for an increase of 15% to 21% YOY.

EPS and sales have been growing nicely (up 20 and 28% TTM) but my sense is that
sales would have continued to grow less fast than earnings, ultimately a
problem, and perhaps the reason behind the OXO acquisition.

HELE has a very small float (20 mil shares) and a small increase in demand or
increase in short-covering could help the stock start moving again. To that
end, a 2% increase in institutional ownership occurred in the last 3 months
(Reuters)

On valuation measurements I tend to look for, HELE scores well: a PEG of .80
vs. 1.37 for Appliance and Tool sector and 1.58 for S&P 500; P/B of 2.19 vs.
5.59 and 3.98. Since 2000 it has grown its net profit margin from 4.8% to 15.1%
COGS and SG&A expenses appear to be under control. ROE also has moved up
nicely, from 7.9% to 20.4% (ValueLine).

Since 2000 it has sported a low PE (around 11), yet has grown EPS 14.5%
annually, which tells me it is granted little respect and confidence. It's had
plenty of time to be discovered!

Cash balance is down and inventories are up, a flag. And HELE does not compare
as strongly in P/CF, asset and inventory turns. Other than the ERP system
mentioned below, I'm not sure what management is doing to address this. So I am
skeptical of management's operational abilities; can they execute? The Tactica
experience didn't exactly instill confidence. Yet I am willing to see how
management does with OXO for a few quarters; perhaps some OXO management will
come over?

I view HELE as a dramatically different company with the OXO acquisition. So I
recently started a new position, after selling in April and missing around $4
or so to the peak in July. IMO, HELE nows sells a far wider range of everyday
things that people want and need, at fair prices, which people are going to buy
regardless of the economy. A recent Fool column referred to HELE as an "aging
beauty," which I think is unfairly harsh and doesn't look to the future. After
all, OXO should add $100 mil in sales annually to this $500mil company. The
column was also critical of its cash flow, but FWIW Value Line shows a steady
increase of cash flow per share, from $.83 in 1999 to $2.64 in 2003. You bring
up a good point about HELE's cash outlays, yet one hopes the spending will slow
or are one-time events.

Recent 10-Q items that struck me as encouraging:

During the second fiscal quarter, we substantially completed Phase 1 of
development and implementation of a new Global Enterprise Resource Planning
system. On September 7, 2004, we went live on the new system. With the
implementation of this new system, most of our businesses run under one
integrated information system. We believe this system will help to promote
uniform business processes and practices amongst our subsidiaries. We are
currently in the process of closely monitoring the new system and making normal
and expected adjustments to improve its effectiveness.

• We continue to expand our brand offerings in our Skin Care Category. On
September 29, 2004, we acquired certain assets related to the worldwide
production and distribution of TimeBlock&#174; and Skin Milk&#174; body and
skin care product lines from Naterra International, Inc. TimeBlock&#174; is a
line of clinically tested anti-aging skin care products. Skin Milk&#174; is a
line of body, bath and skin care products enriched with milk proteins, vitamins
and botanical extracts. The Company paid $12,000,000 in cash in the transaction
funded out of the Company's revolving line of credit. We currently project the
brand acquisition to contribute approximately $15,000,000 of sales in fiscal
2006. 

Graham Fair Value calculation, using Yahoo estimates:

Company: HELE
Date: 10/17/04
Next year's expected earnings: $2.80, vs. low estimate of $2.90 and high of $3
(note the declining trend)
EPS growth rate used for estimate: 8%, vs. consensus of 12%
Multiple Graham used for estimate: 8.5
Graham Fair Value: $48.29
Current Price: $27.94

A personal aside: A few months I was at some friends, helping put on a dinner.
Knowing how much I like to cook, the wife there says, "Look at my cool new
measuring cup." She was right, it was cool, and it was one of those "why didn't
I think of it" moments. Only then did I see it was an OXO brand and later saw
that HELE had acquired it. "A patented angled surface lets you read measurement
markings by looking straight down into the Cup and eliminates the need to fill,
check and adjust the amount of liquid you are measuring."

Carl Worth: Many factors and ways to consider in buying a value stock.

I like to have quantitative measures for which I can evaluate stocks within a
sector. Many sectors, in my view, have key metrics which one can use to
determine if a stock is in a buy range or not. For bank stocks for example,
efficiency (a metric), book value, and return on assets are key measures. If I
can find a bank stock for example, with an ROA of 1.5%selling at 1.5 x book
value, that is a buy opportunity. Or a bank stock that is profitable and sells
at book value. For manufacturing firms I often use ROE in a valuation formula.
For software/consulting firms I like to use profit margin and relate that in a
formulaic way to p/e. I generally look at all stocks in terms of p/e, p/sales,
p/book.

I don't say having these metric rules-of-thumb are the best way. Certainly not
the only way I evaluate potential value stocks. Probably the most frequent for
me though.
