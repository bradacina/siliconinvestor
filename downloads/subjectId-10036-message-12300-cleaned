I will post their last earnings report, which mentions some of their new
salmonella and other testing products. I haven't DD'ed enough myself to say if
there is a proprietary advantage or simply a first mover lead in filling these
niches.

A good friend has a private investment in Vicam, a firm which had to pay NEOG
several million - I can't find my notes on the exact cause but it may have been
patent infringement. I will post more once I have firm information.

This is a speculative play but NEOG is delivering products in an important

Neogen Reports 37% Increase in Revenues

Neogen Reports 37% Increase in Revenues

LANSING, Mich., March 27 /PRNewswire/ -- Neogen Corporation (Nasdaq: NEOG)
today announced a 37% increase in quarterly revenues, and earnings that met
analyst expectations. Neogen reported earnings of $0.12 per share for the
third quarter, which ended Feb. 28, as compared with $0.11 for the same period
last year. Third quarter revenues were $8,601,000 in fiscal year 2001
compared to $6,276,000 in FY 2000.
Year-to-date revenues were $25,734,000 -- a 51% increase over the prior
year comparable revenues of $17,041,000. Year to date, Neogen's FY 2001
earnings were $0.39 per share, as compared to $0.30 for the first nine months
of last year.
In its third quarter, Neogen continued its strong improvement in income
from operations, increasing 29% on a quarter-to-quarter comparison with the
previous fiscal year. Year to date, Neogen's operating income was $2,899,000
-- a 74% increase from the prior year's $1,660,000 at the end of the third
quarter.
"Exceptional performance is what our investors have come to expect from
us, and what we expect from ourselves," said James Herbert, Neogen's
president. "Our solid third quarter and year-to-date operating results
represent significant strides toward our goal of becoming the dominant company
in providing food and animal safety solutions."
Neogen's quarterly revenue increase was led by its Food Safety Division,
with an increase of 40% from the previous fiscal year. Year to date, Food
Safety revenues were up 52% from last year's first 9 months. The Company's
Animal Safety Division saw a 34% increase in revenues for the third quarter,
and stood at a 50% increase on a year-to-date comparison.
"We are very pleased we achieved analyst expectations for the quarter,
since our comparisons suffered because of a greater than normal delivery of
botulism B vaccine in last year's third quarter," said Lon Bohannon, Neogen's
chief operating officer. "This factor alone caused a net income variation of
$.03 per share in the quarter-to-quarter comparison."
In the third quarter, Neogen expanded its comprehensive product offerings
by adding Reveal(R) for Salmonella enteriditis (Se). The new test kit to
detect Se, a pathogen of particular concern to the egg and poultry industries,
comes as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration prepares to implement Se-
reduction regulations. Government estimates place the number of Se-infected
eggs at more than 7 million in the United States alone on an annual basis. Se
has been the United States' leading cause of salmonellosis in humans since
1994. The effects of salmonellosis can range from mild nausea and diarrhea to
severe, and potentially fatal, complications in the very young and old, and
among those with weakened immune systems.
In the quarter, the Company also received a key USDA performance
verification of Neogen's rapid test to detect genetically-modified corn.
Neogen's test detects StarLink corn, a brand not approved for human
consumption that spurred numerous recalls when it found its way into the food
supply. The USDA's verification clears the way for use of Neogen's test by
governmental agencies and food processors.
Neogen Corporation develops and markets products and services dedicated to
food and animal safety. The Company's Food Safety Division markets diagnostic
test kits to detect foodborne bacteria, natural toxins, genetic modifications,
food allergens, drug residues, plant diseases and sanitation concerns.

Neogen's Animal Safety Division markets a complete line of diagnostics,
veterinary instruments, veterinary pharmaceuticals, nutritional supplements
and wound care products.

on the proprietary or lawsuit aspects. I can see possibilities for increased
use of test kits given concerns about meat supply. But if there isn't some

That scenario would be consistant with insider selling on the revenue pop.

Nice one day move in TAXI. Congrats to you. I missed that TAXI too. Saw the

MEL very likely will work out from $36. You may recall the directors rejected a
buyout offer couple of years ago @40. ($80 pre split). Took a year for the

I've closed out the last of my MBI now. Looks like ABK was, as you've offered
several times, the better investment:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=mbi&d=2y&c=abk

So many cross currents here. In looking back, it NOW seems obvious that MBI and
ABK were prime candidates for value investors. But at the time, and with MBI
dropping to about 1/2 where it is now, I wasn't at all so sure as I made adds
to my position. And given that my general preference is to diversify around a
position rather than add to it, I'm surprised and disappointed that I did not
buy ABK also when its price was much lower.

Oh well. I'll just continue the hunt for other insurance companies that now
seem undervalued.

Paul, thanks for the kind words, but I always considered MBI and ABK kind of
interchangable. I was rooting for ABK because that was the horse I was riding.
I just liked the business and continue to own it, though I probably wouldn't
buy ABK at this price de novo. The really great thing about this stock is that
people get scared once a year and sell it off to stupid prices.

Another stock I own on the same thinking - great niche franchise in a financial
business - is MCO, which I bought before the spin-off as Dun & Bradstreet. I
sold the DNB stub because what I wanted out of that was the Moodys franchise.
One of these days I'm going to wake up and find that Buffett has bought 15% of
MCO. I don't think the current price is a Ben Graham bargain, but look at the
track record of MCO. Its not easy to find because of the spinoff, but you will
find a pretty good summary of it in the 1999 DNB annual report. This is just a
super business. I think this is the business that Charlie Munger compared to
owning Stanford University.

These are two stocks I spend very little time following and, like my shares in
Berkshire, kind of forget I own. I just know their businesses are making money
for me while I spend my time doing my job, knowing they're doing theirs.

Anybody planning on going to Omaha for the Berkshire meeting? I may do it this
year. It would be kind of fun to have a bunch of us from this thread meet for
the baseball game or something. E-mail me privately (clarkejj@aol.com).

Timba's a Tough Grader!!!

Timba, thanks for your comments regarding Mobility Electronics (MOBE). I concur
that the issue is its
cash-burn rate, as it is not yet cash flow positive.
Its relative "youth," however, does not concern me,
as its technology seems promising. Just yesterday it
announced a new product for use in the digital camera
market. With the stock trading under its cash per share,
I could no longer resist and picked up 1000 shares
today at $2. The Company has said it will be profitable
by the 4th qtr, and I doubt the Board would authorize a
$5 million share buyback if it did not have confidence
that the company will start generating cash from opera-
tions before it uses all the cash obtained from its IPO.
In any event, since it has no debt and is showing signi-
ficant revenue growth, it should be able to borrow funds
if need be to get it across the bridge to profitability.
The icing on the cake for me, so to speak, was learning
today that the Chairman of the Board recently bought
over 68,000 shares at $2.90. I will dump my holdings if
the stock breaks the strong technical support it seems to
have in the $1.80 - $2 range. But, for now at least, I'm
on board with a toehold position. You know, even Apple was
a start-up at one time. :)

ChuckR....

I know you addressed your inquiry to Michael, but he's not around very much
anymore.

As far as my record with NetNets and Cash flow stocks....well, my NetNet picks
are too recently purchased to have a long term perspective. In the short term,
their performance leaves something to be desired. I believe they are
underperforming when compared to the market. However, one of the reasons I use
this method, is that there is a "margin of safety" involved. If these companies
are liquidated, there would be money left for the shareholders to get paid at
least what I bought my shares for. Additionally, I bought the stocks with a 5
year view. If the stock price of these companies just gets up to NetNet value
within the next 5 years, I'll have a nice return on the investment.

The ones I purchased using a low multiple of price to free cash flow approach
combined with a low multiple to NetNet valuation are doing much better in the
short term. However, that may be due more to this market turn-around than to
the picks themselves.

I'm in a position to "watch the tape" and the ones I picked recently that
appeared to jump off the tape at me are doing the best, but these are momentum
trades and not value plays.

I know of no takeover speculation. I just think it's very likely to be bought

strategy is vulnerable to them burning capital, which I hope they will not. I

"2X net-net", "3X net-net". Careful there.

I know net-net investing and have never and probably would never invest based
on any function of that ratio unless the stock trades below it. We might be
doing a little too much net-net analysis on this thread - that is one arrow in
the quiver, and one I use rarely. Its only appropriate in my view for a tiny
sliver of stocks I look at, and for those it is very important. I don't think
Ben Graham ever intended for net-net to be the denominator of a multiple, like
P/E or P/B. And that multiple has no meaning to me either. For the vast
majority of stocks I buy, net-net is not something I would even consider
relevant.

2/3 of net-net valuation has some intuitive meaning in terms of liquidation
value. What does 2X net-net mean? You need to think about that before taking a
wonderful investment model way beyond its "circle of competence".

This would be an interesting discussion. I'd like to participate in that, just
in case there's something I'm missing here.

Hello James Clark!

I'll offer my thinking on using a multiple of NetNet as I derive it, which is
probably pretty close to how Graham outlined for deriving NetNet.

The questions I face are: "How do I find a good company to invest in that
offers me a reasonable rate of return on my money with reasonable safety of
principal?" "How would I recognize it if I saw it?" "How do I process the vast
amounts of information available to me for free on the internet in such a way
as to be able to cull from all that data the sets of facts germane to an
intelligent decision(and do so relatively quickly)?" "How and when do I
evaluate the results of those decisions?"

I don't know how many books I've read over the years to try to answer these and
many other questions, but it is a pretty impressive list, and it will probably
keep growing until the day that I die because I love the field and the
challenge.

One of the things that I've learned is that I must come up with my own style of
decision-making. Neither Graham, nor Buffet, nor Fisher, nor Pring, nor
Livermore, nor Rogers, nor anyone else is on hand for the crisis times and none
will take responsibility for my losses. I have lots of help from their
accumulated wisdom, but ultimately I stand alone. Which is fine, I accept the
challenge freely.

Having said that, what is a fair price to pay for a company?
X times sales? Y times book? Z times income? W times discounted dividend? T
times cash? V times cash flow? When do any of these STOP being a good price at
which to own a company? If I buy stock in a company and, through a stroke of
good fortune it is up 40% in a few days should I sell it?

The answers, for me, are never black and white. It is usually a combination of
the above. A TimbaBear combination.

I have arrived at the notion that "book value" as currently derived is a
meaningless calculation. It is a strongly held notion of mine, so strong that I
won't use "book value". But the concept that was its genesis is an important
one for "fair price" evaluation purposes. So I have replaced "book value" with
NetNet value. This is for my use, it does not need to be accepted as
appropriate by or for anyone else. I'll indicate that I used it (on this board)
as a friendly gesture to help the other fine investors/speculators here to
understand my thinking, and to generate discussions like I hope this one turns
out to be, but not because I need anyone's approval.

I use a multiple of NetNet value similarly to the way that I would use a
multiple of book value. Only, I have much more confidence that the number
represents something meaningful. Something I think was originally intended by
those who first had the need to get a base line valuation and filled that need
by deriving "book value" calculations.

I agree that NetNet valuation alone, or buying companies solely because they
are near or below this calculation is not the sole investment approach that
Graham used. Nor is it the sole approach I use. There is no substitute for
knowledge of the concepts behind financial analysis and security analysis.

I believe that a multiple of NetNet and a multiple of Free Cash Flow (again, as
Timba derives it) are more germane to a sound investment decision than "book
value" and "P/E"

I too am looking forward to a discussion on this topic! However, I'm going away
for the week-end and won't be able to participate again until sometime Sunday
afternoon or evening.

From:Q.
James, you asked me why price/net-net is a good ratio. Read along, and you'll
see from my argument below why this is so.

I often see analysts talk about the cash held by a company with a beaten down
stock price. You'll see them subtract the cash from the market cap, and when
that yields a number close to zero, they will say "look, you get the underlying
business operations nearly for free because of all the cash that they have." I
recently saw this in a MSDW report on a semiconductor equipment stock, for
example.

The typical circumstances where this arises is a cyclical tech stock does a
secondary offering at the peak of a cycle, so it's loaded with cash.
Immediately after the offering, it doesn't have a low price/cash ratio. But
that changes. The market then sours, and all the stocks in that sector
collapse, regardless of their cash. The stock that did the big secondary stands
apart from its peers, though, because now the market cap is not much bigger
than the cash held by the company. Such a stock is appealing, if the company
doesn't burn cash (however, you must be careful because most stocks with low
price/cash ratios do burn lots of cash, and they are much less appealing as an
investment).

If you will accept the fact that analysts often do subtract the cash position
from the market cap, then perhaps you will also accept the idea of dividing,
rather than subtracting, these two quantities. The ratio tells you what the
percentage difference is, anyway. The same information is embodied in both
quantities. If it's meaningful to talk about market cap minus cash, i.e.,
percentage of market cap represented by cash, then it's also meaningful to talk
about market cap divided by cash, as a ratio.

Now in my previous posts I've been talking not about cash, but about "net-net."

By "net-net", I've been referring to "net current assets" as defined by Graham.
It's the current assets minus all liabilities. I view this as a generalized
version of cash. In the case of the typical debt-free company that isn't a
retailer or apparel maker, the two are often almost the same thing. However, I
find net current assets to be more useful than cash, because it consistently
takes into account all the working capital and LT debt, not just cash. It's
pretty much what the company would fetch if they liquidated tomorrow.

So, following the logic, if you accept the widespread practice of subtracting
cash from market cap to measure a stock's value, and if you recognize that you
get the same information by computing a ratio rather than difference of these
two quantities, and if you recognize that net current assets is a better
quantity than cash to measure the liquidation value of the company, then ...
you will accept my use of net-net as the denominator in a ratio.

As for what multiple of net-net is attractive, I don't hold to the idea that a
ratio of 2/3 is magical, just because Graham once found it to be useful for the
market conditions prevalent in his day. If you apply a ratio of 2/3 as an upper
limit today, and if you also require that the company should have a reasonably
good cash flow situation, as I do, then you will find that your screen will
generate only a few very tiny companies with a questionable future. If you
relax the ratio 2/3 upwards, to 1.0, in today's market you will find a few
stocks with a market cap of over $50 million whre the companies actually have a
promising future. I've identified two I found this way, FNDT and CLTK. If you
further relax the upper limit for the ratio upwards from 1.0, even larger
market cap stocks will survive your screen. The point is that the market works
in a way where it prices stocks with richer multiples as the market cap
increases, and this is especially true for multiples of the price/net-net
ratio. If you do net-net screens yourself, and you apply a market cap limit to
the screen, you can easily verify this. Thus, you must decide what market cap
stocks you are willing to buy, and then you can find the cheapest stocks, using
a multiple of net-net, if you choose.

I use the net-net screen, with a specified upper limit for the price/net-net
ratio and specified lower limits for cash flow and market cap. I use this to
generate a list of a dozen or so stocks. I don't just buy all those stocks. I
use the screen as the first step in picking one or two stocks that are
attractive based on many criteria, not just based on the ratio to net-net. This
is a scheme for finding attractive cheap stocks, and doing it quickly.

Thanks for the well-thought-out replies. Lets take this a step further.

It is very nice to be discussing this issue with others who thoroughly
understand the premise of net-net investing, and are willing to think beyond
that. I have a track record on this thread of thinking beyond that too - a
strategy of looking for net-nets with real estate assets, then adding the least
that real estate could be worth to the net current assets. That works. Over and
over again.

<<If you will accept the fact that analysts often do subtract the cash position
from the market cap, then perhaps you will also accept the idea of dividing,
rather than subtracting, these two quantities.>>

I always subtract cash from market cap, but I do not accept at all that your
conclusion follows from that. Subtraction is very different from division. If
you're talking about the difference between 2/3 of net-net and 1 times net-net,
we're in the same camp - the stock trades below net current assets. But when
one starts saying a stock is attractive because it trades at 2 times net-net or
3 times net-net, or start thinking net-net is the same as book value you're in
dangerous territory. That was what I was responding to when I posted last
night.

Let me give you a real example. NUFO has about $9 of cash per share. Its an
optical technology company. I had an analyst pressuring me to buy this at 18,
and he was making a Graham case - it trades at 2 times cash. An optical company
at a Graham valuation. But this one illustrates the error you make by equating
subtraction with division. Lets think through this one, and its real time so
look at a chart of the last six months.

NUFO only has $2 of revenues per share (and needless to say no earnings). $9 of
cash.

2 times cash sounds really cheap, right. But when you look at what you're
buying, with $9 of cash and an $18 price, you're paying $9 for $2 of revenues
and no earnings. Thats not cheap.

[So you're probably wondering how NUFO played out. Well, I should have listened
to my analyst. The stock tripled. From 18 to 60. Ah, but then if went to 9 1/2.
This is a volatile little bugger. At 9 1/2, the valuation would have made sense
even to me, but by that time I had forgotten about it. A week later its at 16.
Missed it twice, once when I should have been buying it.]

Another way of looking at this idea is this. You say net current assets is a
proxy for cash, which I completely agree with. I have $80 of cash in my wallet
now, and the wallet is probably worth something though its old and falling
apart. If I asked a price for you to buy my wallet, would you even think twice
unless that price were below $80? i.e., the "net-net" value were below 1x? If I
were selling you my wallet, if I asked for 2 times cash would that mean
anything different than if I asked for 1.5 times cash or 1.01 times cash? Thats
why I argue that if you're doing net-net logic, the only ratios that matter are
those lower than 1.

You say net current assets is a proxy for cash, which I completely agree with. 

Net current assets is not a proxy for cash, in my opinion, unless you are
shutting down the business. The net net calculation is basically a liquidation
value - no more ongoing business.

If you are shutting down the business, then you ain't gonna get no multiple of
net-net - you gonna get 1x maximum. A multiple of net-net makes no sense to me
whatever. You either liquidate the operating capital, or you stay in business.

Now, one of the major ways we made money in LBO's was by streamlining the
balance sheet. Speed up the collections. Just in time inventory. Slow down the
payables. A major subjective question was whether your business had enough
power in the marketplace to do these things.

If you want the earnings from the business, you have to leave the capital
invested in the business. You won't get many orders if it's cash terms only,
before you buy the raw materials. That's what would be required if you were not
to have money in receivables and inventory.

Seems like there might be some double counting going on here.

Jim,

Speaking of net-nets....wonder if you’d comment on KDUS. Here’s a summary from
a
while back:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=15259822

Add to the puzzle this:

http://responsibleshareholder.com/wsnCAFC.html

And the discussion on SI’s KDUS thread:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=19197

If the company plans to utilize the tax loss carryover, I’d assume that they
either have to
be acquired by a company that can use the loss (and the tax law on this is
pretty
complicated from what little I understand) or else itself acquire a money
making
company that would enable it to use the tax losses.

If anyone wants to invest, be aware that the spread is often 10% or greater.

Re: investing with multiples of net-nets. And regarding book value.

From the discussion here, I can't determine what would be a good buy point for
a multiple net-net stock or the sell point, or what the holding period might be
for such purchases; there's no empirical evidence presented. Imo, what is shown
is another method, but it's not value investing.

Several successful value investors who've provided historical data on what
works in investing believe book value is a significant metric. That would be
Dreman, O' Shaughnessy, Tweedy Browne, maybe Graham.

If a company makes money, and does so most years, then there are only three
things that can happen to that money: money gets returned to shareholders in
the form of dividends, money is kept in the business (in the form of assets as
the business pays down debt or uses the money to acquire more assets), or money
is expensed (like paid out in big bonuses to managers). Tracking book value
over a period of years is an indication how value is kept and built up in the
business - whether that value is capital assets, inventory, intangibles.
Knowing what the book value of a company is, how that book value is growing,
and how current and past stock prices relate to current and past book value,
that all provides a reference point on the continuum of the company's
undervalued to overvalued extreme.

It seems to me a couple of things are going on here:

One is the argument that since "I stand alone" and no one's "on hand for the
crisis times and none will take responsibility for my losses", it seems then
the conclusion is "Therefore I will do just what seems right for me and I will
have no one to blame but myself." My opinion is that Graham and Buffett do
stand by the the investor, and their methods either prevent the investor from
getting into a crisis or minimize the extent of that crisis (Graham's
preference for diversification).

Secondly, given the access to database sorts, we all have the ability to screen
for many variables. It seems to me the multiple net-net tactic is a result of
looking at the basic net-net strategy and concluding there either aren't
currently enough stocks that reside therein and/or the stocks that are there
look like cigar butts. If we just open up the criterion (go to multiples of
net-net, and we can experiment with this so easily), we can garner a wider
swath of possibilities. My guess is that Dr. Graham - and imo, Graham's legit
to bring up on this thread - would say, after giving a Jim Clarke-type
response, that he would want to see a back test of the multiple net metric and
also compare it with other metrics (For example FNDT and CLTK, presumably
attractive and selected as multiple of net-net purchase, might more readily be
chosen because of attractiveness to price/sales or price/earnings).

I would guess Dr. Graham would say about the stocks available currently in the
classic net-net screen, that if the number is few and they are all small cap
cigar butts, that that might be a good sign to just stay away from the net-net
approach until Mr. Market provides better opportunities. And, Dr. Graham might
add, Mr. Market for 50 or more years has, and likely will again, provide those
opportunities.

There are many folks happy with whatever metric works for them, it still does
not justify the use for me. What do I care about "retained earnings" from
previous years? I want to know what the company is doing today with its
resources. Do you know how many companies I have analyzed that had a "low price
to book" that were just garbage? Negative NetNet valuations, negative cash
flow...junk. What good are "retained earnings" if they are frittered away?

"...Tracking book value over a period of years is an indication how value is
kept and built up in the business - whether that value is capital assets,
inventory, intangibles...."

I agree with the principal, but don't agree that this is how it really plays
out. If one tracked the increase in NetNet value over time, it would reflect
the same thing you hope is being done by book value, but IMO more truly.

Now, I've seen some messages here over the week-end(I just got back and read
them) which seem to indicate that the poster believes that somehow using NetNet
is a static thing. For myself only, let me say that I use NetNet as a benchmark
for evaluating current price. One of many. To that benchmark I would add a
premium for the profitable, going business concern. Whether I cap that premium
at a multiple of NetNet or a multiple of Free Cash Flow, is another matter
entirely.

"...My opinion is that Graham and Buffett do stand by the the investor...." So,
if I use their methodology and lose money, they or their estates will
re-imburse me? Not in this lifetime! I stand alone when it hits the fan, just
like all investors.

"....It seems to me the multiple net-net tactic is a result of looking at the
basic net-net strategy and concluding there either aren't currently enough
stocks that reside therein and/or the stocks that are there look like cigar
butts..."

You're close here....it is more that I looked at that strategy and realized
that I wasn't adding in the other values of a going, growing, profitable
business concern. I was just arriving at NetNet valuation. How much is a dollar
of Free cash flow worth to the person who buys the stock?....I think it's worth
about $16....that's today's dollars for today's earnings. How much is a dollar
of dividend worth to the person who buys the stock? What if you have a company
that has two dollars of free cash flow and a dollar of dividend? If it's
undervalued today, how do you know? If it's over-valued tomorrow, how do you
know? If it's undervalued today, do you buy it, or wait for it to get cheaper?

It is the responsibility of the individual investor to either educate
themselves enough to derive their own answers or to hire someone who does it
for them (like mutual funds).

There is no way that I think NetNet is the same as book, it is better!
(Especially when combined with Free Cash Flow).

"Book Value" attempts to give a value to past undistributed profitability, but
to me it is a bogus paradigm. It gives me no flavor of the zeal or ambition of
management TODAY. There is no metric that really gives me that sense of

From:Q.
It's a good point to remind us that if a stock is trading above cash or above
net-net, then subtracting the cash or net current assets from the market cap is
merely an intermediate step toward pricing the residual. I sometimes see
analysts mentioning that a certain stock is trading a low PSR or P/E after
subtracting cash. Subtracting net current assets is something similar, but
better.

If a stock is trading at a multiple M (of sales, earnings, cashflow, or
whatever) and if it is trading at a multiple N of net-net (or cash if you
prefer), then the underlying company is trading at an adjusted multiple (1 -
1/N)* M. This adjusted multiple can be used to compare stocks.

In fact, it is possible to screen on this parameter, for low p/e, low PSR, or
whatever. I just gave it a try, using MarketGuide's NetScreen, and it works.

In my first attempt, I adjusted the criteria till it yielded a list of only 16
stocks, and in that list I found FLXS (a furniture maker). FLXS trades for 1.28
X net current assets. Thus, its p/e of 7.2 adjusts downward to 7.2 * (1-1/1.28)
= 7.2 * 0.22 = 1.6, which is one of the lowest values I can find for a company
that looks better than what Paul Senior calls a "cigar butt". (The stock is
thinly traded, though.)

The adjusted multiple could go negative. That's what happens when a stock
trades for less than net current assets. You can still compare the numbers. The
less positive, or more negative, the cheaper the valuation. Of course the
cheapest companies often look like cigar butts.

If the only stocks trading at deep discounts to net-net are cigar butts (and
I've found that's largely true in today's market), that might indeed lead you
to the correct conclusion that today's stocks are priced more richly than in
Graham's era, when he bought the titans of industry for 2/3 net-net. Doesn't
mean that you'll make the most money by staying in cash, though.

As for backtesting, I wish I could afford the tools to do it. O'Shaughnessy
reported quite a lot in his book, but he just used simple one- and
two-parameter screens. If you want to buy only low p/b stocks with high
one-year-relative strengths, which was one of his more successful screens,
that's good. It's as fancy as his criteria got. I wish I could backtest more
elaborate criteria, because I'd guess you can do a lot better than his basic
one- and two-parameter screens.

That net working capital is the money invested in the business. If you take

re. <<... the logic of your analysis and emphatically say its wrong>>

Apparently I didn't explain myself so that you can understand me, James.

Of course I realize that a company needs working capital to operate. (You must
think I'm very dim to suggest otherwise.)

As a shortseller, I thrive on selling stocks with no working capital, among
other criteria. Those companies are destined for the dustbin.

As a long, I'm discussing, on this thread, companies with excess working
capital. Please note the adjective "excess," i.e., more than the company needs.
A stock with a balance sheet this strong has more value than what is revealed
by its p/e or PSR.

I can compare two companies in the same industry that are otherwise similar,
with similar multiples, and the company that has lots more net current assets
will be the better value.

If you think there's something wrong with that, please forward your complaints
to the various analysts who identify the stock of best value in a sector by
subtracting cash before computing a multiple, which is pretty much what I'm
doing. The post to which you respond provides a new formulation for finding
stocks in this fashion.

If you don't understand or like it, that's fine with me, but please calm down,

On subtracting 'excess' net current assets being equivalent to subtracting cash
to get an adjusted PE more reflective of the true value: I would think it would

1.5 Billion in inventory, sometimes Accounts receiveable are difficult to
collect. This is not to say this approach doesn't have merit, just that cash
ain't trash and sometimes working capital assets are.
That said, FLXS trades at EV/EBITDA of 4 which is indeed cheap. One concern is
that SG&A seems to be rising despite flat sales and cash is falling, again
despite flat sales, usually conducive to building cash. They just warned so
looking at end user markets may give a clue on whether they burn or earn going

I still own MRVC at much higher prices wherein I figured (wrongly) it was a
growth-value play. And now I'm hesitant to come out and say it might be
suitable as a typical value investment candidate that might appear on this
thread.

I'm down quite a bit from my purchase prices on MRVC, and it's difficult to see
how or if ever I will recoup my losses on this one. Which brings me to an
interesting tactic on selling that most people I will guess (I have no facts)
would employ in this situation: that reasoning would be that if I hold on to it
I have to constantly endure the pain of seeing my mistake with this loser (-g-
or seeing that I'm the loser with this mistake), and be reminded that I can see
no hope of breaking even on it. So the reasonable or common approach would be
to sell it and move on.

However, I look at it differently. For MRVC, I believe I now have to try to
look at my purchase prices and unrealized losses as an irrelevancy. I calculate
a reasonable downside to MRVC to now be about 5 1/2. Given that optics/fiber
arena will still likely be a growth area and that MRVC has several incubator
companies (LMNE, others), I'd guess MRVC could recover substantially in a
better market environment, and that environment might show itself within a
couple of years, maybe sooner. I'd bet on a tripling in price or more - to 15
or better from the low. There could "easily" (he said -g-) be a triple from
today's price of 6+. Since I'm always looking for stocks that might double in a
couple of years, MRVC at its current price fits my criterion. It seems to be
what I'm looking for in a stock at its current price, so I don't want to
convince myself to sell it now. Even if I have been wrong on MRVC all along.
(sigh) And even if a trippling in price won't get me anywhere near breakeven
(SIGH).

Another issue then follows that conclusion. Which is: why or why not add to
position at these prices to lower my average purchase cost? I'm wrestling with
this now regarding MRVC. MRVC is a company with cash, resources, revenue, but
no earnings derived from revenue. To me, its business model is still untested,
and I'm now beat up and not sure I have the courage to buy more.
----------------
I'll add MRVC though to the thread list if you and a 2nd person here say that
you guys bought it as a value stock or consider it now to be a value stock.

Big negative now, imo, could be that they have a main manufacturing facility in

new product introductions, already delayed, will not meet sales or profit
expectations.

When - if - good times are envisioned, this stock will sell for at least 3x

fwiw blankmind, et. al.,I'm doubling up today on my losing exploratory position
in ESREF. On the surface, the financial ratios look all right, and there's
still good insider buying.

However, that was all so true last year also - before ESREF announced losses.
There are several dangerous aspects to ESREF: 1) They apparently are/were in a
new type of medical insurance for European countries -- a business they did not
understand (and neither did or do I - ouch), and an arena where maybe no one
else has tread before either. With good reason - there's no evidence it's a
viable or profitable segmentation. 2)Worse - that business, as well as other
reinsurance businesses they are in, are long tailed. Which, as you know, (but
I'll repeat) for ESREF apparently means they get their premiums (money) now but
they don't know when they'll see a claim, how many claims they will see, when
their exposure will end, or how much their exposure is. That has bitten them in
the past. (As can happen to insurers who are in the long tail stuff (except
maybe Berkshire -g-)) So, in spite of ESREF trying to shore up their reserves,
these losses might not be done with yet, and could harm ESREF even more.

One thing though that I find interesting, if not somewhat reassuring, is that
there are (according to Yahoo) several 'value' funds and institutions who are
in this stock. I don't know when they've bought (or if they are still in), but
it's likely, I will guess, that I am buying today at a price below which some
of them have bought their shares. It's my 'we're in it together' and 'misery
loves company' approach to investing. -g-

I'll put P on my watch list, American Spirit.

There seems to be a divergence of analysts' opinions on Phillips Petroleum,
according to what I read. Some say P overpaid for Tosco; plus, with this
pending acquisition they've suddenly and dramatically changed what they said
was their strategy. (They moved toward marketing/refining and away from their
E&P.) Others say that the acquisition will add balance to P and make them a
bigger player and better able to compete with the (other) majors. If I recall
correctly, the guy running Tosco is considered one fabulous businessman, and he
will be on the P BOD after the merger.

Anyway, I'm of the opinion that the stock is being held back by the flux the
merger is causing. I'll assume that the merger will be approved and completed.
P seems to have been a mediocre investment in the past. But with the merger
behind it (i.e. businesses integrated in a couple of years), and with the
synergy and strength which P could/might/maybe/should find from that merger,
and with gas/oil sustaining their high prices, I could see P achieve new highs.

I'm not sharp enough to do the numbers on P or it's competitors. I don't know
what P's important numbers are or where they stand or where they will be after
the merger. (These stocks trade on multiples of cash flow, do they not? Or
maybe on their reserves in the ground?)

American Spirit, you say you are waiting for the next fed cut to maybe buy P.
Are you expecting the price of P to go lower until then, or maybe you believe
the next rate cut (assuming there is one) will be a catalyst to propel the
stock from its current levels?

Anybody else here follow P or with an opinion on it to share?

I2, fwiw (not much), I've started a position today in ATO which I consider a
reasonable dividend play.

My plan is to keep the roughly 5.4% dividend yield while I wait for the company
and its stock to receive more investor attention.

A typical utility it seems. The dividend looks to be increasing every year
(It's now 13 consecutive), as does stock outstanding, accompanied by occasional
increases in ltd. Typical of capital intensive businesses. And their ROE is
lousy too. (Less now than their 10 year average, so MAYBE there's eventually
going to be some improvement.)

Revenues seem to be growing by acquisitions. At current price the p/bv,
p/sales, p/e seem to me to offer some hope that the stock could move up a bit
so that those ratios will be nearer the higher levels that they've seen in the
past. For example, while book value hasn't increased much over the years (as is
typical), the stock in several past years has traded at 2x bv. If that should
occur now again - that would make a $28 sh. price (up from $21 now).

ATO distributes natural gas to over one million customers in 11 states (they
say).

Natural gas business is 'sposed to be real profitable now. C'mon, ATO, release

rambling on about me and Computer Associates (CA):
Sunday's NY Times had a powerfully negative article on CA. Almost unfailingly
derogatory - or so it seemed to me as I read the article in horror and dread
(my being a small stockholder). Perhaps I've just filtered out any positives
that were there, but it seems unusual to me for the Times to slant the article
so strongly and use unnamed sources so frequently in doing such a story.

We maybe had a premonition of yesterday's article with Pete Kocmalski's
12/27/00 response here (to another negative media article on CA) where Pete
said, "...my experiences with the company dampen my enthusiasm for the stock a
bit."
(The Times article implied, imo, that an inordinate number people who work for
or deal with the company do not like CA.)

I state the former paragraphs as to explain my panic dumping of my small
position in the stock this morning. It's really about my fear and shame though.
I don't know enough to either refute or accept the NY Times article, so I
figure I don't know enough to be in the stock.

I'm out at $32.21 (stock is $31.77 down $3.55). My buys were at 26 and then 18
1/4 so it's been a profitable trade for me. But I feel now like I must not have

I sell in the downdraft. Disconcerting enough this am. to take away any of the

David, re: BL. I've started to reestablish my small position.

I've kept BL on my watch list, but missed an opportunity after I wavered when
it was under 17 recently. I'll start with some today though at $17.50; I'll
assume that if there's any random fluctuations with the stock, I'll be able to
get the bulk of my purchase at better prices. I just would rather be in now it
for a small amount than out of it totally.

Negatives with BL that I see are:

A business mainly of "fashion apparel for men and women" through catalog sales.
Fashion as determined by corporate headquarters in Warren, PA (-gg-). They say
they intend to increase revenues over this decade, but historically, revenues
seem stuck (flat) at 500M + or -. This stock was a Graham net-net when Jim
Clarke discussed it (if I recall correctly), but it is not now. And even if it
were, there'd be reasonable belief by many here that, because we're talking
clothing fashion and retail, for our net-net purposes any inventory $$ in
current assets really ought to be reduced substantially more than what BL
shows.

BL reported a net loss today. They may have additional problems and unexpected
costs in trying to integrate several new initiatives: improvements to their
order processes, consolidation of facilities, and outsourcing of some
activities.

OTOH, those flat revenues are revenues and the company can show profits from
their endeavors.
BL was the first catalog retailer and they're still around and still profitable
most recent years. Book value has increased over the past few years, there's
steady, small amounts of insider buying as you've said, no ltd, and 60c
dividend which provides a reasonable 3.3% yield.

I'll bet that the stock is closer to lows than to highs. When times are good
again, and people are optimistic about BL (if that is even possible -g-), then
I'd expect the stock to again be bid up to .85 or 1x book value. I'm assuming a
lousy year this year for BL's earnings, but I'd be looking for maybe 25.5 or
better on the stock sometime in 18 months when BL's big initiatives are better
understood and I hope, contributing to improved business results.

I was sitting forty feet away from Warren Buffett for six hours on Saturday. He
was asked if net-nets became available in a big way would he buy 20 of them in
Graham's diversified strategy. And if the size of Berkshire is the only reason
not to, would he do it with a smaller portfolio? Surprisingly, Graham's
greatest disciple said no he wouldn't, though he said one would almost
certainly make money if one did that strategy. But he wouldn't do so. Because
in an environment where there would be that many net-nets available, top
quality businesses would probably also be very cheap too and that is what he'd

I'd certainly agree with that.

The larger and more successful the company, the higher the premium you pay, as
compared to net current assets.

That's the way it is now, and I would imagine it will still be true if market
multiples were to fall a factor of two or more. You'll pay extra for the safe
companies that are big enough for institutions to buy.

BTW, if it's Bershire Hathaway's money, the sage seems to prefer leading

troubled companies. An example is the REIT that he picked for himself.
