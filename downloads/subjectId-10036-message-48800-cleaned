Hi Joan -

Thank you for your "real world" feedback on ADM. I just do not see how a
company can sell below it's TBV when providing these necessary and needed
service to our small farmers through out our nation. ADM seems to have a very
efficient logistics system in place that allows them to service even the
smaller locations and still make a profit.

What really gets me is when our Too-Big-To-Fail banks get all of our Federal
bail out money to support a lying money hungry bunch of cheating over paid
bankers but we seem to forget about all of our small hard working farmers that
are feeding the world and are actually producing something!

I am grateful I can invest in companies like ADM that through their
infrastructure support our local farming community and can efficiently move
their product to the market. Screw these big banks (many who will not provide
loans to our hard working & profitable farmers).

Thank you North Dakota and all of the other small farming towns that produce
real things... food . . . that we all need.

Now I want to buy even more ADM.

Joan, thanks for coming out of hibernation after almost 4 years without

towards ADM. You are right, the current problems will be a small blip in ADM's

For CMI, I've bought recently, and my rationale for buying is that I would be
getting a Greenblatt-like stock (high roe and low p/e), a company with low
debt:equity ratio, a company that had positive earnings each year in the past
ten, and a company that increased stated book value in nine of those past
years. And I am attracted to the company's potential, given Cummins strength in
diesels and possibilities with nat gas conversions.

On several other metrics, I find the company not to be a value stock for me: on
p/stated book value and on p/sales, for example. Current profit margin seems
unusually high: that does call into question for me the sustainability of those
high profits.

Regarding valuing cyclical companies, I look at each situation by itself, and I
have no typical method or rule that I apply specifically to cyclicals.

Thanks Paul & Jurgis. I figured it was a stretch to call it value but it does
have some great qualities as you have already alluded to.
I guess the easiest thing to do for companies things like this is to look at
all methods of averaging (ROIC, earnings and net margins) and pick whichever
looks more appropriate as Jurgis has mentioned.
And yes, Jurgis, you are right that FCF is a lot lower than earnings so I will
have to see what the true average owners earnings are.

Pref Stocks. Happy that I already bought most of the pref stocks that I need
when they were cheaper. Anyone noticed almost all are now selling at a premium
to par? Those that are redeemable at any time are selling at around $25.50
which is 2% over par. So some unlucky buyer could lose 2% overnight. Those pref
stocks that have a few years before their redemption date are selling for
around $26.50, and some over $27. wow! $27 is a 9% premium to par. So someone
could easily lose 9% if called in 4 years, or 2%+ a year. That would cut
STAG-A's effective yield from 8.3% to 6%.

Anyway, please take your money and run. Time for you to cash in and collect
your premiums over par. Let's get the prices back down to $25 or less so that I
can buy some more. Sell sell sell. Thank you.

Example -- these 4 are redeemable in 2016:
STAG-A pays 8.3% at $27. 9% premium
PEB-A pays 7.5% at $26.40. 5.6% premium
FUR-D pays 8.6% at 26.30. 5.2% premium
DFT-B pays 7.1% at 26.75 7% premium

http://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/STAG-PA,PEB-PA,FUR-PD,DFT-PB

....................

Here's a ridiculous one, that I don't own. CWHN. It is traded CWH debt that
pays 7.5% on $20 par. So at today's $22.68 price it pays 6.6%. But the $22.68
is a 13.4% premium over $20. It can be redeemed in 2014 and matures in 2019. So
a buyer today can get 6.6% for 2 years then have it called and lose 13.4%.
Pretty dumb. I betcha some idiots think the par value is the normal $25.

Honestly, I probably would not have bought KO at more than $30 or so in 1989. I
am looking for ~10% E/EV. Cash is almost equal to debt, so E/EV in this case is
equivalent to PE, which leads to ~$30 price at 355M shares outstanding and
1038M earnings. Interestingly enough KO's FCF is quite a bit lower than
earnings at ~800M in 1988. So even going with 15x FCF, I get only $34 as buy
price. IMHO, this is quite rich multiple, especially considering bond rates at
9% (as stated in the blog - I did not verify it).

I can't easily find KO price range for 1989. 1988 annual states that 1988
closing price is $44, so I assume I would not have bought KO then... :/

I could get this horribly wrong but let me give this a shot...
First let's arrive what a new owner might do:
Since Coke is already a cash generating machine it probably does not need the
cash on its books. Assume it needs 0.
Second, though the affiliates have synergies we can assume that they are
extraneous to the actual operations of Coke.
Assuming affiliates are sold and all the cash is used to pay off the debt and
reduce shareholder equity we can arrive at a new Shareholder equity of 2326.

Shareholder Equity 3345
Debt 2124
-Cash -1231
-Affiliates -1912
Final Shareholder Equity 2326
No debt

Note that the company earned operating income 1598 (excl equity and interest
income), using a tax rate of 35% and depreciation of 167, and actual capital
expenditure of 387 we can arrive at net owner earnings to assets of 819. That
would be a ROE of 35%. This is a very high unleveraged ROE number.

If I were to assume the new owner can earn 23% on Coke conservatively we can
arrive at the following analysis....
Assuming 355mil shares, the BVPS of 6.55.
If you apply CAGR of 23% for the BV for 10 years you will arrive at a BV of
51.9 at the end of 1998.
Assuming Coke still earns 23% it would earn 11.94 that year and if you apply a
15x multiplier you can see how Coke could be worth 179. (Buffett bot the shares
at avg price of 43.85 giving the magic CAGR of 15% which is the Buffett min
requirement for investments).

Obviously the 23% is the big if but without historical information on how much
Investments were in affiliates historically this will always be a question
mark. Does anyone have this data or know how to obtain it?

Add debt to this and you could juice the returns some more I guess.

Hi Grommit -

If you are selling some of these over priced preferreds then where are you
deploying the money? Are you looking at undervalued equities and/or other
equities that pay a reasonable dividend (ie. reits, utilities, or even T or VZ)
or just holding the cash (if so where?).

I have noticed the same thing in several of the preferreds I monitor and at
some point (like you stated) there is a significant risk of loss to par
especially if/when the paper is called. That's not to mention that any
liquidity event like 2008/2009 could also result in a significant loss.

I have been focused on finding those equities w/ little or no debt that
generate significant FCF. If they pay a dividend it's fine but for me it's the
company's general business that's important to me. If I can buy it at a bargain
price, that's a huge plus. I am also looking for companies that offer a safe
risk/reward profile and have a long term history (5 years or more) generating a
double digit ROE . GLW (ROE=11%) & ADM (5 yr avg ROE=12%) are two companies
that come to mind. Both are selling below their TBV. Maybe I can hide in
companies like these and earn an equivalent ROE on my investment. Both pay
dividends double that of my credit union.

I recently re-entered ADM as it is selling below it's TBV (they own a lot of
good assets that do not lose their value over night). ADM's 5yr ROA is almost
6%. That's a pretty solid return on those undervalued assets. VZ was another
quasi utility that I have added to but it's at the high end of my price range.

I am noticing many of my stocks on my Graham Number watch list are still
selling at a discount to that calculation but you have to be careful to look at
each specific business (is their a level of safety if the economy tanks).
Several of my utility stocks are getting to fair value levels. ATO is one that
is up over 10% in the last 45 days and I am looking to sell my high priced
shares (it is selling at or above it's GN value of $36.96/share and at a new
52wk high).

Otherwise, I have been accumulating cash and basically earning a negative
return. FWIW, I have been using a lot of that cash doing my remodel on a piece
of real estate I recently purchased (w/ all cash).

Some of that cash, I have been parking at my credit union (earning no more than
1% annual return) and w/ Vanguard GNMA but that too is at or near an all time
high and could lose significant value on any future interest rate increase.

Preffereds not selling at a premium to par (and reflect more risk) include:
GMXRp, GSTpA, NRFpB, FRpJ, FRpK. I own a little of all of these except NRFpB.
The FR series I originally bought below $10.00/share in the 2008-2009 crash and
have actually been selling some at current prices. MHRpD is also selling below
par (@ $50). My most recent preferred buy was your selection EXLpB but let some
shares go above $26 last week. I also have been looking to start a position in
EXL (a mini mall REIT located in So. CA) common but it is not as much of a
bargain since you first mentioned it.

Hello, waver99.

Oops, I inadvertently erased my considered (presumably) reply.

Here's a short redo

For both companies, the question for me for a buy is: How long do I expect to
be in these stocks?

I'll pass on TSN. Too iffy for me.

For SFD. For food companies -- big, established ones -- I like to see either
growth in book value or a "decent" dividend, preferably both. And I don't want
to pay more than 10x p/e. I don't get all that with SFD. SFD seems (to me) a
little more consistent than TSN, and I can run my numbers on it a little more
comfortably. I calculate for me, fair-value, my top buy-price, at stated bv
($21.50). With all the insider buying we see, clearly insiders believe or
believed the stock to be undervalued at today's $18.29. I say the risk/reward
favors a buy at current price, with a sell maybe at book value -- insider buys
give me some confidence that it might actually get there again. So for me,
question is, do I want to go for a 3 point gain, and how long would I be
willing to hold this stock to see it? (And this assumes the stock won't fall
further, and I thus won't have to make a decision if I want to add more, just
hold on, or give up.) Iffy for me. I'll pass for now, and continue to look
around for something with higher return possibilities and/or dividends while
waiting.

Just saying what I will do. You/others will make your decisions based on your
views/analyses/requirements..

(Aside: I hold SEB, so I am already somewhat at risk with pork producers.)

AFN.TO - the cash flows look pretty ugly. Most of the cash is spent on
acquisitions and dividend, so this spending can be stopped, but people would
not like the divvie cut. After Q1 they have zero cash and ~150M debt. I'd be
concerned that if Q2-Q3 don't go well, they will have either to borrow or to
dilute.

They did a lot of acquisitions in 2010 and 2011, but even with these
acquisitions the sales growth is very slow while the earnings are dropping -
and that's even before Q2-Q3.

Hi Jurgis

Re: AFN.TO

Here is the review I did on the company. http://goo.gl/EaQQn

I suspect they would cut their dividend before they did any dilution bit either
is possible. You are correct that they had quite a few acquisitions but most
(if not all) were accretive to earnings. My biggest concern is their large LT
debt to their annual net income which is at 6x. ADM LT Debt to annual Net
income is 8x. I prefer to see 4X or less.

Similar AG companies also sell closer to BV. AFN.TO is selling around 1.7x BV.
I do like their ROA and ROE returns and net profit margins of 8%. Quite a bit
higher than ADM.

I have read your writeup and actually looked at the company because of it.

I liked the folksy, straight-shooter 2011 Annual report, where they acknowledge
issues and pay homage to one of the founders who died recently.

However, I don't particularly like the rollup strategy that seems to be causing

may work out fine, but there is some risk if downturn hits and there is credit
freeze.

Jurgis - All good points. I too am a bit concerned w/ all that CF being paid
out but at least they are not exceeding their CF . . yet :). The prudent thing
for them to do is to cut their dividend and pay it quarterly rather than
monthly. I expected that with ERF and thought that their dividend cut was
factored into their stock price when I bought shares around $18.00/share. Then
ERF made their "expected" dividend cut and the stock dropped 25% to
$13.00/share.

I hope that is not the case w/ Ag Growth. ERF was borrowing their money to pay
the dividend too. This is not the case w/ Ag Growth.

I have some low ball orders in to buy more Ag Growth if that is the case (ie
cut dividend to preserve retained earnings and build up cash reserves). I also
expect a drop in U.S. and/or Canadian orders as a result of the drought.
Managers should see this as well as shareholders. But since the stock is so
thinly traded, one could see another price drop on such news which for me is
just another buying opportunity.

Thank's for your views. Still some pretty impressive ROE & ROA numbers for a
simple grain equipment manufacturer. Interesting that Ag Growth maintains the
same profit margin (ie 8%) as Deere & Company (DE) .

For me, it's definitely one to have a few shares in the portfolio to add to my
AG basket.

<blockquote> Edmond J. Pera, President and CEO of Armanino Foods, said,
<u>“International sales in the second quarter were especially strong

to remain healthy for the remainder of this year thanks to raw materials
pricing contracts that we have in place through the end of 2012. As usual, we
will closely monitor the outlook of our material costs so that we can manage
our margins appropriately. We currently do not have any plans to raise our
selling prices and plan to use this pricing strategy to try and increase our
market share. We continue to see a greater consumer awareness of pesto sauces
in the market place which in our opinion could lead to overall market
expansion.”</blockquote> The company keeps producing higher results every
quarter as they expand their operation throughout the U.S. and now
Internationally (in a limited approach) It's a slow and steady approach limited
to their plant capacity and not over promising product that can not be
delivered in quantity and quality.

Company seems to be changing its business strategy and/or focus. And struggling

Can you tell if it's a new buy or something they held a long time? I expect SEB
to be impacted on the drought especially their turkey & pork production units
as corn prices should shoot through the roof. I am not sure hoe much their
operation(s) is impacted by the midwest drought but if the stock sells off, I
want back in.

There should be other value opportunities from this drought event specifically
with corn and grain prices shooting through the roof. I doubt that has been
priced in the value added stocks yet but at some point when they do, we could
see some good values. Like everything, this drought will end and another bumper
harvest will just be around the corner.

I have been trying to put together a list of candidate stocks that could work
on the "drought" theme. Somebody on another thread said ethanol production will
dry up which may move oil prices higher. U.S. soybeans are also impacted and
their production will be way down too.

If you see any value ideas please post them.

One thing i was looking at is meat companies, people who are actually raising
animals, like PPC's of the world. You will see margin compression there.

On ethanol the govt. made a statement that they are not cutting down on the
ethanol quota yet. however, by some accounts the situation is pretty bad. I
would not focus so much on the oil aspect as that market is governed by lot of
other factors...

However, i will focus on companies that use corn for animal feed. In addition,
if there are cheap seed companies, thats another thing to look into for next
yr.....

For profit education company stock Apollo, APOL, keeps falling. In addition to
government investigations of the sector, and questions about future government
student funding, now there's a rumor that David Einhorn is shorting APOL.

I have a few losing shares, and I'll continue to hold for now. I see that DeVry
(DV) is also beat down. I now prefer this stock to APOL, and I've started
accumulating shares. Stock now at $28.19 with $5 per sh. in cash, and ltd of 0.
Stated bv has increased every year for the past ten. Stock trades at relatively
(to itself) low p/stated bv, low p/sales, relatively high profit margins
(relative to itself. (Question is. are they sustainable?), reasonably good roe
for the relatively low p/e (Greenblatt sort of). 1% div yield while waiting for
company's fortunes to improve. Which I'm assuming will happen.

EKS - here is something on the crop from I read and related to your earlier
question. another way to play the drought.

 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-19/crop-insurers-could-face-first-loss-s
nce-2002-on-drought.html The drought could cause crop insurers - such as Ace (
http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ace ), QBE (
http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/qbeif.pk ) and Wells Fargo (
http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/wfc ) - to suffer their first underwriting
losses in ten years. However, with the government providing subsidies and
reinsurance, taxpayers may have to foot 50%-80% of the bill. The severity of
the drought is
http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/20/us-commods-losses-hazard-idUSBRE86J04

than try to save their products."

Re JCI - ~10x earnings is still expensive for what is essentially an automobile
supplier, albeit one with better than average economics over time. I don't like
car suppliers very much and think they should trade at lower multiples than
other industrials.

Also, I noted that JCI's sharecount has increased over time, while most
industrials manage to reduce their outstanding shares, except when they do
larger acquisitions. It may be a stock that looks good to the dividend investor
crowd but not to me.

My experience/hearsay with the building management business is not the greatest

I was going to short my one chicken producer Cagle's Inc. (CAGAQ) but I noticed
they are already in BK.

This is one I have followed for years (over 10 years) and bought when grain
prices were at extreme lows. The larger chicken producers have already sold off
(like TYN) and are more diversified. Also the management now is more
sophisticated than Cagle's Inc. (CAGAQ) and use hedging strategies to reduce
their production losses.

I think the eventual play will be to buy those companies that have an extreme
sell off due to the uncertainty of the drought. It may tale 2-5 months for the
impact to be felt through the supply chain. At some point some of these
processors and/or value added suppliers might sell off to where there may be a
good value "buy" entry point.

No hurry but rather now is the time to build up your list of candidate stocks.
I was hoping that SEB would sell off but it may take several more months to
impact their turkey & pork production units in Colorado. Still, that may not
move the needle enough to impact the stock price. My buy in target price is
$1,700.00/share.

Hi Nik. The U.S. planted a record amount of corn this year. It was expected
that we would have a record crop but now estimates call for the lowest amount
of corn in five years, down just 7% from the initial projection.

I think that the corn play has been overdone and profit taking should kick in.
Anyway, this is not a long term play. Just my opinion, of course.

Take a look at the chart for CORN. Then take a look at the chart for JO
(coffee) and BAL (cotton). Trends change very quickly for commodities. Remember
one of your recent stock picks cited higher cotton prices impacting negatively
on their bottom line? I think that was in their last q, but look at cotton
prices now, reduced by about half.

The 7% revision just seems to be an adjustment relative to the USDA estimates

JCI. Yes, p/e looks high to me also. JCI though seems to me to be one of those
companies that trades in its own p/e range year-after-year -- a range that's
different and higher from its peers. I've been looking -- unsuccessfully -- to
show that therefore the p/e will revert to a "normal" p/e that it's had in the
past. Because JCI business is cyclical (earnings drop makes p/e higher), I
can't justify it historically. It's a significant item for me though, because
if earnings do fall, it'll be the corresponding stock fall that's ultimately
important, not that the p/e reverts. And with JCI, I ask myself also, okay this
company has a lot of followers on Wall Street, and a lot of good history
(historical performance) behind it, but given that the p/e seems to me to stay
relatively high (compared to auto supplier peer stocks, e.g. perhaps TRW) just
how long can this company keep its p/e so much higher than these others?

Anyway, just small tracking position for me here.

got a sense that Aug end/Sept might be very volatile. people will cover their
shorts and sit on the sidelines. 3Q may open up some good opportunities to buy
stocks for long term. There is a strong change of another downleg in the
market. Market has been holding pretty well on low volumnes (not good). Market
comps for companies have not been good. Only 43% beat estimates and comps are
going to come down.

And...Segio you and SLM! Fine fine. i will take one look at it this weekend:)

Nik, shorts are at record levels. So, when they're covered the market will
rally. I saw consumer confidence in the stock market is also low. This is also
a market positive signal.

After the rally, when investors sit on the sidelines stocks will go down again.

So, we go up, down and around.... but this is a good time to buy stocks with
the largest short positions for short term money and buy solid stocks to ride
out the volatility for longer term plays.

SLM, unless college financing system is changed....its a money machine.

large caps as well as medium cap companies are at or near lows. Who knows when
(and in some cases if) the shorts will cover.....and there are enough triggers
and ways to hide the covering.....in other words....not so sure about a broad
rallye at some point. In my own opinion.....more or less a companie centric
rallye.

But what do I know.

In the worst case scenario....the markets may take a lifetime to recover due to

Re SFD - this stock looks like a decent value to me. I checked in thwir latest
10-k and they hedge exposure to corn prices, product (hog)prices and energy
cost.

Exerpt from 10-k means that they should show a ~50M$ gain for a 10% increase in
feedstock prices. This looks like the impact of higher corn prices should be
buffered.

mostly in Skandinavia, Russian and some other countries).. Besides the food and
consumer staples division, they own a stake in a pretty well run chemical and
paint company an Al profile manufacturer which is profit margin challenged a
heat exchanger manufacturer and an assortment of other stiff. The stock was
discussed a few years ago in Dale's 50% Gains thread. This company has become
more conservative and i figure if they divest the non-profitable operations,
they would be debt free food and consumer staples company with an ~10x PE.
Seems cheap to me.

ABB @ 15.7$, starter position. Discussed in this thread many times before. Good
balance sheet (essentially debt free), but recent results were not that great
mostly due to margin compression in Chine. PE<10x.

C @25.25$. Cheap financial, trading at 0.5x tangible book. Cheap but so so
management.

I almost bit at some ABB but will wait as I believe it will sell off along with
the rest of the market. It is a value at current levels (even w/ their recent
diluted acquisition). For now, it is more emotional & fear that I am moving on
rather than true value. Good buy hope I can follow you in on that one.

FWIW I would never touch any of the too big banks as I believe they are "black
boxes" and too hard for me to evaluate based on their 10K reports. Their
reported TBV and/or assets are not accurate IMO and many of the off balance
sheet items (including derivatives) are not accounted for including their mark
to market loans (just ask Mad Harry about the derivative accounting). How do
you quantify their exposure to Spain and Italy.

I may be bias as I believe all the European Banks are bankrupt:

I don't think the European banks are all bankrupt, but many have liquidity
problems, especially those in PIG countries. Since the PIG banks have the same
currency, interest rates but less security than let's say German banks, there
is no reason to keep deposits there. Also, many European banks are low on
capital and maybe even more importantly, starved for deposits. Their
outstanding loans exceed their deposits by a considerable amount. This is true
not just for PIG banks, but also for many French and British banks. They need
to shrink, since it is unlikely that they can build up their deposits to match
the loan volume, much less all that trading liquidity. So I agree with you to
avoid European banks (at least most of them).

US banks are in a much better situation. The FED has them in their crosshairs
since 2008, so I don't think that there is too much funky stuff going on in
their balance sheets. The FED published a stress test published this year, that
generally had favorable results, even for Citigroup. That stress test assumed a
2008/2009 style recession starting in 2012 and looked at how the bank woud
perform. All banks would have survived this, even BAC, with a sufficent capital
buffer. C is very cheap if you assume that assets are marked correctly. C has
~5b$in annual expenses from the bad bank (Citiholding) that is in runoff mode.
Once it is gone, the expenses are gone too and capital trapped there can be
used, hopefully for more productive uses.

The international focus on emerging consumer market banking is another plus for
C (while not without risks). They do need a stronger management team to take
advantage of their assets,the current management does a decent job fixing
issues, but I don't think that they are really bankers. In any case, growth is
not build in C's valuation.

Might be just a trade after all, a little bit of a better mood in the financial
markets should easily bring this to 30$+.

 Re HPQ - I the problem with HPQ is which metrics to use. It is cheap based on
last years metrics and maybe on this years metrics but I have no confidence in
next years estimates, hence my conclusion that HPQ is not a value stock ( for
me)- it's a turnaround play, as far as I am concerned (maybe an OK one). I
don't even think it's sure thing that HPQ is still around in 5 years. 

I work for a company that is a direct competitor of several divisions of HPQ.
The big difference between the two is my company shed most of it's low margin
product lines when the economy was good and now concentrates on higher margin
products. (Enterprise software, high end Unix systems, etc..) I can't see HP
improving their rapidly compressing margins absent a new winning product line.
The server division is making them decent money but I see their laptop/desktop
division as being an anchor.

I think an interesting play (as I discovered that Canon makes the print engine
for many of HPQ's printers..I look inot the former...) is CAJ. Granted they are
facing similar problems to HPQ (Printer business.. rapidly shrinking market for
point and shoot cameras...) but they have a decent amount of cash and have room
to cut costs. (The majority of their production is still in Japan..) As of
today's close they are paying a 4% but it is probably too early to enter a
position.

Thanks Clown, Paul for the replies.

Checking the corn price charts, I notice that corn is already at multi-year
highs, am not sure how much higher it will go.

Based on my calculation, and taking into account a 10% increase in corn prices,
i.e. a $50mil hit to pre-tax earnings,

SFD EV/EBIT would be 7.06,

Earnings power value = $35 per share

at 20% increase in corn prices,

EV/EBIT would be 7.62.

Earnings power value = $33 per share

This implies a significant margin of safety, though I am not sure if my
calculations are 100% accurate.

P.S. Enterprise value I calculated at roughly 4.75 billion

P.P.S. EPV is a concept I learnt reading Applied Value Investing, and hope to
get your thoughts on the valutation models explained

Currently PBR pays a dividend of 5.09% with a low payout ratio of just 36.24%.

Compared to other Big Oil companies like Exxon Mobil ( XOM , quote ) -- which
only yields 2.65% -- this is a substantially richer incentive for those willing
to hang onto Petrobras shares while oil markets recover.

The relatively low payout ratio means that there is ample cash flow so that
dividend growth is in the future for its shareholders.

For value investors, this dividend-paying stock is very attractive with a
price-to-book ratio of just 0.69 and a price-to-sales ratio of only 0.85. On a
quarterly basis, sales growth is up by 14.75%. The profit margin is solid at
12.35% compared to XOM and its profit margin of 8.28%.

Now trading around $19.60, the mean analyst target price on this
dividend-paying stock over the next year is $32.92. With oil demand back on the
rise in emerging market nations such as China, India and South Korea in
addition to the domestic consumption in Brazil, Petrobras shares will rebound
sooner or later.

If you are using the valuation model and find it helpful, then that's well and
good.

The valuation model here for SFD makes me uncomfortable/nervous though the way
I see it. SFD is processed and package meats. Not a business with a lot of
pizazz or technology changes. Not a great growth business -- rather a business
that plods along. <u>Maybe</u> a "fairly easy" business to understand and
perhaps value. (If I understand the business and SFD correctly -- and I'm not
saying I do.) So my expectation is that over many years of people looking at
and valuing the company, somewhere along the line over several business cycles,
there've been enough people buying and selling the stock to where at least fair
value price has been achieved, if even for a while. It thus becomes very
difficult for me to see how SFD at $18.25/sh can be valued at $33-35/sh. The
stock has rarely reached that valuation number:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=SFD&t=my&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=
I'm just saying when there's that much difference between the current price and
the model's valuation price for an old line stock like SFD, it seems to me to
be an exaggeration. SFD could be one of those stocks where if the valuation is
$33-35, I'd be with the guys who want to see a catalyst, before I'd expect the
stock to hit those numbers.

I'm not saying here the stock is not undervalued. It may well be, and be a good
buy. After all, if someone bought at $18 and the stock rose even again to
$23-$25, that could still be a good gain.

<<Currently PBR pays a dividend of 5.09% with a low payout ratio of just
36.24%.>.

really? i am way underwater on some options i bought some time ago and do not
follow very closely, but i was surprised by this. i went to yahoo (i know, not
a very reliable source) for the dividend history, and still scratching my head.
now if one takes the most recent dividend and assumes that is a quarterly
dividend, i can see where you might get something around 5%. but i am pretty
sure they do not pay dividends at that level quarterly. looks to me like once a
year, and not a lot of stability as to the converted amount (but maybe that is
just currency fluctuation).

re PBR - i am not interested in PBR at this time. The reason is simple, they
are sitting on a lot of oil, but it's going to be expensive to get it out. Some
estimate 20$/brl exploration and development cost and then one needs to add
some lifting costs and taxes etc. They need to borrow money to do it.

There are quite a few oil stocks out there, that have proved reserves in the
ground valued at less than 15$/brl. Examples are HES, TOT and E. TOT and E pay
an even richer dividend than PBR and I do not see the risk that i see with PBR.
For me at least, buying proved reserves at 15$/brl (or less) is better than
buying unproved reserves that cost more than 20$/brl (my assumption, correct me
if I am wrong) and that is why I am not interested in PBR.

i do want to point out that E and TOT are located in Europe but i do not think
it matters much. Their reserves are all over in the world, so they are only
affected by the Euro mess with their local operations (refinery, chemistry ops
etc.) Those only constitute probably less than 25% of their NAV and earnings,
so the impact on the Euro issues is that not that;. And if the crude price
falls because of the Euro issues, it will affect every integrated oil company
(including PBR), not just the European ones.

Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE)-
Peeled off a few of my high priced shares (about 15% of shares) Still a top 10
position in the portfolio
Armanino Foods of Distinction Inc. (Other OTC: AMNF)
Sold 2.5% of higher priced shares but have a standing order in to sell up to
20% at current prices.

http://goo.gl/nYs7t

Booked some PFE profit as it hit near it's EKS$ value of $23.50/share. This is
a hard one to determine fair value as their TBV is negative because of
acquisitions. But using BV $11.11 and EPS of $2.21 my EKS$ is $23.50. Stock is
near it's 52wk high too of $23.87.

AMNF continues to be a good hold. They have paid a quarterly dividend for over
10 year of around 5%. Company continues to post higher revenues w/ last quarter
exceeding all record sales. This is my first small sale since my first buy in
10/2011 at $0.64/share. I sold some of my high priced shares that allowed me to
book a small profit.

I am a net seller for most of my stocks as I see world economies contracting.
There are still special "value" situations but I have to have some very
compelling arguments for me to commit new monies at this time. GLW, ABB and MHR
are near my buy targets but for me, no hurry to accumulate more shares and/or
start a tracking position (in ABB) at this time.

MAUXF: If the dividends that are planned (.05/quarter) actually occur as I
presume, and if the country risk doesn't tank the stock, then in my view the
yield provides a margin of safety with MAUXF at $1.34/sh. I've upped my
position now a little more.

Although, if I have to qualify a margin-of-safety with a number of "ifs", then
maybe a margin-of-safety doesn't really exist to the extent I would like to
believe.

Yes and these are two of them reaching new 52wk highs. That's what makes the
sell decisions so difficult. Buying value is pretty easy but knowing when to
sell (or at least peel off some shares) is the hard part.

My two sales today also reflect 30 or more month holds from my earlier
purchases. This meets my objective of keeping my turnover ratio to 36 months or
less.

FWIW I am looking for $SPX 1265 or about another 650 DOW pts lower as a first

The market has continued to move sideways despite twists and turns since the
beginning of this year.
Moving averages are now converging.

What does this mean? Short term and long term support for stocks is under
pressure. So, how the market handles this test is a big deal.

I think that despite all of the negative hoopla including Apple's miss and
Europe's woes that our market will hold up. I'm concentrating on stocks that
the market has ignored. Stocks that are able to dictate their own direction at
this time. Stocks that offer value just on the basis that our market will hold
up.

I agree with your hold strategy while shedding weak positions and taking profit
in long term holds. When to sell? I would say that selling to take long term
profit in the defensive sectors, like pharmaceuticals and utilities, that have
reaped the most benefit out of market volatility makes sense. Holding stocks in
your porfolio with a profit in negative performance sectors or stocks that are
leading their sectors also makes sense.

Re C or BAC - right now I prefer C over BAC, because I believe that C is
further along to fix the outstanding issues (mortgage warranties etc), due to
lesser exposure. i think C has less tail risk and similar upside than BAC,
which makes it a better deal. BAC has a more focused business and I prefer BAC
CEO over C.

With the recent strength in housing, and due to my believe that the string of
issues and the cost associated with them is going to wind down in 2013 at
latest, i think there is a clear path to better profitability and probably a
dividend. I think C is going to get there head if BAC. i could be wrong of
course and new issues could crop up, as it has been the casefor a couple of
years already (Libor being one of them).

Just to put the number into perspective, Citi Holding (the bad bank) has been
loosing ~920M$ last quarter or 32c/ share. If this loss goes away ( and it will
because the assets in Citi Holding are rapidly shrinking) and the capital
trapped is deployed, C should earn 5.5$/share rather than the roughly ~4$ now.
There nothing else neded to get there, not a better economy, or higher interest
rates, or pickup in investment banking, it just a matter of bad assets running
off.
