MSFT: 11/13/05 Barrons excerpt
(http://online.barrons.com/article/SB113175482864995376.html):
WHYMAN ASSERTS THAT MUCH of what has become the popular wisdom about Microsoft
is inaccurate. "There are three big Microsoft myths," he says. "One is that it
is just a PC-software company. The facts show that isn't true," with 40% of
revenue now coming from outside the core Windows and Office franchises. "The
second is that Linux will kill Microsoft. Linux has gone nowhere on the
desktop, and on the server is growing at the expense of Unix, not Windows. And
the third is the Google myth -- it competes with just 3% of Microsoft's
revenues." And now, he adds, Microsoft is set up for its biggest product cycle
in a decade. And that's no myth.<End quote>
MSFT will also benefit from Anti-piracy initiatives which could boost earnings
by increasing the amount of software that's paid for - 25% of Windows in US and
36% worldwide isn't paid for...a $39B untapped stream which, if converted to
revenues, would be nearly pure profit....and that's just Windows...Office, etc
would increase that potential. No way they'll get ever get 100% of that, but
they could get a chunk as they gradually tighten down.

Also, MSFT has shown willingness to return a generous portion of it's enormous
cashflow to shareholders thru buybacks and dividends instead of stupid
acquisitions and diWORSifications [Peter Lynch word coinage for getting into
unrelated businesses].

Hi Paul - The GP offer was interesting as the buyer had already picked up a few
of their pulp mills earlier. Kotch is a conglomerate that holds a lot of
natural resource and manufacturing companies. This purchase allows them to sell
their products directly to the consumer as well as getting a lot of very good
assets.

I hope I will see the same type of situation when Albertsons announces the
final bidder(s) for their properties. I have a lot more of this one and have
waited over three years for the value to be reflected in the stock price. My
fair value target is between $32-$36 per share.

Based on last weeks recent buy out offer for Linens & Things, I am optimistic
for ABS to receive a higher offer than the market expects. The ABS real estate
is far more valuable not to mention the value in their drug stores Savon &
Osco.

Fwiw, I'll stop adding to my small position in Toyota at this point and instead
begin building up stub position in auto retailer SAH.

I like p/sales number, price/stated book (1.1), the small dividend yield,
forward p/e. D/e is high though. (which is typical for these companies
apparently)

I view TM as a possible Japanese growth stock and SAH as somewhat more value

half of IP's market cap, and they are easy to sell, since demand for timber

This_is_the_end. College-housing REITS. Looks like you were right and I was
very wrong about my pick of EDR:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=EDR&t=6m&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=acc

EDR not doing well at all. Perhaps they've been too aggressive in expanding -
overpaying and overextending themselves. This particular sector of the reit
world is fairly new, so maybe management is trying to achieve some sort of
first-mover advantage.

The annualized dividend might be about $1.20. If that is the dividend they'll
pay out over the year, and IF that dividend isn't cut (which it could be), then
the stock at about $12.70 is possibly near a low. The stock's slightly below
book value (Yahoo figure), which I presume is overstated given the company's
likely buying of units at full market price or higher. I'll up my small
position a bit here on belief the business is viable (i.e. growing) and that
there's value to the company's assets.

Just a very small bet. My much bigger position in the sector will remain GCT.

I still have a few shares. Odd name change - harkens to its roots, but doesn't
simplify things for US investors coming across this stock.

Also, I've reclassified this stock in my portfolio. Even with my weak dd, I
would've assumed I at least got their major business right. Apparently not.

Here's how Yahoo describes/described their business (and which they categorize
under "financial" "investment brokerage"):

"MFC Bancorp, Ltd. and its subsidiaries operate in the financial services
market, primarily in Switzerland, Germany, North America, and Asia. The
company’s principal activities focus on merchant banking, including financial
advisory services, proprietary investing, and trading activities. Its banking,
finance, and advisory activities are conducted through its wholly owned
subsidiary, MFC Merchant Bank S.A. The trading of commodities and natural
resources activities, conducted through the company’s subsidiary, MFC
Commodities GmbH, include purchasing, selling, and product swaps of commodities
and natural resources. The company serves small to midsize public or private
companies from a range of industries and profiles."

Here's how the company describes its business though:

"KHD Humboldt Wedag International Ltd. (formerly: MFC Bancorp Ltd.) ("KHD"), is
a world leader in supplying proprietary technologies, equipment and
engineering/design services for cement, coal and minerals processing. KHD
through its subsidiaries offers their clients all over the world engineering
services, machinery, plant and processes as well as process automation,
installation and commissioning. The services include staff training as well as
pre- and after-sales services through to feasibility studies and financing
concepts. This array of supplies and services includes, in particular, the
modernization of existing facilities for capacity increases and, for reducing
the specific energy demand and the burden on the environment.
KHD's largest subsidiary KHD Humboldt Wedag GmbH ("Humboldt") founded in 1856,
designs and builds plants that produce and/or process cement, beneficiated
coal, clinker, base metals and precious minerals. The Company has more than 900
employees worldwide, and has operations in India, China, Russia, the Middle
East, Australia, Africa and the United States."

Before the change, MFC distributed to shareholders shares of its holdings in
Blue Earth Refineries. A cigar butt African cobalt mine. Unfortunately for me,
I upped my few shares a little, and I'm underwater on these holdings.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=t&s=BUERF.PK

Given the sector KHDH seems to be in, I suspect there'll be new customer orders
for KHDH services, and the stock could do okay going forward. I am considering
adding to my few shares.

KHDH,

I own some. They have a great track record, but are kinda sleazy. For that
reason, I own some, but haven't backed up the truck for them.

I have owned one of the stocks they manage IJX --> CMQ. They have managed to
destroy some value there (which pocketing handsome fees), but the jury is still
out on that one. By the way, LTCM had a great track record until it blew up ---
just a word of caution on historical performance.

I checked with my one of Canadian experts about EDV.to. He loves miners and
energy trusts, but wouldn't touch this because it is a black box operation.
According to him, you really don't know the value of what they own. It could be
an awesome outfit, but who knows. The last black box outfit he owned was Enron,
so he is hesitant to buy.

Good luck,

I would love to hear more specifics about KHDH sleaziness. From what I can
gather management interest seem pretty well aligned with shareholders. The
interesting thing about the company is how difficult it is to understand
exactly what they do. I wasnt smart enough but I read an interesting analysis
somewhere on the internet and then went and read the sec reporting as well as
the last two annual reports and I was impressed. I think they have found an
interesting way to invest in and then service both India and China which to me
looks like the global future. I see the company as a budding international
Berkshire. I like the fact that they have a small board of directors. But guys
who look like they can help them get business, and also the guy who is in
charge of their eye centers in China, unlike some of my biotech investments
where they have 12 guys on the board plus a scientific advisory board but are
not making any money.
Now this is pure speculation on my part, but I envision that eventually they
will continue to reorganize and spin off different assets of the company. They
have the eye centers in China, they have a royalty stream from an iron mine,
and then they have their niche banking business, did i mention they own a swiss
bank?
Although I agree with your friend that EDV is a black box they do provide an
unaudited nav monthly and a certified one annually. they also report on many of
their purchases though not of course on their sales.

Enron was a fraud. I havent seen any evidence so far that these guys have done
anything improper. My hope is that as edv increases their book value they will
be increasing their dividend that should boost the price of the stock. Of
course if gold goes up sharply-the junior golds go up higher, then the warrants
that the company has a pile of get into the money and its a cinderella story

Madharry,

This came up when I first owned IJX, which is now CMQ. Several posters on the
IJX Yahoo board talked about how KHDH would take over microcap stocks and
extract value out of them, sometimes to the detriment of the shareholders of
those microcap companies.

Same thing is happening now with CMQ. Look through the filings and press
releases for CMQ. KHDH took over a company with lots of cash. They have done
some interesting deals --- rights to build wind farms in china and acquiring a
metal business in Germany (and also some self dealing). However, the CMQ stock
price is way down from the cash levels implying the KHDH management has
destroyed value so far. I was happy for them to get involved first, as I sold
on the initial pop when they took over. But now things aren't looking so hot.

Anyway, the way they manage these firms seems, shall we say, extremely
aggressive. I don't feel like I have Uncle Warren managing my company. They do
seem very bright, and I do have an investment in both CMQ (very small) and KHDH
(larger), but I don't intend to have a large position in either.

Well Suma, seeing as you directed your post to me, let me make the following
comments ....
In my opinion it’s an unfortunate fact of the Market that, IN THE SHORT TERM,
there are those who will slavishly follow the recommendations of the likes of
Kramer, Analysts, Market Commentators etc.., probably because they cannot
adequately analyse the financial fundamentals of a company for themselves. This
is not to say that Kramer et al are always wrong, but by the same token they
may not always be right either. But what one can generally rely on, is the fact
that, in the medium to long term, a stock’s price performance will reflect the
Quality of its underlying fundamentals. Therefore if one can determine that
Quality for oneself, then shouldn’t one then base one’s investment decisions on
that assessment, even if it’s at odds with Kramer et al ?
In this regard I can quote the following recommendation, which is one of 12
that my friend and colleague, Dr. Karl Posel, suggests one refers to before
investing in a stock ...
"Realise that the market price of a share can move in an illogical manner. Have
the confidence of your calculations to make the most of such a situation, once
again realizing that logic must, and will, ultimately return to the market."
With regard to the stocks you mentioned, my personal opinions are ....
PFE :- I have to agree, in part, with Kramer. Several of its recent Quarterlies
look poor. It’s also not earning that much with available capital. Considering
its high margin you’d think it would be doing better.
TGT :- Too much debt. Also not earning that much with available capital.
ANF :- Fundamentally, it looks the best of the bunch to me. Nice return on
capital, good margin, no debt.
PSUN :- Similar fundamentals to ANF, except lower return.
GPS :- Not as good as ANF or PSUN, in my opinion.
Something to maybe bear in mind is that the last three stocks are in the
apparel business. Up till now money has been fairly cheap in the USA, with
folks spending freely on their credit cards etc..
However, interest rates have been going up and personnel spending is likely to
be curtailed. This could result in Revenues declining for ANF, PSUN and GPS. So
investing in retail stocks may not be a good idea for the longer term.

Hi there SUMA. Thanx for your reply and the nature of its contents. As I cannot
reply to that message (I'm not a subscriber), may I suggest you contact me at
bruwin99@yahoo.com. You may want to obtain a Hotmail or Yahoo e-mail address
for this form of communication.
With regard to VZ, I'm afraid I cannot share your view on this stock. For one
thing ... according to its last Annual Result, VZ's very large debt cost it
over $2.3bil. in pre-tax interest expense. This represents about 30% of VZ's
Net Annual Income of $7.8bil. At VZ's current tax rate of about 23%, that's an
after tax expense of $1.83bil. One hopes VZ is putting that borrowed money to
good use. If they're not, shareholders are losing about 66c/share on the Bottom
Line.
In addition, VZ has been paying about $1.54/share in dividends. If we take VZ’s
current DPS/EPS ratio of 154/283 and multiply that by 66c, then shareholders
would get an extra 154/283x66c = 36c/share, or 23% more, in their dividend
cheque. If VZ reduced that debt by, say, 50% then shareholders would at least
benefit by an extra 12% dividend payment, or thereabouts.
In VZ’s defence, their EPS of $2.83 for year ending 2004/12 was a lot higher
than $1.11 for the previous period. However, their last few Quarterly results
have been rather flat, without much EPS growth.
In addition, interest rates in the USA are still likely to rise, so that debt
expense probably won't be getting any less.

with GM stressing there will be no bankruptcy, and with car sales seen
rebounding in Nov, we could have a decent bounce.

Book value on F is 7+, so I felt fairly comfortable buying where we did- As

drive its price up to wherever ! As is often the case, logic will ultimately
prevail.
In my opinion, the price of WIRE could very well depend on the ongoing demand
and price of copper, and at the moment that seems Up.

Encouraging words for Hancock ?! What can one say when you see Annual Bottom
Line falling, Quarterly Turnovers dropping off, Long Term Debt climbing every 3
months etcc... And all of that reflected in its price which is down about 70%
in the last 12 months. Due to rising interest rates and accumulated credit card
debt, personal spending on clothing and similar is likely to fall somewhat.

David, not comfortable with the stats that you provided at all. F looked to be
painted with the same short term brush as GM last week. Also the general market
has been strong so trading F in the short term seemed reasonable. I was just
thanking ionesco for the heads up. F will be gone very soon from my portfolio
and replaced with additional Natural Gas Stocks. I am finding compelling value
in several NG and energy stocks. Although the value I find in NG stocks is more
of a GARP value than "value investing" value.

From the NRS board, thought this interesting:

Cold snap prompts surge in gas price
By Thomas Catan
Published: November 17 2005 21:23 | Last updated: November 17 2005 21:23

Wholesale gas prices have almost doubled in the past week, with the cold snap
stoking fears about Britain’s gas supply this winter.

ADVERTISEMENT

Gas for delivery the next day touched 80p a therm yesterday – up from about 43p
a week ago – before dropping back slightly. It was the highest price in eight
months.

Niall Trimble, chief executive of the Energy Contract Company, a consultancy,
said: “It’s the cold weather so early in the winter. There are fears among
traders that we’re going to run short in a cold winter.”

For traders already concerned about the tight gas supply this winter, there
have been several ominous signs this week.

Operators have begun to draw gas from the country’s largest store – a highly
unusual event so early in the year. The Rough offshore storage facility is
normally filled at this time for use in January and February, traditionally the
coldest months.

Shipments of liquefied natural gas bound for Britain have also been diverted to
the US and Spain over the past six weeks, where they have been fetching a
higher price. A new import terminal at the Isle of Grain in Kent is thought to
have been idle since early October.

According to Frank Harris, a gas analyst at Wood Mackenzie, operators could
have made up to $14m more per cargo by selling it to the US rather than the UK
over the past couple of months. Rising UK prices should now help attract LNG
shipments to Britain, he said. However, the onset of winter in Japan raised the
prospect that they could be lured to Asia instead.

Finally, a reversible gas pipeline between Bacton and Zeebrugge has been
operating at less than half its capacity, despite soaring UK prices. Compressor
problems in Germany are thought to have been partly responsible for the lack of
gas flowing from the Continent. But many UK buyers also suspect that
continental European operators are holding back gas supplies.

Centrica, the country’s largest wholesale gas buyer, said: “We’ve certainly
been concerned at the high prices since the weekend and of limited gas coming
through the interconnector despite positive price signals. We’ll be keeping a
firm eye on whether?.?.?.?the lack of a functioning market in Europe has
impeded gas being sent to this country.”

The European Commission said this week that European gas and electricity
markets were “malfunctioning” because of the influence of dominant gas
companies, which hinder competition.

If the UK suffers an unusually cold winter, the operator of the gas pipeline
network has said that some heavy industrial users and power plants may have to
be cut off. The Met Office has said there is a 65 per cent chance of a
colder-than-average winter, something not experienced in a decade.

Britain is having to import an increasing amount of natural gas, as its own
supplies from the North Sea dwindle and demand keeps on rising.

Several new pipelines and LNG terminals are under construction to bring more
gas to Britain but they will not be ready in time to prevent the gas supply
this winter and next from being among the tightest in living memory.

I might look closer at GWR: The stock's at $33.81. Yahoo says they have $335M
in total debt, and $236M in free cash flow. Even for a capital intensive
business, that's a lot of free cash flow for each of those 27M outstanding
shares and "only" a $33.91 stock price - if the fcf number is right, if it's
sustainable, and if I understand free cash flow correctly (which might not be
the case).

I'll join you, gcrispin, with a buy of a few shares of KND.

Decent roe with not a lot of debt.

Reimbursements dependent on government funds are always iffy, and could tank
stocks in the sector if feds make significant policy (funding)changes. This has
happened in past and has not been pleasant for stockholders of these issues. So
I'm wary here too.

Fwiw, my understanding about the large cash component of these businesses is
that these monies are needed and used to reimburse physicians for their
services which the hospitals have billed to patients or their insurance
providers. In other words, a lot of that cash isn't available for share
buybacks/dividends, etc. OTOH, from what you report, KND has been profitable
enough and able enough to pay down lots of debt over the past four years - a
good sign, imo.

FSP continues to do well.

I finally listened to the conference call.

They have NEVER lowered their dividend in the companies history and they dont
take increases or decreases lightly.

The clear impression I got was our 31 cents per quarter is VERY secure and any
future increases would be secure also.

They were in a blackout as of the call but said they expected to be buying back
stock for the company as soon as they could.

Also mentioned some conference in Chicago where he said he looked forward to
meeting some of the folks on the call.

The stock is $18.50 right now with volume near 400,000.

Only problem with the increased price is the dividend yield is
lower...currently 6.67%.

Hmmm. And now you want to buy WWAT and TIVO? Hmm.

inexplicably occasionally attracted to very low-class women.

At least with stocks, if the wife finds out, she might only feel some

heads wagging, and there'll certainly be some question as to your mental

Well! If you're like me, and a member of the "I want it now!" generation,
resistance is near futile. You have to be in to win! These stocks could
recover! The odds might not be in your favor, but what if WWAT goes up 10-20-30

However, it most likely won't. Try and forgetaboutit. There is a 12-step

And please, oh please, before you turn to the next patient, hear me out on
Tivo. Yes, I know that all the advertising demons are alligned against TIVO for
making it possible to exterminate commercials with the flick of a button while
watching your favorite TV shows when it is most convenient for you and all the
media guys from DirectTV to Rupert Murdoch are out to destroy TIVO by stealing
the technology and making their own DVRs. But TIVO has just announced a plan to
enable you to easily download your favorite shows onto a video Ipod. Now,
watching TV on a 2 or 3 inch screen is not exactly my idea of fun either, but
I've learned that we all live in a world of second-best. Like my wife who
nurses a baby at night while watching ER with the sound on mute reading the
subtitles. I asked her last night, "Isn't that a bit distracting? Doesn't that
take all the fun out of watching TV?" She replied, "Sure, a little bit, but I
can't have the sound on if I want the baby to fall asleep and it's really not
too hard to follow the show." I hear that although the video may be tiny, the
sound quality is first class, so why shouldn't the video iPod be TIVO's
platform ticket to success? The legal gods are smiling from a Fair Use
perspective. And even the advertising guys should be appeased by Tivo's plan to
include all commercials. Hasn't every company the iPod touched turned to gold,
at least for a millisecond?

I know, it's just the financials to you guys. Isn't it enough though in a
nation of time-pressed TV addicts to invent a product that makes watching TV
interesting and convenient? Where is it written that these guys will never make

re TYC, VOD: Buffet's TYC buy makes a lot of sense to me. The main attraction
to TYC is the free cash flow (or owner earnings) which has been exceeding net
earnings for a few years already. The FCF is exceeding 2$/share for a FCF yield
of around 7%. if management can keep this up and add a little bit growth to
this equation, we have a seriously undervalued stock. With zero growth, TYC is
worth around 28-30$, so there is very little downside.

VOD is also interesting based on the FCF yield. Revenue growth is in the high
single digits, with a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. FCF yield
is around 7%. Dividend yield is 3.5%. Downside is slowing growth, problems in
Japan and increasing investments in 3G, which will reduce FCF somewhat. I think
VOD's valuation is attractive and bought a 1/3 position today.

In August it split 2:1. I see it's now trading at $74.12, which is up about 54%
in 4 months from its pre-split of about $48.
My guess is that the anticipated increase in earnings, from 69c to its eventual

before its results became public. Can't keep a good stock down it seems.

Upping a few losing positions today. Adding to AFFM.

An old Dale Baker pick, this non-standard auto insurance company was recently
enveloped by new investors (raiders?), and the current top management team is
leaving. The company's obviously in turmoil; there are brokerage downgrades,
the stock's near lows. This specialized sector of auto insurance can be very
profitable - but that's attracted new entrants and so there's now stiffer
competition.
AFFM itself doesn't have more than two years of public history.

OTOH, some positives are that the stock's near stated book value, the new
controlling stockholders have paid more for the stock than current price, the
new controlling stockholders maybe have an incentive to get the stock up (as
opposed to getting their money back by looting the company or otherwise harming
small shareholders). Maybe most of the bad news is already out and priced into
the stock.

Been wrong on this one all along. I'll assume over time and with some
restructuring though, the company can get a fair share of business. Just a
small bet for me.
