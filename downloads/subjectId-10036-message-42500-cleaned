No, pink sheet financials usually do not show up in any of the screening tools
I use, especially the small and micro caps. Sometimes the larger foreign mid
caps appear in screens but the best method I have found is to identify your
undervalued or out of favor sector(s), then focus on the comparable companies
reveled in any screen. Many times you will find some hidden gems that are
either foreign or smaller cap pink sheet candidates that are competitors and/or
comparable companies.

Grommit found a good REIT under valued candidate though an analyst's report
done on another company. The report covered a sector that was fast growing and
richly valued. However buried in the report were comparable companies that
showed their relative market shares. Upon further research, one of those
companies was undervalued, poised for excellent growth and IMO a great value
find.

So, you have to turn a lot of rocks over to find those values. Just because
they might trade in the pink sheets does not make them good value buys.
However, many time some really good values do trade in the pink sheets perhaps
because it is an overlooked market. Just be careful of those companies that
reside in China.

Hi Madharry,

There's no compelling reason. I bought because price to stated bv is low,
because the company doesn't seem to have any investor interest (as somewhat
confirmed by the stock at lows). I'm given the possibility that AIG might work
out okay with the fact that Fairholme has taken such a large position. I hope
Berkowitz and his team have done good due diligence.

Sold EBIX to watch the drama from the sidelines.

A lot of old tech stocks are still cheap. Some are very cheap (MSFT, INTC),
some are somewhat cheap (SNDK, ADI, RIMM, HPQ). RIMM might be most
controversial, but for me it's a play on NOK losing share and RIMM filling the
void not captured by AAPL and Android. We'll see if this works out as foreseen.

E&Ps are getting very expensive. Subsequently I am selling, but still trying to
maintain a large weight in oil. Sold some NXY on pretty bad GAAP results, sold
some PBEGF which is not really attractive IMO. Added EGY and DRAGF.

Sold some PWRD on runup.

re AIG - the float is 135M shares and Fairholm bought 44M+ of that ( the
remaining ~1.6B shares are with the government).

Looks to me like Fairholm was solely responsible for the runup to 60$/share but
what is his exit strategy? Sooner or later the government is going to sell it's
shares, so there is quite some sales overhang. Unless AIG is ridiculously
cheap, why would I want to buy now?

AIG book value/share is about 47$ tangible , so it trades at 66% of book, which
sounds OK unless you realize that you can buy insurance companies without AIG
issues for ~75% tangible book. Considering the huge operating losses that AIG
still incurs, that does not seem like a large enough discount to me, even if I
don't consider the overhang from a government stock sale.

I do think there is value in AIG and Ben Mosche does a good job preserving it.
For me though, with those issues, i would like to see a larger discount to
tangible book before jumping in - close to 50% seems OK as an entry point -
that would be around 25$/share.

Closed out some utility holdings: POM bought 2/10 @ $15.92; NI 2/10 @ $14.84.
Cut back 50% BKH - 5/2009 @ $19.00.

All three companies are now selling at PE's that are historically high and
forward PE's present no significant bargain. Dividend yields are falling now
around 4% (except POM) and future growth prospects are small based on the
25%-75% price gains since my initial buy. I do not expect similar gains in the
same time period going forward.

To maintain my dividend income stream, I put 1/2 of the proceeds into MHRpD
(yield around 8.5% paid monthly) and bought DLR and MSFT.

Digital Realty Trust Inc. (DLR) is a REIT that owns data centers that supports
the growing "cloud computing" virtual server applications. Company has pricing
power and has raised it's dividend payout the last three years (more than
doubled the dividend from 2008 levels). Their forward PE based on 12 analysts
who cover the company is 13.96 which is quite low for this sector. This is a
value/growth (GARP) opportunity w/ a 4.5% dividend kicker.

I also doubled upped on my Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) holding as they should
be the beneficiary of many of the emerging technologies in smart phones, cloud
computing and search. Their legacy software(s) should still maintain market
share and they could get lucky w/ several of their ventures into next
generation smart phone and cloud applications. Stock is cheap at 9.25 forward
earnings. I expect the 2.5% dividend might even be raised as they have lots of
cash and stock holders have come to expect a 3% dividend from the company.

FWIW also sold 1/2 position in LSI that I had since 10/98. 13 years and only a
32% gain is not very good. Split adjusted it was valued as high as $60.00/share

S&P, and Fitch. Everyone still uses the ratings to make purchase decisions. The

I don't read Buffett's remarks as "BRK is a buy". He just says that it's not
overpriced and therefore he won't dilute by using stock for purchases. This
does not automatically translate into a "buy".

I don't plan to buy BRK unless I can get it somewhere close to book or below.
There are couple of reasons.

First, Buffett will die or retire. This has been an issue for long, but the
odds are increasing each year. BRK will drop a lot when he does die.

Second, IMHO, BRK has gotten too big to manage hands-on or hands-off like
Warren does. Sokol's case as well as the issues with NetJets, etc. prove that
even with great businesses and great (?) management at some point you have too
many moving parts and it's almost impossible to make them all work. So I don't
have confidence in BRK operating businesses long term.

Third, I don't have confidence in BRK investments long term either. I don't
know the investment record or anything about the guy who will replace Buffett.
I know that he will have to fill very very big shoes with a huge amount of
cash.

Disclosure: I have a very small BRK position. I wish I bought much more 10-20
years ago, but I did not. I was wrong then, perhaps I am still wrong. ;)

tougher to find unless he gives an interview somewhere. The company cranks out

If this is the case, yeah it's a short to zero. You'd have to check with some
legal eagles about that though. ;) That's also one reason why I would not go
long on MCO. ;)

Negative equity - I hate it somewhat, but any company that has tremendous FCF
and buys back shares in buckets eventually ends up with negative tangible
assets and negative equity. :) This is something that makes Buffettology
businesses harder to evaluate. Instead of growing equity a lot of them have
shrinking equity due to the stock buybacks.

Hi Lazarus -

Re: Electronic Control Security Inc. (EKCS.OB)

Company Web Site: http://www.ecsiinternational.com/companypages/about.htm

Good Find. This is an interesting, profitable and undervalued Micro Cap stock
IMO. I have reviewed their most recent 10K and scanned their 10Q (
http://biz.yahoo.com/e/110503/ekcs.ob10-q.html ) released yesterday and the
following items caught my attention.

1) First the company is earning money. From 2010 through 2011 annualized
earnings have varied from $0.02/share to a high of $0.04/share (previous 9
months). At the current price the PE is between 6-10.

In their 10Q they stated"...INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. The income from operations
for the 2011 Period was $422,845 compared to $461,859 for the 2010 Period. For
the three months ended March 31, 2011, we had income from operations of $31,104
compared to $227,282 for the corresponding three months in 2010. <u>The
decrease in income from operations in the 2011 Period and the three months
ended March 31, 2011 as compared to the corresponding periods in 2010 is due to
the delays incurred on the U.S. Navy project with Lockheed Martin</u> as well
as the receipt of lower gross margin purchase orders and a less profitable mix
of design and engineering support services billings....".

Depending on their product mix margins can be as high as 53%.

2) From their 10 K report (pg-5-
http://www.ecsiinternational.com/downloads/ECSI10KFINAL.pdf ), the company has
the potential for 2011 sales of $13 Million. Their current run rate for 2011 is
$3.73 Million and there is a good possibility that 2011 could be back loaded
with high margin products.

"...<u>During fiscal 2010, the Company submitted proposals on projects for
Department of Defense facilities and certain nuclear power stations in the
United States and southeast Asia valued at approximately $13,650,000.</u> A
number of these DoD and nuclear projects amounting to $2.2 million was awarded
and partially shipped during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Most of these
proposals are still pending and awaiting approval, funding and award. We
anticipate decisions relating to these remaining proposals within the first
half of fiscal 2011 with deliveries scheduled through the last six months of
fiscal 2011 and the first half of fiscal 2012....".

3) The company has been in business for quite awhile (since 1976) and owns
several intellectual patents (mostly software related) which could be worth
$0.10/share. Their furniture & equipment could be worth another $0.10/share
(one new piece of equipment is valued at $387K bought w/i the last 90 days).
From their 10Q -(Note: This equipment was directly related to our new
integrated entry control systems and to the WISE? Water Infrastructure Sensing
Equipment, both of which will generate significant sales in the years ahead)

So the company is selling around BV which I estimate to be at $0.20/share.

4) Lots of interesting Technologies:

Products - http://www.ecsiinternational.com/productpages/products.htm

Anti-Piracy Technology (APT) -
http://www.ecsiinternational.com/productpages/antipiracy.htm

Water Quality Monitoring - WISE&#174; (Water Infrastructure Sensing Equipment)
Real-Time Bio/Chemical Contamination Detection System (
http://www.ecsiinternational.com/productpages/waterandnbcr.htm )

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Therefore, I am in for a small speculative BUY. I am expecting that in the 2nd
half of 2011 the company will be awarded the bulk of their new sales from their
proposals still pending w/ DoD.

Their 2011 run rate could exceed $4Million (or higher). I expect these sales to
be their high margin products. Earnings per share could double from last year
which could range $0.04/share-$0.06/share.

At a 10 PE, the stock could trade in the $0.40/share to $0.60/share range. That
would translate into a 1-2 bagger at the current price level.

The risk reward looks attractive. A small speculative Buy for me at the current
price of $0.20/share.

EKS

Note: I have been wrong before and will be wrong again so be careful as this is
still a very speculative and illiquid investment.

.v=1

From the article:"...Total natural gas and crude oil production increased 1% to
2.3 Bcfe for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. The production increase was
driven by the Company's additional working interest in its non-operated
properties in the Atlantic Rim, which the Company purchased in the third
quarter of 2010. The increase was also attributed to improved production from
certain wells in the Doty Mountain Unit as a result of fracture stimulations
performed in the fourth quarter of 2010. At the Catalina Unit, production
declined to 1.2 Bcf for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 from 1.4 Bcf in the
first quarter of 2010. Management believes the decrease is primarily the result
of the field's normal production decline....".

3rd quarter has a lot of drilling. There is potential for production increases
by end of year. Results of their Niobrara well by the end of the year too.

CNP. I keep considering at least trimming some, but so far, I've sold none.

COR. Q report looks at least okay to me. I'll move some cash into a few shares
of COR now for a starter position. I'll guess COR might provide a somewhat
better alternative than cash. Yield of 3.3% isn't so great, but beats cash
reserves. At a glance, distribution seems covered by FFO, and maybe volatility
isn't too bad with the stock.

It seems like this is a bet on believing managements statement that revenue
will increase in the near term due to delayed higher margin projects. As it
stands now, it's a mediocre business with ROE 12% last year and no earning in

Re: PROCYON CORP NEW(Other OTC: PCYN.PK )

Web Site: http://www.procyoncorp.com/

Procyon Corporation (PCYN:OB) is a holding company for its subsidiary Amerx
HealthCare Corporation which was acquired in 1996. Amerx develops and markets
advanced proprietary skin and wound care products used in the treatment of
wounds, ulcers, burns, surgical incisions, cuts, scrapes, abrasions,
dermatitis, inflammation and other skin problems. Amerx provides skin and wound
care products through its proprietary brand, Amerigel&#174;. Amerigel&#174;
contains the proprietary antimicrobial agent, Oakin&#174;, proven effective
against bacteria commonly found in wounds including MRSA.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Lazarus, I have looked at the recent 10K for PCYN. I have compared PROCYON
CORP NEW(Other OTC: PCYN.PK ) to Electronic Control Security Inc. (EKCS.OB) and
the difference that caught my attention.

The first thing I saw that raised a red flag to me is that PCYN is a Florida
shell company. Previous experience w/ these shell companies has taught me to be
very skeptical of their on-going business and many that I have followed ended
in BK.

<u>Barriers to Entry - </u>

There are really no barriers to entry into PCYN's market as evidenced by their
entry into the market through the acquisition of Amerx HealthCare in 1996.
Their "branded" bandaged products have no patents and are manufactured through
several out source vendors that follow FDA approved processes.

EKCS must follow DOD guidelines, prepare proposals that incorporate many of
their patents and proprietary technologies and as a result become a sole source
vendor to their customers. Over $13M in potential sales are already in the
pipeline waiting for approval. No extensive costly sales force (and expenses)
are needed at least for 2011-2012.

<u>Different Cost of Sales Structure: PCYN vs EKCS</u>

PCYN has a rising Cost of Goods Sold problem. In their 10K they blame the 20%
increase due to inflationary factors.

From their 10K:"...While Procyon experienced increased sales (4.9% and 7.7%
respectively), a 20% increase in Cost of Sales
was disproportionately large. Cost of sales increased secondary to significant
price increases from two primary manufacturers passing on increases in raw
material and labor costs...."
(pg- F-3 http://www.procyoncorp.com/images/stories/Procyon_10K_2010.pdf )

What surprised me more about PCYN is that their annual operating costs
increased too. This was due to expanding their marketing and sales staff which
resulted in higher expenses and lower overall profit margins. Their GS&A is
quite high at 90% of their gross profit.

EKCS was the opposite. Their margins are actually increasing and several of
their new products to be introduced in 2011 have margins as high as 53%.

Basically every incremental sale that EKCS brings in is more profitable that
that for PCYN.

<u>Diminishing line of Businesses for PCYN vs Growing line of new products for
EKCS:</u>

In July 2009 PCYN exited their Diabetic product business and sold their assets
in Sirius Medical Supply, Inc to Priority Diabetes. They claim they could not
be profitable from smaller medicare reimbursements.

What if potential medicare reimbursements are reduced for their advanced
proprietary skin and wound care products? This is just another unknown factor
that could impact future sales.

EKCS is growing their product lines adding Water Purification Monitors and even
Anti-Piracy technologies to their lines.
http://www.ecsiinternational.com/productpages/products.htm

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Therefore, although both companies have PE's less than 10 and seem like
extremely undervalued companies, they are quite different. To recognize their
value each must grow their sales. EKCS seems to have set their table w/ new
high margin products, proposals in the pipeline and orders on their way.

However, PCYN must continue to expand their sales force, solicit more direct
sales (to hospitals) and obtain medicare reimbursement approval for their line
of bandages. This comes at the burden of higher operating expenses and
increasing manufacturing costs. I believe PCYN has a more difficult job in
growing more profitable sales. One or two large accounts could turn it around.
They already have one that accounts for 16% of their sales.

I will pass on PCYN for now. I believe that EKCS has the best risk/reward
profile but it all hinges on them being awarded (& funded) at least 30% of
their submitted ($13M total value) proposals.

EKS

Disclaimer: I have been wrong in the past and could very well be wrong now.
Both companies could be loosers if sales do not grow and many factors work into
this equation. It does appear that both companies have sufficient cash (or
lines to capital) but this will run out too over time.

I took a quick look at RGRX financials today and see that they have NO SALES

I posted they made a huge run up over 6 bucks. unbelievably I had made a
speculative purchases of many shares at .002 with a .0001 bid which paid off
big time. I think that was in 1998 or 1999.

I think I've bought PCYN at 12 cents 3 times but traded out of the shares each
time and since it now seems to be holding up better I decided to buy back in
today with a small position.

Hi Reno4 -

Their corporate status is described in the first few pages of their 10K. It's

is a company that is incorporated but has no assets or operations also known as
a
shell entity.

If you don't mind some more questions.

I found this in Wikipedia:
The type of "shell corporation" described here should not be confused with a
"Shell" company which is a specific term used by the Securities and Exchange
Commission to refer to a publicly held company with no or nominal assets other
than money.[2]

An example of a legal use of a shell company is a supplier of store brand
groceries that sets up a shell company when dealing with a hard discounter like
Aldi. By obscuring its business relation with the discount chain, the supplier
prevents diluting the value of its main brand, which sells at much higher
prices.

So why would EKCS be formed as a shell company?

All public shell companies are not frauds or are bad. In fact sometimes they
are set up to separate potential liability for the owners. My only point was
several of those that I have seen that were Florida shell companies were not
always on the up and up.

Procyon Corp. was set up using a shell corp as stated in their 10K. From their
Web Site:"...Procyon Corporation (PCYN:OB) was incorporated in the state of
Colorado on March 19, 1987 and acquired by John Anderson in 1995 through the
purchase of a public shell to engage in the acquisition and development of
medically-related entities. Based in Clearwater, Florida, Procyon was deemed a
development stage company until acquiring Amerx HealthCare Corporation (Amerx)
in 1996..."

Electronic Control Security, Inc. was founded in 1976 and was not set up using
a public shell. The founders incorporated their business in New Jersey and that
is where their headquarters are located (Clifton, NJ). I am not sure what you
mean by "why would EKCS be formed as a shell company?".

When you see that a public shell company was used to form a company (especially
w/i a year), just be cautious and do a bit more due diligence. Many of these
Chinese companies used reversed merger existing U.S. public shell companies as
a means to control their business. This provided a quick way for them to trade
on the NSADQ and/or pink sheets and/or Bulletin Board exchanges. The SEC
financial reporting requirements are much less for many of these shells
especially if the dollar and/or share prices are below a set minimum amount.

Unless a company has a pretty good reason to use a previous established public
shell entity, I usually just avoid them.

FWIW Voyager Oil & Gas, Inc. (VOG) was formally a public shell company called
ante4, Inc which was originally set up as an online poker business.

From their 10K:"...On April 16, 2010 ante4, Inc. ("ante4") completed the
acquisition of Plains Energy Investments, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the
"Company") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger
Agreement"). Subsequent to the Merger, ante4 changed its name to Voyager Oil &
Gas, Inc. Under the Merger Agreement, Plains Energy Acquisition, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Voyager, merged with and
into the Company, with the Company remaining as the surviving corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Voyager (the "Merger"). Currently, Voyager is a
holding company parent of the Company, and Voyager's business operations
following the Merger are the same as ours...."

ante4 was used as the "shell" to form the wholly-owned subsidiary called
Voyager Oil & Gas. VOG merged with Plains Energy Acquisition, Inc. where all
their E&P land assets are controlled. ante4 later changed it's corporate name
to Voyager Oil & Gas.

Public shell companies are pretty common in the micro cap Oil & Gas and mining
business.

re Greenblatt: The headline:

"Value Investor Greenblatt: Here’s How to Beat the Benchmark"

His significant point, I believe: "Finally, according to Greenblatt, at the top
of the investing chain are value-weighted indexes, which consist of stocks with
cheap valuation and high quality. Greenblatt likes the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV)
and of course the mutual fund that he was involved in creating, the Formula
Investing US Value 1000 fund (FVVAX)."

And here's how Yahoo says these two value funds are doing over the past five
years compared to typical market benchmarks:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=VTV&t=5y&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=fvvax%2C

In other words, contrary to what the article promises, these two funds have not
beat a benchmark that's defined by "market-cap weighted indexes".

I agree that "value" indexes are not necessarily very good though.

If you look at RSP and PRF, they have beaten "market weighted" S&P500, but not
NASDAQ (whatever Yahoo means by NASDAQ - I have no clue):

Market weighted indexes accentuate momentum investing: rising market cap leads
to higher weighting leads to more buying leads to rising market cap and so on;
falling market cap leads to lower weighting leads to selling and so on. The
only positive is that the reweighting is not instant.

(DOW is not market weighted and it's a very very bad index overall as discussed
by Ken Fisher).

I should have used comparable timeframes, yes. Thanks for the correction. It
will be very interesting to me to see if this value index fund can continue to
beat the S&P. And if not consistently (which I don't expect), at least over
what timeframes it might be-- six months, a year, five years, etc.

And the reason I'm interested is because I continue to hold a large number of
individual stocks -- more than anyone else I know. I believe that people sense
I must get mediocre (i.e. just average)results, because with a large number of
stocks eventually I must be mimicking the market, and getting what it gives. I
don't believe that's necessarily so, or factually so in my case. Assuming it's
accurate for me to say that most of my stocks are value stocks, then to me, if
a fund like FVVAX consisting of almost 900 stocks ("weighted based on the
Adviser’s assessment of a security’s fundamental value, based on factors such
as earnings yield and return on capital")can do better over time (albeit maybe
not consistently) than something like the usual mutual fund bogey of the S&P
500, then that's some actual evidence or possibility that performance doesn't
have to degrade with increasing number of stocks held. Additionally, since
there ought to be a consideration of risk vs. reward, the good results of the
fund would be got with less risk than otherwise. (Because, of course, failure
of a few companies in the fund aren't significant when so many other companies
are being held.) I would like to believe that this reduction in risk is a
benefit to me too given my large number of stocks. Although at this time I have
high risk, since I'm sector concentrated -- heavily to oil related companies.

articles of silver, none of which alluded to the 5 increases in margin
required, as well as additional margin increases by brokers, as a possible
reason for the decline. MF global announced they were raising silver margins to
175% of the comex requirement. I guess owning silver as a US Citizen is slowly
becoming like being an on line poker player. Moreover, It is down right
shocking to me that no one but me seems to think that the sharp decline in asia
sunday evening when several asian markets were closed seemed to pressage that
coming margin increases in silver. Gee, it almost like someone knew ahead of

is. Seems clear to me that the COMEX is far from being a level playing field

news seems all out now, I'll exit my remaining shares.

I would be more happy if I were right on other Chinese small caps. :/

Looking back the correct approach was to avoid all the RTO space + some small
cap native IPOs. No income/balance sheet analysis was enough to find good RTOs.
The ones with lousy income/balance sheets were as likely to collapse as the
ones with great financials. The jury is still out if there are any that were
good investments long term.

In toto, I made money on GFRE even with disastrous last sales. These gains may
cover my losses in other Chinese RTOs. The margin of safety - buying really
cheap - applies even when companies are fraudulent. ;) Especially if you sell
on various runups. ;)

I still hold bigger/institutional Chinese names: CYOU, GAME, PWRD, CHL.

The $1M question is if Fairholme gonna emerge victorious from their current

VTV was loaded with financials before the financial crisis, that is why it fell
deep and has not recovered. At least that was my recollection when I purchased
it as a trading sardine in 2007 and looked a bit under the hood.

Like all Sardines, it started to smell after a short time and I sold it (at a
loss).

I dont know that the bad news is all out on this one. I too had concerns about
the large a/r balances and exited this with a loss last year i think. The press
release doesnt really explain the extent of their losses in my view and makes
me really concerned about management, especially considering they didnt even
bother with a warning. When I invested in the company it seemed like a logical
way to play china over the next decades. just one more nail in the coffin that
is investing in chinese small caps. Still suffering with my massive gfre
position though. Seems strange to be having such a big loss on a company that
supposedly has $2 in cash and is projected to earn $1.80 in 2011. At least the
cpa hasnt quit and fidelity hasnt sold their position as far as i know.

nice article kind of shows the vagaries of book value in the insurance
business. makes me wonder who supervises the reporting when an insurance can
under-reserve 9 out of 10 years. I thought insurance regulators were around to
make sure this did not happen.

After doing a small amount of research I would not chase this. might be
interested in aig at $25 too.

SYY. I decided to sell my SYY. Unfortunately, I decided last friday. (I hate it
when that happens.) If I did not sell fri, i certainly would have sold
yesterday. It was a short term holding, and a small profit.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=SYY&t=5d&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=

and bought quite a bit more COR last week, and yesterday. it will be a long
term holding. It seems like COR has more potential than SYY

SYY. So frustrating when a stock pops so soon after the position's closed!

Too bad for me as well with SYY. I gave up on that one and closed position 4/19
@ $28.65.

I guessed the upcoming earnings would not do well compared to prior quarters
because gas prices had risen so much.

Hi, after being in quite a bit of cash for the past few months I put my toe
back in the market with several position in the past week or two. The
selections come primarily from a variation on Greenblatt's approach

These include:
MSFT - favorite before Christmas, still a favorite
AAPL - yes - it's hitting my Goldblatt screens now. First time I've owned it.
I'm not a fan of their products but they sure can print money.
EBIX - added some more to existing large position. The stock reaction today to
earnings doesn't make sense to me. (maybe that makes me the fool).
MED - Medifast
MDF - Metropolitan Health - doubled my position last week - but note it's run
up quite a bit since then.
DST - DST Systems

still have positions in these from prior to the new year:
DO - Diamond Offshore
LHCG - LHC Group
CHL - China Mobile
TEO - Telecom Argentina

I have my eye on a few more - almost purchased USNA but glad I didn't - it
collapsed recently. Glad I was on the sidelines for ARO also - it's one that
has been tugging at my chain too.

EBIX - I don't hold a position anymore, but I wouldn't be so positive.

Revenue is increasing at about 22%, while earnings are flat if you annualize Q1
vs 2010. Their S&M and G&A are going up - both mentioned as low in the short
report. There's 1.5M currency exchange gain, which is not something to expect
every quarter. Income taxes are rising - another point of the short report. ROE
dropped to 18%. OCF is still 50% lower than earnings!

It's still a marginal buy if you expect that their results will continue in a
similar vein. It's not a buy if the short predictions will come to roost. So
far they have been somewhat correct. ;) Personally, I would look for $15'ish to
reenter the position. Otherwise, IMHO the risk is too high.

the new margin is $21,600 which if silver is @$40 would be 10.8% and some

re ADM - bought today pre-market at 32.2$ because a limit order hit. I had sold
my position acquired last year a while ago but now it's going down even though
the whole AG sector is shooting up. Anybody knows what is going with ADM? Their
last earnings appeared decent to me.

I put in the limit order last night after checking prices in the supermarket,
no kidding. The inflation is unbelievable - I think we are up 20-30% compared
to 2-3 years ago for many items. Good thing that a 6 pack of decent Microbew
can still be had for 6$ and sometimes less. I wonder how long that price lasts.

Hi Clownbuck -

I have been getting my Micro Brew (Glissade-Sierra Nevada) at a 25% discount to
it's normal retail price (at my local Wall Green). It's the only food drop I
have noticed recently.

Many of my AG stocks on my new watch screen are actually down over the last two
weeks. Longer term they are all higher; CAG up 14% YTD, ADM up 10% YTD, DE up
25% YTD, DD up 14% YTD and BG up 18% YTD. Food prices in general seem higher
too. Even the AG equipment manufactures are up big.

My thought is that it is more of a Global event w/ commodities prices much
higher (and rising) over the last two years. The higher costs are moving
through all of the channels and only now are we seeing higher end user food
prices. The fall in the $US may also amplify the price impact here in the U.S..

I am still not convinced that my AG basket is in "value" buy territory as many
of the price hikes are just passed through to the end user and there is no
direct increase in bottom line profits and/or margins. The equipment
manufactures and companies that bring efficiencies to this sector do gain in
increased sales. Examples include EI DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD) in their
hybrid seed division and/or Deere & Company (DE) in their farm machinery.

Not all of the AG companies will benefit from the increase in commodity prices.
It's more about the growth from the BRIC countries. Too high of commodity
prices over a sustained period could significantly impact the LT growth rates
for these companies. This could result in lower overall future growth rates and
ultimately lower PE's. Better values could possibly be had if the market prices
in much lower future growth.

In the tiny print I do like that the company started drilling on their San Juan
Basin property,

"...Our oil and gas segment started drilling a horizontal gas test well in the
Mancos formation shale in the San Juan Basin in early April. The well is the
first of three planned to be drilled in the San Juan and Piceance Basins during
2011. Results for all three wells are expected during the fourth quarter....".
