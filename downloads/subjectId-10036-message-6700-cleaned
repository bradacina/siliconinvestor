"Peak TrENDS Trust" - Amex: PTT

Looking at the news items for PEAKF, I noticed they had references to
Amex symbol PTT as well as PEAKF on the Nasdaq. These turned out to
be shares in the "Peak TrENDS Trust", a Delaware trust that holds
Treasury securities, pays quarterly dividends, and, in May 2001,
terminates and converts into shares of PEAKF.

PTT currently has an NAV of ca. $16 per share, is quoted at 5 - 5 3/8,
and SEC filings are on Edgar under the name "Peak Trends Trust".
Below is a description of PTT taken from the N30D filing of 01/15/99.

Does anyone have any comments about these securities - in particular,
are there any pitfalls to watch out for, apart from the obvious one
of PEAKF possibly becoming valueless before 2001?

Peak TrENDS Trust
Summary Information

Each of the Trust Enhanced Dividend Securities ("TrENDS") of the Peak TrENDS
Trust represents the right to receive an annual distribution of $1.418, and
will
be exchanged on May 15, 2001 for between 0.8696 and 1.0 ordinary share, $0.01
par value per share ("Common Stock") of Peak International Limited (the
"Company"). The annual distribution of $1.418 per TrENDS is payable quarterly
on
each February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, commencing August 15, 1998
and ending May 15, 2001. The TrENDS are not subject to redemption.

The Trust was established to purchase and hold a portfolio of stripped U.S.
Treasury securities maturing on a quarterly basis through May 15, 2001, and a
forward purchase contract for Common Stock of the Company (the "Contract") with
Luckygold 18A Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands,
which is a shareholder of the Company (the "Seller"). Mr. T. L. Li, the sole
shareholder of the Seller has guaranteed the delivery of the shares of Common
Stock covered by the Contract and the maintenance of collateral for the
Seller's
obligations under the Contract. The trustees of the Trust do not have the power
to vary the investments held by the Trust.

The Trust's investment objective is to provide each holder of TrENDS with a
quarterly distribution of $0.354 per TrENDS and, on May 15, 2001 (the "Exchange
Date"), a number of shares of Common Stock per TrENDS computed as follows: (1)
if the average daily closing or last sale price of the Common Stock in the
Nasdaq National Market for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the
Exchange Date (the "Reference Market Price") is less than $18.1125 but equal to
or greater than $15.75, the holder will be entitled to receive a number of
shares of Common Stock per TrENDS the value of which, when multiplied by the
Reference Market Price, is equal to $15.75; (2) if the Reference Market Price
per TrENDS on the Exchange Date is equal to or greater than $18.1125, the
holder
will be entitled to receive 0.8696 shares of Common Stock per TrENDS; and (3)
if
the Reference Market Price per TrENDS on the Exchange Date is less than $15.75,
the holder will be entitled to receive 1.0 share of Common Stock per TrENDS.
The
exchange ratios are subject in each case to adjustment upon the occurrence of
certain events. Holders will receive a cash adjustment in lieu of any
fractional
share of Common Stock distributable in respect of their aggregate holdings of
TrENDS. Under the Contract, instead of delivering shares of Common Stock, the
Seller may elect, not later than 20 trading days prior to the Exchange Date, to
pay cash in an amount per TrENDS equal to the Reference Market Price multiplied
by the number of shares of Common Stock determined under the above formula. If
the Seller should make that election, holders of TrENDS will receive cash
instead of shares of Common Stock on the Exchange Date.

The Medical Outpatient/Home Care sector is really getting pounded. I'd welcome
feedback on whether there are good values there.

Here's a list of stocks in this sector:

http://biz.yahoo.com/research/indgrp/med_outp_hm_cre.html

The ones that interest me the most are not the laser vision stocks you see at
the top of this list (which is sorted by average analyst ranking), but rather
the medical care stuff that has a lower analyst ranking.

Here's a link I made with charts and valuations for some of the stocks from the
middle of the list:

http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=rhb+riox+rcgi+hrc+renx+path+aori+phyn+cure+imph+asgr
dian+dgx+trl&d=b

You can see from the charts that stocks in this sector are really beaten up. It
looks like there must be some sector rotation going on here, plus maybe the
usual problem of small cap stocks underperforming the market.

I especially like RHB, which has appeared many times in the Forbes annual list
of best small companies. It is now trading at 8X earnings, 7X cash flow from
operations. It has a good financial model, with an ROE of 26%, and an eps
growth rate of 25% CAGR over the last 5 years. Analysts expect the growth rate
to slow to 18% in 2000, but even so, the PEG works out to a cheap 8/18 = 0.44.

The sector-specific concerns might include changes in medicare reimbursement.

Companies that do outsourcing, like RHB, will actually gain from reduced
medicare reimbursement. That's because they don't do the billing, but rather
operate on an hourly fee. As higher cost providers like hospitals are squeezed,
they are motivated to replace their expensive in-house staff with outsourced
staff to reduce costs, and this will grow the top line for the outsourcing
companies.

Any opinions?

... on second thoughts (which, as always, don't happen until the edit
period is past) buying PTT is essentially paying a premium over PEAKF
which is handed back to you as (taxable) dividends between now and
2001, as PTT converges with PEAKF. The (after-tax) NPV of the expected
dividends doesn't appear to exceed the current PTT-over-PEAKF premium
by enough to get excited over. (But this is very much a back-of-envelope
calculation; your analysis may reach a different conclusion.)

The two stocks you listed, GHV and VC, are priced as if it is almost sure they
will go out of business. The charts are the most horrible looking things I've
ever seen. It's not often you see a stock with a p/b of 0.09, and a PSR of

It appears that investing in VC is a bet on how a dispute between VC and a

some kind of value that is sure-fire here?

VC looks like speculation...I would value it like a call option. The bonds
might be interesting...selling @21 for 56% YTM, but coupon rate is subject to
renegotiation...not due to indenture, but more "if you don't we'll go
bk"...same threat as to VTR, the related REIT, on rent reduction. VTR has
issued "Going concern" warning based on issues with VC. I ran both versions of
Altman on VC and it comes out borderline...but I don't think the REIT's
position as defacto debt is being captured by the models. The bonds are saying
the equity's toast. IR has been unresponsive.
GHV...I'm long the related REIT, ETT. The Altman readings are worse here, but
the bonds are trading at 12% YTM as in "Don't worry, be happy"...I put more
credence in the bonds, but wouldn't buy them. Insider buying is favorable..the
CFO of ETT has been a buyer which provides reassurance..but beyond that lot's
of insider buying at higher levels in both GHV & VC...either they're clueless
or GHV & VC aren't quite the trainwrecks the charts & valuations portray.
The underlying demographic...85 and older growing at 3x the rate of the general
population, gives me some hope that adjustments will be made to PPS that would
enable these outfits to survive. Meanwhile, with cap rates thru the roof, there
will be little building in the sector, at least from the entities like these.
At some point the supply demand situation, coupled with "Blood in the streets"
sentiment is going to set up some home run opportunities, but I doubt anything
will look like a sure thing...except in retrospect.

>>Borders (BGP) just did something that puts it on my watch list:<<

I belong to an investment club with a couple of lifelong friends and others.
Borders was brought up as a potential investment pending further review by the
members. My first glance indicates that it is reasonably priced, perhaps
attractive. I think my only negative was that it didn't meet my minimum ROE
hurdle. The kicker here is that even though the company thinks the interNUT
business is a loser and they aren't going to invest much, it may add tremendous
value to the company. Why not spin it off to cash in a chip that you don't
really care about if you can get a big price in this environment?

Can someone offer insight into CURE?

This is was a highflyer a couple of months ago. If you look at their numbers as
posted, they're wonderful: Cash ~$5/share, no long-term debt, PE 3.5, PSR .59,
$100 million revenue run rate, growth slowing, but still in the teens, ROE of
20%, AND a stock price of $4.50. They run and manage wound care clinics in
concert with hospitals.

So what's wrong? Plenty: 1/4 of the business is with Columbia/HCA, all of which
they might lose. Further COL and CURE have been served with Medicare Subpoenae
alleging fraud, etc. Further, their most profitable product is Procuron which
is a non-FDA approved biologic which is made from the patient's own white
cells, and then applied to the wounds regularly. Reimbursement for this product
has been denied by Medicare. Furthermore there are biotech generated
substitutes that are approved for payment. The science is actually decent, but
so what? Their wound care results are said to be decent, but so what?

After the stock had been cratered to $9-10/share, I listened to the CC in Feb
99. The CEO said that Columbia/HCA contracts were being revised to achieve
uniformity. He said that he expected growth to slow (not stop or reverse, just
slow) in 1999. He implied that wound care itself was not very profitable, but
the advantage to a medical center was that such a facility drew patients that
would not otherwise come there, and these patients were very profitable to the
institution at large. He said that it was becoming difficult to sell that
concept to hospitals.

(My sense at the time was that problems were much deeper. Management had the
company buy back several million shares of stock which bounced the price. And
then the Feds served papers.)

At this point I see it as a break-even business, that may be saddled with a lot
of payback, and a management lacking credibility.

So My Question is: Do you think that there is inherent value in this situation
despite massive uncertainty?

LauA,

My take on CURE is that it appears to be a sort of rotten apple that generates
bad news that helps drag down the sector as a whole. Rather than pulling your
hair out trying to decide whether CURE isn't rotten enough to deserve its badly
depressed price, my approach is that it would be better pick a good company in
the sector, and enjoy the historically cheap valuation it has due to the bad
news generated by other companies in the sector.

CURE was one of the peer stocks I used to compare RHB about 2 days ago.

I had the following link with Yahoo charts and p/e ratios for these peers,
http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=rhb+riox+rcgi+hrc+renx+path+aori+phyn+cure+imph+asgr
dian+dgx+trl&d=b

Yahoo shows a TTM p/e of 3.6 for CURE. Compare that to 7.7 for RHB.

CURE appears to be in all kinds of trouble, whereas business is going great for
RHB.

The two provide very different kinds of business to hospitals, and RHB has no
possibility of being cited for Medicare fraud because it merely provides
contract labor and doesn't do any patient billing. But no matter, the sector
rotation out of these small medical service stocks is depressing the good along
with the bad.

You can make it easy on yourself and take the good company selling cheap.

 This is a lousy business. End of discussion for me.

Not so fast. First off, huh? This is from Jim, he of Tejon Ranch? Champion of
Penobscot? Repeat buyer of Hyde...er Saucony?

Ok, the following is thrown together quickly, so don't laugh if there's some
glaring errors (and I am still investigating BGP):

The way I look at it, BKS (blech, blech) trades at a PE of 29, 5 times
leveraged book with a debt/equity of nearly 1, and 15 pennies/share in cash. It
also gets a profit margin of 1.9% for a PSR of 0.84. ROE is 17% but it's
leveraged. The stock is about 25% off 52 week highs and running into a lot of
overhead pressure.

BGP, which I like visiting better anyway (hey, I met Aerosmith there), trades
at a PE of 14, under 2X debt-free book, and 53 pennies per share in cash. With
a profit margin of 3.4% for a PSR of 0.48. ROE is 15%. And that's a stable
business. The stock is 65% off 52 week highs and basing.

This didn't persuade me until BGP made their announcement. Why? Because BGP has
prudent management, and they're proving it by keeping a level head about this
whole internet thing. They state they will not throw money down that hole. And
hole it is, right? Unless you've reversed your position on Amazon's business
economics.

That's shabby?

I see visiting bookstores as a continuing trend that demographics favor, as the
population ages, and even the young crowd things that hanging out in the local
bookstore is fun.

Hey, BGP's superstore same store trends are still up. Gross margins are still
increasing due to tighter inventory controls. It's not perfect, I know, and
it's a probably a good business only one quarter of the year.

Still, it's a call I'm about to make good on.

Hi Paul,

I finally gave up on SIII with a tiny profit after almost a year. Rode it all
the way down and back up again when the Intel news came out. If they get the
new chip right and USC goes public later this year, it might still be a winner.
The way they've been eating up book value and issuing shares decided me against
waiting another 6 months though. After it hit a buck and a half last October I
started looking more closely at stocks trading below $5 which is something I'd
pretty much avoided up until that time. I've been using a software program to
screen for value plays and although there are a lot of dogs way down there,
there are some real treasures also. I think a lot of folks try to average down
on margin and end up creating more downward momentum once they start getting
hit with margin calls.

Do you follow any VARs? I like the looks of MICA but I think there may still be
some downside left in the sector. The ANALyst party line seems to be, "The
channel is dead. Long live the internet.", but I sort of think they may just be
looking to snag some cheep stock. A lot of the value added resellers are
trading at a huge discount to book right now. The market doesn't seem to care
much about assets these days but I still like to see something in the way of
book value to justify the price. For that matter, put options on the Dow index
are starting to look like a value play. Over value play?

assume that the point of a "value" approach is that the market often suffers
from a misapprehension. If that is so in the case of CURE, it will become a two

thanks for tip .. liked stock also and took position. second stock from this
group (other TGX @ $6.50) thanks

Mostly very cautious about this market (mostly packed into BRK, GE) .. but like
minor forays this group provides. Started small "go go fund" with you guys as
my analysts. so far so good :)

p.s. anyone noticing the nasdaq is quivering ... while on common snit ..
doesn't anyone take into account what will happen to AOL if they can not say
cable modem.

p.p.s. my area of expertise is the internet. I was strategist for BBN (the
company that invented all things internet) as well as lead designer for all
processes used to build and deploy internet networks used to fight desert
storm. Only bring this up to add some credibility to following conjecture: In
the world of the future, computers are lower and lower cost commodities and
bandwidth is free.

so what .. I am pleased everyone is partying on the other side town and dancing
on the ice burgs while companies of basic value are being overlooked ... I
mean, even I can figure out that ICO is worth more than the $8.25/share I paid.

Again, enjoy 'lurking' and taking action from time to time from this group. By
far the best source I have :)

JJClarke - do you have thoughts on GEHL?

Five years ago I was alerted to them by insider buying, and I guess the ROE. I
happened to be in Sioux City, IA and visited a big implement dealer who carried
their stuff. He convinced me that they had a very limited sales horizon, so I
passed. Now BDavis with Napeague is thumping the company. Did you see them at
the Las Vegas show? Do you have an opinion?

GEHL is an extremely dangerous stock. The skid steer market will collapse by
year-end.

What I really wanted to post though is that from an institutional investor's
perspective the last two days, especially today, was the biggest rotation from
growth stocks into value stock (especially cyclicals) I have seen in three
years. The question is can it last. The small caps are also starting to perk
up. The internet stocks got clocked today. But anybody with an institutional
value portfolio is thinking about popping the champagne. Or is it just a false
start. David "Why Did I Schedule This Interview Tonight" Alger was on Moneyline
tonight and poo-pooed it. His top holdings are AOL, Amazon and Dell. Not a good
day for David Alger. Value managers were up VERY big today, despite the indices
being off 1-3%. Can it last? And if it does, can the small caps outperform
without a catharsis? That was my reason to sell half my portfolio a month ago,
that there is no way this market corrects without everything correcting. So far
it looks like one of the dumbest decisions I have ever made. Every stock I sold
is up 10-20%. There could be something very big happening here.

I was just getting to post the same sentiment re: rotation, but you beat me to
it. Except you're the institution, and I'm the guy on the street. I'm long NH

 my reason to sell half my portfolio a month ago,
that there is no way this market corrects without everything
correcting. 

Jim, you've made good calls in the past. But long-term do you really see
yourself a market timer forever? There were lots of good companies for sale.
You knew it. SO CHEAP in fact that I had to speculate a few days ago that your
view might not turn true, but that instead we may actually get the narrow
leaders crashing while our value stocks rise. The sheer suicidal frustration of
value investors tipped at least me off to this, but also the valuations. What
made you think that the REITS would get cheaper? That Ag equips could get
cheaper? That manufactured housing would get cheaper? And even if they did, no
biggie because it wouldn't be sustainable.

Brazil was also up big today. Value will out...

I did have one stock down big for me today. Deswell. That piece has been one
huge ball and chain around my foot. Still gotta believe.

And over on TheStreet.com, Cramer is saying he's buying into internets and
selling his cyclicals. Selling his cyclicals? Who's he kidding? Just trying to
look good for the cameras.

Ironically, I was hoping that this wouldn't happen yet. I've been putting
together an investment limited partnership over the last few weeks, as the
market made new highs and value stocks got cheaper. It's taking a while to get
my ducks in a row.

Here's hoping the rotation is temporary,

nasdaq comes down a fair amount, the .com's get hit big and the main market
only a little and only for small amount of time.

There is too much recent history and hype about the market and recent rebounds.
Rather the "experts" will all conclude that this is merely another example the
dangers of "playing in the street." And given the recent profits and mass

A quick note tonight…..

It looks as though the mid and small caps are on the verge of popping to the
upside. On a day when the Nasdaq was down over 76 points on record volume
of over 1.4 billion shares, one would have expected to see the number of
decliners swamp the advancers. However, there were 2220 advancers and 1929
decliners on the Nasdaq. The NYSE ratio was even better, with 1729
advancers to 1282 decliners. Also take note of the strong move over the past
few sessions in the Russell 2000. It looks as though it has put in a bottom
and may be getting ready to go off to the races. Although it was only “up”
by 0.15 for the day to 417.39, the Russell 2000 had been up more than 7
points at one point in the day and the majority of the drop came in the last
hour.

Compare the Russell's performance to some of the better known small cap
value funds and a different picture emerges. These are today's
performances:
Berger Small Cap Value BSVIX – up 1.45%
T.Rowe Price Small Cap Value PRSVX – up 1.57%
Kemper Small Cap Value +2.12%

The big cousins are taking a breather and quite possibly the laggards are
starting to catch up.

That's it for tonight.

We're talking about two days. This is big, but it could be leading not to a
soft landing, but to a final catharsis - (cyclicals run ===> Interest rates
rise, BYE!) I don't believe this orderly transition is sustainable yet, and I
was psychologically ready to face a runup in the stocks I sold without changing
the course. That was not by any means a one month call. (Covering my Amazon
short a week ago may go down as an even dumber move. This has not been a good
year in Jim-land. My wife is about to take over the brokerage account. You know
that feeling.)

The one thing I will buy are net-nets that pass my additional tests
(sustainable business, real asset value, and a catalyst). Because a) Every one
of these I ever bought has gone up over 50% within a year; and b) in my
experience, they have almost zero correlation with the market, even major
moves. I only wish I could find more of them - its usually one every six
months. Think I found one today for the first time in a year, and for the first
time in two years, its not a shoe company. Let me get a position and we'll
compare notes in a week or so.

And here's a story for a market top. My 22 year old cousin is thinking about
doing a little investing. She has been playing one-week dummy portfolios in a
contest on AOL. She asked me if 34% in a week is a good return. I chuckled and
asked her what she "owned". AOL, Amazon... She finds them by watching what the
guy who won last week owned. ("So, not a good day today, huh?") Then she asked
me about an investment term she heard - "Jim, what's a liability?" 34% in a
week. Don't quit the day job.

<<Jim, you've made good calls in the past. But long-term do you really see
yourself a market timer forever? >>

I don't see myself as a market timer now. Maybe the biggest danger in making
one market call is not that you're wrong, but rather that you're dead-on right
like I was last July. So then you think you can do it again. The jury is still
out on this one, but so far I have passed on three stocks I otherwise would
have bought.

Maybe this is part of the suicidal value investor behavior you referred to. It
may very well be. Its one thing running a personal account in this environment.
Its quite another facing clients every quarter, and facing less of them each
quarter than the one before. And you rack your brain, but can't figure out what
you're doing wrong. "Oh, you're firing me because I didn't buy Amazon. OK, that
makes sense." Maybe its gotten to me.

For the last year, working at a value shop has been like working in a morgue.
(Actually, I like Charlie Munger's metaphor better - It feels like "being a one
legged man in an ass-kicking contest".) Maybe the best signal that this has to
turn soon is that good disciplined value investors that you have heard of are
quite literally worried about going out of business if this two tiered market
persists through the second quarter. Most frustrating is that every time you
lose a client, you have to sell stocks to fund the redemption, which drives
your illiquid holdings down further. Sometimes you find that you are among the
biggest quarterly sellers of a stock you love. Its enough to drive you to
market time. If market timing satisfies the urge that would otherwise be spent
doing bodily harm to yourself or others, its for the better.

(I write this not to bask in misery, but rather to give you something to print
out and hang on your wall to show what a growth-value inflection point might
look like. Who knows, we might see similar posts on the Amazon thread in a few
weeks.)

Cheerfully,

I expected to be ridiculed for that statement and I may be yet. Your post made
my day. Thanks. Its been a rough week.

For the smile I got out of that post, I'll disclose in full. Journal Register
(JRC) (at 12 - 13 and change is not too late IMHO), Anchor Gaming (SLOT) at 42
(Once again, not too late), and USEC (USU) at 13. USEC is one of the few stocks
I held onto in my personal account, and the other two are two recent
institutional buys. We've been through JRC (if it wasn't on this thread, it was
on the Buffetology thread) and SLOT is way too complicated to get into unless
somebody has specific questions, but I think it is a buy below 50.

If you a reason to learn about SLOT, find the annual and look at the 10 year
track record. Then look at the P/E ratio. Or even better, the price/free cash
flow ratio. Then do two weeks of homework like I did and get back to me. I
honestly don't know how to tell this story in a concise enough manner for this
format. (My buy recommendation was 18 pages long - although once you get it,
its not hard to understand - its just takes a while to get there.) This is a
growth company at 8 times earnings. Management is among the most intelligent
and aggressive I have ever met, and in two hours of trying, I could not shake
their story. Though I warn you in advance, when you dig into SLOT, you are
going to find some weird, weird stuff.

Weird posts lately, IMO. So I'll add one too.

If MD's can start limited investment partnerships and actually find people to
invest with them, the bull market is not over. It's either topping or just
getting going. Who knows?

But plenty of opportunities to make good investments.
Geez, I'm missing them all over the place. I can't scoop them up fast enough.
So many.

What is wrong with your value investing firm? Value investors are making
business investments-- nobody expects value investments to do internet hoops.
Or do they? Maybe the firm better understand clients' expectations. Maybe
educate clients.

What is wrong with your value investing firm? There have been plenty of value
stocks posted here that have done exceptionally well (IMO). Plenty. So many.
Portfolios ought to be up all over the place.

Your own picks here look very good (don't have facts;just an opinion).
Fabulous potential on some actually, IMO. You or your firm have no courage to
buy your own ideas?

Okay, This is the value thread. To me this means, it's not ever about what one
didn't buy, it's about what one did and does buy. It's about considering risk
in the investment decision. And it's about being patient to see the decision
work out (not just watch the daily internet mania up, up and up). So maybe the
smartest investors (B. Graham def) are waiting patiently for their
opportunities. Can't fault that.

But man (and as long as I'm venting I'll just keep rushing forward-g-), I can
understand patience to hold, but I have trouble with people having patience to
buy values. If there're values out there, buy them. If someone doesn't see any
values, get off the thread. For me, I would like this NOT to be the thread for
refugees from the Buffettology group
- those chicken littles who whine on, but never step up with a stock pick that
they are committing funds to. Just my opinion. Paul (There-I feel better now

MI is an intriguing stock. I like the internet IPO potential and the extremely
low price to book. I also like the buy out potential. 2 things that bother me:
1. The declining nature of the semi conductor industry and thus their weaker
earnings, and 2. Upon looking at a 3 month chart it looks like they are still
trending lower. It just hit a new low, (12 3/8) a few days ago, and now we are
up almost 33% from there...makes for a shaky buy at this price, (16).

Do you think this is the bottom (12 3/8) or will it go even lower? Do you think
their earnings will start moving back up again like the analyst's are
predicting or are there more problems on the horizon given the sub $500
computer and all?

Paul,

If I understand you right, Value investing means investing in companies, not
the market? That you are satisfied if you've been able to buy into a company at
a low price to it's value and that company provides a good return (PE) on your
investment, it matters little what the market does to the price?

If that's your point, then I agree. Value investing is long term investing
based on company performance and the market price may not reflect this value -
although eventually the value should be realized by the market if you've chosen
wisely.

Yet value investing is frustrating. In the past I bought AMTD at $15.50 and
sold at $29.00 - it's now over $150 (PE over 650). Bought SWS at $16.50 twice
and sold above $27 - it's now over $50 (about 40PE, over 3XBV). I have a long
list of companies I have owned and sold when they went above MY value standard.
The market has pushed them to ridiculous numbers while I sat on a stagnant
portfolio with positions below BV (some at cash) and an average PE around 5. I
hang in there because I feel insulated from market corrections (can they go any
lower?) and the companies I've invested in should provide me with a good
return.

The only bright side is the smaller check I sent to the IRS.

FWIW,
Ron

You are one/two of the refugees I am talking about. Value investing is patient
investing. Anything that dissuades an investor, causes doubt to turn to sell---

confessions (and in defense) of a refugee

I have purchased ICO and TGX (profitably to date) from this group.

But we do have a disagreement .. I believe that investing (and I would claim to
try to be a value investor) is sorta like trying to breed fish in a pond.
Again, you are both interested in the fish and the quality of the pond. It does
you no good to have good fish in a pond that is being deoxygenated.

If I am to believe the perceived sponsorship of this group is the efforts and
strategies of Buffett, then I might point out that Buffett is currently quoted
as having reservations about this market .. he is fishing in other ponds.
Certainly not following your admonitions that "good is good regardless of
current price."

While perhaps a refugee, I would be a citizen (with a different perspective). I
admit I have little to offer in terms of finding (screening) for undervalued
small caps - you guys do that so much more intensively than I ever could. But
you are again wrong to suggest that I have not bought stocks (and thanked
people here for guidance).

And finally you are correct. Most of my postings are about the macro picture ..
especially saying be careful .. there is a potential (perhaps now an actual)
major sea change pending. But, for the most part these are ignored (doesn't
hurt my feelings at all) and are lost in continual analyzing individual
options.

A lot here depends on the new CEO, but I get the impression he's making the

Mike,

I found an article that said that Borders expects to lose about .24 this year
from its online business. This means that the valuation based on EPS, ROE, and
PE for the stores alone is more impressive than it looks.

I have no idea what the online business is worth or whether it will eventually
make money, but in this environment it probably has big value. (even if it is
not deserved)

I am starting to like this idea a bit. I wish the company would signal some
intention to spin off a portion of the internet business. It would bring in big
money and they could still remain a player.

No no no. The Borders website exists already, and it is under the control of
Borders, so there is no new competitor created. And you don't spin it off, you
sell 20% of the stock.

Mattel ran big today because it is about to do exactly that. I think Mattel is
still a buy, even 50% above the bottom. Visit Mattel's website, and I think you
will find as I did one of the most intelligently structured web strategies a
"stodgy" company has produced. And it is profitable. (don't get me wrong - the
internet is not the reason Mattel is a buy, but its certainly a plus) On the
conference call today, the reason Mattel is planning a partial-IPO emerged.
Obviously they think it will goose the stock, but there is another reason. They
want to acquire online assets. You don't do that with Mattel stock. But if the
Mattel.com stock were to go to insane levels, it becomes an acquisition
currency. That's what they're thinking.

I read something about AMR last week - I can't recall where, that said if
you're a company with a subsidiary that has an internet business that may trade
for more than the parent company is worth, YOU SELL IT NOW.

3) live off the float .. they get their money now, suppliers in net 30 (I think

>>Why would Borders spin off its Internet business? Wouldn't that be like

I wouldn't recommend they spin off the entire business. But they indicated
through their statements that they are not extremely high on the online
bookselling business. On the other hand, the stock market is frantic about
anything that starts with "E" or ends with "com". So they could probably get an
obscene amount of money for a portion of their business that they do not expect
to be anywhere near as valuable as the market might offer. The cash received
could then be used to fund all sorts of other value enhancing things. It's just
a thought that I would consider.

result in the creation of a new subsidiary later this year, a portion of which

You went wrong from the very first step. Online booksellers compete on price
only. It's a commodity world. Borders competes on environment, location,
timeliness, and has IMO the most comprehensive selection of any bookstore, if
not music store. They are profitable and growing, and will continue to do so.
They are just now expanding internationally. Meanwhile Amazon loses more the
more it sells because it cannot raise the bar on the online price war that it
started. Borders is profitable and growing despite its higher prices.

really?

1) are you saying borders has a natural advantage in that it makes money and
amazon is destined to always lose money -- an interesting supposition. Let me
see if I have this right -- borders can incur the expense of building/leasing a
store, obtaining and maintain inventory, hire local sales staff (all of which
amazon does not incur) and still make money by selling each book for more;
while amazon is losing money because they locked into a market strategy of
buying market share by selling at a loss

2) That is an insight - then amazon loses more money the more books they sell.
(Think of all those embarassed analysts and investors who overlooked that basic
flaw and did not know they were dead from the start.)

How does that work. Amazon usually discounts perhaps 25% from publishers
recommended price (stamped on book jacket) - are you saying this markdown minus
operating costs (no buildings, no inventory, less employees) precludes them
from making a profit.

3) let my suggest (made it up) that books are not a very elastic market
(certainly not a growth market) and that amazon is eating into the total number
of books sold through other outlets. (Do we know if the number of books per
year sold is increasing or decreasing. Is book selling a growth market or a
battle for market share) ...

if the former borders must generate sales because of its presence (increase
total book sales) or if the latter steal share from a competitor .. both hard
to do and very much harder to steal share.

4) and before we dismiss all arguments in favor of amazon as being wrong from
the start - let's revisit the question of inventory turns. They are everything
to retail businesses. Amazon does not even have to consider this -- they don't
hold their own inventory* -- they merely compile the lists per day and ship to
the publisher.

* on the other hand, all borders I know have have tables out front with deeply
discounted (nearly free) books they have not been able to move - and racks
(many) inside with books not so deeply discounted.

Further (sight unseen) I bet they get a volume discount -- which would be
greater than borders if their volume orders are greater (do we know which
enterprise sells more units.)

5) Finally even you must find it a little ironic. I mean your support for
borders given that you yourself are an amazon outlet. All anyone needs to do is
visit your site http://www.valuestocks.net/ refer to books you recommend (good
choices) and then hit the imbedded link to amazon.com. While they give up the
ambiance and the coffee, they gain convenience of your store front and your
implicit recommendation -- again at no asset investment, no inventory and very
little personnel costs - other than perhaps some small share to their cyber
business partners. Or is it some nefarious plot to help with their demise by
helping them lose more money by helping them sell more books.

but enough .. all I am suggesting is that borders is not a sure shot ... it is
sailing into troubled waters .. no matter how sure the captain. There have to
be better opportunities ... ones with a moat as opposed to ones with their
walls already breached.

yes. and if amzn does make money, it won't be very much.

If anything, that I openly bash Amazon's business economics while taking
advantage of them by taking an additional 15-30% off their margins for every
book I sell off the site (not that many buy there - it's just a convenience,
really) is a validation that I'm not very biased here.

And yes, when I think of all the analysts and investors that have been wrong
from the start on Amazon.com, it does make me smile.

And it doesn't matter how fast you turn inventory or don't carry inventory if
you do it at as big a loss as Amazon does. Even Blodgett admits it is a gamble
whether Amazon will EVER make money. I don't see any leverage there to raise
prices.

I think Mike is right on the book business.

Here is a personal anecdote. A very nice Barnes and Noble superstore recently
opened about a mile from my house. Fun to browse around, etc. etc. Recently my
wife wanted to buy some CD as a gift. We checked Amazon for some info that
helped us decide we really wanted it, called B&N to be sure they had it in
stock, and went there to buy it, paying list. The AMZN price savings less S&H
was not a big deal, we wanted it right away, and it is fun to go there.

M&B.A,

Every now and then it is good to hear the bullish argument for AMZN <g> but I
do not believe that they are in exactly the same business as BGP. Having
recently bought books at Borders, Barnes and Nobles and Amazon.com I've
realized that there are specific instances for each. If I hear of a book on NPR
that sounds interesting and can live without it for a few days, or if I'd like
to send a gift to someone out of town I buy through Amazon. If it is a rainy
Sunday morning but the family feels like getting out of the house we go to
Borders. Do not dismiss the coffee and sandwiches so easily. A recent trip
resulted in the impulse purchase of the food, a small book on gardening, a CD
and a teen beauty magazine (um...not for me). And if I want to read in relative
solitude I go to Barnes and Nobles which is across the street from Borders and
nearly empty because of the poor business they are doing.

That is all anecdotal but the balance sheet is not. I can muse about the
business plan all I want but the fact is that Borders is making money (I will
not argue with the market), is expanding and has one of the most realistic
expectations for the internet that I have seen in a long time (that is a
judgement call of course).

In a way BGP reminds me of Starbucks. Everybody served coffee so Starbucks
decided to charge ~10X the going rate for what they thought was better coffee
and people ponied up. They had excellent management and a plan for growth. Of
course they did not face competition from a company selling coffee over the
internet but I am sure somebody is working on that <G>! But my point is that
price is not everything and when you add S&H it is nearly even.

Here's hoping BGP goes down because my GTC order has not been filled yet :(

Cheers,
John

Mike,

I'm trying to dig a little deeper into Borders because it's coming up for a
vote at my investment club on Monday and because I'm considering it for my own
portfolio (a token stake).

I'm really enjoying the back and forth debate about the business models because
I haven't formed a view yet. I enjoy both the Borders model and the online
(Amazon etc..) model.

I started looking at the last 10K available online (Edgar) and it appears that
the company is quite generous in the stock options area. But there is no
consistent level of grants from year to year so it's hard to know exactly what
the future will hold in this area.
In any event, if they were expensed EPS would be lower by an amount worth
noting.

I think you might want to take a quick look at the footnotes.

The latest numbers aren't out on Edgar yet so I'll have to get back to you if I
can find anything else.

I appreciate your support of borders .. and suspicions re: amazon.

I retreat .. but as a passing riposte -- let me observe that all your arguments
are based on two premises (open to some debate ?)

1) a statement regarding human behavior -- people preferring to buy at a store
vs the net .. despite the time, cost and variety of choice disadvantages.

2) the supposition (conclusion) that amazon is destined to lose money because
they are pricing too low to cover operating costs. Let me ask a question: if
you were border's marketeer, would you trade (immediately) for a condition
where you had no site, inventory or local personnel costs in return for a
promise to sell books at 25% below "jacket price."

Well, I did go ahead and take a position in BGP today.

Didn't think it was a "fast moving market", so I entered a market order. There
was a delay of about 15 minutes when I couldn't get a confirmation and boom,
when it shows up there I got it at 16 3/4, high for the am so far. About a
point higher than I was willing to settle for today, and nearly two points
higher than I had been willing to settle for two days ago. This was 50% my

A beauty of a net-net started to move off a bottom this week. Take a good look
at Lazare Kaplan (LKI), the global leader in diamond cutting and distribution.
Even after a 20% move, it trades below net working capital. That working
capital is predominantly diamond inventory, and DeBeers never lets diamond
prices fall.

There are several catalysts for this stock to run (and by run, I mean double).
Earnings are very leveraged to Japan, and Japan may be showing signs of a
recovery in diamond demand. Second, the company is about to start a JV with
General Electric that could produce a lot of earnings, but will at least get
the company some attention (its what Wall Street calls a "story"). Third, the
stock historically tracks DeBeers. DeBeers has made a 62% move so far this
year, and LKI has done absolutely nothing.

The company is buying back its own shares.

My source on this one is the same guy who called ANGLY (also DeBeers related.)
ANGLY may not be done either.

My average cost is about 8 FWIW.

Near old highs are the best places to short - you have a built in exit. If it

you think could easily fall to 7-10, but limit your loss at 20.

In any case, now I'm playing with the house's money. I just made 30 points in a
