Nice going, Grommit. If there was a time to be on margin, this was it.

Grommit, I'm reviewing posts here on http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TSL . Do you
have an updated opinion on TSL that you can share? I've read Spekulatius'
comment that TSL may be similar to semiconductor makers in that it can be a
competitive business and one where supply catches demand and profits then
plummet.

Business is still sunny though. New plant, new sales agreements. IF profits
hold up, at current price stock may recover from its decline. I'm not prepared
to call TSL a value stock, won't call it a garp stock either.(not enough growth
info. It's only been public for about two years). Maybe a stock that could
revert to higher prices at some point. I am considering entering ~$30 for just
a very few shares.

Solar. TSL.

All I know about TSL is what I read in press releases and news articles. Here's
a pessimistic view.

http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/reinsider/story?id=53389

But that issue is just the USA, and will be addressed next year. I am
underwater TSL and doubled up on my TSL recently. I also own STP and am at B/E
on that stock. These are my most speculative, longer time horizon investments.
Here is a more optimistic clip I saved, but I don't know where it came from:

August 28, 2008, 1:29 pm

Pricing for solar modules in 2009 are likely to drop 10%-15% in 2009, with
supply and demand largely in balance, according to Cowen analyst Robert Stone.

While that sound troubling, Stone notes that there are fears in the market that
pricing could drop as much as 20%-25%, due to an expected sharp reduction in
subsidies in Spain. But Stone sees offsetting factors, including enhanced U.S.
subsidies, rapid growth in Italy and France and the emergence of demand in new
regions, including the Middle East.

Stone sees solar demand of 6GW this year, increasing to 9GW in 2009 and 14GW in
2010. that view reflects his belief that Congress will pass a multi-year
extension of the solar investment tax credit in the first half of 2009, “with
higher residential credits and utility participation.” He says lower prices
should boost demand in Germany, spark growth in Japan. “Italy appears close to
grid parity,” he adds, “while Middle Eastern countries could deploy PV
[photovoltaics] to preserve valuable hydrocarbons for export.”

Stone’s top picks are the thin-film players Energy Conversion Devices (ENER)
and First Solar (FSLR); he’s also recommending crystalline silicon companies
“with stronger supply portfolios,” including SunPower (SPWR), Suntech (STP),
Evergreen Solar (ESLR) and Trina Solar (TSL).

Ultrapetrol (Bahamas) Ltd. (ULTR) is Zacks #1 value pick.

Ultrapetrol is expanding its river system business as commodities shipping
booms. The company reported record revenues in the second quarter as revenues
rose 50%. Ultrapetrol has surprised the last two quarters by an average of
135.90%. It's trading at only 5.1x forward earnings.

http://www.zacks.com/commentary/8632/Ultrapetrol+Bahamas+Limited++863200
From the article"...Value Fundamentals

Ultrapetrol's stock has sold off in recent weeks with the volatility in
commodities prices and the decline in the Baltic Dry Index (BDI). ULTR's stock
is now cheap, trading at only 5.1x forward earnings. Its price-to-book is 1.23.
The company has a one year return on equity (ROE) of 11.46%...."

===============================================================

Stock looks like it is ready to break through it's 50 day moving average after
testing it's two year low. The company secured new financing today that will
allow them to continue to build their river system business.

Ultrapetrol Secures Additional Long-Term Financing
http://biz.yahoo.com/pz/080916/150414.html

has secured $60 million in long-term financing from IFC, a member of the World
Bank Group. Under the terms of the agreement, IFC will provide a $60 million
financing package to UABL and assist the Company in raising an additional $15
million from third parties.

Felipe Menendez, Ultrapetrol's President and Chief Executive Officer, said,
``We are very pleased to have agreed with IFC on this very significant long
term financing which will help us execute our expansion plan in the river
system, where we expect to invest over $200 million in the next three years.''

===============================================================

My long term target (in the next 24 months) is $18-$22 as they execute their
expansion program . Once the price to book and PE begin to increase, I will
begin to peel off shares. Stock could go much higher with PE expansion when
future growth is factored into their price.

WFC - why not short it? It has runs up whilst everything else has been falling
to pieces. they are heavily exposed to he CA market in credit cards, home
equity and some loans have been reclassified as current, even though they are
restructured. I do think they are better but not as much better as the market
values them.

I believe some players knew already about the new short sale rule yesterday as
there was some weird trading in financial going on then which tempted me to
enter the short position again before close. Of course I sort of felt trapped
when the rule was announced but felt it was a matter of pride to close this one
out with a profit as well.

the bad thing about the WFC short was that it took my focus away from
opportunities that could make some nice money, Some weird trades going on - I

WFC - I am not shorting expert at all, but IMHO you never short strong
companies. Even if they fall, they always fall last and when they bounce, they
usually bounce faster and higher. Of course, these are just general
observations. Other reasons are that you just suspect that they are having
problems. Now, if you are right about the problems, then the short is smart
thing to do. But if you are wrong - and the last quarter results were great, so
it's not obvious that they have a lot of problems - then you would be in a lot
of hurt.

Also, I did not kid about Buffett. Why would you insist to be on the other side
of his trades, I am not sure. He owns large chunk of WFC, he is buying more, he
knows the management, he knows the risks much better than any of us could even
imagine. Sure, he cannot buy the whole bank, but make no mistake: WFC and USB
did not collapse partially because all hedge funds know that it is risky to go
against Berkshire. If either of these banks came under serious pressure,
Buffett would provide any capital needed in a blink (unless there was
negligence or fraud, but this is unlikely). IMHO, it is not smart to play short
where the bottom is set not by herd market, but by someone like Buffett. WFC is
not going to zero unless Buffett decides otherwise. And shorts for 10-15% gain
is just children's play - unless you are professional trader and only spend
time on this.

Finally, you say: felt it was a matter of pride to close this one out with a
profit as well. This just shows gambling and ego. Both of which cost a lot in
markets. ;) Beware. :)

you could be wrong that WFC was a poor choice as a short

I could. I am not an expert shorter. In fact, I don't short period. :)

Apparently my timing was poor, but it is indeed overvalued.

There are couple things to discuss in this sentence.

First, IMHO WFC is just fairly valued, but not overvalued. You may think
otherwise.

Second, even overvalued does not necessarily make a good short. For shorting
you need the stock to fall and preferably fast. Overvalued stocks can still
rise or just tread water.

Finally, timing is indeed everything in shorting. That's why I would think that
TA guys make a much better shorters than fundamentalists. But that's just my
opinion.

WEB could have bought had over fist when it went to 20$ but he did not.

How do you know that he did not? Did he tell you? He actually said in the
interview that he is buying either WFC or AXP this quarter. You wanna bet on
50% chance that it was AXP?

So in short, sure, WFC can drop significantly from here. I would say that the
chance of this happening is not that big.

And you strike me not as a pro short but rather as a fundamentalist who gets
discouraged and upset that shorts get all the money while he is left on a side.
Most of the time such people just lose money when they think that they can do
the same as the shorts they read about in newspapers. Usually it ends up badly.
I've seen it in many variations. People think that their approach does not work
anymore and they try something that appears to work magically well for others.
Momo, TA, tech stocks, RE flipping, shorting, etc. And the fact is they have no
clue of how the other thing works, so they get burned. Buffett and other people
said more than once that success in investing is being able to stay
disciplined. I would not say anything if I thought that you have a strategy for
shorting that you really want to figure out what works and does not work in
shorting. But my feeling is - and correct me if I am wrong - this is emotional
and ego driven and sidestep gambling "I won't lose much" thing for you. Which
is dangerous.

But as I said before. You are welcome to do what you want. You may even be
successful in this particular short if/when you attempt it again. Good luck.
Peace. :)

Investors Flee Money Funds,
Moving Cash to Safer Spots
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122178512930354917.html?mod=googlenews_wsj

From the article:"...Departing holders of Reserve Primary Fund could get out
Monday at the full $1 per share, Tuesday at 97 cents and after that would have
to wait, and may receive much less. A representative for The Reserve said the
net asset value hasn't been calculated since Tuesday.

Some of the money in the Reserve fund and others is tied to mutual funds'
securities lending. Another source of fund money comes from "sweep accounts,"
through which brokerage customers' spare cash is automatically deposited in a
money fund.

That was the case for Rob Hotchkiss, 47 years old, a founding member of the
Grammy-winning band Train. He has about $52,000 stuck in Reserve Primary,
because of his sweep account with broker TD Ameritrade Inc. "How much money can
I end up losing here?" he asked. A spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade said it is
working with The Reserve to redeem client assets...."

=================================================================

I was lucky with my account at TD Ameritrade. The sweep account I set up for my
money fund WAS NOT their "Reserve Primary Fund" (which paid a higher rate) but
an FDIC guaranteed money fund.

Many of the TD Ameritrade customers had the Reserve Primary Fund set as their
default "sweep" account and their funds are presently frozen.

I get a much lower rate (1/2 of 1%) with their FDIC "sweep" Money Fund but the
money is available immediately. I usually electronically ACH my funds after
settlement to anyone of four different money fund accounts I have including my
credit union (3.2%) or 100% treasury funds at Schwab (closed to new investors
1.17%) and at Vanguard (1.74%).

Just to explain my goals of this WFC and shorting discussion. First, I tried
maybe understand a bit more what shorting works and what does not. Also whether
it is possible to be successful short as a value investor and how. (This has
been discussed previously on this board with no good conclusion IMHO). I have
some ideas about this but so far I have always felt that I did not have a good
strategy on what and when to short to be successful. I don't think this has
changed.

Another thing that I was looking at is going outside the limits of your
investment approach. For me, this has been successful when I planned to make
such "excursion" an additional approach that I use constantly and I have a
strategy for. It has been a disaster when I just tried to do "something that
works for others" for quick buck. The success story is how I moved into
investing in below NCAV/cash/book small caps. This was something that I was not
comfortable with, but now I think I understand what works in this area and how
to invest using this method.

The failures have been options (way back when in ~1999-2000), some (mostly
international) story stocks where I had no clue how to value the stock
suggested by other people. Overall story stocks seem to be very dangerous if
one buys the story often not even fully understanding it. Even worse if one
forgets or relaxes valuation discipline for it.

There have been some washouts or near misses: homebuilders last year (although
I learned a lot from the experience), Fannie Mae preferred this year - I almost
bought it on very convincing story of a friend, temptation to short BSC at $5
or so when it was being taken over for $2 for "free money" (deal was revised to
$10 as you know and it would have been "free loss" ;)), some materials and
energy stocks this year. If I had only one thing to say to myself or any other
investor, it would be that you just HAVE to follow your discipline and buy what
you know and what falls into your model. Going outside the framework usually
just leads to losses.

it seems to me that there is a lot of inside information on there that
frequently reflects itself in the market price. this makes it very difficult
for value players. my current dilemma is the disconnect between the price of
aig common stock and the price of the subordinated debenture that I own avf.
the price of BSC at $5 when a takeover at $2 was announced was a glaring
disconnect. the high dividends on many shares that I own either means that the
dividends are not sustainable or alternatively that the market has panicked. I

Some scattered thoughts on financials:

Barron's has an article about financial stocks. Stated that WFC and USB are
overvalued. Possible picks: STT and BK (both mentioned here) which are strong
in asset management.

LYG - checked out LYG some more. Core equity ratio is 5.9% which is not that
great. They purchased HBOS at a 57% premium to their depressed market price on
9/18. LYG seems like a decent bet even though the situation with respect to RE
is just as bad (or worse) than in the US.

AIB - core Equity ratio 6.5%. Decent results but (weaker, IMO) archrival IRE
just cut their dividend in half. Irish RE is in freefall and since it's just a
big part of the overall economy (much more so than in the US) it's taking the
whole economy with it. Still AIB might be a decent bet, they are decently
capitalized, own a good franchise in Poland and some not so good assets in the
US that they may dispose of

For comparison WFC's Core equity stands at 7.4%.

thanks for the link.

BILL MOYERS: So who do you trust anymore? I mean, you write in your book that
the most worrisome thing is the extent of official understatement and
misstatement, the preference for minimizing how many problems there are and how
interconnected they are.

KEVIN PHILLIPS: Well, just to give you an example of how many there are, Alan
Greenspan has finally decided to admit, you know, this may be one of those
once-a-century biggies. Well, what makes it fascinating is that I sometimes use
the description "seven sharks." There are seven sharks in the tank with the
economy.

1. And the first is financialization because we're so dependent on this
industry that's sort of half lost its marbles.

2. The second is that you have this huge buildup of debt, absolutely
unprecedented anywhere in the world.

3. The third is you've now got home prices collapsing.

4. The fourth is you've got global commodity inflation building up.

5. The fifth is you've got flawed and deceptive government economics
statistics.

6. The sixth is that you've got what they call peak oil where the world is, to
some extent, running out of oil. So it's not just commodity inflation, it's a
shortage of oil.

7. And then the last thing is the collapsing dollar.

Now, whenever you get this sort of package in one decade, you got a big one.
And when Greenspan says it's a once a century, I think it's another variation
but on a par with the Thirties.

I guess all treasury funds are not the same. They must have had a large portion
in repurchase agreements (for treasuries) which became ill-liquid. Vanguard has
a 100% treasury fund has no repurchase agreements. It's possible that some of
the paper they had was with Lehman and was frozen when they filed bankruptcy.

The best approach is to have a few money accounts including an FDIC insured one
that are linked with ACH transfer option.

I have been raising cash and distributing the proceeds among these accounts.
Long term I am eying more oil and natural resource companies and foreign
country themes that have hard assets and would benefit from a falling dollar.

Liquidity must still be very tight especially where an "All Treasury" fund gets
frozen. I like to hold very large funds (Vanguard or Fidelity) as they have a
much larger pool of investors to draw from.

Many investors got hurt from the Schwab Yield Select Fund which lost 30% of its
value from it's investment in CMO's last year. There was a panic run on the
fund and the fund manager was forced to sell these CMO's at a sizable loss. The
fund was just too small with too many very large account holders. When the
large account holders exited, there was not enough liquidity available w/o
selling the underwater paper. The Schwab Yield Select Fund had only 5-6 Billion
in total worth. The Vanguard Treasury fund has over $600 Billion. It's almost
100x larger.

We are in interesting times now. Capital preservation is key.

email #1 from ameritrade:

Thank you for the email. We apologize for the incorrect and unhelpful customer
service. I will attempt to answer all of your questions. I am answering
specific questions for the account ending in 1635. Two issues need to be
addressed.

First, on September 17th, the Reserve money market funds "broke a dollar." This
means that one share in the money market was no longer worth one dollar. When
this happened TD AMERITRADE liquidated client holdings in the Reserve money
markets and withdraw all client assets. When this was done, one share was worth
approximately .97 cents. Due to the enormous amount of withdraws from the fund
the Reserve was not able to redeem shares immediately as was normal. The
Reserve has said that redemptions will be made within seven business day, from
the 17th, but this date is not ensured, nor is the redemption amount. This
means that we do not yet know what the redemption rate will be, nor do we know
when the settlement date is. This is an unfortunate situation for everyone
involved, but TD AMERITRADE acted with our clients best interests in mind and
sought to limit further losses in the Reserve money markets. We are awaiting
further notification form the Reserve funds regarding settlement date and
redemption rate.
You had two reserve funds on your account. One is RUTXX and the other now has a
"contra CUSIP." The first had 206.41 and the second had 4,760.33. These funds
are not available at this time, and no new investments are being allowed into
the funds.

Going forward, your account has been assigned a new money market account which
is a Money Market Deposit Account that is held at a bank and the Reserve. This
money market will be your sweep vehicle until further notice.

Secondly, I am assuming you are referring to your sell orders on Genworth, both
of which were entered on 9/19/08. These trades are set to settle on 9/24/08.
Now, the reason the funds were not immediately available to reinvest is because
the buy side on Genworth, entered in on 9/18/08, had not yet settled. It
settled on 9/23/08. As the buy side has not fully settled the funds or proceeds
are available to reinvest. Now that buy side has settled, you are able to
reinvest or withdraw the proceeds from the sale.

Put simply, nobody with a cash account can reinvest the proceeds from the sale
of a stock, or withdraw them, until the buy side on the particular stock has
settled. This is the Federal Reserve settlement period rule which dates back to
1934. This rule is not negotiable and is applied to every buy or sell order
that is executed.

I hope this helps and answers your questions. Please feel free to contact us if
you need clarification or have additional questions or concerns, have a great
day.

email #2 from ameritrade:

Thank you for your email. I sincerely apologize if any information you received
earlier was confusing or misleading. Upon review of your account ending in
1635, I do show that you have fund in the Reserve Funds US Treasury Funds Class
R. This fund still stands at $1.00. You also have $206.41 in RUTXX: RESERVE
FUND US TREASURY FUND which still maintains an NAV of $1.00. However, to redeem
this, you can enter an order, but please be advised that we are not able to
guarantee an execution with the current conditions.

THE SAGA CONTINUES- in my email response i have asked them to formally request
redemption of these funds and to provide to me written proof that they have
done so. This is the first time they have ever told me that I need to request
redemption of a money market account so there may be more to follow;

Brazil's Central Bank Reduces Reserve Requirements

An initial indication of the policy change which may be in the works came
yesterday with a decision by the central bank to ease requirements for reserves
that banks must keep at the central bank. In principle the decision is a
response to the volatility in global financial markets following the
uncertainty produced by the deepening of the financial turmoil in the United
States.

Banco Central do Brasil have decided to delay the introduction of higher rates
for mandatory deposits from leasing companies by two months and raised the
threshold on exemptions for cash, time and savings deposits, according to a
statement released yesterday. The measures will add 13.2 billion reais ($7.16
billion) to the financial system, the central bank said.

This move quite possibly represents an initial reversal of the central bank's
policy of slowing domestic lending growth. Central bank policy makers began to
tighten reserve requirements on cash deposits from lease underwriters last May,
a move that was intended to remove as much as 40 billion reais from credit
markets. Bank lending had climbed by a 33 percent annual rate in the 12 months
ended July, following a 27 percent rise in 2007. The central bank will release
August figures on Sept. 29.

Under the new rules, a reserve requirement of 20 percent of cash deposits from
lease underwriters will now take effect on January 16, two months later than
originally scheduled. The reserve requirement will then increase to 25 percent
in March, according to the present central bank policy. Leasing is a common
practice in Brazil, and effectively constitutes an alternative form of bank
lending. Also under the new rules Brazilian banks will only have to keep part
of their cash, time and savings deposits at the central bank if the reserve
requirement exceeds 300 million reais, the central bank said. Previously, this
threshold was 100 million reais.

The Real Continues To Wobble In The Wake Of Uncertainty

Brazil's real yesterday reversed earlier gains, falling on concerns the $700
billion U.S. financial system rescue may be delayed. The currency declined 0.5
percent to 1.8567 per dollar at 3:50 p.m. New York time, following the
effective end to the day's trading in Brazil. The currency had earlier risen by
as much as 1.4 percent following the announcement that Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway was going to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs Group.

Brazil's real has been the biggest loser against the dollar among the 16
most-active currencies this month, declining by 12 percent. My view is that
this volatility in the real will continue until the US financial markets
stabilise, then, when the dust settles, we will really be able to see what the
new global financial landscape looks like, but I am far from being pessimistic
about the consequences for sound emerging markets like Brazil, au contraire,
this is a developed markets crisis, not an emerging markets one. At the end of
the day it is not unreasonable to imagine that some of the key emerging markets
will be the net beneficiary of the turmoil, after all the uncertainty dies
down.

Re CSCO(S 23.79$) , OKE (36.52$) PCP (82.32$)
PCP - i bought a starter in PCP as well today so Paul does not have to bicker
about the stock all by himself <g>.

Sold CSCO which has done OK to free some funds. I am somewhat concerned about
this sector especially the Capex of financials and telcom companies. (which are
significant buyers of CSCO stuff). Some weaker player already have problems.

OKE is a fairly safe (IMO) infrastructure play - mostly gas midstream and
transmission. 4.2% yield helps. No energy trading as far as I can tell. Debt a
bit higher than I like because of lookthrough accounting for OKS (they own 48%
and the GP).

UTX suspiciously weak. They might be vulnerable to slowdown ?(elevator

PCP. Thanks. Always nice to have somebody else to talk to who has the same

Positive PCP article here:

My initial impression of Precision Cast Parts is of big castings, Wyman-Gordon
big fuselages. (Sorry I didn't keep PCP when they bought WG, which I held.)
It's the other businesses - industrial gas turbines - that now seem to grab my
attention:

“Our aerospace business continues to see strong and steady demand across the
base OEM and aftermarket programs,” said Mark Donegan, chairman and chief
executive officer of Precision Castparts Corp. “With our significant content on
the 787 and A380 platforms, we would also expect growth to accelerate as these
schedules ramp up to full production. In addition, we have further
opportunities to grow our market position, especially in our fastener business.
And, as we grow, we will continue to leverage sales through greater
efficiencies and improved performance across our operations.

“On the power front, IGT demand is putting significant pressure on our
manufacturing facilities, and that will continue for the next several quarters
until our new facilities come on line,” Donegan said. “International markets
are currently driving this heightened level of activity, but North America is
expected to need additional capacity in the future. Our extruded pipe business,
which supports both coal and natural gas installations, is also operating at
historically high levels. Sales in the first quarter increased more than 50
percent over last year, while the backlog now exceeds $900 million.

Here's a presentation I've come across now. I'll look at it tonight.

http://www.precast.com/docs/BofAm_COLOR_09-16-08.pdf

At current price and value -- p/e --, and with its business in growing markets,
the company and stock should do okay over next couple of years, assuming no USA
or international depression. Seems an obvious buy though if country/world
muddle along. Well, imo, although I've been wrong many, many times.

Well...if we're seeing another 1972-1974, company might still be profitable and
p/e still get chopped from 11-13 to 5-7. And if nobody wants stocks anymore
because of the financial crises - which seems possible or actually to be

UTX. Why now? Because stock is trading at at about a 2 1/2 year low, and it's
time to buy: it's become a value stock from whatever it was before --
growth/garp. (This of course, jmo.)

Profit margins are at 7-8%, and they've been around that level for several
years. Consistent. What relationship, if any, does "profit margins" and/or
"operating margins" have to the price someone is willing to pay for the stock?
Other than to say, for example, yeah high profit margins likely mean people
are/should-be willing to pay more for the company, and if the company has low
profit margins (excluding high sales/sh companies like grocers) we will
intuitively value it less. I have a formula that I use. UTX falls within it as
a buy. (Of course in this market, many companies, maybe too many, qualify. -g-)

P/e of this company 11-13 is lower now than any average number of the past ten
years. High goodwill perhaps, but stated book value has increased every year in
at least the past ten, and p/stated bk (2.6) is now lower than the average of
any year in past ten (lowest year was 3.3). Dividend seems to increase every
year.

Considering two statements: 1) "high goodwill resulting in almost zero net
tangible assets. High debt compared to tangible assets.." , which is followed
by 2) "There are much better companies". If there's an implied "so therefore"
between 1) & 2), what megacap companies do you see that appear to offer better
opportunities? My opinion is that with UTX we're dealing with a consistently
profitable, huge, diversified, over 200,000 employee company at an attractive
p/e. Jmo of course, but I don't see "zero net tangible assets" and/or "high
debt/tangible assets" is a significant cause for worry or even very relevant at
this time in trying to value the company stock or to measure success of this
company going forward. Perhaps I am wrong. I intend though to continue to add
to my few shares if/as stock drops and there's no adverse news forthcoming.

Report: JPMorgan to acquire WaMu deposits, some of its branches

NEW YORK (AP) -- The Wall Street Journal is reporting that JPMorgan Chase & Co.
has struck a deal to acquire the deposits and some of the branches of
Washington Mutual Inc., which has been battered by soured mortgages.

The paper, citing people familiar with the matter, says the deal brokered by
the government will not impact the FDIC insurance fund.

The Seattle-based thrift, the nation's largest, has roughly $310 billion in
assets and was searching for a lifeline after a credit-rating downgrade further
raised questions about its future.

Calls to JPMorgan and WaMu spokesmen and federal regulators were not
immediately returned.

Hi Spekulatius - I was lucky as I sold all of my WM and C to book a small tax
loss late last year (Dec 2007). I put most of the proceeds into the Financial
Select Sector SPDR (XLF) (which pays a pretty good dividend) but now I have a
25% loss which I hope to recoup longer term.

What banks finally survive will probably be profitable. It will take quit a bit
of time before any type of lending activity gets to where it was in the past
few years. That is why I plan to close my long term position in NYB (my only
bank company in the portfolio other than XLF). This is one of my top 5 holdings
representing 5% of the portfolio. I have a small gain at current prices but
think I can find a better place for the money.

I am concerned that any new lending (where available) will require higher
lending requirements and be more difficult to obtain. This will slow overall
economic growth.

Companies that can organically grow using their strong balance sheet and excess
free flow cash should be good value targets. These types of companies generally
include software and service companies. HWP purchased EDS which added
significant cash flow to their balance sheet.

I am going to try to identify companies that do not require any outside
financing to grow their business. I plan to also look at those companies that
are buying back their own shares.

Some of the names on my watch list include MSFT and ORCL.

Any ideas?

I disagree on the banks - I think survivors will do really well in 5-10 year
timeframes. Competition will be decimated, they will merge a lot of branches
and get a lot of benefits of size, while starting a new bank will be tough and
even the conventional banking will bring a lot of profits. So I will stay in
BAC, WFC and perhaps reenter USB + maybe GS and JPM.

But MSFT and ORCL are probably good bets too. Both of them may somewhat benefit
by credit crunch hitting the intermediate size tech companies that need money
to grow and can't get VC funding or IPO. In fact, BDCs already are in a crunch
and they do fund some tech companies (although perhaps inferior ones).

I would like to see MSFT to become more like IBM though, since I think they
will have difficulty in maintaining Windows/Office market share although both
of these will be significant cash cows for foreseeable future. Somehow MSFT
needs to get more of a culture where even smaller parts have to be profitable
and on top of their game. Right now, although I understand the importance of
fight of MSFT in web and music player spaces, I am not very happy about the
resources poured there with little return. There are some parts of MSFT that
have that culture though.

In short, I hold MSFT. I never bought ORCL, but I think Paul was right to buy
it. In fact, I probably would prefer both ORCL or MSFT to his UTX purchace (to
answer his question about what high margin mega caps I would prefer ;)). I
still like GRMN in tech area and CSCO is also not that expensive. GLW is
perhaps more crapshoot although cheap.

think the boom/bust HK RE is just going into a bust, China is probably the
same. Still with less then 20% debt, they will survive.

Another one is Henderson Land 0012.HK. NAV value (per annual report) 60HK$,
trading at 36HK$.

good. This is just another datapoint in favor of this theory.

There are indeed a lot of Chinese stocks trading below NAV or NCAV. I guess the
risks are: their accounting, whether they won't dilute by selling stock or
preferred under NAV/NCAV and whether they will take longer to recover, since
there may be fewer takeovers in companies largely controlled by insiders.

I do have some medium to largish positions in a few (LTUS, CHME, KONG, HRAY,

regulatory actions were of the treasury.

EKS. Not happy with what I see now regarding a couple of Brazilian companies
and their exposure to - and losses from - USA debt instruments as they
apparently have tried to adjust for currency fluctuations between dollar and
real.

Strange that two companies would being reporting today that they have senior
managers going beyond company control limits.

It's very painful for SDA and ARA stockholders now. (That'd include me with a
position in SDA and a smaller holding in ARA.) Very unexpected - which shows
how the USA financial crisis can pop up in surprising ways and places.

WM. I bought a package of these 'troubled' financials betting that not all will
go bk and that the survivors would eventually have stock prices that would make
up for losses on the losers.

That idea doesn't seem to be working too well. WM is now essentially bk, and
NCC, which I also have, seems heading that way pretty quickly too.

Hi PauL - I saw the news too. They had some currency derivatives blow up and
"poof" 15% of the company disappears.

http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aB3HHaTgcr4U&refer=home
Aracruz tumbled 14 percent, the most this decade, as its chief financial
officer resigned. Sadia erased a quarter of its value after losing 760 million
reais ($410 million) from currency trades and firing its head of finance.
Votorantim Celulose e Papel SA fell the most since April 2000 after UBS AG said
demand is ``unfavorable.'' B2W Cia. Global do Varejo led a drop in retailers
after JPMorgan said demand in Brazil is weakening.

=================================================================

I was aware of ARA and VCP's currency hedges and they actually made money from
their hedges over the last few years. They used the derivative(s) to hedge
their U.S. $ debt vs their income denominated in Reals.

My other Brazilian stocks do not use such hedges but both GGB and Ultr have
increased their long term financing obligations. I believe they are pegged to
LIBOR and are in U.S. dollars. Therefore there is some exchange rate risk but
only amplified if they use currency derivatives to hedge this risk. ULTR also
uses FFA (Forward Freight Agreements) to hedge the spot bulk shipping rates
against long term fixed rates. This at times works against them but over the
long run should average out the income stream.

I guess the lesson to be learned is that derivatives and hedge contracts are
not necessarily bad but must be managed and NOT leveraged. It's hard to believe
that with a two week move in the US dollar that got stronger could wipe out
$410 million in equity. Something smells fishy as this was during the time of
the announced merger of VCP and ARA and new financing was being arranged by JP
Morgen. I wonder if JP Morgen called in their derivatives so they could book
their gain.

FWIW, CNBC reported this morning that the Office of Thrift Supervision saw an
increase in deposit withdrawals at WM and knew that their loan portfolio could
not be liquidated to cover the cash outflow. So they stepped in before there
was a full-fledged panic that would have drained FDIC's coffers.

The WM shareholders and bondholders paid the tab instead.

I disagree; we are now playing "Survivor" where the banks left standing will
grow market share and, hopefully, get access to cheap capital again. Even with
an economic slowdown there will be winners going forward. Someone said today
that the delay in the bailout is strengthening the hand of the JPM's and C's of
the world as they gobble up gems on the cheap.

BBT is one where I have LEAP calls that are already nicely profitable.

I have only nibbled on some long-term calls in BK and BBT, and I have some ING
preferred. It's a bit too soon to name a lot of others yet, but my general
approach in months to come will be to see who is surviving and growing on the
corpses of those who didn't make it.

Eventually I will probably look more for the midsize regional banks that are
beaten down near book value but not suffering with bad balance sheets.

I also own a few other Europeans - IVTJF, DNBHF, NBG, EBKOF.

Good call. I would have sold some as well, but was without a computer for a
couple of weeks.

I did buy some WH. The problem with Chinese stocks is that you never know when
you will get diluted, especially when they are trying to expand their
businesses. Nevertheless it looks like an interesting play. I still own SNEN
and CHNG.OB and have added to those positions. They operate in medium size
cities in China. What is not obvious is that China's medium size cities are the
size of Los Angeles.

I also bought some PRSC on the sad theory that the economy will push more
people into requiring gov. services. The stock has a freefall chart, but I
think there will be some support here. There are certain safeguards in place
for states to continue services in need. You would have to listen to the last
CC to fully understand how this company operates.

I'm also looking at some closed end munis which are trading below NAV.

Jurgis,

I just do not understand why a homebuilder like TOL would be within 10% of its
52 week high.

Maybe they are a survivor, but with such a large housing overhang and prices
that are continuing to fall, drastically in some cases, it just seems to me a
homebuilding recovery is years away, not months like Cramer keeps preaching.
