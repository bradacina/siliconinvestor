paul... thats the most elegant self-deprecating post i've ever read ;)

keep up the good work buddy.... i enjoy reading through the posts here.

i happen to know that the majority of stocks i mention here [if not all] are
stocks that are not of interest to the avg investor.... because they are
generally penny stocks.

one i may add to tomorrow is PPMD. i have been accumulating small blocks for a
year or more. the stock hasnt done anything ...but if/when it does move up ...
its likely to be a home run.

the company's potential lies in its patented stem cell/bone marrow/umbilical
cord blood transport and storage media: VIASTEM.

traditional storage medias contain bovine sera [cow blood] and/or DMSO
[solvent] Viastem is FREE of both.... which means these biological products can
be transported/stored without the potential transmission of prions [prions
being the little buggers resposible for BSE - bovine spongiform encephalopathy
- aka: Mad Cow Disease]

despite all the buzz on stem cells and stem cell stocks and all the hoopla
about Mad Cow -- PPMD manages to fly under the radar and fails to gain the
attention of investors.

unlike many penny biotechs -- they have a decent balance sheet: NO LONG TERM
LIABILITIES and they arent bleeding out the wazoo either.

Lazarus, re Protide

The 10-KSB was an interesting read. Funny to see numbers that aren't in
thousands or millions.

As I read, I kept wondering if they weren't competing against university
researchers. This fear was realized in thier "competition" section, much of
which I've pasted below. I don't like to invest in industries with "bad
competitors". I'd define these are areas where competitors are not trying to
maximize profits or ROE. The winemaking industry is a good example, where so
many businesses are in it for their egos or just their love of wine and the
Napa life. I put the university researchers in this category.

On the other hand, if this industry really takes off, their may be plenty of
room for everyone for awhile and margins would really take off. Combine that
with the low market cap, and there's lots of potential here. I'll have to delve
in deeper before investing.

The cash burn will be high enough next year that I think they'll need more
financing. They talk about a preferred offering; I suspect that will be a
lucrative deal for the VCs and not for the common stock holders.

Dan

Competition
Competition in the biotechnology industry is intense and comes from independent
cell biology companies, major pharmaceutical firms, and university-affiliated
entities both in the United States and in foreign countries. Certain of these
companies have extensive experience in the biotechnology industry and most have
substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, and management resources
than the Company. A significant amount of cell biology activity is carried out
at universities and other not-for-profit research organizations. These entities
are becoming increasingly aware of the commercial value of their findings and
are becoming more active in seeking protection for their technology and
products. These institutions also compete with the Company in recruiting highly
trained personnel.

The Company’s defined serum-free supplements compete with serum and serum-free
growth media products from a number of companies,

For the board's observing pleasure (I hope), I've taken the liberty of creating
a portfolio (actually 2) of the 2004 'picks' posted in response to James'
question. The purpose is not as a contest but for entertainment only. I've only
included 2 stocks for each person (well, no more than 3) so those who posted
longer lists (like Timba, Wallace, Grommit) please feel free to narrow down
your longer list if you'd like me to add yours. And anyone (Paul) who wouldn't
name a specific stock will have their pick added if they'd like (c'mon Paul,
its for entertainment only). Finally, I will delete the pick if anyone asks
(although they were all posted in a public forum).

The fine print: I own some of these stocks, will likely buy others in the
future, and may sell any or all at any given time. I would assume these
statements apply to everyone else here.

Safe pick that I would consider investing 25% of my portfolio in still with
good capital gains potential: TMR. I actually have 20% invested here and would
like it to run up so I can cut it back some. [If I was entering here I would
limit it to a normal position (<5% for me) as there is more risk at $6 then
there was at $3 and $4 where I accumulated most of my shares.] Good natural gas
play, low production costs, rapidly improving balance sheet. I believe the
natural gas story (that average NG prices above $3.50 per mcf are with us for
the next several years), and have faith that TMR can significantly increase
production in 2004.

High risk\ high reward pick: CORV - bought Broadwing at a good price and is
shooting for cash flow neutral by mid 2004. Minimal debt. CORV original
business of telecom equipment is hibernating (but telecom equipment market may
recover in 2005/2006)

HIgh risk honorable mention pick: SATC (Fuel cell\ UPS related pick, that got

I'm not going to put any options in - I don't know if an SI portfolio can track
those? Also, there are 2 reasons for limiting to 2 per person - first, that was
James' original question and second, if 20 people posted 7 picks and we put

Just kidding but it would be more work and less manageable. Also, as I said I
don't look at it as a contest. At least not in the traditional on-line stock

HAFC. I am continuing to build a small position with more small buys today.

Part of my buying is psychological or emotional. Missed EWBC so many, many
times over the years. Watching, seeing, understanding, but... not ever buying.
Grrrrrr. And I missed out on a second Chinese-American bank as well. (arghhh)

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=EWBC&t=5y

I decided to make a small, exploratory bet on PUBB when the price looked
attractive. I exited it way too soon though.

There aren't that many ethnic-based/ethnic-catering banks left (that I know of)
that are available that trade at a somewhat reasonable price. I figure HAFC may
be my last chance in the sector. With HAFC, I intend to be in for the long
haul.

Rationally, the stock may not be bargain-priced. Perhaps it's best to wait for
the inevitable rise in interest rates, which, in past, has often dropped the
price of bank stocks to provide buying opportunities. As I say though, I come
to this particular stock with some baggage, so my opinions, purchases,
enthusiasm, determination, whatever - are clouded by that -g-.

Paul Senior
aside: I realize Korean-Americans, Chinese-Americans, Vietnamese-Americans,
etc. can each point to their culture as being distinct from any other culture.
As regards banking, I just believe ethnic groups share a similar loyalty and
willingness to do business with people of similar business culture and
language. Just as Chinese-American banks have prospered and continue to do
well, I am betting so too will the Korean-American banks. Plus, not to
ghetto-ise anybody, there's no reason why ethnic local banks can't expand
beyond their otherwise ethnic base. Mainstream American banks often aren't
quick enough or decentralized enough to respond to local conditions, and where
that might be true, it provides opportunities for small local banks regardless
of ethnic background, I would hope.

SCRA dropped to single digits due to the debt load they carried before and
doubts they could refinance it all. Since then, they have fixed the balance
sheet and generated strong cash flow. The market now prices them on assets and
cash flow rather than BK potential.

A good friend of mine turned me on to SCRA in the 6's. He is the same guy who
was buying NFI in the 4's pre-split a few years ago.

If we are not able to sustain our Millennium voice switching platform revenues,
our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.

We may not be able to sustain our Millennium revenues because the traditional
private branch exchange (PBX) market, which accounts for a substantial portion
of our Millennium revenues, is declining. One reason for the decline of the
traditional PBX market is the emergence of voice switching platforms based on
standard PCs. If we are not able to grow or sustain our Millennium voice
switching platform revenues, our business, operating results and financial

I have enjoyed your presence and thoughts over the years. In terms of what I

For a somewhat risky play I like Elan. I have been in it for a year off and on,
but still like it. They are a turnaround play with a decent pipeline and some
potential catalytic events in 2004.

Otherwise, I like China (usually closed end funds) such as GCH or TDF and I
have had a small investment in Glamis Gold.

The US dollar continues to be way overvalued in relation to commodities and
other currencies imo. But catalysts such as decoupling of Chinese currency to
dollar or pricing of oil in another currency or basket of currencies are
difficult to predict.

In terms of risks, I think if the Fed & Treasury have any sayso, inflation is a
foregone conclusion. The only other alternatives would be a crash in the stock

From:- with a K
Excellent work, Steven. Thanks for creating the portfolio.

FWIW, I thought an article today from Pat Dorsey of Morningstar was
interesting, and I'm curious if posters behind their nominees for James's
challenge think their pick fits into any of these categories.

Snip:

While the obvious investing lesson is simple--you’re generally better off going
against the grain than following the crowd--there's more to be gleaned from the
A's story. After all, Beane bought undervalued traits of baseball players and
sold or avoided overvalued traits, and we can do the same thing in the stock
market.

So, in the spirit of building your own winning set of investing skills, I've
compiled a list of company traits and investing practices that I think are
"undervalued" and "overvalued." Since the heart of investing successfully is
finding inefficiencies in the market, you'd be better off seeking out the
undervalued traits and practices--the ones that most people ignore--and
avoiding the overvalued or popular ones.

Overvalued: Acquisition-fed growth. Undervalued: Internally generated growth.
Wall Street loves acquisitions because they generate headlines and
investment-banking fees. Unfortunately, acquisitions fail to add economic value
more often than not, so look for companies with a quiet, solid track record of
growing through their own efforts.

Overvalued: Initial public offerings (IPOs). Undervalued: Spin-offs. IPOs are
sold to the highest bidder amidst a slew of hype and propaganda, while
spin-offs quietly come to market when a parent firm casts off its unwanted
progeny. Which do you think has the better long-term track record for
investors? Hint: It's the one that no one initially wants, not the one that
everyone clamors for.

Overvalued: Well-known firms in big industries. Undervalued: Leaders in niche
industries. This inefficiency stems from the industry-oriented way research is
done on Wall Street. In order to do a good job researching a company like
Cintas CTAS or Moody's MCO, an analyst has to go out and learn the dynamics of
a brand-new industry. Since there are few other public players in niche
industries, all that research results in just one more stock on his or her
coverage list--whereas an analyst who becomes an exp! ert on semiconductors or
retailing can leverage that industry knowledge into a lot more companies. So,
small and offbeat industries aren’t as well followed, which means more
opportunity for those willing to do some digging. (For example, Moody's and
Cintas are each followed by about a dozen Wall Street analysts, while a
lower-quality firm like Advanced Micro Devices AMD has 29 analysts tracking its
every move.)

Overvalued: What the stock has done. Undervalued: What the company is likely to
do. The market tends to chase hot stocks up, and run away from dogs when
they're sinking. However, the recent short-term performance of a stock has
absolutely no bearing on the future long-term performance of a company. Ignore
what the stock chart looks like over the past few months and spend your time
thinking about whether the company is still healthy, and you'll be a better
investor.

Overvalued: What everyone else is doing. Undervalued: Common sense. Humans are
social creatures, and so we often look for "validation"--we like knowing that
others agree with our courses of action, because then we don't feel quite so
stupid if what we do turns out to be wrong. Unfortunately, being able to blame
everyone else doesn’t make a financial loss go away. So, when common sense
tells you that a stock or industry is priced for perfection or is too cheap to
pass up, don't worry about what the crowd is saying. Listen to yourself,
because you’re the one making the investment.

Overvalued: Retained earnings. Undervalued: Dividends and share repurchases.
There's nothing wrong with a company hanging on to its earnings and plowing
them back into the business; in fact, that's exactly what you want a company
with lots of great internal investment opportunities to do. But companies often
plow money into dubious projects rather than returning it to shareholders. In
fact, a recent academic study showed that companies with high dividend payout
ratios actually had higher subsequent earnings growth than companies that
retained lots of their earnings, which is exactly the opposite result than
conventional wisdom would have expected. Moreover, the tax cut on dividends has
made dividend-paying stocks even more attractive over the past year. (You
wouldn't know this to look at the market, of course, since it has been
speculative stocks that have really led the charge over the past 12 months.)

Overvalued: Flashy businesses that sound exciting. Undervalued: Steady
businesses with wide economic moats. It's easy to get worked up over a company
that unravels the human genome or invents a great electronic gadget, but firms
like these turn out to be flashes in the pan more often than not. Over time,
companies with strong competitive advantages--or wide economic moats--tend to
outperform stocks with weak competitive advantages, no matter how boring their
businesses might be. Long-term stock performance is tied to high returns on
capital, not headline-grabbing products or services. So avoid the flash and go
for the cash.

IMGG and SEMI would be my more traditional value style, double in a year picks.
SEMI in particular is a play on the cycle and not a good long term holding in
my opinion.

I bought BRCD today - it seems a popular potential January effect pick. It will

January effect even though they weren't picked for that purpose.

New Recommendations
I'm recommending JLMC as a safe pick. The only thing that worries me about JLMC
is that I don't really understand why it is so cheap (not trying to be
facetious here). It has a consistent history of earnings, a PE of 9, and is
trading just above book value.

I'm glad someone recommended KDUS. I was actually considering it as a
relatively safe pick (with the huge cash reserve and all) even though it could
double if Icahn makes a savvy investment with the cash.

Some Value Board Recommendations from this year
1. VNWI up about 75% since I mentioned on Value Board, up over 100% since
mentioned on Low Price/Cash Ratio Board.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=19088075

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=18663168

2. SPDE, VYYO, KDUS. SPDE and KDUS up marginally. VYYO a lucky double from my
first Value board post and a lucky triple from my first Price/Cash board post,
although I sold a bit early.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=19097378

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=18851342&s=vyyo

I also had some recommendations on the Low Price/Cash Ratio board (ALPH, IJX,
PARL, etc) that did pretty well too, although a monkey running a price/cash
stock screen would have made a killing in this market. I need to remind myself
to be careful not to confuse brains with a bull market ...

Although I wouldn't put 25% in any stock, my safe pick is WRLD, a far from
glamorous stock in a business that you probably don't want to brag about at
your next cocktail party. Just my kind of stock ;>)

Tomorrow I will post my swing-for-the-fences stock, as it is thinly traded and
I want to take a position first.

WRLD recently written up here:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=19618565&s=wrld

Here's my current Graham FV calculation, using FY05 consensus from two analysts
of $1.69, up recently from $1.65. I also ratcheted back the estimated growth
rate to 14% just to be slightly conservative:

Company: WRLD
Date: 1/1/04
Next year's expected earnings: $1.69
Estimated EPS growth rate: 14
P/E maximum for estimate: 14
Graham Fair Value: $49.97
Current Price: $19.89
$ difference: $30.08
Percent Growth to Fair Value: 151.23%

Other things I like about WRLD:

- nice chart. TA support is strong:

- Yahoo shows two analysts following WRLD. Nice.

- New sources of revenue: WRLD opened or acquired 33 new offices in FY03 and
closed four nonperforming offices. The company plans to open or acquire at
least 25 new offices in each of the next two fiscal years.

- Quicken gives an intrinsic value of $$33 vs. current price of $20, using 15%

Thoughts on this exercise: looking at my portfolio for a safe pick to propose
was fun, revealing, needed, and somewhat quick (I don't have nearly as many
stocks as Paul! ;>)

I upgraded my Graham calculations on each stock that has earnings estimates,
and feel good overall about my portfolio going into next year. I have some exit
strategies for some stocks as they reach my full valuation. Some I may add to
or reduce as this exercise pointed out some strong stocks, IMO.

What follows are my "honorable mention" stocks I considered proposing before I
decided on WRLD.

Symbol is followed by my percent to fair value calculation, along with any
pertinent notes. I'd be happy to share more notes on any of these if anyone's
interested.

BEL: 47% undervalued. Already written up. Undiscovered gem. Edit: my largest
holding at 12% Enough said; it's only a dirt cleaner. ;>)

WM: 144% Gotta still like WaMu at this level. Nice yield. A strong contender
for my "safe" pick but too widely held to double in one year??? Still, a long
term hold and one I sleep well over.

CD: 98% undervalued. Rising estimates. I like the diversity of businesses but
need to reduce the debt.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=CD

Great 1 yr. chart with steady growth of EPS and moneyflow, while PE is below
historic norms:
http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/intchart/frames/frames.asp?symb=aog&time=8&fre
=1

IDR: 115% Only 4 analysts. PE of 16.8 Dale's pick.

JNJ: 69% Too many analysts (22) but continue to think this is the bottom. Great
ROE and margins, reasonable yield. Much unloved at this time, and that's
appealing to me.

STHLY: 45% Another Dale pick. Only 2 analysts, and with divergent estimates.
ROE 24%; ROA 8.1%; growing margins; PE of 13. 2004 Olympics just around the
corner; got a cell phone handy in Athens? Looks good with NAIC growth
principles:
http://www.quicken.com/investments/strategies/?p=STHLY&tag=1

TYC: 86% Rising estimates. A company on the mend making the needed changes. New
board and management team; aggressively about to reduce debt. News snip: "As
the Financial Times reported on its Web site Sunday, David FitzPatrick, Tyco's
chief financial officer, said the company will focus on three areas for cost
cutting, expecting to save $1 billion in purchasing costs, make a $1 billion
improvement in working capital, and save another $1 billion through "Six Sigma"
efficiency programs in factories. Tyco has formed 58 "subteams" to look for
moneysaving synergies across the company's businesses, Fisher said. The
businesses include electronic security services, fiber-optic networks, medical
products, and industrial valves and controls. When FitzPatrick took over as CFO
more than a year ago, each of the more than 2,000 companies acquired by Tyco
had a separate balance sheet."

Internal controls and new leadership in place is leading to improved morale (my
sense); conclusion of CEO trial will help stock regardless of outcome, IMO, but
I hope Koz goes to jail.

I'm guessing most investors are quite wary of TYC, and that's perfect for me!
Nice chart, with growing earnings (albeit in the hole a year ago):

Hi Paul. Thanks for your efforts.

I did come up with one site that gives a tabular summary of various interest

The six month bills are listed about one-third of the way down.

As far as RPM, yes, it's doing quite well. I had too much of the stock, as a
percentage of my portfolio, so I sold almost half of my holdings a few months
ago at about $14/share (if I remember correctly). It was a nice profit for me,

ABC and MCK -
ABC stock has hit some tubulence these days as the VA contract is lost to MCK.
MCK stock is weak as well, it seems that my suspicion about margin erosion in
the drug distribution business may come true.
However on the valuation side, bothe MCK and ABC look attractive, with forward
PE's around 13 and above average revenue (and hopefully earnings prospects) of
10-13%. I also think that the increased problems with forged drugs will play
into the hand of those big distribution companies. I would like to add to ABC

re: SAH. Issues with this company include:

1 Sleazy or illegal business practices (duh! Car dealerships.)

2. Product mix (wrongly reducing inventory of popular domestic trucks)and some
lack of sales/managerial expertise in domestic dealerships (according to 10/28
Dow Jones report). Having the right product mix and being supported by a good
used car/truck market is important. With so many new models and incentives, the
used market was not that strong in '03 (That's my understanding: I'm no expert
though.)

3. Automakers' incentives. Car retailers like SAH were beneficiaries of
incentives - they encouraged customers to step up to more expensive cars they
(the customers) otherwise couldn't/wouldn't buy. Also, where consumers took
cash rebates instead of low financing rates offered by the manufacturers, that
allowed an opportunity for the retailers like SAH to further profit by offering
financing themselves for the deal. Incentives pushed product; it seems to me
that the dealerships profited while the manufacturers seemingly did not.
As you may know the domestic manufacturers (Incentives are much more prevalent
with domestics vs. imports) are trying to wean customers off the expectation of
"dealer incentives". To the extent they might be successful this time, that
might reduce profits of SAH and others.

What SAH has going for it compared to the manufacturers are 1)lack of large
capital base and associated expenditures, and 2)a non-unionized workforce.
These publicly-held dealerships are very diversified - geographically, by
imports and domestics, and by market segment (mix of premium brands vs other).
Also, it's my opinion that there might be some opportunities for consolidation
in the business - mergers, or buyouts of smaller individually-owned
dealerships.

SAH hasn't done much lately. The stock's at $22.57. My last buy was 10/31 @
$21.25.

As I once mentioned here, I have bought several of these publicly-held
companies. They all have most of the same characteristics, and owning a package
reduces the business risks that might be specific to one company. I have GPI,
SAH, UAG. Rightly or wrongly, I passed on two - AN and LAD. The three I have
seem to trade similarly:

Thread, how did you do in 2003? What was your best or worst move? Regrets?
Lessons learned?

Confessions and sharing are good for the soul and helps one learn, I believe,
and I'm not even Catholic! ;>)

I'll go first.

I did 42% last year, and although others at SI smoked that return, I am very
happy with it. Moreover, I feel like I'm making smarter investments.

My best gain, and one that I am quite proud of, was PRX, a beaten up generic
drug company that had a good pipeline, patents, business wins, and a growth
story when I found it in the spring of 2002. Sold my last lot two months ago
for a 214% gain.

Another good pick last year was TVIN in July, picked up somewhere on SI
(Dale?). Sold most of my position for a 145% gain after it started to fall and
I got spooked after it had run so far so fast.

I'm trying to learn to limit my losses; unlike earlier years, my worst sale in
2003 was BRCD (-14%) which I bought for a trade and held an unusually short
time (for me). Of course, there is one position remaining that I stubbornly
hold on that is significantly under water! (IIH, down so far that it's hardly
worth selling.)

Finally, I think the biggest lesson (one that must be a hold-over from the
bubble) is trying not to get spooked or impatient and sell too soon. One regret
in 2003 had to do with stocks I had bought a few years ago and rode down and
waited and waited and then finally gave up on, the who's who of the bull salad
days: AOL, SNDK, CSCO, AMAT. Similarly, I realize my tendency not to buy more
of a stock that has disappointed me, like a jilted lover, when the fundamentals
are actually starting to improve.

Another regret has to do with selling strong stocks too early, sometimes based
on anxiety over a falling chart or a desire to lock in profits or some
temporary negative news: DHB, MRGE, TOL, selling PRX at $53 and $64 on its way
to $75.

Also, I'm learning to trust my analysis when the market seems to think
otherwise. I need to take bigger stakes in stocks I've researched thoroughly
and believe in, or add to positions after a pull-back. Recent examples under 4%
of my portfolio: WRLD, IDR, TYC. CD last year.

Well - i have several portfolio's and deploy different strategies with them. My
portfolio related to most trades posted here returned a fairly mediocre 25%
only, mostly due to my high average cash position of about 45%. In retrospect I
should have gone 100% long and held onto my many winning stocks much longer, On
the other hand, the strategy to take quick profits has provided positive
returns of about 18% p.A with positive returns in any year but 2002, which I
think is an OK return. I try to modify my strategy to hold some of my stocks
with home run potential longer and hope that the wins will make up for the
losers.

Going forward, i think that it will be much more difficult to make money with
buy and hold, so i will stick with trading out of stocks I consider to be
fairly valued and don't have home run potential. I will also stick with my FA
quality criteria (another think that has humbled my return but would have saved
me a lot of money in 2002). I have learned that there does not seem to me a
simple market beating strategy that works in any given time period for me -
what works well in one year may be a bust in the other.
Overall I have learned to ignore the market to a large extend, as I have
pointed out before on this thread, i work to achieve an absolute return
,regardless of the market conditions.

FWIW I also do have a buy and hold portfolio, mostly in foreign equities, that
has returned around 50% this year in US$ but over the last 5 years the return
is less than for my trading portfolio and the volatility was much higher.

Nanotechnology is an enabling technology not a market itself. As a technology
the "Nano" is overhyped because a lot of aspects have been around forever and a
simply an extension of existing technology. The Chip industry is going towards
a nanoscale now but will it create a new market or simply allow the
miniaturization to proceed as it did when the chip structures were in the
micrometer scale?

There has been a buzz about Nanoceramics about 10 years ago - nanocrystalline
materials were supposed to revolutionize ceramics. Now they are available for
some application in cutting tools and such but has it really revolutionized
anything. What it did is slowly improving and replacing existing products and
enhanced productivity for the users.

This is what I expect from the Nanotechnology - it will be an extension of
existing technologies unless someone comes up with a radical new product based
and I don't see that happening right now. I certainly would not invested in any
company solely because it has develeloped "Nanotechnologies" or it has Nano as

Methodology for calculation of return was 12/31/02 balance plus all deposits

I have 4 accounts self-managed at a brokerage:

Breakouts have not really been occurring en masse since the mid-July

market seemed to enter a correction that affected growth stocks. Names would
break above resistance, but were unable to make any headway. I admit that this
rally feels different, but there are no guarantees.

One thing that will indicate a shift in potential is if some of these growth
stocks can break out and advance at least 20% in under 4 weeks. This would
indicate a true, potential leader that is capable of a continued advance rather
than the 'rollovers' we have seen.

The company needs to break its silence.

IF they are in private discussions, its OBVIOUS that they are not really

Bennett Environmental Appoints New Director
Wednesday January 7, 4:19 pm ET

OAKVILLE, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 7, 2004--Bennett Environmental Inc., a
North American leader in the high temperature treatment of contaminated soils
is pleased to announce the addition of former Michigan Governor James J.
Blanchard to the Board of Directors. This appointment was effective December
19, 2003.

Governor Blanchard is currently a Partner with Piper Rudnick LLP, a law firm of
approximately 1,000 lawyers with offices throughout the United States. Governor
Blanchard joined the firm upon the conclusion of his duties as United States
Ambassador to Canada (1993-1996).

During his tenure as Ambassador, Governor Blanchard managed a broad range of
trade, natural resources, environmental and national security issues between
the United States and Canada and provided support crucial to the passage of the
NAFTA agreement. He also spearheaded the new Open Skies Agreement. Prior to his
role as Ambassador, Mr. Blanchard served two terms as Governor of Michigan
(1983-1991) and four terms as a member of the United States Congress
(1975-1983).

"Governor Blanchard brings a wealth of corporate management and international
experience to our Board which will be key assets as our Company goes through
dramatic growth in the North American environmental remediation industry over
the next several years," stated John Bennett, Chairman and CEO of Bennett
Environmental Inc. "His innovative approaches to such issues as environmental
protection and economic development, for which he won national acclaim, are
particularly important to Bennett Environmental during this critical period of
our history."

Not sure about the investment value but new developments are:
- intelligent house
- broadband satellite communication
- organic LED's and other display technologies
- Digital TV & Radio (Tivo, Xm)

I am not sure where the money is. With OLED's its probably that some of the big
guys are winning (Kodak, Toshiba etc.) the Digital Satellite Radio business
model is unproven and sucks up lots of money. TIVO could be interesting if they
are winning the IP war, if not it's just going to be another commodity product
like a VCR on the hardware side and a nice side business for content

Re CD fair value: using the Graham calculation explained in
http://www.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker01103 I came up with the
98% undervalued calculation.

Company: CD
Date: 1/4/04
2004's expected earnings: $1.61
Estimated percent EPS growth rate (7 analysts): 13
P/E maximum used for estimate: 13
Graham Fair Value: $44.20
Current Price: $22.27
$ difference: $21.93
Percent Growth to Fair Value: 98.49%

I see CD as a cash generating turn-around story in the making, a growth company
with solid businesses that is undervalued because of its past, worries about
the travel business, and a controversial CEO. Those things will change over
time. I want to be in ahead of them.

Other CD notes:

S&P report Nov. 21: "We see the shares as overly discounted for various
business risks, the company's complexity, and its tarnished past. Accounting
irregularities and errors were disclosed in 1998.

CD generates lots of cash flow. S&P estimates $1.6bil in 2004 to be used for
debt reduction, stock repurchase, and a dividend expected in Q1.

Elephants & Memories
Present-day worries and a past disaster are weighing heavily on Cendant shares
By SANDRA WARD

AT ITS ANNUAL INVESTOR CONFERENCE last week at Manhattan's Grand Hyatt Hotel,
Cendant placed an umbrella by the seat of each of the few hundred investors
expected to attend. It just happened to rain that day. Lately, Cendant has been
getting it right on many fronts, and taking care of investors in other ways.
The giant consumer-services conglomerate, whose brands include Coldwell Banker,
Avis and Howard Johnson, has seen its shares more than double this year, to
$21. Its earnings are likely to be up 40%, boosted by the boom in house sales
and mortgage refinancings that have benefited the company's
real-estate-services group, which accounts for more than 35% of Cendant's
revenues.

Wall Street expects Cendant to make about $1.5 billion, or $1.40-$1.45 a share,
this year, on around $18 billion in revenue. That compares with 2002 net of
$1.3 billion, or $1.04 a share, on about $14 billion in revenue. For 2004,
Cendant is forecasting a 5%-8% jump in revenue, to $18.9 billion-$19.4 billion,
and that's assuming no economic recovery and a big drop in its mortgage
business. Securities analysts expect per-share earnings to come in around $1.60
a share.

Cash flow is plentiful. About $2.5 billion will be generated this year and $2.0
billion-$2.3 billion next. Cendant is using that gusher to pay down debt, buy
back shares and pay out a promised $300 million, or 28 cents a share, in annual
dividends next year. A cache of operating-loss carryforwards keeps the taxman
at bay until 2007. Strides have been made in making its financial statements
somewhat more straightforward by eliminating some of its off-balance-sheet
financing vehicles. Still an acquirer, Cendant's deal making has been decidedly
more restrained. Many expect the credit-rating agencies to raise their opinion
on the company's debt-paying abilities sometime next year, a move that will
lower its cost of capital and provide further enhancement to investors.

All of this is setting the stage for an expected major recapitalization of the
company in 2005, when, free of much of its debt burden, Cendant will be more in
control of its destiny. Company officials openly discuss the likelihood of an
IPO of its high-growth, high-cash flow but non-core financial business, of
which Jackson Hewitt Tax Service is the centerpiece, and they put a value of $3
billion-$5 billion on it. The proceeds could be used to add a regional broker
to its more strategic real-estate business, repurchase more shares and boost
the dividend.

CEO Silverman: "We've been climbing this mountain since April 15, 1998 ...
We're the only company that ever had an accounting fraud and survived."

"We've been climbing this mountain since April 15, 1998, " says Chief Executive
Henry Silverman, sitting in a conference room with his back to Central Park at
the company's sleek Manhattan headquarters a few days after the investor
meeting.

What he's referring to is the fact that long before Tyco, Enron and Worldcom,
there was Cendant. It's been five years since a huge accounting fraud was
uncovered only four months after the December 1997 merger of Silverman's HFS
Corp. with Walter Forbes' CUC International formed Cendant. The meltdown was
massive. And investors were badly burned. On the day after the scandal broke,
Cendant shares fell 46%, wiping out $14 billion in market value, as 108.5
million shares changed hands. The shares crashed to an intraday low of $6.60 in
October, down from the high of $41.69 it had reached 10 days before the company
revealed the accounting irregularities. Silverman and the folks at HFS claimed
to have been hoodwinked by Forbes and his aides at CUC. The company paid $3.2
billion to settle shareholder suits.

Forbes, accused of inflating CUC's earnings and share price, still awaits
trial, along with one of his CUC colleagues, on charges of securities fraud,
mail fraud, conspiracy and insider trading. The trial is scheduled to start in
February in U.S. District Court in Hartford, Conn.

Silverman, meanwhile, still sits astride the sprawling franchiser of
real-estate and travel operations. He is well aware of his rarefied status as
the rare CEO who has survive such a scandal.

Though its business of collecting fees and royalties from franchising its
brands is thriving, Cendant stock remains stuck at levels it reached in July
2001, before the recession and before the terrorist attacks of 9/11. At 13
times next year's estimated earnings, the stock trades at about 75% of the
market multiple as measured by the S&P 500, and to a host of competitors,
including InterActive Corp., Marriott International, MemberWorks, Hilton
Hotels, Starwood Hotels & Resorts and even Tyco International.

"The stock trades at an absurdly cheap price," says Mark Greenberg, portfolio
manager of the Invesco Leisure Fund, who from 2001 through earlier this year
built a position in Cendant at an average cost of $14 a share. "It should trade
at a premium to the market because it will grow earnings faster than the
average company over the next few years."

"It's moving up slowly as the past is being erased, but the past is so profound
here," says Richard Haydon, a partner with Leon Cooperman at Omega Advisers, a
hedge fund that owns five million Cendant shares. He expects the stock to
eventually rise 20%-30% from current levels.

What's weighing on Cendant shares now, in Silverman's view, is what he calls
the "elephants in the room": misguided concerns about the potential impact a
slowdown in mortgage refinancings and real-estate brokerage will have on the
bottom line and confusion about how the financial-services business fits into
the company's overall strategy. He dismisses the slowdown on the mortgage side
by declaring, "This is not Chernobyl." The mortgage company will continue to be
profitable despite the expected slowdown, he says.

Silverman is quick to point out, too, that the mortgage business represents
less than 10% of the cash flow of the entire real-estate group. Improvements in
its travel and hotel businesses, stemming from a stronger economy and greater
operating efficiencies -- particularly in its Budget Group and Avis rental-car
operations -- should provide an offset to any retreat on the real-estate side.

Yet some see an even bigger "elephant in the room" -- Silverman himself, a
slightly built man whose erect carriage and wiry reddish curls give him the
appearance of an alert fox terrier. (One of his jobs as Cendant CEO, he says,
is "head ankle-biter.") A tendency to take credit when things go right yet
fingerpoint and foist blame for missteps doesn't win him high marks among many
investors. And even his biggest fans are put off by his outsized pay, a
combination of salary, bonus and restricted stock, which has continued to rise
over the past five years, even though the stock has struggled for much of that
span.

"It's not one of the best parts of the story," says Barbara Marcin, portfolio
manager at Gabelli Asset Management and steward of the Gabelli Blue Chip Value
Fund.

"He does OK for himself," says Omega's Haydon. "It's a sidebar issue that you
either accept or reject."

Silverman makes no apologies for his paycheck. "I'm a capitalist," he says. "I
believe in free enterprise. It's disclosed in glorious detail in every proxy."
In other words, if you don't like his compensation, don't own the stock.

When a portfolio manager at Janus raised concerns a few years ago about why
Silverman would need more equity in the company -- he owns eight million shares
and options for 40 million -- Silverman addressed the concerns by giving up the
equity grant and receiving increased cash compensation. "Do I think I'm
overcompensated? No." He complains, too, that his total compensation doesn't
match that of the CEOs at many Fortune 100 companies, "most of whom don't have
a track record as good as ours." He cites Citigroup's Sandy Weill as somebody
who receives higher pay. One of his pet peeves, Silverman says, is that CEO
compensation is judged in relation to share price rather than the "metrics it
articulates, like revenue growth, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization growth, and earnings per-share growth. We can't control, as
management, the multiple at which our stock sells. All we can control is that
we earn more money every year. I am responsible for the E [in P/E, or
price/earnings ratio]. I'm not responsible for the P."

Some investors have indeed chosen to sell the shares, as one big holder did
this past summer, or bypass them altogether, as others have, to, of all things,
invest in Tyco International, where they said they had greater confidence that
new management under Ed Breen was working in the interests of all shareholders.

Unsettling, too, for many investors is the steady stream of stock sales by
insiders, including Samuel Katz, chairman and chief executive of the Travel
Distribution Business, which includes the online ticket service Galileo; Scott
Forbes, senior executive vice president and group managing director for Europe,
Middle East and Africa; and Tom Christopoul, chairman and chief executive of
the Financial Services division, not to mention Silverman himself. In the past
six months, close to four million shares have been sold.

"It's been continual," says Omega's Haydon. "I hate to see it. No one likes to
see it. But on a percentage basis, it has not been overwhelming."

Silverman, who sold two million shares this summer for $35 million after
exercising a 1993 option grant that was set to expire, defends the stock sales
as part of an organized corporate program of selling. "I don't think any
shareholder expects me to let that $35 million gain disappear. I don't think
sales by executives are an issue. We are well down the pay scale on cash comp,
we're up the pay scale on equity comp, and if the equity doesn't turn into cash
at some point, then your whole compensation system is flawed."

Believers in Cendant take heart in thinking Silverman has been through hell the
past five years and has emerged a better leader.

What lessons has he learned?

When he was asked that years ago, he replied it wasn't a good idea to merge
with criminals. He was being frivolous at the time, but after all these years,
he's not sure there is any other lesson but that.

For investors, the big lesson will come in 2005 when Silverman gets to display
just how shareholder-friendly he is. And maybe he'll hold the next annual
investor meeting at the Days Inn on Eighth Ave.

Not a good day for us who are in home building stocks. Long-awaited,
long-predicted slowdown in housing might be upon us. Triggered by Ryland's

Odd day for me. While a lot of stocks mentioned here are up (if you own 'em you

housing related:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=spf+dhi+ryl+phm+ctx+bzh+cfc+bhs+ohb+lev

SPF hasn't been discussed here recently. Rather than sell shares in the housing
down draft that seems to be occurring (at least today), I've decided to add
shares. On the one hand, I'm uncomfortable stepping up for more now in the $45
range, given that my most recent purchases were 8/'99 when the stock was at
$11+. OTOH, SPF has just raised its earnings estimates, and considering the
universe of stocks in which to place money, SPF at current price is attractive
to me. There just don't seem to be as many bargain-priced issues to invest in
in the current market; this makes SPF relatively attractive. (with the caveat
that "relative" investing can be very, very dangerous)

I hold DSWL. Don't intend to sell. IMO the stock is not expensive when you
consider that capacity has just been raised by almost 50% in the plastic mold

Balance sheet remains extremely strong, which should enable management to hike
the dividend once again.

Good Link, Brinks. What do we do about it?

I just finished a book called "The Party's Over".

and there's a real problem looming here. Energy proces are going to climb
starting real soon. The 20 year outlook is catastrophic.

http://www.peakoil.net/iwood2003/MatSim.html

Most serious scientists worry that the world will peak in oil supply. But most
assume that this day of reckoning is still years away. Many also assume that
non-conventional oil will carry us through several additional decades. They
were right to ring the alarm bell. But they too might also be too
optimistic...But the event will occur, and my analysis is leaning me more by
the month, the worry that peaking is at hand; not years away.

Q. Given your message now and given that you've had a half hour in the Oval
Office with president Bush, why is there such a disconnect between the apparent
policy of the administration and the harsh reality of the message you just gave
this audience?
A. I think that there are people within the Bush Administration including the
President and Vice President... I think it was unbelievably discouraging to see
what occurred after the Bush Energy Plan was introduced .... And then after
9/11, the administration got totally distracted in dealing with all the events
that they've been dealing with since then. I will tell you that there is a
growing genuine concern in Washington about what is happening with natural gas
today.

OT perhaps -- Nat gas and Energy.Good Link, Brinks. What do we do about it?

I've focused totally on North America Natural Gas for several reasons:

1) There is no OPEC to solve the North America natural gas supply problem 2)
Problem will last for Years since LNG supplies only a tiny portion of US supply
and there is no way to ramp up for years. 3) Natural Gas demand by new power
plants coming online is skyrocketing-this was a result of a 1998 government
report that forecasted ample supply of natural gas for years to come 4) all the
reasons listed in the best interview and analysis I've ever seen: An Interview
with Andrew Weissman by Bill Powers, Editor Canadian Energy Viewpoint January
4, 2004 http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/powers/2004/0104.html
5) the government's natural gas policy is to hope for warm weather which is
doomed 6) Warren Buffett moved on the area in 2001 and now controls
approximately 8% of the US natural gas pipelines (this total me I was focusing
on the right area)

Bottom line is there is no solution to solve the North America natural gas
supply problem. This is the reason I've focused on the area for investment. I
own several Canadian companies that are selling for 3 to 4 times cash flow and
revenues and profits are up dramatically. The beauty of these is that there are
numerous Billion $ Canadian Energy Trusts that gobble these small companies up
when they reach a decent size. Thus this is the exit strategy for these.

My goal is to emulate the performance of UPL (Wyoming):

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=UPL&t=2y

I've owned DBLE which is in Wyoming for some time and I expect it to go a lot
higher:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=DBLE&t=1y

I believe I've found a ground floor natural gas opportunity at $ 1.10 share
that has enormous potential in the same areas as UPL and DBLE. I've talked with
the company and believe they are totally shareholder oriented. I've purchased
shares as recently as today. Management has had a terrific history and presence
in the Rocky Mountain region.
Plus they have diversifed their risks by focusing on several
areas.

American Oil and Gas, Inc.
Symbol AOGI

American Oil and Gas, Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas company
engaged in exploration, development and production of hydrocarbon reserves
primarily in the Rocky Mountain region. Additional information about American
Oil and Gas can be found at the Company's website: www.americanoilandgasinc.com

What intriqued my interest was the graph on the website depicting potential
North America sources of natural gas. It's all Rocky Mountain where UPL and
DBLE are located who have had much success. I also believe that coalbed methane
is the future for US natural gas. It only supplys approximately 8% of US
natural gas today.

"A few years ago, one of the AOGI execs told me about UPL when it was $1 a

down there and am still kicking myself. I have been tracking oil and gas for
over 30 years, and AOGI at this price is one of the best situations I have ever
seen. You could argue that it is a bit early on AOGI and you might be right,
but the same thing could have been said about DBLE when it was around $4 a
couple of years ago. That's what I thought about UPL at $1."

If someone would add this the Value Investing contest for me, I would
appreciate it. Thank you.

regarding Matt Simmons --Andy Weissman (the great interview and energy expert)
--posts on Yahoo as Pulsewriter. He posts extremely insightful posts. All one
has to do is follow him. He even mentions Buffett. I believe he assisted the
takeover of Mid-America. If interested one should order his newsletter which he
has offered to supply one issue free.

re Energy -
I have heard this argument that the energy crisis is looming since the Club or
Rome book was published in the early 70's. I would not make any investment
decisions based on the prediction that the world is running out of hydrocarbons
and such - as you know we have been through several boom and bust with respect
to energy prices during the last 30 years. Right now, we are in the boom of
course but will it stay there? The energy consumption is not very elastic with
respect to price short term but very elastic long term. So rather than a period
of high oil prices coming for a long time, i would predict that the system
adjusts and energy consumption is is reduced or new sources will be developed
such that the system adjusts itself. I think this is a much more likely
scenario than constantly increasing energy costs.

Elasticity of Energy

Look at the cars on the road. Behemoths, SUVs, gas guzzling sports cars.
Disposable income has changed so much in the last 25 years that high gas prices
don't drive many folks to buy many efficient cars anymore, nor to drive much
less. And I'll bet more people set there thermostats at 70 than ever before.

As for supply limitations, the bulk of my reading, and I can't point to any one
item, makes me think there are sufficient reserves for another 50-100 years. We
should have a good grasp on alternative and renewable fuels by then.

As for Toyota, I suspect they'll be at the forefront of delivering vehicles
using alternative energy sources.

What energy and/or gas stocks are seen here to still be buys from a value
perspective?

The exploration and production businesses are difficult for me to evaluate. My
buys have mostly been after reading specific recommendations in the media by
analysts, or have come from people on SI.

This past week I bought a little more XOM and started a small buy of DVN. I
continue to hold shares of some small and midsize E&P companies, several
shippers, and a few refiners.

Value Investing Recommendation / Discussion sites

This is another interesting site. Quite in depth analysis. Members rate each
others' suggestions/analysis. It has a 2 month delay for non-members, but it
still offers some interesting ideas from which I do my own due diligence.

I joined valueinvestorsclub last summer by recommending FARO at $7.60 to get in
and at $10 as a public recommendation as soon as I got in. They do pay $5,000
per week to the site management-decided best idea of each week.

My FARO idea probably got one of the worst average member ratings of the year.
Hah! Many of their ideas are very obscure and I have not bought one yet.

Obviously, the people at valueinvestors were not familiar with your good
stockpicking record, jeffrey bash! (And I don't just mean as regards FARO.)

I like valueinvestors club because there are a number of stocks presented, and
sometimes there are timely calls (which could be related the two-month delay).
Sometimes there seems to me to be internet scuttlebutt about certain value
stocks where a general buzz occurs and then the stocks move up. I have the
feeling that some of these stocks are talked about here with nothing happening,
but when they are mentioned on valueinvestors, that's when the buzz becomes
strong.

I agree that so many of the valueinvestors ideas are obscure. For the people
posting these ideas, they have done detailed analysis and seem to have made
careful decisions about their recommendations. I would expect their
recommendations to do well---for them. It's my opinion though, that for readers
of the recommendations, it's more difficult. There's lots of analytical stuff
to wade through on each selection, there are lots of selections, and for most
people who have to have lots of supporting data and certainty in order to make
a buy for their concentrated portfolios, it becomes tough to select from among
the recommendations presented. (OTOH, of course, if just one good selection is
made by the reader, that might make up for all the wading and cogitation one
has to do to get to that particular selection.)

We have seen on this thread how difficult it is to get three or more people to
agree (buy) the same stock. I assume valueinvestors believes that if members
are limited to their best ideas and have to document them THOROUGHLY, that
might aid readers in selecting from among the writers' picks. But that doesn't
work either (imo).

FARO is an example.
We know from your posts here you like to become very, very familiar with all
aspects of your stocks (i.e. the businesses and their prospects) and perhaps as
a consequence, you have a concentrated portfolio. Your wonderful and best idea
of FARO was hard to see here, and just as difficult for the detail-oriented
types on valueinvestors.

I maintain the following:

Detailed write-ups don't really help convince readers to buy.

Best ideas don't generally turn out to be the stocks that perform best (with
some exceptions of course -g- FARO). And contrawise (if that's the right term),
stock ideas rejected as being poor (as measured by people's voting on the
write-up) don't necessarily turn out to be poor investments. Even if rejected
by other value investors, these stocks sometimes, maybe often, turn out to be
among the better performers in one's portfolio.

Just my opinion based on my experience. Which is: I'm continually surprised by
the stocks in my portfolios which perform really well. They usually are not
from a category I'd call my best ideas.
