Just going by the numbers I see plenty of screaming values. Problem is, they
keep screaming as they get cheaper.

I am building up cash and waiting for some charts to level out before jumping
into the falling knife downpour.

FWIW, I missed getting more AMPH by a few pennies under $9 today. It is trading
barely above the value of its cash and investments. SCRA had a solid report and
strong CC - still think it's worth $25+. TIWI under 1x sales is very cheap.

I own them all and plan to hang on until the market regains its senses
somewhat.

Thanks Dale- been following your posts on these on other stocks for some time
now. Enjoy the SCR bonds, bought last fall after learning of them on your
thread. Still trying to get a handle on AMPH and TIWI.

I have been concentrating my energies on finding companies with p/e under 20,
peg under 2, growth, good roa and some dividend yield (that can be reinvested,
unlike what i might consider attractive adrs scottish power and ing, for
example)... Also, may add to positions in CBD and CETV, good non-us stocks hit
hard lately....And finally, the large cap safeties with bad press of late like

I like the AMV idea, it seems that the market that company serves would perform
well as the economy improves. If the stock can overcome the yield dilemna of a
REIT in a rising interest rate environment, it might do well. A similar REIT is
FR.

I am still a fan of MSFT at these levels. The amount of cash it generates on a
daily basis is scary. I've read figures saying that MSFT's cash hoard by year's
end will approach $70 billion.

I purchased LUV again on Friday. This stock is the category killer, IMHO, in
the airline industry. It entered the very large Philly market on Sunday. There
is a very good chance that this will result in the demise....again....of US
Airways. Southwest killed US Airways when LUV entered Baltimore, I expect LUV
to rapidly chip away at US Airways dominant market share in Philly. LUV is also
80% hedged (at $24/barrel) as to fuel needs through 2005. That's a huge
competitive advantage versus other airlines, none of whom have such an
aggressive hedging policy in place. I've had good luck trading LUV, I think
it's a good buy at about $14/sh.
Disclaimer: I travel Southwest a lot, and love it, despite the lines, etc.:>)

I continue to look at NOK, but have not bought, as yet. Historically, when one

I don't think that ABFS is a good buy at this point. ABFS has missed earnings
due to increased costs and low revenue growth. Revenue growth was an anemic 3%

Steve168,

Your crystal ball seems to be working alright with the market going lower.

I think BAMM, MEOH, and RSC look interesting with cheap valuations and stock
buybacks in place.

However, I am in no rush to buy, having about a 25% net cash position right
now. The potential for rate increases is hurting speculative debt securities,
which have a positive correlation with speculative (read smallcap/microcap)
equity securities. Summer can also be weaker for speculative securities,
particularly tech.

That being said, I don't have the intestinal fortitude to be net short the
market. This is probably good because of my lack of talent predicting market
directions.

Paul: Looked at RSC. The multilples are very attractive - especially at P/FCF.
Nevertheless they are an electronics/appliance retailer - a small one competing
against biggies, hoping focus on small communities will protect them. It's
not...just slowing the decline. Revenues declined 5% annually over the last 2
years while industry leader BBY rose 10+% over same period. WMT, BBY & online
competitors are nibbling away at these guys market share.
Insider selling at what appears to be attractive valuation confirms that this
is a business in decline. Sure the cashflow looks good - it often does in early
stages of decline, but it too will follow earnings and revenues down the
drain...insiders recognize this and are bailing.
Technically, a 5+ year trendline appears on the edge of being broken.

MC, thank you for the message. The model did alright by giving a "sell-off"
signal on 4/23/2004. Since then all indices down around 5-10%. My portfolio was
break even.

While we are still on the big downtrend, my other short-term timing model (not
as accurate as the "market top" model mentioned above and I am still
fine-tuning it) indicated the market is accumulating energy for a bounce. and
it can happen as early as tomorrow. I have covered most short positions. The
“market top” model will measure the strength of the rally, and likely give
another sell signal later. There is a small chance that the bounce is very
strong and the model gives a “reversal of downtrend” signal, however the model
will signal it way before the market reaches new high. The 3-5% sell-off in the
week after 4/23 was likely just a warning shot. The real bottom is usually
built when “panic selling” occurs. There will likely be a day that DJIA goes
down 250 points and NASDAQ goes down 75 points.

Good luck in the tough 2004!

higher the practices are valued as part of a public company - updating it with

to acquisition costs...though not nearly so much as shown in the write-up given
the 70% decline in market value.
Another interesting aspect was the comparison to Physician Practice Management

Snip:
So the company is struggling, but what about the stock? Priced at less than $5
a share and with $16.6 billion in sales last year, maybe there is some value
there, right?

Wrong. When Duane Reade announced it was being bought last December at 10 times
enterprise value to estimated EBITDA, the industry benchmark, Rite Aid shares
quickly traded up to 9.5 times EV/EBITDA. But the stock has since declined to
7.8 times EV/EBITDA, in line with industry leader CVS, which has grown sales at
close to 11% over the past five years, more than double the rate of growth
turned in by Rite Aid.

With no catalyst on the horizon to spark top-line growth and limited capital to
defend its industry position, another run-up in the stock price does not appear
likely. Short interest represents only 2.9% of the float, limiting the impact a
short squeeze could have, making this stock best avoided here at $4.64. And if
you do own it, it is an ideal candidate to sell to raise some cash. There are
better opportunities out there.

(It's now become a cheaper stock @$4.83/sh.) I, too, don't see any "catalyst on

stalled sales growth is not a reason to sell out. I want to see continuation of

I suspect the turnaround will continue to take time - two or three more years -

Buffett vote of confidence for WTM (where I am long from low 300's, full

Berkshire Hathaway to Exercise Warrants to Acquire White Mountains Common
Shares
Wednesday May 26, 4:45 pm ET

HAMILTON, Bermuda, May 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/-- White Mountains today
announced that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRKa - News) has agreed to
exercise all of its warrants to purchase common shares of White Mountains. Upon
exercise, the Company will receive approximately $294 million in cash and
Berkshire Hathaway will hold 1,724,200 common shares, or approximately 16%, of
the outstanding common shares of the Company. The exercise is subject to the
expiration or termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period.
President and CEO Ray Barrette said, "We are pleased that Warren Buffett has
agreed to exercise the warrants a year ahead of schedule for a modest discount.
This is a strong endorsement of the progress we have made since the OneBeacon
acquisition in June 2001. We see many opportunities to put this capital to work
for the benefit of all shareholders."

Berkshire Hathaway bought the warrants in connection with the financing of
White Mountains' acquisition of OneBeacon in 2001. The warrants were
exercisable at any time until May 2008 and callable by the Company on or after
May 31, 2005. Berkshire Hathaway and the Company agreed to reduce the exercise
price by approximately 2%. As a result of the discount, the exercise of the
warrants will have a small impact on fully converted tangible book value per
share.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

White Mountains is a Bermuda-domiciled financial services holding company
traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Bermuda Stock Exchange under the
symbol WTM. Additional financial information and other items of interest are
available at the Company's web site located at www.whitemountains.com.

I would track them as is AND start a new portfolio. It seems like the

allow revisions, you compromise the ability to track the performance of the
original portfolio.

FWIW, I would rather have the "double" portfolio labeled something else ("major
winner", or "50% gainer"). I can't get my mind around value stocks that I

You are exactly right that the stocks/sectors went up significantly last year
will go down faster this year. This is a test of one's strategy/approach.

I was fully loaded with below-cash tech plays and ride them on the rally, sold

MCsweet, thank you for the warning on shorting those volatile high-fliers.

Although I was lucky to have covered short positions in RIMM and SOHU (see my
5/19 update) for a profit, the powerful bounces after that made me really
nervous, I could have been caught and end up with big losses. I will stay away
from shorting such "volatile high-fliers". QQQ is a tracking stock of NASDAQ
100, the 100 largest tech stocks with trillion dollars combined market cap. It
is much less subject to "short squeeze" and manipulation. IWM (Russell 2000) is
another choice but less liquid and hard to borrow shares to short, and SPY (S&P
500) is less correlated with my "tech focus".

Since my "Potential Bounce" email/update on 5/19, the NASDAQ went up around 5%,
DJIA and SP500 had similar bounces. The big downtrend confirmed (by my model)
on 4/23/2004 is still intact. We are approaching another leg of the sell-off,
this time likely faster than the 10% NASDAQ drop during 4/23-5/13 and end with
"Panic Selling".
I have entered several hundred contacts of QQQ June 38 puts at $1.5-1.7 on
Friday 6/4/2004, and shorted QQQ around $36.35-36.6. I will buy more when the
model gives the "Confirmation signal", probably next week. As always I will
email "the signal" to my mailing list first, and post it here several days
later.

Good Luck to all.

relatively cheap semi stock with a P/S of 1.4. FCS has truly been at the bottom

This should improve margins and reduce capex (analog does not need state of the

Steve168,

It was a tough day for short positions.

I regret not being fully invested in value stocks the past several days, but
the risk/reward of the current scenario doesn't seem to me to justify being
fully invested (i.e., stuff not as cheap as it used to be and a bad event could
really drop the market). On the other hand, the market generally goes up over
time so I am fairly well invested.

The RSC buyback along with the negative Motley Fool article (they are a
contrarian indicator for me at times) made me fairly bullish on RSC. However,
the overhang of stock options has lessened my appetite, so I only bought a
little. I still like BAMM and MEOH.

I still like the Brazilian telecoms TRO and TSU (TND). TND and TSU will be one
company going forward with TSU being the surviving entity. Merger looks OK to
me based on current valuations.

With any foreign investment and specifically with volatile emgerging markets,
exchange rates are a concern. At the current exchange rates, I consider the
real to be at about fair value relative to the US$. Unless there is economic or
political upheaval (which is always a possibility) I don't see any reason why
the exchange rate should change much. The inflation in Brazil is low by
historical standards, so interest rates may come down further. Exchange rate
changes do not change the underlying value of stocks per se, except for inn the
very short term. the big trouble usually comes from debt that is foreign
currency denominated. TRO and TSU have some US$ denominated debt but it is
hedged against exchange rate fluctuations and this debt is offset by cash
holding in Brazilian real. In fact both companies are strongly cash positive -
the cash holdings cover debt more than 3x. So while an real crash and the
hyperinflation that would come with it would certainly hurt these companies
they would not go under and certainly would recover. Besides that I see the
economy and Lula's government as reasonable stable, so i think that extreme
exchange rate fluctuations are not very likely.

From a business and balance sheet point of view, both companies never have been
stronger.

Interesting Hulbert column on value investing. Snip:

Nevertheless, as you can see from the table, the best performer was the
definition based on the ratio of price to free cash flow -- which refers to
cash generated by a company's operations, less capital spending and dividends.

Taking this result to heart, I decided to screen for stocks that have very
attractive price/free cash-flow ratios and which are also popular among
investment newsletters. I started by using a stock-ranking system maintained by
Moroney at his Web site, known as the Quadrix system.

That system places all stocks on a 0-to-100 scale according to their ratios of
price/free cash flow, with 100 representing most value and 0 representing least
value.

The table that follows shows those stocks that earned a grade of 75 or higher
on Moroney's ranking system and which also are currently recommended for
purchase by five or more newsletters on the Hulbert Financial Digest's
monitored list:

growing and has considerable need to improve sewer system [City is flat and
built on a swamp: Hurricane Allison flooded Houston 3 years ago; Some flooding
in 2003 as well...usual pushback from conservative taxpayers, but
infrastructure needs are there and flooding will continue until sewer system
substantially upgraded] There's going to be 'lumpiness' to earnings due to ebbs
and flows of construction activity and taxpayer reluctance. They also have an
auto parts and non-food pet supplies distribution business that is barely
profitable...but has provided $88 million Net Operating Loss to offset taxes
for several years. They've carefully structured the business to preserve this
tax 'asset'. Directors and managers own 42% so they're in the same boat as
shareholders. On the downside, there's some related party transactions and

This stock looks interesting. One-year earnings and cash-flow ratios are

Why does the stock keep going down? What is this put liability of $5.6 million

last quarter was negative. Guess you get some variability with constuction

With debt > equity, I wouldn't exactly say there is a huge margin of safety ---

How valuable is value?
By Mark Hulbert, CBS.MarketWatch.com

[I thought there were some other valuable points such as how different
measurements of value compared, so I have reproduced the entire article]

Not all value stocks are created equal.

I realize that this hardly is earth-shattering news. Yet investors don't always
act as though they believe it. Instead, they treat "value" as though it refers
to a monolithic group of stocks.

Consider, for example, how mutual funds are evaluated. Managers are judged
according to how well they have done relative to their benchmarks, and when it
comes to value funds, funds that employ widely different definitions of value
nevertheless are compared to the same benchmark.

To see how little sense that makes, we need a few definitions.

Most academics define value using the price-to-book ratio: Stocks whose ratios
are low are considered to be value stocks, while those with high price-to-book
ratios are considered to be in the growth category.

Other widely used definitions focus on the price-to-earnings ratio, the
price-to-cash flow ratio, the price-to-sales ratio, and so forth. In all cases,
value stocks are those with the lowest ratios and growth stocks are those with
the highest.

Unfortunately, however, these various definitions don't always agree on which
stocks are value and which ones are growth. That is, a stock with a low P/E
ratio may nevertheless have a high price/book ratio, or vice versa.

How have these various definitions performed over the past decade? Richard
Moroney provided an answer in the May issue of his newsletter, Upside. (Moroney
also edits Dow Theory Forecasts.)

Moroney arrived at his answer by back-testing the performance of a number of
hypothetical portfolios that differed according to which definitions of value
that they used. He measured these portfolios' performances from 1992 until
earlier this year.

The table below lists the four definitions of value that performed the best
over this period. In each case, the percentage reflects the average annual
extent to which the 20 percent of stocks that most satisfied the definition
outperformed the overall market.

Definition of value Average annual lead over market
Price/free cash flow 9.1 percent
Price/sales vs. 5-year median 8.1 percent
Price/earnings 7.4 percent
Price/sales 7.1 percent

Moroney stresses that these are back tests, and that he is "skeptical an
investor could have done as well as the best test suggests." He also points out
that these tests focused on holding periods of no longer than a year, and that
if they had focused on longer holding periods, other ratios would have come out
on top.

Nevertheless, as you can see from the table, the best performer was the
definition based on the ratio of price to free cash flow -- which refers to
cash generated by a company's operations, less capital spending and dividends.

Taking this result to heart, I decided to screen for stocks that have very
attractive price/free cash-flow ratios and which are also popular among

Let's apply Mark Hulbert's Price/Free Cash Flow holy grail to Countrywide
[CFC]. True their FCF (free cash flow) is just amazing. According to Yahoo:

Mkt Cap: 19.04B
FCF: 7.26B
P/FCF: 2.62
Operating Margin: 50.56%
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=cfc

These numbers look almost too good to be true. And perhaps they are. For one
thing, Value Line lists their "Cash Flow per Share" at only $8.45, versus
$27.09 for Yahoo [Cash flow from operations: $7.57B/279.38M shares]. So I don't
know which cash flow numbers to believe, Yahoos or Value Line's.

Then there's the question of whether this is as good as it possibly gets for a
residential mortgage lender with rates now headed in a northerly direction.
Already CFC has noted some disturbing trends in their May operational report,
although they tried to place the best possible spin on them:

Average daily application volume of $2 billion declined 39 percent from last
year amidst a higher interest rate environment.

Applications fell "only" 5 percent as compared to last month. [!]

Pipeline of applications-in-process at $50 billion, down from the year-ago
period when it was $74 billion.

Loan fundings for the month of May totaled $32 billion, a decrease of 20
percent from last year.

And last but not least, declining quality of their loan portfolio with subprime
volume surpassing $3 billion, an increase of 89 percent over last year.

At the risk of differing with nonagenarian Seth Glickenhouse's bullish
assessment in this week's Barrons ["Buying Countrywide is like buying the
Michael Jordan of the industry at a preposterously low price: eight times this
year's earnings."
http://online.wsj.com/barrons/article/0,,SB108639081396029410,00.html?mod=b_thi
_weeks_magazine_main ], I'll forego this bargain awaiting further research,
such as how well they actually perform in a rising rate environment, which we
have not seen in a good long time.

I am holding AUO and still like the prospects and position in an growing,
competitive market. There were a number of news items that lead to the
sell-off, IMO: pending LG Phillips IPO, the Sharp lawsuit, downgrade by
Deutsche Bank, lowering prices of flat TV screens (only a small part of AUO's
business), and the fact that most Asian stocks fell on the concern China's
central bank may raise interest rates to cool economic growth.

I am disappointed in the timing of my last buy and I would add here if I didn't
have a full position. A forward PE of 5.6 just seems too low, even for a
cyclical company in an emerging market. The dividend will be paid July 12;
currently a 2% yield. Per Yahoo, 4 analysts expect an average of $3.05 next
year, up significantly from when I did an earlier FV calculation.

opportunity. Earnings expectations remain intact; valuation of 5.4x the firm's
new CY04E EPS is attractive and fundamentals have changed little. The firm
believes catalysts should include completion of AUO's secondary offering,
better visibility on 2H demand, and multiple expansion on growing confidence in
the sustainability of FPD profit growth into and beyond CY05."

Unfortunately, Taiwan has long been a fragile society lacking a sense of
security. It is unusually sensitive to rumor and intimidation. This is
reflected in the stock market. Oddly enough, it is always the government that
people blame for any fall in the market. They never blame Beijing.

In Asia, Stocks Are
Left Out of the Party

By PHILLIP DAY and HAE WON CHOI
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
June 14, 2004; Page A2

SEOUL, South Korea -- Higher oil prices, rising interest rates and fears that
China's powerful economy could experience a sharp slowdown have led some
investors and economists to turn bearish on all of Asia -- even as it racks up
the best economic results in years.

First-quarter growth was impressive across the region. Most of Southeast Asia
is growing faster than 7%, while northeast Asian economies are leveraging
China's feverish expansion to record solid results themselves. Japan has just
notched its best two consecutive quarters of growth since the boom days of the
1980s. Last week, the International Monetary Fund predicted Asian growth would
average 7% this year.

But as Asian economies have expanded this year, stock markets have fallen
sharply. Investors seem to be looking past the good news and worrying about
what could go wrong.

"It seems to me that investors are overreacting," says Kwon Tae Shin, South
Korea's deputy finance minister for international affairs.

Buying Some AUO
6/14/04 1:19 PM ET

I've bought some AUO on today's further bashing. You don't wanna trade off
irony, but I loved the fact that DB's downgrade report last week was titled "As
Good As It Gets." LOL.

The stock is currently at about a 5 P/E. I'm keeping it pretty small so far. I
don't know what fair value would be, but I'm giving it a long-side,
Haefele-esque (of Street Insight fame) shot here.

Net long AUO

2) AUO plans to expand its G6 fab capacity to 150,000 substrates of motherglass
per month, setting its sights on the No. 1 spot currently held by Samsung.
Currently, only Sharp has a G6 fab in mass production, LG. Philips' G6 fab will
begin mass production in the end of this year, and AUO's G6 could start mass
production in 1Q05. Therefore, after expansion, AUO's G6 fab will have the
largest capacity in the world. Samsung has a G7 fab set to begin mass
production in 2Q05; however, the G7 fab yield rate will ramp up very slowly
given a longer learning curve for larger-size motherglass and new technology.

3) AUO will begin to move equipment in next year for an extra 60,000 substrates
of motherglass capacity slated to begin production in 2Q06. Therefore, we
expect growing oversupply risk in 2006. In 2005, we believe G6 fab yield rates
will remain low in the first half of the year, eliminating the chance of
oversupply at least in 1H05.

4) Our top pick remains AUO in the TFT LCD panel sector due to the company's
relatively cheap valuation (6.5x times forecast EPS) and its product mix that
includes smaller panel products as well, which can diversify its risk and give
AUO higher gross margin (we believe small-sized panels will enjoy rising
shipment levels driven by handset used TFT LCD panel demand.

I'm still holding my few shares of AUO (and GNSS too).

My unsupported-by-facts guess is that AUO is a well-known Chinese stock in a
rapidly growing subsector that supplies popular products to the masses, and so
this stock attracts the gambling instinct of Chinese traders. Hence the
volatility as the punters take (or lose)profits based on trading trends they
see.

I remain positive about the company prospects and its market, although I'm no
expert.

I wrote a scanner to calculate Piotroski scores and ran a few indices through
it. I put the results on the web here:

http://members.cox.net/econisvoodoo/piotroski/

The scans are without regard to valuation (unless the index itself claims some
bias). I wrote the tool to scan individual stocks and it's been a really handy
when testing people's recommendations from articles - I usually eliminate low
scorers quickly unless there are some very specific reasons to buy. I started
running it on indices and I saw some interesting companies recommended here
that top the list.

The Russell 3000 is the most interesting general index (the list for this index
is somewhat outdated though). I'm still looking for better sources for more
indices.

Thanks, Stew. Some very good stock possibilities in your screens. I, as well as
others here, will look closely at what you've come up with.

I hadn't seen a Piotroski screener before, although Piotroski's criteria have
been out for a while. Great work on your part. Could be very significant to
value investors.

Thanks again. I have a couple of stocks on that list - UAG and OMM (which I've
added to recently).
------------
HBG looks interesting to me. It's comparable to giant MMC on some measures:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/co?s=HBG

Both companies though may be under pressure due to Eliot Spitzer's probe into
"contingent commissions" which are fees these brokers collect from insurers.
Too tough for me to figure what the result Mr. Spitzer might have on business
practices of these companies, so I'll avoid the sector for now.

Interesting, with my scanner, I get UAG as a 5, mainly because the financial

UAG:

Anyone looking at NYB?

New York Community Bank. Nearing 52 week lows on supposedly temporary bad news
concerning leveraged strategy that now is giving them hiccups.

At current price of around $19.90 per share
1.59 x book
11.58 x earings
9.34 x forward earnings
PEG ration .97
Return on assets 2.21%
Return on equity 18.86%
4.96% dividend
Note: all this information compiled from Yahoo

Several board members purchased $500,000 worth of their company's stock. The
following article describes the purchases and advises about the riskier asset
classification that NYB invests in compared to other banks. Anyone ever hear of
Barra risk measures? Would be interesting to know the Barra criteria.

http://yahoo.smartmoney.com/stockscreen/index.cfm?story=20040601intro&afl=yahoo

Also somewhat concerning, NYB's lending region in this real estate bubble
market, which is primarily in New York City, Long Island, Westchester County
and New Jersey areas.

Disclosure: I am circling, but have not made any purchases as of yet.
Interested in anyone's feedback.

I would vote on keeping portfolios as is and adding a new one at the end of the
year. I.e. I don't think there is enough interest/new stuff to add new

How do you account for HLSH in double? It says N/A in the portfolio screen and
I wonder if this distorts the portfolio performance (makes it better than what
it is? worse?)

Jurgis and all,

This is my plan for now since I didn't get a large response to my query. So
what I would love to hear (and hopefully others would also) is a mid-year
update on the picks from the picker. Do you still own it? Would you buy it now?
Why?

I never could get a quote for HLSH on SI. It is up a little better than 10 % on
the year so it would slightly bump up the portfolio. At some point, I could
manually adjust the portfolio to reflect that small impact.

Which reminds me that the Safe portfolio results are underestimated right now
as I have only adjusted for dividends from ACAS not the rest. There are a few
decent dividend payers in there.
