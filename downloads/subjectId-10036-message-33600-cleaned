All too true Paul.

We, otoh, look forward to Thursday nights when out 4 year old grandson spends
the night so our daughter can work. He survived a horrific car crash when he
was 9 months old. Literally thrown out of the car seat on the highway and had
the car land on and crush his skull. A month of ICU in Honolulu and he
miraculously survived. Today he is about a year behind others his age but seems
to be mostly fine. We went from "he's going to die", to "he's going to be a
vegetable...you should think about letting him go" to having a real miracle
child.

That is the thing that keeps us going. We still see some good happening in this
world. Less and less from the gov't, i'll grant you.

OT re Madoff -

I am sure that some folks (employees) helped with the fraud. others did not
help but did probably know about it.

I am not sure about the traders. Besides his Ponzi investment operation he did
run a legit(?) market making operation and the traders were probably working in
the latter. Even though , those traders must have known about the investment
operation and may have wondered why Madoff never did any trades for his
clients? My guess is that most of the folks working there knew something was
wrong (also not the extend of the fraught) but were paid to not ask any
questions.

Other folks must have helped him to keep the fake books, sent out fake
statement to clients etc. there must have been a fake accounting system,
customer service, computer programs calculating the fakes returns for clients
etc. etc. It was an "industrial size" fraud operation -he cannot possibly done
it all by himself.

Your comment strikes a cord of memory in me. I remember how my wife heard some
wonderful speaker talk about research work that he did involving non-drug
psychiatric therapy. My wife asked him where she could read about it and he
intimated that it would be very difficult because the whole system is geared
toward psychiatric medications for patients rather than alternatives. That is
where the funding is, hence that is where the research dollars are spent, those
are the types of researchers and professors hired by universities, those are
the editors hired to write the textbooks and edit the professional journals.
Its just one vicious circle all geared toward perpetuating psychiatric
medications as the treatment of choice depite that toxicity of drugs, the side
effects and the interactive issues with other medications and foods. Then other
therapies are poo-pooed in that they have not passed scientific testing yet
there are no dollars for it.

There is also local influence pedalling. Our local health system managed to get
some law passed in Mass. so that they could remain a virtual monopoly in this
area. A competitive radiaology group had to move out of state to work.

Grommit -re BDN

 I can sleep soundly with this investment....
If I owned the common, i would not sleep well. BDN is liquidity challenged.
They need to come up with about 1 Billion $ (In Y2009 & Y2010) to fund their
development pipeline and maturities. Besides that occupancy is falling very
fast when you annualize the QoQ drop.

I do think they make a good move to sell properties and buy back their own
bonds at a discount but it may be too little too late. As far as NE office
REIT's are concerned, when adjusted for leverage (looking at EV versus market
cap) CLI is still cheaper and has no problems with debt maturities. That said i
do agree that the BDN preferred looks interesting.

OK, I appreciate you throwing the idea out. Probably not for me though as I

bounces or bear market counter trend rally's that don't last.

SDTH book around $2. No discount there. Estimates look good and on a PE basis
and chart doesn't look bad at this point. Last report pretty good and if
annualized, PE about 5. China is in a slowdown though and likely to get worse
as they have already closed 70 plants and factories. 54 million shares
outstanding is alot and other types of debt securities out as well outstanding
as well even after the recent purchase of a portion of convertibles. Pros and
Cons make this a neutral to my way of thinking. Could be good but its gonna
take a hell of alot to find any winners that can defy market forces.

Grommit - i think that CLI's numbers are better but yahoo stats won't show it.
you need to dig a little deeper.

CLI has 4.4B$ in assets and 770M$ in rent revenue. BDN has 5.2B$ and 680M$ in
revenue. Since both are so similar in asset location and business we can
reasonably assume that CLI assets are on the books more depreciated than BDN's
(using the rent/asset ratio as an indicator) Also CLI interest was 128M$
annualized versus 195M$ for BDN. That's a fairly large difference when you look
at Rent revenue/interest coverage.

The biggest problem with BDN are the capital needs to finish up the development
projects (CLI has none - a big plus) and the refinancing. Those are about 1B$
or a little more until the end of Y2010.

I run some stats 2 years ago that clearly showed that CLI is less leveraged and
was cheaper than (and still is cheaper no, leveraged adjusted).

Hi Spekulatius - I like the REIT preferrds but also believe that their gross
rents will be less for FY 2009 and even FY 2010 and perhaps significantly less
if the economy gets worse.

BDN has been reducing debt and buying back notes. The preferred payout for BDN
is approximately $8 million per year. The common payout costs the company
approximately $106 Million per year.

If BDN cuts their dividend on their common (for various reasons you stated), I
was thinking that shorting the common while owning any of the preferred series
might be a good hedge strategy.

When HRP cut their dividend by 50% last month, the spread between their
preferred and common widened. If the dividend is discontinued for any reason,
shorting their common while owning the preferred might also be a good strategy.

Other than day and swing trading this market, I am trying to think out longer
term strategies for positions I want to hold w/o taking these 5%-15% hits down
when the overall market trades lower. I have been hedging some of my other
holds by selling covered calls but the premiums I get have not covered the
longer term losses.

I think you have been playing it pretty good by taking profits on your swing
trades. However when the market finally turns, you may miss loading up the
boat. I think we are far from a market turn higher and defense with capital
preservation is the key now.

Hi Grommit - Have you calculated the total dividend payout for the different
series preferreds and that of the common for several of the REITs you follow?
It would be interesting to see how much total money is saved by the REIT on a
dividend cut relative to the series preferred payouts.

I was having a hard time finding the total dividend payout on the different
series of preferreds so I could make this calculation. If the total dividend
payout on the common is large compared to the preferred payouts, this is just
another margin of safety for owning the preferreds.

HRP cut their dividend by 50% last month which saved them a lot of cash. They
plan to use the proceeds to pay down debt and buy back common stock.

I expect the REIT rent rolls to be less in 2009 and perhaps even in 2010. REITs
will slash their dividends and may even pay their preferred dividends in stock
rather than cash. Could HRP be setting their plate now by buying back common
stock only to pay their preferred series dividend in common stock shares next
year?

My hedging strategy when this occurs is to short the common shares while owning
the safer high yielding preferred shares. I would want to own only those REIT
preferreds with a small total dividend payout when compared to the total common
share dividend payout and the total REIT net revenues.

Without going through each SEC filing, it's hard to determine the relative
dividend payout for each of the series of preferreds. The smaller the better.
BDN's preferred dividend payout looks quite small when compared to their common
dividend payout and to their total net revenues.

AIRT as a catalyst for a general discussion of margins.

"Overall, the company is probably a buy if one can stand the low margins."

I'm having some difficulty here. -g-. I've spent more than eight years
considering,developing, reviewing my margin formula. I'm not saying I've been
right or I've got it right, or that I know what I'm doing... only that I've
considered the subject and I use net profit margin as a factor, sometimes a key
factor, in determining my buys.

Right now I view all this as perhaps irrelevant. It's as if I've worked up a
formula that says if clouds are grey and ominous, and if such-and-such
barometer readings occur, then carry an umbrella. Whereas the nub of it is that
we're in a thunderstorm and nobody's needs a formula to tell them to carry an
umbrella. So as regards stocks,
in this market, if one sees low margins that even appear as a negative in any
way, the person might/should move on. There are too many other companies that
beckon. (Aside: And AIRT does not appear strong on net profit margins by my
formula.)
----------------------------
It's late at night, and I'm up, so I will just clarify maybe, what I have said
about previous stocks as regards profit margins. When I have said xyz has high
margins or margins look good, it is not that I have some number in mind as a
bogey, as, for example 14% is good, 3% is bad; or just that net profit margins
are good because this year they are at 10% and last year they were 6%; or that
they're 20% for abc drug company and that's bad (because the sector average is
25%). Rather, I feed every stock idea into a formula I have that helps me
determine a purchase price for the stock based on its net profit margins. In
the sense it's a formulaic output, my evaluation of margins as "good", "high",
"unsatisfactory" is not an arbitrary call. (I believe)

For me, it's the same thing with margins as with roic (I use roe). We have the
Greenblatt model which says buy high roe stuff, avoid the low. I prefer to have
the decision on a continuum. That is, if I'm a value investor, my opinion is
that at some point (at some low stock price) almost any going-concern will be a
buy. (aside: Although maybe there's an argument in this tailspin market nothing
should be bought at any price. -g-) What that low purchase price for a low roe
company is, can be ascertained, I believe.

As regards margins, I find I like net profit margins better in some ways than
operating margins. I have seen a report just recently that seems to indicate
margins are better predictors of stock market performance than Mr. Buffett's
favorite, roic.

Similar to the way I will factor low roe into a stock decision, I will consider
a company with low net margins and low stock price. What is "low" margins? Low
absolutely? (grocery stocks are always 'low'), low relatively (a stock to its
sector? low to itself?). And how does "margins" relate to value? Also to be
considered: when and how does the margin figure combined with the (low) stock
price indicate a buy? And again, what "margins" am I looking at - current,
average over several years, operating margins, net margins? And further, how
are we defining these terms "operating margins", "net margins"?)

I've made some decisions, developed a simple net profit margin formula, and
have made investments based on it. Right now, nothing seems to be working.
Nevertheless I find using margins (any definitions thereof) to evaluate stocks
on a value basis to be an interesting but complex subject and a
work-in-progress for me.

Margins - well, I don't have a formula approach to margins. I am more or less a
black/white guy. For most companies, I want high absolute net margins (at least
10% more or less), since this indicates IMO that the company or industry has a
business allowing for sustainable good profit generation. Now, it is probably a
good idea to try and understand why is that and are the margins really
sustainable, but that's more qualitative consideration. I discard outright most
of the companies that don't have high absolute net margins. But then there are
category killers such as WMT, where low margins is not an issue, it's the
strength of the company. So I consider some of these as possible investments as
well.

Now, I've listened to some presentations of Charlie Silk, who is a "fallen
angel" small cap value investor. He emphasizes high gross margins (>50% or so).
I guess his thinking is that if a company has high gross margins, it can always
get profitable (again) by either growing sales and not increasing expenses or
by trimming expenses. I don't really use his approach, but I wanted to throw it
out into the discussion about margins.

earnings next quarter, next year much less so in ten years are going to look
like.

Not really. ROE/ROIC may be high even when margin is low.

Net margin = earnings/sales
ROE = earnings/equity = earnings/(assets - liabilities)

Low net margin, high roe just means that sales/equity is high. For net margin
of 3%, to get 15% roe, sales/equity will have to be 5/1.
You can substitute equity with IC, the result is still mostly the same, it just
constrains the business differently (can't use debt but can hold cash).

Sales/equity can be high either in a business where capital requirements are
low or where sales turns are very rapid. It is possible to analyze deeper and
find out exactly what raises this ratio. Canonical examples are WMT and DELL
(at least historically).

There is no direct double counting.

U.S. Gas Production Seen Sliding for 4 Years: Chart of the Day

From the article:"...Feb. 20 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. production of natural gas, the
most widely used furnace fuel in the world’s largest economy, may tumble
through 2012 as low prices prompt producers to shut down drilling rigs from
Louisiana to the Rocky Mountains...."

================================================================

As the marginal rigs are shut down overall production should decrease. This
should limit the supply of NG which should stabilize current prices. Any
increase in demand should raise NG prices in the short term. I agree with you
that we may have seen the current lows.

I still think Obama will promote NG usage because it is a clean fuel and most
of the reserves are domestic. There was some discussion last year (with oil
over $125/barrel) to tax the oil companies with a windfall oil tax. I would not
be surprised to see some type of oil tax to spur NG usage over imported oil.

California was all set to charge a $0.12/gallon tax to help the budget deficit
but was removed at the last minute.

High gross margins.

At some point I came to rely on net profit margins vs. operating margins, and
I've gone with that. I have assumed that they are either correlated or related
in a way that when analyzing a company, either metric is okay. Perhaps now I
should look more closely at testing that assumption, esp. for high gross margin
companies. I'll have to try to find some of Mr. Silk's work.

In my portfolios/watch list I don't spot any stocks that now have operating
margins of over 50%. It's not a metric I can sort on. (I see RIG at 45%, Visa
(V) at 47%.) That 50% figure seems exceptionally high to me now. I see several
in the 25-30% area and these result in net profit margins in the 20% plus
range.

I always want to be attuned to outliers and the reasons for them. With very
very high margins (whether gross margins or net), one has to wonder if they're
sustainable. To bring home so much profit to the bottom line on every sales
dollar, is as attractive as a honey pot to a bear. (Which would be competitors,
potential new market entrants, gov't taxation authorities, maybe organized
employees).

There are many people I'd say who have a requirement in their definition of
"growth stock" that it is, or it includes, growth in sales: can't be a growth
stock if sales aren't growing. In this case, it seems to me a situation that
would almost be too good: sales growth and for every dollar of sales, "huge"
profits from that sale. I should be leery of blithely applying a formula in
this case (or anywhere else maybe), and ought to instead or in addition, look
behind the numbers.

Perhaps you misunderstood. Silk talks about gross margins, not operating
margins. E.g for PFE http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=PFE&annual gross margin in

Yes, nothing seems to be working these days.

My formulas seem to be irrelevant.

There's a lot going on in making an investment decision. And we all bring our
own unique background to it. In another life I was a student of Dr. W.Edwards
Deming and his methods of quality management. The essence of what I've carried
over is this:

Information is not knowledge. Knowledge depends on theory. Having experience in
buying/selling stocks teaches us nothing unless one puts it up against a theory
of and about valuation. To me, a theory means something concrete I can
objectively look at, and that leads me to a requirement for a formula.

At this point, being still a work in progress, I'd rather not focus on the
contents specific to my formula. As I say, it all might be irrelevant anyway.

Take NVS, for which I ask your opinion (and of others who might be following
it). It has a 19% net profit margin and 21% operating margin currently (latest
Yahoo numbers). Over the past ten years it's averaged 17.7%. Psr is relatively
low at a little over two, stock is hitting 12-mo. low, p/e at 11.4 (ttm)is at
low compared to past yearly averages, dividend yield is over 4%. I am
considering making a small buy. Would such a stock be so low in price that it
would fit anybody's model/formula, assuming they used a model or formula? Fits
okay for me regarding profit margins. Regarding 17.7% ROE, that is marginally
okay at current stock price, by my calculations.

Where I sense I'm really weak is, if given that NVS is cheap, and if capital to
be allocated is limited, where does NVS stand in relation to all the other
cheap stocks that are comparable? Perhaps other big pharma's are cheaper and
better buys. SI shows "P/E as % of Sector Segment" = 85%, so NVS seems to be in
the ballpark with other pharma's (as regards p/e). There still might be cheaper
better buys out there though.

Most of the time in our investing careers, market action in specific stocks has
eventually corresponded with fundamentals, one way or another. For now, macro

investors can either step aside until the macro climate calms down, or use the

The problem is not with the formula, it is with input variables. What seems to
happen is that my input variables are shown to be wrong by significant amounts
faster than at any given time in my investment carrier before. Just to name one
example I thought a while ago that NG in the US would pretty much have a floor
at 5-6$/mcfe, now I am seeing prices of 4$. Business revenues that I though
could go down 10-15% tops are shown to go down 25-30%. The list goes on and on.

For example right now I am looking into aircraft industry. So far earnings
estimates are looking pretty decent into Y2010 due to the good backlog at
Airbus and Boeing. But will these planes delivered as planned? Airline traffic
is down and I am hearing that there are a lot of cancellation with certain

NVS - my old pharma favorite. Extremely solid balance sheet and above average
management (IMO). Is it a value?

PE is around 11. Mid single digit sales growth projected in their forecast. Not
too bad. They do 40% of heir revenues in non- mainstream pharma business
(vaccines, generics, consumer healthcare). The above metrics do make for a
decent but not a great value, IMO. Pipeline looks OK but not great. Their
blockbuster Diovan is going to expire some time down the road, that is going to
be a substantial setback.

Macro environment (yes I do macro) dos not look great. Headwinds on pricing are
increasing and it is likely (IMO) to get worse. Competitors to compare to are
GSK and SNY (SNY probably the closest proxy)

The question for me is why buy pharma at all unless it is very cheap. I can buy
consumer products companies without LT macro headwinds for similar PE than NVS
(UL, NSRGY, PG , PM Metc.) . I also can buy medical device companies like SYK
for a slightly higher PE and those have way better growth. I can buy a
pharma/device hybrid like JNJ for a 12 PE. So there are many opportunities to

Paul,

Thanks a lot for Mauboussin article. He starts it with two quotes from Graham
that lie at the core of Graham's disagreement with Buffett. Especially second
one which I quote again: "The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting
and concentrating on the most promising companies in the most promising
industries". That's why Graham advocated diversification vs. Buffett's
concentration. We know that Buffett showed that it is possible to find the most
promising companies or at least very promising companies in good industries.
But it is unclear how much Buffett's methods are repeatable - and you have
challenged that repeatability in the past.

Mauboussin does not address Graham criteria in this article: low P/Book
together with very conservative selection of companies - 10 years positive
earnings, some earnings growth, some dividend, etc. So that part of equation
remains unclear.

He does address in one paragraph the fact that high margin, high ROIC
businesses may be better selection than just high ROIC businesses. This agrees
with my current approach - and returns us back to margin discussion we were
having.

Regarding SI ROCI calculation - I seem to remember that some numbers on SI
financial pages were unreliable. Since I mostly don't do screening, this is not
an issue to me and it may or may not be an issue to you. Currently I use

ot: GM Chrysler bailout. I would actually consider buying a GM car, but I
detest that my buy price could be so much higher than some other classes of
people who get cash incentives from GM. It's not the negotiation-w/dealers
issue. It's first, the categories in which I don't belong-- better prices from
GM if you're a recent college grad, or(and?) if you have GM credit card, and/or
if you are a employee of a GM supplier, and even a better price if you are a
current or retired GM employee, and another savings off list price if you are a
repeat GM customer or trading in a leased GM car.

Secondly, now I am looking from what GM doesn't give me to what I seem to be
giving GM.

USA population = 306M; GM/Chrysler bailout so far: $18B.

So I figure essentially my wife and I have each given GM $60.

It is reported that the government is preparing for the bankruptcy of
GM/Chrysler by readying as much as $40B.

http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/bailout-watch-413-feds-preparing-40b-chrysler-
m-c11-dip/

Which means that every person in the USA is preparing to "loan" GM/Chrysler
about $133.00. (That includes covering the $60 "loan" that the car companies
have already consumed.) $133/person is $533 bucks "loaned" to the auto
companies by every typical family of four. And where I live, not too many
families own or want to own or will own a GM/Chrysler product.

I don't buy a car that often and when I do, I want to feel good about it. Hard
to in this kind of situation.

This should be a net positive for HRP. Do you agree? They are taking their
Government Properties (29 buildings) packaging them into a separate REIT and
keeping 49.9% of the IPO. They should get a bit over book value on the offer
probably a better deal than selling the buildings in a private party sale.

Unit of HRPT Properties Trust files $288 million IPO

NEW YORK (MarketWatch) --- HRPT Properties Trust (HRP:

{21AB52CD-F4E3-48D8-B8DB-5E4DBF8F1FFA}&siteid=yhoof2
HRP 3.28, -0.30, -8.4%) said Monday its Government Properties Income Trust unit
filed an initial public offering. Government Properties Income Trust will own
29 properties which are leased to the U.S. government and several state
governments. The Newton, Mass.-based real estate investment trust plans to
offer up to 11.5 million shares including overallotments by underwriters in a
bid to raise a maximum of $288 million, according to the IPO filing. Government
Properties Income Trust plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol GOV. Upon completion of the public offering, HRP will continue to own
approximately 49.9% of Government Properties Income Trust, and public investors
will own approximately 50.1%.

==========================================================

There is an HRP conference call scheduled for Thursday (2/26/09) which should
provide more details. If the story makes sense (there is an over subscription
on the IPO) and they can generate the $288 million, there should be plenty of
cash reserves to protect the preferred dividend payouts.

Paul,

Let me take a swing at this.

NVS. My model shows expected 14% annual return. Not great in this environment.
There are lots of stocks of strong-long term performer companies with expected
returns of at least 17% (MMM, NKE, GSK, JNJ, PEP, CSCO, MSFT). Now, this does
not take into account pharma pipeline, about which I don't know squat. You'd
have to ask Oblomov. ;)

Let's look another way. ROE is about 17%, which is low for pharmas. ROIC is
very similar, since cash almost cancels out debt. Earnings/EV = 9%, which is
again nothing to be excited about. JNJ's earn/EV = 8.7%, but its ROE is much
higher. So, I'd go with JNJ and not think a lot. Now, to decide whether to buy
JNJ or MSFT or PEP or CSCO or NKE or MMM is quite another question. Probably
impossible to choose quantitatively. ;)

P.S. I did not read the following posts before writing this reply, so my
analysis similarity (or difference) to other analyses just means that value
investors think alike (or differently). ;)

NKe and COH - strange enough I'd prefer COH over NKE at current prices. The
reason is that folks may regard NKE as a luxury/discretionary item that did not
do so before. COH on the other hand is a relatively affordable luxury brand
that still has a good image with younger customers (unlike ANF which I see worn
more by 40 + year old folks than the 20 year old's that they were targeting).

Regarding GRMN< I admit the stock looks very very cheap but where do you see
them going? I see revenues down 15% with volume up 15% which means that ASP is
down 30%. if this continues the market for Navigation systems is going to
shrink very fast. Worse I think that (smart) cellphones with navigation
capabilities could take pieces of the market away on top of the ASP
desintegration.

Okay, here's another simple earnings based metric and rule that I am working
with now and trying to develop and understand. That is, I'm trying to figure
out if it's worthwhile as a screening tool -- a way for me to exclude stocks -
or at least get me to consider more carefully before I buy something.

It is a simple comparison of p/e ratios now versus projected by analysts.

We know analysts earnings projects vs. actual are often, maybe mostly
incorrect, even allowing for some standard deviation in estimate. Just take
Meredith Whitney vs. all the other Citigroup analysts. Or any of the analysts
who've predicted last year what AIG might earn this year.

The thing is, in most cases, could we at least assume that if a number of
analysts are following a stock, that the average of their earnings projections
at least gives the correct DIRECTION of what earnings would do? There's a case
to be made that no, the average of analysts' earnings guesses is apparently (if
I recall the studies) wrong about the direction of earnings one year out. But I
wonder if I look at enough stocks and enough estimates and focus only on what
analysts predict are worse earnings next year, that I might be right to use
that to censor (remove) such stocks from my potential buys.

So here is the rule (comments welcome):

Using the Yahoo Key Statistics page for a stock, the third item is trailing p/e
(ttm), and the next item is forward p/e (with the date), the rule is: Do not
buy any stock where the forward p/e is HIGHER than the trailing p/e number.

Contrawise (or whatever the correct word is), if the forward p/e is LOWER than
the current p/e, then one can continue researching the company.

Based on this comparison of earnings (p/e's), like this for NVS,

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=NVS

the following companies pass this screen and allegedly might have lower p/e's
(higher earnings) next year (or corporate year-end) than now:

NVS, MSFT, PEP, NKE, JNJ

The following companies have analysts who believe (or report anyway) the
companies will have higher p/e's (lower earnings) next year than currently. So
maybe - if this simple p/e comparison could actually be accurate and encompass
all that's necessary to evaluate a company and predict the future - the stocks
could be/might be/should be passed by:

GRMN, MMM, COH, CSCO

Again, just a simple thing I'm playing with. Maybe be a general rule that works
for somebody, or a way to screen, or could be just something that might help me
slow down my buying. Or maybe it's worthless. Maybe, like all general rules, it
might work sometimes and sometime not. Anyway, I'm attuned to it, and I'm
looking at the comparison for every stock I'm interested in.

COH is also cheaper at about 19% back-looking earnings/EV and about 23%
expected return in my Buffettology model. While NKE only has back looking 9.5%
earnings/EV and about 18% expected return. NKE is much more of a big brand
though with wider moat.

GRMN. OK, here's the positive scenario: they have to go down the ASPs and they
have to invade developing countries. That's what Nokia successfully did in the
last 8 years. GPS below $50 is a new ball game, where it is becoming affordable
to everyone, even people who don't need it most of the time. Think "Main
street" from "Gorilla Game", etc.

Sure, it is harder to make case for GPS vs cell phone to Indian farmer or
African day laborer, but the penetration vs cell phone is minuscule and the
price may be even lower than cell phone's. If Garmin do that, they would have
another huge leap up. If they try to maintain the high-end niche and leave the
low end to no-name competitors, they will be squeezed up really soon
("Innovator's dilemma" and such).

Cell phones are only somewhat competitive. Cell phones suck in cars: too small
screens and non-dedicated interfaces. Smart cell phones with GPS cost much more
than dedicated just GPS, making them not affordable to low income people. They
are also very complicated, which again drives away some customers. Sure, some
of the disadvantages will shrink, but some will not.

OK, gotta run, more maybe later. :)

R20, I'm not understanding your request. Please clarify. What do you mean by
"historical data" for "forward numbers"?

A source that supplies backup studies for making conclusions about validity of
analysts' predictions would be either of the two Contrarian Investment Strategy
books by David Dreman. Except that the conclusions in those reported studies
and in many others are that analysts' forward numbers cannot be relied upon. I
am arbitrarily going against that by relying on the numbers, i.e. using
consensus estimates of lower earnings in forward year as a screening tool
and/or as a cautionary alert.

re CAT E_K_S or my spider sense were right, it's now trading in the mid

boom so this business could shrink quite dramatically well into 2010. So the
40B$ revenue forecast may prove to be optimistic :-(. There are pension issues
and a financing arm as well, enough fodder for the shorts.

Di anyone follow into AAUK? I bought a few. Earnings are well down and they cut
the dividend to zero. Still they do look like a survivor - their debt per this
years numbers is about 2x EBITDA (1x EBITDA per Y2008 earnings). Not great but
not even close to distressed either. Companies like AAUk need to recover and

compensation and risk taking in check.

On a related note, the unequality in treatment of management versus grunt

thousands of $ a formal investigation is required and safeguards are supposed

I also dont understand how a company can cut dividends to their shareholders by
85% or more and still pay generous bonuses and stock grants to their senior

the executives that if they cant pay shareholder a reasonable dividend then
they dont deserve a bonus, but I guess commonsense and integrity are bywords of

Upping my exploratory position in GulfMark a little.

"GulfMark Offshore, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, provides offshore
marine services primarily to companies involved in offshore exploration and
production of oil and natural gas. Its vessels provides various services that
support the construction, positioning, and ongoing operation of offshore oil
and natural gas drilling rigs and platforms." (From Yahoo)

I interpret and summarize the following p.r. from the company as:
some customer business --- not all--- is already contracted for in '09, and
into '10 as well. Further, GLF can fund its big capital expenditures
internally. I presume the nearly .5B in ltd (per Yahoo) that they have is
manageable.

From http://www.gulfmark.com/fw/main/News-Releases-21.html :

"While current market conditions are uncertain, we are confident in our ability
to navigate this more challenging environment. GulfMark's financial position is
solid and we remain focused on our long term strategy and the potential
opportunities that unstable markets often provide. Our liquidity is stronger
than it has ever been and our young, modern, technologically advanced fleet
already has 65% contract cover for 2009."

From another p.r.
"Cash flow from operations totaled $205.2 million for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2008, compared to $128.6 million for the same period in 2007. The
company made significant investments in 2008, including $108.6 million in
capital expenditures, primarily related to the new build program and $121.6
million related to the acquisition of Rigdon Marine. Estimated cash commitments
for 2009 for the new build program are approximately $111.0 million and are
expected to be funded from cash on hand and cash flow from operations."

It looks to me like GLF might be a survivor. In the past ten years they've been
profitable every year. Returns --- net profit margins --- are now an astounding
and unsustainable 44.6% (some one-time ship sales, I believe). Otoh, profit
margins have been high also in past few years and sales have increased too.
Although, back otoh, sales increases have come from acquisitions, and profit
margins have dropped when the oil business cycle has been difficult. Although
roe is over 20% now, in the past ten years (which might include the up and down
cycle), roe has averaged 11 percent. Back again otoh, the company is trading
below stated book value now.

While this stock doesn't meet my screen p/e criterion (forward p/e estimate of
4 is higher, not lower, than current p/e of 2.8), this stock fits my other
model criteria. Also, I like the business: I am hoping and betting that
off-shore servicing must and will continue, and that GulfMark will continue to
get its share of profitable contracts.

I'll add more if stock will drop to lows on no adverse news.

Upping my AZN position a little as stock drops to five year low.

Low pe (about 8), high roe (32%, 5-yr. avg), low psr (1.5)

Company profitable 9 of past 10 years (1999 was the red year). D/e at .74
currently. For years, before the company began making recent acquisitions, the
d/e ratio was under .16.

Decent dividend yield. Maybe about 7%. (Last two semi-annual payments were
$1.50 and .55, per Yahoo. I don't know if that's net to USA stockholder or
gross, if there's any UK tax withheld.)

SNDA - Nobody on this thread cares about SNDA, but it's one of the few stocks
in positive territory for 2008/2009. They reported good results for 2008. IMO
though the company is fairly valued to a bit overvalued here. Great balance
sheet. Earnings/EV are OK, but not great. Expected return is not great unless
one makes optimistic assumptions, like continued 25% growth and similar ROE. I
lightened a bit here, I may lighten even more from an oversized position.

I bought some MSFT in 16.x range.

SYT is at 38.2% retracement point from the fall of $65 to $27. 50% retracement

I added a more wfc sold my position in SD to do it. getting crushed on O&G as
it is. listened to the M interview on 60 minutes about Maddoff. Nothing really
new, except how bad a job the SEC does as discovering frauds before the body
count rises to epidemic proportions. I am very sad that so many many people and
institutions have suffered such catastrophic losses, because of incompetent
advisors and regulatory agency. Its a disgrace, and why arent people up in arms
about how incompetent the regulatory authorities have been. its just
mindboggling what people have gotten away with. I dont understand how BOD of
JPM can allow granting of $110 million in grants and SARs and a month later let
them cut the dividend from $.40 to a nickel and no one says squat about it, and
Im not even a shareholder here.

Every bank except for BBT and WFC has cut their divvy. BBT actually increased
their divvy, but I'm not sure the FED will allow them to do so. They might
actually demand that BBT lower the payout so the divvy is less than earnings.
BBT has an excellent TCE ration though.

It really doesn't bother me to see the banks do the right thing by cutting the
divvies to preserve capital and protect preferred share dividends. PNC just cut
their divvy to 10 cents from $2.64. I would be more inclined to trust the banks
that have already cut the divvy rather than hold out for a bank like WFC to
come out and cut the divvy later.

There is just no way to pay TARP divvies, preferred divvies, and bondholders -
plus all of the common shareholders. The net savings from the elimination of
divvies has been one thing the analysts have not yet contemplated. BAC is
saving $10 billion a year in divvies, C is saving at least that much, JPM is
saving $5 billion a year, PNC is saving $1 billion a year, etc...

Many years of dividend increases. Lot of business in Chicago. That should maybe

You are of course referring to banks domiciled and primarily doing business in

HSBC just slashed their divvy to 8 cents a quarter. RBS eliminated their divvy,
and BCS appears as if a divvy cut is inevitable. I would have to assume the
same stands true for the rest of the banks in Europe. They all need to preserve
capital.

I don't know any Latin American banks to defend or attack. Banco Santander has
a lot of exposure to Latin America, and their dividend looks like it's going to
be cut or eliminated too. Maybe not, I hope they are fine.

Dividends are an allusive concept for long term investing. They are great for
building long term returns, but they are turning into nightmares for people
looking for total returns right now. It's an entitlement program for the rich

Paul, it's an understandable sentiment, and these people should definitely be
held accountable. But, to be blunt, they had a lot of help. Society as a whole
was an enabler of what was going on. There were plenty of alarm bells - look
back at what Buffett, Bill Fleckenstein, Jeremy Grantham, James Grant, and many
others were writing. While the degree of devastation that would result may not
have been obvious to us all, and the timing could certainly not be predicted,
the rottenness of the entire system was apparent. From most, especially from
those in power, the reactions ranged from a shrug of the shoulders to tortured
rationalizations of what was going on.

So, while I strongly support accountability, especially financial
accountability, for the malefactors, I think the (understandable) desire for
punitive action against the scapegoats is misguided. Our energy is better
directed towards figuring out why it happened and how to prevent it from
happening again.

The last time around we got the SEC (with teeth) and Glass-Steagall. It took a
long time for those safeguards to be unwound. Let's focus on protecting the
next generation as well as the victims of the Depression did.

My utility stock of choice for the moment.

At todays close, 2010 PE of 7.4 @ $3.60 eps.

PPL - Last quarter eps .46 Dividend .34

Will These 6 Stocks Cut Their Dividends?

http://www.fool.com/investing/dividends-income/2009/02/20/will-these-6-stocks-c
t-their-dividends.aspx

In the current environment anything is possible.

Currently showing $2.90 in cash per share.

From The Street report dated Feb. 5th:

The company reaffirmed its FY09 earnings per share guidance of $1.60 to $1.90.
PPL expects FY10 earnings
per share of $3.60 to $4.20.

From an S+P report seeing $3.70 eps in 2010:

"For 2009, we expect EPS to decline nearly 15%
from anticipated results in 2008....... However,
we see a sharp rise in 2010 earnings as
expired energy contracts are replaced by much
higher-margin contracts."

If you said you wanted to execute some members of the SEC, bank regulators, and
members of congress who oversaw banking and financial institutions, you would
get no argument from me. How Dodd, for example, who got advantaged treatment
from WM according to reports I have read, is still on the commitee, is beyond
me. Worst of all I have yet to hear one word from anyone as to how they are
going to change how they regulate hedgefunds, security companies, banks, or
even charities which I thought had regulations of their own. No one is asking
why non=profits and charities, were permitted to invest in hedgefunds. I dont
understand this. I mean ok if you put 4% of your funds into a hedge fund but
some of these charities lost 75% and more of their funds as they had so much
invested with madoff.
