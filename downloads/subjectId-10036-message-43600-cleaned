Have you researched into QCOM, I know that business is a bit expensive however
they are specializing in the CPU for mobile products.

sorry, QCOM hasn't been on my radar in over a decade. (I did hold it for a
short time back around 2000 but haven't followed since). Haven't looked into
why, but it hasn't passed the consideration screens in a very long time.

Yes, its still an unattractive company for a value investor but I believe that
they have a chance to be successful in their niche and they may grow because
the mobile segment is growing.

If i have to bet, INTC and QCOM is where i'll bet there but as always, Apple
will be the best bet overall. Their continued dominance is overwhelming.

Interesting piece from SA on some new ETFs being launched by Global X. I

but I am warming to the idea of toll roads and ports.

I don't see that no one would invest in 210 positions, personally I would
invest in no less than 150 stocks, and to make a good coverage of the
opportunities I may exceed 200.

And what 21 stocks are you talking about ? The stats you read are for the
entire list of 210.

To explain what may not be clear for you, I made the picks in April 2010, I
added a number of them to the portfolio on the market simulator around June
2010, because of the miscalculations on the market simulator I thought the 60
stocks portfolio experienced a Black Swan and that it was enough to prove my
strategy, as it has been cleared on this forum it was just a miscalculation and
the 60 stocks were not actually a success. The main reasons why I didn't add
the entire list to a simulation portfolio is because it was a lot of work, and
I didn't want to share with the public the full list that summarizes my entire
work.

So I opened the file that included my entire list and did the calculations by
myself. I know you see no evidence that I did really make the said picks on the
said period, but I have the verifiable evidence which is the property of the
text file that says "Last modified on 04-15-2010".

I am not talking about any weighting, normative method, I think I am very well
aware of the limitations of normative calculation methods.

If I did not publish the file it doesn't mean it is not true, here is a
VERIFIABLE fact: I picked 210 companies in April-2010. If all was held it would
have made over +350%, if the stocks that doubled were sold at their highest
levels the overall growth would be +2900%.

I have the text file that was not edited any time after 15-Apr-2010, which
includes ONLY the 210 companies. I also have an Excel spreadsheet I made
yesterday which supports the calculations.

And I can't believe how many times I must answer this question: I do not
predict Black Swans! Nobody can! They are unpredictable by definition. The
strategy is about increasing your investments' exposure to big unexpected
growth, aka Positive Black Swans.

A portfolio that would make x29 in 15 months is a Black Swan!

The portfolio satisfies all three conditions to be a Black Swan:

1. Unpredictable: all the companies were in the shadows and they stayed with
their cheap prices until what nobody expected happened; depending on each
company there was unexpected good data published and the after-effect investors
started buying to drive the prices up.

2. Carries massive consequences: it is the big growth, which is theoretically
unlimited or with no known limits; the said results were in only 15 months,
with a number of stocks trending right now and none of us knows how far they
will keep on going, or will they start their downtrend, despite what many
traders might think, nobody knows what is going to happen.

3. After the event people start to make sense of what happened even though
there is no sense to make: now investors look at the successful companies and
they'll make their conclusions about what "factors of success" made it happen,
or what is "the lesson to learn". There are no factors of success and no
lessons to learn, it was all unexpected.

I am very happy with my results, what is sad is that I had no money to invest,
and it was not applied to anybody's investments.

Hi Paul -

What Web site do you use to check New 52wk lows? I have found the FINVIZ.com
screener pretty good. I run the New low list then sort by PE..
http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=ta_highlow52w_nl&ft=3&o=pe&r=61

SEP came up as one I want to add. It hit a new low AND went xdividend today.
Trying to add a few shares in the $28.00/share range, RAM came up on the list
but I am not going to add any shares at this time. NYB is on the list, glad I
closed out this position in the $16.00/share range. No plans to add this one
either.

Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) may be a possible candidate value buy but I
want to see their exposure to cloud computing. Both trailing and Forward PEs
are very low. I have it on my watch list and may start a tracking position some
time in the future.

OT - You are proposing to look at underlying stocks and that's really the way
to go.

However, if someone decides to buy the ETFs, here are some caveats about small
specialized ETFs.

- If they remain small and unpopular, they get closed
- Original company percentages in their portfolio are usually skewed in
market-cap weighed fashion, which may lead to ETF being equivalent to 2-3
biggest holdings
- Even if original percentages look fine, if ETF grows, they may have trouble
maintaining the percentages of their portfolio. Assume that they have 1%
weighting in a small cap from India. If ETF grows from 10M to 100M, they have
to increase their Indian stock holding 10 times! This might be impossible due
to small float, ownership restrictions, etc. Even if it's possible, it might be
that the ETF is driving the price up by buying the stock (and it would crash
if/when ETF tries to liquidate, since no one else would support that price).

So caveat emptor. :)

Either your portfolio is weighted or your calculations of the return are not
correct.

You have 22 100% losses for companies that went kaput. If your portfolio is not
weighted (investment in every company was the same), you need at least 22 gains
of 353%+100% to cover the losses AND get to your 353% return. Actually, you
need even more, but I am being conservative. However, in
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27525701 where you listed
best performing stocks of the portfolio, there are only four stocks that exceed
353% and only one stock that exceeds 453% gain. So obviously you either weighed
the portfolio or you miscalculated (again). I will guess that you
miscalculated, because otherwise you had to hugely overweigh the 4 stocks that
showed 300%+ return to get to your 353% result.

So check your math please. ;)

Overall, I still don't believe your approach is in any way related to value
investing. And it's not clear to me what you are doing on this thread except
trying to sell your paper returns.

I agree with Jurgis Bekepuris. Really, this is a value investing thread wherein
we essentially want to identify value stocks and explore value opportunities.

From what I understand, you have a unique way of looking at stocks that
incorporates the black swans. I don't know what your objective is -- you
haven't actually make money buying stocks you've identified with your
methodology, because you apparently are a student with not enough financial
resources . You either need to convince someone or some people to try your
ideas and spread the word. Or else write a book. I like that idea. That would
get you noticed, maybe on tv, maybe help your consulting business. There are
occasionally a few investing books that come out at just the right time to
capture the public's fancy. For me, that'd be something like Beardstown Ladies,
or Gorilla&King Investing. "Black Swan Investing" might be a timely write. Jmo.

Not that I concur with any of your stock picks or investing methodology. I have
no idea what your buying criteria are. You haven't clarified a selling
strategy. Your website offers a representative sample of stocks, although your
buy suggestion is at least 150 stocks. Everything is theoretical: you coulda
made money "if".

Among all investment strategies value investing is the most realistic one and
the nearest one to Black Swan trading.

Actually I have explained in a previous post some of the key concept of my

Obviously one of my goals is to make benefits from my strategy but that's not
why I am here, despite being a new member and my few contributions so far I am
planning to be part of this community for a long time and to visit most often
this particular thread. I speak when a given post is interesting enough for me,
otherwise I am reading quietly.

Thanks for valuable suggestions, but I recall an interesting proverb that says
"those who know do, the others teach". I'll keep looking for an interested
investor, this is "silicon investor" right ? I am almost sure not everyone will
pass on the opportunity.

I am 24 years old student with no funds to invest and no actual experience
trading, and I am happy with my accomplishments as I developed a strategy that
was mentioned very briefly in Taleb's books and picked 210 stocks accordingly
that made astonishing results in a very short period of time.

Badi, You should be able to open an Ameritrade account (any others out there
with no/low minimums?)with $1000.00 or less. That will let you buy stocks that
fit your model. Not 200 but a few. As others have said, correctly, if you
haven't put your real money to work you haven't done as much as you think. I
assign two tasks to students; go out and earn $200.00-not from your job, don't
just write a check if you have money, but do something that someone will pay
you for to earn that $200.00. Collect cans, do chores, wash cars, whatever.
Then open your account and invest the money. That's it. I used to have them do
simulated portfolios with $10,000.00. They learned almost nothing. The real
$200.00 was a game changer. Even students who had millions saw everything
differently. It's amazing. Go earn some money and put it to work and tell us
what happens. I'm sure everyone here will be rooting for you to do well. ken

the other hand, they have some ongoing litigation in Spain, the cost of which
might be material to the company (according to their own SEC filing).

However, you are correct. If i am betting on this industry in the medium term (

OMG, you just summed it? OMG. I am lost for words.

OK, go and learn math and stat. When you understand how to calculate return, we
can talk again. Because right now you are just embarrassing yourself. I hope
you're not a math or economics major...

For anyone who is too lazy or math challenged to perform calculations, badi_'s
real return on the given portfolio is... 1.7%

Paste his numbers to Excel. For each number calculate =(100+CellNo)*0.01 <-
this is what $1 invested into the stock would turn into at the end of holding
period. Sum the resulting numbers <- this is the value of portfolio at the end
of holding period. Divide the value by 209 <- this is the value of the
portfolio in the beginning. Voila.

So much for "Black Swans"...

Hi Clownbuck

Thanks very much for the info. I would agree with you that toll roads and
cement are completely different businesses. I think the article was just
highlighting the new ETFs that are going to be launched by Global X. Personally
I like the idea of a couple of companies being toll roads or ports in my
portfolio, and if they have good underlying assets and long concessions, the
theory goes is that these companies will be steady income distributors (though
of course, other investors may prefer to invest in fixed income or preferred
stock).

The other industries are like are farmland/timberland and railroads. Of course,
any of the companies I eventually look at may not just be listed in US, but as
everything, it still remains a work in progress.

As a personal rule, I don't like ETFs in general, but I like the kind of ideas
they can generate. So far I don't think Global X has released the constituents
of the 2 ETFs I am most interested in ie tolls roads and ports & farming and
timberland (or at least I can't find any info on them!). I have some idea of
listed toll roads companies, mainly in Europe, South America and Australasia.

Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC (MIC)
Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc. (NYSE: PCL )

You might check out Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC (MIC). The parent
company ( Macquarie Group Limited )owns 8% of MIC and I believe also controls
several toll roads and airports in or around Australia (
http://www.macquarie.com/mgl/mig ). Their Toll road company is called Intoll
(ITO) http://www.intoll.com .

I bought MIC around $8 a few years ago and it tanked down to $4 and in the 2010
it rallied up past my purchase price so I sold and was happy to make a few
dollars. I now see that the company is around $26 carries a BV of $15 and
started to pay a divided yielding 3.1%,

I originally bought the company for their core assets serving the NG industry.
They had a pretty good exclusive NG operation in Hawaii that was quite
profitable. I neglected to realize the huge amount of debt they had and when
the 2009 crash occurred they suffered for that.

I like your general theory in the group of assets you are looking at: toll
roads, farming, and timberland but I never really found a pure "profitable"
play. I did own Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc. (NYSE: PCL ) for their
timberland resources but after owning it for about five years, I did not see
the LT returns I expected. I sold it for a small profit and move the proceeds
into big integrated oil.

Looking at the current prices of each of these companies, I would have been
better off to hold them. They are both selling near their all time highs and
have outperformed the S&P 500 (if you bought and sold at the right time).

F;_ylu=X3oDMTEydDA3OGxkBHBvcwMxMQRzZWMDeWZpVGFibGlzdARzbGsDZGV0YWlsZWQ-

In hindsight, the "Black Swan" positive play was to bu MIC in 2009 on or nears
it's low around 3 and at today's price represents a 4 bagger in only 24 months.
I was all over this company and didn't pull the trigger to load up (because of
that large debt). I bought Oshkosh Corporation (OSK)instead around $5 (this
turned into a 2 bagger). BTW OSK hit the new 52wk low list and Carl Ichan has
begun to accumulate a large position.

chucked retailers. The fashion retailer has been an accurate predictor of
fashion trends, consumer preferences and general economic conditions in recent

lower-income clientele got hit in the downturn. Still, the company has no debt
and nearly $75 million in cash and short-term investments, and it generates
more than enough cash to self-fund 15% growth in overall square footage each
year.

"It has an extraordinary return on investment because its rents are so low," he
says. Plus, Citi Trends, which went public in 2005, may be a takeover candidate
since private-equity firms have become more active in retail businesses. The
shares have traded lately at 14, about 35 times the Street's 2012

you that the level of debt within MIC will make any potential investor nervous
(see http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=MIC+Balance+Sheet&annual) . In this case I
would say that due to the long term nature of their assets, one would have to
look and see what the maturity profile of the debt is. It goes without saying
that the longer the due dates are for the outstanding debt the better, as in

But I avoid the biased thinking you may want to read this post

I don't buy Extremistan stocks when they are up no matter what good data they

or something new and unexpected. I have a few cents I am ready to invest, but
they won't go to Google anyway. Black Swan stocks are like fireworks you don't
know how far they will keep on going in the sky but most surely they will fall
back.

A great example of how conventional analysis can be misleading are the
financial companies that went bankrupt in the late crisis, take Lehman Brothers
for example, they had wonderful ratings shortly before they collapsed. May be
I'll get into options trading to short sell bubbles just like Taleb does...

Re: Penn Virginia Corp. (PVA)

Never really looked at EVA as a metric as it seems too difficult to calculate.
In theory it sounds good but I do not know how applicable it is at deriving a
fair value for a stock.

According to the article PVA has a high EVA but the stock continues to test new
lows. I do believe that PVA could have a fair value of between $19.00/share -
$40.00/share based on the price of natural gas. The company has over the last
year increased it's "oily" reserves (discovering several new wells on their
Eagle Ford Shale acreage) and perhaps their EVA metric is now reflecting the
added economic value of their investment into this asset. I figure these new
oil wells have added at least $4.00/share in value to the company (based on Ip
well results to date) and when completed with their Eagle Ford Shale drilling
program could add another $16.00/share.

<u>Economic Value Added</u> - EVA

http://wiki.fool.com/Economic_Value_Added

Developed by consulting firm Stern Stewart & Co., the idea behind EVA is that
if a company’s operating income is larger than its cost of capital, that
business is creating value for shareholders. Stern Stewart originally created
EVA to help managers gauge the performance of their own businesses, but
investors have since adopted it as a useful metric for sizing up a company.

EVA helps you tack together all of the tinier pieces of the puzzle so that you
have a more accurate picture of the profit a company is actually churning out
-- and it’s this economic profit that translates into shareholder value. The
equation is:

(NOPAT) - ([Total Assets - Current Liabilities] x WACC)

===============================================================================
=====================

<u>Penn Virginia's Management Is Creating Value</u>
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/07/29/penn-virginias-management-is-c
eating-value.aspx

From the article:"...So what does this mean for investors? A positive reading
on EVA momentum means a company has created value by increasing its EVA, and a
negative EVA momentum means EVA has decreased and less value is being created.
EVA momentum is one of the few performance measurements, if not the only one,
with such a clear dividing line between good and bad performance.

The best companies, then, create value in excess of their cost of capital, as
reflected by positive EVA momentum. The higher the EVA momentum, the faster
management is creating value...."

"...With an EVA momentum of 27.1%, Penn Virginia's economic value added
increased year over year, placing it in the ninth percentile of all companies
in the Russell 3000. One of the three remaining companies had positive EVA
momentum over the past 12 months...."

"...Businesses with high EVA momentum are effectively creating value. It will
be interesting to see how useful this extremely new metric proves to be for
companies and investors. If it lives up to its promise, it will be an essential
tool in investors' arsenals...."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------

I wonder if EVA is used in other company valuations and if it is a good
predictor ( ie leading indicator) of undervalued companies. Have not really
seen the metric used before when comparing other similar companies.

FWIW, I continue adding to my under water shares in PVA and will be making
another add on any price around $12.60/share. They have 3 rigs drilling on
their 14,000 Eagle Ford Shale acreage, spending $187M and plan on completing 24
wells during this investment cycle (2011). Note: First six wells completed
produce oil ranging from 582-1,876 BOE/d.

ConocoPhillips (COP) said Thursday it has agreed to buy 46,000 acres in the

The deal comes two weeks after the oil giant unveiled plans to split its

said it represents a " significant investment." Conoco will operate the

Hi Georgi,

The NYSE listing is a sponsored ADR, meaning Cameco's shares are held by the
depository bank and Cameco has a direct involvement in the issuance of the
receipts. Usually, the correction would occur through arbitrage of the shares -
selling the overvalued and buying the undervalued. This could be done by
regular investors or sometimes the depository bank (Bank of New York Mellon is
the largest) could do it - think of BRK/B shares which are trading at a
fraction of BRK/A as the depository bank keeps them in check.

They have been selling off their NG & Oil assets to focus on their pipeline
operations. In 2010 the company formed Pace Oil & Gas Ltd. with their remaining

down their large debt and have created a premiere "pure" Midstream company.

OHI "It's not clear to me that anybody actually knows right now what cuts will
hit healthcare reits".

> the government plans to cut Medicare reimbursement rates by 11.1 percent.

And here's another opinion, that I do not buy into:
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Skilled-nursing-facility-apf-3799966674.html?x=0&
v=1

..............

Your comment is correct. Immediate medicare cuts are known, but future ones are
unknown. And the effect on these reits is also unknown. And there is a layer of
protection because they own the buildings and do not operate the businesses.
But if the operators are nailed, it will trickle down (up?). But that's all
speculation. And then, even if the profitability of the reits like LTC, are
unaffected. Will all the news over the next year beat the stock down anyway?
IMO, there are much better investments elsewhere.

re Nippon Soda 4041.T. Sold my position today at 386 Yen. This worked out OK
after a rough patch. I continue to hold NOF Corporation 4403.T. The good
performance of Japanese stocks surprises me. I believe it is in large part
because the dire predictions that the Japanese would falter after the tsunami
and the following nuclear disaster did not happen. in fact the WSJ had an
article that stated that Tokyo survived the summer without any brownouts to to
a colossal effort of the population and the companies hat reduced energy
consumption by 23% YoY, more than enough to compensate for the loss of nuclear

I'd be interested to know your exact parameters for picking Black Swan stocks.
It seems at least partially subjective, but maybe that is my misunderstanding.

For awhile I watched the large daily down movers of stocks. Arguably there are
many stocks that over-react to the downside on some bad news. But I figured I
could not quickly figure out enough about unfamiliar stocks to make a practice
of looking over those stocks.

I am a little intrigued by binary stocks. By this, I mean stocks that will
either do well, or go out of business or nearly go out of business. A stock in
bankruptcy reorganization or a stock with it welfare dependent on a lawsuit is
an example, or for that matter a small cap stock that has put everything into
development of a drug. If you do your analysis, you can find some good buys
with these. But my impression is that to buy a field of these stocks would not
be productive.

Friedman Industries Inc. (FRD)

I am adding this one to my watch list. They have no debt, pay a 4.4% dividend
and have a forward PE of 8.04. Those sounds like pretty attractive value
numbers. ROE at 14% is ok too. They have a small division that builds tubular
well pipe from their flat rolled steel product. Stock is near it's highs so, I
have it on my watch list and on a 10% correction, this one might be an
attractive value buy. The company produces ERW (Electric Resistance Welded)
STEEL PIPE - Steel pipe for use in the water well industry, steel building
columns, steel pipe piling, water and air lines, metal fabrication, fencing,
road bore, culverts, sign posts and other structural applications. Steel used
for the farm or ranch (well & irrigation pipe, fencing, culverts) also fits my
AG theme.

I will do a bit more research on more local producers as well pipe demand is
specific to the shale region (FRD is located in Texas) and the closer the
manufacturer the lower the transportation costs. I am not too interested in any
of the foreign suppliers at this time.

I sold my GGB in March 2011 around $13.40/share and noticed that it has fallen
back down to $8.85/share. My previous buy was 3/2009 @ $5.37/share. This one is
attractive to me as they supply steel for use in Brazil and the development of
their infrastructure and offshore oil fields. I may begin to nibble at another
starter position on any sell off down to $6.50/share.

The important consideration for me on this cycle is to look at those niche
suppliers/producers that have little or no debt. I want them to cater to a
growing local market but are a small enough player where such a niche market is
large enough for the company to grow. FRD fits this mold (it may be too small).
GGB is a bit too large a company unless you can get it a a significant
discount. They also carry a bit more debt than I would like.

There is nothing precise about this, you may want read this post where I
explain some of the key concepts:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27508131

Black Swan stocks are exactly the extreme stocks, or binary stocks like you
call them, when below they have the tendency to go very high, when very high
they have the tendency to go low.

You mentioned the example of the company working on a drug, it is not the drug
itself that is important, or whatever the company is planning to do, what
matters mostly is the fact the company is researching, take Viagra as an
example of great discoveries made by accident. What matters is researching ...
Here comes the importance of studying how the research facility is managed.

The raw list of Black Swan stocks may need some serious, deep research and
filtering to be finally usable.

When I have time I will compile a raw list for your fun of research.

What you think of OTC stocks ? There are many opportunities there.

NOF Corp had it day in the sun today - gaping up because of what I believe was

My plan is to shift the focus to Europe. ML.PA (Michelin) is the target. I am

As a longer term investment - 4091.T Taiyo Nippon Sanso looks good. it appears
to be the leading industrial gas supplier in Japan. Industrial gas is a great
business and many new technologies need technical gases in one way or another
(Computer chips, solar cells, diodes , medical). it's a great way to benefit
from LT technology growth without incurring technology risk. 4091 does not look
cheap on the surface (this year, they incurred specuial charges due to
earthquake damage) but based on next years forecast, the PE ratio is ~12X and
EV/EBITDA (current year) is around 6.8. This is quite a bit cheaper than peers
Air Liquide, Airgas, Praxair or Linde. I am looking for a buying below 600Yen.

re BG, ADM - thanks for the background info regarding BG. After another look
today (I last checked on them ~1 1/2 years ago and soured on them because of an
uneven earnings track record) I in fact like them better than ADM.

Since they sold the fertilizer business in 2010 for 3-4B$, they seemed to are
in the process to retool the company. They are adding grain terminals in the
Black see (Ukraine) and the West coast, they purchased some sugar milling
assets in Brazil (`~1.1B$ was the cost if I remember correctly) and generally
add assets to gain international scope. I like this very much.

What I do not like is their track record of really bad earning misses. Quite a
few were caused by the fertilizer business. I also don't like that they issued
shares to buy the Brazilian sugar mills even though they had more than 3B$ in
cash (from the sale of the fertilizer business) coming in just a few month
later. (The sale of the fertilizer business was already in process when they
bought the sugar mills). Things like that really irked me and I sold my shares
in the 50$ range.

You are correct that ADM corn syrup business may be in a LT decline and the
ethanol business does not look that great either. Operational, I do rate them
above BG though. Anyways those are things to consider when buying ADM or BG.

FWIW, I am surprised by the low profitability of both ADM and BG. They trade at
about 9x EBITDA/EV, which is not very cheap. It may be because they need to
hold on to a fair amount of seasonal inventory (grain harvest) to support their
business.

The shares available through the pink sheets is their ADR (Vallourec SA VLOWY).
Five of the VLOWY ADR equals 1 ordinary share. They pay an annual dividend
every August. For 2011 it is $0.2899/ADR share or about 1.5% yield. Their Ohio
division is small compared to the total size of the company. My guess is that
facility represents only 5% of their total sales. It's hard to evaluate the
company's financials as it is foreign (a French company). Don't have any idea

higher raw material costs. Stock dropped over 15% on that news.

Re: BG (& AG stocks)

Those were some of the same conclusions I arrived at. The fertilizer
subsidiaries can really help or hurt the company's earnings just look at CF
Industries Holdings, Inc. Co(: CF) or Agrium Inc. Common Stock(: AGU). Because
BG sold off their fertilizer division (I think they sold it to AGU) it should
be less susceptible to these large swings. I still like Agrium Inc. Common
Stock(NYSE: AGU) and it's my No 2 pick as a large AG player but I have yet to
buy any shares.

I did cover my EI DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD) short (I sold some covered calls
45 days ago) as I like their seed division and I feel it is a better play than
Monsanto Co. (MON). That is the only reason why I continue to hold my DD shares
that I bought 1/2009 at around $23.50/share.

I am also looking at some smaller cap AG companies specifically Omega Protein
Corporation Commo(NYSE: OME) a fish oil producer and Friedman Industries Inc.
Common(AMEX: FRD) a steel fabricator of pipe for use in the water well
industry, irrigation, fencing, culverts and posts. FRD is a new name to me but
are local located in TEXAS and supply finished products to the rural farmer,
specifically irrigation pipe & well linings which are needed in the ongoing
drought.

My focus is to deploy new money over time so I build up a 8%-10% position in
the portfolio that represents a basket of local and global AG companies.
Presently I have about a 2% exposure. Here is a list of companies I currently
own that comprise my AG basket:
http://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/DD,BG,AGU,ADM,MNHVF.PK,OME,FBR,NOBGF.PK,ULTR,AM
PF.PK,FRD/view/dv;_ylt=Alatq7MqK7VkRLHxRIrCd9oLv7gF;_ylu=X3oDMTEydDA3OGxkBHBvcw
xMQRzZWMDeWZpVGFibGlzdARzbGsDZGV0YWlsZWQ-

ULTR is a shipping company with a River Barge Business that transports soy
beans & wood chips from central Brazil to ocean ports for storage, processing
and eventual transport to China. (Note: Of the group I have positions in all
EXCEPT AGU and FDA at this time).

I consider that most in not all of these companies provide a value proposition
in either the assets they own or operate and/or the cash flows they generate
and/or their attractive PE (low sector PE's). Hopefully with a growing world
wide Ag sector, these company's will participate in this growth.
