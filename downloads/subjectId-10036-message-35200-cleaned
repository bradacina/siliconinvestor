I like SKYW too, but I pass on it.

That discount to stated bv is unusually low at .63 (per Yahoo). In 9 of past 10
years it's been at 1.1 or higher. And p/e is similarly low too.

Company has been profitable in each of the past ten years. That actually
bothers me. As I view the company (always has a been at a surface view), it's a
feeder or supplier company to the big airlines United, Delta. These majors are
near or in bk (??), so I always figure (apparently wrongly) that there should
be some executives at these majors saying, "Whoa. We're unprofitable, but our
feeder SKYW is doing great? We need to really renegotiate the terms of our
agreements with SKYW the next go'round." And the fear of that happening, which
would be to SKYW's detriment (I presume), keeps me out of the stock.

Spekulatius, I've considered your post, and I give up on finding any good
clunker-car ideas to short.

Maybe Group 1, or perhaps Sonic. Group 1 has suspended their clunker program as
of today because of paperwork issues with the government. (The program ends
Monday anyway, I believe.) These companies have exposure to southern states and
may be adversely affected by hurricanes this season.

The stocks in the sector seem to me to rise and fall together. So if shorting,
it may not matter which auto retailer one chooses. My bet would be GPI at
current price.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GPI

Nice if somebody bought at lows this year---almost ten baggers on some. (Aside:
Geez! So quickly and so large. If I didn't see it, I wouldn't believe it. Sorry
I missed it. These auto retailers run on a lot of debt, e.g. 2:1 d/e, and that
scared me out when the debt market froze in that Nov-Mar period.)

I don't know about Ford or parts suppliers, or anything else related that I
could see as a short here.

I own PAG: I like Mr. Penske for his business acumen. In addition to being
"just" an auto retailer, PAG has bought the Saturn business from GM, and PAG is
the only dealer(distributor) of the "Smart Fortwo" in the USA. So that gives
PAG some added profit opportunities.

No problem, Paul. I believe I've followed you into some winners along the way,
so I'm glad to return the favor.

My view on SPPR is that the Hotel Reits in general have really been moving up
the last few weeks and SPPR was stuck at it's old high of 1.85. Once it got
enough buying pressure to finally move through that level, it ran. I just felt
like it caught up to the rest of the sector today.

That being said, nothing wrong with taking a quick 20-30% gain. I have been
selling shares in FCH on the way up, and another day like today in SPPR and I
will start selling it also.

The risk/reward ratio in these hotel reits is getting more unfavorable as we
move higher. I think there are better sectors that I will be rotating my money
into if we move up much more. I've already started a bit with buying some FVE.

I'll consider cashing out my NOC shares as well.

NOC may not be fully-valued (imo), but perhaps it's not undervalued either. The
dividend yield at 3.6% isn't bad; otoh it's not great either. P/e at 9 (for '10
estimates) is low for NOC; otoh, 9 itself isn't really low in this market.
Maybe 9 is even reasonable for a company like NOC where roe is never that good.
A possible trade off for the p/e is that since NOC is so entrenched in the USA
federal defense business (Northrop = the Pentagon's third-largest contractor by
sales), it's likely to still keep winning big procurement orders. Maybe NOC is
too important to fail, and so that's built into the stock price as a
margin-of-safety? Not convinced of this.

My shares purchased 10/'08 and I show an overall small loss. I believe I'd
rather sell than hold, and just use the cash to deploy elsewhere...

...and I have a lot of cash to deploy elsewhere. If I only knew where elsewhere
was. -g-

==============
NOC seems representative of stocks in my portfolio. While I haven't checked
everywhere and everything to confirm, it just seems like anything that I bought
July-Dec '08 still shows a loss with those specific shares. Otoh, shares of
everything that I bought Jan-April seem to show a gain. Overall, my portfolios
are down from '08, and I don't hold much hope they'll get back up there anytime
soon.

I agree with your assessment regarding NOC - it's not a sell but far from a buy

has topped out several times at about 50$ before which is where we are right
now. I decided to do some sales and sold those names that i have the least

I am not afraid to carry large cash balances - i think there will always be

Revisiting this post as I'm trying to find new places to put cash as I want to
diversify.

Your point:

'When I look at stocks like FVE, SKH, MDTH, SUNH with an unbiased eye, they
compare very favorable to hotel stocks.'

I agree with you in regards to FVE, which I why I bought some shares. But from
my research, FVE is more like a hotel than the other 3 you mention. It seems
like the other 3 are more involved in medical care than FVE and therefore have
more at stake in the possible health care changes coming. I would imagine that
one of the reasons these companies are down is because of fear of potential
changes.

FVE may be down because of fear, but I think it's a bit unfounded based on
their business model. But, I may be wrong.

health care changes will impact the demand and intermediaries more so than the

Cwillyg. I have ACTS but am wary that it might not be safe.

The article's author states:

"My list of net cash stocks that I like is down to just three names. I have
owned Silicon Graphics, Actions Semiconductor and Adaptec for most of the year
and I expect to own them for a long time to come.
I would have to check the history books to be absolutely sure, but I do not
recall ever losing money on a stock that I purchased for less than cash on the
balance sheet and I do expect to lose on theses three."

My experience with these below-cash stocks is different. I agree a buyer of
these types should expect to hold a while. More like three years than one year.

However, I am one who certainly has lost money on stocks I've "purchased for
less than cash on the balance sheet". Some of these entrenched managers just
keep draining assets. Secure in their jobs, they just keep collecting their
salaries and riding these cigar butts down into the company's death spiral. For
some stocks I've held, eventually the cash gets consumed, or the cash amounts
will fall so far that the stock price gets to be above the cash/sh value. At
which point the margin-of-safety takes a hit in my view, or my ruling reason
for buying disappears and I decide to just take the loss and move on.

Fwiw here are some cigar-butt cash-rich or asset-rich stocks I am holding now:

WNMLA.PK. Sum of its parts is worth more than the stock. Is what I believed
when I bought the stock 10/06. Still may be true although the stock is about
50% lower now.

TRID. I was warned about this one by Jugis Bekepuris, who's been right so far.
Buys from 12/'07 to '09, my cost basis is $4.01 (always buying with stock below
cash/sh). Stock is now $1.84 with cash/sh. down to $3.06. I am holding on.

ASCMA. In at $24 in Feb. when it sold for under cash/sh. Cash/sh has fallen to
$22/sh (per Yahoo); stock price though now has moved up to $27. I am holding
on.
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Ascent-Media-2Q-loss-widens-apf-1177775877.html?x
0&.v=1

ACTS. Below cash/sh. I am holding on. Just a very small bet.

AFOP. Stock at $1.03/sh with cash/sh at .93. Both above my purchase price. I am
holding on.

GAI. Have shares from '06 with several adds this year. My cost basis $9.06 with
stock at $8.64 and cash/sh. about $9. (I believe I read that cash/sh is about
$9, not the $13 that Yahoo shows.)
I'll continue to hold shares.

ADPT. In again for another try with a buy in May for a small amount at $2.84.
Stock now $3.01 with cash/sh $3.19. (Have somewhat heeded cautionary note from
Jugis Bekepuris about this company's lagging technology; so only a very small
bet for me.)

FACT. $10.26/sh net cash. Stock at $10.99/sh. I'm in for a very few shares
since May at 9.09. In my view, from the little I see, this thing is a cigar
butt with no earnings and very little public history. How somebody like
Baupost's Margin of Safety guy Seth Klarman can find his Margin here, I do not
really understand. I would be presuming this biotech company would just burn
through its cash like so many others. (ie. no margin of safety just because it
shows now a high cash/sh figure)
I'm in because of the cash/sh and because I'm just trying an experiment to see
if I can ride this guy's coattails. If stock drops under 10 on no adverse news,
I'll just add a few more shares to my "speculation" (which would be an
"investment" for Mr. Klarman since he's done all the research.)

I own some ACTS. On one hand the company buys back shares. On the other hand,
it makes about 7.7M share dilution for their employees (sorry, can't find the
reference anymore). And they are losing money right now with unclear future.
IMHO, it's not a buy, it may be a weak hold. I am holding it partially because
I don't see much better ideas right now.

Overall, my philosophy is to buy only (marginally) profitable net-nets. Money
losing net-nets usually continue to lose it until they have no more. There are
some exceptions to the rule but not many.

Couple other rules:

- Avoid perennial net-nets. Usually if they haven't found a way out in 2-3
years, they never will.
- Definitely avoid biotech net-nets unless you know how to invest in biotech,
which is completely other set of rules compared to regular investing. (Chinese
medical companies don't count here, since they are usually distributors +
nutrition companies, so they don't operate in USA biotech model).
- Avoid obsolete or near-obsolete technology net nets. If they could not figure
out how not to become obsolete, they won't figure it out now. (There are some
exceptions: KONG and HRAY did very well, but then they are Chinese companies
with opportunities appearing even if tech is rather obsolete).
- Avoid distributor, 1-2%-margin net nets. 1% net margin IS the reason why they
are net nets and they won't change.

Of course, with all these rules, you may guess how many net-nets I can find to
buy usually. Right. Zero. :)

Take care.

Yes, point taken Paul. I've had a problem or two also with buying cigar butts
for the cash and then having the stock continue down.

That being said, I think ACTS is a different play for a couple of reasons:

1) It isn't really a cigar butt. Before the recession, it seemed to have good
Earnings (Per yahoo - having trouble getting to SEC Filings - $75M in '06, $52M
in '07, and $26M in '08), and is still break-even now, and in my view would
hopefully pick up some sales and earnings growth to get notice and demand when
the economy turns.

2) The companies that I think you have to wait forever for are the ones that
have few shares, don't get noticed, and trade in a range for years. The stock
market crash took many companies down to below cash levels and most have
bounced back. I think this is one of the companies that just hasn't bounced.

3) The risk with some of these companies is that they will use their cash
reserves up in an acquisition and nullify the reason you bought the company in
the first place. That being said, I think asset values are still depressed and
worst-case, if they did that, they would hopefully be getting a good deal on
whatever they bought.

I guess, to me, the downside is small given the cash, but given the market cap
is $176M now, what valuation would the company get if it could grow back to
$50M in earnings as the economy gets on regular footing? ACTS, to me, seems
different than a normal below cash play.

FCH is now at 3.82 and I'm looking to sell my final bit of that stock to get
some ACTS at the open tomorrow (still keeping BEE and SPPR, as well as a REIT
fund in my 401k) to diversify more out of my hotel reit position while they're
up.

Hello Jurgis,

Looks like we posted around the same time. I did note that they do have share
dilution, but they also cut salaries a good deal recently. Maybe this is a way
to make employees whole due to salary cuts?

I'm interested in why you think they're losing significant money and with an
unclear future. My opinion is that they're doing pretty well to be basically
break-even given this last quarter may have been the bottom quarter in the
cycle. My hope is that even if they can just cyclically bounce based on demand
recovery, they'll be doing fine. Do you think there are bigger problems for
them?

Per the conference call transcript, they're also getting out of the equity
method for a money-losing subsidary they own, which will help their net income
going forward.

I agree with your rules on Net-Nets, and I tend to avoid most too these days.

CW,

ACTS revenues have gone down for two years now. I am not sure if I can explain
the revenue loss with just worldwide economic crisis. IMHO, they are
manufacturing commodity components and are involved in price war at least in
some of their product lines. Gross margins show that pretty clearly.

If there is demand recovery sufficient enough to lift all boats, you are right
that they will do fine. However, there is a significant risk that price war
will continue and ACTS will continue losing money. Even such huge companies as
Micron (http://www.gurufocus.com/financials.php?symbol=mu) have lost money in
commodity semicon space during most years. I am not expert in "mixed-signal
system-on-a-chip (SoC) and multimedia digital signal processing (DSP)" area, so
I don't really have a feeling on where ACTS products and R&D are going. If
someone knows semicons very well, they could comment on ACTS product line, its
competitors and potential for future.

IMHO, the ideal play is to wait for a positive results and buy then. Yes,
potentially the stock can run away and you won't be on the train. On the other
side though, if the negative results continue, you may not have to hold a dog.
:)

Here are couple success stories or half-success stories with net nets. GSIT - I
bought in $2.5 area in 2007, sold in 3.5-4 area in 2008. Profitable all the
time. GRVY - was possible to buy at $1.3 area even after they reported
profitable quarter. KONG and HRAY - those are shadier. I traded them for gains
couple times, but missed huge runup on Nokia's investment in KONG and Shanda's
purchase of substantial equity in HRAY. They showed losses some of the time.

Note that some Chinese stocks run up for no great reasons, which may be
beneficial if it strikes ACTS, but it may also explain a "better" results with
Chinese net nets vs. US counterparts.

Jurgis,

I appreciate your points. I do think there has been a price war in the space
over the last year or two, but I would expect a price war with such a quick
demand collapse. I think the price war will decline at least somewhat with a
demand pickup.

I agree with you that I don't pretend to understand their R&D. But that hasn't
stopped me from investing in stocks before! :)

Right now, they're pretty close to break-even, from my vantage. They're
predicting sequential growth next quarter.

And from my take on:

1) Sequential Revenue Growth
2) Actions Beijing, and the stop of the flow-through of those results into
ACTS.
3) Continued Interest Income on their Cash

My guess is that they're going to be profitable next quarter. But, that's just
a guess, we'll see.

That being said, I sold the rest of my FCH today, which to me was getting to a
fairly valued and more riskier price than ACTS, and put that money into ACTS.

We'll see how it works. Not a large position to start with. I would look to add
if we drift down while business performance improves.

Thank you,

Chinese market 3% down this evening. It seems to me like the volatility there
has drastically increases - i noticed that the Chinese market had a couple of
+/-2.5% days. Huge volatility in conjunction with an awful looking chart makes
me wonder about the health of the market there.

And this happens even though every adviser tries to tell us how the Chinese are
leading the world out of the recession, the stimulus there works and we need to
buy a piece of that.

Doesn't pass my smell test.

Diversified Industrials: Looks like both UTX and HON have moved up a little
from end of July.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=1y&s=HON&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=utx

Closed my ETN position today. Forward p/e of 18 is my reason. It makes the
stock look too pricey for me. P/b compared to previous years though is low;
p/sales is "normal" for some years, low compared to other years. 3.6% yield is
okay. Overall, I'd rather be out than in.

Fwiw, I'm trying to build a small position in "diversified manufacturer"
Flowserve (FLS) if I can get my price. Company's stock and performance seem to
be doing okay for now. Not sure I can call FLS a value stock though: p/e is
relatively low (compared to itself) at 11-12. P/b is relatively high at 3x.
Otoh, roe is up from past years, and d/e number seems to be coming down. Back
otoh, roe has been lots lower and missing when FLS had losses in '01 (FLS being
profitable in 9 of past 10 years).

I took FLS off my watch list since I replaced it with other companies that
seemed more attractive. My watch list is limited to 99 stock and indexes (I
could crate multiple watch lists but I don't) so when I add something new,
something old must go. FLS was replaced about three months ago after I had it
on my list for over 18 months. I like their products but guess I missed the
opportunity to buy some shares when it was selling below $50.00.

I was set up to start a position in ABT but missed that too. I might get a
chance to start a position on a 10% correction. Peeled off a few shares of UNH.
Buffet sold some shares too at current levels. My thought was to sell the

European utilities: Thanks for the suggestion of RWEOY. I'm going to pass on
that one for now because I already have a German one, (German based, but
international in operations), your suggestion of EONGY. I have picked up a few
shares of Italian/Spanish Enel at prices lower than currently. If the stock
drops back, I'm looking to add more.

In researching RWEOY, I've come across S&P Global Utilities Sector Index Fund
(JXI). JXI fees look to be .48%, and the etf doesn't appear to use leverage.
Top ten holdings listed here:

http://www.etfconnect.com/select/fundpages/etf_funds.asp?MFID=161844

I don't like that there's not much history, especially the dividends with JXI,
although the underlying utility holdings should be solid. I also don't like
that the etf's distributions seem to be paid semiannually, and they vary. I
expect varying distributions from companies that pay using the European model.
(by which I mean dividends are increased in good times, and if earnings are not
good (i.e. drop), stockholders can expect the dividend will be cut.) On balance
though, the 4.9% yield from a pack of utility stocks like this looks okay for
me for a "mom" account.

Northcoast Res analyst Charles Cerankosky said the markets were likely thinking

I think BJ is worth a bet, when adjusted for leverage, valuation is about the
same (I look at EBITDA/EV ratio for leverage adjused earnings), and prospects
are much better, imo.

I own some but have buy order out for more. BJ's disadvantage is the lower

with today's small sell prices offered are even lower.

My preference is to hold on and not sell but collect the dividend income. I
don't like to trade these but writing covered calls has worked out well for me
in the past.

I am more apt to close a position if the dividend is small or the xdividend
date has recently past. When I close out a position I tend to not buy back in
and end up leaving lots of money on the table.

I try to keep my positions at amounts where I can sell at least five or more
covered calls thereby hedging the position with a covered call. Otherwise, if
the value proposition is no longer attractive (both short & long term) it is
sold.

However, if it doubles again I should be able to get back my scratch money.

SVU is more interesting as in the last few days it has exceeded 50% of its
trading volume. The stock should continue to move higher.

"...Astute swing traders should pay particularly strong attention to volume on
breakouts, climactic bottoms, and spikes after sustained uptrends. Volume
divergence, when price is rising but volume is trending down, is a strong
warning that price itself will likely soon fall.

Joseph Granville, creator of the On Balance Volume indicator, shares this same
insistence on the importance of volume analysis. He exclaims that volume
precedes price, and he even goes so far as to argue that volume is cause and
price is effect....".

For the past year, Nokia's stock has been a loser. Shares are down 51%, and the

short, there is a lot to be negative about, but even negativity reaches
extremes.

I wouldn't get too carried away spending a great deal of time researching it
either. A few key points perhaps was enough and it was just an idea I thought
worth kicking out.

Management owns 4.1%. 6 institutions own about 50%.

Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc., et. al.(1) 4,639,365 9.7%
Hotchkis and Wiley Capital Management, LLC(2) 3,461,500 7.2%
The Vanguard Group, Inc.(3) 3,305,148 6.9%
Snyder Capital Management, L.P.(4) 3,229,429 6.7%
First Manhattan Co.(5) 3,110,925 6.5%
High Rise Capital Advisors, L.L.C., et. al.(6) 2,952,638 6.2%
RS Investment Management Co. LLC, et. al.(7) 2,952,524 6.2%

FFO was steady last 2 quarters at about 25 or 26 mil. The Co. pays a dividend
and declared 5 cents last Qtr.

At June 30, 2009, the Company's assets included $1.6 billion in owned real
property investments before depreciation and amortization, $251 million in loan
investments, and $158 million in commercial mortgage-backed securities. Most of
the Company's debt is long-term non-recourse fixed rate debt. Only 13% of the
Company's debt is recourse and must be refinanced in the reasonably near term.
The term credit facility with $159 million currently outstanding matures in
April 2010 but may be extended to 2011. The Company's convertible senior notes
have $54 million currently outstanding maturing in October 2012.

CapLease is affirming its previously disclosed full year 2009 guidance range of
$0.91 to $0.96 of FFO per share and $(0.16) to $(0.11) of earnings per share
(EPS). CapLease is also affirming its full year 2009 guidance range of $0.96 to
$1.01 of cash available for distribution (CAD) per share.

They earned 12 cents per common share last qtr, - net income.

We’ve all been hearing about the pending disaster in Commercial RE, yet the
stock price action and market perceptions don’t agree. Take for example Paul’s
TPGI, up 50% in last 7 weeks. They aren’t in the best shape either but at
grossly undervalued prices there are more than one of these dogs worth at least
a trade at current prices. All I care about really is the stock price and I
thought it may be worth a spec.

Yes, that's a good point re. UG. I'm not sure what the proper valuation edge
might be to measure UG vs. bigger companies, but p/e could be a start.

In this view, I wouldn't buy UG unless I also would consider PFE, LLY, FRX, SNY
- all of which have forward p/e multiples (per Yahoo) at under 8, which beats
UG on that metric. One way I look at it is that I already have positions in
these companies, so I am willing to branch out and try a microcap like UG.
Somebody else could view it as "why bother?" -- instead of risking funds on a
dink UG, just continue to add to a position in one or more of PFE, LLY, etc.
That could work out okay too (or not).

Just hard for me to pass up UG with it's excellent roe history -- in past few
years it beats some of these bigger companies. And I get a good dividend while
holding.

(Not sure what companies are exactly comparable to UG. I just picked the big
pharma here because some of these stocks are attractive too (to me) and because
UG also considers themselves at least partly a pharma co.)

The Chinese market is definitely volitaile, I'll give you that. But the U.S.
Market has been also the last couple of years. :)

Here are a couple of things I've been thinking about recently:

Before the collapse of the last couple of years, I think that many investors in
the market had never seen a serious short-term collapse. I think that this
affected their perception of risk and risk/reward ratios, which allowed them to
bid up stocks to certain prices we're not seeing now. I guess my question is -
given that investors have now seen this collapse, is the general investor
perception of risk higher, aware of the possibility of this kind of collapse
happening again? Will investors bid stocks back up to as high of price/earnings
ratios as we've had the last 10 years or so when earnings are back to normal
and good (assuming that happens)? If so, does this impact how many stocks are
truly values in this new world?

Also, in regards to the U.S. market, I'm personally thinking we're going to
come out of this recession but are looking at a few years of low growth if not
stagnation. If so, should we be looking for companies in China with good value
characteristics over companies in the U.S.? For example, isn't a company with a
p/e in China of 8, all things being equal, slightly more attractive than the
same company in the U.S. given that the Chinese economy is humming along at 8%
year while the U.S. is nowhere close to that?

Just things I'm thinking about...

Thanks,

Wow BGS and BGF en fuego, shoulda woulda coulda for me. Congrats to those who
purchased and hung in there.

Just couldn't get a grasp on these, and was tending to be more risk averse at
the time. The small size of the company and the heavy debt load was problematic
for me.

Sold out CFN (spinoff from CAH) in my IRA account and plan to do so in my
taxable account as well, as soon as the shares are credited. i think the
business has decent prospects but with 1.1-1.2$ earnings/share at 19$/share
i'll pass. I think there are better or at least cheaper stocks in the medical
sector right now. Even COV after a 30% rise is still cheaper than CFN and has
at least equally good prospects.

I added some MDTH and have a bid out for more SUNH as well.

CFN (sold 19.45$) ,D (bought 32.6$), PETD (bought 13.31$)

Sold: CFN @19.45$

Bought: D (cheap and diversified utility reinvesting some CNP proceeds, adding
to my existing position. D has lagged the market rebound of utility stocks for
no obvious reasons, imo)
PETD: NG play with a cheap valuation (around 0.8$/mcfe Enterprise Value for
proved reserves). This is the cheapest valuation (in terms of proved reserve
value) I could find. Not the best management as their recent secondary attests,
but not he worst track record either.

Upping my position in FACT a little. Looks like company might deploy most of
its cash in a venture with another company in the production of a cancer drug.
Subtracting the upfront payments FACT will make and adding in FACT's ltd, the
cash per share that FACT has is still above the current stock price (which has
fallen with the announcement of the jv).

Maybe FACT mgmt knows what they are doing--- they should if they are willing to
commit over $100M. Very risky and speculative bet for me though. So just a few
shares.

I sold my BEE today at a very small profit. I'm beginning to question what kind
of economy we're going to come into in 2010/2011. Yes, we're coming out of the
recession but will we achieve growth that will allow companies like BEE to pay
off their debt coming due in 2011 (or at least refinance)? I'm thinking we may
end up in a flat growth economy for a couple of years. And I just think there
are other better values around in other sectors.

So, basically, all I have left of these stocks is SPPR, which I like better for
the long-term. It seems better able to handle a low growth economy over the
next couple of years.

SEPR has been one of my better performers this year- up more than 100% from my

Closed teen clothing retailer ARO. Added to stub FDO on it's earnings miss.
Added to bdc FSC.

Small buy of Chinese FSIN. This company is a "global manufacturer and innovator
of copper-clad bimetallic wire used in a variety of telecommunication, utility,
transportation and other electrical applications." Not a great quarter; I'm
betting further quarters will benefit from "the Chinese government's stimulus
package and 3G network infrastructure buildout." Cash about equal to debt. (A
margin of safety). Company not the bargain it once was, given its current p/e,
b/bk and roe. Therefore for me, in only for a few share bet.

Walmart represents approx. 70%

This was in 10K about lawsuit:

In August 2000, the Company filed suit against a former manufacturer alleging
breach of a manufacturing contract and seeking damages and rescission of
165,000 shares of its common stock as part of the amounts which had been
previously paid to the manufacturer. During 2003, a jury awarded the Company
damages in the amount of $1,650,560, which included the value of the returned
shares of common stock. The treasury stock was received during 2003 at a
court-mandated value of $0.78 per share. Of the total shares, 35,000 were paid
to legal counsel as consideration for legal fees. The remaining 130,000 shares
are reflected as treasury stock in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
at the $0.78 per share, or $101,400. The Company is attempting to collect the
remainder of the award, $1,521,860, by suit filed in October 2003 against the
owners of the former manufacturer. As collection of this award is uncertain,
this gain contingency has not been recorded in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income.

Seadrill May Seek Merger With Pride as Focus Switches (Update4)
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601072&sid=acqMG1L1r_Do

From the article:"... Sept. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Seadrill Ltd., the Norwegian oil
driller controlled by billionaire John Fredriksen, may seek to merge with Pride
International Inc., part of a trend toward consolidation in the
oilfield-services industry.

“There could be good, attractive opportunities going forward, also from the
point of view of single-asset acquisitions,” Seadrill Chief Executive Officer
Alf Thorkildsen said in an interview at an Oslo oil conference. Asked if Pride
may be a possible merger partner, he said “yes, it could be.”

Seadrill already controls directly and indirectly a 9.5 percent stake in
Houston-based Pride, an offshore driller for oil and natural gas that has rigs
from India to Africa.

The Norwegian company said last week it wants to streamline its business and
put more resources into deepwater operations, where demand has held up more
than for shallow-water fields as oil prices declined from last year’s peak.
Pride also is focusing increasingly on deepwater and other technologically
challenging drilling projects...."

Yes, I saw that, elmatador. I hold pork packers SFD and SEB. Meatpacking seems
to be a tough, competitive business where sometimes commodity prices rule and
whatever management does, doesn't stop earnings losses.

So I am somewhat confused. JBS comes in and buys struggling USA producers and
turns them around. How can they do that? These USA guys or the USA environment
so bad that only skillful outside management can turn things around? What did
this Brazilian meatpacking company do, that the USA guys didn't and should
have? (Just wondering)

Also, I've been a stockholder of a couple of Mexican food companies (tortilla
and an egg producer) as well as Brazilian SADA, mentioned in your link.
I believed that these were "just" food companies, and they made their money
from farming/processing/selling foodstuffs to consumers. Ha. Very wrong there.
They apparently tried to make their profits from financial manipulations. If
you were a stockholder last year, you know exactly how quickly and sharply the
stocks of these companies crashed when the bad news came out. As this lawsuit
says,

"Sadia entered into undisclosed currency derivative contracts to purportedly
hedge against the Company's U.S. dollar exposure. The Company characterized the
amounts of these contracts as "nominal." However, these contracts violated
Company policy in that they were far larger than necessary to hedge normal
business operations and resulted in a loss of $365 million." (Again, Sadia was
not the only company to do this, and not the only company to have its stock
crushed when they had to report very large currency losses.)

My point is that I don't trust that these Brazilian companies are any more
competent or successful in coming into a culture that's unfamiliar to them and
managing troubled businesses than the nationals (USA people) who are already in
there, struggling.

Otoh, though, analysts and some media people believe the Brazilian beverage
company that bought Budweiser will do very well with the acquisition-- Bud
having grown fat and lazy with its dominant position.

In any case, I've been burned so I'm sticking to USA food producers for
commodity foods like beef/pork/chicken. For brand food - like Nestle, Cadbury,
Pepsi, Fomento Econ&#243;mico Mexicano, that's a different story, and I take a
more international outlook.
