MO - Litigation risk: I did some research attempting to come up with base data
and methods to estimate litigation risk...not specifically cigarette companies
[I've long believed they'd get burned in the end], but stuff like shareholder
suits that are very common when you buy after a big fall. One distinction that
came out was between a known and open ended risk. Known being....we know how
many suits there are going to be [like the diet drug case], open ended being
more like asbestos or smoking where the suits can just keep on coming as new
disease cases are discovered.
One thing I didn't find and would appreciate a point to is base data on
shareholder suit success and average settlement. I believe a recent ruling
raised the bar that had been substantially lowered around 95.

I used to trade very profitably in Philip Morris in '94-'96. My formula was
pretty simple and it worked almost perfectly - buy when the lead story on ABC
News was some awful revelation about the industry or its legal liability, and
sell when the coast looked clear. Or buy when the yield was 5% and sell when
investors got complacent again. In post-split prices, the trade was generally
buy at 28-31, sell at 33-35. Then repeat. I made a good deal of money on this
stock in a few big trades.

My final trade (and the big homerun) in Philip Morris was in early '97 when
there were the first rumors of a congressional settlement. It was 20% of my
portfolio and the stock shot up to 45, and I sold within a point of the peak
because I sensed my game was up. Once the government got involved we were
dealing with forces that made my historical system potentially irrelevant.
Optimism was at its peak because all anybody was thinking about was settlement
- what I was thinking was that now all the rules have changed, which scared the
hell out of me.

I have been tempted to buy the stock many times since then, but never pulled
the trigger. And I'm glad, because it wouldn't have made me money. There are
plenty of stocks out there, and though I believe Philip Morris is one of the
best managed companies in the world, I continue to simply pass on this one.

I remember attending a lecture by Michael Price in 1996 when I owned Philip
Morris and I asked him for his opinion on tobacco stocks. He said he did not
own them, which really surprised me. He told the audience that he practices Ben
Graham investing, and tobacco risk is an unquantifiable off balance sheet risk,
so one can have no confidence in "intrinsic value" no matter how you calculate
it. i.e. you have no downside protection.

Philip Morris now yields over 6 1/2%. I used to buy it automatically when it
would yield 5%, and that was always the bottom. The very fact that it now
yields 6 1/2% tells me in some way to stay away. I have no particular moral
problem with the company - I am a smoker (that's my contrarian side - I used to
joke that its a hedge. If there is some gargantuan verdict, I may lose my
investment, but at least I'll get part of the loot!) - in fact my next door
neighbor works for the tobacco division as a retail marketer. I just consider
it too risky an investment, and there are still too many big investors ignoring
the risks in my view. At the same time I revile what the government and trial
lawyers are doing to this company and have the Forbes cover titled "Smoke
This!" hanging on the wall of my office. I was inches from buying last week at
31, but held back for some reason. I hope those in the stock make a lot of
money.

Just my opinion.

I remember some perfectly good companies going bankrupt over asbestos,
like Eagle Picher, which I owned for a while in pre-asbestos days, and sold as
soon as I concluded that the low valuation was for a reason
that would become significant -- huge, growing, unquantifiable, and unfunded
asbestos liabilities.

What do you make of the huge EBSC trade? I take it as a private holder probably
selling to the company, and don't particularly like the view expressed by the
seller as to the recovery potential. However, if the company bought it, that is
a nice reduction in the O/S shares in one fell swoop.

VUL is a very tempting situation. Also, the Yahoo board has some excellent

PNC Bank and Ameritech seem excellent companies to own, but it seems that it
would be impossible to find a good buying opportunity at a conservative value
investing (buffetology) criteria to ever purchase these stocks individually in
the open market.

I quickly looked at the standard ratios and the p/e's and p/b's are higher than
I typically like. On a quick glance, I doubt I would be purchasing any of these
companies in the open market because they always seem too pricey.

Does anyone have an opinion on whether the VUL discount is sufficient enough to

I own a number of small tech stocks that I bought as value plays, not
necessarily balance sheet value. CCUR, XICO, ELTX, SEMI are examples. The first
2 have moved out of that category.

Trying to identify value tech stocks has cost me more money than anything else
in my investing career. For example, I bought XICO in 1994 over VTSS for its
larger size and vastly better balance sheet at the time. VTSS is up 50-100
times; XICO has round-tripped and is recovering again, now about triple my

Once again you have hit the nail on the head. This year I chose between two
technology stocks- one had sharply accelerating sales but no book value. The
other was selling for 1/2 of its bookvalue and seemed to have prospects for a
turn around. I chose the latter because it appeared less risky. The former has
quadrupled in value and the latter has lost a third of its value as it
continues to "turn around".
The clincher is that I knew that the management of the latter company was
questionable at best whereas I had no opinion on the former company. I shall

On the contrary, smoking is not guaranteed to take years
off one's life. Only a small percentage of smokers get
cancer or emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Just like only
a small percentage of alcoholics have to ever deal with
liver tumors or cirrhosis. To figure out one's own risk,
take a look at the family tree. There's probably some
smokers. In my case, on my dad's side, both his parents
smoked and died of lung cancer in their early 60s. My dad
died of lung cancer at 51 probably because of second hand
smoke. So no way no how am I going to smoke. And as for
young children, genetics still play a bigger role than the
actual presence of smoke in determining most maladies.

The take-home message from MO is that when a company facing
potential large liability sees its chief legal officer sell
nearly all his shares at what had previously been a solid
support level (34ish), it does not bode well. I didn't buy
because of this fact, but I should have been shorting it.

I just go for what has value. To me, ignoring tech doesn't make sense. I've
done well with Apple, Oracle, American Power this year. IMO, applying
traditional value criteria to tech is deadly, because there is usually a reason
it looks like a value, and it is too technical to understand.
So in tech I look for:

1) Big, Buffett-like established companies with tremendous
cash-generating ability that are out of favor despite a franchise on something
2) Small techs trading at about cash with no debt. They usually do well in my
experience.

In tech, good management is rare and when it is present limits become merely a
figment. But for an outsider to somehow judge this before the Street does - I

I did talk to HRC about the purchases, and they are all company-financed. You
can read about it in the April proxy. It's near the front. There's a maximum of
$50 million available for this executive loan program. The stock is collateral,
and there is a margin feature to it.

When I kind of made the point (by remaining silent)to the CFO's rep that this
didn't make me happy he said "but they are all full-recourse loans," somewhat
defensively. Of course this means that if the stock goes to nothing, then the
company can lay claim to the personal assets of the insiders. One kind of
assumes it would be this kind of loan, but I guess it's good to know anyway.

Much has been made about company loans to insiders for stock purchases, but I
am not sure they are altogether a bad thing. I see that the idea is to
encourage a lot of investment without requiring a large cash lay up front, and
I can understand that. I still like to see them lay out the cash, though.

I continue to like HRC. There is a lot that's cheap in the health care sector,
and HRC is definitely still one of them. It is also a screaming tax-loss sell
for most institutions, so I expect more pressure before the year is out.
Another one I like is Senior Housing, the HRPT spin-off that has been
neglected. I reviewed that over on the site too.

Re: HRC vs. EBSC, can you believe I haven't even looked at EBSC yet? Has it met

HRC to me is being exceptionally well run considering the acquisition
integration and industry challenges that it is facing. Physician practices are
going bankrupt because insurers are not honoring their contracts and paying
bills on time. So the huge accounts receivable is not HRC-specific. But most
analysts look at the AR and DSO and just think warning signs. Despite this,
cash flow remains large. It is as contrarian as anything. With billions in debt
and the industry they are in, I think most institutions are just glancing right
by. Not noticing the half-billion in free cash flow, or the 5X coverage ratio.
Add in tremendous tax-loss selling, and I thin that there is a very good chance
of a 50% two-year gain on the conservative side from these levels. If it goes
to the 4's I'm buying more.

performance turned out to be the poorer. And if management is a key determinant
for success, and going with Mike's observation that management is difficult to
judge by an outsider--- then I will offer you my postulate:

1. At any point in time, if trying to make a choice among two or more companies
to invest in, the investor will invariably pick the wrong company.

The implication from this (for me, anyway) is not that one should continue to
struggle to pick one from among the competing alternatives. I say -- especially

I am still finding new possibilities that I like, and I am starting small buys
in them. For example:

Trinity Industries (TRN) In several businesses. Primarily known as a rail car
manufacturer. But they are increasing their presence in the highway
construction market (and converting a railcar manufacturing facility to this
potentially better business). A possible beneficiary of the Highway
Construction Bill.
They describe themselves as "one of the nation's leading diversified industrial
growth companies. Trinity operates through six principal business segments: a
Railcar Group, an Inland Barge Group, a Parts and Services Group, a Highway
Construction Products Group, a Concrete and Aggregate Group, and an Industrial
Group." (-g-So why they call themselves Trinity, I do not know.)
Of course TRN's financial ratios look very good to me. Low price/bk, low pe,
stock hitting new lows. They just reported record net income for their second
quarter. Although I would expect the business and earnings to be more cyclical.
And maybe they will be. Could be that it's already "maybe" "somewhat" built
into the low price of the stock though. The price to value here looks good to
me.

Ogden (OG). A messy and messed-up conglomerate. Changing their focus midstream
is costing them a bunch of money. The head man wanted to increase entertainment
division business. But in a disagreement with the Board of Directors, he left
and the BOD are looking to split up the company. Lots of debt. Dividend, of
course, just recently eliminated. Stock has dropped a bunch and now looks like
it's at about a 12 year low. A really interesting thing is that Greenway
Partners has just taken an approximately 10% stake in the company (purchased in
open market - I think). And Greenway is expert at helping turn around problem
companies (or so I have read).

ZD. Undervalued based on its relationship to its internet stock ZDZ. This was
described in Barron's On-Line interview last week, with a Mr. Higgens in an
article on value investing. He is a relative value fund manager who believes in
fallen stocks regressing to their mean. That's an idea that works (sometimes.)

Nacco Industries Class A. Well, when I started buying yesterday (Wed.) before
earnings came out, it was selling at book value. Down 12 today to about 52 on
low earnings and poor prospects for next quarter. This is a company that is in
three businesses: Fork lift trucks (manufacture and distribute - they are a big
player in this area), surface mining of coal, houseware appliances. It is a
company very subject to interest rates, economic conditions, foreign exchange
rates. There are only about 8 million shares outstanding. Year over year growth
in sales is slow , but generally up. Book value has doubled in past five years,
and LTD has been halved but then increased as of last year with the buying of
the forklift business from another manufacturer; dividends have increased every
year since '93 (as far back as I can go). ROE looks to be about 13-17%
(excluding high and low years). Nice little conglomerate business. One way to
value it might be by a multiple of its EBITD which I see was about $28.50/sh.
Right now though, I would not recommend purchase (although I myself have been
adding today as the stock has dropped). Earnings announcement, low float, high
absolute stock price, lack of street interest – this stock could drop a lot
further before it bases. And it may take a year or more to recover. But I bet
it will.

Sam Citron: I've been mulling your post about tech investing vs. value
investing. There are many aspects to what you say, and I believe a very
complicated discussion is required to adequately address those aspects.

Briefly, yes, a combination of value investing and tech investing can be
"prudent". I've seen one media analyst refer to one academic study that
concluded this. Some investing styles are more successful than others at
different times, and since the style apparently cannot be predicted in advance,
then an investor whose portfolio encompasses more than one style may, in my
estimation, "do well" over a long time span.

Here you've read about people buying tech stocks using value criteria. That's a
method that works. But has drawbacks. First, imo, it requires patience to wait
for, and find, The "bargain". More significantly, it often means applying value
criteria to the sell decision as well. And that suggests the investor may sell
too soon and miss very large runnups as the stock leaps past "fair value".

Another aspect of tech/growth investing would be to purchase stocks by not
using value criteria at all. For value investors that would involve managing a
(small.) portion of one's portfolio in a totally different style - separate
from value investing. So, for example, purchasing internet stocks based on
price to expected revenues or based on media hyperbole or perhaps biotechs on
price to R&D or perhaps an index S&P 500-- these areas might lead to
significant profits. In this way, in today's internet-popular market or high
cap market, the investor who combines (in the portfolio) investing styles has a
chance to participate in possibly significant trends.

Why value investors might be loath to do this, is possibly related to a
proclivity to focus on looking at investments from a risk/reward standpoint.
And the risks sometimes look very great.

I don't entirely agree. A small cap company can attract new management and it
often goes totally unnoticed by Wall Street. Sometimes you have the contacts to
reliably check on the reputation of that mgmt. You might find that relative to
the size of the company that they have just picked up an Iacocca or Gerstner.
This then becomes a major investment factor.

You misquoted me, Paul. In post 8710 I said the TWO most important things in
technology investing are management and growth. I agree that quality of
management is sometimes hard to determine. However, I would say that it is a
lot easier to determine in technology than elsewhere -- in technology poor mgmt
rapidly becomes apparent in market position inferior to similar peers.

In the specific example I gave in that post and that Armin gave in his
response, the investment failure was focusing on balance sheet strength and
safety, rather than growth/market position.

Your point is well taken about buying both stocks. However, I do not believe
that I have the skill to follow a large portfolio and I like to have a degree
of concentration where a success (or failure) makes a difference. I have always
felt that no more than 10-15 stocks met my skills and provided some degree of
diversification. I generally subscribe to Buffett's view of not diversifying,
and trying to know the companies as well as anyone. I usually talk to the CEO,
and try to establish a relationship over time and am happy holding stocks for

>50% would be in classic value plays
>and 50% in classic growth

I am uncomfortable with this approach for two reasons.
First, I am usually uncomfortable with classical value
plays: i.e. shoddy companies under X value. Exception:
high-yield REITs where you get that 10% dividend
while waiting.
Second, I am uncomfortable with nosebleed valuations
of the classic growth (e.g. current SUNW, LU, CSCO).
It's totally unclear where we go from these levels.
It may be up, but I lack any conviction.

So I am going with "growth/quality at a decent price".
What is that? Nobody knows. I recently bought MAT, SGP,
and a tech company which are on different ends
of "growth/quality at a decent price" spectrum. My
restriction always was and is available cash. Sometimes
that's a good restriction (not buying MAT @ 20),
sometimes bad (not buying ADBE @ 20). But main rule that
I noticed is: If there's nothing to buy, don't buy
anything. Don't lower quality, don't pay higher prices,
and don't try to justify them. High quality companies at
reasonable prices will appear soon.

One thing that I have not figure out yet is
the sell decision. I haven't
made a "hold forever" decision on anything except BRK.
My longest term holding is PEP, which has done nothing
for 2 years that I am holding it. It is much more difficult
to continue holding after a substantial runup, because
of the high valuation and "round-trip" fear. Perhaps
a stepwise reduction of position is an answer.
I don't subscribe to the school of selling at a loss,
unless there's a good position switch or the original
idea does not hold anymore.

Jurgis, I have taken so many round trips that I am dizzy. I would say that
scaling out is even more important than scaling in. If you have done your
homework and know what you are buying there isn't much reason not to start with
a full position. Admittedly homework takes time and you might want to scale in
as you do more homework, talk with mgmt, and grow more comfortable.

On the sell side the stock no longer meets your buy criteria so there is no
reason to hold any except you think it may not have reached your sell target,

Random thoughts on net-nets below:

Paul posted: <<Steven: Ha! The stock-for-mom factor. Possibly only Dana of my
recent posts here would be suitable for a Mom portfolio.>>
Interesting post in that Dana is one of the two stocks I literally did buy for
Mom in the last week. Berkshire Hathaway is the other.

On the net-net front,
I'll give Mike another push to look at EBSC (I'm looking at SNH with great
interest) - I think EBSC is going to be a huge January stock.
I will disclose that I sold the majority of my position in LKI at 8-9, in the
interest of full openness on this thread. I didn't like the last quarter. (To
keep it simple, what should have happened didn't - that is the best sell signal
I know).
The net-net I mentioned without disclosing the name a couple weeks ago fell to
my price today and I started accumulating a position. The company is so small
(the smallest I've ever bought) that I will not disclose the name until I do
accumulate a position.
My current net-net holdings are now EBSC, MAXS, LKI and the mystery stock. I am
looking at several others.
I consider USU something like a net-net, because the valuation is just so
extreme. We're talking about 5 times free cash flow. The company rushed through
its share repo program and has shrunk the company by 10% in just one quarter
with just a little bit of incremental borrowing. The reason you might want to
watch this one and get to know the valuation is that the company has been by
far the largest buyer. Now they are stepping aside until the Board extends the
repurchase authorization, which they are unlikely to do until January.
Meanwhile tax loss selling season. This could go significantly lower, and if it
does (I'm thinking 7) I will be a buyer for the first time since the IPO.

I added to Crane (CR) yesterday at 19 or so. I think I have mentioned this one
before when it was at about 25. I think its worth at least $33. At least. I was
watching it go down - I nibbled at 24 and then took a full position at 19. Its
a cyclical just starting to do its cyclical thing on the downside. If it goes
lower I'll add more. This is one hell of a company for 9 times earnings - get a
copy of their annual report. I bought Dover (DOV) almost exactly a year ago
when it looked just like Crane today (they are like sister companies) and I am
up over 50% in that position and it has just started to break out if you
believe in technical analysis. Dover is a sell into Crane if those were the
only two stocks that exist. Since they aren't, Dover is a long term hold.
Anybody who sold Dover in the last 30 years regretted that decision.

It seems to me that USU was primarily bought by institutions at the IPO and
don;t they all have to dump by 10/31/ to get a tax advantage in 1999? That

some of these companies will repurchase during November? I think that most

Jim, re CR. I'm looking at it also. Basically just culling through the new lows
list. Somewhat strange to see so many heartland industrial companies at
multiyear lows now. Perhaps the market is signaling an economic slowdown. Or
investor monies are just being sucked from these companies to be reinvested in
more glamorous areas such as, perhaps, internet companies.

As you probably know from your research (and I know just because I'm old
enought to remember -g-)is that Robert Evans, current CR CEO, is the son of a
fairly well-known "value" investor and industrialist who was also the prior CR
CEO. That suggests to me there's some indication that CR management might run

I am usually uncomfortable with classical value plays i.e. shoddy companies
under X value.

I believe that the definition of value must include metrics for identification
of bargains, but must also include qualitative parameters to screen out such
dogs. Factors like quality of management can be difficult to ascertain or
measure, but one must make an attempt to do so all the same. I admit it is
often a hall of mirrors like the beauty contest alluded to by Keynes when he
used it as a metaphor for the institutional investment process in which the
judges do not have the luxury of choosing who they think is the most beautiful
girl, but must choose the girl they think will appeal to the other judges.
Sometimes I think the analysts belong in an institution. ;-)

I frankly admit that my own investment style is ecclectic enough to include TA
as a timing tool, not because there is anything magical about support and
resistance zones, but simply because most investors are all too human, with
egos and emotions more prevalent than intellects in their decision making
styles, and the past is frequently one of the better guides to an uncertain
future. Certainly the history of financial manias and phobias give ample
evidence that we are all creatures of mass psychology. I suspect that even the
most ardent contrarian takes some comfort in the company of a like minded
individual, if only to assure him that he is not certifiably insane.

October is certainly a good month for bottom fishing, although I don't pretend
to understand why.

MAT has been on my radar screen for some time. Difficult to value the Barbie
franchise. The numbers look good but investors look at the Learning Company
fiasco and have to question whether management "gets it". This is the most
important issue to me: does management have the smarts to navigate through a
dynamic environment in which Hasbro, E-toys and Nintendo-like clones are
changing the toy business forever.
I'm not saying MAT is a Woolworth, but I want evidence that they have an
intelligent strategy before I buy the stock, though it may seem cheap indeed.

If you have something to say along these lines regarding MAT, I am all ears.

That's gobblidygook for there's more to it than "oh, write it off because half
of its tenants are in trouble." And it begins by asking what happens to the
property owner when the leasee goes bankrupt, and maybe even before that why
are the leasees going bankrupt.

You don't seriously believe that either Mike or myself would invest in a stock
yielding 19% without reading the prospectus, do you? But I do appreciate you
pointing out to others on this thread that SNH is by no means a "no-brainer".
What you point out is absolutely correct - some of them already have gone
bankrupt. In a way, it may also be the reason to buy the stock - I read the
prospectus to find out what could scare investors so much that a stock could be
(or maybe just look) this cheap. When I looked carefully at the tenant list, I
found what I was looking for - I almost stopped there. I MUST EMPHASIZE - I
STILL HAVE NOT BOUGHT THE STOCK, though Mike has and I pushed him just as you
are pushing me - he has done his homework.

So why would one treat a dividend backed by a number of bankrupt credits as
possibly sustainable? As Mike has pointed out in his writeup on
valuestocks.net, about half the dividend is backed by long-term leases to
Marriott, a rock-solid credit. The other half, as you pointed out, is backed by
a bunch of publicly traded health care companies trading as penny shares (they
were $30 stocks two years ago). So the point Mike has made that you could just
write off those tenants and still collect a 9% yield is worth thinking about.

But let's go one step further. Let's assume those tenants all go bankrupt. If
I'm an equity holder or a lender (i.e. bonds), I'm lucky to collect pennies on
the dollar. But SNH is in a different position as a creditor. They own the
buildings. Comparing SNH as a creditor to a lender is like comparing night and
day.

If I am SNH I am not an equity holder or a lender. I am the most senior
creditor. The tenants (and we are talking about the likes of IHS and GHV - look
at their charts and you will see why SNH is cheap) are going bankrupt because
they can't pay the interest on billions of dollars worth of debt, not because
they can't pay their rent. (How do I know this? Because they all have positive
operating income. You want to take a good look at their financials as well.)

The risk is that in a bankruptcy, all contracts, including leases, are
negotiable. The Vencor-Ventas relationship is similar to what we are looking at
with SNH, and in that case the rents were negotiated down 20%. So let's make
that the benchmark. Assume half the tenant base goes bankrupt and SNH has to
reduce rents by 20%. That might cut the dividend to $2 or so. If that's my risk
on a $13 stock, I will sleep well owning it.

The way I view risk is why I have not bought this stock yet. Clearly if the
dividend is cut even to $2 the stock sells off, but that does not represent
permanent loss of capital if I am right in my real estate analysis. I think my
real risk here is that I don't know this business or what is going on in health
care economics re: Medicare. I think I can understand the real estate risk, so
my risk in investing in the stock is that I am missing something huge
elsewhere. Any guess what that might be?

re: SNH + more on net-nets

I wrote my response on SNH before Mike wrote his. It looks like he is saying
the same thing I did. All credit for this idea goes to Mike, not me. He did the
work, I am just replicating what he has already said, though my post was based
on my own read of the prospectus and other things.

Contrary to what I said a few minutes ago in my analysis, I don't think I need
any more information. The more I think about it, I just conclude that SNH is a
buy below 15 (and it trades at $12 3/4).

Do we have a third?

On another topic, I promised one micromicrocap (that means less than $10
million market cap) net-net yesterday, as soon as I get a position. I found
another more sizable ($100-500MM range) net-net last night that also looks like
a virtually automatic buy (consistently profitable, stable business, signficant
dividend yield, 2/3 of net-current assets) if a few things check out. Hold me
to both of these within the next two weeks. For the last four years I have very
rarely been able to find more than one of these (i.e. net-nets that I would
still buy after reading the financials - I have very strict criteria, not all
quantitative) at a time, and now I've got four or five for the first time.
Tells you something about what the "broader market" is doing, or maybe it tells
you I'm just looking for them more methodically as I have become convinced that
this strategy is by far the most profitable arrow in my quiver - and one which
may not be correlated to the S&P 500 index. I have never lost money on a
net-net, I think because I only invest in those that meet much stricter
criteria. Every one has gone up 30%+ within six months. The problem is that I
have only been able to find one of these every six months. That appears to be
changing. Maybe in a few months I will have a stable of ten of these, and then
there would be the possibility of achieving some diversification and really
building what Ben Graham would have called a portfolio. A work in progress if
Mr. Market cooperates.

With SNH, the VTR scenario seems a likely roadmap. However, I'm not totally
convinced that a bankruptcy of one to three of the SNH lessees doesn't offer
Marriott the opportunity to renegotiate down their leases. This would spiral
down the value of the underlying properties. My understanding is that Marriott
actually only accounts for 1/3. BLCI is another 11%, superficially appears OK,
but I haven't dug into it.

Something that concerned me about SNH is the fact that even though Hegarty and
Saini come over from HRPT they don't own a lot of stock. However there is an
Incentive Share Award Plan with 1.3 million shares reserved. The prospectus
notes: "No awards will be granted under the incentive share award plan before
completion of the spin-off, and no individuals have yet been selected to
receive any awards."

For me the compensation package could be a deciding factor. Does anyone have
more insight?

Does your model, take into account fixed costs? A 50% reduction of revenues
would lead to a > 50% reduction in dividends.

Most notably among these costs is a substantial amount of bank debt to service.
And the interest rate on that debt can rise, too, as the credit worthiness of
the borrower diminishes, not to mention the usual exposure to the Fed.

Two other things to consider about SNH, in comparison to other REITs:
(1) SNH has a higher payout ratio, meaning a larger fraction of its cash flow
is used for dividend payments, giving it less room to manuever when something
goes wrong.
(2) the interests of SNH management are not aligned those of yourself as a
shareholder. In contrast, most REITs are self-administered and management holds
a large fraction of the shares. Management of SNH is paid a fee according to
assets under management, so it has an incentive to leverage up, no matter what
it does to you and the risk you take.

With REITs in general in a deep funk, there's no reason IMO to shop for junk
when you can buy blue-chips at a bargain price.

I received SNH shares as a spinoff from HRP, and I sold them for the reasons I
have explained.

As you say, you can certainly make your own decision, based on whatever
reasoning you like. You might not like my argument, but I believe lurkers might

I bought it strictly for the franchise with eyes

KKR will buy MAT for $10, and I lose. :-)

Chester, I noticed that in the article you cited Garzarelli also likes the
brokerages, including MER, because of their valuation. This brings up an
interesting comparison.

Elsewhere I've read that MER is trading in the middle of its historical range
of multiples. Near the bottom of that range might make it more interesting as a
value play, IMHO.

The charts suggest to me that in comparison to the brokerages, homebuilders are
much more beaten down. I wonder which of these two sectors should normally be
more sensitive to anxieties about where short-term rates and the business cycle
are headed. This time, at least, it has been the builders that have been the
most bloodied.

I did find MER useful last week when VIX hit a peak. When VIX went well into
the 30's and then intraday on Monday it began to fall, I bought both OEX calls
and MER equity. This was a short term play -- a bet on a bounce from a bottom.
As it turned out, this worked nicely, and I was able to exit my positions with
the gain I wanted by the end of the week. The previous time I attempted this I
used only OEX calls, but this time I wanted to rely a little more on equity so
that in case my bet failed, I would find myself owning something that would
still have value after December options expiry.

I chose MER as the equity in this play because I wanted a big stock that would
likely bounce back with the rest of the market, but even more so.

Mike, re. VIX, I have found it useful, as you mention, in short-term timing,
but only as a bottom indicator for corrections. I would think that this
limitation would normally restrict it to an infrequent use, but in the volatile
Autumn of 1999, it has been useful several times already.

Teleflex (TFX): Here is a stock for the average investor to think about, not to
study in detail. It's a busy conglomerate, so it's impossible, imo, for the
average person to figure out where the sum of the individual businesses is
going to take the company. And for somebody who likes a concentrated portfolio,
it would be like spending the time and effort to do in depth research on about
4 companies.

My overview shows some of the value criteria don't look tremendously appealing.
PSR is low, but not the lowest it's been. Return on equity is creeping up over
the past few years, but at 15-16% now, that's not that great, especially as the
price to book value is over 2. D/E ratio is improving a bit though.

The company recently missed analyst earnings estimates, and the stock price has
come down to a 12 month low.

I evaluate this company by looking in the rear view mirror -g-.
If I were to characterize the past 10-12 year stock price of this company, I'd
say it's been very slow, steady upward progress- unexciting progress- until
about 1998 when the stock price seems to have begun a more cyclical movement.

I'm starting a very small position in this company. And for only two reasons:
1. The p/e at 14 is at a multiyear low.
2. The company has 25 consecutive years of increased revenues and earnings.

I'm betting the rev. and earnings growth will continue, and the pe multiple
will expand (regress to the mean).

Sorry, I am really not interested in retailers.
Never saw any franchise value in them - even WalMart and

there are too many ways to screw up and too few to do it

disadvantages (no merchandise *feel*, shipping costs
for them and the customer, cutthroat pricing).
I feel that AMZN is carving a nice niche by providing
pretty pleasant shopping experience and referring to
other shops and auctions. Their search and reviews are
great. They have some pretty rare books and CDs.
But I still shop for lower
prices than AMZN, even though it's the first site I visit.
And I get 5% off by paying using e-card. So I don't
even put a valuation on it. No idea about any other
e-tailers.

It makes sense to buy retailers at net-net or some other
extremely low valuation for trading, but once again it's
not my turf. Ask James and Mike Burry.

I was almost persuaded by James and co to buy CMH or CHB

one of those times to apply the rule: "If there's
nothing to buy, don't buy anything" :-)
However, the stocks look cheap, so there may be a good
potential. At this time, however, I see more exciting
things to buy. You can even buy BRK or WSC. ;-)

I did not follow other homebuilders recently.
I prefer >10% yielding REITs, especially in IRA.
USU looks interesting too. It's the "bird in a hand"

I have beeen buying a few shares of a company called Unico American Corp.
(UNAM) Some of you may recall that Archie Mcallaster mentioned this in
Barron's, perhaps in the yearly roundtable. He said that last year, the
chairman wanted to sell, but couldn't get it done. But its likey he will
eventually sell the company one day, but not in this nasty envoironment.

This might be classified as a micro cap stock. It is a small insurer, with only
6.3 m shares out, trading at under $7.50 today. Book value is about $8.50 per
share. So it is small, but high quality. The chairman isn't choosing to grow in
this environment. Rather, he wants to maintain a positive underwriting margin.
So premiums are falling. But about 14% of the company's revenue seems to be fee
based, as the company owns a small agency and an adjustor. In good times, this
makes for a highly profitable company, with pretax profit margins in the 26%
range (1998).

As many of you know, this year has been one of the worst years for insurance
companies. Even so, UNAM will likely earn over a buck in 1999. Keep in mind,
things can go very wrong with insurers, and "bad things" seemed to happen to
this company in 1992. But it bounced back quickly.

Last year the company earned 17% on average equity. Selling under book today,
were it to earn 17% again, YOUR return on equity is over 20%. With an earnings
yield of 14% to 15% at today's price with excellent economics, I think UNAM is
worth a look.

As an aside, the lates proxy shows that Gen Re was a significant holder.

So you're the other one buying UNAM! Premium revenue is dropping - I have been

assumed that NAV is tied up in T-bills which the market perceives as losing
value with the rise in interest rates. However my understanding is that given
no sudden catastrophic loss that requires coverage, they just get rolled - at
the new rate. I believe that there was some recent insider buying at above
current price.

Wright Sullivan: thanks for JOE info.

I'm one of those "poor lost souls". Poor and lost because I've been following
JOE on and off for 25 years or more and never took a position.

Recently started looking at it yet again. And with today's news, I have
actually stepped in and started to buy some of the danged thing.

Imo, these real estate owner and developer companies (non-REITs and
non-dividend paying) should be bought with a 5 year holding expectation at
least. Although with JOE, it did very well in 1997 for thread readers who
purchased at about this level (20-22) and saw a runnup to about 35. Began right
after Jim Clarke, I believe, posted on JOE about their new start to unlock
shareholder value. And from today's news, reinforces their seriousness about
doing so.

Since these companies are mostly specific to one geographical area and we have
seen some recessions/booms that themselves occur in specific sections of the
country (and that affect local real estate prices in those sections), it's
possibly a good idea to be diversified among these companies. (Unless of
course, someone were an expert as regards a specific company or a specific area
of the country.) I now have small positions in four such companies. CDX, strong
in California, is one for example, where I'm intending to add to my small
stake.

Thanks for mentioning this. I just listened to part of the conference call
before deciding to take a 1/2 position in it. My understanding is that the
hurdles remaining to overcome are 1. Private letter ruling from IRS. 2.
Approval of majority of minority owners of Florida East Coast.

Took the position because I have always wanted to own this company and I see
this as a catalyst that shows that management is actually doing something to
increase shareholder value. ALso I note that Fla. East Coast has a
Telecommunications division that may not be fully reflected in its share price.

Armin-

Exactly correct on the two hurdles which must be overcome for this deal
(JOE/FLA) to go through. But there is no question that FLA will be
"rationalized" in some regard, because JOE's Rummell has clearly stated for
many months that a railroad does not fit in with JOE's core real estate
business.

Perhaps the very recent quarterly JOE conf. call is still available. It was
informative. Once this spinoff is digested by the market, I personally don't
see much of a catalyst for JOE until around a year from now, because it will
take that long for some key developments on the Florida panhandle coast to
start bearing fruit. The jury is very much out on Rummell's overall plan for
building a vertically integrated real-estate operation.

Looking on a much longer timeframe, say 7-15 years, JOE looks like a great bet,
as the boomers retire and North Florida becomes a hot spot for development. I
think this is inevitable, and the price appreciation of properties in
well-managed communities can be dizzying. Beachfront and coastal property isn't
commodity-type land. I own JOE in an IRA and am holding for the very long term.

Regarding FLA, I am very impressed with the new management team over there, and
FLA presents an interesting combination of an improving core business (RR and
real estate) and the wildcard of their telecom division, which just signed a
fiber-swap arrangement with Enron which extends their network to Atlanta and
New Orleans. Nobody knows exactly what they plan to do with this network, or if
there will be a glut or paucity of intercity broadband media. So wildcard is
the operative word here.

I still need to crunch all the numbers, but I'm surprised JOE hasn't risen more
today.

These real estate owner/developer companies are a strange breed, indeed, and do
tend to be very regionally focused, so I agree on owning several and having a
very long timeframe.

A few additional notes from JOE call this morning:

- Makes you wonder how much of this was driven by the DuPont trust (owns 70% of
JOE and another 5% of FLA). The voting structure of the new class of stock
gives the trust the ability to pretty much name the FLA board. They may have
lost confidence in JOE over the last couple years, and wanted to own their huge
FLA chunk outright, instead of mostly through JOE.

- JOE wrote off $5 million last quarter for their ~1997 purchase of Entros, a
goofy Seattle-based entertainment company. No explanation by management of what
went wrong here, but I remember Jim Clarke mentioning this and the NFL-theme
restaurant fiasco as being warning signs of lost focus and questionable capital
allocation. By the way, you're right, Jim gets the credit for perfectly timing
both the buy decision (often easy) and the sell decision (IMO, far harder).

Additional note on JOE:

Based on today's closing prices for JOE (22-7/8) and FLA (34-7/8), the market
values the non-FLA portion of JOE at $15 per share. Since much of this value is
in land that is carried on JOE's books at no cost basis, it is very difficult
to assess the breakup value of JOE, but $15 sounds like value to me. But I
think it will remain a sleeper for a year or so.

They still own another, much smaller RR, but they don't have many non-core
businesses left to rationalize. Rummell acknowledged this in the Q&A today,
basically saying that it all comes down to execution now on developing the
existing low-cost-basis land.

Sam,

>Any reason the homebuilders selling < book value

I don't follow the industry, but the reasons are
"usual suspects": rates rising = home buying slump =
overbuilding = real-estate crash = home builders
Chapter 11 = catastrophe. Add additional - different -
scenario of economic slowdown = home buying slump ...
and you get the picture. Add the point that some
of homebuilders are vertically integrated with
building supplies and mortgage businesses, and the
picture is even worse.

If you believe that the fears are overblown, or that
valuations are too low in spite of fears, buy
the leader with low debt/equity, cause debt may break
the camel's back. See semi-equip crash last year, but
don't expect as fast recovery as semi-equips.
For less sanguine scenario, see HDD industry. ;-)

re. homebuilders:

book value typically consists of land, thus, when these stocks sell below book,

what an analyst for the sector said on Bloomberg yesterday -- the audio is
there to listen on a Bloomberg terminal if you bring up the news on CTX for
example. The guy emphasized that he thought they couldn't fall much farther.

I bought a little CTX today, adding to the LEN, KBH, CROS,

Congrats on DIO. I once looked at it and passed. Seemed too small with no rev.

In my opinion their stock looks cyclical; a couple of times in the past, when
the stock has run, it's run higher than the current price. So I wouldn't be
surprised to see a 50% increase even from today's new high price.

For me, I'm not able to discern if DIO, or any of these related
discrete-component companies, is now a buy based on value criteria. It looks
like DIO is, but I hesitate here because so much good news is already public
knowledge - the stocks all seem to have made big moves. AVX, KMET (which I
own), VSH. And in the past week, the distributor stocks have astonished me with
their run up (AVT, ARW). (Aside: -g- Come on SEMI. Where are you SEMI?). For

With today's market surge, it seemed like a lousy day for value investors to be
buying stocks. But I've still got one more I like.

I started a small position in Unifirst (UNF). It's a uniform rental company
that competes with lots of Mom & Pops as well as several big players. Among
them Angelica and Cintas. Angelica seems to me to be a terribly mismanged
company. Although they do have a new CEO now. Still, AGL stock price - at about
a 10 year low, suggests that are some problems (and opportunities). Plus
there's an 8%+ dividend yield (which I interpret as a warning signal). Cintas
(CTAS) is by far the dominant company in the industry. And the stock price
reflects that - higher pe, higher psr, etc. UNF has issues too. Earnings this
year may come in lower than last year. The company is family controlled and
dominated. It is a business with mediocre ROE. Debt/equity is .38, double
previous years.

I like UNF @ $12 1/2 though because:

1. For paying a pe ratio of 8, you get a company with 30 years of continuous
revenue growth.

2. PSR, P/Bk, and PE are all now lower than average in past several years.

3. The stock is selling at about a 4 or 5 year low.
