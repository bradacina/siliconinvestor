CMBS article from CNBC.
http://www.cnbc.com/id/27930515/page/2/

Commercial real estate loans rated AAA for 14-16% !. The article leaves out how
small grunts like me can invest in this. Are there bond funds or closed end
funds out there that invest in this? Seems like a great opportunity - with the
senior tranche you are first in the soup line if things default and get a piece
of still valuable RE at distressed valuation. It's a great opportunity for go
anywhere bond fund. Suggestions welcome.

Hi Spekulatius - Could the bond market offering such high yields be discounting
for a much weaker dollar in the long term? Long term debit with yields much
higher than the historical "normal" rate of return is the markets way of
pricing in more risk, more potential defaults or perhaps a much weaker $US
dollar in the future.

I am not sure if long term rates are similar around the world or if other
countries have as much exposure as the U.S. has in domestic corporate debt but
these higher yields are flashing a red flag. It seems to me that with the FED
pumping so much money in the system, the net long term effect should be much
higher inflation and a relative weaker $US compared to other currencies.

I suspect there are a lot of cross currents in the pricing system. These yields
will only hold if there are significant defaults out in the future or the
revenue streams (generated from the reals assets) significantly fall or the
value of the dollar falls significantly. None of these outcomes are very good.

The only other outcome I see is if this is just a temporary miss pricing of the
underlying assets by the market making the relative bond yields much higher
than the norm. It's possible that the expected shortfall in the future revenue
streams are not really that bad and prices will rise bringing long term yields
back to historical normal levels.

As a value investor, you are always looking for the miss pricing scenario (with
a minimal entry risk point). Speculating on the corporate debt may be one way
to do this. Paul may be onto something looking to buy positions in long term
corporate bond funds at current prices and yields.

The assumption of a US$ weakness would affect other LT debt categories as well,
for example LT treasuries. This is apparently not the case - it's the spread of
commercial mortgage rates over the treasury yield that is at all time high.
This points to a specific problem with commercial RE not a problem with the US$
value.

I think it's positive for the buyer now but not that positive for the folks or
entities who are holding the paper (insurance companies, banks etc. ) or who
are holding straight CMRE loans (which are not traded) yielding 7% or so.
Commercial RE is a bread& butter business for many smaller banks. If it happens
to be that Commercial RE is indeed so risky that it deserves mid teens interest
rates many banks are going to be toast. RE developers and REIT's are going to
be toast as well of course because refinancing means death.

I think the current yield exaggerate the problem and would be happy to take
that part of a trade, but i think it is unlikely that the market right now is
completely wrong and we go back to 7% cost of capital any time soon either.

Hi Grommit - Here are the top ten holdings for the Vanguard REIT Index ETF
(VNQ). The fund is now yielding 7.4%.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AVB,BXP,EQR,GGP,HCP,KIM,PLD,PSA,SPG,VNO&d=s

There is also a new ETF called PowerShares Active U.S. Real Estate Fund (PSR )
http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/funds/etf-update/10448393.html?cm_ven=YAHOO&cm_
at=FREE&cm_ite=NA

From the article"...One advantage of an actively managed approach is the
Invesco team will be able to avoid areas of the market that have been among the
hardest hit from the credit crunch. "PSR is focused on commercial real estate
and not single-family housing," said Rodriguez. "While tenant demand may be
lagging, commercial property markets are entering this slowdown with relatively
contained levels of new construction. Unlike previous commercial property
cycles, we are not seeing massive overbuilding." ..."

Here are the top 10 holdings for PSR. There appears to be about an 80% overlap
to the Vanguard REIT Index VNQ:
http://www.invescopowershares.com/products/overview.aspx?ticker=PSR

Here are all of PSR's holdings by % of fund:
http://www.invescopowershares.com/products/holdings.aspx?ticker=PSR

===========================================================

Maybe the conservative approach for these REITs would be to buy into one of
these funds rather than buying individual REITs. It's easy to hit a land mine
and get wiped out when buying individual companies.

The expense ratio for PSR is 0.8% vs VNQ at 0.1%.

- it's the spread of commercial mortgage rates over the treasury yield that is
at all time high. This points to a specific problem with commercial RE not a

I think that if you compare yield on any corporate debt to treasuries, that you
will find the spreads to be high. The problem is not specific to RE, it is a
problem for all debt that has to be refinanced. here is a 11/20 news link:

"NEW YORK - An unrelenting flight from risky securities sent yields on bonds
that finance corporate operations and residential and commercial real estate to
record highs on Thursday, exacerbating the credit squeeze tipping the U.S.
economy into recession... Yield spread premiums on a commercial mortgage-backed
securities index roared higher to records for a third straight day, leading
deterioration in fixed-income securities on concerns that economic weakness
will boost defaults on loans that depend on office building and shopping mall
rents...Illustrating corporate debt stress, U.S. credit default swaps widened
to record levels on Thursday that suggest investors expect the worst period of
investment-grade corporate bond defaults since at least 1980, according to
analysts. The main investment-grade credit default swap index widened to a
record 282.5 basis points in late trade, according to data from Markit
Intraday. The cash corporate bond market was "falling apart" with spreads
gapping wider, one trader said."

re Debt

 I think that if you compare yield on any corporate debt to treasuries, that
you will find the spreads to be high. The problem is not specific to RE, it is
a problem for all debt that has to be refinanced. here is a 11/20 news link: 

True the spreads have risen significantly. BBB debt trades at around 9-10%.

However my point is that RE related debt goes beyond that. For example KIM &
SPG cooperate debt trades at around 11-12% depsite being rated higher at A-.
the values for commercial mortgage paper with 14-16% are just astronomical and
exceed anything i have ever heard before. This means that the buyers (or
sellers) of this paper are very concerned about the RE market.

This is going to affect a lot of players in the RE market. REIT's are obvious
but for example GE finance has 88B$ in assets in commercial RE for example per
Q3 10Q. I am almost talking myself into a short here...

%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:12/2/2008 3:07:50 PM
From:Spekulatius
Oblomove. I prefer EV/EBITDA as a metric because it accounts for leverage. Many
folks use FFO/share (or better even AFFO/share price) price. FFO/share price
accounts for leverage as well in the sense that the cost of interest is
subtracted when calculating FFO. However the FFO/share price metric could in
the past be boosted by increasing leverage (since interest rates were low)
which as we all are finding out increases risk as well.

EV/EBITDA should scale well with the intrinsic cap rate of the RE portfolio a
REIT owns which incidentally is an important valuation metric.

Of course debt maturity etc and financing matter a great deal as well. When you
do go through leverage adjusted metrics you will find out that chasing yields
with REIT is not a good idea in many case - the twin sister REITS CLI and BDN
being a good example.

I've begun adding more shares today my Sysco position.

"Sysco is the global leader in selling, marketing and distributing food
products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging
establishments and other customers who prepare meals away from home. Its family
of products also includes equipment and supplies for the foodservice and
hospitality industries. The company operates 180 distribution facilities
serving more than 400,000 customers. For the fiscal year 2008 that ended June
28, 2008, the company generated more than $37 billion in sales."

A big plus would seem to be that distribution costs have come down or are
coming down (fuel cost for the trucks that Sysco uses to make all those
deliveries). Otoh, with demand for hotel rooms (and hotel meals) down, and with
people reducing restaurant visits, the number of Sysco deliveries might be
fewer and quantities delivered less.

At the current price, you do get the dominant company in the industry, a long
history of rising dividends (with the div. yield now up to 4%), great roe, and
a company profitable every year (so far).

I'll repeat an opinion I've had before: I've observed Mr. Buffett has bought
his food stocks at p/e of 12. With that he gets the brand names of the company
he's purchased. With SYY, you get a p/e at or below 12 too now. You don't get
the well-known consumer brand names, but you do get a powerhouse - in size and
scale - a company that delivers food products that commercial customers need -
Sysco's commercial brands. And this is a very diverse customer base.

If stock will drop a point more or so on no adverse news, I'll consider if I

conflicting ideas about what the problems are, how to solve them, when or/if

Otoh, things were pretty bleak too around '73-'74 with stocks, with the
war,with high inflation, OPEC issues, etc. etc. We got through that, we'll get

Maybe getting flushed from trading isn't such a bad thing. There's also
investing though. Anybody who calls himself/herself a value investor and isn't
buying stocks these days is anything but a value investor. From what I read
even the perma-bear deep value pros are finding pockets that are cheap on an

Buying deeply undervalued stocks and holding them until Mr. Market pays up for

I started a position in the BRANDYWINE RTY PFD C (NYSE: BDN-PC) 7.50% Series C
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares

These preferred shares were originally issued on 12/29/03 at a price of $25.00.
From their original prospectus below:"... The Series C Preferred Shares will
rank senior to our common shares of beneficial interest, which we refer to as
our Common Shares, and on a parity with our 750,000 outstanding 7.25% Series A
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares ($50.00 liquidation preference) which
we refer to as our Series A Preferred Shares, and any other parity securities
that we may issue in the future (including additional Series C Preferred
Shares)...."

0-37332&type=sect&TabIndex=2&companyid=8858&ppu=%252fdefault.aspx%253fcik%253d7
0816

The Series C preferred shares pay $0.4688 per quarter ($1.875/year) which now
yields 25% at the current price of $7.50/share. This is a cumulative preferred
with a callable value set at $25/share.

The proceeds of this issue was used to pay off their Series B preferred shares
(in Jan 2004) that were a 8.5% cumulative preferred.

=================================================================

My thought on starting a small position in this preferred is that this is like
owning the debt of the REIT. I fully expect the common dividend to be cut while
the preferred continues to be paid. BDN might do what Post Properties announced
yesterday (
http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINN0229746520081203?rpc=44 ) where
they cut their common dividend by 55% and announced a small buy back of their
common or preferred shares. Their 7 5/5% preferred "B" shares were up 9% on the
announcement.

Because this is a cumulative preferred, the dividends are accumulated in the
event the distribution is cut or eliminated for a few quarters. These
accumulated dividends must eventually be paid off or distributed from any
proceeds from a BK.

This is either a deep discounted value play or just another value trap. Buyers
beware.

I sold some Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) to buy this starter position which I
hold in my IRA.

EDIT: Lehman had a sizable position (SEC report 2008) which I believe will be
liquidated in their BK that has (or will) provide an excellent entry point for

CLP preferred shares.

CLP.PR.D
Selling for $13.
Annual dividend $2.03
Yield = 15.6%

Operating earnings are over 40 cents a qtr. That is after the preferred
interest payment! And with the 40 cents, they expect to pay 25 cents dividend
to common per qtr. At $5.55 common, the common yield is 18%. Not than much
different than the pref, but they cannot pay the common unless they pay the
preferred.

And I think that the CLP-D shares have price appreciation potential just like
the common.

And I think the company is setting a floor price of $13:
"We have a lot of capacity... and still have almost $150 million of cash to
spend on... buying back securities, and right now as we look at it these
preferreds that are trading at $13 a share, almost yield of 13% to 14% [wrong,
15.6%] look ridiculously cheap and very attractive from a return standpoint."

There are other reit preferred shares with a higher yield. But none in the
apartment sector, and none with such low leverage. But for the really

Hi Grommit - It's some what scary as a lot of these preferred shares are priced
as if these companies are going bankrupt. The one reason I am attracted to
these types of shares is that with the current spread between the "TARP" funds
that banks can borrow and the current commercial mortgage rates, there should
be enough of an incentive (up to 900 basis points) for the banks to refinance
REIT debt. It will be interesting to watch what new type of lending is done in
the next 6-8 months. At some point this "TARP" money must find its way into the
debt market.

Currently, banks are still a bit timid to commit to new refinancing
obligations. When they eventually do a few of these deals, the market should
rally these preferred shares so that the yield reflects a more "normal" market
rate like 8%-12%.

When I look at the book value on yahoo, seems extremely misleading. A review of
the 10Q indicates that sales are declining, and that book value is

negative book value of over 750 mil. That coupled with a general cutback in
Consumer spending is enough to keep me at bay. They have 5.500 people to pay

Brazil to up infrastructure spending amid meltdown
Wednesday December 3, 4:56 pm ET
Brazil to increase infrastructure spending 34 percent to counter economic
crisis

SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A top government official says Brazil will boost
infrastructure spending by about 34 percent to counter the effects of the
global economic meltdown.

Official news service Agencia Brasil quotes Chief of Staff Dilma Rousseff as
saying the government will spend 636 billion reals ($254 billion) through 2010.

That's up from some 475 billion reals originally set aside for its Growth
Acceleration Program.

Launched in January 2007, the program funds housing, education, public health,
transportation and energy projects.

Agencia Brasil's report was published Wednesday.

I'll go for a few shares of the CLP-D preferred.

These preferreds which now offer yields comparable or superior to stock price
performance (the ole Ibbotson 10.7 annualized number) have got to be
considered. Perhaps some of these companies will default forever (the
preferreds are cumulative so skipped div's have to be made up -- IF the company
survives enough to do so), but there will be preferreds (companies) that muddle
through. So I am hoping/expecting. And unless there's hyperinflation where
treasuries yield 8,12, 16 or more percent, these preferreds at current price
have got to be considered for a portfolio. Maybe not bought, but considered.
-g- . I'll be a buyer of some.

Here's where my preference would be a managed fund. The problem is these funds
use leverage to hype the yield and juice the assets (managers being paid on
assets under management, not on their fund's price performance). And that
leverage is in arcane (arcane to me anyway) stuff that's frozen or otherwise
scary.

EKS, regarding those Brazil stocks: Maybe ULTR. None of the others looks like a
screaming value to me. They may be good values though at the price. I hold
shares in all; I'd not be adding yet to any at current price. If some hit lows
or new lows again, I might consider adding more. ULTR surely.

I don't find a recent article I read on Brazil infrastructure. Something about
how some of it literally stinks. For example next to Rio airport there's like a
lake of sewage that accosts the traveler. The problem (according to the author)
has been the Brazilian boom/bust cycle. This has prevented long-term planning
and implementation of infrastructure improvements because there's been no
long-term assurance that there'll not be a bust during the long build out
phases of costly infrastructure programs.

You might use me as a contra-indicator for RIO. (I might be giving up right at
the low.)

"Brazilian miner Vale said on Wednesday it is laying off 1,300 workers and will
put 5,500 more on paid leave as the world's largest iron ore producer grapples
with plunging demand from steel mills." Coupled with FCX's news of layoffs and
dividend elimination, I have to assume it'll be a while before customer orders
will rise again. My http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=RIO (<span

add in '06 --- I sold half my position today. I will gamble that I might be
able to buy back some shares at even lower prices later on. And for the next
several months I'll just take my chance with the sales proceeds with something
like Fidelity's junk bond fund, FAGIX. Which I did add to with a small buy.

I still hold positions in other Brazilian companies in addition to the ones

UTX - not a buy yet, IMO. Stock has outperformed so far and their business

Otis Elevator) is going to be strongly affected by the CE RE downturn. He was
talking about 30% growth in elevator order for China. I take it know that this

down - until this is fully build in the stock I would treat carefully.

FWIW, investors did take GE presentation well. Deleveraging is in. However the

The chatter on the street is that there is still a lot of hedge fund selling
still left to be completed in December. I suspect there will be some excellent
"low ball" buys available in the next 25 days as we close out the year.

I am not sure if some of these bargains are "value traps" but I continue to

FCSX. Looks like there've been known problems with Sentinel for more than a
year. FCSX have announced a write-off of $5M this quarter. If significantly
more write-offs or write-downs are coming with Sentinel and management knows
this, that's material information, and imo, should be disclosed. I see nothing
though in my review the website and Google, so I'm guessing there's nothing
forthcoming with Sentinel that'll destroy FCSX's balance sheet.

One thing I don't like from the latest quarterly is:

" * A charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 of $0.8 million,
equal to $0.03 per diluted share, net of tax in connection
with the company's decision to freeze all benefit accruals
under its pension plans. For the upcoming fiscal year
2009, we expect to realize a savings of approximately $0.9
million, net of tax, in pension related expenses related
to the freezing of the pension plans..."

Things may be worse than I understand if management has to clamp down on
employee retirement benefits. (If that's what the above blurb is saying.) And
it doesn't seem like that much of a savings to me vs. the ill-will it might be
giving employees.

One other thing. This is apparently is the successor business to a commodity
brokerage firm that's been in business for more than fifty years. The stock's
been public only since '07 though.

CHK - same old same old. When you look through the numbers it is clear hat the
operating cash flow does not cover Capex. It never did with this company. They
are counting on assets sales to make up for the negative free cash flow.

Including the debt, CHK is not cheap with 4.8x EBITDA/EV. XEC for example is a
reasonably well managed NG company that is way cheaper and not in any danger of
going out of business.

CHK, XEC. I believe they'll both come back as demand strengthens.

For now and the next few months it looks to me that either supply and demand
are in balance at current low demand and prices, or else that new supply coming
on line is more than adequate for the demand. If gas stock prices aren't moving
up now, then when - that's what is bothering me. It could be another year.
Perhaps the troughs in stock prices and gas/oil prices have not even been seen
yet.

If oil/gas prices stay down for a while, and a while is enough to where in '09
and '10 hedges start coming off, then these companies might be in for some
difficulty.

If I presume these stocks are value stocks that might revert to mean numbers
if/as oil/gas prices increase, then I'd guess these two companies and others in
the sector could double or triple or more. Which would beat other value
investments I might make now where I at best envision maybe a 50% or 100% rise.
In this latter case, the problem might be for companies to maintain their
revenue base. For the e&p's, the issue might be, can they make money from their
production quantities & mix (ie. from the revenue they will generate)?

I've decided I'm not willing to hold so many positions in e&p companies which,
although they have assets, might not make profits from their revenues. I have
dropped my CHK and XEC positions to much smaller amounts and have sold down or
out others as well. Still have a chunk of my portfolio bet on the sector
though.

Can't resist adding my two cents here. I believe this period of low natural gas
prices will work to encourage the installation of natural gas heating and
cooking systems in the NE. In addition the increasing use of NG by utility
companies is being encouraged. Once these NG systems are in place, they are
unlikely to be dismantled when the price of NG again starts to rise. So those
NG related companies with staying power may well benefit in the future from
today's NG market.

In addition to making some practical sense, those converting to NG will feel
that great green inner glow of environmental correctness. And the powers that
be are indeed touting NG as the fuel of the future. My daughter reports seeing
posters everywhere in Washington (D.C.) extolling the great virtues of NG.
Apparently you can't ride on the D.C. Metro without seeing such posters
prominently displayed.

Personally I would search for E&P (or other NG related) companies with both
solid finances and intelligent management. My minimum test for managerial
intelligence would be intelligent enough to have not over leveraged both the
company and themselves personally when NG prices where peaking.

Although patience may be required, this to me would be the ideal time to be
slowly acquiring quality NG related companies.

re Natural Gas.
I think that Natural Gas use for residential will increase over time but I do
not expect a short term boost First of all, installation costs are not trivial
so the current economic climate and second crude has become much cheaper too. A
big part

The way i see it, NG in NA is cyclical there are boom bust cycles with a
frequency of about 3 years. The way I see it this frequency may result by the
time it takes to get wells started, the infrastructure into place and the
decline (for most wells the throughput declines by 50% during the 1st year of
service). So if this is correct ( a big if in the current situation) then 2010
would be the time to invest.

XEC with decent management and low debt is not a bad bet, IMO. Serial diluter
like CHK may find themselves between a rock and hard place.

Nice analysis which makes a lot of sense. However, timing predictions are
always somewhat problematic. The joker in the deck could be how strongly the
new administration wishes to push for domestic NG as a replacement for imported
foreign oil. Maybe they will offer tax incentives for the conversion from
heating oil to NG.

With some additional infrastructure, we have enough NG to go a long way towards
energy independence. Perhaps they will encourage the build out of the NG
infrastructure instead of focusing only on building more roads and bridges.

Eh, posted my message to the wrong forum, so here is post for Value Investors:

I read through Graham's "Intelligent Investor" while in Galapagos, so now I
know :P that I should have at least 25% of portfolio in bonds at all times. :)
Unfortunately, I do not trust bond funds, even less than I trust stock funds.
IMHO, very tough for me to judge what the heck they hold and what the heck will
be the result. Graham is not very helpful with this either, since he recommends
either treasuries - the yield of which has been beaten down to nothing - or
your own diversification, which means at least 100K in bonds. At least he gives
pointers on how to choose the bonds, while if you buy a bond fund, you have no
clue what it has. And you cannot trust bond ratings at all at this time.

I must say that current situation is probably one of the FEW times in our lives
when a person SHOULD be 100% in stocks. The deals are just too good. So screw
the bonds. :) On the other hand, I'd like some education if someone wants to
talk on what bonds to buy.

I flipped GNW short term bonds for a wash, gained some on MS bond, gained some
on AIG bond. No losses so far. ;) All sold. I still hold DCE, IDG, BCS-C,
RBS-N. All of these are probably stinkers for Graham, but maybe OK for now for
me. Assuming I trust Euro government guarantees.

10-15% loan rates to 10% fed rates - 15% loan rates, without going through 0
fed rate - 5% loan rates, but IMHO this is unlikely. ;)

I am not an expert in this though lol. :)

MMM is a conservative investment here. Not a 3X expectation. I have a small
position and I won't increase it unless it tanks.

Here is a good example where the earnings yield of a great business is still at
~8.5%, which is not that exciting when the earnings may drop and some good
bonds trade at much more attractive yields. ;) Stocks I am buying for 3X goals
have earnings yields in 15-30% levels. But they are not safe as MMM. ;)

Hi Paul - Any idea why SVU would "declassify their board of directors"? From my
research companies believes that this provides for "better" corporate
governance but it appears that many companies that do this either (1)
restructure & spin off subsidiaries, (2) easier to merge or sell the company or
(3) are forced to do this by major shareholders (ie Calpers).

SUPERVALU Will Declassify Board of Directors
Wednesday December 3, 4:50 pm ET

On 11/20/08 you posted the article "Supervalu shares dive to 17-year low" and
now this announcement.

There does not appear to be any unusual insider activity. In fact many of the

I listened to the whole segment and came away thinking there's a fair share of
b.s. to this guy, saying his view is that the situation will be worse than what
Nouriel Roubini has been touting. And acting like he was the only one that saw
this thing coming -- he could have spent time since 2004 reading all about it
right here on SI in the Epic American Credit and Bond Bubble thread.

But the reason I hung in there to the end was to hear what he had to say about
how much hedge fund liquidation was yet to unwind. Even Charlie Rose expressed
his frustration at not being able to get more than a general answer whenever
he's asked one of these doom and gloom experts to specify what will happen,
what will be the consequences, how long will it last. Taleb was very evasive in
response.

That seems to be the great unknown. I've heard the de-leveraging that has to
occur described as massive by Faber, Roubini, Taleb, Zulauf.... But nobody
seems willing or able to give any kind of ordinal order of magnitude. So how do
we know whether it is almost over or not!?

I'm skeptical of Taleb's "end of capitalism 1" scenario. What I'm trying to
figure is whether to play this as a severe recession or another depression. My
inclination is to NOT play it as another great depression. Why? Ironically, it
does not seem to be a good strategy to bank on a tail event.

Re. "(The)current situation is probably one of the FEW times in our lives when
a person SHOULD be 100% in stocks.

I take the other side. One of the few times a person might want to have a
decent bond component.

In my previous post about LSBRX, the Barron's November article link said this:

"Part of the problem is that prices are being depressed by sellers in an
illiquid market. The last quote on $100,000 bonds will determine the value of a
$1 billion issue, depressing the remaining $999.9 million.

That's produced much pain for corporate-bond investors, such as Dan Fuss, the
market veteran who heads the Loomis Sayles Bond Fund (ticker: LSBRX) and also
is its biggest shareholder. So he's been hit by the 25.89% year-to-date
negative return, according to Morningstar.

The Loomis Sayles Bond Fund yields 9.78% on a portfolio that is primarily
invested in what Fuss deems the sweet spot of the market -- single-A and
triple-B corporates yielding 10% to 12%. About a quarter of fund is in junk
bonds, where he's picking up yields upwards of 18%.

More importantly, Fuss says, these yields are on deeply discounted bonds. So,
buyers of these bonds, which are selling for 60 or 70 cents on the dollar, will
participate in their eventual recovery, earning capital gains along with hefty
current yields.

"I prefer discount bonds to admittedly cheap equities," especially as
corporations delever and rebuild balance sheets, he continues. The best use of
corporate cash now may be to buy back bonds at discounts, effectively
discharging debt for pennies on the dollar, Fuss says. It's a reversal of the
past quarter-century, during which companies took on debt to do leveraged
buyouts or repurchase stock."

I buy this guy's argument.

And from Oct 28 Kiplinger's columnist Steven Goldberg:

"Except for securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, the global financial crisis
has hammered just about every kind of investment, stocks and bonds alike. One
of the best bond funds, Loomis Sayles Bond (symbol LSBRX), lost 27%
year-to-date through October 24 -- an almost unimaginable decline for a fund
that mainly buys investment-grade debt.

In my mind, Loomis Sayles Bond, a member of the Kiplinger 25, represents a
classic buying opportunity. If you don't own a stake in the fund, now is the
time to buy. If you are already invested in it, consider adding to your
shrunken stake. "If you're a smart investor and you have cash, these markets
are as cheap as they've ever been," says co-manager Kathleen Gaffney. "Bonds
are a lot cheaper than stocks. I have a hard time thinking there's anything
else this cheap." Over the next couple of years, she says, corporate bonds
could return a total of 30% to 40%."

----------------------------------------
It's perhaps a matter of age/net worth/perspective/risk tolerance/volatility
tolerance. Same situation as with 3M vs. other stuff like beat down small cap
value stocks. IF our USA economy recovers to some decent level then some of the
downtrodden stocks will go up 2,3,4 times from lows. More conservative stuff
will not or may not. Although I've lost quite a bit of money this year, and I
like the idea of trying to recover a lot of that with such multi-bagger stocks,
for me, I have to consider the things in the paragraph's first sentence. I've
decided that in a very diverse portfolio the likes of which I still have, I am
better served at this time having at least a small bond component. A fund such
as LSBRX looking back in a few years might be a sorry performer compared to
downtrodden stocks being bought now. Otoh, at this point in time, envisioning a
10% yield in a bond fund that's already dropped in price compared to normal
times, that has an historically astute manager, and being able to hope for some
revision to mean - a capital gain in the bonds and hence the fund...well, that
looks appealing to me. For example, more so than continually riding wave and
trough with a large position in oil stocks where we believe we know that oil
prices will once again rise substantially (and so will their stocks), but the
timing is unknown.

I am continuing to build my LSBRX position.

Nice move in cement maker http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CX today. At lower
prices, I exited my stub position(oops). Still holding Pargesa (
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PRGAF though, which among other things, owns 21%
of Lafarge (which in turn has 15,000 employees in the USA in cement
manufacturing, aggregates and concrete and gypsum).

From the WSJ:

"Materials and construction companies, after falling for the better part of
three months, led the charge after President-elect Barack Obama pledged to
spend more on infrastructure.

Notably, Mexican cement giant Cemex closed up $2.07, or 28%, at $9.40 on the
NYSE"

Question is a general one - what to do now, now that many companies, cyclical
or value, have come off lows? For some like Pargesa, I'll continue to hold, add
if they retouch lows. Others, I am merely guessing that they could drop back
down as market continues its gyrations. I'll likely close my

CX' rise is probably a result of Obama's infrastructure package. I think those

Natural resource stocks are scary right now. Mittal reducing steep production

luck suing in China) and demanding that prices are scaled back to 1994 (!)
levels if I read a blip on Bloomberg TV correctly. Maybe another long winter
for natural resource stocks - the last one went from 1985 to 2004. I am not
convinced at all we are going back to Y2006./2007 prices anytime soon but -
these stocks do have nice bounces of their lows if you can catch them.

I tend to agree that we should not be playing for the market for another

and massive hedge fund liquidation still to come. He may be right, but in my
experience, once they start getting adamant after having a good run already,
continued gains for Taleb start getting questionable. Kinda like oil at 147 and
the whole world including GS calling for 200. Now with oil at 43, the whole
world including GS is calling for 20.

So when Paul Senior throws in a towel on stocks, is that the sign of market

I understand your reasoning. In fact, I agree that stocks may be depressed also
because bond investments are rather attractive. And part of me says that bond
yields are attractive. Yet, if I don't buy stocks now when I see real
opportunities for 3X and bigger returns, when would I buy them? When they are
up 50%+ and my bonds are yielding 5-7%?

OT. I'll start buying PG at current levels. Continuing a cautious, more
defensive position with my major portfolio.

I'm not viewing PG as a value stock. P/e is relatively low (compared to PG's
history), but not absolutely low at 16x. Company's roe has dropped in recent
years. Perhaps they are trying to correct that by making divestitures of lower
profit margin stuff like Folger's.

Because PG has such strength in consumer disposables - what they call "Everyday
Solutions", it's likely (imo) that the company could survive either a severe
recession, a stagflation, or a large inflationary period. The stock yields
2.6%, and dividends have been raised every year for at least the past 20 years.

(Nice 50-year dividend chart in here:
http://www.pg.com/investors/fin_trends.shtml)

I call P&G at current price 'safe and cheap enough'.

Starting with a few shares now, I'll average down if/as
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PG will fall back to lows.

I'm looking for some balance. I'm not saying don't buy the potential
multibaggers --- I am continuing to buy such. Just not putting all such eggs in
the basket -- leaving more room for things where I can be more confident of
gains (albeit lesser gains) with moat companies or dividend-payers or bonds. We
are all in different financial circumstances and with different risk profiles.
I've no outside source of income so recovery from losses over time with
saving/investing from a job is not available to me. Risk management then is
important to me- I'd like not to go broke if things do get and stay very, very
bad for businesses and stocks. And they have in past.

want to risk a potential default. (Another one is ASFI, but it is way too late
to sell it.) I see a lot of bargains in unlevered space that can potentially
perform as well or better than CX.

SYK is a good defensive play, so I would not sell it if I had it. But I won't

I am having a big conflict regarding the natural gas producers. On the one

success with their shale plays. And they are finding LOTS of success according
to recent announcements. So is it like a glut will be coming onto the market?
How can anyone be betting on these companies now - even if the companies are

such gas seems to be so plentiful and so accessible now?

Paul,

Don't get offended by my attempt of humor. :)

I totally understand you. For people who need income, current bond prices are
great. Actually if I got an offer to buy a safe bond that produces 15% or so
yield for 30 years, I would put 100% of my portfolio into it. OK, I am joking
about 100%, but 50% maybe. :)

The problem I have is that most of bonds offer maybe 15-18% for now and couple
more years, but not for 10 or 30 years. 10-30 year average return of 15% would
be great. For shorter time periods, I expect that stocks will higher returns as
economy recovers and PEs expand again.

Good luck with your defensive investing side. :)

Pickens suggested that we have a nationwide system of NG fueling stations for
gas powered vehicles. This could reduce our dependence on foreign oil, which
may be ok now that oil is under $50 but it wont stay there forever and the time
to do this is now. Doesnt it make sense to use a local resource that is more
plentiful than an imported one?
