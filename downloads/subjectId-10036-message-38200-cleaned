Re EME.

At the moment, I'm about 40% in cash with about 90 companies on my watch list.
EME is on my <u>very</u> short list.

I quite agree with Spek's assessment of EME.

"re EME - i like the business (asset light, seemingly scalable) but the stock
is not terribly cheap and the business has yet to bottom. Analyst prediction
growth for 2011 but my concern is, if this growth is late to materialize, the
stock could fall quite a bit more"

Nonetheless, here are some metrics on EME. Thin margins are something of a
concern, as are declining revenues.

EME has grown FCF at about an 18% rate (compounded) over the last 10 years. I
come up with a FCF yield of 14.6%, which roughly corresponds to a P/FCF ratio
of about 7. FCF has been positive 9 of the last 10 years. Since 2003, the only
year of negative FCF, EME has grown FCF like a weed, @54% compounded for 5
years. ttm FCF dwarfs earnings by better than 2/1, so it <u>doesn't</u> appear
that the CFO is playing games with accruals.

Since 2005, the median CROIC is 19.9%, but it dropped to @15% for the TTM. EME
has also grown shareholder equity at better than 20% (again, compounded) for
the decade. The Morningstar financials show that the company has no long-term
debt and $601M in cash. With about 68M shares outstanding, that comes to nearly
$9/shr in cash. However, the number of shares has steadily increased from @54M
in 2000.

From MSN, the ttm ROE is 12.6, slightly lower than the 5-year value of 14.8.
Debt/Equity is 0.12. EME pays no dividend.

P/CF and P/S are near 5 and 10 year averages, but P/B of 1.3(ttm) is slightly
lower than the 5yr (1.8) and 10yr (1.5) averages.

On the daily chart, price has fallen below its 30-day MA, but the weekly chart
looks a bit better, although price has dropped below both the 20 and 40-week
MAs. From the weekly, I'd say it could go either way, but momentum looks lousy.

Morningstar puts a Fair Value of $23 on the stock; S&P rates it a Buy; Zacks
gives it a rating of 3 (hold). The Piotroski number is 6. The Piotroski #
negatives are from the increased # of shares, YTY declining ROA, and YTY
declining gross margins.

The Morningstar Cash Flow statement also shows business purchases/investment in
the last few years. In February, EME announced the purchase of privately held
Scalise Industries of Pittsburgh, a 60 YO engineering firm. In January, 2009
EME acquired LT Mechanical of Charlotte, NC.

EME is one of my favorite companies, but, again, I agree with Spek. I guess
we're talking about a cyclical here and the stock price is <u>something of</u>
a falling knife at the moment. There have been a slew of contract awards in the
news, but the CEO of the last 16 years is scheduled to retire in January. He
will be replaced by the COO, who has been with EME since 2004, about the time
the company's fortunes turned up significantly.

re EME - you FCF yield is off, at least the way I calculate FCF. Their cash
increased because their receivable shrunk and their receivable shrunk because
their revenue base shrunk.

I calculate FCF as earnings + depreciation - Capex and ingnore working capital
changes (in most cases). This eliminates most wild swings. With this, FCF is
about equal to earnings, which is all one can reasonably expect on a LT bases
anyways (unless a company finds a way to reduce fixed assets and increase then
business at the same time).

RE: SuperValu Inc. Common Stock (NYSE: SVU)

Increased my SVU shares by 25% with a purchase today. Stock is testing new lows
on lower volume. It could be signs that the relentless shareholder has (or is)
throwing in the towel on this stock.

There is chatter on the message boards that SVU may be getting ready for some
layoffs at their Bristol Farm stores one of their high end chains. This has
always been a very profitable chain and considered one of the crown jewels of
the SVU empire (at least when times were good).

It's possible they could be packaging these store for a possible sale, probably
a LBO by a private equity firm. I am not too sure if this would be a positive
or a negative. I could see SVU doing some type of deal where they keep the
distribution & warehouse operation support services (perhaps binding the buyer
to a 10 year distribution contract) but selling the branded retail franchise to
an independent operator (maybe to the employees w/ an LBO backer). This would
include selling the real estate for these stores. If the Bristol Farm stores
are packaged for sale in this manner, it may make a good deal for all the
parties and free up a lot of cash to reduce corporate LT debt.

I will continue to build my position.

FWIW after visiting my local WalMart, they are no threat to SVU at least for
the stores located here on the West Coast (ie. Lucky & Albertsons).

Picked up a small amount of shares in DryShips Inc. (NasdaqGS: DRYS). Stock is
near it's all time low and my premise is the selling got over done due to their
interests in four deep drilling Rigs.

Even after all the equity dilution (I believe two separate offerings in late
2009) and convertible bond sales (in early 2010) needed to raise cash reserves
to satisfy outstanding bank loan covenants, stock has a potential fair value
between $8/share and $12/share.

At $4.20/share, the risk reward is large enough (possible 2-3 bagger) that it's
worth a nibble. My overall position is small but I left a lot of money on the

Does SVU own both Lucky's and Albertson's?

I recall that Albertson's took over Lucky's, and around No. California it did
not work well, and next thing we know Lucky's is back. Seems odd for them to do
that with the same owner.

Lucky's is a better store now than it has been for awhile. Never did care for
Albertson's much.

I suspect they still have the union problem. I believe at Safeway they now have
the two tier union. Those with seniority continue to be overpaid (compared to
non-union wages) but the newer workers are paid less.

Target has gotten serious about adding food. They have good prices, but of

Hi geoffrey -

From Wikidpedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Stores
"...Save Mart acquired the Northern California division of Albertsons LLC on
November 27, 2006[14], which included the right to use the Lucky brand in the
areas Albertsons LLC operated.[15] In 2007, Save Mart converted 72 of the
acquired Albertsons stores to the Lucky banner in the San Francisco Bay
Area...".

There has been a lot of buying and selling of the acquired Albertson assets.
The same is also true with the branded name "Lucky". The grocery business is
very regional and a national brand really does not work except for WalMart.

You are quite correct regarding the two tiered union labor contracts. In
Northern CA and Southern CA both Albertsons (SVU & SaveMart) and Ralphs (parent
Kroger) transitioned to a two tiered union labor contract. I am not too sure
what is happening at Bristol Farms ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Farms
) but they may be in the middle of discussion on a new union labor contract
too.

For FCF, I use Cash from Operations (essentially Net Income with Depreciation
and Amortization added back in) less Capex.

For FY 2009, Net Income for EME was $161, according to both MStar and MSN. Cash
from Operations from both sources comes in at $359 and Capex is $24M, resulting
in FCF @$335M. I believe that both sources <u>do</u> include changes in working
capital (MSN breaks it out, MStar doesn't).

Receivables did shrink (which is usually a good thing), as did Accounts
payable, but you're right, it is due mostly to a declining revenue base, which
comes as no surprise. EME is, after all, in a cyclical business and revenues
peaked in 2008.

Anyway, @ roughly $23/shr, using @68M shares (ttm) and FCF (ttm) of $249 (lower
than FY 2009), I get a FCF Yield of 15.9%.

249/(68 x 23) = 249/1564 = 0.159

If I'm wrong, I'm certainly anxious to know how, especially if I'm way off with
this calculation. I'm self-taught in accounting; read several books, but never
took a course. Might be time.

A FCF yield of 15% is normally in my buying range, but, with a rather cyclical
stock, I sure would like some sign that the economy isn't going to swoon again.

re EME -your calculation is correct but you are drawing the wrong conclusions
from it, imo.

By adding the changes in working capital to the FCF, you are adding a one-off
factor and include this in yoru yield calculation. Now let's just play this
through and assume that EME's business recovers and revenues are up 20% in
Y2011 and receivables likewise. Now you need to subtract 230M$ (roughly) from
your FCF yield - which is then probably about 50-100M$, not more. So now you
are selling your shares to to lack of FCF?

I will gladly buy them for 20$ in this situation. This is generous because my
FCF will be very low (5-7%), right?

The Fed chairman expressed general contentment with the financial reform
legislation moving though Congress, calling it a "pretty sensible approach."

Congressional leaders are picking select groups of members to participate in
efforts to reconcile the financial-industry regulation bills approved by the
House and Senate.

The group is hoping to formally begin working out differences between the two
bills during the week of June 14 and finish before July 4th.

Noting that there were a "lot of pieces" to the measures, Bernanke said there
were some things he would change, but went on to say that the legislation
contain measures aimed at controlling the "too-big-to fail" issue.

This is the "acid test" for any reform, he said.

The House and Senate bills both create a system to dismantle a failing
Lehman-like mega-bank so that its collapse doesn't unsettle the markets. Even
though each chamber covers the costs of such a mechanism differently, both have
the same principle: empowering bank regulators to allocate funds to the
counterparties of the collapsing institution so that they don't fail as well.

I've read about the work of Ernst and Fotta, who came up with something called
'Dual Cash Flow'. Although I haven't been able to find the specifics of their
method anywhere, from other sources I have been able to infer that they take a
standard calculation of FCF (like mine), then subtract out what they call
'Balance Sheet Cash Flow' (changes in working capital, etc.). The result is
'Dual Cash Flow', which is probably a lot like your calculation, at least in
spirit and/or intent.

Anyway, my method makes for a good way to screen for stocks, but screening is
only the beginning of the process. I'm struggling with this stuff, but
sometimes the struggle is worth it. I would appreciate someone pointing me to a

Re: VNDA liability balance sheet entries

Below is what the 10Q says about the large entry on the liability side
("deferred revenue"). Here is a short version, hopefully accurate. They got
$200m for license of Fanapt in US and Canada for life of patent. Now they are
amortizing it, meaning that every year they reduce the liability and show
corresponding income. Cash flow wise it is neutral. If it was Enron accounting
they would just have shown it all as profit when received.

They still have possible royalty sale to Europe and Asia for Fanapt.

there is also an entry for deferred rent. I suppose that means that their lease
has a low rent rate at the beginning and higher later, but that for accounting
purposes they consider rent ratable, and so build up this entry. This does
indicate there will be higher cash expense in the future.

Everyone has different perceptions of risk and value. I bought a small position
in the company, but my recommendation, unlike the tout sheets sold at
racetracks, has no warranty.

_________________________

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenues are derived primarily from the amended and restated
sublicense agreement with Novartis and include an up-front payment, product
sales and future milestone and royalty payments. Revenue is considered both
realizable and earned when each one of the following four conditions is met:
(1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the arrangement fee is
fixed or determinable, (3) delivery or performance has occurred and (4)
collectability is reasonably assured. Pursuant to the amended and restated
sublicense agreement, Novartis has the right to commercialize and develop
Fanapt tm in the U.S. and Canada. Under the amended and restated sublicense
agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $200.0 million in
December of 2009. Pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement,
the Company and Novartis established a Joint Steering Committee (JSC) following
the effective date of the amended and restated sublicense agreement. The
Company expects to have an active role on the JSC and concluded that the JSC
constitutes a deliverable under the amended and restated sublicense agreement
and that revenue related to the upfront payment will be recognized ratably over
the term of the JSC; however, the delivery or performance has no term as the
exact length of the JSC is undefined. As a result, the Company deems the
performance period of the JSC to be the life of the U.S. patent of Fanapt tm ,
which the Company expects to last until May 15, 2017. This includes the
Hatch-Waxman extension that provides patent protection for drug compounds for a
period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in development and a
six-month pediatric term extension. This term is the Company’s best estimate of
the life of the patent. Revenue will be recognized ratably from the date the
amended and restated sublicense agreement became effective (November 27, 2009)
through the expected life of the U.S. patent for Fanapt tm (May 15, 2017).
Revenue related to product sales is recognized upon delivery to Novartis. The
Company recognizes revenue from Fanapt tm royalties and commercial and
development milestones from Novartis when realizable and earned.

Pete, yes the changes in the working capital should be taken out of the FCF
calculation.

To be fair, i do not use FCF as much as I used to. i sort of became a FCF guru
about 8 years ago but realized that a lot of stocks where management does not
emphasize FCF too much tend to do very well. it is simply a matter of capital
allocation - if management spends it's Dollars well, then re-investment will
make the company valuable. Emphasize into FCF will get you in a lot of value
traps and shrinking business.

FCF yield does have some value for steady business (Food, media) and the lack
there off can expose poor capital allocators (my favorite name here used to be
CHK in the E&P business).

the other thing - always take it with a grain of salt if the FCF yield is
larger than the earning yield. This can happen for a short time (if the company
has excess assets that it "burns off" via depreciation) or due to changes in
working capital but it is almost never sustainable.

Going back tot he EMCOR example - there is nothing worth with a business that
can grow 20% and still have a little FCF left - I'd rather have that than a
business that shrinks 20% and has am extremely high (but unsustainable) FCF
yield.

Hi rlee -

RE: Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (NYSE: MPW)

Not too sure on the dividend. A lot depends on the additions of new properties
they may do this year from the funds they obtained through a secondary ($591
Million issued at $9.50/share). The prospectus stated that any purchase of new
properties would be additive to earnings.

There is also the possibility of a loan default (I believe around $23Million)
which if goes unpaid to the REIT, they may have to write it down which would
reduce available cash for distribution.

I am assuming the stock has sold off with the rest of the market. There is
really no abnormal volume to the downside. The sell off could be due to the end
of the lock up period on the secondary and those that bought shares at
$9.50/share are bailing out.

I have not followed the stock long enough to know how their FCF varies from
year to year and quarter to quarter. They do have small overall debt when
compared to their peers which is one of the reasons I started a position.

Hi Paul -

EONGY or any other European stock denominated in Euros.

Is this a falling Euro play? I am not too sure how this plays out with a
foreign ADR? As the Euro drops in value vs the $US, will the ADR fall in price
too? Do I use my valuable $US to buy weak Euro denominated companies? I own
TESCO PLC (a sponsored ADR - TSCDY.pk) which is down 15% in the last 45 days. I
thought it was off due to the general market sell off but could the fall be due
to the weak EURO?

If I believe the Euro goes to parity with the $US, will a company like TESCO
denominated in Euros fall another 20% (1 $US=$1.19 EURO
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=EURUSD=X&t=5d&l=on&z=m&q=l&c= ).

If this is true, then it might be a good strategy to load up on foreign ADR's

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/C-O-R-R-E-C-T-I-prnews-3632517813.html?x=0&.v=94

 "The acquisition will result in additional annual production capacity of 3,000
tons of bromine and 100,000 tons of crude salt, expanding the consolidated
annual production capacity of SCHC to 46,300 tons of bromine and 550,000 tons
of crude salt. We expect the additional production of bromine and crude salt
from these new assets to add approximately $1.0 million in incremental net
income in fiscal 2010 based on current market prices and five months of
effective production," stated Xiaobin Liu, Chief Executive Officer of Gulf
Resources.

Consideration for the asset purchase includes $13.2 million in cash and the
issuance of shares of 70,650 shares of common stock at a price of $9.859 per
share, bringing the total consideration to $13.9 million .

1M$ in 5 month makes 2.4M$ in Bromide revenues, their income from operations
from the Bromide business was 45% of revenues=1.08M$x0.6 (40% TAX) =0.65M$ post
tax earnings for a 13.9M$ investment.

OK these are my own numbers but isn't it telling that management does not say
anything about the earning impact of this acquisition. Feel free to correct me
if am wrong, but unless I am wrong by a lot this is a very bad deal - leaving
three bad options - either management translates "shareholder" as "bagholder"

it typically cancels insurance contracts, allowing the hospital to collect
steeply higher reimbursements. It has suspended services — such as chemotherapy
treatments, mental health care and birthing centers — that patients need but
aren't lucrative.... On four occasions since 2002, inspectors have found that
Prime Healthcare facilities failed to meet minimum federal safety standards,
placing their Medicare funding at risk."[3]

In 2005, two former nurses at Desert Valley Hospital won a lawsuit in which
they claimed they were improperly fired after they accused hospital management
of providing inadequate care to save money and Reddy of repeatedly reporting to
work while under the influence of alcohol. In February 1999, Reddy was arrested
for allegedly attacking Dr. Harry Lifschutz at Desert Valley Medical Group.
Reddy jumped over a desk in the doctor's waiting room and allegedly attempted
to choke him and take a laptop from Lifschutz's office. [4]"

Hi Peter -

RE: MPW & Prime Healthcare

Based on a limited Google search, Prime seems like an aggressive fast growing
Health Management company. They have grown from acquiring one hospital in 2004
to owning and operating 13 hospitals and a medical group as of November, 2009.

I saw that a recent lawsuit was settled (out of court) regarding some of their
"alleged" billing practices. The California Department of Managed Health Care,
which oversees HMOs, filed a lawsuit against Prime Healthcare in 2008, after
receiving complaints from patients and providers over bills for emergency
services.

It appears that Prime was just trying to recover their costs for services
performed in their emergency rooms and billed the users the additional fees not
paid by the HMO and or those w/o health insurance.

Prime Healthcare settles Calif. lawsuit
http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20100525/NEWS/305259978#
"...Prime Healthcare said in a statement that although it believes it would
have ultimately won the case at trial, it decided to settle to avoid further
costs. Prime Healthcare “looks forward to working with the department to ensure
that HMOS live up to their legal obligations,” according to the statement...."

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Two of their 13 hospitals are ranked in the Top 100 facilities for 2009.
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/two-of-prime-healthcares-hospitals-are-named-t
p-100-hospitals-by-thomson-reuters-for-2009-2010-04-03
April 3, 2010
Two of Prime Healthcare's Hospitals are Named Top 100 Hospitals by Thomson
Reuters for 2009
"...Thomson Reuters announced today that Desert Valley Hospital and Montclair
Hospital Medical Center are among the winners of its prestigious Top 100
Hospitals(R) in the Nation award...."

Therefore, management must be doing something right specifically at Desert
Valley (since the incident in 2005 that you referenced) to receive these awards
in 2009.

You do point out an "alleged" character flaw (reporting to work while under the
influence of alcohol) of Reddy the CEO of Prime Healthcare. But realize that
this allegation is by two former nurses during litigation. Reddy has an
impressive resume and holds a MBA & MHA. Perhaps his current management style
brings with him some of his early Indian culture & background.

38% of MPW's revenues coming from Prime Healthcare is not a big concern to me.
However, I would like to see the proceeds from the secondary offering be placed
with other health management operators.

I think this points out how inefficient some of our smaller hospitals are (even
many of the midsized hospital groups). Companies such as Prime Healthcare are
tasked to manage the transition of inefficient community hospitals into
efficient (including using the latest electronic medical record systems)
profitable organizations. MPW and their shareholders benefit from successful
health management operators. You need an aggressive management team so you are
assured you generate your FCF from the facility fees.

You do raise a possible "red flag" for Prime Healthcare. Their financial
soundness is relevant to MPW. However, I am not too concerned with this one
operator but it is worth making a note to any future discussion in MPW's 8K or
10K.

Thanks for the heads up.

First of all, they changed the press release to read "incremental net income"
and not "revenue" (and you quoted the changed release!!!), so your calculations
are no longer valid. With the change, they are getting $2.4M income for $13.9M
purchase price = 17% earnings yield, which is great. Unbelievable but great. :)

Even if we went with original wording and your calculations, they would be
buying 4.5% earnings yield on purchase price, which is not great, but also not
horrible. There are tons of businesses trading and acquired at worse earnings
yield. So I am not sure why the outrage?

Brean Murray notes that GFRE announced the signing of an agreement to acquire
manufacturing assets involved in bromine and crude salt production from two
individual residents of the People's Republic of China for a total
consideration of $13.9 mln, or at less than 6x the expected full-year earnings
contribution. Firm expects this acquisition to add approximately $3.6 mln to
incremental rev and $1 mln to incremental net income in 2010, and approximately
$8.7 mln to incremental rev and at least $2.44 mln to incremental net income in
2011, applying current market prices for bromine and crude salt and assuming
~28% net margin and ~70% utilization for both 2010 and 2011, which they view
reasonable relative to historical levels.

These big integrated oils seem to move together with the price of oil. If BP
does eliminate the dividend, then I say why not just buy one of the others that
pays a dividend vs. BP.

And if BP is in litigation for years and which, if it were like the cigarette
companies, the stock might fluctuate on litigation rumors, progress, outcomes,
appeals, etc. So in addition to oil price volatility, there's another added
layer of volatility and/or risk for BP.

Maybe a case can be made for a paired trade--- buying XOM or Shell or Total or
Oxy or something, and shorting BP.

This seemed to get it started this morning:

Analyst sees BP dividend cut as 50% likely
7:57a ET June 9, 2010 (MarketWatch)
NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Societe Generale analysts Evgeny Solovyov and Aymeric
de-Villaret said in a note to clients on Wednesday they see a 50% probability
that BP Plc will skip its upcoming quarterly dividend, which will be the
subject of a directors meeting by the embattled oil giant on July 27. "This is
no longer a question of the strength of its balance sheet (which we think is
strong enough) but of whether BP will be able to take the situation under
sufficient control by the time it has to decide on the dividend...to come up
with a story palatable for U.S. politicians and public opinion," the analysts
said. "BP has been recovering an average of 11,000 barrels a day in the past
few days and it expects to increase the rate further. There is a reasonable
chance therefore the mood will change by late July."

I don't pretend to know if they will cut or not. Maybe the safest play would be
to buy IF they cut, thinking that they bowed to pressure and will hike it back
up when the heat dies down. A 50% cut would give a 5.6+ yield, on todays close,
to watch it play out.

From:puborectalis
- Mexico’s share of North American auto production may rise at a quicker pace
as General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Group LLC seek out workers
making less than 10 percent of what their U.S. counterparts earn.

The lower labor costs may help the U.S. companies build smaller cars profitably
amid demand for fuel-efficient vehicles in the wake of last year’s recession.
Mexico’s gains will come at the expense of workers in the U.S. and Canada, said
Dennis DesRosiers, president of DesRosiers Automotive Consulting Inc.

“There is going to be more capacity put into North America and Mexico is going
to get more than its fair share,” DesRosiers said from Richmond Hill, Ontario.

Moves to Mexico may speed up when Chrysler and GM reduce some of the political
pressure they face by paying back government bailout money, said Michael
Robinet, vice president of global forecasting for CSM Worldwide in Northville,
Michigan. The U.S. government has distributed about $80 billion in the Auto
Industry Financing Program to support the industry.

DesRosiers says Mexico’s share of North American auto production will rise to
19 percent over the next decade from an average 12 percent in 2000 to 2009.
Over the same period, the U.S. will lose 7 percentage points to 65 percent of
the market and Canada’s share will hold at 16 percent, he said.

Average Wages

GM workers in Mexico earn wages and benefits of 340 pesos a day ($26.40) on
average, or less than $4 an hour, said Tereso Medina, head of the union for
GM’s 5,000 workers in Saltillo, a city that makes one in four Mexican autos.
Ford workers in the U.S. earn about $55 an hour with benefits, compared with
$50 an hour for Toyota Motor Corp.’s U.S. workers, Lewis Booth, Ford’s chief
financial officer, said on a Jan. 28 conference call.

Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said U.S. automakers that
received government assistance should work to preserve U.S. jobs.

“I understand the economic argument for the off-shoring of production, but I
think the practice is reprehensible,” Dingell said in an e-mail. “U.S.
automakers have benefitted greatly from federal largesse and should feel
morally compelled to retain and create as many domestic jobs as possible.”

In addition to labor costs, automakers are attracted to Mexico because of the
North American Free Trade Agreement and the country’s proximity to the U.S.,
Robinet said. Other benefits include Mexico’s more than 30 free-trade accords
with European Union members, Japan, Colombia and other countries, and quality
that matches the U.S. and Canada, he said.

Union Concessions

U.S. and Canadian unions have made concessions to bring costs at older
factories in line with Toyota’s and Honda Motor Co.’s U.S. plants. Ron
Gettelfinger, the outgoing United Auto Workers president, oversaw an agreement
to allow lower wages for new hires.

Even with the UAW concessions, Mexico remains attractive, Medina said.

“For the new strategies of the automobile industry, this region should
benefit,” Medina said in an interview.

Christine Moroski, a UAW spokeswoman, declined to comment.

Mexico stands to benefit from more stringent U.S. fuel- efficiency requirements
because it’s more profitable to make small cars where labor costs are lower,
Robinet said.

Chrysler announced in February it’s spending $550 million to retool its factory
in Toluca to assemble the Fiat 500 model.

Last month, Ford reopened an assembly plant in Cuautitlan to build 2011 Fiesta
cars. The factory will generate 2,000 jobs and is part of $3 billion in
investments announced since 2008. In the U.S., Ford has closed four assembly
plants since 2006 and plans to close four more facilities by the end of 2011.

Ford’s Investment

Mexico was responsible for 14.2 percent of Ford’s U.S.- Mexican car production
last year, and 16 percent in 2008, compared with 11.8 percent in 2006,
according to company data.

For every dollar Ford invested in Mexico during the past five years, the
company spent $7 in the U.S., said James Tetreault, vice president for North
American manufacturing. Ford’s two Mexican assembly plants have operated for
more than 30 years, he said.

“In North America, it’s all about utilizing our existing footprint,” Tetreault
said in a phone interview from Dearborn, Michigan. “It’s not like we’re
building greenfield plants and moving production to Mexico.”

Ford fell 17 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $11.05 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 11 percent this year.

U.S. car and light truck production declined every year to 8.45 million in 2008
from 11.5 million in 2005, according to Ward’s Automotive Yearbook. In Mexico,
output rose every year to 2.08 million in 2008 from 1.61 million in 2005, the
data show.

Auto Production

Production fell in both countries last year, by 28 percent to 1.5 million units
in Mexico and 34 percent to 5.56 million in the U.S., according to Ward’s.

This year, U.S. production in April rose 40 percent from a year earlier to an
annualized rate of 7.05 million vehicles. Mexico’s output jumped 77 percent and
is on pace to top 2008, according to the Mexican Automobile Industry
Association.

GM has announced investments of $3.67 billion in Mexico since November 2007,
including a new assembly plant in San Luis Potosi, said Mauricio Kuri, a
company spokesman in Mexico City.

The company has closed five U.S.-based assembly plants and put three more on
standby since June 2005, Tom Wilkinson, a GM spokesman, said in an e-mail.

A significant portion of Chrysler’s production of the Fiat 500 will be sold in
South America, said Jodi Tinson, a spokeswoman.

“Mexico is in an ideal position as a bridge between Nafta and Latin America
because of the country’s free-trade agreements with its neighbors to both the
north and south,” Tinson said in the e-mailed response to questions.

South Jersey Industries, Inc. C(NYSE: SJI)
Northwest Natural Gas Company C(NYSE: NWN)
Atmos Energy Corporation Common(NYSE: ATO)
Piedmont Natural Gas Company, I(NYSE: PNY)

Stocks mentioned by Credit Suisse in 6/8/2010 Barron's:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NJR,SJI,NWN,ATO,PNY&d=s

A brief review of the companies show that all have an excellent dividend
payment history. Over a 10 year review, each have raised their dividend
annually, have been profitable and have performed better (on average more than
25%) than the Dow Jones Utility Average EXCEPT ATO.

http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=

ato+pny;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on

Currently of the group, ATO has the lowest PE and the highest dividend yield. I
am tempted to build up my position in ATO, since it is the under performer of
the group and could have the most to gain from a positive market sector rise in
the NG business.

I am not sure if during the prior 10 years that the relative performance of
each company in the group reflects their specific "contribution from
assets-optimization activities" as the author suggests in the article. It's
possible that there could be some competitive advantage to some of the
companies in the types and configuration of their NG delivery and storage
systems, but I suspect it is more as a result of their regional location and
the make up of their customer base (retail vs wholesale and density- # of
customers per distribution mile).

It looks like that the market has already discounted the long term price of the
companies for the difference made up in their customer base and regional growth
potential. Looking forward another 10 years, I would speculate that ATO might
have more to grow than the others for the mere fact that they were the under
performer in the previous 10 years.

I do think the NG sector should benefit from the GOM oil spill disaster and the
author's overall conclusion is right on. I am bullish on the NG Energy Service
Business segments that each of these companies operate and still see it as an
area to deploy new funds.

Both Dominion Resources, Inc. Common(NYSE: D) and Nicor, Inc. Common Stock
(NYSE: GAS) might be other companies to look at as investments with this theme.

I have to like the utility sector. Odd to me how this is, even if my feeling
for many, many years is that it's for widows and geezers, and now I'm one
(geezer that is).

It seems everyone and every fund has the S&P as a bogey. Even many times when
the comparison isn't quite apples-to-apples, e.g. a small cap fund which tells
you that it beats the S&P index. Anyway, the mantra is "I beat the S&P", "We
beat the S&P" (S&P 500 usually being referred to, I guess.) People are proud to
beat the S&P!

Nobody who's a market player - or not many - ever says or say, "We beat the DJ
Utility index" (or an S&P Utility index). Beating a utility index? It's like
beating widows& orphans. Nobody's proud of that. And furthermore, anybody who's
anybody ought to be able to beat a utility index, for crying out loud -g-.

Except for one thing: When I looked at the DJ utility index and compared it to
the S&P index over the past ten years, the utility index beat the S&P. (And
that's not even considering the higher dividend yield of the utilities.) Maybe
5-10 years is too short a time period: over longer times, the S&P seems to win.
And maybe going forward, the utilities won't do as well as the S&P components.
It just appears to me though, that I and others don't seem to have given
utilities the respect for the performance that they've had over the past few
years.

I prefer gas utilities over electric utilities, although I have positions in

Hi Grommit -

RE: CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP)

CenterPoint Energy to offer 22 million shares
CenterPoint energy offers 22 million shares at $12.90 each, expects to raise up
to $314.6M
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/CenterPoint-Energy-to-offer-apf-4057253401.html?x
0&.v=1

The company is going to do a 22 million secondary offering. The company said
Wednesday it would price each share at $12.90/share. 10x the average volume
today and I suspect that much of the trading is due to the secondary
announcement price and arbitrage speculation.

I sold some August $12.5 covered calls on the position I bought 5/20/2009 at
$10.00/share. I think there will be some arbitrage play as the underwriters
have an option to buy more shares at the offering price (up to 30 days after
the issue date). I am betting that when the flood of shares hit the market, the
stock could trade below the secondary offering price of $12.90/share. My
strategy will be to double up on my position and have 1/2 of my position called
away in August. Hopefully, I can also collect the August dividend.

I am not too sure of the dilution to earnings or if the dividend will be cut as
a result of the 22 million share offering. It only represent a 10% increase in
the outstanding shares. The PE continue to be excellent around 10, dividend
payout ratio at 69% well in the good range and a 5.8% dividend yield.

I like the CERC Corp business.

CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp. and, together with its
subsidiaries, CERC),is the unregulated component of their business. This
division owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in six states.
Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. own interstate natural gas pipelines and gas
gathering systems and provide various ancillary services. A wholly owned
subsidiary of CERC Corp. offers variable and fixed-price physical natural gas
supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas
utilities.

CNP should be a good long term hold with growth from their CenterPoint Energy
Resources Corp. This is one I plan to accumulate over the long run.

in this one ("full" which I define here as: as much as I will bet on this penny

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NGLPF.OB

I had believed that since there's a push by the gov't for renewable and
therefore by electric utilities to acquire energy from renewable, that this
company supplying energy to electric utilities from geothermal ought to be
profitable. The company acquired sites, built a plant and got government
funding, and they have contracts to sell their generated energy. And the plant
is producing. More sites and more plants are planned.
I had figured why build a plant if the energy to be produced and contracted for
didn't pencil out to be profitable? My error apparently: So far, no bottom-line
profits in sight, and the stock is a loser for me.

desert. The company must still fulfill U.S.Dept of Energy conditions before
tapping the loan for its $120 mil Neal Hot Springs project in Malheur County,
90 mi west of Boise, ID. The loan, worth up to $102.2 mil would come from the
Treasury Dept and would have a lower interest rate than if sought from private
lenders. The Oregon project is due to be completed in 2012. Once completed, the
company is counting on a separate, $34 mil federal tax rebate - money that's
part of the 2009 federal stimulus act meant to help spur investment in
renewable energy - to help pay down the federal loan as well as pay off some
private investors.

Hi Paul -

RE: Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX)

This was one I followed in the early 90's and owned it for a few years. I never
really looked at it again but now that the health care legislation is a done
deal, this may be one worth building a position in.

What really attracts me to this stock now is their LT debt to earnings payoff
metric. My new Buffet measure is to identify companies with low lt debt
relative to annual earnings: Total lt debt s/b covered by 3 (or 4) years of
annual earnings or less. Based on the YAHOO numbers BDX annual earnings to Long
Term debt coverage is 1.39. In other words, 1.4 years worth of earnings would
pay off their total long term debt. It far exceeds this basic test providing a
high level of safety for the conservative investor.

I would like to pick this up at a PE of 11 or lower but it needs to fall back
to $61.00/share which is another 11% sell off. Not too sure that will happen,
but I will put it on my watch list as this could be a good steady grower once
the economy gets going again.

everybody's attitude toward BP has changed now that oil is washing up on the
florida coast. Clearly neither the government nor BP has been up front with the
public as to how much oil has been leaking. weeks ago when they said it was
1000-5000 industry experts thought that was impossibly low. now we are seeing
how bad it really is and now we can have an investigation as to why this wasnt

The government can always win if they try hard enough. They may just choose
that it's too hard of a fish to catch and go somewhere else but if they choose
to go after GS with all their might, they will win, imo.

Just look what they do with BP, which is not even an US company. They try to
retroactively impose laws that would lead to higher liabilities, they try to
muddle with BP dividend which surely isn't their business at all, do a
moratorium that put's workers out of job and have BP pay for it and such.
Problem with BP is that it's an easy target and they hope to look good to some
voters with their meddling. If they put the same energy to dig a hole for GS,
they are toast, imo.

Previously, I owned and sold ORA. They really are the 800lb gorilla in the
sector. I recently listened to their investor day presentation. it is several
hours long, so if you are interested be sure to pop some popcorn.

http://www.ormat.com/investor-relations/webcast-and-presentation

If you're interested in geothermal, it's a must-listen as there is a wonderful
presentation by one of their geologists on how the industry has changed the
last couple of years. Airborne and satellite surveying has shortened the
discovery process.

That said, I haven't repurchased the stock as it takes a great deal of money to
lease, drill and build a site. The bottom line is that the natural gas price
prevents most alt. energy programs from being extremely profitable. Just my
opinion, but I just can't buy a utility at 22 times earnings when you can
currently buy utilities at ten times earnings that pay a dividend.

Regardless, the science behind the process is fascinating.

I dont agree. I dont think bp is such an easy target and i dont think GS is
either. as I said before, A logical extension of the case against GS, is that
if a dealer thinks that an investment is poor it has to warn the the
prospective purchaser of its opinion or perhaps of other opinions that its
familiar with. By extension I could infer that no dealers should sell US govt
bonds if it believes inflation is headed up and that US credit rating will
deteriorate over time unless it states that to prospective buyers up front. The
whole thing is ridiculous.

As far a BP goes, I think its not unlikely that the US sub of BP files for
bankruptcy. What does Obama do then? He can pass all the retroactive laws he
wants. On top of that who will want to drill in the gulf after that? There will
be a battle royale over exactly what BP is liable for anyway My guess is that
BP will still be a company after OBama finished his term as president.
As you may or may not be aware of there is still extensive litigation going on
over 9-11. That was almost 9 years ago. I think the litigation over this oil
spill will be at least 18 years.

re BP, GS - I agree on BP, sort of. i raised the possibility that BP may

is a possibility and would entail approx. 35% of BP's assets. Painful for BP
for sure but sometimes one needs to chop and arm and a leg off to let the body

I don't want to overplay the GS and BP analogy but my point is that it's very

Hi Spekulatius

RE: LIFE, BDX, VAR & Applied Bio Systems

In the late 80's I invested in a theme of companies that designed, built,
serviced and supplied the biotech industry test equipment and consumables for
genetic research. One of the companies I owned was Applied Bio Systems (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_Biosystems )which was later acquired by
Perkin Elmer then merged with Invitrogen to create a global biotech company
called Life Technologies (Life Technologies Corporation (LIFE). What attracted
me to this sector was the huge cash flow generated from the consumable reagents
sold that were use in their DNA sequencing equipment.

Both Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR) (formerly known as Varian Associates,
Inc.) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX) were companies I followed. When
my Applied Bio Systems was bought out, I stopped following the group and moved
on to other investment themes.

It's interesting to note that the survivors VAR & BDX have little debt,
continue to generate excellent cash flows and have grown to be global
companies. Many of the companies like (Life Technologies Corporation (LIFE)
carry a lot of goodwill on their books representing the collection of companies
acquired over this period. They also have accumulated lots of debt too. In the
case of LIFE they have more than 8x the debt load relative to their annual
revenues than BDX.

I wonder if it time to search out the past legacy innovators that have remained
independent, have grown and developed their business and are ripe "value buys"
that have little debt. The management style for these types of companies show
that they are survivors, are not interested in being acquired, are in the
business for the long hall and deliver growth and shareholder value year after
year.

I am more convinced now that BDX is one of these companies as I reflect back on
my basket of bio-tech stocks that I followed. I think I will investigate
further and go "Back To The Future" to see if any other legacy survivors pop up
from my old lists.

re BDX - nice writeup. Last year in the dark days, I was looking into business
that would survive an economic collapse. I cam up with medical consumables
because I thought that those would not be affected much even if a rigirous
overhaul in the healthcare were attemtped in the US. I cam up with COV but also
owned some BDX which I sold later.

SO I came to BDX from another but just as valid angle. From my limited
experience, BDX products always had a stellar quality reputation. Valuation is
OK but not great. There is probably some near term pressure on profits from the
higher US$. I tempted but have not starte a position yet, due to cash
availability and a valuation that is somewhat less compelling than some other
opportunities. but generally speaking, I really like BDX here.

I bought an exploratory position in AMGN, but after more research I am not sure

not cover the issue (IMHO) that they have increasing biogeneric competition and
a number of patent expirations in their largest selling drugs in 2010-2015 time
frame. IMHO, GILD is more attractive than AMGN.

CF is another one where I am not sure that the position is warranted at the
current price. I may just hold my current stake and reevaluate when it is
clearer how their Terra acquisition integration proceeds.

drastically alter the economy of the historically impoverished Central Asian
nation, according to a report Sunday. The deposits include "huge veins" of
iron, copper, cobalt and gold, the New York Times reported, citing U.S.

material for batteries used in autos and high-tech devices -- that could turn
Afghanistan into the "Saudi Arabia of lithium," according to a Pentagon memo

I added another gold stock today which i already own via AAB.to.

This is probably under the realm of too good to be true- The company has mines
in aust. that they bought out of receivership for a pittance. Now they are
producing. They believe that they can produce 100,000 ounces this year and
200,000 ounces next year and increase their proven and indicated resource from
$5 million to $10 million. According to them it costs them $6 to find an ounce
of gold, and about $6-700 to pull it out of the ground. I would say it falls
into the category of a cheap option on the price of gold. They recently did an
offering of around $20 million canadian at i think $1.30. Usually these deal
come with options attached. this didnt. Its called crocodile gold. crk.to. If
they can produce 200,000 ounces its a value stock. otherwise I dont think so
unless gold keeps surging.

The price action on GS is beginning to remind me of the price action on that
fabulous chip company controlled by the potato farmer that was touted by Vinik
a decade ago. Everyday it would be up in the morning and down by the close.
That one ended badly for me.

Crocodile Gold.

218.6M shares fully diluted @ C$1.22 = $266M market cap (fully diluted)

100,000 oz. production outlooked in 2010. Cost per oz ~$700/oz., so profit
around $550/oz. = $55M. Would this be pre-tax? We don't know how onerous the
Australian proposed mining tax will be when finally implemented. P/e at best
seems to be $266/55 = 4.8.

If 2011 production reaches outlooked/hoped-for 200,000 oz/day and gold price is
as now, then I agree stock at current price would be pretty cheap (p/e under 3,
assuming Australian tax is reasonably low).

increases relative to the austrailian their profit margin will improve. its
just another minor postion in a gold miner for me. but at least its one that is
