Dave and all - i do not know why people are choosing EXPE over Travelocity. I
believe that EXPE has a better brand awareness and a slightly better reach
(more hotels, more packages) although I think that Travelocity has almost
caught up with EXPE.

Both offer almost identical prices to the customers as far as i can tell. I
have been Travelocity user for airfaire for years but I think for Hotels EXPE
has an edge. However what i do know is that EXPE margins are way better than
Orbitz an Travelocity's, possible because they leverage their cost over a
larger revenue base. The combination of market share/cost advantage and brand
awareness gives tham a small moat, IMO.

Travelocity is part of TSG (most of the revenue and earnings come from Sabre)
and Orbitz of CD, so EXPE is the only pure play out there.

Dave, we all have our favorite books.

I like "A Thousand Miles from Wall Street" by Tony Gray,
"Do You Want to Make Money or Would You Rather Fool Around?" by John Spooner.
All the Train books, e.g. "The Craft of Investing", "The Midas Touch", "The New
Money Masters"

I don't have too many Buffett books. Lot of rehash by authors, seems to me. I
have Graham books and papers (lecture notes) of course.

And I've got a good bunch from previous generations, a favorite being "48 Years
in the Stock Market" by Laurence Jarvinen, pub. 1970. (He got out of the market
in early 1929, and reinvested over next decades.)
"Finding Undervalued Stocks", pub. in '60's
Loeb's "The Battle for Investment Survival", '52 edition.
I have ALL of Phil Fisher's books. Of course, "Super Stocks" by his son.
Occasionally I'll look at "100 to 1 in the Stock Market" by Phelps.

For psychology, I like Pring's "Investment Psychology Explained". For spending
money, I have Giles' "Moneylove". For living life for us older guys, I have
"The 'rest of your life' is the Best of Your Life, by movie producer David
Brown.

I like Greenblatt's "You Can be a Stock Market Genius", but I've not read nor
do I own his latest 'magic investing' book.

I have lots more investment books stored in my garage.

The most recent used book I bought was Jim Paul's "What I Learned Losing a
Million Dollars". The latest investment new book I bought (last month) was
Mergent's "Dividend Achievers, Winter 2006".

Paul,

You and I have some overlap especially with John Train, Fisher (both Father &

If you are really interested in Investment Psychology, I would strongly urge
you to read Dreman and, if you can find a copy, read "Psychology and the Stock
Market" by Dreman. I believe it was published in 77/78, but it is truly an
interesting book. Dreman describes several asset bubbles from a historical
context. For example, I learned about a Real Estate Bubble in Florida back in
the mid 20s. Can you believe people were actually buying swampland?

Greenblatt's, "You Can Be a Stock Market Genus" is a great book. You have to
read it b/c its message can never be "arbitraged" away.

As for my current reading, I'm no longer focusing on "investing" per se, but
more on general theories as to how things work.

grab share from offline agents. I think in expedia you have a leader that
generates free cash flow, earns a high return on equity, sells at a reasonable
price/fcf multiple, and is positioned well in a dynamic, growing market. There
is net cash on the balance sheet, and Liberty Media has expressed an interest

And, we have.

EKS, I used to have a link to a source of BDI day rates for dry goods shippers,
but can't seem to find it. Have rates been forecasted to climb again?

It seems that with the exception of TOPT, all of the shippers and tankers I've
put in a watch list are in a death spiral. I am down about 10% on a very small
position in EXM but am reluctant to add until I see some kind of catalyst.

Once day rates start to climb again I think many of these stocks will rise
nicely and I will entertain holding a basket of them.

In January the cost of shipping commodities such as iron ore and coal fell to
the lowest in more than five months. Other than China and their need for raw
materials, what's the catalyst for these stocks to rise? Yes, globalization is
being argued by the shippers as a so-called paradigm shift. They point out iron
ore imports into China have gone up 185% since 2001 (from 90 million tons to
260 million tons in 2005). They argue that China's move to an industrialized
economy will take 30 years, similar to that by Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and
they need commodities shipped to them.

Fine and dandy, so why are all the stocks looking like they caught the bird
flu?

Meanwhile, rail stocks have been the place to be, not shippers. So where is the
recovery in shippers going to come from? steel? grains? coal? Iron ore seems to
be the only one with any kind of growth, and that's only 6.3%

EXM has expanded its fleet, expanding capacity by 180%; reduced its fleet age
(from 25 to 12.9!) and is now below industry average 16; has a trailing PE of
2.83 (!), its lowest ever; gotten listed on the NYSE to improve liquidity and
prestige; has done some good things in managing it fleet; and has competitive
costs. In Q4 they announced 122% growth in revenue and 42$ growth in net
income. Yet the stock looks radioactive.

What are we missing? Or are we simply early?

Hi with a K - I have seen no forecast for rates to rise but you really can not
forecast this with any accuracy. I am looking at the long term trend with this
investment and trying to accumulate a position at some reasonable "value"
price.

I am learning fast that this is a sector that is very price sensitive to the
day rates and if your ships do not have a lot of long term leases it can be a
wild ride. I hope it will work the same way when day rates move higher. DRYS
only has about 40% of their ships locked in with long term contracts 24 months
or more. Therefore they are subject to these wild swings in price as day rates
change.

The only positive thing is you do receive a pretty good dividend.

I like your idea of buying a basket of these companies to help diversify
specific company risk. EXM looks interesting and may have good value too.

At least we are buying at the lows w/ PE's below 3. It's hard to know when they
will turn the corner but it will eventually happen as long as they have enough
cash to stay in operation. DRYS new credit facility will make this happen.

A couple of links for rates and news: http://www.dryships.com/
http://www.tankerworld.com/

Tanker rates are expected to fall further this summer with more supply of ships
arriving. Newbuilds have been driving dayrates down. Older ships haven't been
scrapped due to the high dayrates in the past. This may start to change with
depressed rates sometime this year. I have been playing around with shippers
for 7-8 years with good results. The time to buy is when everyone is really
depressed on the industry and then be very patient. The stocks are very
volatile and watching them day to day can cause a lot of heartaches. I
currently hold EGLE since they have around 75% of their fleet locked in for
this year. EGLE should be able to pay around $2 in distributions this year. I
am watching several others for entry points to ride out the next up cycle.

remember that just didn't do anything (these are usually extremely volatile). I
sold and well, you know the rest of the story. I haven't followed OMM since

Right now, I'm watching DRYS, EGLE, FRO, GMR, QMAR and TOPT. QMAR and DRYS are
probably at the top of my list to buy. I made money on NAT and VLCCF in the

Shippers: I'm still buying them the way I have been: on valuation. My results
though don't seem too impressive...somewhat disheartening actually.

I don't know much about the managements of these companies,although I get more
confidence the more I read managements' reports and see their results (e.g.
TNP) My impression is that most of these companies are run by Greek
entrepreneurs some of whom are trying cash in on naive investors like me who
are attracted to the sector because of presumed low p/e's and dividends or the
popularity of the business when times were good (past couple years). Indication
of this is the large number of privately held businesses going public at top of
market.

Trying to get and use knowledge about ships' ages, capacities, routes, spot vs.
fixed rates, debt capacities -- in order to conclude with an intelligent
decision to buy or sell a stock or stocks in the sector, is near impossible and
a waste of time for normal people. (jmo)
My conclusion is that it's just best to buy a package of these shippers when
valuation criteria are met, and then let the best companies rise.

I still have positions in every tanker stock I've mentioned here over the past
few years. Some are full positions; I've probably stayed too long in them.
Others are outright losers for me, and where I've just cut back to mere stub
holdings (e.g. GMR).

The local truckers are OK.

I made a blanket statement awhile ago, "The rails are in ascent, and the
truckers are in decline". After thinking things over, I should have said the
business of the long haul truckers is decreasing. And this decrease may be
secular or long term in nature.

Truckers should be looked at on a case-by-case basis.

IMHO the railroads have no advantage over trucking in the following areas:

The truckers that run produce to processing centers will remain strong. Along
with the truckers that run perishables to market.

The truckers with quick turnaround times will always be in demand.

The refrigerated truckers will continue to do brisk business.

The local around town truckers are bullet proof.

And the truckers that haul from and to the railroad's intermodal hubs will do
good.

Good to hear from you Paul Senior.

The trucker doing well here is Swift Transportation, headquartered in Phoenix,

Swift bought the assets of Ringsby Trucking of Denver, which had lots of

important owner of the absolutely, horribly, woeful Colorado Rockies Baseball
Team. Ringsby ran out of Denver for 30 years and has experienced mountain and
icy road drivers which is important on I-70, I-25, and I-80. For some reason
the state of WY refuses to either plow their roads or put down ice melt.
Regardless of frigid temperatures. I love everything about WY except the roads
in the winter and Shotgun Dick Cheney. (This dude whined the worst day of his
life was when he shot his hunting partner; I believe the victim of the blast to

I have done a quick look at Swift's finances and I am impressed with their

think they are over valued and collect the distributions in between. I
currently own no Canadian royalty trusts due to my current pessimism on natural
gas. I have been picking up MLP's recently after been light on the sector for a
year or two.

Hi- with a K - My criteria for the shippers is similar to the others but I am
buying this position as an alternative to other similar revenue producing
investments specifically REITs. I am looking for a stream of dividends (best if
"qualified") that are generated from the business, that are some what fixed and
provide an equity kicker as the company grows. If I can accomplish this by
buying value (i.e.. $0.50 on the dollar) it makes a good long term holding in
my portfolio.

The key to my analysis is "qualified" dividend income. Many of the REITs and
limited partnership trust investments DO NOT have "qualified" dividend income.
Their distributions are taxed as ordinary income (both Federal & State).
However, many of these shippers do pay a "qualified" dividend (are taxed at a
maximum of 15% Federal) so the after tax gains are significant.

Currently I have 6% of my portfolio(s) invested in shipping companies including
both my taxable and IRA accounts. I like SFL (http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=sfl)
which is a company that finances oil tanker ships. Their biggest customer is
Frontline Ltd. (FRO) and eventually will grow their business to provide fleet
financing to several other shippers. Under their standard financing agreement,
SFL receives a 5% profit sharing distribution (as an added dividend) when the
fleet generates more than contracted revenues each quarter (usually as a result
of higher day rates for the previous quarter). SFL has paid this extra 5%
kicker dividend since their inception last year.

I have added other shippers to my holdings that appear undervalued based on the
company book value, have potential growing "leveraged" revenues as day rates go
higher and most importantly have the staying power and management experience to
weather the volatile day rate cycles. The key is to balance debit and cash flow
as well as the age of the fleet. Hopefully, this will provide an additional
equity kicker to my core holding SFL.

The current dividend return is just under three times that of what I can get by
buying 10 year treasury bills at 4%. This becomes an attractive "value"
investment when viewed based on the income generated from the "qualified"
dividend stream from my basket of shipping stocks.

To summarize, this is a long term "value" investment for me that generates
"qualified" dividend income with an equity kicker (as long as management
performs and sector growth continues). It's possible to also play the cyclical
"value" proposition and load up when day rates are low and then be quick with
the trigger and sell as day rates peak. This type of speculation is not
important in my investment decision but can help my overall return if I am
right.

That's how I see it. I may be wrong in my analysis and there is always company
specific issues that can arise which sour the investment. That's why it is
important to diversify. However, the sector PE, cash flow from operations and
future global growth prospects make this a compelling investment for me.

I bought some IQW as well. The value appears to be there, with and EBITDA of
almost 700M$ and EBIT of 350M$ in 2005 (which was a crummy year). This appears
to be more than sufficient to pay for the debt of 1.8B$, capital upgrades and
the dividend. Even though printing is not a good business, the market cap of
only 800M$ is low enough to make this a compelling value, assuming the business
stabilizes somewhat.

Mr. X’s last 3 abbreviated reports of his own determination of Undervalued
stocks include the following, in chronological order. The first two were
published on 20th. Feb., and the rest in fortnightly intervals :-

1) NUTR. The company distributes more than 3000 products through several brand
names such as Au Naturel, Solaray, Action Labs and Natural Balance. Despite
share price pull back, NUTR had average annual gain of 41.7% over the last 5
years.
It’s P/E of 12.7 is well below it’s Industry average of 39.7.
Revenues have risen in recent years, and it shows a Gross Margin of 51%. Bottom
line growth has been less dramatic. Asset turnover rate has climbed to 1.5
compared to industry average of 0.75.
NUTR has used over $20mil. to purchase property, complete several acquisitions,
reduce debt and buy back shares.

2) APLX. Provides business intelligence software tools. Company has over 2000
customers world wide, including about 1/3 of all Fortune 500 firms. It’s one of
the smaller players in the industry, but it’s managed to build up a relatively
large customer base. Its TM1 platform has proved a popular and cost effective
alternative to pricier, rival tools. The company is coming off a record year
with earnings advancing by 37% and Revenues by 20%. APLX has a very healthy
Gross Margin of 91%.

3) FACT. A regional investment banking and financial services firm based in New
York. The company’s fixed income segment, representing about 2/3 of Revenues,
has delivered solid growth in institutional trading and investment banking.
Revenues generated by mortgage backed securities jumped 64%. There’s been
significant insider buying of about 100000 shares, and institutional ownership
has increased by 17% from prior Quarter. Despite flat revenues, the company has
cut net losses in half and is committed to trimming expenses. FACT was an early
backer of iRobot (IRBT, $28.73) and owns about 1.2mil. shares worth about
$2.20/share.

4) TRFX. An interactive media company which uses its online properties such as
prizecade.com and grouplotto.com to generate over 50mil. email addresses, phone
numbers etc, which it then supplies to direct marketing companies. It’s a small
company with a Market Cap. of only $76mil., however it has zero long term debt
and more than $31 in cash and equivalents. It has a Quick Ratio of 4 compared
to the industry’s 1.2. Fourth quarter revenues jumped by 54% while the full
year’s went up by 69%. Operating Income showed a $2.3mil. gain from a loss the
year before, which helped earnings rise 132%.

5) BHIP. Company markets a wide array of health and nutritional products
manufactured by third parties. Bulk of sales are overseas, with 2/3 conducted
in Hong Kong. Because 90% of BHIP’s Revenues are from foreign countries, it’s a
good vehicle for exposure to foreign markets, especially Asian.
BHIP’s Revenue growth rates in the last 5 years have been excellent, ranging
form 58.4% to 198.8%. It’s TTM Revenue growth rate stands at 40.7%. Gross
Margins currently stand at 77%. BHIP ran into corporate governance problems
recently, but after an audit revealed improprieties of two directors, these
individuals were removed and the upper management team has been reorganized.

6) JOB. A temporary staffing firm that places IT, Engineering and Accounting
professionals. After first being introduced by Mr. X in June 2005, the stock
price rose 65% within two months. The stock has since relinquished much of
those gains, but is, once again, poised to deliver attractive returns.
JOB’s Revenues are split between two sources, viz. Contract Services and
Placement Services. Contract revenues dropped 11% but Placement increased 8%.
Despite slightly weaker top line figures, JOB delivered several improvements.
These included targeting higher-paying positions, double digit increase in the
number of placements, and posting rising earnings for 6 consecutive Quarters.
Its current P/E is 12.6 compared to the Industry average of 30.
JOB has above average Gross Margin, and its ROA and ROE are 8.8% and 11.4%
respectively, and the company ranks in the top third of its industry.

Carey Thompson, thanks for SWFT. I believe I'll pass on it. Lot going for the
company - relatively low psr, low p/e - in addition to positives you mentioned.
I've considered SWFT the long-time laggard in performance among LTL carriers.
This is can be seen here in some of its numbers against its competitors:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/co?s=SWFT

Not that being a laggard is necessarily that bad when/if its sector rises.
Sometimes, in some cases, the worst business performer shows the greatest
percentage stock price appreciation compared to peers.

It's bothersome to me though that the stock itself seems to cycle and is now
closer to a cyclical high than a low, and that there are recent insider sales
also. Further, in my particular case - which is that I have large bets on the
oil sector - even though the truckers seem to be able to pass through fuel
surcharges, they don't look like absolute screaming buys now, and it just feels
like if I were to buy any trucking stocks at this time, it's somewhat akin to
betting against myself.

Jmo, I'm no expert on the sector or any specific stock in it.

Yes, Suma, I looked at PLL after you mentioned it. I have owned it before. It's
been discussed here since 2000, but not for a while. The stock is fairly priced
at current price, imo.

Since 2000, I have had an occasional discussion with Marc Fortier about his
pick of DCI vs. PLL. His pick has performed much better. I never bought DCI,
believing it was overpriced. The stock has been a great performer though. So my
opinion about valuation was not, and is not, shared by the market apparently.

I see Donaldson, Pall, Clacor as fairly/fully valued at their current prices
and not as buys now for value investors. I'll pass on all of 'em.

However, two things: I've either been wrong on my value evaluation of these
stocks and PLL and/or the others really are a value proposition, or else I'm
right about my valuation call, but that call is irrelevant to people who just
want the stocks for whatever reason(s) - their good history, growth, future, or
popularity. Either way, for me, these stocks will be ones that if they continue
their good performance, they just will be stocks that move up without me.

PLL. If one were considering BUYING this stock, I’d say it was currently too
expensive. Based on a calculation using Dividend Cover and best Market Interest
Rate, this stock’s P/E should be in the region of 16 to 18. If one combines
that higher P/E of 18 with its TTM EPS of $1.16, we end up with a fair price of
about $21/share. PLL is currently trading at a fraction under $31, making it,
IMO, not a current bargain.
Looking at its chart, it’s been struggling to get above $31/share since July
2005, and has remained in a $25 to $30 range since October 2004.

IMO, if one currently OWNED this stock, based on its current fundamentals,
don’t expect too much in the way of "fireworks". It has a very healthy
Operating Margin but a below average growth in Turnover. This has been felt on
the Bottom Line with a drop off in EPS as per its last set of Annuals, even
though its Common Share number has reduced in the last 12 months.

It also has lots of long term debt on its Balance Sheet, when looked at in
terms of its current Equity. This hasn’t, as yet, impacted too heavily on its
Income Statement. Maybe the worst is yet to come, bearing in mind the FED still
sees the need to raise rates !

The one factor, IMO, that probably contributes most to PLL’s current "sideways
performance", is its lukewarm pre-tax return on CE of only 10%. A further
decline from the 11.5% it previously reported.
Although stocks such as HANS and PDX are in entirely different market sectors,
the importance of the relationship between this Rate of Return and a stock’s
performance, can be seen in the fact that HANS reported returns of 80% and 54%
in its last two sets of Annual Results. PDX reported 24% and 20%.

Grommit, about ANF. I sold my remaining shares around 2/8/05 at about $55. It's
difficult for me to come to terms with ANF now as a possible bargain given that
I previously concluded it was too risky for me to hold at $55. The stock
increased and has now fallen back again to $55.

ANF may well may be a bargain though. Especially, imo based on profit margins
and roe and what you have to pay ($55) to get those numbers. However, ANF is a
clothing retailer and a change in fashion might easily mean that a wrong guess
by ANF's buying staff about youth fashions will decimate sales, profits,
margins. OTOH,in ANF's worst year in the past decade, it managed 9.5% profit
margins. (a good sign)

I'm considering taking on a few shares tomorrow (Wed.), conflicted though I am
with my opinion of exiting at my guess of full-value ($55)and now, about a year
later, seeing the stock at $55 and calling it possibly undervalued. Perhaps at
best it's a very speculative buy here, so only a few shares for me. I'll do
more checking to see how Hollister stores are doing (a key aspect of my reason
to buy ANF previously).

One salient point he makes in the book is that there are two separate markets-
one is the stock market and the other is the business market. what are the
companies worth to someone who wants to take control of it. W has no control
over day to day fluctuations so he doesnt worry about it or what the market as
a whole is doing, he just buys business at a big discount and waits. I think
thats what is called for with khdh. edv is getting tougher and tougher for me

Steve Leuthold, who Barron's interviewed for this weekend's edition, would
agree with you in terms of the short-term trading implications.

"One of the problems is this market is dominated by hedge funds. They are all
playing the range on a short-term-trading basis. And, boy, that makes it really
difficult for this market to build the kind of momentum that will pull in the
public."

Neil H: Dressing up my AEOS position with more shares today.

My teenage nieces tell me they still very much like to shop/buy there.

My adding more now based in part on such anecdotal information, well that can
be very dangerous.

My daughter, the youngest (12) likes AEOS- but I worry that it doesn't seem to
be cool with the high school kids. My oldest (16) says she wouldn't be caught
dead in AEOS clothing.

The 16 year old shows at Hot Topic, Nordstroms and Urban Outfitters, FWIW.

Veterinary Stocks Beg for More Attention

Piper Jaffray & Co.
800 Nicollet Mall, Suite 800
Minneapolis, Minn. 55402
(Tel) (612) 303-6000

FOLLOWING OUR RECENT VISIT to the 78th annual Western Veterinary Conference in
Las Vegas, we remain confident that the veterinary sector is poised for strong
growth in 2006. At the conference we met with product manufacturers,
distributors, clinic operators and veterinarians -- with each segment of the
channel expressing great optimism for the veterinary industry in the coming
years, as pet owners continue to embrace advanced medicine and premium products
for their pets.

The trend of treating pets like family members appears to be alive and growing
-- in spite of recent store-traffic issues in the pet-supply specialty channel.
Veterinary services appear to be far more resilient to shocks in consumer
spending, which is intuitive given the relatively nondiscretionary nature of
veterinary care once a pet is considered a family member.

For the pure-play within the sector, we continue to recommend VCA Antech, the
operator of 367 vet clinics across the country and a highly profitable
diagnostics business. We also recommend Central Garden & Pet and PetsMart as
related participants in the veterinary segment with Central Garden & Pet's
growing animal-health segment and PetsMart's in-store Banfield clinics.

While the Street's fixation on "what have you done for me lately" may limit
significant upside in VCA Antech shares in the near term, following two
large-scale clinic acquisitions, [there has been] solid organic growth over the
past two years. We expect another strong year from the company as it continues
to execute on its strategy, blocking and tackling in its pursuit to acquire vet
clinics, integrate them and yield significant margin synergies. With
approximately 21,000 vet clinics across the country, we believe the opportunity
for consolidation remains robust. Additionally, we remain positive on the
growth prospects for both Antech Diagnostics and Sound Technologies units.

We believe the pending acquisition of Farnam Companies will provide Central
Garden & Pet with greater exposure to the stable growth of the veterinary
sector. While the price of this platform acquisition has created skepticism
among investors, we view the acquisition favorably and believe that sales and
margin synergies are likely to result, as it is integrated into Central Garden
& Pet's animal-health business unit. Also, we believe that business trends have
improved within Central Garden & Pet's TFH Nylabone segment after the sharp
slowdown that occurred in September. We view this as a strong indicator of
improving traffic trends in the pet-supply retail category, considering that
pet treats are likely add-on purchases during food-driven trips to the store.

We believe the Banfield Pet Hospital concept within PetsMart stores provides a
unique point of differentiation for PetsMart relative to other pet-supply
specialty players and the mass merchants. This concept also creates regular
store traffic for PetsMart, providing the company the opportunity to cross-sell
products and services to these loyal customers. Banfield clinics are currently
in approximately 500 PetsMart stores with the potential to expand to
approximately 1,250 Banfield locations.

often the runnups after a IBD or Barrons article are short lived... to me over
60 cents is looking pricy for now --- but i do think this is a good long term
play for the value scouter looking for low price with high potential.

I'll close my exploratory position in BMET on today's bump.

Still a value on some measures I use. Otoh, how much value can it really be for
me if if I'm grabbing for a way out because I'm losing my nerve over holding
it? (rhetorical question)

It started to spike concurrent with the Faber report on CNBC, citing some
thinking it is in play. Probably a good move taking some off the table on the
gift of this "news."
