and the fundamentals are worse than last year, due to low NG prices. The
dividend is probably safe but I don't see much room for appreciation in EXC

Hi Matt -

I assume your spreadsheet analysis was for SU. The EK$ value for SU I
calculated is $40.49. The tangible BV I used was $22.78 (vs BV of $24.79). I
used the 12/2012 avg earnings estimate of $3.20/share. Estimates are all over
the board and fluctuate between $2.14 and $4.20. A lot depends on the avg price
of Oil over the period.

Therefore, SU still is undervalued by 10% to the EK$ but at $30.00/share was a
lot more attractive. I too accumulated shares under $30 but only accumulated a
50% position.

CVE shows an EK$ value of $23.52 so w/ a market price of $39.00 it is one that
is not very attractive for me.

Another good resource to check valuations is the McDep reports:
http://www.mcdep.com/

Here is a recent report they did for Candian Oil Sands Ltd (COSWF)
http://www.mcdep.com/cos120202.pdf

Nexen, Inc. Common Stock (NXY) came in with a good EK$ value of $26.71. My
continued favorite is COP w/ an EK$ value of $94. COP is my No 2 position in
the portfolio.

Remember, like the McDep analysis, the EK$ is just the first step in what I use
to try to determine fair value. I started positions in both SU and COSWF early
this year because their operations are located in a politically friendly area
(ie Canada).

Continue to post your undervalued candidate companies as there are still many
out there. You can confirm your valuations looking at the McDep ratio (less
than 1.0 is undervalued).

Hi Clownbuck -

No doubt XCO is speculative and carries a lot of debt. I suspect they will be
selling some assets to bring that number down. Those wells drilled are sunk
costs and any future E&P company will have to spend similar monies to get to
those resources.

My position is small. My premise is one of owning the commodity (ie NG) because
I feel it is selling at a historical low price. I could be buying the wrong
company in XCO to achieve this and may be better w/ an ETF like UNG.

Thank's for the heads up on XCO as I have not viewed their recent presentation.

XCO & UNG have tracked pretty closely over the last two years.

Hi Mako -

Added a few shares of GLW in the IRA account. My last buy in this account was
5/13/2002 at $6.16/share. I had been selling off those shares over the years
and thought the current price provided a good long term entry "buy" point. My

could be as much as 53% undervalued from the current market price of $13.23.

I am not too worried about LCD panel glass and/or Gorilla glass prices. The

I put this one on my EK$ watch list. Tangible BV is $22.44 but analysts
earnings estimates are all over the place especially since the company expects
10% decline in Europe.

Still, I get a EK$ fair value number (worst case earnings) at $22.69, pretty
much where the stock is trading. Below $20.00/share would make a good entry
point. Analysts have 2012 earning as high as $2.08/share which won't happen.
Until there is some clarity on that number, I used trailing earnings of
$1.01/share in my worst case.

Therefore, if the stock drops another 10% from current levels and makes another
low on lower volume, I may start a tracking position. It's definitely one to
watch because of the assets they own.

60% of EnCana's 2012 production is hedged at $5.80/mmbtu level. Hard to imagine
next winter will be as warm.

Meanwhile, ECA is one of the most efficient producers in North America which
means it could survive this shake out better than most.

The stock looks like it has built technical support at slightly lower price
levels, and "I love buying straw hats in the winter."

What is worrisome is the fact that ECA has cut 250 million cubic feet of daily

OCF is negative, FCF is horribly negative. Maybe they can stop cash bleeding by

Macro-wise I am concerned about the glut of nat gas which is pushing
electricity rates down. This might not be true in Europe, but Europe has its
own issues.

Overall, I'd say to buy FSLR, you have to believe in solar and you have to
believe in the company. If solar and company turns up again, the stock will
rocket back to $100+. If solar and/or company freezes, it could get worse.

re Ml.PA, MGDDY - well tires are a tough business. What attracted me to
Michelin was the observation that the tire companies have more pricing power
than they used to. Evidence was their ability to increase the price of their
products with the rising input cost - traditionally they had trouble to do so.
In addition, we have a secular growth in emerging markets that are beneficial
to tire companies and as far as Michelin is concerned, a much better balance
sheet than they used to have. The low valuation is an other incentive, maybe
the main incentive.

I feel that the stock market is not given the tire companies and in particular
Michelin enough credit for the most better outlook. of course I could be wrong
and we could see the same old story: Overcapacity, low growth and price wars.
So far, I am not seeing that.

From CJES 2011 10-K. Hopefully this is helpful.

Delivery and Deployment of Fleet 6. In December 2011, we took delivery of the
first part of our sixth hydraulic fracturing fleet, which we call Fleet 6A, and
deployed it immediately for operations in the Permian Basin pursuant to a
two-year term contract on a full month take-or-pay basis. Fleet 6A, which
consists of 16,000 horsepower, has been continuously utilized for vertical
completions since deployment. Originally Fleet 6B, making up the other part of
Fleet 6, was to be a 16,000 horsepower vertical fleet, but, at our customer’s
request, was increased to 32,000 horsepower with the necessary ancillary
equipment and deployed effective February 13, 2012 for horizontal completions
in the Permian Basin.

New Equipment Purchases. We have ordered three new hydraulic fracturing fleets,
Fleets 7, 8 and 9. We anticipate taking delivery of Fleet 7 in April 2012 and
deploying it soon thereafter for work in the Permian Basin. Fleet 8 is
anticipated for delivery in the third quarter of 2012 but may be accelerated
based on market conditions. Due to the robust nature of our internal cash flow
and the confidence we have in our ability to expand our customer base, we have
ordered Fleet 9, which we expect to receive and deploy by the end of the fourth
quarter of 2012. We are actively seeking to secure multi-year take-or-pay
contracts for Fleets 7, 8 and 9; although, we believe that the equipment can
attract solid demand in the spot market if long-term contracts are not secured.

During 2011, we increased our coiled tubing fleet and the associated ancillary
equipment by approximately 40%, expanding from a fleet of 13 units at the
beginning of the year to a fleet of 18 units by the end of the year. We have
ordered six new coiled tubing units together with the related ancillary
equipment, which we expect to deploy in 2012 in new basins. Historically, we
have successfully leveraged our existing relationships with coiled tubing
customers to expand our fracturing business and we hope to do the same as we
expand our coiled tubing operations into new basins in 2012.

Re: INTEGRATED MGMT INFO (INMG.PK) 

Market Cap: $10.5M
PE= 12.4
Annual Revenues: $4.05M
Gross Profit Margin: 57.9 %

Hi Lazarus -

Glad to hear from you again. I recall INMG from your earlier post and am glad
to see that they are growing their revenues and actually making money. In fact,
with a 12.4 PE on over $4M of revenues is pretty good.

It's hard to quantify the actual "value" opportunity here as this is a small,
growing company w/ few hard assets. There are two main liabilities they have in
(1) SBA loan and (2) a private note. They seem to be growing their revenues
through different reoccurring revenue streams to cover these notes and their
other fixed expenses. In fact, other than their RFID cattle tags, they really
do not have any significant Cost Of Goods sold. Most of their current revenues
come from on-site one time audits that result in a certification.

The industry is new and appears to be necessary if a client wants to export
food products (mainly Beef & Pork) to other countries (Asia - Japan). The
tracking and certification of product from farm to store is something they are
"branding". Building this brand is the intangible that has lots of
possibilities and INMG has been exploring many of the revenue streams that will
grow their business.

The principals (husband & wife) appear to be the main officiers each w/ $90K
annual employment contracts. Their Web site shows 10 other employees that
provide varies consulting services
http://(http://www.imiglobal.com/IMITeam.html ). So, it is not clear to me if
company growth is dependent on hiring more employees to do consulting and one
time audits and/or needed to complete company re-certification audits. The key
is for them to build a base of customers that require at a minimum annual
re-certification audits that can be charged some type of monthly reoccurring
subscription fee.

The consulting business is very profitable but to build a business you must
build your client base and have a revenue model that provides for continued
billing of services. They are looking to expand their certification "brand"
vertically where perhaps they can generate other revenues/fees through that
channel.

To summarize, this is a hard one to value as their service is dependent on a
certification "brand" they are promoting and building. Does the company have a
working business model that can sustain 30% growth in revenues for years? If
they have built an effective technology based tracking system (w/ RFID tags and
intelligent Web concentric database) it's possible especially if repeated every
quarter for a few new and very large clients.

I have them on my micro-cap watch list to monitor their news announcements. For
me it is important when building a brand (especially one that requires a
certification) get lots of publicity from press releases and stories.

I am not sure this is one I would invest in but it's worth watching.

Positions increased: MOS, SLT, DELL, MSFT, MGDDY, GLW
Positions reduced: ATW, GRVY, PWRD, GAME, ARY, EGY, UVIC
Positions eliminated: MHR, MHR-C, MA
Flip-flop:

While Seth Klarman is making big money in distressed debt, the high-yield
market for small investors is looking less and less attractive. Prefs are
running optimistically over par. Therefore I sold a lot of ARY and remaining
MHR-C.

There's a saying: "Be careful what you wish for, you might get it". As soon as
I proclaimed PMGLF sale in December a mistake, the stock got hammered by
operations update report. The E part is not going well and the company only
replaced 67% of its production. So I got opportunity to rebuy it at lowish
prices. However, now it's not clear whether PMGLF is a good company to own.
I lightened on EGY a bit as stock ran up. Also lightened on ATW. Both these
stocks remain somewhat cheap. Sold remaining MHR after yet another report of
rising debt and huge capex. This stock is not for me - said investor pocketing
almost 3x gain. :)

More position reductions in still undervalued stocks: GRVY, PWRD, GAME, UVIC.
These were mostly due to the stock runups leading me to reduce outsized
positions. It is quite possible that I should have kept all these stocks.
I sold my small position in MA. The stock has become very expensive. It's a
pity I did not buy more of it during the credit/debit-card fee reduction panic.
Great company, sad to see it go.

Added MOS, SLT, DELL, MSFT, MGDDY, GLW. All of them - except MOS - are still
very cheap.

Started positions in AMNF and TSCDY discussed on this thread. So far they are
small exploratory positions.

"Unless my calcs are wrong, COP is significantly undervalued."

I don't know about your calcs, but COP has on average traded over many years at
1.5x stated book value. And that's where the stock is now. And since I use this
metric, to me, the stock looks fairly valued. I don't say that the stock won't
rise: I'd expect it to rise if/as stated bv increases. P/e which I also use in
evaluating large integrateds is almost 9. In past years COP seems to have
traded on average between 6-8 mostly. So here too, I don't see undervaluedness
now. McDep had COP as a buy last month (when the stock was lower, at $71 vs $78
now). It still may be a buy. Not for me though. If doing comparables, CVX still
seems better to me than COP. I'm partial to CVX though, and have followed it
for a number of years.

Just my commentary that I looked at COP and will pass. I could be very wrong.

re XLS - i was dead wrong selling this stock. Earnings for 2011 and forecast
exceeded expectations and the stock is up to 11.5$.

However, the pension hole problem remains and most of the FCF is going there to
fill it. According to their last presentation from 3/2 (P13) , the unfunded
pension is 1.92B$ as of 12/31/12. Furthermore, the pension gap estimate assumes
a 9% return on assets; good luck achieving that with ~42% of their assets in
fixed income.

There was a botched buyout attempt by its parent (UAE's Emirates National Oil

EKS, To your question, Iona's a North Sea gas producer stock I'm buying, and
that you might look at.

I’m buying INA.v/IONAF.pk. It’s developing North Sea gas properties.

From their recent presentation they say they expect or are targeting 8k boepd
for exit production 2012. And 50% more -- 12K for ’13.

I don’t know if there is or will be a nat gas glut for producers who supply
North Sea gas. And I don’t know how the recent increases in English North Sea
tax rates will affect Iona. I suspect these are not relevant factors at this
point for INA stockholders.

There are 141m of INA shares outstanding. INA has now obtained $130M with a
Senior Secured Reserve Lending Facility. The company has also said they intend
to issue between $60-$80M more of stock. At $.55/sh that would be between
109-145M more shares. (i.e. roughly doubling the outstanding shares). Shares
may have to be priced less than .55 to place, I don’t know. Stock price is now
about .57- .58/sh. From all this I calculate enterprise value to be, or will be
(141+145)x $.58 = $166M, plus $130M = $296M. (I assume the current net cash,
$30M, and the cash from the stock issuance, will all be spent to bring INA’s
new field(s) into operation for 2012-3 production.)

So to value the company on its presumed 8k boepd (mostly gas), what is the
metric number we might be using to guess what a purchaser might pay for the
entire company? Maybe, if nat gas pricing holds up in Europe, maybe $60K per
boepd? That would value INA at $480M . So the stock is undervalued based on it
having an enterprise value of $296M (and 8k bopd at end of '12).

The stock also appears undervalued imo on other valuations. For example,
2pnpv(after tax) is $3.09, per p.20 of 2/3/12 presentation. Somebody’s also
reported the stock’s very inexpensive on a cash flow basis if the company can
get its wells up and running and producing as the company hopes.

I’m somewhat overwhelmed with all these e&p companies I’m looking at and/or
owning. In considering the INA numbers now, these other stocks temporarily fall
into the background for me. Which means I’m not quite sure where I place INA
compared to others that I’ve found that, rightly or wrongly, seem to me to be
cheap. I’m guessing that if INA can pull out the gas/oil that they expect
without too many production glitches impeding them, that INA will be over $1 by
year end - maybe a double within 12 months- making it one of better stock bets
now in my purview, based on value and timeliness. But who knows? (I’ve been
wrong many, many times.) I'm buying shares, yet also buying shares of other
e&p’s as well.

I point out that although I’m buying shares now because I believe I see the
value now, I do expect that INA might go lower and perhaps provide a better
buying opportunity. To sell all its new shares, I believe the company will have
to offer those shares at prices below the current shares price that exists when
the pricing announcement is made. And I expect the then current stock price to
move down to, and maybe below, that offering price.

All jmo,
Paul S.

One of the reason's for the sell off in NPK.....NPK's ammunitions sales will
not keep up with 2001 levels. Since the U.S. pull out of Iraq, the DOD's demand
has decreased.

<On February 18, 2010, the Army awarded AMTEC a second five-year contract for
the management and production of the 40mm Ammunition System. As in the original
5-year contract, AMTEC was awarded the majority share of the 40mm requirement.
The first year requirements awarded to AMTEC under the new five-year contract
exceeded $183,400,000. The actual and cumulative dollar volume with the Army
over the remaining four years of the contract will be dependent upon military
requirements and funding, as well as government procurement regulations and
other factors controlled by the Army and the Department of Defense.>

Re: IONA ENERGY INC (IONAF.PK)

Paul good analysis.

The thing that catches my attention is Europe is dependent on a lot of their NG
deliveries from Russia via various pipelines into Europe. There have been lots
of political disagreements between the countries that have (and in the future)
will affect the price and the delivery of that NG into Europe.

<img src='/public/342737_55c609172a5169d20079811257880356.png'>

I do not want any of that Political risk. The NG from the North Sea is a
different story. There is already a huge network of NG pipeline infrastructure
from the North Sea to Europe.

<img src='/public/342737_d00537c722241c86006cdf5eeda9b7ff.png'>

Therefore, there is less political risk with your source wells located in the
North Sea. For me, that is the only reason I would look outside the U.S. and/or
Canada for investing in any foreign NG E&P. Also, the U.S. continues to
maintain their tight NG export rules limiting permits to develop LNG terminals,
charging high tariffs and basically constricting any new future developments to
export domestic NG outside the U.S..

This for me is an interesting play. A company w/ a $296M Enterprise value is
still on the smaller size.

My last venture w/ a small E&P w/ exposure in Europe was a disaster w/ Talisman
Energy Inc. Common Sto (TLM). Basically their whole European venture was a dud
(before the opportunity for fracking) mainly because of the political issues w/
Turkey and getting their gas from their offshore wells into the distribution
system. Don't remember all the details but it seemed like one problem after
another. Took a 50% loss on that one.

CONSOL Energy Inc. Common Stock (CNX) 

Barron's Feature | SATURDAY, MARCH 3, 2012
Consol's Energy Alternatives
By SANDRA WARD | MORE ARTICLES BY AUTHOR
In a world hungry for cheap energy, this Pennsylvania company has a valuable
legacy in coal and a buoyant future in natural gas. Investors should take more
notice.
(Note: From Barron's Online edition may require subscription. If you search the
article title w/i Google you will get the full version of the article from
their link)
http://goo.gl/kHGZm

From the article:"...Compared with the price of crude, natural-gas prices are
at historic lows. <u>Crude has typically traded in a range of six to eight
times the price of gas on an energy-equivalent basis.</u> At a recent $108.84,
crude oil is about 45 times that of the $2.43 per million British thermal units
that natural gas is commanding, a differential that many investment
professionals say can't be sustained. Coal is cheap, too, trading almost
equivalent to gas at $2.69 per MMBtu, while oil is at $18.33 per MMBtu....".

-------------------------------------------------------------------

CNX is selling close to it's 52wk low of $30.56 (last $33.93). The EK$ value is
$30.85/share. Based on the BTU equivalent for Coal & NG, CNX is undervalued due
to the current high price of crude. The article make a compelling argument that
the market is overlooking the value of CNX's reserves. According to the article
CNX's $7.7 billion market value is less than half the $17 billion price tag
Wall Street puts on its coal and natural-gas assets. They believe the company's
net asset should be valued in the range from $45 to $62, representing a gain of
33% to 83%.

was 8/2010 @ $35.39/share.

To clarify couple of things:

From what Difco said, even if we get Buffett to meet with us as a group, this
is probably going to be not during shareholders meeting weekend. We could ask
to meet not in Omaha, but I think this lowers our chances to get the meeting.
IMHO, if we get the meeting at all, we'd need to be flexible on time and place.
So probably Omaha in the middle of the winter at 9 am on Tuesday morning or
some such thing. :)

Second. I am seriously counting people interested. So please post here or send
me a private message with "yay"s. If we get 10 serious "yay's", I'll push it
forward. Mr. Gogo suggested that if we get Buffett meeting, we could also
invite Mike Burry (and Jim Clarke :)). Now, if we don't get Buffett (or
Charlie), we could still try to get a meeting with Mike -- although I'm not
sure if this would be easier than getting Buffett. :))))

So to recap:
- meeting sometime/somewhere at Buffett's convenience.
- I need yay's that I can count. Not "maybe I have to think". I understand if
plans change - I won't charge you money for meeting cancellation. :) So far I
have 4 yay's: me, Difco, Mr. Gogo, Matt Monday.

Jurgis - about PMGLF. I share your uncertainties. Essentially, PMG is a
speculative E & P in the best sense. If it reverts to its past success rates,
it could easily be a double over only a few months. A couple more doubtful
drilling results and it could equally easily fall well below recent lows. I see
it as a sensible part (only) of a portfolio of E & P stocks, which for most of
us should probably not be a big part of our total holdings. I was lucky to sell
most of mine near the highs (around the $40 mark), but I`m too old to hold this
sort of thing over the long haul. I contrast PMG with PBN also in the Petro
family, which has a better yield and much lower exploration risk. Does not mean
that one should over own this either, though.

>>what do you hope to accomplish by bothering the guy?<<

A fun meeting maybe? Some Morsels of wisdom maybe? A photo with WEB and me on
the wall, plus an autograph?

Now, there is a big fat chance that WEB doesn't want to be bothered but that
should not keep up from trying. A hedge fund guy payed 2.5M$ or so for a
meeting with WEB. if we can bother him to hook up with us, a ticket to Omaha
and a few hotel stays would be a tremendous value, don't you think?

The messier, the better. The lower FSLR goes, the more interesting it becomes
to me. I think it will be a survivor, and trading below tangible book makes me
lick my chops. Still waiting, but I anticipate pouncing sooner or later.

MUR - ROE sucks, margins suck. Why not buy something like CVX which is much
better company overall?

Clownbuck, it looks like you were right. BTU is now below 32. Coal appears to
have peak middle of last year. With China growth rate slowing to 7.5 coal
stocks with exports to china are getting hit.

I have started buying some more of BTU.

" ROE sucks, margins suck. Why not buy something like CVX which is much better

Well.... that is why I am asking!

But yeah ROE, MARINGS, ROA is not the best, Didnt know if anyone had a view or
insight on it that could turn this around.

re BTU @31.13$-
>>I have started buying some more of BTU<<
Me too, I got two batches (IRA and taxable account) today at a little more than
31$. I think I'll also add to CNX close to 30$. As for BTU, I like their
international scope (Australian assets). Even if China slows down, they still
will need more coal and Australia has prime coal resources that can be shipped
to China.

China has it's own coal industry but there is a lot of cost pressure from
increasing salaries(~10-15%/year) , the native inflation and currency
appreciation (~5%/year). Australia has some of that too but i think theirs will
moderate.

Still holding on to a 25% position on COR and a 75% in DLR. As DLR approaches
$74.00 and the yield drops below 4%, I will peel off shares to bring it down to
a 50% position. DLR made a recent purchase of land and facility in Texas that
provides both good FCF from the operating facility and the possibility to
expand their footprint by 33%. Their business model is built to provide a large
payout, so I expect that the company will announce another dividend increase
soon.

Most Data Center Related Stocks Positive After Q4 2011 Earnings
http://seekingalpha.com/article/408021-most-data-center-related-stocks-positive
after-q4-2011-earnings?source=yahoo

Both Digital Realty (DLR) and CoreSite (COR) were slightly positive after
earnings, confirming a trend that has seen their stocks up 9% and 20%,
respectively, since the start of the year.

The only green on my watch lists are the REIT's. Maybe Saturday's positive
Barron's article is generating the buying interest.

Our trio of real-estate experts talk about why they like mall REITs, are
lukewarm on apartments and worry about New York City real estate. Trailer parks
anyone?

Article mentions some specialty REITs including DLR & ARE:

From the article:"... Digital Realty Trust [DLR) is the leading landlord for
data storage, one of the few REITs that really had the ability to take their
business global relatively seamlessly. They traded at an average cap rate of 6%
or so, but dividend growth has been 34% over the last 12 months. Very good
management.

Alexandria Real Estate Equities [ARE] is the largest landlord focusing on lab
assets, a very specialized niche. You need to understand the science of your
tenants because the build-out is expensive and highly specialized. For them to
move is a big deal. Alexandria shares have been out of favor for the last two
years. Investors were concerned about the size of their development pipeline
and their efforts to de-lever their balance sheet. Now it has an
investment-grade rating...."
