Tobin's Q Data - Extreme Overvaluation

I put together a report on Tobin's Q data for the U.S. market from 1925 through
1997. (replacement cost vs. market value)

It is currently signaling significant overvaluation so I wrote Dr. James Tobin
(nobel prize winner) and asked for his view. He was kind enough to write back
and give me permission to share his thoughts with you.

Wayne, agreed. That's my interpretation too, and it was my interpretation
before I even saw his comments. It seems relatively
intuitive that the Q would be less useful given the industrial shifts in the US
over time.

Still, I agree with your conclusion. I've re-awoken the bear:

Mike,

In line with strange Brokerage actions.

Just had a conversation with Fidelity Investments. Have been a customer for
many years. They keep trying to get us to use their Net facility. Had started
to use it occasionally; but, for the last few weeks could not log-on Password
was rejected. They now say that I also must have their cookie on my machine and
make it available to their program.

Problem is they use the cookie facilities used by the IRS, Police, and every
other scum-bag known to man.

They said to not use the site if I have a problem. Everyone should have a
problem!!!

Just my opinion.

Be careful, fellows (OT, on a lighter side 8-)

I almost jumped on the Momentum bandwagon with LZRC, LCAV, LVCI of laser eye
correction Centers . Had a 16 banger on VISX, since 1995. They make the
machines, 75 % market share.

Here is what would happen (if we are not careful) , one for the smiles. My son,
in silicon valley is a chartist and I am a Benjamin Graham pupil (but almost
persuaded to jump on the Momentum wagon)

My late wife's father is a chartist, who bought stock before the '29 crash,
would you believe. He got out of stocks last summer ! Bonds. He is 94 and
thinks doomsday will come New Year's of 2000.

Anyway, when I consulted with my son, on this new Momentum venture, this is how
he started his reply

>>Tongue in cheek:.....

Herey Herey --- now mark the end of the great bull market
of the last century.... Walter Linde has cast aside the motto of
'buy the house for the price of the furniture inside'
and is willing to jump in to Momentum Investing....
And so it was written that the Great Collapse began on
March 20 1999 8-)

Other telltale signs of the market coming unglued included Warren
Buffett dumping all of his Coca Cola, Gillette, and
Washington Post shares and trading them in to buy
shares in the Net's hotest 'virtual mutual fund' CMG Inc.

In a related story, William C Guest III decided that gold
will never resume a price curve with an upward tendency
and and decided to invest (in his retiring years) in
Pork Belly futures.

Yes --- the 8 year bull market came to a quick and ugly ending
when these three aligned in a curious shift in their general
belief about how the universe worked..... as I write this
the light bulbs in the house begin to flicker with an uneven
source of power as the world prepares to be plunged in to
total darkeness and the end of the world, as predicted by
William C Guest comes to an early ending.... (turns out that
new records showed that Jesus was actually born in
March - not in December as widely believed - and therefore
2000 actually begins right now)......

kidding aside.... 8-).... here's my read on the charts: <<

and he goes into his views of LVCI and all. I answered:

>Great Prose, Carl ! Enjoying the beginning of your answer because

>When I start, it must be the END.

Nice to have kids like that.

BTW did you see where two guys in the WStJ predicted 36 000 on the Dow ? Saying
P/E of 100 is not entirely unreasonable.

I noticed the Dow didn't go up. Actually, their arguments are not bad. I think,

Scary anecdote:

My wife who knows nothing about the market and has even less interest or
comment saw her 401-K account today -- much smaller than her peers. I have had
it invested in fixed income as a safe and tax efficient fixed income element in
our overall financial strategy. Taxable funds are in stocks, taking advantage
of the 20% break. Her peers had lots more money and have been in stocks (but
don't have personal portfolios).

Anyway, my wife says are you sure we shouldn't switch to stocks. I say that we
are 15 years too late for that strategy. She reminds me that I have been saying
that for a while and that stocks have done great in just the last 2 or 3 years
since we last talked.

Is there anyone who thinks some of the bargains out there that have all but
been ignored can appreciate in the face of such overvaluation in the large

sell everything and go on vacation.

<<Is there anyone who thinks some of the bargains out there that have all but

That is THE question. WARNING. Jim is about to talk about market timing.

It is not a given, but let us assume the large cap stocks are way overvalued. I
believe that rationally, not emotionally, and am willing to invest based on
that, so for argument's sake, that underlies the following. Backing up the
point is a waste of everybody's time.

And it is a fact (whether this is "greater fool" or everybody's smart) that 75%
of the money going into the market now is going into these large cap names. The
question Jeffrey Bash put on the table is can we construct a case where the
cheap small cap stocks, which represent very sensible value, go up in the face
of this mania? In other words, even if a Clayton Homes or a LaSalle Hotel may
represent absolute value in the long term, is it rational behavior to hold onto
them now. The alternative would be to go fully into cash.

I am thinking about that more and more. I am 30 years old, so I have not been
through a mega-bear. But I read a lot. When I look back at the early 1970s, the
last Nifty Fifty, the set-up was the same. Second tier stocks had
underperformed for a couple years going into the peak, BUT WHEN THE BIG STOCKS
BROKE, THE SMALLER ILLIQUID STOCKS GOT CRUSHED EVEN WORSE EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE
"RELATIVELY CHEAP". (We saw the same thing last fall.) A few years later, about
1976, small stocks recovered big while the Nifty Fifty were still floundering.
So in the end, value prevailed. But it took a long time, and you would have had
every opportunity to buy these small stocks at ridiculously low prices if you
had been in cash when the Nifty Fifty crashed.

But what does that precedent tell me about what to do now? It tells me to sell
everything now - provided of course that I don't have a large embedded tax
liability.
1) If I want to own the smaller stocks I own now for the long term, I will have
the opportunity to own them again at much lower prices if this scenario plays
out. So even if I like the companies I own now, I lose nothing in this
scenario, and stand to gain by buying back into the same stocks at lower
prices.
2) When the levee breaks, I will have the opportunity to own the companies I
want to own at reasonable prices, rather than being stuck with a portfolio of
OK companies which happen to be cheap today. Make no mistake, if your portfolio
drops 50% and your dream company falls into your buy range, you are going to
have a hard time selling stocks to raise cash to buy something new.
3) Most of us have some debt. Unless it is a tax deductible mortgage, the
interest rate is your opportunity cost for holding stocks. I have student loan
debt at 8 1/4%. Do I really believe I can make better than 8 1/4%, and that's
AFTER TAX and absolutely risk free? I'm not talking about credit card debt. If
you've got a credit card balance and you've got money in the stock market, you
need to get your head examined.

I have been inches from selling my entire portfolio multiple times in the last
month. Taxes are an issue on some of my holdings, but I haven't been patient
enough or successful enough for that to be THE issue like it would be for some
of you. Every time I look at the stocks I would sell though, I know why I own
them, and I think they are undervalued. But I also know what I am seeing in the
market and I see every day the psychology of its major players. I smell danger
like it is right outside the window.

The premise of all of this, of course, is that I consider the market at an
historic top. 1929, early 1970s type. I have read and reread the books about
those times and I think I've got a feel for the psycology of a monumental top.
But I've never SEEN one. I work with people who started their careers in the
late 60s. And to a man, they are scared to death.

I am going to print this out, and read it tomorrow morning. Then I will read
whatever is in my inbox on SI. And if I still feel like I do now, I will have a
lot more cash by noon tomorrow.

When I first got started in the buy-out business in the early 1980's small,

When 4.0 became 6.0x, everyone started using operating cash flow as the

So, we have til noon to keep you in the fold!

One issue that's different today from 1975 is the money supply. There's an
awful lot of money sitting on the sidelines. M3 today is at 6+ trillion
dollars. It's been growing at a 7+ pct rate since 1975, and at better than 10%
in the last year.

http://www.stls.frb.org/fred/data/monetary/m3sl

And, I believe, the Fed's numbers don't capture the money sitting in brokers'
money market accounts ready to be invested. (Although indirectly and partially
captured by the inclusion of repurchase agreements in M3).

All of this liquidity is sitting there waiting for dips in the market, or in
peoples' favorite stocks.

Think about it, James, aren't you sitting there with a little more cash than
you had a year ago? I certainly am.

Hi James,

I (and the thread) knows what you do for a living and respect your opinions and
analyses therefore it is not really my place to give unsolicited advice on this
subject. So, here it goes <G>:

Perhaps you should postpone such a dramatic action until the words 'scared' and
'fear' pop up less than in your latest post. Is it just that stocks are
over-valued or is there a catalyst in the wings? Rising oil prices? More
foreign market turmoil? Domestic earnings on the wane? Have yuppies exited the
most productive portion of their lives and started to withdraw money from their
retirement plans?

Granted, I agree with your depiction of small-cap value stocks being ignored
and under-performing. My 'non-value' holdings have far outperformed my 'value'
holdings. But I am young and most pay a dividend greater than 7% so I sleep
pretty well. All I am saying is that there should be a fundamental reason for a
bear market (a correction might 'just happen' but I do not think a bear does -
sound like a fair assumption?).

Hope you do not mind the advice. Good luck with whatever you decide.

John

PS: I recently chose TGX over TDW after they were discussed on the thread. I
passed over TDW because I doubted that OPEC could regain control with an
expanded base of oil suppliers. I bought TGX ($6.75) because I had just
discussed prostate cancer treatments with some medical researcher friends of
mine (just out of curiousity - not necessity!) and they had spoken very highly
of the seeds. That and the company's balance sheet and potential seemed like
synchronicity. Short-term you can see my advice is suspect! <G>

James, re: JRC, are you thinking that it'll be your personal Washington Post?

The negative book value sure grabs the reader's attention, but quickly looking
at (only!) the most recent 10-Q gives the following, assuming that they are a
good company with good management, etc, etc.

Market cap is $580M and they have $780M in long term debt. Most recent'
quarter's EBITDA (gawd, can't believe I'm using that!) is $27M. They have a lot
of goodwill on the balance sheet, so adding back the $16.8M D&A and then taking
out $6.7M capital expenditures gives about $37M of some flavor of cash flow.
Multiplying by 4 gives $148M of "some flavor of cash flow, before interest" -
SFCF-BI.

$580M + $780M = $1360M capital, which generates $148M SFCF-BI. Doesn't look so
bad, it's better than 10%.

Taking interest (4*$14M) out gives $92M SFCF on $580M market cap - about 6.4x.

If they can prudently carry this much debt, you're getting the company for 6.4x
"SFCF" (TM ;-). If not, they ought to be able to work down the debt reasonably
quickly.

This what you had in mind?

I agree with your post on the small vs.large cap two tier valuation situation
and historically what has happened when these big market tops finally break.

What to do has been on ongoing internal debate for me too.

I'd just like to add one small insight into small cap valuations. A reasonable
case can be made that some if not a significant amount of the economic activity
we see right now is in some part related to this mega bull market we have.

As examples:

Higher government tax receipts
Easier pension funding
Higher consumption

I also question what is going to happen to the income streams and financial
positions of many smaller companies that appear cheap at present when/if we
have a big one.

I have to say that Jim and I in the last few years (and I gather this from
private e-mail as well as here) have had synchronicity in terms of our market
view, but he has been much more successful than I in terms of actually yanking
his money out of the market and rescuing his returns. From our discussions, i'd
give a wild guess it's added about 10% more to his yearly gains than mine.

So here I am, with my portfolio up 15%. I haven't seen the holdings of Royce,
but it wouldn't surprise me if there was overlap. The distribution of my
holdings by market cap:
two < 50M
three 100 - 500M
three 500M - 1B
four 1B-2B
two 2B-3B
two 5B-10B
one 15-20B

I'm small cap since I'm mostly in <3B market caps but I'm really just looking
for value where I can get it. I'm also now 15% cash. (and I'll stay that way at
least until my funds are unfrozen)

What works? Well, diversification among undervalued names (as Paul Senior has
preached) is the tack I'm taking. I've come to appreciate the value of
diversification. Tapdog, if your portfolio is similar to mine, and you aren't
up 10-15% yet this year (there was a significant Jan effect this year), then
there's probably a management issue rather than a selection issue in your
portfolio. And maybe diversification is the key. The way small caps are going,
some are taking huge hits which could turn portfolios upside down. WHX, my
worst performer, is down 15.5% this year. But it's just a few percent of the
portfolio, not 15% like it would've been a few years ago. And I've found that
predicting movements in individual stocks over even a few years is very, very
hard. Midway and Deswell have taught me that.

FTR, my portfolio more or less moves with the market now, and usually daily
fluctuation is less than 1%. Except it has been outperforming mainly by being
down less than the market on down days, with occassional moderate
outperformance. Today, the S&P is down 1.94%, and I'm down 1.39%. That's been
typical. And I owe Paul and Al Frank for the improvement in my money management
because they helped me see diversification as tool not just of the weak. If
anything that Buffett's done can be said to have hurt value investors, IMO it's
his witticisms regarding diversification as a weapon of the ignorant or lazy.

For what it is worth, I started in business in 1963. Therefore, I have seen
most of the bear markets of substance in the last 50 years. I

this feels a bit more like the late 60's than 1973-74.

At that time tech stocks like Digital Equipment were all the rage,
sort of the way the Internet stocks are now. I seem to recall that
from that point those kind of stocks did not make any progress for some years
until the entire market crashed in 1973-74.

I sympathize with those not seeing a catalyst for a bear market now, including

John, I thought I would give you another informed opinion on the subject of
prostate seed implants. While the facilities that are performing these
procedures may be strong advocates, what they want tell you about are the
reimbursement rates from Medicare. The healthcare organization that I work for
analyzed the procedure and came to the conclusion that it is a money loser. The
procedure is very labor and cost intensive. So, we left it to the major
academic centers to handle. Many other facilities I speak with are coming to
the same conclusions.

Also, HCFA is currently setting reimbursement for the new APC (Ambulatory
Payment Classifications)as part of the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment
System. I have seen the proposed reimbursement numbers and they are atrocious,
especially for brachytherapy. Following is a quote form Larry Kun, chairman of
the board of directors for ASTRO (American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and
Oncology), to Nancy DeParle at HCFA, "the proposed changes will definitely
curtail and may totally eliminate access to all but the most rudimentary
brachytherapy treatments."

Excellent info, and what is probably behind the price drop more than anything
else. Of course, only a tiny fraction of eligible patients are even made aware
of the procedure, and the benfits in terms of side effects are substantial.
IMO, the surgery-oriented bent of urologists is the bigger problem, as patients
are less informed of all options than they should be, which inhibits standard
of care formulations that would favor the procedure. Medicine is a hierarchal,
traditional, egotistical field. Despite all the hype about peer-review-and it
is hype- Medicine as a whole is much less evidence-based than the field would
have us believe. I look at TGX like CPU. Hard to find a good catalyst but it's

Right now, manu housing (via Champion) is 3.3% of my portfolio, but I'm looking
to increase my position in Champion specifically. Management describes the rise
in pipeline inventory as concentrated in a "handful of states," but that it is
nevertheless concerning due to an unprofessional push by suppliers and finance
companies into the channel. Given Champion's push into retail, and Champion's
own management concerns that retail locations have grown faster than market
growth, this is the biggest risk for this investment. The top six retailers
have a combined 17% market share, though, and consolidation is occurring.
Champion will be one of the consolidators and benefit from this, with more
control over inventory levels in the future. Management is very able. I'm being
careful, though. After I've initiated a position, I try to keep a rule of not
adding again until the stock price has fallen by at least 1/3. Bought Champion

Prostate BT vs. External Beam Therapy, recent studies are showing that except
in the cases of stage one prostate ca, EBRT is just as good or better than
brachytherapy. The problem with brachytherapy, besides costs, is that it looks

scaling down amount I own. Reallocating some to new position in THQI. The guru
on the SI THQI thread is excellent IMO (but what do I know?--). I've concluded
I'd rather have a small company that markets and executes computer games well
(that's THQI imo) at a reasonable price (again, imo) than have an 'relatively'
outsize position in Toys-R-Us --- which is reducing it's cap. expenditures
(their buildings), but who is squeezed ever tighter by WalMart, e-toy, and even
the little 'educational' toy stores. Still holding all my Midway. I consider
both Midway and THQ as similar to entertainment stocks -- their price will rise
if they can deliver a blockbuster product-- predicting which, when, who is
fruitless---- best is to be in the stock and await serendipity. JMO, no facts
behind it.

for a downturn around April 8th. They called the July 20 top last year to the

in calling both the July 20 top and the subsequent rebound to where we are now.

may be evolving from a value play to an internet play except that this these
are guys who have demonstrated ability to find a niche and make money off it in
the past unlike most internet companies which have only shown an ability to
sell stock. I sense a growing internet presence plus all sorts of tie-ins plus
the global telephony business- I believe that this company could double or

Greetings Paul Senior,

I have studied IDTC just this week, I am interested in the reasons why you
sold, my instincts tells me you did the right thing.
As I see it, the recent price run up seems to be due to rumors of an IPO
offering for the netphone subsidiary. One poster even insist the IPO
announcement will take place this week. It's Tuesday and the volume is half the
usual average on a small 1/4 point drop. I know for a fact that if an IPO is
imminent, volume and price would rise dramatically due to insiders and rumor
buying. Now on to the important part, is IDTC worth investing? From what I've
read, the call isn't as clear and reliable as old phones. The setup and
software needed is too complicated for the average person, no problem for the
net literate and early adopters though. IDTC seems to be having a problem with
meeting earnings expectations. The pluses for IDTC? Long term, all calls will
be net based because its simply cheapest, could take 5 years or until call
quality improves. IDTC growing at a fast pace, over 20% quarter to quarter, but
is profitless growth good? The IPO rumor if true will reap investors with great
returns, Any net stocks with 100% plus growth and profits will be a winner. My
overall rating?
IDTC looks good, but the volume and price are going in the wrong directions, in
my pass experience, this indicates a scam or bigger fishes than us knows
something stinks and staying away. I'm most certain that you will disagree with
me. I hope you can make a clear case for this stock because the company looks
too good to be true.

Thanks for reading,

particularly well of late, and that IDTC is not a recognized internet brand
name. However, I believe that that is a likely future event and if so the stock
will soar. The use of the word scam vis-a-vis IDTC is inappropriate. This is an

a while, but for the first time NH is offering its dealers and customers a full

equipment in the last three years, that adds up to one heck of an achievement
for this company. What I got out of numerous conversations with NH salesforce

Nope, still holding for a better recovery. I realize that e.g. on FINL, it goes
from 7 1/2 to 14 1/2 and I sell all, well, I really only have 11 -12 at most to
reinvest after taxes. Hence I sold 1/2 UBB, 1/2 FINL, and 1/2 TCP only because
they ran up far beyond expectations given the time frame. UBB went from 10 1/2
to 18 1/2, TCP from 13 5/8 to 25, and FINL from 7 7/16 to 14 3/4. And UBB and
TCP went only because I had overweighted those positions and I ended up way
"too Brazil" after the rally. NH would have to get to the high teens before I
consider selling half, and near $30 before I even consider selling the rest. NH
I've a lot of confidence in, and have bought it for every account I manage, all
recently just under 9.

In any case, I can't trade NH in the VSN fund because the assets are frozen
thanks to Etrade/Citibank. Looks like Robert Half is slipping away from me as
my assets remain frozen. I had tried to enter an order two days ago at 30 3/8

"What we are looking for are value plays. Obscene value plays. In the Graham
tradition..."

Well, Stone & Webster (SW) doesn't sell for below net-net. But, it sells for
below just about everything else. Like almost 75% below per share revenue,
which seems "obscene" enough (see:
http://www.stocksheet.com/cgi-bin/getbigreport?Ticker=sw ).

porc scoffs that SW never seems to make money in one year without losing even
more in the next. I take porx point to mean that constructing petrochemical
plants, nuclear power plants, etc., doesn't have the same kind of fat and
predictable margins as, say, selling soda, razor blades or videocassettes of
the Lion King.

However, if SW got back to the 5% net margins of yore, the p/e would be just
over 5 at its current share price. In this week's Barron's (3/22/99) Rhonda
Brammer (as told to Alan Abelson) explains the situation thus: SW had always
been engineering driven, until a more shareholder value oriented CEO took over
in 1996. Needless to say, a company with this kind of a time lag between book
and bill cannot be as nimble as an AOL. Nevertheless, she was left very
impressed by the progress to date.

Unfortunately, building petrochemical plants in places like Indonesia, and oil
prices uncooperatively plummeting, have not made the new CEO's task easier.

Personally, I don't like any company whose fortunes are so leveraged on a rise
in the price of oil (unless, of course, its ticker symbol is XON). But, I
thought SW looked like a fit for this thread.

I seem almost to be continuously buying insurance company stocks. This is scary
to me if I think about it, since by no means am I an expert in any of the
various insurance businesses in which I am now immersed. My latest find, in
which I started a position Friday, is London Pacific ADR (LPGLY). Now this is a
very interesting company from the perspective of looking at their business
model --- and I fully admit that I'm at a point where the model is not really
clear to me.

Here are some numbers which will get the stock to pop into a value investor's
screen:

LPGLY closed at 15, in a yearly range of (roughly) 10-17.
According to the company, they earned $1.85 in '98. That's a
pe of about 8. They will pay a dividend they say of .928 in '99.
That's a yield of about 6%. Their stated book value is $23.44 per ADR share. So
a p/bv of .63.

The interesting stuff can be got from checking the last couple of news
announcements from Yahoo. Basically - and as seems to me -LPGLY is a company
which does the vast majority of its business in the US. The management staff is
located here too. They develop and manage fixed and variable annuity products
which are sold through independent agents and through large brokerages. Sales
have been generally flat ('98 over '97). Fixed annuities is not an appealing
business to me. It's what they are doing with their "float" that is the kicker
and the reason I started a small position:

I came across an article by William Nasgovitz - you will see it referrred to by
somebody on the Yahoo msg. board - which caught my attention when I read "The
firm has a venture capital division, which has invested about $100 million in
nearly 15 technology companies." That's further clarified - only somewhat more
- by the last couple of news releases from the company. As these companies - at
least one of which might be an internet related business - come public, LPGLY
intends to account for its investments by marking them to the market. Which
means the potential for large swings in LPGLY earnings and stock price.

There's still a bunch of unknowns out there for me with LPGLY -- what exactly
are those 15 companies, what commitments are required of LPGLY to get what
benefits, when might such benefits be realized (IPO's?), what could be the
future of fixed income annuities (what a lousy business -g-)--- and there's
stuff I'm not happy about-- I missed the dividend, I'm coming into the stock at
a relatively high price 15 above 10, I'm suspicious in general of off-shore
centered 'insurance' companies of which I never heard, and probably I have more
concerns if I thought about it. But the point is-- given the basic value
numbers - there is a margin of safety (in my mind anyway) with an opportunity
that the stock could actually perform well over the next couple of years - if
someone could hold on to it. That would be my opinion anyway.

CAUTION: I have been VERY, VERY wrong on at least one other insurance company
on which I've posted here before, and only less wrong on a couple of others.

reasonably valued. Her audio comments are at

Joe: Took a small initial position in ICO @ 7 1/4 [So expect it to tank to 3]

and -3.25 was going to be delivered, but further digging showed most of that
loss was non-recurring and was expected. The unexpected part was hit from .37
to - .20 or so in operating earnings.
Some comments on Yahoo board indicate they're having some real problems
executing and getting their arms around the business...especially since the
merger. A lot of the reason the market hates them is that the net might destroy
their business model, but the real challenge to their earnings may be failure
to execute. In other words poor service may be driving their customers to the

I do not know the answers to your questions. However, it often is not a matter
of shorting by the holders to obtain better terms - which the
convertible sometimes prohibits.

The convertible buyer is often someone with an existing position in the common.
They can knock the price down just by selling their existing common holding.

Also, the presence of these kinds of convertibles often attract third party
shorts because of the poor condition of the company and the snowballing effect
a decline of the common has because of the presence of the convertible.

And all of a sudden I'm a different kind of "net" investor...

There is something irrational happening in CPU today, but some of us saw it
coming.

We already knew that CPU acquired the first requisite property of any bona fide
stock market rocket: an N/A PE on Yahoo. Investors today therefore lose their
only barometer. Remember, this is a good thing.

And we could see it coming (because CPU told us so a few months back) that they
were going to revamp and spin-off their 'net operations. But we also know that
the typical CPU shareholder can't see more than a few minutes into the future.
So then it crashes drastically to the high $5's, and for this price, I'm
thinking bargain. After all, it's CompUSA. The name has as much potential for
becoming gold-plated like AOL. In fact, the whole situation reminded me a lot
of when AOL was a "commodity" supplier of outdated
internet-for-babies-and-old-folks-since-they-were-the-only-ones-that-would-tole
ate-not-ever-getting-online-on-the-first-twenty-tries.

So then today, CPU announces something that they already announced: a revamped
site for on-line computer sales. The volume triples in 2 hours and the stock
jumps 22%. Why? Oh, because now the site's up. Today's typical investor can now
use that goldfish memory and click right over and see it. And then click right
over to their broker and buy the stock. And the institutions, pathetically, are
playing the same game.

>>I am trying to locate a historical study or chart which shows the range of
S&P500
returns verses the P/E for the S&P500. In other words, what was the 5 year
range of
returns for the S&P500 from points in time when trailing P/E was around 10 --
compared to when it was around P/E 15. <<

One of the problems with a study of this sort is that the PE is affected by two
things; the price and the earnings. A high PE does not always indicate a high
price if earnings are temporarily depressed. That was the case in the early
90s. Similarly, a low PE could result from peak earnings and not indicate that
the market is cheap.

Heretic, Value line has numbers similar to what you asked for, I think. They
publish a summary of PE's for their universe of stocks every year. It's annual
data. I looked at it once to find some predictors, and was unable to do so. I
think the lag period (one year to the next year) was too long. The data
includes EPS, Dividends, Book Value, PE, P/Div, Bond yields, GDP, etc. In any
case, Value Line's info goes back to 1920. It is distributed annually and to
new subscribers.

Best,

Nice data Wayne. Two quick comments. 1 - If you want a valuation
measure that's stretched out of normal range, choose P/BV.
2 - OTOH, E/BV is much higher now then historical. Why?
Is it the shift in proportions from heavy industry to service economy?

higher now then historical. Why? Is it the shift in proportions from heavy

That's one of the big questions to me. Here are my thoughts as to why ROE is
higher. I think it's a combination of all the following and perhaps things I
haven't thought of too.

1. The asset values of software and some other technology-like companies are
understated because R&D is expensed. Just to be clear, I'm not arguing for a
change in accounting, but you constantly see companies in the business buying
each other's "R&D in progress" for a lot of money. These types make up a bigger
% of the indexes.

2. There were accounting changes for post-retirement benefits in the early 90s
that in some cases wiped out a large chunk of book value and effected EPS going
forward to lesser degree. This did not change the economic reality just the way
it was reported. (GM is the best example)

3. Some companies have leveraged themselves (on tangible equity) by buying
other companies for a big premium to tangible book. They are also using debt to
repurchase shares in amounts beyond free cash flow.
This reduces book value and raises ROE.

4. The bull market itself is contributing to the profitability of some
companies (banks, brokers etc..) and indirectly helping others because they
don't have to allocate as much money to pension funds due to the rise in fund
asset values.

5. Companies are writing down asset values more often. This reduces book value
and raises earnings as the depreciation charges going forward can be reduced.

6. We are late in the business cycle and this is somewhat typical.

7. There is a greater emphasis on profitability by corporate America and
pressure from Wall St to deliver.

8. Stock options are not expensed and are a growing form of compensation.

Off the top of my head that's the best I can do. I think some if not most of it
is not sustainable or accounting tricks. That's part of why I think we are very
overvalued.

Re: Stretched price / book value

I would argue that there has been much more writing down of assets in recent
years, to eliminate depreciation charges against future earnings, and in effect
misallocate costs to time periods in order to inappropriately boost earnings.
In other words, the "stretching" is as much on the BV side as on the price
side.

Bob,

>>I'm not certain, but I think buying back stock, a practice which is

If done from free cash flow it will have the effect of raising book value per
share.

A simple model: Assuming no reinvestment of earnings and all repurchases, we
would have the same net worth divided by fewer shares.

However, we now have a lot of companies borrowing money and repurchasing shares
at a substantial premium to book in addition to using free cash to do the same.
This lowers book value per share and often raises EPS. IBM is doing this at
present and Campbells is another that did it. There are many other examples.

Wayne, it is my understanding that dividends and share repurchases both
decrease aggregate book value. They are a return of capital and decrease the
equity. My accounting is not good enough for me to tell you what the accounting
transactions would be. I think it decreases the equity dollar for dollar (a
dollar repurchased is a dollar decrease in book value).

Wayne's right. If you are buying back shares above book value, then you are
decreasing your per-share book value. If you think about it a bit, it makes
sense. Similarly,buy shares at less than book value = increase per share book
value. WHX is a company doing this. And issue shares above book value =
increase per share book value. Berkshire is a company that did this.

So is CMO, which I think is acting great. There have been three block
transactions the last two days - 65,000, 80,000, and 35,000 shares, and I think
they all went off at the ask, whereupon a sizeable bid (over 100k) shows up. I

a nice re-initiation of their dividend. Comments appreciated.

Mike, I was talking about aggregate not per share book value and I was reacting
to Wayne saying about share repurchases:
"...we would have the same net worth divided by fewer shares." I don't think it
matters if the company borrows money, has free cash flow, or what the source
is. I think the repurchase of shares and dividends decrease aggregate
shareholder equity dollar for dollar. In the case where price per share is less
than book value per share, aggregate book value should go down by the amount of
the repurchase and per share book value goes up.

I may be confused about something, but there's some basis for what I'm saying.
I just wish I knew what it was <G>.

Book value declines with share buyback:
Basic accounting equation
Assets - Liabilities = Equity [Book value]
Let assets = 100; Liabilities = 40 then
100 - 40 = 60
What happens when we subtract 20 from assets [cash]to rupurchase shares?
80 - 40 = 40
Book value decreased by the amount assets are decreased.
In this simple example, if the company started with 60 shares and bought back
20 thus reducing the outstanding share count to 40 would the 20 bought back be
entered as treasury stock and thus there would still be considered 60 shares in
which case BV/share would decrease ...or would just the 40 in the hands of
external shareholders count in which case the BV/share would remain constant?

BOB,

Most companies repurchase shares from their free cash flow (which is a portion
of their earnings). Here's the point I was making.

Assume a company has $10 of book value per share at the start of a year and
earns $1 per share during the year.

If the company pays it out in dividends, book value per share will still be $10
per share at year end. No increase in net worth and an equal number of shares.

If the company buys back shares with it, the net worth that made up that $10
per share will still be present (the same), but it will be divided among fewer
shares. So book value per share will increase at year-end.

If the company buys back $2 worth of shares, (which is $1 dollar more than it
earned), the book value per share will depend on whether the shares are
repurchased at above book or below book. (the extra dollar is the key here)

The act of paying a dividend or repurchasing a share is always removing net
worth from the balance sheet, I was talking about start of year/end of year
book value comparisons. I hope I'm clearer now.

Now take that one more step and we've got it. The transaction also retires a
share. Book value per share is what we're trying to figure out. It seems clear
now that if you buy back shares above book value, BVPS goes down, and if you
buy back shares below book value BVPS goes up.

This would certainly be consistant with the decline in book value at Coke and
others. It is often the better performing companies that buy-back shares and in
recent years these puppies ain't selling below book.

More on book value. (not sure if clear yet)

I'm not so sure it is clear yet. I still think there is a slight
misunderstanding (but I could be wrong). First I think we need to clarify what
we are talking about. There are two ways of thinking about this and I think
based on the posts we are all not talking about the same thing.

First:

If you are talking about the snapshot in time act of buying back shares, this
will reduce book value per share if done at above book value and increase book
value if repurchased below book.

Second:

If you are talking about the act of buying back shares with the income that the
company is generating (this is what usually happens in practice) and comparing
book value per share at the start of year, to book value per share at the end
of the year, book value per share will increase at year end even if you buy
back those shares at way above book value. It will just increase LESS than it
would have if you just let the income pile up on the balance sheet.

If I start with $10 in book and earn $1 and use the entire $1 to buy back
shares, the ending book value per share will be higher than 10$ no matter what
price the shares were repurchased at.

If they were repurchased at below $10 then book value will be above $11. (10 +
1 + a portion of the discount)

If they are repurchased at above $10 final book value per share will be above
$10 but less than $11. (10 + 1 - a portion of the premium)

If the company accumulates the money, final book would be $11. (10 +1)

Coke rarely buys in shares with money that is in excess of the free cash flow
the company generates from operations. That being the case, even though they
are buying in shares at way above book value, book value per share will
increase each year. Just less than if they let the cash pile up on the balance
sheet.
