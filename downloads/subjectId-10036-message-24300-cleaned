Fwiw, I've reentered Time Warner (TWX) with a speculative buy.

Some value players have reported they own TWX because it's undervalued (they
say) on a sum-of-parts basis. The stock's gone pretty much nowhere in the past
three years, and if the business is undervalued I don't see an unlocking
catalyst. (There are some efforts being made to do something with the AOL
business. Maybe it will help.)

At current price, I'm just guessing and gambling the stock might be near a
short-term bottom (Who really knows?), and might see a small cyclical move up
(Again, who could really know?)

This is a good example of "Investor's" Psychology where forward expectations
are now positive. No difference in the tangible assets of the company. This is
typical for a value company that has hit bottom. The last 20%-30% in loss of
value is due to investors throwing in the towel.

The next significant gains will be where management can post a few quarters of

Other Events

Item 8.01. Other Events
In accordance with its previously announced growth strategy, Dynasil
Corporation of America ("Dynasil") has signed a letter of intent to acquire
another optical manufacturing company located in the Eastern United States.
Consummation of the transaction is contingent upon several important and
necessary conditions that may not be met, including completion of due
diligence, obtaining required financing from outside sources on acceptable
terms, and negotiation, execution and performance of a definitive acquisition
agreement, and related other agreements and documents. The proposed acquisition
candidate supplies optical components, products and services to markets related
to those currently served by Dynasil and its Optometrics Corporation subsidiary
("Optometrics"). Dynasil expects that, if consummated, the acquisition will
close at or before the end of its current fiscal year on September 30, 2006.

Hi Wallace - I am wondering if Home Depot is at this stage yet (it has hit a
new yearly low)? I have found that when good value companies hit five year lows
like TLB, they either were way over sold or go bankrupt like KM.

http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/commentary/observations.aspx?ID=16394

From the article:...Home Depot : Blue-chip retailer Home Depot (HD: View
sentiment for HDsentiment, chart, options) continues to suffer from technical
woes. The shares have declined under their 10-day and 20-day moving averages
since March 28, shedding more than 19 percent. What's more, the security has
logged only a handful of closes above both of these trendlines during this time
period. The stock caught my eye today because it has breached what should have
been strong support at the 35 level. Not only has this region buoyed the equity
on a number of occasions since October 2003, but it is also the site of peak
put open interest in the July series. This breakdown could result in some sharp
losses for the shares as they search for the next layer of support..."

I have started a small new position in HD but I have the feeling that HD may go
much lower because investors have not thrown in the towel yet (ie. the
psychological effect). I will buy more shares below $30 if the opportunity
becomes available.

I continue to hold DIIB, but I haven't added, since it has not dropped much
from my purchase price.

If you want to see something in real "downward spiral", take a look at LNX.
I've been adding a lot of it and this will possibly be my big stand against the
market. Either it's getting very cheap while the company's prospects are
improving (IMHHHO), or there is something I don't know and it's going to
collapse totally. Anyway, I would love to hear any feedback about LNX. It's a

Things to think about.

1. If you did not own any of the stock right now, would you buy it? if not --
then don't buy anymore.

2. If you would buy it now (question one), do you already own too much? If so
-- then don't buy it.

3. I did not even look at the stock. Your loss is already realized, but not
recognized. There are many other stocks to place a bet on. (Your gain on stock
B can offset the loss on stock A. It doesn't have to be a double sized bet on
A.)

PS -- sometimes I ignore rule number 2, if I just *know* the stock will go up.
i.e. If I bought something at $30, and then can buy it again at $27, I will.
Thinking that I will sell the $30 purchase very soon, when the price goes over
$30. But I must think it is a screaming "buy" at $27.

Suma,

We are recommending that our members hang on for a little while in PFE. The big
pharma names have been beaten down in for the last couple years. PFE is
throwing off a nice (and growing) dividend while you wait for the cap gains to
come back. Look for a 10-15% increase in the dividend this year. PFE throws off
a ton of cash and they just got a nice premium for their consumer products
business. Hank and the boys are also in the middle of a cost cutting campaign
that will save the company $4bil.

I am assuming you aren't looking to retire tomorrow or a week from now. The
paper losses can hurt the ego a little bit. If you sell and make them premanent
losses, they are going to hurt a lot more. Personally I own some shares myself
and I am in the same boat as you. I'm not going anywhere.

Hope this helps.

Hi Suma - I am in a similar situation with PFE as I own shares in both my IRA
and taxable accounts. Both are held w/ a small net loss but I am not worried
since PFE throws off a good dividend while I wait for management to add new
drugs to their franchise.

If you do not need the funds, PFE represents less than 5% of your portfolio and
it resides in your taxable account, you could do a tax loss sale for your 200
shares w/ a cost basis of $36, wait 31 days and buy these shares back at the
current price. You would lower you net cost basis and still maintain the same
ownership interest. You could then use the booked loss to off set against other
2006 equity gains of other 2006 portfolio income.

In the past (over ten years) large Pharma stocks demanded a 30 PE. PFE and many
of these drug companies have not been this cheap and now trade at PE's between
12-15.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=pfe%2cjnj%2cabt%2cmrk%2clly%2cbmy

Every diversified portfolio should have a core position of drug companies. PFE
ranks as one of my top five holdings in my IRA and ranks as one of my top 15
holdings in my taxable account. I repositioned my investment in drug companies
last year adding new names and upping my core positions. I have several
different cost basis in my taxable account but in the IRA it does not matter.
The dividend income generated by PFE in the IRA is used to buy stocks in other
sectors.

I plan to do no new selling (or tax loss selling) on my current PFE positions
but as opportunities arise, I have a list of new drug companies I want to add.
It's just a question if a value opportunity presents itself. PFE is the
cheapest of the group I watch and I consider it an excellent value buy at
current prices.

Finally, tax loss selling can be tricky as most investors wait until the 4th
quarter to net out their losses. That is why we typically see an October and
November sell off and then end of year rally. So if you are going to do the
sell and buy back after 31 days, I would suggest setting up the strategy during
the summer rally.

That's what I have been doing and it has worked out well so far.

EKS

FWIW - I am a long term holder of stocks and have positions that I have owned
more than 10 years. Some investors like to micro manage their accounts and are
not patient enough to hold over a business or economic cycle. Every time you
make a trade, you have a 50% chance of being wrong. I have been wrong many
times and there is no one correct answer to your question...only different
strategies to consider.

From:EL KABONG!!!
Hi Suma,

Let's talk first about Pfizer.

Their PE is down around 11 or 12, depending on the daily change in the price of
the stock. Their growth rate is only roughly half of their PE, so to consider
an investment in Pfizer, a potential investor should be looking at PFE as a
value investment, not a growth investment. With the PE down around 11, this is
at or very near the historic low for PFE, which (to me) represents a rare
buying opportunity based on value measures. (This presumes that one has enough
time remaining in one's life to allow for PFE's various multiples and ratios to
recover to historic norms, for both PFE and for the pharmaceutical industry as
a whole.)

Currently, PFE has roughly $23B in its cash coffers, not counting the roughly
$16.6B that they get from J&J for the sale of the consumer healthcare division.
Of the $16.6B, they get to keep maybe $13B or $14B after taxes and
sale/transfer expenses. They've already announced that they intend to use the
proceeds from the sale on a stock buyback (currently stated as about $17B,
meaning that some money will come from the coffers to reach $17B in total). The
buybacks will occur in stages throughout 2006, and are expected to be completed
in 2007. The buybacks should be sufficient (give or take a little) to offset
the revenues and earnings lost in the sale of the consumer unit, so don't look
for anything positive in the stock price from this sale until at least 2008
(again, give or take). Whatever remains of the $23B is an ample war chest to
fund R&D or make acquisitions, probably the best war chest in the industry.

On the upside, Pfizer has a plethora of new drugs at various stages of
development and approval somewhere within their pipeline for new drugs. Most
certainly they are way, way ahead of any competitors in terms of the sheer
numbers of new drugs making their way to market. Exhubera (sp??) is a new drug
for diabetics. Champix is intended to help people quit smoking. And Sutent is
another good prospect, this one in the fight against cancer.

On the downside, sales of Lipitor may crater because Merck's exclusivity on
Zocor will expire, as will B-M's Pravachol. As the generic versions of these
drugs enter the marketplace, sales of Lipitor may suffer as doctor's prescribe
the much cheaper generics to their patients. Sales of other drugs might also
come under pressure. So, not everything is fine and dandy. They win some, and
they lose some.

Overall, PFE should do very well into 2008 and 2009. Certainly, they are the
premier drug company to be investing in at the moment.

Now, let's take a look at Suma.

I glanced at your profile, and I see you're worried about the viability of your
own future, presumably based on your age. I'm guessing from your post that you
fear you may have insufficient time remaining in your life to wait for the
price of PFE stock to recover.

Well, here's the questions that you have to ask yourself.

Why did you buy PFE in the first place? Were the proceeds intended for your
use, or for the use of your heirs? If the answer is that the proceeds are for
your own use, does this money represent money that you need to pay the rent,
pay your bills and buy milk for the cat? Or is this money simply play money,
money that if it were in your pocket, you'd blow on the tables in Las Vegas? If
it's money you need, you should never had bought stocks with it, any stocks,
not just PFE. At an advanced age, you want "guaranteed" income, not growth or
value returns. Your money should be in fixed instruments. If, on the other
hand, the PFE money is to be left to heirs, then the question becomes, what
would they do with the money? Do they need it now? If so, stocks ain't the way
to go. The market could go into a secular bear cycle at any moment, and that
cycle could last for years. If the money is there for your heirs' future use,
say their retirement needs or maybe to pay for college for a grandchild, then
maybe there's enough time to wait for the price of the stock to recover.

What's your tolerance for risk? If the answer is low, then sell the darned
stock now, take your lumps and be done with it. Once burned, twice smart or
something like that. Rationalize the loss to yourself, whatever it takes to
live with it. We all make investing mistakes. Typically, our mistakes are
called "long term holds". <gg>

Getting serious again, if the price of PFE is affecting your sleep patterns,
then just sell it on its next rally.

I don't expect you to answer these questions in a public forum. They're
questions that you ask yourself. Don't lie to yourself, or try to fool
yourself. The only one who gets hurt is you.

Best wishes...

EK!!!

Just to throw one more idea out on PFE, only if you absolutely need to realize
a capital loss on the shares you own, yet still wish to maintain an equal
weight for potential appreciation in the sector:
Sell your position in PFE, and buy a like amount of another large cap pharma
which is equally beaten down.
I say this having no opinion on, and very limited knowledge of PFE, other than
it is one of the big guns in pharma, with the concurrent risks and
opportunities.
My investment style is such that, could I afford to, I would most likely
hold...it is way off its highs, pays a substantial dividend which is amply

As most of you point out, the dividend is good and I hope that my life

An alternative way to buy LOW below 25 is to write $25 put options against

bought LOW at a net cost of $24.40 or would have earned 11% in 3 months for the
$540 (20% x $27)equity tied up in marginig the position. 11% for 3 months
translated to 44% return per year.

Paul K. Blakely: I see FSS as a sardine too.

The stock does cycle. And it's at a low now. And historically at a low p/sales
ratio too. OTOH, profit margins, if they even exist now, have come down over
the past decade. Business seems to continually disappoint. (They cut the
dividend at least once.) I just wonder how many times a person can buy this
stock down here at 13-15 and reasonably expect somebody else to come along
later with hope enough in FSS to take the stock off their hands at 18-20 range?
OTOH, FSS is selling one of its businesses, so there is some positive
indications that maybe the company is actually (at last?) taking steps to
improve itself.

I'll watch the stock for a while. In this market where so many stocks of
companies with strong businesses seem so weak, I'm wanting to put my emphasis
on these rather than on a weak company whose stock is down in a weak stock
market. OTOH, for a small amount, FSS might be worth a small sardine gamble
again as a bet the stock cycles up again one more time.

Blankmind, whatever are your own political views, is entirely your own

I, or others, may not agree with you. If that is the case, then we would be
entitled to express our opinion in that regard.

However, that is far removed from the point I was making. As far as I’m
concerned none of us "owns" this thread, and as such, it is not the place of
anyone to tell others to "go elsewhere", "get out of kitchens", or any other
such misguided "instruction".

If anyone is posting comments, which are not in keeping with the generally
accepted subject matter of this thread, then I believe the Moderator should be
the person to take whatever action he/she deems necessary.

IMHO, it is not for you, or I, or, for that matter, Carl Worth, to issue
"instructions" to anyone on this Board as to whether they should come or go,
depending on the content of their thread.
I don’t know about you, but IMHO (once again), comments such as "take that BS

And in closing .... irrespective of what you or Carl Worth may think of me,
irrespective of what I may, or may not, have said in the past, shouldn’t alter
the principle of what I’ve said above. Either a thing is right, or it’s wrong.

If Book Value actually DID mean anything then SPF was a steal at 27, and WCI

I'll keep them as shorts as I am not quite THAT gullible :)

For folks who think book value is a good indicator (probably no one who posts

yet be adamant about staying short. An alarm bell should be going off in your
head saying "what do they know that I don't know?". They answer is that book
value is meaningless in this industry at this time. Book values are going to go

Seeing as DHI pays a dividend, one can calculate what its P/E should be when
comparing it to an investment at best Money Market interest rate.
Needless to say, if one could get a return of, say, twice or more from one’s
stock than what one could get at Money Market rate then one could say that that
was a good return.

DHI’s TTM EPS is $5.11c and its TTM DPS is $0.37c. The current pre-tax Money
Market interest rate of about 4% gives us a P/E of about 2.
DHI’s current P/E is $20.80/$5.11 = about 4.
This tells me that DHI is currently too expensive. To get to a P/E of 2 its
price would need to fall to about $10/share, which is $6 less than your target
of $16/share.

If one were to consider a pre-tax interest rate of 8%, we’d get a P/E of about
1, which is going in the opposite direction, and confirms that DHI’s current
yield is not that great.

It would be of interest to know on what you base your target of $16/share ?

I’d go along with your sentiments that "book value" is of no great value in
analysing a stock. Apart from the fact that, in the majority of cases, it’s an
historic number that may not have any relevance at the current time (consider a
prime property bought 5 years ago in low-lying New Orleans !), there is another
aspect that may be worth considering ....

If a stock’s price is currently $3/share and its "Book Value" is calculated at,
say, $4/share, then there are those who may state that they have a bargain.
But if this is a real Quality, "Value", stock, definitely worth having because
of the high standard of its Fundamentals, then what are the chances of one
obtaining that $4/share ?

To obtain $4/share the company would have to be "liquidated" and its Assets
realised. But how likely is that to happen, bearing in mind the current QUALITY
of the company and its current ability to make Profits, which is probably why
it’s being bought and sought after, and why its stock price is rising due to
demand ?
Is this a company that’s likely to fold and its Assets realised ?
Just a thought.

Of course, if the price were falling because of its poor Fundamentals, then
maybe "liquidation" is on the cards, and a realistic calculation of its Assets
may be a worthwhile exercise !

FSS is facing more competition I've heard, from overseas.

They sell a lot of their product like fire engines and street sweepers and such
to municipal and state governments, who unlike the feds, cannot run deficits.
That fact seemed a plus. And the economy has been pretty good the first six
months this year, with revenues pouring in at the fed level, presumably the
same conditions helped state and local governments. FSS also received an
upgrade to "market perform" from Barrington Research on June 26.

The Money Flow Index is also indicating FSS oversold condition.

Homebuilder stocks and book value predictions.

To state: "Book values are going to go down hard over at least the next four
quarters.", that is just an outrageous statement and a reason I'm no fan of the
quoted poster.

Book values have not gone down in a decade or more. And there's no evidence
that they will go down in this upcoming year.

As I see it, bv could only go down in the next year for a couple of reasons:
First, an earnings loss. AFAIK, no analyst is projecting losses for the major
homebuilders this year or next year. Poor earnings comparisons, drops in
earnings, yes. But losses? No. Secondly, there could be a write-off of assets,
esp. land purchases or specifically land option purchases. (Walking away from
these options.) This is not at all a certainty though. One thing is that
analysts have a hard time determining what land, where, at what price, at what
commitment, is on books. Some analysts believe that lots of land purchased in
the heady times of 2005 were overpaid for and have to be and will be, written
down. OTOH, there's land purchased in earlier years that's worth more than what
was paid for. So it's murky whether there will be writeoffs or writeoffs and
offsets with the earlier profitable buys, or no writeoffs at all, or if the
written-off stuff will be more than a small amount of the asset base (and more
than made up for by the earnings gains expectd). My ref. here: WSJ, "Land-Value
Erosion Seen as a Problem for Builders", 6/6/06.

I'm not saying that the stock prices of homebuilders can't or won't fall much
further. The stocks certainly could fall a lot further. However, to state so
bluntly that "book values are going down hard over the next four quarters" is
factually unsupportable. Poppycock imo.

You may be right about that Paul. It seems to me that any writedowns in book
value would happen EOY in any case. I do see writedowns more likely on exsting
inventory. Many builders are starting to accumulate finished product which
incurrs even more expenses. The HB's are doing everything but strip shows to
entice buyers. maybe that's already happening in LV for all I know. And the
outlook keeps getting worse.

lastly, I don't put much faith in analysts. They get paid to post pie in the
sky for the most part. Being in real estate and talking to builder reps from
large companies I am not encouraged by what i am hearing. The numbers are just
downright bearish.

Media stocks: As i stated before i recently sold my a fairly large position in
old VIA descendents CBS and VIA. CBS was more of an opportunistic sale, whereas
i have been just plain wrong about VIA.

VIA has the better cards of the two (IMO) but management is not concerned much
about shareholder value. No dividend ,stock is in the dumpster and Redstone is
talking about acquisitions - Geez! Growth rates for cable networks are in the
single digits and PE's are in the mid teens, which is and OK but not a great
value proposition. Secular threats are DVR's and more spending going online.
Both are likely to make the situation worse going forward.
The stocks are between a rock and a hard place - the growth rates are too small
for growth investors and the PE is to high for value investors. On the plus
side, we still have a business that throws of a nice cash flow. At some point
VIA may become interesting - based on what I see 30-31$ may represent a decent
entry point.

TWX is in a similar bind, but has no controlling shareholder and pays a small
dividend. AOL is a huge drag on earnings but ultimately could be a nice
recovery story. I'd say less than 15$ for a starter position sounds about
right.

Well, apart from the fact that DHI doesn't have a very good Dividend Yield, I
wasn't putting it forward on the basis of a "Dividend Play".

I was just indicating that it was, IMO, currently, relatively expensive based
on its P/E of 20, whereas it should be a lot less to be considered relatively
cheap.
In order to calculate that, with reference to what one could earn on one's
money in the finance market, one needs to have a Dividend earning company.

Many companies have been "strong ... with histories of growth and earnings".
But isn't it a case of what their current Fundamentals are showing us, that
assists us in our buying or selling decisions ?
But that's just my opinion.

Yes, interesting read. Perhaps there are many conclusions that could be drawn -
enough conclusions to support many different value styles or focus.

For example the (large-cap) good value guys apparently do beat on average the
passive large-cap benchmark. But not by much. But it could amount to something
substantial (by compounding) if such value players/funds were followed/bought
for decades or more. And there's the small-cap vs. large-cap factor. Plus not
all value guys beat either benchmark. And it could be iffy whether being in the
number one fund (FPA capital) in past, will be sufficient to beat the large-cap
benchmark going forward. And it's assuming it's even important for somebody to
be doing better than a benchmark. Benchmark 12% compounded over 10 years is
pretty darn decent for somebody with a good size retirement stash to be
invested.

I see some support for my style of investing by looking at things this way:

This is what the best value fund managers have in common apparently:

"Highly concentrated portfolios.
They don’t need to know everything, and don’t get caught in the noise.
&#183;A willingness to hold cash.
&#183;Long time horizons
&#183;An acceptance of bad years
&#183;Prepared to close funds"

But if small-cap benchmark can beat these guys, and the large-cap benchmark
comes close, maybe - instead of emulating the best value fund investors ----
aside: the author wrongly commingles best value investors with best value fund
managers. They are not the same thing. To wit, we've got value investors on
this thread and on SI who can best the best of the fund managers. --- anyway,
instead of emulating these fund managers people should - and I would be one who
does try - to emulate the "superior" benchmark (when I'm not trying to emulate
the best value investors on this thread -gg-). By emulating, I do not mean
buying the benchmark. I mean incorporating what the benchmark characteristics
are, namely:

Highly diverse portfolios
&#183;Not needing to know everything, and trying not to get caught in the
noise.
&#183;An UNwillingness to hold cash.
&#183;Long time horizons for purchased securities (i.e. just as companies
generally remain a long time in their benchmark index)
&#183;An acceptance of bad years.

Doing this imo, could bring an investor's results closer to the best of these
value fund managers. Maybe even surpass them and the benchmarks.

NAV. Thanks. Wasn't aware of this extent of the pension and healthcare
liabilities. I'll keep my NAV position very small.

Yhoo vs. Ebay. I don't see it as one vs. another. There are only about three
big profit-making internet companies - GOOG, YHOO, EBAY. I've tried to buy them
each when each has dropped. That does not seem to have been such a good idea
though.

YHOO and EBAY - you are correct that both companies are not competitors. I
wanted to point out with my post that the relative valuation of EBAY looks
better than YHOO even after the recent drop. LT the recent deal may even point
to a merger of both companies.
