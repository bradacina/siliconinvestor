I am not sure how much oil Iraq has, but once the war is over, and US and other
western exploration companies and allowed in, the oil production in Iraq will
double or triple.

If I was Saudi Arabia or Russia, I would be weary of Americans going into Iraq.
France also stands to lose valuable oil contracts it signed with Saddam
Hussein.

A new "hungry" supplier of oil will cause oil prices to fall.

The Saudis will have less money for themselves.

Iraq will have to triple oil production in order to pay for the reconstruction
of the country.The Iraqis are a well educated people. They know how to get oil
out of ground.

The question is over what time frame investment will flow to significantly
expand Iraq's oil production. It may take at least 5 years. Also, if the
expected returns are very high, oil companies may scale back other, less
attractive opportunities. So I'm not really sure that overall supply will be
boosted that much, in the short, mid, or long-term.

Spekulatius, I'll add a bit to my small position in BAX. Even though BAX cut
its earnings estimates, it will have a p/e of "only" 10, if earnings do come in
at the estimate (and if stock doesn't fall further).

Announcment of increased competition in key areas and further lawsuits and
government subpoenas relating to dialysis products are troublesome. Earnings
quality issues exist also - pension assumptions and stock options, according to

OT: I'll take my losses and exit my small position in ADP. I bought believing

announced today that earnings this year will be below last year. While I
understand that most businesses have ups and downs, and that payroll services
might suffer with so many companies cutting jobs, I bought ADP as a growth
business. And this year it will not be. Maybe next year growth will resume.
(Maybe it won't.)

For value plays, I'm more tolerant of holding through ups and downs. Holding a

Paul & Spek: I've been looking hard at BAX since it has many of the features
I'm drawn to in a stock: Collapsing price, deteriorating earnings/biz model,
excessive debt and 'interesting' accounting.
Here's an analysis of the 02 10k:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
03/12/03 JPM BAX $27.27 KEY TAKE-AWAYS FROM BAXTER 10K
* ONE-TIME GAINS. Management disclosed that the company recognized insurance
related reversals for its plasma-based therapy and mammary implant businesses
that benefited the company's SG&A ratio by 30 basis points in 2001 and 70 basis
points in 2002. The favorable insurance recoveries added 3 cents and 7 cents to
'01 and '02 EPS, respectively. Cash Flows Come Up Short. In 2002, the company
fell short of their operating cash flow objective of $500 million. Operating
cash flow came in at $427 million for the year, with continuing operations
generating $468 million while discontinued operations resulted in cash outflows
of $41 million.
* FACTORING RECEIVABLES. In 2002, the company continued its policy of factoring
out its receivables through a special purpose entity that is not consolidated
under GAAP accounting. In 2002, $721 million of receivables were sold through
this entity, compared to $683 million in 2001.
* 2003 CASH OBLIGATIONS. Baxter's contractual cash obligations in 2003 total
$1.15 billion, including the $800 million convertible debenture that is
puttable to the company this May. This does not include the company's remaining
equity forward purchase contracts, which amounts to $750 million, which
management has committed to settle in 2003. Baxter recently raised $600 million
through a notes offering and has a $1.6 billion line of credit at its disposal
to settle the equity forward contracts and the convertible debentures, should
they get put to the company.
* EQUITY FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS. As of December 31 2002, Baxter had
outstanding equity forward agreements related to 15 million shares, with a
weighted average exercise price of $49. Of note, the company was involved in
stock repurchases worth $1.17 billion in 2002, of which $1.14 billion were a
result of the settlement of equity forward agreements. In total, equity forward
agreements related to 22 million shares were settled in 2002.
* EMPLOYEE PENSION PLAN SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERFUNDED. With regards to Baxter's
pension fund related obligations, the company's accumulated benefit obligation
(ABO) for 2002 was $1.8 billion while the fair value of plan assets declined to
$1.2 billion. Consequently, Baxter's pension plan enters 2003 under-funded by
roughly $600 million. The timing of when Baxter would need to step up and fund
its employee plan with a cash infusion is unclear, but management indicated
that this is unlikely to occur in 2003. Anticipating the question of whether
this will occur in 2004, Baxter states "this will depened on future market
conditions." Of note, at year-end 2002 the company recorded a net-of-tax
reduction of $517 million to stockholders' equity, in order to establish an
additional minimum liability in the consolidated balance sheet for its defined
benefit pension plans.
* MANAGEMENT STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM CREATES OBS LIABILITY. The company's
liability related to its management stock purchase programs is $219 million.
Recall that this is a program that allows Baxter managers to take out loans for
personal share purchases with Baxter guaranteeing the obligation. The plan also
includes a risk-sharing provision whereby the company is responsible for 50% of
all losses incurred by the participants related to a stock price decline. In
view of the depreciation of Baxter shares in 2002, a loss appears inevitable,
though no liabilities to date have been recorded in relation to this program.
* EXPOSURE TO PREMIER. Of note, Management disclosed that sales to the hospital
buying group Premier comprised 8.9% of total Baxter sales in 2002. What
percentage of these contracts are sole source arrangements is not disclosed (IV
systems is one); however, Premier has stated its intention to substantially
reduce the number of such contracts in 2003. This could hamper Baxter share in
Premier accounts, most noticeably in the Medication Delivery business.
* ALTHIN DIALYZERS. Finally, the company has reached settlements with a number
of parties affected by the deaths of hemodialysis patients treated with
Baxter's dialyzers. Six civil lawsuits, however, are still outstanding and the
US government is investigating the matter. Baxter has received a subpoena to
provide documents. A government criminal investigation concerning the patient
deaths is pending in Spain.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Even with the 'Here come's the choo-choo' version, I'm having a tough time
putting a number on total equivalent net debt, but it looks like EV/EBITDA is
north 17 and possibly quite a bit north depending on what's included. Also,
forecasting the extent that high margin earnings can deteriorate in the face of
increasing competition is a really tough call even if you're wired into the
industry, which I'm not. After my experience with Elan and SGP, I'm inclined to
sit this one out so far.

confidence by bankers that they can support those assets with appropriate

This is possibly a stock one can rightly easily dismiss. And maybe it should be

nearly any bargain will have problems and if we don't see them we're probably

low a valuation for this company in this market. (OTOH, p/e's are coming down

I'm buying a little more BAX today as it goes to new lows.

Also, fwiw, I'm starting to build back my position in CAG today. Their history

to make "approximately $2.60 fully-diluted" for the year ending Jan. '04.
That's under 8x earnings for an aggressively growing company with established

The stock is cheap and I don't believe that Baxter is run by crooks. I like the

Hope so, just a little bit. -g-

Ref. your post here 3/3/3:

"Not exactly retail, but one I just found on a screening and I can't find
anything wrong with it. RACN.

Thay make replica racing cars, collectibles, harleys, construction vehicles,
agricultural equip, and other die-cast "toys". Expanding into action figures
and other more toy-like products. Good growth, no debt, great ROE, low PE.
Insiders sold a lot along with a stock offering awhile back, since then a
little insider buying. That's one negative, but manageable."

http://biz.yahoo.com/p/r/racn.html

Tried to get the production figures, but didn't see them. It's possible RACN
produces more cars than Daimler-Chrysler.
And being that those cares are collectable -- they might be better appreciated,
longer lived, and more of an investment than most DCX cars. -g-

On the serious side, it's also possible that RACN is the better investment.
(It's not a question of either or, so it's possible and I hope, both companies
and both stocks do well.) I just found it a little oddly humorous that when
bringing up "car companies" here, scrappy little RACN seemed to be more
attractive to me with its business and some of its numbers than beat-upon DCX,
with its billions in assets and hundreds of thousands of employees.

For now, I'm with DCX because I am hoping for some regression to the mean as
regards its stock price. I envision people world-wide continuing to buy DCX
products and I hope clever, innovative DCX management can tempt them with
appealing products. Ergo, an eventual stock recovery. (I hope.)

I'll put RACN on my watch list. I once followed (never owned) ATN which is also
in the motorsports replica business. I'll go look at that one again.

Paul, I tend to look at Price to Book, etc. ratios by adding in the debt to the
market valuation of the shares, and subtracting any excess cash. Even that may
not go far enough in making comparisons between companies, since the debt can
be toxic, and in a market like this can't easily be replaced by equity. If you
do this your auto company ratios will look a lot different. (I admit with this

re: your FDP: it might be a buy around current price. 

I don't trust low p/e because low reported tax rate. I don't like the
lawsuits/insider machinations which add to my concern about management.

However, price to stated book, very strong brand name, low ltd, moderate
dividend, aggressive expansion, low p/e indicate a buy.

Maybe a small amount within a diversified portfolio for somebody with patience
enough to wait for a turnaround in the stock.

I'll put it on my watch list. Not sure I want to get involved with FDP - other

MadHarry: MRN is nearly 50% owned by Warburg Pincus, fairly sharp guys, who
will likely use that position to make sure management's actions are shareholder
freindly. They recently bought more shares. As to the use of cash, MRN has more
opportunity than CCRN to consolidate by buying smaller outfits since it's
portion of the industry [non-travelers primarily] is more fragmented.
CCRN has some insider selling [at higher levels] and though the managmement has
substantial remaining holdings, the picture isn't as positive in this area as
MRN. Compensation at CCRN looks reasonable without excessive option activity.
It's really tough to nail down the integrity question other than by looking at

Jeff and Paul, the lack of insider buying and the financing on ALU remains just
as whacky as it was from the IPO. Additionally, the insurance claim is the
second time the company has filed a claim for fire damage. The first fire is
still an open arson investigation as is the second.

But, in looking for a what can go wrong here, I can't find it. The insurance
claim must be paid according to the policy, even if arson by a company insider
is discovered. The only difference in the payoff would be that without company
wrongdoing the payoff would be at sale price for the lost product as opposed to
payoff at company cost if ALU is guilty of foul play.

ALU has stated in press releases as well as in their recent CC that they will
file a law suit for loss of business due to the lack of payoff from the
insurance co. but no suit has been filed. One could surmise that a settlement
is near. If no settlement is imminent, then your caution is on the money.

I have owned MO off and on for about 10 years now. The litigation risk has

When you buy MO, you are paying for KFT and SAB Miller. Tobacco assets are
valued at close to zero.

The free cash flow from MO, allows MO to buy back shares and pay an 8%
dividend.

The two year bond is around 1.6%.

Do the math, and you will see that you can't lose unless Tobacco is banned in
2005.I think MO is a buy at $32 or under, and a sell in the low $50's.

I own MO now, and picked up some recently around $35.

I will buy more at $32.

DD: <<When you buy MO, you are paying for KFT and SAB Miller. Tobacco assets
are valued at close to zero>>The flaw in this thesis is that the liability
doesn't have to stop with the value of the tobacco assets. Many of the
companies bankrupted or nearly bankrupted by asbestos litigation had acquired
the liability by buying some tiny business way back when...in many cases the
liability arising from that purchase dwarfed the original acquisition. Consider
that asbestos production essentially haulted over 25 years ago and no one, as
far as I know, is accusing asbestos defendents of marketing to children or
intentionally misleading consumers...most were just using something that turned
out to be dangerous and they stopped using it when that was determined. By
contrast, the tobacco co's are easily portrayed as evil incarnate: Marketing to
children and misleading the public about health effects...in short, a target.
What's amazing isn't that they're under attack so much as that they've survived
this sort of attack for so long.
If it wasn't for tax, regulatory and litigation risks, MO would be a great
value, but to assume those risks away is to ignore THE critical element of the
investment picture.
Here's a quote from a fund manager that sums it up:
Kevin Rendino Merrill Lynch Basic Value Fund
http://www.thestreet.com/_tscs/funds/funds/957288.html
8. Every value investor out there has an opinion about Philip Morris (MO:NYSE -
news - boards), with that beaten-down stock price and the fat dividend. What's
your take?

Rendino: We've done a wonderful job of losing money in Philip Morris. When I
took this fund over [in July 1998], I actually sold out the position.

Philip Morris is always going to be a cheap stock. It's always going to have a
fat dividend yield. It's always going to look attractive on a price-to-earnings
ratio and a price-to-cash flow ratio. But you really DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED
IN A COMPANY THAT'S FACING A MYRIAD OF LAWSUITS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ANALYZE

Paul, I made 2 clear mistakes with HRC: After posting several message about a
year an a half ago warning of the potential of some capricious change in
medicare reimbursement seriously damaging the profit picture, I later ignored
my concerns and went in - This cost me about 70% on the initial purchase when
the reimbursement announcement hit. The second mistake was ignoring the clear
signal when Scrushy dumped stock [I beleive your comment at the time was
something like - 'I spit on him'] within a month of the announcement, then
steadfastly denied he had any idea that there would be any change in
reimbursement...This was Scrushy's way of announcing to the world that he was a
first-class, card-carrying WEASAL. Did I, at that time, trust him and his
managment team? Hell no! But I rationalized and stayed with the stock which
will probably cost another 80% from where it closed recently.
I realize it's difficult to get a bargain without some negatives, but one of
the negatives I'm going to be a lot less tolerant of is a management I don't
trust, whose interests [ownership] aren't aligned with mine, who acts in ways
detrimental to shareholders. In short, my weasal detector is set to 'sensitive'

factor in this shift, is decreased confidence in auditors - I'm coming to see

Study these for a couple hours and if you can't find HUGE red flags you're
going to get burned by the next HRC too.

The Wall Street Journal article last week basically said if the auditors
couldn't find it how could investors? B.S. When this dropped to 7 last
September I looked at it - and it took about 30 minutes to pass. And all I

2001 cash flow statement will save you a lot of money in the future because
you'll regognize it next time.

If you believe like the Wall Street Journal said that management executed this
fraud so well that investors were helpless you're missing a huge opportunity to
learn something big and avoid the next one. There are things in this company's

Paul, re: FAF, they showed up on a SmartMoney screen 3/19 for smaller,

I had been looking at competitor FNF, but FAF appears to have a lower beta and
better valuation (lower P/B, PEG, and Price/Sales) and dividend yield, albeit
both under 2%. FNF has a higher ROE and ROA.

As far as the refi boom being over, I have no way of measuring that, but last
night I happen to have dinner with an executive of one of the country's largest
lender and he told me the mortgage business is still screaming. (This was
before I looked into FAF.)

Snip from Zacks: FAF's fourth-quarter profit rose, helped by demand for real
estate-related information in a booming housing market. Net earnings were $82.2
million or $1.01 per share, compared with $52.3 million or 68 cents per share
in the same quarter last year. Analysts were expecting 93 cents. Revenues also
rose to $1.37 billion from $1.07 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Order
counts in their real estate-related businesses remain at elevated levels, which
should bode well for the company's results during the first half of 2003.
Analysts have raised EPS estimates for 2003 by over +13% over the past month,
and recently FAF announced that its board of directors has declared a regular
quarterly cash dividend of 10 cents per common share.

Allou Healthcare, Inc. and Its Lenders File a Lawsuit Against Its Insurers For
Failure to Honor Their Contractual Obligations Relating to Losses Suffered By
Allou in Warehouse Fire of September 25-26, 2002
Monday March 24, 10:59 am ET

BRENTWOOD, N.Y., March 24 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- ALLOU HEALTHCARE, INC.
(Amex: ALU - News), today announced that the Company and its lenders had
commenced litigation against certain of its insurers to compel payment in
respect of the losses Allou suffered as a result of the warehouse fire on
September 25-26, 2002. Joining Allou as co-plaintiff in the action is Congress
Financial Corporation in its capacity as agent and lender under Allou's credit
facility. Allou and Congress commenced this litigation in the State Supreme
Court of New York County against: Travelers Indemnity Company, Seneca Insurance
Company, Certain Underwriters of Lloyd's of London, Royal Indemnity Company,
Chubb Custom Insurance Company and Zurich American Insurance Company, all of
whom issued insurance policies to Allou.
The action seeks timely payment from the insurers of in excess of $100 million,
which are damages Allou suffered as a direct result of the fire. In addition,
the complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that the insurance policies require
immediate payment of the loss amounts to Allou's lenders without regard to any
defenses the insurers may attempt to assert to deny payment directly to Allou.

The complaint also states that all requests by the insurers in connection with
the investigation into the fire have been fully complied with, including
providing the insurers with over 48,000 pages of documentation and numerous
witnesses for examination under oath, yet, despite Allou's and Congress'
cooperation, the insurers have refused to timely pay the claims or to provide
any time frame for the completion of their investigation.

David Shamilzadeh, president and chief financial officer of Allou, stated,
"Allou and Congress jointly determined that legal action was required at this
time. I am pleased that Allou's management and attorneys are confident that the
outcome of this action will be favorable to Allou, its lenders and
shareholders."

He added, "In addition, the Company seeks damages for lost profits, lost
business opportunities, statutory interest of 9%, attorneys' fees and other
costs, which it believes will amount to over $30 million."

Founded in 1962, Allou Healthcare, Inc. is the premier distributor of over
22,000 nationally advertised health and beauty aid products, branded and
generic prescription pharmaceuticals, prestige designer fragrances, cosmetics
and branded non-perishable foods. Through its wholly owned subsidiary Stanford
Personal Care Corporation, the Company manufactures upscale hair care and skin
care products. Allou's account base consists of 4,200 independent drug and
convenience stores and the leading national chain stores.

ALU: when insurance is paid the stock could rise based on the large monies
received. OTOH, companies are also valued as on-going businesses. ALU has
sustained two significant rare events - those fires. (and each apparently
tainted with suspicious causes) I just wonder what insurance company would
reasonably insure ALU a third time, so I question the assumption of ALU
remaining as an on-going business.

I could be wrong but I'm betting now that there are better and safer investing
opportunities elsewhere.

However, I agree with Jack. I don't see any RED flags. Yes, ROE is only 5%,
yes, D/E is ~1, yes, the earnings cover interest payments only 2:1. I would not
buy a company with these ratios, but are these big red flags? Not for me. So I
must be missing something. :-( I have some wild guesses, but I don't think I

ALVR: Under Cash, no debt, trending up.

This company is in a niche market of Broadband Wireless Access. The last round
of telecom crash drove WCOM, Sprint PCS and other big players out of this
market. ALVR is the leader and trading under cash.

Technically (chart) the stock is trending up. Built a base at $1.85 for the
past half year. Volume dried up lately while stock moving up slowly seemed to
suggest that the selling had gone thru its course. My GTC buy order for 5000
shares at 1.92 was filled yesterday (3.5% drop in DOW, NASDAQ). I believe
buying below $2 is a steal.

HRC hints. This is a great opportunity to learn forensic accounting.

I think it was Charlie Munger who said anytime a company goes bankrupt you
should look at the financial statements from a year or so before when the stock
was still high and see if you can learn something.

I'm not claiming that anybody could have concluded fraud, but you're just
looking for red flags here to train yourself to recognize them next time.
Rarely does one know something is a fraud until it the stock is at 3 - but just
knowing a cash flow statement has the signs of one is enough to just not
invest. (I was never short HRC, although now of course I'm kicking myself.)

Don't expect to find red flags on the income statement - thats what these kind
of managements are trying to make look pretty - focus on the cash flow
statement.

(And remember, the reason to own this in 2002 both before and after the first
blowup was twofold - the dumb investors got burned because "it always beats
estimates". The smarter ones got burned because they bought it for the free
cash flow.)

Look at free cash flow. Cash from operations minus capital expenditures. Thats
how you calculate it, right? What is wrong with that analysis? Trust me,
understanding HRC's 2001 cash flow statement will save you a lot of money in
future investments and it will be a great use of an hour of your time. I'm not
going to tell you the answer - the value comes from doing the work to find it
yourself. Just go through each line of that cash flow statement, all the way to
the bottom, and think about what they mean.

How can you say that? HealthSouth said a few days ago not to analyze its
financial statements since they are inaccurate.

HRC had significant Off Balance Sheet activity. For example, the PV of its
Operating Leases is around $1 Billion as of 2001.

Next, look at their restructuring charges. Plenty of hits to the PP&E line item
which somewhat implies that HRC could've been taking as a one time charge
future Depreciation Expense. Therefore, since this is a "one time" charge,
future Operating Income should be higher since its Depreciation Expense is not
fully recognized.

What everyone forgets is that it is quite easy to be a "Monday Morning
Quarterback"

From:Jurgis Bekepuris
James,

OK, let me take a stab. :-) I'd like to hear your comments on my attempt even
if you think that I should not try to analyze another financial statement in my
life and should quit investing tomorrow. :-0))))

OK, cash flow statement. Let's assume the "Net cash provided by operating
activities" correct. Then, it seems that the net income could have been
inflated with the last two lines ("Accounts payable and accrued expenses" and
"Inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets"). They changed
significantly from 2000. I don't know why, so I can doubt them. If we set them
to 0, the net income becomes approximately 150M loss or 20M gain if we add back
the 170M loss on sale of assets (is this a one time loss?).

I don't think "Provision for doubtful accounts" change since 1999 is a red
flag, since it corresponds with the similar change in AR. Maybe I am wrong.

I don't know what "provision for deferred income taxes" is but since it
decreases net income, I don't change it. :-)

Now, for the free cash flow. It seems that from 670M "Net cash provided by
operating activities" you have to subtract 440M "Purchases of property, plant
and equipment". Then comes tough part - what else? I would guess "Purchase of
limited partnership units" 48M, "Changes in other assets" - hell knows what
that is - 80M, and possibly "Payment of cash distributions to limited partners"
- 63M. Which gets to 39M "FCF".

BTW, which line(s) in the statement of cash flows account for the payment of
interest on debt?

That's pretty much what I saw. If you don't want to spoil the fun of digging
through 10K for others, you can comment on my observations through private
message.

Thanks

Jurgis - did I get an F?

I traditionally have viewed value a bit more loosely than folks here. For
example, I typically have little interest in a stock selling at a discount to
cash if the core business is essentially worthless, and causing the cash to
shrink. I especially like to take things like quality of management, market
position and new products (and their market potential) into account.

In particular, my current market thesis is that the general economy is
uncertain and may remain so for years. Therefore, there is no inherent reason
that a traditional value stock may not just sit there like a log. Any stock I
buy today must be experiencing a major increase in Served Available Market
(SAM), such that there is every reason to believe that the company can perform
well under almost any circumstances.

In my opinion, FARO ($2.71) is such a (microcap) company, offering both good
value and terrific potential. If anyone is interested I suggest the following:
-read Q3 report
-listen to Q3 conference call
-read Q4 report, out last night,
-listen to Q4 conference call, which took place at 11 AM today,
-read my various recent posts on YAHOO (under jeffbas)
-read SEC filings as you see fit
-note Insider holdings and recent purchases
-note recent 5% SEC filing by Hummingbird and update adding more shares.

http://www.faro.com/Company/Investor_Relations.asp

Note the stock is thin and was up a good amount on heavy volume today on both a
good report and conference call. I would have to rate the 45 minute CC as one
of the best I have ever listened to as to management performance, value of
content, quality of interest and questions from institutional holders, and
quality of answers.

Disclosure: I have bought a decent amount recently between $2.20 and $2.50. In
view of the sudden runup, it would not surprise me if it falls back, in this
market. However, I also have no problem thinking of this as POTENTIALLY a $25
stock in 3-5 years, as a result of increasing sales to perhaps $100 million and
earnings to perhaps $1.50 per share aftertax (on excellent 60% "leadership
position" gross margins).

James Clarke HRC: I put this list together prior to reading any posts after
Jim's 'challenge'
Possible Red flags:
Balance sheet:
Inventories +21% vs 4% Rev increase [Inventories are more concerning in a
retailer or wholesaler than in a service co like this, yet it is still a red
flag.
Net Accounts Rec looks OK, but the allowance for doubtful accounts jumped -
raising that allowance is generally more conservative - it decreases income,
but volatility in that allowance bears watching - I'd be looking at the
footnotes to see why.
Prepaid Expenses & Other Current assets +54% vs 4% Rev increase - OCA is
potential slush bucket -
These led to a 21% increase in current assets, but were still only a 2%
increase in total assets: Revenue and earnings overstatements lead to increases
in asset accounts[or reductions in liability accounts], yet overall, total
assets only grew modestly...inline with revenues.
Payables all dropped substantially from -54% for AP -20% in Accrued interest
payable & other liability another slush bucket and the largest of the payables
accounts. Offsetting this is HUGE increase in deferred income taxes indicating
a mismatch between financial statements and tax reporting.
Overall, internal accounts seem rather volatile and several of the items would
make me want to dig deeper.
Income Statement:
Revenue and operating expenses look fine - slow growth, in line with one
another. SG&A took an outsize jump of 13% form 00 to 01, a bit worrisome, but
not indicative of fraud...just poor cost control at hq.
The doubtful accounts provision took a huge drop 99 to 00 effectively juicing
income - I'd be looking for 'splaining in MDA on that.
Substantial one-time charges/losses in both 99 & 01 that analysts might
ignore...are they a serial restructurer?
Cashflow statement:
The big changes in allowance for doubtful accounts flows thru from above.
Large mismatch between PPE change on BS [-97mm] vs investment in PPE on
cashflow statement of 440mm, or 235 mm if the 'non-strategic assets sold were
PPE assets - This looks pretty red flaggish, but I'm not sure how to interpret
it - It should have caused me look further though.
How'd I do, Professor Clarke?

Started CAG today @19.12. EV/FCF 9.9, dividend & Brands are attractive. The AHO
'collusion' article in WSJ was denied by CAG, but may produce further negative
newsflow - my guess is that the nobody in this industry will qualify for
sainthood and there may be some revelations that result in handslaps to
cooperative suppliers, but nothing earthshaking...nothing like AHO will emerge.
SPE's mentioned in filings: IR indicated SPE exposure, if they were to bring
them back on balance sheet would be roughly 200mm, so no biggie. I ran EV/FCF

Steve168 Predict WWCA bankruptcy soon.

If you want to avoid next HRC by learning to analyze 10K, check out the latest
10K on WWCA.

This wireless phone provider is losing money fast, negative book value $5, yet
management was saying "we have positive cash flow 6 years in a row". The
positive cash flow was generated by $200M new debt a year. I believe they are
in big trouble, likely bankruptcy in 6 months - 1 year, the catalyst is a new
debt repayment starting 3/31/2003, $100M in 2003.

Bob does it through the balance sheet. Jurgis and I did it through the cash
flow statement, but those two analyses are mirror images of each other and get
to the same items. I like Bob's term "potential slush bucket" - I hadn't
thought of it that way, but thats exactly what these turned out to be.

Bob's deferred tax observation is one I missed - thats a great point.

Add to that the accounting for the minority interests on the cash flow
statement - study that carefully - you'll see it occasionally and it fools a
lot of value investors who think they are being disciplined in looking at free
cash flow instead of EBITDA or earnings. It is impossible to detect in screens
or ratios - you have to scrutinize the cash flow statement very carefully to
spot this little trick.

Of course this is Monday morning quarterbacking. The point of this exercise is
the same reason we investigate airplane crashes. Obviously the reason we're
investigating that particular plane is that it crashed. The goal is to learn
something from it to avoid future crashes. Whether or not one owned HRC,
analyzing it in hindsight is a great way of honing our skills at recognizing
value traps. Hope you got as much out of this review as I did.

The real Monday morning quarterbacking is when a company like this tells you
with the stock trading at 10 cents not to rely on past financial statements.
How ironic is that after reading Bob's analysis?
