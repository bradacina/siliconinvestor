Mico, there is a plan and signs of life at IMN. From what I see there is
something going on and you're getting that something at a cheap price....about
fifty cents/share.

Don't know a thing about gaining market share in their target niche though, so
I pass for now.

From their last earnings report:

<<u>During 2011 we committed substantial investment</u> in secure and scalable
storage products to complement our Defender line of secure storage products
with the acquisitions of the Encryptx security solutions for removable storage
devices and removable storage media from BeCompliant Corporation, the secure
data storage hardware business of IronKey Systems, Inc. (IronKey), the portable
security solutions and technologies of MXI Security from Memory Experts
International, Inc. and certain intellectual assets of Prostor Systems and Nine
Technology. <u>With these investments, we have expanded our offerings</u> of
encrypted and biometric USB drives, encrypted and biometric hard disk drives,
secure portable desktop solutions, and software solutions, including products
which contain various security features such as password authentication,
encryption and remote manageability. With our acquisition of ProStor Systems'
InfiniVault data-archive appliance and related technologies for our scalable
storage portfolio, we've added a new portfolio of data protection and data
archive appliances designed to help data-intensive, compliance-driven small and
medium sized businesses retain, retrieve and recover valuable data. We are
moving beyond removable storage offerings to a portfolio of appliances designed
specifically for the storage needs of small and medium businesses. We
anticipate revenue from secure and scalable storage products to grow during
2012 in all of our regional business segments.

Audio and video information product revenue comprised 15.0 percent, 15.3
percent and 15.9 percent of our total consolidated revenue in 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. During 2011, we rationalized our product lines by exiting
certain products which were not achieving adequate gross margins, such as TVs,
video players and gaming. Our new audio and video information products are
designed to provide consumers with a unique, high quality user experience. We
anticipate revenue from audio and video information products to grow as a
result of new product offerings during 2012 in all of our regional business
segments.
<u>Overall, we expect revenue in 2012 to decline when compared with 2011. As we
exit 2012 and enter 2013, we target the Company to return to growth. Further,
we target long-term future revenue growth rates of 3 to 5 percent. We are
targeting 2012 revenue from our recent acquisitions of approximately $45
million to $50 million. We are targeting gross margins moving towards 20
percent in 2012 with long-term future gross margins of approximately 20 percent
or more. We estimate research and development expenses in 2012 increasing to
approximately 2 percent of revenue. We project selling, general and
administrative expenses in 2012 of approximately 17.5 percent of revenue and
then decreasing over time as revenues grow. We anticipate operating income
excluding restructuring and other charges to be flat in 2012 compared to 2011,
with long-term annual operating income targeted at 4 to 5 percent of
revenue</u>.
We target revenue from traditional storage products in the future to decline at
an annual rate of 14 to 18 percent with stabilizing gross margins. We target
revenue from secure and scalable storage products to grow 15 to 30 percent due
to leveraging our recently completed acquisitions in mobile security and
scalable storage and the developing RDX market. We target revenue from audio
and video information products in the future to grow 5 to 15 percent with gross
margins increasing overtime to approximately 20 percent. We are targeting
future gross margins over time to improve to in excess of 20 percent. >

Thanks for the heads up. This purchase is in the taxable account and replaces
my earlier PBR sells. I used the proceeds to buy into Canada and now Europe
(TOT). Hopefully at a low enough McDep ratio that the Foreign Tax will be small
compared to the total potential long term capital gain.

My last Integrated Oil buy based on a very low McDep ratio was COP in 2009 at
$45. TOT also has quite a bit of NG reserves which is in large demand from
Europe. I believe Clownbuck mentioned in an earlier post that TOT has a low
cost royalty structure for their NG & Oil reserves that at the margin allows
them to be more profitable on their higher cost unit sales.

PBR and all their new (and proposed GOV) taxes is just losing it's value
proposition for me. My big concern is w/ all of this QE by the US and the Euro
countries, foreign currencies are all over the place causing large losses
and/or gains that artificially impact these oil company's current & future EPS.

So my thought is owning companies located in Canada, US and Europe (ie North
Sea), the overall currency exchange rate effect translated back to earnings
should hopefully balance out. These large integrated oils hold reserves all
over the world and incur expenses in all types of currencies depending where
their operations are located. This should also help balance out these currency
exchange gains/losses.

I still have an over weighted Oil & NG portfolio. Australia mentioned charging
a "resource tax" and PBR now has their Foreign Investment Tax. I am afraid that
many other countries will follow w/ their own new tax. All of these extra taxes
& fees disrupt the value proposition and make it hard (for me) to compare
similar investments.

re PBR - I think the bigger issue with PBR is that the Brazilian government
uses PBR as a tool for industrial development. Also, the environmental lawsuit
with CVX in Brazil for a minor spill gives me pause, I suppose if something
major would go wrong with PBR, the company would be entirely nationalized and
foreign investors would be out of their money. Given the technical ambitious
deepwater wells, the chance of this happening are definitely significant.

Even if the PBR's deepwater gamble pays off, the return for shareholders is
probably moderate, since the resources are expensive to develop, as I remember,
PBR shareholder paid ~8$/brl for unproven reserves and they will cost ~20$/brl
to develop.

If you buy TOT, you can buy proved reserves for about 15-20$/brl plus a host of
other assets for free, so why bother with PBR. As for foreign currency issues,
for E&P companies that is just noise, crude trades for USD and that is all that
matters, the hedging gain and losses are just accounting noise, unless the
company gamble on futures.

I own quite a bit of TOT already, purchased at lower prices. I recently sold
1/4 of my position at 56$ - so if it falls below 50$, I am likely a buyer
again.

Joined you for a tracking position in IONAF. MY GTC order got filled at $0.495.
Hopefully in 18 months they will have discovered lots of NG, w/ NG well above
$5/mcsf and everything is good again. For me it's a value play and may take
time to pay off.

FWIW, doubled up on my XCO position. My strategy is somewhat similar but I have
bee selling the June $8.00 covered calls on any rally (my last batch I sold for
$0.75). The option premium reduces my cost basis and allows me to buy more
shares as the stock falls in price. Even as NG falls to 10 year lows, XCO has a
valuable asset in the ownership of their Midstream pipeline operation. If cash
flow gets really bad, they will sell this. On that action, I probably want to
close out the position. Currently the position is still quite small.

So, both buys are speculation that (for me) NG is historically cheap and buying
both of these names allows me to play on this theme.

Warning, I have been wrong in the past and will also be wrong in the future. I
could very well be wrong w/ this investment theme. Just don't bet the ranch.

Not meant as a personal attack, just don't understand the logic.

<I honestly think the bottom is closer if the same analyst (who apparently has

This particular analyst has expressed caution in his rating analyses and has
based his numbers on BHI's guidance. Both times the target was lowered in
response to BHI's outlook.

This is the latest round:

<Credit Suisse’s B. Handler lowered his price target from $62 to $56 and
downwardly revised his earnings estimates. Handler nonetheless <u>reiterated
his Outperform rating on the stock, but admitted it was only for patient
buyers</u>, <u>given the company’s recent problems</u>. ” <u>We admit the story
has changed underneath us</u>. The value we see now is more about self help in
the U.S. as the BJS franchise finally gets fixed and optionality on a recovery
in pumping momentum later in 2012, as well as the grinding higher of margins
internationally and eventual reduction in BHI’s cost of growth. We do have
conviction that BHI has identified its operational shortcoming and is taking –
and will take more of – the steps to better manage information, distribution
and its assets. >

Management has not delivered on their projections and this occurs quite
frequently when new management takes over. Might as well clear the deck and get
a fresh start.

A stock is not automatically a value play when it hit's a (52 weeks?) bottom
but it's a good place to start looking imo. In addition, I have looked at the
chart and noticed that BHI has bounced off several times in the 37-38$ region
in the past. I also think it is fundamentally start to look fairly cheap there
and discounts quite a bit for the lack of management credibility.

Wether it's hold the 37/38$ line is impossible to say but at that point I am

UBS Key Call: Baker Hughes Inc.
Another cut to our 2012E EPS
?? After another round of conversations w/ BHI we are further trimming EPS
We are lowering our 2012 EPS estimate to $3.46 from $3.72, following a more
lengthy conversation with Baker Hughes. Our 2013 estimate is unchanged at
$4.48.
?? Further updates to our forecasts stem from:
1) We further lowered our Q2-12 NAM margin to 10% from 12.8%, reflecting
both the Canadian seasonal decline, price weakness in frac across the US
basins,
and continued logistics issues. 2) Q3-11 we are forecasting margins of only 12%
under our assumption frac pricing pressure accelerates and the logistical
issues for
BHI are not fully rectified. 3) BHI has at least 350 basis pts of self help on
the
logistic issues; however we do not expect it to be recovered until late-2012.
?? Other key points:
1) We believe the issues w/ BHI are 50% specific to BHI and 50% overall
industry
conditions. 2) Any reduction by BHI in new frac capacity would only impact Q4-
12. 3) However, the company will continue to add frac in 2013 given the
long-term
attractiveness of shale. We believe the other large companies will also
continue to
add capacity in 2013. This will keep margins under pressure. 4) We believe the
frac markets are balanced today. 5) Pricing in oil basins is beginning to
become
under pressure and will grow, in our view (Permian, Bakken, etc).
?? Valuation – Trading at 34% discount on new EPS to 10 yr average
As we have been saying for some time, industry conditions will worsen before
they
improve. Current valuation reflects weakening fundamentals. However, we believe
the pressure pumping capacity issue will continue to overhang the oil service
diversifieds over the next several quarters. Our $60 price target is based on
~13x
2013 P/E target multiple.

Bottom fishing for value stocks makes sense. You simply have to find the reason
for the sell off and if you can discount the cause you have found value. When
the entire sector is hitting new bottoms as is the case with BHI, the reason is
not applicable solely to this stock as the market sheep mentality takes over.
Why not just move aside and let the market participants play their role?
There's no rush here.

Slumping stocks tend to over extend the drop off as do stocks hitting new
highs. I look for a huge vol. increase to indicate when the trend is exhausted
and ready to reverse, but that is technical analyses. On value analyses, the
price on the chart has no relevance as far as I can tell other than reversion
to mean comparisons relative to stock price ratios.

Keeping an eye on NG storage availability, facilities are currently at over 60%
full. With a mild summer expected, storage capacity will be tested. Maybe a
good investment angle is storage tanks?

Hi Paul -

I was thinking since NG hit a 10 year low today and w/ all the new NG wells
drilled and operational (note: NG drilling Rigs are now at one of the lowest
levels in years), there could be storage constraints for all of this new NG
coming online. GAS, ATO & MDU operate the largest NG storage networks in the
US, so that is a net positive for these companies.

Do you think it is economical for any of these coal companies to convert their
mines into below ground NG storage reservoirs? Generally they convert old salt
mines and that is what MDU and GAS own. Perhaps there is another hidden value
in these old coal mines.

The good thing about coal is that it can be exported when consumption is low
locally. China for example is the largest producer with over 3 Billion tons,
which is 3 times larger than US. It also is the largest imported of coal of
~500million tons. The energy intensity of china's growth( energy needed per
extra unit of GDP) should provide BTU with sales going forward. China GDP 7.5

On coal & Nat gas- EKS, i did not realize they are converting part of mines as
storage facilities! thats something new I learned today. However, you are
correct that with current storage capacities relatively full there is not much
room for storage and hence there is a fear that costs are going to fall futher.

However, Paul is correct - fed. govt. favors natural gas and its also much more
eco friendly. I was reading somewhere that the use of coal in energy production
is going down and getting replaced with Nat gas -however its a slow process.

On China - China contains 3rd or 4th largest Nat. gas reserves in the world,
however they don;t have the technology. Instead of trying to buy coal
producers, supply coal into china ( which is not that bad in short term), you
guys are better off investing in companies that are going to go into china with
their natural gas technology and produce it. They will be making tonnes of
money in the coming year or two. The process has already started!

I sold out my shares of pnx and took a 20% profit and turned it over to SBSA, a
Hispanic media company that is the largest in the country.Year end earnings out
tomorrow and they should be stellar as pre told of sales in January. Bought and
sold trading shares today. Hugely undervalued at this PPS and when sales
numbers announced it hit $7.00 in January. Target of $10.00 and also a takeover
candidate, even with huge debt/equity numbers as the Hispanic segment is

Hi Nik. Check out Barron's Dec. write up on Coinstar. Their conclusion is that
America loves a bargain and as long as Coinstar offers the lowest cost
alternative, they will continue to be a winner.

Enjoyed your write-up and although some things have changed since the Barron's
article came out, I thought you might enjoy their point of view. I have no
position or opinion on Coinstar.

Just do a search for Coinstar Barrons for the article.

Sergio, thanks for the article. To show you how foolish I am, I actually owned
shares of CHK at the time of the margin calls - what I remember is seeing him
buying the shares at higher and higher prices and thought the guy knows what
he's doing. Overall, we have to admit the guy is smart being able to flip land
like this, but unfortunately the gains have not gone to the shareholders. I
remember reading that Ray Kroc considered McDonald's primarily as a real estate
business. Recently there was a whole section in the WSJ on fracking:

Sergio - thanks a lot. I def. will. However, without even reading the article,
I can tell you that you are correct about low pricing. One of the main
conclusions I have come up among few others is that CSTR will get squeezed if
it continues with its low pricing strategies and there are reasons to it -

For example - their relationships with studios, where not only their content
costs are increasing, but their relationships with wholesalers ( one of the
main pillars supporting their low cost strategy) is also changing making it
costly for them to acquire titles. Wholesaler relationship is something thats
not understood by lot of people or talked about, but is very pertinent to the
firm.

If the catalysts i am highlighting pan out, then the very basis of Barron's
article will be blown away and you will see the share price coming down.

However as I have stated, it might be too early to take a short position. So if
you want to, you might wait it out a little bit and then buy long term puts or
atleast thats something i will do, after the price crosses $70 a share.

I have been holding off too. Still like their distribution system (looks like
that part is worth $3.50/share), they own a lot of real estate and FCF still
positive which is used to pay down debt. No large debt payments as they
restructured their obligation out through 2014 & 2016.

The one problem I do see is a lot of Put options at the $6.00 and $5.00 that
tell me dividend may be cut and/or smart money (could be the shorts) looking to
have shares at lower levels. I may nibble at some shares once I see that lower
lows are hit on lower volume.

No need to rush in as I believe the opportunity will still be around in 2-3
months (or longer). Maybe the low is representing end of quarter value
investors throwing in the towel.

FWIW...peeled off shares for CVX, CNX, COP, VOG; closed positions in: GST,
USEG, GASS, COR, EKCS. Doing my own end of quarter house cleaning. Building my
cash position the largest since 2008.

My E&P basket is now 12 companies strong and shows a 21% gain since inception.

I am getting very cautious expecting a significant pull back considering all
the world events (more riots in Spain last night). Cash may be the best short
term value hold if bargains persist again like in 2008.

SOF.BR - for those that like obscure holding companies like GBL.BR (who doesn't
<g>) , Sofina (SF.BR.) may be worth a look. Sofina holds a bunch of investment
in public companies like Suez, Delhaize, Mersen in addition to some unlisted
companies, hedge fund investments etc and some net cash..

The attraction is the discount to liquidation value: Book value is 3.8B Euro
(valued at market, I believe) with 35.5M shares outstanding, which is about 107
Euro/share. There does not appear to be any debt. The shares are currently
trading for 60 Euros, which is quite a discount.

For those who understand french, here is the latest report from August 2011.
http://www.sofina.be/pdf/CFR20110826.pdf

Their reporting is quite terrible, but I think they are decently managed. Some
of unlisted investment look interesting, they own a stake in a company offering
fishing baits and lines that seem to be very profitable for example. They do
buy back shares little by little and pay a dividend.

welcome aboard. I listened to the MIL conference call . Mr. Smith seemed pretty

model his company after Nobel Trading of HK, and that that was what he was
aspiring to. Sounds to me like he hopes to stay with the company for at least
another decade or two. He again stressed that what he liked to do when
purchasing an asset was not by enriching the existing owner but by putting
money into the project and growing its value. That was music to the ears of
this value investor/speculator.
CMP-un.to continues to sell at about 35% discount to NAV.

Despite the decline in AAB.to they acutually sold one of the temujin propects
to another company for 20 million share worth around $6.6 million with another
15 milliion shares possible depending upon how much gold is discovered there.

Started a tracking position last month in HSP (Hospira); I give up on it now,

I like TEVA at current price, and I'm in for a few shares.
1) IF the consensus analyst expectation for earnings is correct, the forward
(12/'13) p/e is 7.5 on current stock price. That would make the stock very
inexpensive in my view. (Assuming too that '14 earnings won't be down.)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=TEVA+Key+Statistics
2) Teva has a strategy to grow by acquisitions. I generally don't like this
idea, because it places the the acquiring company and its stockholders in a
position of presuming the acquirer can manage acquisitions better than the
managers who are already in there. However, I do like the idea of borrowing at
very low rates to take advantage of current opportunities. Gutsy moves in
fearful times.

I think Groupon is a rock in a hard place, yes they are growing and expanding

Not to be over simplistic here...... But, personally i think Groupon has huge
problems besides its accounting, daunting relationship with its customers,
overvaluation, huge operating losses etc, but people who are like me, go out
alot and use groupons are using them less and less... its almost considered
tacky now to even think about using a groupon. Especially at cool places here
in dallas, ive heard my friends talk negatively about it multiple times. I dont
even look at them anymore when they come into my inbox and i have a feeling im
not the only one fwiw.

OTOH, I have been doing a little homework on Pandora to short. I am finding no
place to put my money to work right now really, so looking for some shorts..

I don't know if personal experience is any measure to consider when you are

have never used it too, but my friend is using it constantly - yoga, nails, bla
bla bla. I bought a pandora bracelet for my wife and her bracelet costs about
500$ already. I havent looked at the numbers of pandora, but I see a few women
of different ages 30 to 60 at work who have pandora worth at least 1000 each
(if they are authentic).

If Groupon are not cheating with the numbers they have increased their revenue
from from 172mil to 490 mil for one year and their operating expenses have
decreased by 19 million from 508 to 491 million.

By the way what happened with your short on netflix. I lost and this will
probably be one of my last shorts.

I think Groupon may get critical mass and most business will prefer them
instead of the smaller players. I will read their report today to get more
information.

If they are cheating with the numbers though short is the right position. A
friend of mine told me today he couldn't borrow the shares.

First - everything that I bought I could have bought cheaper earlier. :(
Second - it's the proxy season and do I hate the overcompensated CEOs. Vote
early, vote often and buy BRKa or FRFHF where the CEOs receive reasonable
salaries...

There are also recurring themes.

Chinese gaming companies. GAME continues going up even after the one-time
divvie payout. I lightened my position. PWRD also announced one-time divvie and
jumped up. I decided to reenter CYOU as its valuation is now once again close
to GAME and PWRD. GRVY - not Chinese, but still gaming company - has finally
released its long delayed Ragnarok Online 2. The stock promptly ran to $3.X and
has retreated since. I am holding my position waiting for the financial results
that include the new RO2.

Oil. I ran some numbers and decided to sell COP and buy some CVX and TOT. With
the EGY runup, the stock is getting overvalued, so I sold most of my position.

I did not like PKX 2011 numbers, so I sold my position. Continued to lighten
UVIC position a bit.

Other portfolio additions still based on valuation: MGDDY, MSFT, TSCDY, AHONY,
RIO, FCX, MOS, GLW, DELL. Nothing much to say except that most of them have run

Jurgis, the whole bull run from the SP500 at 666 to now 1400 points has
happened without individual investors adding much in terms of stock allocation.
There are institutional buyers as well as hedge funds and who knows what, that
are calling the shots. A lot of those are pretty weak hands in my opinion. The
maxim of the hedge funds is to panic before everyone else does. If they do it,
I have no problems going to 90% allocation again.

Not a good day for gold & silver stocks (and many other stocks). I added a few
more shares to my few-share position in ABX.

Fwiw, upped my Ampco-Pittsburgh (AP) position.

Again, a boring stock that doesn't look like it's going anywhere (based on
where it's been):

I've got no problem now with boring. Considering also its financials and
dividend, boring AP may also be "safe and cheap". Otoh, it may be a false
assumption to believe any stock is, or can now be, safe&cheap.
