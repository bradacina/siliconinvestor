You make a good point that if the yen should falter, Japanese
manufacturing companies, being export oriented should see earnings
rise. I wouldn't put it past the other industrialized nations to
help engineer a temporary, or maybe not so temporary, fall in
the yen in order to help out the Japanese economically.

I have a friend at work who still has relatives in Japan, and he says
that even though his family suffered no harm since they live
in southern Japan, they are now facing shortages, as much of
available surplus of food, water, and materials is shipped from
the south to the north to aid the people trying to overcome the

Thanks Paul. For whatever reason, I've been having
problems gaining any traction in my portfolio this year.
For all my troubles, probably up 1% overall so far this year.

I'm thinking upcoming earnings are going to be a real crap shoot
this quarter. If anyone's looking for an excuse to knock down
future guidance they can point to:

a) parts shortages due to Japanese earthquake,
b) rising oil and energy prices
c) rising commodity prices
c) a looming federal government shutdown
d) all the above.

Asymmtric - I agree that earnings are going to be more of a crapshot this
quarter. For one thing, i believe that the high tech recovery will stall some
and this will become noticeable with component suppliers and semiconductor
companies.

The component shortage from Japan (getting parts from there is a real mess,
based on hearsay I am getting from my job) is probably more a guidance issue,
it is one of the reasons I expect a more muted guidance in some sectors.

I think the rising commodity prices are a real wildcard and should be felt, in
particular by emerging economy customers where food and energy takes a bigger
chunk from income.

I don't think a government shutdown is a real possibility.

Hi rllee -

Re: GMXR preferred

I got my GMXR preferred for $24.30/share but I left my order out there for a
few days. I used an All or None condition and it was picked up at the close
yesterday. Remember the private placement sold at a discount at $47.50/share.
So these investors are making a dividend and a quick $1.80/share.

I plan to pick up more in June before the 6/17 ex-dividend date. I do not
expect it to be much lower.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Re: US Energy Corp. (USEG)

I noticed you also were looking at US Energy Corp. (USEG) on Dale's 50% thread.
Paul Senior has been accumulating this one too. I have been studying it this AM
and started a tracking position.

This one holds a lot of potential value. After a quick review of their 10K, I
noticed they increased their BV by almost $1.50/share from their previous
year's well development program. This year they plan a well per month (mostly
all oil) which if successful should do the same or better to BV.

According to Yahoo BV is 4.83/share which I believe is understated based on
some of the new events since Yahoo updated their statistics.

In a letter released by the company yesterday, BNP Paribas increased the
company's credit facility by $22.5 M reflecting their increased view of the
company . (
http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/USEG/1218000528x0x457263/ae6afdbf-a233-4
0d-a55c-77a945632ac1/USEG_News_2011_4_7_General_Releases.pdf ).

The company also reports on several new wells completed or in process. Very
positive.

Furthermore, the company has stated they plan to list their Remington Village
apartments for sale a 216-unit multi-family apartment complex in Gillette,
Wyoming. They recently paid off their $16.8 million construction loan. The sale
could generate $1.00/share cash which can be used to finance their well
development program.

Finally, like you pointed out, they have the Mount Emmons Project a proposed
mining operation located in Gunnison County west of Crested Butte, Colorado.
This project will develop the largest and purest molybdenum deposits in the
world. According to WikiPedia, Molybdenum can withstand extreme temperatures
without significantly expanding or softening makes it useful in applications
that involve intense heat, including the manufacture of aircraft parts,
electrical contacts, industrial motors and filaments.

All is not positive. I did notice that w/i the last year they had at least one
dry hole that cost them almost $2M. So drilling with 100% positive results can
not be expected.

That said, I expect the company to report positive growing earnings w/ the
completion of their 2011 drilling program. Stock could trade back down to the
low $5.00/share where I will be a buyer. Anything above $7.50/share, I will
hedge by selling some covered calls.

another one bites the dust.might have some more implications for breen murray-

stock offerings raising additional cash for PUDA based on what would appear to
be fraudulent financial statements. He goes on to question the extent of BMs
legal due dilligence before going ahead with the offering. Now I dont know what
the law is in china about pilfering from a company that you manage, but I can
see a bunch of lawsuits and may be a couple of public executions over this one.
As an investor its distressing when one cant rely on an audited financial
statement as being remotely accurate. But perhaps this will be yet another
wakeup call for auditors and investment bankers to do their jobs more
carefully. after skimming the article it would not surprise me to see puda coal
drop sharply again on monday.

Executions won't happen in this case. As far as Chinese law is concerned, this
is a private company not a public ones. Shareholders in the US can sues the

There is no extradition treaty between US and China so I don't think that would

re Japan.

You could be correct with your dire view on Japan. I do have some exposure
though work about what is happening in Japanese and it does not sound too good:
The power shortage is crippling, there are rolling blackout though huge parts
of the country. Rolling blackouts, which even hit the trains make it hard to
keep production going and productivity is down. because of cascading effects of
damaged facilities, lack of transportation (trains down to the blackout) and
plants operating with reduced productivity due to blackouts, there are part
shortages everywhere. one company we work with has started to shift the
complete activity including engineering to nights because there is more power
available. These blackouts are going to last through the entire year.

Tourism is basically ground to a halt and it will remain that way. For one
thing, I believe that air conditions will have to be turned off and from what I
heard, Japan in summer wo air conditioner is unbearable.

Japan has to converse and curtail all non-essential power consumption and build
new plants as quickly as possible. maybe they work out something with mobile
diesel generators , I don't know. My guess is that they are going to build NG
plants because those are fairly quick to build, much faster than coal plants or
other sources. My other guess is that they have to keep the existing nuclear
plants running for a long time, weather they like it or not. it is quite
apparent that they had a very thing reserve margin even before the disaster and
now the they a severe power shortage that is going to impact the economy.

I still like my stocks like DMW (6365 pumps for energy industry and water and
power utilities) as a cheap rebuilding play. Itochu, which is a trading house
with an energy (coal) focus and very diversified operations should do OK, i'd
venture to guess that coal imports into Japan will increase to and Itochu
(8001) should benefit. Sakura Rubber (5189) is an extremely cheap play and also
makes firehoses and safety equipment and may benefit from increased spending in
that business. Sapporo beer might sell well if air conditioners don't work in
Tokyo next summer. Besides that,the RE itself (assuming 5% cap rate) is worth
2x the Sapporo Holdings market cap, even when subtracting the substantial debt,
that leaves me a margin of safety at current prices. Anyways another 10% lift
and this one will be gone.

Sumitomo Rubber (5110) is the weakest case at current prices - i sold 1/2 and
the rest may be gone too very soon. Earnings will shrink this year, Rubber and
crude input costs are way up, although I like that the tire companies are
making no bones about increasing their prices nowadays.

Toa Valve Engineering (6466) is down because 60% of their business is related
to nuclear power (more than I thought when i bought this stock. However the PE
is ~5 and the stock is a net net, the balance sheet is clean without any debt.
The business with the failed plant is gone forever (not sure they had any in
this plant) but they can't really stop maintaining the remaining ones, so I am
guess that the nuclear business will be around for quite some time. Maybe they
can do export business or build upon their remaining 40% of their industrial
valve business. Competitor Okano Valve (6492) trades at a considerable premium
to Toa and also is 60% dependent on nuclear power business, so at least I
bought cheap.

I am having some lowball bids on stocks that I like out, but we need a ~10%
retrenchment before anything hit's
Well that's my roundabout for now.

Did you read Tim Clissold's "Mr. China"?
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27137210

What's described in the book is very similar to what's happening with Chinese
RTOs. Western investors expect Chinese companies to be the same as Western
companies. And perhaps some of the big ones are. But small ones are not. So
westerners become frustrated and decide that RTOs are simply fraud. Cause in
our mentality there is no other explanation. But if you look through Chinese
mindset (and you read through Clissold's adventures ;)), there are a lot of
other possibilities. Yes, there's definitely corruption and using investors as
cash supply bags, etc. But there's also a lot of completely different
understanding of what's "important". Chinese manager can easily go on growth
binge not looking at acquisition prices. Chinese manager may decide that buying
real estate is the way to go even if it's rank speculation. Chinese manager can
easily buy companies from related parties either because they look good to him
or just to have good relations with his relatives. They can easily pay
suppliers, but hold year of AR just because it's right from their point of
view.

Like Clissold writes there's a big culture of fuzzyness, which obviously
becomes a "fraud" in western mindset. There are laws, but even the bureaucrats
are not always certain what to do to follow them. There are regulations that no
one follows until some official decides that they HAVE to be followed. The laws
are very selectively enforced. So westerners on "Seeking Alpha" or Yahoo get
into knots about whether SAIC and SEC numbers should match. In Western world
yes. In China - no. Or someone digs out that a company (CGPI) does not have all
documents for land that they sell as cemetery plots. Or their license was
revoked. Or something. Most of these claims are true. The fact that they are
true does not matter a yota to the Chinese manager though. They could operate
just fine for years, but when western investors demand certainty, they are
stuck because half of the company's business and structure may already
contradict dozens of laws and regulations. In fact, filing exact numbers and
going through all the correct procedures may leave the Chinese side in deep
doodoo in China. And not necessarily because they did something super-criminal,
but because they had to trample on the unspoken vague bureaucracy lines.

And then there are accounting numbers that may be fuzzy as well, since nobody
gives a damn about exact numbers until they are needed for western investors.
So they write something up. It might be conscious invention - let's say
"fraud". It might be just generally sounding OK numbers that seemed right at
the time from some papers in someone's office.

Obviously, western investors think that the fact that Chinese company listed on
US exchange means that it's "important" for it to make great returns for
shareholders, file exact earnings statements, satisfy the auditors, not dilute
shareholder equity, protect the shareholders against stock price drops, etc.
For Chinese that's not necessarily the main priorities at all. There's also a
natural conflict with the original Chinese owners/shareholders, who usually
still manage the business. They consider the company theirs and don't
understand why they have to follow the demands of western (often minority)
shareholders.

Obviously, western investors can be very angry because they expect different
behavior, but there's not much they can do to enforce it. Clissold was on
location, he had control of the companies and he had control of the BODs. And
even then he pretty much miserably failed. (On the other hand he operated in
1990's when the "western company" mentality in China was way less understood
and followed; current investors have it somewhat better because they can expect
some Chinese management to be more understanding of western requirements).

So where does this leaves us? Not in a very good spot. Pretty much, we should
not invest in small Chinese companies.

It's not clear if larger ones are OK. The drama at Ali Baba is both
discouraging and encouraging. It's encouraging because the company stood up
against shifty internal behavior for the image of the company and its
shareholders. It's discouraging because such shifty behavior happened even in a
large (huge) and well-regarded company. Sidelines of Ali Baba story are
discouraging too - there are non-public Ali Baba group entities being run by
Jack Ma the way he wants with no oversight. Obviously, he's very well known
figure so he can afford to say that he does not want to run the private
companies for short-term investor goals. But this also smells of the "I do
whatever I want" mentality that seems to permeate other Chinese companies.

Obviously things changed a bunch since 1990's and they will continue changing.
So it's possible to invest into some companies. The decision which ones are
investable are still going to be hard for some time.

We went through a similar period in Eastern Europe. It took over 20 years by
now and it's still probably not up to US standards. (And the process never went
well in Russia...). It's hard to expect that this will take less time in China.

Iceland looked like a hopeless case in 2008, their debt load (if you included

Now the Icelandic economy has recovered (showing growth again) while Ireland is

I dont agree with your conclusion. I think change to better accounting
standards in china is inevitable. clearly US investors have already voted with
their pocketbook on these chinese names.
Already I believe the ones i own are selling for 50% less than a rock bottom
valuation would be and sooner or later the chinese govt will recognize the
neeed to enforce accounting and legal standards in order to secure financing
for their companies, and there will be a need to make it easier for companies
to grant dividends and buy back their own shares. My take on these chinese
companies is that if you are comfortable with the accounting and management buy
or average in and expect to hold through the ups and downs for 5 years.

Mr China was written almost 20 years ago. I believe hat much has changed since
then. I did already notice significant changes from my last visit in Y2011
relative to Y2003. Also there is now lot's of skilled management talent
(Chinese natives who studied abroad, or US Chinese expatriates) that is
familiar with western management.

The problem with RTO is that it exploits a legal loophole, to get small
companies that operate in China, listed in an US exchange. Because of that,
there is really no strong incentive from the Chinese or even the US to enforce
standards. For the Chinese, the RTO's are not public companies, they are
private. The Chinese will say, that if you want us to enforce standards, list
the companies in China. I am not keen on Chinese standards either and rather
prefer companies listed in Hongkong, which as far as I can tell, has standards
that are international competitive (except for insider trading). The accounting
laws are influenced by the British. overall I have not heard much trouble about
Chinese companies listed in HK. The big and reputable Chinese companies (banks,
telecom, insurance) all have dual listings in Chinese exchanges and Hongkong.

Many of these companies have some very aggressive drilling programs planned for
2011 and a lot of their future value depends on the outcome of the wells
drilled.

I have also been correlating the performance of my Open Positions in the basket
w/ the price of crude oil. Until last week, there was a pretty good positive
correlation. However as crude hit new multi year highs, my basket fell 7% with
no one company specific issue responsible for the drop.

Therefore, I am not sure that my future Buys or Sells will be tied to the price
of crude until I see if there is more of a positive correlation w/ my basket.

Finally, the value based on proven reserves makes my basket still quite cheap.
I plan to eventually lay in each company's proven reserve(s), daily BOE
production and future reserves/production (based on new wells completed) to
provide me a fair value estimate to use for peeling off shares.

If any one position gets to be too negative, then I will either close that one
holding or buy more to establish a lower average cost (if prospects still look
attractive). For example, my initial CFW buy was at a high and at a 30% too
high of a price (paid $0.20/share too much). I still like their prospects
(fracking old wells in New Mexico) and as long as crude is above $100/barrel,
they could well sell above $1.00/share.

The key is to establish a means to estimate fair value, be patient for the
market to recognize this value and cull out the loosers before they get too
big.

If you have come up with some exit strategy for your basket(s) specifically the
small cap components, let me know. I do know that many of these small cap E&P
companies remain undervalued and it's just a matter of time for them to
blossom.

from companies admitting accounting problems to auditors quiting to serious

Investors
http://seekingalpha.com/article/262779-puda-coal-chairman-sells-half-the-compan

From the article:"...Chinese RTO Puda Coal, Inc (PUDA) Chairman Ming Zhao
transferred the ownership of PUDA’s sole Chinese operating entity, Shanxi Puda
Coal Group Co., Ltd (“Shanxi Coal”), to himself in 2009 without shareholder
approval according to official government filings. Then, in 2010, Zhao sold 49%
and pledged the other 51% of Shanxi Coal to CITIC Trust Co., Ltd (“CITIC”), a
Chinese private equity fund, for RMB245 million ($37.1 million).

Zhao then recklessly leveraged Shanxi Coal by borrowing RMB3.5 billion ($530.3
million) from CITIC at an incredibly high 14.5% annual interest rate (including
fees) to finance the development of its coal mines. PUDA shareholders are
completely unaware of these transactions that decimate the value of its U.S.

Is this really fraud or just typical (unethical) Chinese management style?
Apparently the motivation for his decision was due to Government mandated
consolidation of Chinese coal companies.

As a result, shareholders lost a significant amount of value in their company

Aerofagia - no I am not familiar with any of those, except Yasuhara Chemicals
4957, which I looked at before. This is a terrific list to start research.

FWIW, I am not looking at net net only. i like them because they provide a
margin of safety. The problem of course is that they may remain net net for a
long time. So i think it is better to look for companies that are cheap (and
maybe close to being net net) but that have positive factors like:

1) Export oriented business (rather than being bound by the ailing Japanese
economy) and/or foreign sales. This is also a nice insurance if the Yen
weakens.

2) Shareholder friendly (by Japanese standards) Decent dividend yield and/or
stock buybacks
3) Ability to grow business or at least not shrinking
4) Attractive sector, hidden value on balance sheet (subsidaries, real estate)
5) Name recognition (Kirin or Asahi beer for example)

I mostly dig around the TSE website, which can be used as a starting point for
fundamental research:

http://www.tse.or.jp/tseHpFront/HPLCDS0101E.do?method=init&callJorEFlg=1

If you find a company at 1/2 the book (most book values tend to be tangible in
Japan) you probably found one that is close to being a net net as well. FWIW ,
I don't consider myself knowledgeable with Japanese stocks, i am just the only
one looking at them. Fine with me, I like to have little competition and the
roads less traveled.

I have also sold all of my leveraged MLP funds (ie SRV) as the downturn is

Hi Paul -

Trying to find value and stick to the theme.

I am feeling much more comfortable nibbling at several of those E&P stocks as
they come down to my price targets (I like to buy when they cross down below
their 200MA). The value proposition remains strong as long as I stick with
those companies that continue to find oil at a reasonable cost (many are able
to hold their costs at $40.00/barrel or lower) and they continue to add to
their proven reserves. To me, this is money in the bank. Knowing that crude
could even go back down to $80.00/barrel, I have no problem adding to my basket
as the "value" buy is still there.

AXAS is one I missed and was on my watch list. I held off at $4.40/share in
March as they announced a secondary offer at $4.00/share. They have some very
nice assets in several key zones. I will nibble at a few shares if it should
sell below $4.50/share.

I have identified more possible stock sales in sectors that to me seem to be
reaching fair value now (ie BKH & SE) and will pull the trigger once I have a
place for the funds.

It will be interesting to see how the market reacts to Obama's speech tomorrow
and also where the Fed stands on QE2. I anticipate a continued sell off and
then the resumption of the slow steady rally in natural resource companies.

As I posted earlier, BHP is sitting with $50 Billion in cash ready to deploy
(most likely in NG and/or oil assets) which could be the stimulus to get new
money back into this sector.

considered better, so investors are betting that CHU will win a lot of market
share at CHLs cost. Furthermore, CHU has iPhone:

totally correct.

I recently read about Piotroski score and calculated it for CHL. Not very
interesting IMHO, but here it is:

1. Net Income. Score 1 if last year net income is positive. 1
2. Operating Cash Flow. Score 1 if last year cash flow is positive. 1
3. Return On Assets. Score 1 if last year ROA exceeds prior-year ROA. 0
4. Quality of Earnings. Score 1 if last year operating cash flow exceeds net
income. 1
5. Long-Term Debt vs. Assets: Is Debt decreasing? Score 1 if the ratio of
long-term debt to assets is down from the year-ago value. 1
6. Current Ratio. Score 1 if CR has increased from the prior year. 0
7. Shares Outstanding. Score 1 if the number of shares outstanding is no
greater than the year-ago figure. 1
8. Gross Margin. Score 1 if full-year GM exceeds the prior-year GM. 0

re CHL, CHU, you assessment regarding the technical superiority of CHU 3G

of 3g technology that proved not be competitive. they are in a disadvantage
relative to CHU, which used CDMA. I still believe that CHL has a coverage
advantage for 3G though.

this handicap will be temporary until CHL deploys 4G using LTE (considered the
best standard for 4G as I hear). CHL seems to accelerate the deployment of 4G
in major cities and I think they are ahead of CHU, which does not really have
the cash to invest in 4G at this point. Once 4G is running in major cities, CHL
will take the lead again. All imo of course, I don't claim to be technical

Hi Paul -

Re: Synergy Resources Corporation (SYRG.OB)

Not sure if you saw this but SYRG just released a company presentation dated
April 12, 2011

http://synergyresourcescorporation.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/2011_04_12_SY
G-Corporate-Presentation.pdf

Their stated shares outstanding (as of 4-5-11 pg. 6) were 34.087 M. This is
pretty close to your figure.

They also list some other Warrants and Options w/ exercise prices of
$5.92/share & $5.32/share. So, there could be a slight overhang of new shares
at these price levels.

They are in the process of permitting 100+ wells in their Niobrara Wattenberg
Field and in their presentation they have plans on developing 20+ Horizontal
Wells.

Noble Energy has been pretty successful on their Wattenburg property which is
close to SYRG's parcels.

From the Niobrara Shale blog dated 08/02/2010:"...“In our horizontal Niobrara
program, we now have two rigs drilling in the central DJ basin, both currently
in the Wattenberg field…So far we have drilled 10 horizontal Niobrara wells in
Wattenberg and two in the Grover area about 20 miles northeast of Wattenberg.”

“Eight of the Wattenberg wells are now on production with two awaiting
completion operations. As we continue to step out to the north and the eastern
portions of the Wattenberg field, we're encouraged by the early flow back in
liquid content of our new wells. Recent initial 24 hour rates have ranged from

VOG, SAH.

I added a little today @$4.06. I already hold a good size (and losing) position
in this one. Just quickly looking at VOG to SYRG, VOG's land holdings are
valued higher than SYRG's. I guess that means I'd prefer SYRG (cheaper?). These
dink and .ob companies like SYRG are so thinly and strangely traded with such
bid-ask spreads though, that sometimes I feel SYRG can be a roach-motel. So am
reluctant to take on a large SYRG position.

re Rico JP:7752. I brought it up in December 2007 in this board. It was
(rightfully) discarded by Jurgis.

At that point, they were decently profitable, with ~8% operating margins, now
they have shrunk to ~3.5% and they don't seem to be able to recover. Their
office automation (printers) business is stable, while the diversified
electronics and camera business is shrinking. If you think the 8% margins are
coming back it's a bargain, since they will make >100Yen/share. But I think the

I keep watching SVU, but so far have not made a buy. I suppose they will make a
turnaround, but I'd like to see something concrete to show it happening.

I'd feel better about it if the insiders made some buys.

I'm disadvantaged in that there are no SVU stores around my abode (Northern
California).

I notice with some curiosity the evolution of the High-Low marketing approach
taken by SVU, and others such as Safeway, in contrast to the constant pricing
of places like Trader Joes or Walmart. The whole approach has always been to
make the most off those who pay least attention to prices, while still snaring
the coupon clippers. It seems that they are getting more sophisticated at it,
if not to the level of airline pricing yet.

My local Safeway now requires you join an internet site and be interactive to
preload discount coupons that supposedly register when you purchase your
products and show your Safeway Card; this is for maybe for half of the
available discounts. The one time I tried this it did not work, but probably
they will get it going better. And then on their weekly paper, many specials
are limited to four days, rather than seven. And of course the last day is
always sold out, so the value conscious really have to adjust to get the good
deals. The local Lucky is doing the same, at least for the three day sales
(they do not have an internet site yet). I suspect that this approach works,
and we will see more of it. Here it seems that Safeway is kicking Lucky's butt.

So the question I have is how is SVU doing in this game?

I like the cash flows, which more than doubled from FY09 to FY10. I assume
Albertson's was at least partly responsible for some of that increase. Even
with today's big gain, SVU sells for just 3x FCF. My concern, though, is with
another of my cash flow metrics: FCF/Total Debt. I come up with 5.9% (5.6%
ttm), which is quite anemic considering the magnitude of the debt load. SWY,
e.g, shows FCF/TDebt = 10%, although it sells for @10x FCF.

The numbers aren't available yet on M* or AdvFN for FY11, but from a Zacks
article posted today, Cash from Operations for SVU is down YOY and a quick
calculation reveals that, despite a decline in CapEx, so is FCF. I was looking
for another tick up before I took a position, so I'm disappointed. If
management makes this work, this is a 3- or 4-bagger.

Telefonica will cut at home. Boost abroad. may cut staff in its underperforming
Spanish home market by up to 20% by 2013

plans to sell off Spanish assets worth around EUR600 million, including real
estate.

Targets Brazil Growth, May Cut Staff In Spain

By David Roman
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
MADRID (Dow Jones)--Telefonica SA (TEF) Thursday said it will focus on
high-growth markets like Brazil and Germany, and may cut staff in its
underperforming Spanish home market by up to 20% by 2013.

Madrid-based Telefonica, Europe's second largest telecom operator by market
value after the U.K.'s Vodafone PLC (VOD), said it plans to sell off Spanish
assets worth around EUR600 million, including real estate.

The company also aims to increase the number of mobile high-speed Internet
customers in Brazil to around 5.5 million by the end of 2013, from 200,000 at
the end of last year. Brazil is Latin America's largest market and accounts for
almost a fifth of Telefonica's revenue.

In Germany, Europe's largest market, Telefonica is looking to boost its share
of mobile telephony revenue, to 18% from 15%.

These announcements, made during the company's two day investor event in
London, come as Telefonica is struggling to boost competitiveness in Spain. The
unit, formerly a cash cow, is now a relative underperformer due to Spain's
economic crisis over the last three years.

"The evolution (of the Spanish unit) has been worse than we expected," said
Guillermo Ansaldo, Chairman of Telefonica Espana.

Ansaldo said Telefonica Espana, with 32,000 employees, has the flexibility to
lay off around 20% of those, or 6,400, but added no final decision has been
taken.

Telefonica said it's looking to tie salaries at its Spanish operations to
productivity, rather than relying on current pay reviews linked to Spanish
inflation--a show of support for controversial labor market reforms, pushed by
Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Spanish business leaders and economists,
but opposed by powerful trade unions.

On Wednesday, the company said it is targeting annual revenue growth of between
1% and 4% and slightly lower margins until 2013, as falling consumption in
Spain remains a concern.

In February, Telefonica posted a 45% drop in fourth-quarter net profit, missing
analysts' expectations by more than EUR1 billion, as operating expenses surged
across the board. Fourth-quarter revenue in Spain dropped 7.5% on the year.

I believe the authors of the Rolling stone article make it appear like the
loans are handouts. Very likely we are talking about overnight or very short
term loans that were backed by securities. Basically, the FED was replacing the
interbank lending that was freezing up. these loans (to foreign institutions)
are most likely paid back for a long time already. Why did they extend this to
foreign institution? Because those institutions do a huge amount of business in
US$ and in US financial markets and there actually was a "shortage" of US$ for
a while, since everybody was gravitating towards the US$ and the Yen.

Well the latter is not a problem any more, obviously.

When do you see the banks going back to "mark-to-market" accounting? Isn't this
a type of fraudulent accounting? I see that several of the large banks (ie.
JPM) are juicing their earnings by reversing a portion of their bad loan
reserves back into one time earnings. This is just accounting w/ mirrors and
things are not really any better than they were 18 months ago.

It's been discussed that using the good bank and bad bank as a means to isolate
these bad loans but I do not see how this will be resolved. I suspect the end
game will have the Fed ending up with these losses on their books and the $US
dollar debasing.

Any way I look at it, the exit strategy has the Fed and $US absorbing these bad
loans not the large mega banks. I think it would have been better to break up
several of these mega banks and decentralize the sector into several smaller
companies. This will never happen.

re Banks - i don't think it makes much sense to discuss the failings of the
current banking system.

The fact that JPM releases some reserves is probably not too surprising, it
seems to show that they have overreserved in during the 2008/2009 crisis.
Wether it's a smart thing to do is another question. my guess is that it has to
do with management incentives to meet internal earnings targets, if we
understood JPM's incentive targets for this year, we probably knew why. They
are certainly not get rewarded for it in terms of shareholder value - the
market is rightly spooked by poor pre-provision earnings , which appear to have
peaked.

The current QE does not have much to do with helping the banks, imo. The goal
is to keep LT interest rates artificially low by leveraging the FED balance
sheet and buying LT assets with short term financing. if this goes wrong, the
taxpayer will have to eat the market to market losses on this loan portfolio.

Anyways, as for investment angle of this, the current fact is that ROA will be
lower (probably mid teens peak) due to lower allowed leverage (8% Tier one
target). The systemic risk has decreased somewhat due to less leverage but then
on the other side, if the FED manipulation of the interest rates go wrong,
there is a risk of a meltdown that has not been there before.

the meltdown scenario would be something like a feedback loop of:

Sovereign default scare---> failed treasury auction--> sharply higher LT
interest rates---> FED shows huge market to market losses on balance sheet--->
Sovereign default scare....

Well you get the picture - it's a chicken and an egg thing and could start or
end at any of the above. Fat tail chance that it will happen <g>. If it does,
short all the financials, it does not matter which ones.

Spek, I would argue the FED would never allow a failed treasury auction to
happen. Perhaps, more likely, a moderate increase in LT interest rates would
occur after a sovereign default scare as the FED steps in to purchase the
treasuries? Essentially... QE(n+1)?

Sovereign default scare---> failed treasury auction--> sharply higher LT
interest rates---> FED shows huge market to market losses on balance sheet--->
Sovereign default scare

FWIW, A failed treasury auction is on my watch list of things that might cause
worldwide socioeconomic collapse. I might be topping off the gas tank instead

Hi Dr. -

What is the possibility that the FED creates a new "Preferred" $US Treasury
Bond that is backed by a basket of hard assets. These new "Preferred" $US Bonds
might be backed by a basket of gold, oil, food products or even Gov owned land
(w/ mineral rights). Interest could be paid in units of the Index or even in
components of the index (ie. Oil, bags of rice etc.) One could receive one of
these new preferred bonds by turning in old US Treasury Bonds (or $US) based on
some market exchange rate.

The thing is that foreign owners of "old" treasury bonds might find these new
"collateralized" preferred bonds to have more value. The Fed uses this new
"hybrid" currency to buy back all of the outstanding "old" Treasuries not
residing in the US using some floating exchange rate 10:1 (old for new).

What if future debts had to be paid w/ this new "hybrid" currency and there was
a transition time line that started w/ all foreign obligations first (say w/
China).

Therefore you would not have a failed treasury auction if some transition
"asset based" bond was developed by the FED which was seen as much more
valuable by market buyers and resulted in a huge demand for the new currency
(ie bond).

Does it take an act of Congress to state that the $US is no longer accepted to
settle debt obligations (foreign and/or domestic) or can the FED unilaterally
decide this by the specific terms in the bonds they issue?

>>What is the possibility that the FED creates a new "Preferred" $US Treasury
Bond that is backed by a basket of hard assets.<<

What you decribe (issuing secured debt) would imply that US debt is not AAA any
more, by the government's own admission. It is not going to happen.

Thinking about the failed treasury thing, I agree with Ipsofacto that it's not
likely to happen, at least not openly. If in a treasury auction there were no
natural buyers, I assume that the treasury dealers (a dozen banks or so) would
have to take on the inventory. They probably could do that for a while, since
these auctions are for 20-30B$ or so, which is not much for a dozen banks, if
they all play ball. The banks could keep them on their balance sheet (of course
the FED would cooperate and borrow them the liquidity to do what is needed)
until the end of their respective quarters, which is the only day, the balance
sheet needs to look good <g>. Also,a failed auction for a set maturity could be
smoothed out by selling short different maturities to get the same blend. So
this naturally hedging that always occurs in these hyperliquid market will
smooth out any "crater" in a specific set of treasuries that might occur.

These things get interesting if some other entity starts to pile on a trade to
trap those that go long/short the treasuries and/or these markets are not as
liquid any more and hedging does not work. Then we should see interest curves
that don't make any sense (with strange spikes and bumps at certain maturities)
because those folks that tend to trade these things away are not willing or
able to trade any more.

If that happens, we will know (if we watch closely and get the correct
information) that the jig is up and something big will blow up somewhere. The
only thing left to do is sell everything and then some financials, especially
the broker/dealers for treasuries.

Don't know if it works out that way. I am in engineering and not an economist.
If we build something we try to think through how something blows up (FMEA's)
and we particular address feedback looks. I really wonder if those folks
running these institutions and companies do the same thing or just hope and
pray that it doesn't happen under their watch.

EKS, Great idea. A preferred treasury backed by hard assets though I don't
technically if it could still be called a bond. The fed gov owns plenty of
unutilized assets. Land, gold, and mineral rights are all viable options. The
gov owns ~700+ million acres and who knows how much gold sitting in Kentucky. I
like your idea independently and outside of a tool to transition or soften a
sovereign debt crisis.

The Federal Reserve doesn't have the ability to issue US gov debt. The Treasury
Department would have to create these collateralized preferred bonds and
getting that done would almost certainly take an act of congress. Then your
idea takes a spin cycle in political milieu of these United States.

Some problems though. The value of these assets might not be enough to convince
some it’s worth the risk. I haven't run the numbers but with all of our current
debt the treasuries might be backed for less than pennies on the dollar?? I'm
also not sure how I feel about China owning any of the physical US upon
default. I think the solution might be not to default on our current debt.
