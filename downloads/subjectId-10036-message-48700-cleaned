Thanks for your post. I have been confused. The thread header does imply that
more than metrics is used to evaluate value here. At least now I understand
what you have been doing.

<blockquote>We want to stay away from the obscenely high PE's and look
at net working capital models, etc.
Schooling in the art
of fundamental analysis is also appropriate here.

NikhilJog,

I think you are missing the point of one of the most basic approachs to value
investing, which is to buy stocks at low multiples. I go where the best value
leads me. (This has served me extremely well over the past 11 years, although
not so well recently.)

Regarding XIN: the cash, low PE, low PB, and large buyback are very attractve
IMO, but they could be a scam or a value trap. This is definitely a
speculation. I would not invest my life savings in it.

That being said, almost everbody knows, including your mysterious "peeps," that
China is slowing down and has problems. I myself don't have confidence in China
as a whole. For that reason, I have bought some FXP (short China etf) as a
partial hedge.

I am not posting to simply defend my position. I would like to hear countering
viewpoints to they extent they include real analysis or factual information
that I have not considered. If I receive reliable information China's tier two
market is going to implode or that XIN is a scam, I would sell out of my
position. I have not seen it as of yet.

Thanks,
MC

On the face of it - what you are saying about BX makes sense. But to buy it or
not is another issue.

On LAZ - I will revert to my earlier point - being part of the deal and being
the lead on the deal are two very different issues. If you know that they have
been the lead on the big deals, i guess i have nothing more to add.

And yes i am glad you are playing devil's advocate:) it keeps me on my toes!
Thank you for reading the posts. One thing Obamacare might do is to induce

I agree. Will def. not argue with 11yrs of experience. Same goes for Paul.
However, even the best value investors including buffett never bought just bcs
something was trading at low multiples. Anyways, thats how i think. For me
there needs to be drivers.

I can argue to the contrary that there is a reason firms are trading at low
multiples and there is no assurance that they will undergo multiple expansion.
so i am not a big fan of just buying bcs something is trading at low multiples.

again, this is just my opinion. I am big on value too but investing in
something that looks value and the realization of value are two different
things. Again my opinion. therefore i raised those points just to have a
discussion.

From your post, i believe you have factual analysis on the tier two cities in
china still doing decently well? Just wondering.

Also for the record, i am in no way saying that XIN is a scam. But just some

Actually, the father of value investing Benjamin Graham did buy stocks because
they were at low multiples. IMO, you should read his writings before making
such comments or maybe move to a growth investing board.

Buffett was a better investor than Graham, but Graham did quite well and
Graham's approach is easier for mere mortals to replicate IMO.

That being said, I do not believe Graham would ever advocate buying XIN. Too

I am not disagreeing with you, however, times have changed and so certain other
things. Maybe if he was alive today he might add to his methods, that buffett
did. Its not a question about who is better, its a matter of looking at things
from the right perspective. And just so you know, I have read his writing. But
none of us know what he might do if he was alive today, so no point in talking
about that.

I do look at multiples, but even for value guys, multiples are not everything.
Multiples in isolation are meaningless.

I think you misunderstand catalyst as something for growth investors. All value
investors from M Price, Klarman, Einhorn, Gabelli, so on and so forth, invest
in firms with relatively low multiples in addition to catalysts.

So i think the conversation that i should go to a growth blog bcs i look at
firms with catalyst in addition to low multiples is moot.

As for XIN - I don;t know if Graham will invest in it or not and honestly i
don;t care. What i do care about is, what are the reasons to invest in it, why
Paul invested ( i wanted to learn) and whats the risk/reward profile in taking
the position.

I always pick Paul's brain bcs i end up learning stuff from him.

I hope that helps. I appreciate you writing back.

Orders for ULBI's products continue to ebb and flow. As they ebb, the earnings
and stock price decline (government orders really affect such a small ($64M
market cap) company. When business is good or anticipated to be good, the stock
historically (as I view and bet) has done well too. I expect this to happen
again, and I hope I have the fortitude/patience to hold on to the stock until
that time when the business environment improves and ULBI gets its share of

Nikhiljog,ni think we have discussed this before. Many in this thread, as well

Do not think that Buffet looks at catalysts either, although in the early days,
he was also an activist and control type investor and provided the catalysts
himself. But during the last 30 years, I am not aware, that he has looked at
catalyst at all in his investments.

Hedge funds have very short time frames for their investments, typically less
than 12 month and mostly 3-6 month. Often, they just look at catalysts and
entirely ignore value metrics (the trend follower/ quants that I posted about
are an example). They get paid by their last annual return, so that is turns
out that way. as Munger said,understand the incentives and you know why people
do what they do.

I certainly like it, if I found a cheap stock with a catalyst to unlock value,
but i do not restric myself to them. I am perfectly happy with having some
"dead money" in stocks as long as I don't loose significant amount of money on
them. I found I can do well with them, provided my fundamental analysis is
right.

The problem with insisting on catalysts is imo, that it restricts the
investment universe, especially with respect to small mid caps too much for my
investment style.

I can understand not needing catalysts, but I can't see buying a stock just
based on its metrics. Cheap metrics does not = value.

HPQ is a good example.

Recently we both agreed that HPQ had attractive metrics but found that there
are reasons why the stock is selling so cheaply and may be considered
unattractive.

Value implies that you are buying something at a cheaper price than it is
worth. HPQ is properly priced at the moment despite its cheap metrics. HPQ has
cheap metrics but it is not a value stock.

Same argument came up recently with JCP and if you look back on this thread GLW
and WM to name a few. In each case you have to find if there is value not
recognized by the market, maybe because of an event that was anticipated that
did not occur, or perhaps there was a temporary setback that has been addressed
or how about the co. has made improvements that have not been recognized.

Not potential catalysts, but an argument that the stock is worth more than its
current price because.... is needed beyond a review of the metrics.

Re HPQ - I the problem with HPQ is which metrics to use. It is cheap based on
last years metrics and maybe on this years metrics but I have no confidence in
next years estimates, hence my conclusion that HPQ is not a value stock ( for
me)- it's a turnaround play, as far as I am concerned (maybe an OK one). I
don't even think it's sure thing that HPQ is still around in 5 years. Reversal
to the mean is a suckers bet in tech, imo.

The tech field moves fast and it moves In the wrong direction for HPQ as I see
it. The PC market is shrinking and I believe the market for home printing is
going to shrink even faster going forward. There is value in HPQ small software
and the enterprise service and hardware business, but the latter are
underperforming their peers and are offset by substantial debt. HPQ is simply a
case where I cannot put a value on the business, others may feel different,

FCX - It is a good company with good results (ROE, margins, even FCF) during

the top of the macro cycle, it is a great buy. Assuming we are going into a
macro recession and worldwide slump, the price is less attractive. If you take
their 2009 results as a base, the stock is barely a buy.

Personally, if I did not hold FCX, I'd buy a small position and increase it
over time. Since I already have some FCX, I am not rushing to add. But this is

I think Clownbuck puts it quite nicely. It is preferable to have a catalyst and
some investors, such as hedge funds, will only consider value stocks that they
believe have a catalyst, but I believe a regular investor can validly buy
stocks on the basis that they are cheap.

Often I get an unexpected pop in a beat-up value stock that had no seeming
catalyst -- the reason being expectations were low and with bad news basically
priced in, any good news gets a big rise out of the stock. Often the best time
to buy is when nobody else cares..

No, it is not "event driven trading".

http://www.riskglossary.com/link/event_driven_strategy.htm
"Event driven trading strategies seek to exploit relative mispricings between
http://www.riskglossary.com/articles/security.htm whose issuers are involved in
mergers, divestures, restructurings or other corporate events. The strategies
are generally http://www.riskglossary.com/articles/leverage.htm and are often
implemented to be
http://www.riskglossary.com/articles/market_neutral_strategy.htm . They are
widely employed by certain http://www.riskglossary.com/articles/hedge_fund.htm
and proprietary traders.

The quintessential event driven strategy is merger arbitrage, which is also
called risk arbitrage. This is a strategy of providing
http://www.riskglossary.com/articles/liquidity.htm to owners of a
http://www.riskglossary.com/articles/common_stock.htm that is currently the
target of an announced acquisition."

http://www.riskglossary.com/link/event_driven_strategy.htm

"Event driven managers seek to profit from security pricing inefficiencies that
may occur when companies are involved in corporate events such as mergers,
takeovers, restructures (including share buy-backs, spin-offs and capital
returns) and capital raisings.

The investment focus of such a manager is directed to analysing the likely
effect on security prices due to a corporate event, rather than analysing and
researching company earnings or dividend streams, which is the focus of
traditional equity investment funds.

Due to the types of investments made by such managers and the general short to
medium term holding period of each investment, the returns of event driven
investments are likely to be less sensitive to movements in the general equity
market than conventional equity investments.

The aim is to produce consistent high risk-adjusted returns that are non-market
correlated."

==========

In event driven operations, the "investor" seeks to profit from a specific
event known or likely to happen.

This is different from buying beat down stocks where the expectation is that
one-way or another, something or anything - perhaps something not easily
predictable, could happen to propel the stock. Some of these possibilities
include: quarterly or several quarterlies' improvement in company's sales,
general improvement in stock market or company's business segment, corporate
announcement of dividend increase, acquisition, buyback, corporate
restructurings (layoffs/new management). When businesses and/or their stocks
are beat down, managers are often against the wall, and they can get very tough
and creative about the business when their jobs and/or egos are at risk.
Unlike "event driven trading" none of these possibilities may be known a-priori
(i.e. in advance) by the buyer of the stock when he/she is making the buy.

It's a probability game. Not always, but enough times though, with beat down
stocks with enough resources behind them (i.e. debt/equity ratios low enough to
where the company can survive), and with enough past history to offer some
assurance that they've got through a business cycle or two before) -- the
stocks will improve and the investor will see gains. The investor does not need
to and may not be able to identify a catalyst in advance of making a purchase.
However, because it is a probability game, the investor needs to diversify
among a bunch stocks that meet the metrics we are talking about.

"New Mountain Finance Corporation (the “Company”) (

offering of 5,250,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of
$14.35 per share for total gross proceeds of approximately $75.3 million. "

Stock now about $13.97. Last div 6/13 @ .34. Annualized, that's $1.36/sh.

I still do not really understand the specifics of the company though. It's tied
into other related companies, and the insiders have ties to investment firms.
It's not clear to me how close the insiders' decisions are to benefiting all
shareholders. I am hoping a big majority of the cash coming in from the stock
offering will go to making more loans to customers, thus increasing revenue and
distributions to us stockholders. I suspect this is what will happen, but I
can't be sure:

"The Company intends to use all of the net proceeds from this offering to
acquire common membership units from New Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C. New
Mountain Finance Holdings, L.L.C., in turn, intends to use the net proceeds for
new investments in portfolio companies in accordance with its investment

To answer your earlier post on klarman et al, I have personally met 2 of the 4

I know some people will now say i am tooting my own horn, but the only reason i

Also, i do agree everyone does not not always look for catalyst. sometimes you
invest with only low multiples in sight and thats "totally fine". But i don't.
Low multiples are just one criteria for me to consider a stock.

To change the subject...

I don't normally look for "beaten down" stocks for value investing, but I'm
intrigued with what is going on with the audio accessory maker Skullcandy
(SKUL) at $13.85.

It has rapidly growing revenues (30%+/year), no debt, and serious brand
recognition. They beat each quarter earning estimate since then. Even assuming
it loses some margin and market share, the forward PE <12 with est. earnings of
$1.17. Recent insider buys are substantial, and it is rated a buy by the
pundits. Their plan calls for expansion into Europe and Asia this year.

So far, it looks like a promising stock, but there is a huge question: why does
it have such a large short position? Shorters expect them to fall, and have
been expecting them to fall since they went public a year ago at $20. Given
that it bounced off it low of $12 five times over the last year, I would have
thought shorts would have covered by now.

The best explanation I've read from the short side is that "they make
headphones, and headphones are a commodity". That argument sounds hollow to me.
Coke makes sugar water. That doesn't make it a bad investment. I've read
substantially all discussions of the stock on the internet, and just don't see
the downside.

Given that the company's earning look set to continue climbing for at least a
few years, and that they are protected by a very good brand strategy, I'm
betting that it will go up from here.

A short squeeze along the way would be a bonus.

Any thoughts?

you have said. I looked at Amazon, and the comments I saw about SKUL products
were mostly favorable, and on a par with other people were rating other
headphone manufactures.

I agree it's a "promising stock", and could do well. It's too tough for me to
figure as a value stock. On some measures it might be okay; otoh, there just is
not a lot to the company's public history, and that's a concern for me.

ways might be comparable to SKUL -- relatively low p/e for example or low d/e.
PLT has much better net margins, and of course a longer history. PLT has a
workforce of over 2000 vs. about 200 for SKUL (per Yahoo). Does SKUL have
patents? --Can SKUL innovate competitively with the likes of PLT? I don't know.
PLT's stated bv growth has been stagnant over the past few years. Maybe PLT is
losing business to SKUL or others? Maybe the market is saturated? I do not
know.

SKUL: I guess... -> too tough for me. I defer to others on the thread for their
opinions. For me, I'm not a buyer of SKUL or PLT at current prices. PLT has had
ten years of profits. I might be interested in PLT if stock fell enough. Not
sure.

Re COH, looks like my thesis on COH short was right but my timing was off. I
think closing the short at 67$ was the right move but could have, should have
reentered. Of course i didn't. What is the lesson? I am not entirely sure. I
guess I should have watched this stock and maybe checked the charts better, and
take another shot at it at higher prices.

Some of the car retailers like AZO and ORLY look topsy. If new car sales
increase, maybe old clunkers get off the road and those are the ones that need
a lot of parts, which naturally wouldn't be good for those car retailers.

Paul,
Thanks for your thoughts.

I think PLT is probably more innovative on the technical side. I like SKUL for
the fact that it is selling a brand with innovative marketing. It seems to be
doing for headphones what Nike did for shoes. Its main competitor is Beats,
which is also growing rapidly. I think Beats will ultimately be more limited in
its appeal by its association with Dr Dre and the famously over-hyped Monster
brand. Skullcandy doesn't claim technical superiority(although their high-end
is pretty good) - they are just cool and have great marketing strategies and
sponsorships. In Europe, for example, they are supporting newly famous
musicians (or making them famous) and get great street credibility from that.

The next earnings announcement from SKUL is in 3 weeks. Maybe I'll start a
thread to see who else may want to voice an opinion.

FWIW, I don't own Skullcandy headphones or stock (yet), but I have a bunch of
call options.

What are your favorite value investments?

SKUL - Short history is an issue. There are a lot of companies that are fads.
You think that they have a brand recognition, but instead they have a fad
recognition. Fad fades, they go boom.

We have recently looked for headphones for 20-something audiophile with some
sense of fashion. We bought Panasonic. This is just example that other
companies can compete in terms of design/appearance/fashion. Panasonic reviews
were good. If I was buying for a serious audiophile without a fashion sense,
I'd probably buy Sennheiser. We saw a bunch of headphones at TJ Maxx, some of
which were Skulcandy... this is not necessarily a positive - IMHO superhot
products don't end up in TJ Maxx discount bins. So IMHO, Skulcandy might be a
fad.

I will skip it. But please don't trust my opinion. Do your own DD and decide.
It might be that I am wrong. :)

You seem to have a lot of experience with doing stock scans. So what?

Let me see, today I would like a stock selling at such and such and if it ends
up being a Chinese taco co. does not matter because it fit the parameters. Your
money, but shame on you for calling that value investment.

Does not matter if you know the page number if you don't apply common sense and
reasoning.

Some of your comments to posters with opposing viewpoints are rude.

I am looking for some good value ideas. Not stock scans set on on P.E. or B.S.

So, well I don't anything about this co. or what it does but it sells at you
know cheap and I like it but that's just me and you don't have to follow me
because I have been wrong so many times before but if one of my picks ever
makes money you know it came from here.

One question for you with an opportunity to redeem yourself. What is the right
way to find value stocks and I am not interested in a scan. You know value?
What is it? It's not stocks selling at such and such because I don't want any
Chinese tacos!

On China from my China source: "Regarding the property market in second tier
cities in China, I still didn't see a big price correction. The price has
dropped a little bit in the past year. However now with the economy slowing
down significantly, Chinese government is loosening the credit again and local
governments want to stimulate up the property market more than ever as they are
all facing heavy debts and need proceeds of land auction to pay back the debts.
That's why in fact Chinese property bubble lasts so long and is not easy to get
bursted. My view is that finally the property bubble will burst. The problem is
when. And nobody knows when. "

Thanks for the comments.

I understand the fad argument, but I can't tell if SKUL is a fad or the next
Nike. The increased inventory levels are from a product update that they wanted
to launch smoothly, or so the company says. In the last conference call,
management said it is transient and is correcting itself. I will watch the
margins, though. That is the key.

I'll avoid sinking much into it at this point, but will keep call options just
in case the short squeeze comes. That's hardly value investing, so I'll leave
it off this thread unless the earning continue to climb like they have over the
last few years.

Thanks for the input.

I dont know about that. The way i look at it, as a value investor you get paid
for having patience and being willling to accept volatility. so the question is
how patient do you want to be. the one area where I think investors get shafted
is with con artist type unscrupulous management. and unfortunately there is a
lot more of that going around than i ever thought possible. sad to say, there
are just no enough checks and balances in the system to keep these scumbags
from sticking their greedy hands into unsuspecting investor pockets.

I still dont understand why anyone would want to be a bank investor. No one has
anything to say about that creme of the crop ceo Dimon who complains about
there being too much regulation. well He shafted investors by agreeing to
substantial cuts in dividends, dividends that retirees and conservative
investors were relying upon for their day to day needs. Now its becoming more
and more appar1\ent as I warned years ago that banks are clueless about the
extent of their derivative risk.

One thing that would help the situation is more shareholder activism. companies
that have investors that want to own a business tend to be well run. That
doesn't describe the banks or most other large public companies.

<rant>
Too much of the equities market is composed of people that just want to trade
rather than invest. Take shorting, for instance. Does a share sold short
include voting rights? People don't care, and there is no distinction made
between shares bought from a short-seller versus from a stockholder. Shorting
effectively creates new voting shares, with both the buyer and the owner of the
loaned shares claiming voting rights. The result is that shareholder votes cast
can exceed the number of shares outstanding. What's up with that?

If "shares" sold on exchanges were actually registered shares of the company,
settlement could take place immediately, and there would be no delivery issues
or voting problems. Of course, that would take a paradigm shift for investors
to actually begin to care about how their company is run.

SVU... what I mean by not that bad is they should still generate ~1billion
OCF(according to management). They also increased the amount of debt retirement
to 450Million this year which is coming from the suspended dividend. The
increase in fcf also makes the new loan a good sell. they are clearly trying to
cut expenses with the new credit facility.

This is still risky stock but i will take a little.

Re GLW - the problem with GLW is that their earnings are coming from the
Display glass business, and the LCD glass business is the most significant
business line within Display. So far ,it seems like all the other business
lines amount to less than 20% of GLW's operating earnings.

I follow the news releases each and every day rather than read magazine
articles. It really was no effort to pick up news on stocks you mentioned, as
well as stocks I follow. It's what I do.

You pass my test regardless of how many stocks you have actually bought and
sold.

Why? Because we agree on going beyond metrics and we don't mind a potential
catalyst or event driven investment.

I also use technical analyses and generally avoid stocks hitting bottoms until
the selling is exhausted.

Were you around when Mike Burry was involved with this thread? All of these
thing were included in his posts. TA, shorting, event driven investing,
catalysts, etc.

Mike did not refer to a dictionary to communicate.

Mike explained how he used what he learned from Buffett and Graham and others
and made it his own.

Mike used every tool that he could find including technical analyses and
shorting as well as the lessons from Buffett, Graham, etc.

Mike understood that times change and a successful investor needs to adopt to
the environment instead of making the environment fit into neat categories.

Here's some good reading. And you better have a pick for the SI vs Buffett
challenge!

Re SPLP - well his record keeping only went until 2007 and after the investors
in his hedge fund became stuckinvestors. And he does not seem to be much more
shareholder friendly now either, as he paid his compensation in units that were
discounted 10% to the then prevailing market price, despite the fact that they
were trading a significant dicount to NAV already. But that is why the units
trade at 35% discount to NAV nowadays. I agree that it is interesting but I am

Yes, a good point regarding SVU.

Not sure I'd change my small SVU position based on latest numbers though. Using
Altman, if results show increased chance of bk, it wouldn't surprise me, it's
what I would expect, and I'd make no change (buy or sell). If latest number
shows little or less chance of bk, I'd still not now be willing to add to my
position.

Right now, with the Altman number I see (which likely is based on obsolete
financials), SVU seems to be in a "grey area",

Altman score: 2.74

Clownbuck, fwiw, very interesting article imo about some of the
associates/contemporaries of Dr. Graham (Heine&Schloss), and the "newer"
generation. Specifically the Isaac family, which I've not really been attuned
to. Which surprises me, since I have been a collector of articles on
Heine/Schloss/Graham/Price.

Anyway,
http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=bol.fr is
discussed for one of the stocks Paul Isaac likes.
"Vincent Bollor&#233; is best-known for active positions in a number of large
companies, most recently
http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=viv.fr
(VIV.France), where he is joining the board. He is a talented guy. The book
values of these companies compounded at a mid-teens growth rate for 20 years.
Two things are attractive and overlooked. One, a very large ports and logistics
operation, primarily in Francophone Africa, that will probably have an
operating profit of €500 million this year. Two, the structure of the group is
not generally understood. The actual economic float is significantly less than
the stated float: Only 40% of the stated share count is outstanding, and they
continue to shrink it."

Mr. Isaac is also a holder or buyer of several French banks. "The banks have a
very large retail network. Roughly 19 have outstanding nonvoting equity shares
that are relatively illiquid, but do trade in France. Representative names
include
http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=cnf.fr
(CNF.France),
http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=crsu.fr
(CRSU.France), Credit Agricole Ile de France (CAF.France),
http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=ccn.fr (CCN.
France), and
http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=cmo.fr
(CMO.France). These trade at 20% to 40% of tangible book and three to five
times earnings, with dividend yields of 8% to 9%."
I may look closely at these. For now, I still am holding BNPQY, France's
largest bank, and will likely make a small add to this losing position, if
stock will drop back down as part of the general market volatility with Euro
stocks.

-----
A week or so ago, I reentered Greif (GEF) I bought the commonly traded "A"
shares --- perhaps now I see it's a mistake: Paul Isaac goes for the "B"
shares. "We have a sizeable position in the B shares of
http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=GEFB (GEFB),
a packaging company with a nice long-term track record. The A shares are in a
bunch of indexes. The B shares, largely controlled by the founding family, are
not only voting shares, but also are entitled to 150% of the earnings and
dividends on the A shares. The B shares are nine times earnings and pay a 5%
dividend. They trade at a discount because they trade at a fraction of the
volume of the A shares. Greif has some interesting growth initiatives in liquid
packaging. It is buying back the B shares. (I note of that old generation of
value guys, back in the day, GEF was a favorite of Philip L. Carret.)

To me, an interesting general comment: In talking about BOL, perhaps also
referring to his earlier discussed French banks or about GEF on trading volume:
"We are buying something that is really inexpensive and compounding asset value
at a decent rate. This comes back to my initial point. Usually, things aren't
cheap if there's a readily visible exit".

I looked at some of the banks and they seem to be associated with Credit
Agricole. I assume that, regardless of what metrics their balance sheet shows,
they will go down if Credit Agricole goes down. I may be wrong, but I think
that is the main risk that your would be taking, since Credit Agricole does not
exactly look solid.

Bollores has a bunch of subs that look very obscure like the Compagnie du
Cambodge (started out in plantations), so it's very hard to value.

The interview and comments were very good, imo. Thanks for posting.

I offer my 2c here:

1. Unlike last cycle, this time I missed the housing cycle (referring the lows
of home building/related <u>stocks</u>). That Mr. Marks is buying foreclosed
<u>houses</u> to rent out ( "Waypoint, which owns 1100 houses and is buying
five more a day, ... firm co-founded by billionaire Howard Marks..." (4/12))
surprised me a little in that he would go to direct ownership and management of
properties. Otoh, this is where opportunities seem to be, so why not.

Digression: I want to add also, that my former accountant had been doing this
successfully also on scale. That is, working with one clerical assistant, he
accumulated about over 1500 distressed homes/apts in Las Vegas, eventually
selling them en mass. He then picked Pittsburgh, and patiently accumulated well
over 1000 distressed/foreclosed houses&apts there. Can you imagine just 2
people managing all those properties from an office hundreds or thousands of
miles away? It was made somewhat easier because they were rented Section 8
(welfare), so the gov't paid most of the rents. But still. He had a system, and
a process that worked fabulously. He was generous in showing me the details,
but I and others could never get the gumption or drive to get started
replicating it.

2. Somewhere in the interview, I got the impression that Mr. Marks was saying
that bottom-up guys or value investors were doing okay, and that they didn't
use or depend on macro stuff. The part about value investors doing okay --
doing okay now -- that I wonder about. I'm not really aware of value guys doing
okay or good or well now. On this thread or on SI for that matter, a lot of
value people seem into conservative things (e.g. preferreds or cash) - more so
than ever before. Which I assume allows for safety and relative performance,
but not "good" stock performance. Nor can I recall seeing notable articles
recently about value funds (which I assume must maintain close to full-invested
positions) being highlighted for their investment picks and performance. Growth
investors don't seem to be doing that well either. Just so much seems to be
correlated now, and no stock-picking methodology stands out for doing well now.
That may be because of the macro environment (including the resulting
volatility) and the importance that people now give it. (Perhaps it's only
people like Mr. Marks who invest in distressed bonds who can claim to do well.)
So macro maybe does play an important role, at least now - now in the
short-term -- as regards performance of value funds/value stock pickers.

3. This thread is usually a value thread in the Ben Graham tradition, so
thankfully we don't deal with macro events, macro-forecasting. Mr. Marks might
approve. :>)

Yeah, buying distressed properties in scale - that's very impressive. I was
thinking of buying just one extra house and even that looked tough
long-distance. Your friends had balls, brains and perspiration to work it out.
My respect.

I think distressed debt has worked great last year, so Marks is coming from
that when he says that value investing has been working well. Also he may have
meant that value investors did well over long time not just last year and this
year.

PSX,

Might be a buy on some of the metrics I use. On sum-of-parts analysis, I don't
know. I assume Buffett surogates who bought PSX also did a sum-of-parts
analysis and used the result to to influence their buy decision. So your
analysis may be correct. I don't know. I don't see the stock as a buy for me
right now though vs. other stocks I am interested in. I would like to see a
little more public history with PSX, and see how their change in business model
(moving away from refining) works for them.

PSX - your earning estimates are a bit high and I think the value for the
midstream operation too, even if they completely spin off their midstream into
the MLP, they won't get 17x distributable cash flow. The valuation for the
chemical ops sound about right with 10x earnings, although I would not buy an
basic chemical operation at 10x earnings (which I suspect are closer to peak
than trough).

I don't think their refinery ops are best in class either...i guess they have
trouble getting over 45$ for the pieces, if they were able to sell out ( i
think they need to wait 2 years for taxation reasons after a spinoff, but I
could be wrong). I doubt an analyst report with a high SOP value will do much
for the stocks, it's quite well researched actually.

CE: I don't understand the chemical business or how to place these statements
into a value context: "PSX apparently also has a proprietary process producing
higher quality ethylene and polyethylene from ethane and naphtha at lower cost.
In addition PSX licenses technology to competitors. 80% capaicty is within US
where it uses low price ethane and sell into high price markets, earning good
spread. Valued at approx. $13 a share at 10x P/E"
=============================
I've placed an order to buy Celanese, if it'll drop back back a bit. I like
this company for its relatively low p/e (8x, low historically past few years).
And again, I don't know its chemical business. However, it's in two areas that
might capture the imagination of potential small investors (more so I mean than
a process that makes "high quality ethylene from ethane" -g-)
1. Conversion of natural gas to ethanol: "Celanese Corporation (NYSE: CE), a
global technology and specialty materials company, today announced its
intention to construct and operate a methanol production facility at its Clear
Lake, Texas acetyl complex. As one of the world’s largest producers of acetyl
products, the company plans to utilize its existing infrastructure to capture
the opportunities created by abundant and affordable U.S. natural gas supplies.

“The positive developments in the U.S. energy complex and the current and
emerging natural gas surplus make it advantageous for us to produce our own
methanol requirements for U.S. acetyl production,” said Mark Rohr, chairman and
chief executive officer of Celanese. “Utilizing existing Celanese
infrastructure helps reduce capital requirements while capturing advantages of
state-of-the-art technologies.”"

2. A zero calorie sweetener:

"DALLAS (June 25, 2012) –Nutrinova, the global sweetener and preservative
business of Celanese Corporation (NYSE: CE), has launched the new SunsationSM
platform to help food and beverage manufacturers develop low- and no-calorie
products that are better tasting. The first product in the platform is
Sunsation Sunett&#174; SL, a sweetener system for sugar-reduced or sugar-free
food and beverage products. Sunsation Sunett SL is a step change from
Nutrinova’s current Sunett&#174; sweetener which is used in more than 5,000
food, beverage and pharmaceutical products."

And it benefits so much from low NG prices that it should blow away upcoming

CMI

Chid,

I think the method depends on the company and on how conservative you want to
be. In case of company like CMI that has a long history of positive earnings, I
think that 3-5 year average earnings is enough to smooth the expectations,
especially since 2009 was quite a bad year. For example, taking annualized q1
2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009 gives about 1.2B average earnings. Now you can decide
if this is conservative enough. If not, you can lower it even more... ;)

If you look at long term net margins, that would be about 5-6%. Based on 17.8B
current sales, you get 900M to 1.07B earnings. A bit lower than first method,
but perhaps I was too optimistic there.

I have tried using the revenue growth rate adjusted averages, but that usually
ends up being quite high estimates. CMI annualized revenue growth rate from
2009 to 2012q1 is about 18%. What would you apply this growth rate to? 2009
earnings? Average earnings of last 4 years?

Assuming you get some kind of average earnings, what do you do next? DCF? Some
kind of PE or E/EV valuation?

Finally, one concern is that CMI FCF is quite a bit lower than earnings, so
perhaps we should be looking at their FCF rather than earnings. :)

sure enough. It was just something i wanted to highlight. I did some background
checks but the valuations are provided by Meryl Whitmer.

I like the story of the stock. There is a lot of M&A in that sector. they have
a good niche in chemicals and have good prospects. its a long term buy.
Midstream is basically like earning a toll - its a good business to be in.
There is lot of activity in chemicals, fundamentals look good, it pays
dividend.

Even if 17x CF is expensive for midstream, the stock is still cheap around 33.
So i thought i did point it out, if anyone want to run their numbers.

I am looking at ADM as well for a re-entry ( after selling at 30$+) but I'd
like ADM to take their guidance down, due to drought and losses in ethanol
first. I feel this is bound to happen. At 25$, which is where I put a GTC in, I
would buy it anyways. I don't think that CAG (which is mostly branded products,
although the brands are not that great) should be compared to ADM (commodity
producer) in particular with respect to book value, since branded product
operation deserve to trade at higher valuations.
At some points, stocks like K (suffering from execution issues and high input

Re K - valuation - according to S&P tearsheet K trades at 16x Y2012 earnings, ~
1B$ in FCF (6% earnings yield), ,4.5B$ in net debt. they don't really show
organic growth, the Pringles acquisition hopefully will provide an earnings
boost next year, but the multiple of 14.5x earnings for next years earnings, is
not terribly cheap either. K is clearly a company that has been struggling as
of late, the double digit losses in volume in Europe are an indication if that
( which is not solely explainable by poor economic conditions, since
competitors have done much better).

I am guessing you buying this based on being close to 52 week lows and below
it's LT metrics, but keep in mind that the results, as well as the balance
sheet do not look as good as historically either, so I don't think the stock is
a relative bargain. I think buying this stock at current prices will work out
OK but not great.

I have owned ADM for over 40 years. My average purchase price is a little over
$12. I have land in the North Dakota Red River Valley and ADM comes through the
small town where this land is and moves grain, beans and other crops with 100
rail cars each and every week all year long. There are many small towns that
they take care of the logistics to move production out of the farming areas in
the US. Also my niece works for Land O Lakes and they are one of ADM's largest
clients.

The stock goes up and down, but over the long haul the world needs food and ADM
will be part of the movement of agriculture commodities.

They did close down a couple of the refineries in North Dakota, but they will
open when it becomes economical.
