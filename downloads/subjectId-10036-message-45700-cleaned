I know we've discussed GLW here before. Thankfully, I avoided today's
cratering.
With the news today of sharply reduced demand, I'd be interested to hear how
the thread feels about GLW now.
As I recall, mgmt. was optimistic about the company's prospects just a very

GLW

I posted in Sept. that when a stock hits a new low, that it is a good time to
evaluate why.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27652282&srchtxt=glw

<It appears that the flat panel displays account for half of the GLW's earnings
and that their market share in this segment has been steadily declining since
its peak in 2009. Additional concern is that only two customers account for
almost all of their flat panel business. >

As you know, the news is that one of their flat panel customers has decided not
to honor their contract. I don't know what legal remedies are available for
GLW, if any, but in today's climate any bad news tends to be exaggerated. I
think GLW will bounce back, and would look to buy in where the gap in the chart
was.

I know this thread hates technical info, but there's a gap at 12.90 that was
filled today. I think this gap fill will provide technical support. If support
fails here, I would bail and wait for the stock to find a bottom.

There is now only one major customer for their flat panel business until we
hear otherwise so there is still reason for caution.

If you are going by just value metrics and by measuring years of management's
ability to steer the co., then this is all just a bump in the road. You would
conclude that GLW will be able to find new customers for their glass panels.

re GLW, I bought a first chunk at a little bit above 13$. I buy more if it hits
12$. I found the optimism that GLW management showed a few weeks more
surprising than the weak forecast that they issued today. It does not take a
lot of street smarts to determine that the LCD sector is week, just look at
LPL, AUO and Nippon Electroglass numbers which were all weak. That said, I
think this is going to turn as well, the sector is know for wild swings in the
supply chain and this is true on the way up just as well as on the way down.

As for suppliers not honoring the contract - for get about legal remedies. The
biggest customers are AUO and LPL and if any of these is not honoring
contracts, a solution out of court has to be found since the interdependency is
just to great (there only two or three major display glass suppliers and maybe
3 major LCD panel customers).
GLW biggest customers is actually Samsung, which runs a joint venture with GLW
to produce the glass for them. if that is the customer not honoring the
contract, good luck suing too.

Apparently GLW's mgmt didn't see it coming. Otherwise, the CFO wouldn't buy
shares on the market.

The first order issues don't worry me too much -- shrunk margins, lowered
volume, dropped utilization. We've been there before in the GFC. As Clownbuck
said, the throughput in the supply chain fluctuates wildly. All these don't
change the long-term fundamentals of GLW's business and its moats.

But I start pondering upon the second order implications -- why did that LCD
maker went to such an extent to breach a contract? Is the LCD industry going
through permanent structural changes? Is that LCD maker under financial stress?
(Do they have PIIGS bonds??) Is it going out of business?

Sergio rightly pointed out the risk of GLW's concentrated clients that I'd
dismissed earlier.

Do we know which LCD maker cancelled the contract?

UPDATE 1-Corning slashes outlook in glass glut, shares drop

* Corning cuts outlook as TV demand sputters

* Plans to mothball capacity

* Major customer warns will not honor contract

(Adds comments, details from statement)

Nov 29 (Reuters) - Corning Inc slashed its fourth-quarter profit outlook and
warned that a major South Korean client does not plan to honor its contracts as
the supply of LCD glass outpaces demand, triggering an 11 percent share price
plunge.

Corning, which is struggling to cope with a glut of display glass as television
sales sputter, now expects consolidated-equity earnings to dive 30 percent
quarter-on-quarter, versus a 5 percent decline anticipated previously.

The U.S. company has tried alongside joint-venture partner Samsung Electronics
Co Ltd to take back market share in Korea by cutting prices. But the
unidentified customer informed them recently it would not honor its
obligations, meaning their joint venture would miss volume targets there this
quarter.

Corning and Samsung now intend to mothball capacity worldwide, but executives
said the production capabilities should be restarted further down the road as
demand comes back. Corning will take a one-time charge of $25 million to $50
million related to capacity shutdowns in Korea.

Ticonderoga Securities analyst Brian White said Corning was too slow to cut
production capacity in the face of dwindling demand.

"We felt Corning was simply kicking the can down the road and ultimately would
need to cut back capacity," White said in a note to clients. "The can became
too heavy for Corning to kick down the road any further."

The U.S. company did not name the Korean customer, saying only that the Asian
company did "not expect to honor the contract for the remainder of the
quarter."

"This has never happened before," senior vice president and corporate
controller Tony Tripeny told attendees at the Credit Suisse Technology
Conference on Tuesday.

"We will work over the next few weeks and the rest of this year to see what we
can do about it."

In its statement, Corning also said it was reducing its forecast on Gorilla
Glass sales used in tablets and smartphones. It now saw a 25 percent sequential
decline in sales this quarter, versus a pre

slashes its investment rating to underperform from outperform amid falling
LCD-glass prices. "Poor profitability at panel makers seems to be catching up
with glass makers." As for the Korean company that is denying some GLW

to reclaim lost market share by lowering its premium pricing and LG Display
still abandoned them after" Nippon Electric Glass (5214.TO) and Asahi Glass

selling is because people who've received this stock from the split out from
ITT, just aren't interested in XLS/XLS's business. And they would be selling

re: GLW & MET

In retrospect, it appears to me GLW's mgmt takes tremendous pride in their
proprietary technologies and thinks no competitors can achieve the thermal
properties their fusion glasses offer at their price point and scale. (Such
thermal properties are needed to make high quality LCD panels.) Not being a
material engineer, I can't really tell. I still give them the benefit of doubt.

MET: Apart from banks, another industry I'm reluctant to get into is insurance.
they are black boxes. There are incentives for mgmts to underprice premiums and
do it for a long time. And because there are black boxes, no problem shows up
in the P&L and the market will be in the dark for a long time too.

re HPQ, I was surprised by the weak number in the printing business. Printing
has been one of HPQ cash cow but my thinking is that the printing business may
have just started to go into a secular decline.

A few days ago, I looked at former German Blue chips and was surprised about
the trouble that the large area commercial printing machine companies like
Heidelberger Druck and Man Roland are in. All of these companies were highly
profitable 10 years ago and then started a secular decline about 7-8 years ago
that keeps on getting worse and worse. This is probably not a surprise since
many commercial printers are hurting, newspapers are hurting and print ads
slowly but surely get replaced by the web.

Now, I think it is the PC printers turn, since it is easy to shown show
pictures on the TV, store tons of them on a thumb drive or just show the
pictures on a tablet. Really there is less and less reason to put pictures on
paper (if it were not for my computer illiterate parents I would not need a
color printer at all). I think this business is going the way of the typewriter
and this is bad news for HPQ, since that is one of the few sectors where they
have a moat.

Magnum Hunter Resources Corpora (NYSE: MHR )

8:53AM Magnum Hunter reported the Furrh #2H which was drilled to a measured
depth of 15,876 feet and the Kudu Hunter #1H was drilled and cased to a
measured depth of 16,302 feet ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=mhr&d=t ) 4.80 :
Co announced the Furrh #2H which was drilled to a measured depth of 15,876 feet
was fraced with 20 stages and placed on production November 15, 2011. The 24
hour flowing initial production rate was 1,270 Boepd on a 19/64" choke with
1,680 psi FCP. MHR operates the Furrh #2H and owns a 42.1% net working
interest. The Kudu Hunter #1H was drilled and cased to a measured depth of
16,302 feet was fraced with 20 stages in mid-November. The 24 hour IP rate was
1,590 Boepd on a 22/64" choke with 2,200 psi FCP. MHR operates the Kudu Hunter
#1H and owns a 46.3% net working interest. The capital expenditure budget for
the Eagle Ford Division for fiscal 2011 remains at ~$75 mln (30% of the total
company wide capex budget) to drill 16 gross wells. Co's spudded its first
Eagle Ford Shale horizontal well in June 2010 and to-date, the Company has
drilled and completed 13 gross wells (7.8 net wells), all of which are on
production.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is pretty good news from the company. Disclosure: I have quite a bit of
the preferred shares and own common shares too.

When you adjust the Boepd totals for their direct working interest it adds
another 760 Boepd to their bucket. That represents about $0.36/share to their
EV value. These Boepd totals do diminish over time (especially the first three
years of production). Maybe this is why the stock is up over the last few days.

Hi Paul -

Richardson Electronics Ltd. (RELL)

Two insiders had sales in May and October which were pretty large. All the
sales were a bit higher than the current price around $13.00/share. This one
looks like a good value play especially if the electronic business picks up as
I expect it too. They are still selling at the higher end of their range when
you look at their three year price history.

With $8.00/cash and no LT debt on the balance sheet it could be that their
balance sheet is much stronger now than it was in 2009. I am going to check
this from their annual report(s).

I will add this one and any other of these electronic and semi conductor
companies that have a lot of value (ie cash and little to no LT debt). I
believe this is going to be a good sector to hold for next year.

Intel, CSCO and possibly AMAT are other High Tech value plays on my radar. I
currently only own shares in INTC.

Good add on ORCL. I unfortunately sold my entire position when the Sun
Microsystem sale was closed. I in fact should have used the proceeds to buy
more ORCL shares. They have nearly doubled since the acquisition.

At this point it's just easier for me to believe I can read the future for oil

extract it. There are not many big oil companies like that.
I'm buying SU now with a view to hold for the rest of the decade.

With the new "resource tax" by Brazil and now Australia, CNX's U.S. coal
reserves should benefit by having a net lower price (especially Australian
coal). However, Suncor Energy owns a lot energy resource located in Canada
which should also benefit from a "no resource tax".

I am not sure how it will all eventually play out so I am now willing to own
more Canadian resource companies which before last week I had them in my sell
bucket. On the next run higher on CNX, I may peel off some of the shares and
put them into Suncor Energy. I have been looking at it and I agree with you
they have a lot of reserves that have a lot of value.

RELL completed an asset sale of about $239 million earlier this year. That's
where their current cash comes from. I bought the stock then because it was
trading at just over cash. You got the co. basically for a dollar. Since then
RELL has made an acquisition for about $2 million (that's when I sold) and the
asset sale price was adjusted by about $4 million lower. They spent about $8
million on buying back their shares and paying the dividend.

When a stock has a large cash position, you have to be concerned about what
management will do with the money and if the money is overseas.

$48 million of RELL's cash is overseas or about $3/share. That still leaves a
large cash position inside the U.S. So, it's about trusting that management
will do something with the cash to benefit shareholders. Money sitting on the
balance sheet is attractive but its not doing much.

Canada has a crown tax on oil sands right now Canadian oil sands pays 6.5Can

the increased taxes to their customers, at least not in the short or medium
term. Vale developed most of it's mines many years ago when Iron ore was at a
fraction of it's current prices. So essentially Brazil captures some of the

So here's a guy who's worried about the large debt of countries, and who's
seeing a crisis or breaking point.

And previously, when he foresaw the housing crisis, he apparently successfully
bet, and bet large, on that happening.

So what is worth following him into now, based on his recent buys?

http://www.gurufocus.com/news/154627/new-guru-added-kyle-bass-of-hayman-advisor
-buys-mmr-atny-tsra-sells-rkt-kkr

Nothing that I see that would relate to this debt crisis. World as we know it
may be coming to serous danger point, so one of his twelve positions is now in
something like Six Flags? And something called API Technologies, that hasn't
shown a profit in five years? (Otoh, Six Flags has moved up to new high, ATNY
has some recent insider buying. So maybe he's at least making profits from his
buys.)

(Aside: I see IMTN as one of his buys, and I'll look at a little closer. Seems
like it's selling below cash now.)

Here's my point: Regarding "It's really scary because he's been right so far."
On the contrary, I find it comforting.
Because what he actually concludes after all the pages of macro argument is
this: "Be mindful that we are not talking about the end of the world as we know
it: we are simply saying it will be a different a slightly more difficult place
to live for those of us in the developed and indebted West. We will all wake up
in the days, weeks and months afterward and go to work, continue to invest, and
live our lives". And that is what he is doing now. Namely he is buying stocks
he believes are undervalued or otherwise have a special situation about them.

==========================
As moderator, I do want to reiterate: this is a value thread. About finding and
identifying value stocks. It is not a thread about reacting to possible macro
events by short selling, purchasing gold, buying leverage etfs, buying

If you are sure about the global melt down, go cash and short the markets.
Preferably the ones going under, i.e. European PIIGS(+F?) subset, but S&P will

There is no guarantee that gold will do better than cash or market short. Gold
miners are already doing worse than gold and will do worse than gold in a

I'd be very surprised if Europe can agree on a financial union that would pull
most of the countries out of morass (maybe with a loss of Greece). I'd be very

Hi Paul -

Followed you in for a tracking position in Suncor. I watched the video link you
posted and see the point Mr. Maxwell is making but he never said how much it
costs the company to drill/recover the oil. Have you looked into this and if
their costs are similar to some of the other large integrated Oil companies
(eg. XOM)?

I do like the idea that SU is like a "land bank" but for oil. His comparison to
XOM has me thinking that maybe I should cosider selling some of my XOM and
moving the proceeds into SU.

Have you discovered any other Canadian and/or US oil companies that have as
much recoverable oil per $100 ownership in SU. I believe his number for SU was
they had $44.00 (out of $100) in recoverable oil. XOM was $8.00.

I'm avoiding COS/COSWF, based on my memory of my past poor (losing) experience

As I recall I bought it for the distribution and its possibly good continuation
of increased oil production, and in '08 with the market down and in '09 with
oil down, the distribution was reduced (I can't recall. I may be wrong).
Anyway, the stock took a substantial hit, and I exited disappointed.

Not that Suncor didn't do poorly. Maybe it did as badly:

One thing that I do recall about COS.to, is that they were unabashedly a
pro-Canadian company. They intended to, or already had, rules to limit the
amount of foreign investors. (That is, limiting stock available to USA
investors.) That did not appeal to me.

Anyway, the upshot of all this is I'm left with a bad taste with COSWF, and I'm
going to put my money on Suncor.

I show that COS pays their dividend twice a year (last year Fed & May) of
$0.257 or $0.514/annual. That works out to 2.48%. According to Yahoo Finance,
SU pays their dividend March, June Sept & Nov (.101, .116, .112 & .107) or
$0.436/annual which is a yield of 1.44%.

In Miller's interview, I believe he stated that the oil reserves for SU were
25% higher. I am not sure how they measure these reserves but did you check out
the reserves for each company and did you notice that SU reserves were that
much higher than COS?

I guess reserves are only estimates and can be off. How reliable are the
reserve estimates that are made for these Oil Sands Companies vs the
conventional Integrated Oil Companies? Are they all suspect?

P.S. I had a pretty large position in RD (I believe late 90's) until one

Just 8 per cent will be in the downstream refining and marketing division,

EKS, re: SU CNQ CVE HES MRO COP XOM CVX COS RDS. Fwiw, I have SU, a very few
shares of CNQ as a set-and-ignore stock (purchased in '05), a few shares of CVE
which I recently added to, HES about which I am looking to add more if stock
will fall, and CVX to which I've been a consultant in the 1990's and in which I
maintain a small position and am looking to add in low $90's.

RDS, I gave up on when (as you have said) they suddenly announced decreased
reserves. My preference is to go with Charlie Maxwell, who says avoid XOM, buy
SU, &/or maybe also CVE.

I like banks with the metrics that you have stated and there are many that just
don't have a lot of liquidity, but make for a decent long term buy and hold if
the fundies warrant purchase. If the numbers are ok you just have to wait for
the stock price to catch up. Maybe a way to invest in low liquidity banks like
this one is through a DRIP if that is offered.

Care to share the pick?

This is a value thread, but the value is frequently dictated by macro events. I
find it astonishing that there is a lot more coverage of the various
Occupy....s than MF global. It should not take so many weeks to determine what
has happened with funds in customer accounts to a regulated entity like MF
Global. There is now information that futures and security funds have been
commingled with MF Global funds and this had been going on for weeks and not
days as previously reported. This is evidence to me that:
a. the regulators have not been doing their jobs.
b. regulations need to be examined and changed so that whatever MF Global did
doesnt happen again
c. law enforcement needs to arrest former senior management, take away their
passports and file criminal charges.

In times like this we should remember the saying that the market can stay
irrational a lot longer than people can stay solvent.

Reiterating, this is a thread about identifying value stocks, finding
individual value stocks, discussing the pros/cons of a particular stock.

There's no argument that macro events dictate value. The discussion of macro
events though -- the dismay or hand-wringing about them, what society should or
should not do about them, that imo is an off-topic item.

"In times like this we should remember the saying that the market can stay
irrational a lot longer than people can stay solvent." To me, something like
this IS an on-topic item. That is, a discussion about how long or why a person
should stick with a beaten down stock (e.g. like a net-net) is relevant to
holding value stocks. As might be a discussion of the validity of Keynes'
statement itself about irrationality and solvency. For example, I believe Mr.
Buffett and some others, maybe Peter Lynch, have said market participants
should expect stocks to fluctuate, and as long as you are not on margin and
have bought stocks of good businesses at good prices, you should come out okay
at the end...eventually (-g-)

thank you Mr. E.K.S....

i think i will follow Mr Paulson... and keep my position small.

i decided to take profits on Friday and have set a benchmark for exit should it
fall below it.

the one thing i did notice and view as a positive is that the digital side of
the business is growing while the print side is shrinking.

i have not checked but heard that they have some bonds that are trading around
30 cents on the dollar. if so, the bonds may be a better / safer play than the
commons.

have a great weekend.

and once again - thanks,

Hi Lazarus. I looked at dexo briefly and passed because their credit rating was
recently lowered. I have not read the two recent write ups that have pushed the

One_Downgraded_To_CCC_On_Falling_Revenues_Outlook_Negative-914594

Abstract: Cary, N.C.-based directory publisher and marketing services company
Dex One Corp.'s revenues continue to fall rapidly, and it is our view that the
unfavorable outlook for print directory advertising will keep the business
under pressure. We are lowering our corporate credit rating on Dex One to
'CCC+' from 'B-'. We are also lowering our issue-level ratings on Dex Media
East Inc.'s, Dex Media West Inc.'s, and R.H. Donnelley Inc.'s term loans to
'CCC' from 'B-'. We revised recovery ratings on all three issues to '5' from
'4'. The negative outlook reflects our expectation that Dex One's declining
business fundamentals could hinder the refinancing of its currently outstanding
2014 debt maturities of approximately $2.30 billion. On Nov. 16, 2011,

Hi Sergio -

In the event of another Market meltdown, buying Debt for pennies on the dollar.
Making your list.

Lazarus's post reminded me that in the next market crash, there may be some
value opportunities by buying discounted debt obligations in senior notes
and/or preferred shares. In 2008/2009 I bought deep discounted REIT preferred
stock (at one time yielding over 20%). After three years they all have come
back from their single digit lows to where they now trade above $20.00/share
(par was $25.00 when issued). They never missed a dividend payment either.

I would not even consider any of DEX Media's discounted debt (even at $0.30 on
the $1.00) but there out to be others that can be added to a "Value Buy" list
when/if the opportunity presents its self. I would exclude all foreign Euro
concentric paper. I might consider different REIT obligations and selected E&P
company preferreds.

Do you have any companies or sectors that might be worth investigating? I want
paper that is collteralized by hard assets (real estate, Oil & NG etc) but will
consider anything that provides a solid argument for value.

I do know when the 2008 crash was on top of us, many of these debt issues were
thinly traded and you had to be firm with your limit offers (otherwise they hit
you with large spreads). There was about a 30 day window where you could buy
all you wanted at very deep discounted prices (if you had the cash to do so!).
If you sold something to free up cash, you usually took a huge loss as many of
the stocks rebounded w/ the recovery too.

Quantum Online w/ it's updated debt ratings info was quite helpful so I was not
too afraid to pull the trigger in the eye of the market crash storm.

http://www.quantumonline.com/Index.cfm

----------------------------------------------------

Got any ideas on issues I should add to my list?

Preferreds I plan to buy if they sell in the low teens on any crash "event"
include:

OFCpH - Corporate Office Properties Tru (OFC-PH)
OFCpG - Corporate Office Properties Tru (OFC-PG)
OFCpJ - Corporate Office Properties Tru (OFC-PJ)
DFTpA - DuPont Fabros Technology Inc CU (DFT-PA)
DFTpB - Dupont Fabros Technology, Inc. (DFT-PB)
FRpJ - First Industrial Realty Trust, (FR-PJ)
FRpK - First Industrial Realty Trust, (FR-PK)
MHRpD - Magnum Hunter Resources Corpora (MHR-PD)(This one anywhere in the
$20's)
GSTpA - Gastar Exploration 8.625% Serie (GST-PA) (This one below $10.00/share
would be a winner too).

Unless the roller coaster collapses in itself like it did in 2001 or 2008....
To put your analogy further, don't bet that a rollercoaster can ride towards
the sky - gravity does exist and always wins<g>. Right now we have a lot of

Hi CB,

I always think of buying a stock as a right to the future cash flow of the
business.

When markets collapse or decline, everybody loses equity (unless of course they
are short).

If I own a stock in a company - I'm always sure they will survive and make a
product that will have future demand.

Implosion / collapses are just a time where I should 've had fresh cash or
buying power to take advantage of the discount.

It always happens.

Sergio, thanks for the feedback.

i realize that the refinancing is an issue and probably the scariest thing
about the stock but the way i see it WHAT CHOICE DO THE LENDERS HAVE?
i could be wrong but i just dont see a lender not striking a deal AS LONG AS
THE COMPANY CAN GENERATE THE CASH to make some sort of reasonable payment.
everything is negotiable.

someone made a comment that buying the commons at these levels is akin to
purchasing a leap option (2014) betting on the company's ability to improve its
balance sheet over time. sounds about right to me.

Hi chainik -

That web link you posted is a good start. I would visit the web sites for the
company's listed and learn about their operation(s). Then pick a few and
download their annual report and read the chairman's letter to stockholders.
See if you agree w/ his vision.

NG is at a historical low and companies that can make money w/ these low prices
will be the survivors when prices eventually get back to historical norms. One
of my favorites that has exposure to NG, E&P exploration, electricity
generation/utility and mining aggregate materials is MDU.

I posted this list before and it is still relevant. It also include MLP's which
can be a little more complicated in their structure (A fund may be a better
play like TPZ). However, on this list are common stock names too.
AGL & MDU are two that I have built core positions in. CNX is another NG & coal
company but not a utility.

<img src='public/342737_b2db33d5b4b0b529c5b4ea62f69c5c50.jpg'>

Hope this helps.

If you find anything that catches your eye, post the company name and your
ideas. I also try to find hidden gems burred in their annual report that may
add additional value to the company in the future ( ie real estate, Joint
Ventures, small R&D divisions etc.).

You are correct, "no tree grows to the sky..."
Of course '01-'08 were agonizing. I know they were for me, huge percentage
losses. I would guess that was the case for most on the thread.
I'm old enough to remember from personal experience a certain "event" in '87,
and '08 was more painful, it seemed like it would never end.
As to the roller coaster and crash discussion, I will tell you I had a good
friend who time and time again asked me what he should do as the market kept
going lower. Wrongly, in the short term, I told him to hang in there.
He finally had enough and bailed in mid February '08, less than a month before
the low.
I wasn't faultless by any means in the '08 meltdown, but I do remember saying
"no mas" in an opposite sense, picking up the likes of KMB KO SYY a couple
weeks after my friend sold. Those quality names were just too cheap, KO was
yielding over 4%. The other two had juicy yields, as well. All three were large
caps with strong financials and many decades of operating history.

Hi Chainick. The future of NG in the U.S is subject to how environmental
controls can be developed. Besides polluting water and availability of water,
there is a rising concern that fracking causes earthquakes. But, there is so
much money to be made that all of the issues will somehow be resolved.

I have had difficulty finding a value play in NG despite looking in several
areas. It all leads to D being the dominant and safest play, by my dd. You
might want to start your research with this one stock.

Good Luck!

Thanks. I am 100% confident in my inability to rationally pick up future
winners in a sector that I am unfamiliar with, regardless of the amount of dd
:)

I'll certainly buy a few big pure play companies, but in addition I'd like to
add some risky NG-related stuff. I like eks ideas (LNG shippers, terminal
owners, steel pipe manufactures etc).

I noticed that Gundlach and Faber both like NG as long-term investment...
