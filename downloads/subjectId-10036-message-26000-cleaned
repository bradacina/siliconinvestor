Madharry,

I doubt you will ever see PSEC trade at a discount to NAV, although it got
interesting this morning. It is very rare for a BDC to trade below NAV, except
during its early years or a headline event occurs, a la resume-gate with MCGC's
CEO a few years ago. The BDC structure is very similar to REIT's in that they
pay no Federal taxes if they distribute most of their income to shareholders.
Thus, there are a lot of yield-hog, retail investors who buy BDC's. As a BDC
matures, dividend yield becomes the driver of price, with price/NAV being
secondary. Not saying PSEC won't trade below NAV, just that it will take
something significant to drive it there, which takes a gut check to buy when
everyone is heading to the exits.

Not pumping PSEC, as I do not own it, but I have been following BDC's for a bit
and find them interesting and often misunderstood.

Paul Senior, I am glad you mentioned ACAS because I have some additional
comments on them. I like their management team, as they have been very
creative. In the past year, they have created several funds. One is ECAS, which
invests in Europe. BDC's are restricted in foreign ownership, so ACAS only owns
the management company that manages ECAS. ACAS "just" collects management fees.
They are also starting their own private equity funds. In one case, they
contributed $670 million of equity investments into a private equity fund
called ACAS I, and act as the manager. That was clever because they converted
equity into management fees while retaining a portion of the upside in the
equity investments. ACAS is becoming part asset manager, which is much sexier
than a BDC (witness the irrational exuberance over FIG). One could argue that
ACAS deserves to trade at a lower dividend yield because a portion of their
income is smoother and has a higher ROIC.

I dont know much about BDCs however this particular incentive package makes me
want a margin of safety so if I dont get it let me invest in something where I
either think i have that margin like EDV.to which just report nav of $C 9.73 as
of 1/31/07 and is trading at $C8.48 currently. or a shoot for the moon type
play like brinks MOGIF for example. I guess SIL is somewhere in the middle,
where the Mad Hatter of Bolivia continues to depress the share price, with his
nationalization policies. Now that he has nationalized the the largest
independent smelter and alienated yet another international company, I would
assume that there will be no more banks investing or financing projects in
Bolivia. I sure wouldnt. So I guess that leaves Chavez, and perhaps
China/Russia. The smelter is owned by a Swiss company so I wonder if Bolivia
has any Swiss bank accounts.

7.54 million shares outstanding: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=PSAI
Sept 30 balance sheet shows 101,432 book and 81,285 tangible book.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=PSAI&annual

81,285 mil divided by 7.54 mil shares = 10.78 per share tangible book so it
sells at 13.03/10.78 or 1.2X tangible book.

Book with goodwill and intangibles: 101,432.

ACAS. a great press release this morning.

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/070213/dctu035.html?.v=79

here's what dividends have been the past few years.
3.68 for 2007 - projected
3.33 for 2006 - actual
3.08 for 2005

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=ACAS&t=1y

IMHO, the stock was undervalued 1-1-06 and is probably fairly valued right now.
maybe a couple of dollars too high. so we probably cannot count on too much
price increase this year. But long term -- if the dividend goes up 8% to 10%
per year, we should expect a 8% to 10% price increase in the stock. that keeps
the yield constant. add that to the 8% dividend and we get 16% to 18% annual
gain. cool.

As I posted, I sold a bunch last month, but still it is among my largest
holdings.

That was a great call on monogen Brinks.

There's a company that was recently spun off from Sentigen called
Sentisearch(SSRC.OB).I know one of the management guys there.I'm curious as to
your assessment, if you want to take the time to investigate.Here's a little
info:

BUSINESS

We were incorporated in Delaware on October 3, 2006. On October 10, 2006 in
connection with the spin-off, Sentigen contributed to SentiSearch all of its
olfaction intellectual property assets. The olfaction intellectual property
assets primarily consist of an exclusive license agreement with Columbia, dated
April 10, 2000 (the “Columbia License”), and certain patent applications titled
“Nucleic Acids and Proteins of Insect or 83b odorant receptor genes and uses
thereof.” We are considered a development stage company and have a limited
operating history.

The exclusive license agreement provides SentiSearch with worldwide rights to
certain of Columbia’s patent applications and other rights in the areas of
insect chemosensation and olfaction. The Columbia License gives SentiSearch an
exclusive license to develop, manufacture, have made, import, use, sell,
distribute, rent or lease (i) any product or service the development,
manufacture, use, sale, distribution, rental or lease of which is covered by a
claim of a patent licensed to SentiSearch under the Columbia License or (ii)
any product or service that involves the know-how, confidential information and
physical materials conveyed by Columbia to SentiSearch relating to the patents
licensed from Columbia (collectively, the “Licensed Products/Services”).
Pursuant to the Columbia License, Sentigen was required to contribute a minimum
of $1,000,000 into Sentigen Biosciences by April 2001 or be involved in active
negotiations to raise $1,000,000 in additional funding. Sentigen satisfied this
provision through the consummation of a private placement in November 2000 in
which 863,834 shares of Sentigen common stock were sold for aggregate gross
proceeds of $5,183,004. The Columbia License also required that a minimum of
$50,000 per six month period or $100,000 per annual period be spent on bona
fide research and development of the patents and licenses subject to license
from April 2002 through April 2004 or Sentigen must have been involved in
active negotiation to raise $1,000,000 in additional funding. Sentigen
satisfied this provision through April 2004. In consideration of the Columbia
License, Columbia was issued 75,000 shares of Sentigen common stock and will
receive royalties of 1% of the net sales of any Licensed Products/Services.

The term of the licenses granted under the Columbia License shall extend until
the later of the date of expiration of the last to expire of the licensed
patents relating to any Licensed Product/Service or ten years from the first
sale of any Licensed Product/Service.

The potential uses of the olfaction intellectual property assets derived from
the Columbia License consist of three families of patent applications relating
to (i) odorant receptors and their uses, (ii) cloning of vertervrate pheromone
receptors and their uses and (iii) genes encoding insect odorant receptors and
their uses. SentiSearch believes that the applications most likely to be useful
in the near future are in the area of insect control, because insects operate
entirely through sense of smell and taste for feeding, mating, locating
egg-laying sites and general navigation. Blocking the insect sense of smell and
taste may afford a potential strategy to inhibit insect reproduction, feeding
behavior, and prevent damage to humans, animals, crops and stored products.
Such a technology would not require genetic modification of the plant or insect
and may rely solely on compounds that are natural, non-toxic and compatible
with organic farming methods. This technology has the potential to offer a high
level of specificity providing for the targeting of an individual species,
reduction of environmental disruption and less chance of insect resistance.

In addition to the Columbia License we have certain patent applications
relating to nucleic acids and proteins of insect or 83b odorant receptor genes
and their uses. These patent applications relate to the isolation of a gene
that appears to be ubiquitous amongst insects. This gene has been identified in
various species of insects, including many that have a profound effect on
agricultural production and human health. The identification of this gene, and
the protein that it expresses, may enable the development of high-throughput
screening methods to discover compounds that attract insects to a particular
site (and away from one where their presence is undesirable), or develop
materials that are distasteful to the insects’ sense of “smell,” thereby making
agricultural products, for example, undesirable to them.

We believe that our olfaction intellectual property may be of value to
non-profit and commercial partners wishing to develop novel, safer and more
effective means to control pest insects through molecular manipulation of
insect olfaction and taste. This effort would aim to identify receptor
molecules that control key aspects of insect behavior and discovering compounds
that block or activate the function of these receptors and to identify new
compounds that may have use in agricultural crop protection and insect-borne
disease management such as agents that completely block the insect sense of
smell rendering an individual or a field invisible to insects. Other potential

21

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table of Contents

products include new and effective insect repellants and novel potent
attractants for use in insect bait stations and traps.

We believe the applications offering the greatest potential for developing
products in the intermediate term are for mosquito repellant to be sold by
household product companies. Other potential markets for our olfaction
intellectual property include:

• food production;

• agricultural chemical companies;

• organic; and

• pharmaceutical companies.

Following the spin-off, our executive officer and board of directors intend to
seek opportunities with non-profit agencies and with potential commercial
partners to leverage our olfaction intellectual property for the development of
control agents for biting insects, in particular, insect vectors of malaria and
other diseases. If these endeavors are successful, additional capital
commensurate with such an undertaking will need to be raised. In particular,
additional steps will be necessary to commercialize the intellectual property
assets, including:

• obtaining research and development grants;

• developing commercially feasible products

• filing and obtaining additional patents;

• entering into licensing, marketing or joint venture agreements;

• applying the olfaction intellectual property to a commercially viable
product;

• developing and implementing a marketing plan in conjunction with a partner or
licensee;

• controlling quality and cost in the manufacturing process in conjunction with
a partner or licensee;

• selling products on a profitable basis in conjunction with a partner or
licensee; and

• structuring an agreement that will enable SentiSearch to enjoy the profits of
its products.

However, there is no guarantee that commercial opportunities will arise from
our efforts to develop our olfaction intellectual property. We currently do not
have any research and development grant applications outstanding nor can we
predict whether we will receive any research and development grants or other
commercial funding in the near future. No commercially feasible products are
imminently foreseeable and we are not aware of any candidates interested in
entering into licensing, marketing or joint venture agreement with us upon
which we would be dependent in order to commercialize our olfaction
intellectual property. In order to commercialize our intellectual property
assets we believe we must enter into a transaction with a party who can utilize
our patent applications or feels our patent applications could not be
circumvented.

Competition

We face competition primarily from universities, including Yale University and
Vanderbilt University, who are conducting the leading research and patent
applications pertaining to areas relevant to olfaction technology. These
competitors have greater financial, management, technological, research and
development, sale, marketing and other resources than we do.

regarding Free trades: Wells Fargo has a better deal than BAC for now for those
with at least 25k in assets - 100 trades/year for free. I have an Etrade
account(grandfathered from Brownco) and they are Ok but free would be better.
Since I have a mortgage with WF I almost do not have an effective min.
requirement , so i am very tempted to try it out.

i'm not sure how 100 trades a year with WFC is better than 360 trades a year
with BAC, but neither is much of a threat to etrade, ameritrade, schwab, etc

etrade has said that since BAC introduced their offer, they have had almost no
loss of accounts, and in fact, they haven't even had many people call to
inquire about moving their money to BAC since the first week it was in place,
back in october

anyone who trades actively, and therefore generates trading volume that is
significantly profitable for any of these brokers, will quickly realize that
they are losing far more on bad executions than they are saving on "free"
trades

i also have etrade accounts grandfathered from brownco, and while the bulk of
my assets are with IB, i still run trades at etrade for certain situations
where they are better, and to maintain the accounts there to get IPOs, use the
power etrade at times, and for various other reasons

more and more of etrade's profits come from non-commission sources at this
point, and in the future more and more of their profits will come from
international customers, who won't have access to any of these free offers
anyway, so i don't see BAC or WFC having any impact on their earnings

JMHO of course, but listen to their conference call from Q3 2006 and i think
you will agree

The requirements to get the free trades are different. With WFC you get free
trades when the sum of checking, brokerage and 10% of you mortgage balance
(some other balances count as well) exceed 25K. With BAC you need 25k of
deposits in addition to you brokerage assets to qualify. This makes a big
difference you are like me and do not like to have 25k of (low interest)
deposits lying around.

In addition you get full checking with substantial interest as well as interest
on you MM balances on your brokerage account with both BAC and WFC, which can
add up to a few 100$ of interest as well ( E-Trades interest rates are crappy
unless you move money funds into their savings account).

I use IB as well and like them, their trading commissions are low enough that
it does not matter (1cents/share) in most cases, but in case of E-Trade 5 or
10$ trades can add up. I heard good things about the BAC brokerage account and
do not know how you conclude that their trade execution is worse than E-Trade,
but i appreciate if you could point to them.

I think you are right that E-trade currently does not appear to suffer much
from bank competition. However , every competitive threat starts somewhere and
I believe that the WFC offer is a serious one.

These CAT guys seem to do a lot to diversify, enhance the brand, and hold the
customer

Paul, I would add to your list of CAT strengths their diesel engine business,
which has moved from a propiertary model to now where 90% of sales are to
third-party customers. Engines make up 30% of CAT's sales. Engine inventory
concerns appear to be behind them. Engine/turbine sales were up 24% last Q and
engine margins were up 170bps because of better pricing and volumes.

Two weeks ago CAT affirmed '07 guidance and today came out with a stock buy
back.

Another plus IMO is CAT's top notch management. Current examples:

TOKYO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) said on Thursday it planned to
take control of a construction machinery venture with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd. as part of its efforts to beef up its presence in Asia.

Caterpillar, the world's largest construction machinery maker, is keen on
expanding in fast-growing Asian markets such as China as it sees a downbeat
demand outlook for diesel engines and heavy equipment as the U.S. economy
slows.

Mitsubishi Heavy, Japan's largest machinery maker, said Caterpillar is in talks
with Mitsubishi to raise the U.S. company's stake in their 50-50 construction
machinery joint venture to about two-thirds.

Mitsubishi Heavy spokesman Hideo Ikuno said the sale of part of its stake in
the joint venture, Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd., was in line with a
strategy of shifting resources to core businesses such as power systems,
aerospace and turbo chargers. Construction machinery is no longer considered a
core operation.

Late last year, Caterpillar said it expected sales in China to quadruple as a
percentage of its global sales by 2010 as the country rapidly builds more
ports, energy projects and roads, and moved its Asia Pacific Operations
headquarters to Beijing from Tokyo.

Caterpillar Asia Pacific Operations spokesman Jim Dugan said Japan represents a
mature market for his company where it makes high-quality products, and China
is a market with a large growth potential.

"It (the announcement) is really a sign of our recognition of the importance of
the Japanese market to Caterpillar and our commitment to that market and our
customers in Japan," he said.

Goldman Sachs analyst Kunio Sakaida wrote in a note to clients that he sees the
news as positive for Mitsubishi's stock price as it would enable the company to
concentrate its resources on diesel engines and turbo chargers, the outlook for
which is good.

The venture, established in 1963, produces and sells hydraulic excavators,
wheel loaders and bulldozers. It booked sales of 386 billion yen ($3.2 billion)
in the business year ended March 2006.

As a group, Mitsubishi Heavy had sales of 2.8 trillion yen.

Mitsubishi Heavy's Ikuno said the talks would likely see Mitsubishi Heavy's
stake in the venture fall to about one-third. The venture has capital of 23.1
billion yen.

**********************

NEW YORK, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc., (CAT) a maker of heavy
construction and mining equipment, said on Thursday it plans a new $7.5 billion
share buyback over the next five years, citing its confidence in long-term
growth prospects and cash-flow generation. 

The Peoria, Illinois-based company said its board of directors authorized the
repurchase program, which will start when the current $6.4 billion buyback
program is completed in the next few months, a year and a half ahead of
schedule.

The company expects to have 640 million shares outstanding at the end of the
new buyback program.

Caterpillar said its priorities for the use of cash remain capital
expenditures, acquisitions, funding pension programs and raising dividends,
with the rest devoted to buybacks.

The company also said Thursday it is in talks to raise its stake in a
construction machinery venture with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. .

Caterpillar stock rose $1.68, or 2.5 percent, to $67.84 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

if you use limit orders at the ask or below, i don't see how the market makers
can steal pennies from you based on an expectation of paying the ask

i never use market orders at any broker so i'm not sure if that is what you are
doing, and they are giving you poor fills as a result

i would suggest that if you are seeing a difference in the quality of fills in
terms of trying to hit the ask with a market order, and what you get as a
result, it may simply be that the american markets have much higher volume, and
with penny pricing, the shares on the ask don't just sit there for minutes at a
time, so whereas several hundred shares on the ask in brazil may be easy to
buy, several hundred shares of a high volume stock on the ask in america may be
gone before you can even click buy

looking at my quotes screen right at the moment, almost every stock has a
bid/ask spread of a penny...if you use a limit order to buy those stocks, there
isn't much a market maker can do to take your money

i own BAC and have for years, so i watch the yahoo chat board to some extent,
and read various articles, along with listening to the conference calls for
ETFC, which i also own

i have seen numerous complaints regarding BAC since they started this "free"
trading offer...most of them talk about not being able to get filled when a
stock is moving fairly rapidly...if you are trying to buy 1000 shares of
something and you have to move your price up even a dime because your initial
order doesn't fill, that's 100 bucks you just overpaid...how many "free" trades
does that wipe out? or what if you miss the trade entirely, because you don't
want to up your offer, and the stock moves up a couple bucks? there go all your
free trades for a few years

now obviously you are going to see the complaints on such things and seldom, if
ever, see the praise when they work well, but i've dealt with many brokers in
the course of almost 20 years of doing this stuff, and i know what it's like to
get poor executions...the kind of clients that ETFC and AMTD are after aren't
likely to switch to BAC or WFC to get a few free trades, because they have
likely seen the results at those kinds of brokers, so why risk it for a few
free trades?

as i mentioned, i do most of my business at IB, but even if i was back to the
old brownco rates, i wouldn't switch my accounts to BAC or WFC for free
commissions, because i have no idea what kind of service i would get, and at
least in the case of BAC, options, mutual funds, and other types of trades are
not included in the free deal, so right away i would be having to segment my
assets into even more accounts (IB doesn't offer mutual funds either, that's
part of the reason i still have some money at etrade)

trades at etrade are 6.99, so 100 free trades is basically 700 bucks a
year...after taxes that's maybe 40 bucks a month...i don't see many active
traders switching brokers and chancing poorer service to save 40 bucks a month,
especially since once the free trades are used up, they will probably be paying
higher commissions for the rest of the year

BAC brokerage deal seems to me to be a marketing ploy. If it doesn't work ...
or maybe if it works out too well, they'll just scoot up the commission costs
by eliminating the "free" trades or making the qualifications more onerous.

Of course, for this thread - presumably a Ben Graham value type thread - we
aren't traders here (ahem -g-), so the commission-free buys and sells might be
cost effective.

For me, no.

I'll keep my etrade/other brokerage accounts for reasons mentioned by Carl
Worth.
OTOH, it doesn't have to be an either/or thing. I may consider reviewing my
business dealings with BAC and Wells to see if I might be near qualifying, and
so maybe having the option of an additional brokerage account.

Aside: Anybody with an opinion to share on BAC at current price? "I own BAC and
have for years" too, and have been considering upping my position. (a little

To me there has been lots of good news in PLG.to that has not been reflected in
the share price. they had a couple of large deposits one in canada and one in
ghana but not much cash. they monetized the one in canda by bringing in hunter
dickinson setting up a new company called detour gold. detour gold had an ipo
of 10MM shares at $3.50 canadian. plg got a 47%ownership of the company
consisting of 20MM shares plus $5MM canadian so they can continue to develop
the ghana prospect, a huge area like 241 sq. km, which is right next to some
major producing mine. What is exciting to me is that that the share price of
detour gold continue to hold up around 3.40-3.50 making the nw of the company
around $75MM the market cap of plg.to is around $78MM
meaning the ghana deposit is just about free. Sprott is a heavy investor in
this company, which is also loved by J. Taylor a newletter scribe who
frequently appears on ROB.TV. I am pretty excited about this one.

Wow, did I stumble on some kind of trader's corner??? Can someone enlighten me
why I am hearing about "rapidly moving stocks", 1 cent difference in prices,
etc. on Value Investing board?

I have never used a limit order. If I want to buy, there is a sufficient margin
that I would want to buy the stock for 1-2 cents more. If I want to sell, it's
the same. If I spend my time trying to get "better price" of the day, I am no
longer value investing, I am fricking day-trading. And I have never had good
luck with that. Maybe your mileage is different.

Up to last year, most of my trades were at a full service broker. You know - up
to 3% a trade. And you know he wants to throw me out, since I only buy couple
times a year and sell even less than that.

If you are concerned about commissions and executions, you may want to check
whether your portfolio turnover rate is way too high. And BTW very few people
manage to outperform market with high turnover. ;)

jurgis-

we were discussing whether WFC and/or BAC's "free" trading accounts are a
threat to the businesses of ETFC, AMTD and the like...the subject had been
discussed previously when BAC announced their offer, and spek renewed the
subject when WFC joined the fray

you may or may not think ETFC or AMTD are reasonable stocks to be discussed
here...they along with SCHW have been discussed here at various times...i think
ETFC is a solid value buy at the current price...i'm sure you will let me know
if you think otherwise

if someone is going to evaluate investing in ETFC, they ought to understand
what etrade offers to its customers that would keep them from wanting to move
to BAC or WFC...my comments related to etrade's service, and why they offer a
compelling value proposition to a customer, that is far more attractive than a
few free trades...would you think the thread had gone astray if someone started
discussing annuities because they were evaluating LM? i wasn't advocating that
anyone trade more often, nor do i EVER post any short term trading ideas here,
so grow up

another person responded asking about a broker that would give him better fills
than he is apparently getting in brazil...you might think that is somewhat off
topic, but i answered him anyway

i think the posts were quite logical, and i don't think they caused the thread
to swerve wildly off course

since you yourself decided to continue it with a rather bombastic reply, i will
simply state that i do dozens of transactions a month, so yes, paying a dollar
a trade instead of 8 to 15 dollars makes a difference in my overall
performance, not so much because of the dollar amount of commissions, but
because of the flexibility it offers me to do trades i wouldn't otherwise do,
or would have to pay too much to do efficiently...last year i gained 25.5%, in
2005 i gained 32.5%, and in each of 2003 and 2004, i gained almost 50%...i'm
not sure how you calculate things in your ivory tower, but i'm pretty sure i
did okay vs. the overall market

thanks for your concern though

Carl and all - regarding the (perceived?) tradeoff between commissions and good
execution, the mileage various depending on yoiur trading pattern. I infact do
not trade much in my taxable account and I like to buy in smaller chunks (100
shares as a typical trade for a 20$ stock) so comission do matter. Many of my
trades are limit buys because i cannot trade from work, so I am not seeing much
of an impact on fills. of course if you average trade amount is 20K, then a 10$
commission does not matter that much, and I would go for the perceived best
execution - this is the Carl Worth case. For my case no frills is appropriate
and i guess for many others as well.

As far as WFC and BAC are concerned, i simply think they have figured out that
they can provide no frills trades for very little cost, so they can enhance
their banking relationship for folks like me, by adding free trades. I don't
think they see the brokerage business as core but i think the see E-trade and
the likes expanding in their turf with Savings& Money market account, personal
loans, bill payment, and they feel they have to counter. For me it sounds great
as i have more options to find the banking& Brokerage solution that suits me
best.

I agree that ETFC is unlikely to go under, as they are fairly diversified
already, but i think AMTD is much more vulnerable, as the % of revenues from
commissions still exceeds 50% i believe.

the response of course is that only certain clients make ETFC or AMTD any real
money

a client who has a sizeable account but keeps most of his money in cash and
only trades occasionally would still make ETFC a decent return, because having
those assets in hand allows them to loan them out and earn an interest rate
margin on them...however, that client isn't likely to have the bulk of his
money at a brokerage if he seldom trades...enter the etrade bank, which as you
say, is competing for those assets with other banks, and they seem to be doing
quite well at it

a client who has a sizeable account and trades quite often is the ideal etrade
profit generator...they earn commissions from his trades, plus they can loan
out his free capital to earn margin interest or other interest spreads...they
may also be able to get mortgage, insurance, or other business from this
client...this client may end up going to IB or some other firm, for equally
good executions and better commissions, but this client is unlikely to go to
BAC or WFC for the reasons already noted

a client who has a smaller account but trades often anyway, still generates
some pretty good income for etrade, and he may often use margin himself,
helping etrade to make money on all that cash they have...chances are this
client doesn't have the assets to set aside in a non-brokerage account to
qualify for the BAC offer, and even if they have a mortgage with WFC, to allow
them to qualify there, they are going to run out of free trades pretty quickly

a client who has a smaller account and trades infrequently is not very
profitable for ETFC...this is similar to all of us who use our credit cards
only to aggregate our purchases and earn rewards, and then pay them off at the
end of the month...the credit card companies will give us a card, and they do
make a few bucks on the fees they charge the merchants, but they don't make any
real money on us, and if we went elsewhere, they really wouldn't care much

as such, i don't see these offers hurting ETFC or AMTD, and the real world
seems to bear this out, as ETFC has seen basically zero effect on their
business from the BAC offer, which has now been in place for quite a while

i agree that ETFC is less reliant on commission revenue, and thus is the "wider
moat" play as compared to AMTD

JMHO, time will tell

p.s. by the way, it wasn't my contention that there is a tradeoff between
commissions and execution...IB has about the best executions you can find, at
their low rates...my contention is that companies like ETFC, AMTD and IB have
trading platforms that are excellent and are being improved almost on a daily
basis, to allow for quality executions...from what i have heard, BAC has no
such platform...i have no idea about WFC...again, a little slippage probably
doesn't matter at all to you or jurgis, because you are making transactions
here and there, as your investing style dictates, and that's great...the
difference is that for the people that ETFC or AMTD make the bulk of its
commissions from, the platform and the executions are paramount, and therein
lies their advantage

(partial rant) "the response of course is that only certain clients make ETFC
or AMTD any real money"

Carl Worth, I suspect you may be right in your conclusions as to who these
people are.

I don't like the conclusions though.

This week, I have been about 5 minutes away from contacting my attorneys
regarding Etrade. I have a margin account. My concern is simple: There is no
indication in my monthly statements or on Etrade internet screens as to what my
margin rate is. When I call customer service, they can't readily quote me my
rate. Oh, I can see the dollars deducted monthly, but the rate... no. (Rates
vary by customer account: larger margin users get lower rates. So they say. And
the rate can vary from month to month depending on what the broker has to pay
for their monies.)

I visited Etrade in person Monday and sat down with a "relationship manager"
and after five minutes, she finally found my rate...sort of. (by her access to
Etrade's records which are different from my Etrade internet screens)

On the one hand, depending on how much margin one has and the spread between
what Etrade pays for the money and what it charges the customer, it seems to me
that more money and profits are in the margin business than the cumulative
costs of the trading commissions. E.g. 300 trades a year got for $5-10 ea. is
peanuts to somebody (not me) who has lots of margin debt over a year.
Back otoh though, I must be wrong. It can't be I'm the only person around who's
(figuratively) jumping up and down in front of his wife yelling, "The xs?#z's
won't show me in writing what they're charging me!!"

I can't believe there are no big guys...big users of margin... who aren't
beating on Etrade to show them what their margin rate is. (That's show them in
writing, not some guy cooing a number over the phone, and only after you call
to inquire.) So maybe it is just as you say "a client who has a sizeable
account and trades quite often is the ideal etrade profit generator." Perhaps
margin clients just don't care enough about their rates or margin users are few
and far between at Etrade. I read that margin use is near (or at?) highs.
Somebody is borrowing money. I'd have bet most would like to know what rate
they're paying. ... and I just as well will bet that Etrade and other
brokerages would just as soon not tell them or make it as difficult for
customers to see as the law allows.

Oh well. 'Caveat emptor'

Upped my few shares of AHM a little.

Okay, so people say they don't have much subprime loans.

Alternate A loans they apparently do have. My understanding that's for people
who almost but don't quite qualify for standard loans. Perhaps because they
missed a payment once.
So I'm partly betting on these folks not to default in numbers like the
subprime people are apparently doing. Doesn't seem like that good a bet. (For a
few shares, and for the div. yield, I'll take a chance.)

Jumbo loans don't seem that safe to me either. Just because a family can afford
to get a $500k house loan and buy their McMansion, that doesn't mean they can't
default. Or have financial problems. And if they do, if they have more options
(sell house, move to smaller/cheaper place), that would still be turning in
loans (the jumbos) which may or may not hurt AHM who wrote them.

All in all, I'm not so confident of the company going forward. OTOH, I'm not
one who always needs to be confident before I take a position.

etrade actually just reported wednesday that their margin balances at the end
of january were 6.9B, so yes, lots of people are using margin, though the total
amount has not been on the rise...this is of course another reason that i think
ETFC is a good investment...even if they are just earning an average spread of
3% on that money by lending it to their clients, that's 200M a year in income

i went to the etrade site and was able to get the margin rates on this page:

https://us.etrade.com/e/t/pricingandrates/marginrates

i'm not sure why the person on the phone would have such trouble figuring it
out, but i don't think etrade is trying to keep it secret

i don't use margin at etrade, so i don't know if the rates have changed
lately...i know that at IB, they have been fairly steady since the fed stopped
raising their target rate

i use margin here and there, but not usually for more than a week or two, and
not in very large amounts, so i don't pay close attention to the absolute
rate...i would imagine that people who use margin in larger quantities probably
pay more attention, but i don't know that for sure

Carl Worth: Because

1) it's a bazaar out there, not a department store. It's a list price vs. a
negotiated price. (In other words, the advertised rate is not the same for all
customers.)

2) rates are changeable with no forewarning based on something named 'broker's
call rate'. Maybe also called base rate. That rate fluctuates and has something
to do with what it costs the broker to borrow the funds it lends. And of
course, the broker at any time can raise or lower the amount charged over or
below this base rate due to competitive conditions.

When I see "$xxx dollars based on average daily margin balance of $yyy dollars
for the period 1/15-2/04" deducted from my account, and knowing that margin
rates fluctuate, I believe I should also see at that point, the remainder
(hidden) portion: "based on a margin rate of z.zz%". And I am upset when I
don't see this. (And yes, it can be roughly calculated (annualized), but I want
to see how the exact rate changes month-to-month without me having to make
rough calculations. The broker makes the exact calculations; I feel I should be
able to see what the exact margin rate was for the period.)

In my limited experience with other brokerage accounts, it's only Etrade that
does not provide this information.

okay, i see what you mean about negotiated rates, that definitely affects what
any particular individual will pay

i have traded with numerous brokers over the years and some report the margin
debit with the average interest rate charged (brownco did), but some others
(including IB) don't...it's readily available on IB's web site, the current
rate that is, but if it changes mid month, they don't give you an average that
you paid

i guess it's always better to have more information than less, in terms of
financial disclosures, but since they give you the average balance and the
amount charged, it can be calculated as you said

it has been my experience that the amount charged above the base rate stays the
same...it's only the base rate that is adjusted according to their cost of
capital...this was the case at brownco and is the case at IB as well...it's
been years since i used margin at any other broker, so i don't remember how
those places figured their margin interest...as i said earlier, i tend to use
margin only in small amounts, and only for at most a couple weeks at a time, so
i don't keep a real close eye on the exact rates from day to day or month to
month

Jurgis Bekpuris: about "frequent trading reduces returns".

I am assuming you mean frequent buying and selling of stocks. And this
buying/selling or churning is what reduces returns.

Many people believe a classic issue for value investors is buying too soon.
That is, the stock continues to drop after they buy.
For me, I try to get around this problem by intending to make multiple buys ---
making additional purchases if/as the stock drops. So sometimes, operating in
this context as a value investor, I am very price conscious and commission cost
conscious. I will often check the stock's price to see if I want to add, and I
will often look to attempt to add at low intraday price.

I don't see this activity as trading. And I see this as enhancing returns not
reducing returns.

Well, I believe that's what I see. It's possible if I just bought once in one
big chunk, that that would be the best thing, and possibly I'm wrong not to do
that. I just am satisfied with this type of average down purchase plan.

Paul,

I do average down too. I do it only if stock drops additional 20% from my
purchase price. This way, I don't have many additional trades. I agree that
with cheap commissions it might be worth to change the formula and add with
only 10% drop or so.

IMHO, trying to catch intraday prices is still a waste of time, but... it's
your choice. :) I might have only had 1 or 2 situations in my investing
history, where intraday prices made a difference. There was this situation in
2000 when we invested in Linux software distributor for government, don't
remember ticker anymore, on this thread. And we got like 20 percent or 50% pop
intraday with wild volatility. Other than that, I don't remember a single
instance when intraday trading mattered materially to my results. :)

Although I'm old and my memory's shot, I too can't ever recall a time when
intraday trading (that is, buying at the low or selling on a spike)made a

the value of the portfolio.

Still, with my many stock positions, I believe I'm going to see portfolio

Paul, first of all it is not my goal to make you or anyone else to change your

trades. I also don't deny that brokerage costs are important. Of course,
anything that can lower your expenses will improve results by at least a bit.

On the other hand, I think it is meaningful that good results can be achieved
even with high commissions. And IMHO commissions are very low on priority list.
At least for me.

With my approach of adding on 20% drops, I believe that the most trades per
company I made was 4. Just for info. Of course, if we change that to buying on
10% drops, it will become something like 8-10 trades. Which I think might be a
better approach if commissions are low. How much better, I have no clue.

Jurgis,

I've had several times when intra-day trading, even pre-market and after-hours
trading, was material to my results. Unfortunately (or fortunately) you get
that with microcap/smallcap stocks.

Maybe they didn't have a huge impact on my yearly return percentages, but they
did have several thousands of dollars of impact each time, cumulatively in the
tens of thousands I would imagine.

The most recent example was MKTSQ.PK where I sold a few thousand shares on the
bankruptcy announcement in the high 1's to watch it subsequently drop to 0.50
and lower. Trading there partially mitigated a bad investment decision. At
other times, I have been able make a few thousand dollars buying, on a news
announcement, a stock I had studied carefully. With only $8.00 commissions, it
is well worth pursuing for my types of stocks IMO.

I will admit that at times I pull the trigger too quickly and will leave money
on the table or buy too early. However, I do believe there are instances where
a prepared investor can make substantial money from an intra-day opportunity,
most especially on mico-cap stocks, less so on larger cap stocks.

Hi Carl - Schwab now has Schwab Bank where they originate mortgage loans and
Home Equity Loans. I recently applied for their no points no fees Home Equity
Loan to have as a reserve since I have lots of equity in my home. They provide
a special rate for Schwab customers (1/4 pt better in rate). My current rate is
7.5% well below the Schwab margin rate of 10%.

It seems that all of these brokerage companies are expanding their products to
include new revenue streams. E-Trade with their new offering for Futures trades
is quite interesting. I wonder if other brokerage service will be selling these
products too.

As these discount brokerage services offer more products it is just additional
revenue streams that add to their total revenue. Trading fees are now much
smaller as a percent of the their total fees.

I can remember when it cost me $200 to buy 100 shares of stock through my
broker 30 years ago.... That's why I switched to Schwab. I now get all my
trades at $9.95 up to 5000 shares and can utilize the Schwab Bank services with
no additional fees. They do need to integrate their Money Link Service better
with Schwab Bank and the Schwab One accounts better but this will happen over
time.

Most of my financial assets are held with Schwab (both taxable and IRA). I
really like their electronic "Money Link" service and Bill Pay feature. Now
with their Home Equity offering, I can tap this equity through my Schwab One
account so when the "Ultimate Value Proposition" occurs, I have the resources
to capitalize on the event. This provides a much better proposition than using
"margin" which is available at 10%.

From:- with a K
More on CAT buyback: We all know the story of companies who announce a buyback
but never fall through with all of it. Note the language in this story.
Business is strong at CAT and they are confident about the future.

Feb 16, 2007 (Chicago Tribune - McClatchy-Tribune Business News via COMTEX) --
Caterpillar Inc. said Thursday that directors approved a plan to spend as much
as $7.5 billion buying back the company's stock and predicted the repurchase
will be completed "within the next five years."

If exercised in full at current prices, the buyback would take 17 percent of
the Peoria-based company's shares out of circulation. 

The heavy-equipment manufacturing giant noted the new authorization will
replace an existing $6.4 billion buyback approved in October 2003, which is
expected to be exhausted within months. 

By reducing the number of shares outstanding, stock buybacks automatically
raise the value of the remaining shares and are usually popular with investors.

In New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, Caterpillar's disclosure helped
the company's stock rise $1.46, or 2.2 percent, to close at $67.62.

The stock market's muted response reflects the reality that Caterpillar's
repurchase program will be spread out over years, during which millions of new
shares will be created as employees exercise stock options they've been
granted.

As with most repurchase plans, a good portion of the Caterpillar buyback will
be spent sopping up new shares that would otherwise dilute the value of
existing shares.

With the earlier buyback authorization nearly used up, analysts had been
anticipating announcement of a new repurchase program from Caterpillar, but it
was larger than expected.

Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Obin told investors that he had been expecting a
$5.5 billion buyback.

However, he said, "we calculate that the higher-than-expected buyback has a
limited impact on our earnings projections."

Wall Street values shares by applying a multiple to a company's per-share
earnings.

Thus, if a company has per-share earnings of $1 a year, and Wall Street values
companies in its industry by a multiple of 8, the company's shares should trade
very close to $8 apiece.

Buybacks, by reducing the shares outstanding, boost per-share earnings.

But Obin said his Caterpillar earnings estimates for 2007 and 2008 of $5.60 a
share and $6.05 a share, respectively, were already based on the expectation
that Caterpillar would spend $2.1 billion buying back its shares in 2007 and
$1.4 billion in 2008.

The larger buyback, he said, could add 2 percent or 3 percent to his estimates,
"which ultimately has a limited impact on Caterpillar's valuation."

When corporations buy back their shares, they are spending money that otherwise
might be spent on new factories, product development or other growth
initiatives.

However, Caterpillar isn't stinting on such outlays. The company, which has
recorded record profits for three consecutive years, is simply generating a
staggering amount of cash as it sells in a very strong global market.

"As has been customary for Caterpillar," the company emphasized Thursday, "cash
is used primarily to fund growth through capital expenditures and strategic
acquisitions, maintain well-funded pension plans and consistently increase
dividends, with remaining cash returned to stockholders through repurchase
programs."

CEO praises prospects

Chairman and Chief Executive Jim Owens called completion of the company's
previous buyback program more than 18 months ahead of schedule "a testament to
our strong cash flows and financial position."

He said the new authorization is evidence of "our confidence in the long-term
growth prospects of our company and in our ability to continue to generate
strong cash flows to grow our business and to enhance stockholder value."

Share repurchases are frequently more popular with stockholders than dividend
payouts, which generate immediate tax consequences for all holders.

In contrast, reducing the number of shares outstanding lets companies boost the
value of their remaining shares with no immediate tax issues for their
stockholders.

Caterpillar's new buyback program comes on the heels of mega-buyback
announcements from some other companies.

Earlier this week, 3M Co., a huge diversified manufacturer that turned in a
less-than-overwhelming performance in 2006, disclosed that its directors had
approved a $7 billion, two-year repurchase authorization that could take in
just under 13 percent of the company's outstanding shares.

Similarly, railroad operator CSX Corp. announced a $2 billion, two-year buyback
authorization that, if fully exercised, could reduce current shares outstanding
by 11 percent.

around 8% w/o profit sharing.

Forward PE is now in the upper range for shippers at 11. The company has

Perhaps CAT's next move is higher as it has been lagging CMI since July of last

Okay, so people say they don't have much subprime loans.

This isn't commentary on any company, just the mortgage business in general.

"Sub-prime" as a descriptor seems to have some confusion in terms of what it
means. Having been a mortgage originator, mortgage officer in two separate
banking firms and a mortgage broker, I'll share my definition which also may be
less than perfect.

To me the definition of "sub-prime" is anything that doesn't meet the FNMA
underwriting guidelines.

The sub-prime lenders will dress up their descriptions of their product with
more euphemistic terms like "Alternative A", but the experienced should not
lose sight of the fact that the credit and/or character of the borrower did not
meet FNMA's industry-wide standard.

Since FNMA has, through the ubiquitous use of automated underwiting, loosened
its standards quite a bit over the last 15 years, those borrowers who cannot
meet those standards ought never be viewed by investors as "safer" than others
in the same sub-prime pool.

The only major consideration between sub-prime lenders IMO should be whether
their mortgage exposure is solely first mortgages or not.

The 100% financings that were the rage for a few years recently probably
consisted of a lot of 80% first mortgages and 20% second mortgages. The second
mortgages would not have met FNMA guidelines so, by definition, were sub-prime.
In foreclosure proceedings, there is usually not enough equity received to meet
all the obligations of both lenders and the second mortgage holder usually
walks away with nothing.....a total loss of their exposure.

If this housing downturn gets as bad as I think it will get, eventually, even
the first mortgage holders in these 100% financings will suffer losses as they
won't be able to recoup even their much more limited exposure.

I won't touch sub-prime lenders for quite a few years yet. They are likely to
become much more shunned than currently and then, perhaps......

timba-

isn't an alt-a loan a case where the borrower has the credit history to get a
prime loan, but doesn't have every bit of documentation necessary to get that
prime loan?

as an example, AHM has an average FICO score on their loans of 710...is there
an exact minimum FICO score for a prime loan? i've read different articles
stating numbers from 680 to 720, but in any of these cases, AHM is at least in
the prime ballpark, and they buy insurance on the loans with higher LTVs or
where they feel there is greater than average risk

by comparison, NEW, one of the bigger subprime lenders, and one with a lot of
current "drama," has an average FICO score on its loans of about 620

that's a pretty huge difference it would seem to me

also, AHM has an average LTV on its mortgages of right at 70%, so that would
seem to alleviate the 80/20 concerns you mention as being subprime

perhaps i am missing something here, so i'm curious as to your views on this

Keeping in mind that my definition of sub-prime is: Anything that doesn't meet
FNMA's guidelines, then does it really matter by which criteria the borrower
doesn't meet those guidelines?

If the borrower can't document income (the most common malady in my
experience), that's a layer of risk sufficient for FNMA not ot accept. One
needs to be aware that the income (and other levels of) documentation goes down
under FNMA's automated underwriting as credit scores go up. So a score of 710
would have easy-to-meet documentation. If the borrower can't meet these
requirements, then one must assume the added layer of risk is a real one.

When I was in the business, FNMA would pretty much rubber stamp loan apps where
the borrower had scores above 680 provided that all the elements of the income
and history could be independently verified.

Scores between 640-680 with an adequate explanation of the problems which
caused the low scores could be approved.

Scores between 620-640 needed not only the explanation but also independent
third party confirmation of the events.

Below 620 were not underwritten.

I don't compare mortgage lenders so I cannot comment on the relative merits of
any.

As I said in my first post on this topic, sub-prime lenders will label their
products somewhat euphemistically. They also have different pricing for what
they consider to be varying layers of risk. But one must not lose sight of the
fact that they are sub-prime lenders, no matter what flavor lipstick they
happen to be wearing.

So one has to ask, perhaps: "Am I in an environment of increasing or decreasing
risk of problems for the sub-prime lenders?" or "Do I really feel as though I
have a handle on not only the standards to which these loans were underwritten,
but also the clauses which might cause them to be repurchased from the pools
into which they were sold?" or "Do I believe that the worst news for all of
this is fully reflected in the earnings reports yet?"

I believe we haven't begun to see ugly, that we don't have a clue as to how
much or how little repurchase fall-out and derivative protection (or lack
thereof) exists, and only a small portion of the overall impact is reflected in
the filings. But then, I've been wrong so many, many times that this could very
well be another.

Gretchen Morgenson

Will Other Mortgage Dominoes Fall?

IT’S amazing how long it can take investors to see that the wheels are coming
off a prized investment vehicle. Denial, after all, is a powerful thing.

But when an imperiled favorite happens to be a pool of asset-backed securities
— especially those involving home mortgages — denial can be compounded by
outright blindness to the real risks of that investment. That may explain why,
even as everyone concedes that the subprime or low-grade mortgage market has
fallen into the sea, the vast pools of mortgage-backed securities built in part
on those risky mortgage loans still appear to be on solid ground.

Investors, chasing the buzz of ever higher yields, have flocked into the
mortgage-backed market in recent years. Nobody wants to think that the
possibility of a wide-ranging subprime debacle is also a harbinger of looming
problems for investments tied to those loans. But the reality is that these
vehicles — and the collateralized debt obligations that hold them — are not as
secure as many believe. And that has broad implications for the capital
markets.

Consider how torrid the issuance of these securities has been in recent years.
In the last three years, for example, big banks and brokerage firms almost
doubled the amount of residential loans they issued, going to $1.1 trillion
last year from $586 billion in 2003. Many of these loans have been packaged
into collateralized debt obligations and sold to pension funds, hedge funds,
banks and insurance companies. For example, 81 percent of the $249 billion in
collateralized debt obligation pools in 2005 consisted of residential mortgage
products.

Collateralized debt obligations are made up of different segments — known as
tranches — based on credit quality. Because buyers of these securities were
looking for yields, subprime loans make up a large portion of most
collateralized debt obligations.

Wall Street, of course, has coined major money in this area. Mortgage-related
activities at the major firms generate an estimated 15 percent of total
fixed-income revenue, according to Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein.

BUT few seem worried about what might happen to these players if tremors in the
subprime market worsen, or if supposedly more-creditworthy loans in the upper
tranches begin to go bad.

One of the arguments for why mortgage loan pools have held up even as the
subprime mortgage industry has collapsed is that their collection of a wide
array of debt obligations provides a margin of safety. In addition, downgrades
on these loans from the major rating agencies have been relatively modest.

This is puzzling, given the wreckage in the subprime market — lenders going
bankrupt, stocks of issuers falling, default rates on new loans well above
historical averages. Last year, Moody’s Investors Service, for example,
downgraded only 277 subprime home equity loan tranches, just 2 percent of the
home equity securities rated by the agency. So far this year, the firm has
issued 30 downgrades, mostly on mortgages issued from 2001 to 2004. Among the
2005 and 2006 issues, many of which are defaulting at high velocity, Moody’s
has put 62 tranches on review for possible downgrade. That is less than 1
percent of the total subprime deals rated in those years.

“Seeing weaknesses in collateral or subprime loans, we have increased our loss
expectations by 25 to 30 percent,” said Debashish Chatterjee, a senior analyst
in the residential mortgage-backed securities area at Moody’s. “We see the
ratings outstanding on deals securitization in 2005 and 2006 and have taken
steps to provide credit enhancement on them.”

But credit enhancement does not necessarily involve cash. Instead, the cushion
can be additional mortgages or loans, which may also become vulnerable.

It is becoming clear, however, that subprime mortgages are not the only part of
this market experiencing strain. Even paper that is in the midrange of credit
quality — one step up from the bottom of the barrel — is encountering problems.
That sector of the market is known as Alt-A, for alternative A-rated paper, and
it is where a huge amount of growth and innovation in the mortgage world has
occurred.

The Alt-A segment of the market used to consist of mortgages issued to
professionals — like doctors — with unpredictable incomes. Now Alt-A is
dominated by so-called affordability mortgages — adjustable-rate interest-only
loans, 40-year loans and silent-second loans. You, dear risk-taking homeowner,
know all about these loans that allowed people to buy a house that might have
been beyond their means but looked attractive because they didn’t need to make
payments on the principal in the early years.

In 2006, according to UBS, interest-only loans, 40-year mortgages and
option-adjustable-rate mortgages comprised more than 75 percent of Alt-A
issuance. These loans often have little documentation of a borrower’s income
and rack up higher mortgage debt against the value of the underlying collateral
(i.e., the house). UBS said that 76 percent of adjustable-rate interest-only
loans written in 2006 had low documentation, while 57 percent had loan-to-value
ratios greater than 80 percent. No surprise, then, that 3.16 percent of these
loans are already delinquent by two months or more.

Worried?

Last week, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services put 18 classes of securities from
11 residential mortgage pools on watch for a downgrade. Alt-A loans were among
those on the watch list, but S.& P. said its move to credit watch status on
these mortgages would have no impact on outstanding C.D.O. ratings.

Relying on rating agencies to analyze the risk in collateralized debt
obligations may be unwise, however. Back in May 2005, Alan Greenspan noted the
complexity of collateralized debt obligations and the challenges they pose to
“even the most sophisticated market participants.” He warned investors not to
rely solely on rating agencies to identify the risks in these securities.

THAT is also the view of Joshua Rosner, a managing director at Graham & Fisher
& Company, and Joseph R. Mason, associate professor of finance at Drexel
University’s LeBow College of Business. The pair published a paper last week,
“How Resilient Are Mortgage-Backed Securities to Collateralized Debt Obligation
Market Disruptions?” analyzing C.D.O.’s. The Hudson Institute, a nonpartisan
policy research organization in Washington, financed their research.

Mr. Mason and Mr. Rosner find that insufficient transparency in the C.D.O.
market, significant changes in asset composition, and a credit rating industry
ill-equipped to assess market risk and operational weaknesses could result in a
broad financial decline. That ball could start rolling as the housing industry
weakens, the authors contend.

“The danger in these products is that in changing hands so many times, no one
knows their true make-up, and thus who is holding the risk,” Mr. Rosner said in
a statement. Recent revelations of problem loans at some institutions, he
added, “have finally confirmed that these risks are much more significant than
the broader markets had anticipated.”

Mr. Mason and Mr. Rosner say it is only a matter of time before defaults in
mortgage pools hit returns in collateralized debt obligation pools. Of greater
concern, they say, will be the effect on the mortgage market when investors,
unhappy with poorly performing C.D.O.’s, sell them and move on to other forms
of collateral. They cite the manufactured housing market as a disturbing
precedent; after that market collapsed in 2002, managers of collateralized debt
obligations avoided the sector.

A similar shrinkage could occur in the residential mortgage sector as defaults
mount. “Decreased funding for residential mortgage-backed securities could set
off a downward spiral in credit availability that can deprive individuals of
homeownership and substantially hurt the U.S. economy,” the Mason/Rosner paper
said.

So far, the pain from subprime defaults has been muted. Market participants are
cheered that lenders are finally tightening their loan standards, albeit a bit
late. Unfortunately, the damage of the mortgage mania has been done and its
effects will be felt. It’s only a matter of when.

while i understand your definition of subprime, lumping a loan portfolio like
that of AHM and one like that of NEW into the same "subprime" basket doesn't
seem realistic IMHO

even if you call AHM's portfolio subprime by your definition, a FICO score of
710 and an LTV of 70% is many degrees of risk different from a FICO score of
620 and an LTV of 81%, so that's far too wide a grouping to be functional for
evaluation

while i think the chances are good that NEW will survive, i sure wouldn't want
to bet any of my money on it, because i think even the current housing
situation bodes poorly for their portfolio in the short to medium term

on the other hand, i think it would take a severe downturn in the housing
market to damage AHM's portfolio

obviously we disagree on where the housing market is going, and perhaps that is
the majority of the difference...i think the bulk of the damage to pricing has
been done, and while the fact that lenders are tightening their standards will
take the lower end buyer out of the market to a large extent, i think all that
will do is keep prices in check for the time being...there still seems to be
plenty of capital out there, so it may even be that a lot of marginal buyers
will be able to buy houses, just with rates and terms that more realistically
reflect the risk the lenders are taking

if the economy were to worsen significantly and/or suddenly, then the outlook
would change to some degree, but that seems unlikely for the time being

JMHO of course, and like you, i've been wrong before, and likely will again <g>

here's a guy who thinks it's too late to short the subprime lenders...i'm not
sure i agree with his calculations of NEW's book value, but he does make some
interesting points...note also that on the site that anializer posted, AHM
isn't even listed, and resmae, which is at the end of the list, went out of
business due to 300M of loans being "put" back to them by merrill...as such, at
least in what seem to be the troublesome loans so far, AHM appears to have
little or no exposure...at the end of Q4, AHM had a total of just over 200M in
loans that were delinquent, and had already fully reserved against all of those
loans going bad, with a loss severity of 17%, so they appear to be very
conservative in their reserves

Therefore, it is important to understand the future direction of the company

However, one person who I've been reading alot about, Brian Arthur, believes

ROE. A growth metric. That's exactly what it is. According to the book
referenced below. ROE gives you theoretical growth rate. I use it as one
indicator of LT growth possibilities. But I do not put much faith an anything.

g = b x ROE, or in english:
growth in net income = retention ratio x ROE.

I like your list. I'll add a few
- proxy issues: related transactions, related directors, related family member
officers. ack.

- I do not like accounting restatements. They are frequently just gaming the
system to classify essentially normal expenses to be extraordinary.

- company buybacks do not impress me too much. I especially like insider
purchases which are funded by the insider. if I see a bunch of insider buys at
the same time, same date, I think those are company funded somehow. Better than
nothing.

- hard not to like a company with low PE, low debt, nice growth indicators, the
most recent press releases are optimistic, and insider buying is icing on the

Welcome to the board, ghmm.

Short answer: 18.65% or higher is a good ROE.

Long answer:
As you see, we each seem to approach ROE from a different perspective.

If we look at companies with consistent high roe, those companies generally
sell at high p/e's, and might be characterized as growth companies vs. value
companies.

In my experience, I've found it okay to use ROE as a proxy for ROIC and p/e for
earnings yield. Referring to the Greenblatt methodology, what he would be
looking for, is "high pretax roic" -- a growth company --- for a bargain p/e (a
value price).

There are at least two important considerations with ROE (roic) investing, imo:

The first thing is that ROE can't just stand alone: it has to be used in
conjunction with other value metrics. The Greenblatt stock buyer is essentially
a quadrant buyer: buy stocks in the upper right quadrant: high roic and high
earnings yield. Which prompts the question, what is the high roic (roe) which
goes in that quadrant? For me, my preference is a linear model: For any roe
value, what am I willing to pay for the stock? That is, a "low ROE", say 10%,
would be dismissed in the Greenblatt model, but for me, I can calculate a price
at which the stock might be attractive (for me). So for me, although I like
high roe vs low p/e, I don't need to characterize a company's roe as "high" or
"good" before I could get interested in it.

The major consideration is consistency. I prefer to look as far back as I can
to see how ROE changes. (Preferably doesn't change) That's usually about 10
years with the data programs I have access to. My preference is to use an
average ROE figure for calculations.

-----
I use GE as a proxy for a growth stock. Others may or may not.
I'm willing to use GE's p/e as a clue as to what a growth stock could/should
sell for (currently 18x). I guess I'll use GE also as a proxy for a "good" roe.
(Although GE roe has slipped compared to previous years.) I'll just use GE's
current roe of 18.65% and surmise >= 18.65% is a good roe.

I usually do not buy stocks with a ROE <15%. But there are always exceptions.

And BTW, I do also practice "thesis investing" once in a while, which has very
little to do with value or growth. India funds in 2001 (I think) was one of
these. Oil/gas in recent years is another one. But going without metrics is
always a scary proposition, so either allocate very small part of your
portfolio to the "thesis" or be very damn sure that your thesis is right. ;)

glad I was able to be of help this time. Sticking my head into the crocs mouth
I just took a small position in AHM. Its quite possible that someone like AHM
might actually benefit as the more marginal firms go out of business. I thought
I would get a home equity credit line and I must say that this is the hardest
it has ever been for me to get any kind of financing approved. I dont know if
its the times or the lender, but the documentation they are asking for borders
on the absurd.

from $1,588,034 in the same period a year ago. Gross margin, as a percent of
sales for the 2006 fourth quarter, was 28.5 percent compared to 29.7 percent in
the 2005 fourth quarter. Net income for the 2006 fourth quarter was $337,221
compared to $83,968 for the same period in 2005, or an improvement of 301.6
percent. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 includes the gain from the
extraordinary item for the forgiveness of debt of $87,500 which did not occur
in 2005. Earnings, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA), for the 2006 fourth quarter increased 175.2 percent to $473,394,
compared to $172,037 for the 2005 fourth quarter.

for 2006 increased 86.8 percent to $1,089,659 from $583,359 for 2005.

Dr. Steven Tsengas, President and CEO, stated, "The Company reported record
revenues and earnings for both the 2006 fourth quarter and full year that
exceeded our expectations. Further, the 2006 fourth quarter earnings are equal
to what they were for the 2005 full year. The Company's growth over the fourth
quarter and full year is a result of increased acceptance of our products with
consumers, the addition of Pet Zone products, successful marketing efforts and
benefits from our previously disclosed cost reduction initiatives.

"The second half of the year is normally the strongest period of the year and
we are pleased to report that the second half had record sales and earnings,
which bodes well for the coming year, as we introduce significant new products
that we feel answer the needs of pet owners. While we are optimistic about the
year, we expect our growth in the 2007 first half to be more in line with
historic first half growth rates as a result of new product launches, customer
purchasing decisions, manufacturing lead times and the seasonality associated
with the pet industry. We are working hard to increase our customer
distribution and with our suppliers to limit these quarter-to-quarter
fluctuations. We are excited about the coming year and look forward to sharing
our successes."

Re: documentation on home equity line. If that reflects a more cautious stance
by lenders, IMO it is something that is long overdue and to be applauded. The
"creativity" shown in mortgage loans has been legendary for some years and no
doubt contributed greatly to the housing bubble.

Bought MOT today at 18.84. The Icahn interest is still intact, as far as I
know. The factors which attracted him are still there, as well.
The Lehman downgrade today provided the opportunity to acquire the stock at a
lower price than after the Icahn pop.
