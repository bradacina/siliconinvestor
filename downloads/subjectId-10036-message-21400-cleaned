Brendan Watt, okay, following you into Reebok.

Small exploratory position. I'm going back and forth in weighing RBK as a buy.

Reebok stock's been a lot lower in past two years, and it may drop still from
its current relatively high price.

OTOH, the company's been able to increase profit margins every year for the
past six. Also ROE has increased every year for the past six. These are
significant accomplishments imo. Book value dropped in '96 from '95, but has
increased every year since. OTOH, it is (imo) a fashion business with tough
competition continually introducing new products. So these good financial
numbers work until they don't (if RBK has a bad selling season).

OTOH, the forward p/e per Yahoo is 10.6. That is a relatively low p/e for RBK
should the earnings materialize. OTOH, given profit margins of 5%, I figure the
stock isn't a great buy either - by my reckoning, maybe a fair value around
$45.

OTOH, if the company can continue growing its numbers, the stock will be
further undervalued. The company has sold its Polo operation to Ralph Lauren;
that should free up some cash, maybe focus management a bit more, and maybe
improve financial ratios.

I conclude for me it's iffy, but worth a very small bet now, willing to
increase it if or as stock continues to drop.

perhaps, though COSN is still a company with no path to profitability, that is
trading a little under cash on hand

their burn rate has been reduced sharply, but i don't know where the upside
would be

you had TUTS, a company with an inferior balance sheet that also has shown no
ability to turn a profit at any time in the near to medium term future,
offering to buy COSN with 6M of their shares, but i would argue that TUTS
shares are still overvalued at 3 bucks, not to mention the significantly higher
price they were at when the deal was announced, so they were and would still be
using an inflated currency to buy COSN's hard assets at a discount...no wonder
the deal eventually failed

perhaps another suitor will come along, but the terms of any new deal are
unlikely to be much better, given that COSN has ceased most operations, is
basically a lame duck company now, servicing existing accounts until they go
elsewhere, and has burned off 10M of its cash just since the end of Q3 '04,
though again that burn rate has slowed significantly in the most recent quarter

Fwiw, my response to the TUTS acquisition proposal for COSN was to ask my
attorneys to see if it was a takeunder and if there were any violations of
small shareholder rights. Subsequently we filed a suit against COSN. My
attorneys recently advised me though that after they further studied COSN, they
believe there's really not much value to COSN, and that consequently, they
believe my proceeding would not be advised. So we dropped the suit. I've sold
my COSN shares and have no opinion on the prospects for the stock or company.

(As regards, "not much value to COSN", those are my words (interpretation) of
what was said to me. I did not press for a clarification if it's that COSN is
too asset-poor or too cash-poor to possibly offer enough compensation to the
law firm for risk of suing COSN, or if the lead attorney believes there's not
as much to COSN assets as first appears (e.g. if one just looks a cash/sh. per
Yahoo vs. stock price), or if the attorneys are making a judgment of the
likelihood of COSN as an on-going business.)

re Via - added some more Via.b to my existing stash. Via & Via.b is now one of

broadcast/outdoors/radio and Cable/Film will unlock value. my guess is also
that the slower growth broadcash segment will become a takeover target. Via as
a whole is trading at an 10.5 EBITDA multiple - the slower growth part will get
at least tght multiple itself and the Cable segment should trade at a 14-15x.
With Redstone in charge Viacom never was a potential acquisition target, but he
is 80 now. I believe that the market undervalues Viacom asset and plainly
ignores that at least parts of the new Viacom entities may become a target
rather than an acquirer. I see reasonable upside potential and minimal risk.

I'll take a few shares of PDII from the new lows list.

Stock at stated book value withe 0 d/e. Per Yahoo, about $6.4/sh in cash (which
might include s/t investments); stock's at about $11.24/sh.

Company's been profitable 6 of past 7 years. Average roe over that timespan
seems reasonable to me given its book value and the price you pay for that now.

The company provides sales/marketing services to "biopharmaceutical, medical
device and diagnostics industries." It's possible that there are still
unresolved and undetermined problems with the business model of PDII. There's
on-going consolidation in the bio and pharma industries,and that has (imo)
reduced the number of contracts that PDII will get in future. There are
consumer grumblings that pharma companies spend too much on sales and
marketing. That could hurt PDII if PDII customers reduce such spending. (Or it
could help if the companies say they'll cut back on their marketing/sales
staff, but yet quietly shift some of that work to outsourcers like PDII.)

PDII is a stock that in its history has been both strongly liked and strongly
detested, as the chart shows:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=PDII&t=my

Perhaps PDII might again come back in favor. Seems to me that the strong
balance sheet gives the company some room to maneuver. I'm hoping that within
18 months or so, there'll be an up cycle to the stock, and that the down cycle
now, is abating. But who knows?

From your list, AIG news from Barron's:

Tweedy, Browne Co. LLC, which manages close to $12 billion, has compiled an
outstanding track record picking companies selling below their intrinsic value
by a wide margin. The investment company Tweedy, Browne is owned by its five
managing directors, including Chris and William Browne, and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Affiliated Managers Group, Inc., according to Tweedy, Browne's
Web site...

In the United States, Tweedy Browne has been "pecking away at AIG," based on
the belief that insurance remains a great business and that AIG has unmatched
international distribution.

Chris Browne also noted that in a worst-case scenario, if AIG paid the same
fines that Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and all other brokers and investment
banks paid to settle the research settlement case, it would be a manageable 50
cents a share.

"Our expectation is that in a year's time, as the air clears, you will be
looking at a business that is still 'best of class' and trading at somewhere
around 10 times earnings," Chris Browne said. "We think that's a pretty
attractive entry level."

Paul, does Winter's departure from Franklin change your thesis for owning WY?
Edit: My reading tells me it was Winters and Price before him that had the
cajones to stand up to management and force change.

I'm getting caught up on some reading and just found this. It is striking to me
that it is announced so close to the SEC filing.

Winters Leaves Franklin Mutual

CIO's departure a loss for the once-vaunted value shop.

by Terence Geenty | 05-10-05 | 02:08 PM |

Franklin Mutual is undergoing yet another management shakeup. David Winters,
who has served in a number of leadership roles at the once-vaunted value shop,
has left to start his own firm, Wintergreen Advisers, LLC. Wintergreen Advisers
filed with the SEC today to register a new no-load global value mutual fund to
be named Wintergreen Fund. From the registration, it appears Winters will run
the fund in much the same style he used at Franklin Mutual.

We consider this to be a significant loss for Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC. In
addition to functioning as the firm's CIO and president at the time of his
departure, Winters served as the lead manager at the following funds: Mutual
Discovery TEDIX, Mutual European TEMIX, Mutual Beacon TEBIX, and Mutual Shares
TESIX. Winters managed roughly $30 billion across these funds and other
accounts.

Naturally whenever anybody starts talking about undervalued assets in a company
like Weyerhaeuser, the immediate assumption is that they are referring to the
company's timberlands, which are carried on the books at values generally
believed to be well below their market value. We've already seen one report
claiming that Weyerhaeuser's timber holdings could fetch nearly $7 billion.
Ironically, of all the shareholder enhancement actions Weyerhaeuser might take,
spinning off or selling some timber assets and using the proceeds to pay a
special dividend or buy back stock would be among the milder ones in terms of
bondholder harm.

What we fear more than asset sale proceeds used for shareholder enhancement is
additional borrowings directed toward the same purpose. For example, the
company could borrow $2 billion to buy back stock and not exceed the debt or
leverage levels reached after the Willamette acquisition. Nevertheless, such
measures as debt/EBITDA and cash flow/debt would be materially weaker, as
buying back stock is a very different kind of transaction from buying a
profitable company. Under this scenario, we would expect the company to be
downgraded but to retain its investment grade status.

In the recent event risk climate, however, company managements are not stopping
at the investment grade border but plunging over the edge. Kerr McGee's
reaction to pressure from Carl Icahn is still fresh in bond investors' minds,
and in fact Mr. Icahn is also rumored to be interested in Weyerhaeuser.
Franklin has pressured another forest products company, Potlatch, now a
junk-rated issuer, to be kinder to its shareholders. We believe bond investors
should continue to avoid Weyerhaeuser paper.

Caterpillar declares 2-for-1 stock split, ups div 22%

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) on Wednesday announced a
two-for-one stock split and increased its quarterly dividend by 22% to 50 cents
a share from 41 cents a share on a pre-split basis. On a split-adjusted basis,
the per-share increase of 4.5 cents is the largest in the company's 80-year
history. The stock-split shares will be distributed on July 13 to shareholders
as of June 22 and Caterpillar's previously announced share buyback program goal
to reduce outstanding shares to 320 million will be adjusted for the split to
reflect an adjusted goal of 640 million shares outstanding by October 2008. The
new quarterly dividend rate of 25 cents a share is payable August 19 to
shareholders as of July 22.

I see the average for analyst's forecast for next year's earnings have risen
over 9%, from $8.39 60 days ago to $9.16 today.

My FV analysis in April was using an estimate of $8.39, the low then. The low

at less than 0.1 PS, still have a lot of debt but have gotten some breathing

Amoezzi, I'm not going to change my "investment language" by defining or
quantifying my qualitative words such as "a few shares", "took a position",
"exploratory position".

The reason is I want every stock idea I present to stand alone, regardless of
my opinion on it. If somebody likes the stock, let them buy and buy in amounts
they wish to commit.

If I say I'm taking a full position in stock XYZ now, or I've just made XYZ 5%
of my portfolio, people might believe I like the stock a lot, and that I'm
confident about its prospects, and that maybe they should look at it closer
too. Maybe just pay attention to it whereas they wouldn't ordinarily. Or maybe
look at it closer than other stocks where I say I'm buying just a tiny,
exploratory position.

But I have found for me, size of position is irrelevant to the success of the
particular investment. I do better sometimes by the stocks I only have very
small amounts of - stocks where I'm not confident of success. Similarly,
there's not much correlation between my liking a stock or being comfortable
with a stock and the subsequent success of that investment.

It's like this - if you are a craps player. The dice are cold, everyone at the
table is betting lethargically. Somebody new comes up to the table and starts
plunking down big bets, and saying, "We're going to turn this thing around, and
make money here!" The mood of the table changes with the positive player. Soon
people are more interested in what's going on, more people start to make little
bit bigger bets, and several start betting with the new, bigger player - making
the same bets as he does.

That is exactly what I don't want to happen here. The odds of winning don't
change at the dice table because somebody looks like he's making big bets and
yipping about it. So I believe it's best that I try to control my ego here so
that each stock idea I mention stands on its own and is not too commingled by
my bet size or enthusiasm.

For me to talk up either of my winners this year would be like the the

team trails 44-0 late in the 4th quarter. I will continue to pound the table
for EDV.TO my largest position. The company provides financing for junior
mining companies. and holds lots of shares and warrants. Its a black box in
that the company refuses to disclose exactly what it holds at any time and
audited net asset values are furnished but once a year. That being said the
company reported as of 5/31 a net asset value of around US $3.50 and the stock
sells for around US $2.15 . As far as I know the company is debt free. so the
position is pretty unleveraged except of course there could be considerable
upside from warrants if precious metals ever really soar. I also like
managements incentive in that it starts getting a share of profits after a 15%
return on equity is achieved. this would equate to a 24.4% on shareholder
investment at current price.

I'd guess it's roughly like this for me:

Consider a well-diversified portfolio. It fluctuates every market day. Consider
its average daily fluctuation over the past two months. Call it X dollars.

Generally, but not always, I decide in advance of buying my first shares
whether I am going to add more shares if the stock drops or else if I am going
to add more shares if the stock rises. Normally, I am a person who prefers to
average down (i.e. add to position if stock drops and make no adds if stock
rises).

"A bit" and a "few shares" would be buying those shares amounting to a dollar
value where, if the stock collapsed to near zero, the effect on the portfolio
would not be noticeable. That purchase amount might be .1 or .2X dollars -
however many or few shares that might buy.

An "exploratory" position would be more - maybe .3X dollars or more to start a
commitment, with the intent to add in increments.

Starting a small position might be one day's average portfolio fluctuation
committed to a new purchase, i.e. X dollars.

As an example, I have posted several times that I continue to buy a few shares
of YBTVA. And I continue to lose money on each purchase. Buying these shares
over time, I've cumulatively not felt any effect of these losses on my
portfolio or psyche. I'm not happy about the losses of course, but they are
passed, and they are built into my portfolio value now. Even if the stock drops
to new lows, I assume the drop will still likely amount to much less than one
day's average portfolio fluctuation (assuming the portfolio/market doesn't
collapse also at the time that YBTVA does). In other words, my losses haven't
been large enough or painful enough to shake me out. In fact, if the stock hits
new lows I am still willing to add a few more shares (bet .1-.2X dollars more)
on the company.

For me, it's not likely that I would want to be looking for something exciting
where the odds apparently are so good in the investor's favor that one would
consider going for a 5% or 10% commitment right away.

I have had trouble doing this even temporarily with even near sure things where
there's a takeover announcement (e.g stock at say $23 now with cash buyout of
$25 when deal closes year-end expected. Good annualized return. Only two points
on the stock though, so temptation for me is to buy lots and lots of shares.)
Just as I believe there are no no-brainers, I have scars that indicate there
are no sure things.

My number 1 position in my largest portfolio has been built up over several
years. And dividends were reinvested.

My number 1 position in my second portfolio has been built up over the past
year or so. I figure I've made maybe 20 or 30 additions to it since my initial
few share purchase. (That's adds - not buys and sell trades. As of now, I've
only made one small sell to re-allocate some monies.)

Broad long-term exposure to small-cap and micro-cap value stocks makes sense to
me.

1. They have a lot of company-specific risk that can be diversified away as
opposed to S&P stocks.

2. They generate historically large returns that beat general market indices
over time (although I'm not so sure about the immediate future given the great
run we've had).

It seems to me that the potential alpha (level of theoretical outperformance)
versus say a relevant index of value stocks has to go down with the higher # of
stocks in your portfolio, but I don't know of index that tracks Paul's eclectic
choice of stocks, so I don't think conventional wisdom applies here necessarily

"It's difficult to out perform the market holding over 200 positions."

Well, yes! -gg-

When's it ever not difficult to outperform the market?

And are we talking consistency here, as in "consistently outperform"? I see
that adjective used a lot. Seems to be important to a lot of people. (Should it
be?)

Should even a realistic objective be "outperform"? What if somebody had goals -
retirement, fund kids education - normal stuff like that - could that person
achieve goals just as well by equaling the market, if that person invested over
15-40 years?

-----
There's Bill Miller who's beat the S&P average for a dozen years running (if my
number is right??) and makes headlines for doing it. Turned somewhat around,
that means a 500 stock portfolio (I believe 500, right?) - a large grouping of
specialized stocks - beats one heck of a lot of mutual fund managers (who have
a lot fewer stocks than 500 stocks they're owning).

If a person only guessed about concentrated portfolios run by fund managers,
should the person easily conclude and be correct that these guys' results
outperform or consistently outperform the S&P 500 because these guys have an
advantage being concentrated? I'm not one who so easily believes this is true.

That S&P "index" is not a fixed index and it's cap weighted. My little
portfolio is the same - managed a little more, and weighted too, in a different
way. I'm trying to say, I would like to believe that unless somebody knows
something about me (how good or bad an investor I am), it's not correct to
believe or assume I might be getting lower returns than I otherwise would if I
held fewer stocks. Or that I have lower returns than others might get who have
a lot fewer stocks in their portfolios than I do.

Presumably I'm totally wrong here - after all, most all these managers are
CFA's, so they've taken those ethics courses from the Institute, so it must be
perfectly legit and proper, per their professional standards, how they publicly
manage and promote and speak to their prospective and current fundholders while

Hey Paul,

Re: Bill Miller

I believe that Mr. Miller has "outperformed" the S&P 500 (net of fees) for 14
years straight.

RE: Does "active" Management add value?

Yes, you are absolutely correct, that a passive index such as the S&P 500 beats
actively managed funds the majority of the time. However, one must exclude
"sector" funds, since those managers have to invest in a particular sector --
e.g. can you imagine a "gold" fund several years ago?

One of the key reasons why the S&P outperforms active management is turnover.
It has been proven time and time again that high turnover equates to low
returns (on average, of course).

Holding a concentrated portfolio of large cap stocks seems reasonable and makes
more sense than a large portfolio of micro-cap stocks, unless in the later case
you are really certain about your analysis. I'm not certain about mine.

However, a one year horizon to test your strategy has little statistical
significance, particularly since you are holding a concentrated portfolio. You
could be "lucky/unlucky" one year and have the exact opposite results the next.
That is why these undiversified funds often top the performance charts one year
and are at the bottom the next --- the stocks they are overweighted outperform
one year and underperform the next.

That's not to say that the strategy isn't worth testing, but I'd hesitate to
make any earth-shattering conclusion using only one year of results.

Yes, the ole' issue of what does managing a concentrated portfolio mean? Many
people have reported they only have maybe 10-15 stocks. They say that's all
they can manage. But that's at any specific time. At any given time, the
portfolio might look quite different from any other time. Lots of portfolio
turnover. So whereas I might've figured the person has researched, decided
upon, bought, watched and held maybe 10-15 stocks over maybe a year to 18
months with maybe a couple adds or deletes, it turns out it's often like 40 or
more different stocks the person has gone through in that "10-15" stock
portfolio.

That doesn't even account for the number of trades the person makes. On any
particular stock the person could trade in and around the position (having the
same stock as a trading stock and a core holding). Plus there's often option
trades. And if so, now the time factor has to be considered as yet another
variable adding complexity.

Then, depending on how much $$ one has committed to the market, we could be
talking somebody's serious money. So if somebody has 10-15 stocks or maybe
25-50, many people - I assume - figure they can't really afford (dollar-wise or
psychologically) to be wrong and have a blow-up catastrophe on their hands if
one of their stocks collapses. So they have stop orders on most/all stocks. (Or
maybe some sophisticated option hedging.) Stop orders which they periodically
adjust. Which is another aspect that has to be spent time on and be weighed and
factored by the person for his/her portfolio.

So to me, what initially appears as a simple, maybe okay, little (i.e.
concentrated)portfolio, instead is in reality something often quite complicated
and difficult - leading to the possibility of many error judgments.

To my way of looking at it, stock trading, turnover, options, stops - that's
like doubling or more the complexity and difficulty of the portfolio. Maybe
that doesn't hurt the expected good portfolio performance, but maybe it doesn't
help either.

Anyway, when somebody says that my having so many stocks (I've no options or
stops) doubles or more the complexity of a concentrated portfolio, I just have
to wonder if that's so.

A comment and observation I often read about stocks and investing, is related
to "groups" of stocks, or sectors, or Indexes etc... Investors will base their
stock choices on what is happening in these areas, rather than concentrating on
finding INDIVIDUAL QUALITY stocks which exhibit those criteria which will
ensure future price increase and growth in profits and VALUE for shareholders.
I have developed an Investment Package which requires a company's Fundamentals
to satisfy several critical criteria. Only when a company can fit this "QUALITY
TEMPLATE" should one consider purchasing this stock.
But that is only the first step in a total of three requirements. The other two
are to then determine whether or not the stock is currently too expensive or
relatively cheap. And the final step is to calculate a target price the stock
is very likely to achieve, in order to compare this percentage price increase
with other QUALITY companies, and then choose that stock which is likely to
provide the investor with the greatest price increase.
All in all, this strategy is based on searching for, and identifying INDIVIDUAL
COMPANIES, and not spend too much time on what "groups" or "indexes" are doing.
An individual QUALITY company's performance is very rarely related to what
others are doing.
And the best of all, is that the "tools of the TRADE" to achieve all of the

To me, having a concentrated portfolio means owning a certain number of stocks
AT ONE TIME. Over the course of the year, a person could very well buy and sell
40 stocks. It all depends on the opportunities that present themselves. (Warren
Buffet commented at this last annual meeting that he was always selling stocks
that were undervalued when he was managing his hedge fund. The reason was
because there would be better opportunities elsewhere.)

I believe it is a good idea to use risk mgt tools like options or stop-losses
in certain situations. Sometimes an investor may have a great investment, but
the timing may be wrong or something unexpected occurs. It is not that
complicated as long as one follows simple trading rules consistently.

Well, the following may be of interest. A BIG negative, in my opinion, is the
massive amount of INTANGIBLE ASSET that sits on GCI’s Balance Sheet. It amounts
to over 65% of GCI’s Total Assets ! The thing about Intangibles is who knows
what their "value" is because, invariably, the company has evaluated them.
Next we notice that GCI’s price has been falling steadily from a high of $91 in
April ’04 to its current $75. I suspect this is due to the recent falling off
of Turnover, excessive long term debt, falling EPS and a poor showing in what
GCI is earning from its Employment of Capital.
One last consideration is GCI's current P/E of about 16. Based on a calculation
I do, using a stock's EPS, DPS and best bank interest rate, I believe GCI's P/E
should be in the region of about 10. Therefore, if GCI was exhibiting QUALITY
fundamentals, it would be a "bargain" buy at P/E <= 10.
I believe the same would apply to TRB.
Of course, the above would mean little if one were ‘shorting’ these stocks !
But all this is just my opinion.

My conclusions different.

"So GCI is in favour?" Only as a buy for me. Not in favor in in the market of
course as seen by its declining share price.

"A BIG negative, in my opinion, is the massive amount of INTANGIBLE ASSET"
The valuation numbers the company or anybody else has put on the the
intangibles are irrelevant to me. I only care about the results those
intangibles can produce. Even if I assume the intangibles are worth zero and
produce zero, the remaining assets produce the net profit margins that are very
good - imo.

"...excessive long term debt...". I don't see where the debt/equity ratio is
outlandish compared to past years.
And debt, at $4.7 Billion, seems to me adequately serviceable by free cash flow
of $2.2B dollars (numbers per Yahoo).

"Therefore, if GCI was exhibiting QUALITY fundamentals, it would be a "bargain"
buy at P/E <= 10."
Looking at high-low p/e's, I don't see from S&P report where GCI's ever traded
below p/e 13 in the past ten years. The business model for newspapers certainly
is under attack, maybe in jeopardy, so the p/e could drop to maybe 10, giving a
price of $50 (based on about $5/sh eps est.). That'd be a bargain all right,
imo. Stock hasn't touched $50 in five years. It could again, but my bet is such
a bargain as that is not foreseeable any time soon - partly because the company
continues to increase stated book value, revenues, and dividends year after
year (so far).

"poor showing in what GCI is earning from its Employment of Capital"
It looks to me like GCI is getting about 9% roa - up a bit from past years. For
you that may be a poor showing, but for me that's a pretty decent number, and a
good number when I consider what I have to pay for it (stock price).

I particularly like the net profit margins that this company can produce.
Consistently very high and averaging maybe 16.7% over the past six years. This
metric has to be put into context though - what price am I willing to pay for
each percentage point of margin? For me, based on a calculation I do, the stock
is inexpensive - a buy - based on past profit margins (16.7%).

All jmo. I could be wrong.

To reduce risk, a small position within a diversified portfolio.

Fwiw, Scott Black, participant in Barron's Roundtable, has picked two companies
for their midyear review cover story, both stocks of which have been discussed
here before (and in which I have shares - not doing too well with though
lately):

"Benjamin Graham used to talk about "a margin of safety" -- high ROE, low P/E,
free-cash generation. That's what Helen of Troy and Arkansas Best have."

For those here who might also have Citigroup, I see too in that Barron's
article that it's still a pick of John Neff:

"I'm still big on Citigroup and St. Paul Travelers."

----
And for those of us still holding or considering beaten down advertising
company Interpublic Group, there's a positive write-up on it in this week's
Barron's:

"THE BOTTOM LINE:
Interpublic's stock, which is trading well below its historical multiples of
earnings and sales, could rise by more than 35%. If the company continues to
get its house in order."
