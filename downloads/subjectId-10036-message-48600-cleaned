It is remarkable to see a stock hitting on so many valuation metrics, must be a

The stocks mentioned that don't get any comment can turn out to be the best
stocks. It has happened many, many times here, and will continue to happen.

Tell you what. You've been here three months and made nine posts. If you
believe you are seeing some of the best alleged stock picks that are getting no
comment and believe these stocks <u>should</u> get comments, then YOU post
comments on why you believe they are "some of the best". Better yet, put some
of your money on the line with a buy. That'll be much more productive than
advising me how I should go about investing my money.

I have found in my experience --- how much experience again did you say you had
in investing? -- that oftentimes the stocks of companies are cyclical and that
I can reenter and profit from them a couple or more times in a business cycle
or over a couple of cycles. Further, I've found in looking for value stocks to
purchase, sometimes the best purchase opportunities are with stocks I already
own. Therefore, to me it's important "to look at old stuff and page numbers" if
you are referring to me with this comment.

Hi Shane,

Just came upon this interview with Jim Rogers.

Oilprice.com: Are there any alternative sectors you're more bullish on than
others? Say solar, wind, geothermal, hydro?

Jim Rogers: No, no. They all have pluses and minuses. I'd be most optimistic
about the ones that are economically competitive. I guess atomic energy is most
economically competitive.

Oilprice.com: What are your thoughts on
http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Pressure-to-go-Green-is-Le
ding-to-Higher-Energy-Prices.html ? Is there a future for this power source or
due to public safety perceptions is it something politicians will feel forced
to abandon or sideline?

Jim Rogers: I don't think people will abandon atomic energy. It is competitive,
it is economic, it is very clean if controlled. If it's not controlled it's a
disaster of course. I suspect you're going to see another revival of atomic
energy. The French, the Koreans, the Chinese, many countries are going forward
with their nuclear power development plans.

>>clown - u have something against quants? hahha<<

I have nothing against quants per say. but when I read stuff like that:

“Most trend followers are on the same side of the trades, so when we get a
risk-on environment, they get hammered hard.”

"Trend followers employ strategies that aim to take advantage of momentum in
prices, whether rising or falling. They look for signals that a trend will
continue or is about to end, often using technical indicators, such as moving
averages, Bollinger bands and price envelopes."

“The advantage of these sophisticated systems is that, by removing the
influence of human emotions, all investment decisions can be effectively
back-tested,”

I think these are people with more money than brains, but then again it is not
their money, it's their clients. Momo approach (because Momo always outperforms
in the short term ?).... trend following.... backtesting.... Sophisticated
systems, removing influence of the human emotions (and brains ?).....

I think this worked well in the 2008/2009 meltdown maybe and now they are
trying again and again. The bad performance in June suggest that most of these
funds were short and found themselves on the wrong side of the boat when the
ECB actually did something.

My belief is that most hedge funds are not value oriented. the reason for this
may be that they think depending on value is a tough way to make money and it
is easier to program a computer to look for technical trends and just let them
have their runs. It probably would work but there are many that are doing the
same things, and probably with the same stocks.

re GLW - this stock has been discussed quite a bit in this thread. Jurgis and
potentially others own it. they do have a good balance sheet and they are cheap
on metrics P/B.

They made for many years a lot of money in display glass, which goes mostly
into LCD manufacturing., they were the biggest producers. In this business, the
margins have collapsed, some LCD companies (LG) decided to become integrated
and produce their own glass and overall the end user demand is crummy (3D LCD
faltered).

My guess is that the good profits in this market are gone for good and they
need to find a new big product (like glass fibers in the late nineties, LCD
glass in 2003 etc.) to get their margins back.

Sergio - i don;t have a lot of money, therefore i hold only one position:) and
when i invest, i do a lot of homework. For example - I have been invested in
SLE since April 2011 and i did not budge no matter what anyone said unless my
own thesis kinda started to wayne down- something that did not happen.

Today, the performance on my SLE has been pretty good on that stock although it
was casted away by lot of people. if i ran a $10M portfolio, then something
like SLE will constitute 5% -6% of my total portfolio.

As for ABT - you are asking me a very critical question. I cannot give an
opinion without really looking at numbers. But taking a quick glance - ABT
holds Generic, nutritional and diagnostic business and the pharma was spun off.
All three segments are promising in a sense that generics are going to make
money, diagnostics are also growing with the whole preventive care theme taking
hold among people. Nutritional business has seen recent M&A activity with
Nestle buying PFE's nutrition division. The firm has abt 20% ROE and operating
margins in a 25%+ range, a PEx below 20. so those are good things. Decent Div.
yield and trading at about 8x-10x cash flow. I don;t know if they have said
anything in terms of debt on the balance sheet or if they will restructure the
balance sheet? Also drugs such as Humira that were cause of concern are getitng
spun-off. So whats left might make a good growth story - which is what you
hold, i assume?

MRK, i haven;t taken a look so i better not give any advice.

ON LAZ and BX - I have to look at their books. Also Lazard has an interesting
history. I read the book on the bank written by Cohan named "The Last Tycoons".
Its def. a play on M&A cycle, however, they are advisory. I doubt they finance
the deals which is where lot of money can be made in addition to advisory - but
i can be wrong. But there is no one to replace wassterstein or Felix Rohatyn to
this date and the company has been very cyclical, so i am a little cautious.
Either way, i have to look at the business model and books before rendering any
opinion.

They are also growing their new diesel filter product division. Their plant in

diesel cars and trucks.

It's probably good (for me) to do another add. My last small buy was in May
2012 around $12.38. Maybe I will put some into the IRA as they recently upped
their dividend. (2.3% yield)

Also, director Gund Gordon made a recent big bet (150K shares for $1.92M) in

I guess where the question arises with the statement is how quickly
alternatives will become competitive for an increasing # of projects. Most of
what I read comes from the Alternative Energy threads, but it impresses me how
quickly costs for alternative energy are coming down, and are continuing to do
so.

I obviously don't know how this race plays out, but I was surprised at how big
an impact alternatives are making at present. Lots of hurdles admittedly, but
is a strong datapoint I'm trying to learn more about for investment
opportunity.

"Renewable power, excluding large hydropower, accounted for 44% of all new
generating capacity added worldwide in 2011 - up from 34% in 2010. This
accounted for 31% of actual new power generated, due to lower capacity factors

Re HPW- The bookvalue is meaningless, since most of it is goodwill ( their

4$/share, their earnings are shrinking rapidly.

The real problem is the LT outlook, the personal computer market is probably
past it's peak and so is printing (most people don't print much any more with
the proliferation of better and larger LCD display).

I am not sure that Whitman ( and the board) is up to the task; she sure is
better than Leo A. But that does not mean much. FWIW, I don't think that
turnaround stocks in tech have much of a margin of safety, because the range of
outcomes is huge and the markets and product cycles are moving quickly. That

Only reason i was mentioning UPL was that natural gas as we all know has

shifting to oil vs natural gas. the supply will decrease and demand will rise

prices will not last. But the slightest increase in price and demand will cause
this stock to go only up. Although I believe the current prices are very low
with a good margin of safety, Investors can wait put it on their watchlist and
when it reaches (if) back to 18.00 dollar range (which it did 3 weeks ago) then
buy it. UPL is the most low cost producer of natural gas compared to everyone

The only reason why HPQ earnings fell sharply over the last 12 months is
because of write-offs. Yes the balance sheet is terrible but when purchasing
deeply discounted stocks you won't find perfection, hence the deep discount.

With their cash flow they can improve the balance sheet. At current price they
don't need any break-thru products for their stock to increase 50%-100% IMO.

Looking at Whitman's game plan, so far she has reduced management by merging
two divisions, stepped up new product introduction including new notebooks in
the sub $700 market, a large storage device and new cloud products, and has
announced plans to lay of thousands of employees. The co. still maintains a
fleet of seven jet airplanes that cost millions to maintain and they are
pouring money into their cloud initiative with no plan on selling off or
discontinuing any of their operations.

IBM, a major competitor of HPQ has a tangible book value very similar to HPQ's
but HPQ is currently trading at a 60% discount to IBM on PE. On these metrics,
HPQ is a value stock, but I agree with you that HPQ's survival is at risk due
to a highly competitive market. A good historic example of what could happen to
HPQ is the pre Silicon Valley high tech companies in Mass. that are no longer

I agree with your conclusion on tablets representing the new wave. Tablets are
a disruptive technology as described in <u>The Innovator's Dilemma</u> by
Clayton M. Christensen

This is the type of analyses that shows why you can't go with just using
formulas to find value. HPQ qualifies for a value pick using the GN but there's
more to the story than the math. You can't use charts either. Just because its
trading at lows does not mean it is a value stock.

And in this case, disruptive technology offers a good excuse for increased
typos. It's always about convenience and price despite maybe not as good

Hi Nik. Thanks for your comments on LAZ, BX and ABT.

On ABT, its trading at multi year highs. I think the spin off is priced in and
I will be selling. MRK I think is about to hit its head on the ceiling so I
will sell it as well. Perhaps investors looking for div. returns have pushed
stocks in this sector up too much.

LAZ, you're right. They manage assets and have been around for over 100 years.
They don't have the risk or the capex involved in other financial activities.
It's a simple business plan. They make money when there's mergers and
acquisitions. The co. has been reducing costs and....well, here's Barrons take:

BX - I like their strategy of buying foreclosed property and becoming
landlords. I don't fully understand some of their business and cannot properly
evaluate this investment idea. The chart is not attractive either. But the div.
is not bad. This is probably not a good idea but I bought in.

Re BX- looks like you have to deal with a K-1 tax form if you buy BX units? One
thing thatirks me about these asset managers is the dilution (unit count
increased mor than 10% YOY) that seems to be inherent with these private equity
asset managers. The unit issue seems to be nothing than disguised compensation
to me, and I noted that in some cases, the unit count increases faster than
assets under management.

It's hard to create value for the unit holders with a framework like that. The
dilution is the reason why I am taking a pass on them, I looked at BX, FIG and
OZM. I noticed that some value investors seem to like them but I think most of
them seem to ignore the dilution, or believe this is due one off items. I think
it is inherent and create a big headwind for the unit holders.

It's just that i think LAz peak earnings may not be much higher than 2.5$ and
then you are paying more than 10x for peak earnings, which is not cheap.

M&A don't occur much when credit markets are strained, because they need M&A
run on cheap financing. That is why M&A collapsed in 2008 and to some extend we
are seeing a reduction in M&A in Europe, where credit spreads are elevated.

Kronos Worldwide Inc. (KRO)

I started back my small tracking position in KRO @ $14.81/share. These shares
are in the IRA where the dividend is important (not so much the daily price
swings). I will go w/ the insiders and their recent buys. I did notice that
there is a gap in the chart around $9.85 (7/2010). That will be where I pick up
more share (below $10.00/share) if there is no negative company news.

Wellpoint buys Amerigroup:

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/wellpoint-buying-amerigroup-4-46b-111656719.html

I own AGP and I have mixed feelings about this. It's a decent pay day but I
liked the company, thought it was well managed, and it had good growth
potential.

I do find it interesting that WLP is doing this as cash only with no stock
(though possibly some debt). They obviously think their stock is undervalued. I
don't generally do insurers - I bought AGP after I had some dealings with them
and was impressed. When I checked out their stock it looked obviously cheap
even for an insurance illiterate like me. Since I now have some cash looking
for a home, I guess I'll have to turn to WLP and take a stab at understanding
them.

The Barron's piece is suggesting $3.50/share or more is possible.

You are right that M & A activity has started slowly so far this year, but
there are forecasts for big increases particularly in manufacturing sector,
video game sector, pharmaceutical and medical device makers, and in regions
such as the Middle East and Africa. I don't make large bets on any one stock,
so I am comfortable with collecting the div. and riding it out for now. There's
not much downside risk and there are expectations that the div. will be
increased shortly.

Just saw that JCP is targeting the untapped gay market.

Hi Sergio - Trying to figure out you over valuation thesis for ABT and MRK. I
own both and peeled off a few shares of MRK in 2/2/1012 at $38.55 thinking it
was at the high end of it's value range. Both ABT & MRK continue to run higher
(more than 10% from my last sale). It appears that the market likes the drug
companies again especially after the Supreme Court ruling on health care.

I am not sure what it all means other than the value metrics we are looking at
are not the ones Mr. market is viewing. I am not buying at these levels but I
will continue to hold.

Can you be a little more specific as to why ABT and/or MRK are considered over
valued in your opinion. Here was my reason why I though MRK was fairly valued
at $38.55/share on 2/2012 ( http://goo.gl/zo1lb ). I based my opinion on the GN
value. Maybe I need to recalculate using the EKS$ (which is based on future
earnings). Perhaps an additional value should be added for being a beneficiary
of the Obama care legislation.

For now, it is probably too late to find new values in this sector except for
one or more of the medical equipment stocks like BDX and/or MDT.

China stock basket?

PWRD, GAME, XIN, CCM -- all seem cheap to me and are returning cash to
shareholders via dividends and buybacks.

As Paul warned, they all could be scams and paying dividends to juice the stock
price so they could sell more shares, but this doesn't make sense to me. There
is no guarantee they will get a return on the cash they pay out (in fact, none
of the share prices are really up all that much). If they were scams, why not
just keep the cash?

At this point, I am thinking about owning a basket of these stocks in order to
reduce the risk from an individual issue. If there are good ideas from the
board, I'd love to see them.

I would much prefer larger/well-regarded stocks and/or stocks buying back
shares and paying dividends to stocks with just ridiculously cheap valuations.
Right now is "show me the money" time. If a company is at a PE < 5 and not
buying back shares or paying dividends (GURE, SPU a couple examples), I think
the management must either be corrupt or incompetent and am not interested. I
want to see the companies doing right by their shareholders.

That being said, the stocks have to be cheap enough to qualify as bona fide
value investments.

This may be the reason for today's sell off in KRO.

<u>NA Q3 TiO2 flat, first failed price effort in more than 3 years</u>
03 July 2012 19:44 [Source: ICIS news]
http://goo.gl/ApBU0

<blockquote>Buyers said the third-quarter effort was defeated by excessive
inventories stemming from impoverished demand thus far in 2012. Most sources
expected demand to remain soft for the remainder of the year.</blockquote> To
me, input prices are no longer rising (and in fact may decline) which should
help KRO at least maintain current margins and in fact expand them (in the
future).

The key for KRO, is to lock in their long term sales contracts with their key
customers (ie gov agencies). If they do, they are a money machine and should
generate some healthy FCF. There may be a slight fall off in overall demand but
the stock seems to be over reacting down over 7.8% to $14.46/share today.

I may continue to add to my small position if the stock continues to sell off.

XIN dividend:

In May, I had an ADR fee of $10.75 on a dividend of $172.00.

What's got me more interested lately is they have already bought back $10
million in stock and reupped the buyback to $20 million. There is some hair to
it -- including money borrowed from a hedge fund awhile back at high rates --
not well justified by some potential acquisitions that never took place. And of

I am not sure how much this may advance INTC into the next-generation

be due to AMD's warning that Q2 sales are off 11% from a slow down in Europe &

Either way, I do not think my $30.00 price target is in the cards any more and

ABT is selling at a PE higher than its 5 yr avg. Using this metric, its fully

ABT's chart has a gap in March at about 56. The gap is within its present
trend.

MRK is selling below its avg. PE but has a pending court case involving VIOXX
that is impossible to factor. I overlook this when I bought the stock.
Looking at the chart, MRK has several gaps, with the most interesting one in
Dec. 2011, just under 35. This gap is above the 200 day moving avg. so its
within the present trend and fillable.

Normally, I let stocks hitting new 52 week highs run. With MRK and ABT, for me
it was time to sell today and book the profit. I think the pharmaceuticals are
overheated technically and that abusive practices by the pharmaceuticals is
just starting to hit the newstands.

re CLF - "Is there a value opportunity here?"

Credit Suisse, which is available to Etrade customers has a pretty extensive
report (dated 5/14 not the newest one). in a nutshell, they don't like CLF too
much and don't think it is undervalued. They value the iron ore plays based on
a future curve that assumes lower ore prices of around 90$/ton going forward.
In their scenario, CLF does not look good, mostly because their pipeline of new
projects is higher cost, which does not generate a high enough profit at
90$/ton. BHP and Rio as well as an Canadian ore play are preferred:

https://www.etrade.wallst.com/v1/common/pdf.asp?docKey=453-CSFBW50_450377-1&Com
onentType=PRES&researchProvider=CSFB

The report brings up some good points (mostly around their pipeline of new
projects), regarding CLF that I had not considered when i purchased my shares.
I think it was a serious mistake to establish a full position (that I have
mostly sold out of at a loss) but not ready information that was freely
available to me. Same mistake than with XLS, where I acted to late on the
pension issue and it cost me some.

Note to myself - gather more information, even before establishing a starter

On M&A - Clown and Sergio -

I just want to make few points - US corporations have historical amount of cash
on balance sheet, on and off shore. Simultaneously, we still have an ongoing
deleveraging cycle and lot of macro headwinds for consumers to actually go out
and spend a shit load, therefore organic growth has slowed down. Earnings
estimates have come down due to two main reasons - one, because EPS comps have
gotten tougher and second the spend is not what firms thought it will be.

However, we still need to grow. How will we do that? Firms will do that
inorganically! However, there needs to be a catalyst to drive the M&A thats
building steam. For example - healthcare is going to see M&A - legislative
catalyst from obamacare. Wellpoint acquisition on monday is a case in point so
is an acquisition by Thomson Reuters.

Therefore you have to just look for catalysts that will drive the M&A growth. i
believe there will be a lot of M&A in distressed sectors undergoing
restructuring, or where there are considerable margin expansion due to
legislative catalysts which opens up avenues for growth and EPS expansion.

Just some quick thoughts.

Nik, my earlier post included areas where increased M & A is expected. There
are several areas, both nationally and internationally that I have found, but I
am not interested in investing directly in M & A.
Just took a position in LAZ to diversify my portfolio.

As far as Obamacare as an investment vehicle, beats me how anyone can make
money on that. Wellpoint acquisition was going through with or without
Obamacare from what I read. I don't pretend to understand Obamacare beyond the
basics, but how does someone play it? And, if the Republicans win the election?

Agreed on U.S. companies having a boatload of cash. Payout ratio on dividends
for the S & P 500 are at historic lows.

On BX, I don't understand the entire company, but their real estate purchases
are being made on foreclosed property. So, they rent it out for a few years
until real estate is worth buying again. Currently rental prices have shot up
so the landlord gets to enjoy someone else paying the mortgage with some pocket
change to pay the div. on the side, while he waits for home prices to improve.
EKS first brought this up on this board and I think Paul Senior had some
positive comments on this issue as well. Unfortunatly, we could not find direct
investment vehicles into this trend other than REITs or community banks.

sped up the process.

In any case, the health insurers will have a hard time to get the pricing right

There are some stocks you ask about (Phillips), there are some stocks you seem

"Again, i have not looked at XIN."

I have difficulty understanding what you are saying, especially as I tend to
take things very literally.

"But there are other better names to invest"

I guess almost logically, there will always be better stocks to buy than any
particular stock we are buying at the moment. There are so many stocks in the
universe, we just may not know about the ones that are better than our current
picks. And as for "better <u>names</u>" - if I focus on the word "names", then
yeah, there have got to be thousands of stocks with better/well-known names to
choose from other than a dinky obscure Chinese company called Xinyuan Real
Estate Co., Ltd.

If I translate your comment though to be "there are other better stocks to buy
for an investment than XIN", which is how I've assumed most people reading your
comment would understand it, then at the least, I would expect you to have
looked at XIN before you made this comment.

You posted the link to Cintron stating it was your log. Right?

I did a search on the author's name, Stocklemon, and it led to another website
that also had issues with illegal stock trading as did Cintron.

As far a QCOR as a short candidate, it does not take much research to forecast
that a one drug co. is going to need something to keep up its high valuation.

Just being the devil's advocate but are you the dubious Cintron, Stocklemon
etc. ?

By the way, Cintron has a lot of Chinese ear to the ground type info on their
website.

<blockquote>Right, however, how much of that M&A market will Lazard going to
capture? Something to ponder about. I have not seen them on many recent
deals.</blockquote>
I haven't a clue as to LAZ' market share, but you heard of the Anheuser-Busch
InBev and Grupo Modelo deal?

Or the Walgreens and Alliance Boots deal?

LAZ was involved in both.

And I know you heard of the SLE deal. Yep, Laz was involved in that one too
even though you didn't notice.

<blockquote>On BX "Currently rental prices have shot up so the landlord" - you
are absolutely correct! However we are investing for the future. How much will
they be able to milk of the current uptrend in rental prices, if they just
started buying real estate? </blockquote>BX didn't just go into business last
week. Some assets are ready to hatch.

<blockquote> BX- looks like you have to deal with a K-1 tax form if you buy BX
units? One thing thatirks me about these asset managers is the dilution (unit
count increased mor than 10% YOY) that seems to be inherent with these private
equity asset managers. The unit issue seems to be nothing than disguised
compensation to me, and I noted that in some cases, the unit count increases
faster than assets under management.</blockquote>Yes, you have to deal with a
k-1 for BX units.

They do have a handsome equity reward for their managers. From the last 10k:

<For the three months ended March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011, the Partnership
recorded compensation expense of $222.4 million and $426.3 million,
respectively, in relation to its equity-based awards with corresponding tax
benefits of $5.5 million and $4.2 million, respectively.>

Please correct me if I am wrong but the compensation seems to be ok as the
shareholders have not been cheated. I just looked at the last two years.

The increase in shares is lower than the increase in income comparing 2011 to
2012.
Around 12% increase in shares but 18% increase in net income.

Re Bx- i looked back further. In the 2007 10-K, they had ~260M units and 100B$
under management, now the total number of units has doubled and the Assets
under management are a bit short of a double. Seems like the unit value is
treading water while the GP is richly rewarded no matter what. I looked at FIG
as well and I found the situation to be similar, the units seem to increase, no
matter what and that creates a headwind that is hard to overcome. All imo, i
found the finances very hard to understand.

sergio - I am saying that Citron writeup on QCOR cited an article that has
become one of the main thesis behind their research. That article they cited is
written by a good friend of mine who does not work for citron by for biopharma
insight . Biopharma is also cited in the research note by citron.

That research on citron is not mine. I don;t know what you mean by "it was my

on BX - i am talking about residential rentals and the article you sent me
talks about CRE. I am fully aware that blackstone has been in real estate for a
very long time. Read the book on Steve called "King of Capital". An interesting
read.

anyways, my comments were related to you saying that they are buying up
residential properties. Did I misunderstand what you were saying?

In addition, lot of BX's debt is coming due from 2012 -2014, so if they sell
assets, thats something you might want to keep in mind.

On Lazard - they are within top 12 on the league tables, so yes they have done
well. To be involved in a deal and to be the lead deal maker on a particular
deal are two different things. For example - Goldman did about 190 deals in
2010/11 compared to 88 for LAZ. But i i am sure you have done your homework:) I
have nothing against LAZ. i was just raising questions.

I always appreciate your feedback. Thanks.

Note: This is my write-up but newsletter writer Ron Struthers did a much better
job and it is his pick. I will share excerpts later.

exploration, acquisition and development of both conventional and
unconventional onshore petroleum assets in Australia’s Southern Georgina Basin.

PetroFrontier’s common shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the

Georgina exploration permits EP 103,104,127 and 128, in addition to pending
exploration permits. totaling over 14 million acres.

 

PetroFrontier Corp. –Enormous Australian land position averaging 87% working
interest on 14.1 million acres. Will use horizontal drilling and multistage

"Xinyuan Real Estate Co., Ltd. (“Xinyuan”) (NYSE: XIN) is a developer of large
scale, high quality residential real estate projects aimed at providing
middle-income consumers with a comfortable and convenient community lifestyle."
-- Middle income people are hurting right now, or if i may say so, the real
estate frenzy has affected their spend.

Two points i wanted to make were -

One, why are you buying XIN, except the fact that they are trading at low
multiples?

Two - if you want to play chinese real estate, play it on a second derivative
level. By that i mean, invest in a company such as XYL which is a play on
Chinese real estate in addition to other things. You don;t have to invest in
XYL, but you get what i am trying to say? Point being, when there is so much
turmoil in that market, why do you want direct exposure when you can indirectly
participate in the real estate industry there via firms that provide services
to real estate industry? XIN is buying land from the govt. and then developing
property. thats a long cash cycle and with demand potentially declining, they
might not get enough return on their investment.

I am also intrigued about the sudden increase of their cash balance almost 10
fold from 2010 to 2011. In addition, i don;t know how they recognize revenues.

also "Our business requires access to substantial financing. Our failure to
obtain adequate financing in a timely manner could severely adversely (1)
restrict our ability to complete existing projects, expand our business, or
repay our debts and (2) affect our financial performance and consition" ---
Although monetary policy has eased, but credit has been tight in china.

"We provide guarantees for the mortgage loans of our customers which expose us
to risks of default by our customers." - do you know the credits of their
customers?

My point is - risk maybe much higher than the reward and you maybe investing at
the peak of the cycle.

If i were to play china, then there is a huge demand in grid technology and
nat. gas technology. if you invest in those sectors, you will have some very
serious winners over long term.

Hope it helps and thanks for your questions.

BX - I think that the residential real estate that they are buying is at a low
price - it's foreclosed property.
And that they will do the same thing with the residential that they are now
doing with the office/CRE. Take a profit when the market is ripe.

Yes...LAZ compared to GS completed about half the deals but its market cap is
just a fraction of GS'. GS as pointed out recently by Clownbuck does offer a
compelling value based on its metrics.

On your identity issue, I was just playing the devil's advocate as well as
showing you I read what you post.

Looking into who stands to make a profit from Obamacare and the only area I
think is viable is the hospitals. Presently they are burdened by having to
provide service to patients without insurance and Obamacare would provide
relief.

Nikhiljog: XIN. I'll explain it or justify it this way:

This is a Ben Graham oriented thread. It is therefore metric based. As in
stocks trading at low multiples. With some historical relevance.
(hopefully/usually)

1. Yes, I am buying XIN here precisely and only because it is trading at low
multiples.

2. I did not go out looking for Chinese real estate stocks. I have no desire to
be in Chinese real estate in either a direct or derivative way. XIN came into
view with metrics I liked. (With not-so-good historical support though) The
stock found me. I bought. Pretty much that simple, rightly or wrongly.
