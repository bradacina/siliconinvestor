Dippy,
Yes you can purchase bonds using a regular account, margin rules are
usually more attractive on Bonds or Debentures.
Investors Business Daily has a good snapshot of numerous bonds and main
details. The market is not real attractive for convertibles now because 1. Its
high and many bonds trade above Par and 2. interest rates low.
I usually stick to exchange traded debentures (There is too much spread between
the bid/ask otherwise)and research companies and then see if they have an
attractive convertible security.
My best one right now is Eagle hardware (EAGLG) and I hedge the position with
shorts and/or options and try and make a buck on the volatility (Right now if
it goes up or down I make money).
Its less risky and can be a very lucrative way to be in the market, probably
about 30% of my market position is in convertible securities.
Scott
PS: I meant it, having a Plan and being disiplined are very very important...
Also while I've been in the market for 15+ years its only the last 2-3 that
I've had a clue of what I'm doing, I still have stock in my account that would
cost me more to sell than its worth from those times...

It has been my own experience that if only I had not picked any dogs, than my
portfolio performance would be a lot better! Pretty obvious in hindsite, but
when one is placing that order for that shiny new stock, the sky is the limit.
Unfortunately, I did not have the discipline to set a stop-loss order on a few

In value investing, how does one avoid investing in companies that are too
small?

It seems there are a number of companies that are fundamentally sound with low
or reasonable PEs and PSRs and high current ratios. Growth ranges from none to
so-so and more. Over time, the companies get a little larger, but their stocks
do nothing much.

I hold one stock that has NO trades on some days. The company, I fear, is about
the same size it was five to ten years ago. Fortunately, there is a dividend.

Anyway, are there any rules of thumb to follow? Number of shares outstanding?
Minimum growth rate? Average trading volume? Likelihood of investment by mutual
funds? Total capitalization? Minimum quarterly revenue?

Any thoughts appreciated.

Hi Lonnie :

The size of a company is usually measured by total market capitalization.
Generally, you can use the median market-cap of the S&P 500 as a guideline. You
would then have to develop a sense of far down you can go from there.

Thanks Scott Mc. I will research the topic of convertible bonds and who knows,

Yes, it is discipline that gets us there. Looks like it is mighty tough for the
average investor to be disciplined these days! But in my case it is far easier
because I tend to disagree with my friends on almost any issue, be it politics,
religion, films, the legal system, economics... you name it! So they are not

But because they are my friends, they don't want to say it again and again, so

Over the weekend, I was reading Bill Staton's "The America's Finest Companies
Investment Plan". He recommends non-dividend paying stocks with consistent
earnings increases (at least 10 years) for a regular (i.e. taxable) account and
stocks with consistent dividend increases of at least 10 years (in other words,
Dividend Achievers) for a non-taxable account like IRA.

In the taxable account, any company whose annual earnings suffer a decline
should be sold off, and in the tax-sheltered account, any company which fails
to increase its annual dividend is thrown out.

Some of his other suggestions are : to restrict the total number of companies
in the two accounts to about 10 or 12 at the most, with each company
representing a different sector (to keep the portfolios truly diversified), to
dollar-cost average on an annual basis and to keep the portfolios reasonably
balanced, keeping in mind the costs for commissions and also, in the case of
the regular account, taxes.

As a follow-up to my previous post...

It is far easier for companies to be Dividend Achievers than to be "Earnings
Achievers" (to coin a new term). Therefore, it is more likely that our
portfolio of Earnings Achievers has a higher turnover than the one that has the
Dividend Achievers...

Ironically, the former would be in a taxable account while it is the latter
that would be in a tax-sheltered account! Well, looks like we cannot have it
all, I guess! :-((

From:Paul Senior

Yes, I would like to know if there is any supporting data for this methodology.
Seems like it should work at first glance. Pretty hard to argue against going
with diversified portfolio of earnings gainers and dividend growers. -g- But
I'll try anyway -g-. It certainly does seem like a surefire way to get
America's best companies in a portfolio. I just wonder if these are America's
best investment values. You pay up for really good companies (Buffett has said
his failure to do this could or has cost him plenty), but I wonder if you miss
out on buying value. If one of these earnings growers has a bad year, I suspect
it will be reflected in the price when you have to sell it (selling at low
price). Lots of excellent companies have a one year setback - the excellent
ones can recover (make up both their earnings drop and price drop) (Sigma
Aldrich, some pharmaceuticals, come to mind). Instead of selling, then this
(the time of low price) would be a time to add to positions. As for dividend
growers, I'd like to see the correlation to an increase in stock price. Steady
dividend growers mean steady stock price increments also? The problem with
basing a portfolio on dividends - or the problem I have anyway - is - patience
to hold. As I posted before, I can collect lots of dividends and see the stock
price basically steady. In a bull market, who cares about dividends when other
methods show 50% increase in stock prices in a matter of months or weeks (e.g.
SGI). It could be easy to get seduced from the dividend approach when cogent
cases can be made for some of the stock posts and successes seen in SI. :-)
Just felt like writing. Neither attacking nor defending any particular method.
Lots of ways to invest and to improve investing skills. Each must optimize
his/her own route to success IMO.

Paul Senior :

This approach is meant for people who don't want to be bothered by the
day-to-day events in the stock-market and the economy, and who cannot go into
the detailed analyses of why a company hit an earnings glitch. In short, this
is really a substitute for mutual fund investing.

The important thing to remember is -- once you implement this strategy, you
have to follow it to the letter. A little tweak here and there, and pretty
soon, you realize you have drifted from the strategy!

I understand that it would be highly profitable to buy a stock when the company
hits an earnings glitch. But it takes a lot of research and analysis to
separate a bombed-out stock from a Super Stock (to use Kenneth Fisher's
terminology from his book, "Super Stocks"). You could do this too, if you have
the time and the ability to do so. Just keep the two portfolios separate and
distinct.

Steve Romick of FPA is pretty darn good IMO. Anything he recommends is
definitely worth a value investor's looksee. He seems to do things very right.
Analyze thoroughly, buy right,stay patient for long term
success. (and achieve that success)

In my own mind, I tend to lump stick builders (Washington Homes, Pulte, etc.),
"mobile home" builders (Clayton Homes, Liberty, Coachman, etc.) and coach
builders (Fleetwood, Skyline, Coachman, etc.). They're not really the same
industry, but a lot of the companies compete in what seem like multiple
segments. We've seen some good discussion on Clayton (recommended by one or
more people as a buy in the 12-13 range, I think (now it's 15), and very
briefly a hardware supplier (Amex listed;but I forgot name). As far as I can
tell almost all the companies in this very general grouping (not just those
I've mentioned here) are undervalued (so are their component suppliers) on at
least one or more criteria - bv. cf, pe, psr.- and could be buys. That Romick's
Co. (and you) have selected Coachman from among this group, is a very favorable
signal for other investors interested in this category, IMO. Paul

Re Beazer, 1 of the main reason I prefer it amoung the homebuilders is the
convertible preferred. Pays 8% while I wait for the stock to go up, if it
doesn't go up while 8% is OK, its also a lot safer than the common as far as
security and the dividend will tend to keep the price up if the common does
drop. On top of that it looks to me that I will be able to start some very
attractive hedging if the common will move up into the 17 1/2 range from 16+.

Hi Paul Senior :

I checked out the company that you mentioned -- Sigma Aldrich. According to the
1995 edition of Staton's book, the company has been an Earnings Achiever AND a
Dividend Achiever for more than 20 years.

If the company hit an earnings glitch but still increased its dividend, it
would continue to remain in the list of AFCs (America's Finest Companies). The
fact that there was a dividend increase in spite of an earnings increase can be
interpreted as a signal and reassurance from the company that it is just a
one-year setback. However, if in the following year, it cut its dividend, then
(and only then) you should sell the stock.

Of course, this means that your taxable portfolio has to have companies that
pay dividends! So are we back to Square One? Probably not. If you have a
cut-off like say, the yield of the taxable portfolio should not be more than
half the market yield, you can still keep your taxable dividends down. In this
case, you are making a trade-off between portfolio turnover and paying taxes on
dividends.

Paul Senior :

I think you are right. This is not about value. One of the reviews for the book
says, "Staton buys value and beats the market". I think that is incorrect.
"Quality" is a more correct description here than "value".

Anyway, Staton says (and I think he's right about this) that this approach (of
owning a portfolio of 8 to 10 of America's Finest Companies, buying regularly
and adding to the portfolio, and selling only occasionally) makes you emulate
Buffett's style of investing.

Buffett is certainly not a "value" investor. He is one of those rarities -- a
long-term growth investor, and the only other person who comes anywhere close
to him is Peter Lynch.

Thanks, Scott Mc. Home Depot is a welcome addition to the list of AFCs. I think
Wal-Mart joined the list about 12 years ago, and an investment of about $6,000
at that time would have grown to nearly $48,000 as of today. What's more, the
yield on cost would be a cool 6%, i.e. twice the rate of inflation.

I won't be surprised if Home Depot notches a similar record over the next 10
years. There are very very few companies from the list of AFCs that have
disappointed the people who invested in them.

Thanks for the information and Good Luck with Eagle Hardware. Maybe we will be

And also, maybe they did do some window-dressing to show higher earnings for
1994 as a whole, compared to 1993. But they also did increase their dividend
handsomely (increased by 12%). That would mean the payout ratio increased

position - my own baggage is that I certainly thought so at the time, but
didn't act :>( By your method, you would have possibly averaged down (if you
already were in SIAL)thus reaping the benefits a year later. What I continue to
wrestle with (in my own investment style) is what to do when such a stock rises
- in SIAL's case - in Jan 1996 @25. A value investor should reevaluate the fair
value point - for me I'd probably would have called it fair valued @ 25, taken
my profit and gone on. (But not necessarily.) Your methodology would call for a
hold. You would not have my issue of having to make a sell/hold decision
because the price has risen. And I can see - in my own portfolio, in reading
about Sarofim, etc. - that that (just hold 'em) has been a winning thing to do
for many growth stocks that dive and come back and which then continue go on to
even greater hights. Paul Senior

Somebody asked as to how this can be called "value investing". Well, as I was
reading through the book again, I realized exactly how! Staton says that we
should keep the portfolio reasonably balanced. However, he does *not* recommend
selling any stock for that purpose. Instead, he suggests adjusting *new buying*
to achieve balance.

As an example, let's say we invested $1000 each in five companies C1, C2, C3,
C4 and C5 at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year we find that C1
and C2 appreciated by 15% each, C3 by 20%. C4 by 10% but C5 *lost* 20%.

Let's say all the companies qualified to be on the portfolio for the following
year too. The total value of the portfolio at the end of the first year is
$5400. If we are now adding say, another $5000 to the portfolio, then the total
would be $10,400 and each company should be about $2100. So we should put $1300
in C5 and distribute the remaining amount over the other four companies. That
is, 26% of the new money is put in C5, instead of the usual 20%. This means we
*are* using some kind of value criteria when we follow this strategy.

Paul and all,

Thanks for the well wishes! I never imagined how stressful
getting married can be :)!

My expanded viewpoint for Coachmen is now at

http://www.sealpoint.com/pow.html

I appreciate the thoughtful responses to this idea, and I certainly
agree that several in this group deserve a look. I've
been looking in the group for several months now and feel
Coachmen is only one of several good ways to go.

Good Investing !

Chris,

Rather than explain the concepts of value investing and
stock investing in general here, may I suggest you find
a decent book on the subject? Most of us have read quite
a few. I have some book reviews at www.sealpoint.com, but
those are my opinion only. My bias is value investing,
and I highly recommend Janet Lowe's Value Investing Made
Easy as a primer. I'd follow that book with Why
Stocks Go Up (and Down) by William Pike. Other books have been discussed here
i.e. Superstocks by Ken Fisher, etc. You can
get any of these -- even obscure ones --from www.amazon.com
very easily and cheaply. When you think you've got it all
figured out, try Sense and Nonsense in Corporate Finance.

Good luck!

Chris, I agree that a feel for a company is important...A sense of where they
are going and what they are trying to do as well as a gut feeling that they
mean what they say...Most of my positive experiences are with good strong
driven management who have a common goal with me (growing a company)...I don't
have the pull to sit down with management, however I can get a feel for a
company from their last 2 or 3 annual reports, calls to a company etc etc. I
really like to follow Annuals and Quarterly reports and see if 1. Management
make commitments2. They remember them 3. They achieve them.

Yesterday, I attended Marlton Technologies (AMEX:MTY) annual
stockholders meeting and spent about two hours talking with the
Company's management. I came away with an even stronger positive
feeling about MTY as an investment.

With 38% revenue growth and 55% operating profit growth in the first
quarter of 1997, on top of record revenue and earnings growth in 1996,
Marlton Technologies (AMEX:MTY) is rapidly growing yet its
stock is extremely undervalued by the market. While the Business
Services segment currently has a PE multiple of 31, MTY is at a PE of
14 although its profits are growing three times as rapidly as the segment.

I've written up my notes from the Meeting and have placed them on the
Napeague Web Site. In addition, an in-depth Analysis of Marlton

I'm a fan of value investing "with a reason". IOW, is anything
happening that will spark the shares? My recent suggestion,
Coachmen, is backed by new management and a large share buyback
announcement as well as the idea that they will benefit from
the baby boomers spending patterns over the next 10-15 years.

Steve Romick has pointed out similar logic, and now another
fund manager has pointed out the same thing about Coachmen:
http://www.businessweek.com/1997/25/b3532134.htm

He also suggests other plays in this field, as Paul Senior
suggested may be the case. If we on the value thread are recognizing
patterns and stocks before and/or with professional value
investors, this is a good thing.

My next question would be what's the date on that

pop up an awful lot when using value-type parameters.
I've also noticed that most don't pan out on
closer inspection thanks to a monstrous burn rate
that makes cash numbers obsolete within months.

Yahoo..was sceernig on another for ones that had got hit hard
looking for some likely dead cat bounce stuff and it was one of
several that came up, and I saw the cash balance..and said hey not
a lot of down side risk, and jumped in as I did not expect it to
stay down in the 2-1/8 range long..but it may..all of what you
say is correct about the burn rate..and stuff..but seldom do
you find one with that much cash to burn..have since talked, on
SI with a former owner and he didn't say anthing nice..after all
nobody ever bought that stock for under 5..and most paid 10..so
I doubt the condition is going to make any happy campers, seems
they are burned out on her..still any good news at all will attract
some new buyers. What I'm wondering is who is buying now..she had
a 400,000 volume Friday and thats a lot for a little bio co like
this.
--------------
I don't look at any bio as a traditional value play..or this one
for like a long term value play..if she don't pop in a month or
two with something I'l get out before she can burn up all the
money..with that kind of drop and the cash on hand
someone is going to something..all the ramifacations I see
are to much to write down..also the gist of it is I think she is
a go..but I don't look for a big run up..and doubt she will last
with the old plan she had. Management in falls like this could well
get run off , Broad of directors could sell whats left..bound to
be a few people who have some clout, and owned enough to raise
hell..maybe a tender offer I don't know !
This just don't happen that often, a stock going from 15 to 2,
but with assests worth twice that..I bought the assests, so I guess
you can call it an assest play more than a value play.
-----------------
Thing I hope people do when I alert them to what I think is a good
play is to look up some data on their own, maybe they find stuff I
don't..and kick it back..lot I don't know about this co. I'v never seen one go
cheap for long selling under her assest value, every one went up while I was
messing around to deside and looking for reasons not to buy it..every one ..
-------------------
So I'm in it, if I find out it's no good I'l get out..cost me $12
to trade..my commisions are cheap..don't see much down side risk,
But I'm still looking at her, this is one of thoes rare cases were
I buy fast then look..that may sound dumb..but I didn't just start trading..and
I don't do it often..but the chance she will pop up
fast to 3 or more are a lot lot stronger than her falling to 1 any
time soon.

re GEGP: seems like all of these freight forwarder type companies have recently
had price drops with their stocks. I like Fritz (FRTZ). FRTZ is selling at a
similar p/bv of about 1.4-1.5 to GEGP. Its PSR is about .35 vs. .19 for GEGP
(numbers not exact). I like FRTZ better because it is maybe 10+X bigger than
GEGP. From what I can tell, GEGP is the freight forwarder of choice for Compaq
- and is very substantial businesss for GEGP. FRTZ too is the preferred
provider for several companies. Somewhat hypocritically (and without much
factual basis) I look upon GEGP as a one-trick pony (CPQ) while applauding the
tight relationship FRTZ has with its customers. And it appears (and again
opinion only - no hard info) that once tied in with a customer it's hard to
dislodge a freight forwarder and also easier for the forwarder to get
additional business (if you have the resources - and I believe FRTZ does). So
it may indeed be possible that GEGP can grow and its stock recover (too) IMO.
One other point, San Francisco business columinst (FRTZ is hq'd in SF) wrote
several months back that Michael Price had taken a 4+% interest in FRTZ. I like
that -- if it's true. Paul Senior

AIMM, SEPR, and neurogen were all discussed in Barron's in 1994 or earlier by
an analyst. The business model of these companies is quite different from
traditional biotechs, namely,
(1) they have a major buisness partner funding product development and
marketing, (focusing on specific drugs and markets)
(2) the drugs they were developing were part of certain existing FDA approved
drugs (e.g. SEPR separating out effective isomers from poor quality mixtures of
certain existing drugs on the market), or natural resource (AIMM extracting
compounds from natural sources implying fewer side effects and faster FDA
approval) etc.
If the stuck to business models like these, their cash burn rate is not the

Your cash figure is from the Dec 96 quarter. 5-6 months
later, it is restructuring, cutting 60% of its workforce,
and has no revenues or guarantee of revenue in the
future. With only a 35M market cap and still half-owned
by institutions, the downside in percentage terms may
be great. I don't get a margin of safety from cash levels
in any biotech, and definitely not from half-year old
cash levels. This pick looks risky -- even if the cash
levels were as of late March. Not a superstock, not a
dividend achiever, not an asset play, not a traditional
value pick IMO.

Fila Stock Tumbles
After Company
Projects Results

----

By Janet Morrissey
AP-Dow Jones News Service

NEW YORK -- Fila Holding SpA stock fell 12% on news the company will fall short
of analysts'expectations when it releases its second-quarter results next
month.

On Friday, the Biella, Italy, maker of athletic shoes and apparel said it
expects its second-quarter revenue and earnings to miss analysts' estimates
because of "a weak U.S. footwear and apparel market," order cancellations and
problems associated with the company's warehouse software system. It said
investments designed to strengthen its product range also will cut into the
bottom line.

Fila projects second-quarter earnings of 53 cents to 60 cents a share. Six
analysts surveyed by First Call Inc. had projected the company would earn 83
cents a share. Four of the six have now revised that figure to 56 cents.

First Call said analysts also revised their estimates for Fila's 1997 and 1998
results. Four of six analysts lowered their per-share projections to $3.53 from
$4 for 1997, and to $3.80 from $4.52 for 1998.

In the 1996 second quarter, Fila Holding earned $25.9 million, or 98 cents a
share, on revenue of $322 million.

Fila Holding's American depository shares yesterday fell $4.50 to $32.875 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading on volume of nearly 1.4 million
shares. Average daily volume is 242,506.

One analyst, Michael Conn from Gruntal & Co., concurred. "Clearly the demand
continues to be quite sluggish in the U.S., and its reverberations on earnings
is starting to show," he said. "The look of the products and the type of
marketing have not evolved" to the point where consumers are jumping on the
Fila bandwagon, Mr. Conn said.

Fila is also under pressure from designers that have elbowed their way into the
athletic footwear and apparel market, such as Tommy Hilfiger Corp., Donna Karan
International Inc. -- and, more recently,
Polo Ralph Lauren Corp.

"The product just isn't there and it isn't selling in the U.S.," said one
analyst who has been bearish on the maker of athletic clothes and footwear
since he began covering the stock last December.

AIMM got stomped because the expectations got too high. At present
this company is pure speculation and should not be considered as
a value investment. It doesn't even have a product. To prove my point I will
excerpt a paragraph from their latest 10Q:

"Since its inception through March 31, 1997, the Company has incurred ongoing
losses from operations and has cumulative losses as of March 31, 1997 totaling
$77,716,000. To date, the Company has not recorded any revenues from the sale
of products. Revenues recorded through March 31, 1997 were earned in connection
with contract research and the granting of certain short-term rights. The
Company expects to remain in the development stage for the foreseeable future
and accordingly, expects to continue to incur substantial losses."

The rest of the 10Q can be read at:

http://www.edgar-online.com/brand/yahoo/gdoc/?choice=2-682558

This kind of a stock is the furthest away one can get from the
spirit of value investing. The game with companies like this
is to gamble that they will develop a profitible product before
they run out of money. I don't really want to evaluate
this company like a Venture Capitalist Speculator. As a vaule
investor this is best tossed aside in our search for undiscovered
value.

An "asset play" is where a company has some asset that is worth
considerably more than what is listed on the books. Usually
this would be Real Estate. In the example of AIMM, you have
as assets: cash, a few PhD's, and some great ideas. Since
the smart people and the great ideas are harder to value, we
write them off and we're left with the cash. Just the money
and no products. The company is currently priced slightly
below the book value that will soon be burned up anyways.
Hardly an asset play. I've got better places to burn my
cash :)

Oliver; your right about her being speculation; I picked her up
speculating on the cash she has on hand, which is enough to buy
back all of her outstanding shares and still have money to burn,
so I speculate someone will tender some sort of offer in the near
future, I could be wrong. She does not fit the value investing
style at all, and I'm not hyping her, my speculation is a very
modest one. <G>
I'v really been more in bonds than stocks , and still am, as I
don't fancy myself as much of a stock picker..I have tried a
few mutual funds..and made a little..but have since pulled back
out of them..as the market looks high , now even though I picked
mutual finds that were clasified by morning as vaule type funds,
when I got their top holdings and looked at them why they sure
looked high priced to me..so I came out..and have a few dollars
just sitting in the Money Market now wondering what to do, bonds
went up and interest down but I may just go back to bonds.
I did pick up some HGGR yesterday, if you have time look at it,
from what I could see it has real good book value. I might exit
it if you see it as risky..as for Aimm..if no one makes a bid on her
before long I will exit..I don't see her as real risky in the short
term, because of her cheap price..and cash on hand..and I don't
intend to speculate on her for long.

to make up for my loss with ATEL. Wish I'd kept hecha a little
longer..I'm also speculating on ggit but not a lot, at least she is
got a little more book value than I paid for her.
My only really good buy in a year has been AMD..last July I bought
her below book value, but she is another one I sold to soon.

Rather than going to the BRLI thread, I went to the marketguide
snapshot and then to the April 30th 10Q. What I saw can hardly
be considered a "money machine." It is trading at about 1/2
of book value but the LTD to Equity is over 100%. The reason
their debt is so high is because they can't seem to collect the
money for the services they render. The accounts receivable
make up 44% of the Total Assets! They post revenues when
services are rendered and their allowances for bad debt
is over 50% of all services rendered. This is a severe
cash flow problem. The company is currently making money
but it is in danger of bleeding to death or being crushed under
a mountain of debt.

Brli is an undervalued sleeper, regardless of what you think.

Another stock I stumbled on today: Memtec Group (Nasdaq MMTCY). I wanted to ask
folks in the Value Investing thread what they thought of it.

Yahoo's info:

Earnings/share = 11.58
P/E = 2.15
Recommendations= 4 analysts follow it, all with Strong Buy's

Memtec is an international company involved in fluid and filtration products
and systems, and is based in Sydney, Australia with manufacturing plants in US
and elsewhere. There's a website at

Does anyone follow this company?

Lonnie, James: re FLH. Thanks for info regarding Fila. I still can't find the
numbers I want to see & and the info. you guys posted suggests there's a big
risk - bigger than I am comfortable with without having a margin of safety. I
tend to see the industry as cyclical among the participants based on teen
preferences. NIKE and RBK fought it out in the '80's - when one stock up, the
other down -- the down one being the one to play (or so I've read). Missed RBK
at 25 in '95, missed NIKE all over the place, missed Converse, missed Stride
Rite in '96 @8+, K-swiss I never liked, LA-gear never cared for.... -g- well I
am consistent in failing to pick these up at the cyclical bottoms. NIKE is just
sooo dominant now.... and it too has its risks as we mentioned on earlier
posts. I still hold JCP (Penney) a dividend play discussed here in much earlier
posts --- the largest seller of NIKE products. regards, Paul

Brian: re MMTCY: Financial info. on foreign co's - bv. eps psr - seems to be a
problem with these internet providers - especially when I try to do a screen
and I get psr of .02 ,p/bv of .1. Man, super unbelievable numbers. It's got
something to do with foreign currency and lack of translation. In MMTCY's case,
they post in US$ because, as they say, most of their bus. is in the US. Still
if one looks at at Zack's (the four strong buy analysts I guess), the eps is
more like $1+, NOT $11+. This ($1 range) is consistent with their 10q which I
checked also. May be a good value or undervalued at current price - but not
because of pe=2+ : the pe is much greater than 2+. (And of course, :>) it's
certainly not a value because four unknown suits agree that it's a strong buy)

From:Oliver Hellwig

James:

I understand your desire to try and buy companies below book
value because I tried to do the same thing about a year ago, but
I have since found that there are things much more important
than book value. Buffett points out that book value can evaporate
very quickly. He gives an example of the textile equipment that
berkshire sold for pennies on the dollar, and this was fairly
new equipment at the time he liquidated. Peter Lynch also
warns of the dangers of relying only on book value because
during liquidations, the equipment and other products is usually
sold for pennies on the dollar. If you buy a poor company
because of the low price to book ratio, you have very little
downside protection. As an example of this, last September I
bought 2000 shares of BEST at $0.19 a share. Their last annual
report showed a book value of over $7.00. When they liquidated,
there was *nothing* left for the shareholders. So much for
book value. I didn't lose very much money but it taught me
an important lesson.

If you really want to do short term trading I would recommend
a different strategy than relying only on book value. This
strategy involves buying solid companies that have just been
downgraded by the analysts because they didn't meet earnings
expectations. The downgrade usually causes many institutional
investors to dump the stock causing a sharp dip in prices.
If you picked a solid company as defined by other value parameters
such as ROE, low debt, and good margins, the dip will usually
be temporary. A good place to find these kind of stocks is
when they hit the most active screens at www.nasdaq.com. If
there is a similar place for NYSE stocks I would appreciate
if someone would show me where they are. The spotlight section
of SI is also a good place to look for tech stocks.

Before I give an example of how I apply this technique. I just
want to make a quick defense of the buy-and-hold-the-good-stocks-
for-the-long-term strategy. Graham, in The Intelligent Investor,
warns us against trying to trade in the short term. The biggest
problem is that it puts the value investor in the wrong mindset,
and an investor's biggest asset this that they have the proper
perspective on what "Mr. Market" is currently saying. When a
value investor succums to the irrational nature of the short
term market, then he gives up his biggest advantage, which is that
of having a rational basis for valuing a stock. Short term
stock trading is the best way to be lured into this irrational
mode of thinking. Furthermore, Graham, warns that if an investor feels the need
to trade for the short term, that they should use
a separate account from the account that they use for their
long term trading. I like Buffet's technique of having a group
of stocks they he plans to keep forever, and another group of
stocks that he buys because he thinks that they are are great
deal. These stocks are usually sold when they become fully
valued.

Another writer that I would recommend, if you really want to do
short term trading, would be Peter Lynch. This is kind of a
tounge-in-cheek suggestion because Mr. Lynch also warns his
readers against selling their stocks too soon. Mr. Lynch
offers great suggestions for finding value and growth stocks.

Since, I also have this urge to do some short term trading
I'll now give you an example of how I do it. Keep in mind that
I only do short term trading in my IRA so that I don't have
a taxable event for every trade, and that I do absolutely
no short term trading in my non-IRA account. Also, in my IRA
account, I have a few stocks that I plan to keep for a long
time. Last Friday I was watching the big movers on Nasdaq
and I noticed two stocks, IDXX & ESST, that had some big drops
because of earnings disappointments. I did some fast research
on these stocks and noticed that they had little or no debt,
good margins, and a good ROE. In less than 10 minutes after first
noticing the big drop I took positions in each of the companies.
Today I closed out both of those positions at a little over
5% profit. Not bad for less than a weeks holding. I closed
out the positions because ADBE had an earnings disappointment
today and I wanted to buy into their 10% drop.

In summary, I would rather be a long term holder of
stocks but because I also have a desire to do some short term
trading. To do my short term trading, I have allocated a
portion of my IRA for the purpose of short term trading.
If I make a mistake, I can afford to hold on to the stock
for longer periods of time than a regular short term trader.

Profitible Investing,

Oliver

You are better read than me, I need to do some more home work,

<G> (very big grin) I too jumped on ADBE this morning..now I'v
played her before..more on a TA basis..and I'm ahead on her so
far. If by some chance they push her down ( large short interest )
some more..I'm not going to vacate..at about 33 I will then buy
into Jan98 calls as they will be cheap. Thing is with ADBE when
she does come back , there are so many shorts that have to rush
in and cover she goes most stright up 6 to 8 pts. She is not one
you can wait long after she starts back up she goes.
I hope today is her bottom for now, but I won't get faked out if
she goes lower.

Well now. RACC. This one requires a second look IMO.

My first take is: Their business is primarily loaning money for cars to high
risk people. They have recently, and continue now too, to take a drubbing.
Stock is near its lows 3-4 down from 32. Apparently lotsa high risk people gave
'em the high sign and now they've had to adjust their loss reserves (way up of
course, so earnings way down). But the numbers still look good - bv at $9+
(until further losses show up?) psr .5 (until they stop writing bad business)
and div. at 9% (oh, it'll be cut, I bet you that). New CEO brought in with
apparently good background in this business (loaning money to people who
shouldn't borrow money to buy things they shouldn't buy) The co is
geographically dispersed and own a couple of banks. Their ROE is (or maybe was)
between 10-13%.
Question(s): how much of the bad news is already reflected in the stock price
(and is all the bad news out)? "Credit-impaired" people are out there and they
still want to borrow, and many people are still paying off promptly. Can or
will this company capture and maintain this business - and could it be
profitable at a lower sales and margin level; and at a stock price of just $4
are we talking good value and a reasonable bet that the company can come back
somewhat? I've sent for annual report. Paul

Paul,

There was a talk somewhere here about AAM and CTYS
- yet another two cousins of RACC. They are all in
similar business - lending money to high-risk people -
with larger or smaller guarantees - e.g. AAM can foreclose
the house really fast and sell it to get back its
money. AAM and CTYS are selling at higher prices, probably
because of their profit margins, and smaller risk.

I still don't understand their future, the competitive
position and the level of risk. The positive spin is that
they all dropped on Mercury Finance news. The negative spin
is that consumer bankruptcies are rising.

I want to know more if you figure something out.
Though personally I don't like business with high risk,
commodity type of product and low barrier of entry.

Good luck

http://biz.yahoo.com/finance/97/05/12/racc_1.html

Text follows:
Reliance Acceptance Group Inc debt rating cut

CHICAGO, May 12 (Reuter) - Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co said Monday it cut
the rating on Reliance Acceptance Group Inc's subordinated debt to
single-B-minus from double-B, affecting about $25 million in debt.

Reliance's Reliance Acceptance Corp unit's $100,000 in commercial paper remains
rated at D-four, Duff & Phelps said.

The downgrade reflects continued rapid deterioration in asset quality, due in
part to many exceptions to underwriting policy, inadequate internal contols,
deficient systems to monitor asset quality and lack of management depth, Duff &
Phelps said.

OH-- I am sorry if my reply seemed, well, a bit short.
As to brli, just give them a call and talk to the ceo to get a feel for what
they are planning. They are/have been in a buy-up competitor mode. As to the
bank debt, their bankers, whom are much closer to the co. than anyone else,
continue to increase the credit line.
The possible gains from the SKB lawsuit may be huge.
And, the barrier to entry in their business is overwhelming.
One thing I have learned over the years with micro-caps, is that they usually
retrace old highs, and that is what I expect from brli.
Also-- forget about the market guide numbers-- that is information
that everyone has.
To really make serious money on a stock, you have
to work and sweat a bit to find what everyone else does not know.

Actually, I do use those screens. Egad, your minimum
ROE is 25%? I usually use 20. I usuallly don't like
the margins over 15% or less than 5% and typically
screen for such. I haven't used my screening program
in a while because a) everyone's doing it these days
and b) my data was too often in error.

Gentlemen - Thank you for the RACC responses - If RACC does not
hold the value you desire you might find it in other companies
within the sector. Where once investors found stability with these
companies they have lost their confidence because of fraudulent
management. Along with RACC I am researching several others
that seem to have been brought down with MFN; - EMER - MONFA - NALF
- NAK - SFC - TFCE - CPSS - CTYS - ASFN - ASFI - and AAC.
Any and all comments are certainly welcome.

Price/Book and ROE
The price to book value ratio and the return on book equity should have a close
mathematical relationship. When one is high, the other one should be as well. I
like low price/book stocks, but be VERY careful screening for low price/book
and high ROE. What that screen kicks out are going to be a few gems and a lot
of "falling knives", in which today's high ROE is collapsing. Remember, high
ROE is only sustainable if there are strong barriers to entry or an
insurmountable competitive advantage. These are few and far between.

As tempting as it is to buy high ROE stocks, I would argue that you should
screen for the opposite. Stocks with lower ROE than they have historically
attained may be at the bottom of a cycle, or susceptible to a meaningful change
in management. You're going to find a lot of dogs in this category, but you'll
probably find more "fallen angels" than "falling knives".

My main point is this. If you are going to buy high ROE stocks, your research
has to focus on the sustainability of that high ROE.
