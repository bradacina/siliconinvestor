Hi Jurgis -
Still tracking SYEV no position at this time.

My order was placed 3/5 and has yet to be delivered. Their headquarters are
only aprox 150 miles from my home.

I am interested to see how it comes packaged and what other types of cross
promotion advertising material they include. Nice to see it's a family

They may need some of their water purification bottles in Japan after that
devastating 8.9 magnitude earthquake last night. Hope the damage is minimal.

Hi Paul -
Some more views on GFS as well as the small E&P stocks. The recent sell off may
present a "selective value" buying opportunity.

Re: GasFrac Energy Services, Inc. (GFS.V)
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27227865
From the article:"...GASFRAC – GFS-TSX original write up Aug 25 2010

Again, this is my favorite company in the portfolio. And they delivered Q4 and
annual numbers better than I expected. The $41 million revenue in Q4 was $10
million more than I was expecting (no wonder the stock rocked last week) and at
first glance, everything seems great – margins are fairly constant which is
great as usually growth costs money. Yes you should get economies of scale and
greater profits, but first – growth costs money. The number of jobs is up and
the price per job is up, (due to bigger equipment being used, which is what the
IPO was for – they should see a similar bump in Q4 11 from the bigger equipment
they’re buying that was paid for from the November 2010 financing).

Other interesting points
1. The company has $119 million in working capital and 60.6 million shares out
– almost $2/share.
2. Three customers account for 63% of revenue, but over 40 customers overall.
3. They now have 2 rigs working in Texas after bringing rigs back into Canada
from the US in 2010
4. The LPG Fracturing Process patents for the U.S., Canada and International
markets remain in examination.
5. Q1 2011 will be lower due to the 19 day self imposed work stoppage due to
the first accident

Overall I would expect the market to see this as positive. I will be listening
to the conference call tomorrow and reading the analyst reports on Monday to
get a better sense of how the market is viewing this release...."

Back-up diesel generators didn't work, so battery power became necessary to
keep coolant water flowing. If the battery power is depleted and electric power
is not otherwise restored, a loss-of-coolant accident or meltdown would ensue.

"The emergency shutdown has been conducted but the process of cooling down the
reaction is currently not going as planned," explained Japan's Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yukio Edano, according to CNN.

Thus, Japan declared a state of "atomic power emergency" and people living

I am stuck on how to come up with a company's intrinsic value.

The formula from the 'Intelligent Investor' seems to be too simplistic.

I read Seth Klarman's 'Margin of Safety', and he suggested that NPV calculation
was one of the best ways in trying to come up with a value for the business.
However, since NPV requires a lot of data, I am struggling to tick all the
right boxes.

Is there a simpler way of trying to come up with intrinsic value? Or should I
just stop complaining and get on with the NPV calculations?

I just feel that since I am clueless about how to come up with a decent
intrinsic value for any given company, it is difficult to plan entry/exit

Hi Faizui -

How are you defining "Intrinsic Value"?

Different definitions from a Google search:

1) "The actual value of a security, as opposed to its market price or book
value. The intrinsic value includes other variables such as brand name,
trademarks, and copyrights that are often dificult to calculate and sometimes
not accurately reflected in the market price. One way to look at it is that the
market capitalization is the price (i.e. what investors are willing to pay for
the company) and intrinsic value is the value (i.e. what the company is really
worth). Different investors use different techniques to calculate intrinsic
value."

OR

2) "An alternative, though related approach, is to view intrinsic value as the
value of a business' ongoing operations, as opposed to its accounting based
book value, or break-up value. Warren Buffett is known for his ability to
calculate the intrinsic value of a business, and then buy that business when
its price is at a discount to its intrinsic value."

Below is a fun Web Site called Buffet's Valuation Formula. Buffet always trys
to keep things very simple.

http://www.moneychimp.com/articles/valuation/buffett_calc.htm

Buffett's Value Formula (?)

Warren Buffett hasn't exactly published his formula for what he calls the
intrinsic value of a company, but he has dropped a number of hints. He
apparently multiplies estimated future earnings by a confidence margin between
zero and a hundred percent (a bird in the bush being worth 0.5 birds in the
hand, and all that; bush birds are the earnings you hope for, and hand birds
are the earnings you're confident will materialize). He then compares these
probable earnings with something he has total confidence in, by using a U.S.
treasury yield as his discount rate. In calculator form it looks like this:

It will be interesting to see what general definitions are used among our Value
Investing group to arrive at a "fair" value price.

I tend to use a variation of the PE ratio based on my best guess for forward
earnings and compare the result to the Industry sector/sub-sector PE. I
generally will consider an investment fairly (or Over) valued when the Industry
PE = or (<) to my estimated PE.

Excellent trading on SSN this past week. You will notice that options are now

long term especially their 3.8% royalty give back from Chesapeake Energy

SSN has 1,654.96 million shares

On the front page:

http://www.google.com/finance?q=AMEX:SSN

it says 72.02M shares.

According to the presentation
SSN have 255.3 M market cap, share price 2.63
255.3/2.63 = 97.07M shares

If this is true:
"$8.20/share (36.1 million bbls net to SSN)."

then 97.07M shares X 8.2 = $800.556M / 36.1 = $22.17 per bbls

This means that they base their valuation on 22.17$ per bbls???
Very nice but is it true?

Re: SSN Presentation

I did not cross check their calculations back to market cap and shares
(ordinary) outstanding but in their summary page of my link of their
presentation (
http://www.samsonoilandgas.com.au/IRM/Company/ShowPage.aspx?CPID=1236&EID=63832
78&PageName=Corporate%20Presentation%20at%20Enercom%20Conference ), they show
how they arrive at their market cap as of Feb 22, 2011 of $269.2 million. That
is based on 99.8 million ADS shares. <u>Each ADS represent 20 Ordinary
shares</u>. So I believe your Google number represent the outstanding number of
"ordinary" shares.

NOTE: The Yahoo outstanding shares are stated as 72.02 Million (
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=SSN+Key+Statistics ) which reflects the ADS
share count.

The important thing is the Valuation Metrics on page-21- states that their
Niobrara Hawk Springs assets could contain (according to SSN) 36.1 mmstb which
they value at NPV US$18.9 per bbl. That's equal to US$682 million or US$8.20
per (ADS) share.

They state in their footnotes notes that the $18.9 per bbl represents the
current forward price for Oil which may not prove to be accurate.

Remember these are all estimates but as wells get drilled and they are able to
record the actual oil recovery rates from each new production well, they can
refine their 36.1 mmstb reserve number. On page-20- of their presentation
estimates for this property range from 10 mmstb to 109 mmstb (that production
range translates to $2.00/share to $24.00/share)

That's a lot of potential upside for this stock.

"Buffett's value formula" is just a bit modified DCF. They added the
"confidence margin" factor to DCF and called discount rate "best available
return that you have 100% confidence in". Does this make it better than regular
DCF? Not clear. On the positive side, it's easier to pick the discount rate -
it is pretty much 5-10 year treasury rate. On the negative side, you have to
pick the confidence margin pretty precisely. Also, when treasury rate is very
low the valuation gets very distorted IMHO. Never trust anyone who tells to buy
stocks at 50 PE just because treasury rate is 3%. ;) The rest: growth rate /
years of growth are the same parameters as in DCF. You still have to estimate
them, which is tough.

Regarding "intrinsic value", I don't calculate it. I look more at expected
return to see whether the investment is cheap or not. Obviously expected return
depends on the future earnings (CF), so it could be possible to calculate the
intrinsic value from these earnings. I just don't do it.

I also don't think there is a precise "intrinsic value" for a business. Having
a ballpark value should be enough to make a decision. :)

I find that I agree w/Jurgis Bekepuris regarding intrinsic value.

I never calculate it. Not sure I even could with any confidence. Looking
through my copy of "Intelligent Investor", I don't see any mention of
"intrinsic" in the index.

If I can determine fair/full value or have some good idea and reassurance that
a stock is undervalued, that has worked well-enough for me.

Some businesses are valued by the investment community using specific metrics.
You may (or may not) go along with those metrics to determine if a stock in
that business is undervalued. On this thread, recently, small e&p companies
have been discussed with a "commonly-accepted" (my opinion) or "sometimes
accepted" way to measure them, e.g. 2pnav or flowing barrels. My point is that
if you know the particular business or industry, there may be generally-used
metrics within that sector that clue you into whether a company might be
undervalued or not.

In general, for me for most businesses I use a type of low p/e, high roe
metric. I find it simple, easy, effective. Sometimes I'll use low p/e (a low
absolute number), low historical p/e (company compared to itself), low p/sales,
or price below nav. Once in a while I will break down and use low relative p/e,
by which I mean low p/e of company compared to its peers. (I find low relative
p/e investing to be very very dangerous though.)

On this thread, imo, it's generally not a concern that some methodology is too
simplistic. Simplistic usually isn't the issue. Imo, in value investing it's
not so much about being clever or sophisticated in evaluating a stock. It's
often more about having the patience to sit on a stock once it's bought. And of
course, having the courage/confidence to buy something that's a value stock --
unloved, down in price and maybe dropping further after being bought.

Maybe Paul Senior can help out here.

I believe the NPV US$18.9 per bbl reflects their "best" estimate for what they
believe they can net (in current dollars) per barrel for their Niobrara Hawk
Springs assets AFTER all drilling and well development costs are factored in.
All their capital costs, cost of borrowed money, all royalty & taxes paid, an
estimate for the future price of oil are among just a few of the variables that
go into calculating the NPV$/bbl figure for a hypothetical reserve project.

Here is a more detailed document that shows how the industry calculates the NPV
$ per bbl estimate:
http://www.serafimltd.com/pdfs/WellNumbers.pdf

<u>Uses of the equations:</u>

These equations offer a number of advantages when used in addition to existing
methods:-
- quick and easy to use, especially for screening prospects and initial
concepts, in the early stages of a project
- easily auditable (in contrast to spreadsheets, which are often very difficult
to fathom)
- can provide a totally independent check on project economics
- can help save time in determining the correct well density
- can help to provide an over-view of the common task of almost all petroleum
engineers – optimising the economic return. The equations can also be extended
to give the optimal number of wells when the objective of the oil company is to
maximise the overall rate of return. In a trial, when applied to a Russian
field, the equations quickly yielded very similar results to one month of
conventional work.

An example Consider a field with the following technical and economical
parameters:-
Technically recoverable reserves = 100 million barrels
Net oil price = $8 per barrel
Discount rate = 8%
Net fixed capex costs = $20,000,000
Two development options are considered:-
a) Vertical wells
Net capex per well = $2,000,000
Net opex per well per year = $300,000
Average initial well rates = 500 barrels per day = 150,000 barrels per year
b) Horizontal wells
Net capex per well = $5,000,000
Net opex per well per year = $500,000
Average initial well rates = 1,500 barrels per day = 450,000 barrels per year
The formulas quickly give
a) Vertical wells
Optimal number of wells = 35
NPV with this number of wells = $122,000,000
(Time to abandonment = 26 years)
b) Horizontal wells
Optimal number of wells = 19
NPV with this number of wells = $209,000,000
(Time to abandonment = 23 years)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is their best guess on the value of the reserves in-the-ground. In an
onshore well case it reflects a 23 year well life, an estimate of the
production profile for the wells, average price of oil over the life of the
well, their cost of borrowed money etc.

That is why I think they qualify their estimate with the following footnote:

"...This valuation is based on a future production projection using the Silo
Field as an analogue. The future production performance of the Hawk Springs
wells may not meet this expectation. The NPV calculation has been made using
the current forward price for oil, and this projection may not prove to be
accurate..."

If 18.9 is what they can net, they must be subtracting their expenses from some
average price per barrel that they think they can get. What I am trying to
understand is what average price of oil are they using in their calculation. Is
it 100$ is it 80$...? I believe it is very important to know that.

It's not clear to me either on what they are basing their calculations.

I don't understand why they are using forward pricing. I see there's a forward
price curve they use for gas, and that they discount from that, because it's
about the gas prices they actually get.
http://www.ferc.gov/market-oversight/mkt-gas/trading/ngas-tr-fwd-pr.pdf

For oil, I sort of understand using SEC or NY strip pricing. Forward pricing I
haven't seen before in nav calculations for oil. I must have missed something
somewhere.

I can't be sure they're using after-tax numbers either. Some companies do
report such. Some do not. The Serafim calculations say or imply nav
calculations are after tax -- that is, not only after royalties, government tax
on production or land leases,etc., but also it's after the tax on the company's
profits (if there are profits). I don't understand how all that then results in
Serafin's example calculation though, because it seems like "Net oil price = $8
per barrel" is a number that's arbitrarily just plopped in the equation.

I'm just not able to come up with a nav for SSN that I like or understand. Nor
a flowing barrel analysis that's attractive. That's disconcerting given I am
holding a large position in the stock.
Not happy either with the apparently convoluted or confusing way SSN itself
reports nav. Makes me nervous when none of us apparently is able to understand
what their nav means, other than their implication that they are undervalued on
their calculation of nav.

I am thinking of adding to my already large position. I too have accumulated a
pretty large position relative to my other E&P basket holdings. Based on the

the valuation.

This is a good exercise as it goes to show that from a valuation perspective
this is not an exact science. If one can quantify the value of their assets
based on a conservative benchmark, SSN still may be a good value Buy.

I am going to try to do what you did for PXL.v (

Xk bopd for $M on their oily reserves. I am going to take another look at
Samson Oil & Gas Limited (SSN) valuation based on both their proved and
probable reserves. In other words do a complete bottoms up value analysis.

Some of my takeaways on SSN:

1) They receive a 3.8% royalty give back from Chesapeake Energy Corporation
(CHK) from their recent Niobrara land sale to them.

2) Proved Reserves 470.5 bbls July 2010 vs 288.0 bbls 2009
(from 9/30/2010 Annual Report)

Note from the Annual Report:The estimate has used the NYMEX forward curve as at
30 June 2010 less an appropriate differential to take into account the
difference between the NYMEX pricing and the price received by the Company at
its various sales points.

3) Their 2010 Capital Budget for well development was $11 million and will
expand to $36.7 million representing an additional two wells in their Niobrara
project. Note that in their recent Niobrara 23-Feb-2011 Corporate Presentation
at Enercom Conference, they estimated it would take the completion of 88 wells
to completely develop their 14,000 acres. Based on the most recent positive
results, they are going forward with two new wells in 2011. Who knows what they
are planning for 2012 and further out?

4) New developers and/or JV partners for Niobrara now include EOG Resources,
Inc, CNOOC Limited, Halliburton and Chesapeake Energy. These are all best of
breed developers, well financed and bring expertise to any JV partnership. To
complete the well development for the 14,000 acres (88 wells at $1.5
million/well) that SSN owns would require a capital infusion of around $132
million. This could be accomplished through debt financing, JV partner or an
equity offering.

Proved Reserves = 470.5 bbls of oil. Yes, that's exactly what I see for proved
and probable at company's 10k. I can only scratch my head. That's it, just
470.5 barrels -- which doesn't seem right at all (Where are the 000's?), but

I believe that the most difficult decision to make is when the stocks falls
after you bought it what do you do. sell, hold, buy more? many of the stocks
that i had the greatest gains on dropped by over 40-50% before moving up, but
its tough to have the courage of your convictions. a friend of mine was an ex
early investor in amgen. he said he held for 3 years and it did nothing, he
gave up on it and sold it it when up at least 40 fold in the next 5 years. it
works the other way too,
i held on to another silver stock buying more as the price declined. i had met
and been impressed with the ceo, but that didnt stop the company from going
bust when they couldnt produce enough silver to meet the hedging requirements
placed upon them by the bank financing agreements. the only clue that there was
a problem was the steady decline in the share price. win some lose some.

whether you count non-controlling interest. Market cap is about 338M (49M

OT - nuclear

IMHO, it is very sad that most of the world will have knee-jerk reaction to
nuclear problems in Japan and stop investing in nuclear energy or decommission
existing nuclear plants. Nuclear energy is IMHO almost the only viable solution
to deal with peak oil crisis, however, it requires long lead time and this is
being squandered again and again. The fear is just too high even though
percentage/fatality-wise it is totally irrational. But then we do not live on
Vulcan. :( I liked Turkish PM who said that they won't stop Russian nuclear
power plant construction since everything including gas pipelines have risk.
But he's probably the only one who will take such stand. China may also
continue (for all the good and bad:

I was totally opposed to Lithuanian nuclear power plant closure, not that it

are risks, but if you look at how many people have died in the wars for oil and
compare to number of people who died from power plant accidents, I think
nuclear energy would be a better choice. Just my opinion. I don't have the
numbers. My short experience in stocks taught me not to regret any missed

As always there will be unwarranted knee jerk stuff, and yes everything has

- The long term effects of a nuclear disaster are much worse than the
alternatives. When that gas pipe exploded in California, devastating a
neighborhood, everyone but the people whose houses were destroyed was able to
move back in a matter of days, not years.

- There are reasonable concerns about the ability of the industry to model for
disaster risk. If a Japanese company was unable to fully anticipate what was,
in retrospect, a fairly obvious earthquake scenario where a major earthquake is
followed by a tsunami, what scenarios are they missing in other places?

- One clear risk that needs to be reexamined is keeping the spent fuel next to
the reactor. It sounds like that was the major problem causing radiation leaks.

You are making the same errors as the knee jerkers.

The real question is:

- What is the total cost of accidents accounting for accident frequency per
energy produced vs other approaches?

Everything else is just sentimentality.

List of nuclear incidents is here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civilian_nuclear_accidents Calculate what
was the life loss and other costs.

Then: How many gas and oil pipelines, reprocessing plants exploded during the
same time period? It's up to you whether you want to include oil spills or not,
since oil is not really used for electricity production. What was the life loss
and the total costs? How much energy was produced by gas electric plants
compared to nuclear?

Or would you prefer to compare to coal electric plants? They are potentially
very safe not counting mining accidents and of course pollution.

If we can compare these numbers, that's the reasonable discussion. Everything

historically only gone up. Even assuming that the numbers would back you up,
that is history. The nuclear black swan is a big hairy beast that can literally
appear overnight and live on for millennia. The others, while certainly bearing
their own significant risks and costs, do not have the same fat tail risk.

I'm not against developing nuclear capacity but I lack confidence that we are
where we should be in terms of process.

I disagree. I believe that the risks are known and calculable. I furthermore
believe that the risks did not become worse because of the current situation in
Japan. It seems that you don't think so. I don't think we can reconcile these
two views, so I don't see a point in further discussion. :)

BTW, I agree that the safety can be improved in part by not building nuclear
reactors in the path of tsunami and not storing spent nuclear fuel on the
premises. But safety improvement only reduces the risks and not increases them.
;)
If we had to talk about increased risks, corruption and shoddy building in
China nuclear plants would be more appropriate topic, though shoddy building
affects a lot of industries and could lead to mass deaths in any number of
them.

Peace. :)

Faizul,

I have hard time comparing E&Ps head to head. There are just too many
differences: reserve size and composition, location of reserves (including
geological, geographical, onshore/offshore, political), quality of reserves,
future potential, capital needs, existing and future cash flows, etc. Some of
these are not even predictable since companies buy new fields, sell existing
fields/wells, etc.

I find EGY attractive and I am buying at these levels. POEFF is not cheap
enough for me. But that's just my very very subjective opinion based mostly on
financials. It's possible that I am completely wrong. If you like both, buy
both. ;) I am very much a diversification advocate with E&Ps, since IMHO
there's too much risk of a single company hitting an exploration/production
hole like COPJF did, for example.

Maybe someone else can comment here. Or you can ask on the Big Dog thread.

re Nuclear energy -first of at, the question for this board is not what is a
rational way to pursue (or not) nuclear energy. That decision will be made by
voters and politicians in various countries. The relevant question is what is
likely going to happen with nuclear energy and how can I profit from it (or at
least avoid losses). My thinking is that the buildout of nuclear energy is
going to stall in many countries and that this will have a severe effect for
the business involved.

The other thing is that operating older plants may be more dangerous than
assumed. Those plants that failed in Japanese coincidentally or not were older
plants. Now most of the operators like EXC and ETR or others really like to
operate those older, cheap and depreciated plants because they are so
profitable, but I would expect that this operating model will be severely
challenged and these plants will be decommissioned sooner now. So EXC and ETR
can say goodby sooner rather than later to these immensely profitable cash
cows.

Also, keep note that these nuclear power generation business fall into the
unregulated wholesale business, so there is no support from the taxpayer or
customer either (as would be the case if the plant is within the regulated
business).

yesterday i added pvr and aab.to, and yes more gfre. i just dont see how the

now that i finally heard what the problem was with the japan nuclear reactors,
it seems like very japan specific issue- namely the tusnami swept away the
diesel fuel tanks that were supposed to fuel the generator whcih would furnish
power to the cooling equipment. im not saying its impossible for a tsunami to
hit the united states coastal area, but its a highly unlikely event and could
be solved by storing the diesel tanks underground.

Re: Ultrapetrol (Bahamas) Ltd. (ULTR)

Increased position by 30%. Earnings released yesterday. Company seems set up to
take advantage of growth in their River business. Closed out their loosing
passenger business, sold remaining assets and booked loss. They have made some
large capital investments in both their offshore drill platform support vessels
(w/ long term service contracts w/ PBR) and new river barges to build system
capacity.

Will explore lightening up on shares in 31 days.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Closed out shares in Gerdau S.A. (GGB) for $13.32/share. Shares bought 3/2009
at $5.37/share. Moved proceeds into ULTR.

Company struggled to book higher profits due to very high commodity input
costs. This is a low cost producer and a good play on an expanding world
economy. Will continue to watch for a lower entry point (below $10.00/share) to
start a small tracking position.

Hi Paul -
Re: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

My Drug Company watch list was looking interesting today. Specifically MRK
under $30.00/share may present a good buying opportunity. I added JNJ to the
list based on your post. I pretty much stopped watching it since they have had
so many quality production issues. My last transaction was 12/2009 where I
closed out my position at $64.00/share.

Buffet still maintains his holdings in the company w/ the 4th largest
individual position.

IMHO "intrinsic value" is mostly WAG, but I come close to Value Cruncher on
JNJ, I'd say it would be fairly valued to slightly overvalued around $82.

I'm all for more use of nuclear energy in the US -- and natural gas. Especially
natural gas.

One thing is for certain: increased use of nuclear in the US just came to a
screeching halt -- although it wasn't moving very fast to begin with -- until
after the 2012 elections. No pols that I know of have the stones to come out
for it now.
