Barrons/Neff,

Paul -- there was a very interesting writeup of Mr. Neff (Vanguard fame) in
this week's Barrons. Mr. Neff has 10% of his personal stock holdings in Tyco &
a smaller percentage in CIT.

I've always respected the man. He is very humble, down-to-earth, and successful
in life/investing. (I didn't, however, really enjoy his book as much as I
anticipated before hand.)

Timba,

I think you have the right idea that option play should be limited to "mad
money" bets in small amounts. They're like playing penny stocks with murderous
spreads. At the same time, I think I'd tend to agree with Allen that Nov 12
1/2s are too far out of the money, with too close an expiration date, to give
the chart time to work. If you paid .4 on the ask, with the bid at .15 on 10
contracts, plus $60 in commission for the round trip, you're looking at an 80%
loss just for placing the trade. You'd still have to make up some ground
buying, for example, 3 Mar $15 contracts for about the same price, but at least
they still have some market value after the order fills, plus you have some
time cushion to let the trend work in your favor if you hit a dead cat bounce
like we saw in August. Either that or pay the higher premium for shorter dated
contracts, at or in the money, and figure on closing the position within a
matter of days. Also, starting positions at a time when there are a lot of
bears playing in the woods usually means you'll be fighting a certain amount of
profit taking by the short money any time there's a sharp drop in price.

Personally, I still like large cap insurance companies for put options. With
the third quarter looking like it'll end close to the bottom of the chart,
there should be a bloodbath on mark to market adjustments on their investments,
not to mention their huge exposure to corporate debt. Not a recommendation,
just an opinion. We'll see.

Not to change the off topic topic...but.....

I've been watching the indexes for foreign markets for awhile and have noticed
a couple which seem to be moving against the trend for the rest of the world.

While I find it hard to imagine investing in Pakistan or Sri Lanka, I was kind
of curious if anyone has a theory why they seem to be enjoying a bull market
when everything else is in the dumpster? So far I haven't seen any comments by
money managers claiming, "Oh yeah, I beat the market in 2002 by loading up on
Pakistani blue chips at the beginning of the year.". Would anyone admit it if
they had?

Perhaps you and Allen are correct. I have gone with what I thought to be the
appropriate risk/reward scenario for this particular situation. I plan to be
out of the trade before the end of October, which will leave some time value
remaining on the option. I believe if the price drops a few dollars from here
and does so within the next couple of weeks, that I'll be able to experience a
profit. If, as I suspect, the price drops more than that, well it'll be a
better trade still. If I am absolutely incorrect, then I've risked and lost
less than $500.

I haven't had time yet to become as proficient in options as Allen appears to
be, but hopefully life will be long enough for me to master another area when
the need is more pressing to do so.

Right now, my primary areas of focus are in determining the great buy prices in
selected issues and in searching for underpriced bonds. This option play was
just a "Oh, by the way!" kind of thing. I probably should not have posted it.

Timba,

Good luck on your options. Who knows, with the way the market is going, they
may be in the money before they expire. My account is currently mostly puts,
which I would normally consider insane, except it's about the only way I can
see to make money in this market.

The way things look right now, the Dow will crack support any day, and I
wouldn't be surprised to see it trading in the mid to upper 6000 range in the
next month or so. The contracts I'm holding expire in January and March. Most
of the positions were opened about the middle of the August rally, so I've been
under water for most of the last month. Since my timing isn't always perfect, I
normally target longer dated contracts to give myself some time cushion. I'm
not sure if my current strategy would make sense to anyone other than myself,
but I've been picking issues that look like they should be no brainers for long
play where the trend says there is something seriously wrong not being priced
into current valuations.

I think a lot of what we're starting to see is very similar to what happened
when SAB 101 went into effect. No one was willing to admit there was exposure
to the rule change, a lot of companies decided not to apply the rule change,
and a lot of companies started reporting substantially lower earnings for no
apparent reason. It looks like the CEO/CFO certifications are going to play out
the same way. Phase one is, "Ain't nothin' wrong with the books.". Phase two
is, "The economy is killing our results.". Plus there'll be a few QWests and
Xeroxes along the way. There are a lot of issues I wouldn't mind holding long
in a different market, but I can't see sitting on losses for an extended period
of time by betting against the trend. I think there'll eventually be a lot of
value plays of the "obsurd" variety, but I also think the market will have to
correct by around another 30-40% before it will be safe enough to buy and hold.
I'd rather be holding mostly cash when the market finally bottoms than a lot of
stock worth less than I paid for it.

BBD.b (TSE) has become a value play over the last weeks. Bombardier is number
one -- or very close -- in numerous segments of the transportation industry:
railroad transportation, snowmobiles, watercrafts and of course aeronautic
(regional jets).

We're talking about a company with more than $20 billion CDN in revenues, with
a backlog of over $45 billion CDN.

The stock is now trading close to $4 CDN, down from $24 before September 11.
It's about six times expected earnings per share of 70 Canadian cents.

Of course, there are many reasons for the stock trading at its current price.
Financial strength is among them. But all in all, I'd say that the situation is
far from being THAT bad.

A dividend of 18 cents goes with the common. There are also preferred shares
trading at big premiums, yielding more than 10% right now.

An other plus: insiders (namely the Bombardiers) have bought more than $12
million CDN in stocks at the beginning of September in the $6 to $7 range.

I know this is a Canadian stock and that investors on this board rarely venture
outside of the U.S, but I'd be glad to hear about other opinions, if anyone
would care.

Got chicken on my put options this morning and switched from bear to bull with
new trading positions in INLD and RETK. I don't know if we've hit bottom or
not, but it looks like the market needs a rest from recent selling pressure.
It's always a tough call when the market is trading around support levels
whether it will crack or form a double bottom. I don't have a fuzzy clue if I'm
doing this right or not, but I don't trust the market when it swings too hard
in either direction. This feels about the same as where the September reversal
kicked in last year. We'll see.

According to management projections, INLD will report their first free cash
flow positive quarter under the new business model this Q. Lots of cash and no
debt. $2

RETK is profitable with lots of cash and no debt. A big chunk of the $4.26 book
value is goodwill, but $1.83 is cash. Their history of turning intangibles to
cash strikes me as good. http://biz.yahoo.com/fin/l/r/retk_qb.html In this

RVFD has no debt to speak of, $21 million in cash (market cap. of $300

NSI -- I keep a close look to this one, recommended by Michael Burry in its
recent interview for Valueinvestorsclub.com.

The numbers were out today and the stock took a hit, although they did not look
all that bad. IMO what spooked the market was the asbestos exposure.

During the fourth quarter, management took a charge of $3.7 million ($6.0
million pretax), or 35 cents a share, for an increase in estimated net exposure
to future asbestos claims.

The company said it expects such claims for the next 50 years could require an
increase in its liabilities of $30 million to $75 million. Estimated
out-of-pocket costs, after insurance recoveries, could range from $16 million
to $18 million, it said.

IMO, $18 million over 50 years should be easily manageable for a company with
sales of better than $500 millions per year. Still, it's asbestos and the word
itself is enough to keep a stock on the floor for a long time...

Mold Claims Impact Insurance Industry, Remediation Business
WASHINGTON -- According to the National Association of Independent Insurers
(NAII), mold claims cost homeowners insurers $1 billion in 2001, a loss
considered to be a major factor in the first recorded fiscal-year loss in the
history of the property/casualty insurance industry.

While the decline of the stock market played a more significant role in the
industry's reported $7.9 billion deficit, the mold claim payouts present a
problem for insurers and a possible boon for remediators and indoor air quality
specialists.

"Health claims are being brought under property policies that were never
intended to cover them," said Gordon Stewart, president of the Insurance
Information Institute (III). "Fearing bad faith lawsuits, insurers often agree
to expensive tests and remediation procedures."

Testifying before Congress in July, Stewart outlined the industry's position
about mold hysteria as a major factor in the rising cost of homeowner's
insurance.

"Companies face a growing number of court cases with accusations of severe and
permanent health damage, without any peer-reviewed scientific research that
establishes a link between mold and serious health consequences," Stewart said.

NAII reported that mold claim payouts for 2001 increased five times over their
2000 levels.

According to Cleaning and Maintenance Management Online, janitorial and
sanitation industry experts expect this increase to continue in 2002 as public
concern about mold and lack of clear scientific evidence to dispel or validate
concerns persists.

FLM continues to get pounded. Longleaf Small Cap shows it as the top position
as of 6/30, and they have been positive on the stock since at least a couple
years ago in OID. the poor results of this fund (LLSCX) since July suggest that
FLM has remained a large POSition. amazing how last year's winners can be the
biggest losers this year--in 2001, FLM actually became a momentum stock of
sorts, with all sorts of nonvalue-oriented momo types jumping on the stock as
it tripled in a few months. certainly made Mason Hawkins look like a genius.
alas, alpha always absconds...

since Longleaf always makes a big deal about the high integrity of their
"partners" (i.e., investee companies--viz., stories of how they wouldn't invest
in some co when they heard the CEO hired a lady of the night, so the CEOs at
all their cos are super "high-integrity" folk, supposedly), i wonder what they
think about Hansen and crew now. the stock was down huge again today on big
volume despite the immensely oversold condition. is this co going BK, or is the
equity a buy somewheres in here? can Longleaf handle another large profile
blowup like this (fortunately, LLSCX is closed)? will they double down at these
low levels, or cut bait? are these 20% down days on double average volume the

Cash flow is horrible because of working capital investment due to the ramping
up of the national distribution network. If this trend continues, Fleming is
toast.

However, I feel that the deterioration in working capital has peaked, and now
Fleming should start generating positive CF from their working capital due to
increased inventory turns, an increasing payables/inventories ratio, and
sell-thru of the forward buys they did in the 2nd quarter to gain volume
discounts from their vendors.

Working capital is the thing to watch, IMO, with Fleming. It needs to stay flat

While FLM has had large CAPEX over the last 4 quarters, my system of cash flow
analysis factors that. They have poor working capital because they are bleeding
cash from operations. In the last 4 quarters, they have a negative CFO of 94M.
In addition to that they invested an excess of 56M in CAPEX.

I would be delighted with the CAPEX numbers if they were FCF positive, but they
are not. The negative numbers on CFO are not decreasing Q to Q. Whether this is
a business that makes all of its money in one Q or not, I don't know. But the
picture for 4Qs is not one I want to be invested in.

I haven't done a detailed analysis of FLM, so there is more that I don't know
about the company than there is that I know. I have only crunched the cash flow
numbers as provided by Yahoo.

You are correct in assuming that if they are correcting problems and have deep
enough pockets, they may weather this storm. I, however, am taking the position
that if, as a retailer, they can't make money in this strong consumer-driven
market, they will find it more difficult going forward as the consumer starts
to slow down.

I didn't talk about capex in my post at all. If you look at the line items in
the cash flow statement (specifically, cash flow from operations), you can
plainly see that it is the working capital adjustments that cause CFO to be
negative (i.e., cash is being used in working capital). Negative CFO cannot
cause working capital deterioration; the working capital deterioration causes
the negative CFO.

There should be quite a bit of improvement in working capital (i.e., cash will
be generated from working capital) through increased inventory turns and
improvement in the payables/inventories ratio, which should allow cash flow
from ops (and FCF) to ultimately be positive the rest of this year and in 2003.

At least, that's what is supposed to happen. And that was the whole point of my
post. Fleming is bleeding cash not because business is poor but because they've
done a poor job of managing working capital -- receivables, inventories, and
payables. If they can bring that back in line, they have a great chance of
generating nice FCF. If they can't, they're headed for big trouble. We'll just
have to see what actually happens.

<< I haven't done a detailed analysis of FLM, so there is more that I don't

The actual SEC filings are better to look at, IMO. Those actually break down
the numbers in a more meaningful way. Yahoo shows financial statements in a

actual SEC filings do.

I understand that the SEC filings contain more information, which is why I
appended the caveats to all of my posts on FLM. If I thought going to the
filings for this company was worth my time and effort, I would have done so.

I look at a lot of companies during the course of a week and I have only a
limited amount of time and energy to apply to finding great investments for
myself. Because of this, I have certain time-saving preliminary screening
tools, of which "Yahoo Financials" is one. If a company doesn't make it through
the preliminary screen, it's onward and upward in the search for another.

FLM wouldn't have warranted a look past my initial screens, but someone else
here was posting how wonderful they thought it was, so I decided to take a
quick look at the cash flow. It sucks. Somewhere down the road, if this or that
happens, it may not suck, or it may suck worse, I don't know and I don't care.
You wouldn't believe how many "stories" and "potentials" I've bought into over
the years. By and large, my experience is that the majority of the "potential"
doesn't ever get actualized and the "stories" have unanticipated (and usually
sad) endings. I buy performance these days.

You may very well be accurate in your assessment of FLM's potential. If you
have money invested in them, then I hope you are correct.

If you like the company, by all means don't let the opinion of some stranger on
the internet poke a hole in your balloon.

Regardless of how I may sound, I wish you all the best in this endeavor with
FLM. It is just not anywhere close to being something that would be of any

Good morning Paul,

My 2 cents: I wouldn't touch FLM-common because of it debt level. I and all of
my family members, and families (i.e., mother, father, brother, friends, etc.)
all have stated that they will not go to another grocery store other than Super
Wal-Mart because of the prices. This is both in Colorado and Montana -- so
maybe it is different in other locations. I know some people who despise
Walmart because of how they effect small companies when they move in to a

Timba,

Agree with your impression of FLM. With debt to equity at 3.26 to 1, it's a
cash burning machine, and has been for a long time. GAAP allows a lot of
current expenses to be capitalized as assets, and you just plain don't get a
debt to equity ratio that high, on a company that is supposedly profitable,
unless there is some very aggressive book cooking. FLM looks like a train wreck
waiting to happen. Eventually the creditors wise up and say, "If you're making
so much money, why do we have to keep loaning you more money to make your
payments?".

retail that means when customers can't find what they want one place, they go
someplace else. HD also plays a lot of games with their use of GAAP. There's a
ton of off balance sheet liabilities and it's a mystery to me how they get away
such a complete lack of disclosure in their filings in certain areas. Insiders
have both hands in the cookie jar, and are sucking money out of the company as
fast as their grubby little hands can grab.

On the flip side, I closed my short position because I thought there might be
some near term upside risk in the stock. About the best I can suggest is to see
what it does, and if support holds at $26.10. If it bounces off support, you
might see a double bottom type reversal, if support breaks, it would tend to
confirm the downtrend is still in effect. I hate trying to make a call in this
kind of area of a chart because there just plain isn't anything to go on. If
you're feeling lucky maybe the trick would be to throw some chump change at it
with options on a straddle play. It is volatile, and slightly out of the money
options are fairly reasonable in the three to six month range. I'd have a hard
time recommending it as a buy and hold play to fall in love with, but there
might be a trade in there someplace.

This has to be the strangest market I've ever seen. The Dow is almost as
volatile as Internet stocks were a few years ago. I guess if a person likes a
certain entry or exit point, just wait a few days and see if it show up. Weird.

Timba,

For some reason, you are totally misreading my posts. I'm not recommending
Fleming or saying that it will turn around. I'm merely presenting what I feel
Fleming needs to do if it hopes to turn things around. I was trying to go
deeper into why cash flow was negative and how it could possibly get fixed.

I was hoping to get responses that built on or pointed out flaws in my
analysis.

Since my responses to your posts on FLM appear to have missed the mark for what
you needed/wanted, I'll offer little response specific to them now except to
say that the reason most companies cash flows are negative flow back to either
the management or the business model or both.

The danger for an investor in "finding out what could be changed to make it
better" is that the investor: 1). doesn't know enough about that specific
business, in that specific market, with that particular personnel roster, and
those specific competitors and vendors; 2). The investor, even if well-versed
in all of the above, usually doesn't have the capital to buy enough ownership
to effect any meaningful changes; and 3). The whole exercise of trying to find
out what should be changed has the potential to leave the investor feeling more
confident about that company than the objective look at the numbers would
warrant, thereby increasing the chance of the investor allocating scarce
resources toward an investment of likely minimal capacity to positively reward
them with a sufficient rate of return for the risk assumed.

Since I seem to have difficulty interpreting your posts, I can only say that,
for myself, I find a much more constructive exercise in the evaluation of
announced changes and what I believe their impact might be on the profitability
of a marginally (or formerly) profitable business. Even in these situations,
however, I like the proof (via positive cash flow) to precede the investment.

Through the 4 Quarters ended 6/02 I get a positive Free Cash Flow for TQNT of

about 30% to what I'm looking for at a minimum.

re TQNT;

Several years ago, I thought of the company as a play on specialized
semiconductors, GAs, which were better suited for high frequency stuff than
plain ol Si. I haven't followed closely since probably 99, as I thought of the
entire Semi and Tech as over valued. I'm nibbling now in the Semi space, so I
have some catching up to do on technology evolution, new materials and what
not.

I believe TQNT merged with Sawtech, which mfgd specialized band filters used in
cellphones. This apparently finalized May of this year. So I'm not sure how
diverse their revenue sources are by market segment- or more plainly, how
exposed they are to cellphones vs other wireless apps. That is something I'd
like to know more about. I need to read the 10Q/K. I'll probably have a better
feel for the company then.

So I guess I can't say much yet about the outlook going forward, though I'm
hoping in general we have a brighter future than currently appears to be in
vogue.

I'll start an exploratory position in CIT.

Some negatives are that it loans money in complex transactions, so it's
accounting is difficult, so one has to trust management, and that has not been
a good way to bet. CIT's debt/eq is HIGH, possibly too high.

OTOH, we know that CIT arose from a sale by desperate TYC. Knowledgeable (I
hope) buyers, primarily institutions (I presume), were able to force a low
price (again, I presume). Yahoo shows first trades about 21-22 (July 3). Today
the stock's about 17.70. I note also insider buying at 21-23 by several
officers and directors. The President bought about $900k at prices between
$22.50-23.00. (But otoh, that's maybe peanuts to him because his pay is much
more than EXTREMELY high.)

Analysts expect the company to earn about $3/sh. If so, the p/e is okay (imo)
for the risks being assumed. CIT has had a good business history, bT (before
Tyco). Media reports have said that CIT, once free of TYC, might be able to
borrow its money at more favorable rates.
I'm hoping CIT will initiate dividends as it did pre TYC.

(Aside: I've owned CIT before. Mentioned it here (#10487) to no response. Got a
double plus though when TYC bought it out for stock. Sad to say, I kept the TYC
stock, watched it rise, watched it fall, bought more on its way down.)

From the WSJ, 10/19/00, "Tax-Loss Sellers Encounter Bargain Hunters Waving
Cash":
"Martin Whitman... was putting some cash to work... He sounded like a kid in a
candy shop. 'Little me, why did I think I'd be able to buy CIT Group below book
value, but I did today,' he chortled."

Book value per Yahoo today is $21.30.

It'll be interesting to me to see who the institutional holders of this stock
are when the quarter reports are issued.

I forgot about that article, mrcjmoney. I remember your post though, I did read
the article, and I also remember reflecting that that particular issue of
Barron's had several articles of interest to value investors: for another
example - that list of stocks with lots of cash/sh ("In the Bargain Bin")

I forgot about Mr Neff and CIT. The plusses were low p/e, and "in addition, the
company has indicated it plans to pay a dividend". Negatives: "...most of Wall
Street (are) worried aplenty about the company's credit quality."

I had earlier started a small position in C (which I see is a Neff choice.).
I'm considering adding to it. I'm holding on to WM. I still have my home
builder stocks: I've been adding very small amounts to DHI, the only one in the
article that I have in common with Mr. Neff.

I'll put BFT (Bally Total Fitness), another Neff pick, on my watch list. BFT's
tough because so many shorts say that BFT needs to increase capex to cover
equipment and plant upgrades. So much so that cash flow is going to be
impaired. Plus, there're issues (if I recall) regarding how BFT accounts for
its memberships. (Note: not sure I've got the negative story right. Anybody

MO, RJR: Couple years ago when there was discussion here and in the media about
tobacco and associated lawsuits and class action settlements, MO was trading
about 21, and I bought a very small amount. There were professional value
investors pounding the table, saying buy, buy. Others (also value mutual fund
mangers) were saying avoid because nobody can scope or figure what the extent
of liabilities is, how juries will vote or the $$ they might award, how public
distaste for tobacco companies will influence lawmakers, etc. The negative case
became too strong for me. The tobacco stocks couldn't be value stocks because
of so many unknowns. I lost confidence and sold at a loss and near the lows (as
you can see):

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MO&d=c&t=5y&l=on&z=b&q=l

I don't know if the situation with tobacco and liability has changed. Perhaps
we're in a 2nd round when the stocks will be brought to the floor by
lawsuits/pricing/taxes whatever.

However, with RJR now paying close to a 10% dividend, it is just too tempting.
So I am buying tobacco again today, and I will try again to hold on.

RJR's going for a p/e of 6, sells for $39+, has $28/sh in cash, book value of
$82, with d/e =.33 (Yahoo numbers)

of tobacco on this thread. And I've revisited my concerns again too. Let's not

What about technology value stocks?

After all, we are on the www.techstocks.com web site!

You compiled a long list of stocks a couple of weeks ago that is useful for
avoiding mutual fund management expenses, but it’s difficult to substantially
outperform the market with so much diversification. Your performance is likely
to mirror the general market.

I was disappointed to find that one of the stocks on your list was TFS, which
is listed as a "peer" in the AFCO SEC documents. TFS has lost 56% of it’s value
since I wrote post 177 on the AFCO thread, while AFCO rose 10%. TFS has earned
$0.78/share in the last 5 years for a yearly average of 16 cents, which implies
the P/E is 28. I don’t see a reason why it should rise above the $5.73 cash
value. I think we’re in an undervalued market where the average stock on your
list such as Kroger (KR) will rise 50% within a year, so TFS is unlikely to
outperform.

AFCO is on the verge of tripling revenues by providing Coke with equipment to
deposit a thin film of silicon dioxide to make the contents of plastic bottles
last 5x longer than uncoated bottles. The final manufacturing test was
conducted in September. This month their exclusivity agreement with Coke
expires, so they’ll be able to sell the equipment to other beverage companies.

There’s no reason to give up on tech stocks! As long as the companies you’re
considering are finding new markets to replace the traditional customers, you
can still make money!

What about technology value stocks.

Yes. I have had AFCO on my watch list. Wanted to buy it a little closer to cash
value, and so missed its rise. I don't know enough about its business for me to
see it as a buy based on its business prospects. That it might triple based on
its technology or potential sales of its products, makes it a story stock to
me. With your knowledge or experience or perspective, you might see it
differently

I don't know about TFS's business either. From where I started buying, I'm
underwater.
TFS cash on hand is $141M according to the company, which I make to be about
$6.50/sh. So this number is higher than Yahoo's $5.73/sh number. Stock's now
about $4.50/sh.

Trying to guess where we're going from here: TFS is expected to lose money this
year and next, while AFCO is expected to earn .58 (Yahoo consensus est.). At a
price today of about $10.93, that .58 is a pretty good return considering that
there's $7.50/sh in cash (no debt) in the AFCO stock.

For me, I'm sticking with my bet that TFS in the coming year can make some
business decisions that might either stem losses or enhance shareholder value.
A stock buyer now gets the business for free. It apparently isn't much of a
business, but over 1500 people are on the payroll doing something. (to improve
the business, I hope)

TFS is one of a number of tech stocks that I have bought. I certainly haven't
given up on tech stocks.
However, because I'm not knowledgeable in the specific niches or the specific
tech businesses, in this current market environment I want to see some catalyst
or some margin of safety before I start a position.

CMH: I have a significant position and have held off adding on this last dip
for technical issues: CMH appears to have broken a very long uptrend line
[drawn under lows from 85 on a Log chart]...on arithmetic charts, it's
approaching a trend line from early 90's...but that's not what I go by. Also it
seems to be acting badly in the absence of news and today, in the face of a
strong market. When a stock moves against the market on 'no news' it often
signals that there is news...and the cognoscenti are acting on it. Maybe Martha
Stewart was selling her shares or maybe the insiders that have filed intentions
from May forward are selling theirs. I don't know. Another possibility is the
sensitivity that folks in this industry have towards recessions. When the
economy catches cold, MH gets pneumonia.
I noticed that FLE has recovered nicely since the August lows...could that be
because of the RV component [RV biz is doing well], or could it be that they
are in talks to be, GULP, acquired...by CMH...an event that would be more fun
for FLE holders than those with CMH. Please note that the above speculation is
strictly hypothetical, a product of my imagination as I write this message and
reflects nothing I've heard or read.
While the above concerns are sufficient to keep me off the bid line, they are
not enough to prompt me to sell without substantial confirmation...[by which
time, it may be too late], because CMH has historically been a very well run
company with a financing arm that gives them a competitive advantage over
players dependent on the waning population of willing lenders to the industry.

Why it's not insane to be optimistic about stocks now
By Chris Pummer, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 10:32 AM ET Oct. 2, 2002

SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) - The many mutual-fund managers and stock analysts
who've made their way to Richard Geist's couch for counseling taught the noted
psychologist a valuable lesson - most bad investments result from letting
emotions cloud your judgment.

Since founding the Institute of Psychology and Investing near Boston in 1994,
Geist has been a leading researcher into the impact of psychology on investing
decisions. He's developed risk-profile questionnaires for advisers to use with
clients, consulted with financial-services firms on the mental underpinnings of
a good money manager, and explored the psychological triggers that produce
investment errors.

"If you don't understand how your own mind works in making investment
decisions, you're really an incomplete investor," said Geist, 59, who heads an
annual investing conference at Harvard, where he earned a doctorate in
psychology and is a part-time professor.

It's Geist's considered opinion that U.S. investors have become almost
universally blinded by emotion - for understandable reasons. The fear now
gripping the stock market stems from a warped sense of time - we've become so
focused on present interminable conditions that we see little hope for the
future.

"In the years building up to the bubble, technology advanced at a dramatic
innovation rate, and that led people to expect all sorts of instantaneous
change. Everyone's sense of time quickened, and it's very hard now, in a
prolonged bear market, to tolerate this slow-moving recovery.

"It now feels like we'll be in the doldrums forever, which makes it hard to be
even a long-term investor," said Geist, who also publishes Richard Geist's
Strategic Investing, a newsletter on microcap stocks. "Yet the people who are
more comfortable buying stocks in this type of market, like Warren Buffet,
often reap the greatest returns."

We spoke this week with Geist about why he's bullish on the market -- and why
the rest of us aren't:

Q: The stock market just came through a crushing third quarter. Anyone who's
bullish at this point would have to be certifiably insane, wouldn't they?

A: No, they'd just be contrarian, which isn't a bad thing.

Investing isn't a natural act -- it's been ingrained in our psyche that it's
much better to be part of the crowd, but the most successful investors are
always ahead of the crowd. To be a bull in this market is to be out there
alone, which just doesn't fit with our adaptive, evolutionary psyche, just as
to be a bear in March of 2000 didn't fit with anyone's psyche then.

This is a psychologically difficult time -- there's blood running in the
streets and most people have lost enough money that they're too anxious,
depressed, agitated or lethargic to be interested in the market. Toward the end
of a bear market, most people are focused on nothing more than preserving what
little capital they have left. Yet it is at that point that the most money is
usually made.

Q: Market bears cite endless reasons why the stocks are doomed to tank further;
how can you discount those factors?

A: You can take almost any statistic, and depending whether you're bullish or
bearish, you can make it positive or negative. Some of the bears may be right
that large company stocks became so overvalued that they still have a way to
fall, but the more important issue is that 90 percent of those stocks are
driven by institutional trades, which means indiscriminate selling without
regard for valuations.

There are great values out there even among large-cap stocks, but institutional
managers may sell them because everyone else is selling and they're concerned
about meeting a benchmark performance, or they're the most liquid stocks, and
when there are redemptions, the most liquid stocks get sold.

Q: But is there any basis to be bullish now, from a market analysis standpoint?

A: The S&P 500 is 46 percent undervalued right now based on what people believe
is the Fed's formula for valuing the stock market. P/Es (price-to-earnings
ratios) are still historically high, but the market's average P/E can be higher
when interest rates are low.

Psychologically, we're seeing some of the most prolonged bearish sentiment
we've seen in decades, which is typically a contrary indicator. And the Fed's
monetary policy is extremely accommodating right now and probably will be into
next year.

To be bearish right now for the long-term means you're going against very
positive internal dynamics in the market. Externally, there are clear factors
prolonging the turnaround -- Iraq, Middle East tensions, fear of terrorism and
fear that earnings will continue to disappoint because there's no pricing
power. But external issues are generally outweighed by the market's internal
dynamics after a prolonged period of time.

Q: How does one go about being risk-averse in this market environment?

You have to have the time, the energy and the passion to do your own research,
and search for significant differences between the market price and intrinsic
value of a company -- the private market value of a company. The difference
between the two is what Benjamin Graham used to call the margin of safety. That
gives you a leg up over most institutions, because they function according to
relative performance. Investors in the small to mid cap area are more oriented
toward absolute performance.

Q: Is the risk of being overly bearish now worse than being overly bullish?

A: One of the primary reasons contrary investing works, once everyone is
convinced a stock will continue going down forever, there's probably no one
left to sell. That's one reason why extreme points in the market represent
turning points.

It may not be risky to be a short-term bear at this point if you know you'll
trade in and out of the market over the next few weeks, and you're counting on
October being one of the poorer months in the market. But for the traditional
long-term investors, there is a lot more risk in being bearish right now than
being bullish.

The truth is, bear markets have a tendency to end in October, and so we may
have to suffer through a few more weeks. But there's about $2.7 trillion
sitting on the sidelines right now - that's a lot of money waiting for a sign
to go back in. Despite all the pessimism, baby boomers need the stock market to
fund their retirement and their children's education, so they'll get back in on
the first hint we're turning around. And money managers are paid to be
invested, so they can't sit back too much long either.

Q: How would you suggest investors begin changing from bears to bulls?

A: If you want to buy $10,000 of XYZ Corp., you could buy $5,000 worth, and
hold the rest in cash. If this market doesn't bottom out until the end of
October, you can get the other 50 percent at a lower price by the end of this
month, and if the market rides up, it's also fine to buy on the way up.

That's a truncated version of dollar cost averaging. This market is extremely
volatile, and volatility can be a friend to a contrarian, because whatever you
buy will be volatile enough to buy at a lower price. You want to focus on
absolute returns over relative returns, which means not relying on index funds,
assuming you have the interest and time and energy to do your own investing.

If this market were to turn around next week, know what you would buy, what you
would sell and what you would hold onto. That kind of cognitive process
prepares you to return.

This type of market tends to rebound about 40 percent before most people get
back in. If you're engaged in those kind of mental exercises, you're more
likely to get back in earlier in the run-up because you'll feel much more
prepared.

Great article - thanks. Very timely post in my view. I find myself by far more
fully invested than I've been at any time in the last two years - and that was
not true a month ago. Every stock I own is probably going lower tomorrow, but
that is exactly what it will feel like on whatever day happens to be the bottom
of this collapse. I used to make market calls on this thread, years ago, but
thats silly and I was never right. I buy when I have good ideas, I get fully
invested when I have a lot of really really compelling ideas. I've seen buy
ideas like this twice since I got going in 1995. March of 2000 and September of
2001. Both were great times to be buying the kinds of stocks we buy, though at
both times we were in agony over losses from what we already owned and there
was no reason whatsoever other than valuation to buy then. I'm learning that
its not about making market calls, its about knowing when you're seeing a whole
lot of compelling buys at the same time and knowing when you're not finding
anything.

An industrial company in a prosaic business. Price near low, but p/e a little

If you didn't know though, you wouldn't guess the good performance this company
has delivered:

http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/invsub/results/compare.asp?Page=TenYearSum

Look at that book value growth. Not a bad ROE history either. Also that net
profit margin performance.

Given the business the company's in I'd say maybe it should be looked at like a
value-stock. If so, the price still seems a little high to me (in this market
where there are other attractive value stocks available). That's regarding p/s,
p/b, p/e and no dividend (for some price support). Yet there's continued
profit, no debt, sale of non-core assets, and a good history. It's got some
growth characteristics better than many growth stocks. (I came across this
stock in looking at stocks bought by a Buffett- following fund manager.) Given
the business it's in though, could it actually be a growth stock going out 5 or
10 more years? If so, maybe the stock's cheap at current price.

Anyone here with an opinion to share on this stock?

i must take issue with the interviewee's logic and conclusions...

The S&P 500 is 46 percent undervalued right now based on what people believe is
the Fed's formula for valuing the stock market.

the "Fed model" is a joke. it is sloppy data mining at best. it worked for 20
years so people called it a law. but it didn't work at all for many other 20-yr
periods, and it hasn't worked for the past year either. this is another example
of people being "fooled by randomness".

P/Es (price-to-earnings ratios) are still historically high, but the market's
average P/E can be higher when interest rates are low. 

this presupposes a permanent correlation between rates and PEs. there is no
such correlation. this is just more data mining. it is really sad to see the
warm and uncritical welcome such sloppy thinking gets in today's market. just
indicates to me that sentiment is nowhere near bearish enough for a secular
bull to begin again.

these types of arguments about stocks being cheap because of low interest rates
are utterly demolished by Smithers. i summarized some of these ideas and
provide links to a couple of his papers here:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=17888745&s=smithers

basically, low rates are not an argument for high PEs. PEs (or more
specicifically the dividend yields which depend on them) are a real return;
rates a nominal one.

remember that in the last low-rate environment, from the 40s through the 50s,
stock dividend yields were higher than bond yields (until 1958). the S&P 500
would need to fall to 410 for today's dividend yield to exceed the 10yr T
yield. about a 50% drop. this was pointed out by Fleckenstein yesterday.

Paul and James, I have been an investor in stocks since 1980 and a full-time
investor (sometimes trader) since 1990. For longer term investors, when the
gloom was the most severe has been the best time to accumulate stocks. I will
admit that the current environment is more difficult and the public and "the
street" more down-beat, than anytime since 1980. Those that are buying
companies now with strong balance sheets, will be rewarded in the future. The
key points of that last sentence....strong balance sheet..future. My experience
has been that Tech stocks become the most over-valued and under-valued in
market cycles, and all of my stocks under accumulation are technology stocks.
The biggest danger to accumulating wealth in the future is to get caught up in
the "doom and gloom" talk of "market strategists" and especially the "experts"
that frequent boards like this, although this value board seems to have more
"market savy" people than most message boards. If you would like a copy of an

Looks like an appropriate albeit difficult time for value investors to commit
funds to selected stocks.

Hard to even envision when the broad-based selling pressure will abate. I
suspect that when people get their 3rd quarter mutual fund reports in a few
days and see the carnage that's been wrought, there'll be quite a bit of
liquidation by shocked and dismayed fund holders.

Still I remain a buyer. Today I added a small amount to my holdings of ACAS and
continued to slowly build small positions in NCR, MBI, MCGC, and RJR.

They like NITE. I've looked at it a couple of times and always passed. Can't

Kahn Article:

Kahn-Trary Opinions

Kahn Brothers beats the market by bucking trends and staying
true to Ben Graham

By ANDREW BARY

Irving Kahn not only can boast of being one of the oldest active investors on
Wall Street, but also being among the few who sold stocks short before the 1929
Crash. At 96 years old, he still is chairman of Kahn Brothers, a New York
investment management firm, which can point to some exceptional
accomplishments of its own, notably that it is thriving in the current bear
market.
That owes much to hewing to the value precepts laid down by Kahn's friend and
mentor, the late Benjamin Graham, who's considered the father of modern
security analysis.

Through August, a representative equity account managed by Kahn Brothers was
up 7% after gaining 23.9% in 2001 and 16.8% in 2000 -- quite a showing in the
worst bear market since 1973-1974. For the nearly 10 years ended in August,
this
account was up 19%, double the returns on the Standard & Poor's 500 index.

Like father, like sons: The Kahns, with paterfamilias Irving
flanked by Thomas (left) and Alan, are making money by sticking
to their value principles that went out of fashion in the bubble of
the 1990s.

This performance reflects the Kahns' focus on stocks -- many of them relatively
obscure -- that have what Graham called a "margin of safety" in that they sell
at or
close to book value or for a modest price/earnings ratios. Kahn Brothers'
results,
however, can have little correlation with the S&P 500; the firm's accounts
badly
trailed the index during the technology-dominated bull market of the late
1990s.
But their portfolios got hit along with the rest of the market in September,
with
equity accounts now about flat for the year.

Founded in 1978, the firm, which runs $570 million, doesn't have a mutual fund
and instead runs separate accounts for each of its clients. "We lost assets in
the
tech bubble and now we're starting to attract new money, mostly from total
strangers" says Thomas Kahn, Irving's 60-year-old son, who runs the firm's
operations. He says the firm generally wants new investors to put up at least
$1
million, but some exceptions are made.

Tom shares the title of co-chief of investments with his brother Alan Kahn, 64,
who has gained a reputation as one of the country's leading advocates for
shareholder rights from his lawsuits over the past two decades against Ronald
Perelman, Charles Hurwitz of Maxxam and Harold Simmons.

The Kahns don't advertise and they don't have a marketing staff. Yet the firm
has
attracted about $50 million in new money in the past year, largely by word of
mouth. Turnover is low at 10% to 20% annually, which means their portfolios
tend to be quite tax-efficient.

Irving, meanwhile, remains a guiding force at the firm, which has just 12
employees. He's in the office daily and sometimes on weekends. On pleasant
evenings, he'll walk the mile from the firm's Madison Ave. offices to his
apartment
on the Upper East Side. "I'm often asked why I'm still working at 96, and my
reply is that I find the security-analysis profession very rewarding and I get
the
opportunity to make use of a 70-year career on Wall Street." The longevity of
Irving and his three siblings, also 90-plus, has made them subjects of a
Harvard
University study seeking a genetic secret to long life.

Irving recalls 1929, when he was convinced the market was overpriced and
shorted 50 shares of Magma Copper. "Everyone said I'd lose my money but I
ended up doubling it after the break in '29." A voracious reader of scientific
journals, he remains very much in the present.

"Irving would rather talk about a new investment in photonics than reminisce
about the crash of 1929. He's very focused and forward looking," says Carl
Schecter, the head of the risk-arbitrage trading group at Nomura Securities who
has known the Kahns for two decades.

Irving, for instance, is a nuclear-power proponent, arguing that it will
continue to
play a vital role in electricity generation around the world. This led the
Kahns to an
investment in USEC, the leading supplier of enriched uranium to the nuclear
industry. The formerly government-owned USEC now trades under 7, below its
book value of more than $11 a share.

Graham's investment philosophy, laid out in such books as "The Intelligent
Investor" and in lectures at Columbia Business School, emphasized stocks of
companies with ample book value and little debt. These stocks were plentiful in
the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, when Graham ran a lucrative investment partnership.
Irving helped Graham prepare the Columbia lectures and acted as a "bird dog" in
search of investment ideas for Graham's partnership.

Reflecting Graham's influence, the
Kahns often favor companies whose
shares trade at a discount to book
value. But Irving says they seek to
"augment" financial analysis with an evaluation of management and a company's
competitive position. Unlike many value investors, the Kahns will buy
technology
stocks, including Hologic, a maker of an innovative digital X-ray plate that
has
been licensed to Siemens.

The single biggest element of the Kahns' success in the past decade has been
their
investment in a gaggle of New York-area thrift institutions, some of which are
up
tenfold in price. One of the firm's larger holdings is New York Community
Bancorp, which now trades at 27, up 15% this year and way above its initial
public offering price of 1.65 in 1993. This buy-and-hold approach borrows from
Graham's most famous protege, Warren Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire
Hathaway.

When Barron's profiled Irving 7 1/2 years ago ("True Believer," March 13,
1995),
he and his sons recommended several New York savings and loans, including
Albank Financial, JSB Financial and Reliance Bancorp, that have all been taken
over. The Kahns' view of New York Community is that it's a "hold" owing to
valuation -- almost three times book value and 10 times earnings. "New York
Community is one of the best-managed banks in the country," says Tom. "If it
gets cheaper, we'll buy it for clients that don't now own it."

The Kahns did make mistakes, including purchases of Imperial Holly and
Mississippi Chemical in the 1990s. "Most of our mistakes turn out to be
dead-money investments, not lost-money investments," Tom says.

Owing to its modest size, Kahn Brothers can play in many small and midsize
companies, but it lately has been putting money into some big stocks, including
Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck. "We bought the drugs in 1993 when they were
depressed by the Clinton health-care plan, and several of them yielded 5%.
We're
nibbling again," says Tom.

The three Kahns often work independently on their investment ideas, although
agreement among them is required for the firm to buy or sell individual stocks.

Irving's favorites include Advanced Marketing Services, a distributor of books
that's become a major force in the business by selling to warehouse clubs such
as
Costco. He originally recommended it in March 1995, when it traded around 2.
Advanced Marketing now trades at about 14, off from a peak of 27 earlier this
year. It fetches a modest 11 times projected profit in the fiscal year ending
March
2003 and less than two times book value. "It's a growing company," he says.
"Management owns about a third of the stock and it has very little debt."

Irving also likes Seaboard, a thinly traded conglomerate run by the secretive
Bresky family that trades at about 220 a share, a little more than half its
book value
of $363 a share. Seaboard has a large hog operation in rural Oklahoma and also
owns Seaboard Marine, one of the largest cargo operators in the Caribbean and
South America. The company amounts to a Cuba play because it's poised to
benefit if U.S. trade relations with Cuba are normalized.

"You have to think of Seaboard as an investment in a private company and not
pay
attention to the stock quote," Tom says, adding that he thinks the company is
worth at least double its current price.

Nam Tai Electronics, a low-cost contract maker of electronics with substantial
operations in China, is another favorite of Irving's. It trades at 18, about 10
times
earnings and a small premium to its book value of $16.

Alan is partial to American National Insurance, a low-profile Texas life
insurer
whose thinly traded shares are around 70, a discount to their book value of
$110.
"American National is a wonderful statistical bargain," he says. The stock
trades at
14 times projected 2002 profit and yields 3.5%. Alan thinks the controlling
Moody
family eventually will sell it. "This is a stock that could double or triple
overnight,
but they aren't going to tell you ahead of time when that will happen," he
observes.

Kansas City Southern, the railroad best known for its former ownership of the
Janus mutual-fund company, is one of Alan's favorites because of the takeover
appeal of its rail network, which runs through the midsection of the country
and
down into Mexico. "It's a NAFTA play," he says. The stock trades at about 12,
just above book value and 16 times depressed profits of 80 cents projected for
2002. "In the short run, their business will reflect the economy, but
ultimately
Kansas City Southern won't exist as an independent company. Fair value is twice
the current price," he argues.

Alan also likes Knight Trading Group, the Nasdaq market maker whose stock has
crashed to 4 from a high of 78. "It's trading below book value of $6.50 a share
and also selling below cash per share when you include Knight's investment in
its
hedge fund," he says. Knight had $503 million in cash on its balance sheet on
June
30, including $153 million in funds run by its investment-management unit,
worth
$4.15 a share. "Nobody is more aggressive, entrepreneurial or profit-oriented
than
an OTC market maker," notes Alan. He believes Knight, now operating at a slight
loss, will find ways to make money or sell out at a sizable premium to its
current
price.

Tom is partial to CNA Financial, the property-and-casualty insurer, which
trades
at 25, a steep discount to its book value of $37. CNA has had poor operating
results in recent years but he is encouraged that Loews, which controls 90% of
CNA, pumped nearly $1 billion into the company in a rights offering in
September
2001. "The Tisches wouldn't have done this if they thought the reserves were
inadequate," Kahn says, referring to Loews' controlling shareholders. He thinks
CNA, benefiting from the property-and-casualty upturn, can earn $4 a share in
2004. If that happens, the stock could easily top 40, he adds.

MONY Group, the depressed life insurer, also appeals to Tom because it trades
for 25, a fraction of its book value of $41. Its valuation is high based on
projected
profits of just 80 cents a share this year, but he says those weak returns
could
prompt a takeover of MONY after November 2003. That's when a New York
state rule capping an investor's ownership in the company expires. Tom puts
MONY's value at 40 to 50 a share.

Tom calls Audiovox, a distributor of cellphones to Verizon and others, a "value
investor's Nokia;" at 7, it's just half book value. He's also partial to 3Com
at 4 --
below book value of $5 and little more than the cash on its balance sheet.
Those
are numbers the Kahns can really connect with.

Interesting. I started accumulating USEC when it reached 8% yield a while ago
and kept averaging down into the 5's. There was a pump and dump game with the
stock and sold the positions I had except for the positions purchased below $6.
This is a monopoly of sorts, but there is a group that is thinking about
starting a competing business. I do not know where they are going to get the
capital in this type of environment and we all know the initial numbers to
build the complex and get it up and running will have cost overruns. I have
been looking to add to my position as the stock has been sold off recently -
now I suppose there will be a surge in price after this article.

I am also in MRK (a little early), but have been scrambling like heck to keep
my asset value, as I bought the stock and sold calls. I gave up some of the
call proceeds to purchase protective puts which has saved my hide. <g>

Can you run your numbers on AMCC and IDTI?

I get major negative cash flow for both companies.

TimbaBear,

We are seeing a number of companies confessing lately that they have been
selling puts to buy stock for stock options and enhance earnings during the
1990's. For the life of me I can not find these disclosures in the SEC filings.
I must not be looking in the right place. Do you have some guidance of where to
look?

TIA,

Joan,

There was an article last week on this very topic here;

http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/P31234.asp

They suggest looking in the notes in the 10K. LLY is mentioned as a culprit. I
also noted from ContraryInvestor that LLY has generous assumptions on Pension
returns. Maybe looking it LLY's 10k for an example of the kind of language to
search for? Haven't tried it yet myself... so your mileage may vary. <g>

Thanks. I knew AMCC was cashflow negative, but for some reason had thought IDTI
was positive. Looking for a third time, I see not. Hmm. Odd things to
understand in the CAPEX column too. I was trying to find other examples in the
Semi space to support the idea that maybe we were starting to see 'baby with
the bathwater' examples in the space in the less well followed names.

Back to work....

From the most recent 10Q for LLY (I left the header and inserted the page
number for reference):

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY
As of June 30, 2002, we have purchased $1.59 billion of our announced $3.0
billion share repurchase program. We purchased approximately 2.1 million shares
during the first half of 2002 at a net cost of approximately $181.0 million. In
connection with the share repurchase program, we have entered into agreements
to purchase shares of our stock. As of June 30, 2002, we have agreements to
purchase up to approximately 4.5 million shares of our stock from an
independent third party at various times through December 2003 at prices
ranging from $86 to $100 per share and with a weighted average of approximately
$91 per share. The number of shares to be purchased will be reduced ratably
each quarter through the expiration of the agreements. In addition, as of June
30, 2002, equity forward contracts, which provide for purchase of a total of
approximately 900,000 shares, remain outstanding at $83 per share, expiring in
November 2002. If the options are exercised, the contracts allow us, at our
discretion, to repurchase the shares for cash or deliver to the holder cash or
shares for the difference between the contractual exercise price and the market
price of our stock. Our objective in entering into the above agreements was to
reduce the average price of repurchased shares. [page 8]

The bolded part surely does seem like LLY wrote put options, since they appear
to be saying they have but at prices much higher than today's prices.

-------

Item 2. Changes in Securities and Use of Proceeds
Reference is made to the information on sales of put options and other equity
derivatives related to repurchases of Lilly stock as described in the
accompanying notes to consolidated condensed financial statements. All such
transactions were exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933. No public offering or public solicitation was used in the offering
of these securities. The transactions were privately negotiated, and all
offerees and purchasers were accredited investors and/or qualified
institutional buyers. [page 13]

Hope this helps.

Timba,

For the first pass, I was just looking at the 'operating' cash flow reported at
yahoo. In the case of IDTI, I must have only looked at the most recent quarter-
normally I look at the changes over the previous 4 quarters and dig a bit
deeper. Probably wanting too much to find other companies and looking at too
much data too quickly.

re TQNT, more data after a fourth pass;

Positives;

Retiring convertible subordinated debt at a discount. This does have the impact
of boosting post tax income some though.

Joint Strike Force exposure; note that recently the British decided to jump on
board and ordered I believe 100 of one configuration of this plane. Note also
that I haven't done enough work to know when this might hit revenue, and I
doubt it could offset losses encurred in other business segments (ie
Cellphones) if there are serious slowdowns in end markets.

Nice 'Moat'. Developed specialized expertise in GaAS, SiGe and other niche
technologies. These guys are _not_ DRAM mfgs.

Macro scene. Semi shipments up yoy (14% by one recent report) plus positive
guidance from RFMD (granted, a competitor so this raises market share
concerns).

Mgmt- no options repricing per policy, nice IR support on the web. (ie conf
call transcripts).

Positive Cash Flow 5yrs +, trading below cash.

Questions;
Backlog- recent report their Book to Bill was 1.07, but I've not 'reread'
enough to see how backlog looks.

Negatives;
Potential charge on retiring Texas production facilities as a result of the
consolidation into Richardson.

Costa Rica tax holiday ending- drops from 100% to 50% 2003-2005, then gone
completely. However, looking at their financials, it appears they have tax loss
carryforwards (appx 20million) and the Costa Rica tax holiday hasn't boosted
eps (assuming I understand what I'm reading correctly).

Potential AR risk if their clients go under, ie LU/NT/JDSU/ERICY.

Paul, regarding RJR, what do you think of the following article:

http://quote.bloomberg.com/fgcgi.cgi?ptitle=Top%20Financial%20News&s1=blk&tp=ad
topright_topfin&refer=topfin&T=markets_box.ht&s2=ad_right1_topfin&bt=ad_positio
1_topfin&box=ad_box_all&tag=financial&middle=ad_frame2_topfin&s=APaA2KRY1Ui5KLi
S

I was particularly surprised to read that the dividend might be in jeopardy if
the price pressures remained too long. I don't know how RJR with its sound
balance sheet could come to that.

Here is an excerpt:

"Cut a couple of hundred million in dollars from net income this year and
they'll have a tough time paying a dividend,'' Peris said. R.J. Reynolds
increased its quarterly dividend by 8.6 percent in June to 95 cents a share."

Like you, I took a position lately, largely because of the dividend. I was also
feeling quite sure of my investment, because of the book value and the cash at
hand. Now, I am very skeptical about was said in this article, but I can't help
but fear that the stock will trend down if such talks become widely spread.

Marc Fortier. re RJR. I don't see why there'd be a need to cut the dividend.
RJR's still going to be very profitable even with the latest lowered earnings
estimates. And as you mention, there is that cash. The article doesn't seem
balanced enough to me.

Seems to be true though that more people are going discount cigarettes vs.
paying for the premium. A pal of mine has even started to roll his own. I only
last saw people doing that when prices really jumped couple of years ago, and
MO roiled the market by dropping premium prices. I figured it would be the end
of brands. I was wrong then.

Now I figure it'll be the end for brands - and my investment - when I start to
see women rolling 'em.

Well, I still can't believe this story. And the guy is holding a large chunk of

I just hope that management will come out with good earnings and answer this
talk in the proper fashion.

Tobacco/Value/Margin of Safety

Paul -- I agree that these stocks offer some attractive prices and dividend
payouts. I think the payouts are very safe -- it is a significant factor for
why many investors own these cash-cow-tobacco firms.

My own strategy has always been to purchase puts with covered call proceeds and
collect the dividend and any capital appreciation. I don't think tobacco firms
offer any margin-of-safety based upon the constant litigation factors -- unless
protective puts are purchased simultaneously with the common.

Thoughts on the next 12-months: I think that big MO, et al, will be in the next
12-months offered at even more attractive prices (a la 3-years ago when big MO
dropped below $20). Although a $28 billion verdict will obviously be reversed,
there are too many new lawsuits being debated and lost by big tobacco. Then it
will be time to pounce -- or at least in my mind. :)

Jury Awards $28 Billion To Smoker in Tobacco Case

A WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE NEWS ROUNDUP

LOS ANGELES -- "...After deliberating for just under two days, a Los Angeles
jury awarded $28 billion in punitive damages to a 64-year old woman dying of
cancer in a lawsuit brought against tobacco giant Philip Morris Cos.

The Superior Court jury awarded the amount to Betty Bullock, 64, of Newport
Beach, who started smoking when she was 17 and was diagnosed last year with
lung cancer that has since spread to her liver. It's the biggest individual
award in a smoker's case brought against the tobacco industry..."

<<<What about technology value stocks.>>>

I picked up a few shares of AMD at 3.71 (1/3 book value) Friday morning.
Naturally it fell another .20 since then. It's looking like I should have kept
my put portfolio a while longer. I've been getting clobbered pretty good since
I started buying stock again, and I was able to resist as long as I could. I
don't have a fuzzy clue where techs are going to bottom, but some of the prices
I'm seeing have me almost as amazed as I'd be if I pulled into a filling
station and saw gas at forty cents a gallon. Oh well.

I show AMD with negative cash flow of $1.05/share over the last 4 quarters. I
think it gets much cheaper unless somebody (like AAPL?) buys them out.

I'm considering adding to my few shares of AMD. Always a second fiddle to
Intel, it nevertheless has sold at higher prices, at higher p/sales, higher
p/book in years past. That they have endured and that they have around $1B in
cash give me some confidence that they may live to fight another day.

'03 will be a loser year for earnings according to predictions (Yahoo). AMD has
come back from losing years before though. Next year this time things may be
looking up as investors (if there are any left) begin to anticipate a positive
(perhaps) '04 for AMD. Of course, that's not to say the stock can't or won't go
lower meanwhile.
