I echo the same about Clayton. He is thought of as a God around my neck of the
woods. He is an example of if at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again.
I believe he BK'd once or twice. There are also some interesting rumors that
float around about his lifestyle. But, that's neither here nor there if he runs
a tight ship. In the last year he has run into some community unrest by trying
to place one of his mobile home subdivision developments (trailer park with
larger lots and paved roads and the like)in area that is not privy to trailer
parks. In a planning class I took in college we studied Clayton and his
manufacturing process and I have to say I was impressed. I'm not sure why I
haven't bought CMH, I guess I just can't get over the trailer trash image. What
part of Big Orange country are you located?

 I guess I just can't get over the trailer trash image.

I guess I don't have that image at all. There were a lot of mobile home parks
where I grew up and a lot of my friends lived there. Many others lived in
doublewides. I never thought much about it and most of the families were pretty
normal. Not the stereotypical image I think much of the country has. Incomes
just aren't very high in much of rural America.

BTW, I was reading through one of my Champion annual reports and it seems the
Redman merger mentioned earlier occurred sometime in '97.

What part of Big Orange country are you located?

I'm in Nashville but am originally from Kentucky and still pull for "the blue
mist" as the Cats are called down here. I don't think I'm going to be able to
convert to following UT though.

Jim Clayton has put up 17% return on equity for something like 10 years in a
row with a conservative balance sheet. And there is no sign I can see that that
track record is coming to an abrupt halt. You can buy CMH for 11 times
earnings. I will go on record again and say that the stock is worth $20 a
share. (It trades at 11 and change)

I bought Clayton at its low in the fall of '96 but at the current price the
only money I have made on it was a sell of part of my position at a peak a year
or so ago. Their earnings per share are about 40% higher than they were when I
bought the stock. Not a great investment so far, but I don't care.

I have a live order in to buy a profitable net-net at about 50% of its net
current asset value, but the damned market maker won't give me a sixteenth off
the ask. The market maker raised the ask price on me twice today without trades
when he had an order for more than the day's volume at a reasonable limit. I
think I might pull that order tomorrow and just buy more Clayton. Unless I am
missing something big, and have missed it for three years watching every
quarterly the company files, I am looking at a double here with very little
downside. OK, talked myself into it. (But that means you all have got to wait
even longer to find out what this net-net is. Sorry.)

If you don't have a copy of Clayton's annual report, get it. And focus on the
10 year historical financials page. It doesn't get much better than this at 11
times earnings. If you're worried about what a recession or rising interest
rates does to this company, the 10 year financials give you a chance to see
what the business did last time interest rates were rising and in the last
recession.

No, there is no catalyst. The company has grown its earnings all but one
quarter in the last ten or twelve YEARS. They have a conservative balance
sheet. They don't miss quarters. In this market that loves predictability and
high return on capital, I still cannot understand why this stock does not trade
at 25 times earnings. That would be about $28 a share. Tell me where I'm wrong
in this analysis, because I think I am looking at a dollar bill for 50 cents.

Hi James, re: CMH

No, there is no catalyst

I still cannot understand why this stock does not trade at 25 times earnings.

Would I be naive in responding, "who cares?" Not that I don't think it doesn't
sound like a good investment idea but rather, who cares if a catalyst never
appears, and who cares if the stock never grows its multiple?

If this enterprise is honestly earning 17% ROE, and you can buy it for
(according to Yahoo! -- uh-oh ;-) 1.8X book value, isn't this a
"sort-o-Buffett" kind of stock?

Provided that they continue to earn good ROE like this, selling out at 11X
earnings 10-15 years from now looks pretty attractive from where I stand. Of
course if all of this is true, not selling it 10-15 years from now would
probably be even more attractive ;-)

- Daniel

(just looking at their long term stock price, from 88 to today, the stock price
seems to have grown from about $1.8 (as near as I can eyeball Yahoo!'s
logarithmic chart ;-), to $11-5/16 today. This growth of 6.28X over 11 years
works out to 18% per annum. So perhaps the apparent 17% ROE is worth looking
into......)

Good comments. This market does not like boring stocks that have no pizzazz.
However, I confidently predict that looking back 10-15 years from now, a 10-15%
annual return on an investment will look pretty good. The P/E offers a margin
of safety.

I do think the stock suffers from several things that won't go away:
-homebuilders don't carry high P/E's
-manufactured housing is lumped with home building although it is probably less
cyclical
-the historic reputation of mobile homes/parks, etc.
-the fact that there are a large number of somewhat similar companies,
making it tougher to pick one out -- you really have to be an expert to know
the differences

Suggestion for a technology/growth stock that pays a dividend (!) and is
trading at value stock valuations.

BELFB - Electronic components supplier. They supply to the networking division
of 3Com and some divisions of Lucent, among others. For the three months ended
3/31/99, net sales rose 58% to $30.8 million. Net income rose 73% to $5.1
million. Those are pretty good growth numbers. NO long term debt. BELFB has
paid a dime dividend in the last two quarters.

At March 31, 1999, Bel Fuse reported working capital of $46,139,000, a current
ratio of 4.4:1, cash and equivalents of $14,775,000, no long-term debt, and
stockholders' equity of $93,951,000. That's stockholders' equity of about
$17.40 per share. There is one analyst making EPS forecasts, and they have them
making $3.76 in 1999. The company made 95 cents last quarter, so this estimate
seems reasonable.
Based on the estimate, the PE at today's price ($28) is only 7.5x, which seems
pretty low for a company growing earnings at 73% year over year.

FYI - Last summer, the company split the stock into BELFA (which gets voting
rights) and BELFB (which has no voting rights, buy receives a dividend). The
total number of shares outstanding did not increase, however.

Well, is there a more attractive "value" stock out there?

Bel Fuse: Growing Out of the Micro-Cap Shadows
Bel Fuse (Nasdaq:BELFA - news) is a relatively obscure but fast-growing
manufacturer of electronic components. It's plugged into several hot areas of
technology including networking and DSL telecom equipment. Some investors have
discovered Bel Fuse as a behind-the-scenes play on the exploding
Internet/high-speed communications market. The upside to Bel Fuse is that this
company has actual profits without all the hype of better known and
highly-speculative Internet stocks. The downside is the usual array of
small-cap risks: poor liquidity, lack of name recognition with individual
investors, and limited interest from Wall Street...at least, so far.

When we profiled Bel Fuse last August it was trading around $15. The company
had just announced a deal to buy Lucent's (NYSE:LU - news) signal transformer
business in August. The stock soared as high as $49.50 in March but has since
settled back to the $32 area. Small caps can sometimes languish in a tight
trading range for years, but Bel-Fuse shows they can also deliver a real
pulse-quickening ride on occasion.

Bel Fuse makes tiny magnetic components for computer networking equipment. It
is the primary supplier to 3Com (Nasdaq:COMS - news) . The signal transformer
business it bought from Lucent manufactures xDSL, ISDN, modem, broadband and
power magnetic components for original equipment manufacturers and Lucent
customers. The $30 million acquisition of this Lucent unit strengthens Bel
Fuse's position in the market for telecom gear and broadens its product line.
The company's strategy is to develop a full line of customer solutions,
including new telecom products, to better compete during the consolidation of
industry suppliers.

With $102 million in sales over the last year, Bel is a niche player in the
multi-billion dollar computer networking market, but the magnetic components
segment is estimated to be a $400 million market worldwide. The explosive
growth of networking (Internet access, corporate networks, etc) and Bel's close
relationship with 3Com have it dialed into a strong industry. The 50-year old
company also makes miniature and micro fuses, electrical converters and hybrid
circuits. Bel's products are used in telecommunications, automotive and
consumer electronics applications.

Last year Bel positioned itself for significant growth opportunities in the
telecom area by rolling out a line of DSL (digital subscriber lines)
standardized products. DSL is a high-speed data transfer technology that phone
and Internet communications companies are aggressively rolling out. America
Online (NYSE:AOL - news) has partnered with several Baby Bells to introduce DSL
access later this year.

The stock of Bel Fuse has shown sensitivity to the market for Local Area
Network (LAN) equipment, though its own networking component business has not
shown any signs of slowing. Nonetheless, the telecom equipment products help
diversify Bel's revenues and give it a second engine of growth.

In the first quarter of 1999 Bel Fuse posted a 73% increase in earnings, to
$0.95 per share, on a 58% gain in revenues. That brings trailing twelve-month
earnings to $3.28 per share, giving BELFA a P/E of less than 10. By comparison,
the S&P 500 has a P/E of 36. Earnings per share have grown on average 30%
annually over the past five years. There is only one brokerage firm covering
the stock right now, and that analyst projects earnings growth of 30% this year
and 20% over the long-term. The company has no debt and insiders own 20%.

With a market capitalization of $165 million, Bel Fuse is a tiny company in the
eyes of institutional investors. But the way to gain attention on Wall Street
is strong earnings growth and a rising stock price, so Bel Fuse seems to be
doing the things a small-cap needs to do if it hopes to show up on the radar
screen of the big investors.

Clayton is not a Buffet stock

First off, long-term ROE 17%? The last time it cleared 17% was back in
1990, and it was heavily leveraged. Its return on assets has been steadily in
the 10% range, and its return on capital over the last 5 years (which have been
"boom" years, if you call it that) is about 14%. The net income tells most of
the story. There's a minimal amortization/depreciation charge, making net
income a good to generous estimate of cash flow rather than a drastic
underestimation.

Moreover, its numbers simply reflect the industry. Its 5 year average ROC is
about the industry average, and its ROA suffers the same average fate. ROE is
below average if you adjust for debt. The rest of its numbers range but are
overall unremarkable except for very good margins.

I can see why CMH doesn't trade at 25 times earnings, and never will on any
consistent basis. That's not to say it's not undervalued. It will be around in
10 years. Is there a super-duper competitive advantage? Not really. It is
reflected in the efficiency numbers, but you get a hint of one in the profit
margins. But it trades at a PE not seen consistently since the last real estate
slump 89-91, and if a slump is not seen, the stock will simply have to move
forward. I see a great margin of safety in an undervalued stock, good for
12-15% annually long-term, maybe 20% from rock-bottom lows with good
management.

Personally, I see a lot better numbers, potential in Champion, but I'm very
biased there.

TwoBear,

No offense taken at all. I am well aware of the image problem that manufactured
housing has. Despite the image (which I think is exagerated), I don't think
it's an undesireable customer group to target.

So many of the housing companies now are showing incredible growth and the
market perception is that its got to reverse itself. Like auto makers at peak
earnings the multiples look cheap. Today I was looking at recent explosive
numbers for Toll Brothers and Beazer. Backlog for both is strong. I own
Champion and also like Jim's Clayton.

I've been reading "The Roaring 2000s" by Dent this week and the book lays out a
demographic case for strong economic growth for another decade based on the
spending habits of the various age groups in the population. He points out a
couple of housing segments that look particularly attractive. As baby boomers
enter the empty nest and retirement phase he expects to see demand for second
homes and retirement homes grow. Second, as all of the boomer kids begin
entering the housing market he sees increasing demand for starter homes. He
does see difficulty in the existing home market and expects appreciation of
homes in the suburbs to slow. This is based primarily on his view that people
are going to want to live and work where homes currently aren't. Communication
technology is expected to allow more people to live and work farther from the
cities, and the tax base of the suburbs is expected to erode. I don't know that
I buy it all, but certainly the demographic spending habits presented in the
book are persuasive in pointing to a strong economy for another decade.

That's because there's other owners who have a claim on the company - its

capital structures (i.e. different debt/equity ratios).

IMO, if you are going to be determined to use ROE of 16% despite the debt, no

OK, 16%. I didn't have the numbers in front of me when I was writing last

I had the privilege to spend an hour tonight with one of the fathers of value
investing, Francis Nicholson. In 1960, at Provident Capital in Philadelphia, he
published the first statistical study that showed that low P/E investing
produces above market returns. The man is 99 years old, and started his
investing career in 1923. His mind is as strong as my own, and he can still
race me up a flight of stairs. Everybody I know who has ever spent time with
this man admires him, and now I add myself to that list.

I will pass on to you three points of wisdom he gave me. When he retired from
Provident in 1965 (4 years before I was BORN!) he made a list of admonitions to
his analysts. Here are three of them. Print these out and put them on your
wall.

1) When you read a balance sheet or look at a company, ask yourself whether you
are seeing what is actually there or what you have been conditioned to see.
2) After you "finish" your analysis of a stock, specifically identify the
factor in your analysis which is the most likely factor to be wrong.
3) Remember that somebody is selling you the stock you are buying, or buying
the stock that you are selling. Before making the recommendation, be able to
state IN WORDS YOUR "OPPONENT" WOULD USE HIMSELF the case against your
position. (i.e. don't just say this is a no-brainer, anybody who would sell
this stock at this price is an idiot)

I pass that on not for debate, but just to pass on the words of a man who was
an investor in 1929. He is one of the few we have left who understand that
period of market history. And to anticipate the question he gets every day -
yes, he does think that today looks a lot like it did in 1929.

And as for Clayton's debt level, your post implied that ROE is

No, I simply meant that a 1/4 debt/equity ratio does make simple ROE
an inaccurate measure of profitability. 1% may be small, but 3-4%
isn't. Not if you're trying to compound the thing and make it like a
Buffett stock.

For Clayton (to get the numbers out in the open),

ROE D/E Avg PE Net Margin
1998 15.6 0.28 15.9 12.2
1997 15.8 0.03 15.3 12.3
1996 16.4 0.05 16.4 12.2
1995 16.0 0.09 13.4 11.5

1993 15.4 0.39 18.5 11.3
1992 13.4 0.66 16.7 10.6
1991 14.2 1.13 12.9 8.9
1990 18.4 1.64 9.2 7.6
1989 18.6 1.85 9.9 6.7

The industry average is ROE (5 year) 16.6. Clayton's ROC (5 year) is
14. The industry average is 14.1. Champion returns ROE (5 year) 25.6
and ROC (5 year) 22.0. Its margins don't measure up to Clayton's
superb numbers due to Clayton's higher-end focus, and they never will
since Champion is making the big retail push. For history buffs,
Champion has been around 30 years longer than Clayton and is indeed
the biggest manufacturer. The great results arrived with Mr. Young.
Obviously, to me, Champion is the screaming buy, as it appears cheaper
on PE and cash flow bases too. But we certainly do not have a 3
person consensus, and there is such a consensus on Clayton. So the
only way to solve this is to watch.

It looks as though Mr. Clayton will hand off the reins to his son.
Jim, how good is the son?

I value NOC on price to cash flow (by my def: earnings plus dep. and amort.)
This takes care of the goodwill stuff. There's more than one factor of course.
(I considered div. yield, buyout offer price.)

But I think you will find that p/cf is the key ratio analysts will use for LMT
also. JMO, and I defer to any experts on the thread; and please correct me if I
am wrong.

Arrgh. P/CF. I'm really looking forward to trying to figure out what percentage
of amortization and depreciation should really be added back, and what do net
working capital changes mean in a cyclical anyway? Actually, I'm burned out.
I've just spent the greater part of the day ping-ponging my brain on how to
handle goodwill and honestly I'm starting to not care. That's how I handled
operating leases. My last post for a few weeks - see you in July.

For what it is worth, I would be inclined to buy CHB over CMH, on slightly
different reasoning.

These companies tend to move as a group when they move. They have not moved for
a long time so the price relationship between the two (or FLE, or OH, for that
matter) has had a chance to adjust to true values (whatever that is). They are
all pretty good values and it is likely splitting hairs as to which one is
better. However, when they do move, I would want to own the perceived leader,
CHB.

As a corollary, I think the above suggests that we should perhaps be asking
ourselves different questions. Do we want to invest in the manufactured housing
industry now and if so why.

A friend of mine who is quite knowledgable on the industry had two comments --
interest rates and new capacity and too many dealers. The former affects
interest in buying the group, even if it does not affect fundamentals that
much. The latter affects margins. He is not pounding the table to put new money
into the industry.

Mike and all, I took a small position today in Azurix (AZX), an IPO spinoff
from Enron. AZX operates water & wastewater systems worldwide and plans on
being acquisitive. AZX becomes a US-based play on water utility consolidation
(Vivendi of France is another I have looked at but has no ADR).

If you look at AZX's S-1 filing you'll see Wessex (UK-based operation) incurred
a "one-time" windfall tax. It makes pro-forma earnings look much smaller than
the "true" run rate. If you take $19 IPO price / .78 proforma EPS, you get a
trailing PE of 24, which is sky-high. However, if you add back the $162M
windfall tax, PE suddenly becomes 10-11! The prospectus I believe says UK govt
would have to enact further legislation to levy another windfall tax. While I
won't bet my life the House of Lords won't exact another pound (I mean kilo :-)
of flesh from Wessex sometime in the future, this should not be factored in as
an annual event.

I think an eventual PE of 18 or so, in line with other acquisitive water
utilities such as AWK or PSC is not unreasonable. I have no idea where this
will go short term, so I took a small position at 19 7/16 and will leg into a
full position if this moves lower short term. Seems like a rare true-value IPO
right out of the chute.

I believe what hurts Clayton and the other major players is that their are too
many players in this field. Here alone, there is Clayton, Oakwood, Freedom,
A-Plus, Luv, and at least four or five more that I don't remember the names.
Evidently the barriers to entry are not to large. But, you would think that in
a recession that the smaller players might get shaken out. Maybe that could be
the catalyst for Clayton, Champion, etc. Recession, smaller players get shaken
out, market improves, big players monopolize on the smaller players former

Thanks for the reply on cmm. News release you cited was one that piqued my
curiosity. After reviewing the investor package I took a blind faith leap and
bought a few shares. The company IR person said that no analyst was following
company. Wish there was another thread that followed these situations. To me,
value is simply an investment opportunity where reward exceeds limited risk
based on quantifiable analysis. Mike Burry started a thread on arbitrage and
the postings are scant. Also if one reads some of the options threads the posts
are predominantly high risk, high reward situations even though there are many
moderate risk opportunities in this area. So I find myself returning to this
thread where the thinking is solid and the situations fit my lower risk
tolerance profile. If anyone knows of other threads where one can discuss
reorganizations, mergers,covered calls or naked puts,but with emphasis on
value, I would appreciate knowing about them.

Allen: CMM has, as you're probably aware, a Yahoo thread with 1500 posts on
it....I know it's like panning for gold, but there are usually at least a few
substantive commenters on those threads. The IR may not be aware of it, but I
suspect many non-traditional analysts like George Putnam are following CMM, but
you have to buy his newsletter to get that. Here's some $$$ infor:
http://www.bankruptcydata.com/brdsDispCoReports.asp?Task=ListReports&Company=Cr
imi+Mae%2C+Inc%2E
Here's an indication of how CMM got into this pickle:
<<In the interview Whitman, who has been known for years on Wall Street as a
canny value investor, said the CRIIMI MAE bankruptcy is a powerful argument for
rewriting some accounting rules.

He said that although the company had sufficient cash flow to cover its debts,
so-called "mark to market" pricing for securitized mortgages in its portfolio
led to a crippling margin call when bids for this kind of paper disappeared in
the aftermath of the Russian default.

Whitman said it makes more sense to carry performing loans on the balance sheet
at amortized cost, rather than having the value based on the daily price
fluctuations. >>
I have no indication whether Whitman is currently active in CMM.

I haven't decided to devote enough attention to distressed/ bankruptcy
investing to start a thread on it. Favoring this approach you have the idea
that change causes holders to bail and take the tax loss rather than hold and
wait for a favorable outcome. Also bond holders are rarely thrilled to be
converted to common holders. These motivated sellers may created a buying
opportunity. On the other side, you have rapid deterioration in asset values
[fire sale] that can outrun even the most negative sentiment. Also distressed,
post filing investing is mostly about bonds...reading bond covenents isn't my
cup of tea. Outside investors are at significant disadvantage to insiders that
control the negotiating agenda and can justify hiring legal and expert help.
The last issue is time...these things can take years to resolve, so time value
of money considerations must be weighed. I'm not rejecting the idea, but am
viewing distressed investing as a back burner project at this time.
Much of the above doesn't appear to apply to CMM, though, since it looks like
the common is on high ground. Based on the Whitman quote, I would wager that
the mortgages rebounded from bidless lows and are now viable assets.

Bob, thank you for posting those Graham lectures. Anybody who hasn't read them
should - they're not that long. I have read Graham's books, but I attended
Columbia 20 years too late to have him as a teacher. These lectures brought me
closer to that, and made me understand more deeply his impact on Warren
Buffett. That his ideas have been nearly forgotten in this market, even by
people who call themselves value investors, makes him all the more relevant.

The point that comes through loud and clear is that Graham would be virtually
out of stocks today. He doesn't think of that as market timing, but as common
sense. I am only interested in discussing that with people who have read the

I guess we'll find out what happens with manufactured housing going forward.
Some in the industry will crash and burn because of bad financing deals. There
does seem to be concern over excess inventory in the pipeline, but in the end
I'm optimistic for the economy and can see the economic expansion continuing to
allow Champion and others to get their share.

I expect 1) somewhat predictable margins going forward. 2) continued economic
expansion and increased revenues, and 3) at least flat or increasing multiples.
In other words, the downside appears limited given my outlook, and multiple
expansion is not out of the question.

George Soros wrote about the idea of "reflexivity". This is when what drives
the price is related to the price itself. For example, a company that has a
high stock price (but a low return on capital) and issues shares to acquire
businesses. This can go on for a while, but when the stock price drops, game
over. These generally don't bounce back. The REITs in the summer of 1997 were a
classic example of this idea - but they were safer because they had a natural
bottom - they did have real asset value.

Companies booking a large percentage of their earnings off their pension fund
might be another example.

What you are looking for here is a potential death spiral. The stock price
drops, eliminating growth opportunites, lowering earnings, which causes the
stock price to drop more... Once these start to drop in a market downturn, stay
far away.

receivables. Well those chickens have come home to roost big time and after the
negative earnings announcement DACG now trades a bit above 5. I listened to

rest of year...probably about .25 for 99. But things should look much better in
2000. Prior to announcement they were expected to earn 1.00 and 1.27 for 99 and
2000 respectively with an expected 5 year growth of 27%. Forget about 99 and
discount the 2000 and growth by 25% for optimistic indication.
My reason for buying: Fast forward one year to mid 2000. DACG is on track to
earn about $1 per share with 20% growth rate going forward and trades at $20
plus in recognition of this. That's the upside.
The downside...lot's of "buying opportunities" may yet be seen as y2k delays

[GM's Internet Strategy (cont.)]

"AOL Fills A Gap With Hughes Satellite Deal"

By Nicole Volpe -- Monday June 21 4:44 PM ET

NEW YORK (Reuters) - America Online Inc. (NYSE:AOL -
news), the leading online service provider, Monday said
it would make a $1.5 billion investment in Hughes Electronics Corp.,
the owner of DirecTV, giving AOL a means to offer high-speed Internet
services via satellite nationwide.

The investment in Hughes, a satellite communications company that
offers digital TV and Internet access, represents the largest cash
investment ever made by AOL, officials said.

AOL Chief Executive Steve Case said the partnership would allow AOL to
offer high-speed Internet access to the one-third of U.S. households,
mostly in rural areas, that will not be wired for high-speed cable or
phone lines by the year 2003.

''What this alliance does is give us a national footprint for
high-speed Internet access,'' Case said in a telephone interview.
''Even if we had deals with all of the cable providers and telephone
companies -- and we don't -- we would not have this national reach,''
he said.

AOL and other Internet companies have complained to regulators that
cable companies are locking them out of their market by bundling
online access and other services into a single price.

AOL, along with other Internet companies, has complained to regulators
that cable companies are locking them out of their market to broadband
cable customers by bundling access and services provided by companies
into a single price.

Many analysts forecast that most U.S. consumers will use cable
television links to receive fast Internet connections versus
high-speed phone lines and to a lesser degree, satellites.

AT&T Corp. (NYSE:T - news), the emerging powerhouse of the U.S. cable
industry, requires customers who want high-speed Internet access to
purchase the services of AtHome Corp., a cable-owned provider
controlled by AT&T, for a single price.

''It is clear that by going to satellites, AOL is trying to cover its
distribution bases,'' said Gary Arlen, president of Arlen
Communications. ''It certainly makes it a race between satellites,
phone wire and cable access.''

Arlen said he estimated some 2 million to 5 million AOL subscribers
could be satellite customers by 2003. AOL counts 17 million
subscribers to its flagship AOL service and another 2 million to
CompuServe, and millions more to Web-based services.

Hughes Electronics Chief Executive Mike Smith said in a conference
call with reporters that the so-called ''AOL-Plus'' high-speed service
would be offered as part of Hughes' DirecPC service, which currently
counts 100,000 customers.

''We have not promoted DirecPC due to financial constraints,'' said
Smith, adding that the AOL brand name and investment will help
immensely.

''This is a way for DirecTV to catch up with cable,'' said Armand
Musey, a satellite communications analyst at Banc of America
Securities in New York.

''It's a race for the middle ground, as satellite TV is trying to
upgrade and cable trying to roll out as fast as possible,'' he said.

The AOL-Hughes alliance builds on an earlier deal, announced in May,
under which the companies will develop a ''combination'' set-top
receiver to make DirecTV/AOL TV available to consumers next year.

''We're interested in this idea of 'AOL Everywhere,' extending
services across all broadband technologies,'' Case said.

Case described ''a highly connected society'' in which AOL services
could be accessed through television and other household appliances,
as well as handheld devices and computers.

''If you are watching the Super Bowl, you can then access a sports
site, or pull up your buddy list to start a chat about the game or
access your e-mail during a commercial,'' he said.

Separately, Hughes struck a deal with Intel Corp. (Nasdaq:INTC -
news), the leading maker of computer chips, for Intel to supply chip
technology for use in Hughes set-top boxes used to convert satellite
signals. The first of these products will be the AOL TV satellite
receiver. Terms were not disclosed.

AOL's stock, the New York Stock Exchange's most active issue, was up
$1.88 to $115.31 late Monday afternoon. Hughes, a separately traded
unit of General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM - news), was up $2.31 at $55.75.
GM added $1.06 to trade at $63.94. On the Nasdaq, Intel was $1.875
higher at $56.81.

buying back shares like crazy until they inexplicably decided to spend a
billion on a Hughes equity infusion. (Hmm, we could buy back our own stock at 5
times earnings or we could buy Hughes stock at 90 times earnings. OR, we could
sell Hughes to the public at 90 times earnings and use the proceeds to buy our
own stock at 5 times earnings. Out of that menu they picked the worst choice.
How could management of a company the size of GM in 1999 still be so stupid?)
GM's CEO opposes a spin-off of Hughes though it makes eminent sense. He may be
gone in a year, then the deal gets done and GM goes to 90. I consider GM's
price an incredible bargain even for GM, which I regard as an awful company.
Does anybody here own GM?

re. mobile home builders: I compared CAV, CHB and CMH, and found that I liked
the valuation for the whole sector, and of the three stocks I actually chose to
buy CMH.

This mobile home building business does look like a good choice for a
beaten-down value sector. The p/e ratios for the three stocks are near the
bottom of their 5-year range. Getting a stock with 15% growth rates at a
trailing p/e of 11 is pretty decent nowadays.

CHB is the largest by market cap. However, it has a negative net tangible
assets and its cash flow from operations was negative in the last quarter. I
don't like to see negative numbers like those.

Revenues and earnings for CAV are more erratic, year to year, than for CHB and
CMH.

So this left me with CMH, which had a nice looking balance sheet and consistent
quarterly results, as my favorite of the three.

Maybe the choice doesn't really matter, since it looks like the charts for the
3 are highly correlated. Especially CHB and CMH.

DACG peer group: The closest I could come to a peer group isn't really close at
all
http://biz.yahoo.com/research/indgrp/comp_services.html
I haven't found a direct competitor [Ford vs GM like] in the ERP training space
that's publicly traded. This doesn't mean they lack competition. From the K
"Principal competitors for the Company's services include the consulting
practices of the large international accounting firms, the in-house service
units of the ERP vendors, the professional services groups of many large
technology and management consulting companies, and smaller niche service
providers"
I did a net search [ERP SAP consulting training] and came up with private
companies and big 6 sub-groups, but not eye-to-eye listed equivalents. For
financial comparison purposes, some of the computer service companies in the
yahoo link above may work.
One source of future competition would be the y2k remediation companies as they
come face to face the the dreaded year 2001 problem: "What the hell do we do
now?" ERP consulting, because of the post 2000 growth potential, might be on
their brainstorm list. All they gotta do is get a bunch of Cobol geeks to learn
SAP and how to train people on it....wait maybe that's not such a big hairy
threat after all. In fact, they may be a source of employees and put downward
pressure on labor cost for DACG.
On the conference call, DACG management responded to several analyst questions
about the extent that competitive pressure or pricing might be eroding their
business. The consistent response was that they weren't losing or missing the
deals, the deals were being delayed because of y2k concerns....the pipeline is
good and continues to fill with pending projects, but implementation is
stretched out. Fortune 500 companies that are big part of DACG's biz, are,
according to DACG, becoming more apprehensive about y2k troubles and the IT
departments don't want to fight 2 wars at the same time. It rang true to me,
but I've been snookered before. Anyway, the optimistic scenario is that they go
into 2000 with a backlog of delayed activity that, when implemented, provides
boffo comparisons with this years saggy numbers.
One of aspects of their financials that troubles me is the unbilled
receivables. Apparently it's a not uncommon practice in the software biz, but
it's still weird. From the K "Unbilled revenue represents the revenue earned in
excess of amounts billed" Huh? This is the kinda thing I look for in a good
short and one the reasons I had no interest in DACG at 11 - 12. But at 5 - 6,
I'm overlooking it if it doesn't get bigger.

Thanks for your interest and comments,

you've got to worry about a catalyst.)

The largest stock in this sector, CHB, has a market cap of $1 B despite getting
pounded down, and 9 analysts give it estimates.

When you've got that much analyst coverage, you can expect that eventually a
good business will get the attention it deserves. If you insist on getting a

Manufactured housing - Oakwood just announced an earnings disappointment, but
then management turned around and said they're thinking of buying the whole
company themselves its so cheap. That's bad news to a Wall Street analyst, but
good news if you are a stockholder of another company in the sector and have a
working brain. Oakwood is the perenial dog of the industry - just because they
disappoint doesn't mean Clayton and Champion do, but this quarter is a little
treacherous due to high inventories at retail. We know, however, that

James,

GM does look like a very big bargain. I had several problems with it the last
time I looked closely at a 10K though. (I think about a year ago)

1. Enormous post retirement liabilities that will have "hard to know" effects
on true free cash flow down the line.

2. Underfunded pensions.

3. US consumption is booming almost like never before and now represents its
highest percentage of US GDP ever. My guess is that with the savings rate
negative, extremely high consumer debt levels,
and the fullest employment in decades, US consumption levels are very
vulnerable.

I wouldn't trust the surface numbers nor the current earnings levels.

That said, on a relative basis it's still cheap. But that's because I think
most blue chip prices are nutso!

Government Stats

I generally don't pay much attention to government statistics when I invest,
but I read a few interesting things recently that I thought I'd pass along.

The Richebacher Letter, a sample newsletter I came across, and a recent report
I read all independently studied the GDP, productivity, and other recent
government figures and made an excellent case that GDP growth is not nearly as
rapid in dollar terms as stated.

This is due to certain estimates of computer power increases that get added to
it in dollar terms but have little to do with the actual dollars of GDP.

Some of it is beyond my expertise and I'm not so sure how relevant it is for
the investors that frequent this thread, but all three think that the figures
are highly suspect and come to the conclusion that GDP growth is not as rapid
as stated and productivity is not as high as stated.

One of the three said that the government is aware of the problem.

If I find the one online report I'll post it.

A couple of years ago GM's underfunding of pensions was in the magnitude of
$10B as I recall. One of the reasons I stayed away at the time. Recent article
in the Economist reviewed how many S&P 500 companies were significantly adding
to current profits because their pension funds were getting overfunded, and
they have a way of getting the excess out. But I don't suppose this is cause
for investors to worry. If the market crashes and the funds get underfunded
again, it's the taxpayer who will be forced to bail the funds out. Another
example of corporate welfare.

I have owned ALSC from about 3 3/16. I believed I mentioned it at that time on
the thread. I took some profits at 6 1/16. If you take the time to read the
news relating to ALSC, and the thread , you will find that many positive
developments have taken place since it was at those low levels-

1. The company has many investments in private companies that were not
reflected in its share price:

a/ Broadcom a public high flyer purchased one of those company's for stock
worth around $60MM to ALSC.

b/ UMC a taiwanese foundry has announced that it will merge four privately held
companies into it in exchange for stock worth over $500MM to ALSC at today's
value. ( I have not verified, simply going by a news release).

c/ I have read that ALSC actual business is improving and several new products
have merit.

It appears to me that the intrinsic worth of ALSC continues to be significantly
higher than its market cap and if you are interested in the high tech small cap
area this type of company is worth doing dilligence despite the sharp rise in
its share value.

I am not as familiar with SIII and TRID. But I purchased TRID recently
at $9.5 based on a good sized cash position and the recommendation of Al FRank
of the prudent speculator, whose opinion I value and who also likes ALSC.

I have also recently purchased MALL at $6.5, which is up strongly today based
on a report filed with the SEC that indicated book value is around $6.50 per
share, though some of that is from a recently spun off subsidiary UBID.

Hi Paul,

I own Alcatel in one of my accounts. I also had business dealings with them
going back to 1985. IMHO Alcatel's problems are poor management and lousy
french business environment. They compete with Lucent, Siemens, Northern
Telecom, Ericsson etc with a very broad product line. I do not expect them to
be a market leader in any one telecom product group and they are a high cost
manufacturer. For years they were kind of equipment manufacturing arm of France
Telecom. All that changed in 1986 with Alcatel buying ITT's Telecom business in
Europe. They do have a large presence in Asia including China which may pay off
some day?

I have traded ALA twice buying below 20 and selling above 25. This time I am
still holding a small position hoping it go over 30.

Yep I'm back in les etats-unis. Oracle has done very well indeed as has

Deswell, National RV, and Champion take a dump. So the net is that I'm much
better than I would've been without Oracle, but only a little better off than
when I left.

National RV in particular I can't figure out. That one, like Anchor Gaming,
seems very very volatile. It's dropping hard, but it seems to have such a good
story. I'm looking for someone to punch holes in that one for me. Tell me where
I'm wrong! Champion is plummeting on high volume too. National RV and Champion
have similar stories (pros/cons) to me, and I hold both. If they turn out very
badly, I'll have learned a very valuable lesson, and that will be stay away
from booming cyclicals no matter management. It's one of those cases where it
seems I'll have to burn a hole in my own pocketbook to really take the lesson
home.

After experiencing Europe's version of the internet as well as Europe's version

Varian Medical Update: (VAR) Well, it is up around 43% since I first brought it
to the board and seems to be doing well. I'm not sure as to what to attribute
the runup to but I spoke with a rep the other day and for the first time in
years they don't have a linear accelerator in production that is not accounted
for. Usually there are a few that are in a holding pattern due to a facility
not ready for installation or the health system has opted out of a purchase
contract due to various reasons.

On the other hand, I just cut a P.O. to the competition for a peripheral
product, a Radiation Oncology specific Information System. From my research,
VAR is having some minor reliability problems with their system. I did learn
that they have shipped more ROIS's than the competition this year. What that
says, with an inferior product, is that they offer good package deals with new
linacs. And that, is were they hold a decided advantage over the competition.

All things considered, I still believe they are strategically positioned to
dominate the Radiation Oncology capital equipment market.

Another one I am seriously considering is ADAC, currently (ADACE). This company
is a market leader in Nuclear Medicine equipment and Radiation Therapy Planning
Systems, but continuously keep shooting themselves in the foot with crappy
accounting practices. They have had to restate earnings again. But, on the flip
side, they are announcing several large contracts on the NM and RTP side. On
the surface, their numbers look good on a valuation perspective, but I'm not
good enough yet to sort through this restatement mess. I do know that they have
great products, especially a new gamma camera that simulates as an expensive

I'm coming in on the middle of this conversation so I'm not sure if I'm
covering old ground. Sorry if I am.

If you like Florida real estate I suggest you look at Alico (ALCO). They own a
ton of real estate on the west coast, mostly in Ft Meyers. Ft Meyers is booming
and a very nice town.

Some of the land is farm, grazing and other such stuff but some is developable.
They donated some to the state of FL a few years back to develop a university
on (its done now) and they own a lot of the surrounding land. I read a report a
while back that said the land assets are worth much much more than the market
price of the stock.

The key is when/if they will sell so the market price might adjust. I don't own
any because it's not my style of company but I occasionally still think about
doing a better research job and taking a position. I'm fairly certain the value
is there. I just don't know how much. Good Luck.
