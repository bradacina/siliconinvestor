Supervalu appoints Wal-Mart leaders as its CEO
Grocer Supervalu appoints Wal-Mart executive Herkert as CEO
Wednesday May 6, 2009, 1:50 pm EDT
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Supervalu-appoints-WalMart-apf-15152852.html?.v=4

From the article:"...At Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Herkert has served as president
and CEO of its Americas region since 2004. Before Wal-Mart, he worked with
American Stores and Albertsons companies, as well as other grocers...."
----------------------------------------------------------------

Should be long term positive for the company. The stores cherry picked from the
recent Albertson's purchase now have a good manager to make these properties
more profitable. As the company whittles down their debt, more value should
accrue to the common stock.

CT is definitely a tough one to figure. They had to take book value down to
$14.46 a share after this report, but somehow I feel there is a happy medium
between current book and current price that will be higher than it is
currently. Sell offs on the release of a report often are knee jerk reactions,
and after things are considered in detail, the market frequently has second

AMJ. Can't find any info about it and its holdings at the JPMorgan website.

When I last looked at several of the lp etf's, they often had many lp's in
common, although the weighting were different. E.g. KYN and TYN with Kinder
Morgan, Plains All American, and so on. Important points for me in buying an
mlp etf were not so much the holdings themselves (since so many were common
among the etfs) but rather, the fund fees (which vary among the funds) and
which mlp etfs were trading above or below nav and by how much.

AMJ: not sure what it is exactly. May be an etn, not an etf. I'm not sure I
understand the difference. In an etf, the fund holds shares in the underlying
lp's. With an etn, the company, here JPMorgan, issues a note which promises to
pay out and/or track AMJ to an lp index. If that is about the right difference,
for me, I'm not one be interested in buying AMJ because I'm not one to accept
promises from JPMorgan -g-.

Nice trade on OCNF. I took a little off as well, figuring the gap between 1.46
and 1.52 may fill. I see the last YA Global 424b at 1.63, so that's
encouraging.

As far as FCH preferred, I think more bang for buck on the common. No dividends
anyway on preferred, but divs are not my focus and I rarely look at the
preferred. 3 months is a long time to wait for a dividend and in 3 month
periods, anything can happen. So long term investments on the idea of
collecting a dividend every 3 months is not my focus. With so much else on my
plate, I just can't study every aspect of the market and choose to focus on
serious undervaluation in common stocks.

BTW, my value watch list has been reduced from 503 stocks to 425, due to many
reaching above tangible book now. That's 15% less stocks I have to follow
closely. Although I do keep an eye on the ones that have gone from serious
undervaluation to overvaluation during the rally.

AMJ: "Since the MLP stocks in this ETN is held by JP Morgan". I don't know that

note, a promise to pay. Until somebody corrects me, I believe ETN's compared to
ETF's have additional risk: the credit risk of the issuer. I don't know why I
should take that risk or why AMJ would be better than something like TYN, the

re CNP -
I checked on this one finally. What is interesting about CNP is that it's a
pure transmission play - CNP does not own power generating plants any more. The
growth seem to come from the NG pipeline operation. I was surprised to see that
the biggest segment - electric transmission had shrinking earnings for quite a
few years - out of luck with the regulators? Texas can be a tough state for
regulated business.

-a38b-5cb4405a2ad6/AGA_presentation_Final3.pdf

Valuation seems OK with 7x EBITDA, but it seems that the high debt load and
unfavorable regulation are major negatives. I'd be concerned about a dividend
cut if I owned this stock.

FWIW - have you looked at AEP. lot's to coal but cost passtrough should negate
cap and trade cost increases, i think. They have the most transmission assets
of all utilities.
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:5/8/2009 3:10:03 AM
From:E_K_S
Thanks for your opinion on CNP. I was looking at it again today and was a bit
concerned by their large "transition" debt too. I believe the worse traunch of
debt was rated BBB+ and the others were AAA (
http://investors.centerpointenergy.com/bond.cfm ).

I could not identify any preferred series so all of their financing is done
with the transition bond companies. Bonds are long term and were financed in
2001 with no need for any refinance in the near future.

My long term view on the NG market, specifically pipeline consolidators and
distribution channels is very positive. In 10-15 years I believe there will be
a transition to fueling cars and trucks with NG partially due to overwhelming
cap & trade taxes. The cost per BTU of NG compared to gasoline is about 55%
less. One gallon of gasoline is about $2.50 while the equivalent amount of BTUs
of NG is about $1.35. Clean NG will fuel more electric power plants too.

So that's my premiss for the investment. I already own NG pipelines in Canada
and in the mid-west but nothing in the south.

I noticed that the stock sold as low as $5.00/share in 2003. I am not too sure
that they can maintain their high dividend and meet their growth projections.
Their dividend has doubled since 2003 but was slashed 70% six months earlier in
2002 from $0.37/qtr to $0.10/qtr. Currently they pay $0.19/qtr. So they do have
a history of cutting their dividend.

I might nibble at a few shares for a starter position if it breaks $10/share.
The stock goes xdividend next week (5/13/2009) at $0.19/share.

I will have to look at AEP but I am trying to stay with my NG theme as it
appears to be the one commodity that is really on sale now.

T.G.I. Friday's: Snake head wasn't cooked

CLIFTON PARK, N.Y.
T.G.I. Friday's says a severed snake head found in a dish of broccoli at one of
its upstate New York restaurants was apparently planted in the meal.

Company spokeswoman Amy Freshwater said Friday independent laboratory tests
confirmed the snake head was added to cooked broccoli at its Clifton Park
restaurant. The Carrollton, Texas, company has asked state police to
investigate.

Diner Jack Pendleton of Ballston Lake says he found the snake head on Sunday.

Freshwater says the company doesn't know who put the head in the meal.
Pendleton says he didn't.

Pendleton says that after he e-mailed a cell phone photo of the head to his
friends, one of them posted it on a consumer complaint Web site. Pendleton has
said he has no plans to sue.

Looks OK to me. Surprised at healthcare in general but I suppose I shouldn't be
as the powers that be are encouraging more risk taking and less defensive
stocks.

On another note my OLP has now usurped my DFT position which was my largest. I
like OLP alot because they are not losing money but making good money. In
addition it sells at a 65% discount to the value of its assets. So dips haven't
shaken me, and I believe dips are opportunities. Based on the chart, I think
this is going higher. Key is when to enter a trading position, but if and when
it offers up an opportunity, this is a good one with alot of upside imo.

With regards to CT, this one I think requires some nerves of steel and a
stomach made of iron being that the low priced issues like this are subject to
30% daily swings.
But the bottom line is that it's got a tangible book value of $14.66 a share
after, and that's after this last report which saw them lose $3.28 a share. I
doubt we will get those types of large loan loss reserves again, and there were
alot of one time refinancing of debt expense charges. It's a gamble but I see a
couple of positives, mainly its too cheap.

My hunch is that the stock down near all time lows tends to act that way to
shake the last of the mohicans out before it makes a move. So I've been hanging
on and trying to develop a tough skin to the daily gyrations. I had too much
though and let some go profitably. Somewhere between the tangible net worth and
the actual price where it is, there has to be a higher happier median. There is
just to big a spread between what its worth and what it sells for. Even if they
report more losses they would have to lose another $13 per share to justify
this price and I think that's unlikely.

A few more thoughts I've been pondering in the wee hours of the night when its
quiet and I can focus. That doesn't make my perceptions correct, but what the
heck, we gotta start somewhere with a thought before we get proven wrong.

BDN peaks my interest on a dip. I've never owned it but if she dips I may try
some. Tangible value is $18 a share, again a good discount. Very small loss
this past qtr. But estimates are for them to have good earnings this year and
next. They only lost 3 cents in Q1 2009.

NGPC, my sense is that Book value is 11.23 and it still has some room to go up.
But not alot more in it and I took 1/2 of my position off at 8.19. May be
another 1 or 2 bucks in it.

NSIT looks like a good value to me. Book is $8.50 and estimates are for decent
earnings. In fact they report on Tuesday so it could be very volatile both
before and after. My hunch is that watch Monday early and if it looks stable to
up , worth a try but need to get out before report on Tuesday. Might be a
trade.

LAD has a book value of $10, so still a nice discount to fair value. And it
appears that financial income is poised to improve. A little short term
extended here but dips can still be bought imo. It seems the unlikely scenarios
in this market, are the ones that work. Auto Dealerships - who the hell would
want to buy auto dealerships? Yet it goes up.

DFT is still seriously undervalued, but analyst downgraded it to market
perform. I think undervalued by 50%. Good business and Co. really seems to be
gearing up for high performance in 2010.

Most stocks go from serious undervalation to at least mild overvaluation in
bear market rallies of this nature.

MPW still undervalued and has earnings. Should be worth at least 7-8 a share.
Not a particularly volatile stock though.

PNSN is OK, but it's run alot already and no longer the big value that it was.
Could go higher and technical indications are good, but at this point its
fairly valued so I won't chase it , except maybe for a nimble day trade on the
right day.

SKS I'm not inclined to fool with until it drops back down some. Tangible book
is $6.82, but Co is losing money by the pound still. I'd keep on watch, not
chase it, and re buy when it corrects some of the advance.

NM still looks good to me. Not the value it was before, but a few positives are
that several big investors have taken sizable positions including FMR (
Fidelity).

ALY looks like a good value at these levels and I may look for a spot.

OCNF Annual shareholder meeting soon, so hopefully we'll know a little more
about what's going on there.

Market probably goes up monday, but I feel like we are getting closer to a
correction of substance and therefore maybe best not to chase things to much
here. The dip is the time to focus on the buys in the value stocks. Even if
they run up a little more, I think we still need to be careful and should not
abandon that stance to chase a hyped up market.

CT. I like this tactic also of buying the stocks which at their prices are like
perpetual call options. CT, maybe is still one.

If I multiply your reported tbv of $14.66/sh. x 21M sh out., that's about
$308M. If I use CT's debt, $2.1B per Yahoo, and assume that that's all the
further debt that's subject to possible write-off, (i.e no off balance-sheet
obligations), then worst-case as much as 15% roughly of the debt (i.e $315M)
would have to be written off before tbv evaporates. Not that that would
necessarily mean bk for CT, but it would reduce any (most?) margin of safety
that I would see. I suspect 15% write-off is possible, maybe not probable
though. Who knows?

Auto dealerships: "Auto Dealerships - who the hell would want to buy auto
dealerships?" Up until the past eight months, they have been very profitable
for their owners. Most profits come from service, major repairs (e.g. if they
have collision shops), and esp. used-car sales. I believe many people wrongly
presume it's new car sales where they make their profits. If people are keeping
their cars longer to reduce their household debt, then used-car sales will not
grow, and that could hurt the dealerships

I'm out of the dealerships now, still following them on a watch list though -
Penske, ABG, LAD, etc. Right now, I'm going with the loan companies, i.e. ACF.

A good deal of the car dealers profits comes from the service business, which
has a 50% gross margin, next comes used car sales and finally new cars.

I think the service business is destined to go downhill too with lower new car
sales. Why bring your five year old car to a dealers shop when independents
shops hourly rate is 30% less and service often fairer?

Used car sales have an unbeatable competitor: Craigslist. Cost is zero. In fact
most car dealers nowadays advertise their cars in Craigslist as well because
that is where people are looking. We sold and bought my wives car at craigslist
and saved about 20% from dealers prices and know the guy who drove the care
before which in some cases is comforting (in other cases not).

With used-cars at dealers you get off-lease cars, the cpo (certified
pre-owned)cars, and a source of financing. Lots of cars have very sophisticated
electronics and sensors and stuff which means it can be very expensive for the
independent shops to have the necessary diagnostic tools and skills to find and
fix problems.

It may be so that the service business will decline over time. It might or
might not be because independent shops will be taking an ever larger bite from
the dealers. It might be because cars are getting more and more reliable and so
have fewer problems. Of course, the offset is that the longer people keep their
cars on the road, the more likely repair issues occur.

Consider new car dealerships. Imo, up until last year anyway, if you went into
any community and tried to determine who the wealthiest people were, you would
find the owners of car dealerships to be right up there, if not at the top. A
lucrative business it has been (in the past anyway).

You are right that the car dealer won't go out of business, but they will have
less business. The larger repair shops have the diagonstic tools as well,
doesn't seem to be a problem but i do give you that they still struggle with
hybrids etc.

Maybe I am biased but my first and only dealings with a car dealer when i
arrived in this country was dreadful, so I decided I am not going to set a foot
into their salesroom or shop again. I think may people feel the same. I do not
think that car dealerships will go out of business, i just think they will have
a smaller and smaller piece of the shrinking pie long term. Short term the "
cash for clunker" program (if it passes) may provide a nice boost. Too bad my

These dink Chinese stocks could be pretty good value buys.

There are many of them, and so having a few, rather than one or two, might be a
prudent way to play these.

Nice near triple for you with CHFI, if you bought near lows on Monday and held.

Away from Chinese microcaps there've been recent discussions here on several
preferred stocks and several utility stocks and food and grocery stocks.

===
I plan to keep PG and other consumer staples for at least a while. I have
canceled many open gtc buy orders as stocks have moved up, and consequently
where they seem too far away from my bid price. I am holding an open order to
buy more PG though, in case the stock should fall back to around $48.5 (down
from Fri's $51.57)

I am still holding http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NWL which you and I have talked
about. I liked it under $20 and bought. Too bad I didn't like it enough at
$4-$5 to have added.

I have some FCH also. I had initially bought AHT around 5-7 in 2008, and then
exchanged some AMAT and OC into more AHT, some FCH, and more MCGC in early
January.

So, I had effectively doubled-down on AHT. Now that it's up in the high 3's, I
wanted to diversify a bit into another REIT, and after looking around, sold
half my AHT and put it into SPPR, which is a budget motel/hotel chain. In
theory, I think SPPR would be more relatively recession-resistant, but it
hasn't bounced from its lows as much as other hotel REITS. I considered BEE
also, but I'm not sure I have enough of a handle on that one to put shares into
it.

Tricky market out there, especially in REITS.

Reviewed my position in TYN vis-a-vis other mlp etn's with which I'm familiar.
I'm adding a few shares, fwiw. Although the price has moved up up from lows,
the etf still has its attractions (for me). Positives are the distribution
yield, currently about 10% (depending on how one calculates it), and this etf's
underlying positions which I am interested in - ETP EEP, KMP (these discussed
here by Spekulatius, et. al.), Linn Energy, others.

I hadn't seen before that TYN has a deferred tax asset (a liability) of
$1.33/sh. which is included in nav. That should be considered in evaluating the
price:nav ratio. Relatively, I assume that since competitor mlp etf's seem to
hold many of the same stocks, in different proportions of course, that these
other etf's also have a deferred tax asset component.

Hello Paul,

I hadn't considered the preferred, but it appears that strong gains could have
been had!

I still like FCH and AHT, but SPPR interests me because:

1) Its hotels seem to be priced more in the $1M to $5M range, which would seem
to me to be easier to refinance or sell in this market.

2) RevPar dipped only 7-8% whereas other REITs are dipping 17%. SPPR has been
able to keep its daily prices the same but occupancy has dipped and caused the
RevPar to dip a bit also. But signicantly less than upper scale hotels which
are experiencing occupancy dips along with having to drop prices.

Overall, I still think all three companies are doing a good job of refinancing
and pushing off bankruptcy risk a few years, and therefore have a good
risk/return when the economy recovers. But, if AHT and FCH run up another
50-100% from here in the short-term, I will be taking my gains on the way up.

Thanks,

cw

From:RRICH4
more detail ARSD South Hampton refining has undertaken an expansion of their
petrochemical processing capacity. This expansion is now complete and is fully
operational. The increase in capacity will likely be closer to 115% from what
it was before the expansion. Currently, we estimate that South Hampton is
utilizing between 15-20% of this extra capacity within the first month and we
believe that figure will slowly grow as the year progresses. Barring a complete
collapse of the economic environment both nationally and internationally, we
feel the majority of this capacity will be utilized during the next 30 months.

Feedstock pricing has been all over the board this year and there is no doubt
that will have an impact on the next quarter or two of headline profits. In
early February, in the year, while feedstock pricing went through the roof,
South Hampton hedged out approximately 30% of their feedstock costs essentially
for the balance of the year. Further, they were able to pass along the price
increases throughout the year to their customers. As feedstock prices continued
up in an unprecedented manner those hedges became significantly in the money.
That has now reversed of course…but the Company has been slow to lower prices.
In the short run, this activity has an impact to profits but as we look over
the long term their hedging activity typically washes out. If oil prices
continue to collapse ARSD’s hedging loss will be a meaningful number, but
likely offset by the strong profitability from being slow to reduce prices.
With this type of program, obviously margins are impacted on a quarter to
quarter basis, we feel that in properly valuing a company like South Hampton,
there are normalized margins available. Quarterly earnings may be lumpy, but
going forward there shouldn’t be any significant additional costs dealing with
the expansion as part of the expenses and that in ’09 the plant operates in a
much more normal environment. We'd also expect the current quarter to be
negatively impacted by Hurricane Ike.

We will focus on normalized earnings, if there is such a thing in today’s panic
environment. Eight months ago, we provided an estimate of a normalized annual
EBITDA of $18M. We’ll maintain that figure and add 15% for the new expansion
that is operating today, providing an EBITDA of $20.7M. We would expect this
figure to grow by approximately 15-25% annually over the few three years as the
expansion becomes fully utilized through a focus on more international
customers. Although they are currently using the extra 15% of the added
capacity, one could certainly argue that in our current economic environment,
profits could be down substantially over the next couple of years. While we
don’t feel this will be the case, we will account for it and will address this
below in our valuation.

To this figure we could add the new transloading business, which although being
a low margin business, it purely an add-on to cash flow from resources that
were virtually 100% in place before this business began earlier this year.
EBITDA for this business is estimated to be in excess of $2M. This provides us
with a normalized headline EBITDA of $22.7M. But for simplicity sake lets
assume the transloading opportunity is a one time event. Over the next three
years or so, we could see EBITDA approach $30 - $35M when the plant capacity is
fully utilized. Cash flow from operation should be significant in the upcoming
year and we would be excited to see the debt fully repaid over the next 18
months.

Valuation
24M shares outstanding @ $2.60/share = $63M + $17M debt = $80M EV

As discussed in all previous write-ups, ARSD has a 50% interest in ALAK – the
Saudi mining venture. The JV is well underway (you can see recent pictures on
the website) and mining should commence in 2010. We conservatively estimated
the value of the mine in our previous write-up at $3 per share. Given the
collapse in metal prices since then, we’ll further discount that figure at
today’s metal prices and arrive at a conservative figure of $1 per share for
ARSD’s ownership interest, or $24M (note this is a 20% discount to the cost to
develop and a 50% discount to the implied value of the creation of the JV).
This does not provide any value to the possibility that the mining area
significantly increases in size from its present 44 sq km size. Although not
providing any value to this, we have come to believe it is a very real
possibility of being significantly expanded and that will have true value.

EV $80M less $23M mine = $57M EV for South Hampton.
EV/EBITDA = 2.7 for South Hampton.
You feel that earnings will be hit hard over the next year or so and figure a
trough figure of 30% less profits:
Trough EV/EBITDA = 3.93 for South Hampton

Don’t feel the mine is worth anything at all?
EV/EBITDA = 3.8X
Plus earnings will decrease 30%
Trough EV/EBITDA = 5.5X

Even in today’s environment of cheap stocks – that’s cheap. It isn’t arrived at
through any wild assumptions. It is quite evident that the stock is more than
sold off at this point as anyone attempting to liquidate a sizeable position
over the past few months has been forced to drive the price lower and lower.
This has lead to today’s ridiculously low price.

What’s it worth in a few years? In recent discussions with management, margins
are anticipated to be normal through ’09 and at this time, the demand for the
new capacity continues to exist. We’ll let you put a multiple on the $30-$35M
EBITDA and add in something for the mine. We’ll just say that it is worth
significantly more than today’s price.

There is a mish mash of reasons for my interest in TPGI.

I have an enormous database of stocks and my studies have shown the $1.00 area
is where alot of them bottom.

Call it perhaps intuitive analysis or just a gut feel for a worthy speculation.
The deal with KAL holds promise and while I never buy for dividends, the fact
that they are paying a stipend says to me Management thinks they can afford to
pay one.

As far as book value, a stated net asset value of $8.92 and a price near 1.5
leaves alot of room between.

I have watched these $1.00 area stocks run up huge percentages on days where
demand kicks in, even if it is only trader demand for a little run. A little
run in this stock could be as much as 50-100% in a short time.

That about sums up my thinking. I don't perceive risk of belly up adversity,
but I will admit these low priced issues and their percentage daily swings can
be unsettling at times. Still, I've tried to develop an immunity to that.
Bottom areas in stocks are never easy to buy. They shake alot of people out at
lows while conviction by traders is always second guessed in the chop chop area
near the lows.

PRGN 3.42$, AVA 15.31$, AEP 26.4$
Bought some shares in PRGN - just another shipper trading below tangible book
with a reasonable looking balance sheet.

I also exchanged AVA (mentioned by Paul here). I have followed that one for a

otherwise similar valuation.

AVA trades below tangible book, PE is around 10, reasonable balance sheet and
they recently raised the dividend.

other utilities I am looking at: LNT, POR, IDA. LNT and POR have large
investment programs that strain the balance sheet. POR recently had a secondary
near the bottom because they need to get some equity in place for a seemingly
large wind power project. I doubt that this one will earn the cost of capital

Hi Spekulatius:

I've noticed that many shippers trade below book value. I'm concerned this is
because they bought the ships when freight rates were higher, which had the
effect of making ships more expensive.

In other words, asset value may be substantially overstated as the value of
ships has no doubt declined along with shipping rates.

Perhaps you have studied this factor and like PRGN still.

Even without alot of long term charters, some companies like FREE have
performed exceptionally well with spot time charters in a niche of smaller
vessels capable of handling smaller and shallower ports. FREE brings that to
light in its last report.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/FreeSeas-Inc-Announces-2008-pz-14769608.html

They beat estimates last qtr. doing 30 cents vs. 25 cent estimate, and I think
there is enough of a price differential between stated tangible book value of
5.70 a share and current price at 1.60 a share to mitigate the fact that things
could go sour. The Co. would have to lose quite a pile of money or devalue its
assets by a significant amount in order to make it worth less that 1.60.

ULTR is one where the valuation on its vessels has actually increased and at
33% of book with the River barge niche, still holds some promise. In the end we
have to rely on the financial statements and hope for management integrity when
the value vessels. Its alot to ask, but I certainly can not truly assess the
value of each ship.

In general, everything seems to be subject to general market vagaries as they
dip and oscillate like a yo yo. When things run up, traders take gains
regardless of the fundamentals and longer term analysis.

1) Stock is near lows. This attracts me like flies are attracted to a dungpile
2) Secondary issued at a higher price 38.25$ than the stocks currently is

price acts like a magnet and the stock tends to go back to that price.
3) Most Reits have done well after secondaries
4) ARE is in a specialized sector that is somewhat insulated from economic woes
(lab space for health care)
5) No refinancing risk until 2011 (but significant one in 2012)
) So far strong fundamentals (occupancy, Same store rents).

care stocks as well, I added to KND - gheez this stock is really falling apart
- anybody knows why?

I peeled off some PM at 43,2$ as it seems close to fair value.

Feels like more buying opportunities than selling opportunities going forward
after it's been the other way around for quite some time.
