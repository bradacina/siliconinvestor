Hi Paul -

I listened to Bill Gross yesterday who is bullish on the utility stocks. I
continue to scan stocks in this sector and like those that also have an
unregulated business component to their revenue streams. My thought is that the
unregulated component can generate more growth for the future.

Spekulatius posted the Citi Bank analysis that provides a pretty good list of
specific stocks in this sector.

Citigroup - integrated gas utilities:
https://www.citigroupgeo.com/pdf/SNA42132.pdf

I have narrowed them down to two that I have on my watch & buy list:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CNP,ATO&d=s

I want to add to my CNP and start a new position for ATO. It is just the price
entry point that I am waiting on as many of these are selling above their 50
DMA. I like to buy those that are below their 50 week MA using a 104 week time
period.

Along a similar theme (buying good dividend payers at a discount with a growth
kicker), I have been looking at CEF (Closed End Funds) selling at a discount.

Compounding Divdends
http://paymedividends.blogspot.com/2009/06/compounding-divdends.html

From the article. Three examples: JNK, HYG and HYV

Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) is paying over 14%.
iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond Fund (HYG) is paying 11%.
BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund V, Inc. (HYV) is paying 13% and selling at
a 7% discount. This one looked the most interesting but their fund expense
ratio is quite high.

GLO - An Overlooked Fund
http://paymedividends.blogspot.com/2009/06/glo-and-overlooked-fund.html

According to the article:"...It is a go anywhere, flexible fund with a good
manager paying over 8% and selling at a 19% discount. Mr. Clough has a proven
record and is invested in the right areas such as Energy, China and Brazil. As
the world economy recovers, these are areas I want to own and GLO has them at a
discount...."

Finally, I continue to look at Tortoise Capital Advisors that have five
Publicly-Traded Closed-End Funds funds.
http://www.tortoiseadvisors.com/companies.cfm
* Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Corp. (NYSE: TYG)
* Tortoise Energy Capital Corp. (NYSE: TYY)
* Tortoise North American Energy Corp. (NYSE: TYN)
* Tortoise Capital Resources Corp. (NYSE: TTO)
* Tortoise Power and Energy Infrastructure Fund, Inc. (NYSE: TPZ)

All the funds generate a pretty good yield.

Distribution Yield Information
TYG TYY TYN TTO TPZ
Yield 7.8% 7.4% 7.9% 8.8% 8.0%

There was some discussion on the message boards that some investors are
disappointed with the Tortoise Capital management group based on their past
performance in their energy fund. I am not too sure if it was the management
group or just the nature of the volatility of the sector, especially with the
range in the price of oil last year.

TPZ is my favorite and is the one you alerted me to. TPZ sells at a 7.4%
discount to its NAV currently (@$18.84/share) but be careful on the buys to
keep the price paid below the NAV. I have been buying below $19.00/share in my
IRA and have the dividends reinvested.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I sold all my mutual funds and have focused on owning individual stocks. I am
not too sure I want to start accumulating CEFs but they begin to look
attractive when you can buy at a discount to the NAV. The ETF alternatives look
attractive as they provide active daily trading so you can get in or out w/o
any problem.

I am still pondering what impact higher rates will have on all of these
investment options. I am leaning to those w/ a growth kicker but Bill Gross
also makes a good argument for owning utilities. The key will be to buy at a
"value" price over a period of time.

Hello Jurgis,

I think we're in agreement on MMO sequels. Maybe the time to sell GRVY would be
on any run higher near the official Ragnarok 2 release?

Gravity's execution leaves much to be desired. That being said:

1) They have more cash than Market Value right now

2) Price Per Share of ~$1.5 with $0.22 EPS made over the last 9 months.

So, the fact that they still made money despite their bad execution, the
KRW/JPY recent rise, and the bad economy in general, gives me hope that there
is money to be made here even if the bad execution continues.

That being said, I'm not looking for this company to turn into a huge
multi-bagger, but just based on #1 and #2 above, I would hope a run up to ~$4
could happen sometime in the next few years. We'll see...

Thanks,

cw

Update on MNDO and SUAI,

For anyone still involved in MNDO, the 0.80 dividend was approved today. I sold
a little more today, but still plan on holdings some. My main problem will be
that the dividend (likely a return of capital) will be above my cost basis on
many shares, which complicates things. Don't hold this in your IRA, or you will
lose 0.16 to the Isreali government that you cannot get back. If you own in a
regular account, you get a tax credit.

SUAI recently converted into TWGP, and I plan to continue to hold this since
TWGP seems like a reasonably well run company at a decent valuation. Also, I've
got huge gains on SUAI that I'm not inclined to take, since I'm back on
taxpaying status. I thought it'd be years before I worked off my capital
losses, but markets are crazy.

re Chinese microcaps-

I don't think that lack of capital is the reason for chinese companies being
listed in the US. there is plenty of capital in China (now they even have a
NASDAQ like market) and billions of US$ equivalent can be raised there. Besides
that there is the HK stock market, which also allows listing of companies
operating in mainland china. They speak the same (or at least similar language
- Cantonese), same timezone and proximity should favor a listing there.

There are two reasons why they list in the US
1) Running out of suckers in China, so go to the US to find new one. I have
seen this before with dinky oil companies in the US listing and promoting in
Europe. they had names like Euro exploration EuroOil, EuroGas or similar names.
Although i never got sucked in this one I would never buy an exploration
companies with "Euro" in the name.

2) They seek an US listing to get around currency and VISA restrictions: the
Chinese currency is not freely convertible, so it's difficult for rich Chinese
individuals to move money out of China (I think the restrictions is 50k in
US$/year). Now when working for or owning an US listed company these executives
have a great excuse to travel, exchange money, get a VISA, maybe Greencard in
the US, especially if they have a formal "headquarter" in the US. Look at SGZH
(discussed earlier),a coal mine in the Chinese hinterland. Their "US
headquarter" is in a wealthy Asian dominated enclave near LA. Why could that
be?

I tend not to like companies that continually dilute shareholders with stock
offerings (I think they had at least three this year), particularly when they
are trading at a discount to NAV.

However, they seem to be executing their strategy. Also, if the CEO buys stock
then maybe he will decide to cut down on the offerings so he won't dilute
himself (or maybe he will just buy more stock in the offerings).

I sold my PSEC after company machinations with share issuance and repurchase. I
could not understand why, if the company were in good shape, it would dilute
the stockholders by issuing more stock. And there were two such issuances,
within a couple of months, if I recall right. Following that, the company then
initiated a stock BUYBACK. Maybe it's a way to raise ammo for acquisitions and
keep the balance sheet debt-free, but I don't like this jerking around. And the
possibility they'll continue doing it. A company so willing to issue new shares
when stock is below NAV, they'll maybe be even more willing to do so if/as
stock rises above NAV.

Company management though is positive about the company, as you point out by
their purchases.

I'd say maybe worth a shot based on management's buys. Too expensive for me
though at current price. Maybe if the stock can be bought closer to $10, where
it's been recently.

It has several recent small insider buys at prices higher than current price.

It has Greenlight (David Einhorn) as an investor.

It has a 10% distribution yield.

It's only been public for a couple of years. Management says that means there
are no legacy problems, and they have had opportunity to deploy money recently
when competition has been much less.

It trades at .85 stated bv. and does not have much debt (according to Yahoo).

Thanks for the info. That mgmt fee seems to be as part of the IPO. Unless you

"(1) Represents the underwriting discount with respect to the shares of our
common stock sold by us in this offering."

worse is this basic hedge fund crap:

"Fifth Street Management serves as our investment adviser. We pay Fifth Street
Management a fee for its services under the investment advisory agreement
consisting of two components — a base management fee and an incentive fee. The
base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of our gross
assets, which includes any borrowings for investment purposes. The incentive
fee consists of two parts. The first part is calculated and payable quarterly
in arrears and equals 20% of our “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for
the immediately preceding quarter, subject to a preferred return, or “hurdle,”
and a “catch up” feature."

Grommit, look again. there is a 4.75% sales load - this is due to the offering
expense. 4.75% is a normal fee for a secondary of this scope. The 4.6% that I
am referring to is an annual expense. one thing is sure, management has taken
care of themselves and they have a great incentive to increase the assets under
management.

Now how you can make money when you need to borrow money from banks and slap a
4.6% fee on top of that (plus the 4.75% sales load from the secondary) I do not
know and have no desire to find out.

You should know that basically all these BDCs (PSEC, HTGC, PNNT, ARCC, AINV,
BKCC, TCAP, MVC, TICC, ACAS, ALD, GLAD, KED) are set up to have high fees, so
if you are going to sell on the basis of fees, you should probably consider
selling any BDC holding you might have. This is not unreasonable, but I
wouldn't single out FSC. BDCs are all essentially run with hedge-fund like
incentive structures, or perhaps more accurately private-equity like incentive
structures. With BDCs, you are getting investments in private equity.

I would completely agree the fees are too high, but I would also point out that
a company like FSC is originating loans to private companies, which requires
more due diligence work and infrastructure then a mutual fund manager buying
Intel or IBM, so you are going to have live with higher fees.

I disagree with MCsweets comment: "but I would also point out that a company

Many investments require a lot of dd, and to say that making a private equity
loan is so difficult that it requires extra compensation is a crock. It takes
more dd for a REIT to do a development or buy a property, it takes even more dd
for a consumer products company to launch a new product line.

It is obviously more suitable for compensation to be stock based (or even bonus
based) and not an automatic 2% of assets, and certainly not 20% of profits. And
jeez, add another 5% of the IPO as a finders fee or something. Investors are

All IPOs involve significant underwriting fees. The underwriting doesn't come
for free. Recently, companies have amortizing some IPO fees into greater yearly
fees, but basically always assume that someone is taking a good chunk off the
top.

That it is why it is almost always a bad deal to buy a closed-end fund, BDC, or

Well, UVICF has been paying a healthy dividend for quite some time and they

better than their earnings thus enabling the payments. Last quarter their
diluted EPS was $0.11/share and their cashflow from operating activities and

Someone reported that the company has stated that they will continue to pay the
dividend.

Keep in mind that with them buying back roughly half the shares the cost of

The GEM has only been opened for a short time, so eventually I believe you will
see more Chinese companies listing on the Chinet.

Saying that one of the two main reasons they list in the US because they've run
out of "suckers" in China paints with too broad a stroke. The New York Tilmes,
I believe, gives a more accurate accounting of the differences in the Chinese
and US markets. Access to capital has been the key driver for micro-caps to
list in the US markets. in the future, with Chinese investors willing to pay
100 times earnings, I believe there will be more than enough "suckers" to these
aspiring companies.

New Chinese Stock Exchange Opens With Surge

The highly anticipated opening of China’s new Nasdaq-style stock exchange last
Friday is already being seen as a watershed moment for the country’s capital
markets, providing new opportunities for Chinese investors and an alternative
source of financing for upstart companies.

Investors went on a wild buying spree during the first day of trading Friday on
the Growth Enterprise Market, or GEM, sending the shares of some companies
soaring as much as 210 percent, The New York Times’s David Barboza reported
from Shanghai.

“This is potentially a major game changer in China’s high-tech industry,” said
Yu Zhou, a professor at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. “For about 10
years, the biggest problem for China’s innovative companies was finance. You
know it is very hard for them to get loans from state-owned banks.”

The buying was so feverish that regulators, trying to calm the market,
temporarily suspended trading in the shares of all 28 newly listed companies at
different points on Friday, and analysts warned about the risks posed by
excessive speculation and inflated stock prices.

Stocks on the GEM opened sharply lower on Monday, with many shares down 10
percent.

Still, the first batch of companies listed on the GEM — including film
producers, software makers and pharmaceutical companies — raised about $2
billion in their initial public offerings, far more than the companies had
hoped.

By the end of trading Friday, the combined market value of the newly listed
companies was more than $20 billion, creating fortunes for the founders and
investors in those companies.

China is already the world’s biggest market for initial public offerings, and
its resurgent economy is flush with capital and investors with a big appetite
for risk.

But trading experts have long complained that this country’s market system is
seriously flawed, partly because of a misallocation of capital.

State-run banks lend primarily to state-owned companies, which tend to be
inefficient. Listings on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are
dominated by government enterprises. Young private Chinese companies generally
list their shares overseas, in Hong Kong or on the Nasdaq or New York Stock
Exchange, because there are few opportunities for stock listings inside the
country.

But the government hopes to change that with the creation of the GEM, which is
based in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen. The government is seeking to create
a more efficient capital market system, one that would steer investment capital
to small and midsize private enterprises — companies that can help reshape the
economy through technology and innovation, rather than low-price exports.

Although the GEM, which is also known here as ChiNext, is tiny when compared
with the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges, regulators hope it will
eventually compete with Nasdaq and entice more Chinese companies to list with
GEM.

The GEM is also expected to give a boost to China’s venture capital and private
equity markets, which have been hampered by a system that until now has not
provided wealthy investors with what industry insiders call an exit strategy,
or a way to eventually cash out of their investments in small companies through
a domestic stock market.

There are big hurdles to creating a stock exchange similar to Nasdaq, which
includes companies like Microsoft, Intel and Google. For instance, volatile
stock prices and high valuations could hurt the new bourse’s credibility with
entrepreneurs and investors.

Chinese investors are known to speculate, favoring momentum buying and selling
rather than the underlying fundamentals of a company, analysts say. Indeed, the
casinolike nature of the Shanghai and existing Shenzhen exchanges, combined
with government intervention, have added to the volatility of the Chinese
markets.

Analysts warn that the GEM could also be prone to similar speculative frenzies.

Andy Xie, an economist who formerly worked at Morgan Stanley, is already
calling the GEM a “V.I.P. table on top of a big casino.”

Chang Chun, an expert on financial markets at the China Europe International
Business School in Shanghai, said that China needed a market to serve
start-ups, but “the issue is the maturity of Chinese investors.”

Before trading opened Friday, he said, regulators created rules to guard
against excessive volatility and even warned investors that they would crack
down on aggressive speculation. Still, Friday’s opening — with 28 companies
beginning to trade at once — was marked by wild price swings.

One cause of concern was the huge valuations of the first batch of stocks
listed Friday.

The average GEM-listed company has a price-to-earnings ratio of about 100 —
meaning investors are paying about $100 for every $1 of 2008 earnings. By
comparison, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index of big American companies
trades at closer to 20 times earnings.

GEM stocks are also priced far above Shanghai stocks, which have long been
considered inflated by United States standards.

Still, hundreds of Chinese companies are eagerly awaiting their turn to list on
the GEM, and many analysts say the exchange will fill an important need:
directing financing toward smaller start-ups that help rebalance economic
growth. Ms. Zhou at Vassar said she had heard that there were over 1,000
companies in Beijing’s high-tech district alone that met the requirements to
list shares on the GEM exchange.

Analysts say many more start-ups will be eager to list after seeing the riches
made by the first group of companies to go public on the GEM.

For instance, Wang Zhongjun and his brother Wang Zhonglei are the founders of
Beijing-based Huayi Brothers Media, one of the country’s leading film

Thanks, I2. I hope everybody who celebrates USA Thanksgiving, had a nice
holiday.

Back to stocks for me.

Going to up my commitment to construction stocks a little tomorrow if I can get
my fill prices. We have got to put people to work, and if contracts are let to
construction firms for important infrastructure builds I view that as an
important venue for employing blue collar and semi-skilled tradespeople.

Have not done well this year with my few short positions. I'm closing them with
losses now, and will consider reentering in 33+ days. (That will get me into
early 2010.) I don't like keeping shorts open from one year into the next. A
slight bother to my taxes wherein I believe I have to reconcile and explain why
sales reported by brokers don't match sales as reported on Sch. D. (Short sales
made 2009 that are not closed out are reported by brokers as gross sales for
2009, and they aren't on Sch D total sales since there are no corresponding
buys to close the transactions - if I keep the shorts open through 2009 into
2010. And so the discrepancy.)
ANF and GE will be among the stocks I'll consider re-shorting. (ANF with a very
high forward p/e multiple for a clothing company (or any company); GE with
$500B in debt.) Also paired trade of buy or hold asset manager AMG and short
FII.

I2, are there any stocks you like going into 2010 as buys now?

Hi Paul -

You stated . . ."Going to up my commitment to construction stocks a little

Any companies in particular you see as value buys? Will you focus on regional
special situations or global opportunities?

I continue to like FLUOR CP (NEW)(NYSE: FLR). Their forward PE of 12 seems
reasonable but I would not pay up for this one.

I am exploring unique material suppliers or fabrication companies w/ a focus on
those businesses that are "sole source" suppliers. Any ideas?

EKS, here's where I am with construction co's:

JEC: My order in as of last night: trying to buy under $35/sh.

FLR: Will continue to add if stock drops on no adverse news (and a market
correction doesn't scare me out)

Cramer says FLR better than JEC:

http://www.cnbc.com/id/34138772/site/14081545?__source=yahoo
|headline|quote|text|&par=yahoo

According to article, FLR builds, JEC maintains. Nonsensical comment in the
article though: "...in the interest of diversification, investors should own
only one."

ABB: Have an exploratory position. Just holding.

URS: Some shares remain from '03 core position. An add recently at $45 for a
trade is not working; I'll continue to hold on for now.

NWPX: An exploratory few share buy made last week. Rising bv; profitable every
year past ten; p/bk now at .8 I look to see at 1.2 in a few years, as has
happened before.

ORA: Not a value stock. Just a few shares for me to play the theme of increased
geothermal energy development. They are by far the leader in plant construction
in this area.

TPC: I continue to buy as stock falls (Ouch!)
I believe this stock was recommended by Dorfman in one of his recent columns.
Low p/bk, low d/e.

There are some Chinese companies that are suppliers or fabricators that may be
uniquely positioned. I'll have to go through my list.

My preference is regional buys - USA. Country seems to be heading quickly into

MikeS9907,

I bought some DAAT here today for a starter position.

I am not big on buying stocks up 100% and ones that work with third parties to
do stock promotion (although they disclose this, so nothing shady here).
However, DAAT looks like a good value and what more defensive area than guns if
the country goes down the tubes.

As a side note, it seems like slim pickens for cheap micro-cap stocks IMO. I
don't know if anyone else has other opinions, but I am not finding many
compelling microcap values out there, at least relative to the risks. Maybe I
am not looking hard enough.

Paul - I continue to own shares in MUELLER WATER PRODUCTS(NYSE: MWA) but am
disappointed in their performance. I probably should average down but I think
there are better companies to own in this sector. MWA is (or was) the sole
source supplier for water hydrant valves in New York City. The municipal
Vendor/manufacturer certification process can be a huge barrier to entry for
new competitors (especially for foreign made products ie China). MWA is not the
low cost manufacturer and continues to lose money.

I was trying to find companies that supply and service the NG industry
specifically those that would supply the pipes and valves for all the new NG
shale wells under development. Also TRP will be building their trans continent
NG pipeline (from Canada to U.S.) and there should be a growing demand for the
manufactured infrastructure. I would like to find a low PE company that might
benefit from the growth in the build out of this new NG infrastructure. Any
additional business from government stimulus spending would be a plus.

Your suggestion for Northwest Pipe Company (NasdaqGS: NWPX) sounded like a
possibility but their primary business is in water infrastructure applications
(ie drinking water systems).

I need to go through my NG pipeline & Utility company's annual reports to see
if there are any common vendors that have long term supply contracts. Maybe I
can find a lead there.

Finally, AECOM Technology Corporation (ACM) was mentioned up thread and looks
quite interesting. It seemed expensive at 14 PE but their forward PE is
estimated to be around 11. I was attracted by ACM's technical "knowledge base"
which is the one resource the U.S. can export to China & India. No dividend
payment so it slipped on my watch list. http://www.aecom.com/What+We+Do

2. They have a pristine balance sheet with a book value of $0.144/share and
cash of $0.084/share.

3. In the earnings PR they said they were recently awarded contracts in excess
of $3M which is big considering their revenue.

4. They said they have a number of bid opportunities for new business which
should allow their profitability to continue to grow.

5. On 10/01/09 they signed an IDIQ contract with the Department of Homeland
Security.

Hi Paul - I opted for more FLR over JEC. JEC missed their previous earnings

small profit in ABB and moved the proceeds into FLR.

Closed my position in MWA and booked my loss. Scaled out of some higher cost
shares of SVU and will be a buyer again if we see a test back around $12.00.

Trying to peel off a few shares of AAUKY after a nice run ($10 to $22) but
$26.00 is my fair value target. I am looking at starting a position in FE with
the proceeds as it pays a good dividend (5.2%).

I continue to explore the Gas & Electric Utilities and NG pipeline companies.
Several still pay high dividends and sell at historical low levels with lower
than average PE's. It seems like a good place to hide until the FED makes their

Not sure what I will do-- likely just continue to hold shares I have and not
add to it. Dividend yield not particularly attractive to me. I may though put
the dividend in dividend reinvestment plan, as I have with several utility
stocks.

Given fluctuations in market past 12 months, there's something to be said for

I sold 1/2 my IRA shares in 2008 pre crash and never bought back in. I have
been trying to buy back shares of companies I sold post crash at lower levels
if their business model is still sound.

Another company trading near it's 10 year low and still looks attractive is
NOK. They pay an annual dividend every April. My last buy was July 2009 at
$13.00. My starter position was bought 2/2003 at $12.70. I sold a large chunk
above $30.00 in late 2007. I think it's time to reload again w/ the
expectations of collecting the April 2010 dividend and peeling off shares at
prices above $20.00. It appears that there has been recent institutional
selling (25% above daily average). Once this is completed (perhaps by year end)
every body that wanted out is gone. (Time to pick up the straw hats during
winter to sell in the summer.)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=NOK

The stock is cheap with a 12 PE (compared to Apple or Motorola). The company
continues to make money and still has a good chunk of the world's market share
(even w/ a loss in some of their high end smart phone product to Apple). They
have contracts with Siemens to build wireless network infrastructure in
developing countries as well as sell (in volume) low end handsets to these
markets. China, India and Latin America are still huge markets for Nokia.

NOK is a "value" buy IMO. Any market share gain in the high end mobile market
will attract new buyers to the stock.

This is one of my larger Tech holdings and is attractive to me as they have a
low PE and are just shy of paying a 4% dividend. These are attributes not found
among many of the technology stocks.

That's a pretty good question.

According to our thread header, we would be looking for value "in the Ben
Graham tradition". As I look at my Graham bible (Intelligent Investor), I see
that value is not really defined. The closest I get is p.13, "Buying a
neglected and therefore undervalued issue for profit".

It seems to me that we here agree that the definition of value varies with the
person.

Ah, but when you say, "finding value is the best way to invest", then you have
to consider what is an "investment operation"? (i.e. what do we we mean by
"investing"?) For that Dr. Graham is very clear. And having that definition
("investment operation") in mind is one of the keys to success in the stock
market. Imo and experience.

thanks for answering Paul.

i've read graham's book too, a long time ago on advice from a friend. it is the
well known bible of investing. but you're right, it doesn't help define
'value'.

i guess you are probably the one who started this thread so you would know if
value has been defined here before. and there is a problem. because if the
definition of a word varies by the person, then one can never know what one is
talking about.

perhaps an accurate definition of 'value' would help one to improve the
"investment operation"?

what do you think?

From:Paul Senior
I've been here from the beginning, but I didn't start the thread. I took over
from Mike Burry who went on to become a very successful hedge fund manager.

I don't find the differing definitions a problem. It's actually an asset in
that if I can see something as a value as I define value, and a couple of other
people look at the same company/stock and call it a value by their view of
value which might differ from mine, then coming at it from three different ways
can mean that, roughly, no matter how you look at it, it is a value buy. Well,
it gives some confirmation and confidence anyway.

If you have no experience with value as a criterion for a stock buy or hold or
sell, then you could be stuck. If you have some idea of what you believe to be
a "value" or good "investment operation", then you can sort of determine from
the person posting on a stock what his/her definition of value encompasses,
what aspects of value the person emphasizes, and you can compare his/her
definition and focus to yours. Tracking some of the various stocks mentioned
can enlighten or can confirm suspicions.

For example, as regards me, for every stock I first mention here that's not in
an off-topic post, I try to say something about why I believe it's a value, or
I provide a link to what others might say about it as regards it being a value
buy. I frequently use and emphasize stated book value as a criterion. Some
people believe that criterion to be misguided or just wrong or something only
to be considered peripherally. I also like high roe, low p/e, low p/sales, and
other criteria. So you CAN basically "know what I am talking about". However,
you might not agree with any or all of it. Other people, given their age,
portfolio size, goals, time horizon, will emphasize different aspects of stocks
which make them value buys for them. For example, emphasizing dividend yields -
high or perhaps just consistently growing, for portfolios structured for
retirement or perhaps for limited volatility.

Some people here emphasize stock selling below net assets (Ben Graham net-nets)
or below cash in the till. Other people will argue these are basically cigar
butts, requiring a lot of patience to pay off, a diversity of them (not just
one), and that there's not much proof (nowadays) that these things, even if
they are "values", pay off enough to make holding them worthwhile. The stocks
at least get mentioned though; it's just up to the reader to know if they are
suitable value buys for their portfolio or not.

I think the trick with these miner stocks is that commodity prices are always

The Best in Engineering and Construction
http://online.barrons.com/article/SB125978784740973301.html?mod=BOL_hpp_oe

WE ARE INITIATING COVERAGE of the engineering and construction sector with a
positive long-term outlook based on the thesis that the overhaul of the global
energy and industrial supply chains is far from complete. As the world-wide
economy recovers from the brink of contagion, the prevailing business climate
could hardly be characterized as the roaring '20s. Nonetheless, we believe
several names in our coverage universe are positioned in very attractive end
markets and trade at reasonable valuations.

In our view, China and India are in the early stages of fundamental economic
transition. As their populations (and those of other developing nations) attain
higher levels of affluence and per-capita energy demand, substantial
investments in energy and industrial infrastructure should create opportunity
for the engineering and construction sector.

During the height of the turmoil in the financial and commodities markets,
several customers deferred or scrapped planned capital projects in an attempt
to preserve cash. With credit beginning to flow, the commodities demand outlook
stabilizing and costs moderating, well capitalized clients have begun to return
to long-term oriented thinking in their project evaluations.

The anticipated return of modest global demand growth in 2010-2011 coupled with
the tailwind from underlying depletion should facilitate an uptick in upstream
project activity. The best-positioned names in the group are McDermott
International (ticker: MDR), Fluor (FLR), KBR (KBR), Foster Wheeler AG (FWLT)
and Jacobs Engineering Group (JEC).

The 2010-2011 capital spending outlook for U.S. government activities related
to nuclear nonproliferation, environmental remediation and military theater is
quite robust. For investors concerned about a double-dip global recession
scenario, names with established government operations businesses such as URS
(URS), Fluor, McDermott International, and KBR offer some countercyclical
defensive attributes.

Growing natural-gas demand from emerging markets, a more palatable emissions
profile than coal and the widening geographic disconnect between reserves and
consumption centers (excluding the U.S.) bodes well for liquid-natural gas
infrastructure development. The industry leaders in our coverage universe are
KBR, Chicago Bridge & Iron (CBI) and Foster Wheeler.

The bidding climate for engineering and construction contractors has improved
measurably since the nadir of the global financial crisis. Nevertheless,
clients are using relatively soft market conditions to opportunistically
transfer execution risk to engineering and construction firms, rebid previously
scrapped projects at more advantageous prices and invite contractors to bid
against project incumbents for follow-on awards.

so basically you're saying determining value is a judgement call. i agree. but
i still think judgement improves with better understanding.

when someone defines speed we all know that there's a better definition than
'how fast you're going'.. one of the best definitions for speed is the
formula..

speed=distance/time

so why can't we define value the same way?

value=quality/price

quality can be anything that is important to you. it might be beauty or detail
or size or durability. you choose the quality that is important to you and
apply it. it can be any scale, so why not let the price range determine the
scale?

a product with a price range of 1 to 10 dollars should also have a quality
scale of 1 to 10. a house might have a quality range of 100,000 to 1,000,000
just to get a value number that's easy to work with.

if you apply the formula to 2 houses of roughly the same quality it is easy to
see that the higher the price, the lower the value. but of course price
shouldn't be the determining factor, value should. it always really is, even if
we're not conscious of it. it's just that with the formula it becomes obvious.

I am not seeing NITE as an attractive stock. As a market maker, their business
model is broken. I see the stock as overvalued, since it's trading at 2x
tangible book.

I think I'd rather by IBKR. They are also a MM (mostly options) and that
business is suffering. However besides the MM operation they have a great (imo)
brokerage operation that is expanding and winning share because they offer the
lowest cost trading. Tangible book for IBKR is about 13$/share so on that
measure it trades at a discount to NITE.

Basically, I'm looking for NITE to be a revision-to-mean play. I don't know
about NITE's "business model as a market maker" being broken. There are
apparently ten analysts who follow the stock, and their consensus opinion is
that NITE's earnings will be higher next year than current. So they don't seem
to be worried about NITE's business model as affecting earnings negatively.

I don't have info about NITE's historical tangible bv, but for stated bv, NITE
has traded on average at 1.4x or greater stated bv in about 8 of the past ten
years. And additionally, in all but one of the past ten years stated bv has
increased. So I will guess I have a reasonable shot that within the next 18-24
months, NITE stock might be higher as it might once again trade at 1.4x. (It's
now about 1.09x.) I'll guess that if NITE is trading for 2x tangible bv now,
that in past years it was trading at maybe 2.8xtangibible or higher. You may
correctly view NITE as overvalued trading at 2x now, but as I say, I look at
the ten year history to repeat, and so I'm looking to see NITE back at those
higher prevailing price:book numbers.

Perhaps it's one of those situations of looking at NITE in the rear view
mirror, or out the windshield. I can't tell if going forward NITE has a
dangerous/poor business model, or if IBKR will be greatly profitable with its
low cost brokerage or if it has the programs to continue bringing in customers.
This might all be so, making IBKR perhaps the far better buy now.

I see some discrepancy between current numbers reported by Yahoo and by SI, so
I can only approximately calculate that looking in the mirror, that this year
(2009) NITE is expected to earn $1.41 on $13.46 of stated bv, or $1.41 on $8.95
of tangible bv. This with a d/e ratio of .12. Meanwhile, it looks like IBKR
will earn $1.11 on $13.88 of stated bv (Stated =tangible, according to SI.).
And this is with a d/e number of .78 (according to SI). For me, when I factor
in the stock price (NITE in $14's, IBKR in $17's), I rather prefer NITE over
IBKR as my value buy.

JMO, the way I'm looking at it, and of course, I could be very wrong.

Will hold off on the FE buy FirstEnergy Corp. (FE) as it traded as high as
$45/share yesterday. A price below $40.00/share might be a good entry point.

The AMLJ website was very recently updated. In the investor FAQ it states the
following about starting additional shifts:

Q.The company commented on the large production potential of the UAV (Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle) market. How does AML plan to address increases in production
levels associated with large programs?

A.The company has made significant investments in automation. Automation has
been used extensively during this FY to reach a new high in production levels.
Recently we introduced a second shift and are in process of training a third
shift.

ARO. Re-entering this retailer of teen clothes. Positive article in Barron's
encapsulates the value idea for me:

"Aeropostale tends to have lower prices for its goods than a number of its
rivals. And its stock, trading at just 8.5 times next year's earnings, not far
off its five-year historical low of 7.5 times, is cheaper than that of rivals
like Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and American Eagle (AEO). .

The stock has outperformed its apparel retail peers for the last one-, two-,
and five-year periods, and more than doubled year to date. Still, shares are
off nearly 35% from their September high."

High roe (and, correspondingly, high price/bk) with no ltd.

As a pair trade, I'm intending to try again with a short of ANF next year, if
ANF will rise again up closer to $40 on no positive news.

Heavy Call volume on the NYB December $12 Calls. Close to 9,000 contracts
traded. Heavy activity on the December $13 Calls too. January 2010 Call option
activity is quite active.

Rumor has it that the company is looking to acquire a bank through the FDIC at
a "value" price.

Astoria Financial Corporation (AF)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AF&.yficrumb=wdFBh1jZhKu was one of the names but
it is all just speculation at this point.

Hi Paul - That's one way to buy an undervalued asset. Just buy it from the FDIC
w/ a "loan-loss" guarantee.

From the article you posted: "... NYB received certain assets of approximately
$11 billion, including performing single-family mortgage and consumer loans of
approximately $6 billion which are subject to a loss-share agreement with the
FDIC; cash of approximately $4 billion; and securities of approximately $1
billion...".

It looks like they received some sort of "loan-loss" guarantee from the FDIC
for the loans assumed. These new loans expand their base by 19% to $42 Billion
with the kicker of a "loan-loss" guarantee.

I guess I should have followed the big option trader when I first noticed 518
contracts trade early this AM on the December $12 calls at $0.20... all buys! I
did double up my core position in November when the CEO mentioned they were
looking to do an "accretive" deal if the opportunity presented itself.

Whoever this buyer of NYB options was, he will have to do some explaining to

Paul Senior, you speak of short positions. Believe it or not, I've never
shorted a stock. :)

Re: "..., are there any stocks you like going into 2010 as buys now?"

I'm still a little gun-shy after taking some huge paper losses in the bear
market. I did throw a little money into AFLAC, RPM, and SMH at much lower
levels, but the risk:reward ratios are much less favorable now. I'm still
waiting for PG to get down to $40. <g>

I'm trying to find a place for my maturing T-Bills and T-notes. I've been quite
overweight in GNMAs and the GNMA prices are so high now, so I really hate to
put more fixed-income money in there. Any ideas on the fixed income side?

Best wishes,

re ARO. i agree the stock looks good especially alongside a short position in
one of the more overvalued retailers or an retail centered ETF.

One thing regarding ARO - with about 1000 stores in the US they are probably
close to saturation especially in the current subdued consumer climate and with
their fairly narrow teen target group. It will be crucial how they deploy the
incoming cash - develop a new retail concept, return cash to shareholders or
maybe acquisition (the latter being the least favorite outcome).

Worse than worthless. I see worthless as having no value. The SEC seems to have
had negative worth--- because they've been downright dangerous. Giving people
the false belief there are rules for assuring fairness and that those rules are
being enforced. Instead we get scandals - options backdating, insider trading,
naked short selling, accounting issues, executive&board-of-director governance
issues, and so on.

Government entities are not inherently good or bad. I actually think that the
SEC has shown more teeth in last 12 month and may become a better run
institution.

Same with health care reform. Germany and France (which have the most expensive
health care system in Europe) can run their system at 10-11% of GNP with a
better average outcome, while the US is currently at a cost of about 16% of
GNP. However that does not mean that a public/national system would necessarily
cure the ails of the US health care system, it just depends on the framework. A
lot of things would need to change and all stakeholders would need to make
sacrifices to make the the system work better and more economical.

In the US, we spend ASTRONOMICAL amounts near end of life, which wildly skew

Also, we sue doctors more than anywhere else, juicing the healthcare bill
further.

It's hard to make a comparison.
