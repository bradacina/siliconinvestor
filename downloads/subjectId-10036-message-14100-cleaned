ESG Reinsurance (ESREF) becomes weirder by the day. They just released
earnings. Stock is at $3.10

- not only is book value $9+
- but per the release says “Excluding writedown, profit was $1.3 million.”
- If profitbable by $1.3 mill this qtr; then it's 2 straight profitable
quarters
- also, SC 13G/A Filing Date: 2/14/2002, looks like SAB Sapital Partners &

I'll start a very small position in cigar butt SPGLA.

Last time Spiegel was this low I chose not to pick it up, and so I missed the
profits that did come to those who did buy.

And now their business situation seems even more precarious to me. The stock
might be a double or nothing.

Boy, now there's a cigar butt!
With the most recent write down, BV decreases to about $3. Sales comps.,
released today, decreased from -8% in Jan. to -13% in Feb.
And then, the capper, from a 2/21 release:

As a result of its 2001 financial performance, including the estimated loss
recorded in the fourth quarter for the disposition of its credit card business,
the company is not in compliance with certain of its 2001 loan covenants. The
company stated that it is currently working closely with its bank group and its
majority shareholder to restructure its credit facilities.

Zaepfel stated, ``We have strong support from our majority shareholder and are
confident that we will be able to secure the necessary financial support. Our
goal is to have new financing arrangements in place by mid-April. In the
interim, with the support of our majority shareholder, we have adequate
liquidity and cash flows to fund our day-to-day operations. Additionally, the
anticipated sale of the credit card business will reduce our debt and capital
requirements.''

Well, I wish you luck, no guts, no glory, but I wouldn't say things are going

Paul Senior -- My #1 Pick:

Good evening Paul,

I don't own the number of stocks that you own, I assume based upon your
writing, but Brascan is my favorite at the present time. I've produced some
reports (for an investment house)on Brascan, based on many reasons.

http://www.brascancorp.com

To be brief, the company has the following benefits:

1) new leadership that is very focused, intelligent, and shareholder friendly

2) a current dividend yield of about 3% (the company has no plans to increase
the dividend or to decrease/eliminate the dividend)

3) a misunderstanding, in my view, of bnn's Brazilian exposure

4) significant insider ownership

5) significant bbn stock buyback

6) the most complete, transparent, and precise financial reporting of any
company that I follow

7) bnn's power operations are deriving significant cash flow

8) financial operations (business is flowed primarily through its 71%-owned
Trilon Financial Corporation) are providing solid cash flow to bnn

9) bnn's ownership in public entities have signficant upside -- due to their
business models and the fact that these firms are all buying back stock (bnn
wants to own 100% positions, eventually, in these companies)

10) Management has clearly identified Falconbridge & Noranda ownership stakes
as an issue to be addressed -- in terms of creating shareholder value

11) Management has explicit goals and expectations for business operations in
order to create shareholder value

12) bnn's real estate operations are creating significant cash flow

http://www.brascancorp.com/BrascanWebSite/BrasWebSite.nsf/(SectionFrame)/Our+Bu
inesses

"...Brascan's property operations are conducted primarily through 48%-owned
Brookfield Properties Corporation. Brookfield is a major, publicly held North
American commercial real estate company, focused on the ownership, management
and development of premier office properties in the downtown business districts
of selected major North American cities..."

It sounds like a good company and they have wonderful plans. Buy what makes it
a buy at $20 price, a 20 P/E?

LNT has been mentioned here a few times and I just bought some. Not a
compelling "no brainer buy", but probably a "nice buy".

Dividend 6.6% at $2.00 per year - easily maintainable based on the CFO's
outlook (see below).
Insider Activity +
PE ratio - same as industry.

from press release:

Future Earnings Outlook
Thomas M. Walker, Alliant Energy's Chief Financial Officer stated, ``Given the
potential downward pressures on earnings from recent decreases in oil and gas
prices, the slowing economy... we have lowered our guidance for estimated
adjusted earnings per share for 2002 by $0.05 per share to a range of $2.45 -
$2.65 per share. We expect to mitigate these downward pressures by the
continued improved profitability of our non-regulated investments, including
recovery of oil and gas prices later in 2002, a rigorous cost and capital
control program and the continued successful execution of our strategic plan...
our goal remains delivering 7-10 percent annual adjusted earnings growth and
enhanced shareowner value as well as meeting our financial objectives,
including maintaining our stable dividend and investment grade credit
ratings.''

Good morning Grommit,

Message #14109 from Grommit at Mar 9, 2002 11:36 AM

"...It sounds like a good company and they have wonderful plans. Buy what makes
it a buy at $20 price, a 20 P/E...?"

I do not value the stock on a P/E ratio. Without looking at the exact #s, the
stock is trading at about a 11x free cash flow. This issue was addressed on the
last conference call. The web site has a 80+ power point file that is very
helpful in calculating Brascan's cash flow. The company also has an excellent
credit rating.

I value the company based on the true value of Brascan's assets (not just the
stock market value of its publicly traded holdings like its real estate equity
holdings), new management's focus, and the net intrinsic value. Analysts
currently calculate the book value based, in part, on the equity's stock
holdings.

I never base a value just on P/E, P/S, etc.

For anyone who attended Mr. Whitman's annual meeting last November, the
management appears to be intelligent, enthusiastic and focused. The quarterly
numbers provided support for management's guidance.

Berkshire Hathaway Article:
http://www.thestreet.com/comment/chrisedmonds/10012370.html

The below excerpt reminds me of ELN/ENE/Tyco's management to perfection:

Accounting in the Rough

"...In his annual commentary on American business, Buffett was brief and
direct. "Charlie and I are disgusted by the situation, so common in the last
few years, in which shareholders have suffered billions in losses while the
CEOs, promoters, and other higher-ups who fathered these disasters have walked
away with extraordinary wealth," he wrote. "Indeed, many of these people were
urging investors to buy shares while concurrently dumping their own, sometimes
using methods that hid their actions. To their shame, these business leaders
view shareholders as patsies, not partners..."

-I've never made this claim before, so here goes:

- I think ESREF's insiders are masking how good the company is so tehy can
acquire all the shares themselves on the cheap

- ESREF (ESG Re-insurance) does both direct & re-insurance; 2 profitable
quarters in a row announced on 3/8/02; stated they expect to be "bottom line"
profitable in 2002; just got a good Fitch rating on the previous S&P upgrade;
mainly b/c they're capitalized to the tune of about $9/share

- 3/8/02's limited announcement was enough to increase share price 5% on 5,500
shs

- their release of data is way too summarized to make sense of it - in the
notes, however, it says “Excluding writedown, profit was $1.3 million.”

- then in another release they make the 2002 profitability projection

- to top it all off, tucked away in the Edgar filings, is 13G/A Filing Date:
2/14/2002, showing that SAB Sapital Partners & Scott Bommer filed a joint 13G
showing ownership of a little over 25% of the shares

- in summary, I think ESREF's insiders are masking how good the company is so
tehy can acquire all the shares themselves on the cheap. Stock closed on Friday

OTOTOTOT! Blankmind & Hype:

This will be the last time I post about a meaningless issue on the best thread
on SI. If Blankmind wonders why I believe he hypes every post, then here is
some of his comments on SOFN. Reading through these comments, I came to the
conclusion (in error according to blankmind) that blankmind was hyping sofn.
All of a sudden he has a change of opinion because 3/31/02 is approaching?

Anyone can have change of opinion. Even on a daily basis. I posted my opinion
that blankmind posts exaggerations and hype on every stock he speculates in
(i.e., aol, tyco, sofn, etc.). This is my opinion. He believes he is right and
took the 30% profit.

I believe in accountability. I live in a different world than blankmind. I'm
not going to say that I will be "p---ed" if I don't get $4 and then sell out @
$1.99.

Blankmind -- we have a difference of opinion. Let's please let the thread
return to more meaningful discussion. I do recommend you or anyone do a search
on your comments to support your "beliefs" or my "beliefs" -- if anyone is in
doubt about your "postings".

Prosperous Investing. CJ

Interesting blankmind comments:

1)- I'm willing to bet that today's $2 stock price will be laughable

2) - i think SOFN gets an offer of between $5-10 by 3/31/02

3) - if we come away w/ less than $4/sh; given the $3/sh in cash, i'll really
be p---- off

4) -we'll see - but i think at under $2; with a minimum buyout of $5 IMHO

- sold my softnet (sofn) & put the proceeds into ESG Re (ESREF)
Reason: ESREF’s last 4Q01 earnings release was pretty stellar & should have
moved the stock much higher; instead, it’s even lower. So locked in profits on
SOFN to lower cost basis in ESREF. We’ll see. By the way - deadline for filing
10-Q is 45 days; and 1Q02 ends 3/31/02 - so around mid-May should know

mrcj, "3/31/02" is just the date Softnet (SOFN) plans on making the
announcement on a buyer - but as far as valuations - i'd like to say $13 - but
i'll be happy with half that amount
total curr assets: $79.5 mill
- restricted cash & other non-curr assets: $8 mill
- total liabil: $11 mill
- shs o/s: 25.2 mill
- therefore: $76.5 mill/25.2 = $3.04/share
- then there's the $400 mill in loss carry-forwards; which at 40% federeal is
equivalent to $160 mill; divided by 25.2 mill shs is $6.35/share
- then you have the broadband satellite segment which appears to be doing very
well & can hopefully fetch $100 mill; which is $4 share - then you have certain
intangibles, like the fact that SOFN is NASDAQ listed company - if you add up
each of these, you get $3+6+4=$13+ intangibles

Blankmind,

I'm up about 12% with some lots as much as 17%. I'm still hoping to make more
$$$ on this. I'm thankful for the recommendation --- you mentioned the stock,
and I did my own due diligence. The only thing I'd recommend is that you might
want to avoid potentially aggressive valuation analyses in the future, as
enthusiasm can sometimes sound like hype and discredit your picks.

For now, I am slightly discouraged that I may be the lone wolf on this one, but
it's happened before (MOVI gallery) where I bought and only later did everyone
join the bandwagon. Since my fundamental evaluation of this stock hasn't really
changed between now and a couple months ago, I'm hanging in there.

The market may be telling me that I'm wrong (else SOFN would be rising
recently), but I'm willing to play it out and either make some good $$$ or
learn from my mistake.

realize that the repo man has taken their car away, or the reorganization

Smart and Final is "a foodservice and warehouse grocery company operating 230

Sells below stated book value and at a reasonable (imo) p/s. SMF is sometimes

recovered somewhat from business problems (acquisition, I believe) of couple

The $25M increase in LT debt went mostly to pay down short term borrowings, so
I didn't attach too much importance to it.
Here's what they say in the 10K about their products:
PRODUCTS

The Corporation markets its products under the brand names HANOVER, HANOVER
FARMS, MYERS, PHILLIPS, GIBBS, SUPERFINE, MARYLAND CHIEF, MITCHELL'S, DUTCH
FARMS, SUNWISE, O&C (jarred onions only), SPRING GLEN FRESH FOODS, SUNNYSIDE
FOODS, NOTTINGHAM, BICKEL'S, BON TON, YORK SNACKS, CABANA and DRAPER KING COLE.
The products sold by the Corporation under these brand names include canned
vegetables, beans and pasta as well as frozen vegetables, frozen meat products,
food entrees, refrigerated and fresh foods, canned and frozen mushrooms and
potato chips. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Year Ended June 3, 2001 Results of Operations
Compared to Year Ended May 28, 2000" in the 2000 Annual Report attached hereto
as Exhibit 13 (the "Annual Report").

DISTRIBUTION

The Corporation's products are marketed under its brand labels and customer
private labels to the consumer for home use and also to the food service trade
which includes restaurants, fast food chains, hospitals and schools as well as
military and other governmental uses. The Corporation's ten largest customers
account for approximately 33% of the Corporation's net sales for the fiscal
year
ended June 3, 2001 and 21% of accounts receivable as of June 3, 2001. No single
customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales for the fiscal years ended
June 3, 2001, May 28, 2000, and May 30, 1999. The Corporation's products are
distributed directly to its customers and indirectly via independent
distributors. Sales activities are conducted via Corporation employed sales
personnel and independent sales brokerage firms. The Corporation also

appear to be voting with their feet:

<<It's trading for about 1/2 the value of its cash position.>> Once debt is
subtracted it's closer to parity, but the cash burn is impressive...Net cash
per share will be below parity by the end of Mar Q...unless the shares are
below 4 by then...not an unlikely prospect methinks. Meanwhile the wireless

MRVC, trading at just over $3, said to have book value of $7.52, cash $2.73.
I've only begun to do DD but have found that the company did increase revenues
sequentially last quarter and their fiber optic component division, Luminent,
actually grew it's business 13% sequentially last quarter, something no one
else in the sector can claim. Supposedly, they recently turned down an offer
for Luminent that was a third again larger than MRVC's market cap. It looks
like a potential leader if this strength is any indication. Burn rate is

Circa 1960: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of
production is 4/5 of the price, or $80. What is his profit?

Circa 1970: A logger exchanges a set "L" of lumber for a set "M" of money. The
cardinality of set "M" is 100. Each element is worth one dollar. Make 100 dots
representing the elements of the set "M." The set "C", the cost of production
contains 20 fewer points than set "M." Represent the set "C" as a subset of set
"M" and answer the following question: What is the cardinality of the set "P"
of profits?

Circa 1980: A logger sells a truckload of lumber for $100. His cost of

Hi Folks:

I own REF and this news item appeared today:
http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/020322/222251_1.html

I had a NetNet valuation of 4.22/share when I did my analysis through 9 months
a while back and it was a little higher than that for fiscal 2000.

My question for those who've experienced this type of situation is: "What is a
good strategy from here?" If one were to get another 10% in price from here
(current price is around $3.00), would just cashing in their chips be
considered most prudent or would being patient and waiting for closer to NetNet
be a goal likely to be achieved?

Haven't run across this personally before and enjoy the different perspectives
and clear thinking that is expressed here. Hope you take the time to respond!

REF is an interesting situation.

Seems like a going concern for over fifty years might have value greater than
the sum of its parts.

On a liquidation, it will be interesting to see how the leases factor in.

Item 2. Properties

In May 1999, the Company relocated its corporate headquarters and creative
studios to a newly constructed facility encompassing
approximately 30,000 square feet. These premises, which are located at The
Hudson River Pier, 115 River Road, Edgewater,
New Jersey, are occupied and used as the corporate offices and creative studios
for the Company and its domestic subsidiaries,
other than Refac Financial Corporation ("RFC"). The lease for these new
premises terminates in November 2009 and the
Company has two successive five-year renewal options.

In connection with this relocation, the Company terminated, without liability,
its lease for its corporate offices in New York City
and subleased the offices and studio previously occupied by Refac
HumanFactors-ID (10,000 square feet located at 575 Eighth
Avenue, New York, New York) for the remaining term of the lease. In February
2000, Refac David Morris Creative (acquired in
November 1999) also relocated to this facility and terminated its Jersey City,
New Jersey lease encompassing 3,000 square feet
without any liability. In October 2000, RL also relocated its operations to the
corporate headquarters and creative studios and
terminated, without liability, its lease for approximately 1,450 square feet in
Southport, Connecticut.

RFC leases office facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada, which it considers to be
suitable and adequate for its present needs.

I don't think the lease will be much of a liability. With property value
increases at current levels, and the building being a new construction, I would
suspect a reasonable disposition outcome.

They seem to have taken care of multiple leases in 1999 and 2000 without any
liability (or minimal anyway).

Been looking at BMY...even got a 'wishful thinking' order in at 36. I'm
increasingly leery of pharma's...as is the market. Their R&D approach's seem to
have played out...like an overworked mine verses Biotech development
strategies. As such, it's increasingly difficult for the big pharma's to outrun
patent expirations sufficient to deliver on growth expectations. Then there's
the regulatory risk...not just Hillary redux, but on a number of fronts there's
pressure to give the product away.
Specific to BMY, I'm concerned about the Imclone/Erbitux mess in 2 ways: 1) The
whole thing has been so badly mishandled as to raise real questions about
management competence and, 2) I won't be a bit surprised if the whole Erbitux
thing proves out to be fraud [Looked at Imclone when it sold off - ran across a
NYT article that convinced me Waksal is a weaselly wascal].
That said, BMY does appear to be selling at favorable valuation based on
current estimates - I'm just not sure the margin of safety is adequate given
the above. When Merrill and others have it rated Neutral, despite optimistic
bias and historically favorable valuation, I suspect lack of confidence in
those estimates.
MCD: I have some and agree that this is a buying opportunity based on premise
that they are fixing quality problems in US by using mystery shoppers [among
other things], and the European Beef concerns have peaked - improvement ahead
on both fronts. Meanwhile Japan's beef concerns are probably peaking or near to
it...and Japan is only 5% of revenues. Not expecting a moonshot, but 2-3 years
from now, I think MCD will have outperformed market 5+%.

A while back I ended up on the mailing list of the fiber optics analysts at a
major Wall Street firm. When the sector was hot they were major cheerleaders;
they reflected none of the skepticism that Sanford Bernstein and others were
putting out then (which proved to be 100% correct).

Once Reg FD cut off their inside access, my main impression of this group's
work product is "blindsided". They react to public pronouncements by the major
FO and networking companies but rarely or never have a useful forward looking
prediction in their periodic updates.

They are constantly surprised by revenue and earnings warnings from the
companies they cover.

I'm sure that the many millions spent on analyst salaries produce some useful
information now and then. On balance, however, I have found doing one's own DD
based on the public filings and publicly available info works as well or better
than the inherent institutional biases in analyst reports.

Here is an idea - instead of just asking analysts if they own a stock they
cover or do investment banking for them, CNBC should pull the analyst's last 10
public calls and post them on the screen to see how many were right.

I bet most would have hard a time batting .300 at best.

The near term situation for BMY stock looks bleak. (The latest problem
according to today's Barron's is that BMY is about to be sued for patent
infringement on one of their important drugs.)

Two years from now though, the situation near term for BMY then may not be

them to perform in the future. Their 10 year track record is great and I like
the intrinsic value of the company.

I also expect to hold for at least a two year period and will average down if
the management still believes they have new drugs in the future. We can sell

Regarding the optics sector, the former Lehman credit analyst Ravi Suria, did
some great work as the sector was selling off...made it clear that 1/2 off was
still no bargain. Generally credit analysts do more credible work,
IMO....partly because they actually have better access to non-public info.
Completely agree that FD has pulled an important crutch from a lot of them. I'm

Well, management is now liquidating the business and its assets, at least they
didn't burn up all the assets and file for bankruptcy.

The pop in price on Friday on heavy (for this company) volume seems to indicate
that there might be some follow through of share price increases. I'm trying to
determine whether I want to sell at a discount to NetNet and, if so, what
discount percentage will not have me second-guessing myself for "leaving money
on the table". Tentatively I'm thinking 15% discount to NetNet, if I can get
it, would be acceptable.

In business liquidations that occur without the pressure of bankruptcy, I would
guess the assets could get better pricing on a sale. Since I have used Graham's
conservative approach to valuing assets, I'm somewhat comfortable in the notion
of what the liquidation should bring.

It is a shame that the management didn't make a go of the enterprise, but at
least they are not squandering the last of the assets.

I thought it was awfully nice of the CEO & CFO to only take a 20% cut (for
anything above $2.63). A lot of management officials have the misunderstanding
that "maximizing shareholder value" is just part of the job -- without a hedge
fund % take. Clearly, as the excerpt states, they are "entitled" to this
additional compensation! :)

"...As an incentive to management to seek buyers for the Company's businesses
and assets on terms that will maximize shareholder value, it has entered into
agreements with Robert L. Tuchman, CEO, and Ray Cardonne, CFO, under which they
will be entitled to an aggregate of 20% of the excess assets available for
distribution to stockholders over and above $10,000,000 or approximately $2.63

so doesn't show up in nearterm multiples. When it goes generic, 80% of that biz
could go out the window fast. If revenues grow @10% over the next 5 years,
Zocor would be a bit over 10% if it were to hit $10B by then. Loss of that
shouldn't jeopardize survival given the visibility and time to prepare, but
growth over coming decade will well below recent history. As the Red Queen told

the basic point of your post...most of the profits are going away in a few

knock-offs at a fraction of the branded drug's price. In all, patents on five

Ron Rudd, i noticed that you follow IVX closely. it appear quite cheap right
now but earnings are coming down. What is the reason for the earnings weakness?
Are there near term catalysts that could drive stockprice up?

I have a mixed investment experience with generics. generics are very cyclical
and earnings can be heavily influenced by approvals of blockbusters. Some of
them have quite a good run for a while but sooner or later all of them seem to
be falling in hole. Is this what is happening right now or are there underlying
problems that I am not aware off?

going...trying to shift more towards the proprietary. Recent reports indicate

be the catalysts...but my schedule got lost in the mail. I just buy it when
it's unloved, like now, and sell it when it's adored...hopefully 1 to 3 years
from now. The case for the generic aspect is the large number of drugs coming
off patent combined with regulators umph to stop major patent extensions for
minor features and legal ploys. The drawback of generics is the margin
characteristics more like a specialty chemical co...except for the initial 6
month exclusivity when they are first. I also like the proprietary transition
strategy as that will eventually lead to higher multiples. Recently my timing
in this group sucks...so if you seek precision look elsewhere.

Off topic discussions on accounting

I was curious to see what the SEC was doing on the issues surrounding
accounting, and ran across this:

http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/accounting2.htm

I listened to the first 15 minutes of the March 4 roundtable discussion before
becoming so bored and disgusted I was no longer able to stomach any more of the
nonsense. Warren Buffet fans are sure to be saddened by how far down the road
of senility the once great man has tottered. When asked if there would be a
benefit to investors to have access to actual tax filings as opposed to being
limited to GAAP filings, his response what that it would be better if CEOs were
to write a letter to shareholders about what they've done in the past year.
When asked if CEOs should be held personally accountable for fraud, he didn't
think that was a good idea either, he figured it was good enough that investors
have the ability to vote against the crooks in proxy statements.

The SEC is a bad joke on tax payers and investors. The public would be better
served by turning enforcement over to the FBI and offering a bounty to agents
able to obtain a fraud conviction.

I also found this on the NASDAQ site today:

http://mktnews.nasdaq.com/newsv2/pullstory_nasd.asp?textpath=D:
\www\Nasdaq\news\35\2002\03\27\200203271719DOWJONESDJONLINE000628.html&usymbol=
999

Another great joke on investors on enforcement actions. I wonder how the public
would react to a news item along the lines of: John Doe consented without
admitting or denying guilt to findings that he burglarized four homes. The
court imposed a penalty of a censure and a bar against burglarizing homes for
six months.

Is there more to your belief of Warren's senility other than the fact that you
disagree with his SEC requirements & letter to shareholder comments? This is a
strong statement to make based upon 1) a disagreement between you and Warren's
opinions, and 2) the fact that Warren is getting older.

I have heard him give recent presentations/interviews and I read Warren/Charlie

My personal opinion is the type of accounting abuse which allowed Enron to take
place is a serious matter. The problem is so wide spread it is almost
impossible to find companies with clean balance sheets or numbers that give any
kind of clue to a company's actual financial condition. PE and book value have
become virtually meaningless as anything other than hype. Countless thousands
of investors watch their investments go to zero in bankruptcies for the simple
reason they made the mistake of trusting the way assets were treated under
currently allowed GAAP practices. Under the circumstances, for someone like
Warren Buffet to be trusted with the honor and responsibility of serving in the
capacity of an advisor, and to listen to the half witted garbage he spewed in
the roundtable discussions, disgusts me. His comments turned what should have
been a serious discussion on grave issues into a field day for fools.

Thank you for posting those round table discussions. I've listened to Buffett
announce the BOD firing of the CEO of Gillette. I've heard him on a cc for
Aegis Realty in which he chewed out management for making decisions that are
not in the interest of shareholders. I don't detect any change in his style,
approach, voice, or intellect.

His comments remind me of the Einstein quote: "Everything should be made as
simple as possible, but not simpler."

Seems to me that Buffett has always stressed the fact that accounting is the
language of business (and derivatively investing). My take-home message is not
only what he said, but what he didn't say. The cool thing about him is that he
consistently lays out his investment strategy. In this instance, I invert - ie,
avoid wasting time on companies that don't behave his way. In fact, if you
parlay 'the bat on the shoulder', with the '20 punch ticket', and the details
from his partnership days, you simply can't underperform the market.

I would enlarge on your observation that "The SEC is a bad joke on the tax
payers and investors" to say that the government is a bad joke. And knowing
that, I would rather ask Mr. Market to do the disciplining, rather than trying
to find smart FBI agents. The job of an investor is to avoid situations that
are flawed or don't make sense. This raises the cost of capital for bad
enterprise. As one of the panelists said: you can't legislate morality.

Hi all,

I did not listen to roundtable, so my comments are
second-hand.

With that in mind, I disagree with Buffett quote that
everything should be left to CEOs to explain in their
letter even assuming that you would only invest in companies
whose CEOs you trust.

Unfortunately, like someone on this thread (or
Buffettology) said some time ago, we are not Buffett,
we do not meet CEOs and we do not know if we can
trust them. So we do need to have hard
numbers on the paper and not just CEOs letter.

LauA says: "avoid wasting time on companies that don't
behave his way". Unfortunately again, I know exactly
two companies that behave HIS WAY: BRK and Wesco.
And both are not exactly bargains. Even more, both
fail Warren's other criterium: understandability.

If anyone has suggestions of good companies with
trusted management on the level of Warren that are also
cheap, let me know.

Bob,

Assuming Warren hasn't gone off the deep end, then his comments were
intentionally disingenuous. It seems likely someone with broad based exposure
to the market would make a sincere effort to derail any changes with the
potential to have a broad based impact on the market. It also seems likely a
CEO of a publicly held company would automatically be against accepting a
higher level of personal legal responsibility for his actions. I suppose it's
possible he still has his wits about him and is just another big ticket con man
with his hands in a lot of people's pockets.

Jurgis,

I'm in a dry-spell right now finding companies. I've been reduced to 'special
situations'. Plus longterm stuff. And lots of cash.

You say: "I know exactly two companies that behave HIS WAY: BRK and Wesco. And
both are not exactly bargains."

I have to say that during the last two years I bought BRKb's under $1400/share
- my average is on the order of $1500-1600. WSC was selling below $200/share. I
bought most in the low 200's. I got some WPO in the 470's.

During the past year it has been possible to buy AXP, G, GLK, GMT, and HMSV at
prices comparable or below that last paid by Buffett/Simpson. Charlie will tell
you that if you want to shoot fish in a barrel, it's a good idea to let some
water out of the barrel. 9/11 certainly spilled a lot of water. I hope that
Charlie doesn't mind my shooting in his barrel.

Of course, you need the numbers. But you need hard numbers. And it's alot
easier for folks like me to have the CEO point out the numbers to focus on.
These days I look at annual reports for the shareholder letter, and to see how
much it looks like a sales document. I will compare the CEO letter from year to
year to see if it is insightful or misdirecting. I pay attention to the proxy.
But I read the K's and Q's. (It was interesting to me that Buffett said in the
roundtable that he reads a K and several Q's daily. My take is that he's
reading the same stuff we are, and he's focused. Not a Peter Lynch who used to
brag about taking hundreds of filings home for reading each weekend.)

FWIW - to show you how low I've sunk - yesterday I bought CPQ and shorted HWP
to capture the 9-10% spread - assuming that the merger goes ahead in a couple
of weeks. The MA uses 'buying power' generated by a boat anchor position of
BRKb's.

I don't think you will often be able to buy companies with a Buffett-type CEO
at a cheap price, maybe a fair price, but not cheap.

Right now I think that someone buying a drug basket containing MRK, SGP, and
BMY will do OK. Talk about big and confusing! But their internal rates of
return are good. Demographics are on their side. MRK is one of only 9 or 10 AAA
rated companies in the market.

If you listened to webcasts of EK's CFO Brust during the past 6 months, you can
believe him or not. I chose to believe him when Mr. Market was dissing. I
thought he was describing the operation of a buggywhip company much the same
way Munger has recommended such be run. We'll see.

Listen to the last GLK cc. Check out cash flows for the past couple of
quarters, and correct the balance sheet for the OSCA buyout.

I was very pleased with the operation and communications from Utilities, Inc.
The amiability and logic of their president from several telephone calls caused
me to make a serious investment. Since they seemed pleased to sell the company
to Nuon, I followed onto NCEB.

As Paul Senior knows, I like the folks at UNAM. I've chosen to believe them.
The numbers look awful, but when they take you by the hand, it seems OK. If you
like micro family-run insurance companies.

Or BRID, if you like micro family-run food companies. It's not going to blow
your socks off, but the dividend softens the blow, and downside risk is limited
by stock buy-backs. But this is one where you have to beware of their printed
stuff. They like to talk about 'successes' with big-box retailers, when they
are getting hosed by one truck jerky-jobbers in the convenience store market.
They are honest and hard-working, but the Bridgford name ain't Coca Cola.

Good luck with Easter Eggs

Agreed.

I did not ask for what Buffett bought. I asked for
companies with management on the level of Buffett.
None of these are. :-( It's enough to spend one
glance at AXPs CEO's pay to ascertain that.

Actually, I can repeat:
"Except of BRK and WSC there are no such companies".
And even inside BRK things break once in a while -
see Buffett's comments on GenRe.

Yeah, like you said, there are opportunities to invest
and make money. I am invested 100% myself.

But I would say that Buffett is
disingenuous if he believes that any companies can
achieve his standards of business conduct. Maybe he
realizes this, because he tolerates in his
investments the same things that he criticizes in his
letters. Stock options? Sure, look at AXP, GMT. Complicated,
impossible to understand off-balance-sheet entities?
Sure, look at KOs relationship with its bottlers.
GMT also looks complex.
Management originated ego-mergers? Sure, look at G and
KO - Buffett stopped KOs acquisition of Quaker though.
High debt levels? AXP, G, GMT. Negative ROE? GLK.
Low insider ownership? All of them.

I don't think these are reasons not to invest in companies
above. Actually, I have looked at them and will look at
them again. All I am saying that I would not buy any of them
on the belief that their management is of the same
quality as Buffett. And even if I would buy them, I would
not "buy and forget" as I could do with BRK or WSC.

Historically pharmas had ROE in >30-50% range.
Did anyone consider a scenario where ROEs fall to 20%
range? It is not pretty. Changing future ROE from
35% to 20% for MRK, BMY and SGP drops their
expected annual returns from ~15% to ~1-3% (!).

Why should such drop occur? Hmm. 30-50% ROE range is
impossible to sustain unless company is a monopolist
and even then there is a ceiling for the company/market
size. So there are two risks:
- losing monopoly (oligopoly) due to patent expiration or
government regulations
- growing up to market size ceiling

The first one is definitely a risk. The second I did not
try to calculate. Comments?

Pharmas do look attractive here, but there is a risk too.

Hey Paul, does SLR qualify as a value investment yet. They were downgraded by
Moodys for their debt but
SLR debt is not an issue in my opinion. They reported Debt to cap
ratio of 39%. But the ACES mandatory convertibles are really equity so the debt
to cap is
30%. JBL is 20%. And debt net of cash is in the teens. And debt net
of cash and inventory which is take or pay is 0. They had 1 bill in
cash flow from operations this quarter and will continue to very cash
flow positive. So the whole problem is revenues. SLR and JBL revs for next
quarter also projected flat but they have announced a lot of new business which
they need to improve their metrics . For example JBL revs flat But it was seen
better because of its
cost metrics are so much better. Inventory turns over double SLRs at
4.5 versus 9 for example. DSO for JBL at 40some days versus 64 for
SLR. Gross margins 50% better then SLR. SO SLR needs revs badly to increase
their run rate of 3 bill as the SGA their is 7.5% which eats up all their
profits but they have announced new revs coming of 1 bill per quarter which
should be accretive but they are ramping slowly and wont be fully ramped till
end of 2203 per cc. Maybe the market though will
see this and bid them up on expectation of future now that balance
sheet is OK. They are at book value right now.

I can posit lots of things like that. In certain measure, Mr. Market already
has. Which is why the companies are looking attractive.

The way I see it, there are a handful of big, drug houses with full-scale sales
forces, academic affiliations, lobbiests, etc. When a biotech start-up gets
something interesting, they partner with one of these big guys to market it. So
I look at the big Pharmas as marketers more than innovators.

These three are beaten up. I don't know which one is going to turn, most or
soonest. Hence, the drug basket approach.

Is there a ceiling? I don't really know. I do know that as people get more
assets, the harder they cling to the planet. In all countries. I see more
people. I see more people getting older. I see more older people willing to
spend more on drugs.

It's not a slam dunk, but what do you expect when you're competing against a
worldwide coterie of very smart analysts with gajillions of investment dollars
at their disposal? I generally prefer tiny, tiny situations where the big guys
can't get in, and the playing field is more level. Sometimes I know more than
even the analysts in these situations. Problem is often one of liquidity. You
have to be willing to sit on something for a long time without being able to
sell. Another problem is that once you find something like that, it's often too
small to post on a board like this. I can tell you it works because over the
past 6 months I've enjoyed a bunch of buyouts eg, LIQB, MDII, KRSC, HIPC. I've
also endured a cram-down like PRES.

The admirable thing about Buffett is that over the years he has told us exactly
the tests an investor must apply to average 15-20%/year returns. It's all right
there in his letters. Sure, it requires a lot of work. And sure, great
investments come rarely. ----Keep taking pitches because you only have 20
swings.

BTW, you are absolutely right that AXP, GMT, and GLK are tough to analyze de
novo. I cheated here by assuming that Buffett+Simpson have done their homework.
I looked to see if the underlying business had materially changed for the
worse, and determined a price that feels good to me.

I ask you how hard is it to buy HMSV which was an 83% subsidiary of MEC (ie,
reported on MidAmerican's income statement, and mentioned in Buffett's 2002
shareholder letter), at the time the Fed was dropping interest rates and
homeowners were busy swapping houses (according to the local newspapers in the
HMSV service areas), and Mr. Market was pricing the stock as a dot.bomb because
company name was Home Services.com, even though it actually is a real estate
brokerage roll-up, giving them the #1 or #2 realtor in each of their market
areas? (And how annoying is it to have been bought out at a price lower than
that recommended by the outside directors?)

>Is there a ceiling?

Is a very important question. When people realized that
there is a ceiling for some technology companies,
they got beaten down much more than MRK and co. are now.
And I am not talking about dot bombs. I am talking
about EMCs and CSCOs that had margins similar
to pharmas in their heyday. If you looked at CSCOs
ROE history, you would see that trouble started much
earlier than 2000-2001 crash. It started with
ROE dropping from 30s to 20s in 1997! If similar situation
occurs to pharmas, only one shoe has dropped yet.

Of course, pharmas will not have to write down $1B of
inventory, nor they will have 40% drop in revenue
(maybe?). However, they are still priced for ~30% ROE,
which may be a good assumption or may be not.
