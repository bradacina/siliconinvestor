=====================

Mr. Womack did make a "market time" in that he believed stocks were cheap
enough at a point in time such that he entered the market. And again he made a
"market time" when he sold those stocks because he believed they were
fully/fairly valued.

Was he a "market timer" though? Was he buying stocks when they were going up,
or just because they were going up, or selling stocks--- esp. value stocks,
just because they were going down? No. So he wasn't a market timer, in my view.

He apparently held cash as part of an investing strategy. Is that market
timing? Maybe. I say no though because it's not inconsistent with value
investing.

In my view, selling out of value stocks now, when the market is low, and just
going to cash, is market timing, if you believe the markets are going lower.
It's making a call on the direction of the market, thus market timing. Is this
wrong?

I am trying to watch my pejoratives about market timing/market timers. People
will do what they need to do and what works for them. If somebody's makeup is
that they do well as a market timer, good for them. Being a market timer's okay
if that's your thing. (Don't do it on this thread though -g-)

Value investing or not/market timing or not -- regardless -- it's a very scary
time out there.
If somebody says they are a value investor and sells now and goes to cash from
fear -- fear they've already lost too much money, or fear they are about to
lose money (making a call that the market/their stocks might be going lower),
that's certainly understandable. Otoh, value investors often buy when stocks
are down or something's wrong with a particular company - and where things
might get worse for a while. Imo, being a value investor means part of the deal
is that you get the pain and the fear. It has to be endured until the stocks
rise or else the stocks are sold for relief.

Re: ConAgra Foods, Inc. (CAG)

Followed you in for a small tracking position in CAG. This is one I missed when
you first bought it at $22.5/share. I will throw this one into my AG basket
which is under water by 8% since I started to keep track of the trades. I
measure my performance against the PowerShares Global Agriculture Port(ETF),
(NASDAQ:PAGG). The index is up 8.9% in last five trading secessions.

I have some stocks in my AG basket that go back to 2008. I believe as I
actively manage the basket like I do with my E&P basket, I will be better at
weeding out the loosers and averaging up on the winners.

My AG basket holdings are as follows:

All but ULTR, AMHPF, & FBR sell at a PE less than 11. The blended dividend
yield is around 3.5%. ULTR, OME & AMHPF do not pay any dividend. The AG basket
represent 6% of the total portfolio. My goal is to build the basket to 10% of
the portfolio as value opportunities present themselves.

For reference my E&P basket represents 8% of the portfolio. My preferred stocks
represent 12% of the portfolio.

Hi Paul -

I will pass on AGM. It's not a pure play for me as it reall is not an AG Food
related stock. If you do run a cross a value AG play that I can add to my
basket, please post. My Brazil AG related companies are getting crushed.

ULTR reported earnings (a loss after some one time adjustments) was a bit
disappointing as I thought this would be the quarter they would surprise with a
gain.

<u>Ultrapetrol Reports Financial Results for Second Quarter 2011</u>
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Ultrapetrol-Reports-Financial-pz-3299736095.html?
=0&.v=1

From the article:"...Adjusted net loss for the second quarter of 2011 was
$(6.0) million or $(0.20) per share, which excluded a $(1.0) million provision
or $(0.04) per share, for unrealized foreign exchange rate gains on U.S.
dollar-denominated debt of our Brazilian subsidiary in the Offshore Supply
Business. Net loss for the second quarter 2011 was $(7.0) million or $(0.24)
per share, as compared with net income of $0.7 million, or $0.02 per share,
during the same period in 2010....".

Some of the issues (summarized by a knowledgeable poster on the Yahoo Board)
include: The PSV fleet had a bunch of dry docking in the quarter, which both
costs you revenue as the ships are out of service and costs you money for the
dry docking. There were also likely some costs related to receiving and the
start of repositioning the newly received PSV. <u>The River business clearly
was heavily impacted by the closure of the upper Parana for half the
quarter.</u> This is a business that is very sensitive to scale effects and I
suspect that killed the margin in the quarter. The good news is that the
tonnage still has to be transported, so hopefully this is just shifting
earnings into Q3 and Q4. Also they are experiencing delays with the Indian
yard. I imagine that ULTR will be getting penalty money due to the delays.
Since there is a lender involved in financing these ships, there has to be a
completion guarantee from a creditworthy third party (usually a large bank).
That means that if the yard ultimately fails to deliver, ULTR and its lender
will get their money back.

I am holding to my current position but do not plan on adding any new shares.
The company has invested a lot of money into both their River Business (w/ a
new Port Facility Yard w/ several construction jobs scheduled) and in their PSV
fleet, totaling over half a billion in new assets.

I am underwater on ULTR w/ my average cost at $4.88/share. I still see this
stock getting back to $12.00/share once their PSV fleet is fully brought in
service and the scaled up River Barge Business is fully utilized especially
their new port facility . It could be 6 to 8 months before the FCF starts
flowing from both of these business divisions. Increasing FCF could last for
several operating seasons. Their operations are not dependent on the Global
Economy and should be more affected on Soybean consumption which I see as a
steady YOY grower.

I have Buys at higher levels (a few shares at $6.00,$8.00 and $9.00 basis) and
may sell those shares and replace them in 31 days with current lower price
shares. The stock will probably not move too much until their 3rd or 4th
quarter report.

That comes out to $5.2B in cash. That's a lot of money. Perhaps they have other

ULTR is just a terrible business, imo. Lot's of capital needed, mediocre
management ( at that is how it looks to me, based on their execution), impacted
by weather, weak balance sheet with lot's of debt.
I don't think they should even be in the worldwide offshore supply business,
they lack scale, have to compete against much larger and very well financed
players and they are at a disadvantage in terms of cost of capital (high
Brazilian interest rates). Also, based on my experience, the barge business
almost never has high profit margins to begin with, it's sort of like the
trucking business. Rails are better since they own their transport ways, so
competition is less.

Also forget about ships making up the lost volume, this is only going to happen
to a small extend. I believe that Paul at some point mentioned a Brazilian
railroad and shipping business. That is a better one to look at, if you are
interested in Brazilian infrastructure plays.

re Shane - some nice business to look at - thanks for posting.

re NEU - I like the lubricant business.It has some nice long term growth, good
margins, somewhat but n ot extremely economy sensitive (the wheels needs to be
greased even if they are turning less) and a few companies owning the market.

Fuchs Petrolub is German company that I sadly never owned but have followed on
and off forever. they IPO'd some time in the 80's and always paid generous
dividends. Their business generates a lot of FCF so they can expand organically
and with acquisitions and over time they build an impressive business. This is
the kind of stock that you can tuck away, probably over decades and end up with
a very valuable stake. I believe that Warren Buffet noted these characteristics
and that is why he bought Lubrizol for about 11-12x earnings.

A similar business (more capital intense) si the industrial gas business, which
benefits from many growth angles and particular technology, has few competitors
and often their customers or hooked in since they run the plants on customer
premises or own the distribution or the product are customized for application
(technical gases are an example).

FWIW, I have bought a similar business (parrafins and lubricants) on the
Japanese exchange 5018.T, Moresco Corp. - trading at around 740Yen, earnings
~110Yen, 25 Yen dividend. I am also looking at some industrial gas companies in
Japan but have not bought yet - the US companies are too expensive now.

good point. I looked at the trends through the 2008 collapse and earnings and
returns held up decently. a little sag, but not as much as I might've expected.
It actually compares favorably to Lubrizol in many respects imho.

My history with Basic Materials type companies is not good - I've shied away
from cyclicals to a large degree because other people see the cycles turning
before I do and many of them have deep swings, but alot of those are on my list

started playing the fool. The WHX article was written by someone else.

Even using a zero growth projection, I see SVU as a possible three-bagger. @3x

re SVU - yes they trade at low FCF multiple, but adjusted for debt, their
EV/EBITDA (the quickest way to calculate leverage adjusted valuation) of 4.4 in
not much lower than KR 5.2 (KR is better positioned) or SWY 4.6. Because of the
large debt load it's actually much more expensive on that measure than BBY
(EV/EBITDA ~2.6). ALl of these have their own set of issues.

While SVU debt has been shrinking, so have their revenues and margins - the
company delevers byt selling of business. this can go to the point where all
the benefits acrue to the debt holders and nothing is left for the equity.

SVU for me starts to trade like an option, if they can turn the business
around, the equity slice will become much more valuable. Right now though, the
company is shrinking and becomes less valuable - the debtholders are OK because
they get slowly paid back , but at the current rate, ti will take 6-7 years to
extinguish the debt and who knows what the situation looks then.

In addition to above there are unions to content with that want their slice
too, especially if the company starts to look better. As I see it, the
shareholders are at the bottom of the trough - there is a shrinking business -
and we have debtholders and unions that want to be fed first, before the
shareholders. As it stands, I would not be surprised about another dividend cut
as well. See the newspaper business over the last ten years to find out how
this plays out.

As a levered name, but with less structural issues, I have started to look at
OI again. They trade at 6x EV/EBITDA and there is some asbestos liabilities on
top of that 500-800M$ is my estimate. it's not terrible cheap but it is a
decent business with a global footprint, that is in no danger to go away. my
guess is that they will need 2 more quarters to fix the operational problems
(my guess is that the fixes that they talked about in the last CC will increase
costs first). This business should be able to grow in the single digits and
generate 300M$ in FCF

We discussed OI before on this thread, it's now 40% cheaper:

Hello Jurgis,

<if I could find a closed-end fund that paid 6-8% for me to wait for a
correction (and then not fall with the correction), I would put a good
percentage of my portfolio into that and just wait. But, I'm not sure if such
an investment exists.

No, it doesn't. But if someone finds it, please let me know. :)>

Well, I didn't find exactly what we're looking for, but I've been adding a
small amount to ETJ as it's close. Basically, ETJ is a closed-end fund that
owns equities, owns a lot of put options on the indexes out 3 months or so,
sells calls against the indexes and also does some selling of puts of
individual stocks to accumulate new positions it seems. Anyways, they haven't
done well from a stock perspective at all the last year (and I didn't start
buying until the last few weeks). Their NAV performance was been pretty even at
(0.48%) in 2010, 5.68% in 2009, (1.17%) in 2008, and 7.38% in part of 2007 when
it looks like the cef started.

So, I guess my play here is that the premium/discount has gone from a premium
of over 6% to a discount that is now around 13% which seems to be the
historical discount low. So, what I'm trying to do is to put some money that I
would normally put into a yield instrument and put it into ETJ with the view
that maybe the managers can eak out a few NAV % this year and/or the discount
will revert to a historical mean from a historical low. I don't expect this to
do anything seriously up this year, but I think it's a decent defensive play
for a decent yield in comparison to treasury/preferred yields on a risk/reward
basis. The risk here is that the discount continues its plumment, which is
possible.

Just thought I'd throw it out there based on our conversation and I do think
any closed-end selling at a greater than 10% discount is a value to consider.
There are other Eaton Vance cef's that I'm analyzing, but this one is different
than the others.

Thanks,

Grant

re UPL and E&P valuation. I looked at UPL again since the stock price has been
weak after the last earnings call. This was one of the E&P companies (besides
EOG and BGG) that I believed to have means (management, assets) to grow the
reserves organically in the mid teens/year. Based on my framework post, the
organic growth in reserves/share would be the metric to look for.

Ok, right now they are growing but not organically any more. They will do about
800M$ in cash flow but invest 1.35B$ (upped from 1.1B$). They have about 1.75B$
in debt and that will increase, since they invest more than they take in.

I believe it smells like they will do a secondary or sell some assets. Either
way, it looks like they are not going to be able to grow reserves in the mid
teens whithout adding debt. I believe a secondary may be forthcoming because
they mention restrictive loan convenants in their 10Q. The ceiling that they
hit, imo will be that the NPV of the reserves cannot be below 1.75x the debt.
With 1.75B$ in net debt, that is about 3.06B$. The NPV of their reserves per
10k (31 Dec 2010) was 3.5B$ post tax and 5B$ pre tax. if the post tax number
counts, they only have a 15% buffer (assuming everything stays the same) until
they hit the loan convenants. That is very little buffer and I believe this is
why I think UPL either needs to sell assets or raise equity.

On the positive side UPL still performs well operational, their costs are under
control. They also started a new play in Colorado (Niobara proximity) where
they have accumulated 100K acres, probably fairly cheap.

Still the post tax NPV of their properties is 3.5B$ which is way less than
their 7.5B$ EV. Even if you consider that the method to determine NPV
undervalues their long life assets that does not seem like a bargain. On my own
metric, they own 4.4B MCFE in proved reserves (half of those are
underdeveloped), you only pay 1.7$/MCFE. My guess is that nobody can generate
proved reserves fopr 1.7$/MCFE. Based on that UPL seems fairly undervalued.

The real problem is that NG is dirt cheap and selling it for 4-5$/MCFE is not
going to do it for the producers, the ROI is not there. Maybe UPL Niobara
project is going to alleviate that - both CHK and EOG started to go after more
oily stuff a year or so ago and UPL obviously tries the same playbook.

I like UPL management but I believe they are somewhat at the crossroads. Buy or
wait is the question - what does the rest of the thread think?

I chose EOG over UPL because of EOG's oil shale holdings and development.

I don't have enough confidence or knowledge of either of these two to say if
either is a buy now, or to just wait.

My position in EOG is very small and accumulated at higher prices than
currently. If EOG does fall back a bit more I expect I will add a few more
shares. The decision for me is not totally grounded in valuation metrics. It is
somewhat of a speculation and related to how long I expect to hold the stock
--like several years, and my ability to endure losses with it (and other oil
stocks held) until the company's prospects and stock improve, if they do.

Risky to hold either now, I am guessing.

Morningstar ETJ commentary:

"While we are intrigued by this fund's strategy that includes protective put
options, that strategy has restrained the fund's long-term performance. We also
do not like this fund's level distribution plan, which relies heavily on return
of capital. While the covered call strategy can cause a fund to use more return
of capital than a similar fund not using a call overlay, this fund has used it
destructively in the past two fiscal years with little sign of relief. Its
level distribution plan only adds to the pain, and, not surprisingly, the
distribution was lowered from $0.45 per share each quarter to $0.3195 in
December 2010."

That makes ETJ an avoid for me.

Cargill to acquire Provimi in $2.16 billion deal
The Associated Press
Published: Monday, Aug. 15, 2011 - 7:18 am

From the article:"...Cargill will spend $2.16 billion to buy animal nutrition
company Provimi, the agribusiness conglomerate said Monday, strengthening and
expanding its global operations.

The privately held Cargill, which is engaged in a broad array of agricultural
industries, from meat production to grain trading, said that the deal includes
Provimi's global animal nutrition business, which has operations in 26
countries and more than 7,000 employees across Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin
America.

Cargill has more than 130,000 workers in 63 countries.

"This acquisition would mark a significant step in Cargill's animal nutrition
growth strategy and underlines our commitment to continued long term investment
to meet the needs of our customers around the world," Cargill Vice Chairman
Paul Conway said in a statement.

Cargill says the two businesses will complement one another well, as Provimi
has a wide range of premixes, additives and ingredients in its portfolio.
Cargill says its animal nutrition business has expertise in compound feed,
supply chain and risk management issues as well as other areas...."

RE: Seaboard Corp. (SEB)

Company Web Site: http://www.seaboardcorp.com/

Description:

Seaboard Corporation operates as a diversified agribusiness and transportation
company worldwide. Its Pork division engages in hog production and pork
processing; and the production and sale of fresh and frozen pork products, such
as lunchmeat, ham, bacon, sausage, loins, tenderloins, and ribs, as well as
further processed pork products, including raw and pre-cooked bacon to further
processors, foodservice operators, grocery stores, distributors, and retail
outlets under the Prairie Fresh and Daily's brand names. This division also
produces and sells biodiesel from pork and other animal fats to third parties.
The company?s Commodity Trading and Milling division sources, transports, and
markets wheat, corn, soybean meal, rice, and other commodities, as well as
operates flour, feed, and maize milling businesses. Its Marine division
provides containerized cargo shipping service to 26 countries between the
United States, the Caribbean Basin, and central and South America; and operates
a terminal at the Port of Miami, an off-dock warehouse for cargo consolidation
and temporary storage, and a cargo terminal at the Port of Houston for
temporary storage of bagged grains, resins, and other cargo. As of December 31,
2010, it operated 10 owned and approximately 29 chartered vessels; and dry,
refrigerated, and specialized containers and other related equipment. The
company?s Sugar division produces and refines sugar cane, produces alcohol, and
purchases and resells sugar to retailers, soft drink manufacturers, and food
manufacturers in Argentina. Its Power division operates as an independent power
producer in the Dominican Republic operating 2 floating barges with a system of
diesel engines with combined capacity of approximately 112 megawatts of
electricity. Seaboard Corporation also purchases and processes jalapeno peppers
in the United States. The company was founded in 1928 and is based in Shawnee
Mission, Kansas. Seaboard Corporation is a subsidiary of Seaboard Flour LLC.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------

I do like their debt profile at 0.67 LT Debt/Annual Net income and a trailing
PE of 8.6. I will study the company and have added it to my AG watch list. My
first impression is they seem to be too heavy into shipping w/ their Marine
division but it may complement their other services.

The company has a pretty large Market Cap too at 2.9B. You also get a pure play
on Turkey through Butterball, the largest vertically integrated turkey producer

SVU - to respond to you and Clownbuck with my thoughts on SVU:

Debt is being paid off pretty rapidly in my opinion along with continued
opening of Save-A-Lots which are doing well. The dividend could still be cut,
but I was more scared about it earlier in the year than I am now.

My view is that it's true that they're not as cheap from an EV perspective as
they are from a market cap perspective ratio-wise, but they are still on the
cheap side for EV. And if the amount of debt they're paying off each year went
to their market cap as the EV ratio stayed the same, SVU stock would do pretty
well.

I also don't think we need to wait 6-7 years for all of the debt to be paid
off. I don't think all of the debt will be paid off, I think they're just
looking to get debt down to industry norms. As they get closer to industry
norms, I'd hope for svu stock appreciation.

I think that with their recent quarter, they finally got a successful
management move in granting authority toward local premium stores to move
towards local products/deals. But, we'll see how long that maintains.

All this being said, I had a big position in SVU earlier in the year and sold
~10. In the 6's and 7's, I'm considering buying again, but there are lots of
cheap plays around these days and so from a relative valuation standpoint I
feel ok with my reduced SVU position.

Thanks,

Paulson’s Hedge Fund Sells Citi, BofA Shares
By Saijel Kishan - Aug 15, 2011 2:41 PM PT
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-15/paulson-s-hedge-fund-sold-citigroup-bo
a-shares-last-quarter-amid-decline.html

From the article:"...John Paulson, the billionaire hedge- fund manager whose
biggest fund has lost 31 percent this year, sold shares in Citigroup Inc. (C)
and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) in the second quarter.

Paulson & Co. held 33.5 million shares of New York-based Citigroup as of June
30, down from 41.3 million shares in the first quarter, according to a filing
today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The hedge fund held 60
million shares of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America at the end of
the second quarter, compared with 124 million in the first quarter, according
to the filing.

Paulson, 55, who has been betting on an economic recovery by the end of 2012,
scaled back bullish bets after losses this year and told clients in June that
he reduced his stake in Bank of America, which slumped 18 percent in the second
quarter and about 29 percent since then. Financial shares, including Citigroup
and Bank of America, which were among the hedge fund’s biggest U.S. stock
holdings in the first quarter, have been a major part of his recovery bet....".

According to the article Paulson also decreased his stake in Transocean Ltd.
(RIG). He still like Gold though.

It looks like GOOG spent a total of more than 15B$ on patents (assuming MMI
business itself is not worth much). Patents have a lifetime of 20 years, so
assuming that the average patent life left in the portfolio acquired is 15
years, they will have 1B$/year in amortization. of course now that the cash is
already spent, this may count as a "non cash expensive " going forward.

This makes me think that GOOG business is not as good as previously thought, if
they have to work so hard to defend it (assuming the patent purchase is
defensive in nature not offensive).

Actually it's worse (better?) than what you are implying. GOOG is defending its
Android business, which might have a bright future, but it's not clear whether
it's bringing a great deal of ad revenues now. So GOOG main (97% revenue ad)
business does not need defending, which is good. But their next blockbuster

I am cleaning up several of my Brazil holdings, harvesting some losses and
re-establishing a tracking position in GGB. I sold my last lot of GGB in 3/2011
for $13.32 and after a 62% price cut, I started a new tracking position at
$8.20/share today. GGB seems like it is available at a good "value" entry point
at current prices.

I am going to put GGB in my AG basket as they machine wire and products for
farming that include products such as poles, smooth wire and barbed wire.
Gerdau also produces specialty steel for the manufacture of tools and machinery
that are used in the growing Brazil AG sector. Analysts calculate their Forward
PE at 3.95. The company currently pays close to a 2% dividend. Their LT debt to
annual net income ratio of 7x is not too bad for such a large capital intensive
business. Growth from the 2016 Brazil Olympics and the build out of the Brazil
offshore drilling rigs/infrastructure should also support demand for their
steel products.

Partial sales in both VALE and ULTR will allow me to harvest some losses and
reduce my cost basis. I may have the opportunity to buy back these shares in 31
days at lower prices.

UGP could become a potential value Buy for me if the PE comes down a bit in the

shares. My preference for the long term for Brazil are (1) natural resource
companies and (2) Agriculture. Clownbuck also suggested rails but I found no
pure play there. I guess UGP is a possible play on their infrastructure growth
as they do provide multimodal transportation & storage services for bulk fuels
and chemicals at port facilities.

My favorite long term is Vale S.A. (VALE) for their resource play. After my

Too big to fail does not protect equity holders. I agree that if a calamity
were to happen, the french government would step in but you would loose
probably 90% of your equity due to dilution, similar to what happened to
holders of AIG, C or RBS stock. Senior and subordinated debt holders would be
spared (my guess) and preferred holders would share some of the pain.

If one of the major countries (Italy or Spain), the french bank will need a
bailout. Even if not, they may need re-capitalization.

The first rule investing in upheavel is to get out in front of the firing
squad. BNP may end up standing in front of the firing squad of certain things
happen in Europe. I have mentioned others that are similar cheap that don't. I
could well be wrong but that is how I see it.

I added some SU at 32.4$ to my larger DVN starting position. I still like DVN
better but I like SU as a leverged bet for crude with a good risk reward imo.
LT, I see some of the canadian oil sand plays like CNQ, SU etc. getting taken
out by the supermajors.

Short term, my thinking is to gravitate from financial assets into more hard
assets. I like crude because unlike with gold, whatever get's produced also
get's consumed and overall it's going to be harder and more expensive to
replace it.

Bernanke pretty much sold out the US$ when he said that interest rates are
going to be low until 2012. it's becoming more and more a clownbuck <g>. A few
weeks ago, plays like SU were pretty expensive, now they trade at PE ~10. I'd
rather own an asset like SU or DVN with a PE of 10, then a bank with
questionable quality on the asset side with the same PE.

Some banks are probably good bet's like JPM, WFC or PNC. Maybe even BAC is a
good bet, but it's more of a crapshot. My concern with life insurers is that
the low interest rates make it harder for them to meet return targets. how are
they going to earn high single digit returns to meet the return objectives (and
sometimes promises/liabilities like annuities that are on their books) with low
single digit interest rates? It's not possible unless they take risk and that
is not what regulators or customer want either. I have yet to read a analyst or
industry analysis that shows the LT impact on this. Short term, strong bond
prices (=low interest rates) mean rising book value but then what? I don't know
- otherwise I probably would buy some MET, which is the best of the crop and
benefits from the flight to quality, imo.

I disagree with your "clownbuck" thesis, but I don't see a point in discussing

Macro-wise, IMHO Europe (as compared to US and China) right now is closest to a
possible big shock. Greece is likely to default and kicking the can down the
road only gives time for other countries to fix their issues before Greek
blow-up. It's difficult to say how contagious the blow up will be.

Biggest risk in US is another recession. If we get that, oil investments even
at current prices will not hold up. Actually most investments won't hold up
except perhaps WMT and TJX. ;) China won't be enough to keep oil and oil
investments up, since decoupling is a myth and they will also slow on US
recession.

Overall, right now investing in stocks is based on belief in no US recession
and mild crisis in Europe. Prices are lower than in spring, but macro risks are
higher. I am a bull at heart, so I am tempted and trying to put money into
market bit by bit, but I keep getting cash coming from various places (like
closing CSR arbitrage). So overall, I don't think I lowered my cash percentage
in last 10 days. Maybe that's good... :)

re GGB - the stock is cheap by some metrics because their profitability right
not is insufficient. their EBITDA margins are down from 20% in 2010 to 13%. I
compared this wuith class act NUE (which is very low overhead and hence can
prosper with lower margins) which is at 16% for a capital lighter operating
(mini-mills).

I believe that the high real is hurting them and I don't think that this will
abate any time soon. I also think it is a stretch to put GGB into a
"Foodbasket" just because they make some poles or wires for farming. it is
probably a minuscule part of their operations.

I sort of like NUE here - they are beneficiary of the weak US$ a.k. "Clownbuck"
have a strong balance sheet and pay a nice dividend. PKX is worth a shot too.
Both NUE and PKX are probably some of the best steel companies in the world,
available at fairly reasonable prices.

re Oil - if growth in the US and Europe goes to zero and the rest of the world
plugs along, oil might not crumble. For one thing the production numbers from
many major's YOY were fairly bad (I looked at TOT, E, XOM (ex acqusition) etc.)
and seem to indicate supply constraints. Libya is not helping either.

If we get a really deep recession 2008 style, nothing will hold up, including
crude. As for the clownbuck thesis, the currency exchange rates speak for
themselves. Despite the crisis in Europe for example, the Euro is closer to
it's peak than it's bottom and up 15% YOY. Same for Yen, Real, AUD, Yuan and
pretty much any other currency I can think of. I expect more of the same and I
don't like it one little bit.

What do you think of <u>Friedman Industries Inc. (FRD)</u>. This is a very
small steel company I added to my watch list. They reported good earnings and
sell now at an 8 PE. The company produces ERW (Electric Resistance Welded)
STEEL PIPE - Steel pipe for use in the water well industry, steel building
columns, steel pipe piling, water and air lines, metal fabrication, fencing,
road bore, culverts, sign posts and other structural applications. Steel used
for the farm or ranch (well & irrigation pipe, fencing, culverts) also fits my
AG theme.

I choose a few shares of GGB based on price. If FRD drops below $7.50/share I
am tempted to add a few shares. Their dividend is now around 5.8%. Company has
no debt.

Construction company URS. Added to my position 7/14 @$44.16. Today, with stock
down at $33.80, I'll take a little more.

p/stated book = .65. Tangible bv is negative though. Company has been
profitable every year past ten. Generally low roe (usually under 8%). Diverse
construction projects might help cushion some decline if/as govt projects are
reduced. Stock price seems to have anticipated some of that.

E_K_S,

Thanks for sharing this one - looks like a good investment based on FCF basis.
Most recent quarter FCF I've calculated approx. $10.5 million (that includes
decrease in inventories of $5 million, which fluctuates often in either
direction - i.e. in last year's 10-K the effect of increased inventories
decreased cash flow from operating activities by $14.5 million). Do you know
why they paid the special dividend last year? Quick ratio and current ratio are
both almost double their closest competitor - ZEUS.

Revenue doubled last year, hence the higher NI and it seems that the trend
continues in this quarter. Do you know if this is due to expansion or cyclical?

Sorry, I probably asked more questions than provided feedback.

I'm curious to read others' thoughts on this one.

Thanks again.

Hi Difco -

Re: Friedman Industries Inc. (FRD)

It appears that growth is organic specific to their region (ie. Texas). They
are such a small company that most any sustained increase in their sales moves
the meter. I did go through the information they have on their Web site and saw
nothing too out of the ordinary. I do know that Texas is one of a few states
that is experiencing growth so the specialty steel products that this company
provides sells right into the current growth sectors (ie Oil & AG). Maybe part
of their current spike in sales could be related to the sustained drought Texas
is going through. There is always the need for more irrigation pipe, and water
well related piping.

I discovered this company using a value screen on FINVIZ. You can play around
with the variable screen setting(s) and see what other similar types of
companies come up. http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&t=frd

I originally was looking for specialty steel piping companies that service the
growing U.S. Oil & NG shale regions.

The one big problem with FRD is it is a Micro Cap, the stock is thinly traded
and if any large share holder wants out, the stock will sell off until the
shares are absorbed in the market. This has occurred w/ the stock trading down
to $8.00/share from $12.00/share w/i the past 10 trading secessions.

FRD looks good to me on first glance. A small cap value stock paying a good
dividend. They are in Texas which is one of the areas of better long-term
construction prospects than the rest of the country.

Per the Ford Equity summary their last five years (the last being 2011), their
cash flow per share is:

$1.20 $0.82 $2.27 $0.37 $1.48

For a cyclical business they have managed to stay profitable in some difficult
times. They did lose $.02/share for the three months ending June 30, 2009. That
might be their worst quarter. I shall have to look more closely.

Also their share count stays the same, which is good.

Definitely one worth considering.

Fwiw, my heuristic for valuing gold has been one good men's suit for one ounce

I guess that's an obsolete comparison now. Do men even wear suits anymore?
$1,790 for a good suit would seem too expensive to most folks. (Cheap though if
you're a fan of bespoke)

Thanks E_K_S,

I checked on http://insidercow.com/ and no insider buy/sell in the last two and
a half years. For a micro cap there are a lot of institutional investors in it,
which leads me to believe that motivational seller might not have the right
motivations. If the industry starts to consolidate this one might be one of the
first ones to be bought - IMO.

I like NG - your thesis that the pipes will do well I think it's the right one.
They might even do better than the operators. In 2008 I bought TGS,
Transportadora de Gas del Sur SA (ADR) - an Argentine pipeline, but besides a
40% one-time dividend earlier this year, it has stayed at the same levels when
I bought it.

VLO. Decided I will reenter now for few shares.

Price:tangible bv ~= .8. That number's been lower, also higher, in past years.
Although I can't be sure, it seems to me VLO is gaining importance in its
position as the largest independent US refiner.

Besides the usual negative of oil refining margins frequently/usually getting
squeezed and making the sector mostly unattractive, VLO has several ethanol
refineries, and I'm not a fan of corn-to-oil operations.

I did the same with SUN (mostly because of management's positive actions and
the fact that the sum of the parts is greater than the market value, i.e. % in
SXL and % in SXC). VLO is the better company and the Western exposure is a
plus. I absolutely agree that when dealing with small margins you want to be
the largest. I might be wrong, but refineries will pick up with the economy,
whenever that's going to happen.
