Veritas enters the utility game
By Ed Frauenheim
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
June 22, 2003, 11:55 PM PT

Moving beyond its roots as a storage software company and into the utility
computing arena, Veritas Software on Monday introduced a product to manage
server computers.
So-called server provisioning is seen as an initial step toward highly
automated computing systems that act as a service much like electricity.
Veritas' new product is part of the company's evolution from focusing on data
storage management to improving the performance of a broader computer system,
said Bill North, storage software analyst at market research firm IDC. "They
were always at the back end of the equation," North said. "That's no longer
true."

The Veritas OpForce 3.0 product is intended to relieve information technology
departments of manual burdens involved in configuring server computers and to
improve the utilization rates of machines. Veritas' software automatically
detects devices in an IT environment and allows IT managers to automate the
process of reallocating server resources based on shifting demand.

Available July 7, the software supports the Solaris, IBM AIX, Red Hat Linux and
Windows operating systems.

OpForce 3.0 is based on software from Jareva Technologies, a company Veritas
acquired earlier this year. Veritas also has announced plans to acquire Precise
Software, another company whose technology fits in with the utility computing
push. Precise makes software to manage the performance of applications.

Veritas is hardly alone in its utility computing plans. IBM, Hewlett-Packard
and Sun Microsystems also are pitching services that aim to help customers
achieve a more automated computing infrastructure.

North suggested that Veritas' server management software would fare well
against these giants, who also are keen to sell their own hardware products.
"They have a serious ax to grind there," he said. "Veritas has no such ax."

R.E. Simpson. re.: CRED. As you likely know, there are maybe 200 or more small
E&P public companies. Looks to me as if CRED is typical, with the stock
performing typically too (up). I don't see anything unique about CRED other
than maybe its Rocky Mountain presence. Maybe somebody else here can provide
more significant comments- I'm far from being knowledgeable about these stocks.
I'd say you might get an expert opinion (or at least a comment from somebody
who's E&P knowledgeable and has studied the stock in some detail) if you asked
on the Big Dog's Boom Boom Room thread. I don't know enough to be either
positive or negative about CRED.

Checking over my radar screen and Bell Industries jumped out only because its a
Berkshire Hathaway holding and somewhat of a strange pick for that company. I
Learned about this one on the Berkshire Hathaway Yahoo message board some time
ago. The 2002 proxy lists Warren E. Buffet owning 5.4% of the company -- the
Berkshire thread speculated it was a Lou Simpson pick.

BI is currently selling at about net current assets.
Insiders purchased 100,000 shares in February and March, 2003, not that that's
any big deal as the stock was trading at $1.60 per share back then.

Thanks Bob!

I've been antsy for the last week or so about the price of ACKHQ and had wanted
to get out on Monday at $1.12 but the order never executed because the stock
retreated to $.95 and that was too low for me to consider. Then, yesterday when
I saw the pop I pounced. Since the pop was on tremendous volume, I would not be
surprised to see this move upward continue for the stock, but I have learned
that when I get nervous about an issue, I get out.

I also got out because I could no longer compute what "fair value" was for me
(hence the root of the nervousness). Whatever number I had derived back in
December was probably impacted by revisions to the reorg plan and I didn't have
time (nor, frankly, the inclination) to recompute based on the new plan.

I'm happy with the returns and will look around for other opportunities.

Thanks again!

Anybody else been selling here? In the last several weeks I've been raising

It's difficult, but I'm tempted to sit on the sidelines for a while.

Mark Hulbert
ANNANDALE, Va. (CBS.MW) -- What are buying climaxes?

I'll give you a clue: They're not good, and there were a record number of them
last week.

A buying climax, according to Michael Burke, editor of Investors Intelligence,
occurs when a stock makes a new 52-week high and then closes down for the week.
"Buying climaxes are often the first sign that a hot stock is running out of
steam and therefore provide not only a useful warning signal for a coming
change in trend but very often signal the top itself. Buying Climaxes are a
sign of distribution."

That's what makes the stock market so precarious at current levels, in Burke's
opinion. According to his calculations, in the week ending Friday, June 20,
there were 325 buying climaxes, which is "well above anything previously seen."

The previous record came in May 2002, when 223 buying climaxes were recorded in
a single week. That came just prior to the Dow Industrials ($INDU: news, chart,
profile) plummeting from above 10,000 to its July low below 7,500.

Prior to May 2002, the previous record was 150 buying climaxes. That number was
recorded in late May 2001, which turned out to be very close to the stock
market's high for that year.

For value investors, market timing like that is irrelevant. Dips can be used to
start or add to positions in stocks with good fundamentals. But which way the
herd runs on a given day is for the scalpers to worry about.

Did you ever see a quote from Buffett saying the market was a bit overextended
today? Me neither. He may think this quarter or this year is not a good time to
buy stocks, but that's a whole other ball game.

Hi Guys !

Im back after a long suspension by the old moderator who apparently liked pump
& dumpers more than those who expose them.

Anyway, I still have some EBSC although I started buying at prices in excess of
the $6, I guess I am glad to get an endgame, but I do feel they are TRYING to
screw us.

The ONLY reason why the bidding wasnt opened up and a real auction began was
because the insiders wanted a sweatheart deal for themselves.

It makes me question EVERYTHING thats happened over the last few years.

Have they purposefully kept the price down to benefit themselves ?

With interest rates being so low and the net current assets so high, this deal
will finance itself.

Still, it HAS to make more sense for a larger chain.

The big question now is what kind of break-up fee will the insider group get if
a higher offer does come ? That is money RIGHT OUT of shareholder pockets.

As for fairness opinions, if you pay an investment banker enough he will tell
you a $50 offer for a $100 bill is fair.

This thing STINKS to me. But, it requires a 2/3 of shareholder vote so they
wont win if the majority feel as screwed as I do.

I would have hoped Summers would have responded by now. He has had all day !

But, as I mentioned on the yahoo board before, he hasnt really had a look
inside so he is playing handicapped.

I wonder if he was REALLY interested or his offer was just to entice management
to up their offer ?

Welcome back!

I believe that until the deal gets to be over $7.50/share or so, it'll be an
all cash offer, so I'm willing to hold onto EBSC and get the cash. At
$6.00/share, being a late comer to the game I only make 16% on my purchase
price. I'm happy with that for a year's worth of returns in this kind of
market. I've owned the stock about a month or so at this point and cash offers
get approved and paid out quickly (usually).

I'm hoping the thrashing in the water draws the interest of a bigger predator.

 I'll take a little FRE here. I will assume that the bad news is out. 
I have also been looking at FRE and here is what i see:

Numbers per 2002 annual report:
Mortgage assets: 1140 B$
Pre tax earnings: 6.3 B$ - this is a return of .6% on the total equity. FRE
lives off the .6% interest margin it earns over its cost of capital:
Shareholder capital: 20 B$

FRE is profitable because of the small margin it skims of the mortgages it own
and its underwriting business. Return on equity is high because of the 50x
leverage even with an interest margin of only .6% (well managed banks have an
interest margin of 1.2-1.5%).

Besides the small margin I also don't like the fact that it owns a large part
of the mortgage assets it issues and guarantees - this may result in apositive
feedback loop (mortgages go up)as long as it buys but in negative one if it
sells.
The meager margin means that FRE is very sensible with respect to the cost of
capital. My guess is that FRE does not deserve a AAA credit rating without the
implied treasury guarantee. How much would the earnings fall if FRE were
downgraded to AA? This is not a business I want to own even though I think the
fallout from the accounting issues will be limited, i think the political
issues may not.

Paul, I am not impressed if that list is the best they can come up with.

With respect to homebuilders, CTX was at a trailing P/E of 4 in early 2000,
after the Fed's many rounds of rate increases. Now it is at 9 on boom-level
earnings.

With respect to insurance companies, I would worry what will happen to returns
on their substantial invested assets (an important part of earnings, I believe)
from past interest rate reductions, let alone ones which would occur from any
steps by the Fed to force down long term rates (their most likely next strategy
to help the economy). For some companies, very low rates could actually be
dangerous. Insurance companies can have contractually guaranteed rates built
into policy pricing (e.g., life insurance and annuity) in excess of returns we
could see, that could become a catastrophic problem. Guaranteed Investment
Contracts became such a problem for a few insurance companies a number of years
ago, in the very high rate days. However, those contracts never represented the
proportion of assets that life insurance and annuity are. I would significantly
underweight insurance companies now as I consider this issue as potentially
dangerous and very tough to assess (and I am an actuary by training).

Note that Group Insurance companies covering primarily medical/dental, HMOs,
and many Fire & Casualty carriers are less exposed to this issue, because they
have a smaller proportion of invested assets relative to premium income, and
typically have only one year rate guarantees.)

OT (long): Battle of the stock pickers. Paul S. vs. other value players:

Over the past several years I've had discussions here and other threads with
several people about some of their specific picks vs. what I have considered to
be comparable but superior choices. Some of these stocks have subsequently been
sporadically discussed. Here's an update in performance regarding some of the
stocks that I recall:

MBIA vs. ABK (Jim Clarke pick)

ABK seems to have been the better choice here,

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=abk&k=c1&t=5y&s=mbi&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

No matter whether it's a 5-year, 2-year, 1-year, 6-mo. time frame comparison.
Somewhere after about the 3rd year of ABK being mentioned here, I acknowdged
this and started a small exploratory position. Shoulda/coulda/dint buy more,
esp. when ABK (or MBI) was at lows.

LNY vs. RARE and/or STAR (Burry pick?). All looked good, but I chose LNY
because there were already many steakhouse chains extant. Seafood, being more
perishable (assuming not all frozen), I figured was more difficult to manage,
so I believed seafood houses had a higher barrier to entry. Nevertheless, RARE
& STAR have turned out to be the better performers.

As is typical, it depends a great deal on when these stocks were bought.
Looking at the five year comparison charts, it appears that LNY has only held
its own while the other two have moved up:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=star+rare&k=c1&t=5y&s=lny&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

Actually these stocks were first discussed last quarter '98, so individual
charts show performance much better:

RARE's gone up about six fold:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=rare&d=c&k=c1&t=5y&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

STAR's multiplied about 3-4 times:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=STAR&d=c&t=5y&l=on&z=b&q=l

LNY's multiplied about three times:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=rare&d=c&k=c1&t=5y&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

STAR doesn't look too bad to me even now: Under book value, no ltd, strong buy
recommendations from analysts. 15x '03 earnings est. is high but comparable to
other stocks in the sector. I'm now looking at LNY as a growth stock, and added
just a bit to my position.

ZQK vs. ANF (Jim Clarke buy)

ANF has been the better performer. Probably more so than this chart shows.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=zqk&k=c1&t=6m&s=anf&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

I trimmed back my ZQK position and bought ANF after ANF was discussed (on
Buffettology thread). I'm considering adding a bit more to my ANF position even
now.

VLGEA (timing play). Long-term buyer/holder (me) vs. Dale Baker (take short
term profit, out for better opps. elsewhere). (note: doing this from memory.
May not have facts/motivations right).

Added to my position @$24. Dale Baker may have exited at that time. I had my
chance for the big (%) profits:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=VLGEA&d=c&k=c1&a=v&p=s&t=2y&l=on&z=m&q=l

Still holding though. (oops). I can't give it up now: Under stated book, debt
-- but lots of cash too. Low p/e.

Ah cripes. I see as I go through my screens more carefully, I got a ton of
these comparisons I could write about. And I seem to be getting beat up on
almost all them. lol. MLS vs. CPG

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=cpg&k=c1&t=5y&s=mls&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

RCRC (Clarke, later Grommit) vs. JAKK

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=jakk&k=c1&t=6m&s=rcrc&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

So I'll just jump to my favorite - the one where I go against the world and I
do well -g-: Somewhere around 1/'00 when QCOM was splitting and the media was
ablaze with stories of this stock, I started comparing QCOM here to what I
figured was a typical unknown value stock that would be a much better bet than
QCOM-- World Fuel(INT). QCOM was $150, now it's 36. INT danced around 6-8 for
about a year, then started to move up. It closed Fri. at about $24. I sold my
last shares around $20-21.

I make these observations from all this:

1. Timing of the stock buys makes a big difference. I notice for example, that
the five year comparison of INT vs. QCOM shows that QCOM would've been the
superior and profitable stock pick.

2. The performance of others' stock picks here has soundly trounced the
performance of my picks in many (most?) instances, esp. when I go head-to-head,
my choice vs. theirs. I count my blessings nonetheless: it has been better to
be in stocks that have moved up - even if they're not up as much as others' -
than to be in stocks that went down or not be in stocks at all. Sometimes,
given a decent time interval, the #2 stocks do work out satisfactorily.

3. It's still about making money. Percentage comparisons and time frame
comparisons, even stock choice comparisons, pale if one compares the relative
bet size. For me and my small bets, having a couple winners won't much affect
my portfolios. For others who run a concentrated portfolio, seeing even just a
25% gain in one stock they have confidence in - no matter how it compares to
any other stock anybody else suggests - might appreciably improve their net
worth.

VLGEA - the SI search engine won't cooperate to tell my my thinking at the time
but I bought at 20 in October 2001 and sold in January 2002 at 24. My trading
journal has a note about no volume in VLGEA - sounds like I got bored and
missed the further runup to 36-40. OTOH, I tend to avoid stocks with less than
100K monthly volume now unless there are very special circumstances.

Also, the whole grocery sector went flat around then and never came back. Had I
simply held since 2001 I would have the same benefit that I had from selling in
the 24's, minus the time value of what I made with those funds in other stocks
subsequently.

Still holding a few other stocks from 2001 - MAXF, ACGL, and QBEIF come to

Anyone having a problem finding buy candidates, as I am?
Am looking at AFL, might reenter RKY at a lower price. Still like UIC a lot,
think a buyout is closer to happening with the perceived asbestos cloud lifted.

One that I have owned off and on, DIS - from a kick the tires perspective, just
returned from Disney World, which was VERY busy - our hotel at WDW was sold
out, theme parks were jammed. Also went to Universal Orlando, which was not as
busy (except for the new Shrek attraction). From the perspective of visiting
Universal, and talking with some people, Disney is kicking Universal's you know

I don't really like stocks that carry a multiple and PEG ratio like DIS,

Yes, seems to me the number of buying opps. for value investors has diminished.

Some value-related exploratory positions I've taken recently include:

GET, NSK (Dale Baker pick), ICPT, and JAX. Also added to my position in SCR.A..

All sell below book value. GET has plenty of debt, but its 'country & western'
franchise seems very strong still. (They've reported increasing revpar from
their hotel operations.) NSK has little long term debt and is geographically
diverse with its satellite communications. (It needs more customers though to
utilize NSK's equipment/services.) JAX is a highly regarded (in taste tests and
in service) small casual restaurant chain. (It needs to deliver more bottom
line results. A very thinly traded stock.)

SCRA has been mentioned here many times over the past five or more years. If
anyone bought in past years and held (like me), they've got a losing position.
If they bought around Oct. last year or later, they are ahead. Debt is and has
always been an issue. (Management competence too.) At this time they are
managing debt by refinancing at attractive rates and reducing debt levels. Many
SCR investors believe the totality of assets (esp. hotel chain, OEH, that SCR
controls) is worth much more than SCR's stock prices (A+B shares). I added a
bit to my SCRA position today.

About RKY, UIC: I'm still holding RKY and looking to add if it continues to
drop to lows. Have an exploratory position in UIC, not planning on adding more.

Yep. And I just ran my favorite screener and didn't find anything of interest.
So let's try an easier way:

AS Paul just posted, may I request that all the regulars here post their one or
two favorite picks here. Think about your largest holding, most comfortable
holding, or most undervalued gem...

thanks
grommit.

Here's my picks ACAS and RCRC:

Number one -- ACAS

This was posted previously, but as a summary FYI:

This company takes some effort to understand. There's plenty of valuable info
on the company website -- where they describe the business model and take issue
with the short thesis.
http://www.american-capital.com/

The stock recovered to reasonable levels and and it was looking like the huge
short interest was going to propel the price even higher. (The short sellers
(selling) basis is around $18-$20 per share.) Then an article in Barrons a week
ago which repeated short sellers arguments from a year ago. It drove the stock
down from $28 to $23-$24.

My stock candidate:

Here is a stock that I own and would suggest that it qualifies as a
undiscovered gem. I will try to point out the plusses and minuses with the
stock because as according to Marty Whitman, "every investment has something
wrong with it."
The company is Medimicus which is a medical products company engaged in the
design, development, manufacture and marketing of pertiutaneous delivery
systems. Their main product are venous vessel introducers, but they are
expanding into other areas including safety needles and advance delivery
systems.
Highlights:
*Profitable company where revenues grew 31% last year and after tax net income
increased by 32% on a pro forma basis. MEDM reported an 8% increase in revenues
and a 6% increase in earnings for the first quarter.
*Balance sheet is strong with over 6 million in cash, 15 million in net worth
compared to 3 million in liabilities.
*Increased their customers from 3 in 1999 to 25 in 2002.
*Increased their run rate for venous introducers to almost 1.6 million this
year from 400,000 at the beginning of 2001.
Obviously, they are a micro-cap with a small float. That is one problem with
the stock. Another is that they had a deal with Medtronic to assemble their
left ventricle lead procedural kits that proved so profitable that Medtronic
took it back inhouse. In spite of losing a million dollars in revenue in the
first quarter from that deal, they still showed an increase in revenues and
earnings
Another disappointment has been the slowness of their development of their
safety needle business. But I think this will eventually come around. They only
have one competitor for safety needles used in guidewire applications, which is
Merit Medical Systems. You can compare the needles on respective websites to
see what you think. MEDM's needle retracts where Merit's uses a sheath. At the
end of last year the company agreed to terms with Medtronic where they will
begin including MEDM's guidewire introducer safety needle as part of their
pacing introducer kits. In the second quarter they signed an agreement with
Cook Int. to distribute their needle. They will start shipping to Cook in the
third quarter. In the first quarter they generated $148,000 in sales of safety
needles compared to $33,000 last year. I think sales in safety needles could be
700,000 plus this year. Another problem has been the machinery they recently
installed to make safety needles. As of a couple of weeks ago, it is now
running at around seventy percent efficiency.

They also have a patented FDA-approved product, the Flowguard, a valved
peelable introducer designed to minimize the potential of air embolisms, that
they started shipping this quarter
Because there is such little volume, you have to be careful buying it. I'm in
at 6.5 and plan to add a 7 or below. It could happen because the next two
quarters are going to be tough comparisons.Obviously, this is not a stock to
trade. But I am not a trader. As long as this company keeps putting up these
kinds of numbers, I will hold it. With health care stocks it comes down to
management and science. I am also a firm believer in that concept. These guys
have 8 patents and are applying for 7 more. Their growth record is selling at a
very reasonable price compared to other stocks in its sector. I think you could
consider this company as a buy-out candidate.
I invite review and comments. I have not checked out potential dilution to the
stock due to options.

I was about to post something very similar. I am just not finding the kind of
"buys" I like.
(I typically like lower priced stocks with insider buying & value
characteristics)

I just cant find the kind of stocks I feel comfortable with. The overall
insider buying figures have been pitifully low and insider selling has been
heavy.

Stocks are overpriced by historical standards.

A friend of mine is really BULLISH and thinks since interest rates are so low
that the relatively high P/Es are ok. Still, he cant find many places to put
his money.

Maybe I am just more conservative now but I just dont feel that comfortable
buying stuff I am not real comfortable with.

As a result, I have been doing selective selling over the last few months and
have a nice sized cash position.

Maybe I just want to have dry powder come dec tax selling.

Who knows. But the overall lack of insider buying does not suggest the whole
market will continue rallying.

I think Paul mentioned JAX. I own a small position from many years ago. I paid
$2.12.

My problem with these guys is they turned down an offer many years ago by CHUX
that was fair and in the shareholders best interest. They dismissed it and
shareholders have been suffering ever since.

I am going to cut & paste someone elses post from yahoo because its conveys my
feelings so well. I really think the board & chairman of JAX are more
interested in boosting their egos by having the "best" casual dining chain than
in doing whats right by shareholders.

"The Bottom Line
by: xbarguy 05/05/03 05:52 pm
Msg: 739 of 781

As gratified as we all are that our company took "a quantum leap" last year (as
the Chairman's letter in the annual report professes), the bottom line is still
this:

Management turned down a $5.50 per share offer from CHUX in late 1997 / early
'98. Part of the rationale for that decision was that the acquirer was offering
at least part of the price in CHUX common stock.

A comparison of proxies shows that $1.00 worth of JAX at y/e 1997 is now worth
56 cents. A dollar's worth of CHUX now sells for $1.93. Therefore, the
breakeven share value for JAX from an opportunity cost point of view is $13.70.
In other words, anything less than that price per share is lost due to the
decision not to sell.

JAX closed today at $3.22. Multiply $10.48 ($13.70 - $3.22) times the number of
shares you own, and that's what you've forfeited as a result of that decision.

When the Chairman thanks us shareholders for our patience, I wonder if he's
doing this math in his head.

By the way, our Chairman took a $71,250 bonus last year (a little more than a
penny a share) for engineering the "quantum leap".

Nice work if you can get it.

Just an average guy's thoughts."

Forbes top gurus just issued their new buy list: "Ten Stocks For The Summer Of

The M100 did venture outside of metals, buying up shares in some auto-related
businesses. The top pickers bought shares of Van Nuys, Calif.-based Superior
Industries, which designs and manufactures motor vehicle parts for sale to
original equipment manufacturers. The stock trades around $41, and its
price-to-earnings ratio is 13 times trailing earnings. Their number one pick
was Copart, a Fairfield, Calif.-based company, which provides vehicle suppliers
with services to sell salvage vehicles through auctions to rebuilders. Copart
saw its revenue rise 11% to $260 million for the nine months ending April 30
and its stock has been rising steadily to $10. Its price-to-earnings ratio is
16.

Sorry, I don't do that as it would only be guesswork on my part. MEDM currently
controls about fifty percent of the venous introducer market. They want to
expand into the arterial market which is three times larger. The first step for
this is with their safety needles. A lot depends on safety needle growth. Most
current investors are unhappy with progress to date with their safety needles.
Even the company has stated in their conference calls that development and
sales in safety needles have lagged behind what they have ever anticipated. But
It will be interesting to see how the numbers play out particularly in the
third and fourth quarters when Cook Int. starts selling needles. I have also
listened to the pitch about Flowguard. Again, I prefer to see the numbers with
each quarterly report.

CPRT. -With a K, I still have it.

P/e and p/s have both come down from prior years. They still look high to me.
Company gets trashed on Yahoo board, apparently for accounting issues and for
gouging customers.

I believe they are dominant in the car auction business. There are
opportunities to both expand and to close under-performing units.

With CPRT I am focused on its very good profit margins. Based on that, I
consider fair value for the stock (currently $9.30) to be about $18-$21/sh. I
find even $18 an uncomfortable number though, because it implies a p/e of 28x
on '04 earnings est. of .67. That's high. OTOH, the stock has had an average
p/e of 28x or greater in several past years.

I have CPRT in a package of auto related stocks, and somehow that's kept me
from feeling that I should increase my small CPRT position. But after writing
this, I'll consider it.

Thanks.

I'll use today's news on BAX to free up some cash and take a tiny position in
HCA.

P/e on Baxter's est. earnings (about 12.5x) is still very low compared to past
years. I don't like selling on bad news, but I'm just tired of what seems to me
to be continual bad news surprises (surprises to me anyway) regarding this
company. I sold 2/3 of my position.

I decided to include a small amount of HCA in my sector bet on hospital stocks.
HCA "operates the largest chain of acute care hospitals". Like BAX though, HCA
has its share of troubles, and that has been reflected in its stock price too:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=HCA&d=c&k=c1&c=bax&a=v&p=s&t=6m&l=on&z=m&q=l

beginning date of comparison):

 I'll use today's news on BAX to free up some cash and take a tiny position in
HCA. 
BAX has a lot of issues - margin pressure,accounting, high stock option
dilution, increasing balance sheet leverage due to weak cash flow, negative
topline growth and low R&D expenses (6% of revenue).
Bioscience which is where the blood collection buiz is lumpted in and it's
about 40% of revenue, so the margin pressure there goes a long way. I still see
that BAX needs to accelerate earnings this year quite a bit to make the numbers
for earnings/share. When adjusted for currency and acquisitions and stock
dilution, the growth for BAX is certainly negative.

Even though the market reaction on the not totally unexpected shortfall was
mild, i think this stock has significant risk at 25$/share.

larger scale this will create huge problems a few years down the road. NVS is
performing very well in R&D and i think they will be able to achieve 10%+
topline growth for a long time. I would be a buyer at 37$ or less.

My pick Unilever - UN UL

my best pick is consumer giant Unilever:

- PE about 14
- 10 x free cash flow (market cap UN+UL = 55B$), 5.5B$ cash flow
- LT growth rate 8%, Dividend yield 3.4%, management aims for PE growth in the
low single digits

Unilver has restructured to become less capital extensive and more focused on
markets where they are #1 or #2.. This has boosted free cash flow which allows
Unilever acquisitions to further strengths its position (Bestfoods, Dreyers
etc.). It seems to me that this strategy is working. I like Unilevers focus on
free cash flow growth. I think its a classic Buffet play at an attractive
valuation.

A good writeup of UL manegements strategy:

To Steve168 and jeffrey bash. I have been trying to frame a reply to you guys
all day, but I can't get my feelings sorted out here.

The buy-below-cash strategy seems to be working in most instances. Steve168
seems to be able to move among various businesses sectors to put a few
concentrated bets down on selected companies, biotechs now I guess, that seem -
for some reason I cannot understand - to soon sustain enormous (in %, and in my
experience) up movements. Maybe it's the market we're now in; maybe it's just
my impression, maybe it's fortuitous company news; maybe it's investing skill.
The bets are concentrated (big) though - I am given to understand by posts here
- and they are working. I admire the guts.
I'm in some of these stocks for a bit too. (Still holding VICL. My bet is
small: I really can't evaluate the biotech business models, nor the IT models
that some of these below-cash companies have. I even have to hope some of these
money-losing companies do have business models, other than the loot-the-company
model.)

I've been a long-term holder of SEMI, so I'm aware of the stock's rise, but
even after being in this stock for a couple or more years, I'm still not
familiar enough with it or the business to have predicted or surmised that the
stock price would be moving up. And so much(%) and so quickly. Certainly a nice
call. As have been your previous ones here, if I remember correctly.

I don't have anything in my arsenal that I can offer as a favorite that I can
see come anywhere near the results of the two picks you two have mentioned. I
SHOULD have something to offer, given the number of stocks I own or that are on
my watch list. Hah! I did have a wonderful little net-net (selling @ 2/3 of net
current assets), p/e 4, dividend instituted -- that I would've liked to have
suggested here. A microcap Chinese mfger that traded only a few hundred shares
per day (and that just popped in price this week). In two weeks of trying I
couldn't accumulate more than a few hundred dollars worth of stock though.

I have the impression that I am doing better following the ideas presented here
by others, than others would be doing if they were to follow my ideas. -g-

re: BAX. Thanks again. Your opinion appreciated.

BAX is cheap on its historical p/e basis. (Assuming they will make their
current reduced earnings estimate.) In past the stock has recovered as it has
regained favor with institutions. I expect that could very well happen once
again.

OTOH. Man, those negatives you mention are strong. And I have to wonder how
long this stock can trade on its apparent potential - stockholders in actuality
aren't well taken care of -- book value doesn't increase, dividends haven't
increased in years, and long term debt is increasing. Sales increases don't
seem to me like they're increasing to the extent that the p/e should be higher
than its current maybe 15x. BAX has said they are targeting 8-10% sales growth
on "continuing operations". Historically, BAX has achieved 10% sales growth in
only a very few years in the past decade.

Also, I'm getting sucked into media fears that there may be a market correction
forthcoming at any time (if we're not already into it). So as regards BAX, I
have come to agree with your opinion:

"Even though the market reaction on the not totally unexpected shortfall was
mild, i think this stock has significant risk at 25$/share."

To Paul Senior. Thank you for your positive feedback. Yes my record here
(recommending ALVR@1.85, now 4.3 in a few months; VICL under $4, now 5.5 in
just few weeks) seems to be lucky, I personally felt lucky too because the
percentage move on the upside was above my expectation. However, my model and
timing is a lot more than "below cash basket", for example, my screening tool
(home built) gave me ICTS in the past couple months, it is below cash and
profitable, the numbers seem to be better than ALVR and VICL. But my other
evaluation criteria were able to filter it out so I did not recommend it here.
My model also has a technical analysis component (that I built and modified in
the past 10 years) which is very effective in timing.

Anyway I am trying to stay cool after huge gains lately and taking some chips
off the table. It is very important to not become complacent after my model
portfolio (a real brokerage account) returned 143% since July 2001 and my total
investing asset is closing to $1M mark. I am not using any margin or options,
simply value stock picking plus tools for timing. I certainly have great goal

Congratulations on your success and I wish you many more years of similar
returns.

Anyway I am trying to stay cool after huge gains lately and taking some chips
off the table.

I've had results similar to yours over the last several years (after the
changes implemented after a devastating 2000 through July) and I understand
what you're saying. For me, too, it is about exercising discipline in remaining
objective and dispassionate. There is a saying "If you like what you're
getting, keep doing what you're doing." I have a tendency to "tinker" but I
believe I have learned enough discipline to really think through any
modifications and, perhaps, paper-trade the ideas before implementation.

Another factor that is continuing to give me some opportunity for personal
growth is fighting the tendency to calcify my reasoning. The market and its
psychology is always evolving, yet I get fearful of the successes and don't
want to jeopardize it, so I have a tendency to want to not look at change.

Balancing the "tinkering" and the "calcification" are the greatest current
challenges (that and trying to find a good, reasonably priced source for mass
download of raw financial data).

Perhaps, with your system being heavily influenced by TA this won't apply to
you, but for me, I have discovered that in reviewing my trades for the last
year or two that even though I've had some remarkable success, I was leaving a
lot of gains on the table. I have sold too early and many times have missed a
doubling (or more) from where I sold. I'm not sure whether I'll change anything
about my style in light of this insight or not, but I thought I'd share it with
you.

Again, well done and many more years of continued success!

Update on Ticonderoga #2 Pencil - Graham CLASSIC!!

Dixon Ticonderoga DXT

Less than a year ago (market price then $ 1.50) I summarized a Graham classic
selling at 19% of book value then and 41% of Net-Net working capital(deducting
ALL debt).

It has doubled ($ 3.00) and I took my money off the table and am riding the
remaining position. The margin of safety on this was superb if one did there DD
and understood GAAP.

I would love to invest in these type of companies all day.

STRZ: <<I think 55 cents might be too high 40-50 cents maybe.>>Sounds about
right. I figure this quarter's reported .38 adjusts to .206 after adding back
impairment and taking out the legal settlement 'gain', both non-cash &
non-recurring. The quarter is typically about a third of annual revenues, so
EPS from the rest should aggregate to a bit over this one considering higher %
of fixed costs.
@.40 EPS, PE would be <6...cheap, but will anyone notice given the tiny cap?

Paul,

I recommend VNWI on the Low Price Cash board in the 0.60 to 0.70 range several
months ago. At about 1.00, I have sold off some of my original position, but
still have a decent holding in this firm.

VNWI is still a below-cash stock with new management in place that seems
focused on achieving profitability. VNWI has also initiated a shareholder
buyback (although buyback progress is uncertain), but there is also a potential
reverse split that is hanging over the stock.

The stock keeps hovering around $1.00, which I think is the minimum price
requirement for listing --- I'd rather they'd just do the reverse split and get
it over with. At the very least it'd save me on brokerage fees ...

It would be nice if those technology folks gave this stock some of the
ridiculous valuations that other techie stocks are now starting to get. It is
almost like with these high-cash stocks you get the cash (minus a couple
quarters of burn) as a floor with a free call option in case investors want to
give your stock an irrational valuation. I've already seen it with ALVR, DCRN,
AVNX, etc.

Thank you for the kind words and best wishes! I have enjoyed your previous

Selling too soon is a typical problem we all have to face everyday. I have no
great answer to it. I sold so many times too early in the past, including sold
some SINA at $4 when it broke to a new 52-week high. But I did hold core
position in SINA and only started unloading lately. I found the most rewarding
time for value investors is after buying a deeply undervalued stock, it turned
out to be a "growth star". There is uncertainty in the process so taking some
profit is prudent.

Nice move in your DXT, Brinks. Can't argue with your results, but I can
challenge some of your comments.

After June '02, DXT stopped being a "classic" Ben Graham net-net:

http://biz.yahoo.com/fin/l/d/dxt_qb.html

(64.4-59.2)/3.2 = $1.65/sh 1.65 x 2/3 = $1.1 = max. buy price

Sept. 02 quarter. By Mar. '03, 2/3 of net current assets = .94 cents.

This doesn't include capital lease obligations that were extant when you posted
and which I assume still exist at some level. I believe Dr. Graham would've
subtracted these to get to an even lower n.c.a. value.

I wonder what Dr. Graham would've done had had he purchased the stock at $1.50
and saw the margin of safety (2/3 of net current assets figure) diminishing.
Maybe he would've held, maybe he would've sold.

Summarizing again some previous discussions here: as far as I can tell, Dr.
Graham never explicitly stated his net current asset plays HAD to be
profitable. But in every example that that he used (i.e. in the Intelligent
Investor) they WERE ALL profitable companies.

Profitability was there for DXT in June '02, according to Yahoo, but not in any
of the three subsequent quarters. It looks to me like DXT was unprofitable
overall in '02.

http://biz.yahoo.com/fin/l/d/dxt.html

I don't argue that DXT was, or even still might be, an undervalued company.

But as far as being a "Graham CLASSIC" (Ref. your original 8/02 post, "Here is
a classic Benjamin Graham "Net-Net" stock"), I'm not so sure. And if I infer
correctly from your posts, the primary impetus for buying was that DXT was an
obvious net-net and that its being a net-net provided much of that margin of
safety.

There are a lot of people on the thread that won't buy microcaps or won't buy
net-nets. OTOH, there are a group of people here who will, and who are looking
for just such opportunities as part of their investing approach. I don't read a
murmuring of "glad I bought" here from this latter group, which I interpret to
mean not many people, if any, bought DXT when you posted on it. If that's so,
then to say, "The margin of safety on this was superb if one did there DD and
understood GAAP", implies that the people here who're looking for such
opportunities didn't or don't do DD or don't do it correctly, and/or don't
understand GAAP. That may be, but another possibility is that those who were
looking and didn't buy, do understand GAAP and did do their DD correctly but
concluded the margin of safety was not there for them. Based on subsequent
business performance, that group was right. Based on subsequent stock
performance you were right in your decision to buy. Such is the market.

jmo. Others may differ.

Congrats again. Whether smart, lucky, skillful, or all of it, it's always good
to see patience rewarded for the value investor.

Stepping up to add just little more to my very tiny exploratory position in
VVTV.

We have Barry Diller owning Home Shopping and John Malone now buying the rest
of QVC. VVTV is the third company and the publicly held one in this business.
(GE is the majority stockholder.) VVTV isn't as strong as the other two, but
with GE resources (e.g. NBC/cable) behind it, VVTV might be able to increase
its penetration (#homes per dollar of capitalization).

VVTV looks undervalued to me because it's cheap on a price-to-sales metric
compared to QVC, given QVC's takeout price of about $14B. Of course QVC might
have more strategic value to a Malone/Liberty Media. And QVC has MUCH better
cash flow. Also, I'm talking relative valuations for this business, and maybe
all three in the sector are overvalued.

Nevetheless, it's worth it to me to have a small amount VVTV to see what
develops.

NASDAQ/RUT up 10+% in 6 months, One stock to come soon.

NASDAQ and RUT broke to new high today, it is very likely that SP500 and DJIA
will follow. Once that is confirmed, I believe NASDAQ/RUT has at least 10% on
the upside in the next couple months.

People are simply realizing that 0.5% in money market is not worth it, and
whoever bought T-bonds in the pervious two months are losing money. Big drop in
bond prices will supply money for the rally, this is actually one of the safest
time to buy stocks. However, selective buying is the key because any pull back
can generate big loss if wrong stocks are bought/hold.

My large holdings are ALVR, EONC, AIRN and DUSA. It is very hard to find deeply
under valued stocks now, but one is coming on the way, waiting for the last
technical parameter for confirmation, probably tomorrow night. This one has
potential of going up 50-100% in the next 12 months. My two year performance is
up 150%, no margin, no options, just long/short US common stocks.

Try SPDE, VYYO, and KDUS

All selling at a good discount to cash with reasonable burn (KDUS has
essentially no burn, but your fate is in the hands of Carl Icahn and his
minions.) KDUS is unlikely to get the frothy pop that some of these other
stocks have gotten, since it basically has no business now except collecting
royalties and figuring out what to do with all of its cash. Still, you are
paying 0.70 for 1.00 in cash, not to mention some patents and loss
carryforwards

VYYO --- Mentioned before on Low-Price Cash Ratio board along with KDUS.

SPDE --- I don't know if I mentioned this one before. It has a buyback program
on. Burn is reasonable, although revenues are low.

I'm not sure whether SPDE and VYYO have a chance to pop much past cash (low
sales), but in this market anything can happen, especially when you get crazy
daytraders bidding up your stocks.

My last call in a while - PCYC

Paul, I was really really lucky lately and thank you for your positive comment.

This is an email I sent out yesterday. I don't recommend you to buy any stock
and this is just for the record on what I am buying/selling.

I sold all VICL and buying into PCYC. They are in the same biotech/cancer drug
business and PCYC is 30% under valued than VICL according to my proprietary
model.

Best,

Steve168

From: Steve168
Subject: I am buying PCYC near $4.5. 7/8/2003

The biggest gain in stocks was probably already made
in the past 3 months, but the next 10% is surer,
because the big trend is clear: Money is flowing from
fix-income securities (bonds, money market, etc) to
stock market. People are sick of 0.5% money market,
and realizing the risk-free interest of bonds are
becoming interest-free risks.

Deeply undervalued stocks are very hard to find, my
major holdings ALVR, VICL, DUSA, AIRN and EONC all
reached/passed cash value from 30-60% discount to cash
just couple months ago. My portfolio is up 150% in
the past 2 years, no margin, no options, just
long/short US common stocks. The model is built on my
12 years experience in the market, value oriented (big
fan of Graham and Buffet's early years) combined with
technical analysis and my proprietary Internet data
mining tools (I wrote the program).

There is only one buy from my model, and I am buying
it - it is PCYC. It is a beaten down biotech trading
at 30% discount to cash, with no debt and tolerable
burn rate. It has cancer drugs in phase III trial and
early results are positive. I am buying the pipeline
and intellectual property for free. There is
significant risk of buying any stock, and I don't
recommend anyone to buy any stock.

I have two parties made oral commitment to invest with
me once my hedge fund is setup. I am working on the
paper work and registration.

Good Luck and Happy Investing!

Steve168. Thanks for the update and your latest ideas. Diverse kinds of value
investors inhabit this thread, so I'm sure at least a few people here besides
me will be interested in seeing what you are doing.

These stock-below-cash plays (or what I've often called
money-in-search-of-a-business plays) have rapidly diminished. I'm just guessing
that that kind of value investing will disappear for at least a while. I base
my opinion on my experience that it's been rare to see so many stocks below
their cash value (and with no debt) as we've had in the past year or two. Just
as it's been difficult in the past few years to find Graham net-nets (stocks at
2/3 of net current assets), I am guessing it will soon be difficult to find
stocks-below-cash. Because we (and other market players) see now how profitable
they can be. I'll guess it's likely prices will not linger much below cash for
very long. (Investors will bid up the price.) (OTOH, if we've seen so many of
these opportunities in '02 and '03, maybe we will see them again as the market
fluctuates.)

If I am characterizing you correctly as primarily a cash-below-market investor
now, I suspect you will either have to wait (a long time, I am guessing) for
such opportunities to re-surface, or else you will have to change your
investing style. So I'd also be interested in reading of the picks you choose
if your value style changes.

I've got a KDUS question. Let's assume that they do what's been advertised and
buy a business with their cash (and maybe the SQNM stock). Further assume that
what they buy is an average, profitable business. They've got around $2/share
in cash and stock. Then there's around 90 cents per share cash loss carryovers
and credits. And patents with possible milestone payments and/or royalties.
What would a reasonable price be per share after the transaction?

If you value on price to book and KDUS used all their cash to buy a business
and assumed no debt, and if the average price to book of a microcap company is,
say, 1.5, then would KDUS then trade for $3, not counting the tax loss stuff
and patents?

Could you do a prediction based on p/e ratio? What kind of earnings per year
could you buy with $27 million in cash and stock?

Record of Up 157.84% & Pending Mutual Fund:

This is the guy who read every annual report in the past year.

As of Wednesday, July 9 2003, the Lahiji Tiny Fund is up:
RECORD 157.84%

When Will the Fund Go Down?

Site Update for Wednesday, July 9, 2003

Today was an incredible day for sure, but sadly enough, it has not made me any
happier. Our big holdings were all performing so well today, that at one point
in made me sick to my stomach. That is an understatement.

Rediff.com (REDF) +32.90% for the day
Qiao Xing (XING) +18.90% for the day
GRIC Comm. (GRIC) +57.66% for the day
Metrologic (MTLG) +15.95% for the day
Franklin (FEP) +15.30% for the day
New Dragon (NWD) +34.29% for the day

Outrageous! Simply outrageous!

I have been dead wrong about the markets for the past two months and am
sticking with my belief that everything in small cap is overbought! Earnings
for the second half will not be that great compared to last year’s! A majority
of businesses have been telling me that their sales are an “up tick” higher
than year ago periods. Certainly not good enough for the price gains they have
been experiencing. Now, yes, some have been making good deals, but they will
not come to fruition anytime soon or in the next five months.

I might even stop showing the return for the Lahiji Tiny because it is not the
best indicator as to how the companies in the fund are doing. Two are now up
over 1,000% (REDF and XING), and two are bankrupt (CLPT and QXLC). That is a
perfect example of the disparity between our winners and losers.

Please be cautious and do not become gullible. A stock moves because of solid
evidence and good reason, and not because some analyst thinks it’s good.

For now, I'm actually hoping some of these stocks come down, because the media
now simply won't believe this return! I'll try to find a way of handicapping
myself, but for now hope everyone is doing well both financially and socially.

Just a quick note: A girl slapped me the other night because I compared her to
a stock! I told her she was "overvalued" and she hit me very accurately.
Hahahahaha! My mistake, and it won't happen again.

As for the VERY IMPORTANT MUTUAL FUND, everyone is hard at work. Be patient and
it will be made available. For now, see what you are comfortable investing and
please advocate it to anyone who might be interested. The more money we raise,
the cheaper it will be to own the fund. If anyone has any questions, please
feel free to e-mail me at any given time.

I’ll keep posting a little more often now,

1. Can I buy a discounted cash flow stream cheap enough and maybe steady enough
to where my stockholders can see a bottom line benefit? And that would be
reflected in my company's stock appreciating?

2. Can I, as new controlling management, add any additional value to the
purchased operation? Can I manage the purchase better than the current
managers? Or, maybe more importantly does the purchase serve some strategic fit
or plan of my business? A fit/plan that the market will recognize as a
positive?

3. How will stockholders view my purchase? What's my record with prior
purchases, if any? If I've got a ton of cash to spend because I went public in
the dot.com craze with some cockamamie idea that'll never bring profits to the
bottom line, what makes anyone (besides me) believe I could now manage a
presumed real business that I'd be spending $25M on? And manage it better than
its current management?

I relate your question to the cash-in-search-of-business plays. My preference
is that the cash-rich company distribute the cash to stockholders (me)and let
us decide how to allocate this money.

My inclination is to sell my shares when I see managements of these cash-rich
companies try to acquire other assets with cash. Sometimes the purchase is in a
totally unrelated business. That seems self-serving (job protection) by
management and dangerous to stockholders. Sometimes the purchase is in related
business and analysts/media indicate it's a good fit. I still want to sell out
because those businesses are usually small biotechs or small dot.com/info tech.
companies with not much (if any) profit history and where I have no idea and no
confidence that management/analysts/media are right in their assessments.
Sometimes if the cash purchase is relatively small (e.g if the cash hoard is
$125M and 'only' $25M is being spent), I'll maybe stick around to see how the
purchase seems to work out.

jmo, and I have made the wrong buy/sell decisions with many of these cash-rich
companies.

Tomato,

You ask a good question regarding KDUS. I'd don't have a good answer. I know
that in some industries there are standard EBIDTA multiples for acquisitions,
but given I don't what industry they'd enter, I am not sure where to start.

I do know of one instance where a cash-rich company has acquired another
profitable company --- Softnet (SOFN), which is now American Insurance (AMIC).
The results have been good so far, even though I was skeptical of the whole
thing.

As for KDUS, we have new management run by one of Carl Icahn's protege. Given
Carl Icahn's track record, I assume that management will be investment savvy,
but not necessarily looking out for the shareholders' best interests.

Similar to Paul, I personally would be happy with liquidation right now. I
prefer an immediate, riskless 30-40% gain to a possible higher gain that is
somewhat risky and may take years. However, either way I think it is a
reasonable place to park some cash.

SGR: Blew it out today at 11.20 for 15% loss on overall position. Don't like
the industry outlook, the negative FCF guidance [although comments on the CC
indicate neutral FCF, contrary strongly negative shown on PR]. Had hoped there
might be something positive on Iraq, but narry a peep on that.
I may jump back in if price dives...got plenty of time before a rebound.

Bob Rudd: SGR. Suffering with this one, but I'll hold on a little longer.

Took some profits in NCR along the way; still have some shares though. On the
negative side, I gave up today and sold exploratory position MTW at loss. Rode
that one all the way up, back down, up a little, and ended now back down this
am. Their crane business is punk. They don't say, but I had, and have, a strong
suspicion it wasn't the economy. Competition from upstart Chinese company
taking market share. Should've acted on my suspicion.

Started a small position in ATML this am. Diversity of business should help
this chipmaker if economy recovers. P/sales relatively low. I'm guessing
profits in past were driven by high fab utilization rates. Risk is that with
more fabs having been built by competitors world-wide, and no electronics
sector showing really strong chip demand, those good utilization rates (profit
margins)may not return.

Paul, you will very likely make money on ATML (possibly 2+ times the current
price), but it is not a good long term investment. Fabless is the way to go.
They have too many fabs, too much debt and too much commodity business. Look at
the Gross Margin on LLTC or MXIM versus ATML. ATML is at real risk in the next
major industry downturn.

The semiconductor manufacturers have been slow to realize that the ECM way the
general electronics companies went is even more important in their industry,
where a good plant costs a billion or more.

jeffrey bash. Tremendous gross margins on those two! P/book, p/sales and p/e
are very high though reflecting that. I would need to study the business sector
and the stocks to get some understanding of what's going on. At this point it
just looks to me like neither LLTC nor MXIM are value buys.

And as you allude, ATML may not be either if there's not much margin of safety
with its business strategy.
