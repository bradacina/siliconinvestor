The 11$ in cash flow is incorrect, check your numbers. I think it's priced
inline with the group but will benefit more if NG prices go up with their
unregulated business. It's a decently managed company and fits well into a
dividend portfolio.

Speaking of dividend stock - have you looked at TOT. The stock is down quite a

refinery business but overall they are executing well. I as fishing for a few

I don't think it makes too much sense to rationalize there, if a Panic set's in

With a financial like GS perception=reality. I just read the (mediocre imo)

From a chart point of view GS looks awful (having busted the 150$ defense line

A Better idea is to look into plays that suffer collateral damage without

has done similar deeds than GS and might get the big stick as well and can much

RIG is disproportionally more affected. BP is a worldwide reputation, 10x RIG's

if major faults are found with their rig

So it's a "sell, sell, sell, bad shit may happen" mentality based on no known
facts. It does not matter that company adheres to all existing regulations. It
does not matter that official inspection was conducted 10 days before a blowup
and found no issues. What matters is that "OMG, major faults can be found with
the rig, let's panic". OK.

Sometimes I think that speculators (as opposed to business owners) are just
bottom feeders providing no useful role in economy. If there is an issue, the
solution is always to run away instead of trying to fix it. While BP and RIG
employees are working to contain the catastrophe, the armchair philosophers
pile blame high and low without even waiting for any substantive investigation.

So it's a "sell, sell, sell, bad shit may happen" mentality based on no known

I don't think that's a fair assessment. The fact is that RIG does have a
history of operational mistakes - though in the past it's been rigs offline due
to operational problems rather than due to a cataclysmic event. Nevertheless,
this management has long made me uneasy. This is due not only to their spotty
operational history compared to say, DO, but also due to what appears to me to
be a greater focus on financial engineering than operational engineering, and a
general lack of transparency.

I stopped giving this company the benefit of the doubt a while ago, and I can't

Jurgis - I didn't say sell RIG, I have never owned it so i can't sell - I was
just contemplating possibilities. The stock had a terrific run and still trades
at 2x tangible book, so it trades on earnings power rather than replacement
value. I believe there will be consequences for drilling in the Gulf which will
affect dayrates, probably dramatically. So RIG's earnings power could suffer
much more to than BP's. Buyers need to take that into account.

My inclination would be to buy another driller that suffers collateral damage
(NE).

Spek,

If you believe that there will be consequences for drilling in the Gulf which
will affect dayrates, probably dramatically, then your second suggestion of
buying another driller that suffers collateral damage is wrong. It is only
right if RIG will be found guilty for the rig explosion. (Apparently from
Dale's thread RIG is now being contracted by BP to drill the shutoff wells, so
it's not really losing business or reputation). I would have to look at the rig
and revenue distribution, but buying NE may expose you more to the dayrate
decline than buying RIG which is (from what I remember) very geographically
distributed for their deep water drilling. Of course, RIG made a stupid
investment decision of buying GSF almost at the top, which exposes it to rather
horrible shallow water drilling economics and probably much more GoM.

Overall, I'd rather buy pure play deepwater drilling investment, but there is
no such thing in US market after RIG bought GSF. RIG was the cheapest based on
deepwater exposure before the blowup and it is even cheaper comparatively now.
I do appreciate Mark Marcellus' input that their long term operational quality
should be considered before making investment decision though.

re - geographical diversification. i checked and both NE and RIG achieve about

For RIG, BP is their most important customer - 12% of revenues, for NE it is
RDS (12% too).

The NG to Oil ratio is at 2x the historical five year average. The price for NG

Maybe, but not necessarily. If cheap oil is scarce while cheap(ish) gas is
plentiful, the ratio may hold or even worsen. Most of the oil usage
(transportation) is not easily substitutable by nat gas short term (1-3 years).
Longer term, I would guess that at least developing countries will convert to

RE: BP plc (BP)

Closed out my small holding of BP. Will consider buying back in if/when the
stock trades below $40.

Increased my MDU Resources Group Inc. (MDU) position by 65%. Their regulated
utility units and their pipeline and energy services business both had record
quarters due to higher oil prices and lower operating costs. Their construction
unit was the poor performer which should benefit from future economic growth
(as the stimulus money trickles down into their operations).

The company is invloved in the exploration, development, and production of
natural gas and oil resources in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent/Gulf
States. They own and operate approximately 3,700 miles of transmission,
gathering, and storage lines, as well as own, lease, and operates 33 compressor
stations in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. Further, Mountain
and Mid-Continent/Gulf States.

The company has no exposure to deep drilling wells in the Gulf and could
possibly benefit from BP's tragic accident.

The geographic region MDU operates in has had extensive new capital investment
in NG shale well exploration & development. These new wells will require the NG
gathering, storage and transportation services that MDU provides. With a
forward PE around 12 and a dividend that yields 3%, MDU represents a good GARP
stock investment.

re RIG - i think generally, BP would be responsible for the spill since they
are directing the operation. RIG has insurance for the RIG itself and some on
top of it for damages (800M$?). BP is self insured.

Problems arise for RIG if gross negligence on their part (crew or equipment)
can be proven. Then the insurance probably would not pay for the RIG and BP
itself would hold RIG liable. In addition other majors would think twice before
engaging with RIG again. If gross negligence on RIG's part could be proven then
the outfall could drive the company into bankruptcy.

This is all my opinion. I am not an expert by any means. It's probably better
to ask IJ Frankel (our resident legal expert) in the 50% gains thread.

Indeed, nice report in my view, and in the market's view also as After-Hours

In hindsight, FVE has done a great job with their balance sheet throughout the
global financial mess. If my memory serves me correctly, they used their cash
to buy back their debt at a discount, which really increased the company's book
value.

I wasn't a holder back in 2007, but it appears that if:

1) The current quarter's results ($0.12/share in a seasonally weak quarter?)
portend a return back to the earnings of 2007

&

2) The balance sheet/book value is markedly improved from 2007

That I would hope that the current stock price of $3 could start inching back
up to the levels of 2007 (high of ~12).

I don't think this stock will really run at the open tomorrow, so I will
probably double my stub position to get to something that may actually impact

Otoh, company has increased distribution each of past several years. A positive

Distribution yield is now $1.36/13.90, or almost 10%. The way they are

Company recently issued 5.1M sh. at $15.10, so likelihood of them doing another
share issuance is small, for now, imo.

Company has successfully built-up and sold three businesses since '06 ipo. They

If they have to pay out 90% of their earnings (or noi, or whatever) though,
then the only way is to issue stock. This in past until '08-'09 tended to occur
when price exceeded book value. (In my observation, from my memory -- I could
have it wrong.) Past couple years seem to have been distressed issuances - to
shore up liquidity maybe. Anyway, when CODI got above stated book value this

re BAX - i don't like the feel of the pump recall announcement as wel.The
400-600M$ figure does only capture the cost of recall, not that of potential

The whole thing has the eery feel of BAX Y2003 issues (that seem far worse back
then), so maybe we are not at the bottom yet.

As for the recalled Collegue pump, it seems that BAX danced around a good
solution for years with a product that seems deficient until the FDA pulled the
plug. Why they have done so, I can only speculate <g> - it appears that BAX is
not really interested (or maybe not even competent) in pumps but rather want to
sell their consumables, so pumps are a necessary nuisance to do that. Evidence
is that they had another company (SIGMA) develop a competing and obviously
better product but without a migration path for their legacy users of BAX own
pump. Strange and it certainly leaves a bad impression on many (including the
FDA).

That said BAX is a large health care company and while they certainly made
mistakes in this business they seem to do OK in others and OK over the long
term. Hopefully management learns from this disaster and makes better decisions
going forward. The stock market says BAX is on timeout and I think that is an

FVE - The reason I mentione that is the following from their recent Form 10-Q

Federal agencies and some members of Congress have proposed Medicare and
Medicaid policy changes and freezes on rate increases or rate reductions to be
phased in during the next several years. The current economic conditions are
causing budget shortfalls in many states, increasing the likelihood of Medicaid
rate reductions, freezes on rate increases, or increases that are insufficient
to offset increasing operating costs. The new comprehensive health care reform
law described below includes policy changes and provisions that may result in
reduced Medicare rates of payment for SNFs and IRFs or a failure of such rates
to cover our cost increases over the next several years. The magnitude of the
potential Medicare and Medicaid rate reductions or changes and the impact on us
of the failure of these programs to increase rates to match increasing
expenses, as well as the impact on us of the future and potential Medicare and
Medicaid policy changes, cannot currently be estimated, but they may be
material to our operations and may affect our future results of operations.

In May 2004, CMS issued the "75% Rule" establishing revised Medicare criteria
that rehabilitation hospitals are required to meet in order to participate as
IRFs in the Medicare program. As recently amended, the rule requires that for
cost reporting periods starting on and after July 1, 2006, 60% of a facility's
inpatient population must require intensive rehabilitation services for one of
the CMS's designated medical conditions. The rule is now commonly known as the
"60% Rule". An IRF that fails to meet the requirements of this rule is subject
to reclassification as a different type of healthcare provider; and the effect
of such reclassification would be to lower Medicare payment rates. As of March
31, 2010 and May 3, 2010, we believe our IRFs are in compliance with the CMS
requirements to remain IRFs. However, the actual percentage of patients at our
IRFs who meet these Medicare requirements may not be or remain as high as we
believe or may decline. Our failure to remain in compliance with CMS
requirements to be paid as an IRF, if it occurs, will result in our receiving
lower Medicare rates than we currently receive at our IRFs.

On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed a comprehensive health care law, H.R.
3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA. A week later,
President Obama signed H.R. 4872, the Health Care and Education Affordability
Reconciliation Act of 2010, amending PPACA. As amended, PPACA contains
insurance changes, payment systems changes, and healthcare delivery systems
changes, with the stated intention to expand access to health insurance
coverage and simultaneously reduce the growth of healthcare expenditures while
maintaining or improving healthcare quality. Under PPACA, most individuals will
be required to have or purchase qualifying employer based or individual health
insurance plans beginning in 2014. Premium and cost sharing tax credits will be
available to assist people with low incomes to purchase health insurance,
Medicaid eligibility will be expanded to more low income individuals, statewide
and regional insurance exchanges will be established to expand access to
standardized health insurance plans, and employers with more than 50 employees
will be subject to financial penalties if any of their full time employees
receive premium credits to purchase health insurance through an exchange. At
this time it is unclear if all or any of the stated intentions of the PPACA,
some of which are intuitively contradictory, can or will be achieved.

RE: Government Properties Income Trust (GOV)

Government Properties Income Trust Announces Results for the Period Ended March
31, 2010
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Government-Properties-Income-bw-388718978.html?x=
&.v=1

From the article:"...Net income available for common shareholders for the
quarter ended March 31, 2010 was $6.9 million, or $0.24 per share, compared to
$8.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009...."

Both Operating income and Net income were lower from the previous quarter
primarily due to the one time financing costs of their secondary offering.

If you back out the secondary fees, the operating income is still lower. If you
annualize the per share net income reported for Q1 (.24/share Q1) you get
$0.96/share, analysts estimate $1.80/year - $1.90/year. It seems like they fell
short. At least for the first quarter, they come well short of making their
$0.40/share quarterly dividend amount.

Stock seems to be holding up after their report.

Based on your post of 1/15/2010, the stock is fairly valued at $19.96/share -
$20.70/share but at $27.00/share it appears you are paying a 35% premium. I do
not think the properties owned have increased that much in value over the last
three months.

I am out of the position. I guess new buyers like the safety of Government
tenants and will pay a premium to own the shares.

GOV/PFD. GOV's current yield is 6%. I'd say it's pretty safe given that it's
federal or state (commonwealth) entities that lease their buildings. At current
stock price, that yield isn't going to increase so quickly though (imo): it'll
take time for GOV to deploy all the funds it can draw down to buy and prep and
lease new buildings. So I suspect the stock will at best be stagnant for a
while because I see the distribution only increasing slowly. And while 6% isn't
bad at all, it doesn't seem at this point that it's high enough to pull more
buyers into the stock to propel the stock higher.

Regarding current yield, I just suspect I can do as well or better with as much
safety, elsewhere. I've closed out my GOV position today.

Fwiw, today in this account I averaged up my position in PFD. This fund uses
leverage to pump up the distribution. They've been able to increase their use
of leverage. (They apparently have - or maybe haven't -g- - learned their
lesson about the pitfalls of leverage.) Increased leverage has led to an
increased distribution. Annualized, it would be 12x.0825 = $.99 on an 11.88
stock price, or 8.3%. PFD is oriented to bank and utilities. Here's a list of
their holdings from their website.

For me, looking to park some money for a while, I find PFD more attractive than
GOV. Jmo, of course.

GRVY, MAIL, TXIC, LTUS, CLLZF, IGK/ISF, UEPS
Positions reduced: OXY
Positions eliminated: SPPRO

I am still cash over-weighted due to account liquidation and transfer. It is
even more exciting that the institution - which will remain nameless - screwed
up the transfer, so I got the money a week late, but just in time for the
market drop. So far even with liquidation costs, I probably saved 3-5% on the
price drop. Like wise men say, it's better to be lucky than smart. :)

With this in mind, I have been buying a lot, but still have cash left. New
positions are in MUR - nice oil company with stock held back by refineries and
Malaysian/Brunei contract issues. Not great Q1 results. AMPH - discussed on
Dale's thread, just a toe dip, I did not like their latest results.

In terms of additions, most are familiar names, most may still be cheaper in
coming weeks.

Oil: RIG - probably not the best choice in deepwater drilling due to headline
risk, eyeing NE for additions. GTE - let's see their Q1 report in couple days.
COPJF - cheap Australian oil play from Dale. CLLZF - oil sands minor which
seems to have got their act together.

CSGH, NEWN, SPU, TXIC, LTUS - are cheap Chinese names. RINO is a rather recent
addition, a momentum darling abandoned by momentum chasers.

GILD - another high-flyer darling dropped on so so guidance. CF - fertilizer co
going through acquisition integration pain. UEPS - SA payment processor trying
to extend contract with government. GRVY - Korean game developer with not much
recent success. MAIL - Israeli software company making money from Google's
generosity.

Income part is replenished by NRF-B and IGK/ISF.

On the sale side, OXY has become rather expensive. SPPRO also reached par and
is completely an income security now. I did not like to keep it with no cap

re BLK - I don't think it's fair to compare BLK to traditional asset managers
like BEN, TROW etc. I claim so because BLK does mostly low cost index funds/ETF
that charge fees of <0.2% annually while TROW can charge >0.8% typically for
and actively managed fund. So to achieve the same revenue, BLK needs to have
>4X the amount of AUM compared to their competitors. So you cannot compare
BLK's market cap / AUM ratio directly.

I do like how BLK position themselves. The Barclays Ishares buy was not cheap
but it's a great operation. I think a lot of money in managed accounts and
retirement account and such will migrate to ETF, especially now with trades
getting cheaper and cheaper (Fidelity & Vanguard offer free trading for their
ETF's).

Now it has shifted and im down about the same in each. OT listening to fast
money on cnbc today, Im saddened that people who I think are reasonable
analysts and trader are so willing to call for a ceo's resignation in order to
appease a regulator with a proven history of failure, who itself should be the
target of a massive investigation. The SEC has missed every fraud of note thats
taken place over two decades. What can one say about a regulator whose moment
in the sun has come from convicting Martha Stewart of insider trading. They
were about 5 years behind the times on the options backdating only convicting a
handful of the creeps who stole shareholders money. I remember vividly how
angry i was after Sepracor had dropped from $50 to $4 and then rebounded to $9
to be informed in a public release that managament had repriced their $50
options to $5 and change or something like that. They subsequently presented
for a new drug and the stock leap back into the $30s or so. Those guys ahould
have all been jailed!

Right now Im feeling like the USA's best days are behind it.
Listening to reports massive amounts of young being unemployed in spain, and
hearing about the difficulties of friend's kids in their twenties trying to
land reasonable employment, makes me wonder how good an increasing chasm
between have's and have nots can be for this country. Will the next year be

BLK. Yes, I had derated BLK because I had considered that. Maybe not enough
though.

Whereas if BLK were a traditional asset manager of equity funds, my calculation
of what I'd be willing to pay for the share - my top price - would be about two
times the stock price when the stock was $185.51 when I posted, based on assets
under management as last reported.

I cut that $360 down by about a quarter to about $270/sh. As I look again, that
may be a mistake. Maybe I should derate even further. A very low multiple
indeed for its managed assets. I see now though that that would put it more in
line with where FII is trading. FII is a large asset manager that's heavily
involved with money market funds (now those have low fees, if any) and bonds
(which don't command the management fees that equity funds get). The result of
further derating and comparison to FII would be that I'd show BLK trading at
fair value now. And maybe that should be my conclusion, if I'm basing my
opinion on the metrics I am using.

Perhaps I've made a mistake in buying. I'll reconsider.

Hi Spekulatis

Ameren Corporation (AEE)

Closed out my position in this utility. I agree with your conclusion that the
company has regulatory challenges with the Illinois Comerce Commission. This
rulling was announced for their recent rate increase proposal where they
received only 9% of what they requested.

"The Illinois Commerce Commission issued an order in our electric and natural
gas delivery rate cases on April 29. The overall authorized revenue increase
was only $5 million, as calculated by the ICC. This was well below our revised
request of $130 million and the $56 million proposed by the Commission's own
Administrative Law Judges. We are clearly disappointed in the decision and we
are taking action. Our responses will include asking the Commission to rehear
certain issues and reducing planned spending at our Illinois utilities to
levels more closely in-line with the revenue and related cash flow levels
provided by the order...."

I made a little on my trade that I established 2/24/2010 but closed out the
position today as a "tight" regulatory board can be an investor's nightmare.

I am looking at putting the proceeds into Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Income
Fund Inc. (PFD) which Paul Senior mentioned on the Dividend investing for

GOV. I agree that it is not undervalued. The P/FFO of 14+ is not cheap. But the
dividend risk is negligible due to tenants and lack of debt. I also sold off
additional shares, maybe holding around 1/5 of my peak amount. Now holding a
1/2 level position.

Bought more MPW. $9.60/.97 = 9.9 PE. 8.3% Div, if they maintain it.
"The Company believes that its existing portfolio of assets plus approximately
$520 million of assets to be acquired will generate normalized FFO of between
$0.94 and $0.97 per share on an annualized basis once fully invested."

Also found a LOW risk preferred paying 8.4%. NO debt. Safe tenants. Let you
