Slide 20 of the investor presentation that I previously posted indicates that
32 million of the 45 million has been invested. They've been building this
plant for two years now so they are at the end of the process rather than the
beginning. There are further plans to expand the plant, but there has been no
timetables set up for expansion as they obviously have to get phase one built
first.

Input and output costs are controlled by the government. The company is very
profitable by the current standards. There was some decrease in margins this
quarter and that was attributed to increased competition in the Hunan province.

This isn't a perfect investment as the delays to the LNG plant and the
decreased margins have raised some questions. But management has been good in
this company if you look at the growth at a year over year basis. They have
also aligned with some large partners to further increase their footprint, so
I'm holding my oversized position that I have built over the last two years.

The company was very conservative on guidance even though bromine prices are
increasing. There were only two call-ins, one from a private investor, so the
story on this stock is still unnoticed. The share price has risen so fast that
you have investors with tremendous gains. I think this has gone from a deep
value stock to more of a GARP equity. So there will be a change-over in the
type of investor looking at this. After all, there is no institutional
ownership listed on Nasdaq.

ULTR reported earnings (actually a small loss) earlier this week. If not for
the continued drought and subsequent low river levels their River/barge
business reported a loss (a 36% drop in cargo business). Their offshore supply
business continues to grow w/ new Petrobras service contracts. The new supply
ships placed in service are now all on long term contracts. There were some one
time charges expensed as they expand this line of their business.
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Ultrapetrol-Announces-Third-pz-334534940.html?x=0
.v=1

* During the third quarter of 2009, UP Rubi commenced its 4-year time charter
with Petrobras, as announced. A one time $1.5 million charge was realized in
the third quarter of 2009 to account for a possible contractual penalty
associated with the late delivery of this vessel under its charter party;

* During the third quarter of 2009, the Company entered into 3-year time
charters with Petrobras for UP Agua-Marinha, UP Diamante and UP Topazio, which
was repositioned in Brazil to serve this contract.

===============================================================

I am still somewhat bullish on the shipping sector but trying to stay with
companies that have a solid balance sheet and good cash flow. Those companies
that have exposure to China and Brazil are a plus. That's why I continue to add
to SFL. I will hold ULTR and wait for the rains to hit which should allow their
River business to run barges at normal levels.

You were right with ULTR's growth in their offshore business. They continue to
ink more contracts w/ Petrobras and as a result are adding more ships to their
fleet (two more to be placed in service in 2012).

I missed adding NOBGF (Nobel Group Ltd) but it appears that they are benefiting
from China's continued growth. They broke out to new highs this week (above
$2.00/share) after trading in the $0.60/range for most of 2008/2009.

RE: NRF -

NorthStar Realty Finance (NYSE:NRF)
This New York City-based commercial real estate company does three things: it
lends money to others to finance real estate deals, invests in commercial
mortgage-backed securities and real estate investment trusts, and owns and
manages commercial properties, many of which are healthcare-related. Overseeing
$6.4 billion in real estate assets, CEO David Hamamoto has 26 years of real
estate investing experience. He and other senior managers own 10% of the
company's stock and are committed to its continued success. Like most real
estate businesses these days, it hasn't been a walk in the park for the
company. NRF's adjusted funds from operations in the third quarter were 25
cents a share, down 32.4% from 37 cents in the third quarter a year earlier.

With debt capital essentially unavailable, the company has had to manage its
liquidity efficiently and now sits with $251 million in cash and uninvested
funds from its secured term financing. Cooperman's interest in the micro cap is
probably its book value, which sat at $7.54 as of September 30, 2009, after
removing all unrealized mark-to-market adjustments as well as depreciation. At
current prices, NRF's shares are trading at 46% of book value. Eventually,
credit will flow more freely and with it, NorthStar's stock price.

RE: Enerplus Resources Fund (ERF) - Q3 highlights
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Enerplus-reports-third-cnw-486458674.html?x=0&.v=

OPERATING PERFORMANCE:

- Daily production averaged 90,111 BOE/day during the quarter and
93,184 BOE/day year-to-date. We continue to expect 2009 annual
production volumes to average 91,000 BOE/day.

- Cash flow from operations was $207.2 million, comparable to that of
the second quarter of 2009. Approximately 45% of our cash flow was
distributed to our unitholders with monthly cash distributions of
$0.18/unit maintained throughout the quarter. When combining
distributions and capital spending during the quarter, our adjusted
payout ratio was 68%. Year-to-date, our adjusted payout ratio has
averaged 78%, however, given the high level of capital spending
planned for the fourth quarter of 2009, we expect our adjusted payout
ratio to be approximately 100% for the entire year.

- Capital expenditures totaled $45.4 million during the quarter with
48 gross wells drilled (27.6 net wells). Our year-to-date capital
spending has totaled $180.2 million with 229 gross wells drilled
(156.6 net wells). Our drilling success rate was 99%.

- We have actively been working to control costs throughout 2009 and
our efforts have resulted in operating costs of $10.07/BOE for the
third quarter and an average of $9.94/BOE for the year. Based on
these results, we are lowering our full year guidance from
$10.65/BOE to $10.20/BOE, an improvement of over 4% from our
original target. Our general and administrative costs remain on track
to meet our full year guidance of $2.45/BOE.

- Our hedging program realized cash gains of $40.6 million in the
quarter, helping to offset weak natural gas prices. Year-to-date, we
have realized cash hedging gains totaling $129.1 million.

GROWTH STRATEGY EXECUTION:

- We completed our first significant transaction in the U.S. shale gas
plays acquiring an average 21.5% working interest in over
540,000 gross acres of land in the Marcellus shale region in
northeast United States from Chief Oil & Gas LLC and certain
affiliated entities ("Chief"). Total consideration for this interest
was approximately US$411 million, consisting of an upfront cash
payment of US$164 million that was paid upon closing and US$247
million to be paid as a carry of 50% of Chief's future drilling and
completion costs in the Marcellus shale play which we expect will be
invested over the next four years. Our net production at the time of
the transaction was approximately 1.8 MMcfe/day, with a line of
sight to approximately 100 MMcfe/day within the next five years. Our
internal assessment has identified over 1.4 trillion cubic feet of
best estimate contingent resources on these lands, net to Enerplus,
which would almost double our proved plus probable natural gas
reserves currently booked. See "Information Regarding Contingent
Resource Estimates" at the end of this news release.

- Subsequent to quarter end, we purchased a 50% non-operated working
interest in over 22,000 gross acres of prospective Bakken land in
North Dakota for US$27 million, consisting of US$15 million in cash
and US$12 million of carry capital to be invested over the next
12 months. We have assessed an internal best estimate of contingent
resources on this acreage of approximately 7.4 million barrels, net
to Enerplus, based upon a 13% recovery factor.

- We sold approximately 4.5 net sections of low working interest,
non-core property interests in southeast Saskatchewan for
approximately $100 million subsequent to the quarter. These lands
were producing approximately 200 BOE/day of oil with 1.5 million BOE
of booked proved plus probable reserves. We continue to prepare to
sell non-core oil and gas assets that will allow us to focus our
efforts and capital on existing core resource plays and expand our
interests in targeted resource plays. We expect to have completed
this work and to be in a position for sale in 2010.

=====================================================================

My take away is a lot of investment for the future. Wells drilled Q3 not as
successful as norm (just over 50%). Good overall production totals and cash
flow. If oil rates stay high, I would expect an increase in the distribution to
unit holders. Still very positive on their capital investments especially in
the Marcellus shale region. This should pay dividends well into the future.

Oil and Natural Gas: Ratio Explodes in 2009

Stock selling below 2003 levels and well below its 50 week MA of $38.00/share.
Analysts see much higher sales growth for 2010. ERF is a good NG play
(especially w/ their Marcellus shale investment) and should benefit from any
sustained NG price rise (NG rates today at $4.31/mmbtu). The historic ratio of
$/barrel of crude oil to $/mmbtu of NG is 10:1. The current spread is 17:1!
Based on the historical normalized ratio, ERF should be priced at $45.00/share
w/ crude oil at $75.00/barrel.

Very concerned about ng prices though. Although I am often a believer in
reversion-to-mean, the historical ratio between nat gas and oil may not be
valid anymore, and may not return to "normal" because there is just so much nat
gas coming from these shale plays --- maybe a glut of it. Maybe so much that
it's going to be very difficult for the shale producers to show profits unless
they are the low cost producers in all aspects (leasing costs, lifting costs,

CVU,

I listened to the earnings call. I liked what I heard except a near-term stock
offering was not ruled out, which I think is what is leaving the current
overhang on the stock.

I would expect as the stock price goes down the prospect of an offering would
be less likely (company management understanding the deal is not in shareholder
interests at too low a price), but if the offering were to occur, the stock
price would likely beat up substantially in order to draw enough demand to get
new investors into a microcap company.

While their drugs are unique in that they help a small group of people with

re GENZ. The product affected are probably about 80%+ of GENZ revenues. Infact
it seems that all of GENZ products have the problem. now it seems to affect
only 1% of the vials produced but unless you know exactly which ones (batches).
A 1% failure rate of this ugly nature is very high for a product like this.

 The drugs affected by the latest announcement include: Cerezyme, Fabrazyme,
Myozyme, Aldurazyme and Thyrogen.

Since those products use very different manufacturing processes it seems that
the problem must be with the liquid handling into the vials /the vials itself
or their cleaning, If indeed those steps are shared in between different
products. At least that is my take as a process engineer <g>.

It's going to be a while until they get the FDA from their back, in particular
since this is the second gross failure (1st one being virus contamination).

Thanks. An important link for me perhaps.

First thing is, I wonder if these guys have any credibility as utility

incompetence/crookedness/hidden agendas that any Citicorp employee
recommendations seem to bring to mind (my mind, anyway -g-)?

I've spotted in the disclosures that Citicorp does business and is seeking more
business from CenterPoint, and has a "significant financial interest in
relation to"...CenterPoint. So no surprise the analysts recommend it.

(I've no issue with that. I'm holding on to my CenterPoint shares.)

About the sell recommendation though. That's SE. Several of us have or have had
positions in that one: You (Spekulatius), and I and maybe EKS, who's posted on

I have my shares purchased first couple weeks in January. As part of a package,
so I'm still not competently familiar with SE. I might be willing to sell SE
and switch to the recommended SUG or SE. Or just close out my position. Other
than a lesser dividend yield, (3% area vs. SE at 5%), these latter two stocks
seem to have performed better than SE in past year:

RE: SE

Spectra Energy Corp. (NYSE:SE) was spun off from Duke Energy Corp. as of
January 2, 2007 and does not have a LT track record like several of the other
utility companies mentioned in the Citi Corp report. The spin off created a lot
of debt and leverage for the company and SE is more vulnerable to the LT
corporate debt market, economic slowdowns, or any of the other macro issues
that may arise.

My plan was to see SE break through $20 then sell covered calls on my small
holdings. I am in these utilities for their dividend stream and the
appreciation is an added bonus. I like those companies that have an unregulated
side to their business in exploration, NG collection and/or mining.

I have not made it through the entire report but saw no mention of my favorite
speculation, Black Hills Corp. (BKH). (Note: My LT premise for Oil is over
$100/barrel out through 2012 which should impact NG and Coal prices too). I
want to add more at prices around $20 and am even looking at perhaps selling
some naked Puts.

As long as the money market yields are low (below 2%), I have been putting
money into the Integrated Natural Gas & Electric Utility sector. I have been
buying those companies that pay a dividend 5% or higher (but now that's hard to
find) and have an unregulated segment of their business in either coal or NG or
distribution (ie pipelines & storage).

Most of the easy money has been made already, so to enhance my return, I am
looking to write LT covered calls when the prices approach their LT MA
(reversion to the mean idea). When there is added volatility and large price
swings, I have a select few that I will sell naked Puts to establish a covered
straddle combination with the strategy to sell the naked Puts at a lower strike
price than the covered calls I have written.

I have no real exit strategy for any of my utility positions other than to peel
off shares on any sustained interest rate hike by the FED. Hopefully, the
utilities will have enough pricing power to raise customer rates in line with
inflation and the price of their stock (and dividend yield) will not drop too
much as the FED raises rates.

It looks like that the sector (in general) has moved 60%-70% above their
Feb/March 2008 lows which means that there is only 30%-40% more upside. I will
be looking for new buys in the pipeline & distribution companies since they
should perform marginally better during any economic upswing.

Therefore, I have been buying TORTOISE PWR AND ENE (TPZ) in the IRA (w.
dividends reinvested). This is one you have mentioned over the last few months.
I think an entry point below $19 is a good accumulation price. Perhaps an exit
strategy (for the taxable account) is to peel off the LT capital gain proceeds
from the individual utility buys and build a position in the TPZ fund. This
allows immediate diversification through a basket of stocks in the sector,
dividends are qualified (and can be taken in cash), and the portfolio "Energy
Infrastructure" sector holdings can be re-balanced from time to time by simply
buying or selling appropriate amounts of TPZ fund shares.

My only concern w/ TPZ Fund is their limited track record as they have only
been in business since August 2009.

Let me be clear, there will not be any stock offering at anywhere near this

an opportunity avails itself. Note, it also allows for a debt offering. There
is no question if the company grows as we expect it to grow over the next 3
years additional financing will be needed, but management will not allow it to
be dilutive. Remember, the Chairman is one of the largest holders and a very

One last question on CVU,

Sorry, the reason I am bugging you so much is that I find this interesting,
wondering whether to take a good-sized position.

The operating cash flows have been negative for each of the past five years.
When are they to start generating cash? That is a red flag to me. Earnings
supported by negative cash flows over the long run can be quite iffy. If some
big project gets cancelled or delayed, the earnings can be written off.

I can understand when a company is growing operations that it can be cash flow
negative for awhile, but this is a long time and it hasn't net grown operations
all that much over the past five years.

Thanks,

EKS, I also prefer to scale out of a position. And I often keep a small stub
position. With the utilities I have, I have such a large number in my basket
that I'd rather just sell out the position completely and not have small
position/stub clutter there. These utility stocks frequently move in tandem
now, so any future gains I forgo with one stock, I presume will be made up
somewhat with some gains from other utility stocks.

I'm adding more TPZ. It does trade funny: Can't exactly describe it, but it is
a little off-putting.

Cut back back my BMY shares a few days ago, intending to hold remaining shares
and buy back sold shares at lower price. That part of my plan hasn't worked.
-g- Will continue to hold BMY shares I have though.

NYB. The media reports by some pundits ---who say NYB may have to cut dividend
because there's not enough reserves and mortgage defaults will be higher --
have spooked me, and last month I sold my position. Not sure of my facts here,
it seems much of the properties NYB has are under rent control, people getting
a very good deal being in the properties and not willing to leave for more
expensive similar, so there's big incentive for these people not to default.
And they haven't. And NYB's position is that their reserve amount, small as it
seems to outsiders, is sufficient for the business. Critics say, defaults could
still hit; the properties need costly maintenance maybe not so well-covered by
the rents, etc.

Essentially I've been in NYB for the dividend. For 8% though, if I'm doing
that, I'm figuring, rather than risk NYB I will get the 8% plus or minus, with
a diversified etf and/or bond fund. So I skated on NYB.

Hi Paul - Not too sure where the best place is to find yield but these ETF
Dividend Funds have been losers. There are a lot of cross current w/ weak US$
vs strong US$, low interest rates vs expectations of rising rates, and the
threat of long term inflation.

ETF Dividend Funds - Not so good performance

One Investment to Avoid in Today's Market
http://www.fool.com/investing/dividends-income/2009/11/13/one-investment-to-avo
d-in-todays-market.aspx

From the article:"...So far in 2009, 74 S&P 500 companies cut their dividends,
eliminating an additional $48 billion in annual payouts. Two of the recent
reductions came from Sunoco (NYSE: SUN) and SUPERVALU (NYSE: SVU). All told,
Standard & Poor's expects S&P 500 dividends to decline some 36% this year --
the worst decline since 1938.

Needless to say, these massive dividend cuts have hurt WisdomTree's
dividend-weighted strategy. As of Sept. 30, none of the six domestic dividend
exchange-traded funds had outperformed the S&P 500 since their respective
inception dates.

In fact, the worst-performing WisdomTree domestic dividend ETF has been the
High-Yielding Equity Fund (DHS) -- or, as it was curiously but unsurprisingly
renamed in March, the Equity Income Index. Whatever name it goes by, this
dividend-weighted ETF is down 30% since its inception in 2006, much worse than
the 12% lost by the S&P over the same period.

===============================================================

For 8% though, if I'm doing that, I'm figuring, rather than risk NYB I will get
the 8% plus or minus, with a diversified etf and/or bond fund.

My worry on an ETF Bond fund is with rising rates, the NAV of the ETF will
fall. Can one exit before everybody else wants out? The ETF Dividend Funds have
been losers too. I am chasing yield but also trying to focus on value (company
net tangible assets). I sold my ETF XLF holdings and NYB is the only financial
I own. It's not the best "hold" but if rates rise, I do not think it will fall.
There is specific stock risk with NYB but my total portfolio exposure is only
3%. The bond fund I own is the Vanguard GNMA (VFIXX)(11% portfolio exposure)
but I am no longer reinvesting the dividends.

I am thinking of trimming down the VFIXX and other specific stocks that may be
impacted by the pending interest rate hikes and moving the money into a fund
like TPZ. My thinking is that the underlining assets (and revenue streams) are
not as susceptible to higher interest rates. Maybe a utility ETF fund might be
something to consider. Have you looked at any of these?

This is a difficult transition as the FED will not make their first move for
some time (maybe 12-18 months) as the economy is too fragile. Yet, if you wait
for the first bump higher in interest rates, many of these bond funds will have
sold off and it may be difficult to find a place to park money for "yield" w/o
losing NAV.

I am not too sure how to position the portfolio for this move other than
holding equities that generate consistent revenue streams (from several
sources), have pricing power (to hedge against inflation) and own underlining
assets or technology that can be bought at a discount.

It's global, so maybe not so much affected by rising USA interest rates. Otoh,

RE: ETF Bond Funds

Now I remember, Saturday on the Bob Brinker show a caller discussed the ETF
"MBB" and asked if it was a good tracking ETF for the Vanguard GNMA Fund
(VFIIX). The expense ratio is quite low at 0.25% and the yield is a bit higher
than the VFIIX fund.

http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=MBB#chart3:symbol=mbb;range=20080103,2009111
;compare=vfiix;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logsca
e=on

I still think on any interest rate hike, both of these funds (VFIIX or MBB) NAV
will fall, perhaps as much as 15%. With the ETF you can trade out during the
day and have no limitations on buying back like you do with the 30-day rule at
Vanguard.

The key will be if you have the discipline to exit the position on the first
sign of a Fed rate increase. The VFIIX hit an all time high today at
$10.86/share and according to Brinker the possible downside is $9.00/share or a
17% drop in NAV. Most of my shares were bought in the $9.50/share -
$10.00/share range.

Maybe the call is to use ETF's so you can exit fast but include JXI to the mix
to protect against a falling dollar. I am not too clear as to what the best
approach is but this interest rate cut (stimulus) was unprecedented so the
unwinding of it should be as well.

expensive at 12.54 in my opinion. It just looks expensive because we are used

The low USD (not a USD crash) is good for getting the US out of its jam by
assisting the manufacturing and exported service sectors..

Inflation does not a seem to be an issue yet.. but rates will rise if it
appears and I think there is a good chance the fed may act earlier than many
think... or if the USD looks like it will crash.. (I suspect that the fed has a
'target range' but ya I'm just guessing)..

All my stuff is geared to low rates it seems.. between my high proportion of

4) Some are using different account in China than in their finanical SEC

5) Why do they list at US stock markets at all since their home stock market is
vibrant and they have the choice to list in mainland china and HK? Most other
foreign companies are delisting because of Sarbanes Oxley and other reasons. I
find it strange that Chinese microcaps don't seem to mind.

I have owned AOB on and off. Right now I am in "off state" after reading

Those are good questions and I think one should be careful with chinese

that it may be a question of cost and access to capital markets. It seems to me
like gfre management are going about things the right way. Minco gold listed in
canada, and melco listed in hong kong. I dont know that the accounting for one
is better than the other. As far gfre goes my guess is that they want to
establish and international reputation and they plan to become a much larger
company over time so they will need more access to financing. Also If I were
running a company I would not want to be so dependent on being on the chinese
stock exchange, if i had another choice. I speculate that the companies who
want to delist because of sarbanes oxley are companies that will not be looking
for financing anytime soon and frequently have a controlling shareholder.

as far as problems with unethical accounting i have been burned by that stuff
with us companies many more times than i have fingers going back to the late
60s when land development companies were recording sales after getting 5%

Even now it seems that every year there is some new questionable accounting

Mc, not to worry about bugging me, the question you ask is very insightful and
i would normally agree with your conclusion, but this situation is different.

You will note that a few years back when they lost a lot of money their cash
lost was not nearly as large because the gap closed. On this point the
company's business model has completely changed. They are now subcontractors to
major OEM's, and not nearly as dependent on the US Gov. as they were then.

What you have to remember is the company uses % completion accounting, it is
growing at an extremely fast rate and it's contracts are for long term projects
(anywhere from 6 - 9 months or longer to build out).
The 3 major programs they are now engaged in, The G 650, the A-10 and Sikorsky
work are not going away anytime soon (unless they really screwed up). Their
cash gap will not reverse until they get in full production on these programs,
and that not will not be before 2011. (An example of this is on the G 650,
where this year they will only be producing (or shipping) the first few
shipsets that will be used on the test planes, they have ordered many of the
parts that will be used in the beginning of the production orders.

I think you bring up some excellent points of discussion. My views are similar
to Madharry, but I'll give it my own spin.

I think you have to hold your nose, in general, with all microcaps. Generally,
they're undercapitalized and run still much like a private company.

I agree that Chinese companies dilute too much. One of the reasons is that they
always want to take more marketshare.

No dividends despite good earnings is all too common in American micro-caps.

I think they list in the US because that is where the money is. The per capita
networth of a US investor is much higher than that of a Chinese investor.

In 2008, there were 300,000 high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) in China, with
investable assets worth at least RMB 10 million (USD $1.5 million, ?1.1
million) . Investable assets per capita are approximately RMB 29 million (USD
$4.3 million, ?3.2 million). Their aggregate investable assets equaled RMB 8.8
trillion (USD $1.3 trillion, ?1.0 trillion).
In spite of the global financial crisis, we predict that the number of Chinese
HNWIs will reach 320,000 in 2009, with total investable assets exceeding RMB 9
trillion (USD $1.4 trillion, ?1.0 trillion).
By the end of 2008, 80 percent of Chinese HNWIs lived in 11 provinces and
cities. More than 50 percent of China's wealthy were clustered in 5 provinces:

I suspect that the ability to build wealth in the United States is a great
allure to Asian companies. A bit dated, Tom Friedman talked about Bill Gates'
rock star status in China. I think a Chinese company has made it to the big
show when they list in America.

On an aside note, I don't see the deals on Chinese mircro-caps that existed six
months ago. Many were selling at 2,3,4 times earnings. Many are suspect and it
takes a great of sifting to find something that you think will succeed. I've
been much more of a seller than buyer the last month.

Madharry, I'd guess maybe 4% of my portfolios are Chinese domiciled. I'd like
to increase that to 20%, but I'm too scared I'm too late or that I don't

somewhat by holding diverse companies; cannot hedge the market risk though.

I know this is China's century, but I have trouble investing heavily in markets
where I am one of the least informed investors, and where I think many of the
businesses are ethically challenged.

Given my past experiences with both American and Chinese companies, I'd rather
own a cheap stock with a semi-honest management then a super-cheap stock with
corrupt management, and it is easier for me to ascertain semi-honest management
in the US.

That being said, there is probably something to buying a basket of Chinese
value stocks on big market pullbacks, because you have basically a call option
on improved sentiment on China. It reminds me back in 2002/2003 when you could
buy these net-net tech companies and then saw huge gains when sentiment in tech
improved.

RE: HRP $125 Million 7.50% unsecured Senior Notes

Hi Grommit.

Did you notice that many of the preferred share series of the REIT companies
(eg. BDNpC, HRPpB, HRPpC, HRPpD, FRpK, FRpJ) rallied and approached their post
March crash level highs after the announcement of the pricing of the new HRP
unsecured notes.

HRPT Properties Trust Prices $125 Million 7.50% Senior Notes Due 2019
Wednesday November 18, 2009
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/HRPT-Properties-Trust-Prices-bw-2128887275.html?x

Many of these large diversified REITs w/ commercial real estate holdings are OK
and have been able to refinance their debt. The big question (in my mind) was
at what price was the market going to price new debt?

The answer was provided Wednesday by HRP with 10 year debt at 7.5%.

Therefore both FRpJ and FRpK should trade around $24/share which would
translate into an effective yield of 7.5%. I feel better about my recent
purchase at $14.75/share earlier this month as you never know when you might be
late to the party. Anybody who bought any of these preferred series already
have a two bagger and could well be onto a three bagger once these old issues
trade up to the level of these "new" HRP unsecured notes.

This is just another example of an inefficient market with sellers (most likely
large institutions) bailing out on fear leaving scraps for shrewd value
investors to scoop up and pocket the gains.

Good job for spotting the REIT trades especially those companies that offered
preferred shares.

I can't discern semi-corupt from corrupt from plain honest. I only assume I
might be safer with USA companies because of SEC/Fed/AICPA (accounting)
rules/regs. I believe it's a pretense that the SEC cares sufficiently about
fairness/protecting investors, etc. For China, the crooks better be politically
connected, else if caught, it's possible they could face execution.

Essentially I can't evaluate management trustworthiness. Therefore, I just go
with the super-cheap stocks, assuming I can id a package of such.

GRVY Reported Earnings this morning, filed in a 6-K.

Highlights:

1) Break-Even Earnings, they would have had positive Net Income except for a
litigation settlement accrual (if I'm doing my math correctly) of around $1.5M.

2) It looks like they're having some problems getting their Ice Age massive
multi-player game rolling out the door.

3) Mobile Games were up materially sequentially.

My Thoughts:

1) Currency plays a lot into the results of this company. I expected around
break-even results due to the Won gaining on the Yen (a lot of business in
Japan).

2) I didn't expect a litigation settlement of that size and I hope it's the
last one for a while.

3) Overall, still seems to be a solid value to me here. Low P/E, and a net
current asset/cash play here also. If they can continue to milk Ragnarok and
get some more Online and Mobile games out the door, generating sales and
earnings, the stock price will hopefully follow.

4) Speaking of Ragnarok, I would personally rather they not release Ragnarok 2
too early, alienating their customer base, as long as they still have solid
subscribers on Ragnarok 1. Right now, Ragnarok seems to be their ace in the
hole with a continued following after many years (which is rare in these
massive online games, but seems to be working). Getting new games out there
seems to be a better route of development, unless they feel like they have
Ragnarok 2 at a solid place to rollout and generate serious subscribers.

CW,

I haven't seen a great transition from successful MMO 1 to successful MMO 2
yet. Everquest 2 at least did not lose money, but overall it seems that players
of old game always hate the new one, while it's hard to attract a completely
new crowd to Something 2. So I don't have great expectations for Ragnarok 2,
though even modest success would catapult GRVY much higher.

Gravity's execution is pretty bad, including still unclarified problems with
Ice Age and continued delay of Ragnarok 2. The only advantage is that they
manage to milk Ragnarok 1, even though it is a very old game.

The stock is cheap, but it's not a great buy here. I'll probably keep what I
have but not buy more unless it falls into 1.2-1.3 range or below. I may sell
if stock gets pumped up. Usually I miss great runups in stocks similar to GRVY
because I don't expect huge success and sell too early. (HRAY and KONG are
great examples of where I made money, but left tons on the table.) I usually do
better with companies that are long(er)-term-successful when I buy them
compared to companies that are very cheap (at current assets/cash) but need to
turn around or get bought out or have some significant event to multi-bag-up.
:/

Good luck with GRVY and other stocks. :)

Ot: manufacturing philosophies.

Based on my professional experience in manufacturing, you've described USA and
Japanese correctly.

Don't know about Chinese. With Europeans, I presume with their ISO standards,
they would be looking not only to have the product meet specification (of
course), but also that the product must be in statistical process control (as
is done in Japanese manufacturing).

So difficult back in the day (maybe now too?) to get USA manufacturing types to
understand just because the product met specs, that it was not acceptable to
sit back and do nothing to improve the process and get it in statistical
control.

REITS. "... rallied and approached their post March crash level highs after the

I don't think there is any cause and effect here. LXP had a good announcement
too. They are confident enough about things to restart the cash dividends. So I
bought more LXP-D at +11% yield. And LXP common has a very low P/FFO ratio of
around 4 or 5. The cash dividend is almost 9%, and a low (safe) payout ratio.
(Been buying a bit more AHT-A also.)

but one factor to consider -- the debt:equity ratio of HRP is 1.0 and FR is
2.0. So that alone would make FR higher yield.
