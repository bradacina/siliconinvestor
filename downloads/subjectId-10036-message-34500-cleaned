Paul, yes I wanted to write AVA. The other stock was PM. I still wonder why
utilities all of a sudden had such a weak day. BRKB is also weak recently.

I also noticed that I picked up some more AWK for 17.11$ in my other account.
The stock made a small roundtrip from the 18.XX$ after the better than expected
earning report. The registration for sale is most likely majority owner RWE
reducing their stake. They need some cash after the 10B Euro takeover of that
Dutch utility company. The bullish case for AWK is that they have a large
pipeline of rate cases due to the fact that increases were frozen for a couple
of years when RWE was the sole owner. The other bullish case is that you could
sell AWK stock every quarter for at least 22$. That's the number I playing this
stock for.

Hi Spekulatius - I too noticed that several of my utility and pipeline stocks
sold off. I thought that with their steady dividends and many near their
previous lows, these made good low risk value investments. My biggest concern
looking forward several years is inflation and I do not think utilities provide
a good hedge. Perhaps new money is thinking the same thing.

I am looking at iShares MSCI Australia Index (EWA) ETF. They pay their dividend
each December and is now yielding around 6%. More importantly the ETF basket
owns a lot of natural resource stocks which should do well in an inflationary
environment. This is also a $US dollar play vs the Australian $. If the $US
dollar continues to be debase, the Australian $ should gain in value.

Here are the top ten holdings in the ETF
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hl?s=EWA

The ETF is up over 40% since the lows of March, so I am looking for an entry
point in the low $14 to start a small position. My strategy is to accumulate
shares on any deep corrections and eventually sell an out of the money January
covered call so I capture the annual dividend typically paid towards the end of
December

There is a Candian ETF but the dividend is only around 2%.

E_K_S re Utilities: I wonder why you think they are not a good inflation hedge.
The regulated ones are essentially cost plus type business models . NG is as
cheap as it's going to get and it's NG (plus the spark margin) that determines
the power prices because NG power plants are the big wing producer. As far as
baseload is concerned power generated by coal has nowhere to go than up because
of cap and trade and tougher environmental standards. So unless utilities are
squeezed by regulators, the revenues of utilities should rise faster than
inflation plus the rate of demand growth.

From:E_K_S
Spekulatius - My concern are those regulated utilities that have limits as to
how often and how much they can raise prices. There is usually a very formal
procedure they must follow that may include limits on annual increases. Don't
expect dividends to be increased during an inflationary cycle. Several
utilities are limited as to how much they can pay out in dividends. I guess
holding a bond might be worse especially if you are locked into a low rate.

The NG pipeline distribution companies might be a bit better off. Some of their
operations are not regulated and those that are generally have their ROI fixed
over some period that allows them a reasonable return on their capital
investments.

I guess there is some amount of price protection with owning a (regulated)
utility. It is certainly better than holding cash but I am not so sure that it
is (or will be) a good inflation hedge.

Global Axcess Corp Announces Adoption of Stock Repurchase Program
On Monday May 11, 2009, 1:30 pm EDT

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., May 11 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Global Axcess Corp (OTC
Bulletin Board: GAXC - News; the "Company"), an independent provider of ATM
solutions, today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a stock
repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $150,000 of the Company's
outstanding common stock. The repurchases will occur monthly, at a price per
share of $0.30 or less, over a period of one year. The stock repurchase program
will be funded by cash from operations.

Mr. George McQuain, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, "The first
quarter of 2009 was a strong quarter for Global Axcess. Through our strategic
focus on operational excellence, attention to detail and frugal expense
management we have delivered a profitable quarter even with the CAMOFI and
Wachovia related write offs. These accomplishments validate the strength and
resilience of our operating philosophy.

However, our Board of Directors, our employees and I are not satisfied. We
realize that during that same time period our stock price has languished. For
that reason, we are focusing on strategies to maximize shareholder value.

Historically, we have done a very good job of reducing costs. To maximize
shareholder value we must do more. It is my belief that to maximize shareholder
value the Company must grow EBITDA through profitable sales growth while being
very prudent in the deployment of our capital.

The key consideration for us is what is the best use of our cash?

In light of this, we are beginning to implement a number of strategic
initiatives to maximize shareholder value. Because we believe our stock is
undervalued, the first of these initiatives that we are announcing is this
stock buyback program."

Global Axcess Corp Provides Operational Update
On Monday May 18, 2009, 11:00 am EDT

JACKSONVILLE, Fla., May 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Global Axcess Corp (OTC
Bulletin Board: GAXC - News; the "Company"), an independent provider of ATM
solutions, today is providing an operational update on the Company.

Mr. George McQuain, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, "On the
heels of our first quarter successes when we delivered a profitable quarter
along with resolving the CAMOFI legal issue, we are now assertively
implementing ways to maximize shareholder value.

Last week we announced that our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase
program authorizing the purchase of up to $150,000 of the Company's outstanding
common stock. This action was the first step of our seven-step action plan.

The following six steps are being implemented within the context of putting our
cash to work in ways to maximize shareholder value:

1. Continuing to build cash reserves as a hedge against current economic
conditions and as a differentiating factor among potential investors looking
for a strong balance sheet;
2. Continuing to pay down our debt per our payment schedules instead of
accelerating payments;
3. Foregoing the hiring of an IR Firm, but instead using that money to invest
in building marketing and sales dominance in our market segments. In this
regard, we will be performing investor relation functions in-house;
4. Redefining the company from an ATM management company into a self-service
kiosk company;
5. Investing in ATM growth opportunities and new self-service kiosk
initiatives;
6. Potentially acquiring self-service kiosk businesses that will be accretive
to earnings and which utilize ATM-like business models and utilize our current
operations.

I look forward to further communications such as this as we move forward on our
action plan."

Fwiw, I've decided to start doubling down on my MPW position with the intent to
lower my breakeven point.

Last quarter's report seemed okay to me:

http://birmingham.bizjournals.com/birmingham/stories/2009/05/04/daily39.html?an
=yfcpc

Auto retailers (e.g. LAD) have been doing well recently, possibly somewhat
because "cash for clunkers" gets media attention as politicians consider this
program. Also perhaps somewhat because the GM/Chrsler dealership closures may
ultimately be beneficial to the large/diversified publicly-held dealerships.

I gave up on holding these auto dealership stocks earlier, and now it seems a
little late to be reentering. However, as I look at Penske, its business and
the stock still have some attractive features. Penske is fairly innovative:
they have the USA Smart franchise, and now I read that Avis will have car
rentals at selected Penske car dealerships/collision operations. As with all
these publicly-held dealerships, the positives are they have several brands,
their dealerships are dispersed around the country (PAG in UK, Germany,
elsewhere too), and people will still be buying new cars or used cars or having
need for collision repair. The main concern I see is that they all have large
amounts of debt on their balance sheets, and the d/e ratio is, to my mind, very
high.

That the stocks of all these companies in this sector are up sharply from lows,
I interpret to be that the market is saying now that it looks like these
companies will all come through the troubling times we are now in. I'll take a
few shares of PAG today. Still wary though: PAG has about tripled from lows of
two months ago.

I've got a question.

Some time ago it appeared that everyone was buying ACAS for the extraordinary
dividend yield, and the relative "safety" of the underlying investment(s).
Hindsight being 20/20 and all that rot, ACAS "collapsed" along with nearly
every other high yield stock.

Flash forward to now, and ACAS is showing up on my stock filters as the #1
value stock (by a wide margin, and by numerous "measures" of value). There's a
boatload of problems remaining to be resolved, to be sure, but I'm curious.
Does anyone else here see ACAS as a "work in progress" value stock (probably as
a long term investment, not a short term trade). At $3 and change per share, I
might think about breaking the piggy bank and buying some "just in case"
shares, not a "bet the farm" position.

Any comments or advice or suggestions?

Thanks...

It just appears to me that they had net operating earnings last qtr. and the
realized losses declined significantly from 1.21 to 27 cents. They are working
with lenders on the 2.3 billion unsecured credit arrangement. The differential
between the current 12.32 in net asset value and the price of 3.60 leaves
almost $9 a share on the table/ At 225 million shares outstanding, the
assumption would be total default. The Co. intends to pay dividends again by
Sept 09, and it doesn't appear that they are ready to default. The total loss
last qtr. was $2.65 vs. $4.16 for the prior year quarter. Looks like a Co. on
the mend even after 525 mil in depreciation of portfolio investments.

I wouldn't say my confidence level is extremely high that its going to be a

The following a a recent clip from a poster who analyzed BDN in great detail.
Apparently he is negative on the stock. Perhaps one of you who follows BDN may
formulate a more favorable view than him:

I've taken a new, long look at Brandywine (BDN) following their recent 1Q09
report and subsequent news. As a result, I am selling my small holding of their
BDNprC preferred shares. I still rate the company as a ? in my rating system of
?, safe, or very safe. BDN appears to have good management but they have a lot
of problems, in my view. I would particularly not be a holder of their common
stock.
Here is the basis for my opinion:
BDN's unsecured debt, including their bonds, a term loan and their current
$200M owed on their line of credit is for the next 4 years:
2009: $152M
2010: $434M
2011: $276M (assuming that they extend their line of credit to 2012)
2012: $500M

In their 1Q09 report, BDN said their capital needs were:
$140M on IRS (Old Post Office) building and parking lot development project +
$20M to finish redevelopment 'leaseups', $35M to finish ground-up 'leaseups' +
$30M for maintenance capital expenditures and $25M for new leasing capital
expenditures = $250M. They have since received a mortgage loan for the IRS
building and parking lot that will be paid from escrow upon completion of the
project in 2010. This
should enable BDN to get a construction loan for the entire amount of the
future mortgage loan proceeds, thus eliminating the need for the $140M
mentioned above. Therefore, the total 2009 development capital needed is: $110M

BDN's debt repayments in 2009 were $68M for maturing mortgage, $152M for
maturing bonds and $55M needed to pay 2010 bond holders who accept the recent
BDN bond tender offer (90cents on the dollar).
Recently BDN received $90M by refinancing the $68M maturing mortgage.
Therefore, the total 2009 debt repayment is now: $207M.

In summary, in 2009 BDN needs $110M + $207M = $317M

BDN should generate the following cash in 2009:
$50M of free cash + $24M of tax credit proceeds + $22M (excess of mortgage refi
of $90M versus mortgage loan maturing of $68M) + $36M of asset sales closed +
$85M of asset sales committed but not closed
+ $60M mortgage financing committed but not closed = $277M
BDN should be able to make up the difference between the $317M needed and the
$277M already obtained with additional asset sales and mortgage financing
planned.

Beyond 2009:

If BDN maintains their reduced dividend of $1.20 per year, they will have free
cash in 2009 of slighty more than $50M. This is based on their projection of
FFO for 2009 of $2.12 (midpoint of their range of $2.04-$2.21). The calculation
for free cash is: [$2.12-$1.20)*91M shares - $30M cap ex = $53.7M. I believe it
is optimistic to assume that BDN will continue to have $50M of free cash
available per year due to their upcoming lease expirations:

2009: 9.6% of total base rent
2010: 15.6%
2011: 12.4%
2012: 11.8%
For 2009 - 2012, a total of 49.4% of the existing rent will have to be
recovered though renewals or new leases. They have been getting rent increases
on renewals and decreases on new leases. Their tenant retention in 1Q09 was
78%. However, I doubt if BDN can renew or replace the tenants in the 49%+ of
their leases that are expiring.

Conclusion: If you assume 2009 cash needed is satisfied by cash generated and
if you further assume that all secured debt will be refinanced when it is
maturing (which I believe is very likely after looking at the properties in
detail), BDN still has to come up with
$1.21B between now and 2012 to repay their bonds, line of credit and term loan
coming due. They have enough unencumbered property and enough room within their
covenants to generate at least 1/2 of what they need with new secured
financing. The rest can come from asset sales and the free cash of <$50M per
year.

FFO will suffer as a result of their asset sales and declining occupancy, in my
view. There could eventually be a problem with the fixed charge coverage
covenant. It is likely, in my view, that the common stock dividend will be cut
again.
I think BDN will probably survive but their common stock will very possibly
take a big hit over the next couple of years and, as a result, I think the
preferred shares will also decline over time. I doubt if BDN will ever suspend
paying their preferred dividends.

On the other hand, if the economy improves more rapidly than the current
forecast, BDN will fare better.

Interesting analysis. I see things a little differently but that's what makes a
market. Maybe I try to keep it simple as well.

Analyst estimates are over $2.00 a share this year.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=BDN

They are buying back debt and have an open tender offer.

Tangible book at this time is about $18. Alot would have to go wrong to make
this worth less than $6.50.

The stock is clearly in an uptrend and unlike many others this one has been on
good volume.

management believes to be $20.63 of "Realizable net asset value per share"
(stockholder letter, p. 3 of annual report 3/11/09). Sounds good, whatever
"Realizable net value" means. -g-. Negatives are that the stock is already up a
bunch and more significantly, that it's still very worrisome how or if their
debt covenants will be structured in their creditors' desire to have ACAS go

Google Makes Utility & Smart Meter Friends for Energy Tool PowerMeter
Wed May 20, 2009 2:12am EDT
http://www.reuters.com/article/earth2Tech/idUS420530634520090520

From the article:"...Beyond its new utility friends, Google says it is working
with smart meter maker Itron, which is one of the leaders in terms of market
share. That’s a partnership that will benefit them both. Itron needs help
innovating on the software side, as meter hardware becomes a commodity product,
and Itron has partnerships with other big utilities for smart meter rollouts,
including Southern California Edison and CenterPoint Energy, which will help
Google...."

=============================================================

My strategy is to look at collecting two dividend cycles and if the stock runs
higher, then I will sell the Nov $10 call to further protect me on the
downside. The company still carries a lot of debt which could force a dividend
cut in the future.

Do you own any Integrys Energy Group, Inc. (TEG)? Their subsidiary, Wisconsin
Public Service was also mentioned in the article. TEG pays a nice dividend too.
The company announced earnings guidance for 2011 of between $2.80 and $3.20 per
share and indicated that the Board had approved payment of the second quarter
dividend at a rate of 68 cents per share. The dividend rate was increased to 68
cents per share in the first quarter 2009, marking the 51st consecutive year of
increasing dividends and the 69th consecutive year of paying dividends.

Yes, have a little TEG.

I have been increasing my exposure to utilities.

Couple things going on. First. Okay, I AM a geezer I guess, so okay to sniffle
well what can you expect a geezer to be buying. Utilities - geez could I get
more stereotypical? -g-

OTOH, if I look at utility index vs S&P 500 index charts over many time periods
- one year, five years, longer, I see that utilities outperform the S&P growth
(and I believe that is not even counting the utilities' superior dividends).

Ha. So it's socially okay for people to go around comparing their performance
to the S&P 500, the presumed benchmark. Nobody would ever say though, in all
seriousness, can you beat the S&P utility index (or other utility index)? For
somebody to beat a utility index, why that just seems so obviously easy and
non-competitive. Maybe not so true in fact though.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=XLU&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c= ^GSPC
========================
So as is typical of me, to increase my utility weighting I am carving out a
place in my portfolio for a self-managed utility "index". I've not really tried
to balance one utility vs. another, e.g. to ensure I'm geographically
diversified, or to assure that they are all value stocks. Rather, as I've found
a stock I liked and at a price that seems reasonable, I have been initiating
and/or adding. If anybody has some suggestions for adds or eliminations, please
speak. I claim no expertise with utilities.

Here are all of my holdings now, in no particular order:

MIR TEG BKH EIX CNP AES AVA SO NU ALE EONGY.PK CPL SBS ELP MDU NRG UGI

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MIR,TEG,BKH,EIX,CNP,AES,AVA,SO,NU,ALE,EONGY.PK,CPL
SBS,ELP,MDU,NRG,UGI&d=s

--
A few notes:

Am holding SE too. I can't quite see if that one is a utility or not.

NU has a relatively low price, and relative (to itself) low p/bk. I like it too
because it's aggressive in anticipating electric vehicle demands: "Northeast
Utilities Initiates Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure"
http://nuwnotes1.nu.com/apps/corporatecommunications/empinfo.nsf/0/FE93FA82EFBB
7F5852575910043C7FA?OpenDocument

SO apparently is going to have an issue with emissions, CO2, coal. However with
its large size (27,000 employees) and resources, I figure the stock, near a
12-mo low, with a low p/e of 10, 6.2% div. yield, is at a buy point at current
price. I added a few shares today to a recent purchase.

With most of these stocks, SO for example, they're not going to be
barn-burners, and I figure they've got to be held at least through the
short-term (five years) for the good gains.

Now water utility stocks. That's another category that I like too. -g-
I have several stocks therein.

OCNF - have you looked at the recent dilution? I think they have gone from 20mm
shares to 90mm shares in about 2 months.

They seem to have availed themselves of the agreement to sell stock below
market price via Cornell, which is a firm of ill repute among bulletin board
investors.

The number of related party transactions also is a concern.

Another concern is that their fleet was purchased in 2007, mainly, which would
be the top of the market. I like to value shippers by valuing the ships. I
think the assets may be over-stated at this point.

"As of May 19, 2009, the Company, under the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement,
or SEPA, entered into by and between the Company and YA Global Master SPV Ltd.,
has raised approximately $111.6 million of gross proceeds"
"As of today, the Company has raised approximately $111.6 million in gross
proceeds under the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement or SEPA entered into by
and between the Company and YA Global Master SPV Ltd. The total number of
shares issued and outstanding is 90,394,493 as of May 19, 2009."

Per filings, these new shares have already been sold by YA Global into the open
market. That's what they normally do - they get the shares for about 90% of
market and immediately sell them off. They used to be a practitioner of the
infamous floorless convertibles, until those were regulated away.

"Basic and fully diluted earnings per share $ 0.13
Weighted average shares outstanding 19,926,160

"Purchase Price” shall mean the price per share obtained by multiplying the

YA Global would be the Cornell people I think. This enormous dilution occurred
without a special press release from the company. Smells....

Well, follow-up to my other reply.

I'm a bit spooked about the market these days, thinking we're in for at least a
correction here, and thought I was a bit too exposed to Hotel REITS. So, I sold
the rest of my AHT at $4 and kept my FCH and SPPR.

I think FCH has a little more upside at a lower valuation than AHT right now.
FCH also seems to have bought its hotels longer ago than AHT and therefore has
potentially more cushion on the balance sheet on a market value to mortgage
basis. Hard to let AHT go, but I did. I looked at BEE, but I couldn't pull the

projections. They also own and develop know transmission projects. Earnings are
supposed to surge because their locked in power rates are below market and as
they expire their revenues and earnings are bound to rise. Well that is what it

Natural Gas Falls 9.2% as Demand Is Missing
Natural-gas futures continued their wild ride as a report on gas storage
sparked new worries that demand isn't recovering as quickly as some traders
predicted.

On Thursday, prices dropped 9.2% -- the biggest percentage decline since August
2007 -- as rising inventories in a weekly storage report from the Energy
Information Administration spooked traders. <u> Gas settled at $3.603 per
million British thermal units at the New York Mercantile Exchange.</u>

Gas stockpiles rose by 103 billion cubic feet from the previous week.....

===============================================================
The ratio of the price of NG (per 1M BTU) to Oil (per barrel) historically
averages 6.

<img src='http://ih.fotothing.com/88626.jpg'</img>

At $3.60/1M BTU we are well in the "Sell Oil/Buy Natural Gas" zone. With oil at
$60/barrel NG s/b priced around $10/1M BTU......NG closed today at $3.60/1M
BTU.

===============================================================
There has to be some value opportunities in the NG sector.

Got any ideas for value NG picks perhaps with a utility twist?

I have been thinking about Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB) which you have
mentioned but was a bit timid when I heard that the Venezuelan government
seized (and plans to nationalize) their NG compression and storage facilities
valued around $250 Million.

Continuing to follow you, cwillyg. Sold more AHT $3.90. A loss on that batch.

I'm still wrestling with SPPR. This is where I am trying to get a grip: A buyer
of the stock at current price is sort-of saying, that on average he/or she is
willing to buy a hotel with these figures:

For an 87-room hotel, which is operating at 57% occupancy, buy it by putting up
cash of $282,000 and assuming a mortgage of $1.6M. Book value of the property
is $2.4M. The property last quarter generated $8770 in FFO. Annualize that
(recognizing there'll possibly be --or likely be-- big q vs. q changes), and
the person gets annually $35,000. (And recognize it's not AFFO, but FFO). If it
were a real deal and I was an interested buyer, I might very well go for it as
a sole proprietorship. I'd get about 12% ($35K) on my $282K cash in; I'd put my
family in a couple of the available rooms; I'd get tax advantages (write-offs),
and over time, I'd expect to pay down the mortgage and maybe increase revpar
(now $47) or occupancy rate. This is what lots of people, esp. immigrants do
here, right?-- buy themselves a little business.
Now though as just a buyer of SPPR the public company, I am hesitant. Possibly
because I don't know the business aspects and don't really know how to judge
value here.

=====
SPPR: 122 properties and 10659 rooms. Market cap = $34M. 34/122= $282,000. Ltd
per quarterly report = $192M. 192/122 = $1.6M per property on average.
"Investments in hotel properties Less accumulated depreciation" is $296M.
296/122 = $2.4M.
FFO latest quarter = $1.07M = $8770 per ea. 122 properties.

re NG. WMB is not bad play with infrastructure and exploration assets. They
will have to write off their Venezuelan assets, i think. The NG pure plays are
not exceptionally cheap at this point, except maybe SWX which is very cheap
with respect to its cash flow multiple.

Most unregulated Power producers would be good plays on NG i think, ironically
the best one would be those that don't burn NG, but uncorrelated fuel like
coal, nuclear of hydro power. The reason being that the power prices strongly
correlate with NG so if fuel input cost is independent of NG prices, you are
essentially long NG. Amongst the utilities, D and SRE have substantial pipeline
assets, so you get a second angle there besides just the power prices.

I looked at AGL from the Graham screen for utility stocks, and I passed on it,
and instead chose two others. Looking again at AGL after your post now, now I'm
not sure why I didn't buy AGL.
Mostly rising bv from '03 onward (dropped '02-'03), and looking at stated bv
now of 1.2x, the stock often traded >1.8x in past years (on average). Otoh d/e
has been increasing. In past ten years stock has traded at roughly 12-14 p/e.
Now it's at 10 maybe (on analysts' estimates).
USA seems to have abundant supplies of natural gas (Haynesville, other shales),
and as a regional distributor, AGL "should" participate as USA increases its
usage.
http://www.aglresources.com/about/our_biz.aspx

Dividend yield is a satisfactory 5.9%. This is a small company (I'm looking at
employee count: just about 2400 employees). If there's any further
consolidation in the sector, maybe (?) AGL would be a candidate for an
acquirer.

I'm still considering the several utilities mentioned here by others: SCG, SRE,
WMB, etc. There seem to be an almost overwhelming number of possible companies
to consider. And a lot of factors too.

I'll step up for a few shares of AGL now though. If stock retraces on no
adverse news, and/or as I become more familiar with the company, I'll add to
build a position.

Thank's for the feedback on AGL. OGE Energy Corp. (OGE) caught my interest as
they have exposure to Wind Power (
http://www.oge.com/environment/WindPower/Pages/WindPower.aspx ). Apparently
Oklahomah has quite a few wind farms. I believe T Boone Pickens is an investor
in many of the wind farms located in Oklahomah.

<img src='http://ih.fotothing.com/88733.jpg'</img>

Also OGE Energy owns Enogex LLC, a midstream natural gas pipeline company that
has assets in the Woodford Shale area. Operators restricted completions on
wells and marked down the value of reserves in this high growth (NG) shale
play. Therefore, I believe these assets are selling on the cheap, especially
with the very low NG prices.

You are paying a little bit more for OGE than AGL but with OGE I get some
exposure to both wind and NG resources wrapped up in a regulated utility. From
your earlier list, I also own small positions in UGI Corp. (UGI) and Sempra
Energy (SRE).

UGI has been an excellent performer. I bought my original shares in 2004 for
about $16.00/share. Stock split in late 2005. I recently sold half of my
original position in early 2009 for around $26.00/share.

My largest holding in my utility/consolidator basket is the foreign Brazil
electric company PARANAESE DE EN COPL (NYSE: ELP). They have a lot of hydro
electric power. Their most current earnings (Q1 2009)were good with revenues up
3.3% and net income up 6.5% Year over Year. Not too bad for a world wide
recession. However, the stock is pretty much around the same price I paid in
6/2007. I did generate some income over the years selling some covered calls
but this one has been a poor performer when compared to UGI.

My strategy is to generate dividend income and obtain growth in the value of
these core assets through inflation and/or falling U.S. dollar and/or with the
price of higher Oil & NG in the future.

EKS, about a week ago, you expressed concern that utilities may not be a good
inflation hedge and you were looking for decent dividend plays as perhaps a
more defensive move.

I'm looking for some defensive dividend payers too, but share your concern
about whether utilities would provide a hedge against inflation.

Here's what I'm thinking: IF China continues to back off supporting US
treasuries, US interest rates rise. IF US buck continues to weaken, that's
inflationary. IF US moves away from deflation towards inflation, creditors
require a higher nominal interest rate.

Do utility stocks trade more like a bond than an equity because investors are
looking for yield? Generally, I think so. If that is the case, then a higher
interest rate environment would put downward pressure on utility stocks, much
as T-bills have fallen with T-bill yields rising this past week or two.

Given the above, I like the idea of looking for utilities that have another
attractive dimension, like nat gas, which seems to be at long-term cyclical
lows. I'm also wondering whether it would be a prudent to look at Australia,
Canada or Brazil for those dividend payers, to add foreign exchange
risk/reward.

Hi Paul -

Warren Buffet was asked a similar question regarding rising inflation with a
falling (or weak) US dollar. Would he still want to invest in U.S. companies?
His answer was yes as long as the company was bought at the right price
(value), had a good business where earnings could grow and were some what
predictable years into the future and provided goods or service that people had
to use or buy. Over the long run, his "good" business would far exceed the
return on bonds, especially treasury bills.

His reasoning is that as long as the business met these conditions, they could
raise prices enough to cover any inflationary pressures. Human capitol will
always demand the inflationary adjusted price in a free market. His example was
with the local doctor in a small town.

Many of the "hybrid" utilities I have been scanning seem to fit his conditions
especially "price" as many have sold off to where their PE's are well below
their historical average. Regulated utilities provide services that everybody
must have and use, provide a guaranteed return on capital (especially for new
capital projects built in the future) but could be limited (or capped) as a
true hedge against hyper inflation.

I try to find those utilities that have (unregulated) subsidiaries where they
own the natural resource (NG, coal, oil, tree pulp, bio-fuels including switch
grass,methane and algae, solar, wind, or other mineral rights), have
unregulated distribution businesses (NG pipe lines, electrical interstate
transmission lines) or own unique technologies that can be spun off into
separate business units (electronic meter reading, bio fuel production eg
algae, smart electricity grid transmission distribution, solar panel
technology, at home NG fueling equipment for cars and trucks).

I have discovered that several U.S. domestic (mid-cap) utilities have been
investing in these and other unique unregulated business units that complement
their regulated sister or parent company. Some of these business units could
potentially be a large income contributor in the future or it's assets could be
worth much more (eg NG from shale) with inflation or much higher oil prices.

One of my favorites is Black Hills Corp. (BKH). Paul Senior brought this one to
my attention. They have two hidden gems; Black Hills Exploration and
Production, the oil and gas subsidiary ( http://www.bhep.com/ ) and Wyodak
Resources Development Corp., the coal subsidiary ( http://www.wyodak.com/ ).
The company has been approved to build a new NG electrical generation plant in
Colorado providing for the integration and use of their subsidiary owned NG
reserves.

I have focused my search just on domestic companies as several of the PE's are
now at value prices. For example OGE's PE is 10 (forward PE is 9.4) historical
4 yr PE is 13.5. Based on Yahoo's analysts 2010 estimate of $2.71/share and a
reversion to their mean PE of 13.5, my 2010 price target is $36.65/share, a 43%
increase from today's closing price.

===============================================================

Australia has a lot of natural resources. I have been looking at iShares MSCI
Australia Index (EWA). It sold off to the high 14's earlier this week but
closed today at $15.81. They pay their dividend once a year in December and now
yields just under 6%.

I also like Canada and Brazil. I own energy trusts with properties located in
both Canada and US. Brazil is tricky with my best performer being Petroleo
Brasileiro (PBR).

My key investment theme I have been working on is to identify companies that
deliver needed products and/or services that have core assets composed of
natural resource. To help maintain pricing power, it helps if these core assets
are used by a regulated entity (a parent or sister company) such as a utility.

Thanks for your thorough response, EKS! It sounds like a sensible game plan to
look for "hybrid" utilities.

I'll take a look at OGE, which you also mentioned in an earlier post. I was in
and out of BKH for a quick trade. There was a negative article I came across
about BKH that scared me out of it -- but can't remember the where or why.

PBR was one I should have held.

Really like the commodity and resources theme these days. Heard Tim Seymour

re Utilities. I like utilities because they perform in both inflationary and
deflationary environment. In an inflationary environment there will be stocks
that perform much better. However the same stocks will most likely perform very
badly in an deflationary environment.

My bet would be that we get the former but I don't know. Another possibility is
that we get neither one and just limp along for a couple of years (the
L-scenario). In this case utilities will do OK too and maybe show the best
relative performance relative to the market.

AGL is a good find, I put it on my watchlist. It's a reasonable value. I try
for some at around 27$ where it seems to have some support chartwise.

I think it's 6 of one, half a dozen of the other :O)

US consumer is definitely down right now, I'd imagine maybe even below a normal

Beyond the Chinese stimulus they are (Chinese) ramping their consumerism ...
see Chinese car sales for example.. Now that the big scare is passed for now..
if the BIC countries (not much hope for Russia in here right now IMO) can fill
that void and US can muddle along and manage an L shaped recovery... we are
good.. A lot of ifs there as China starts to protect itself more from US
currency debasement.. That is not a straight line event if the dollar sees a
selling run.. The last dip in the markets was then just a warm up.. That's
really my concern.. US inflation per say is not really the huge issue for
Canucks I figure as long as BIC continues to grow.. We've already lost so much

Interesting article.
It looks like the independent power producers with coal plants might get hosed
- this would have negative implications for EIX (the IPP part), AYE (which I
mentioned before), NRG and most severely MIR. The regulated entities that own
coal plants (AEP,DUK, SO) should be alright (they also have cost recovery in
place ). AEP owns a lot of transmission assets which are mentioned favorably in
this article.

I am reading the Seth Klarman interview here:

http://www.oid.com/public/html/excerpts/Baupost2009/OIDBaupostInHouse.pdf

----
I reiterate: I remain confused as to how he actually selects his picks--- they
make little sense to me based on what I understand what he says his methodology
is. (There's a margin of safety with something like his THRX?) And worse, based
on what I see as I have followed him over the years, his results from the picks
he shows don't seem to me to justify his alleged good record. Of course, like
most pros he keeps hidden what he holds right now, what he's now buying, now
selling, and of any dollar gain/loss on an individual stock- what proportion of
the overall portfolio that would be. Also, several of his picks are so obscure
as to be hard to find where/how or what they trade at.

Anyway, I've followed him into the lp's of Atlas, and that has been a disaster
for him and me. I'm trying now again with a buy this week of a few shares of
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FACT (<span style='font-size:11px'>LAST</span>:
9.31<span style='font-size:11px'> 5/22/2009 4:33:30 PM</span>) . Another
company with no earnings but with cash exceeding stock price. I am holding
several like that, and mostly these stocks are declining as the companies burn
through cash with no or little revenues or profits.

====
Ever since I read Thomas Phelps' "100to1 in the Stock Market", I've always
wondered if I'd ever get a 100 bagger in my lifetime. I suppose I could say,
yes, and Mr. Klarman is responsible for that. Somewhere in the 1980's I guess,
for about $2-$3 at a used bookstore, I bought and am still holding a copy of
his book "Margin of Safety". Unfortunately, as I do with all my investing
books, I highlighted the passages I believe relevant, so I'm guessing the book
is "only" worth 1/2 of the $700 it might still be selling for in pristine
condition.

http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_32/b3996085.htm

Possibly not worth anywhere near $700 nowadays with declines in most things,
but at least I can say I sorta had my chance at cashing in a hundred bagger.

Hello Paul,

I like your Financial Analysis on SPPR. And to me, the scenario you layout of a
12% return is almost enough right there to consider investment. Here are some
other positives:

I think that FFO will improve from the $35k once the economy gets some footing.
In the meantime, they're at $296M of property value vs. $192M of mortgage. A
difference of $100M vs. $34M of current market capitalization. Given that
RevPar has dropped about 1/2 the national average for their hotels, I'm
believing that the property value is still relatively reasonable. They're in
the process of selling hotels to improve their balance sheet.

So, to me, it's a matter of getting some decent FFO now, even after the drop in
RevPar nationally, and waiting for the economy/banking system to recover. But,
if the stock bounces in the meantime like AHT did (4-5x from lows), I would
take my profits in the short-term and move on to something else.

Thanks,

cw

Welcome to SI, CURTM. There are plenty of stocks that meet your requirements.
Although of course, "safe" is a word that is scary to affix with certainty to
any stock, especially in today's economy and with current stock market
volatility.

From your ideas, I'd be guessing you'd want big companies with good history of
dividends.

Eliminating from consideration any companies that have reduced dividends now,
or maybe even within past years.

Possibly one way to confirm safety is to choose from a list of companies that
are raising dividends. Where so many companies are now reducing dividends to
the extent that cutting dividends almost seems normal and acceptable (and it
wasn't before), if we have managements raising dividends, that is a sign of
commitment to stockholders and also management's faith in their ability to
produce continued results that will support the dividend.

To start with, I suggest you also hook up with this SI site, "Dividend
investing for retirement". There there is a focus on identifying and tracking
and listing good dividend payers. Helpful to you would be the stocks of
"dividend achievers" and "dividend aristocrats". As a screen there (although
it's outdated now) I like this post by Steve Felix, for example, and you might
too:

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25431929&srchtxt=dividend%20achie
ers

I would say there would be two types of "safe" dividend-paying stocks that
should be considered and bought in retirement (assuming someone will live 10-30
or more years after retiring). One would be companies where the dividend is
high and sustainable, but maybe where there's not much growth in the dividend.
The second is where the dividend is low, but where over time, the dividend
growth is substantial (e.g. a high dividend yield for somebody now on cost
basis of shares of Proctor&Gamble bought 10 or 20 years ago).

For me, I'm not much willing to step up now for big stocks that have already
moved up off lows. So for example whereas I like MMM for its growth and
dividend and p/e, and a buy now might work out okay over the next few years,
I'm not considering it for a buy now (although I am in with shares bought both
at higher and lower prices than currently). Given my preference, two stocks I
suggest looking at now are ABT and SYY. ABT has an excellent dividend history,
it trades near it's 12-mo low, and it yields 3.6%. Also Sysco Corporation, the
dominant USA food distributor. It has a good history of dividend increases and
yields 4.1%. It's p/e I find is a little high at 13, although it's still a
relative bargain in that in most of the past ten years this quality company has
traded at a p/e of over 20.

Something a little different - a technology stock to balance other types of
dividend payers in a portfolio - would be maybe, maybe Intel. That one's
increased its dividend every year for the past few that I'm looking at, yields
3.7% now, and has plenty of cash to support that dividend, it seems to me.

I have shares in ABT, SYY, MMM, INTC, SO, AGL, JNJ, and TOT and COP. (I hold
more shares of COP than TOT. TOT may be the better buy at this point, I don't
know.)

Good luck with your choices.

I, as well, like SYY for total return. Another possible dividend payer where
the payout seems "safe" is KMB. I own MMM, and the dividend there seems
relatively "safe".
I guess the cautionary word should be that one should question the safety of
virtually everything in the environment we're in.
Witness to that are BAC, C, DOW, I could go on ad nauseum.

Hi Paul -

SCANA Corp. (SCG) looks interesting. I followed you in for a small starter
position. I noticed that they have a few non regulated businesses specifically
a 500 mile fiber optic network and several data centers (
http://www.scanacommunications.com/en/ ) that should provide some future growth
to their main energy & electrical utility business which could eventually
become a valuable hidden asset.

Your approach of looking at the historical PE's and calculating the future
value on a reversion to the mean assumption seems like a good way of
identifying "potential" value in these utilities. According to SCG's 2008
statistical report (
http://www.scana.com/NR/rdonlyres/87D7ED5D-6915-4225-A5F9-FD7BCD0357A3/0/2008st
tisticalsuppliment.pdf ) the 2008-2003 historical PE's are as follows: 12.1 %
15.4 % 15.2 % 14.0 % 17.1 % 13.5 % with a six year mean value of 14.55. Based
on Yahoo's 2010 analysts mean estimate of $3.02, the reversion to the
historical (six year) PE mean price for SCG s/b $43.94/share, a 50% increase
from the current price.

The 6.4% dividend should provide a good backstop if the market turns sour
again. The stock is near it's seven year low of $25/share. Any retest of the
lows, this should be a good one to add to.

Also, I see that SCG is tagged by Schwab as a "HTB" (Hard To Borrow) security.
I am not sure why this is (perhaps arbitrage with the preferred?), but if there
is any reason to begin covering, SCG could move back to it's mean PE price
faster than some of the other non HTB utility stocks.

FWIW, Schwab rates the utility sector as "F" and SCG gets a "D" rating based on
Schwab's algorithm: It gives negative scores for
- Free Cash flow generation
- Efficient mgmt of working capital
- Ability to internally fund capital
- Earnings alignment with operating cash
- Recent share purchases by informed investors

Of course, based on today's jump in SCG, the Schwab ratings might be taken with
a grain of salt.

I've made some good gains on some stks they've rated "D" in the past, like TIE,
