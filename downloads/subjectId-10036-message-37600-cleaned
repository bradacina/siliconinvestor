What buffet says is right. Make the analysis and stick to the plan. Stock
prices on the screen are just that, daily blips. Ignore the noise. Part of me
wonders if I should have cashed and rebought yesterday but I promised myself I
would not turn into a day trader so I held. It has pulled back as expected but
nothing has changed info wise from the day I bought it at around 30 cents, so I
will hold. anytime a stock moves over 100% in a few days you are going to
attract the day traders and bandwagon folks so it is bound to jump around as a
result. I will wait for earnings. Behind the noise someone is buying a lot of
shares......

For those wondering what we are talking about it is MBHI. just another regional
bank on the brink of collapse but when I took a deeper look I liked the cash
position, management change and position in the local market. so far so
good....

It has been a huge month for me. Overall in the last 12 months since I opened
this fidelity account I am up over 100%.

recently sold NIHD, and HOT added to LNC and NOV. I love NOV. stock has been
stuck in low 40's for way to long based on the numbers. could and should break
to $60 in the next 12 months.

I am not interested in buying any financials unless it's a fireside sale. GS at
$120.00/share might qualify. GS Credit Default Swaps are currently priced like
a third world country. If congress wants to set an example and GS is the
scapegoat, its possible GS could sell that low. It's important that the general
public see how these investment banks work and how greed can influence their
ethics in how they run their business. GS is no different than any of the other
firms. I just don't think that any legislation can really clean this type of
action up.

why sell? I bought it based on the fact that this bank would 1) either return
to being profitable or 2) be bought out or merged. I still feel the same way
today and apparently someone else does as well. no news has come out so that
means nothing has changed since I bought it (except of course the price). I
bought this to see it through and so I will. Of course next week I could be
sitting here with zero and wish I played it differently but I will stick to the
original plan.

so far new management has been executing EXACTLY as they said they would. For
now I will put my faith in them, and the increasingly improving position of

I admit that I am biased. I dont think much of GS ethics, how ever so far
watching the hearing the congress people are coming accross as misinformed
irate buffoons. one of them suggested making market makers having fiduciary
responsibilities. can you imagine goldman sachs marketing treasuries or long
term bonds saying its our duty to inform you that we think these are terrible
investments and that you are much better off in TIPS or hard assets. The
senators dont seem to grasp the notion that GS is a market maker meaning they
are making a market. market makers are frequently short. If they cant be short
how do they make a market. Only a moron would expect them to offer you unbiased
advice as to whether buying or selling is the right thing to do. As far as
making money being short the mortgage market, thats what they do, i dont see
anything wrong with that. It wasnt illegal even if the were net short for a
long period of time. This looks some feeble attempt to shift responsibility for
disastrous national mortage policy, poor regulators and ludicrous rating agency
decisions on to a major market maker who made a lot of money off this.

I just wish we would have seen this kind of questioning before Congress offered
Paulson and Geithner carte blanche in giving the store of ways. I say fire all
the incumbents including Geithner and Summers.

This looks like less an attempt to figure out what future restrictions to
impose on market makers than a desperate attempt of some of these incumbents to
get re-elected.

I agree that there is plenty of blame to go around. Congress is just as guilty.
rating agencies also failed. That said the biggest issue for me is the fact
that IMO GS is an investment bank thus people pay them for advise. They are not
etrade. If you use etrade you expect bids and asks and a way to trade. Seems to
me when you invest with GS or another investment bank they are more than that.
Maybe I am just wrong or misinformed but it is the way I feel. Plus it does
seem that they had way more information then they gave their clients. They knew
it was falling apart and they knew why.

the rating agencies we wrong but not because they knew the stuff they were
rating was crap. they were just stupid. GS knew what was going on the whole
time. they knew the the ratings folks were stupid and wrong. now if they were
just trading for themselves and their clients and taking a position on the
short side so be it. that would be smart. but to take the short side and SELL
the long side to other clients. Well that seems off to me...

Goldman Sachs operates in many different capacities. I have never worked with
them . but if you are using them as a market maker they are not really advising
you. I mean if you buy long term T bonds through then and then interest rates
shoot up and you find that GOldman was short bonds, do you think you should be
able to sue because Goldman did not disclose that to you? On the other hand if
you are part of an M&A and you use goldman then they are advising you , or if
you use them to set up a collar on your options or you have funds that they
manage for you they are advising you and maybe you have a case if they are net
short T bonds in the their own portfolio while your portfolio consists largely
of T bonds.

I dont have that kind of a breakdown. I try to buy where i think value is. I
have owned DGC.to for quite awile and decided to reduce my position because it
is totally focused on one gold asset which is still very far from production. I
have a very large stake in SLW because i like silver long term and they are
leveraged and will have streams from many of the largest mines going forward so
its a unique holding. Then i have smaller position in other miners, and larger
positions in a closed end canadian gold fund and a closed end candaian ag fund
that are selling at 30%+ discounts. and MFCAF is also commodity focused as a
trader and financier. I dont own any copper names at the moment. and I have not
had good experience with my energy names so I decided to limit investing in
that area, although i do own some VNR, mostly because I got it cheap, and in
the real estate area i own MPW NEN and a malaysian company which also has palm
oil plantations.

Right now I feel strongly there is a lot of value in GS. I spent hours
listening to their testimony in front of congress, and I believe that its hard
to go wrong buying a dominant world class firm that is profitable at close to
book. I also thought the first group that appeared before congress came across
way better than the senators who were doing the questioning.

Thanks for the reply, Madharry. I watched the GS hearings also. I was not
impressed with the Senators at all.

In regards to raw materials, I still have some TGB (Copper producer and
hopefully gold in 2012), but just bought a gold miner mutual fund in my IRA.
It's more of a hedge against this europe financial crisis (and the general
spending by global governments) than anything, but it seems like the gold
miners as a group are relatively undervalued on a historical basis compared to
the Gold price.

I do have some oil plays including ATPG and PEO (Closed-End Fund). I think
between Precious Metals and Gold, I'm probably up to about 30% of my portfolio,
which is why I asked the question.

Thanks for the reply.

more confidence in the company or stock. They have over 15,000 people and $1.7B

Otoh, in .08, company earned $.49/sh.; their estimate for '09 is or was .50/sh.
I believe they should be able to make it based on '08 performance and '09 first

are you not concerned about the murkiness of the financial condition? Im not an
expert on bank accounting but i understand they have lots of leeway on marking
to market. I think there are way too many banks in this country now, and most
of them are pretty useless at least for lending. I use two and have spoken at
the branch level probably to another dozen in my area. The branches dont seem
to be staffed with knowledgable people, there seems to be no interest in
anything but gathering assets and consumer or mortage lending, all of this can
be done much more efficiently be larger institutions with on line capability
and 24 hour call centers. I bank locally because they now offer 3% interest on
checking, used to be 4%. I just see brick and mortar based banking as a relic
like the phone booth unless staffed by knowledgable people in a niche area. I
remember talking with a guy once who had been trying to develop a business
consulting with small banks and helping them develop international banking
skills. He concluded that there was a reason small banks were small.

I'm passing on all these small banks too. Too tough for me to figure why their
businesses would recover, and I've not had much success in past with buying the
small banks, or mutual conversions. I have taken losses in small banks just
operating in my own local area - I've wrongly assumed I might have some
advantage if I could sense economic conditions and see how the local banks were
doing regarding construction lending. That experience has soured me on buying
dink banks that operate in communities I know nothing about.

I'll leave these small banks to experts or diligent researchers or
knowledgeable people like Peter Lynch and Spekulatius. Looking up a notch, I
periodically consider regional banks, and I also keep passing on these.

I like South American banks. They just seem to have better business prospects
and better loans than USA banks. Bwdik. I maintain positions though (Brazil,
Colombia).

Only USA bank I've bought this year is http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WASH (<span

A fill for me today for Pfizer Inc. (PFE). Forward PE quite low at 7.5 and with
a 63% payout ratio they still pay a dividend that yields 4.3%.

Stock continues to be sold after hitting a recovery high of $19.50/share in
January. My last buy was DEC 2009 at $18.50/share, so with the price now around
$16.50, it's selling at a 10% discount to what I thought was a bargain only
five months ago.

This is one of a few stocks where the price is below its monthly, weekly and
daily MA. If it can close above it's 50 week MA (at $16.90.share) then we may
start a slow upturn back to the $20.00/share price level.

My plan is to sell my higher priced shares that I bought in May 2005 in 31
days, harvest my loss and still maintain my overall share position.

Companhia Paranaense de Energia (ELP)

Stock goes x-dividend today. Sold out my entire position that I began to
acquire in June 2007 at prices between $14-$16. My average annual return was
around 14% plus the 4% annual dividend.

During the 3 year period that I held the stock, it outperformed the S&P 500 by
40%

http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=ELP+Interactive#chart10:symbol=elp;range=200
0507,20100427;compare=
^gspc;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on

What's interesting is if bought a year earlier or a year latter, the relative
return vs the S&P 500 would have been 150% and 80%. Therefore, it goes to show
that buying and adding on the dips and selling at the peeks can significantly
improve your returns (at least for this stock).

I have been adding to my domestic NG utility holdings that pay a higher
dividend and could be poised for better long term growth. Empire District
Electric Co. (EDE) is my replacement for this stock which I was able to work
into (beginning Feb 2010) with an average cost of $16.27/share with a dividend
yield of just over 7%.

I may revisit ELP if it sells back down to the $15.00/share level.

re Banks -
I agree there are too many banks out there (the latest FDIC count is #7928) but
that does only means that there is going to be consolidation going on.
Consolidation can be very good for the small guy if he get's bought out, which
happened a lot from 2002-2005. There is actually not that much leeway how
assets are classified, they are either performing or not <g>. Assets are not
market to market unless they are for sale. This is true for all banks even the
large ones like BofA. Most community banks have quite transparent balance sheet
compared to larger banks or JPM and GS which has ton's of derivatives etc.

The FDIC website provides a standard breakdown of assets, earnings, NPA
(non-performing assets) etc. that can be a powerful tool to get a pretty good
assessment of the operating performance, even if the earnings releases don't
have that level of detail. in addition there are ratings available from third
party like Bankrate The TheStreet (based on FDIC #) that allow a small investor
to gauge the health of an institution in less than 5min.

Furthermore the market for small banks is chronically inefficient (great for a
value investor) and once you learn how to play the game you can do it over and
over again because there are some many stocks available.

Many small banks do exactly what we want the larger banks to do. Borrow and
lend, take a 3-4% margin, no funny trading business, 8-10% tangible ratio. The
larger banks mostly become large because of acquisitions and as we all know
that is not necessarily good for the shareholder.

I own about 10 small bank stocks and it's a substantial part of my portfolio.
Just today I bought a stock of <0.8 TBV, 9X earnings, 5% Dividend yield, <1%
NPA, 4**** rating by safe and sound only 10% off it's 5 year low. Go figure.

I also went local with a Credit union this year and gave BofA the shaft. I hope
that more people would do it (I think there are some) our country would be
better off.

it sounds like a good strategy, having worked for banks for most of my
employment years and being in credit support ive always found banks very
difficult to analyze. it was always hard to assess whether the loan loss
provisions were accurate and they were frequently hedging away interest rate
risk too. But if it works for you great. we are all trying to scratch out a
living in different ways. I filled out my position in GS today. We will see
whether i was opportunistic or premature. Im anxiously awaiting Cowens next
report. I was listening to a hedge fund manager on Bloomberg and he might be
biased but he is predicting more growth for hedge managers as underfunded
pension plans try to play catch up. Makes sense to me, which is another reason
I like COwen and GS too. They have a pretty large asset management business.
Ive thought about how the increased regulation of banks would impact GS and i
think they could just turn in their banking license since they dont use it to
borrow money anyway.

NG pipeline (1,118 miles of distribution mains) that I like. They paid about
$3.00/share for the NG pipeline a few years ago which I think will increase in
value. They also own and operate water pumping facilities and distribution
systems (87 miles) so you also get a hybrid water utility at 13.53 x next
year's earnings. They received 75% of their proposed rate increase last month
(their first requested rate increase in several years), so I hope their current
dividend of $1.28/year is safe. At least their pay out ratio will be under 100%
when their rate increase kicks in. My EDE average cost is $18.27/share not
$16.27/share I posted it incorrectly up thread.

This one is going to be a very slow grower. I have a price target of $22/share
but it will only get there when the other larger more well known NG pipeline &
hybrid utility companies move higher in price.

My only other Brazil stocks include PBR, BBD, FBR, GGB & ULTR.

I continue to hold these but might want to add to my PBR. My last buys for PBR
were in October 2008 between $23/share-$24/share. I have a few shares in
inventory that I paid $67/share so I could average in some $40/shares which
might be a good way to harvest my loss.

Some of the Brazil supermarkets have done quite well. They still seem expensive
but might be worth an exploratory position. CBD is traded on the NYSE (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grupo_P%C3%A3o_de_A%C3%A7%C3%BAcar ). It's near an
all time high and seems richly priced at 16x next year's earnings. CBD was a
bargain last October at $23/share. The stock might be a buy at 12x next years
earnings (similar to what WMT's next year's PE is) or around $50/share. At
$66/share, I will pass.

Today, the company has around 1.807 stores throughout Brazil

Grupo P&#227;o de A&#231;&#250;car operates through different store concepts
(and different banner logos):

* P&#227;o de A&#231;&#250;car (196 supermarkets);
* CompreBem (165 supermarkets; includes ABC CompreBem);
* Sendas (63 supermarkets);
* Extra Hipermercados (72 hypermarkets);
* Extra Eletro (55 home appliance stores);
* Assa&#237; (29 stores).
* Ponto Frio (455 stores).
* Casas Bahia (560 stores).

What's your take on Brazil and is it a good time to start a new investments at
this stage of the economic recovery? I am inclined to hold off until October
when the stimulus money ends and see where the "true" economic growth prospects
are.

In addition, it's ratio of NPAs has escalated to 8%+. Its texas ratio shoot up

re BYLK.OB - this is an interesting one. tangible book value is about 9.74$,
stock is trading at around 5$. The interesting thing about BYLK.Ob is that
their NPA are down dramatically from a peak of 56M$ 3/31/2001 to 33M$
3/31/2010. This is remarkable and unusual. They seemed to have run with a high
NPA ratio since 2006. Maybe going into this recession helped them in a weird
way.

http://www.baylake.com/Press-Releases/2010/04.21.htm

They are rated 2* by safe and sound but that is based on information from
9/30/2009 so is outdated. the question how and why the NPA's went down would be
critical. it looks like the risk management officer hired in 2007 made a big
difference. If the trend NPA if for real, than BYLK.OB is a great bargain.

I spent some time looking at this. What I come away with is:

1. 80% loans are reals estate related
2. major market is tourism and agricultural
3. They suspended their dividend and have been raising money in other ways
including 10% debentures. In order to reinstate the dividend they need the
approval of some governmental body.

I live in a resort area as well and Ive seen year over year declines in
visitors, and the local economy. One of the larger B&Bs made headlines when the
owners suddenly hightailed it out of town, leaving the financiers to pick the
pieces. In a nearby town one of the nicer restaurants is now vacant with
restaurant and building it was in for sale.

In short I think there are plenty of warts on this one to account for a bargain
price. I do not want to invest in a bank that is not paying a dividend but is
paying 10% on debentures.

I might have a different take on this if I were convinced that the touted
economic recovery was benefiting more people but I havent seen it . Right now I
prefer to put money into more global situations.

This wasn't published in a report with any explanation. My brokerage account
through Merrill Lynch allows me to screen using S&P's Fair Value criteria. I
occasionally use it to see if anything pops up that I like. It sometimes even
shows stocks mentioned on this board.

Their fair value calculations are updated weekly for large cap companies. HBI
popped up today and I estimated the numbers from the graph. S&P has issued no
report that I can find. That's why I'm asking you guys. I just don't see the
reason for the huge pop. If I can figure out how, I'll post a screenshot of the
graph.

S&P says their Fair Value criteria is "proprietary". So, yes, it's a black box
number.

Here's what today's screen showed me. According to S&P's Fair Value
calculation, the following 28 stocks are undervalued by 39.2% or more:

AHII, IRE, CBST, DOVR, ENH, EXM, FRPT, FRX, FUJIY, GVP, HBI, IBKR, KCI, KOG,
LUKOY, UEPS, OCR, PTNR, MALL, GOLD, RGA, SAY, SHFL, SKH, SLM, SUNH, SPWRA.

Some of these are junk IMO. A lot of them have been showing up for a long time.

suggesting these are value stocks by anyone's standards.

Madharry - what you say about the economy is generally true, also I see that
restaurants are way busier than they were a year ago and I think travel is
picking up again. But the key point is that BYKL has shown a remarkable
reduction in NPA and if you believe that this is real, than this bank's health
is rapidly improving and then this stock trading at less than half tangible
book is a bargain.

I own a few bank stocks and I can tell you that in this recession, the banks
management and risk culture matter way more than the local demographics. I have
seen some local banks sailing through this recession with nary a dent on their
balance sheet and other have disintegrated. BYKL looked like it would
disintegrate 2 years ago starting with a scary level of NPA (while most other
banks were still looking good balance sheet wise) but now they are looking
pretty decent.

I would not be worried about the dividend - that will take care of itself once
the balance sheet is fixed. Also I don't understand your focus on dividend with
banks stocks, if you are holding stocks like COWN which are unlikely to ever
pay much of dividend.

With BYKL, i have not made up my mind yet. I think it's interesting and might
be a good one to contact management and ask some question regarding NPA and
risk management. From a 10-k read it does not seem like they are simply easing
payment terms to kick the can down the road.

problems to the extent that they are not allowed to pay dividends. Its a
business that i dont particularly care for and I have no idea what the assets
are really worth. On top of that the ceo owning $15,000 of stock doesnt inspire

lots of litigation to recover.

Get your "value" trigger ready for BP but let it fall another 20%-30%. Once all

April 30 (Bloomberg) -- Buyers of high-yield, high-risk debt are betting that
President Barack Obama is leading the U.S. economy to an enduring recovery.

Investors have gobbled up $99.6 billion of junk-bond sales in 2010, a record
for the first four months of the year, including the most bonds to fund
dividends for private-equity firms since before the credit crisis began in
August 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Standard & Poor’s LCD.
Prices for the average speculative-grade security climbed to 99.7 cents on the
dollar this week, the highest since June 2007, up from 54.8 cents in December
2008, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II
Index.

The return of an appetite for risk shows growing confidence that the U.S. will
avoid a double-dip recession, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s
Capital Markets Group. Profits for companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
surged 176 percent in the final three months of 2009, and the U.S. economy grew
at a 3.3 percent annual pace in first quarter, according to the median forecast
of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, after expanding 5.6 percent in the
fourth quarter.

The junk-bond rally demonstrates “a sense that the worst is over for the U.S.
economy and that a self-sustaining recovery could materialize by the summer,”
Lonski said in an interview from his New York office. High-yield, or junk,
bonds are those rated below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and lower than
BBB- by Standard & Poor’s.

The chief executive of BP said in an interview Thursday he expects a tougher
regime for oil companies as a consequence of the spill. BP hired the rig that
caught fire and sank, resulting in the spill.

"Regulators will want to understand how this occurred and quite reasonably wish
to introduce additional regulation, if that's appropriate, to prevent it
happening again," Chief Executive Tony Hayward told The Wall Street Journal.
"You certainly won't see BP standing in the way of that."

****Asked whether the spill could prompt calls for a moratorium on drilling in
the Gulf of Mexico, he said: "I'm certain some people are thinking that might
be necessary."*****

Such a move would pinch global oil supplies. It would also be a blow to BP, the
largest oil producer in the Gulf, with output of more than 400,000 barrels a
day. BP has been a driving force behind exploration in the deepwater part of
the Gulf and has made several huge oil finds there in recent years.

Mr. Hayward said any investigation would focus on why the failsafe mechanisms
for the well's shut-off system, known as a blowout preventer, weren't
activated. He said regulation of the blowout preventers would likely be
tightened and a tougher testing regime introduced.

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the doomed rig lacked a
remote-control shutoff device commonly used in other major offshore
oil-producing nations.

Myself, I'm not so happy about analyst downgrades unless I am really confident
that I know something that the analyst doesn't.

I completely understand the attractiveness of a huge discount to NAV, but when
bondholders ask for almost 12% interest and the company is rated B, it means
there is a non-negligible bankruptcy risk. Those kind of situations are not my
typical "back up the truck" deals, as I have become wimpier in my middle age.

I realize that anyone who looks at my picks might not believe me given some of

more than solvency risk.

well looks like your mid 140s are there, and I caught a little more of this
falling knife. As I ponder what has taken place, the market reaction and those
of the analysts seem odd to me. Reading the news releases it seems clear that
this investigation has been on going for weeks now. the governmental agencies
did not release anything official. rather the wsj reporters supposedly ferreted
this info out from unnamed sources.
My guess is that the information was either leaked to them by proponents of the
financial reform bill or by short sellers.

In the meantime the CEO of GS is taking to the airwaves in a big way to explain
the difference between their function as a market maker and an advisor. On
charlie rose last night he noted that GS had turned over some 20 million
documents, letter, and emails and that they have 36000 employees, and that the
senate focus on 10-15 emails that were inappropriate does not really reflect
the mindset of the organization. The CEO makes a good impression me but then Im
biased. He seems like a candid bewildered guy, who was genuinely surprised by
this output of anger at GS from people that they dont deal with as customers.
He still need to explains better that Market Makers have to go short in order
to reduce their risk frequently and of course that for a market maker there
really isnt any difference between going short or long.

Perhaps Im the captain strung to the mast of a leaking ship, I just dont see a
whole lot coming out of this other than goldman settling with the sec after
some diluted financial reform bill passes. The senators seemed so clueless
about how financial intermediaries and the markets work that I dont see how
they can pass effective legislation.

quarterly earnings. I never got in when you first mentioned it and have been
wanting to add LG to my basket of NG stocks.

The company reported a 9% decrease in profits and a 4% decrease in revenues for
the quarter (YOY). The drop off was due to slightly lower margins in their non
regulated business but they had higher overall profits in their regulated
businesses. They do continue to do better from Q1 to Q2 but their non-regulated
subsidiary, Laclede Energy Resources, reported 1/2 their last year's revenues
basically as a result of much lower NG prices.

The company generates excellent cash flow at $11.00/share and fits Buffet's
criteria for total debt to annual revenues of no more than 3:1.

My thinking is that if the company is profitable with NG at historically low
prices (ie $3-$4 per mcf), once NG moves to more historical price levels,
earnings should benefit. Their PE at 13 is a bit less than many of the other
pure NG pipeline companies I own (except ATO which I recently bought). They
continue to pay a consistent 4.5% dividend reflecting 9 increases over the last
16 years (a 30% increase over 16 years) while maintaining a payout ratio below
60%.

The stock sold back to its 200 day MA Friday down 3.5% from it previous day's
high with only average selling volume based on their poor earnings report.
Therefore, I added a small position thinking this might be a good entry point.

Like you said, this is a boring stock with not much movement or trading volume.
I am thinking of building the position on any additional sell off, perhaps to
the low $30's and then selling an out of the money covered call on a portion of
the position. The stock has traded as high at $55/share when NG and oil prices
were selling much higher. Otherwise, you can expect the company to trade in a
15% banded trading range between $30/share and $35/share.

Atmos Energy Corporation (ATO) has a similar financial profile but has
operations in a different geographical region (ie Texas). Laclede Group Inc.
(LG) has more NG storage assets which s/b in more demand as NG drilling ramps
up in the next 3-5 years in the Balken and other prime US shale regions. Both
LG and ATO should benefit from this increased drilling activity as Texas and
Louisiana are considered prime distribution points for NG and LNG gas.

I am still trying to find companies that deliver and store NG in the Northeast
Region of the U.S.. Here is a pretty good list of companies that operate in
this region (Natural Gas Pipelines in the Northeast Region -
http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis_publications/ngpipeline
northeast.html ). I am specifically interested in those companies that deliver
and operate LNG facilities near the coast ports.

Finally, LG has underperformed several of my other basket of NG companies so it
could be the next one to move higher in the group.

My starter position in LG is less than a 1% portfolio addition. However my
basket of NG stocks (about 17 so far) comprise of companies that own or operate
NG assets including working wells w/ long term reserves, pipeline & tanker
operations, gathering & storage facilities, NG electrical generation facilities
and consumer retail propane distribution franchises. These companies now
account for about 15% of my taxable portfolio. I am always trying to find
companies from around the world which have a NG component and theme that I can
add to my growing group.

I also own shares in the Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Corp. (NYSE: TYG) fund.
Paul Senior first mentioned this fund last year. It operates at a reasonable
management fee and trades on the NYSE w/ ok daily volume. They hold a basket of
publicly-traded master limited partnerships (MLPs) that operate in the energy
infrastructure sector. This allows me to stay away from owning the actual MLPs
and still receive the nice dividend stream (currently yields 12.5%).
