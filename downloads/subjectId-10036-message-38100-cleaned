Well, McSweet, ATPG is a bit tricky these days. To me, lots of risk and lots of
reward. But, I'm in with a good position.

Where do I start... To me, the potential cash flow implications are hard to
analyze because there are many possibilities.

1) It's uncertain if any wells/rigs ATPG currently has in play are impacted by
Obama's recent accouncement. It appears that one of them is, but nothing is
certain at this point.

2) The second issue is can ATPG still move forward to completion with all of
their planned Telemark activities this year. They may have already drilled all
they need to for their new wells, but maybe not. I would be surprised if they
could move forward unaffected, but it's possible. Lots of questions...

3) And what about increased insurance costs and increased safety costs needed
for ATPG?

I guess my overall view is that ATPG was around these levels in 2009 when the
price of oil was much lower, before they refinanced their debt (thank goodness
they did this!), and before they started producing from Telemark in large
amounts. I'm hoping that based on their assets, they have a good chance of
making it through this period of uncertainty one way or another towards future
serious cash flows - a better chance than I would have given them to make it
through 2009 (which they did, of course).

If you are looking for financial models, there are a lot of people on Yahoo
cranking them out, but there is a lot of junk to sort through there also.

Thanks,

ATPG. Because ATP is deep-water GOM, an ATP analysis has to include the
ramifications of the GOM oil spill and government's subsequent responses, such
as delaying permitting or increasing inspections. There's right now some
question as to which exploratory wells or production-ready wells in the Gulf
are immediately affected. (ATPG may have one or more.) In my opinion, it's too
soon to see exactly how ATPG will be affected by these new rules and
promulgations. That said, it still seems to me ATPG's major producing platform,
Titan, will continue its hookups and its planned increases in production. With
this, the stock, imo, is very undervalued. The market seems to strongly
disagree.

For a "nice, detailed analysis", a purely numerical one though (spreadsheet),

I like it better than almost all other shale areas which are being opened up

I took a look at the spreadsheet. The risk with ATPG is that the good things
(like positive FCF) start happening only in 2011 and later. Meanwhile the bad
things - possible well delays, cost increases, etc. - are happening right now.
ATPG will have to navigate these issues and possible cash outlays like they did
in 2009. Obviously they are in a better situation right now but the price is
also 2.5x 2009 lows.

I bought a small tracking position on Friday.

re ATPG model - this is an interesting valuation model. one thing I noted was
is that he seemingly did calculate ATPG value in different ways. I also think
that the way he did is on 3/30 does not fully account for the risk. ATPG
capital structure is 2/3 debt and 1/3 equity and debt get paid first. His model
estimates for capex seem way too lower as well.

In a way his model does not account for a variation of outcomes (safety
margin). the way do do this is not tto add a variance to the end product - the
NPV but too look at a variety of scenarios because if they make a mistake along
the way the equity will never get the FCF, but the bondholders will.

This might be the case where the true believer buys a mix of bonds and stock.

more ATPG - the other problem that I see with the NPV calculation is the
reserve valuation. They own about 212MBOE (proved and probable) so with an EV
of 1.7B$ that is about 8$/BOE. This seems low but not much lower than some
majors.

My favorite TOT for example owns 10B BOE proved and about 20B BOE proved and
probable and the total EV is 120B$. So per BOE I arrive at a # of 12$/BOE
(proved) and 6$ BOE (proved and probable). Well that is cheap too.

Now ATPG reserves could be worth more because they are located at the GOM and
royalties are very low in the US compared to almost anywhere else in the world,
but now we need to throw in a discount. Now is ATPG cheaper or more expensive
than TOT you can guess this yourself.

Still I am tempted to play ATPG - the price seems to swing so much and if fears
are overblown, this will get back to 20$ fairly quick. Worst case we have a
zero but I think that 20$ are much more likely than zero and there is potential
for prices substantially >20$ too, so I think risk reward is favorable.

Couple reactions on SGU:

1. If you subtract the $180mm of goodwill, it has $140mm of book value, or
about $2 per share - selling at 2x book. If you eliminate the income tax
benefit of over $50mm, the 4.55 PE becomes something closer to 10x. Not sure
that distribution rate will continue either - it's been inconsistent.

2. I like to use enterprise value over operating profit as a replacement for a
PE ratio. I get enterprise value at around $400mm.

3. Annual operating profit that has ranged recently from a loss of $28mm in
2005 to a gain of $80mm in 2009. I believe profitability has been high lately
as oil prices declined at wholesale a bit faster than at retail. Difficult to
determine a normal average income - maybe $40mm as a conservative estimate.

4. That gives me a 8x to 10x multiple of operating profit. On the surface, not
a great deal at all. Perhaps some underlying business dynamics have changed,
but I didn't go that deep.

5. This is a shrinking business - "For fiscal 2009, we lost 30,200 accounts
(net), or 7.5% of our home heating oil customer base, as compared to fiscal
2008, where we lost 18,300 accounts (net), or 4.4% of our home heating oil
customer base."

6. If I were interested in owning the stock, I would wait until after the next
earnings which will show a loss. I find that often the market does not fully
account for seasonality, giving the more informed investor a better deal.
Perhaps that's why the stock was under $3 a few months ago.

Just some thoughts....

The REIT tax benefit is of course a real valid benefit that I had failed to
consider; however, I don't see any real value creation other than that.
Conflicts galore, one customer - why is this REIT at all attractive?

Surely, considering the market cap of the post-split OpCo, it will be cut to a
size that actually draws less attention, than the combined company with
property assets is able to draw at a larger size? OpCo loses control of
property, which is actually the most important attribute to control in nursing
homes, which is only resolved through massive conflict of interest.

I don't change my assessment that it is an unattractive move, and I'll bet that
the REIT post-split will simply dilute existing shareholders at a depressed
price to fund future development...mark my words...

Just my opinion of course

You bring up some good points.

Re concentration, brings to my mind Agree realty (ADC)
From ADC’s last 10-K filing, it’s stated that approximately 31% of their annual
rent is derived from Borders, 23% from Walgreens and 12% from K-Mart. ADC
trades for much less than the current dividend would suggest. Not just
concentration, of course, but also who are the big lessees play a part in the
pps.

Also I was thinking of Mervyn's. I believe when the vultures got a hold of that
one that they spun off the realty, and then the new landlord raised the rents
killing the store. The two entities of health industry and REIT, once separate,
could play chicken with each other.

Another issue I did not mention before, and it may just be a prejudice on my
part, but I am leery of senior home care as an industry. So much regulation, so
much price pressure, and so much of the work force unionized.

Still worth watching when it does split. Might be an opportunity arise. I might
take some of the REIT at the right price.

Hello Spekulatius,

Yes, I believe that model was created before many of the current risks
presented themselves. It's still very useful as a starting point...

To me, there are a couple of potential outcomes here in the next year for ATPG:

1) Outcome 1 would be ATPG gets VERY lucky and is basically unaffected. It's
new Canyon Express well progress may be stopped , but the important project is
Telemark. If somehow Telemark wells can continue their progress because of:

A) The Titan is given an exemption to the recent stop-drill pronouncements
because it is technologically superior in safety to other rigs out there.

Or

B) Political pressure somehow ends the 6 month moratorium early (maybe due to
jobs?)

Or

C) Drilling has gone enough on all the wells and maybe the pronouncement
doesn't apply because only completion is necessary?

2) Outcome 2 would be that Telemark can't proceed for 6 months. ATPG would be
at a higher run rate of production than 2009 and could try to keep moving on
production of unaffected wells until the 6 month moratorium was over and
serious production increases could proceed. Personally, I think without another
major surprise, ATPG would be ok from a cash flow perspective here until the
ramp-up in 2011.

3) Outcome 3 would basically be that something else horrible happens to ATPG.
New insurance costs could turn out to be extremely high, or hurricane season
could force ATPG shut-ins or something worse, or the moratorium could be pushed
out beyond 6 months.

So, I'm guessing we're going to end up with outcome #2, which to me implies a
significant undervaluation of shares at current levels. An outcome of #1 or
somewhere between #1 and #2 would imply a bigger undervaluation. And a #3 would
be a big mess and ATPG would be to start back into creative financing mode, in
my opinion.

But, seemingly 1/2 of the companies I've invested in over the past 2 years have
some level of serious risk. Pays to stay diversified.

My question to others is are there oil companies out there that have been cut
in 1/2 like ATPG over the last month? And do these companies have seemingly
significant undervaluation in addition to less risk than ATPG? If so, I'd like
to explore investment in them...

Thanks,

Walter,

IMHO, Buffett's investments are much less interesting now than they were 10-15
years ago. Especially last year he has been more driven by getting cash for his
non-stock (preferred) and Burlington Northern investments than by buying stock
positions. One could argue that in such situation his buys, holds and sells are
even more meaningful, but I don't think so. I think he sells what he can easily
sell (COP, PG, JNJ) and sometimes things that are small positions that are not
very good/important (UNH, WLP, TRV, KMX, GCI, STI). IMHO, the only big sell
statement he made this quarter was KFT sale that he publicly said he won't do.
Maybe there is some deep thinking behind healthcare position sales although he
also bought BDX in this area. And I'd guess it does not go much further than
the possible negative impacts of healthcare reform.

On the buy side BDX has been discussed on this thread already. It is somewhat
attractive.

The other two buys - IRM and RSG - are not interesting/attractive to me.

BAC has been a small position for a long time now. Buffett has not increased or
decreased it through the crisis. I would not read much into its existence.

From Buffett stocks, I personally hold only a position in JNJ. I thought it was
somewhat attractively priced, but then the current scandal broke out. Not sure
I'd buy it here. :(

DSWL. My reason for passing was that I had some involvement with injection
molding shops in the US and Canada, and imo, they were very tough businesses
(customers switch for low price). With not a lot of barrier to entry if
somebody had some capital to buy/maintain a couple of injection mold machines.
DSWL at the time, if I remember correctly, was a very small company (like the
small proprietorship shops I was somewhat familiar with), and the stock was at
a reasonable p/e, maybe 7-8 --- That's about enough for for a company like
that, I believed. Also, the high roe at the time -- that I believed to be
impossible to sustain. Too much competition to allow that to continue. (At
least in my experience with North American shops.)

My opinion was that Mike & other posters had way too little real world
industrial experience to properly value dink injection molding shops. So
whereas some people believed the stock was cheap and a buy, my opinion was that
it was fairly valued or beyond fair. Oops. If I recall correctly, buyers here
at the time actually did okay or very well. So did the company -- growing to
over 3000 employees (according to Yahoo). For me, I continued to maintain my
opinion and to mumble (to myself -g-) that buyers were crazy: the stock was
plain overvalued.

Eventually, I did buy shares: Although years later when the price, in my view,
was cheaper. When in late '08, early '09 the stock traded as a Graham net-net
(2/3 nca, and not a losing year in past ten), I added. That purchase made all
the difference for me. I exited position late '09. Stock is still on my watch
list: if it gets down to $2.50/sh or so on no adverse news, I'll look to be a
Graham net-net buyer again.

it looks like this is going to be fairly expensive oil for PBR shareholders.
Let's say 6B barrel of crude in the ground 9or under the ocean). They pay 30B$
for that or 5$/barrel. This does not sound too bad but a 100B$$ exploration
cost adds another 16.7$/barrel. So total cost is almost 22$/barrel.

Many oil majors trade for a bit more than 10$/barrel of proved resources. I'll
pass on PBR. My guess is that most oil majors would have passed on this deal as
well but PBR does not really have a choice.

FWIW, the net value of the field is not 365B$-130B$ but much lower - you will
have to discount the future cash flows by an appropriate discount rate
typically 10% (NP10 value) and account for taxes.

There are a lot of players jockeying for this market: banks, Visa, MasterCard,
WU, cell operators, etc.

I don't think there will be a single global winner. IMHO, the market will
become more fragmented before it becomes more unified. E.g. in Eastern Europe
almost everything is done via bank transfer - I think they inherited this from
Western Europe. In US doing a bank transfer is huge pain in the ass and people
use checks. Almost no one uses checks in Eastern Europe, but almost all
payments of bills is done over bank transfer.

On the other hand, things are different in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In
some places already the payments by transferring mobile operator minutes is
common. In some places, banks, Visa, MC are preferred solutions.

The advantage of WU is that it has strong presence in US as originating
country. I.e. if I need to send money to Lithuania, I have only a choice of WU
or US banks who are pain in the neck to do balance transfers. (This has started
to change somewhat since they have smelt the opportunity of transfers to
Mexico. Still overall the experience is horrible compared to Euro standards
where you can do balance transfer almost anywhere with a push of a button.) I
cannot use Lithuanian-Swedish-Finnish banks, since they don't have presence in
US. I cannot use phone operators, since they don't have presence in US. Visa
and MC has not rolled out a service yet either. I think Paypal is starting to
push something, but they rely on a bank as an endpoint, which becomes a huge
hassle. You have 3 institutions: originating bank -> Paypal -> receiving bank.
And they have issues with payment cancellations.

Long term it is going to be a bloody area although WU can somewhat rely on
continuous apathy of US banks to provide an easy solution. The question is
whether Visa/MC/Amex will be apathetic as well. I don't think WU has advantage
or foothold when US is not an originating country.

I hold position in UEPS partially as a play in this area.

Jurgis, yes bank transfers are common in West Europe. I had never written a
check before I came to the US in my entire life - the overnight bank transfers
are much safer, faster and more convenient.

I know some folks who use Paypal to transfer money in foreign countries but
theer can be issues with the receiving bank. As far as the transfer of physical
cash is concerned quite a few institutions could do that - the mail offices
would be a natural way since pretty their are ubiquitous virtually everywhere.
Cellphone companies are similar, if the counterparty has a cellphone they are
going to have access to one of those stores, which also could handle the cash.
I know that some cellpone companies in China (?) are looking into that - as
this could become a nice side business.

FWIW I think that BofA provides a transfer service to Mexico but I am not sure
how well it works. i think that Visa , Mastercard and the like also are natural
players since they have already an ATM network in place. I really think there
is no technical hurdle, all it takes is the will to do it and overcome a bias
of some people who have always done it the WU way. but I think the new
generation who grew up with cellphones and the internet will scoff what is out

Telefonica To Raise Bid For PT's Half Of Brazil Joint Venture

LISBON (Dow Jones)--Spanish telecommunications giant Telefonica SA (TEF,
TEF.MC) is planning to raise its bid for Portugal Telecom SA's (PT, PTC.LB)
half of the two companies' Brazilian joint venture to between EUR5.9 billion
and EUR6.8 billion, a person close to the situation said Tuesday.

The person said Telefonica has been in talks with PT and key shareholders at
the company--including Portuguese banks Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES.LB) and
Caixa Geral de Depositos--about a price that would be agreeable to them.

"They asked us to raise the price," said the person, who declined to be named.

Telefonica had previously offered EUR5.7 billion for PT's half of Brasilcel, a
holding company that owns about 60% of Brazilian cell phone operator Vivo
Participacoes SA (VIV), an offer which PT promptly rejected.

The Brazilian venture is considered strategic by both Telefonica and PT, which
face stagnant revenues in mature European markets, positioning Brazil as their
main growth platform.

Brazil had a total of 179 million cellphone subscriptions in March - equivalent
to 93% of the population. That's 17% higher than the year before.

re NDAQ - I did sell only 1/3 of my position, the reason being that I saw
better opportunities and wanted to raise some cash. I am somewhat concerned
about fallout from the flash crash (lawsuits) but so far it seems that nothing
specific to NDAQ has cropped up.

I think the franchise is intact but revenues are shrinking (and so are costs).
I think the franchise values for exchanges are in a secular decline (there are

I believe PayPal moved its HQ to Luxembourg and registered to start providing

Bank transfers are certainly more common here in Europe: the UK will be phasing
out cheques entirely within a few years I understand. Bank to bank transfers
are the most common method; Western Union and other over-the-counter transfer
services for pickup are commonly used by immigrants to return money to their
country of origin, though are not used domestically.

So, not much growth inter-Europe now, but for Western Union-type businesses,

I noticed Paul's post below, wherein he noted he was adding to his position.

Looking through the fundamentals though, I have a couple of comments on it, and
the analysts' forecasts.

- Although the 2009 impairment does not appear to dump "other" costs into the
write-down in the 10K disclosure, the simple fact that the writedown is
required so shortly after the acquisition demonstrates the amount of money the
company has wasted on acquisitions in the past - what confidence do you have in
the management going into the future? I realise that the CEO is new, but the
rest of the team are not...
- What are the analysts basing their forecasts upon? Sales have fallen in the
past year, and given the dispersion of the brands, what "value" or "durable
advantage" do you see in which to invest? RoA is 2%, and not much higher on an
adjusted basis for tangible assets.
- Is there any value on the balance sheet? Seems highly-levered and full of
goodwill to me.
- $7bn of debt remaining, and $500m free cashflow generation per year on a
conservative basis, looking back the past 3 years.
- Margins are around 1% - pretty cut-throat operating environment to contend
with. I'm not convinced it is defensive, particularly with Tesco, Wal-Mart etc
dominating the market.

Re: NE

Interesting comments on the sector from way back when:

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=7694341

I am not at all familiar with the sector, but I don't really understand how
pricing with some of these drilling companies operates. My assumption, if they
are similar to shipping, is based on day rates or charters for a longer period.

Therefore, buying at this stage might be buying in a tight market with strong
(until now) demand for services that could be diluted by rig-building etc
(caveat - I have no idea of the orderbook).

That leaves me lost for a margin of safety in today's market. To be
comfortable, I would have to understand how opex on each contract is derived,
and what margin over break-even today's contracts are at, and where historical
rates have been.

Added to which, I don't know if I am even barking up the right tree...can
anyone explain it further to me?

Hi elmatador -
Thank's for the Brazil update and specifically Telefonica SA Common Stock
(NYSE: TEF). I was first aware of TEF in an article I posted October 2009
regarding the Olympics coming to Brazil in 2016.

I have been distracted by much of the other economic news and the GOM deep
drilling disaster that I have not really been thinking about the 2016 Olympics
(in Brazil).

I did read recently that the peak in oil prices in 2009 could have been due to
China buying up diesel reserves to power backup generators if it became
necessary to shut down their coal power plants because of too much localized
pollution during their Olympic venue. China did not want to be seen as a bad
host w/ excess pollution which impacted the world's athletes. At least it was
an argument that was made by some think tank that tried to explain the peak in
oil prices during 2009.

Therefore, if that is even partially true, the 2016 Olympics in Brazil is going
to be a big deal for many of the local companies. I think I am going to revisit
my list from that October 2009 post (
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26000039 ) and look at TEF as
possible new buys so I can set the table for my 2016 Olympic picks.

Hi Walter -

RE: SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU)

I have followed SVU for a long time as a value buyer and stock holder from the
Albertsons days. I have added shares over the years in this price area
($12-$13) and sold some shares around the $20 range. The reasons why I like the
company (1) they own the real estate for every store they operate, (2) SVU came
into the Albertson's deal with the best wholesale distribution operation
bringing efficiencies into the back end operation, (3) although margins are
very thin in this business, the company continues to generate good cash flow
post their acquisition and (4) at the current price the PE is in "value" buy
range as long as no land mines are hit.

When SVU did the Albertson's acquisition, they cherry picked the good store
locations leaving the other sites & the Osco Drug divisions to the other
partner. As a result they should have the best of the best stores from
Albertson's. The company recently announced some additional store closures and
sales with the proceeds used to pay down debt. I am not too sure these sales (I
think they closed last quarter) are reflected in the Yahoo financial summaries.

The new CEO comes from WalMart so he brings that culture to SVU which should be
good to help further utilize their logistic efficiencies and more importantly
better brand the individual SVU stores to each region and (upscale) market
opportunity. SVU was criticized for poor in store retailing. One of the first
actions by the new CEO was cutting their dividend to help conserve cash (I sold
a chunk of my shares around $17.00 on that announcement).

When I last noticed SVU's stock price in this range, I passed on adding shares
because of their continued large debt. The current environment is different and
those that have large debt service are more vulnerable now especially when the
next move in the interest rate cycle will be higher rates.

So, I am on the fence on this one. I also own Tesco and you can see that SVU
has underperformed (
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=TSCDY.PK&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=svu ) by as much
as 50% during the five year period representing operations post the Albertson's
acquisition. The value investor in me says this is the time to load up (maybe
even pair down my Tesco shares to buy more SVU). However, I am cautious buying
or adding to positions where the company has a large amount of debt. In fact,
my new rule is only buy companies where LT debt can be paid off by 3x or 4x
annual earnings. It take SVU 19 years of current annual earnings to pay off
their LT debt!

Like Paul discussed there are always exceptions to that rule (or any other hard
fast value rule). This may be one. The ace-in-the-hole are their real estate
assets. This is where all the value is tied up. SVU did name a new VP of Market
& Real Estate Development today so perhaps the CEO is looking at another round
of non-strategic store sales.

The company is leveraged much more than I like but it is with an operation that
generates a lot of cash. If the end play is for the CEO to sell more stores and
whittle down their LT debt, then SVU could see an expanding PE something more
in line of their peers (ie. 16.96 Industry; Walmart PE 13.57). It's not the
best time to be selling stores (and the associated real estate) so if they can
hang on for five more years and then peel off some of their real estate assets,
the stock could potentially trade back to it's previous highs in the $40.00's.

If the stock continues lower on lower volume, I may consider adding a few more
shares and on any sustained rally sell some of my higher priced shares. The
dividend yield (even after their cut) is ok at 2.6%. You ask some very good
questions which have no absolute answers. I do know that I saw the same value
in Sears & KMART before it was consolidated for their real estate assets. Eddie
Lampert loved to buy old companies that threw off a lot of cash. SVU has a lot
of the same attributes that both Kmart & Sears have. However KMART went
bankrupt.

You are barking on the right tree. The bull case is that the decline is
sufficient to cover the losses of business in GOM. The bear case is that
there's almost perfect storm:

- the losses of business in GOM due to moratorium
- decreased day-rates due to rig glut as they relocate from GOM
- newbuild order book adds to glut
- costs to refit rigs due to additional safety features that will probably be
enforced

All these are going to create a negative earnings comps for foreseeable future.

There is some uncertainty what will happen with PBR ultradeepwater drilling.
PBR is planning to do it using "local" Brazil rigs, but from what I understand
they still don't have them, so there may be some additional business if PBR
blinks. I don't think it will cover the GOM glut though.

I had bought some RIG/NE/DO/ATW before the blowup and after it. However, since
the moratorium announcement I am not going to add unless the stocks drop a lot
more. I may lighten depending on relative pricing to other equities. My

I find those miners interesting conceptually - some real characters involved to
get those mines up and running, sold on the exchange, and keep a drilling
programme in place to communicate with stockholders.

Nevertheless, I would not invest in them from a value perspective
- Too sensitive to Gold price changes (as not only does the value of the
reserve change, but the extent of the reserve that can be economically mined
changes too with the price, as it becomes more/less economical to mine
lower-grade areas)
- Too great a chance of missing highest reserves - it really is
needle-in-haystack mining
- Risk of dilution at each stage of funding the drilling programme prior to
production phase

have $300 million in canadian cash now so I would say that they can probably

Looking at Buffett's holdings, he holds USG in Berkshire Hathaway as well: I am

any redeeming feature that would attract a value investor - only redeeming
feature is the nil goodwill on balance sheet

- Heavily lossmaking
- Cashflow is poor
- Debt-laden ($2bn)
- Working capital is highly volatile

My only guess is that he invested based upon the asbestos claims being less
than feared, but has found the building products world more competitive and
with higher cost inputs than previously expected (gypsum supplies from mining
running low?)

http://www.gurufocus.com/financials.php?symbol=usg That's when I was looking at
them too and thankfully I did not buy. USG may have been the low cost producer,
which also appeals to Buffett. Buffett also seems to like the building related
businesses overall with his ownership of companies in carpets, paints,
furniture and manufactured housing, so USG fit that mold too. I guess he did
not foresee the 2008 housing collapse or had to weather through it, since he
does not sell a lot (and he never sells fully owned business).

IMHO they are optimistic, since they don't account for price pressures as the
E&Ps sees opportunity to lower their costs on the rig glut during moratorium.
They also don't account for the rig improvement costs to satisfy any new
regulations.

They mention one positive: theoretically drillers will get paid OKish rates for
90 days or remainder of contract under "force majeure". I think there will be
pushback from E&Ps to get those rates as low as possible and continue for as
short time as possible. The ultimate results of these negotiations are a bit

Hi Paul -

RE:Corning Incorporated Common Sto(NYSE: GLW)

FWIW, GLW still a top 20 position in the portfolio for me. I bought my lot in
2002 at an average cost of $5.50/share. I have been following their different
business lines and like the progress they have made with their glass diesel
filters (selling big in Europe starting 2009 & in U.S. in 2010). This
technology utilizes a catalyst within its design that eliminates most of the
diesel pollution (NO2 & particulates) emissions. The forward contribution to
net profits from this division is really 24 months out as they ramp up
production. The new U.S. 2010 EPA diesel emission limits will drive sales as
almost all commercial diesel vehicles will retrofit with the GLW technology.

Their fiber optic cable division is finally growing again with huge demand from
Asia and the U.S. (Verizon & AT&T now wiring fiber to the home). LCD glass has
seen it's peak unless there is a big demand in residential 3D TV (uses 4x the
amount of LCD glass than 2D).

The up and coming "new" technology for GLW is solar thin-film photovoltaic
technology (
http://www.corning.com/r_d/emerging_technologies/photovoltaics.aspx ). If they
are as successful as DuPont (DuPont solar sales to grow 50% this year - company
has set a new goal to exceed US$2bn in sales by 2014 :
http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/view/9064/dupont-solar-sales-to-grow-50-thi
-year/ ), GLW could easily grow their revenues at double digit rates. The
forward PE at 8 is really a value given the future prospects of their different
technologies in the pipeline.

I have peeled off shares in April 2010 in both the IRA and taxable account at
$20.50/share selling about 10% of my position. My long term expectations for
the stock is $29.00/share - $30.00/share and I plan on peeling off more shares
as we approach this number. This company is a good technology innovator for the
price.

If anybody needs to add a technology company selling at a real value price (8
PE) this is a good one to consider. They even pay a dividend (about 1.2%) while
you wait.

Well, to tell you the truth I did not expect moratorium. I expected tougher
regulations, so no not "business as normal after 2 weeks", but also not full
indeterminate suspension of deepwater drilling. Probably I should have expected
it, but I did not. Moratorium changes expectations in a major way, since now we
know that GOM work is gone for 6 months minimum and possibly longer.

I also expected the leak to be stopped faster, which was a bit naive. If the
leak was stopped faster, there would not have been a moratorium.

Finally, even though I may seem like a driller-bull, I have always been a bit
uncomfortable with the fact that they are in commodity (even the deep-water
drilling is becoming overcrowded/commoditized) service industry that is
probably not really growing while facing buildout glut. I'd rather be in E&Ps
which have physical assets in the ground that are getting more rare. Drillers
did seem to be cheap and I think they were, but now we are getting into a
pretty bad political+oversupply storm. The real question is not what I missed
by not selling 30% higher (actually I don't think I lost that much money, since
my positions were minor and I did some trading that might have helped), but
whether the current prices are attractive enough to discount the issues we know
of.

but selling and asking questions later is often not a bad strategy if something
unexpected happens.

Not really. I never sell if it's clear what the unexpected entails and if I
believe it is temporary or not important to long term business. Kneejerk
selling is usually bad strategy even though you, Dale (through stops, I think)
and Mike Burry (through stops) advocate it. Yes, I will suffer worse
(temporary?) losses than kneejerk sellers when the issue is worse than
originally thought. I win when the issue is not as bad as assumed and kneejerk
sellers never have a chance to rebuy at the original drop price.

Re: Tortoise Power and Energy Infra (TPZ)

This fund is holding up really well. We are retesting the S&P500 low of May 21,

$21.17/share almost 7% higher from it's May 21, 2010 low.

I wanted to park some money in this fund as it yields over 7% and pays the

position? Are there particular sectors that your sells are from or is just a
bit of sell from everything? I have built up my cash reserves from three
positions (all infrastructure plays) I have closed out and made a few new buys
this week. I plan to deploy the balance of these proceeds next week on any
further market sell off.

All of your buys look very tempting but I think I am going for one big buy
where the risk/value reward is very positive IMO.

The one problem I face is as the market moves down, I see many more bargains
and need to sell other positions to free up cash. I do need to keep in mind
that I want to increase my portfolio turnover but hate to give away one value
position just to buy another. From my previous post, my portfolio PE is now
around 9 well within the value range. Perhaps I should sell anything with a PE
greater than the S&P average 15?

That's the reason for my questions on what your sells are. Do you have some
strategy (ie lighten up on cyclical stocks, move to defensive issues, buy
excellent value opportunities)?

Many of the drug stocks are getting very cheap. I am inclined to move new funds
to defensive stocks and/or those that pay a dividend.

Spekulatius. BK. Am losing some courage here regarding some stock posts -- a
low pride/shame ratio (in my mind) on some making me reluctant to post.
Possibly an indication I can't make a convincing case even to myself that such
a stock is a value buy. BK is one. I'm in @$26.90 though as of June 1st for a
most small tracking position. That price is a bit less than the $27/sh the
$700M stock issuance went at.

There aren't that many security services firms - STT, NTRS, BK -- And these
large companies get benefits of size as they make acquisitions (a consolidating
sector - companies get big or get out.) The attractions for me are that
barriers seem high for new entrants into the securities servicing arena, and
the business seems like it's not going to be obsoleted. Not sure here, but it
appears to me, BK et. al. just take a small slice from their customer firms'
assets they service. The customer firms' customers (individual
stockholder/pensioners, etc.) never even are aware of this haircut. Perhaps a
kind of toll business that would appeal to a Warren Buffett.

Not that BK's record is stellar. ROE is punk, stated book value hasn't done
much in past four years, and BK dividend is small. Plus, BK has an asset
management business; and of course, on days or times like now, where people
want out of stocks, equity asset management firms - BK and others - are for
sure sold down too.

It just seems to me that BK has viable (growing) business prospects over time
-- or at least not decreasing prospects, and as the company does okay, the
stock will improve from current relatively-low levels.

re BK - I think you stated it fairly well. I think BK is a high quality and fee
based trust bank. I like it better than STT which has (or had) some iffy stuff
on their balance sheet. I decided to reduce my stake in NDAQ and increase my
stake in BK because I think the latter has better prospects. NDAQ business is
more commoditized and there are more and more exchanges open ing up (seemingly
low barriers of entry). NDAQ does not pay a dividend either while BK dividend
will increase substantially (imo) from a low base (dividend reduction due to
TARP).
Like E_K_S I am at a point where I need to make choices and in order to buy
something I need to sell. 5% cash is as close to fully invested as I have ever
been, typically cash levels run between 10-20%.

FWIW ROE is punk because of goodwill; BK is really a merger of equals (Bank of
New York and Mellon) so I don't think it's necessarily a meaningful number to
look at.

EKS. I upped my bond fund exposure last year substantially, and have reinvested
their distributions back into the funds. Recently I've made sales in order to
have money available for days like today.

I sold about 40% of my largest and overweight portfolio position, LSBRX May 28.
Closed out my large position in MWTRX then too. The yields here just aren't
appealing to me anymore.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=LSBRX,MWTRX&d=s

My much smaller but second largest source of funds: I've given up on Jim
Rogers. At least for the time being. His "buy commodities (agriculture)" mantra
of 12 months ago didn't work for me. (That is, my buy and hold 12-month
positions in his sponsored commodity etns). I closed my position in RJA with
two sales (5/27 & 6/2) for losses. On 5/27 I sold 1/3 of a decent-size position
in DBA and closed out a smaller position in GRU. Both at losses. I had read and
expected and hoped that these things would not be correlated to equity stocks.
For commodity play, sort of, I prefer VTRAFF now. (However, I'm still wary of
stem rust fungus Ug99. If it ever gets a real hold, it could be a monster.
Wheat will become much more scare, therefore expensive -- RJA will rise; wheat
crops will decline and so will exports, so perhaps not good for VTRAFF
business.)

Other sales:

NWPX. Closed position in late May for a small loss. Too much accounting and/or
exchange listing problems. (And Spekulatius warned me (more than once):
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26392043&srchtxt=nwpx

VR. Closed my small position for a small loss. There's a Dutch auction going on
where the company will buy shares for at least $24/sh. Stock now at $24.50. I
suspect offer will be oversubscribed, and the company will acquire stock very
close to $24.00. At that price, if it happens, the stock will drop to $24 or
maybe below. I might consider reacquiring shares at that point.

ALK. Sold a small portion of my small Alaska Airline position yesterday at
@$49.39 (http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=ALK+Basic+Chart)

PAY. Trimmed a little when it popped 5/27.

That's basically been my source of cash for recent equity purchases.

re RGA looks pretty attractive. Looks like it's trading at 0.78x tangible book

Hello Madharry,

I'm looking to do relatively the same: Increase my oil exposure outside of
deepwater. I picked up some SGY this week and am looking at WTI - both seem to
have decent earnings, and good forward p/e ratios as well as cash flow.

Between ATPG, SGY, and IOC, I've already gotten to about 14% of my portfolio in
total in these 3 energy plays. I've just got to believe in 12-18 months that
Oil and NG prices are going to be higher with asian growth and drilling
moratoriums. I'm thinking that the recent oil company collapse in stock price
is a long-term gift, but we will see.

Thanks,

Hi Paul

RE: Source of Funds - equity value buy & hold allocation

That's a good overview and I probably need to be more diligent to peel off more
long term holds as positions test recovery highs. Some of my largest sells in
the past six months were also in the commodity natural resource sector too with
BHP, CVX & BP. I sold 15% of my BHP holding at the beginning of the year near
the all time high. As a result of the proposed Australian tax and market
correction the stock is now down 24%.

Unfortunately I started a new position in CNX (CONSOL ENERGY INC) which is down
20% from my average cost and pays a much lower dividend than BHP. Their
exposure to coal and NG is a better fit as a core holding for my portfolio and
the company is not impacted on any special country tax (either Australia or
Canada).

My other big sales in the last six months was a re-balancing of my integrated
oils. I sold 17% of my CVX which is down 8% and reinvested the proceeds into
COP (70%) down 1% and XOM (30%) down 16%. I also closed out my small BP
position which is now off 26% from my recent sale.

I would like to further pair down my integrated oil exposure and put the
proceeds into more domestic NG and E&P companies. Many of these pay a slightly
higher dividend than the integrated oil companies, have limited exposure to
offshore drilling activity and could benefit from any new U.S. legislation that
promotes domestic NG consumption.

I continue to hold a large percentage of the portfolio assets (about 25%) in
several bond like holdings (GNMA, Credit Union, Treasury Direct, Preferred
REITs, MLP & preferred stock mutual funds). I am tempted to stay put with these
positions as the blended yield is around 5%. I do have LT gains in every one of
these positions, so these assets could be used as a source of funds if I see an
opportunity in a low risk value buy. The risk/reward trade for me must be 20%
or more annualized, and a dividend yield of at least 2%-5%.

As the market sells down, many potential value buys begin to meet this
criteria. Several of the drug companies come to mind.

I also pay particular attention to all the holdings that pay little or no
dividend. These are top candidates for sale and have to have a very compelling
value argument for me to continue to hold. 15% of the portfolio may be made up
of these positions where each holding represents less than .5% of the
portfolio. Many of these positions are special situation, theme stocks and/or
Global BRICK investments. These are also the stocks that if left to run become
the multi baggers in the future. This is where much of the due diligence and
pruning is done.

The key change for my equity Buy & Hold allocation is to work on the overall
portfolio turnover rate. I need to get it down (from 60 months avg) to 36
months for everything but my core holdings. This will allow me to add many more
value buys to the portfolio, while weeding out the non-performers.

re shallow GOM players. the shallow GOM is over-explored and what is left are
mostly small NG fields. it's tough to make a dime here. SGY for example has a
long history to destroy shareholder value and at least on a first look, the
stock does not look that cheap with an 2.5$ valuation/ MCFE. I bet is you can
find onshore plays with a lower valuation than that.

The EV/EBITDA ratio is low for GOM players because these gas reservoirs decline
quickly 2-3 years and they are gone. Don't be fooled by that number. because of
the short life, they need to drill and find new reservoirs constantly, and if
they get a streak of dry wells they are in deep trouble.

This may be a good bounce play but I bet it's going to be a bad LT investment.

Hi rllee

Here are the stocks mentioned in the article you posted:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SUSS,GAP,PTRY,SVU,WINN&d=s

I am not too sure if I agree with the author's conclusion that the lowest
Price/Sales presents the greatest value to investors.

Only SVU and WINN have booked a profit in the most recent quarters. The other
companies continue to book losses even with their high sales per share. I would
think that you would want to operate a profitable business especially if you
generate very high sales per share.

The high sales per share is "generally" reflective of the type of business (ie
min-mart). These are primarily convenience stores that sell pop, cigarettes,
candy, gasoline and other fast food products. Margins are much higher on these
items and much more profitable. I am a bit shocked that with a large percentage
of these high margin products that SUSS or PTRY can not even turn a profit. I
was surprised to even see SVU on this list.

Both SVU and GAP have a large amount of debt. It appears that SVU is managing
their debt better than GAP.

WINN has the least debt of the three grocery chains SVU, GAP & WINN in your
Price/Sales screen. I would of thought that their 24 PE would be lower so it
appears that the market has already priced in a premium for their low use of
debt.

The positive take away from your list is that SUSS & PTRY are small caps stocks
(w/ few outstanding shares) and any positive incremental change in their
business should result in a much greater positive earnings surprise.

==================================================================

You might want to look at these lower PEs grocery/convenience retail companies.
I believe they represent better value buys.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WAG,CBRL,SVU,WMT&d=s

I like the defensive nature of the "pure" grocery chain. Everybody has to eat
(or get their drugs even in a recession). This excludes restaurants and
mini-mart categories. You can make an argument to also include the exclusive
drug retailers too.

I normally do not shop at Walmart except to pick up prescription medicine from
time to time. However, I was at Walmart yesterday returning an item (HD had it
at a better price) and noticed that 8 out of 10 people in the "returns" line
was there to cash a check. The lady at the counter told me that they do a lot
of check cashing and money order/bill paying services for customers.

National Bank of Wal-Mart?
http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/banking/betterbanking/p109171.asp
Wal-Mart already offers money-transfer and check-cashing services. The next
step is full-on banking. The financial services industry is terrified, but
consumers might benefit.

Walmart recently introduced the means to wire funds to Mexico using their store
to store money transfer service. I suspect this is going to become a very
profitable new business for the National Bank of Walmart.

Thanks for the input on SGY. I will admit to not being a veteran in oil plays
and potentially being drawn in by cash flow, p/e, and a short steep drop from
20 to 12 over other standard industry-related valuations.

I'd be open to other ideas you have for other oil plays with better valuations.
I'm trying to spread to build some diversity in my positions and I'm trying to
have an open mind.

Good oil plays: TOT, E (Dividend yield, little GOM deepwater exposure).
Driller: NE (valuation, balance sheet, safety record)

I also think that NOV start to look attractive here. They build equipment for

this is all over.

re EME - i like the business (asset light, seemingly scalable) but the stock is

growth for 2011 but my concern is, if this growth is late to materialize, the
stock could fall quite a bit more.

I am also concerned that analyst estimate for earnings are near the top of the
huge range 1.45-1.85$ that management has given this year. I think an entry
below 20$ makes sense.

Thanks for the ideas. I picked up a decent-sized position in FEZ recently so I
kind-of own TOT and E already. :) I like the ideas as you'd think that of all
European companies, the oil and gas companies would be least affected by a
demand drop in Europe (if it was just in Europe).

Valuations look pretty good too though. I may pick up a larger position in E.

I will think about NOV and NE, though I think the long-term play is better in
producers rather than drillers, but I do see your reasoning. As I'm
diversifying my investments, I may go that direction also.

re ALO.PA - the May 2010 shareholder letter is out:
It gives a nice overview of the company and it's current condition, imo:

Current issue:

Link to older shareholder letters:
http://www.alstom.com/home/investors/publications/shareholder_letter/43347.EN.p
p?languageId=EN&dir=/home/investors/publications/shareholder_letter/

They are sort of prediction shrinking earnings since they are giving a 7-8%
target for the operating margin (currently 9%) and revenues will shrink due to
reduced order backlog - but I think they are conservative at least with respect
to the margin. They were conservative in the past and the lower Euro should
help with the margin and with new contract wins in countries that are tried to
the US$.
