Thanks for allowing me into your brain of knowledge.

What do you own right now?

I have MCO @ $21.58
JNJ @ 58 (thank god I jumped the gun and bought it)
HWG @ 20.6

I've been trying out this growth type of investing for a while however i'm just
more comfortable with NCAV.

Thanks for the helpful messages. What do you look at for a company
qualitatively?

When does a company have a wide enough "DCA"?

What do you think of IRM? It seems like a monopoly in its market but its a
rather small market. I've borrowed Value Line to read from the library and it
forecasts that IRM is in a growing market. How far do you think it can go? At
present valuations, I wouldn't consider it a buy but considering its in a
monopoly, or near-monopoly, does it make sense to buy it at a more expensive
price knowing this fact? I can't find a IRM thread on SI. );

Absolutely - I look at 5 year historic earnings yield / PE, and if you have a
company with stable earnings that has been rated downwards for no other reason
that lack of analyst coverage / cyclical industry re-rating, and it is
attractively valued still, then I am interested.

I am not trying to time a cycle and speculate, but rather to try to find
something that is solid but out of favour and priced for value.

Although I don't like mechanical formula investing without additional manual
filtering, his formula is close to what I use. He also raises some great
questions of how one would decide which of the stocks in list to buy if someone
wanted to buy only some stocks in the list. I agree with him that qualitative
decisions are tough. I own some stocks in his list (FRX, UEPS) and I am pretty
sure they underperformed a lot of other stocks in the list.

will work out in this space long term. It's possible that the brand/niche will
recover from the lousy decisions they made in rating crap at AAA+.

JNJ - I own some. It's not very cheap, but it's probably one of the cheaper
mega brands with huge moats. Hope they don't destroy it all with the Tylenol
production fiasco.

HWG - why would I buy a stock in company that was losing money 2-3 years ago?
Do you know something that makes it a permanent turnaround?

Armi,

I think it is probably hard not to at least look at historical PE along with
earnings growth, Revenue growth, ROE, historical Debt/Assets.

The foundation of security analysis by Graham and Dodd even looked at
historical levels to try and figure out what the idea of fair value is.

The competitive nature of security markets now makes it very difficult to apply
a single formula to find a list.

The real value now is probably in the more complicated securities, but this
opportunity seems to be a rarity now as there is alt. hedge funds looking for
these opportunities specifically.

So what to do... possibly look at historically what has seemed to work would be
an ok place to start i would figure (the trouble for most people is when they
hold a security for its value and then starts to perform it looks like it is
becoming expense but when in fact the company is beginning to execute).

We do not control the market, and no telling what is the actual deciding factor
in what leads to a security being undervalued then valued then overvalued... We
obviously have all our own ideas. I have my ideas and constantly aching back
revolving risk appetite portfolio mess that i have, but to me at the moment
there is the big money at the bottom, and big money at that leaves at top. The
others run the securities in between from here to there.

I suck at explaining things, but here i go.....

Example: CMI 1999-2004 Increased 300% from 2004-2007

Cummings stock performed horrifically between this time period as alot of
stocks did though many started to outperform by early 2002-2003. I look through
probably several hundred stocks a day and there entire chart from beg to end. I
came across CMI and notice a huge expansion after 2004... why, would would this
stock be relatively dreadful for years and then start executing and become in
favor....

Snapshot of the goods that i look at before delving into more: 2004-1999

Sales 8,438,000 6,296,000 5,853,000 5,681,000 6,597,000 6,639,000

Yield 0.02 0.04

PE 47.16981132 14.07129456 6.776379477

You notice the high book value for share before the PE and stock price
expansion.

Then looking at the financials more closely you notice they have extremely high
operating cash flow and other things that are positive.

When you delve into it further looking at quarterly statements you really
notice the turn in execution even before the market does, you notice even
before year end Q4 the % change in EPS is increasing exponentially quarter over
quarter and even ttm.

The 47 PE sounds high looking at it from a year end perspective, but finding
the trailing twelve months it was only trading between 7-13 times.

Ok great, what does this matter.... well case in point i mentioned CYD on this
thread September 29, trading at current 10-12 times TTM, high book value per
share, beggining to start executing..... EPS increasing exponentially in last
few quarters, high +20% ROE

I thought the set up was the same and even had very similar company and
industry (its not always going to be like this but there is thousands of
comparables out there). The numbers are freakishly similar in a lot of ways,
not to mention you could compare the high book value and high cost of entry in
the industrial motor industry.

CYD is up 39% since then.

I have taken alot 3/4ths off the table FWIW, but i am looking to add during a
decent pullback or if i see some stalling action.

Not that it is ever the same, but this is just an example... History is a funny
thing. Sorry for the essay.

Re: Cummins Inc. (CMI)

What did you conclude on your analysis for CMI? This one made it back on my
watch list last week. I had followed it since the crash in 2007 along with CAT.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?s=CMI,CAT&d=v8

CMI is up over 120% YTD so it's already has had a good run. I like the
possibility that CMI would benefit from diesel to NG engine conversions which
could be mandated if new Federal legislation is passed.

Didn't know of any other companies that manufacture big truck engines that run

CMI.

It is good they made the engine run on NG. What I cannot understand is, where
the truck driver will be able to load fuel. The gas stations are not equipped
yet. Do we know what would be the ROE? (how attractive would it be for a truck
driver to convert to the new technology)
IMO it will take at least 3-4 years for a network of NG stations to be built. I
figure it should be done while the truck drivers are sleeping at the parking
lots, because it takes a long time to load a fair amount of NG unless they have
invented something really new that I don't know of. The safety regulation will
take a long time too. This is a lot more explosive than diesel.
Other than that CMI is on the "Best New highs" list of Vector Vest :)

Re: CMI

Do you think there is about to be a big refresh cycle especially as china maybe

No not really any bigger than it is currently. However with QE2 there could be
unexpected consequences from the policy.

The forward PE for CMI at 14 seems historically high. During a peak cycle it
usually is below 10. Their forward PE could be signaling a pending stock price
increase but I just don't see it.

I was interested in the emerging demand from diesel to NG conversion and was
willing to invest a few dollar in this theme if I could buy at a "Value" price.
CMI's annual net income to their lt debt coverage at around 1 is very good
(much better than the auto companies). Based on the analysts next year
estimates and a PE of 9, I would buy CMI at $60.00/share. That's close to a 35%
discount from the current market price.

Therefore, for now I am just watching.

It looks pretty attractive. One has to remember that a lot of their current

However, the company is profitable, so it might be a mix of NCAV and earnings
investment. Mixes are risky, but perhaps. :)

Two risks:
- Military orders/contracts that can disappear if Uncle Sam comes home again.
- The big lawsuit from their BK sub that claims unpaid $3.2 investment and

Hi Paul -

RE: TPZ

Be very careful on buying this especially on low trading volume. My order
executed at $23.02/share (a discount to NAV of 7.8%), the specialist
immediately took the bid down to $22.80, traded some shares at $22.89 then
raised the price back to $23.25 bid x $23.35 ask.

If you are patient you can save $0.25/share or almost 1% of the NAV if you stay
on the Bid price (based also on a fair discount amount to NAV %). When people
want out of the fund, they just send through a market order and the executed
price usually falls like a rock.

I was trying all day Thursday & Friday last week to get $23.27/share and never
gave me any stock. I was surprised I could get shares under $23.00/share. The
stock just went ex dividend so the monthly dividend amount ($0.125/share) is
not even priced in the stock.

My TPZ buy was motivated by (1) very low return at my Credit Union (now paying
1% annual!) and (2) many of the NG wells that will be coming online in several
of the U.S. shale regions. As a result, many of the NG gathering MLPs in the
fund should see higher activity in the months and years ahead. More volume of
NG moved. more income for the MLPs.

Thank you for providing me the link to the Shale Natural Gas, Oil and NGLs and
ESA forum. jrhana the board monitor is very diligent about making very relevant
posts ( http://siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=57548 ). It's very
interesting to read and learn about all the different companies drilling and
building out the infrastructure in the region(s). I can understand now why the
big integrated oil companies are eager to get money invested.

It's not a bubble yet, but I could see one developing w/ all the new money
splashing around and as many of these smaller E&P companies get bid up in
price. The ride up can be fun but the fall could be devastating as Encana Oil &
Gas discovered recently by abruptly closing down marginal wells recently
drilled.

Book value and distributors: I've found that p/bv works for me with
distributors. Had a few that didn't work out, but on balance, price to low
stated bv ---or better, price to low tangible bv, has worked out for me. I
don't see any reason to change by adding complexity. That is, I'd have to
calculate fcf and then have something to compare fcf/sh to -- either
competitors or the sector or the company's historical fcf (which I'd find
painstaking to determine, and not worth the effort). Jmo, of course. Other
people have their ways.

If the economy turns down and that affects distributors, sales decline, and the
stock price declines. Sometimes, many times, the book value of the distributor
consists predominantly of inventory. Sometimes that inventory gets obsolete if
not sold in a reasonable time frame. This hasn't been so terrifying a problem
as I have assumed. I mention all this because the standard knock on b.v. is
that it's some accounting number that may or may not be related to the on-going
assets of the business or those assets if they were to be liquidated. I suggest
that looking at book value of distributors when the price of the distributor's
stock is beat down, is a good way to pick such stocks. Not always, but enough
times for me to see results and to continue to want to buy like this.

============================================
In general, it SEEMS like the most logical way to value a company is on its
future stream of earnings -- its DCF. I've not found DCF though to be necessary
or significant for me to evaluate stocks. Sure, if somebody says they buy a
stock on its DCF numbers and shows me those numbers and assumptions behind
them, I'll look. If the stock though doesn't meet what I'm looking for in terms
of p/bk, p/e, or roe, etc. I'll likely not be a buyer.

Do I recall correctly that Charlie Munger once said he never saw Mr. Buffett do
a DCF analysis? If so, maybe somebody did it for him or he did them in his
head. Perhaps too, Mr. Buffett's picks seemed so obvious to Mr. Buffet as buys
or as passes, that he felt it was unnecessary.

re ML.PA (Michelin). I have been looking for a while for stocks with "hidden"
emerging market exposure. Some folks actually state that GM's emerging market
subsidies may be worth more than the current GM market cap. That got me looking
into adjacent business and one of them is tires. GT looks overleveraged and has
a huge underfunded pension liability (the underfunding is higher than it's
current market cap). it is somewhat cheap if you regard it as an "option" like
play.

But I like ML.PA better. It has the better balance sheet, and almost twice the
operating margin of GT (~9% versus GT ~5%). 33% of their business are in
emerging markets and they recently did a right offering to get some more
capital - as they state for organic growth in emerging markets. The rights
offering is about ~1.6B$ and they want to invest 1.5B$ in the next few years in
China plys they have investments in India and other countries. Tires is a
capital intense business and is has a very cyclical nature (due sales to the
car industry) but the growth story may be under appreciated here. Lot's of
information in Michelin's shareholder website:

Current PE is around 10 with a pretty large spread in estimates.

You mentioned one of the negatives in the tire business. Increased capital
expenditures appears to be the main reason Michelin had negative cash flow for
the first half of the year.

Another negative is the increased; commodity costs, though Michelin was able to
increase prices.

Although they're focusing on emerging markets for continued growth, they won't
be alone. The following quote is from Tire Review, a industry source for news
and commentary.

"For their part Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote that Michelin is now position
to “turn round its poor history of growth,” adding: “Michelin’s capital
expenditure averaged 7.3% of sales in 2000-10 versus a revenue compound annual
growth rate of just 1.1% over the same period, in nominal terms.”

The bank’s view is that too much money was spent on fuelling “marginal
productivity increases of old European and North American plants” which
reportedly average 90% of capital expenditure averaged over the 2004-2009
period.

With competitors Continental and Pirelli signaling that they are targeting
significant investments in emerging markets over the next 5 years (Pirelli is
aiming at a 20% capacity increase by 2012, doubling China car tire capacity as
it goes and Continental has announced it has made 500 million euros available
for this purpose) Michelin’s management is making it increasingly clear the
emerging markets are the key focus from now on.

In addition to the competing European tire majors, Bridgestone has expansion
plans in six countries, Hankook is focusing on China and Indonesia, Cheng Shin
Rubber is heavily investing in China. Referring to these plans, market watchers
don’t expect increased output to flood the Asian manufacturers’ domestic
markets. (Tyres & Accessories)"

It should also be noted that the Chinese have increased their production.

http://marketpublishers.com/lists/8584/news.html

The growth story might be not appreciated, but certainly there is a great deal
of production ramping up to fill the need.

Thanks for the Tire review source - it's a good source for news about this
sector:

http://www.tirereview.com/Article/81038/michelin_2010_sales_jump_nearly_20.aspx

From a business perspective, I like Pirelli most. they have held their market
share while most other competitors lost share over the last few years (most
likely to newcomers from emerging markets). GT had the heaviest market share
losses and Pirelli and Continental were doing the best. While I like Pirelli
and have some fond memories when I owned it in Y2000 (investment thesis was the
hidden value of he Fiber optic division, later sold to Cisco) they continued to
divert funds into a holding company and a Real estate venture which cost them
dearly. Pirelli stock has recovered and is unfortunately not cheap. Conti is
well managed butis not cheap either, and the stock has had quite a run. So
ML.PA, despite it warts seems to be the stock du jour as the french say...

RE BMR

I have not looked deeply into REITs recently. I have been working a regular job
for most of the past several years and have not had time to keep up with the
market so much until now.

A quick look at BMR raises a few concerns. It was founded in 2004 so they
probably bought the properties near the top of the market 2004-06. Check to see
if the value is based on purchase price or current value.

Several execs are making over $1M a year. Seems excessive to me.

Lots of debt without much cash. Not unusual for a REIT but if there is a
downturn in Biotech it could be fatal. Lots of asset concentration, little
diversification.

Can't tell the Funds From Operations (FFO) without looking at the income
statements.

won't buy. If you have other thoughts please share.

I'll bite on the technical analysis comment here on the value thread. :)

I think as long as it's still holding support at ~20.5, I still feel pretty
good technically, but I'm really buying this stock for several reasons:

1) I think Oil prices are heading up in 2011 and 2012 as demand starts catching
up to total supply. Now that Oil is back down around $80, I wanted to start
buying back into some positions. NXY has 85% oil production from my research.

2) NXY seems to be relatively fairly priced in relation to reserves, maybe even
a bit cheap.

3) I like the fact that the company is large enough to warrant a potential
acquisition from China or India as these countries look to secure supply.

4) I like that it hasn't rallied too much from its lows of the year and hasn't
rallied much at all on the recent run of oil to the upper 80's. Still maybe at
a value price.

I'm not much of a fan of their downstream stuff -- refining and retail sales.
And at current price, the stock won't fit into a value box in the way I view

Hi Grommit -

There is a bit of option activity yesterday and today for SVU trading at the
April 2011 expiration. Over 1000 contracts yesterday for the April 11 calls and
today a 1000 contracts for the April $9.00 Puts.

The activity is actually small especially if there was some sort of pending bad
news so I suspect sellers are frustrated owners finding better value in other
stocks.

With SVU trading at current levels, it becomes doable for a private equity
buyer to pick the company up using cheap financing. I doubt this would occur
but w/ QE2 money sloshing around, there is tons of money sitting on the
sidelines.

What is interesting is that David Boehnen was pushed out of the company last
week. (
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/SUPERVALU-Announces-New-Role-bw-668426202.html?x=
&.v=1 ). Boehnen has been responsible for legal, business development, real
estate and store development, as well as government affairs. He has served as
an important advisor to the CEO and the board of directors on a number of
significant issues and opportunities that have influenced the company’s growth.

Todd Sheldon, group vice president, legal, will be promoted to senior vice
president and general counsel (Boehen's previous position), reporting to Andy
Herring, executive vice president of real estate, market development and legal.
I can only guess that SVU may be looking at doing another "major" real estate
downsizing. This could be in conjunction with a private equity deal and/or just
what is required to reduce their long term debt.

In either case, there is still a lot of intrinsic value in SVU but I fear
shareholders may only see a part of this if a large private equity firm
snatches up the company. There is chatter on the message boards that a buy out
price could be in the $12.00/share area.

With todays purchase, my average cost is around this level ($12.45/share). I
value the stock at $17.00-$20.00 a share but only if they reduce their debt by
selling more of their real estate holdings. I will wait and see what Todd
Sheldon proposes to his boss and the SVU board.

Hi Arthur -

Re: Stein Mart Inc. (SMRT)

Interesting find. There has been some insider buying in June and July by Jay
Stein. I also see that their dividend payment is not consistent and in 2009 was
discontinued. I am not sure if they now plan on paying a quarterly dividend
soon but their announced special dividend ($0.50/share in December) is a
positive.

I do like that they have little or no long term debt. Company sells for 1.7x
book and has a very respectable price/sales ratio of .36.

The stock is selling above its 200d MA and 50d MA so buyers seem to be
anticipating a good quarter already. I am not so sure the stock can be
classified as a deep discounted value buy.

I am no expert on retail companies and someone else can provide their opinion
from that perspective. For me, it's worth watching and maybe a swing trade if
the price is right.

FSR is I believe Spekulatius suggestion. Looks pretty cheap, so I bought an

CELM reported pretty mediocre earnings after I bought the stock, so I'll
probably won't buy more.

TOT is a one of pick-your-supermajor-cheap-oil-co. Nothing more to say.

In terms of portfolio additions, FRFHF and GLW are usual additions on dropping

TXIC is somewhat a gamble - the company still has not filled 2009 10K and
replaced CEO/CFO/etc. On the other hand, stock tanked on news to pretty much

I've enjoyed reviewing the GEOI vs. TOT discussion from a few months ago. At
the time, I was at a 5% position in GEOI and a 2% position in TOT as I felt
GEOI had a better risk/reward than TOT. But, since the time of the discussion,
it looks like GEOI is up around 40% while TOT is up around 10%. So, after some
re-research during the last week, I sold my GEOI, upped my 2% TOT position to
5% and established a 5% E position also.

My overall view is that TOT and E are both looking at low current and estimated
p/e ratios as well as low value to proven reserves especially when factoring in
their various other hard assets as you mention in the post I'm replying to.

GEOI may have a good future, but I think at current valuations of both of the
factors above, other companies look better right now. I realize I'm preaching

re SVU - I think the problem with SVU is the high debt load in conjunction with
a shrinking business. If the business continues to shrink the value of the
equity slice (~ 1.86B$ at this point) will continue to shrink at a rapid clip.

You can see how this ends with various radio, TV station stocks or Newspapers.
These all are shrinking business that have a debt load that they cannot support
any more in many cases. Based on the recent evidence and the apparent market
