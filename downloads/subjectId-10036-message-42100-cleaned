KHDHF has been identified in a recent article as an undervalued stock trading
at less than book value. I wonder if it,too, might also be worth holding on.

KHD Humboldt Wedag (KHDHF.PK)

KHD originally came to my attention as a pure value play in Joel Greenblatt's
magic formula screen. What really caught my attention was that it had $13 in
cash but was only trading in the market for $11.85. This cash amount was had a
disputed value given that it was cash collected on revenues for services that
were being performed or had not been completed yet but in my eyes cash was
cash. The company may not get to keep all of it in the event of contract
cancellations but they were definitely in a far more favorable position than
most others.

On top of this, the company had high exposure to emerging markets which I felt
would resume their growth once the recession was over. It turned out KHD turned
itself into a special situation. The management stated they did not feel their
value was adequately reflected in the market price and that they were going to
split the company into two companies to unlock that value. The company was then
split into Terra Nova Royalty Company (TTT) and KHD Humboldt Wedag via a stock
dividend over the course of the next few months.

Investors had a plethora of opportunities to buy below the $11.85 states above
AND had an opportunity to take part in a rights offering to get even more
shares at a further discounted price! Ultimately, the share shares purchased in
November 2009 for $11.85 are worth about $17.67 (considering the share prices
of both companies) AND it looks as if there may still be more to run as KHD has
plenty of room to run in its valuation. Investors who took part in the rights
offering or added to their shares as the market price dropped were rewarded
even more handsomly. Any readers on SeekingAlpha could have followed this
entire process through the well written articles by George Fisher who attempted
to determine what KHD was actually worth after the split as the process was
happening.

I also feel very comfortable to have a position in this Value stock. And a 6%
dividend that might increase given the lower number of shares. What I don't
understand is why they would use line of credit loan to repurchase shares???
This will incur future interest.

6365.T DMW Corporation. Japanese microcap. Almost a net net (counting in

I also found a good way to gather information on Japanese stocks - using the
Japanese moneycentral. If you copy the below link into the Google Chrome
browser and allow auto-translate, it will come up with company info and
financials going back 10 years:
http://jp.moneycentral.msn.com/investor/quotes/jpcompanyprofile.aspx?symbol=JP%
a6365

In the case of DWS - this outfit trades at roughly 1/2 tangible book and less
than 8x trailing earnings. FWD earnings are however much lower, estimates are
for 70Yen/share, which would be a PE of 21. Revenues are projected to be down
by 15%. It may come out a bit better because my experience is that Japanese 1
year forecasts are very conservative the 5 year forecasts tend to be
aggressive.

DMW' business is pumps - large pumps. The clownbuck logic behind the buy is :
Tsunami--> lot's of water= need pumps
(Again use Google Chrome and "autotranslate" for legit results:)
http://www.dmw.co.jp/

This is truly a microcap with only 85M$ in market cap. My bet is that the
business will recover (it's mostly late cycle stuff) because the producs they
build is needed; Pumps for oil and gas industry, water & sewer systems,
utilities and the like.

My guess is that there is only a handful of competitors building such huge
blowers and pumps in the world. DMW, despite being small does seem to do a
decent amount of export business based on the client list:

Just a note:

SPU filed 10K with unqualified opinion by BDO. BDO did not audit internal
controls, but management did a review and discloses some deficiencies from 2009
acquisition. So question to Spek and others - should we buy SPU now?

HRBN has gone up quite a bit from their 10K release. So is "market right"
there? Or is it a great short?

Personally, I am not sure how we can decide which ones of the leftover RTOs are
legit. All the ones with unqualified 2010 auditor opinion (or should we also
restrict auditors to big 4?)? All the ones with no deficiencies in internal
controls? I am not aware of a single RTO company that satisfies both conditions
above. Or do we wait until 2011 for companies that satisfy both conditions?

Madharry - you could well be right. I have studied the Japanese companies since
we discussed them in 2007 and 2008 (Sumitomo and Itochu). My observation is
that changes are brewing in Japan but it's very slow. overall, the balance
sheet (which were very overleveraged in the 1990's) are in much better shape
and the ROA are better too.

These companies really remind in about European stocks in the early 19080's or
even the stocks that WEB made his fortune in (or at least got started) in the
1950's. The Japanese have 20 years of a brutal bear market behind them. Most
Japanese own very little or no stocks. I am surprised about the generous
Dividend yield with many Japanese companies. Considering that you can easily
borrow in Yen for 2% LT , those 3-5% that many stocks yields make stocks a huge
bargain.

re DMW Corp. Dividend was 70Y/share with the stock trading at 1500Yen. Of
course it is well possible that the dividend will be reduced with this years
earnings to be projected much lower.

They also bought back ~2% of their outstanding shares this year in what appears
like a brokered transaction.

DMW actually sailed through the recession without problems according to the
numbers, I assume they had a large backlog that is running out now. I have seen
similar patterns with other pump manufacturers or infrastructure/industrials
like Alsthom , so I think it's not a company specific issue, just the late
cycle nature of the business. These large pumps go into huge installations and
the orders for those tend to lag economic cycles.

Disagree on the man and his companies.

Frankly, he is looking to maximise the value of his holdings by selling to the
public shareholder at the most optimal time for him. I cannot see any of his
IPOs being a good investment, particularly as the toppy rates that are achieved
for many of his rig assets at the moment are likely to be reasonably close to
market highs, even if we don't see a downturn for some time yet - little space
for returns as a result.

These things are only in value territory if you think the dividend yield is
attractive and sustainable. Think again. These have time and time again been
proven unsustainable in listed shipping companies. The industry is commoditised
with low barriers to entry in many sectors (capital aside in the large drilling
sector), which simply attracts more entrants who destroy the returns.

Mark my words, he is a canny operator, but you won't come out ahead of him

Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings, S.A. (NYSE:FSR - News) today announced that its
preliminary estimate for losses related to the March 2011, earthquake and
tsunami in the Tohoku region of Japan is expected to be between $80 to $130
million net of reinstatement premiums and retrocession. The Company’s estimated
loss is based on an estimated industry loss of between $25 billion and $35

IMHO FSR's estimate is a WAG. However, they are partially right: if they
provide reinsurance, their losses will depend on how much the companies they
reinsured lose. So if these companies provide estimate of 25B-35B, FSR kinda
needs to base its estimate on that number. They could say, "our clients are
idiots and their real costs will be XX-YY billion", but this would be very bad
PR. If FSR undererestimates, it would be accused to not listening to their
clients. If they overestimate, the clients might be unhappy that FSR is
second-guessing their estimates. Now they are kinda safe: "our clients
estimated 25B-35B, if they were right, our estimate would have been right too".

That being said, it is unclear if FSR is a great deal even with current
estimates. I lightened on my position during current bounceback. I am not
planning to buy more and might exit the position if price bounces up on no
news.

Disclaimer: I am not an insurance and reinsurance expert. I would be happy to
hear comments of any insurance or reinsurance experts on FSRs press release and
overall loss estimation process.

Hi Paul - Good overview of your thought process on your sales. Are you looking
at forward PE's to come up with "fair value" figures or rather peeling off
shares as PE's approach historical mean values? As the market reaches new
highs, I am more apt to peel off shares, book profits w/ the expectation to
reenter down the road at lower prices. So far this strategy has not worked out
for me that well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is my first take at arriving at a fair value figure for the LEI JV w/
Marathon Oil announced Friday April 1, 2011. It is based on a back of an
envelope first guess based on a very interesting 241 page Eagle Ford report
(for the LITTLE TOM FIELD located in ZAVALA COUNTY, TEXAS) prepared for Dyami
Energy LLC may 2010.

(Note: The 241 page pricing model is quite interesting and makes a lot of
assumptions to arrive at their conclusion (pg. 8-10).
http://www.eagleford.com/docs/RPS_report.pdf )

Lucas Energy strikes Eagle Ford deal with Marathon
http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2011/04/01/lucas-energy-strikes-eagle-f
rd-deal.html?ana=yfcpc

From the article:"...Marathon Oil has acquired 50 percent of Lucas’ leasehold
interest rights in Wilson County, which represents about 1,000 net acres below
the base of the Austin Chalk formation. Marathon will manage drilling
operations for the joint venture as the operator, but Lucas will still own the
rights above the Eagle Ford geologic formation...".
-------------------------------------------------------------------

I assumed that this was a "NET Carry" contract where Marathon incurs all the
well development costs for the 1,000 acre field and shares in 50% of the Oil &
NG produced over the life of the field.

Based on 130 acre spacing for each well, the proposed development should
require aprox 7.6 net new wells.

<u>Eagleford Energy's Matthew Lease - A Case Study </u>
http://www.eagleford.com/projects/matthews-lease.aspx

From the RPS Report:"...According to the RPS Report the reservoir quality of
Eagleford Energy’s Matthews Lease is “comparable” to Petrohawk’s Redhawk field
located six miles to the northeast. RPS reported the leasehold has an Eagle
Ford Shale oil resource potential of 4 million barrels based on reported
parameters from EOG (130 acre spacing unit) and Petrohawk (200,000 barrel oil
recovery per well)...."

<u>CONCLUSION FROM THE RPS REPORT:</u> "...The 5-acre full development plus
pilot is expected to recover 6,843.5 Mbbls oil and generate a US $24,599 M NPV
at a 10% discount rate. The BTAX ROR for the expansion plus pilot project is
approximately 15%. ..."

Therefore, the expected 5 acre full development return s/b $24.6K/5 acre. For
the full 1000 acres then should equal 1000/5 x $24.6K) $4.92 M.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

LEI has 16.6 Million shares outstanding so $4.92M represent about $0.30/share.
This model used $80.00/barrel when calculated the NPV.

I continue to hold my shares. If this was indeed a Net Carry JV, the oil field
development would be at no cost to LEI. The only future downside would be if
MRO kills the project in the middle of it's development.

My biggest concern reading the announcement was where would LEI get their share
of the capital to develop the field. If it is not a Net Carry JV then it means
a 30%-35% "future" share dilution to raise the $9.5M (50% 0f 7.5 Net Well @
$2.5M/well) to develop the 1,000 acre field.

Maybe MRO will eventual buy out LEI's interests in a tax free stock deal using
MRO shares which LEI would then distribute to shareholders.

Re: Lucas Energy, Inc. Common Stock (AMEX: LEI ) - A simple back of the
envelope analysis.

Here is an edit to my earlier post regarding LEI's JV deal w/ MRO.

My take away from the Little Tom Field Analysis:
http://www.eagleford.com/docs/RPS_report.pdf

1) On pg-17- :"...The 5,237 acres within the Dyami Little Tom reported
leasehold has an Eagle Ford Shale oil resource potential of 8 million barrels
based on reported parameters from EOG (130 acre spacing unit) and Petrohawk
(200,000 barrel oil recovery per well) as discussed earlier in this report..."

They concluded that their 5,237 acres parcel had an Eagle Ford Shale oil
reserve of 8 million barrels.

This implies that LEI's 1,000 acres could contain as much as 1.5 million
barrels. (They are similar formations and geographic locations)

A 50% interest would net them 750K barrels of possible field reserves.

2) The report (pg-37-) calculates a recovery cost for Eagle Ford shale of
between $32.27/barrel & $38.56/barrel. For this analysis I will assume
$35.00/barrel.

If you assume $80.00/barrel avg price, LEI could net $45.00/barrel on their
share of oil produced over the life of the field. <u>Therefore the total Net
value of their share of probable reserves (ie 750K barrels) could be worth as
much as $33.75 million or about $2.03/share.</u>

Depending on the specific terms of the MRO JV deal and how their "actual"
developmental and production expenses are shared, LEI could receive additional
recovery cost credits from MRO for the 50% interest consideration already
received. Therefore, my WAG of $33.75 million (or $2.03/share) is at the low
end estimate of possible value(s).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The stock was up $0.46/share on the news Friday (inter day as high as
$1.05/share).

The MRO JV deal could be worth as much as $2.03/share and much more if Oil
stays above $80/barrel. As a result LEI's shares s/b valued between $5.50-$6.00
and IMO remains 35%-50% undervalued. The company has other ongoing JV deals and
additional acreage that can also be developed in the future which could add
further value to the shares.

Lucas Energy. Thx for the analysis/update.

LEI says in one part of their recent presentation that they estimate net asset
per share at $5.98 based on 13.M sh. Elsewhere in the presentation, they say
(as you do) that shares out are 16.6M. My intent is to hold on and not sell
anymore until at least that net asset value based on 16.6M. Which is $82M (from
presentation)/16.6M = $4.94. (Stock closed Fri. at $4.05)

I don't know terms of the agreement with MRO. If there's a "make whole" aspect,
at some point LEI will have to cough up money or barrels to MRO to pay for some
part of MRO's development costs. I didn't read anything about an override, so
I'll guess that at some point LEI also has to share maintenance expenses with
MRO on these wells. Still, the deal seems very positive for LEI as reflected by
the stock's sharp rise after deal announcement.

re 3rd Ave - agreed that Marty Whitman's funds are definitely nt recession

3rd Ave or other straight stock funds can never really protect from a downturn

re DBLE - I had them on my watchlist for a long time. based on what I read, I
would not put them in the "astute management" bucket. They used to do coal bed
methane (very high operating costs) and some high impact elephant exploration

I took a small position based up someone else advice. i really know very little
about it. all i know is that that they do have some significant oil play
acerage that someone thinks is now valuable.
I certainly would not rely on my purchase as any kind of guidance that this
will work out. I am pretty much an ignoramus when it comes to energy plays. I
am significantly more confident in selecting mining plays. I pretty much like
to follow an industry insider into a company, or stick with people who have
been successful before. I am now trying to extrapolate a bit by following
successful energy investors into their selections as I do i want to be invested

Re: Double Eagle Petroleum Co. (DBLE)- bought
Re: Dominion Resources, Inc. (D) - closed out position
(Bought D 8/2009 @ 33.50 closed out position @ $44.85)

This is a good discovery Paul. The have well established NG properties and
interest in the Rockies Express ("REX")NG pipeline that will serve the West
coast "growth" market. This emerging midstream operation IMO is a hidden gem
and will be a valuable asset as NG demands grows in CA.

Double Eagle also owns over 90,000 gross and 70,000 net acres in Niobrara Oil
Shale region. One of the areas I really like because of their high grade oil.
According to their Web site, they will be drilling two new wells here in 2011.

The company only has 11.18 million shares outstanding but are somewhat
leveraged with $32 million in revolving bank debt (almost $3.00/share). They
are cash flow positive but may have to raise capital in the future to finance
their planned well expansion. This may dilute current shares.

In their most recent presentation (pg-15-), they show a Net Asset Value per
share in the amount of $18.75/share. It's only a matter of time before the
market recognizes this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Sold my remaining shares of Dominion Resources, Inc. (D) and put 1/2 the

of these shares to generate income. Will buy more shares below $9.00/share.

Hello Clownbuck,

I agree that technically the chart of CSCO is rough to advocate buying. And I
do think Charts can reflect fundamental surprises, but I also think that Cisco
is being joined here by MSFT and INTC as all three are back in solid value
ranges again.

Maybe it's 'risk-on' and these stocks are being sold? Maybe it's some European
financial institutions trying to shore up balance sheets by selling some of
these stocks?

I bought some CSCO today, and I'm now considering adding back to INTC (no
position right now) and MSFT (small-to-medium position right now) now that
they're back to value ranges. My trick is what to sell... Not quite ready to
say oil companies are overvalued yet, but maybe soon...

IMO energy and mining stocks are easier to estimate future growth as you'll
know roughly how many barrels of oil a day can be produced or how much can be
mined, but that's just from a novice's point of view.

If what EKS says is correct, then DBLE looks to be quite an undervalued stock,
will continue to watch it and probably add a small position if it dips below
$9. However, I can understand where Clownbuck is coming from, given the

Paul, these are some very nice gains you are realizing. I only own BK from the

about Banking have held the stock back. The dividend increase is a positive.

I think this is very solid bank that sells significantly below historic
averages at 12x Y2011 earnings. Earnings would rise substantially if interest
rates were to rise, since in this case they could earn a nice NIM on their low

Hi Madharry:

I wonder where the top is but if their is some type of "Black Swan" event where

just extended), these prices could go much higher.

Gold Rises to Record $1,452 on ‘Chaos’ Hedge; Silver Tops $39

From the article:"...“What’s looming ahead is the fear that if there is a

Klopfenstein of Lind-Waldock said.

Dennis Gartman, an economist and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based
Gartman Letter, told clients to sell Japanese equities and buy gold...."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I still believe there is a lot more value in the Jr. Gold Miners (my position
is w/ the GDXJ ETF) especially those that are producing, are profitable and
have large reserves. The companies must be located in a stable country like
Canada or the US. Gold up 1.4% today but the GDXJ is up 4%.

Oil should also benefit from the flight to quality assets. Owning any of the
currencies of these bankrupt countries will end up w/ little or no value.

If things get really bad, people will use their gold and silver to buy food (at
any price). I am not too sure what the end game is and what to do for an exit
strategy but my portfolio is hedged w/ 4% in Gold & Palladium stocks (

BBD sell @21.01; shares bought 11/07 @ $16.64-$17.54.
Disappointed in slow stock performance of this Brazilian bank. I continue to
hold a full position.

GOV selling a little more @ $26.98; shares bought 11/10 @ $25.69. I'll try to
buy back these back at lower price.

QADMF out @$14.90; shares bought 5/07 @ $11.49.
Lost patience with it

PVR trimmed more @$27.59; shares bought $26.64. This was just a trade on
acquisition of PVG by PVR. Still trying to eke out a few more pennies before I
completely exit this lp.

AMP closed @$62.12; in 7/10 @$36.71. Prominent error by me with this one:
bought only a most small tracking position (mistake one). Tracked it all
right,but never had courage and or focus to add shares (mistake two).

BIG: trimmed @44.12; these shares bought 10/10 @$33.05. This stock mentioned
and owned by me many times over the past years. Current situation is this:
company says it is reviewing its options and may put itself up for sale. If so,
the scuttlebutt is that the shares will go for at least $50 per and with a
chance of up to $60. I hold a full position. At current price, stock to me or
for me is fairly priced and by that, I'd be a seller. I have no courage to hold
all my shares on the hope that there will be a buyout, and at a price at $50 or
more. Since there's now, imo, a premium built into the stock -- the expectation
that there will be that $50 buyout - I'll just take a few shares off the table.
I still hold a full position now though.

NI. Trim some at $19.26; bought 10/10 @ $17.76. Most utility stocks I am
following are near 12-mo highs. At this time, I'll take a chance on SUG by
switching into a little SUG @$28.71. Whereas NI has some superior metrics such
as lower p/bv and much higher dividend yield, SUG has been consistently able to
increase its book value (not so with NI). I may be able to live with that
longer than I can tolerate NI's stalled growth in stated bv and low returns on
that book value.

A discussion of cheapness of LLY must include Lily's patent expirations. Here's
a current analysis by somebody who owns the stock and makes his case:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/258092-how-eli-lilly-will-face-patent-expiratio
s

"Revenues are nearly certain to fall in 2011 and again in 2012. If Eli Lilly is
able to maintain 2012 profit levels beyond that, then the stock is currently
fairly valued. If Eli Lilly revenues continue falling beyond that without
recover, then the stock is currently overvalued. But if Eli Lilly is able to
significantly grow revenues after a few years of declining revenues, then the
stock is currently undervalued."

For me, too many "if's", too much good stuff has to happen years out to which I
can't attach a probability, so I'll pass again now on LLY. Just me, my opinion.
Others may be buyers.
================================

If the conclusion that LLY is cheap and is a buy is based solely on that
discounted cash flow that I glanced at in that link, well, that is a very
dangerous way to value this big pharma.

My top 10-ish positions in no particular order: NRF-A/B, UVIC, IDCC, UFPT,

GFRE - price drop; In: MSFT - bought more.

Positions increased: CHL, GFRE, MSFT
Positions reduced: PBEGF, CGPI, EBIX, FSR, CSGH
Positions eliminated: SPU, CLLZF, CEU
Flip-flop: NEWN

This period was marked with complete meltdown of Chinese RTOs. Most of it was
warranted and the jury is out on the remaining couple. I have sold most of my
positions (SPU, CEU, CSGH, CGPI) - way too late. I still have positions
remaining in CGPI (tiny), CSGH (medium), LTUS (tiny), NEWN (small), GFRE
(large), SDTH (halted), CELM (halted).

Another blowup was EBIX - a great lesson where margin of safety or buying cheap
saves the day. Even after the ~25% haircut, I sold partial position at a gain.
Of course, I should have sold some on the runup to $30, but I thought that EBIX
was a great long term hold.

Finally, FSR seems like a risky bet even with assurances of limited exposure to
Japanese reinsurance claims. I sold part of position on runup to mid 9ish.

I sold part of PBEGF since I am not sure it presents attractive value. I also
sold tiny CLLZF position, since the stock was not attractive for position
increase.

On the buy side, tech megacaps INTC and MSFT are cheap. But then we all know
that computers are obsolete and everyone will use iPads.

Thanks for the article.

Couple comments:

Open a bank account in Canada

I read through Bill Gross's April writeup
http://www.pimco.com/Pages/Skunked.aspx and tried to think of what to do if he
is right. Canada might be one of the possibilities, since a lot of other
currencies are as screwed (or even more) than dollar: Euro, Yen have their own
big issues. Brazil/China are possibilities, but they might have their own
crises too (especially China).

Note that bank account in Canada will just protect from USD decline. It won't
protect from any additional taxation or entitlement reorg that might hit US tax
residents. Also note that IRS requires you to list all foreign bank accounts
with more than 10K in them. Having them is not a crime, but probably a sure way
to audit. That's not a problem for Mike with his $B, might be a problem for
smaller folk. ;)

It might be possible to hold Can$ in US brokerage accounts though. I am not
sure what are limits and conditions. And probably such holdings are not FDIC
insured while Can$ bank account in Canada is probably their-equivalent-of-FDIC
insured. Again not an issue to Mike, might be issue for smaller fish.

He was very reluctant to reveal details of what he is investing in now

Hear, hear. I guess he's secretive nowadays. ;)

He has bought some farmland, but for very specific factors
including currency (didn't really expand on this)

Might be interesting. Might be too late. Personally, I hate illiquid
investments. Might feel different about it if I had couple $B.

He has funded some venture capital type investments in Silicon Valley;

Might be for fun. I am pretty sure it's impossible to get values in VC in Silly
Valley. Tech companies are notorious in super-dream-built valuations. But maybe
he bought Twitter. ;)

noted that Silicon Valley is the only place where pure capitalism exists today

do well with or without an acquisiton from a large company like Eli Lilly. But,
I think the economy of scale possibilities would make acquisitions very likely

Hi Paul -

PetroQuest Energy Inc. (PQ) came up on my search into Niobrara leases under
development.

From the Niobrara Shale (A blog dedicated to investment opportunities in the
Niobrara Shale)
http://niobrarashale.typepad.com/niobrara-shale/company-news/page/2/
02/03/2011
<u>PetroQuest Energy Updates Niobrara Shale Operations</u>

PetroQuest Energy (PQ) issued a year end operations update on its properties
prospective for the Niobrara Shale. The company has been involved with the play
on a non operated basis.

PetroQuest Energy reported that the Nevis #2 well has produced 20,000 barrels
of oil since coming onto production sixty days ago. The company has a 20% net
revenue interest in the Nevis #2 well. The well was put on artificial lift in
January after experiencing some down time and is now producing 360 barrels of
oil per day.

PetroQuest Energy said that the Hester #3 well, the company’s third non
operated well into the Niobrara Shale, will be spud during the first quarter of
2011. The company has allocated between $11 million and $12 million to
participate in 12 to 15 gross Niobrara Shale wells in 2011.

Stock has run up but could become a value Buy on any significant correction. I
like their very strong balance sheet, the cash generated from operations
(enough to fund future E&P), and their success in adding to their reserves (see
pg-6- of presentation).

Here is their most recent presentation <u>March 2011</u>:

Pg-22 Ranks Comparative Valuations to Peers. Lots of names here you will
recognize
http://www.petroquest.com/PDFs/Mar_000.pdf

Their 2011 focus is on developing their Niobrara Oil (10% growth). Their a
gassy company (79%) but this cash flow pays for their oil development.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Didn't see this one mentioned in any of your posts. There is some interest in
the company at Big Dog's Boom Boom thread. They are in at $7.50-$8.50/share
which for me would also provide a reasonable value buy.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=PQ+Key+Statistics

They sold interests in their NG gathering business in 2008 ($44M), sold equity
in 2009($38M) and received $60M JV payment in 2010 for a 50% interest in their
Woodford project. As a result, this is one of a very few companies where their
annual net income < 4X Debt.

AAB.TO,

I like this stock and own it. You get exposure to commodities with what seems
like a good management that has experience and exposure to deal flow.

That being said, I have been tracking the top holdings of the portfolio, and it
doesn't look that good recently. By my calcs, they are about 18% lower
(Canadian dollars) than the last NAV publication. Also, there are warrants at
1.00 CAD that could be dilutive to future NAV. When those warrants were close
to being exercised (they aren't now), I had estimated NAV diluation of 0.15.

There is a lot of the portfolio I am not tracking, so my guesstimate could be
far off. There is also potential gravy that could add substantially to the NAV,
such as incentive shares. Nevertheless, I am inclined to hold and not add here
to see if I can buy it at a better discount in the future.

paulson showed up on cnbc with a flow chart. I could not remember seeing a secy

I don't get the logic behind opening a Canadian bank account too. You can get
exposure to foreign currencies in a ,lot of different means. With Interactive
brokers you can run your account in different base currencies or you can just
buy chunks of foreign currency cash for 2.5$ a trade.

I don't even think that canadian banks are that safe, the RE market is pretty
bubbly up there. there is no subprime market per say in Canada, so the downturn
may not be as steep but i still can see severe problems sooner or later. Also
in some cases, foreign account holders are not entitled to the same protection
from the government than natives, better check the rules in the country you
have the bank account.

So what's your answer to depreciating US$? Foreign equities? Commodities?

Investing public wants to know. ;) Especially with your new moniker. ;)

IMHO, things are not as simple as talking heads portray them. E.g. even if we
agree that US$ has problems, it's not clear whether other currencies don't. You
yourself have reservations about Cdn$. Also commodities (and g-word) are high
already, so it's not clear that, for example, China crash won't drag them down
more than US$ would fall due to its problems. There is also interconnectedness
factor. If US$ falls, local products get cheaper, so exports rise, other
countries' products get more expensive so their equities may suffer, etc. Or in
reverse, if US gets influenza due to US$ problems, other countries may also get
near-death experience when they can't sell as much to US. (Yes, Brazil may be
self-sufficient, but then a socialist president gets elected and destroys the
country. ;)).

Hello Jurgis Bekepuris,

>>>Open a bank account in Canada<<<

I wonder how much correlation there is between the Canadian dollar and the
price of oil & gold??? Would it be better/easier to own gold & oil stocks?
Wonder how strong the Loonie will be at $75 WTI oil price?

>>>He has bought some farmland, but for very specific factors
including currency (didn't really expand on this)<<<

I'm not sure about buying US farmland, (from the things I read, there may be a
bit of a bubble forming in US farmland price already)? I guess, at a worst case
scenario, he could hold that farmland for long term + produce from it, he would
do ok???

http://www.agrimoney.com/news/us-land-price-surge-provokes-fears-among-bankers-

Given (hopefully) steady demand (even if it trends down a few percent from
todays demand) from asian countries for agriculture related & raw material
related items, would investment in Aussie Ag & Raw Material company stocks be a
better bet than US farmland?

FWIW......outside of my 401K & Rollovers, I've got a good bit, about 40% of my
wagon hitched to Canadian O&G related stocks and Aussie Raw Material & Ag
stocks, also started to buy some more Aussie Ag related stuff. A couple of
months ago I bought these:

Several other Aussie Ag plays I like, but they are more fully valued or have to
many shares out, I have 14 more on my watch-list, if anyone wants the symbols
give me a pm.

Anyone know of a way to take advantage of the current high prices farmers in
the US pay for diesel? Do they pool their resources and hedge/buy forward
contracts? Short of converting their gear to run on natural gas do they have
other options??? Any value plays/ideas in this area?

I tried to look for ideas in the Nitrogen/Fertilizer areas:

If the US tanks again, the rest of the world will tank with it......no???

IMO those that said that the BRICs would uncouple from the US/EU markets and
their economies would continue to do well when the US/EU implosion started in
08 were very wrong.

Anyway, is there anywhere out there to run & hide (safe investments) should the
US tank again??? I sure hope the world continues to want to eat food & use
energy!

Where will the very best value plays be located (stock sectors/countries)
if/when the almighty dollar starts to gain strength???

I did well in getting out of the markets way in June/July 08, also was smart
enough to lower my risk profiles in my Rollovers & 401K in October 07, if need
be, hopefully I can accomplish that again!

Thanks for the continuing value investing education from you folks on this

Your list of trims is helpful. I am finding that most are in the 18 month hold
time frame. I now use the Subject Search feature on this and other threads
before I make my buys. Several of your posts come up and remind me of why I
like the stock (the value opportunity) and where my entry point should be.

GOV: I currently hold shares. This is on my buy more list below $25.00/share

GOV selling a little more @ $26.98; shares bought 11/10 @ $25.69. I'll try to
buy back these back at lower price.

How do you manage these "Buy back later" candidates? Do you use GTC orders or
maintain a "buy" watch list or like me a mental note? I need to set up a better
system as these take time a patients to come back into the value buy territory.
When we do have a sustained 15% correction, I want to be ready with my "buy
back later" stocks.

NI. Trim some at $19.26; bought 10/10 @ $17.76. Most utility stocks I am
following are near 12-mo highs. At this time, I'll take a chance on SUG by
switching into a little SUG @$28.71. Whereas NI has some superior metrics such
as lower p/bv and much higher dividend yield, SUG has been consistently able to
increase its book value (not so with NI). I may be able to live with that
longer than I can tolerate NI's stalled growth in stated bv and low returns on
that book value.

I will continue to hold my NI position (1/2010 @ $14.86). I made one sale a bit
too early 7/2010 @ $16.35. Although the dividend is now below 5% (actual yield
4.7%), their forward PE of 13.28 is lower than their trailing PE 18.51. (Note:
Not the case w/ D and that is why I closed out that position the other day).
NI's NG transmission pipeline network (15K miles of interstate pipes) and
storage infrastructure is a valuable asset. These assets come into play
especially with all the new US domestic NG.

Both MDU and AGL have huge NG storage infrastructure and are on my value buy
watch list but at lower prices.

I also own SE (same industry) but it is on my "to be" sold list (and will close
out my position) since the dividend is now below 4% and their forward PE is
almost above 15 close to their trailing PE of 16.5. I acquired my share 2/2009
( @ $13.28) and sold 50% 11/2009 at $19.50 (way too early). At $27.10 the stock
is close to a multi year high. This is another one that I will put on my buy
back later list but at lower prices once I close out the position.

Currencies,

Clownbuck, I agree with you on running your brokerage account in different base
currencies -- you can even do it from Fidelity with a little work, although I
hear that Interactive Brokers is the best.

Intuitively, I like currencies such as the Aussie and Canadian dollar. It is a
nice story -- sound economies that export commodities to the rest of the world?
Much better place to be than an insolvent US, right?

However, it is not all that simple, even if you are a commodities bull. The
Aussie and Canadian are extremely overvalued on purchasing power parity basis
(for example, the Big Mac index). The Euro is overvalued on this basis as well,
while the Yuan is cheap.

I still like Canadian exposure, but I recognize that I'm paying a hefty premium
to own the Canadian dollar. If things somehow got bad in Canada, that premium
could shrink or disappear.

Hi EKS. Like you, for buys on a watch list, I mostly keep a mental note. I
might have one to three on a GTC at any given time. I don't like to have more,
because in a sudden market draft they could all go off as sellers' stops are
hit; I don't want so much of my monies committed to buys all at once. Right now
the only GTC buy I still have is for UFPT under $15. (My congrats to longs here
who bought; I was too slow and the stock got away from me (now @$18).)

I've been slowly selling D: Feb.@ $44, Mar. @$45+ & $46+. I show I paid $32.80
for the shares. If I can get something over $46 for my remaining shares, I'll
likely sell.

I continue to hold MDU & AGL. I'm reinvesting dividends in MDU and looking to
buy more MDU if stock should fall. AGL I want to review to see if I will
consider adding to.

I sold all my SE by end of 2011 as stock moved up.

My worst performing utility stock seems to be PPL. I'm underwater on most
shares (purchases 9/10-2/11)

With market up yet again, I cut back on several positions.

Fwiw,

sold about 1/2 OMG at prices $36.02 & $36.26. In at $29.42 from 6/10. Scared by
a negative article about how they likely will be affected by Japanese
customers.

FTE. Just tired of holding this French telecom. Sold about 1/3 @$22.75. These
shares short term loss with purchases 4/10 at ~$23. (I have shares from 6/09 @
$22.72, and the nowhere improvement in stock price coming up to a two-year
holding is a reason I'm somewhat giving up.)

NGPC. Slightly trimmed a full position in this bdc. Sale today @ $9.50 for
shares purchased 11/9-4/10 @ $7.40/$8.17.

MPW. Trimmed position a little. Sale @ $11.66 of shares acquired 8/10 @ $9.28.
Another one where I'd like to reenter again at a lower than current price.

AXS. Closed position as I reduce some exposure to insurance companies. Sale @
$35.60; purchased 12/09 - 3/11 at avg cost $30.62.

Clownbuck,

I live in Toronto and I tried to find an explanation for the huge jump in house
prices. Last summer the houses on my street were selling for a week. At prices
between 800,000CAD and 1.3 mil. The average house price is about 415,000. The
banks practically have no mortgage risk for properties that are purchased with
less than 25% down payment. From the data I could find the average family
income is 96,000 so the ratio is about 4.3. This should be normal. I don't know
how much I can trust, that the data is correct. The banks have no risk because
CHMC insures everything with less than 25% down. So the Canadian tax payer is
on the line if things go south. But what can make things go south? Increase of
interest rates or unemployment. I doubt that they will be able to increase
interest rates substantially any time soon. What can happen that the income of
people go down? I think there is not much way up from this level. But I was
thinking this way 3 -4 years ago and I was wrong. I cannot find the logic here.
I would appreciate your opinion why the house market may go down?

Re: Rex Energy Corporation (REXX)
PetroQuest Energy Inc. (PQ)
Callon Petroleum Co. (CPE)

I view REXX like PQ, both in their maturing growth stage where they are finally
booking net earnings and shortly should show favorable relative PE's. REXX also
has a very favorable net income to long term debt profile (even better than PQ)
1.6:1.

Both of these companies are financing their 2011 CAPEX drilling programs from
cash flows and have an aggressive program planned for 2011. REXX continues to
invest in their Appalachian NG/Oil Gathering business and in 2-3 years may be
able to spin off a percentage to an MLP (to raise more capital if necessary).
70% of their new capital is going into this region. REXX has more Oil assets
(70% Oil/30% NG) than either PQ or CPE.

Callon Petroleum Co. (CPE) is more like PetroQuest Energy Inc. (PQ) as both
have interest offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. CPE has a bit more deep water
assets. Even after paying down debt and doing a 2nd stock offering, CPE carries
more debt than either REXX or PQ.

CPE is a recent addition for me w/ buys in 1/11 and 2/11.

Of the three, REXX has the best past performance:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=5y&s=PQ&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=rexx%2Ccpe

I think after reviewing the REXX presentation, I like that they are building
out their NG Gathering business and also have plays in the Niobrara high grade
shale oil region. They are well ahead of the other two developing their Oil
assets too. I think I will follow your lead and sell my CPE and put the
proceeds into REXX.

I would even consider REXX a "value" buy, based on their conservative balance
sheet, developing NG gathering business, proven oil reserves (especially w/ oil
at $108/barrel) and 45K net acres Niobrara land assets. This could be a
rewarding 2-3 year hold.

Dino,

Good question about Cdn$ and oil/gold. Can't answer.

With farmland as with houses, the value price is when your rent yield is good
enough. Obviously you adjust for location and longer term trends, but if
current rent yield sucks, then it's likely overvalued. I don't do houses or
land, so I can't say what the situation is.

Probably I should start looking at Aussie stocks. So far I was only buying the
ones I can purchase in US markets. Maybe I should seriously think about trading
on ASX.

>If the US tanks again, the rest of the world will tank with it......no???

Quite possibly

>should the US tank again??? I sure hope the world continues to want to eat
food & use energy!

As you saw in 2009, world stopped using energy. Or at least oil fell to $35. So
much for hiding there. I am not sure about food. Possibly it's more local and
less economically sensitive. But for some reason I think it also won't hold
very well. Perhaps g-word - that's one thing, which is driven by emotion and
not consumption/use.

>>So what's your answer to depreciating US$? Foreign equities? Commodities? <<

Raw materials and crude and gold appear to be crowded trades. For somebody
betting on depreciating $ and higher inflation, my best guess would be to
invest in residental RE. You can lever it 4:1 (assuming 20% down) with
non-recourse fixed interest rate debt. Sure, the value of the asset could go
down if interest rate rise but I think the value of the loan would go down too,
although that would not be "market to market". Most likely however higher
interest rates will come with higher inflation.

RE is an option available to anybody with cash and a decent credit rating and
it's not a crowded trade at all. The key is the the intrinsic hedge via LT
financing with a fixed interest mortgage. The big disadvantage is that it's not
liquid and requires work. Unless there is a deflation (the bet on inflation
going horribly wrong), one would come up OK. if it get's really bad you stick
it to the bank and write off you downpayment.

Welcome to the thread Keith O. re: WATG. I liked low p/e, revenue growth,
Pricewaterhouse as stated auditors.

I don't like re-audits.

I goofed when I bought the stock: initially I believed they also were in or
moving to go to into air bag manufacturing. Seems though they are and/or will
be mostly a mundane auto parts manufacturer - alternators/engine valves etc.
Not really an attractive business to me, unless the p/e is low. (Have held USA
similar companies that went bk, so I'm cautious about any/all.)

I don't like that this is one of a large number of Chinese stocks that
apparently looks like a value investment (and may well be) but whose stock
price falls to levels where, if it were USA companies, one could assume they
are frauds or companies nearing bankruptcy or in some national recessionary
period. I had many Chinese like this, and I just decided enough...and I began
exiting positions.

I didn't look close enough to understand the ramifications of listing
subsidiary Jinzhou Halla on a Chinese exchange so as to give the sub a larger
p/e. I don't know what a large or larger p/e might be for an alternator mfger,
but as I say, to me it ought to be fairly low.

Still hold FSIN (hoping the mgmt buyout offer will bail me), CADC (I like
cement co's), HEAT, and GAI. All in negative territory.

Among the larger cap, I hold CYD, and recent adds CHL & GSH.

I had looked at those Japanese stocks and others and decided not to buy
anything. Some of the Japanese stocks mentioned here early on, such a brewery,
apparently have recovered or at least had a dead bottle bounce. So some guys
who've been buyers here may have an opinion different from mine.
===================================
Didn't take more than a few years after WWII for Japanese to go from nothing
and lousy quality with their nothing, to sophisticated consumer products having
high quality that people were eager to buy. I'll assume the Japanese people
will use their skills and systems and hard work to recover again quickly.

Except...this time when they go to export, they've got tough tough competition.
My bet is that while Japan struggles, Korea will step in to take market share
in electronics and in cars. So I have punched up my exposure to Korea. (Big
risk with Korea seems to be war with N.Korea)

Maybe Germany will benefit with their exports too. Hard for anyone to know.
Japanese components may be in many products assembled in Germany, and if
there's a shortage of them, it may mean no completions of the final products.
I'll look now though at Volkswagen -- they are trying to really ramp up their
production, and they may have a good shot at selling all along various price
points (VW, AUDI, etc) if Japan can't deliver enough autos to USA/China
consumers.

Thanks for your thoughts Paul. Just got thru reading an article
that argues Japanese stocks aren't as cheap as one would think
because the yen is overvalued by approximately 15%. Not sure how
that value was arrived at or that the methodology was valid.

I like your idea on Korea. I was there with family last year on
a vacation and they appeared a young, prosperous nation with a
very hardworking population. Very competitive in autos, steel and
electronics.

I think the one area where competitors may really pick up a lot
of business is in electrical equipment. If Hitachi and Mitsubishi
manufacturing are hampered due to rotating blackouts, then GE,
Siemens, and ABB can pick up a lot additional business. I may
be off base, but I don't think the Koreans are as strong in that
particular area.

re Japanese -
I agree that the yen is overvalued - in fact that is a big problem for the
export oriented economy. In my view, if you purchase companies with a
reasonable export exposure, you are well hedged with respect to the Yen,
because earnings will soar with a lower Yen. FWIW, the Yen already retraced 5%
from peak values, so that is a boon for exporters. my sense is also that these
export companies will move more facilities into cheaper locale, boosting
earnings LT.

I can understand where Paul is coming from. Japan is different and the
companies are run different. They remind of stocks I looked at in the 80's in
Europe. Lot's of stocks with fairly low rentability but lot's of "substance",
tangible book , cash, RE, land that is not reflected in the current value. if
those values ever get lifted (and I am seeing signs of this), then Japanese
stocks should do exceedingly well.

I am probably going to enter some new positions but only after the prices come
down a bit.

Sold them too early and at too much of a discount.

re VOG Ins't 250M$+ in market cap sort of pricy for an E&P upstart with
virtually no revenues? In a way, they were never an operator, just buying and
selling leases and keeping a cut.

It will be interesting to see how they do now as a real E&P company. Of course
I am only watching from the sidelines with amazement. LOL.

Re: Sundance Energy Australia Limited (SDCJF.PK)

Doubled up on my 3/1/2011 buy. Company out with a new presentation (4/4/2011)

"...Development of our Bakken/Three Forks and Niobrara shale acreage (combined
~24,000 acres) could result in an enterprise value of >$700,000,000 and daily
production (net of royalties) >5,000 boepd in 2-4 years..."

 That translates to $2.50/share . . . . 150% higher than the current price
$0.975/share.

<u>Attractive Fundamentals for Price Appreciation</u>

o Well positioned to capitalize on strong oil prices through acreage position
in top U.S. oil shale resource plays (~67,000 US oil shale acres)
o 16.2 mboe of oily reserves in the Williston Basin targeting the Bakken and
Three Forks oil shales (~9,000 acre position) with aggressive development plan
to convert reserves to cash flow
o Exploitation of the Niobrara oil shale (~15,000 acre position) underway with
reserve potential not priced into current share price
o Significant portfolio of maturing oil shale prospects (~43,000 acre position)
and track record of profitable early entry into top US onshore shale plays

Hi Clownbuck -

VOG is following the same business model as Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. Comm
(AMEX: NOG ). Their interests are with JV deals with driller/operators and it's
accomplished w/ contracts.

I was a little skeptical too but they raised over $50 M to finance their 2011
CAPEX. A lot of that money was raised in a private party deal (sold by several
of the analysts who cover the company). They also got warrants priced at
$7.50/share (and expire in 5 years). These boutique companies are legit. Their
original deal went out at $4.00/share before any of the test wells were
drilled.

At $4.20/share I feel it's a low risk entry point and a lot depends on how much
Oil is uncovered from their aggressive drilling program for 2011. Every quarter
will be interesting as key wells come into completion and the market will be
eying the flow rates.

Oil at $110/barrel will help too.

Got my fill today on this new issue. Was able to buy at a discount to lock in a
9.5% yield.

VOG. I added a little to my red position today. Not my fav among these stocks -
it's very hard (for me) to figure a value on VOG's acreage - but I'm willing to
hold for a year to see the results of their oil drilling. I like that the
company has acreage in several different shale plays; I hope that mitigates
some risk.
