I own some FNFG and my timing was atrocious - buying it just before the
announcement
of their purchase of HSBC New York branches. However, yield at time of purchase
was
about 5.2%...so doesn't make sense to sell, take a loss, and then hold the
resultant cash
at a yield of 1% or less. Makes even less sense now, so I guess I'm a
stuckholder.

Part of what's holding down the stock is market knows FNFG must issue about
$750-$800
million in new stock and raise $350 to $400 million in new debt to pay for the
acquisition.

I ended up buying ENH @ 35.2$ as well. These discounts to tangible book are
almost unprecedented in the insurance industry. in 2008/2009 book values took a
hit, now bonds are strong. The rational economic decision would be just to
liquidate. Some companies are doing this via stock re-purchases.

For now the string of recent losses may hold up re-purchases though.

UFPT - which "substantial contract ended"? If you're referring to:

A substantial portion of a large automotive door program ended on June 30,
2011. The Company expects that the end of this program will result in reduced
revenues of approximately $625,000 per month in its Georgia facility in the
second half of 2011, as compared to the same period of 2010. 

then it's only about 6% of revenue. Are you referring to something else?

BTW, company lost 1.4M medical contract last year and made it up in other
segments, so it's possible they can find lost revenues somewhere else again.
Contracts end every year in these companies. If you sell on contract end news,
you're already too late.

Re: Eaton Corporation (ETN)
Honeywell International Inc. (HON)

Thanks for suggesting ETN as a possible value Buy. I was looking for another
industrial/manufacturer to replace the HON shares I recently sold as my current
position is this sector is under weighted. If ETN can really meet those
analysts estimates and deliver a forward PE of 9, it looks pretty compelling. I
still like HON and their higher tech products that they add to the value chain.
Since Boeing recently landed a big plane order from American airlines (496 new
737 "upgraded" planes), I suspect HON will receive a lot of the new avionic
upgrade orders.

Boeing aims to capture $1 trillion in orders with new 737 MAX plane design.
Published: Tuesday, August 30, 2011, 7:30 PM
http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2011/08/boeing_aims_to_capture_1_trill.htm

From the article:"...Boeing Co. aims to capture half of a $2 trillion market in
the next 20 years with the 737 MAX, a new version of the world’s most widely
flown jetliner that will be powered by more fuel-efficient engines.

“This is an airplane that’s going to allow us not to just maintain the market
share we have, but one that will allow us to grow the market share,” Boeing
Commercial Airplanes President Jim Albaugh said at a news conference in Renton,
Washington, near the factory where the 737s are built....".

I looked at ETN and noticed that they have been using their cash to make two
recent acquisitions (one pretty large and one small but in a growing field).

<u>In August 2011, Eaton completed the acquisition of German Filtration Systems
Provider E. Begerow GmbH & Co KG.</u> The company develops and produces
technologically innovative filter media and filtration systems for food and
beverage, chemical, pharmaceutical and industrial applications. E. Begerow GmbH
& Co KG is headquartered in Langenlonsheim, Germany, employs approximately 270
people worldwide and had 2010 sales of more than $84 million.

<u>On August 31, 2011, the company also acquired the assets of IE Power,
Inc.</u> IE Power, which was founded in 1985, is based in Mississauga, Ontario,
Canada and employs 24 people. The company is a leading provider of high power
inverters for a variety of mission critical applications including solar, wind
and battery energy storage, with sizes from 100kW to 5MW. This acquisition was
done to bring next generation inverter technology to the company. They
eventually could be a leader in solar panel smart/efficient inverter
technology. These next generation inverters can increase the overall system
efficiency by at least 10%.

Both recent acquisitions are a positive but, it may take several years to have
any impact on the company's overall sales (Total Annual sales $15B).

I am going to do nothing for now but have added ETN on my watch list. I will
hold my HON shares and will add to my shares if the stock drops to where it
yields 4% (that's $34.00/share).

If ETN can grow their market in the solar, wind and battery storage area to
some meaningful percentage of sales (greater than 5% - $750M annual sales),
this could be one to add and at a very reasonable price. I will be watching how
they develop this emerging (and profitable) business. If they do more
synergistic acquisitions in this area (that will move the meter on their annual
sales), then I will start a tracking position in the company.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------
<u>HON vs ETN five year comparison:</u> (No significant divergence in price)
For me I would like to see at least a 20% divergence in price (ETN undervalued
by 20%) before I would do a "Switch" Buy ( ie. out of HON and into ETN) .

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=5y&s=HON&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=etn

Are you looking at ETN as a reversion to their mean earnings candidate since
their forward PE is estimated to be so low when compared to their peers? I am
suspect of the analysts growth in earnings. If ETN can gain market share and
expand their earnings in the Solar, Wind & battery storage sector, ETN could
look at PE expansion in 24-36 months. To me this is a more reasonable outcome
for the company than maintaining their current growth and profitability (w/
current product mix) in this economic environment.

Re ETN and other industrials - my suspicion is that the current weaker economic
growth yet need to be reflected. In earning estimates. I also think that margin
pressure is going to be more common with industrials too, cost are rising fast
in China , salaries rise in the double digits and the lissome YUAN appreciation
on top of that (unofficial goal for the Chinese is mid single digits against
the US$).That's a mid teens unit cost rise, sure productivity gains will take
some off from that number but I think unit cost will inadvertently rise and
this may. Result in margin pressure.

Yes, looking for ETN as reversion-to-mean p/e. As clownbuck suggests, this can
be dangerous. Because, in general for stocks, industrial stocks, the stock
price falls earlier than do analyst estimates or sometimes company estimates.
So while ETN now has an average forward p/e of 9 (very low), if earnings
estimates are cut, that p/e number will rise.

Company has been profitable each of the past ten years, has relative (to
itself) low p/b, and this stated bv has increased every year of past ten. I
figure with ETN's history and its diversified customer base and various product
lines, and with what I hope is the state and federal government's emphasis
seeing that jobs are created - that ETN and the other industrial stocks will do
okay. I guess now I might be holding ETN for 12-18 months. If earnings do fall
- they won't fall by much, and I'll be okay if I have to hold 18-24 months to
see improvement. Meanwhile, if stock does fall (to $34, which might happen), I
tell myself I'm prepared to add to the few shares I've bought.

I have only taken a superficial look, but there seem to be many insurers with
PEs < 10 and selling below book. This may be below book, but that PE is high (>
20 for past twelve months, this year estimate, and next year estimate), which
doesn't get me excited.

If it gets to $385, I think it is a good speculation on getting taken out on
the dutch tender offer, since the range is 385+ and there is an odd lot
provision.

What I like most is a trade that is both a good speculation and a good

the tender price wasn't satisfactory.

General Electric Co. (GE)

I was thinking of nibbling at some GE as a means to get to the FED's borrowing
window where the cost of money (at least for the next 2 years) will be
practically zero. I was a bit concerned as to GE's exposure to the suit filed
by FHFA against 17 banks Friday but found out that it is only $549M according
to this article;
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/List-of-banks-sued-over-apf-2663019756.html?x=0&.
=1 .

What surprised me is that Wells Fargo was not named in the FHFA filing, the
bank remains tied up in other legal cases though.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------

Obama is to speak Thursday and announce his new "Jobs" program and it could
include legislation that promotes more business lending. It's definitely going
to be some type of "New" Jobs legislation.

The thought on GE rather than w/ WFC is that GE has the better infrastructure
to make all kinds of business loans and/or loans on new capitalized equipment
and/or productivity increasing technology. Basically they are more business
friendly. Money loaned by GE Capital to businesses would help create new high
paying jobs (you need bodies to run the new equipment).

GE's ROE is at 11.5% similar to WFC so I suspect with a PE of 9 it might be a
value play on some new stimulus program that OBAMA may announce. A possible
negative is that they have more exposure around the world than WFC and any
European implosion would definitely hurt GE more so than WFC.

Finally, there was some talk that a government sponsored mortgage re-finance
program might be initiated to help home owners reset their current mortgages to
lower rates (those not in default). This would eventually put more money into
the economy since lower rates would provide more spendable cash to makes its
way back into the economy. Sounds good but we know that many of these
Government initiatives never really work and end up having unintended
consequences.

Is there a value play on Obama's pending announcement(s)?

re GE - my beef with GE Capital is that it does not really have secure funding.
If short term funding freezes, GE capital will again have problems and will
have to go to Uncle Sam for funding. They run with about 125B$ in short term
financing currently.I also think that GE capital's assets are not as safe as
those of most banks (they have quite a bit of lending going on in Europe) and
more effected by a weak economy.

The biggest knock for GE is that you still pay ~ 10X earnings for an industrial
that generates 70% of it's earnings from industrial operations and 30% from a
(very lousy managed, imo) financing operation. You can nowadays buy a clean
industrial without the financing ops baggage for almost the same valuation. Why
would I buy GE under these circumstances?

As for the government stuff - who know what it will or will not do. I have
learned however, that the government "help" is not going to be for free, it may
be well intended but how will work out when the politicans are done with it.
just look at the TARP controversity. TARP was a very timely and well intended

Which P&C insurers & reinsurers are trading at PEs < 10 and below book? From
what I see most of them have huge losses this year, so no PEs at all. And WTM
is also showing losses for H1/2011, so also no PE. Even BRK is having insurance
losses this year, and presumably you'll agree that they are among the best.

In general, I'm afraid that PEs mean very little for P/C (re)insurers. The
losses are huge and lumpy and low PEs usually show short-term good pricing
environment and a year with no cats. Companies like BRK that invest float into
securities may show low PEs in a bad year if the securities perform greatly.
The insurers investing in fixed income very rarely can show positive results in
a bad year.

So I disagree with your argument. The real question about WTM is whether they
can continue their long term book growth outperformance (13% a year...).

Sorry, but I don't use forward PEs and I do not have any clue about how correct

AHL and ENH are cheaper on some metrics. However, their historical business
performance is worse than WTM. AHL had about 10% book value growth for 10
years, while ENH had 8% (12% per share book growth due to stock buybacks). This
makes a huge difference compared to 13% due to compounding.

Perhaps WTM's investment in Mike Burry contributed to their stellar results. :)
If this is the case, we won't see it repeated. ;) On the other hand, if they
spot other good investment opportunities, they may outperform AHL and ENH
again. (Which does not matter if someone buys AHL/ENH for 1-2 year
revert-to-median investment, but matters if they buy for 10 year investment).

consider something like Chubb, CB, which I'm led to believe is one of the

the dividend yield is less than THG. Otoh, CB has a much better record in

No mention in the article regarding exposure to potential outstanding debt land
mines. I do think that they would be impacted by a Euro zone implosion. I also
tend to agree with you that they are so big with many different types of debt
financing deals (who knows what type of derivative hedging they have hidden on
the books) that there could be a potential blow up somewhere. On the flip side,
one would have to assume that managers would have been deleveraging the balance
sheet since the credit freeze up in 2009. The company has raised a lot of cash
according to the article ($91 B).

On any Global recovery, they should benefit. I still may try to nibble at a few
shares if the price drifts down as I have higher priced shares I would like to
harvest for losses. Perhaps any Global Growth stocks are off the table with the
problems in Europe.

My one take away from the article was the list of pretty smart value investors
who now see GE as a "value" buy. However, why do they already own shares in the
company as the stock approaches yearly lows. I would have thought they would be
new buyers.

Agreed, betting on tax loss season does not work in aggregate. it would not
have worked in 2008 (when stocks were running up pretty good after thanksgiving
before they really tanked in early 2009, ti would not have worked in 2009 when
stocks pretty much went straight up , it would not have worked in the 2010
growth scare which started in May and was over in September and I would not
want to make a bet in 2011.

Why should it work to begin with? Those tax loss sellers will probably buy
something else and the market is mostly news driven in the short term. The
European situation will either work out or will get worse. None of these
factors has much to do with tax loss selling, imo.

More value brought to the shareholder through Hess JV.

Oil and gas producer Hess Corp (HES.N) will pay CONSOL Energy (CNX.N) $593
million to form a joint venture and develop CONSOL's properties in the Utica

From the article:"...CONSOL owns about 200,000 acres in the Utica shale, most
of which it bought last year from Dominion Resources (D.N). The new deal with
Hess will give it a pre-tax gain of about $59 million.

The joint venture values the Utica properties at about $6,000 per acre, well
below the prices for the more mature Marcellus and Eagle Ford shales...."

That's a pre tax net gain of $0.26/share but more importantly another vested JV

NS/VLO: I still like refiner VLO. Have just a few shares though. Will add more
if stock will fall on no adverse company news.

These new shale plays seem to be producing lots of oil for US refiners:

http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/07/nustar-valero-eagleford-idUSN1E78618N
0110907?feedType=RSS&feedName=companyNews&rpc=43

"NuStar Energy LP ( http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=NS.N
) said on Tuesday it will modify and construct pipelines to carry Eagle Ford
oil and other crudes to two Valero Energy Corp's (
http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=VLO.N ) Texas refineries,
the latest project to tap the growing southeast Texas crude supply."

Perhaps there may come a day when the bottleneck is the lack of refining
capability. I heard an observer of the industry on Bloomberg say that diesel
prices are going higher in future because there won't be enough diesel refining
capacity, not because of oil scarcity. (I won't like higher diesel prices--- I
have a diesel car.)

Not sure exactly what's going on here, but apparently at least some oil
companies have no interest anymore in holding on to their refineries -- MRO is
splitting out its, and Conoco is selling a couple of theirs. Not surprising
because the margins in refining are generally poor, especially as compared to
the capital intensive and consumptive nature of the business.

Maybe these refinery sales will give the refinery sector some opportunity to
consolidate. Maybe the biggest/strongest/most sophisticated will become even
stronger. In any case, with several integrated companies apparently wanting to
jettison their refinery operations, and the refinery sector itself a very
cyclical, low margin (usually) business -- there doesn't seem to be much
investor interest in it. So of course, it might now be a sector of interest to
contrary investors or value investors. Otoh, maybe I've got it wrong-- refinery
stocks are still up quite a bit from their 12-mo lows.

For now I'll stick with focusing on VLO. (And fwiw, among the lp's I have, I
hold NS)

Sunoco announced yesterday that they are exiting the refining business and I
don't know where it will go from here. All along I have liked it for
management's focused approach to downsizing and liquidating assets, I guess I
looked at it as a liquidation operation but I never thought it will get to
this. I like your approach to target at the lows - I don't know any other way
with the cyclicals. I will be tracking Western Refining as it approaches lows -
mostly for the spread benefits of the article I sent you earlier.

Paul,

A few comments on refining. First, look at the major increase in CAFE mileage
standards coming. It's not real clear how the automakers will achieve this,
whether through more hybrids, more diesel engines, lightweighting, NG-fueled
vehicles, etc. but the net result - even though it will take time - will likely
be less oil being refined.

And unlike Europe, US refineries are set up to produce as much gasoline as
possible instead of diesel. To changeover the refineries would take significant
capex, which would be hard to justify. Especially given IRRs in E&P segment
with crude as high as it is.

May be ok to hold the better refiners but hard to justify adding new funds to
the sector, IMHO. But like you, I've been wrong many, many times before.

re BRK.b - most buys are not relevant since they are smaller buys that may be
more trading buys than LT holdings. I have recently upped BRK to one of my
major holdings - I think it is a cheap insurance stock with an opportunity to
invest with a better return than other insurance companies.

I have read the BRK stockholders letter since 1990, a pretty good exercise. it
shows that while WEB does make mistakes, his battering average is pretty good
and he sure picks good stocks even if he is in the wrong sectors (banks being
one example where i owned or owns PCN, M&T, WFC, USB which all have been way
above average).

I think Wilson is a little bit optimistic with his valuation, using 12x pre tax
earnings. I also criticized his buy of Burlington Nothern in this board (could
have done better) but it turned out that the old man did his homework on his
napkin - since he paid only 30% stock / 70% cash (including the 25% that he
owned already) the BNSF buy turned out to be accreditive to earnings.

Q.E.P. Co., Inc. ( http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/qepc.pk )

QEPC is a manufacturer and seller of a product line of specialty tools and
flooring-related products for home improvement. For the year, the stock has
gained 49.16%. Despite outperforming the market, the stock still remains
undervalued. The reason is that it is relatively illiquid and trades on pink
sheets. Its current business does not appeal to investors looking for exciting
growth industries. The 5-year revenue growth rate appears low at 2.89%, as the
revenues declined during the financial crisis. However, it has managed to post
earnings per share growth of 59% over the same period. The reason is the
company has been buying back shares in the market while keeping their capital
spending at low levels.

The stock is currently trading at 6.21 times trailing earnings, lower than The
L.S. Starrett Company's ( http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/scx ) 17.21 times
earnings and Snap-On, Inc. ( http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/sna ), valued at
12.38 times earnings. It looks like the market is not yet convinced that it
could post modest growth in the coming years. At first glance, investors would
be worried at the performance of the housing market. Despite a sluggish housing
market this year, QEPC has posted revenue growth of 13.60% year on year. With a
market cap of $69.67 million, it would be a good steal for a company looking to
expand its portfolio of home improvement products.

re PEP - the stagflation comment was from the Back to school 9/7 presentation
transcript available on PEP website. it was not the focus of the presentation
and was not even mentioned on the slides. It is still a meaningful comment.

PEP does not look as cheap to me - they now some of their bottlers and have now
~3.2B$ in Capex annually and ~900M$ in interest expense. Cash from Operations
is about 9B$ in 2010. The profits from the bottling units do not cover the
increased interest expenses and Capex unless they can show synergies, which I
think analyst are already projecting in future earning estimates.

However, the bottling unit is more affected by increased inflation of raw
material and energy imo than the core PEP and I believe these synergies not a
sure thing or may be eaten up by increased costs.

Also note that the credit rating was downgrade subsequent the acquisition of
the bottling units. For me, it does not look like PEP is a buy yet, given that
they trade at ~10x EBITDA and that 40% of their cash flow goes into Capex and
interest payments.

Nestle / NSRGY stock really hit the skids recently - down 3% today. i think
this stock may actually get into the buy area here and I would prefer it to PEP
- better (and much less paid) management, better products and similar valuation
when i look at leverage adjusted values - both are at about 10x EBITDA and
Nestle at this point appears less capital intensive than PEP (PEP capex went up
since they took on their US bottling operations).

Just for fun -how exchange rates influence the earnings look at P6-P8 of their
6 month report
http://www.nestle.com/Common/NestleDocuments/Documents/Library/Documents/Half_Y
arly_Reports/2011-Half-Yearly-Report-EN.pdf

Earnings are down 5% in CHF, up ~ 10% in Euro and 20% in US$. It just shows how
much backwind US companies with international ops have, when they publish their
income statements in US$.
Nestle stopped their buybacks recently, which imo makes sense with their shares
now fairly valued. This is actually one of the companies with smart capital
allocations, they used the windfall from Alcon sale to buy back huge amount of
shares from 2007-2010, many at much lower cost than today.

Another thing - they own 30% of L'Oreal the french cosmetic company. worth
about 13B Euro at a very low cost basis (acquired in 1974 for the most part).
This holding is not consolidated and they just cash in dividend checks. My
guess is that at some point when the bettencourt clan want's to sell, Nestle is
going to get a nice chunk of cash from the sale of their stake - i don't
believe they will venture into the cosmetic business.

J.G. Boswell grows and mills cotton in California's San Joaquin Valley. The
secretive company is the country's largest cotton producer. About one-third of
its 150,000 California acres are devoted to cotton. It was once said that the
company produced enough cotton in one year to produce 840,000 pairs of boxer
shorts. Indeed, Boswell's customers include textile makers worldwide. The
company also grows tomatoes and a lot of them. One of the nation's largest
tomato growers, it produced some 1 million pounds of tomatoes in 2008.
Boswell's other smaller crops include wheat, sunflowers, and safflowers.
Chairman emeritus James G. Boswell II died in 2009 at the age of 86.

 Real Estate part 2 
The Pink Sheets: 
Searching For Value In No-Man’s Land 
JG Boswell Company (Ticker:BWEL) 

Ever considered buying real estate exposure on the pink sheets? Me either. I
never really considered buying anything on the pink sheets. That’s as “over the
counter” as over the counter gets. A virtual dumping ground for has-been
companies, right? Not necessarily. My second investment in the wonderful world
of publicly traded real estate was in a tiny pink sheet company that I’d never
heard of (this will be a recurring theme as we explore my real estate
adventures), JG Boswell Co (Ticker: BWEL). Boswell, headquartered in Pasadena,
CA, is primarily a cotton grower, with other agricultural operations, but we’ll
get into that later. 

I found out about this company at the http://www.neworleansconference.com/ , in
November, 2002. I was attending the conference as a presenter, representing the
personal finance magazine I wrote and edited for at the time. (I f you have
never attended this annual conference, I highly recommend it.) I attended
several of the breakout sessions at the conference, and one of the best was
given by Rick Rule, of http://www.globalresourceinvestments.com/

Rule’s presentation highlighted several, unheard of, pink sheet companies,
sitting on undervalued assets. These companies had few shareholders, traded
very infrequently, and all traded at high ($300 and above) stock prices. One of
Rule’s points was that you can find tremendous value in essentially
semi-private pink sheet companies. You just have to do a lot of digging,
because most are not required file financial statements with the SEC (having so
few shareholders), so information is hard to find. Furthermore, trading is
extremely infrequent. 

Among the companies Rule discussed: Crowley Maritime (CWLM, last traded at
$1160), a marine transportation company (they do file with the SEC), Laaco Ltd,
(LAACZ, $534.25) owner of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, California Yacht club,
self storage facilities and other real estate, Farmer’s Merchant Bank of Long
Beach CA (FMBL, $5600) a commercial bank, and, of course Boswell (BWEL, $600). 

I was intrigued most by the JG Boswell story. Here was a semi-private company,
sitting on thousands of acres of California land, some of which had water
sitting under it. Ah, land and water. It does not get any better than that. 

JG Boswell was interesting, but I started my research efforts with one hand
tied behind my back. There simply was little information available. What little
I could find was numerous mentions in newspapers. Then I stumbled upon
http://www.standardinvestment.com/ , a small investment house that specializes
in these situations: semi-private, but asset rich pink sheet companies. There
were several research reports on the site; the one for Boswell was a few years
old, but with that, and a more recent update, I had at least something to add
to Rick Rule’s analysis. 

What I found was a profitable, albeit mysterious little company. The company
founder JG Boswell, being somewhat of a legend. (In fact, there is now a
biography available about him: The King of California: J. G. Boswell and the
Making of a Secret American Empire by Mark Arax, Rick Wartzman, you can find it
on http://www.amazon.com/ .) In any event, based on the mosaic of information I
was able to generate, I purchased a handful of shares in early 2003. The stock
was trading at $300 per share at the time, and based on the extremely low
trading volume (71 shares per day in 2004, for example), I was lucky to get my
hands on any. 

A few months later, I tried to buy more, placing a limit order, but there were
no sellers. In a situation like this you never want to place a market order
because you are liable to get hammered on price. The stock traded sideways for
many months, and I collected the nice 3 plus percent dividend. 

The stock started to move in February 2004, when the company initiated a tender
offer to purchase up to 150,000 shares at $325 per share. I was initially
tempted by the offer, afterall, I had held the shares a year, and the price had
barely moved. I was getting impatient, as a beginner in the world of thinly
traded pink sheet companies. 

The tender offer documentation and financial statements I received in the mail
changed my mind. This was my first look at somewhat recent financial
statements, and the numbers I saw were impressive. 

For instance, in 2003, the company had net revenue of $395 million, and net
income of $35 million, or $36.11 per diluted share. Based on the tender offer
price, that was a P/E of just 9, and a very healthy net profit margin of 8.9
percent. Book Value per share was $343.83 based on stockholders equity of $321
million, and 933,855 shares outstanding. That translated to a price to book
ratio of .94. I know, book values can be misleading, based on the quality (or
lack thereof) of the underlying assets. But that’s where it got better. 

Total land holdings for the company were approximately 172,000 acres, 142,000
in California, and 30,000 in Australia. Current use of the land along with
acreage figures, was as follows: 

California: 
Use Acres 
Pima Cotton 79856 
Tomatoes 17938 
Alfalfa 20109 
Wheat 12101 
Garbanzo Beans 3397 
Other Crops 3703 
Fallow 5000 
Eastlake real estate ? 
development 
Australia: 
Cotton 30000 
Colorado: 
Office park 52 

(As for water, company documents mentioned a supply of groundwater under owned
land, used to water the crops. But there were no specifics about the supply.) 

As I mentioned in my last piece, one metric I like to calculate for companies
with land holdings is Enterprise Value Per Acre. In Boswell’s case, Enterprise
value at the time was calculated as follows: (in millions) 

Market Cap $303.5 
Total Debt $170.8 
Min Int. .6 
Cash(subtract)2.6 

EV: $472.3 million 
Acres: 172 thousand 

EV/Acre: $2745.9 

The above figures were as of the tender offer. It is difficult to calculate the
current EV per acre, because much of the data is not available. However, based
on the doubling of share price, a perceived reduction in shares because of the
tender offer and assuming levels of debt and cash are similar: 

Current EV/Acre: Estimate: $4000-5000 

Boswell is a nice story. Good, profitable operating business perhaps
undervalued land, and a growing dividend ($3.25 per share quarterly, up from $3
last year and $2.75 the year before). The stock most recently traded at $600
per share. The downside to a story like this is the lack of information. The
company is not required to file with the SEC, so even for shareholders,
financial statements are scarce. The only ones I’ve seen since becoming a
shareholder were those pertaining to the tender offer. Still, I’ve doubled my
money, and will continue to hang on to these shares. It’s all about the land
for me…. 

===============================================================================
=====================

This is one that is thinly traded but might be a good AG value candidate if
purchased at the right price. I will put on my watch list and try to gather
more information.

Lots of hidden assets. Wonder if they own the mineral rights to their land.
There might be Oil and NG there too.

Jurgis,

re: GPS. it's just a small position for me. It's never been one of the "top"
ranked retailers, but it was one of the retailers passing through the
MagicFormula rankings and when my wife came back talking about packed stores I
just pulled the trigger. I've had both good an bad luck in the past on
retailers, but I have to take the good w/ bad. When you hit one good it can
make a lot of money given the way retailers trend. I was lucky to miss the
blow-up in ARO this year though. I got stopped out only a month or two before
the huge collapse.

I got to say though, women have an eye for retailers. I'm always asking women
at work where they're shopping, what they like/don't like, which stores, etc.
It's especially helpful in listening for when a store is both turning around
and/or getting stale.

Jurgis,

fwiw, in the insurance biz Chubb has tended to stand out as very well run. I
work for an insurance co (not Chubb) and CB is one of the few that I've
considered investing in given their apparent superior risk management. I've
been very impressed how catastrophes tend to roll off their back, and how they
seemed little impacted by toxic investments that plagued so many insurers.

Paul, I added more to INTC this week, along with a few more shares of AAPL.

I've been in and out of several times.

Put some more cash from work 401K back in to large cap fund both eod yesterday
and eod today.

Overall, stilll alot of cash but probably at less than 50% now.

I looked at VPRT too and I came out with similar opinion. Great past growth -
bruwin type of stock ;) - but it's not clear how long they can keep it up. The
moat seems to be price ("free" - they were sued for advertising free products
that had shipping charges), their optimized fulfillment technology and some
marketing/client capture technology. On the negative side, this is not much of
a moat. It's not like they are Google or even Groupon. When I worked at a
startup and our guys wanted to get promo materials there were other places
available - we did not use Vistaprint although it was mentioned couple times.
They've been accused of email spamming for business although it's possible that
some of the spam messages are phishing attempts impersonating Vistaprint.

In normal market, I'd buy a small position. With so many other bargains
available, I'll skip for now.

Well, I escaped ARO blowup and GPS drop so far, but not some other drops this
year. ;)

Unfortunately, I don't have women/teenager friends to consult about retail.
There was someone I knew who was great - she knew Starbucks before it became
the huge company - but she's no longer in USA.

My wife and me are both outside mainstream in our tastes. Most what we like is
not a crowd magnet. She likes "XXI forever" (Forever 21), but the company is
private. As I mentioned on this thread, she did buy TJX and AHONY this year,
we'll see how that works out ;).

Like VPRT, I'd probably buy GPS here in normal market. But with so many other
opportunities, I'll pass for now.

I've heard great things about CB, it's on my buy list.

What other few you'd invest into in insurance business? Do you think that
buying insurance companies now is still a fool's errand even though they all
seem quite cheap?

Disclosure: I hold positions in AFSI, AXS, BRK, CI, FRFHF, L, RE, RGA now.

AAPL - I almost sold my few shares when Jobs left. I'm sure AAPL has enough
momentum to barge for another 3-5 years, but in that time there will be another
turning event and I'm not sure they will handle it well without Jobs.

INTC is a buy IMHO, but haven't added recently. They haven't fallen much either
though.

MDF - not counting Medicare issues, are you not concerned about lack of
operating cash flow? I guess it's due to Humana receivables, but still it's a
bit disconcerting.
