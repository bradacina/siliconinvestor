Paul, given the size of your portfolio and the number of stocks you hold, it is
difficult to get out performance. As you say, a large fixed income component
may be a drag on performance while other great value selections you have made
come to fruition with large percentage gains. If you want that large cash
component and bond component, it might pay for you to segment your portfolio
into two or three categories like Value stocks, preferred stocks and bonds, and
perhaps growth stocks but you may not have much in the growth stock area. This
might enable you to better monitor performance of the component categories and
enable adjustments in the overall holdings when you see one component severely
under performing others over longer periods. It's just a thought. I can't see
for the life of me wanting to stay with an under performing asset category.
From my perspective whatever makes money is good. I'm focused on growth stocks
which I doubt you would touch and value stocks which we share a few in common.
But I'm likely younger than you and not concerned with fixed income. Slow and
steady wins the race and a well thought out portfolio restructure could enhance
that which would get you back to those 2007 and 2008 levels. I find over
diversification in too many stocks to be more difficult to manage efficiently.
FWIW I also am not back to my portfolios all time highs of Q3 2007. Many I know
are there and beyond that, but have deeply concentrated multi-baggers and less
diversification. We learn as we go thus my intent for 2010 is to get there and
exceed those levels. If it takes some trading rather than holding through thick
and thin it's fine with me. Of late, what's been working for me is buying the
best performing growth stocks on dips. I'm sure you will do what is best suited
for you personally.

Incidentally I'd like your thoughts on HNR risk as it is a little touchy with
the Venezuela situation. Who knows if Chavez and Co. decide to steal the Co.
assets. Municipalities in Venezuela seem to be after them for nominal amounts
in lawsuits but not much. The production of 43% owned Petrodelta is fantastic
though and value of lawsuits against the Co. would hardly impact the Co. in a
material way if they were decided adversely. That said, the entire kit and
caboodle being taken is what I believe has the stock price in question mark
area. Some people probably would say if it's involved in Venezuela I don't want
to touch it. TIA

Paul, thank you for insights and for moderating this forum.

After 2008, I have moved most of my tax-protected assets to bonds (about 20% of
portfolio), but not treasuries rather medium-grade corporates and trust
preferreds with a little higher risk/return to them.

I had always wondered why Benjamin Graham even bothered with bond allocations
since equities historically had provided so much better returns. However, after
losing 30%-40% in 2008 and being stuck in several "roach motel" microcap
stocks, I realized that going all out for return was a mistake for me.

Not only do bonds help smooth out returns, but if I had had that decent chunk
in bonds, I could have had more dry powder to buy dirt-cheap stocks that,
priced for doomsday, I thought were almost certainly going to appreciate
significantly. So with strategic timing I think an allocation to bonds may not
even hurt my total return potential.

That being said, I am fairly certain that interest rates will continue to raise
next year as their is not enough demand for the flood of Treasuries that need
to be issued to support our ever-increasing debt. Also, credit spreads have
really tightened. There is still a little room to tighten more, but it will be
much, much harder to make money in bonds next year. That being said, I will
look to trade around my fixed income portfolio to generate returns and am
comfortable with the yield-to-maturity as a long-term return objective on this
part of my portfolio.

There's a lot to your post, anializer.

I isolate my bond components in a Yahoo list by category called "funds" where
I've categorized all my stocks, such as "aerospace/defense", "food",
"technology", "net-net/cash-rich", "oil/gas", etc.

Most of my bond and cash is held within my major(largest) ira portfolio. My
broker shows these to be categorized as:
"domestic stock" 57%
"foreign stock" 5%
"bonds" 14%
"short term" 12%
"unknown" 7%
"other" 5%

Somehow, I suspect neither of these two categorizations gives me great insight
as to what component is underperforming. As well, we would have a different
perspective on what to do if one of the components were found to be
underperforming: You say you wouldn't want to stay with an underperforming
sector. I'm more likely to add to it. This may be coming from a difference in
our overall goals: you wishing to employ capital efficiently and accumulate
while you are young. Me, being older, the preservation of capital means more to
me -- so I am apparently finding out about myself -- not losing so much of it
means more to me than increasing it. Having some difficulty digesting this
stuff: I ask myself if I didn't spend much of the capital I had accumulated
when it was much, much larger ('07/'08) what is my purpose in trying to build
back up again, if again, the result would be that I won't be spending much, if
any, of the gains. This all leads me to consider holding or adding to
underperforming stocks quite all right for me, not as anathema or unacceptable.

A lot of value stuff turns out to be reversion-to-mean plays for me. So I am
trying to look at underperforming, out-of-favor categories. Two areas might be
hotel reits and homebuilders (although homebuilders have been up past few
days).

Two areas that I am becoming aware of that might be overly in favor, and that I
may have wrongly assumed are out-of-favor, are dividend-paying stocks and
Bakken oil stocks. (Consider the recent popularity of "Dividend investing for
retirement" thread and the erstwhile traders who are now converts and posters.)
For the Bakken, I had believed either shale was not well-known, or the Bakken
was not being singled-out for its special features. I now believe Bakken may
have become all too popular with analysts and others. This very much concerns
me, because apparently and somewhat surprisingly to me, I may actually be in a
crowd, being sucked along and making ever more bets on
distribution/dividend-paying stocks, and Bakken-exposed oil stocks.
=========================
I've checked HNR at your first mention, again now, and from my initial
impression it is one that is out-of-favor all right, but way too risky for me -
the company possibly very much being affected by the whims or policies of the
socialist Chavez and his apparent dictatorship. I pass on it. For me, my big
geopolitical risk oil play is in Iraq. I assume that is my big-bet/big-risk
geopolitical oil play, although of course it could be that any or all of the
big oil discoveries and efforts could suddenly become big nationalization
issues that could surprise and hurt us investors, e.g. Brazil, Ghana, Uganda,
etc.

Sector picking is more important than stock picking. I think that pref stock

around that I'd rather own.

Here's how I classify my investments.
Year end 07, 08, and now:

<pre>

2009 2008 2007
cash 2% 4% 0%
utilities 5% 3% 0%
pref stocks 63% 31% 0%
energy stocks 7% 12% 43%
energy trusts 0% 0% 10%
other stocks 7% 0% 14%
reits 16% 50% 34%

100% 100% 100%

</pre>

Well, I recovered my 2008 losses in 2009. My dollar loss in 2008 = slightly <
dollar gain in 2009. In percentage terms, down 50% in 08, and up 110% this
year. Thanks to all posters on this thread. There was more sanity here than in
the general media. The thread helped me to stay invested last march, when
things were pretty iffy.

And thanks to Paul for his unique efforts.

Thanks for your reply and response. It's all just a few thoughts and I wouldn't
expect you to change much of what you do based on my perception. Many Seniors I
know are living very comfortably and capital preservation means much more to
them than does chasing stock prices higher so I truly get your points.

Given my interests and participation on this board, I would be more inclined to
enjoy seeing a portfolio of only your perceived value stocks since I've seen
many timely buys you've made over the years where you have had the patience to
stay with them with for large percentage gains over time. Many of my defeats
have been related to a lack of patience. If that area of the market could be
isolated by only your picks, I think it worth following. I'd love to track that
kind of a portfolio over time as I do with the 50% Gains thread. I don't weight
the picks since I have no real way of knowing that information on anyone's
portfolio nor would I want to, but a simple list of perceived value stocks
would at least enable one to monitor performance of that segment assuming an
equal dollar value share of each component of a value stock portfolio.
Reversion to the mean plays I assume are considered value stocks at the point
of entry ranges.

Sometimes examining past successes in the value stock area can give one clues
as to the conditions before takeoff and lead one to better judgments about new
entries.

FWIW, this is what I'm banking on with my position in TUES which looks just
awful but in actuality appears extremely undervalued to me.

My perception is that your yahoo categorizations do not include a value
category but rather categorizes the stocks based on the industry they serve. I
assume you find that useful since you took the time to build these yahoo
categorizations. Many here are much more interested in the fixed income portion
of your portfolio and buys as well. It's not my intent to see you change
anything you do. Just kicking around thoughts as usual. Thanks for your time in
sharing and Good fortune going forward.

Anializer, what are some stocks that you are looking at when you say, "Of late,
what's been working for me is buying the best performing growth stocks on
dips."?

I never can get this 'growth stock' thing quite right. Mr. Buffett says there's
no difference to him between a growth stock or value stock. Or so I understand.

When I read value treatises and they distinguish (which they do) between growth
and value, the key distinction seems to be that as a category, growth stocks
are those that have higher p/e's than value stocks.

I'm with some of these old-time value guys who say they have no problem picking
up growth stocks (whatever they are), as long as they can pay a value price for
them.

At this time, I'm not even sure what it is that's growth about growth stocks.
Is it that sales, or earnings, or sales and earnings are growing? If I can find
a financial stock that has growing stated bv, even that is a growth stock to
me.

Below is my growth stock watchlist updated as of yesterday. I update my lists
once a week. None of these have PE-s that you would be fond of. Many have
growth rates in earnings and revenues that you can't help but love. They are
exciting stocks, not for the faint of heart. Performance wise none are down in
the past 6 months except 3 by marginal amounts. 98% of them have gone up
between 15 and 980% in the past 6 months. 92% of them have outperformed the S
and P 500 over the the last 6 months. I hold some of these at present but
mostly I look for entries on dips and trade them. Among current holdings from
these lists are GIVN bought Friday, and ININ, PRX, FCX, FUQI, GIB, CAAS, CAGC,
and SY which I've been with a while. From my perspective SY is one of the best
tech stocks of all time. FCX is one of the best mining Companies of all time.
GIB is huge in terms of revenues and earnings and I like the institutional
interest in it. ININ has good growth rates in earnings of late and nice steady
revenue growth. PRX is my shot at generic drugs with the kicker of some
proprietary formulas. As a rule of thumb I try not to buy them when I feel they
are over extended. Many have just kept going but sticking to a rule about
buying dips rather than chasing has served me better.

Hi Grommit - Re: 2009 Sector Performance

These are the 2009 sector performance numbers from Seeking Alpha: (

The best performing sector in 2009 was Basic Materials.
<pre>

Today 1 yr
Basic Materials (IYM) -0.4% 73.7%
Consumer Services (IYC) -0.3% 37.9%

Telecom (IYZ) 0.9% 29.2%

Health Care (IYH) 0.2% 24.2%
Financial (IYG) -0.5% 21.6%
Utilities (IDU) -0.1% 13.9%
</pre>

Here is a list of my Top 10 Holdings and the Pct from Yr Low performance %
(green= positive return) measured from year low:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=bhp%20aauky.pk%20cvx%20cop%20sfl%20nyb%20e
f%20xom%20pfe%20pbr

AAUKY.pk results were + 318% which YAHOO shows as n/a. My top 10 holdings are
heavy in natural resource stocks 32% (Basic Materials), Energy 50%, Shipping 9%
& Regional Bank 9%.

My biggest accomplishment in 2009 was to increase my overall portfolio income
by acquiring more high paying dividend and preferred stock companies. I am now
generating 2% more yield on the overall portfolio income than I was in 2008 (a
blended rate around 5.5%).

The portfolio value is now about 85% of it's all time high (FY2007) even after
re-balancing positions in mid 2009. I hold about the same amount of cash now as
I had in 2007 & 2008. The bulk of my new money came out of bonds (GNMA) which
still represent 11% of the portfolio.

Some of my best buys in 2009 included building up my AAUKY position when it was
near its lows, picking up some OSK at $4 (but still selling way too low) and
adding several REIT preferred shares to my basket of REIT shares.

I had several looser too and was happy to book my losses and purge them from
the portfolio. There are too many to mention but I was able to utilize the
losses to offset my gains. I should have a small carry over loss for 2010 which
I plan to offset with long term capital gains that will be booked in 2010.

Overall, it's much easier for me to manage my portfolio(s) (currently 75
positions) when the market is slowly trending higher. The huge down drafts in
late 2008 and early 2009 were not much fun.

One of my concerns looking forward are higher interest rates and the
possibility of stag-flation. Both Federal and State taxes will probably be
higher in the years to come so this may pose another twist for capital
preservation.

Thanks for the recommendations and heads up in 2008 and 2009 on the sectors and
stocks you felt were of value. Many have had done quite well for me.

GDL: Yes, an important point. The cash hoard will enable the fund managers to
pounce when they spot these buy-in/arbitrage opportunities.

I don't know if there was or wasn't this much cash/cash equivalents on the
balance sheet in past months or years. If having this much in liquid assets was
routine though, it still wasn't enough to prevent the fund from dropping with
the market lows of 12/'08 or 3/'09.

My advice on DISK is stay away.

the new deal that takes away the debt also effectively dilutes equity by 90%.

They have been trying to sell the library (not ownership but rights to
distribute) for some time. They could have sold it awhile back for some
$3/share or so, but did not, claiming the price was too low. Then the price
dropped over time. Then they had a bump in price when a hokey offer was
presented for something like $2.5, but the buyer could not come up with the
money to close. They they tried to sell it, but could not even after bringing
in a dealmaker co to shop the company, and then made their last deal.

Under the last deal they effectively sold the company at an implied price per
share of some 25 cents. I predict further dilution as the new owner pays itself
stock in lieu of the preferred dividend.

management was delusional.

I suppose if new management is fair and reasonable to minority owners, it may
work out. But I would not bet on it.

Hi Geoffrey - Re: DISK

You are right on the dilution. It seems when I calculated my numbers, I was off
by a factor of 100. The Series C preferred dilutes the common when eventually
issued. 196,702 shares plus the option for the Investor to purchase 71,528 more
shares for a total of 268,230 series C preferred. This converts at 1,000 shares
of common for each series C preferred or just over 268.2 Million common shares.
There are 21.86 M shares outstanding so AFTER the conversion the total common
will be 290 M common. The dilution of the the common will be 92.5%...Ouch!

So essentially, JH Partners (the Investor) is making an $8 million investment
that provides them 25% of the company in new common shares, receive $8 million
face value of the Preferred B shares that pay a 12 1/2 % cumulative dividend
and earn a $1 million transaction fee for putting the deal together.

Every body wins in this deal but the current shareholders. The entrenched
management probably has a pretty good severance packages too. JH partners can
be the real winners if they take an active role in managing the company with
their newly elected board members. It is also unclear who the new Series C
preferred shareholder are (a special group of investors?).

The bottom line is that the company still owns a pretty good asset in their
digital movie library but the current shareholders now only own 7.5% of that
asset.

Increasing receivables are a concern, but management did address it in the
third quarter CC stating that they expect to receive payment on the entire
portion of their receivables. Regardless, the value of the receivables is
almost equal to the enterprise value of the company, so, for me, there is
enough cushion there for me to look at this as a value proposition.
Furthermore, if there was a huge concern for a write-down, I suspect that
investors smarter than me (and there are lots of them out there!!!) would be
shorting the stock. As you can see from the link that short interest this year
has been negligible in relation to the shares outstanding.

http://www.nasdaq.com/aspxcontent/shortinterests.aspx?symbol=HQS&selected=HQS

Potential dilution: Unfortunately that comes with the territory with many
small-cap Chinese equities. The company wants to increase both increase and
vertically integrate production, so capital expenditures will continue. In the
case of CHNG and CHGI. the completion of the secondaries resulted in the stocks
trading higher and currently continue to trade higher, so one could make the
case that the potential dilution--and we should stress potential-- is already
reflected in the company's valuation.

Unemployment is still about 13% here and that does not include the huge number

Home prices are down 60% to 75% or more from the peak. Things were not so grim

Sales are picking up but there is a huge overhead of homes still, especially
condos. Many foreclosures still are in the backlog.

We ran the highest, so we fell the hardest and were first to do so. I think we

Hey Paul,

I'm thinking about this also - what stocks and sectors to allocate to in 2010.

I don't tend to go into sectors when searching for value stocks. That being
said, I definitely did this last year with several hotel reits, but that's
primarily because I'm a business traveler and had interest in that area for its
own sake.

Given that we're up from the lows a good percetage, I'm finding it harder and
harder to find solid values. I would jump on net-net plays with earnings growth
potential. I still have a good portion of my trading portfolio in cef's with a
discount and Reits. Hard to say where the gains are going to be had in 2010. If
we continue to run up to 12k-13k on the Dow somehow, I would begin building
cash, but for now I'm still pretty much fully invested.

Good luck to us all in 2010!

Hi Grommit - I doubled up on my shares of Shaw Group Inc. (SHAW). With the
recent sell off, their forward PE is now around 10 based on the average
analysts estimates well below FLR which now sell at a 13.3 PE.

SHAW's 2008 joint venture w/ Westinghouse Electric Company (a subsidiary of
Toshiba) should contribute to future earnings.

Westinghouse to get share of $20 billion nuclear deal
http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsbur.. .
By The Tribune-Review Tuesday, December 29, 2009

The United Arab Emirates awarded a South Korean consortium a prized $20 billion
deal to build nuclear reactors as the oil-rich Persian Gulf nation races to
meet its booming energy needs.

Korea Electric Power Corp.'s winning bid beat out rival offers. Emirates
Nuclear Energy Corp. valued the deal for four 1,400-megawatt reactors at about
$20 billion — considerably less than some estimates suggested.

The Korean consortium includes Samsung, Hyundai and Doosan Heavy Industries.
Japan's Toshiba Corp. and its Westinghouse subsidiary will also play a role.

One billion dollars is expected to go to Westinghouse, headquartered in
Cranberry. Westinghouse will provide major components, instrumentation and
control equipment, and design technical and engineering support services,
mostly from Westinghouse locations in Western Pennsylvania. 
===============================================================

I like SHAW's per share cash position which is fueled by their large Free Flow
Cash Flow generated from their different "Service" divisions. Also, this
company creates "real" productive U.S. jobs and it is one of only a few
companies in the world where business is outsourced to them from China & India.

If they started to pay a dividend, I might consider as a core portfolio
position. I may consider selling some covered calls on any run above $35. Stock
is selling just below it's 50day MA of $28.50 and is well below its 50week MA
of $36.00/share.

My basket of construction/engineering companies so far include FLR 55% & SHAW
45%. They represent 1.9% of the portfolio. If I can buy at 10 PE or lower I
will up my exposure, These are the companies in my watch list.

FLR & Shaw. For me the look equaly cheaper (or expensive). Shaw's earnings for
this year ending AUgust 2010 are 2.15 or a PE 13.2, versus FLR forward earnings
for the year ending Dec 2010 ar 3.44$ or a PE 13.4. Now if you believe Shaw
estimates 18mon out for the August 2011 year of 2.8$, Shaw looks cheaper.

E_K_S, I think you are ignoring the fact that FLR and Shaws calender years are
7 month apart and forward earnings always look great. if I base the valuation

MikeS97707. www.mysmartrend.com doesn't look like it has anything to do with
value investing (as I understand value investing). Typical of the genre, it has
the usual "I made 100% in a week" type touts.

CMTX stock itself doesn't look like a value buy to me either. Profitable enough
company now, but so many others have better p/bk, p/e, roe... for me, I say why
bother with CMTX.

Jmo, of course.

Okay, I'll try again with a buy of a few shares of Legg Mason.

It fits my requirement for asset manager stocks of having assets under
management (aum) less than 2% of market cap.

Last time, I averaged down as stock dropped, and that was one stock where it
was a disaster for me to do it. Maybe this go-'round I'll have a better chance:
I'm with Nelson Pelz, an activist investor who's been buying shares near
current price.

I purchased LM last Thursday, replaced another asset manager with it in a tax
loss swap. Like the Peltz involvement and AUM metric. LM is spinning better
performance at its funds, particularly its flagship fund with Bill Miller. A
negative is outflows at fixed income.

I too had a long term loss in coswf, and i was on the road. I had a tax issue
to resolve. and a friend told me that if i had a long term gain and a short
term loss for a similar amount they would offset. so I had to sell so i could
offset the long term gain with a long term loss and preserve the short term
loss. right or wrong that was my thinking. Still cant complain about 2010 so
far except for losing the battle of the bulge on the cruise ship. I can see why
some seniors spend a lot of time on cruise boats instead of assisted living
facilities. the food is a lot better and so is the view.

Agreed!

At less than $100/day for room & board, why bother to rent an apartment to live
on land. On board one gets good food, a private room, an ocean view, a maid to
clean and make beds daily, doctor on-board, interesting ports-of-call to visit,
and even cheap funeral arrangements if you instruct the captain to provide a
burial-at-sea. No wonder I see more & more people booking back-to-back cruises
year-round. JMHO

This may be slightly off-topic. I do agree, however, that cruising is a great
VALUE (does that get us back on topic?). And I do have a > 50% gain in CCL
stock over the past year. CCL quit paying dividends but CCL shareholders get
onboard credits on cruises. However, back-to-back cruises year-round? I'd be
auditioning for "The Biggest Loser"! Will they actually provide a

Portfolio Turnover Rate -

Hi Paul - I wondering what your average portfolio turnover rate is. I am
finding it is much harder to sell or peel off shares when a position becomes
fairly valued or over valued. Many times I tend to hold on to the position
especially if I was able to buy in at a good under valued price and the company
continues to perform well and pays a market rate dividend. Some sectors I am
quick to sell out as there is generally a better entry point in the future.

My portfolio turnover rate might be around 6-8 years. I continue to hold a lot
of my integrated oil stocks and natural resource stocks that I have owned and
accumulated over 20 years. I find that a turnaround "Value" proposition might
take a new management 24-36 months to turn around. Therefore, the undervalued
stock could take as long as three years to become full valued again.

During the last bubble crash 2000-2002, I picked up some large positions that I
continue to hold (have peeled off shares over the years) which still may be
undervalued. For example I bought GLW at prices between $5.00/share-$7.50/share
and believe this stock could be worth $32.00/share based on their different
growing business segments.

My question concerns many of my recent buys in the utility sector which I have
accumulated in the last 18 months. I was able to accumulate a pretty large
position in a basket of utility companies with good dividend paying history.
Many are up over 30% from my buy in prices. If I peel off shares and take the
tax bite, I loose the dividend income and more importantly there are not other
investments where I can redeploy the capital that provides me the same
risk/reward profile. Therefore, I am tempted to continue to hold and only peel
off shares as I find other value opportunities.

You have mentioned your strategy of comparing alternative investments and using
the 'relative dividend yield" model (discussed by you on the Dividend
Investment for Retirement thread
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26223193 ). Identifying and
buying great undervalued plays is the easy part for me, but implementing a
selling strategy (all or partial sells) is much more difficult especially when
comparing future alternative investment opportunities.

A long time mentor for me was Sir John Templeton who stated that "...always
take profits when expectations and valuations are high, no matter where the
"herd" may be thundering....". Reduce risk as values rise. Every investor
should be wise enough to take what the market offers him and limit risk while
participating on the upside.

EKS. "Investing": I just wonder if the buying is the science of it and the
selling is the art of it. I've not found a magic bullet for selling, if it
exists.

One thing is, I don't use any mechanical means for selling (whereas I sometimes
do for buys). That is, I don't use trailing stops. I consider these a crutch
for avoiding decision making. And illogical imo for anyone who calls themselves
an investor to be using stops when they make their buys.
=====================
Disappointed my turnover is so much higher than I expected. The ravaging market
of the late '08 through part of '09 led me to make more portfolio changes than
I wanted or expected. My portfolio turnover might be 12-18 months now vs. what
I had expected (33% or 3 years). Portfolios consist of growth and value stocks.
Entering into a value investment, I'm figuring I should/will/must sell if/when
the stock approaches fair/full value. Which often seems to be within 1-2 to 2.5
years. I agree that turnarounds in fortune for some of these companies take
several years, although of course as prospects appear brighter, the stocks
anticipate (sometimes) and move higher (sometimes). For growth stocks, I have
no preset idea of time frame: For a stock like Nestle, for example, I'm
guessing except for dividends, I might not ever make any money from the stock.
(A somewhat disconcerting idea for me.) I'm just figuring it'll keep cranking
out chocolate (and soon pizzas) ,and the stock will just be in the portfolio
when I die. (At a much higher value than at my purchase prices though. -g-)

I'm with you on the utilities (and preferreds). What're the prospects for these
to go higher? Yields have come down. If stocks are sold though, where to place
the proceeds? Talking here about a substantial part of my portfolio, so just
buying a few shares of something else isn't going to do it. I am stuck. Like
you, "I am tempted to continue to hold and only peel off shares as I find other
value opportunities." What helps me hold utes is this: If people are looking to
beat the S&P 500 for a benchmark, well the utilities (utility indexes) have
consistently bested the S&P over the past ten years. (Pretty sure, but I'm
going from memory here, so this should be confirmed.) In other words, in past,
just holding utilities has not been a bad thing to have been doing.

Nice link to Templeton stuff. I'll have to get back to it. Little busy now.

---
As I buy in stages, I also like to sell in stages. Selling 40% of my remaining
shares today of FMX @49.63 (In 11/'04 @ 14-15). P/bk (29), p/sales (11.7), p/e
(20), all very high. Company often rumored to be a takeover candidate. These
kinds of numbers though seem to be, if not shouting, at least signaling a sell.
To me, anyway.

* Record cash balance of $1.6 billion
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Shaw-Reports-First-Quarter-bw-2558963305.html?x=0

From the article:"...New awards for the quarter totaled $1.2 billion, driven
primarily by new awards from the U.S. government in the company’s Environmental
& Infrastructure segment. The company's backlog of unfilled orders at Nov. 30,
2009, was $22.0 billion compared to $14.8 billion for the first quarter of
fiscal year 2009 and $22.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 2009.
Approximately $5.5 billion of the current backlog is expected to be converted
to revenues during the next 12 months..."

================================================================

Better than expected...Stock up 5% after hours.

This report bodes well for all the construction companies including FLR and
JEC.

My portfolio turnover rate has tremendously increased since early 2008. My
average holding period is about 3-5 month. embarrassing really but I benefited
quite a bit from the volatility. Lately it has been detrimental to my return,
buy and hold worked great since the March lows. Overall i found that the
portfolios I have churned the most, performed the best, so i do not really have
an incentive to change my method other than it's a pretty tough way to make
money. Currently I am more than 10% above Y2007 peak levels, if I had not sold
a single share since March 2009, my portfolio would probably 20-30% higher.
C'est la vie.

That said, i do hold stocks that I bought in Y2002/2003 still (Nestle and BMW).
BMW was a dud and did a roundtrip but Nestle has done quite well. I bought some
more Nestle near last years low in both my IRA and taxable and sold of he
taxable position but kept the one in my taxable account. I think about keeping
that one forever.

F.D.A. Plans Safety Check of 3 Drugs for Anemia
http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/business/07fda.html?partner=yahoofinance
From the article:"...The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that it
would review of the safety of the widely used anemia drugs sold by Amgen and
Johnson & Johnson after another clinical trial suggested that high doses of one
of the drugs might cause strokes...."

=================================================================
The stock of AMGN is dropping like a rock, breaking short term support at
$55.80. The 50 week MA at $54.38 may not hold, so I am looking for an entry
point around $53.5. I will watch weekly volume and may take a position if a
lower low is made on lower volume from it's previous (weekly) test 10/27/2009 -
11/02/2009 of 40.2 million shares.

The stock is in value range at 10.2 next year's earnings (analysts estimate FY
2010 $5.15/share) but may not be worth as much if the FDA limits the
distribution of their block buster anemia drug. They more than likely will just
require some additional labeling information.
