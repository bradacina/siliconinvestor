Latest Endeavour Move Should Help to Eliminate Discount
By David J. DesLauriers
02 Nov 2005 at 08:09 AM EST

TORONTO (ResourceInvestor.com) -- Endeavour Mining Capital [TSX:EDV] should be
poised for a move higher over the coming months as the company raises its
profile with investors.

The company is well known in this sector, and EDV or its principals, have been
behind a substantial share of Canada’s biggest resource related deals in the
last few years. In fact, Endeavour has managed an annual compounded Return on
Equity of an astounding 49.4% over the last four years. Alongside that, NAV has
grown by 400%.

Despite the aforementioned, EDV shares change hands today at C$3.80 per share,
or a preposterous 46% discount to NAV in Canadian per share terms. The reason
for this is that Endeavour is a group that, while they clearly have the ability
to promote, and many of their vehicles possess robust valuations, its
principals do not step into the limelight often, preferring rather sensibly to
play the role of &#233;minence grise.

Eliminating the Discount

That is why the recent appointment of Frank Holmes, head of U.S. Global
Investors to the chairmanship of Endeavour is a particularly clever move.
Holmes is well known in the media, and as a purveyor of mutual funds, in fact
has a responsibility to keep a close relationship with the fourth estate.

Indeed, as his bio at the US Global website informs us, “Mr. Holmes has been a
keynote speaker at countless national and international investment conferences
as well as a guest commentator on the financial television networks CNBC, CNNfn
and Bloomberg TV. Mr. Holmes has also been quoted and profiled in many
financial publications such as The Wall Street Journal and the Wall Street
Journal Europe.”

For an unscientific illustration of the relative profiles of Frank Holmes
versus say Frank Giustra, try googling “Frank Holmes and US Global” and then
“Frank Giustra and Endeavour” – the disparity in results is quite meaningful –
the former gets 1.82 million matches, while the latter garners only 430!

Conclusion

Clearly putting these two groups together is a situation where 2 + 2 makes 10.
As the bull market presses on, Endeavour will continue to be in an ideal
position to capitalize on rising metal prices, and increased interest in the
sector, and will have the ability to outperform the various indices. With Frank
Holmes on board, this fact will be fully appreciated by investors.

Higher prices are now in the wind for EDV as awareness spreads and the share
price moves towards the NAV. Those who would be playing juniors and developers
in the sector anyway should consider Endeavour an attractive alternative way to
do the same. For a little extra leverage, investors might take a look at the
warrants [TSX:EDV.wt], which currently trade at C$1.10, are good till November
10th 2008 and have an exercise price of C$5.50 per share.

Continues to be far and away my largest position-I expect to hold this one till
it sells for 2 times book.

15$, indeed, I don't think it should trade above book. in the mean time AIG

risk of real economic losses due to defaults. Rising interest rates may not be

re: "Bought a tiny position in TCLP. Pipeline LP". 

I always have a problem with LP's. I don't know enough about them to have
confidence to take a large position in one or two, and if I take my usual small
position, or worse diversify among a few, I suffer as a US taxpayer with
partnership forms, late issuance of company tax info. (They sometimes come as
booklets and are often issued late in the tax filing season - 3/31 - when it's
hard to get tax-preparer appointments.), and sneers or groans from my tax guy
when he finally sees these things.

So it's just not worth it to me to buy these things.

Not criticizing the company or its selection as a buy. As I say, I'm the one
with the problem.

I think the roll at JAKK is just getting underway so I'm holding on to all of
my shares. No, I don't think the shorts have covered, but then it seems with
the failed to deliver (FTD) issue that the question is if the shorts ever are
going to be required to deliver or cover?

See the Nov. 2 posting here "We Definitely Aren't in Kansas Anymore - Fraud

frightening) on this manner.

PRS - I agree with you n all of those points. However, I do think the market is
overly discounting these issues. Unrealized losses assuming no credit event
will reverse itself at the end of the contract. Relaized losses, on the other
hand, will occur on occassion, but I believe it will be manageable.

You seem to have good company on PRS, muwis123. I notice two value funds have
positions, according to Yahoo info. (which may or may not be currrent):
Excelsior Value and Restructuring and EQ Advisors (Marty Whitman of "safe and
cheap").

If EQ Advisors has worked through what for me are incomprehensible issues of
unrealized/realized, recognized/unrecognized gains/losses, mark-to-market stuff
and in an arcane (and dangerous?) business of credit swaps- and
Whitman/surrogate see the stock as a buy or hold now, then the stock might be
worth riding with them for a small bet.

PRS seems to be another one of those dink Bermuda-based insurance companies
that came public within the last couple of years. Even though these companies
seem to be in different segments of the insurance business, none that I see is
doing well (but I'm not really looking closely).

PRS - Thanks for the info, Paul. It is comforting to know that Marty Whitman

I assume the main reason Primus is domiciled in Bermuda is to avoid paying
taxes in the US. I would not compare PRS to the typical reinsurance co. that
sprouts up after every disaster. The barriers of entry in terms of the amount
of capital and expertise required is much higher in the financial guaranty

Spekulatius and Paul Senior -

You might consider TransCanada Corp.(TRP).
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=1y&s=TRP&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=tclp&c=%5EGSPC
You will notice that both companies (TRP & TCLP) provide natural gas pipeline
services in Canada & US. The dividend for TRP is 3.5% while TCLP is 6.5%.

TRP has had a good run since I bought it early last year. It appears that TCLP
has not participated in the growth that TRP has achieved in the same period.

I wonder if any of the TCLP's assists would be of value to a larger company
like TRP or to a large value investor like W. Buffet (who owns MidAmerican
Energy). TCLP's debt is quite small.

I like both company's natural gas transmission business especially their
exposure in the U.S. (specifically California).

In 2002, W. Buffet's company MidAmerican Energy Holdings purchased Dynegy
Inc.'s Northern Natural Gas Pipeline for $928 million. He also bought the Kern
River gas pipeline at a bargain price from Williams Co.. The Kern River
pipeline is located in CA..

I was excited enough about MKTS to go the company's website to look for
financials. Unfortunately the first sceen for investors tell us that they have
yet to provide financials for 2004 or 2005 and that financials before that
cannot be relied upon. According to the latest 8k the bank agreed to waive
receipt of audited financials until Feb 2006, of course the bank can send
auditors to look at the books whenever they want to. Do you have access to some
financials you are at liberty to share with us Paul? I am also dismayed that
the company had the time to adopt a poison pill in August 2005 but not to get
the financials done. Not enough for me to buy this pig in a poke.

Madharry. My belief is that any stock related to the machine tool business is
dangerous. It's a very competitive sector. Very cyclical, sometimes capital
intensive, and for some companies, unprofitable over the full cycle. It seems
to me that to make money in their stocks you've got to buy them at the right
time in the cycle, and you can't be a ltb&h.

I'm not an expert. My opinion though is FARO is not a value at current price. I
also have an opinion on HURC, a company which some people here may be
following. I say it's more of a sell at current $19 price than a buy, although
the company seems to be doing very well with its new products.

The net is indeed getting more and more dangerous. Static passwords are
becoming a thing of the past. Etrade has is a little device that generates a
random number every minute. To log on to Etrade you have to have three pieces
of information, your account ID, your static password and the random number,
which is appended to your password. Essentially you have a different password
every time you log in. It’s a much more secure way to do business over the net.
Some banks in Europe do something similar. They send each net customer a
scratch off card that has fifty random numbers, each time you login you have to
scratch off the next number. When you get low on numbers the bank sends another
scratch off card. Maybe your broker has something similar.

Cola, for example.

It's amazing the returns on capital Disney can generate with its classic
characters across all mediums.

The value of the intangible assets of Disney make a significant contribution to
the company's intrinsic value - I would contend that they, and their real
estate, are currently not adequately reflected in the company's share price.

Disney's new management, China Park, and the upcoming Chronicles of Narnia
(Disney has a piece) and its associated products could be big plusses for the
company as well.

The news seems good and they are still "on the block" apparently.

....Explorer Gear acknowledges that Sport-Haley has explored, and continues to

portion or all of its stock or assets, which would likely entail a Change of
Control of Sport-Haley and/or assignment of the License Agreement (subject to
Callaway consent) to an Entity other than Explorer Gear or its Affiliates.
Current management of Sport-Haley does not know, and can give no assurances to
Explorer Gear, whether such a sale or Change of Control would have an adverse
effect on the Company’s continued ability to operate, particularly as to sale
of Top-Flite &#212; Apparel.

This will be my last post on EDV.TO unless I get some indication of interest. I
appreciate your indulgence. I got this email from the pr firm representing the
company and it seems quite accurate to me *S*:

Endeavour Mining Capital is a merchant banking company focused on the resource
markets. They have an incredible track record boasting an average 49% ROI in
the last four years of business - consistently beating the indices every year.
The Company pays a modest dividend and is one of the most profitable resource
related companies on the TSX Stock Exchange.

The company marries money and management to mineralization – meaning they fund
aggressive management teams who can source big, lucrative resource assets to
build companies and create value. The first two years of business they focused
on precious metals but have recently been involved in oil, gas, uranium, coal,
and base metals. When you are buying Endeavour you are essentially getting a
position in ground floor opportunities that offer incredible leverage.

Although the Company has a great track record, the market hasn’t appreciated
the Company’s business model with shares trading at an average of 30% discount
to its Net Asset Value and trading at a PE Ratio of less than 4 times since
inception. This is where the opportunity lies.

On Thursday October 27th, 2005 the Company appointed Frank Holmes and U.S.
Global Investors as Chairman and Equity Investment Advisor. Frank Holmes
manages over $2B in the resource markets and the funds shareholders have
benefited from peer leading performance year over year. His ability to time
market cycles brings yet another unique advantage to Endeavour’s business
model. In this market Endeavour should continue beating the indices
substantially.

In the Company’s conference call on Tuesday Frank Holmes felt that the Company
should trade a premium to NAV – not a discount to the books. When asked how
this was going to be accomplished, the answer was simple. He said “Branding the
Company’s superior track record and business model.” The Company now has a
leader with incredible presence in the industry, media and investment community
to let them know how the business model is going to benefit shareholders……Not
to mention respect of the institutions, analysts, fund managers and investors
world wide that could quickly close the large discount to NAV that has
previously plagued the stock.

Conclusion

Endeavour offers big leverage in a bull market and limited downside in a poor
market as their track records says (2004 was a very poor market for precious
metals and they still managed a 26% ROI). Endeavour also has exposure to a
number of companies in a large range of development stages from private deals
to producers giving a good asset mix to the portfolio. The Company trades a
steep discount to NAV which represents an opportunity to buy undervalued
shares. The upside is twofold: 1) Increase in NAV potential in this resource
bull market and 2) the discount to NAV is going to shrink dramatically. With
the new appointment of Frank Holmes, the company has a much wider audience and
good potential for gains.

Do you have any idea whether these purchase are financed through company loans.
If they are not then that would very bullish. Many companies however have
arrangements to induce their high level employees to purchase stock based on
company loans. If the stock decline the company usually forgives or reduced the
loan repayment. win-win for the executive. I was burned once with a CEO of a
canadian company buying lots of stock as the price was tanking. I asked the
investor relations guy point blank if the company was financing the purchases

EDV.to: Been burned at least twice on these investment companies. One British
insurer with substantial financial investments in other small businesses went
bk, the other a Canadian with dot.com type businesses during those days. Now
times and interests are different and so now it seems like I'm looking here at
an investment/holding company with natural resource underpinnings.

The issue - the issue as I believe it anyway (and I could be wrong) - is that
the portfolios consist of non-public companies, so the holding company gets to
determine their valuations.

So, for example, on the balance sheet, investments which cost $57M are valued
at $90M. (And I was under the impression these things should be valued at lower
of cost or market.)

OTOH, the company reports strong realized gains, an affiliation with a big
mutual fund family, and a low p/e. (3??)

I'd like to see some discussion of this stock rather than company puff pieces
on how good they have been as regards roe, etc. (I'm not saying they're not
good, just that for the low p/e I presume there must be another side to the
story, and I wonder what it might be.)

Wallace, funny that you mention MLS. I have indeed followed it closely, as i
though of it highly, as did many analyst. MLS is one of those REIT's that have
become growth investments. Instead of just passively collecting an ever
increasing rent, they have taken on a huge swat of development projects, some
in joint ventures, and some internationally. Apparently MLS' management has
taken on more than they can handle and costs and timeline for those project are
spinning out of control. MLS balance sheet looks very stretched, free cash flow
is very negative. Interest costs are eating up about half the net rents (Rents
minus recoverables). Because of the leverage (around 5B$ in debt, including
preferred stock) MLS' net present value is very dependent on it's cost of
capital, which is bound to increase (because of floating interest loans and a
higher risk perception by lenders). Based on the financials, i do not believe
that they can keep the dividends at the current levels.

Some value could be created by having MLS acquired by a company with a better
credit, which essentially would lower their cost of capital. if they remain
standalone,I believe there are more shoes to drop (Dividend cut / raise
capital), so i am not ready to jump in yet. At some point, i believe you are
correct and MLS could become a very interesting value play, as many of their
properties are high quality.

To answer what I think is your question i believe that private companies they
value their holdings in at cost. public companies they mark to market. I
believe that they assign no value to out of the money warrants unless there is
some market for them. Now although they mark the shares in public companies to
market I am sure that many of them do not trade huge volumes. The profits
probably from both realized and unrealized gains in their portfolio. If they
are marking to market they have to record income somewhere or the books dont

Im almost certain that is not the case here. When I spoke to the CFO some time
ago, I asked about the insider buys but dont think I even asked if they were
loan related like I used to.

First off, the SEC now forbids it. And it used to have to be disclosed in SEC
filings back before it was illegal.
(Of course there were sometimes cases where the loans werent public yet and the
insider buys were. I uncovered a number of those by calling the company. A
number told me point blank they were related to loans or gifts or whatever.
Meanwhile, the public masses think its real open market buying decisions.

With canadian stocks....I dont have a large degree of trust in them anyway.

I just think FSP is good for both the dividend yeild as well as some modest
price appreciation going forward as the street becomes more aware of them.

Its fairly unknown on wall street because of the way they came public without

DAVID, MLS story. I may have mentioned it here beginning in 1998:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=6522215&srchtxt=mills

At some point there was a discussion between Jim Clarke (a key poster here,
esteemed by many, who went on to manage a small-cap mutual fund) and me about
these mall picks. If I recall he liked Chelsea and/or maybe another. His pick
always seemed to do better than mine as regards stock rise.

In the thread's discussion about Buffett and "his" discount-mall buys, it was
the opinion of posters that it was not Buffett who bought, but one of his
surrogates. I believe it was said that this bunch of reit buys was not made by
his key surrogate (Mr. Byrne maybe?), but instead were made by an analyst or
analysts who worked for the man and these picks were not necessarily blessed by
the guy or Mr. Buffett.

I made MLS buys several times when the div. yield rose above 10%. I began
making sales about last November. Shares bought in $20 range were sold near
$60. My last sale was @49 made 10/31/05 after the company made the announcemnt
of its earnings drop and report delay. These few shares were purchased 3/'99
under $18. I'm out of the stock; have no intention of going back in given
current hullabaloo.

---------
Imo, this is an example of where it's not easily or at all foreseen that a
stock will do as well as it did. I assume most people bought because of the
good (high) dividend yield, maybe management's ability maintain or increase
dividends (looks like they did move a little from .50 to .63 per quarter from
when I bought), and the possibility of a cap. gain kicker from profiting in
gains they might see from mgmt's unique business model. That model evolved
during the years I held the stock, and it was never clear to me it was a
sure-fire bet.

For me, this is an example of where holding a large diversified portfolio gives
more chances for having a surprisingly successful pick. Whether or not Chelsea
was or wasn't the better buy, from my perspective it is better to have been in
MLS for a few shares than never to have bought MLS or Chelsea at all. Nice to
have had MLS in a Mom portfolio too - the recurring dividend stream AND the
slow but substantial stock rise.

-------------------
For my own records, I want to now discuss an error or slip I made in my 1998
post above. And that is the use of the word "think". For many years - I believe
as far back as '98 - I have studiously and diligently made a concerted effort
to avoid the use of the words ("I think") in ANY and EVERY of the posts I
write. You will see me write guess, surmise, recall, bet - but I hope NEVER the
th___ word. It's important to me because when one makes a buy, one knows or one
guesses --- if one has to say "th___", then that is a buy that is going to be
very dangerous. Possibly because "th___" results from a combination of study
and emotional responses.

Although I've never posted relating to my odd opinion here, people who've read
my posts - even getting beyond the joke (or serious response-g-) - that they
realized for years that I didn't "think" - my investment style here is that I
want to see decent financial ratios, some history over time - basically a
methodological, almost rote way of investing. The fact that one "thinks" is
not, imo, related to investment success. It's not so imo, that the more one
"thinks" or even the better one "thinks" about stocks, or a stock or a
business, the better one's stock market performance will be. To "think" means
to weigh, to ponder, to dig deep - all good things that give a false sense of
security. Well, all just imo, anyway.

Further to my post 22447 on 7 Nov., the latest state of affairs is :-

AOB :- Up +22.35%
MPAD :- Up +5.62%
RMIG :- Up +0.50%
SCHK :- Down -2.85%
RAVN :- Down -1.77%
ANST :- Down -0.12%

Net result = +23.73%.
I suspect the current fall back of SCHK, RAVN and ANST can probably be
attributed to their relatively high P/E ratios as at 7 Nov. of 33.9, 28.5 and
35.7 respectively. The other three had trailing 12 month P/E's ranging from
12.0 to 23.0.
I believe their current fundamentals are still fine, and good future results,
with above average increases in EPS, could bring those P/E ratios down and
probably make them attractive to informed investors.
I wonder if "50% Gains Investing" has ever spotted AOB ?

of it was posted on this board in this post:

Fwiw, I saw AOB as a below cash play. I sold some in Aug. at $4.14 and $5.65.
At this point, with the stock where it is, I haven't a clue whether they have a
growing business going forward or if the stock is a value buy. I'm holding on
to a few shares, but imo, there's got to be safer and maybe better places to
place new money than in AOB.

I've considered MPAD now again. Price is quite reasonable for the good
performance the company is producing. Dink company that seems to be on a roll
now. As one of the Yahoo headline links indicates, it may not be all that
assured that the contracts/good times will continue. That risk and the fact
it's a microcap .ob company may be why the p/e is low relative to all the other

Thanx for your reply Paul. I occasionally flick through "50% Gains .." monthly
portfolio results to see what others regard as Value stocks. I don't recall
seeing AOB or AOBO recently. I certainly didn't go back to late 2004 as I don't
have that facility to zero in on a date or post number.
Personally I would have thought that a stock that was selling for about $1.20c
six months ago, with good, improving fundamentals, would still have been part
of someone's Value Portfolio, considering that it's now at well over $7.00c.
Pity you jettisoned some at $4.14c and $5.65c. That could have been an extra
77% and 30% gain ! Such are the vagaries of the stock market !
Yes, there could very well be "safer and better places" to put one's money, but
as I said in my original message, these are small cap stocks whose current
fundamentals indicate to me, anyway, that they could be moving ahead. Needless
to say, the risk here could be higher than with well established, larger cap
stocks. IMO the potential for price increase with the likes of AOB should
certainly be greater than with, say, XOM. I can’t imagine one would have seen
XOM go up 77% since August this year !
As long as AOB’s fundamentals remain sound, and other critical fundamental
criteria remain in place, I see no reason why we shouldn’t see an ongoing
improvement in its stock price.
With regard to MPAD, the one aspect about the stock that I didn’t originally
take into account, was it’s generally low traded volume. I’m not usually keen
on stocks that are either tightly held or lightly traded. However, one cannot
deny its price increase of 135% over the last 12 months.
Personally, I try not to put too much store about what’s put out in "headlines"
etcc.., unless those comments are supported, at the very least, by an in-depth,
fundamental analysis of a company’s Financial Statements. The short term price
movements of stocks can quite often be traced to investors basing their buying
or selling decisions on what Market commentators and "Analysts" expound. I
prefer to draw my own conclusions.
Best wishes with your investments.

On Thursday I added to CSCO @17.24 & started INTC @25.10 without great
enthusiasm for either[usually a good omen]...Barrons cover story this week
discusses how a boost in corporate spending might put some wind in the sales of
each as well as MSFT, which I have accumulated a substantial position in
anticipating a boost from new product cycles. I don't expect moonshots from any
of these...just hope I don't get 'mooned' by them, but I do expect that
collectively they will outperform cash & and market modestly.

This is merely anecdotal . i have never owned msft but was intrigued by the
cover story and announcements of new products. I met a women who owns a web
design firm and was interested in how she made decisions as to how to allocate
investment and manpower into writing for new programs etc. so I asked her
whether she was allocating resources to microsofts new product. She quickly
responded that no she allocated nothing to new products by microsoft she used
only open source stuff that she didnt have to pay for so her customers didnt
either. Gave me pause for thought.
