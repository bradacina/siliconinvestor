In terms of returns, probably. In terms of opening a mutual/hedge fund, it's
not so easy.

Looking at his holdings, it looks like he's holding a number of dinky
large-caps (e.g. BRK ;))) that have not performed well recently. I would have
hard time holding 7-10% positions in most of these, not counting BRK.

Hi Paul

RE: Abraxas Petroleum Corp. (AXAS)

Doubled up on my AXAS @ $3.04/share. Was waiting for it to break $3.00 but it
never did so I stepped up today to add to my position.

My E&P Basket of 20 stocks is only off 2% total since inception. I have added
10% to the pot at or near the recent lows. Many of the companies should report
the status of their new wells in Q3 which should add value to my group of
holdings.

FWIW - Started a small position in GSTprA. This pays monthly like the MHRpC and
MHRpB.

Sold my higher cost shares in NYB. Stock just not acting well and with the
GSTprA I can get a higher dividend that is paid monthly and hopefully have a
better capital gain potential.

NYB is no longer a top 10 holding for me. In fact, any move above $16.00/share,
I plan to sell out. My current shares are at a low cost basis (around
$12.00/share). The whole real estate market is impacting these regional banks
even ones like NYB that deals primarily in multi-family units. Any raise in
rates will significantly impact their profitability. Better to be out of the
position than wait to see weak earnings and a possible dividend cut.

re BK @24.68$- I added some again to my significant existing position. The
stock has been a huge disappointment. My guess is that the current issues in
Europe are creating a headwind for the stock that is not justified based on
fundamentals. the issue with thick stock are earnings misses and lack of top
line growth but they are more than reflected in the stock price.

Eventually this will become dividend stock if nothing else. they should easily
be able to distribute 50% of their earnings since they don't need much capital
to grow (if they grow) and their capital ratios look healthier than ever
already.

Rising interest rates would be a big plus since they have a low cost float in
their business that currently is not of much use, since interest rates are so
low.

BK. I added today also. I expect I'll add a little more again if it falls
further. I don't know if there's a margin of safety with the stock, but I view
BK as a very cheap stock that should eventually recover to reflect it's good
business history and prospects.

If BK would earn next year again just a measly 7.5% on its equity (i.e. on its
stated bv), it would produce $2 in earnings. On today's $24.65 stock price,
that'd be a p/e of a little over 12x. Looking at the high and low p/e's of BK
over the past ten years (S&P tear sheet), the low p/e for any of those years
was 11. (In 2009 there were no earnings).

Absent any bad news from the company or any analyst published negative
insights, I just have to believe the stock is near lows, and that it "should"
"eventually" recover. And so I am betting and hoping. BK's a substantial
business (48,000+ employees), and it seems to provide services that don't seem
to be subject to obsolescence (but who knows?).

In the IRA sold my BDNpC (originally purchased 12/08 @ $7.38/share) and moved

activity in "the Cloud" to grow and COR properties should benefit from this.

Gastar Exploration 8.625% Pfd will spin off dividends monthly and should be
safe w/ the cash flow generated from current & future NG wells developed by the
company. Proceeds from their preferred offering will go to help finance acreage
recently acquired in West Virginia.

The GST Preferred also has the potential for capital appreciation (perhaps as
much as 10%) as new wells are brought on line and market NG prices increase.
There is always the possibility of dry holes and/or significant well depletion
(as pointed out in the recent NYT article), The preferred is superior to the
common shares and provides for a "perpetual" accrued dividend w/ a penalty rate
of 10.25% if any payment is deferred 90 days or more.

Looked at GST-A and got a starter position. Interest rate is very nice, and
below par means any call would bring in a capital gain. Obviously the price is
telling you there is a perception the dividends may be suspended. (A warning
comparison could be GKK-A that suspended within a year of issuance, but that
was when the great recession hit).

The cash flow to support the preferred may be in question, but there is a lot
of equity to buffer the preferred. Common goes to -0- before preferred. Worth a
small position in my opinion.

A knowledgeable fellow posted an opinion on Motley Fool and Yahoo boards
regarding CWH, saying cash flow probably would not improve anytime soon and
that the need for refinancing would cause some stress. But he still likes
CWH-D. I have CWH-D and CWH. Sold some CWH to buy the GST-A. Might sell more as
the argument against a long-term hold appears valid.

Hi geoffrey - Hope you have been finding profitable investments in the market.

Re: GSTpA

I am going slowly on this one. It's probably the most speculative in the lot I
own. It could trade lower in the coming weeks & months but I believe they will
be good on their dividend at least for 24 months. I took a quick look at their
balance sheet, Income statement and cash flows and the total interest expense
from this preferred issue only increases expenses by 3%. The cost of capital is
less than if they used their bank line too.

The main thing that will determine the fate of GST and this preferred is with
the NG wells drilled and if they produce in economical volume and/or the
depletion rate of these wells does not fall off a cliff.

You can hedge a sour position by selling the common but the common shares are
already trading near their low.

PVA just announced the results of three NG wells drilled in the Marcellus Shale
Area and the results were not very good. (
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Penn-Virginia-Corporation-bw-3941796272.html?x=0&
v=1 ).

From the article:"...H. Baird Whitehead, President and Chief Executive Officer,
stated, “The Marcellus Shale test wells had initial production rates which fell
short of our expectations. We will monitor longer term production once these
wells are turned into the pipeline and determine if the reserves can support a
development program in this immediate area. As important, we will begin testing
our eastern acreage position during the second half of the year.”..." .

The Marcellus Shale Zone is a large area w/ some of the best NG production
wells IF the acreage is located in the suite spot. GST does have quite a bit of
experience drilling in the area. Their latest acquisition is located in
Marshall County, West Virginia, near where MHR has their properties. The
formation is liquids-rich and produces higher than average BTU per unit making
it more valuable. Gastar expects to begin drilling during the second half of
2011 and has identified as many as 30 locations to be drilled over the next
several years. If they hit productive wells, the preferred should quickly move
up to PAR @ $25.00/share.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am more concerned with the over hang of bad real estate loans. Both the money
center banks and regional community banks could be impacted by these bad loans.
This will also feed into many of the REITs and could impact their recovery.
Therefore, I am trimming down my exposure to this area (ie. selling some NYB
and other REIT preferrds) and have been moving part of the proceeds into Oil &
Gas preferreds.

Of the micro caps you mention, I only own one on the list EKCS. I am thinking
of adding more of my aquaculture company MNHVF but the stock has been quite
weak recently and there may be some bad news pending. I do continue to look at
Ag related companies and want to add some more to my group.

re Pargesa - after they sold their stake in Imerys (NK.PA) to Groupe Bruxelles
(GLBL.BR), Pargesa is now totally redundant from an economical point of view,
since all they own is a stake in GLBL.BR (~52%+). I wonder if Frere or Power
Co, who jointly own Pargesa and hence indirectly control GlBL.BR are just going
to fold the two entities into one.

In my opinion, GLBL.BR would be most likely the surviving entity, which
probably means it's better to hold Pargesa.
Frere already eliminated NAT.BR, so I think there is a plan to clean up the
complex ownership structure and realize some of the discounts in NAV, which may
be good for minority shareholders who ride along.

I don't own either one right now but have been looking at GLBL.BR sub 60 Euro.

Hi rlee -

Re: GSTpA

I believe the reason for the continued down ticks is they continue to sell
shares ATM ("At The Market") and will probably continue until all the excess
shares have been sold. The issue goes ex-dividend July 15th so once it goes
through one dividend cycle, we should have a better view of how much volume
trades each month.

There may be an opportunity to do a dividend capture at or near the ex-dividend
date. I am keeping my position small to start and watching the daily volume.

The MHRpC still trades at a pretty good premium (2.3% over Par). I have 5x more
of this one than any of the others (ie MHRpB, GMXRp & GSTpA).

I have been reducing my exposure to many of my REIT preferreds but still own
FRpK & FRpJ. I would sell more of those but I would have to book a 35% gain and
pay taxes on the net capital gains. The effective yield is 7.625% so for now I
am better off to just hold those. It definitely is a better place to park my
money than my local credit union.

DFTpA is one that Grommit has recommended and yields just under 7.8% (
http://www.quantumonline.com/search.cfm?tickersymbol=DFT-A&sopt=symbol ) but it
is already selling at a premium to PAR so has little chance for capital
appreciation. They operate an REIT that invests in Data Centers around the
world http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=DFT+Profile ). This is a better sector
IMO than the traditional real estate REIT. This is one I am looking at to add
if it ever sells below PAR.

I think the key for all of these preferreds is to diversify into a basket of
them which cover several different sectors. So far, it's been a good place to
hide in a sour market. The difference this time vs 2008/2009 is that rates are
historically low and the next moves are higher. Inflation could also move
higher so one must be nimble to fill your basket of preferreds w/ (1) new
offerings and (2) offerings that are collateralized w/ income producing assets
that grow in an inflationary environment (ie like Oil/NG, minerals, and some
real estate).

Just watch out for the land mines on the way.

both of them disclose that their corporate structure is not strictly legal vs

Overall sales were low-conviction holds cleaned up for cash: ARO, UEPS, DGX,

compensate for that.

Hi Paul -

Re: Devon Energy Corporation (DVN)

The stock meets my Buffet test where LT Debt/Annual Net Income $6.8B/$1.63B =
4.17 s/b <= 4.00. At 4.17 it is w/i acceptable range. At PE around 9 it is
close the the PE of the major integrators which provides a good value.

I like that the company has a profitable and growing Midstream business too.
This generates good cash flow.

I have seen this name come up from time to time in my research of the small E&P
companies. It's provides a good pure play for the onshore shale sector.

I think my eventual exit strategy for my basket of small cap E&P companies will
be to peel off shares and put the proceeds into a company like DVN. DVN should
participate in the growth of the sector but w/o the wild ride you get with the
small caps. However, the 70% drop in price in 2008/2009 would be brutal but it
probably was less than many of these small cap E&P I own now.

The key metric for DVN is they do not carry that much debt based on their
annual earnings. They also control substantial acreage which they can develop.

I will add to my watch list and see if I can build a position once my small cap
E&P companies mature.

DVN: "The key metric for DVN is they do not carry that much debt based on their
annual earnings."

Does seem low, although it would be hard for me to figure exactly what it will
be. They've recently closed on several asset sales. Somebody wrote (I can't
find the source) that with those sales DVN is (for now) close to no net debt.

However the WSJ reported 6/28 that DVN is now upping its cap expenditure by
$1B. "Increasing its spending to between $5.5 billion and $5.9 billion will
allow the company to ramp up drilling in oil fields in which it is well
established and launch programs in several areas in which it has only recently
gained a foothold, executives said in a webcast meeting with analysts."

Paul,

I agree with you - it's much harder to find value picks in this environment.
I've been looking at some European companies, but the current level of the euro
could eliminate a potential margin of safety that might be built in those. If
anything negative were to happen over there I might focus on German stocks that
might be cheaper due to the common currency and overall stigma. European banks
on the other hand are simply non-starter for me - they keep on rolling the
Greek debt. The more you roll in mud, chances are you won't get any cleaner.

Hi Paul -

Re: Portfolio Management -

I noticed you sold a few shares of MHR with a recent purchase made on 6/8/2010.
Do you match your sells with your different Buy lots, use a default method like
FIFO and/or LIFO or use a mixture of tax lot accounting for your trades.

I have always matched my trades to my different Buy/Sell lots. Schwab now
requires all trades made after 12/31/2010 be matched for IRS reporting. If
their default tag is different than what I want, I must call them w/i three
days of my trade to tag the trade appropriately.

In my E&P basket, I have quite a few Buys at higher prices and once I begin to
sell a position, I will need to be aware of the Wash rule. I try to apply the
most efficient tax lot accounting method for my particular transaction.

My tendency is to hold onto my lowest priced shares (at least 1 year and 1 day)
and peel off my higher cost shares booking losses accordingly. However, in
order to book a loss, one must also be aware of the Wash rule.

"...A wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss,
and within 30 days before or after the sale you:

* Buy substantially identical stock or securities
* Acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade,
or
* Acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or
securities which...".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------

I am finding that the "Art Of Selling" is as important as buying. Peeling off
shares, lowering the position cost basis, booking a gain (ST vs LT), reloading
the cash account, minimizing tax liabilities are all important considerations
when selling. It's a never an all of none decision for me as I always scale
into and out of a position.

My largest challenge is monitoring those companies that I want to own but sold
based on current valuation. I maintain a watch list (by sector) of companies
that could be Buys but at lower prices. Sometimes it takes as long as a year
for them to come back to my value price range.

If you have run across one or more strategies that have worked for you, please
advise. I have around 85 positions that I actively follow and manage with about
another 150 on different sector watch lists. I am always adding new candidates
and at times must delete old candidates or I become overwhelmed with all the
possible opportunities.

My best gains have come from extended market declines where I have had ample
cash resources to build my inventory of companies. With the Market up over 5%
in the last week, it feels like I need to book some gains and build up my cash
reserves again.

Yes, EKS, I am also always trying to match. Doing same as you, with max gains
occurring in the same way.

Regarding MHR, as I acquired it I made my initial buys in my main ira. I don't
know why I did that -- possibly because I didn't have enough purchasing power
in my main taxable account. It will turn out to be costly though, because all
the gains (if the stock holds up) on sale will be taxable at my tax rate when
they are taken out of the ira. (My tax rate being higher than a long-term cap.
gain tax rate.)

I recently added to my MHR holdings by buying new shares in a Roth account.
Generally looking for a trade here. As the stock fell, I bought more, and when
the stock popped, I decided to sell some of the shares just in this account for
the quick gain.

I assume Schwab is like my broker as regards these ira/Roth accounts: They
aren't set up to match sells to buys because there's no need: any monies
withdrawn from an ira are going to be taxed at the person's then current tax
rate (regardless of how long the stock's been held), and any monies withdrawn
from a Roth are not taxable (assuming the person's a certain age and had the
account for the requisite number of years).

Occasionally I run afoul of the wash sale rule in the taxable accounts. It
seems like the broker's reporting system catches it and accounts for it.

the trading range over 3 months or so to sell appropriate strike prices for the
strangles. I typically sell strikes that have below 30% chance of being
"in-the-money" at expiration in order to be relatively "safe" (i. e. giving my
a 70% chance of winning) in owning a particular strangle. The goals is to have
the stock price end withing the trading range chosen for the options to expire

Hi Paul Lee -

Re: VSE Corp. (VSEC)

This is a tricky value play and IMO all hinges on if the company can stop the
free fall in their Government business as the DOD continues to downsize their
operations. The stock has fallen over 37% from its highs anticipating the drop
off in future business but analysts still are looking for single digit growth
(4.3%) in 2012 which I believe is still too optimistic.

2009 to 2010 revenues were off 15% to $866M and from 2010 to 2011 were off 31%.
Analysts are looking for their revenues to stabilize at $609M in 2012. SG&A
remains high and has not dropped off in line with future revenues. Although not
as critical in cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts, it will still impact their future
profitability.

The company has made a significant move by buying Wheeler Bros. Inc, a supply
chain management company for $185M (all cash paid over 5 years -
http://investors.vsecorp.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=76383&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=157127
&highlight= ). This allowed them to secure a U.S. Postal Service Repower
Contract that should help stabilize the company's future revenues.

VSE Corporation and Wheeler Bros., Inc. Win US Postal Service Repower Contract
http://my.insideview.com/iv/launchReferredArticle.do?aid=_4822784901&utm_source
IVdirectory&utm_medium=Agents_Article_Titles

The acquisition came at a high price increasing their debt obligations by
5.4X's from around $34M to just over $219M. It appears they got a pretty good
deal paying between 5-7 PE based on future earnings incentives.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------

<u>Is this a Value Buy?</u>

The company sells at a 5 PE which is definitely in value territory. The future
PE is unknown but the analysts consensus is $4.00/share or around a 6 PE. Even
with their new accumulated debt obligations from the Wheeler Bros. acquisition,
LT Debt/ Net Annual Revenues s/b less than 5.

If the company can stabilize their annual revenues at $600M and an industry PE
of 7 is used for valuation, the high end valuation IMO is $28/share
($4.00/share x 7) or about 16% higher from current levels.

I would be more interested in a risk/reward profile of between 30%-50% which
would translates to a stock price of $14/share - $19/share.

The company operates many divisions that can help both the government and
private sector operate more efficiently. They need to broaden their base out of
the DOD and into other areas of the government and even the private sector.

In this fiscal environment, I think there are better areas to invest in. VSE
Corp might be a good candidate if they can stabilize their revenues and broaden
their service offerings to include other Non DOD departments (maybe State &
Local municipalities as an out source service supplier) and/or even provide
selected out source services to the private sector.

It's possible they could even be considered a possible acquisition candidate to
the very large government contractors (ie. LK NOC GD

v7gF;_ylu=X3oDMTEydDA3OGxkBHBvcwMxMQRzZWMDeWZpVGFibGlzdARzbGsDZGV0YWlsZWQ- ) as
these companies need to bring more efficiencies to their operations which VSE

The problem with the Magic formula screen is that it only looks at backward

good cash yield in the past, have a strong business and the stock will come
back (to get into the screen they have to get cheap first).

Now you need to ask yourself, why a stock went down to begin with - in most
cases there will be good reasons. The market pays for future earnings, not the

Personally I use Buffettology formula, which is growth-rate estimation for the

predictable, high-moat companies like KO. I use it more widely and IMHO the
results are good if you don't count Chinese RTOs. ;) But that's not a "study"
and it's not DCF either. ;)

I've done DCF on a number of companies. If you use conservative DCF, most of
companies are not cheap. But I usually don't use DCF as my main valuation
factor. :)

Overall, everything boils down to a margin of safety. If you do conservative
DCF or Buffettology or whatever and you find good companies to be cheap, then
it does not matter if you mispredict a bit. Cheap price is your margin of

My track record estimating growth rates is nothing to rave about. That is why,
i get the best results with stocks where I don't depend on growth, like the
net-net's, or stocks that are very cheap based on current earnings, or stocks
that trade below tangible book with decent earnings (example: insurance
stocks).

Growth investing works best for me, when it's very predictable - example in
case: Nestle (NSRGY) where I can pretty much predict that they can growth in
the high single digits (using a combination of organic growth and acquisitions)
and pay decent dividend on top that, pretty much for the foreseeable future.

OT Pargesa situation. I keep approaching it, and then backing away. Situation
is just too complicated for me. As to my current understanding, GLBR might be
the better buy--or not. Or PRGAF - or not. -g-. Maybe the conclusion is that
PRGAF is undervalued by maybe 18% or somewhat more, and that this discrepancy
might close (PRGAF rise) depending on what controlling shareholders do. Which
would mean my max gain from today's price might be +18%. Or PRGAF stock could
fall depending on which and how the entity survives.

I'm leaning to just closing the position. I don't need Pargesa for Total (I
have TOT shares). And while I like Pernod (which is inside PRGAF) for its
liquor business, I have a few shares of liquor business DEO from the days when

Hi Jurgis -

I forgot OSK bought JLG a favorite of mine. Pretty interesting overview
presentation.
Slide 12 summarizes the "Valuation" Proposition:

Averaged a PE ratio of 12.0 over the past ten years.
A reversion to its historical P/E ratio would result in a return of 64% from
its current forward P/E of 7.3.
Earn $5.50 per share in FCF next year.
A reasonable 10x multiple on FCF would result in a share price of $55.50 or a
return of 114% from current levels.

During the crash of 2008, I picked up shares in the $5.00/share area and later
sold them around $10.00/share. The company still relies a lot on State and
local municipal sales and this sector is broke.

The presentation did provide a pretty good argument that they would still
produce a good cash flow from their parts business. I guess I should have held
on to a few shares as their fair value price is at $55.00/share , 67% higher
from Friday's close.

When you are doing your own DD, I absolutely agree with the above. However,
that has nothing to do with the MF strategy. The beauty of MF is that you don't
have to worry about all that. You regularly buy baskets of stocks that have
been good businesses in the past, are now cheap for what are indeed very good
reasons, and for which you can have confidence that over time most of them will
recover, return to form, and give superior returns. That's been true

Is there a typo? Do you mean "buy that low" or "buy that now"?

If this is a mutual fund account, it would often have in the prospectus
specifically not to invest in stocks below $5 or something like that. I'm not
sure when the investment was made or whether it was for a proprietary account.
Does anyone here know more?

I'm not invested in either, instead what I'm trying to figure out is why
somebody would make that investment. I think of it is similar to EMT - if I
understand why people believe in it, it would be easier for me to find
opportunities and exploit.

Hi Paul -

Any opinion on CSX Corp. (CSX). Company split 3:1 in June and continues to sell
near all time highs. I sold this one way too early and looking at this again,
they appear to still be in value territory.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=CSX+Key+Statistics

I am considering selling my GATX Corp. (GMT) which was a play on oil rail cars
and NG infrastructure equipment & services and putting the proceeds into CSX
which reflects a broader play in coal transport.

I just can not believe how well CSX has performed vs GMT :
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=5y&s=GMT&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=csx

PE is better for CSX at 13 vs 16. CSX has a much better debt profile than GMT.
Their LT Debt/ Annual Net Income is around 5.

I guess I should feel lucky that I can get out of GMT w/ a profit with my
initial buy in 2/2011 at @35.00.

I want to stay in the "energy" transport sector and am looking at Intrastate NG
pipeline(s) and/or rail.

Any other ideas worth considering?

FWIW Union Pacific Corporation (UNP) also looks like a similar value to CNX.
UNP forward PE around 13 and LT Debt/ Annual Net income at 3.9. This one has
the best debt profile of the group.

EKS. Rails and rail supply companies have looked too expensive to me. Stock
prices have kept rising though.
==============
I recently bought an initial few shares of lp SEP; I will consider if I want to
add more.

Agreeded, prices for the rails are trading near their all time highs BUT PE's
and debt remain quite attractive. I now have both CNX and UNP on a watch list
and may look for an entry point at some lower price. The problem I see is once
they begin to sell off, that could signal the possible end to our recovery
(maybe even a double dip recession) and then these rail stocks could get really
cheap.

I looked at SEP and that may be the alternative. The NG being developed from
the different shale regions will have to be transported even if we enter
another recession or slow down. In fact, volumes transported are going to grow
w/ possible exports going to Europe.

Based on the YoY growth in NG transport volumes, I can see why both WMB and ETE
keep bidding up SUG.

I already own WMB and EP but ETE (and/or ETP) may also be a candidate to add.
SEP should benefit too. SEP's NG assets are quite compelling

Have you looked at ETE and or ETP?

Do you still prefer SEP over the rest in the group?

Why going into the pipeline sector now that there is a feeding frenzy. i don't
think that paying 15x EBITDA is a recipe for good performance. If interest
rates go up, this sector is going to get whacked, imo. Every once in a while
pipes can be bought for 8x EBITDA (this was the case in 2002 and then again in
2008). that's when they should be bought, not know.

If anything, i would look for ETE on a pullback. It's the GP for ETP and while
ETP has issues with dilution, more ETP unit just mean a higher cut for the
General partner (ETE), as long as the yield for ETP is high enough to stay
above the 50% GP threshold (below that it will get really ugly for the GP
though).

I don't use fully mechanical approaches to investing. For example the MFS
screen did contain quite a few Chinese RTO over the years. It is easy to make
the MFS top 100 list if you fake the numbers. If enough RTO crowd out other
bargains, it could become really expensive for someone following the
"mechanical" approach.

There are other artifacts that make a stock show up in the MFS even though it
may not be a bargain. I think that those folks preferring mechanical approaches
claim that it takes the emotions out of the investment process. That's true,
but it also takes out sound reasoning sometimes.

Yes, I've looked at ETE/ETP several times since Clownbuck mentioned them in
'08. Unfortunately I never stepped in to buy shares. I guess I just have gone
to other stocks in the sector.

With the pipeline lp's I don't know enough to have an opinion whether one stock
is better than another. I just saw SEP, and it looked okay enough for me for an
add to diversify among the sector, so I started small buys. I also like NS (at
a bit lower prices), but I don't have a good reason behind it.
