Jim:

I will not argue with anybody on this thread who says that a hell of a lot of
investments look very cheap right now. 

At the risk of repeating yourself, which are the ones that might be very cheap
right now? I'm ready for some window-shopping, though I'm still of the Dow at
4500 mindset. Russell 2000 is down from 490 to 360 - when/if it reaches 300
(down 40%) I'll be more of a buyer.

Thanks, Peter

Paul, thanks for your comments.

Molson will benefit from its purchase of 40% of its brewery from Foster's. The
company now has 100% control of Molson breweries.

Molson controls about 50% of the Canadian beer market. They also export beer to
the U.S.through an agreement with Miller. Miller used to own 20% of Molson
Breweries.

Bank of Montreal (BMO ) owns the Harris Bank of Chicago. They get about 50% of
their profits from the U.S.

Currently, 4 of Canada's six major banks are involved in mergers. Bank of
Montreal plans to merge with the Royal Bank.

The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce plans to merge with the Toronto Dominion
Bank..

The mergers are subject to the approval of the Canadian government.

The consensus view is that they will be allowed, but the government will put
restrictions on the number of branch closures and demand that service fees be
frozen for two years etc.

The Canadian government will also allow more foreign banks to compete in
Canada.

Overall the mergers are positive for shareholders.

My favourite banks from an investment point of view are TD and CIBC. They do
trade on the NYSE.

I am still waiting before I jump in. My research reports on the banks are not
completed yet. I will post them when I am finished.

I also value companies relative to their past performance. For example with
Wendy's , It is trading at a low P/E relative to its past P/E ratios. Also it
is trading at a low P/E relative to its growth rate.

MO is a steal. The food division is worth around $25. When you buy MO you are
getting the tobacco operations at a very good discount.

MO may benefit from the emerging market crisis by buying up government run
tobacco companies in these areas. Foreign governments which are desperate for
investment may be willing to sell part or all of their tobacco companies to MO.

Regards

"A lesson of investing - always listen to your wife when she knows more about
what your are investing in than you do."

No. Always listen period.

My wife knows NOTHING about investing. When I told her our portfolio reached a
major high last year, my wife says, "Why don't we cash in and put it in
something safe?". I, being the much wiser and more experienced member of our
partnership, responded with, "What? 6% bonds. You've got to be kidding, we've
been averaging that every two/three weeks." This was just before the Asian
crisis started. Since then we may have lost at that rate.

This is the same woman that wanted to buy Bally back when Atlantic City was
legalizing gambling. Bally had doubled when she said it. I told her that the
price had already gone up and it was too late. Of course, it tripled in the
next six months.

But the worst part, the absolute worst part - SHE REMEMBERS!! It's the 'I told

The purpose of my posts on interest rates is to heighten awareness that
borrowing and discount rates for the kind of companies we look at on this board
may be going up contrary to the highly visible decline in treasury yields.
What you do with this information regarding your own portfolio is your
business. How this piece of information might be used by an investor looking at
a particular situation, would be to look harder at borrowing needs and capital
structure (how highly leveraged) in assessing risk return.
My own moves: I closed out a significant position in high yield bond funds.
I've picked up initial positions in NH, MPP, CD, and AG with the intention of
increasing those positions over the next few months (Although I'm reconsidering

Yeah, it really is a tough day. For people who tie their emotions to the ups
and downs of the market -- and if I'm not careful I can be like that - I would
expect that lots of people are in shock or denial. Possibly that includes me.
Maybe tomorrow we'll see more panic response. JUST GET ME OUT! (-g-) . In '87 I
remember that I just wanted it to be over. But as I recall (not too well), the
market was at 2000 or so, so I figured there could only be 3 or 4 more days of
500 point drops before the market was at 0 and the pain would stop. This time,
we've got a longer way to fall. But I don't think we'll go to 0 now either.

I suppose this thread will be very popular today on SI (and not because I'm
sitting here goosing the number of posts), but because people likely want to
know among the good values available now, where might value investors be
placing money?
Looks like some ideas on CNBC, but I turned the sound off, so I didn't get so
wrapped up in the hype, or excitement, or the overly repeated bad news. For me,
I'm basically following the ideas of one of the guys here who said, in effect,
why look for new things when what we already own and know about is/are down so
much? I've raised some more cash by selling some long term holdings, taking
some capital loss offsets (selling NCR) and buying stocks which are near their
lows which I've been buying before; or buying those which meet some of my basic
bv, rel.price and rel. pe criteria and also have good dividends (at least 3x
the S&P500's).
I'm sorry my bank stocks and pharmaceuticals and health care stocks are down
and down hard. I see no fundamental change in business with them -- maybe the
market multiplier is being lowered because of Asia, Russia, missiles, or
something. I would like to believe I can hold on to these stocks, maybe even
add to positions as market drops further. I call that an emergent strategy
(which could be translated as I hope to heck I don't panic! -g-) This time
'round, I'm not heavily margined, I'm diversified, I've got cash. Now if I just
had brains and guts I'd be okay -g-. Paul

Today was not Russia, missiles, the Fed, overvaluation, or anything else. It

Did anybody happen to notice when the market went into free fall on no news?
About 2:30. Things looked bad, but not disastrous until then. I believe the
market dropped 300 points in the last hour. That is about the time people call
Fidelity and Vanguard to make sure they get today's price and not tomorrow's.
And it seems very clear to me that the little guy was not calling to "buy the

I wouldn't be so sure. It might have been the
fund managers who wanted to get "today's price and
not tomorrow's" on all equities.

I wouldn't try to predict what happens
from here. With due respect, your opinion, mine and
those of dozen Wall Street "experts" are not worth
the electrons used to write them. I know one thing:
I'll buy when my targets are reached and stop buying
when I'm out of cash. After that, I'll go on
vacation. :-))) Or, actually, I'll go to work to get
more cash.

For me, it may be investor's dream come true:
a bear market just when I graduate and get a job
allowing to make larger contributions to my
portfolio. We'll see... ;-)

I stand by my reevaluation points on Buffett stocks.
I would even add BRK to the list.
This is definitely time to wait for quality and buy

James-

I know you sold your St. Joe, but would you mind revisiting it for a moment?
St. Joe is sagging near 20, which is about where it was when Rummell took over.
If it was a good value then, what is different now? Is it that the
"undiscovered asset+catalyst" story has played out and isn't likely to repeat?
Seems to me that we are pretty darned close to where we were a year and a half
ago, both with St. Joe and the market.

St. Joe is a long term asset play, but that has not changed, either.

The only new negative I see is that investors who subscribed to the offering at
$34 are feeling pretty lousy about St. Joe right now. So the pool of interested
investors may be smaller today.

I see St. Joe as a good way to acquire good value and add real estate balance
to a stock-heavy portfolio. With your knowledge of real estate investing in
general and St. Joe in particular, I'd be interested in your current take.

Isn't institutional trading starting at 2:30pm/3:00pm the norm? Maybe you can
tell me if that is true. It's always worked for me - get the best price of the
day at about 3:30pm, when the institutions have finished selling, and before
they start to buy. Doesn't seem to be anything in particular about today. Tell
the truth you institutional guys - we know you don't even get into work before
1pm :)

If I was to try and put todays action in perspective, I say that the little guy
to a some extent buys the Blue Chips (or sells lightly - Dow only about a
percent down), takes profit/sells the more speculative stocks on the Nasdaq.
The institutions come in at 2:30pm and sell absolutely everything.

The Facts about the Current Values

Expect Abby Cohen to be on television on a regular basis relentlessly trying to
convince the world (the middle class that is.the rich have been cashing in for
the last year or so) that stocks are undervalued at present.

Here are the facts on which you should base your investment decisions:

The S&P500 now trades at 25x trailing earnings.

The long term average is 15X earnings.

The average in low inflation environments like we have at present is 18X
earnings.

The average in fully employed economies operating at close to capacity like now
is 12X earnings.

S&P500 reported earnings are lower now than they were in 1997.

S&P500 reported earnings are barely above the 1996 level.

A company by company comparison of businesses with similar prospects now as
they have had in the past (over the last 35 years) indicates that most
businesses are selling at or close to their highest price ever on the relevant
valuation criteria. Some are higher.

In order to believe that stocks as a group are undervalued, it is necessary to
believe that stocks have never been overvalued in the history of the universe.
The only way to come to that conclusion is to believe that risk premiums no
longer apply for business.

At present risk premiums throughout the world are rising on all financial
assets where the measurement is clear. This reflects the fact that
approximately 30% of the globe is in severe recession bordering on worse.
Approximately another 10%-20% of the world is also under very severe currency,
stock market, or economic duress. The rising risk premiums reflect the fact
that there have been substantial losses on many investments throughout the
world that were thought to be part of the now totally discredited "new era" of
permanent and riskless prosperity. They also reflect political uncertainty in
some areas.

The dramatic fall in interest rates on TREASURY securities reflects the
potential significant global deflationary forces that are being unleashed
around the globe at present. In my view, lower interest rates almost always
justify higher equity prices. In this case they do not. They do not reflect
improvements in the fundamentals. They reflect flight to quality and
uncertainty about the seriousness of the potential deflation and credit
contraction that is developing. This is easily verified because interest rates
on all types of paper other than treasuries are rising around the globe. This
includes high quality U.S. corporate bonds.

None of this can tell us where the market will head next or how severe the
ongoing crisis will be. It can tell us where the risks and rewards are for
investment (as opposed to the reckless and unprofessional speculation that has
become fashionable.)

Blue chip stocks remain at unprecedented levels in most cases. In my view the
long term returns from these levels still do not justify the current and long
term risks and rewards. This is especially true with the current unchecked
global financial storm still in progress.

That said, the broader market and many secondary issues have now already
experienced a full fledged disaster. Very many stocks are now trading 40%-50%
or more below their highs. Some are at quite attractive prices. Value investors
of all types should welcome this opportunity and be well positioned to take
advantage of the carnage. The overvaluation and risks that preceded it were
obvious.

In my own portfolio, I am now getting ready to close out a few short positions
that have become very profitable. I will retain some. I am also very close to
starting to ease my way into some of the undervalued positions that are
available. I REPEAT EASE!

OK, so it was not mutual fund shareholders selling, it was fund managers. But
that's the same thing. You're a mutual fund manager with a 2% cash position who
all of a sudden gets 4% of his shares redeemed in a day. He's got to sell. He
can't choose when or whether - the only question is WHAT to sell. And when all
the institutional buyers know what situation he's in...well, you just saw it.

The market will probably bounce tomorrow pretty big at the open (if it doesn't,
then put on your crash helmet), but I will be selling anything I still own that
is not nailed to the ground (i.e. does not have big tax consequences) if they
participate in that rally. This bounce will fail because the psychology has
changed 180 degrees and the big names still have 20 or 30% to fall before value
conscious investors will rescue them.

There was a lighter side today. A joke was going around the Street that this is

Hi Jim. Yep, I shoulda bought this am. (Couldn't get any fills at my prices
this afternoon.) However, that is this afternoon's perspective. With the
volatility we are seeing, the potential of a real false rally now, I might be
able to get what I want tomorrow or the next day. In fact, it might be the old
story for me: If/when the market retests lows, I'll be wailing why didn't I
SELL today at higher prices to free up more cash. And if the market rallies
further, I'll be bemoaning my cowardice in not buying when I had the chance, or
if I did buy, in not buying much, much more.

One thing I find strange is how many authors say you can't buy at the absolute
bottom. I find this very true, but odd, since I keep averaging down on many
stocks (not just in '97-'98 market) and I can NEVER get that absolute bottom.
NEVER once. So I am resigned that I sometimes may have to step up a little. But
still, IMO, there are so many okay, profitable companies with okay ROE, selling
below BV, etc. that there is still a margin of safety with them a bit off their
lows. IMO.

I haven't a clue what's going on. It seems though with this volume and this
volatility, many people or funds are either getting, and taking, a chance to
get out of stocks while the getting is good, while others are saying(and
buying)as they see an opportunity. I would guess, when everyone has a chance to
do what they wanted to do, the market will steady. Maybe.

could not get comfortable with was the following:
1) The antitrust lawsuit in the motorboat engine market
2) I was very disappointed with the disclosure in the public documents. They
did not answer any of my questions, so I took this as a signal not even to
bother calling management. Maybe I'll pick up the phone tomorrow given the
price action since then.

You realize this company, or rather this stock, has an infamous history. It was
one of the "Nifty Fifty" in 1972, when I guess everybody thought every American
would have two bowling alleys in their rec room. The stock lost like 90% of its
value in a year and has been seen as a dog ever since. But obviously the stock

Jim and Paul,

I'll be the alarmist this time. I've been following Mexico, Latin and South
America. You should catch up on the region if you haven't been. It's the next
Asia, Russia. US and European bank and corporate exposure in Russia in
miniscule compared to the exposure in this region.

The main media has been ignoring what's happening there in it's focus on
Russia.

IMO - Today was a bounce only. The next freefall is developing.

Re: FLYT

Any comments on net-nets that look to be about to enter a proxy fight?

This is the company that developed in flight entertainment systems, but decided
to quit while the quitting was good and redeploy its assets (mainly cash) more
effectively. Most recently, they paid $800K for a dry cleaning business with
$1.1M in annual revenues - so perhaps they are effectively deploying their
cash?

This is a company that, according to Yahoo, has $2.45 per share in cash, with a
per share book value of $2.04. When I checked the 10QSB, these numbers seemed
to be more or less current and sensible. The stock sells for 72 cents or so.

If these figures are correct, you'd be buying a dollar of (mostly cash) for 35
cents.

In order for an investment like this to work out, the value of the company's
must be realized.

Recently it appears that an outside group (Ocean Partners) is in the process of
mounting a challenge to present management, contending that management should
be replaced. This group includes the father and brother of the company's CEO.

So it looks like there might be a fight, and it might be unpleasant. Realizing
this, do 35 cent dollars provide enough margin of safety in a case like this?
Does anyone have a better idea as to which side is "right" (if it's possible to
determine this sort of thing), and whether there is a good expectation of this
being resolved in a manner that would justify buying shares at today's price?

re: X. Somebody here mentioned US Steel and its 'high' dividend. Looked back,
couldn't find who.

I looked at X, and there's a lot to like about US Steel at current price
relative to some typical valuation numbers. This makes my investing life
difficult and I hate that -g-.
Our biggest steel company ---getting hit from all sides -- mini mills and every
single Asian producer, and Latin Am. too. X, a commodity producer of the 19th
century. I can't imagine anyone in their right mind buying or recommending this
stock. But I see apparently some brokerage firm is actually saying it's a buy.

Rev's have increased every year since '92 (far as my database goes).
Debt is decreasing, but sh. outstanding increasing.
Looks like in past few years, ROE is running at 20%. (I hadn't a clue-- such a
company can actually earn that good a return?)
Price is down close to book value (Now with steel companies, we KNOW that could
be negative -- maybe 1/5 of bv might be attractive.)
Actually, there's been pretty good reported earnings (And we KNOW with steel
companies, reported earnings are well... just reported earnings)
The dividend has been $1 for several years.

The key for me though is that on a relative dividend basis - a model I use to
determine buy/sell points for large cap/dividend payers -- it looks like the
dividend yield is at the highest point in the past 10 years. Which would mean X
is a VERY good buy now. I just don't believe X is ever a good buy. However,
assuming that the world isn't coming to an end, and that steelworkers don't
decide they deserve to make more money than the President of the USA, and that
X could muddle through, I will probably initiate a very small position and
attempt to hold for 2-3 years.

Allen, these shares that trade as .IR are Installment receipts, which means
that the shares have been partially paid and an additional amount must be paid.
In this case while it trades at a substantial discount to the NAV, when you
anti up another $4 (that is the standard payment, not sure in this specific
case) you are not getting it at the 41% discount to the future NAV. That being
said there are some decent Cdn CEF's trading at 30%+ discounts, and also some
opportunity to buy these IR's when the payment comes due as some people will
dump the shares instead of coughing up the next payment.
Scott

PS: Sorry to be so long winded, but there were a few strange cases where the
installment was due(it is an OBLIGATION), however because of the drop in the
share values the IR had a NEGATIVE value, and people were actually paying money
to dump their shares(Boliden and Akita come to mind)

I think Canadian bond yields will continue to climb(I.E. interest rates will
rise).

The Quebec government will call an election either this fall or next spring.
The market IMHO has not priced in a victory by the ruling separatist party.

Also, the Canadian Government will have refinance a large portion of its bonds
this fall.

I think the dollar will be weak this fall which will put upward pressure on
rates.

The spread on long term bond has traditionally been at least 1% higher than the
U.S. rate. Earlier this summer, Canadian long term rates were below U.S. rates.

I think we will see a more normal spread by winter..

Daniel,

I have an extremely small position in this company. I don't like the idea of
the proxy fight. While I agree the current management hasn't been impressive,
it seems like a proxy fight will only waste the shareholders money, thus
depleting the cash in hand which was the sole reason I bought the stock in the
first place.

If you check on yahoo, somebody has posted details about the background of the
people trying to take over -- not particuarly impressive.

Having said that, I recently changed my sell order from 1 3/8 down to 1. I
don't want to spend too much time or effort on this (I have a very small
position and bought it solely on cash bal of the company vs stock price). I was
interested in seeing if it would work out on a sort of statistical basis vs any
real analysis of company future prospects, etc. Frankly after learning more
about the situation, I don't really want to be associated with it at all, but
will continue holding for a while to see if I can sell out for a slight profit.
And also to gain experience on the theory of buying $1 for .50.

Tip: By now you've probably read the release about trading resumption. This
appears to make EWM the close equivalent of MF except that EWM is trading at
what is probably about a 7% discount to NAV where MF is trading at what appears
to be about a 25% premium to NAV This with EWM @ 2 1/16 & MF @ 3.25 based on
comparing to KLSE which is not perfect but an indication. One would tend th
think that capital controls would flatten Malaysia's economy, but articles
about Korea's experience, Thailand's "business as usual" comments and the KLSE
markets response, a 20% gain, indicates possibly a contrary stance may be in
order. If this move buys them some breathing room, and if trade doesn't dry up,
the fundamentals of this market (GDP per capital, PPP, etc) may reassert. If
things start to worsen, perhaps some compromise might be in order that would
loosen convertibility but still somewhat shield from currency speculation.

ROE and the relatively low stock price... I haven't bought yet - waiting to see
if the market fulfills James' worst nightmares <g>. It appears to be leveling

happens. Not as potentially rewarding as, say, DSWLF but my gut feeling (please

X is less risky. Of course that won't stop me from still going after DSWLF!

Personally I was using X as a barometer for Nucor but it looks like I should
have bought that one a decade ago.

I am very excited about what I am seeing in the market. Not that we're out of
the woods yet, but rather that value is starting to do what it is supposed to
do. For the first time in years, the big stocks are breaking down. Look at GE,
Dell, INTC, MSFT, MRK, - and especially Buffett favorites KO, AXP and G. In
previous downturns these stocks held up remarkably well, despite their insane
valuations - because they "perform". Once they don't "perform" what reason is
there to own them.

Now take a look at dirt cheap value stocks. Case and New Holland looked very
nice this week. Metals stocks like Phelps Dodge and especially Freeport (FCX)
are getting attention. And I could not be happier owning USEC.

This is a change. Are we going to see a shift in market leadership? And what is
going to emerge as the new "place to be". 1) Dirt cheap small caps? 2) Washed
out cyclicals? Or 3) are we seeing the mother of all buying opportunities in
the megacaps? Either of the first two means value investors are going to be
very happy, while if the third happens, I'll bang my head against the wall in
frustration. I know we don't do a lot of macro on this thread - I don't either
- but this is what Wall Street pros will be agonizing over until Tuesday. The
answer as of today is "we don't know" - which scares the hell out of these
guys.

What I am spending my time on this long weekend is AXP, MER and MWD. I don't
understand financial stocks well, even though I used to work for MWD, but I
want to understand them better by Tuesday because I sense there are some
phenomenal buying opportunities in this sector, which is still in free fall.
The time to buy your favorite is probably when Latin America falls apart next
week. The time to pick your horse is now. Right now my horse is MWD, but only
because I know it so well as an employee for 4 years and now a customer. This
company has a franchise if any does, and the stock has been clobbered. Maybe
its still not there, but its time for me to figure out where "there" is. The

I agree Bankers Trust should be looked at at the current price. Good catch. It
certainly looks very cheap. If Latin America blows up next week, it may look
even cheaper. Didn't realize the dividend yield is so high - that sounds really
interesting. My take on Bankers Trust (I have interviewed with them and now am
a customer as an institutional investor). They do a good job on the sellside
research but they are not one of the top five. They do OK in investment
banking, but they are not one of the top five. They are big in asset
management, but once again, not a leader. In my view they are a follower in
every one of their businesses. Amex, Morgan Stanley and Merrill are on my list
because every company in this industry has gotten shelled, but these - and
Goldman (not public...yet?) and Citi - are the franchises in this industry. I
would not call BT a franchise. I think the knock on BT is that even they have a
hard time explaining what they do, and as a result tend to follow trends and
get hurt because they don't quite know what they are. Remember the derivatives
fiasco? That was not a coincidence, and it should make you worry about what
piece of their balance sheet is about to blow up now. There was a big article
in the Wall Street Journal today about the company.

After all that, this far down and with a 6% yield, this could still be a home
run. Maybe what I said is conventional wisdom - I don't know what others are
saying. Keep us posted on what your research tells you.

Interesting analysis of buying too early. But do you never ever buy? Lets look

buy at 80 and each 20 dollar increment downward and then assuming the world
doesnt come to an end you have the opportunity to buy at 3 dollar increments on
the upside to 24 you will see that you will have a slight overall profit even

Dollar cost averaging does not work. It works ONLY if you *know* [God tells you

up". This invented "statistics" has been historically established to be
absolutely wrong.

Average stock goes to zero in less than 25 years. Only very few stocks survive
more than 50 years without bankruptcy. It is very easy to do "academic study"
and pick those stocks that are still around and waste time doing calculations
of hypothetical profits. The reality is, that a severe bear market is usually
accompanied with significant changes in business environment, and those stocks
that appear to be good and solid businesses prior, turn out to be railroads of
tomorrow.

Public utilities were speculative darlings prior to 1930. Go ahead and show me
how much money I could make by dollar cost averaging into them (and remember
that DJUA dumps stocks prior to bankruptcy).

WS: thanks for mentioning your net-net. Dr. Graham has said to invest a number
of them. But IMO, it is SO difficult. Hard anyway for me to get up the energy
to start buying them when they show up; hard to maintain a position in them for
the time required to see a profit.
Not only that, Dr. Graham doesn't ever (that I recall) write that these are
greatly profitable (only that they have a great margin of safety and an
adequate (my word) return).
On this thread, apparently some of the guys have gone to a censoring approach
wherein the net-net must now be 'decent' before an investing commitment is
made. In any case, I'll add your co. to my watch list.

There was one other net-net somebody posted here recently (a Y2K Co, I think)
but I can't find it in checking back twice over the last 75 posts. Anybody have
the post number for it? I'll start a net-net log; then we can see how these
stocks are actually fairing over time.

Your implication is that Graham advocated investing in any net-net he could get
his hands on, so any further research or criteria for quality companies is
somehow "censoring" the list (your word). If its a net-net, add it to your
basket. Time to go back and read Graham again. What he actually said was buy
net-nets which also met several other criteria.
1) Debt/Equity less than 1:1
2) 10 year earnings growth > 7%
3) A dividend yield greater than 2/3 of the AAA bond yield
4) A current ratio greater than 2:1

You won't find anything like this today, so whatever we do is bastardizing
Graham in this market. In the first chapter of the Intelligent Investor, he
tells you exactly what to do in a market like this - be at least 75% in bonds.

I fully acknowledge that my Graham picks would not have passed these tests.
Graham probably would not have advocated buying Penobscot Shoe or Hyde, because
he would have been out of the market. (Who knows, if he were still alive today
he may have been so old and senile he would own Amazon.) Nothing in the U.S.
would now, though I bet you could find more than a few in Japan. But let's make
sure we all understand what Graham actually wrote before we start debating how
to apply it today.

And also recognize that these criteria are purist Graham circa 1935, when half
the market probably traded at net-net valuations. Even he gradually relaxed his
methodology over the years.

I find it very productive to break out my Graham books, my Buffett annuals, and
my Lynch books every so often and refresh my own methodology, which is
essentially a combination of the three. I've got my copies so underlined and
scribbled on that I can find the meat in them very quickly. I start developing
bad habits, and like to go back and see what I have forgotten. Often when I go
back to the basics I realize I have been straying from where I want to be.

Jim, I've gone back to my '73 ed. of "The Intelligent Investor" and pulled out
a '76 analyst interview with him. I just don't see where he explicitly gives
those requirements you list to be required for net-nets. I see where there are
such requirements as you say in his "Rules for the Common-Stock Component" for
the "Defensive Investor".

But from what I can tell, Dr. Graham actually talks about Net-Current-Asset
Issues (under Enterprising Investor: A Summary of the Graham-Newman Methods)
as: "The idea here was to acquire as many issues as possible at a cost for each
of less than their book value in terms of net-current-assets alone...In most
cases we carried a wide diversification here-at least 100 different issues."
There's no reference or indication that other requirements (div. yield,
earnings growth, etc.) were or are necessary.

Also in a section called "Bargain Issues, or Net-Current-Asset Stocks", once
again there is no discussion of these other requirements such as size, div.
yield, earnings. "... It always seemed, and still seems, ridiculously simple to
say that if one can acquire a diversified group of common stocks at a price
less than the applicable net current assets alone- after deducting all prior
claims, and counting as 'zero' the fixed and other assets- the results should
be quite satisfactory. They were so, in our experience, for more than 30
years..."
There's a chart of some net-nets on the next page. They show companies in 1970
with dividends and positive earnings. Dr. Graham states about this chart and
net-nets (paraphrase): "There were 50 or so net-nets at this time -1970-and if
we eliminated those that had reported net losses, we would still be left with
enough issues to make up a diversified list." (But even with this statement, it
is still not clear to me that Dr. Graham is actually recommending that
companies with losses be excluded or that he excludes them from his portfolios,
or that there are other criteria for inclusion/exclusion.)

If Dr. Graham actually said to buy net-nets and that they also had to meet
several other criteria, it is very oblique to me. (This would be based on my
'73-76 ref. materials.) I'm still assuming that buying a diversified package of
net-nets is all that is necessary and sufficient to play this game.

Perhaps though, I am playing a 1976 game in 1998. That might not be such a good
idea -g-. Paul

Maybe I got that out of his original work in the 1930s, which was clearly a
very different market. Or maybe you're right and I just combined two sets of
Graham rules which weren't meant to be combined. But thanks for breaking out
the actual text and calling me on it. When I wrote that last night I couldn't
cite anything because my copy is in my office. The bottom line is this - if
buying every single net-net is profitable, then doing a little more homework
and weeding out the garbage should be more profitable. You're right - its not
purist Graham, but I'm not trying to do purist Graham (for instance, the extra
Graham rules I posted above are not necessarily what I use to choose net-nets.
Though I do like to see a dividend and I do like to see earnings.)

RE SFC

Darth, I've been painfully watching this one plunge in the past month or so,
It's one of my holdings. One thing to note, ICII (Imperial credit) has a big
stake in SFC and traded down on extremely heavy volume recently, so I'm
thinking it's possible the big boys know that the buyout talks for SFC are not
going so well.

Long SFC, but am really in the dark as to what's happening. The PE's on the
subprime's are always screwed up relative to the market because of unusual
mandated accounting by SEC, but PE of 3 is really low even for this group. We
have a ton of shorts in this stock also, so this must be considered in the
stock's price movement also.

I guess I'm still in because SFC is still making profitable loans despite a
cash crunch, and a bigger bank with better cashflow should be able to make alot
of money off these loans in a buyout.

Long SFC, but somewhat confused.

Again, I like this stock and will likely continue to add to my position.
Despite my (rather weak) conviction to stop buying poor Rel Strgth stocks -
this is another one that's in the dumps but somehow I just can't resist these
things. IMO, NITE should benefit from the macro trend toward increased trading
via self-directed internet accounts. IMO this trend itself should continue to
push trading velocity higher in the years to come.

I would appreciate comments. Everything I've been picking recently is loosing
money, and I'm counting on this stock to reverse the trend.

MTY - possibly the "ultimate" value situation....

For the last several days, MTY has been in a forced sell-off as the result of
margin calls which a major investor was unable to meet. This sell-off is now
over and the stock has begun to rebound.

Shortly before 1:00 PM yesterday a block of 147,500 shares of MTY changed hands
at $2.75 in a pre-negotiated trade - the liquidation of the last of a
substantial block of the Company's stock which had been overhanging the market.
Immediately after, the bid size dropped to normal levels and the stock began to
move upward. More information can be found at

re: financial stocks
they continue to drop like stones. virtually all of the large cap financials
broke through major support levels today. I know I was the one who brought up
MWD and MER and AXP, but I confess I just cannot figure out how to value them.
As Buffett would say, these are outside my circle of competence, even though I
work in the industry. I just don't understand the accounting. They may be
cheap, they may not. I look to others to teach me what to do with these if they
continue to drop.

I am much more comfortable with things I understand which also look like good
long-term buy points. Nike in the low 30s looks great for the long-term, though
it could certainly go lower. PPG is worth a long look. I still like a couple
real estate sleepers - Clayton Homes (CMH) below 16 and Public Storage (PSA) in
the low 20s. If you want to venture into smaller cap stocks, LaSalle Hotels is
a perfectly healthy REIT with honest management yielding over 12%. And USEC,
which we all know well, has performed very well considering the market's
collapse. It is still one of the first stocks I would buy if I didn't already
own it. Case (CSE) dropped another 4 points today and looks like a screaming
buy if your horizon is 5 years or more.

And on the macro side, I still think the market has another 20-30% downside
before it is reasonably valued. 5700 on the Dow, in other words. In early July
when people in my family were asking "come on, how much could I lose, 10%? Big
deal" I said no, more like half, and they laughed. They're not laughing any
more. The market at today's level still prices in a long term return on equity
of 17%. If you are comfortable with that, I've got some Dutch tulips to sell
you at a 20% discount.

I hadn't quantified my analysis until now, but I've been thinking "40% downside
risk" for at least a year now. Anybody reading my posts and seeing the kind of
stuff I've been recommending knows that I have been trying to avoid stuff that
is market sensitive, and that about 6 months ago, I decided to
opportunistically liquidate. I was wrong that the REITs would be safe, so in
July I threw in the towel and took losses on most of those too.

What am I saying now? Be very very careful. What I am not saying is "wait for
things to clear up and look good again". If that were to happen, you've missed
the recovery. What I am waiting for is a climactic sell-off that takes large
cap stocks down to objectively reasonable levels. That means another 20% on the
big stocks, taking the Dow down to the 6000 range. Maybe the smaller and beaten
up stocks hold up OK in that phase because they are already cheap. But I'm not
going to kid myself into thinking that value stocks are going to go up - they
may outperform, but they won't go up, except in very special cases - until GE
trades below 60.

Yeah, I'm a bear. I think I was saying pretty much the same thing at the peak,
so its not fear if that was your implication.

"Implication" sounds so contentious, but yes, that was my question. One

Jim,

There's a factor you have to consider when estimating where the Dow will go.

We've had it pushed up by the inflow of Asian monies. Now we have Soviet block
and Latin and South American markets collapsing. Bond rates are too low for a
decent return.

The 'safe' stocks are considered to be the DOW stocks.

While I will consider it to be overpriced based on growth projections, I 'feel'
we'll see resistance around 7000 because there's no other place for investors
to put their money. For this same reason, I also think we'll see a better
balance between the large and small caps.

JMHO,
Ron

Resistance around 7000 - by this, Ron, I presume you mean support, buying
demand that would make it unlikely that share prices would go lower. Resistance
generally refers to selling that prevents further extention of an uptrend. 7000
was low touched in last years Oct drop. Below that, 6400 provided support in
Apr. 97 selloff.
<<Bond rates are too low for a decent return>>
Treasuries - Nominal rates look very low based on our recent historical frame
of reference, but look at real rates (3.4 based on CPI or 4.3 based on GDP
deflator) or go back prior to the inflationary surge in the seventies and these
rates aren't so unattractive.
Corporates & high yield: This flight to quality has served up some attractive
yields that will be worth a look as things settle down.
There are many places that are very attractive for investment outside the
Dow..trouble is the trends indicate they're gonna get even more attractive
short term. The Dow and S & P have ridden the indexing trend which IMO is about
to reverse leading to my complete agreement with you that there will be better
balance between large and small caps...as the returns for the former decline
relative to the returns of the latter.

Bob,

Not being familiar with tech terms, I may have used the word 'resistance' wrong
as it relates to the market.

To clarify my statement, IMO investors have been used to the growth of recent
years and will strive for a better return than most bonds rates offer. The
funds would have to outperform bonds to keep investors. While the foreign
markets may now offer some opportunity, most investors are tentative about
investing anyplace but the US, even foreign investors. All of this will prevent
the US markets, particularly the DOW, from reaching levels commensurate with
corporate earning projections.

With the lower US markets, there will be a shift back to foreign markets as the
value oriented investors look for growth. The heavy losses suffered by the
hedge funds and new restrictions placed on trading by the emerging markets to
prevent market manipulation will produce markets that are fairly priced as to
risk and value.

There are benefits to the current world situation. The emerging markets have
learned caution. Companies that have been benefiting from the strong growth and
high earnings will learn that it's possible to expand beyond consumer demand.
Banks and management will learn the importance of liquidity on the balance
sheets. The list goes on, but you see what I'm driving at. This period will
weed out the poorly managed companies from the well managed and the next growth
phase will be stronger and more stable than what we've been seeing.

Ron

I still see what I believe are lots of good values in real businesses. This
week should have been - IMO of course- a time to reassess, a time to add to
positions in good stocks, and a time to sell out of positions where one's fear
exceeded one's confidence. That's what I've been doing.
My tactic has always been to try to buy undervalued stocks when I realize they
are undervalued (to my mind anyway -g-). Assuming that the market is on a
downtrend, and that good, cheap stocks will only get cheaper, my experience is
that it is better for me to lag into positions as the stocks I follow decline,
than to try to time a bottom, or to wait for a good exogenous event (e.g. lower
interest rates) to occur. Actually, I'm kind of used to it, since it seems like
the stocks I buy all decline after I buy them, even in a general bull market. I
don't like this, but I accept it and try to deal with it -g-. JMO, Paul Senior

The big problem with this thinking is that 1,000 of Forbes 1,000 individuals

20% on equities, then even if 10,000,000 "average investors" spend their last

difference:

10,000,000 "average investors" * $100,000 of spare yet uninvested cash = grand

Estimate of assets of very rich people is about right, as is easy to check. The
estimate of "uninvested cash" is too high, as I said in the original post.

My main point is that often people tend to equate results of market actions of
a Soros, and "an average investor", but it would take several hundred thousand
average investors to have same effect on market as one Soros. And this number
[several hundred thousand average investors] is likely an underestimate on a
short time scale, as Soros is likely to use leverage, and to go from 100% long
to 100% short, or something like that, which is not likely at all for the mass
of "average investors".
