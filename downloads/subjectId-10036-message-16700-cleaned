HRC: I suspect many of the potential red flags seen in the statements were
'splained away' in the MDA & footnotes with explanations that sounded
plausible, though perhaps convoluted. There are probably other companies with
similar potential red flags that will never blow up like HRC. Unlike Enron, I
haven't seen much in the way of 'Shoulda, coulda, woulda...seen the troubles,
if only you'd...' type articles indicating how investors could have foreseen
this blow up. No 'Jim Chanos' type guys were offering short analysis before the
bomb dropped as they were with Enron.
A key element of not being burned by this sort of thing is not only to go thru
the statements carefully, which I confess I didn't do until after the
fact...but also to 'raise the bar' of sensitivity to these red flags. For
contrarian, deep-value, 'I want to buy it cheap' folks like most of us, that's
tough to do. To get the low price, we have to look at negative issues and
accept some of them...The ones that appear to be temporary, unconfirmed,
unlikely or overblown, and buy despite those negative issues. We're looking for
troubles that are more than discounted in the price. So increasing sensitivity
to red flags, assuming a whiff of smoke means 'FIRE!' kinda goes against the
grain and filters out many winners as well as losers.
Further complicating the issue: this is a moving target. We're going from a
very permissive environment to a very sensitive, risk averse one. Where
previously corporate miscreants could get away with some pretty outrageous
stuff, now regulators, investors, financial journalists & credit raters don't
let stuff slide. Auditors see Arthur Anderson as a warning not to stray. HRC
got caught when they tried to hide past sins in a bigger charge for a
reimbursement change...to get the books back in line with reality. Many
companies and auditors are facing similar, if not as dire, circumstances. How
to transition to cleaner books without getting crushed or convicted. So we've
past the time when one could safely ignore impropriety's and red flags - the
bubble years, and up ahead will be a period where transgressions will be far
more rare - where smoke doesn't imply FIRE! because the scrutiny and penalties
will be more certain. But during this dangerous transition period, where sins
of the past have not fully come to light, heightened sensitivity to red flags
seems to be in order.

I don't think that BK is out of the question for MO at all. The continuing
litigation, and the bond provision in this case are real. And there may be more
setbacks. While tobacco has percerved on appeal, the bond iss ue is a
treacherous wrinkle. wasn't that whyTexaco filed BK years ago?
The amazing thing is that the states are depending on tobacco money to fund
their budgets, they have sold tobacco revenue bonds to get the money up front.
States and fed have raised tobacco taxes to the point where its real expensive
to buy a pack of smokes. this is leading to smokers finding ways of cutting
cost of smoking: off-brands, internet, native american sales, etc. so thehigher
tobacco taxes are, the more dependent the states are on these taxes, the more
this revenue is likely to slip.
MO's warning that they may not be able to make their payments is more than
posturing. i personally see no reason to invest in MO or RJR, at this point.
UST maybe, but why buy the risks? The reward aren't likely to be there.

Larry,

I agree that there's no way the Federal or state governments will allow tobacco
companies to go BK. They simply are too much of an easy money supply (believe
me, the government benefits more financially on the short term than tobacco
companies from the addictive nature of tobacco).

Also, while it may appear that other tobacco companies are in as much trouble
as MO, it's not true. RJR has a much stronger and robust balance sheet than MO,
pays a higher dividend, and relies less on tobacco sales.

In the early part of this century, the government learned the hard way that you
can't stop people from drinking and that it's better off taxing the hell out of
alcohol rather than prohibiting of hindering it. The same is true for tobacco.

As an aside, alcohol is as dangerous as tobacco. What's next, suits against
beer producers???

Bob, on HRC, I look at it differently. Most people do not have the skills to
analyze the filings in the detail needed to find anything. I think HRC had two
red flags:

-Excessive leverage. Debt to tangible book value was something like 3 to 1.
Whenever you are at the mercy of government reimbursement for your survival,
good will becomes very suspect - as it can instantly become worthless.

-The CEO has been considered somewhat controversial for a long time. I think
management should always be your number one investment criterion, to the extent
you can make a determination - and you should run the other way if any doubts

Bob Rudd, imo you raise some good points regarding investing in value stocks.
So many times value opportunities or traps appear with companies in the throes
of problems.

Apparently each value investor has to determine for himself/herself how to deal
with this. Perhaps "raising the bar" or studying financials to eliminate
potential catastrophes is one way. Or (and) if after purchase, heightened
awareness and a quick exit if there's an appearance of red flags (massive
insider selling, unexpected accounting issues or questions regarding
management, etc.). The thread has severeal times talked about the pros and cons
of setting sell stop orders 10-20% below purchase price.

I need to do some more reflecting in this whole area; some of my assumptions
might be faulty. I am willing to accept ownership of a couple of disasters (I
seem to have every one that comes along though!) if that means I also purchase
similar problematic stocks which rise in values as their companies resolve the
issues that had dropped the stock price. I assume that the winners will gain
more than the losers lose. That's been hard to see or justify for me in this
current market, where so many stocks have come down near lows and seem to be
staying there (or dropping further).

Just to refresh my understanding of previous discussions here regarding
"net-nets", I went back to review my Graham materials.

My conclusion: ALVR fits the strict definition of 'net- net'. But it is very
iffy if Graham would call ALVR a net-net play. Because every one of Grahams
net-net examples is with companies that are profitable (ALVR is not
profitable.) His writings (that I see) don't explicitly say the companies have
to be profitable, but to me now (and to some others on this thread, I believe),
it's presumed that profitability might be a requirement.

Jeffrey: Good points all. High debt is almost always a concomitant of corporate
disaster - magnifying the impact of problems. Hidden covenants produce credit
cliff conditions such that multilevel downgrades are triggered by events that
wouldn't otherwise be life threatening. I warned about the potential for
regulators to torpedo the business model less than a year ago by unfavorably
impacting medicare reimbursement...although it appears that the impact of
changes was less than reported in order to hide past sins.
As to management issues, this has definitely moved up several notches on my
priority list...especially since auditors seem incapable of detecting and
revealing bad practices until after the chickens have be stolen, plucked and
eaten.
I'm looking forward to a $Billion judgement on Ernst from this even knowing
shareholders probably won't get significant benefit. It's only by suffering
harsh penalties that auditors will view the risk reward of uncovering and
revealing problems in a more shareholder friendly manor. Juries almost always

I'll try a small starter position in VVTV now.

Reasonable 1.2x book, no long-term debt per Yahoo, increasing sales, reasonable
p/sales. (All imo)

I see a Marty Whitman fund may have a small position.

A plus and and a minus are that GE owns quite a bit of VVTV. They use VVTV for
the ShopNBC it provides.

This would be my second foray into VVTV. I purchased this stock somewhere
around 1998 when its TV stations alone seemed to me to be worth more than the
stock was selling for. The company was in turmoil when it later sold some
assets: it had weak management, and there were big concerns by stockholders how
management might fritter away corporate assets. I sold my stock for a double or
better after it rose on positive expectations. Those expectations turned out to
be correct, and sorry to say, the stock moved without me from under $10 to
about $60 within 12 months. The stock's now at about $10.

Again I don't foresee any similar rise -- those kinds of quick moves are very
rare -- but I'll wager the stock has a shot to again (in the next 18 months)
see $20/sh (a level it reached in '00, '01, and '02).

Well......

They're actually a mish-mash of sources. Some were indeed from screens. Some

I crunched the numbers based on Yahoo's Financials for the last 4 quarters
available.

Except for the ones I own, I have not looked at the Edgar filings for any of
them.

While I am sensitive to debt loads for my own investments, a high ratio alone
won't keep me away from an issue. Some companies actually do produce more than
their cost of capital (Really, it could happen :~}).

So, to summarize, these are from a variety of sources, they have survived many
of my preliminary "smell" tests, but only quantitatively. Qualitative review
would be necessary for me to invest in any of them.

An immediate issue with ANDW is its acquisition of ALN. ALN did not have high
ROE for the last 7 (!) years and it will account for 1/3 of ANDW's new revenue.
Consequently, if ANDW does not improve ALN's ROE, ANDW may have its own peak
ROE reduced by as much as 1/3. Of course, ANDW suggests the usual merger
benefits, however, such a large percentage-wise acquisition is always wrought
with peril of culture clashes, executive infighting and nasty surprises. On the
other hand, if the acquisition falls through, ANDW would have spent time and
resources on the failure.

ANDW still looks interesting, but I would lower my potential buy price because
of uncertainty and the need to understand 2 companies instead of 1.

MONDAY, MARCH 31, 2003

AN INTERVIEW WITH ROBERT CHAPMAN JR. -- He's an investor first and foremost but
he's best known as a colorful agitator crusading for the rights of shareholders
through his El Segundo, Calif.-based Chapman Capital. With $100 million under
management, Chapman has delivered impressive returns to his clients through a
long-short fund that also focuses on turn-around situations and takeovers.
Since going it alone and launching the fund in May 1996, he has put up returns
of 20% a year on average, after fees:

"One of the safest ways to play the turnaround in the telecom-equipment space,
which has been decimated, is through what we call "cash-discount" plays, or
what Graham and Dodd referred to as "net-nets." One of our biggest positions is
a company called Alvarion. It trades at just under $2 a share, which is a 35%
discount to cash on the balance sheet of about $3 a share. The burn rate has
stabilized at about a nickel per share per quarter. Revenue has also stabilized
at about $22 million a quarter. The CEO of the company, which is based in
Israel, is conserving cash. We talked him out of making a sizable acquisition
with the cash. Instead, he dedicated a significant amount to a stock buyback.
The company also recently bought the fixed- wireless subsidiary of ECI Telecom
called InnoWave for a mere pittance. This is a stock that is out of favor and
that very few own.

Q: What's the market cap?
A: About $55 million. It has about $90 million in sales.

One 'lifecycle' concern with high FCF companies is that since higher cash flows

Hi Bob Rudd

Regarding EK, what I found interesting is that they have 63% market share in
China. Like the dividend too.

BA... while parked planes is definitely major bad news, what causes me to steer
away from BA is a news report I saw somewhere a while back that indicated that
they "manage" their income and expense numbers via how they cost account for
major projects. Unless I see something in the 10K which makes it clear to me
why something like this would make sense to a passive owner, I probably won't
become one.

On another point, I don't calculate FCF in the traditional way. I use
Depreciation as a proxy for the real upkeep expense and, if Depreciation is
greater than CAPEX, subtract the difference from cash flow, because I believe
the enterprise is artificially inflating the cash flow through under allowing
for proper maintenence of the factors of production.

If CAPEX is greater than Depreciation, I add the difference back to cash flow
because I then view the excess as an optional use of cash flow, which under
some different circumstances, might have flowed directly to the shareholder via
dividends.

broken out on a separate line item, but it would be just one more thing

EK: Overall, including China, the film business is being killed by digital - it
won't go away entirely, but it's going the way of the cassette tape. Digital
cameras have recently experienced substantial price drops that will accelerate
an already rapid adaption. EK has nowhere near the position in digital as it

Bob Rudd, I agree with you about Buffett's takeovers. You get validation, but
the Man is downright cheap. Just as Larry S. says you might want if you were a
BKH stockholder.

I am surprised to see so many (well, a few... up from none)acquisitions being
announced right now regarding stocks that have previously and often been
discussed here or on the Buffettology thread. Perhaps it's just a random thing;
perhaps though it's an indication that low stock prices are compelling business
people to act on the values they believe they see.

"Bet with the master" - yes? And maybe you will tell how to do this? How about
comprehensive analysis of BRK? Somehow in my calculations it does not offer the
same potential return as CMH, which in rosy scenario could have offered about
17% annualized ROI (I don't own either). And CMH will not increase BRKs return
since it is only 2% of BRK.

But then I don't understand BRK, so what do I know.

Jurgis Bekepuris, I'm still holding CE. Sorry to report though that my initial
purchases were a bit higher than FDC's buyout price. And I didn't add enough CE
when prices were lower to make the position profitable now. I'll likely wait a
bit to determine if I want to be an FDC stockholder.

CE closed at $12.44. IF offer goes through, CE holder gets .4 FDC stock per CE
share, and so values CE today at (.4 x $34.79 =) $13.91. I read there might be
some question as to regulatory approval of the deal; CE management though seems
to be very confident of it getting done.

I might consider buying more CE at current price just for this spread. If
anybody here has any interest in doing this, let's post on "Arbitrage Plays"

My View on Short Selling:

In my view short-sellers are typically more sophisticated and more in tune with
specific equity issues. To short a stock is not a typical trade by the average
investor on the street. Besides the always "your losses are unlimited" concept,
the overtrend is of the market is up over time.

If a significant amount of short sellers exist for a specific stock, then there
is usually a compelling or interesting viewpoint to be gleamed.

One writer who has saved me significant amount of money is Herb Greenberg -- by
reporting/investigating what short sellers are doing and their arguments.
Herb's thoughts are not always correct -- but his track record is terrific.

I just seem to have avoided this bank for one poor reason or another. (EWBC

I'll go instead though with another minority now: Koreans. Bank here is PUBB.
(about 1.4% ROA, 0 debt, pe ~ 11) Very small bank, but I'm counting on the
propensity for Korean emigrants to save and invest and deal with business

re: short sellers

Good morning Dale,

I respectfully disagee -- in terms of what Herb G. has provided to at least me.
When I read Herb, I don't just sell my position or short the same stock. I read
the logic, interpretation of financial data (the same goes with what Bob
Olstein may publicly state), and make my own conclusions.

A recent example is (ELN). I exited my position at $45 prior to its collapse.
The articles that made me focus more closely (which I am responsible for doing
with or without Herb "touting" short seller comments) on the company's
financial issues.

"And you will never hear "oops we were wrong" from any of them. They dine out
on the winners and ignore their losers."

Herb personally writes a column 1-3 times a year giving a grade on his columns:
A-F. If he is wrong, he admits it. It appears you have not read Herb if you
believe he doesn't admit when he is wrong. No offense -- but all Herb readers
know he is the first to admit his "correct" vs. "wrong" calls.

Herb has alerted me to situations that have saved me money. I'm just one
opinion so take it with a grain of salt.

Good morning Steve168,

Reading Victor Niedenhoffer's new book, Practical Speculation, provided some
terrific insight into Value Line's "1-timeliness" success -- in reality vs. the
Value Line's mutual fund offerings. (Victor was the hedge fund manager of the

statistical evidence to support his views.)

I don't follow the newsletter you mentioned. I follow a few newsletters for

$1000 a year if there stock selection ability was that great. But for providing
ideas, I love reading newsletters. I recently read of a $100 million cap
company that I am buying a couple of hundred shares a day -- because the volume
is so low. Ideas like this aren't spouted on CNBC.

I should add that I do follow institutional newsletters that provide insight on

Good morning Paul,

I started to peruse my http://www.afajof.org/ articles to substantiate the
"short sellers are sophisticated" issue -- to which I claim to be true by those
short sellers I follow. The same argument could be said about long only holders
-- some are more sophisticated than others.

But during my 60-second initial search, I recognized I could not find any
article that could proof such a general concept. I would need to specify sample
size, period of time, etc. I can't, other than show specific annual returns,
prove that Doug Kass is a sophisticated short seller. I can't prove that George
Soros is a sophisticated short seller. What I do know on a personal level is
successful short sellers do their homework.

But to move onto another subject, I'll go along with you that short sellers are
not sophisticated. If I can't support my argument, then it is without merit.

If enough people believe short sellers are more apt to be right than wrong, and

going on that will/can/might drive such stocks lower and keep them low.

I've gotten beat-up by buying into positions where there's been lots of
short-selling. Sometimes though, I've captured nice gains by doing this. In
such times, either the shorts were wrong about an issue or the shorts were
right (and made themselves money), but I caught the stock in a recovery phase

I don't try to get any qualitative estimate of management.

Occasionally with a stock I've followed for a long-time where there's
consistent management, I come to respect the CEO as a business person. (Not
that I would be correct in having that opinion or that I would be able to
profit from it.) As regards bank stocks, CEO Rady of Wescorp (WES) comes to

Lernout & Hauspie: The Plot Continues to Thicken as New Details Emerge
By Herb Greenberg
Senior Columnist
4/9/99 6:30 AM ET
An item here yesterday offered Lernout & Hauspie (LHSP:Nasdaq), the Belgian
voice-recognition software company, the chance to answer questions directly
posed by short-sellers who claim the company won't respond to their queries.

Thus far, Lernout has been silent to this column. So, let's pose a few of those
questions right here and now:

Why weren't the fourth-quarter financial statements, released Wednesday,
audited? It's not unusual for companies to issue a press release containing
unaudited results, but usually they're only unaudited if they're released
shortly after the quarter ends, not when they've been delayed for 97 days!

(A reminder: The fourth quarter is always the audited quarter. When the initial
results presented to shareholders are unaudited, it behooves investors to read
the 10-K to catch any changes; believe it or not, the actual numbers sometimes
do change. However, in the case of Lernout, there is no 10-K because Lernout is
a foreign company whose stock is dually listed in the U.S. and Belgium. Foreign
companies are only required to file financial statements with the SEC twice a
year, and they're not required to file on the agency's electronic Edgar system.
Many, however, do file on Edgar. Lernout does not. That raises question No. 2:
Why not?)

Next: How good is the quality of Lernout's earnings?

According to participants in the fourth-quarter conference call Wednesday, CEO
Gaston Bastiaens said the quarter's earnings were of the highest quality.
However, one transaction on the last day of the quarter may put the quality of
some of those earnings in doubt.

The transaction involved Applied Voice Recognition, a 5-year-old Texas company
now called e-Docs.net that makes voice recognition dictation systems for
doctors. It trades on the OTC Bulletin Board. The company appeared to be in
dire financial straits until an investment partnership run by Lernout founders
Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie happened along. Applied was in such bad shape,
according to its just-filed 10-K, that last year it had traded its own stock
for such things as consulting services, salaries and office furniture. It was
so bad that just two weeks ago its auditors wrote in the 10-K that "without the
assurance of new capital, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern."

Lernout has come under fire in the past for transactions with so-called
"related parties" involving L & H Investment Co., run by Mssrs. Lernout and
Hauspie. The Applied transaction appears to be the most recent. According to
Applied's 10-K, the original deal, struck last Sept. 30, gave Applied
nonexclusive rights to certain Lernout software in exchange for $300,000 due
Dec. 15.

However, according to the SEC filing, on Dec. 27 the amount owed to Lernout was
boosted to $1 million, with $650,000 due Dec. 31 -- the last day of the quarter
-- and the balance due on March 15. As it so happens, according to the 10-K, on
Dec. 31 L & H Investment also bought $2 million of Applied preferred stock as
part of an agreement to invest up to $8.75 million in the company.

Applied CEO Tim Connolly says he saw nothing wrong with the timing of the
transaction. In return he received rights to Lernout's telephone-based voice
recognition dictation software, filling "a critical part" of his product plan.
"I would've moved heaven and earth to buy those rights whether they were
investing in us or not, because there's not another company in the U.S. that
has telephone voice recognition software for dictation."

He adds, "I knew they wanted to get a sale done by the end of the year, so I
used that to my advantage."

Would he have been able to buy the technology if Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie
hadn't bought the company's stock? (There was a pause, then Connolly said: "I
could have raised the money.")

What about the timing of the transaction? Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie have
since invested a total of $5 million in Applied. "Nobody in their right mind
would invest $5 million to get $1 million in revenues," Connolly said. (Maybe
not, but short-sellers point out that as of last August Messrs. Lernout and
Hauspie owned 23% of Lernout stock. The shares, which rose as high as 68 a year
ago, yesterday were at 41 1/2; on March 30 they were at 28 1/2.)

Speaking of related-party transactions, we know about Applied because it's
public. Does Lernout have any similar transactions with private companies? And
how much did related-party transactions contribute to the fourth quarter and
all of last year?

On the fourth-quarter conference call, Bastiaens said related-party
transactions for the year amounted to $8.7 million in revenues, including $2.2
million in the fourth quarter. However, according to a Feb. 26 Wall Street
Journal story, he said the number was $5.4 million through the first nine
months. If so, then the real fourth-quarter number should be more like $3.3
million, or $1 million more. Each million equals about 2 cents of earnings; a
million here from one transaction, a million there from another and pretty
soon, according to short-sellers, the quality of earnings comes into question.

Meanwhile, much has been made of Microsoft's (MSFT:Nasdaq) recent announcement
that it had acquired an 8% stake in Lernout, with the exercise of an option
last December for additional shares. More recently, Lernout announced that
Intel (INTC:Nasdaq) has entered an agreement to buy $30 million of Lernout
stock, pending due diligence.

The Intel transaction is currently insignificant because it has not been
completed, and not all analysts are impressed with the Microsoft relationship.
Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Skiba, who yesterday started coverage on the
stock with a neutral, said he doesn't believe the Microsoft relationship will
ever amount to anything significant "as Microsoft has shown no historic pattern
of making any company financially well-off through technology agreements."
(Lehman has done investment banking work for Lernout; another analyst used to
cover the stock with a buy rating.)

My question: Is Skiba right?

Requests to speak with Lernout officials were left yesterday on voicemail with
two spokeswomen, and a list of questions from this column was emailed to the
same spokeswomen. There has been no response. If Lernout does decide to comment
on these issues, its response will be posted in this space with the same
prominence as these questions.

Fleming:
Herb on TheStreet
Why the Shorts Chomp on Fleming's Failings
11/09/01 12:06 PM ET
By Herb Greenberg
The food distributor's earnings quality is questionable, some short-sellers
say.

Fried-day:

Short shrift: Whenever a company blames the shorts for its troubles, it's time
to take a closer look. Which brings us to Fleming (FLM:NYSE - news -
commentary) , a food distribution company, which filed an 8-K the other day
containing a letter to investors that blames the shorts for its swooning stock
price. Among other things, the company encourages investors to "call your
broker ... and determine whether your shares have been loaned to short
sellers." The company also says it's looking into "all legal and regulatory
remedies ... to identify and combat any coordinated activities by short
sellers."

A little Enronesque, no?! Time to take out the magnifying glass and see. Why in
the world would a company like Fleming attract so many shorts? Talk to any
Fleming short-seller and you're bound to hear about the company's deal earlier
this year to supply food to financially hobbled Kmart (KM:NYSE - news -
commentary) .

"Who in their right mind would bet the company on Kmart, anyway?" asks one
Fleming short. Fleming has never disclosed many details about its Kmart deal,
but it's important to note that SuperValu (SVU:NYSE - news - commentary)
decided not to bid on the Kmart deal because it would be too unprofitable in
what is already a low-margin business. Kmart has since become Fleming's largest
customer, generating 15% of sales in the second quarter and rising. With Kmart
itself having trouble, Fleming has warned in a recent proxy that there's a risk
Kmart won't meet certain sales projections, which would mean "the benefits that
we will receive as the result of the agreement will decrease."

The Kmart deal is also capital-intensive, and capital isn't something the
company has in great abundance. Last quarter Fleming had cash of only $43
million, vs. debt and capital lease obligations of $1.9 billion (though it had
$345 million left on its credit line as of the second quarter).

As if Fleming really needs more debt?! This might explain why the company is so
focused on its stock, which has lost 37% of its value since Aug. 1: It can't
very well raise cash via a stock deal if there are more sellers than buyers for
its stock.

The shorts are also attracted to the quality of earnings, or lack thereof.
Quarterly earnings have been skewed by a series of "adjustments" related to a
strategic plan three years ago. (Just say, "Charge it!") Cash flow from
operations is also a red flag: It has gone from positive $169 million for the
six months ended June 1999 to a negative $64 million in the first six months of
this year.

What's more, in 1999 and 2000 cash flow from operations was less than 30% of
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That's
low by retail standards. It's always a warning, says one analyst, when that
figure slips below 50% because it shows the size of the discrepancy between the
cash a company has generated and its reported (or, in this case, adjusted)
earnings. The bigger the gap, the more the business is failing to generate the
cash it should.

The industry itself is a tough one. There's more, but you get my drift. Company
officials couldn't be reached.

Tech talk: The way some of these chip and tech stocks are moving would make you
think happy days are here again. Oh, really? That's not what Jim Coleman, of
Blackfin Research -- formerly of Fechtor Detwiler -- found in his recent
channel checks. As he wrote to clients Thursday: "After spending time with some
ex-colleagues of mine in distribution, one thing was certain; improving
business in October did not cause Wall Street's party. The stories we're
getting out of distribution are not about rebounds and order pick-ups, but more
somber notes like three of the largest branches of one of the major
semiconductor distributors closed October at roughly 50% of sales budget."

Coleman adds that "distribution is an excellent leading indicator for future
business. As business begins to improve, requirements/orders start out small
and hence tend to trickle into the [distribution] channel first. Once things
get 'hot' and requirements large enough, manufacturers begin to take orders
'direct.' Right now, visibility remains murky at best as turns business remains
the name of the game.

"One final thought. While a number of market pundits are starting to preach
that inventories have been worked off, distribution is still extremely cautious
on this issue. After experiencing declining cancellations during the last three
months, returns and credits shot up some 7% in October."

Lights, camera: Catch me on CNBC at 11:50 a.m. EST Monday, where I'll be waving
the red flags.

My initial reaction: I was embarrassed that Vic could write that Buffett is
basically overrated and downplay Warren's success.

Don Luskin did the same thing on national TV and in print. Don failed miserably
as an investor.

Maybe Vic could have made the Warren argument prior to '97, but in my view if
you lose all of your chips and go belly up -- then you can't criticize, with
credibility, someone with Warren's track record.

Just my opinion.

Paul, I disagree re short selling. The best opportunities I have found in past
several years have been in short oriented positions with which I agree by
detailed analysis of company documents. I do not have guts to short but I write
many naked way out of the money long term call options and also some long term
puts. Just going down some of my long standing 2004 calls short are
aes(40),adelq(40),brcd (90),cmrc(25),cnxt(25) ad nauseum. Positions taken when
the yahoos were pumping the stocks and analysis would lead one to believe they
were terribly wrong. I am conservative and willing to take a very small premium
if I can minimize risk. The margin rules allow you to put up only 10% of the
underlying and the YTM can therefore be quite reasonable relative to risk. For
example last week I wrote quite a few dal 2005 35 calls for .45. My assessment
is that dal has almost no chance to reach 35 in 22 months and I expect to earn
45 dollars for 100 dollars in margin. On the flip side I have been writing many
puts on low price energy stocks (cpn,aes,rri,ep). The leverage on low priced
stocks is excellent. My sales of cpn puts 2.5/2005 have been for 1.50 and
margin is now .30. Much more risk(like my hrc 2.5 puts).
Anyhow my two bits.

Timba, Awhile back you posted some great stuff on Dell Cash flow. Thought you
[and the thread] might find this controversy on Dell's inventory treatment
interesting [Caps & [comments] are mine for emphasis in my notes]
DELL'S ACCOUNTING TRIMS INVENTORY, SHIFTS SOME PCS (UPDATE4) 4/7/03 By Peter J.
Brennan

Round Rock, Texas, April 7 (Bloomberg) -- ``Inventory can mean the difference
between success and failure in our industry.'' Those words from Dell Computer
Corp. Chairman Michael Dell in a 2000 speech embody the company's mission to
stay lean.

Dell's inventory numbers mostly stack up well when compared with rival makers
of personal computers. WHAT MAKES THEM LOOK EVEN LEANER AGAINST COMPETITORS IS
AN APPROACH TO ACCOUNTING FOR INVENTORY THAT ONLY DELL EMPLOYS. Without it,
Dell's inventory might double from its current three days. Apple Computer Inc.
has the next-lowest inventory in the industry, at four days.

Apple, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Gateway Inc. count COMPUTERS IN TRANSIT TO
CUSTOMERS as INVENTORY on the balance sheet. DELL, THE WORLD'S SECOND-LARGEST
PC MAKER BY UNITS SHIPPED, TREATS IN- TRANSIT PCS DIFFERENTLY, MIXING THEM WITH
``OTHER CURRENT ASSETS.''

That clouds its inventory picture, investors said.

``It makes the job of an analyst or an individual investor very difficult
because it's comparing apples and oranges,'' said Tim Ghriskey of Ghriskey
Capital Partners LLC, a hedge fund that manages $100 million and has bought and
sold Dell shares in the past year.

Less Risk

Investors like low inventory, especially in businesses such as PCs, where the
profit on each unit sold is relatively small. It means less risk of
obsolescence. It also indicates how well products are selling and shows that a
company's capital isn't tied up in non-productive assets. A growing inventory
means a company is making products that aren't selling.

Dell's ``return on assets is much higher than the industry average,'' said
Christian Koch, senior technology analyst for Trusco Capital Management, who
sold Dell shares in 2001 because he believed the company was overvalued.
``They've done a great job of selling Wall Street and institutional investors
on the pros of their business model. One of the pros is their inventory.'' [ROA
shouldn't change by shifting shipped PC's from Inv to OCA]

Dell, the best-performing stock in the U.S. in the 1990s, says its method
complies with accounting rules.

``It's totally variable,'' Michael Dell said in an interview. ``There's NO
STANDARD WAY OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVENTORY IN THE CHANNEL. Dell doesn't have any
inventory in the channel; we have Dell and we have the customer.''

Less Clarity

Some investors say DELL'S DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING CATEGORIES UNDERMINE CLARITY.

``Having those numbers included in a category called `other' is not the best
idea,'' said James Lyon, who helps to manage $340 million at Oakwood Capital
Management in Los Angeles and owned 70,180 Dell shares as of December. ``I'm a
big fan of transparency.''

At the end of the fourth quarter, Round Rock, Texas-based Dell reported $306
million in inventory -- less than the $400 million of in-transit PCs. Under
inventory methods used by Hewlett- Packard and Gateway, Dell's inventory figure
would have been $706 million.

Dell spokesman Mike Maher provided the fourth-quarter in- transit figure.
Normally, investors don't see a breakdown of Dell's ``other current assets''
category and are unable to determine a total inventory figure to compare with
competitors.

Dell DOESN'T CONSIDER IN-TRANSIT PRODUCTS TO BE INVENTORY BECAUSE THEY'VE
ALREADY BEEN SOLD AND THE TITLES TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS, spokesman T.R. Reid
said.

Recognizing Revenue

In 1999, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staff set policies
intended to clarify the accounting of finished goods. The SEC policy statement
said, in part, that FOR COMPANIES TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE, ``DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED
or services have been rendered.'' In some cases, according to the document,
DELIVERY IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE OCCURRED WHEN THE TITLE HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED AND
THE BUYER HAS ``ASSUMED THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP.''

Still, the rules are open to interpretation, say the companies and accountants.
Companies such as HEWLETT-PACKARD AND GATEWAY HAVE TAKEN THE SEC MEMO TO MEAN
THAT GOODS IN TRANSIT SHOULD BE TREATED AS INVENTORY UNTIL CUSTOMERS RECEIVE
THEM.

Another exception is International Business Machines Corp., the world's
third-largest maker of personal computers. Once the title to a product is
handed over, the unit is considered to be out of IBM's inventory, even if it's
not yet in a customer's hands, spokesman Bill Hughes said.

Title Transferred

IBM doesn't treat the units in a separate accounting category like Dell; once
the title is transferred, revenue is booked.

``Our inventory levels now stand at a 20-year low,'' IBM Chief Executive Sam
Palmisano told investors in the company's latest annual report. IBM's inventory
includes computer-related finished goods other than PCs.

Dell shares have risen 9.3 percent over the past year, while IBM's declined 17
percent. The Nasdaq Computer Index has fallen 24 percent over the same period,
and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has dropped 22 percent.

Dell rose 1 cent to $28.88 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

There are no in-transit accounts at Hewlett-Packard, the world's No. 1 maker of
PCs by units shipped; at Gateway, which ranks No. 3 in the U.S.; or at Apple
Computer, No. 5 in the U.S., according to these companies. They treat PCs as
inventory until customers receive them.

``We have conservative accounting practices,'' Hewlett- Packard spokeswoman
Rebeca Robboy said. ``For us, it's either revenue or inventory. There's no
limbo category.''

Until Delivery

Gateway breaks out ``finished goods'' when it reports total inventory.

``After we make a sale, we continue to account for it as inventory until the
customer accepts delivery,'' Gateway spokesman Brad Shaw said.

Some accountants say Dell and IBM can argue that they are interpreting the
rules correctly. Some of IBM's PC shipments, for example, are part of larger
computer-services contracts where individual components aren't booked
separately.

``You cannot simply look at the announced policy and conclude one is right and
one is wrong,'' said Andrew Bailey, a former academic fellow at the SEC who
studied revenue recognition. ``Dell and IBM are probably both within their
rights, presuming they are not stuffing their pipelines.''

The rules are set up so that investors can compare the inventory of a company
with its own prior periods, Bailey said. They are not as good at ensuring that
comparisons can be made among different companies, he said.

``Comparability across firms has always been a problem,'' Bailey said. The
accounting industry has decided that ``there can be variability across firms.''

Clarity Needed

Still, accountants and investors said companies like Dell should be clearer.

``I'd be inclined to label it `inventory in transit' or `inventory to
customers''' rather than part of other current assets, said Walter Schuetze, a
former SEC chief accountant.

Dell's three days of inventory compares with Gateway's eight days, Apple's four
days and Hewlett-Packard's 40 days, according to company filings. IBM doesn't
report days of inventory.

Dell's inventory is ``a bit misleading when you compare it to, say, Gateway,''
Ghriskey said.

Hewlett-Packard's inventory is higher in part because it sells PCs, printers
and other goods through retailers and distributors. Gateway operates about 192
retail stores that stock items including televisions and cameras.

As Lyon of Oakwood Capital sees it, Dell should clarify what it's doing.

``It would probably be appropriate to disclose the dollar value of those
shipments'' of finished goods, Lyon said. ``As analysts, we can decide whether
to include it in inventory calculations or not. Disclosing that number would be
more helpful.''

Bob, interesting article. I actually buy into Dell's taking PC's out of
inventory once they ship them. The way their business works, that's
appropriate. However, if they're going to do that they should book the sale the
way IBM does. Seems to me that the DSO number is the one being manipulated. And
no matter how you slice it, you're taking days out of the operating cycle that
belong in there.

Thanks for posting the article, and you're correct, I did find it interesting.

WHAT MAKES THEM LOOK EVEN LEANER AGAINST COMPETITORS IS AN APPROACH TO
ACCOUNTING FOR INVENTORY THAT ONLY DELL EMPLOYS.

I find myself always checking my pockets to see what's missing when a company
employs an accounting "convention" that no one else does. It never bodes well
for my interests as a passive owner.

DELL, THE WORLD'S SECOND-LARGEST PC MAKER BY UNITS SHIPPED, TREATS IN- TRANSIT
PCS DIFFERENTLY, MIXING THEM WITH ``OTHER CURRENT ASSETS.'' 

DELL is pretty arrogant and it doesn't surprise me that they felt like they had
to reinvent the wheel because they were the first one to have ever run across
the issue of making something and then shipping it to a customer and faced with
the really perplexing question: "What category do we put the stuff into that
we've sold and shipped?"

``It's totally variable,'' Michael Dell said in an interview. ``There's NO
STANDARD WAY OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVENTORY IN THE CHANNEL. Dell doesn't have any
inventory in the channel; we have Dell and we have the customer.'' 

Isn't that just so special?

The key takeaway for me in the article is not whether Dell is 'right' or
'wrong' in the way they treat inventories. It's the large difference that what
would seem a subtle difference can make. Inventory turns [& similar] are a
critical metric for nearly all goods selling entities. Dell gets very high
marks for doing it better than anyone else, so it appears that there's little
focus on this 'subtle' distinction.
The relationship between those that craft financial reports and those that
analyze them is somewhat adversarial. The CFO wants a high stock price and
cheap capital so he seeks to present data in the most favorable light [without
crossing lines that would send him to the hoosegow in most cases]. The
analyst/investor wants to see thru the prettiness to the reality of the
situation so that reality doesn't reveal itself to him as a 'buying
opportunity' when he owns the stock [Ouch!]. Rising DSO's and inventories are
such well-known red flags, that companies resort to more subtle approaches to
'pretty-up' their operating stats. This is a good example. Checking the
footnotes for how goods selling companies recognize revenues and deal with
inventory in transit...that's the key takeaway, especially when high turns is a
key metric for a co.

inapproppriately...he later used similar tactics and lost all the money

Interesting- I looked at it quickly and was surprised at the immediate haircut
. Thought it might be overblown but I cant stop and learn a business that
quickly. I did not hear the conference call but I am wondering why those
receivables would not be more or less ironclad unless there was some fraud
there. Also this company has a market cap of over $1Billion for what I thought
would have been a pretty small business. I need to do a lot more research. I am
also looking at RTRSY another business I dont understand, but the stock sure
has plummetted. I dont see a good reason to buy Dell. But I think Apple has
been mentioned a few times on this thread and i had a question I wanted
verified- I read that Jobs turned in his underwater options and received in its
place from grateful director an outright grant of some 75,0000 shares. Looking
at the chart it looks like Aaple was around $15 in 1988 and doesnt pay a
dividend. so any long term investor is showing no return in some 15 years. am I
missing something here?
Speaking of no returns I got my statement from Oakmark Intl
a value fund, and after a 5 year investment(or so it seems) in an ira account -
I continue to be underwater. this doesnt stop them from reminding me that it is
time to put in my IRA money- fat chance! It would seem to me that irrespective

ARI and KRC are both in South California where the economy is doing reasonably

With respect to REIT's I learned that the expenditures to maintain the
properties must be subtracted from FFO to get the dividendable part of the FFO.

I agree. I have been following the lawsuits since 1997.

I have owned MO off and on since Marlboro Friday in April 1993. Legal troubles

Every few years the tobacco sector is hit with a lawsuits.

MO claims to have never actually made a payment on any tobacco lawsuits.

The states won't allow big MO to go bankrupt.

They will gradually impose heavier fines and taxes on the sector,but won't kill
it.

The states are hypocritical, because they were supposed to use the $250 billion
over 25 years to treat people dying from cancer etc, but instead used the money
to cut taxes and other government projects.

I would never invest in tobacco bonds, but have no problem owning KFT or MO.

Madarry - Oakmark International and no return in 5 years.

Overall, I felt that International Value funds had a very lackluster
performance for the last X years. See TBGVX - Tweedy Browne is also respected
value family. TDF did a bit better with wide fluctuations, but then EMF did
really bad.

But then Nasdaq and S&P500 also fell in the last 5 years, so what do you expect
of the mutuals? TAVFX is flat, TWEBX is down, OAKMX is flat, CFIMX is down,
DODGX is flat, KDHAX is down, even LMVTX is flat - and that's the guy who
outperformed S&P500 for 11 years (12?) non-stop! And these are the best of the
best value funds. (I know I missed some, people will correct me ;-0)))

The real question is: do you have alternative suggestions? Within mutual funds

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/research/comp_chart.gsp?cs=IWW&cs=IWN&cs=IJS&csi
INX&cs=IJJ&cs=IVE&cs=IWD&cs=IWS&n=40&p=month

Unfortunately, none of these chart back further than 3 years(well they could be
found somewhere else). Over that time, the returns range from about 5 % for the
smalls to -30 % for the bigs. Any funds seriously underperforming these should
be questioned.

Dale,

Disagree. There was an article that showed that large funds can perform fine -
unfortunately I can't find it. Also look e.g.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=dodgx&k=c1&t=5y&s=%5Egspc&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

Where is the correlation?

Larry,

Personally, with mutuals I am "buy and forget" investor. I buy them because of
their management and their investing acumen, so unless the management changes,
I never sell. (Exceptions: 401(k) funds that are not the best, because of the
401(k) limitations. I plan to switch out of them once I roll over 401(k) into
IRA).

I also don't have any predictive abilities, so I never roll to things like
"high yield". BTW, IMHO bonds were a place to be when they yielded 15% and
inflation was roaring. Now we are on the opposite end of the swing, neh? But I
am no bond expert. :-)

Jurgis - I thought about PIMCO bond fund for balance and then nixed the idea...

AAPL split 2-1 in May of 2000.

But I am the last one to defend the performance of the management, the company,
or the stock. All have been wretched.

I hold AAPL only because it is a superb vehicle for covered calls. I can't see
any potential at all for significant upside in the stock.

The correlation is here:

Top Performers - 5 Year
Fund Name Symbol Ann. Ret.
Schroder Ultra Inv SMCFX 62.13%
Turner Micro Cap Growth TMCGX 27.94%
Kinetics Internet WWWFX 20.19%
Wasatch Micro Cap WMICX 18.47%
Matthews Korea MAKOX 17.52%
Bjurman, Barry Micro-Cap Growth BMCFX 16.15%
PIMCO RCM Biotechnology D DRBNX 15.28%
PIMCO Emerging Markets Bond Instl PEBIX 14.52%
Calamos Growth A CVGRX 14.48%
Calamos Growth C CVGCX 14.11%

All except Calamos are sub-$400 million funds. Why chase the elephants when you
can run with the agile critters instead?

Because none of these have the management I trust. E.g. SMCFX - 619% turnover -
pleeeaaassssse!

And by the way, with these guys the comment: "Past performance does not
guarantee future results" is much more appropriate than with long-running value
funds.

Thanks for the list though. I'll browse through it on my leisure. :-)

Fair enough - I have a relative who trusts no one but Fidelity and her
portfolio is down 50-60% from the 2000 highs using their big cap funds. But she
"trusts" them through thick and thin.

Five-year results are a pretty good indicator when they span both a bubble and
a bear market. Good luck.

Split is captured in the price graph.
