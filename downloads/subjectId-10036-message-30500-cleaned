OK, I am shooting from the hip here, but here are couple questions regarding
Tilson's claims:

- Did he actually adjust his calculations for a low rate environment? I know he
does this somewhat in various places, but I am not sure that he fully accounts
for it. I would bet that house ownership and prices in >10% mortgages vs. 6-7%
mortgages is not linearly correlated and should not be.

- I've seen some comments about the house "value" in terms of footage and
things included (garage, pool, kitchen appliances, etc.) has risen a lot so as
not to be directly comparable to houses 10-20 years ago. I am not sure this is
very much true.

- What about building costs? I am also not sure about these things, since on
one hand almost any house remodeling is ridiculously expensive and estimated
"replacement costs" at insurance companies is astronomical. On the other hand,
it seems that homies manage to build and sell 100K-200K huge houses in the
cheap areas, so perhaps the building costs are not that high...

Funny you should mention Nortel... I had a buy stop hit on that one this
morning when it rose above its March high. But I don't like the volume so far.

I'll never forget the Nortel collapse. It was just by good fortune that I
didn't own it, but I was living in Ottawa, ON at the time. It was in almost
everybody's retirement portfolio.

I'll take a look at CRESY -- I like the idea South America and global real

off a financial crisis by following a helicopter Ben approach to money supply.

Jurgis, I'm not sure where you're going with the observations of whether or not
house "values" and square footage of houses have risen (they have), and whether
building costs have risen. One of the main points is that relative to incomes,
the assumption of debt in recent years is WAY off trend.

So regardless of house value, square footage or building costs, if the average
buyer is neck deep in debt, with tightening credit and credit covenants, the
demand must pull back, reducing the inflated "value".

Unless I'm missing your point?

>One of the main points is that relative to incomes, the assumption of debt in

Which is what I am trying to explain with the effect of 6-7% rates vs. historic
>10%. Sure, there were excesses, but when debt is cheap its usage will not rise
linearly with interest drop, but rather somewhat exponentially. E.g. if I got a
1-2% loan right now, I would probably buy another 10 houses. ;)

So I am asking whether people saying that it's "WAY off trend" account for the
fact that the debt was cheap and is still cheap?

>with tightening credit and credit covenants, the demand must pull back,
reducing the inflated "value".

Yes, but demand already fell and it already reduced the value. In some places
quite significantly. The real question in this inning is whether the value was
reduced enough, overshot, undershot or what. And whether the demand at current
prices will reappear once people are not scared.

I am not saying that we are in the clear, but I am also far from bearish.

I would be probably more concerned about resource inflation than with the
credit markets.

Not to belabor the point...but...

The reason the ratio (debt/income)trend is important is that presumably there
will be a reversion to the mean. One of several reasons for the reversion to
take place is the imposition of tighter lending standards.

The debt levels per household were unsustainable for individuals taking on
ARMs, or even fixed rate mortgages if they were at their credit limit. They
reckoned the economic cycle would never turn down. The rates and easy money had
everything to do with the assumption of the debt loads and those rates and easy
money were not sustainable.

So when Tilson is pointing to the ratio trend and saying we still have a huge
amount of debt out there that was written throughout 2006 and early 2007 at low
ARMS rates, that's the argument that we are still in the early innings.

I agree that the real question is whether the house values have reduced enough.
In trying to assess the answer to that question, the question of whether the
debt is affordable at the moment or whether the debt load is affordable over
the long term is something to be considered. Seems probable that given the
amount of pain out there now, it could take a while.

Are you sure?

I was in Argentina couple years ago and they were still just recovering from
the currency crisis in 2002.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_economic_crisis_(1999-2002)
Consumers there may not be indebted, but they have sharply lower assets due to
currency crisis and inflation.

Almost everyone who talks about LA still thinks that Brazil is great while
Argentina sucks and will continue to do so. I think couple of issues are
continuing high inflation and political instability.

I just find I'm more enamored of ERF right now. They have an investment (maybe

possibility of THAT intrigues me. (I am buying several stocks with

----------------------
I may be changing my opinion of some of these high-dividend (high yield)
stocks: Whereas before I figured something like MCGC or the other bdc's were
"safer" because they were diversified and lent money to various companies vs.
Canroys which were specific to oil/gas and subject to quickly changing Canadian
laws...maybe I've been wrong and the Canroys are safer than the bdc's. Because
the bdc's themselves may have funding issues or the companies they've funded
now have issues of securing business or paying back debt. OTOH, if I look at my
portfolio, it seems like neither the bdc's nor the Canroy's have done well over
the past couple of years that I have been buying.

Added NGLS to my MLP income plays MGG, MWE and WMZ.

NGLS is a fairly new MLP trading below IPO price like WMZ. Similar to MWE it is
a NG midstream (NG gatherer and processor), so there is more commodity risk
since a percentage of their payments are tied to NG prices.

NGLS operates in the prolific Barnett Shale, so there is good organic growth
and besides that NGLS benefits from "dropdown" of assets from the general
partner for growth. the current distribution is almost 2x covered by
distributable cash flow to further distribution increases are almost

I agree, we have to watch the travel situation carefully going forward, but so
far I'm feeling good.

Of the four categories you mentioned, I'm only in hotel stocks for now. I'd
consider rental car agencies too but haven't jumped in yet. I like these two
business-related areas because I think employment is becoming more
consultant/contractor oriented on the whole, and that trend leads to more
business travel and therefore more hotels and rental cars.

Cruises are not business-related, so I'm staying away for now.

The airlines are in trouble I think. I fly about every other week, and the talk
I hear is that Fuel prices are going to drive the companies into the ground,
which is why the bigger companies are trying to merge. But, the pilots aren't
wanting to give up their seniority and prime routes in a merger, so there are
obstacles to the merging. My understanding is that southwest has oil hedged for
a few years, but eventually I think even it will feel the pinch. In the
meantime, if mergers don't happen, I'd expect a couple of these airlines to go
bankrupt if fuel prices stay high as higher prices won't be able to be passed
on to consumers without mergers.

But, I could be wrong. Southwest is my favorite airline to fly, so I hope they
continue to do well.

Madharry,

You are correct about buying into Argentina when the rest of the world ignores
or hates its prospects. I read the research you presented on Argentina and it
did not seem like a horrible place.

I am old enough to remember when people that opposed the military junta
"disappeared" and their family members petitioned the junta about the
whereabouts of their deceased loved ones. That was a tragic chapter in the
history of that country. I did some stock market research on Argentina and
found it was one of the only latin American stock markets listed in the Wall
Street Journal in the early 1900s then poof its listing was gone. I am old
enough to remember when the South American stocks markets were called ABC for
Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.

So somehow Argentina has lost its lustre. Some one stated recently Brazil has
overshadowed Argentina. This true and Brazil's prospects and people are shining
into the 21st Century.

But Argentina continues to have its Pampas and grasslands and livestock. Just
no petroleum. The petroleum is in Brazil and Venezuela and Peru. No precious
metals. The precious metals is in Brazil and Bolivia and Peru and Columbia. No
coffee. The coffee is in central America and Columbia. It appears the hot in
demand commodities are located elsewhere, so Argentina sits on the outside
looking in for now. But things change over time and the Pampas and its cattle
will become desirable again.

Can you remember when the great Argentinian Oscar Bonavena boxed Muhammed Ali
back in the day?

BTW, regarding Argentina as a great place to live. Ten to fifteen years ago,
when John Elway was a premier quarterback in the NFL, Denver was a great place
to live for free agent football players. Great climate, good housing, fine
women, etc. --- Elway retired. --- Now the footballers are annoyed when they
are required to catch a connecting flight through "remote" Denver. How things
change.

Fredriksen, Norway's richest man and largest investor in FRO.

DryShips and the Oil Rush
http://seekingalpha.com/article/70864-dryships-and-the-oil-rush

===============================================

My observation is that with the high price of oil, all shipping costs are
increasing and only the most efficient sectors are going to make money on the
margin. Both rail and the bulk cargo group are able to pass along their higher
operating expenses per unit of cargo shipped. The truckers and air freight
companies are in trouble as they are having a more difficult time passing on
their higher fees to the end user.

In a recent interview with the CEO of CSX, he stated their trains can haul the
equivalent cargo of 250 semi trucks with only a crew of two. Their sector is
much more efficient at the margin than the trucking industry and that is why
several of the rails are trading near their all time highs.

It will be interesting to see what happens as the price of oil continues to
increase. Will there be a transition to move more goods via rail and ship cargo
(bulk & container) or will the volume of items shipped just decrease due to the
higher costs.

Maybe at some point, new factories have to be built closer to the end users as
the high shipping fees just price the final product out of reach for the
intended user.

I am apalled by what I am hearing about some of the bailout. One of the items
is a tax credit for people buying houses in foreclure not only does that seems
completely discriminatory but may encourage people to go into foreclosure
deliberating as there increased incentive to default on ones own mortage let it
go into foreclosure and perhaps repurchase the property from the bank. If I am
a home owner trying to sell my house I am going to be absolutely livid at well
heeled banks given a further advantage over me. I m also seeing comments about
a government bailout of the banks in the works. I would rather see the fdic
take over banks then the taxpayer or government pay billions of dollars to keep
incompetent greedy managment in place and/or pay lifetime perks to these jerks.
It was not rocket science to figure out that giving people zero down mortgages
was going to lead to a bubble, contribute to overbuilding and then ultimately
stick someone with the tab when prices declined. Can we find competent
leadership somewhere?

if you liked that then you'll be reallymadharry at the $6B in tax breaks for
major builders so they can keep on adding to the oversupply. But hey, the
Senile-ate wants to give $100,000,000 to 50 states plus territories for
"counseling" to those losing their homes...

I figure that's about enough to set up a couple of offices in each state but
not staff them.

My understanding is they are letting them go back and deduct their losses
against previous profits and collect tax refunds. Meanwhile income averaging
for joe six pack was repealed in 1986. how about tax breaks for the newly
unemployed, congressmen?

here another good one courtesy of this weeks barrons. financial firms are now
allowed to book profits when the value of their own debt securities go down as
if they had repurchased them for less than than par even though they havent.
The barrons goes on to cite specific examples. apparently bear and stearns
profits would be going through the roof it this year if they could have
remained independent. oh well. Yet another lesson to be learned for people who
rely on p/e ratios to buy financial stocks.

Pargesa -
 These news are probably why I was not that interested in Pargesa. 
This logic seems a little strange. you don't buy Pargesa because you are
concerned about bad news from any of Pargesa's holdings/ by the way, Lafarge is
much less affected than CX from Venezuela's nationalization attempt and Lafarge
as a whole is only about reflects only about 22% of Pargesa's value, which
makes this almost rounding error for Pargesa's valuation - not so for CX.

EKS. Perhaps you saw very positive article on http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DRYS
in this week's Barron's. Couple of value investors mentioned in the writeup say
they like the stock for a buy.

A volatile stock, it now has moved away from my latest and highest buy point.

Another stock that seems similar to DRYS -- it too works the spot market and
its stock also seems volatile -- is http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=EXM . I'll
step up to that one now for a few-share buy to add to my small position.

EXM is buying the more conservative (long-term charter) QMAR. Apparently the
QMAR guy is going to be in charge of EXM. That might mean EXM will be run more
conservatively. Not sure if that would be a positive or negative for current
EXM shareholders. Anyway, when I penciled the numbers yesterday, EXM could be
bought a little cheaper by playing the spread and buying QMAR for conversion.
For now, for me, for my few shares, I'll just go directly for EXM.

Of course this also applies to WSC, various mutual funds and to lesser degree
to BRK.

Discount to NAV is of course attractive, but in these type of companies the
management competence is much more important and IMHO difficult to evaluate. If

Good article and a one that needs to be considered before investing into
Argentina.

Of course, another thing that needs to be remembered that there is little
institutional investment into any LA country except Brazil because the market
caps and floats are generally too small for large mutuals. This opens an
opportunity for individual investors, but it also may place one in situations
where local companies do not care about international investor interests.

Years ago I gave this stock to a friend when it was two dollars a share. It was
an old Jim Sheffied find from the old stock site the name of which I forget. I
sold it way back then too soon... in the ninties and then the friend told me
how much money she had made on it.

I bought back at 22 just last year and mentioned it here. Then sold it about a
month ago. Too soon again. (:(

CMG continues to roll upward and had not fallen back too far.
I don't own it but was waiting for it to hit what I thought might be a bottom.
.. it was and I missed it. Same for Apple computer... It hit a bottom. Who

Started a position in Brandywine Realty Trust (BDN). Company is selling below
BV according to Yahoo. Insiders have been buying at current prices and the
dividend appears solid at 9.9% at least for the foreseeable future.

My strategy is to build up a basket of REIT companies at or below BV that
generate good dividend income. Money is coming form low yielding treasury and
GNMA bonds to finance the purchase.

The two companies I have identified so far that meet this criteria are HRP and
BDN. Both companies are near their multi year lows and have significantly
underperformed the S&P 500.

I have positions in these:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=fpo+bdn+cli+fsp+lxp+olp+hrp

FSP is interesting because they pride themselves on having unleveraged real
estate properties. Problem is, or could be, that div. is partly based on their
making real estate sales. Not such great fun in a recession or down market.

Maybe LXP is worth a look for its possible safety (?) or conservative nature
(?): (From its website): "Lexington believes that its focus on net-leased
investments, under which the tenant pays all operating expenses, combined with
the diversification in the portfolio by geographical location, tenant industry
segment, lease term expirations and property type, creates predictable, stable
cash flow that supports a secure, growing dividend."

I am suffering with FUR which is supposedly well-managed. I have a losing
position in EDR: I like their niche business which is housing for college
students. I have MPW which is medical facilities.

Thanks for the list of REITs. I will update my watch list. You have an
uncannily way of setting up your buys at or near the lows (at least for the
stocks that are on my watch list).

It's interesting to note that for the REIT sector, there appears to be many
more insider buys now than sells (through March 2008) so perhaps this sector is
at or near its lows.

With Oil so high now, its hard to step up and buy more at these prices. In
fact, if the current run continues, I may begin peeling some shares off.

I expect a lot of new money to enter the market with treasury yields so low.
The key for me is to find undervalued assets that yield more than 2.8% (my
current credit union rate). It was yielding over 5% just six months ago.

You posted this Kiplinger's Stock Finder link awhile back. Excluding the banks,

ADTN - If you really want to own something in this space, IMO, you should buy
CSCO. Everyone else is most likely going to end up as a roadkill at some point
in time.

Tech is very bad place to be for relative values. IMO, there are few ways to
invest in tech:
- Supergrowth: GOOG at IPO, MSFT, GRMN, etc. in their growth phase. You have to
close your eyes to valuations though.
- Fallen supergrowth that will recover. ADBE when it fell in the 1999, usual
suspects in 2002, perhaps MSFT, GOOG, CSCO now.

Both groups above are usually Gorillas/Kings per Geoff Moore.

- Small cap niche players. These you can buy at supervalue prices and expect
them to recover.

The companies in the middle who are not G/Ks and not small and niche enough
usually end up dead. In the best case someone buys them, but this happens very
infrequently.

how this business is over and banks are having a big problem borrowing from
each other and nobody really knows how solvent they are. certainly not other
banks. if banks are reluctant to lend short term to other banks what does that
say about the investment quality of banks? Wont be long before people are
burying their money in their back yards. I dont think we will see a bottom
until we here about banks failing and people standing in line to take their
money out. the real estate situation continues to be bleak. And we havent even
seen the impact yet of all the layoffs in the real estate, financial, retail ,
and airlines yet. the stimulus package to me seems like the equivalent of
throwing out a life preserver to a guy in the atlantic ocean surrounded by
sharks, with the announcement that help may come at some point in the future.
Stigliz today on some network has the right idea. govt needs to step in and

CRESY -

I don't buy when I can't see the value, regardless of what other investors
(value or otherwise) are doing. When value oriented investors buy i listen and
try to see if i can follow their reasoning -sometimes i do and sometimes i
don't. Bill Miller was an acclaimed GAARP investor and pounding the table for
BSC, MBI CFC and where is he now? TAVIX bought into MBI (which still may work
out) and lost a good deal of money so far.

My reasoning is simple: if i buy something i need to understand it. If i
understand a stock I will be able to average down if the stock falls and i
believe i am correct, regardless of what other investors are doing. If i just
follow other investors without understanding what i am doing I am always going
to be too late in and too late out. So for me it would be better just to
purchase the investment vehicle that those investors are using (mutual fund,
holding company) rather than following their investment decisions.

1) Concentrated Closed End fund with a 30%+ discount to NAV
2) LT NAV appreciation beats comparative indices (CAC-40,BEL-20)

1) Unstable government (even more so than in most other LA countries)
2) high taxes for Cap gains, VAT etc.
3) Plenty of Government intervention, government is not business friendly
5) Roughly 10% inflation...

Not a great combination but i agree that Argentina has lot's of potential. they
just need to have the right government to make it happen. One day...

NRF is selling at 1.5 times last quarters book value, but is still selling at a
discount to next quarters book value. From the latest earnings release.

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/080228/nyth049.html?.v=101:

<<At December 31, 2007, diluted book value per common share was $5.70, and
undepreciated diluted book value per common share, pro forma for a preliminary
estimate of adopting SFAS 159, which NorthStar will adopt in its first quarter
2008 financial statements, was $11.00. This estimate is based upon fair values
as of January 1, 2008 and will more properly reflect the economic value of
NorthStar's assets and liabilities. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 159,
NorthStar marked its securities assets to market but was unable to also mark
its liabilities to market.>>

Are there other opportuntities like this where stated book value may provide a
good chance to steal some cheap shares? Wall street: you gotta love their
ingenuity <g>.

The government (taxpayers) should in no way fund special mortgages or bail out
deadbeats, whether the deadbeats are house "owners", bankers, or house
builders. If the government does so, it imperils its legitimacy.

the problem is if the government doesnt incentivize people with underwater
mortgages to stay in their homes there will be a cascading effect of people
turning in their homes causing prices to fall causing more people to turn in
their homes causing prices to continue to fall causing even less people willing
to buy a house that is likely to fall in value. I suppose the ultimate outcome
to this is that the costs of buying a house has to become even cheaper than the
cost of renting one. that might mean that most peoples homes go underwater.

If there is a cascade, or a washout of people selling their houses, then that's
great! Better a washout than a nation of zombie house occupiers who can only
get on because of a dole queue mortgage.

You are correct that there is a floor to house prices, which is when it is less
costly (in terms of cash flow) to own than to rent. But this is where housing
prices are going no matter what the government does. It can get there quickly,
or slowly. But isn't the slow route is more likely to alter consumer
psychology, and create a negative impression of real estate as an asset class?

If there is a wave of foreclosures and liquidations, someone will benefit.
Perhaps even a nice, frugal young couple who shunned buying a house until they
could really afford it.

I believe that laws and social norms should exist to reward such a couple, not
people who failed to see more than one month into the future.

BID looks good to me at current price and p/e. Not a bad price to pay for the
"brand" and franchise, imo. I don't see the debt as outrageous. I don't know
about short interest numbers. LTB&H should work, if management doesn't trash
company as happened with an earlier ceo. In recession, maybe people aren't so
willing to sell or buy art, but at some point every collector or his/her estate
will be sellers. The business for BID should be there, eventually.

I am in today for a few shares and intend to average down if/as shares continue
to fall.

BID - I am not sure I agree with the claim of "ballooning balance sheet during
the last 12 month". If you look at Yahoo http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=BID ,
both cash/receivables and current liabilities are seesawing - high in June/Dec
and low in March/Sep quarters. For me this just says that they had to close a
quarter immediately after large auctions or something and did not clear the
balance sheet. But OK, it may be worth digging deeper, although I am not sure
there will be any more definite answers. Let me know if you find something that
disagrees with the claim above.

I never considered short position to be indication of anything. Nowadays even
more, when every permabear is an oracle and every new shorter is an expert. I
can give you couple explanations off the cuff for short position: people think
that art market is peaking, people think that worldwide recession will bust art
market (this may be true if such recession happens, but I don't see worldwide
recession, I see worldwide investor panic, which is a different beast ;)),
people think that the Sotheby's realty is a bad business and will implode (if
it hasn't already).

But as I said, I welcome different information if you find time to dig into
this one. :) Or we can wait for Q1 report and see the situation there. Might
not be too late to buy after it. ;)

I own some CSCO, but I am not sure if I should buy more. There is a big
argument that most of CSCO's earnings go to fund its option largess. They are
buying back shares, but the share count is not shrinking, so they are pretty
much countering dilution from earnings.

This article is not totally accurate and against CSCO biased, but it is worth
reading:

BID: couple things from Q4 earnings transcript worth mentioning:
http://seekingalpha.com/article/66249-sotheby-s-q4-2007-earnings-call-transcrip
?source=yahoo

- They did not provide balance sheet in the Q4 PR and it was practically not
mentioned in the transcript. :( Need to look at 10K for it.
- They are buying their building for $340M. This may be negative if they are
overpaying.
- They will be paying off debt after building buy. After that they may buyback
shares but not earlier.
- They have off-balance-sheet liabilities: "price guarantees". Of course, they
claim that they only offer price guarantees when they see a good deal, but this
can lead to losses.
- As I mentioned, their international breadth in this cycle is huge and still
increasing. Still, there is no guarantees that they won't have a downturn.
- I think I was wrong about Sotheby's realty. Quote: "In February 2004, Realogy
Corporation, a global provider of real estate and relocation services, entered
into a long-term strategic alliance with Sotheby’s, the operator of the auction
house. The agreement provided for the licensing of the Sotheby’s International
Realty name and the development of a full franchise system by Realogy’s
subsidiary, Sotheby’s International Realty Affiliates LLC." So it looks like a
licensing deal and not a Sotheby's subsidiary, although there may be some kind
of participation (and potential losses) in the earnings.

Hi Paul,

Didn't know if you saw this which kind of puts a lid on FUR for at least a
little while.

"In light of recent market events and the average price of the Company's common
shares during the first quarter of 2008, the Company's Board of Trustees has
determined to waive the $5.02 anticipated minimum price set forth in the prior
release announcing the rights offering and has determined that the exercise
price for the rights will based on the Company's trading price for its common
shares prior to the April 11, 2008 record date but not less than $4.27 and not
more than $4.35 per share."

At least it appears they are willing to take part:

"The Company presently anticipates that it will enter into an agreement with
FUR Investors LLC ("FUR Investors"), an entity owned by the Company's executive
officers, and Fairholme Capital Management LLC and its affiliates
("Fairholme"), entities that are affiliated with Bruce Berkowitz, a former
trustee of the Company, pursuant to which FUR Investors and Fairholme will
agree, subject to completion of definitive documentation, to exercise their
basic subscription right in full (1,563,247 in total) as well as purchase all
unsubscribed common shares at the subscription price. As a result, it is
expected that the offering will be fully subscribed."

Hi Jurgis - Sold out of my small position in EWZ. I did not like that the index
pays their dividend once per year in December. I have done much better picking
individual Brazilian stocks (PBR, RIO, VCP ARA ELP) and would like to focus on
this strategy rather than using the index.

The EWZ index is quite volatile and I was able to net a 7.5% gain for the three
months I owned it.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=3m&s=EWZ&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=elp%2Cvcp%2Crio%2Cara%2
pbr

I like to hold a position for 2-3 years and study the individual company's
performance during this time. However I probably would not buy the EWZ index
again unless it provided me an immediate hedge to my portfolio or I was trying
to capture the small dividend in December.

EKS,

I still hold a very tiny bit of EWZ and some PBR, VCP and ELP. I agree that EWZ
offers very little value due to its very high ownership of PBR and RIO. In
essence if you want reasonable amounts of remaining Brazil stocks from the
index, you have to be very overweighed in PBR/RIO.

Hi Spekulatius - Started a small position in MSFT. Never owned the company but
have spent a lot of money on their software. I like that they have no debt,
generate tons of cash and for the first time ever their forward PE is below 13.
Their 1.5% dividend payout is just under the two year treasury rate of 1.8%.

The prospects of the Yahoo purchase is interesting. If they do land the deal
and can compete for a piece of the profitable internet ad revenues by taking
away share from GOOGLE, the future revenue growth prospectus are huge. Many of
the pundants say they are doomed to fail but I am willing to take the risk for
such a "value" entry point.

I added a few shares to my INTC position today to continue my theme of building
up my large cap global holdings. INTC did raise their dividend last month and
at a 2.6% yield is about the rate my credit union now pays.

Intel did announce a new $500 million China investment fund today. According to
their news release, The fund will invest in two new companies, Holdfast Online
Technology Co. Ltd., which provides a platform for third-party LAN-based video
game units, and Newauto Video Technology Inc., which makes and sells video
equipment, network solutions and system integration to television stations.

Intel has a Global presence with about 12% of the worldwide market. The company
should be able to grow their share over they next few years which hopefully
will translate into a higher stock price.

Its a little frustrating that insiders have been selling recently at these
levels. My 24-36 month price target is $30.
