Grommit, I agree with what you say here - but not necessarily with those stock
picks -g-.

Reasonable way to "protect" oneself is by being very diversified and having
positions in stocks with long earnings history and dividend payouts.

Anyhow, I assume it could be much worse for me if I didn't own some stocks like
that. Right now I feel I've been a holder of most blowups-- WCOM being the most
reported and today's ROXY being most recent.

I would also expect fund managers to start voting with their feet on

just didn't matter to investors and a lot of shady/sloppy practices came along.
Now for probably the next year or two there's gonna be a serious house cleaning

Apparently, people won't now pay as much as they have in past for companies

L: These stocks might quickly pop for a 15%+ gain if people believe they're now
oversold. But right now it doesn't seem likely to me that this will happen.
Since the trend is quickly down, maybe these stocks are going still lower-- the
downward pressure seems to be increasing.

I'm trying to build just a small position in L around these levels though. I
added a tad to my L position this am. My intent is to hold on for a couple of
years to see if Mr. Malone can deliver as he has in his past endeavors. (That's
my intent, although sometimes I can quickly get scared out of these complex
situations.)

There's a good write-up of another (typical?) cloudy Malone situation by

LTBG Bailed on my initial tiny purchase with small loss [8.70-8.32] today. What
I failed to look at and give sufficient weight to was insider selling @~10. The
industry is ugly. My thesis has been that LTBG, because of the nature of the
services [security & such] and superstrong balance sheet will be relatively
unaffected. The insider selling at levels not so far above current, gives me
pause. LTBG is thinly traded and repeated revelations could hit the stock hard.
Low price insider selling implies that things may be worse than appears.
Conditions have worsened since that selling took place -WCOM will reverberate
in the industry. I'm probably going to wait till either a real smash down to
the 5 or 6 range or tax-selling season for reentry.
Insider activity is no assurance [WCOM's Sullivan sold no shares, GHV's CB
bought heavily a few months before BK became obvious]...but I'm going to start

I couldn't agree more. It's hard to find companies who pass the hurdle of "some
insider buying", but a lower hurdle of "at least not a ridiculous amount of
selling", is prudent, IMHO. In the cases where I bought along with the
insiders, the worst case is ususally not too bad -- ususally, at the worst,
it's no gain and dead money for awhile. But after awhile, all bets are off. As
the insider buys age, their forecasting ability wears off.

exception - CHP http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=chp&d=0b Here's one where the
insiders continue to buy, while the stock is freshly dropping. So there are no
assurances.

Grommit, I looked at ANF and SVU, and decided neither one is for me right now.

I don't see ANF being at a bargain price, although it might well be. I have
been wrong about it before: missing out on its previous rise couple years ago
after several people here suggested it.

From what I can see, SVU is attractive because its expected p/e is relatively
low. Stock might very well trade much higher if those expected earnings
materialize. I don't have Wal-Mart, but I do have exposure now to each of the
other three giant national grocery chains. Size-wise, SVU seems like it's
between those larger chains and the smaller ones. In what I consider the
mid-size segment, I am only considering building up again my remnants of FLM.
My current focus has been mostly on the smaller chains. For example, SMF, to
which I'm weighing adding more shares to my starter position.

Yet no mainstream analyst could see beyond the then-current gloom. When they

I'll takes profits with and trim back my small position in AKZOY. No good

hard for me to hold on in this market.

Recently I've been buying - and have been wrong on - cable companies. I'll add
to my involvement in this sector now by starting a position in
Buffet's/Simpson's SJR. I'm assuming they're still in it. In which case my
entry point is lower than their purchase price (assuming they bought in the
open market).

I'll add to my losing position in AMR. Nobody likes these airlines, including
me. However, at a price which is now below the 9/11 area lows, I will assume
that if business prospects aren't worse than what people expected right after
9/11 (and those prospects might indeed be worse), the stock should be (but
doesn't have to be) near its lows.

I'll add to my losing position in AOL. Somewhere around here - but I don't know
where - Time Warner could be worth the stock price - assuming there's not too
much cockamayme accounting and the debt isn't overwhelming. Seems to me that
this behemoth company might still be a powerful force going out 10 or 20 years.
Maybe the company can regain investors' favor within the next couple of years.
Maybe I can hold on that long.

RE: EDS. I was surprised to see the amount of debt they carry. Then there's
this snip from
http://yahoo.smartmoney.com/onedaywonder/index.cfm?story=20020701&afl=yahoo 

Perhaps that's true. But EDS has a dual agreement with WorldCom â€” and this
could prove equally problematic. In 1999, it agreed to buy $6.0 billion of
WorldCom's network services over 11 years, either by itself or as a middleman
for customers. Under the contract, EDS is on the hook for upward of $600
million a year. EDS is obliged to pay $400 million a year, whether it buys that
much or not, and for amounts between $400 million and $600 million, EDS is
subject to a 20% penalty on any shortfall. So if EDS were to buy, say, $500
million worth of services in a given year, it would be forced to pay a $20
million penalty.

Analysts worry that many of EDS's clients will want to steer clear of WorldCom
now that its future is so bleak. "We think the ability to meet these minimums
is adversely impacted by WorldCom's current situation," admits EDS spokesman
Jeff Baum. But he says "we believe through negotiations we will be entitled to
some relief to some or all of those obligations."

As if this weren't enough bad enough, EDS on Monday ended talks for a
potentially huge contract with Procter & Gamble (PG) involving P&G's
human-resources and payroll systems. Investors didn't like any of this news,
sending EDS shares down 18% to an eight-year low of $30.45.

Paul,

Before you buy EDS, this is a recent company-wide email from EDS's IT head to
CEO Dick Brown:

From: Vervynckt, Lawrence

Sent: Thursday, June 13, 2002 4:10 PM
To: Brown, Dick (mail centre); Brown, Dick (Mail Box)
Cc: EDS Americas Employees; EDS Employees; EDS;
'presweb@pobox.upenn.edu'; NISC ALL EMPLOYEES
Subject: memo to Dick Brown

Dick,

There are ethical ways to cut costs, and then there is executive greed.
Your comment at the recent shareholder's meeting will be your legacy, like
it or not ("I have to make that much money, I have an expensive wife.").

Most of the people were proud to work for EDS and liked/like what they
do/did at one time, but no more. Most EDS employees made personal
sacrifices (eg. worked long hours, traveled extensively, worked weekends)
and that wasn't enough to keep their jobs.

It seems to me that your MBA is not worth the paper it is printed on. You
don't understand that all EDS has is its PEOPLE! It does not make ANYTHING!
Some clients have good working relationships with certain (ex)employees and
when you have a (mis)manager (that, by the way, couldn't manage his way out
of a paper bag) get rid of a person like that, then the client is very
unhappy - service slips, and bad feelings fester. I know, you will say the
'dashboard' doesn't show it. It's like the old saying - Those that can, do;
Those that can't, teach; and Those that can't teach, manage.

You have shown that you care only about short-term gains (and it ain't
happening right now) at the expense of long-term harm to the company. Some
people are being let go because they use the open door policy. Everyone
knows that if you complain about anything going on you're next in line to
be let go from the company. People are let go for 'workforce reduction' - NOT
performance (as you have said in the press), NOT because their skill sets
had slipped (as stated by Jim Daley in the press).

Dick, NO ONE believes you ANYMORE. Your memos are a laughing matter for
90% of the employees (the 10% are your 'yes-men' you have surrounding you).
Paydays are so stressful and tense, it is pathetic - the backstabbing of
employees to climb over each other is cannibalistic in nature - Is this
your new corporate culture? Because that is what's happening.

Talk to some of your former employees - they have nothing to lose by
telling you the truth - if you dare to talk to any of them, or if they
would talk to you. There are ways to save money that doesn't involve cutting
employees - But I will not list them here.

Here are some questions that I believe you should answer for the employees-

1) What are your IT contingency plans for third world unrest?

2) How can you justify your $55 Million Salary when the stock
price has not consistently been rising and remaining at levels close to or
above IBM? The answer you gave at the shareholder's meeting is unacceptable
and makes a mockery of the company.

3) Why has EDS not been at the forefront of Software
development? With the talent that existed (and still exists), surely some
revolutionary software could have been produced that would catapult EDS to
household name status.

4) Why is there no consistency of management practices between
accounts?

5) Why is it that you can visit Copenhagen, Fiji, Tokyo, or
Bremerhaven for the EDS image yet cannot visit Bethlehem, PA, Fairborn,
Ohio, Richmond, VA, St. Louis, MO, Winchester, KY, or South Carolina for
boosting employee morale?

6) Why are you so inaccessible to the average employee?

7) What is your corporate plan - In specific detail? I'm not
talking about the weekly Science Fiction newsletter that you produce. I'm
talking of YOUR Goals. Where are you leading this company? Where do you
envision EDS to be 5 years from now?
8) Are you aware of the discrepancy between your vision and the
vision and attitude of middle management? When will you get them on the
same page as yourself (provided you have a plan in place)? If you don't
realize,
middle management has a feudalistic approach to their employees and
accounts they manage. Many of their practices go against EDS corporate
directives.

9) If some accounts warrant H1B employees and outsourcing to
places such as Mexico, India, etc. why don't you discuss them with
employees and let them know what is going on (status of contracts, terms, etc)?

10) How is it that there is no coherent retraining policy within
EDS? If someone is currently on the bench, they have to fend for themselves
via EDS University with no clue as to what is available - what projects are
upcoming, what technologies are needed to make them billable once again.
For Example, an employee comes on the Bench. He/She is mainframe oriented.
There is a project coming up somewhere else that requires SAP. Shouldn't
management and yourself be responsible for guiding that employee in the
right direction so that they can get onto that SAP project and become
billable once again rather than have the employee slog their way through
online courses with no direction whatsoever.

11) You maintain that the IT industry is a very fluid culture.
Why is the company still adhering to IDP's? In the example of #10 above,
the employees IDP may not list SAP as a personal goal. However, if it were a
difference between being employed and not being employed, the employee
would definitely make the sacrifice and learn SAP. This makes the IDP useless.

12) Why does EDS still adhere to the "Bell Curve" for ranking
employees? This forced ranking is a failure and has proven such in many
school systems.

13) Why is it my Director has the autonomy to make significant
business decisions nationwide, yet a .50 cent raise request has to go to 3
levels above him to someone who has no clue regarding the validity of the
request?

14) Why are we, "the leaders in global technology solutions",
still using such as antiquated system as CAS?

15) Why does a staffing request to replace an entry-level, $8/hr
employee have to go all the way to Paul Chiapparone?

16) Ah yes - the forced ranking system. So - you have 5, highly
tenured, highly skilled leader-level employees. However, based on the
"rules", somebody is going to get screwed.

17) Why is it that we repeatedly hear the rhetoric of how valued
our employees are, and how we reward the top performers, yet a "1"
employee's raise request submitted 30 days prior to due, ends up
getting approved 3 month's late because it sat in multiple Upper
Management's "to-do" list too long.

18) Isn't it fraud (to your customers) to sell a contract using a
domestic model, then shifting processes (using personnel not involved in
the development of those processes) offshore, where work ethic and fundamental
service ideals are radically different from those sold as part of a contractual
obligation to a customer? (In traditional manufacturing industries, the
aforementioned practice is known as bait & switch)

19) Isn't is also fraud (to the stockholders) to form a shell
corporation (namely EDS Resource Management Corporation) for the sole
purpose of masking compensatory losses by way of transferring
personnel without their knowledge to this corporation prior to laying them
off, thereby operating that business at a loss, so as not to impact the
stock price of EDS?

20) Isn't it fraud (to your domestic labor force) to harness talent
and resources only long enough to construct process framework, only to
leave them high and dry without severance, then tie up their 401Ks (that in
some cases are propping up your stock price) for weeks on end?

21) Isn't it fraud (to your remaining domestic workforce) to tell
them that their jobs are secure, provided their performance and production
is up to EDS's "high standards (until you have their functions documented
and shifted to cheaper labor)? --- If you have answers to any of these

Looks like I was too early in taking some profits in Garan last year. Mr.
Buffett now wants the rest of my shares:

http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/020702/manufacturing_garan_1.html

Thanks again to whomever it was who mentioned that stock a couple years ago.

And again, mixed emotions about being involved in a deal with Mr. Buffett.
Happy, that I could be in at much lower price, and that the value - at a higher
price - has been recognized by him. Sort of frustrated in that the deal isn't
really that great imo (for us Garan stockholders). -- Not paying a big premium
seems typical of Mr. Buffett. And also, I'm sorry and disappointed that perhaps
I really do not know - and maybe don't even have a clue - about what I own from
a Buffettology perspective. If I did, I guess I might've or should've been
adding to the position last year, not selling for smaller profits.

Safeway is one I had an order in on some put options a few weeks ago which
didn't fill at the price I wanted. It looks like I should have gone in at
market. They play a lot of games with pro forma accounting to get the PE up to
10, and the GAAP doesn't look all that hot either.

For example; a year ago they reported something like .76 for their December
quarter, but actually had the nerve to pro forma in earnings they thought they
should have had if there hadn't been a strike, which affected their numbers by
close to .20. On a nation wide basis, they open, close and remodel stores on
almost a daily basis. For all practical purposes, it's a current business
expense. It goes on the books as depreciation at nowhere near the rate the
costs are incurred.

In this market debt to equity is the acid test for value. The pat answer that,
"We are borrowing all that money to invest in the future of our company.",
should be a red flag to anyone who got caught on ENE, KM, or WCOM. If these
companies had ever been as profitable as they led everyone to believe, they
would have had a ton of cash on the balance sheet instead of debt. Accounting
abuse is endemic in US markets. The majority of companies in the S&P 500 are in
the index through the manipulation of GAAP. There's a massive head and
shoulders formed in the Dow 30 and the NASDAQ 100 just busted through September
support levels. I wouldn't be surprised to see the Dow below 6000 before
another year passes.

I ran across this article and thought the thread might find it interesting as

When the top fund managers can't hit enough winners to show a profit, it's not
the picks, it's the market. Right now it's almost as easy to make money on
short play as it was to make money on dot.coms in 97. Just close your eyes and
pick something, it's almost a sure bet it will go down. IMO, the "obscene value

Anyone here taking an interest in crashed microcap

Don Earl: I don't believe the predictions or explanations of SWY management

tiny corner of the world - we're about saturated with grocery stores. And the
days of 10-15% growth are gone in today's Costco/Wal-Mart/ABS/KR tough
competitive environment. Imo, they will all be trying to take market share from
each other - and that's not a good thing for investors.

I'll bet that the $2.80 (approx.) earnings estimate holds though. That's a
drop, but it could be doable. And a p/e of 10 might be sustainable. If there is
an earnings improvement over than next year, or if people become willing to pay
more for a "presumed" "stable" business, the p/e could rise.

On the other hand, it could drop - everywhere where companies have earnings,
p/e's seem to be going lower - and SWY might warn again on earnings. So the
stock might very well be a short from here.

I'm holding my small position and trying to look to the next 12 months.

MIR_pa seems like a good value here, under 25. Yields 12%, and is worth $50 at

I believe MIR will survive, even though it is being taken to the woodshed

have more upside (with stated book value at $13, including goodwill), but

I don't know that SWY is necessarily a good short at these levels. It's more I
don't trust their numbers and the chart looks horrible. I think if I were going
to play it at current prices, a straddle with slightly out of the money options
might work. Maybe go out to January with puts at $25 and calls at $30. It would
cost about $4.20 per share to play it that way. If it really is under valued,
the calls should be in the money before they expire. If the down trend
continues, the puts should be in the money.

Something like that anyhow. I think I'd try to figure out a way to hedge my bet
just in case.

London Pacific ADRs halted by NYSE pending review

NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange said it halted trading
on the American depositary receipts of London Pacific Life & Annuity Co.
(NYSE:LDP - News) and was reviewing its listing status after the insurer was
placed under supervision by North Carolina regualators.

The Exchange said in a statement on Wednesday that the ADRs of the U.S. life
insurance subsidiary of London Pacific Group Ltd (London:LPG.L - News) would
remain halted until the review was completed.

London Pacific said on Wednesday it was placed under supervision by the North
Carolina Department of Insurance, but did not provide further details.

In mid-June, the company executed a one-for-10 reverse split on its shares to
be in compliance with the NYSE's minimum listing requirement of $1 per share
over a 30-day trading period. The NYSE said the company now met this
requirement as well as its requirement of a market capitalization of $50
million over 30 days.

The ADRs of London Pacific closed at 96 cents on Wednesday on the NYSE.

Wondering if there are any articular sectors anyone else likes right now.
Energy and utility have a few good names beaten down due to concerns over debt

Welcome to Value Investing thread. Hope I did not
scare you from the G&K thread. ;-) G&Ks are
great companies and worth buying at the right prices.

Out of the stocks you mention, I think C is close
to a buy point with expected annual return of ~14%
if it maintains 17% ROE. If not, returns are lower.

I don't have much comment on the others.
I only invest in companies that have >15% ROE for >5
years and <.8 (often <.5) in debt/equity, which
leaves ALD, C, FBF, FRE and EV. I'll let you know
if I look at these.

BTW, there was a writeup on ALD here:
http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2002/foth020626.htm
It has some good points on investing in financials
and why I usually avoid financial companies.
There are exceptions though such as
Berkshire Hathaway and Wesco. C, FRE, maybe FBF
may be also worthwhile investments.

Dstange,

I follow Buffettology approach
where I select the company first based on its
leadership position, hopefully deep moat, brand
value and so on. Then I check that the company
satisfies my requirements of 15% ROE for at least
5 years and low debt/equity (<.5 most of the times).
Then I perform the calculation using Buffettology
spreadsheet and buy the stock if it promises >15%
annualized return.

The toughest parts in this approach are evaluating
whether the company satisfies soft Buffett criteria.
E.g. does C have a significant enough moat and leadership
over other banks? Also nowadays it is quite difficult
to evaluate future ROEs. I think I have only one holding
that BRK/GEICO also had: JNY.

I do not look at PEs, p/cash flow, p/book. In this thread
there are people who use these criteria and are
much more knowledgeable about them than I am.
I own some TAVFX for the deep value investing.

BTW, I looked at FNM and FRE and they offer very
attractive returns if one overlooks their debt/equity.
I understand that their debt is not conventional, since
their are buying and reselling mortgages, but this
high leverage is a bit troubling. Buffett & Munger
exited FRE position because of this.

As one of those who didn't lose much except some bubble profits in the Naz drop

value investing takes patience, judgment, discipline and a real willingness to
ignore the headlines and dig into dark, unloved corners of the market.

extra careful with SUNW. I would not touch the others.

I think INTC, ORCL and CSCO are more likely candidates.
I commented recently on INTC on G&K board. ORCL and

I agree that value investing is not a simple formula

But then G&K is not simple either.

G&K may have become "momentum" play in the bubble,
but it is not necessarily so. I know that I personally
have looked at some G&Ks at value prices back around
1996-97 and passed for some stupid reasons (I was
trading too much back then). If I had
the framework of evaluating the competitive advantages
of G&Ks at the time, I would perhaps be richer now.

Think of it this way: G&K is Buffettology for tech.
As in real Buffettology, valuation matters, but company
selection - G&K vetting process - matters even more.
That's why I am hesitant to buy SUNW at any price.

Plenty of value investors had their heads handed to them on a plate in the IPP
stocks this year. The low forward PE's are valid only if the E numbers are
accurate.

You never believe earnings numbers for tech stocks, and the IPP sector has
proven itself full of cook-the-books artists. Why believe these guys instead?

My only holding here is DUK. They make their money with real energy assets, not
the trading desk.

Combine the end of trading profits with a soft energy market and you get a
recipe for a sector slide. Should turn around eventually (a year? two?), but in
the meantime these shares are likely to continue to wallow in single digits.

JMHO. I spent most of this year trying NOT to be in sectors going down, saved
me a ton of money compared to last year's slide into the fall lows.

Anybody have any opinions on TRCI?

I bought some today as it hit my target of $1.27. By my calculations, it has
PosFCF of about $.37/share; NetNet value of about $2.30/share; current ratio
7.37; Interest coverage of 4.73.

They manufacture and sell Ground Fault Interupt Circuits (GFIC) and other types
of electrical devices. They used to sell exclusively to the military until the
cut-backs started in 1989. They redirected their sales efforts, survived that
experience and now the military is about 35% of revenues.

They also pay 4 cents/share dividend, which at this price is a bit over 3%
yield.

The number of diluted shares in 1995 was 5.34million and today stands at
5.458million. So they haven't gone crazy with stock options.

Be interested in reading any feedback or in engaging in any discussion of TRCI.

Picked up some NT today at 1.33. Sold covered calls for protection/income Jan
04 2.50 calls for 0.45 which leaves nearly 100 % upside potential. So far my
buying of crushed stocks and selling (relatively) rich calls has been a good
predictor of further >50 % downside in stock prices.

Grommit,

I was collecting preferreds some time ago when they were trading at a discount
and no one wanted them. I am very careful with preferreds as I want preferreds
of companies that are required for human survival because of a potential
problematic economy . I like top of the line oil companies that have great
resources. Also energy companies that are still regulated and have debt to
equity less than 1. (A Graham requirement for investing in this sector.)

Recently got a call on one of my preferreds that was paying 8.25% and am
looking for a replacement.

I bought FR at its low after the S%L crises. I have not looked at them for a
while, but I sold it ahead of Warren because they were paying above replacement
costs for properties.

Don't know if this fits your criteria : Royal Dutch.
It's down over 9% today due to being dropped from the S&P 500. Pays about 3.7%
dividend. Don't think they're going broke anytime soon.

Doug,

Thanks, I noticed RD is getting hit. Am going to spend some time looking at the
financials tomorrow. One oil/NG company stock I like is BR, but want to buy a
first third around 30.

A couple of high yield ideas is NAT and VLCCF. I do own both of these. NAT has
a contract with BP that guarantees a minimum dividend. This contract has a
couple of years left and will watch closely to see if it get renewed.

Edit - also some of these oil companies have some high yield preferreds above
8%. TLM is one but they are trading at a premium these days and will wait for
values closer to par.

Disclosure - own TLM preferred a.

steve,

The preferred stocks that I have been buying are like bonds in that they are
sold at a par - normally $25 at a set yield. They are traded on the stock
exchanges. The bond holders have 1st rights to the assets of the corporation
and the preferred holders have 2nd rights then come the equity holders.

The preferreds trade at a premium or discount to par and right now the high
yield preferreds of good companies are trading at a premium.

One has be careful because some of these preferreds can be called so there is a
risk of losing capital when paying a premium. Some preferreds have a date when
they can be called. The preferreds are rated and you can go to S%P to see what
risk the debt rating agencies have given the issues.

Portrait of a sector:

PNM Resources (PNM:NYSE - news - commentary - research - analysis) set the tone
by slashing its second-quarter guidance in half and its full-year earnings
expectations by nearly one-third. The Albuquerque, N.M., company blamed its
sharp downturn on low wholesale power prices and ongoing problems in the energy
trading sector.

Investors responded to PNM's news, issued after Tuesday's market close, by
pounding the stock to a price unseen in more than two years. It closed with a
$3.50 loss at $18.92.

PNM Chief Executive Jeff Sterba predicted little chance of a rebound before
year's end.

"Although the PNM electric utility continues to perform well, the depressed
level of wholesale energy prices in the West, coupled with the significantly
decreased trading activity in that market, has severely limited the potential
of our power marketing arm so far this year," Sterba said. "We are lowering our
earnings expectations because it appears increasingly likely that these adverse
conditions will persist through the end of 2002."

The company is now predicting second-quarter earnings of 25 cents a share and
full-year earnings of $1.90 to $2.10. Analysts were expecting 53 cents and
$2.64 for those periods.

Following PNM's reduced guidance, both Banc of America Securities and Merrill
Lynch downgraded the stock.

Banc of America now rates the stock market performer instead of buy. In a
research note issued Tuesday, analyst Shelby Tucker said he expects PNM to
deliver "historical average utility earnings levels with no credit given for
power marketing." He lowered his PNM earnings guidance from $2.75 to $1.90 for
2002 and from $3 to $2 for 2003.

Similarly, Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Fleishman downgraded PNM from
buy/strong buy to neutral/buy.

While PNM bore the brunt of Wednesday's punishment, companies throughout the
sector -- even favorites like Duke (DKE:NYSE - news - commentary - research -
analysis) -- suffered a beating. Following its own downgrade, Duke tumbled
$1.60 to finish Wednesday at a 52-week low of $19.95. (WRONG, DUK closed at 26,
still a 52-week low)

One Houston energy analyst described the market's current reaction to utility
stocks as irrational.

"Duke started to get in trouble yesterday because of a few minor issues with
the Public Utility Commission," said John Olson, an analyst at Sanders Morris
Harris who owns stock in the North Carolina company. "That created just enough
of a spark to launch what turned out to be a forest fire."

Olson went on to say that the entire stock market continues to be darkened by
accounting scandals and mounting investor suspicions.

"Every sector in the market is being affected by headline risk," he said. "And
when you have that kind of climate, the short sellers just have a field day.

"They tend to badmouth everybody."

Several energy trading companies continued to be favorite targets Wednesday.
Mirant (MIR:NYSE - news - commentary - research - analysis) emerged as the
hardest hit, tumbling 72 cents to a new low of $4.29.

Lasan Johong, an analyst at Blaylock & Partners, speculated that investors are
growing increasingly nervous about Mirant's ability to renew a revolving credit
facility set to expire next week. In addition, he said, they could be bracing
themselves for bad news about Mirant's energy trading practices in California.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to report its findings on
the California trading practices of many companies later this month.

"Everybody is waiting to see who FERC will declare as the culprits," Johong
said. "Mirant is potentially still one of them."

Johong, who doesn't own the stock, has a buy rating and $23 price target for
Mirant.

Wednesday's other battered energy stocks included: Dominion (D:NYSE - news -
commentary - research - analysis), down $3.43 to $59.71; Entergy (ETR:NYSE -
news - commentary - research - analysis), down $2.48 to $38.77; Reliant
(REI:NYSE - news - commentary - research - analysis), down 85 cents to $15.30;
Calpine (CPN:NYSE - news - commentary - research - analysis), down 53 cents to
$5.35; and Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news - commentary - research - analysis), down 49
cents to $5.66.

Back to our discussion on value investing - perhaps we should emphasize the
value investing traits needed most in a bear market.

MAXF is a portrait of great valuation ratios that also outperforms most
competitors in its sector, even though the stock isn't up much for the year:

I was talking to someone who considers himself a rather "unsophisticated"
investor. At the present time, this person is completely turned off by the
stock market in general b/c this person believes that he cannot trust the
financial statements. Therefore, if you can't trust the financial statements
and if you don't know whether or not the company's earnings are "real", you
might as well be trading baseball cards or beanie babies.

In some ways, I agree. I believe that the market will be dead for a couple of
years.

In the long run, we will find that most companies - like most people - are
basically pretty honest, but the huge ripoff artists created an atmosphere
where everyone is under suspicion. Consider the security you go through at the
airport now because of a few incidents.

Certainly, an important "value" criteria now has to be proven integrity from
management. Any whiff of doubt, blow it out and move on, IMHO.

(You can tell I don't own any TYC and don't plan to)

The pain this month has been to watch companies with quality management get
nailed in the general rush for the exits.

When the "common man" investor has given up completely, that will really be
time to load up for a multi-year value investor.

Agree with you 100%. I, too, do not own Tyco, but have been tempted. But, I go

black cloud of accounting scandal over it"

While I do agree that more than 50% of publicly traded companies are "fairly"
honest, I still believe that more accounting scandals will be known.

I haven't reviewed anything but Yahoo profile, but on there it looks to me like
MAXF's officers are taking the lion's share of the profits. When I see that, I
usually don't look further because it indicates to me that they value
themselves more than the shareholder.

What is it about this company that you see that over-rides that concern?

Even after all MAXF's expenses, they produce real profits and cash flow over $1
per share, and the stock trades at 5.50 now. In the boutique securities biz,
your people are your main asset, so I don't concern myself much if they are
paid well.

In addition, MAXF brought in several new players to build new divisions. It
will take time since the industry is in a deep funk - but long-term, MAXF has
the potential to grow very nicely.

In the meantime the PE is low, book value around $5 and most of that is cash.

Not that value matters in the current market climate (panic selling). But it
will eventually.

HRC: Started position 2 days ago @10.91, added to it today on crash - current

selling [@higher levels ~14], this is a lesson I'm destined to relearn,
apparently. I've seen nothing to justify this panic sell-off, but may again be
taught that buying a falling knife is a bad idea despite appearance of being
undervalued.

to be hurting the stock, as are some vague accounting rumors, though with
regard to the latter, it's difficult these days to determine whether the stock
