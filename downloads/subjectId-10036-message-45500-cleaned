You are right on both counts. If the company does not grow and pays out
everything, it does not matter whether you bought 16%ROE@1PB or 8%ROE@.5B. You
are also right that the ROE-based reinvestment/growth metric is very inexact
for a lot of companies.

However, I still prefer the high ROE companies for couple reasons:
- High ROE may indicate moat (not always)
- High ROE gives management more flexibility where to put the CF. As you said,
this might be positive - in case of Buffett - or negative in case of
Intel/HP/etc. overpriced acquisitions.
- Pretty much no companies pay out everything, so as above it's better to have
high ROE.
- High ROE gives me more confidence to hold on the stock even if business
declines/etc. I am not good at holding marginal companies as they fluctuate.
- Like Paul Senior says, I look to discard companies, not to include more of
them. Even with high ROE requirement, I hold ~60 positions. I don't want to
have 300 positions by buying every company in the universe. Sorry, Paul. ;)

On the other side, I can miss turnarounds/snapbacks where a marginal company
goes to (cyclical) trough and then runs up 2x as its fortune turns.

I hold one or two NCAV positions, some E&Ps and some (re)insurance companies
where the high ROE requirement is violated. So far, not much success with
NCAVs, big success with E&Ps coming from 2009 bottom and mixed success with
(re)insurance.

ConocoPhillips to sell $2 billion in pipeline assets

Houston-based ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) will sell its interests in two U.S.
pipeline companies for $2 billion.
http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/morning_call/2011/11/conocophillips-to-sell-

The company said Wednesday it will sell its 16.55 percent interest in Colonial
Pipeline Co. and Colonial Ventures LLC to a subsidiary of Caisse de Depot et

Conoco will also sell its stake in the Seaway Crude Pipeline Co. to a unit of
Enbridge Inc.

Wonder what they plan to do w/ the $2B. That was a valuable asset so I would

they do not over pay. They have upwards of $10B in cash to invest.

In case of HPQ, the issue is not GW/IA in ROE, the issue is how much business
it lost (and will lose) during the management debacle, how much restructuring
costs will be there and how much it will lose from overpaying for Autonomy. If
you think that all of the above are small/immaterial, then HPQ is a (great)

Sergio,

WILC seems like a classic Graham stock to me. Ample cash, below book, solid
earnings history. Over the past 10 years they have consistently made money,
with no negative years and average earnings of 0.39 per share, resulting in a
PE of 14.25 based on current and price and the 10-year average earnings. Given
the high cash balance and current solid earnings, it seems like a stock both
with good prospects and a good margin of safety.

The main thing that worries me is that I don't understand why it is so cheap.
Usually I understand why a stock is cheap. If I don't, I worry that I am
missing something important. Possible concerns on Iran-Israel conflict? I
noticed they did a secondary offering just above 6 early in 2010 (that seemed
pretty pointless, as they haven't spent the cash). I would think that this
could leave a tax loss selling overhang in 2010, but not in 2011.

WILC

Their cash holding is mostly from the secondary offering. They had hired a
consultant and were advised to pursue an acquisition which would give the co.
and entry point into the U.S. market. Management apparently changed their mind
and still have the cash. I think the main reason that it remains cheap is
mistrust of management and what they will do with the cash.

Buying back their own shares does not appear to me to be the best idea since
their float is tiny and insiders own more than half of the shares it makes the
stock more illiquid and less attractive to institutional investors. I would
love to see them use their free cash flow to establish a regular dividend.
There was talk at the last conference call of issuing a special dividend with
the cash.

I don't see much downside risk and I am willing to hold and wait.

I have not followed WILC and I hate to generalize, but Israeli management
decisions leave a lot to be desired.

MAIL-changed-to-PERI had a lot of cash and FCF and decided to cancel a divvie
and do an acquisition that may or may not work out. The stock is down ~40%
since the acquisition.

MNDO had the "great" investment of their cash hoard into CDOs - later refunded
(?) after lawsuit with Merrill (?). Some MNDO investors made out fine, some not
so...

It seems that the common theme is building a successful cash-cow niche company
and then having zero clue where to put the resulting cash... They need Buffett

divvies plus a ton of capital appreciation. No complaints here.

I still own some a little MNDO. I think nobody (except me :) bought my

0.80 special divvy on the CDO settlement).

Here is my recommendation from Feb 2009

Sergio,

With a stock this cheap, I think they have to take some out of the market
(i.e., buyback). A buyback is accretive to book value and earnings. It still
trades 20k shares a day -- I doubt a buyback will put that much of a dent into.
10-20k shares volume is enough for me, although I am ok with owning roach motel
stocks.

I don't think institutional investors will every get that interested in this,
unless the company sells more stock or insiders sell out their stock, which
would lead to a seconday offering that would beat up the price and possibly
dilute shareholders.

I am not that opinionated on it, though. A regular or special dividend would be
fine too.

I will treat Goodwill differently.

Unlike tangible assets (e.g. a machinery) and intangibles (e.g. a broadcast
license), goodwill is not some capital locked inside the business in order to
generate the profit.

What if I were to rewrite GAAP and say: instead of creating a goodwill entry in
the book, you need to treat that portion of the acquisition cost as an expense
paid to the business seller when you acquire a buisness? If you look at it that
way, goodwill should be subtracted when calculating ROE.

It makes sense. However, let me ask you this: did your calculations lead you to

Any numerical adjustment comes with the cost of time to make it multiplied by

its worth. ;)

Theoretical vs Practical. That's one good question, Jurgis.

Not yet. But I reckon the adjustment gives a better picture of the
profitability of the operation of a business.

Similarly, I haven't yet found a good net-net with the NACV calculation. But it
doesn't invalidate the principle.

That said, now come to think about it, if a mgmt does waste money in an
acquisition and since the mgmt is an integral part of the business, I also need
to "adjust" my valuation of the business downward. But this is not some
financial figures I can adjust. So if I say I simply do my goodwill adjustment,
that's misleading. In the quality side of my analysis, I've also discounted the
ability of the mgmt. There are indeed a lot of subjective judgments/adjustments
going on.

p.s. Btw, I was referring to one-off acquisition. If a company is growing by
constant acquisitions, I realise I also need to subtract the goodwill from the
profit (because it's an expense now). So both numerator and denominator in the
ROE need adjustment. That does look messy.

re GS - about half a year ago, we had an exchange on GS and were on opposite
sides
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27496317&srchtxt=GS

I was more bullish then and you were skeptical. you turned out to be correct
but not for the right reasons - the reason GS stock is down is because the
earnings outlooks sucks - they are supposed to make 5$/share now versus
12-15$/share then and next year may not look much better.
I agree that tangible book value and GS good risk management are positives but
it's not clear to me if they can make 20$ in earnings /share like they did
around 2005 (with half their current book value).

I believe that proprietary trading is dead and that is where GS used to excel.
It will be interesting to see, if they keep the bank holding umbrella or not.
if they drop it, they loose access to short term funding from the Fed, which is
very handy in emergencies. Without access to the FED window, they need to
restructure their liability side and and refinance LT, which is going to cost
them, or roll the dice that nothing bad happens in the financial system.

I don't know, i see a broken business case much more so than a tarnished
reputation ( which is a factor too). They need to restructure imo and
dramatically reduce the size of their balance sheet, imo. it will mean less
earnings for the stub GS but since it is trading below tangible book, this may
well result in a windfall for shareholders if done on an elective basis. If
it's done in a pinch, probably not.

I think I am buying into this, if a scare in the financial markets breaks out
and GS goes much lower. Right now, I am not buying any financial, unless a
scare breaks out and we see lower prices ( a fairly high probability event,
imo).

Typically a business selling at a low p/b has low margins and its share price
reflect a low multiple. An 8 ROE is below the avg and it indicates its in a
price competitive business. An 18 ROE is above avg and it indicates the
business is being run correctly and/or has protective moat. Remember to also
look at ROTC along with ROE. High ROE could be gained by taking out a lot of
bank debt.

Buffett investment in IBM, IMO, suggest that there is some opportunities in
large cap tech. Large cap tech have been essentially flat the past decade.
Being in IT, IBM blows away HP in software and Hardware. Working with both I
can tell you that IBM has highly skilled personnel in R&D because of
functionality and ease of use of their backend servers and software. Which
could explain why the HW/SW is more expensive. Also, IBM services business are
highly skill consulting people compared to HP. Almost like comparing Goldman
Sachs to Etrade( not to that extreme but you get the idea).

With that said HP is still a better buy based on many multiples. Buffett
invested in IBM because he has an elephant gun and it takes an elephant to move
buffett Billions. His $10 billion investment in IBM would be 20% of HPQ which
would cause accounting and tax issues that he does not want.

Hi Sergio -

Some what OT - Where's the value play (or what companies gain value) if we see
a strong U.S. dollar trend for the next several years?

I say this based on next week's 'Super Committee' Nov. 23: Deadline for the
committee to vote on a plan with $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction.(Timeline
to Reduce the Budget Deficit:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27761685 ). These cuts will
cover the next 10 years and represent a significant change of trend IF real
cuts are approved.

This will result in a stronger U.S. dollar compared to many other foreign
currencies and will impact the "Value" of companies that can generate
significant FCF in U.S. dollars. In addition, companies that own debt that must
be paid back in U.S. dollars are at a disadvantage if their products or
services collect non U.S. dollars.

I have been putting together a list of those companies (mostly domestic U.S.
companies) that fit this category. A few already meet my value criteria but
there are many others I probably have over looked. Let's start naming a few
candidates and see if they would be the beneficiaries of an added value pop if
the U.S. dollar gets stronger.

Here is my contribution:

Waste Management, Inc. Common S(NYSE: WM )
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=WM+Key+Statistics

Forward PE at 13, dividend yield 4.3%, LT debt is 2x the amount I would like
based on annual net income BUT all income is invoiced in U.S. dollars. Their
fleet of truck (their major operating expense) is working towards converting
their trucks to run on NG. Disposal sites are being converted to capture
methane generated from the waste which is used to generate electricity to run
their facilities. It's a well integrated system being transformed for the 21st
century.

Almost $1B of U.S. dollars that increase in value for possible foreign
acquisitions. They already have operations in China which could be expanded.

I also like several of the domestic E&P companies in a rising U.S. dollar
environment. There must be other candidate companies.

I think you are on the wrong track looking for a stronger US$. For one thing,
there is no direct correlation between the federal deficit and the exchange
rate. Exchange rates are driven by money streams from investments (driven by
interest rate differentials or opportunity for investments) and trade balances.
Looks for example to Japan - the Yen is at an historic high against the US$ and
Euro but the Japanese federal deficit is extremely high. The latter does not
matter because it is financed internally and the strong export surplus creates
a steady stream for forex reserves that keeps the yen high. What makes you
think that the US$ will grow stronger if the federal deficit is reduced.

There are secondary effects - the federal deficit is 8.5-9% of GNP in the US$,
representing excess spending that will be evaporate if the deficit is cut to
zero - take this spending away all of a sudden and you have the mother of all
recessions. This of course would reduce imports and reduce the trade deficit
for the US somewhat strengthen the US$. However my moniker states already that
Mr. Bubbles will pull all levers available and then some to make sure that this
does not happen. in any case if this were to happen, all the stocks that you
are looking at are going to be much much cheaper.

Sadly enough, I think that exactly this is going to happen, except in slow
dribbles rather than in one big chunk. This means that we are going to have a
1% negative GNP growth headwind for roughly a decade and possibly more if you
believe in multiplier effects as Keynes did. This is the semi optimistic view -
the pessimistic view is that the bond vigilantes will go to the US after they
are done with Italy and we get a heavy dose of austerity with all the nasty
side effects will be forced upon us in a hurry.

There is an optimistic scenario too - that Mr. Bubbles can play tricks with the
Fed balance sheet forever and we can print our way into prosperity after all we

I don't have strong opinion about its patents or numbers. Expansion to optical
was probably diworsefication trying to spend the cash they got from semi
packaging.

Possible outcomes:
- Buyout.
- They develop new tech/patents and get a boost from that.
- Their current tech falls by wayside with no replacement
- They buy even more cos/tech to expand

It is somewhat attractive at $10-12 level, since cash provides the downside
protection as long as they don't spend it on acquisitions. At current levels it
really becomes a speculation on the success of their business.

My best bet for a "credit event" would be that an Italian bank (Unicredit?) is
going to croak - these 7% bond yield for Italian debt are really going to hurt.
They are already massively borrowing from the ECB for liquidity. Once that is
exhausted, i believe the only alternative would be nationalization since the
bank recap apparently is going nowhere.

Once one Italian bank goes, they all (or at least most) will go, imo.

Hi Sergio -

Waste Management, Inc. Common S(NYSE: WM )

This is one on my buy list below $30.00/share. You have to look a bit outside
the box where their past operating figures just do not represent their
"possible" future efficiencies. What if the company could operate their fleet
of trucks at 50% of what it cost them in the past?

Would the company appear to you to be more valuable? Their FCF numbers would
certainly increase as well as their net income.

WM to convert Columbus, Ohio, fleet to CNG
http://www.wasterecyclingnews.com/rss2.html?id=1315926926

This is happening across the US in many of the WM service areas. The company is
working on converting their fleet of diesel trucks to NG. This is being done
w/o any government subside. It just makes economic sense (ie excellent ROI).

I suspect this will become a longer term trend over time. This is one of these
transforming "disruptive" technologies that makes several of these companies
more efficient. Many of the pieces are already in place (like cheap NG from
domestic shale) and efficient NG engines. This type of conversion should be
done in our rail fleets too.

For Waste Management, they will see significant cost savings over time as they
complete more of these conversions over time. The company is also looking at
new incineration technologies to reduce land fill waste and generate
electricity. There are a lot of efficiency gains to be achieved in many of
their operations as new types of technologies are integrated into their daily
operations.

Just "Google" Waste Management and Natural Gas and co-generation and waste
disposal. This is a huge industry where waste collected now becomes a useful
fuel and when processed through a more integrated system can create methane
gas, generate electricity and even create fresh organic compost that is sold
back to their customers.

I think we are just beginning to see us reinvent some of these old
companies/industries (it's always been done this way mentality) into very
efficient 21st century integrated processing centers.

Since the fuel costs are currently passed through the customer, switching to
cheaper NG should not impact profit margins much. Here is an excerpt from WM
10k:
 Revenue predominantly generated by our fuel surcharge program increased by $69
million and decreased by $328 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and
2009, respectively. The fluctuation is directly attributed to the fluctuation
in the national average prices of diesel fuel that we use for our fuel
surcharge program. The mandated fees included in this line item are primarily
related to the pass-through to customers of fees and taxes assessed by various
state, county and municipal governmental agencies at our landfills and transfer
stations. 

I am not stating it's a good idea to convert WM diesel truck fleet to NG, I
just don't think it's going lead to a huge profit margin increase.

Republic Services, Inc. Common (NYSE: RSG )
Waste Management, Inc. Common S(NYSE: WM) 

It's hard for me to think that WM will not see a significant cost savings
(eventually) by switching their truck fleet to NG, I have not studied the
annual reports for WM but when I researched this industry two years ago both
Republic Services, Inc. Common (NYSE: RSG ) and Waste Management, Inc. Common
S(NYSE: WM) were the two companies that appeared to be the industry leaders to
consider.
http://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/RSG,WM/view/dv;_ylt=Av6JPN.lKRGIITqdIEeS4jQLv7g
;_ylu=X3oDMTExYzFvNTI2BHBvcwM0BHNlYwN5ZmlUYWJsaXN0BHNsawNkZXRhaWxlZA--

They both operate in a regulated industry (quasi monopoly). They can increase
customer rates pretty easily to recover new capital investments, are able to
collect non payment fees w/ property liens (electric utilities do not even have
this power) and are in an industry that has seen very little change in the past
100 years.

I started to look at this industry when I was doing some home renovations and
carted loads of trash to our local landfill (operated by Waste Management). It
was quite expensive to dump my construction trash in the landfill. It turns out
that the City participates in the revenue sharing with the contracted operator.
I later discovered that the municipal landfill was seen as a large profit
center for the City (ie. City of San Jose).

Imagine this occurring all over the U.S. with cities in desperate financial
shape looking for new ways to generate new revenue sources. Because of the
slumping economy and the huge number of foreclosures, the garbage industry is
for the first time seeing a slump in revenues (why pay garbage bills if you no
longer pay your mortgage). Therefore, one would expect the waste haulers to be
selling at all time lows. Furthermore, this is an excellent opportunity for the
waste companies to lock in multi year municipal service contracts. If they can
be profitable in this environment, then when the economy recovers they should
be on a better growth path than their numbers indicate now.

Combine this with the potential cost savings with well thought out managed
integrated waste disposal systems (like using cheap NG to power their fleet
vehicles). I see the long term potential for a more profitable industry (higher
industry ROA & ROE). Their ROI for new equipment and disposal systems are
almost guaranteed since being in a regulated industry they can raise their
service fees to cover their new capitalized investments. Have you ever had your
garbage bill reduced?

Forward PE's are around 12-13. It might be possible to pick up a little cheaper
on any market sell off. Historically, they run higher in the 16 range. These
integrated waste disposal systems have a huge upfront cost but over the long
run could help lower operating costs to the point where overall industry
earnings are higher thus providing for the possibility of higher long term
industry PE's in the high teens (similar to the more profitable regulated
integrated utility companies).

Just more food for thought.

EKS, That cost difference as well as the new abundance of supply is why I am
looking at NG also. I have some questions on your last post. San Jose's
landfill is making money on converting garbage to energy. I don't know if
there's any landfill project that is making a profit on recycling. Also, I
don't believe that garbage collectors have pricing power control as the
consumer will always look for the cheapest competitor. Look at WM's earnings
per share growth over the last five years for example.

The City of San Jose makes money on the landfill operation as they own the land
and charge fees to dump garbage there. The operator (Waste Management) has
prepared this landfill (obtained site license, lined the site as required per
EPA rules and does day to day grading).

WM also operates their multi year collection contract (I think it is a five
year term) for the City. The City changed contractors about five years ago via
RFP proposal. So the current operator can be replaced but it takes at least two
years because of the public process (ie their moat can get a hole if they
charge too much for services).

Both WM and RSG bring the complete package to the municipality. They will build
a new landfill (w/ all EPA licenses), do the waste collection (including
recycling & integrated waste disposal), and provide what ever else (garden
waste collection) is necessary to land a multi year municipal City contract.

There are still a lot of privately owned garbage collectors that pick up
garbage and dump at the local landfill. Landfills last about 20 years and the
approval for new ones are very expensive to get approved (because of new EPA
rules) and receive a site license. Therefore, new landfills are just not
getting built. It can take as long as 5 years and millions of $'s to get ones
sited, built and approved. Both WM & RSG have dedicated divisions that work w/
the municipalities to site, build and operate landfills.

In the San Francisco Bay area, no new landfills have been approved for years.
Most of the garbage is now transported to the central valley (100 miles) for
disposal. The newest landfill 20 miles South of San Jose was completed about 7
years ago, has a useful life of another 40 years and that has been extended
because of the aggressive curb side and garden waste recycling implemented by
the City and WM over the last 10 years.

This is occurring in every major City in the U.S. and I suspect that in the
next 15 years many of the smaller municipalities will face having to Site new
landfills. They will be overwhelmed by the up front cost and look to partner
with WM and/or RSG to help build these new landfills and will also look at
integrating more efficient waste disposal systems in their community. This
should result in more long term multi year municipal collection contracts for
these companies.

For that reason, I don't see a big need to bet against the dollar. The dollar

Hi Paul -

I wonder if any of these retailers might have some leverage in negotiating
favorable future store leases (especially if they have little or no lt debt on
their books). For PSS and/or SCVL I doubt they own their store real estate. It
might be a good time to exam all these retailers again (especially those that
are in "Value" territory) to see if any are/were able to lock in long term
store leases at bargain per sqft prices. This would bode well for better than
expected earnings solely due to lower operating costs.

I have not checked this recently but it might be one factor for me to nibble at
a few of these retailers if I knew they were able to secure lower than average
store lease rates.

I think most feel that a double dip recession may no longer be in the cards.
Shoe Carnival, Inc. (NasdaqGS: SCVL) appears to have the best margins and ROE
but they still need to move a lot of product to really impact their bottom
line. Perhaps the holiday season may be good for these retailers.

Shoe Carnival to expand
Eyes Dallas, Puerto Rico
http://www.courierpress.com/news/2011/nov/18/30pt-hed1-10-inches-p/

From the article:"...Shoe Carnival has 327 stores in the Midwest, South and
Southeast. The company this year began selling merchandise at
www.shoecarnival.com.

The retailer plans to open about twice as many new stores next year as it has
this year.
<Clip>
The 25 net new stores planned for next year, eight will open in Dallas and four
will open in Puerto Rico.

Jackson acknowledged that the company will incur additional costs as it enters
the new markets.

"Dallas is going to be a great market, we feel, for us, but it's going to be an
expensive advertising market," Jackson said.

Shoe Carnival's strategy, Jackson said, is to build name recognition in the
Dallas market in 2012, then come back in 2013 and add additional stores in that
area....".

It's going to be difficult for retailers to compete with the online shoe

business. The stock has been bouncing of the 9$ mark so far, so that is a
decent entry from a chart perspective.

Insurer SYA. Upped my few shares a little Friday. Low stated p/bv, low p/e,
some insider buying, dividend while waiting. In public history going back seven
years, SYA has reported profits each year. Book value has flopped around
though.

GlaxoSmithKline PLC Common Stoc (NYSE: GSK ) - Closed out position

I sold the GSK November $43 calls in June to protect my small gains in this
drug stock. I expect my stock to be called away @ $43 this weekend. I bought
this drug stock in 4/2008 following Buffet's Buys. It has paid a good dividend
(around 5%) but has really gone nowhere in the 3 1/2 years I have owned it. I
booked a 20% profit over this period which only represents a 6% annual return
mostly made up from their dividend payments.

I have not decided where to deploy the proceeds but will probably not reinvest
back into the pharma industry. I think many of the drug stocks can be had at
lower prices (15%-20% lower from current levels).

With my recent sells this year in BMY, COV, LLY and now GSK, my pharma holdings
are about 50% of what they were at the beginning of the year. My drug holdings
now include PFE, BMY, MRK and ABT where they represent 5.5% of my total
combined portfolios (Taxable & IRA). My IRA holds 3x the number drug stock
positions than the taxable account as they continue to be good dividend payers
into the account.

These are the drug companies I follow on my watch list:

ZmlUYWJsaXN0BHNsawNkZXRhaWxlZA--

MDT is the only one IMO that may be in value territory but their dividend yield
is low at 2.8% and I am not too sure that future (capital gains) growth will
make up the difference. I think I will have the chance to buy most of these at
lower prices especially if the general market retests the recent lows.

He owns very little Oil & NG when compared to my holdings w/ XOM & COP as his
only energy positions. I was surprised to see he has position in both Visa (V)
and Master Card (MA). There are three drug companies JnJ, SNY and GSK. I sold
all three in the last two years. He owns two papers in the Washington Post
(WPO) and Gannett (GCI). The retailers he owns are WMT,Costco (COST) and Dollar
General (DG).

I will have to study the list and see what I am missing. When compared to my 87
position portfolio, I have very little over lap (XOM, COP, GE & INTC).

Do you see any of his positions that pop out to you as value buys? I like his
recent purchase in GD. I may add one or more of his retailers and I will have
to look at V & MA as possible adds too.

FWIW I recently bought some SeaCube Container Leasing Ltd. (BOX)(
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=BOX+Key+Statistics ) as they are well
positioned to take advantage of the shipping container boom described in the
article you posted. They offer a new box that incorporates a self contained
refrigeration unit. All of their containers are designed to be used on ships.
trucks and rail. I really should have loaded up when it sold off around $12
recently. I hold the shares in my IRA as they pay an excellent dividend
yielding around 7%.

The company has a PE of 7 but typical of these leasing companies they use a lot
of debt. Therefore even though they carry 2.5X more LT debt I would like, this
one is an exception. With interest rates near all time lows, carrying the debt
is no that expensive. However, they will be susceptible to higher interest
rates which I do not expect to occur in the next 12-18 months.

re SYA, why bother with SYA when you get a class act like MET at the same
valuation?

I think that MET is a far better company with better brand name recognition,
better ratings, international reach. I don't own MET right now but I am
watching it closely. If Mr Market cooperates, I am going to fish for some
shares below 30$.

I'll consider MGDDY again. I like it for its apparent low p/e. I don't like
that it's in a very competitive business with other well-regarded competitors,
e.g. Pirelli and Conti.

I don't understand tires that well -- tires seem to me like they're fungible
within any segment of the market (low price segment, high performance market,
off-road, truck) - there's no real difference that's apparent to me among the
brands, and maybe not much brand loyalty from customers in the emerging markets
or here in the USA market, I am guessing. Whether the customers are auto
manufacturers or it's the replacement market. (I suspect though the Koreans are
very loyal to their home-country brand, the French to Michelin, etc.)

These tire companies may all have the same strategy of targeting emerging
markets for their growth. Net result is nobody get any advantage over anybody
else. And maybe that's okay if the market just grows, Michelin gets it share,
and the stock maybe at some point gets viewed more favorably (p/e increases).

===
I am seeking out French-based multinationals that have a large presence outside
of France, especially with business ops in emerging countries. Michelin fits in
that category of stock, and so it's another reason why I'll look at it. (Aside:
I am passing on France's SNY, am holding on to TOT, am holding on to losing
position in PRGAF, and I am buying everything else I've found, Pernod being one
example.)

As well, I'll add more MET if it drops. Yes, they do seem to be about equal as
to valuation. For me, I'd rather have the diversity by having shares in both
companies. While MET is the behemoth and has a better presence and history than
SYA, it doesn't necessarily follow MET stock will do better than SYA's. Couple
of SYA insiders are placing their money on SYA now.

OT - Don't know if you saw this. Here is how the Chinese deal with Financial
Fraud in their country.

Father, two sons sentenced to death for fraud
Updated: 2011-11-08
http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2011-11/08/content_14057648.htm

HANGZHOU - <u>Two brothers and their father were sentenced to death on Monday
for cheating 15,000 investors out of over $1.1 billion in east China's Zhejiang
province.</u>

Ji Wenhua, president of the Yintai Real Estate and Investment Group, was
sentenced to death for the crime of fund-raising fraud, said the Intermediate
People's Court in the city of Lishui, where the company was based.

However, his brother, Ji Shengjun, and father, Ji Linqing, could be spared
execution as their death penalties have a two-year reprieve.

The family, along with others, had illegally raised over 7.04 billion yuan
($1.12 billion) between 2003 and 2008 before they were taken into police
custody in 2008, holding the truth from investors that their company had been
losing money for years, according to the court.

A third brother, Ji Yongjun, was sentenced to life imprisonment.

The four men also had their political rights deprived for life and personal
property confiscated.

The court also sentenced two other people involved in the case to three years
in prison each.

I suspect if the U.S. justice department had similar provisions for Bank Fraud,
we would see it stop here in the U.S..

re MGDDY and the tire market.

FWIW , I believe there is a fungible difference between tires. USA is the land
of low priced tires that blow up every once in a while. I have never seen so
many cars sitting on the side of the road with blown tires than in the US. I
know that the rest of the world thinks differently. Certainly I do and I am one
individual who tries to save a buck when I can but I certainly wouldn't buy
tires with nylon armament.

Michelin has not best track record in terms of capital allocation. I remember
episodes like a price war in the US to gain market shares against Goodyear that
left them bloodied. I believe that was in the late 80's or early nineties.

What attracted me to the tire companies a while ago was the observation that
they don't have trouble raising and keeping prices with input costs (Crude,
rubber) early last year. That is a change from my historical observations. As
such, I believe that the tire companies may be able to do better than expected,
and Michelin is the cheapest of the global manufacturers.

I bought Michelin on the last dip starting in July or August and sold from the
13 to the 14$ range. Know I am trying to do the same trick again. It's simply
to cheap for their low levered balance sheet, 4%+ dividend yield and ~7X
earnings.

I believe that Pirelli is the best managed tire company; the stock was
available for a small premium to book and 8x earnings in the 2011 trough. maybe
it is available for this price again - I think this stock is a good buy there.

Hi Clownbuck -

AG & large Earth Mover tire market

Checking out the MGDDY Website, I notice they manufacture both AG and the very
large earth mover tires too. This is the segment of the market I really like
but wanted a pure play. The PE for me is in Value territory but is this the
best way to play the very large tire market? The large miners require specialty
tires and it can be as long as 8-12 months for orders to be delivered. Thought
I might add a specialty AG tire manufacture to my AG basket too. Can you think
of any other companies that might be a better pure play?

Several years ago I bought Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) as a value buy. That
worked out for me (more than a two bagger) but never bought back in.

Hi EKS. In looking over OSK, I noticed that they are experiencing a supply
problem with their tire supplier. Not sure if it relates or not, but what the
heck. From their 10k:

<In mid-July 2011, the Company was informed by the DoD and its tire supplier
that recent orders for military vehicles, including orders received by the
Company for M-ATV Underbody Improvement Kits, may cause a constraint in the
supply of a certain size and specification of tire. <u>The Company uses these
same tires on many of its heavy tactical vehicles</u>. Since that time,
insufficient supplier capacity to accommodate this spike in demand has caused
the DoD to use its sovereign authority to direct tires currently scheduled for
delivery to the Company for FHTV production to be re-routed for use on
contracts with the “DX” designation. The “DX” designation process is
essentially a process that enables the DoD to prioritize use of materials for
national defense purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company
began engaging in regular discussions with the DoD and the tire supplier. The
Company now expects that the tire shortage will negatively impact the timing of
its production and delivery schedule through much of fiscal 2012 and will
negatively impact the timing of its FHTV sales. The Company continues to assess
the matter and is working to minimize any impact this situation may have on its
operations and its results. Based on the most recent information received from
the tire supplier and the DoD, the Company has removed approximately $225
million of sales from its fiscal 2012 expectations communicated in its Form
10-Q filed for its third quarter of fiscal 2011.>

yes thats probably what happens to chinese who swindle chinese investors. my
guess is it doesnt happen to chinese who swindle the white-devils. As far as
the U.S. goes, I think anything goes. The SEC finally got around to
disciplining the people left who managed not to find any problems with Madoff
despite getting the info served to them on a platter. a few slaps on the wrist,
no one was fired. The SEC has proven itself to be completely inadequate to
protect shareholders. Then we have the people in charge of auditing and
supervising MF global run by a former ceo of Goldman Sacks and Governor of NJ.
Yet somehow $600 million of customer funds goes missing after two weeks they
cant find the money. How is this possible?

I followed Buffett into MA and also bought DFS in the credit card sector. This
is the only example of Buffett buying two competitors. He also has Visa. I also
own DG. I do not own any other stocks that Berkshire has.

I typically try to hold only twenty to twenty five stocks at a time. I don't
know how to keep track of more and I mean keeping track in an efficient manner,
not just watching PE levels or just the chart. Unfortunatly, I do not have a
staff.

After spending some time looking over the current holdings in Buffett's
portfolio, the clear value pick for me is IR. Just simply on the discount to
its peer group that its currently valued at and management's proven record.
Second place, more on technicals than on fundamentals goes to Kraft.

BOX qualifies as a buy by my methodology, both technically and fundamentally. I
also like CAP, although it does not offer a dividend. Nice find.

EKS, let's look over Barron's picks looking for value next.
