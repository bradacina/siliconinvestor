in some optimistic numbers and indicated value based on same. He came up with
$103 for AMZN. No way do I beleive he was considering BUYING it. The theme of

SVIN Scheid Vineyards as an asset play.

Paul Chapman brought this one up on the Buffett thread. I'd looked at SVIN
before, but passed since I think too much of the wine industry is run for love
of wine instead of profit.

But Paul pointed out that the planted land they own is so far undervalued on
their books that the company's liquidation value far exceeds the market cap.

Not really fair. I corresponded extensively with Nick Benson at the company and
clearly understood that this quarter would be bearing the
brunt of efforts to get inventories back in line. I think the release
suggested that USA and Brazil were stronger than expected. I do not fault the

SVIN - My gosh, just peeked at their 10-K, this really looks like a horrible
business to be in!

In each of 98 and 97 they had roughly $18M revenue and $3.5M earnings. Their
Yahoo! profile indicates that they have 5150 acres. That works out to $3500
revenue per acre, and $680 earnings per acre. I have no idea if this is
representative of the industry or of this company (I didn't dig deep enough to
determine this), however I will assume that it is, and jump off from here!

Their 10-K describes how it takes 3 years and $15-18,000 to get one acre up and
running. Spending $15K to generate $3500 per year in sales seems like lunacy to
me! (then again, I'm not in the cable TV business ;-). That's a P/E of 22.

Whaddya want to guess (I don't know this) that an acre of land is good for
15-20 years before you have to replant it? In other words, that the whole
business is a recipe to (slowly) bleed money ad infinitum?

If that's not stupid enough, who in their right mind would pay $50-100,000 for
an acre of prime land? Assuming $65K per acre, that's 18.5X revenues, 95X
earnings! Wine.com?

Unless there are immediate plans for the value to be unlocked, by selling their
land now while there are other suckers to take it off their hands at these
prices, I wouldn't buy. Why buy a company with a hidden asset that requires a
greater fool to buy it in order for that value to be realized?

Now if the land could be sold for other purposes, I suppose that could justify
valuing it at $50K+ per acre, however one would have to dig a bit deeper into
the details of the holdings and management's intentions.

FWIW, I'd be interested to know how cost structure of a vineyard compares with
say an orange grove or a banana field or cranberry bog. Of all these examples
I've thrown out off top of my head, vineyards seem to carry MUCH more risk!
Consider: oranges will taste better from harvest to harvest depending on
weather etc. But natural flavors are added in orange juice mfg. process
(concentrated flavors extracted from orange peel...(Int'l Flavors & Fragrances
is public leader there) to ensure relatively standard final product all the
time. With wine, if you have a less than perfect grape harvest I doubt there is
any similar means to improve the taste/quality of the grapes.

I know of a guy who had cashed out of successful investments and bought a
vineyard. Sounded like a trophy business to me, not one designed to be a money
machine by any means. I think there are many other fruit growing & processing
stocks out there attractively priced with better cost structure and less
business risk.

I looked at SVIN before, and passed. If it counts, I follow the wine industry
as a consumer.

One of my main hesitations was the one you mentioned three times: wine
industry. Who makes money in it? I see that MOND has done well over the past 5
years, but CHLN has gone nowhere. It is hard to get a feel for the industry,
but there are so few public companies.

The land they own is good land in Monterey and San Benito counties, but maybe
it would have been better left to lettuce and broccoli.

They report contracts to sell grapes to GLEN ELLEN, BEAULIEU
VINEYARD, BV COASTAL, BLOSSOM HILL, PAUL MASSON, ALMADEN, DEER VALLEY,
DUNNEWOOD, and MYSTIC CLIFFS. There is a LOT of competition at this level. They
call them the "fighting varietals." Profit margins have to be tight here.

This from the 10K is more intriguing: "The Company also has long-term grape
purchase agreements with other well-known producers of ultra premium wines,
including Beringer Wine Estates, Chalone Wine Group, The Hess Collection
Winery, David Bruce Winery and Gundlach-Bundschu Winery. The terms of the
Company's long-term grape purchase contracts extend to between 2001 and 2014,
and have "evergreen" provisions requiring two or three years' prior written
notice of termination. These contracts generally require the customers to
purchase substantially all of the Company's production from specified vineyards
at a formula price based upon the previous harvest year's sales prices in
California's leading coastal regions, including Napa, Sonoma, Mendocino and
Monterey Counties."

These no doubt are for extensive vineyards now planted but not producing.
Premium wineries generally won't touch vines producing for less than 4 years,
and prefer older vines yet. I guess here the question is now many acres do they
have contracted to premium vintners, and whether the vineyards will produce the
grapes that the premium vintners expect, because otherwise they will cancel
with 2 years' notice.

Somehow SVIN does not look so bad now; I'll start following it again for
awhile.

Combining trade and finance receivables under equipment operations still gives

11/10/97. They had 1998 estimates at $437 million of revenue and EPS at $1.18
(Actual was $450 million and $1.20)

They had 1999 estimates at $500 million and EPS at $1.54 Present average
estimates are $1.51 now. Not much change.

They had a "Buy" recommendation on 11/10/97 when the stock was at $27.75 and
had a target price of $38 over the next 12 months.

Actual is that the Company hit the numbers and the stock is at $9. They have a
"Strong Buy" recomendation now. All 7 analysts have a "strong buy".

Alex Brown's report dated 3/2/98 has a target price of $31, when the stock was
at $19. Jefferies update on 3-13-98 has a target of $29-$38, when the stock was
at $20.

brokers against the traditional brokers. The software to go online for the
traditionalists is not all that complicated. They have the financial resources
to make it happen. They have name recognition. The biggest problem for them is
their internal mindset. How do they handle the infrastrucure base of brokers
that they have? They're scared of that. But, Schwab has shown you can make the
transition. When the others do the same, there will be real pressure on the
Dateks and etrades.

And, the odd thing, about Amazon, is that so many of their costs are

Dan, the best site I've found is http://rereader.com/bergman , and I've found
other data confirming figures in the $50K/acre plus range.

I think some of the previous analyses were too cursory. For 1998, Scheid's
gross margin was 55% and the net margin was 21% in the worst year in the past
five. Those are the figures that are important, not the revenue per acre. If
you don't like Scheid's margins, how about the return on equity? The industry
average is around 6%, while Scheid produced 25% in 1996, and 18% in 1997. I
don't have the figure for 1998.

Also the Canandaigua purchase of Franciscan Estates is the best indication of
value around. They purchased at 4.5 times revenues. The price per acre is a
little fuzzy since I don't know what the value of Franciscan Estates' wine
inventory is. Premium wines are a minor part of Scheid's business. I still
argue that the Canandaigua purchase provides a benchmark for Scheid's value. At
the very least, it is worth $15 per share.

Paul,

I know nothing of the company, but Discover magazine recently ran an article on
wineries and vineyards. It turns out that good wine consistently comes from the
same plots of land, and those in the know can tell where a grape was grown
strictly from the taste of the wine. Chemically grapes from the same plots are
similar enough from year to year for this kind of comparison. Has to do with
many factors including moisture, exposure to sunlight, soil types, rate a which
vine will grow under these conditions, etc. Because of this, In France wine
with a certain name must come from certain plots of land. Somewhat different
than a commodity.

I know nothing of wines beyond what I've read - but I do find science's
conclusions interesting.

RE Sero. Thanks for your thoughts on this stock. You identified a very real
risk. I called company and they were very shareholder friendly, but of course
could not comment on possibility of losing a contract. Per 10K there are four 5
year contracts. These contracts have some minimum purchase requirements. Bottom
line is that as small shareholders we will remain in the dark and can only hope
that the company manages to keep its customers happy. Also there is real risk
that company can not continue to find a volume of donors which will keep their
business cash flow positive. However I am encouraged that the company showed 5
years of stable positive earnings. Also as a positive is the rather difficult
regulatory environment which I believe will act as a barrier to new
competitors. My firm belief is that the stock will stay in trading range in the
5 to 7 area. But since the "Yahoos" are busy hyping the stock an opportunity
exist to use this stock as a trading value stock using covered call options. I
now have 3100 shares with May 5, June 7.5 and November 10 calls sold so as to
bring my average purchase down to 4.5 dollars per share. Not much on this

FLE stock is near yearly low but FLE revenues for RV business are at high (I

to be very cyclical); Fleetwood says its earnings are suffering and this is

Tobacco keeps getting kicked in the teeth. And the implications are grim for a
wide variety of companies, not just tobacco.

Lorillard just lost a case filed by a man with mesothelioma, a type of lung
cancer that is nearly always fatal and is linked to asbestos exposure. The man
is elderly, and last smoked Lorillard's asbestos-containing cigarettes over 3
decades ago. The adverse health effects of asbestos were not known until over 2
1/2 decades later. Yet Lorillard is liable. This sounds ridiculous, especially,
since Lorillard had added the asbestos to decrease the particulate emissions of
cigarettes.

Even more ridiculous is the man worked manufacturing airplane stuff for Owens
Corning for most of his life. If ever there is a reason he got mesothelioma,
it's this.

So what did he do? He sued both, and Lorillard was found liable while Owens
settled. Implicit guilt on both parties. To me, very sad, though not as
ridiculous as an 80 million dollar judgement against Philip Morris for a smoker
who died probably because he smoked Pall Malls (NOT a MO brand). But the net is
that I am realizing the tobacco risk is very high, and that, while I won't sell
my MO or UST positions yet, I will have to re-evaluate. The reason is that
companies are being found liable on even the slightest suggestion that they
might be liable. No proof necessary. And the awards are exorbitant. This sort
of irrationality is a big wild card.

This big "not my responsibility...but who can I blame?" attitude sweeping the
country, especially in the aftermath of the Littleton disaster, is to me a big
risk now for tobacco, gun companies, and eventually any company that makes
high-fat food, or sells it. Watch out Cheesecake Factory. Future liability
should be figured into the valuation of Keebler and any other dealer of fat.
And don't forget sports equipment companies that entice adults to injure
themselves running and such. Nike, beware.

Meanwhile, I'm getting sick seeing such an outpouring of self-righteous
hypocrisy and ignorance. So who can I sue for my nausea?

what you want to take out of that, but that narrowed the choices for me. The
way I look at it is there are many things that can go wrong in this industry

Exactly. One of the pluses for MO over the others was the apparent strength
that Marlboro was experiencing overseas. But if humans as a group (and
worldwide) are prone to finding liability decades after the event or even
non-event, then the whole industry is open to immense uncertainty that could
affect their viability. I was brushing it off until recent cases highlighted
the seriousness of this to investors considering the beaten-up sector. I had
thought that eventually there would be one big lawsuit or that people would
tire of the lawsuits. But it looks like settling with the states just revealed
some vulnerability and now everybody and their mother is attacking. The
ridiculous and unfair awards in these cases just must provoke even more
lawsuits. I mean, it is a very simple mind that thinks "I smoked Pall Mall's
for 30 years, and then Marlboro the last 10, and I got lung cancer, so
Marlboro's to blame."

But it's the same reason that there will always be ob-gyns losing cerebral
palsy malpractice suits. Greed and the fact that the average
IQ really is just 100.

What Tobacco really needs is the Supreme Court to stand up and issue a ruling
on a case significant enough to be a deterrant to other frivolous tobacco
liability cases. One such case is moving to the docket soon. If the ruling is
in Tobacco's favor, I'd expect there to be a big jump in the stocks. If not, a

The Lorillard case should be viewed as an asbestos case rather than a tobacco
one. However it may indicate the willingness of juries to find a culprit
whenever something bad happens. Actually, there have been one or two other
cases lost in the Lorillard series. In fact it is a wonder that there aren't
lots because during the 1950's Kent cigarettes boasted one of their product's
benefits was that they had a Micronite filter. Micronite of course was made
from asbestos. If you wanted to set up an experiment to study mesothelioma, you
would do a smoking rat study, coupled with aerosolized asbestos, ie. give them
Kents.

I don't know whether this scores points in court, but the New Yorker Magazine
did a multi-part series on mesothelioma arising among asbestos workers
belonging to a New Jersey trade union during the late 1950's. It specifically
noted that workers who smoked had a multiplied incidence of lung cancer. In
effect, the relation of asbestos to mesothelioma in particular had been
medically accepted before the Surgeon General officially decreed the risks of
tobacco.

My reading of this recent decision is that there is still a perceived
difference between the responsibilities in the cases of asbestos versus
tobacco.

My caveat is that I still cannot figure the rationale for the bankrupting of
multiple medical device companies for the production of silicone and derivative
devices. (Then again, I knew some geriatric pediatricians who were bankrupted
21 years after giving 'too much' oxygen to babies in a neonatal unit. {Your
malpractice coverage doesn't increase with time, but your compounded liability
does.}) Legal fads are real, and dangerous.

Jump Ball: A broken REIT - FUR

This company has been totally trashed over the past last year. It was one of
four stapled stock entities with the special tax status until Congress closed
the loophole. Management had run it as an old boys club lurching from real
estate class to real estate class, overpaying often. Most recently it had
decided to specialize in parking lots. Gotham Partners, and others took a large
positions with the stated intent of exploiting the paired-share status.
Management fought back using lawsuits and delay. Finally Gotham prevailed, in
time for the tax status to be rescinded. Management declared a 'change of
control', bailing out under golden parachutes. Huge charges from both sides of
the fight have been extracted from the company. Everything has had to be
reconstructed: new management, new bank loans, new strategy. Stock has cratered
from $16 to $4. Dividends eliminated. A rights offering is about to commence. A
loss for 1998 of $2.81/share. In other words: a disaster.

Can they turn around? I believe it was Buffett who said that 'turnarounds
don't'. However I ask you to get the current annual report and read the
shareholder letters - one from the principal at Gotham, and the other from the
CEO. A property by property reassessment is currently underway. On Yahoo a
poster claims that management has publicly stated that NAV is currently
$8/share. The rights offering of 1 share (at $4) for every 2.5 shares held is
intended to pay down short term bridge loan debt to buy time to realize that
value via liquidation or operation. (The rights offer in and of itself will
tend to hold down current share price.) Gotham has stated a willingness to
purchase all unsubscribed rights.

How out of favor are they? Value Line dropped them from their universe of
followed companies April 30, 1999.

Wallace and Mike. CMO might be a reasonable play, with more upside than most
reits--but also with more risk. They invest in CMO's. The risk, as noted in
their 10K is to changes in the yield curve. (I'm writing from memory, here, so
watch out!) They have a mismatch in their funding. Assets are long term. Liabs
are short. So, any flattening in the yield curve can have a strong detrimental
effect on their results. Of course, vice-versa for a steeper curve. Added risk
is that a general falling of the yield curve will lead to accelerated
prepayments, and leave them sucking air. They will do very well with stable
long term rates and falling short-term.

It's pretty well laid out in their Annual Report.

Oh, I know CMO pretty well after all these years - I know the risk
characteristics firsthand. They do not strictly invest in CMOs, although CMOs
may be a small portion of the overall portfolio. IMHO the yield curve is
relatively favorable to them in today's environment. Before Mr. G lowered, it
was a lot less friendly.

Wow, look at value come back into style. 3 of my most maligned and
most treasured (and most invested stocks) - Midway, New Holland, and Deswell -
have been coming back in a big way. I know a lot of us here were in these to
one degree or another. Paul, Jeffrey, Jim (?). Pats on the back all around. New
Holland is approaching a double from where several of us bought sub-9 not too
long ago. Even tobacco's making a run. Any one else here touch that?

How many of us looked at Yahoo Finance's front page after the close today, saw
all the indices down big time, only to check on a portfolio or two (or 6, in my

Hand raised here.

I mentioned timeshares before -- but I need to repeat since earnings are coming
out and all companies are meeting or beating the street... I follow this sector
closely.

SVR and TWRI reported earnings today and made the numbers or did better. SVR
seems undervalued to me (I own none yet) and some Yahoo posted that in the CC
the company was comfortable with Q2.

OWN (I own) comes out with earnings tomorrow and they repeatedly said that they
are comfortable with numbers -- so I think they will beat them. They are also
undervaled according to any measurement including in comparison to peers.

The sector is getting recognized, with an article in Business Week and rumors
of FFD being acquired stirring things up. All are heading up....

Mike, I won't argue that NH has been stunning. If $.40 is the worst quarter of
this cycle, there is certainly no reason to sell it here. I suspect that is why
the stock has been so strong -- people have had to reevaluate their assumption
that they would lose lots of money.

However, I think we have a ways to go before we can break out the champagne
over MWY. I believe it will take a surprise of some sort to get past $11, since
a large amount of stock has traded in the $10-11 range.

Ron, re: DSWL

In one account I manage, I did go and put about 2/3 into Deswell in the very

in all my accounts except one. Couldn't believe it got that cheap again. Glad
it did. Still, the rest of my accounts are too diversified for one stock to
have a huge impact. But even when Apple, American Power, Robert Half, and Fair
Isaac falter on the same day, Midway, Deswell, New Holland, Philip Morris, and

Everytime I start to really look at a restaurant stock, I get disappointed.
I've been meaning to buy several for quite a long time. The only ones that have
kept my interest are the big, established chains. Anything new, though with
good growth potential, is too likely to get squashed by a better concept or run
under by its own grwoth. So I picked Tricon as a special situation. Been trying
to like BUNZ. Recently CKR got my interest down at 13ish, but then it jumped.

Yes, value may be coming back into style, unheralded.
The news only quotes the Dow and talks about internet companies,
but something is swirling underneath the surface. I wish I had
bought New Holland as you suggested, or AG, but I didn't. I did buy
Deswell, and that has shot up quite a bit. You mentioned tobacco,
and BGL has gone up, but what about RN? That is just lying there,
and yet they should spin off the tobacco business next month. You
didn't mention the oil stocks, and I don't know if you would consider
them value plays, but they are way up, including Global Marine and
Maverick Tube, two of my favorites. You didn't mention Singer (SEW),
but it is way up (to 5.25), along with many companies with some kind
of Asian or third world connection. The sometimes-touted Elamex
(ELAMF) has not moved, though, still crouched below $4.00. It is so
thinly traded, I gave up on getting any. I have not heard anyone
mention how many companies currently pay a huge dividend, besides
utilities. For the enterprising dividend investor, this would seem
to be a gold mine:

Allied Capital--------(ALLC)--$17.50 Yld 9.1%
British Steel---------(BST)---$23.50 Yld 7.0%
Deswell Ind-----------(DSWL)--$12.75 Yld 6.4%
Foster-Wheeler--------(FWC)---$13.25 Yld 6.2%
Pennzoil-Quaker State-(PZL)---$13.25 Yld 5.4%
RJR Nabisco-----------(RN)----$26.50 Yld 7.9%
United Dominion-------(UDR)---$11.00 Yld 9.6%

These stocks are not without risk, but they are all in different
sectors with different sorts of risk exposure, and have decent
balance sheets and ongoing businesses. I would be interested
to know if others have found companies with similar
characteristics, and if there are any comments on
these companies.

Pe Ben Oilfield year-end earnings 96 cents per share

Shares issued 3,272,536 close $5.05

Mr. Joseph Simansky reports
Net income was $3.1-million or 96 cents per share on revenue of $64.1-million
for the year ended Dec. 31, 1998 compared with a net income of $759,040 or 23
cents per share on revenue of $50.3-million for year ended Dec. 31, 1997. Cash
flow for the 1998 fiscal year totalled $5.5-million (or $1.67 per share)
compared with $2.5-million (or 79 cents per share) in 1997. Shareholders'
equity as at Dec. 31, 1998 increased by 34.6 per cent from $9.3-million (or
$2.84 per share) as at Dec. 31, 1997 to $12.6-million (or $3.79 per share) as
at Dec. 31, 1998.
Gross revenue for the fourth quarter totalled $15.4-million compared with
$12,823,782 for the same period in 1997. A net profit of $993,138 or 30 cents
per share was recorded for the period compared with a net profit of $155,510 or
five cents per share a year earlier. Cash flow generated in the fourth quarter
totalled $1.4-million or 44 cents per share compared with $636,413 or 19 cents

Service opportunities created by the commencement of several major large
diameter pipeline construction projects facilitated the overall increase in
revenue and earnings in 1998 compared with 1997. Revenue from stringing and
stockpiling operations in Canada and the United States totaled $27.07-million
compared with $6.75-million in 1997 with pretax earnings contribution
increasing by $4.52-million. The volume of pipeline stringing and stockpiling
work presently secured for 1999 is comparable to that on-hand at this time in
1998 and management anticipates that this segment of its operation will again
be a significant contribution source.
A sustained downturn in service demand associated with a reduction in energy
exploration resulted in revenues derived from oil field transportation,
material handling and storage declining by $3.62-million to $16.38-million in
1998 from $20-million in 1997 and pretax earnings declining by $1.27-million.
Recent increases in oil prices have provided some encouragement in respect to a
potential correction in the economic fundamentals that precipitated the
downturn in oil field activity, however, it is not believed that the
difficulties experienced in the industry will necessarily be reversed in the
near-term.
Reduced exploration activity, contract changes and regional economic downturns
also resulted in a $2.92-million decline in revenue from the transportation of
bulk petroleum products from $23.59-million in 1997 to $20.67-million in 1998.
Improved resource utilization and cost controls implemented in 1998 did,
however, assist in reducing the impact of the revenue loss and the deficit in
this area of operation compared to 1997. Efforts to improve the financial
performance of this operation and and its viability continue to be pursued at
every opportunity.
Further details will be available in the 1998 annual report which is scheduled
to be mailed the third week of May 1999.

SLM is a publicly traded company, listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (under
symbol ESP). SLM has been consistently profitable since it was established in
1986, posting a compounded annual growth rate of 52%.

SLM Software Inc. provides advanced end-to-end transaction management solutions
that enable payment systems and electronic commerce for financial institutions
worldwide. SLM leads the open-systems market for on-line transaction processing
offering our customers the advantages of simplified system management and the
flexibility to create dynamic, user-friendly customer services. From the
world's first open-systems client-server transaction management system to the
latest solutions in Internet banking and smart cards, SLM keeps financial
institutions and their customers ahead in 35 countries on four continents.
Recent acquisitions have dramatically extended the company's ability to service
high-growth vertical markets in the financial industry, health care, insurance
and electronic commerce.

SLM continues to build momentum as the leading customer-driven electronic
transaction management resource for the financial industry. The company is
expanding its network of local offices in key international markets, and
offering an ever broader range of services, including advanced retail banking
solutions and knowledge generating software to deliver insight into customer
choices and needs. At SLM, we help our customers connect with their customers,
building more responsive services, shaping better service delivery, and
ultimately, forging stronger, more resilient customer relationships –
relationships no competitor can get close to.

SLM is expanding its ability to serve a broad spectrum of financial markets
through the strategic acquisition of companies with complementary products and
expertise.

In banking, SLM's ability to deliver solutions with powerful customer appeal
gained momentum with the acquisition of FMR Systems in October 1997. FMR is a
front-running developer of retail banking solutions focused on building dynamic
relationships with customers. Prior to the acquisition of FMR, the two
companies had worked together successfully on a number of projects.

SLM's strategic diversification into the insurance and health care service
markets was accomplished with the acquisition of GSA Consulting Group Inc., a
leading Canadian-based health care software company in December 1997. GSA is a
pioneer in the emerging ‘IP3' insurance environment – a market defined by
Integrated Payers, Intelligent Providers and Informed Patients. The company's
products provide both public and private insurers with tools to better
understand and manage health resources.

Since 1997, SLM's mandate has been to diversify its global revenue base, which
had historically been in international markets. The United States represents
considerable opportunities for SLM, where the market for electronic financial
services is estimated to be over US$3 billion by year 2002.

Objective: Achieve major market share in the United States.

GROWTH STRATEGY: Key to SLM's growth strategy is to gain significant
penetration in the financial services industry in North America, particularly
the United States. Extensive market analysis determined the key success factors
for successful U.S. entry required:

Brand recognition
Sales and distribution channels
Scalable, integrated open system technology
Support and service
Plan in Action: SLM determined a strong "distribution" acquisition of an
established company would provide the brand equity and channels to achieve a
successful footing in the U.S. market. SLM also sought strong management
leadership who shared a common vision and would not drain on SLM's management
team.

Market analysis identified the mid-size community banks and credit unions with
assets from $50 million to $5 billion represented the most attractive target
markets for SLM. The consolidation within the U.S. banking industry has put
pressure on these financial institutions to introduce new products and services
in order to compete against the mega banks.

SLM Management projects that SLM will generate revenues of more than $100
million and earnings of approximately $16.3 million or $1.25 per share in 1999.

Jeffrey,

Always wary of responding off the top of my head to you, since
inevitably you've put more thought into your question and the potential answers
than I put in my sometimes-flippant responses.

Here goes anyway:
Most stocks I follow have had quite a bounce of late off their lows.
Midway included. So the threat is a quick 25-30% loss if the value trend
reverses.

What is close?
I see Fair Isaac (FIC) and J.D. Edwards (JDEC) as millenium plays in reverse.
They are falling because of Y2K, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
Fair Isaac I've already discussed. A leader in their niche at historical ratio
lows. J.D. Edwards falls in the ERP category, but it mainly sells to the
mid-cap market. It does not face the same limitations that PSFT and SAP do
(these two face a saturated market in addition to Y2K). In fact, PSFT and SAP
would love to move into JD Edwards' territory, but are limited by the design of
their software. Recently JDEC jumped on a bad preannouncement. That tells me it
is hitting its bottom. The bugger is that management is still selling. On a
ratio basis, JDEC is twice as cheap as PSFT, with a great balance sheet and no
debt.

Champion Homes and Borders you already know about. I'm not the only one who
likes Borders. Dreman devoted some space to it in the May 3rd Forbes. Robert
Half I've already mentioned as well. Anchor Gaming I did buy some around recent
prices. When these turn, I see easy 50% gains in relatively short periods. And
the downside is limited.

Elamex (ELAMF) is as cheap as ever.

In, yes, semiconductors, my old favorite Speedfam, now Speedfam-IPEC has a lot
of short-sighted shareholders. Looks decent to me as a down-and-out cyclical
currently scraping bottom with a lot of doubters but a lot of cash and below
book, low ratios. A double at some point in the next few years.A great SI
thread with an excellent analyst Mr. Sam.

In restaurants, I really do like BUNZ the most. I don't have it entirely
figured out, but 50% isn't a stretch by any means. They are profitable, and
there's a lot of areas yet to expand into. Can't wait for them to get to
Silicon Valley.

Good morning, Mike -
My broker went to the BUNZ presentation at the Raymond James institutional
investor conference in early March. He really liked it, has liked the company
and product. If memory serves, the company is coming out with a new store
format, which could be very positive for earnings. That being said, I don't
think he has purchased any. I have no position.
I have recently purchased CS, purely on the theory that it will be taken over.
Speculation (and that's all this is, currently) of a takeover has been
substantial of late, particularly with FORE recently, and BAY, not so recently,
having been consumed. Also purchased as I felt downside was limited.
Other topics: IGT was upgraded recently by BBRS recently, casino stocks are
showing life, Raymond James (the brokerage firm I deal with) is also bullish on
the company's prospects. I have a position in IGT.
Hey, all you YPF holders on this board, let's break out in a grin! What does
this board think will transpire now? Will CSFB value the company at a higher
price than REP is currently offering? Some article I read in the press
mentioned that perhaps some large oil company might come around and offer a $50
stock deal. The only problem with this is that the corporate charter of YPF (I
believe in a poison pill provision) only allows an all cash takeover!

Hi Mike,

I've been watching CPU but haven't gotten in yet. Recent report may give a few
opportunities for those interested in low prices. Same store sales down,
revenue per sale also down due to falling computer prices. This trough has hurt
them to the point where they said they would be opening fewer stores in the
next few months. That's the bad news announced after the close yesterday.

However, they stated their intention to sell other electronic devices and were
looking into "strategic partnerships". And here's the reason why the price may
actually go up today: they again said that they would IPO their internet
business.

So, here's my question: would the IPO then fall under the tracking stock
category or would it be considered an independent issue since the books are
kept separate? And either way, what effect would it have on the share price of
the original CPU?

switch to more favorable fashion acceptance of its shoes. I believe that those
changes could not be evaluated or predicted as an investment so readily as the
net-net workout.

On the other hand, maybe it could be. K-swiss shoes are hot and its stock has
come roaring back from its lows. And FLH (Fila), which this thread saved me
from buying at 23 about a year ago, is now chopped almost in half. Maybe a bet
might be that FLH could see its fashion s back in style and its stock rise
again also.

Still, it did turn out that HYDEA was a very, very good investment on several
levels (I don't know about now - I don't follow HYDEA anymore.) Anyone buying
at 4 and holding to 12 had to have been stubborn or forgetful or adept in
spotting the changing business.

Kind of reminds me of VVTV which to me was clearly undervalued on a financial
basis (cash+investments)until about 5 or 6 (imo) where I sold it profitably---
but, as mentioned here, I wasn't able to see the internet aspects and so missed
the next double (to 12).

Paul: I haven't studied PRT specifically, but I'm getting the impression that
outlet malls as a retail concept have been losing luster. Same store data on
some of them have been flat to down. It's probably premature to say that they
will follow catalog stores into near oblivion, but the salad days are clearly
over. And this was before the threat from the net. Compounding this, there's
the probability that conventional malls may follow Taubman's lead on a new one
in Detroit area and combine value shopping and some of the outlet malls best
features in a more conventional mall setting. With the loss net-vulnerable
tenants, malls and strip centers are going to ajust by going after customers
that go to outlet malls.
All this is hypothetical, so make of it what you will.

I've thought a lot lately of retailers and lease obligations.
The ROIC of just about every chain I'm looking at is very much
decreased, to the point of negative EVA, when I add the PV
of these obligations to the denominator (invested capital). I'm looking for
opinions here on how value investors assess retail
chains when so many seem to be destroying economic value.

Why would you add the present value of a lease to invested capital? If you do
this, remember to add back rent expense to the numerator, otherwise you're
charging them twice for the same thing. Just as if you are going to add debt to
the denomiator (invested capital) you must add back interest to the numerator.
Do you still get the same conclusion?

ROIC = (Net Income + Interest tax effected)/(debt + equity - cash)

Mike's Retail ROIC = NI + Interest + Rent/(debt + equity + PV of lease payments
- cash)

I'm not going to go back and redo my analysis of Fairfax just to answer this
question, so if I make a mistake I don't want to hear about it, but I recall a
chairman's letter designed to pull all the strings of a Berkshire investor. But
without the substance. They have insurance operations which are mediocre at
best, awful at worst. Management is booking income in some creative ways to hit
the ROE targets. And the 41% growth in book value per share came primarily
through issuing shares at above book value, not through the business. The guy
has had a run in a bull market, but has booked the gains as net income (i.e. he
has sold all his winners) to make the return on equity number. You really have
to dig through the financials, because the Chairman's Letter, which is
apparently all Cramer read, is a work of fantasy. The stock is overvalued,
quite possibly by a lot.

Re: ROIC

My denominator is

assets minus excess cash minus trade accounts payable minus accrued expenses
plus PV of lease obligations

My numerator is

net income adjusted for 35% taxes plus goodwill amortization plus interest

So the thing I'm missing is that I'm supposed to add back rent expense to the
numerator if I add the PV of lease obligations to the denominator? That makes
perfect sense. I'll have to read Security Analysis again to see how I came out
of it thinking the way I did. It still decreases ROIC, but not to the degree I
thought.

I was just trying to get what my "cash return" on the ROIC would be. To me it
seemed that if I was adding rent back in then that would not really be my cash
return. I've still got to think on this.

from zd was a tracking stock. Right after spinoff the parent stock fell. So
what is advantage to holder of zd just before spinoff? A value stock that had a
spinoff which brought in cash to parent was alu. Alu has retained a portion of
the fragrance center spinoff but to my knowledge the owners of the parent
suffered as the stock dropped after the spinoff. This is so even though alu is
financially strengthened. The drop was caused because alu is no longer an
internet stock. This past week however management explained the effects of the
spinoff and the stock recovered somewhat. So in the case of cpu wouldnt it be

I have a real problem with your interpretation of accounts payable too. What
about the offsets, accounts receivable and inventories. You are making things
much more difficult than they need to be. The point of a return on investment

Right. Trade accounts payable are necessary to the business. That's why I
subtract it out from capital invested in the business.

I would say that operating leases on their stores are too. 

If they had been capital leases, they would be considered part of THE WAY THE
COMPANY CAPITALIZES ITS BUSINESS. Operating leases are problematic. Graham
certainly felt they were. What makes it so cut-and-dried for you?

I did make a mistake in my portrayal. In SA, I believe it asks to separate the
principal from the interest. The principal being the PV of the operating lease
agreement and the interest being the (total payments less the PV). Then using
the ratio of PV/total payments, one can figure how much of the rent payment is
going towards interest, and how much is going towards paying down the
principal. Then you can add the interest portion of the rent expense back to
the tax-adjusted net income and interest (in addition to amortization of
goodwill) to bolster the numerator.

The problem I have with Security Analysis is that the marginal utility of doing
some of this stuff is far less than its marginal cost in terms of time and
effort. When faced with a company with very strange accounting I will go to
such methods, and it often sheds light on things in that case. For an industry,
return on equity (with past writeoffs left in the numbers - i.e. not "added
back") or return on capital is going to give you the right answer.

Stern Stewart and so commit to manage their business with EVA in mind. (Or,if
not these original EVA guys, at least in a similar EVA-type outlook.) There's
some evidence that such companies do better (stockwise) than their peers who do
not manage by EVA (The study(studies) which prove the method are often
developed and reported by Stern Stewart -g-). Still, companies using EVA as a
driver makes logical sense to me. I consider it a plus when trying to evaluate

What I like to hear when I am interviewing a CEO is that he understands EVA in

example, because management clearly doesn't have it in their gut.

I looked at research from various sources and found little evidence to support
the idea it outperforms other valuation measures like growth in EPS, PE, ROA,
ROIC etc that are a helluva lot easier to calculate. High EVA alone just
doesn't do it...probably already in the stock price. If a company exceed EVA
expectations, it should bounce, but there's no First Call or Zacks offering
concensus EVA and brokers that calculate it often differ somewhat on method
used.

From one article: <<In recent studies, Merrill Lynch quantitative research
director Richard Bernstein evaluated four stock-selection strategies based
directly or indirectly on EVA. His conclusion: While EVA is an important tool
for corporate managers, it's hardly a stock-picking panacea. Portfolios built
on the four EVA-related strategies he tested generally did not outperform other
strategies based on plain old earnings growth.>>

and <<If you're still interested in adding EVA to your arsenal of
stock-selection tools after all that, understand that calculating EVA isn't an
exact science, either. Stern Stewart offers about 160 "adjustments" to its
basic EVA formula, from which users typically choose a handful. That means one
broker's EVA calculation could easily differ from that of another -- or from
yours. Merrill Lynch's EVA spreadsheet includes 150 to 200 lines per company.
>>

Nuff said

On the other hand, If you can determine that a co is about to start using EVA
as an internal management tool....before the rest of the market is aware of
this, you might capture a bit of a gain. The idea has a following. Best Buy
bounced about 10% when they announced they were going to use it. Like most news
releases though, it's tough to beat the market to the punch. EVA is a known
plus, I'm not sure the info has a tail effect beyond the initial
bounce....haven't looked at that.

reposted from USEC thread:
I am not a seller at anywhere near the current price. Or anywhere near the

I am not going to spell out the case again for owning USEC. It is still
available on the Value Investing thread at around the time of the IPO. All I
will tell you is focus on cash flow, and remember the excess uranium inventory.
They are selling it gradually - $80 million a year. That is pure free cash
flow, well in excess of earnings, and it is going to be there to secure the
dividend until that stockpile is gone - that's a long time. And the business is
still quite profitable as well.

JohnG S&L's Haven't studied industry deeply, but 3 issues to consider:
Rates/Yield curve: Lower rates encourage refinancing & flatter yield curve
lowers profit spread for outfits that borrow short [deposits] and lend long
Profit squeeze: Net based mortgage sources [Quicken for example] increase
competition for loans, while the 800 # Gorilla they sell the loans to {Fannie
Mae} has more clout that they do.
Y2K=No buyers Buy out premiums lower since potential purchasers of S&Ls don't
want to add to y2k headaches by purchasing potentially non-compliant unit.
The Y2K issue goes away soon. If economy continues strong the yield spread will
widen, but loan volumes may decline.
Net based competition is going to increase with lower cost value chain due to
lack of bricks & mortar, and net based shopping making comparison between local

It happens all the time. In fairness, I would point out that the Morgan Stanley
analyst did more work than any of the other underwriters to make the stock
understandable and visible to investors. He is getting the flak because he put
his butt on the line in recommending the stock for the last 9 months. Anybody
who has seen his report would understand that parts of it still look like a buy
recommendation - this guy knows the valuation. I have no beef with him. (The
other underwriter who downgraded a day later but put the day before close on
his report as if he made his call at 11 1/2...him I have a problem with.)

If I'm right about the value of this business, Wall Street just did me a huge
favor in giving me the chance to add to my position at 10. If I'm wrong, then
I'm going to lose money. Its that simple. In the long run, the economics are
going to stand on their own. I have done my homework, and I still think I'm
right. Not to say it won't take a while for the market price to reflect this -
the stock now has no Wall Street sponsorship.

Buffett said it over and over. Watch the business, not the stock. If the stock
