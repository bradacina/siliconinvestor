re AAUK / Xstrata - i don't know any of the two any more but 1B$ cost savings
to merge two companies with approx. 35B$ market cap each does not sound
compelling to me. Both have issues with leverage (I think Xstrata more so than
AAUUK) so a merger does not solve that problem either. Looks like little
geographical overlap - what's compelling about a merger?

re PRGN - nice move back too :-(. Failed to track it closely Earnings were good
but the market of course does not like to see 20M shares issued. New capital
needed to be issued because loan demands a certain NAV (value of tanker fleet
which has fallen apparently) regardless of earnings. Not as bad as OCNF but
still. FWIW I continue to hold my small position.

Hi Spekulatius - Any merger for AAUK is not really that good but the interest
by Xstrata might spark other companies to look under the hood. China's
state-run Chinalco might be quite interested in AAUK's iron ore and platinum
holdings. As a shareholder, I want to see my under valued company continue to
grow and maximize it's returns on company owned assets. Fair value (based on
AAUK's assets) for this shareholder is around $30.00/share. Anything less in a
merger is a giveaway to the buyer.

Chinalco could buy a minority ownership position as a long term investment
providing AAUK additional capital to buy some Canadian nickle and/or zinc
mines. This would help diversify their iron ore, platinum, coal and copper
holdings.

At current prices ($14.86/share) AAUK is still under valued. My last sale was a
few shares around $33.75/share (6/27/2008). My last buy was around $10.00/share
(01/13/2009). I think you picked up some shares below $9.00/share!

There recent acquisitions have worked out quite well but IMO are not at all
fully valued especially their iron ore assets.

On August 5, 2008, the Company acquired a 63.3% shareholding in Anglo Ferrous
Brazil SA, which holds a 51% interest in the Minas-Rio iron ore project
(Minas-Rio) and a 70% interest in the Amapa iron ore system (Amapa). Anglo
American acquired an effective 69.2% interest in the Amapa project during 2008.
On January 26, 2008 the Company acquired the remaining 50% shareholding in
United Marine Holdings. In March 2009, the Company sold its remaining 11.3%
stake in AngloGold Ashanti Limited to investment funds managed by Paulson & Co
In

With a long term threat of much higher inflation and a US $ that is debasing,
AAUK provides an excellent hedge against inflation and continues to be a core
portfolio position for me (currently makes up 6.6% of the portfolio). I like it
when other companies see the same long term value as I do and are willing to
pay big $'s.

Hopefully, no sale but an investment by a large silent partner. AAUK should
continue to move much higher.

RE: SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU)

also look at EI DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD)
or DU PONT E I 3.50 PFD (DD-PA)

I have been thinking the same thing. I have a good position in booth the
taxable and IRA account and want to stay diversified. My last buy was at $13.50
(4/09/2009) as this provided a 5% dividend. SVU has a new CEO as of last
quarter, so I am not sure if this warning is as a result of business conditions
or just that the CEO is cleaning up the balance sheet.

They are seeing customers much more price sensitive resulting in lower sales
volume and this has hurt the current quarter earnings guidance. The company has
been working on implementing a strategy of using more of their own "branded"
products which yield a higher overall profit margin but takes time and $'s to
implement the concept.

I want to see if the dividend is safe and see what the new CEO's view is on
future dividends. I will probable add a few more shares on any significant sell
off in a similar amount to what I bought on 4/09/2009. My position in the
taxable portfolio is a 2.2% holding while the IRA portfolio is a 3.3% holding.

The company has a fall back position in selling one or more stores they
acquired in the Albertson's deal (and there has been interest) but this is not
the environment to be selling stores.

Long term, the company acquired excellent properties at a very fair and
undervalued price with their Albertson's deal (cherry picking the best
properties and selling off the others). This is when SVU was selling at
$32.00/share (on 1/23/2006) and paid $0.16/share qtr dividend). Now at
$13.80/share, there appears to be even greater value than in January 2006 and
they have raised their dividend to $0.17/share.

SVU a BUY below $13.00. The dividend yield would be 5.3%

============================================================

I am also eyeing DU PONT E I DE NEM (NYSE: DD) below $23.00/share. I like their
investment in the Solar business with a plant in China that is now producing
product. This investment slipped under the radar and is growing double digit
even in this lousy environment. (
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25325225&srchtxt=DD ) . The
company also continues to grow their hybrid seed business in Pioneer Hybrid.
They do a lot of business in Latin America w/ thei hybrid soybean product. This
division is selling at a much lower multiple than Monsanto.

Management has weathered the economy storm well and has not cut their dividend
when many others have. They have increased their investment in China building a
2nd plant to come online soon. At current depressed prices, you get good
exposure to China & Latin America while collecting a very nice dividend. I have
also been looking at their $3.50 Preferred A shares (DDpA) which below
$50/share yield 7%. You give away some upside but do lock in a pretty good
yield.

My taxable portfolio is holding 2.4% DD and I am thinking of increasing this by
adding some more common shares and/or starting a position in the Preferred A
shares if the price trades low enough.

Dupont is a BUY below $23.00. The dividend yield would be 7.1%.
Dupont Preferred A shares below $50.00. Yield just over 7%

===============================================================

The market may provide another great buying opportunity in the next 90 days so
I have been building up cash and updating my watch/buy list. Both SVU and DD
are on my list.

DD is a tough one for me to figure based on metrics I like. I typically key off
book value, and for DD bv rises and falls. That throws off any of my metrics
based on equity. I'll have to consider some other way of getting a handle on
this one. Maybe relative dividend yield, because dividend is holding and
dividend yield is relatively large.

I see analysts may have divergent opinions on DD too: Credit Suisse with an
outperform (in April) and S&P with a 1* last week (going from sell to strong
sell).

Not so easily seen by me that DD will drop to $23 any time soon. I'll put it on
my watch list though for possible further consideration.

re AAUK - why do you think that AAUK is a good value? the fact that it was

My thesis is that the inventory stocking in China will run it's course shortly

OGE is up over 4% on the news today. This is good news for many of the domestic

I understand this Massachusetts auto insurer is under much competition. Perhaps

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SAFT keep its share of the market. Competition in
the market isn't new, and in past anyway, SAFT seems to have done okay. I
presume this will continue.

Numbers I want to see are there. LTD/total capital = 0. Roe isn't so great, but
p/tangible bv = .8. Bv dropped in '01 from $17/sh to $10. Every year
thereafter, bv has risen to now almost a quadruple. Company's been profitable
in each of the last seven years. Dividend yield over 5%. Numbers drop into my
model for a buy.

Possible cautions with SAFT: Lot of March non open market sales by insiders,
according to Yahoo at around current price. Also, p/e now @7.6 goes to 8.8 says
Yahoo's consensus estimate, so analysts are expecting a poorer but still profit
upcoming year. That p/e would be high historically, since p/e has usually been
under 8.

re BMR. I think it's reasonable cheap but not extremely cheap. Reits are hard
to value now - Dividends have been slashed or worse have become stock
dividends. Net asset values are unclear but it's clear that they are much lower
than a year ago - probably down about 50% (this assumes a moderate 25% asset
value decline and a 50% leverage to start with) and most likely more - in fact
some overleveraged entities are most likely have a negative NAV at this point.
The current cap rates of around 9% are a big change relative to the 6% between
2005 and 2007 but historically speaking not a great bargain, especially since
rents and cash flow for most properties are going to fall.

BMR medical/lab property space does so far not suffer from falling rents , so I
think they are above average in terms of value decline. Also positive is that
the most recent secondary has taken care of their financing needs until Y2012.
Hopefully by that time things are looking up with CRE, even though that sector

EKS, I like that you are considering your exit strategy. That's better than
what I'm doing, which is I'm only guessing I will want hold these stocks for
several years. I like your idea of exiting when the dividend yield drops
(because the stock price has risen). I'd say 3% is an okay bogey too. The thing
is that some of these stocks yield close to 6% and some have rising dividends,
so that it may take a while (if ever) for some of these stocks to rise enough
to drop the yield to 3%.

As I said in an earlier post, I'm not so sure about revision-to-mean p/e as a
good basis. The utility stocks were deregulated, people had high expectations,
bought in, and raised the general p/e levels. Appears to have taken several
years (a decade?), but now some sort of reality or realism or expectation level
exists it seems to me, where people don't view utilities as having such good
growth prospects and so not worth the higher p/e's of the past few years. We
seem to be back to the older 9-11 p/e level vs. the recent 15x level (which I
view as growth territory). Whether this "new" p/e level now correctly reflects
utilities' prospects, I don't know.

----
Aside: in reviewing past posts I see I didn't respond to an interesting post
you made regarding Canadian utilities. I had not considered this sector a
possibility, and I'm not following any now. Also, I don't know about the tax
consequences for USA holders of Canadian utilities. I read where the Canadian
utilities in a USA ira might not have to pay the Canadian withholding tax: I
don't know how that would work though. For the Canadian stocks I have in my
taxable account, my accountant prepares a Form 1116, a complex thing that's
incomprehensible to me.

I'll take on an exploratory few shares of HOS. Hornbeck is a shipping company:
offshore supply vessels to oil and gas industry and a tug & barge business.
Tangible bv per SI is near $30/sh with stock currently near $20.50. Forward p/e
is low (under 6x),if analysts estimates are to be believed.

Negatives for me are ltd/capital of about 50% (may be typical though for the
sector), only about five years of public history, and the stock, while down
from recent levels, is still a double from March lows.

HOS should be in a business that does okay as long as off-shore wells are
pumping. (The demand will be there for ships. Whether the supply of ships will
enable profits among all the competitors, I don't know. So far though, HOS's
good net profit margins seem to be holding up okay,)

re HOS - not the cheapest company in the supply ship business based on the
metrics I look at. based on EV/EBITDA and EV/Revenue the large peer TDW is
cheaper by at least 20%. HOS P/E is lower but that is not a leverage adjusted
metric.

HOS is not efficiently run from an asset perspective - for they do 430M$
revenue with 1.4B$ in assets (property plant and equipment or 30c/$ in hard
assets) while TDW does 1.4B$ with 2B$ (70c/$ in hard assets). I think this is
mostly due to HOS newbuild program. HOS fleet is younger which is good but they
still have substantial newbuilds expenses in the near term future that seem to
get close to their existing credit capacity. TDW on the other hand seems to
base their Capex on their expected cash flow and hence they have very little
debt. I don't think that book value is that great of a measure either since
most newbuilds in the recent years have been build at very bloated costs - so
they may sit on their balance sheet above replacement cost.

Yes, you may be right, I see now that TDW may be the better bet. I'm going to
have to do more work on this shipping/services industry. I'm looking at three
companies with a disparity among metrics, and after looking over some of their
investor presentations, I'm not sure how to put the metrics in context or how
relevant they might be.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/co?s=HOS

Ltd/total capital = .46 for HOS.
Ltd/total capital = .35 for CKH.
Ltd/total capital = .12 for TDW.

TDW has increased its dividend and now yields 2%, one of the few with a
dividend, and the highest yield of among companies in its sector. Unlike HOS,
TDW has a reasonably-long public history. TDW has been profitable in each of
the past ten years. That can't be said for HOS.

HOS trades farther below its tangible bv than does CKH or TDW. TDW trades at
$41.76 which is above its tbv of $37.06/sh

HOS has higher gross margins than either CKH or TDW.

Right now, I'm left with the impression that HOS might be cheaper than TDW on
some metrics, but TDW is good enough (based on its historical results) that it
may be the better bet because of its conservative balance sheet (low debt) and
larger size.

Yes, ALL's tangible bv has been crushed, and ALL's dividend chopped.

Of course, so has the stock price. The current dividend yield annualizes to
about 3.3%, which isn't very attractive. And that management had to cut the
dividend is itself very worrisome.

At the current lowered stock price, p/bv = 1.05 and p/tbv = 1.13. That's not
too bad. In normal years p/bv has varied roughly between 1.4-1.8. If credit
market improves and/or management can get better control of the company's poor

Hi Paul - I like your idea of focusing on the offshore oil shipper/service
industry. This sector is not as impacted by the wild swings in the business
cycle as the dry bulk shippers. Also, the new builds hitting the market for
this sector s/b less than in dry bulk.

I look at the average contract term for the fleet and when they roll over and
at what day rates. The longer the better.

From the 2007 Hornbeck Offshore Services, Inc. (HOS) Annual Report:

o "Many of the contracts we enter into for our vessels are full utilization
contracts with initial terms ranging from one to five years...."

o "All of our OSVs operate under time charters, including twelve that are
chartered under long-term contracts with expiration dates ranging from
September 2008 through June 2012.'"

o "We now have 16 of our tank barges operating under time charters, including
seven that are chartered under long-term contracts with expiration dates
ranging from April 2008 through August 2009..."

o "Our tank barge utilization increased to 92.7% for 2006 compared to 87.1% for
2005, due primarily to our continued shift in contract mix from COAs to time
charters...."

For years ended December 31: <pre> <u> 2007 2006 2005 </u>
Average OSV dayrate $ 21,505 $ 19,380 $ 13,413 </pre>

Therefore, the company rolls over their vessel contracts quite frequently
(compared to SFL where their average Fleet contract term is 14 years). I
suspect this is quite standard for the offshore/service shipping sector. This
could be a positive if forward day rates are rising. The future cash flows can
be significantly impacted if during any one year the company is exposed to a
large number of vessel contract renewals. HOS may be front loaded with a
significant number of vessel contract renewals coming due in 2008-2009. It's
not clear from their 2007 annual report what has been renewed in 2008 - 2009
period and if they smoothed out their contract commitments (or even have tried
to extend them).

I have always liked the low PE's in this industry but dislike the leverage that
some of these companies utilize. After much review, I have opted for companies
that have a diversified fleet with much longer contract vessel terms. A good
dividend payout is a plus too. Both FRO and SFL have structured contracts that
set a fixed ROI (for each vessel under contract) plus an incentive payout bonus
share for extra profits earned over the period.

I particularly like the deep drill platforms and hope to start a position when
Dry's spins off their deep drilling subsidiary of 4 platforms.

Thank you for sharing your interest and screening for companies in this "niche"
sector. The offshore oil shipper/service industry is one I have not really
looked at and may be one where you buy a few shares in all three of the
mentioned companies. My approach would be to take some funds I have allocated
to my integrated oil holdings and spread it around in this sector.

There was some discussion that the integrated oil companies may be more exposed
to the Cap & Trade tax (through their refinery exposure) which would impact
their future growth in earnings even though there is growth in diversified oil
sector. Perhaps one could capture a bit of this growth by holding a few of
these offshore shipping/service companies w/o the risk from Cap & Trade
legislation.

I'm still in San Francisco, but should be back to normal next week. This state

honor the IOU's only thru July 10. Arnold wants to have a bake sale to cure the

I agree on CA. the only way to fix this mess is with massive cut in
expenditures. I think the state budged has expanded by 8%+ annual during 2003
from a high base to begin with. This is simply not sustainable. i think the
state, city and counties need to lay off a lot of employees and probably cut
pay for the rest, privatize prisons, sell of assets etc. it probably taxes a
bankruptcy to get there.

Sticking the head in the sand will not help and raising taxes even more is not
going to work either and will just accelerate the exodus more.

Up to 26% of U.S. homeowners who stop paying their mortgage may be doing so
intentionally, not because they can't make the payments but because they don't
want to put money into a house that's worth less than what they owe. That
finding, from a paper by economists at the University of Chicago, Northwestern
University and the European University Institute, raises some doubt about the
approach the Obama Administration has taken toward stabilizing the housing
market. The current approach focuses on whether or not homeowners can afford
their monthly payments, and largely ignores the fact that some 20% of
homeowners owe more than their house is worth — a situation known as negative
equity, or being "underwater," which, according to the paper's findings, may
itself trigger default.

* These houses were made for walking
* House of Cards: The Faces Behind Foreclosures

The paper's authors caution that their statistics are not exact and should be
taken primarily as an indication that there is a looming problem, one that
needs to be addressed. The 26% figure comes from a series of consumer surveys
that feed into the Booth Chicago/Kellogg School Financial Trust Index. In
December 2008 and again in March 2009, 1,000 people were surveyed and asked,
among other things, if they knew anyone who had defaulted on a mortgage, and if
they knew anyone who had defaulted on a mortgage even if he or she could afford
to make the monthly payment. By taking the ratio of the two answers, the
economists calculated that more than a quarter of defaults are, as they put it,
"strategic." (Read "Home Sales Perk Up, but Expensive Houses Languish.")

"They can still afford to pay but they decide not to," says Paola Sapienza, a
finance professor at Northwestern University and one of the paper's authors.
"It's very easy to do this in the U.S." Even though there are serious
consequences to reneging on a home loan — including wrecked credit, not being
able to buy another house for years to come, the cost of moving and the social
stigma associated with being a person who does not honor one's commitments —
lenders tend not to pursue former homeowners for the money they are owed
because of the prohibitive cost of tracking down such people and suing them.

Notably, other survey data included in the paper suggest the percentage of
intentional defaults may be much lower than 26%. The researchers also asked if
respondents themselves would welsh on their mortgages if they were $50,000
underwater. Among the people for whom $50,000 represented less than 10% of
their home's value, none would walk away. However, once $50,000 represented
between 10% and 20% of the house's value, 5% said they would walk away, and
when the shortfall reached 50% of home's value, a full 17% said they would.
(See "Renting a Modernist House.")

When the shortfall amount in question was $100,000, the walk-away responses
accelerated at a faster rate. Some 7% of people said they would intentionally
default when a $100,000 shortfall represented less than 10% of their house's
value. Once that shortfall represented between 50% and 60% of the home's value,
an entire 25% of respondents said they would walk away. The hesitation to
intentionally default when the theoretical amount of negative equity was
$50,000, even when representing the same percentage of a home's value, may
relate to the high fixed costs that come with walking away, such as moving.

intentionally, not because they can't make the payments but because they don't
want to put money into a house that's worth less than what they owe. 

That percentage is probably understated in bubble areas. I know a few who
stopped doing payments and went into foreclosure. I actually advised some
friends to do so because their house is hopelessly under water and they were
paying 50%+ of their disposable income (which has gone down due to economy) for
housing. Since this is not a sustainable situation, I advised them to do a
shortsale which they are going right right now. Renting (a smaller house) will
only consume <30% of their income.

Loan modification in this case would nor work, unless it is combined with a
reduction in principle. Anyways examples like this taught me that every loan
that is underwater enough (15%+ of he housing value) is subprime no matter what
the credit scores of the borrower.

The news yesterday afternoon carried this one up into the sell zone for me.
Started taking it off at 1.60, 1.75, and was shocked to get the balance out at
1.80. Done and done! I had seen CIT talked about over here quite a lot during
the market panic. Yesterday just seemed like the perfect storm of catalysts as
it pertains to news flow (it was in play), sentiment, volume, price action, and
the potential for a bail out.

I may try this one again as this morning's gap has been filled, and it's still
holding it's very short term trend line from yesterday. I'm not sure if Dunkin'
Donuts and Dillard's qualify as systemic risk, so this one may go flop. And
that's what's going to make this one a trading vehicle for the balance of the
week.....the uncertainty surrounding it.

Ok, IMO to put and alert on a special situation out, at least in my opinion.
Just don't expect too many responses here, since it is not a trading board.
Well some of those trades become pretty good values if they don't work out :-).

CIT is a special situation and really has lost their business model ever since
they don't have access to cheap short term funding via commercial paper
anymore. I played this one also (based on tangible book) but once I realized
the extent of the evolving credit crunch I decided to stay away. it is
impossible for CIT to survive if they have to compete with banks that can
borrow short term funds at Libor (0.5%), unless the government decides to give
them a hand and provide the cheap funding. This is not something that I feel I
can handicap or trade well , so i tend to pass on these types of situations.

From Barron's today:

CIT Issues to Weigh on Bank Sector
Fox-Pitt sees wider commercial-credit deterioration across the group.

Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller

CIT GROUP (TICKER: CIT) announced that it has yet to be approved for the
Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), rekindling investor fears
regarding long-term viability of the company, due to lack of availability of
diversified funding sources.

The announcement increases the risk of eventual bankruptcy, which would have
negative implications for CIT's creditors, including large-cap banks, which
hold a portion of its secured and unsecured debt.

CIT is still engaged in discussions with regulators regarding liquidity
improvement measures (including but not limited to TLGP participation),
according to media reports.

CIT has $3.1 billion in bank debt outstanding ($5.2 billion at March 31 less
$2.1 billion repaid on April 13), which represents under 5% of total
liabilities ($68.2 billion at March 31). Additional liabilities include $2.1
billion of junior subordinated debt and $18.6 billion of secured borrowings
(including a $3.0 billion credit line from Goldman Sachs (GS) and a $500
million credit line from Wells Fargo (WFC)). A large number of CIT's secured
borrowings are in the form of InterNotes (corporate bonds designed for
individual investors).

Estimated greatest bank exposures: Goldman ($1.6 billion); Wells Fargo ($324
million); Bank of America (BAC) ($307 million); JPMorgan Chase (JPM) ($240
million); Citigroup (C) ($155 million); and Morgan Stanley (MS) ($97 million).
Exposure appears to be unsecured except for Goldman and Wells Fargo. Goldman
provided a secured credit line with max draw of $3.0 billion ($2.4 billion
currently outstanding, with $800 million margin balance against it) while Wells
Fargo provided $219 million through a secured credit line (max draw $500
million) and approximately $105 million through unsecured bank borrowings
(including legacy Wachovia accounts). Bank of America has approximately $307
million unsecured exposure (including legacy Merrill Lynch accounts).

The loss content for banks is likely minimal (if any) given CIT's asset
composition and its current capital position. Additionally, we believe exposure
may already be reserved for by banks, as CIT liquidity worries are not new. We
estimate loss content of $9.8 billion (or 13%) for CIT's asset portfolio, which
would wipe out the entire $7.4 billion of equity (both common and preferred,
including Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) holdings), $2.1 billion of
junior subordinated debt and about $231 million of senior unsecured bank debt,
representing 7.4% of $3.1 billion currently outstanding.

If CIT were to liquidate, we expect that unsecured creditors will not be wiped
out entirely, as CIT still has a significant amount of unencumbered assets on
its balance sheet. Based on Bloomberg data, we believe most of the $2.1 billion
subordinated notes are held by institutional investors, including mutual funds
and insurance companies (no significant bank exposure was reported).

CIT issues will likely weigh on bank sector given credit exposure and a
reminder that commercial-asset quality is next to deteriorate in what is
turning out to be a full credit cycle. We expect that wider commercial-credit
deterioration across the bank sector will put pressure on earnings through
second-half 2009, with a peak in commercial-credit losses likely in 2010.

Jayt, you can count me in as a rookie that does not know the difference between

loss at all in more than 20 years of investing (or spekulation <g> ) was

I don't think that with an investment a stop loss is the right thing to do

way or another that a situation where one needs to consider. But believing that

E*Trade is not bad but they are too expensive nowadays, even with the

think the brokerage arm will end up being acquired. I have gotten spoiled by
Interactivebrokers where a 100 share trade is 1$ (I love buying in small
increments). Optionhouses' 2.95$ for a stock trade looks reasonable. I am going
to test drive their virtual account and see how it goes. IB has a virtual
account as well, worth a test drive imo (although the learning curve with them
is steeper than with most others).

E-trade. You can trade foreign (non-USA) securities on several country's

Also from a couple of your posts I've learned that in E-Trade's research
section there are often some analysts reports (that I don't find at my other
brokerage accounts) that can be very helpful.

Additionally I've found E-trade does pretty good in getting timely pinksheet
quotes for "F" and "Y" stocks. Better (because it's on-line), and sometimes
cheaper (sometimes no foreign desk charge) than other brokers with whom I have
accounts.

OT- re E*Trade. I am aware of the ability to trade foreign exchanges, but the
commissions are too high. First I need to purchase the foreign currency which
costs me 1% and then I need to make a trade which costs commission as well..
Apparently they have not figured out how to do this with margin where the
foreign exchange automatically gets purchases with the trade.

IB is similar in and IRA where margin is not allowed but I can buy foreign
exchange much cheaper (I think it's 2.5$ for any sum) and the foreign exchange
trades are cheaper as well). In a margin account I don't have to buy any Forex
at all before the trade but I need to understand that I am short the amount of
Forex that i incurred in the trades (Plus the commission). If I want, I can
straighten out the short position purchasing the Forex after the trade. Better
than E*Trade where I most likely will end up with some residual Forex that I
probably don't have any use for.

Don't want to advertise IB here but they do know trading. It's a little bit
like playing with a loaded gun though if you don't know what you are doing.
However you can test out stuff using the virtual account. My wive call IB "The

re CIT. Those financing markets appear to be fairly large so i think the impact
may be small. Also CIT was already putting the feet on the brakes in terms of
new loans for more than a year now, so I guess they have not been competing
much (effectively already in runoff mode for quite some time).

Last not least I do not think that CIT will go entirely out of business. The
equity most likely is worthless , the debt will be converted and my best guess
is that a bank (which currently has a very low cost of capital) will buy all or
pieces of the business and earn a nice spread on risky assets bought for a nice
discount. Again the problem for CIT was that their cost of capital went up
astronomical and destroyed their spread. FWIW, same would happen with GE
finance if they had to stand on their own, but they are lucky enough to have
access to cheap FED funds (those lobbyist really earned their money) plus the
backing from GE industrial. If anything the CIT failure tells me that GE
finance by itself is worthless but that is almost reflected in GE's market
price.

can be redeemed after January 11 2011 at the par value of $25/share plus any
accumulated dividend payments due.

The annual dividend payment is $1.81/share which yields 17.20% (at my current
buy price of $10.55.share). This seems like a pretty good return as long as
their portfolio of commercial real estate (including rent rolls) stabilize
and/or the company continues to build up their balance sheet by reducing debt.

Here is a recent sale where they booked a small capital gain but more
importantly retired $5M of debt. This is a good sale considering the state of
the current market.

LMI Solutions Buys Phoenix Warehouse for $4.3M
First Industrial Sells 82,300-SF Facility for $55 PSF
http://www.costar.com/News/Article.aspx?id=197A77DA898F63B6137C0A237B560A70

I expect to hold this position through 2011 and hopefully FR will redeem the
shares for $25/share. Otherwise, I will take the 17.2% dividend and can hedge
the position by selling FR common shares if things get really sour.

It seems like this is a good value proposition especially if I am expecting a
long "L" recovery for the U.S. commercial real estate market.

oh my god a functioning financial system? in what context? In the context ofr
putting large bonuses in the hands of a chosen few while the US taxpayers
shoulder increasing amounts of debt? and fewer and fewer jobs are available?
CIT is actually much more important to the US economy than AIG was. Many many
more US jobs have been generated by companies funded by CIT. Had they let AIG
go down the tubes, the whole derivative house of cards would have come tumbling
down and and we could start to build something real. Instead we are going to
continue to use monopoly money until everyone realizes it really is monopoly
money, and then we will suddenly realize that we can only make movies and sell
hamburgers and pizza and soda.

Sadly the states are running out of money, they are borrowing from Peter to pay
Paul, whether Peter likes it or not. Where I am Hospitals are now having to sue
Mass. to get paid. But I suppose If GS can pay out big bonusses you think it
means all is well.

Paulson didnt put out a fire, he was the original arsonist. GS invented the
slice and dice mortgage and cajoled the rating agencies to rate the paper,
something they were proven incompetent to do. For all we know they probably
advised AIG on insuring it too. But I guess we will never know that piece of
it.
We still dont regulate derivatives and what I take from all of this is that our
regulators have been incompetent, another area that has yet to be addressed by
congress or the current administration. No one really has investigated how
Friedman was able to obtain a waiver so that he could buy more GS stock while
at the same time regulating GS as president of the new york reserve bank.
Curious that the various Czars in the Obama administration have no
accountability to Congress at all.
so we have learned nothing from this either.

interesting article in last weeks barrons about how they felt speculators were
pushing up the market in commodities earlier, Now they are talking about
setting limits on long positions for speculators but then they announce that
swap traders ( I assume that means GS) would be exempt from the proposed
regulation. such a crock.

I remain in disbelief that no-one in Congress is proposing that GS regurgitate
back some of the $13.6 Billion it pulled out of US taxpayers thanks to aig and
Paulson, before they think about paying out bonuses. If I were a shareholder I
would suggest that shareholders are entitled to same amount in dividends that
they pay out in bonuses. But like most stocks it reminds me of the the novice
investor who puts up the money to finance a venture in partnership with an

GS "Value at risk" is at an all time high according to a chart that I saw
somewhere (probably the WSJ). They are trading as if the Y2008 metltdown did
not happen. I agree I would not want to be shareholder in GS shares but at
least they seem to know what they are doing. The FED needs to make sure once
they exit TGLP (government guaranteed debt issues) that they will not provide
any more guarantees any more and GS and it's counterparties are on their own.
Same with JPM, MS or anybody else. Also the wild est unregulated markets

A big story that got a little lost in all the earnings and healthcare headlines
this week comes to us out of California. The California Public Employees'
Retirement System (aka CalPERS) - the nation’s largest pension fund - is suing
Wall Street’s top three credit rating agencies.

CalPERS blames Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings
for more than $1 billion in investment losses. The suit filed in San Francisco
Superior Court, claims ratings agencies gave investments "wildly inaccurate and
unreasonably high" grades.

According to published reports, spokesmen for the rating agencies claim the
allegations in the CalPERS lawsuit are meritless and said they would seek a
dismissal as quickly as possible.

But Dan Alpert, founder of the boutique investment bank Westwood Capital,
thinks CalPERS has a case: “The ratings agencies took liberties here they never
should have” when they handed out AAA ratings on securities backed by subprime
mortgages, among other other risky housing-related securities, he says.

Alpert believes the agencies lost their way as “gatekeepers” during the halcyon
days and ignored warning signs the housing bubble was about to burst.
“Consequently, they are at risk right now for lawsuits on a whole variety of
cases,” he says. The CalPERS suit is
“just the tip of the iceberg.”

Beyond Moody’s, Fitch and S&P’s parent McGraw-Hill, Alpert thinks the legal
fallout could spread to the Wall Street firms that created these toxic assets
in the first place. “Goldman Sachs at $150 -- one might say, what’s risk they
face going forward in litigation risk?,” Alpert muses.
Because “the amounts at stake here were in the trillions…the damages may be
immense.”

You don’t have to remind CalPERS, they lost a total of $60 billion last year,
one of the biggest casualties of a credit bubble in which the rating agencies
played a central role.

My guess is that this calpers suit is going to get settled quickly and quietly
with a confidential agreement. no one wants to open this pandora box.

Sold my starter position in OGE Energy Corp. (OGE). Collected the 5.5% dividend
and decided to book my 16% return from my recent buy in May.

I started to build back up my only bank position, New York Community Bancorp
Inc. (NYB) which I sold a large portion of early last year at much higher
levels. The company has continued to make it's dividend which now yields around
10%. I consider this bank stock to be one of the better managed banks w/o
little to no loan defaults. They never took any TARP monies when it was being
handed out.

NYB announces earnings next week and they already alerted the market that they
raised their quarterly guidance. They make money on their spread which is
larger than normal since their cost of funds is so small.

I have no other direct exposure to financials than a few shares of the ETF XLF.
It seems like a good time to nibble at some NYB at current depressed levels. If
the economy is really going to turn the corner in 2010, then it's probably a
good time to look at some of the better quality banking stocks.

NYB. If they haven't upped their loan reserves substantially by now, nor cut
the dividend by now even as some sort of "prudent" measure, they maybe have
some confidence in what they are doing. I believe I've heard ceo/chair Mr.
Ficalora interviewed, and if he was the guy, he is one sharp/shrewd bank
executive and acquirer, from my impression.
====
On the one hand, the stated book value for the past few years seems to be stuck
in the $12/sh area . Otoh, at least it hasn't been decimated in the last 12
months. Couple this with the current $1 dividend on a roughly $11 stock, that
is 9%...if the dividend and price hold.

Imo, NYB within a diversified portfolio could be a decent small bet while
waiting for better times.

I'm in for a few shares now at market close.

Hi Paul - I am not sure if NYB is the best bank out there but I do believe it
is time to start building back positions in a few financials if they were sold
into our most recent financial crash... which I did in spades.

NYB is one I have followed and owned for over ten years so I am very familiar
with their products (service multi-family apartment/rehab loan portfolio).
Loans are made for condo conversion projects in New York a rent controlled
city. Typical loan is 70% loan/value with a three - five year pay back period.
They have zero to no loan defaults in their primary multi-family loan products.
Any defaults they ever had were from loans they acquired from previous mergers
several years ago.

I have sold some shares at $29 and more recently dumped 1/2 of my shares
between $16-$19. I figure buying new shares around $10-$11 is a good entry
point as long as we have seen the worst of the banking problems.

Banco Bradesco S.A. (BBD) is one I should begin buying again but it might have
gotten away as I see it now trades around $15.00/share. My last buy was around
$21.00 in June 2008 near it's all time high. I have a very small position so
perhaps I will add a few shares on any significant pull back around $10/share.
The dividend is small and at 12 PE it is not a steal at current levels. I do
like the long term growth potential for Latin America but I believe there will
be plenty of time to acquire shares especially if the U.S. stays in a recession
longer than expected.

Did you notice the recent run XOM has had? I think CVX is a better buy.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=XOM,CVX&d=s
I wonder if the oils are setting up for another run higher.

Still a pretty good run from July 13 2009 to now....just over 9%.

A move to 1121 on the S&P represents only a 50% retracement from our high of
1576 S&P October 2007 to our low 667 S&P March 2009. We closed today at 954.48
S&P.

If we only get back to our 50% retracement level, there is another 17% run left
or about 1,500 Dow points left in some sustained recovery rally. Could we test
a Dow 10.400 by July 2010. If so, then the next 90 days may offer our last
chance to accumulate our value buys.

EKS, heartening to me that you have followed NYB for a good while, both the
stock and what they loan, and that you are positive enough to be a buyer around
current price.

My comments on the other stocks you've mentioned:

I hold a full position in BBD. I show I began acquiring in '07, with adds
subsequently. I'm 20% underwater on the position. If it drops back around $10
on no adverse news, I likely will add more shares.

I hold a small position in XOM, acquired recently. I have had an open order
since 7/16 to buy more at %67.50.

I have held about a full position in CVX for a while. My last buy was 9/'08
@$79.60/sh. (An oops, given the stock is now $66.25.)
My largest holding of an integrated major is OXY. Not intentionally. Position
just crept up on me. Have held it several years, longer than the others;
reinvested the dividends in stock in the early years.

I'm not finding so many value stock opportunities now. They may be there, but
either I miss them or don't understand their situation/outlook or their
reported numbers.

Contrarian play or value trap - that is the big question. Certainly cheap if

sheet is in decent shape. in the past they held their own against larger

NYB not a bad bank and a low risk business model (mortgages on rent controlled

the dividend - the slightest problem and the dividend is due for a very deep

Added some FRpJ 7 1/2% preferred to the IRA account. The annual dividend
payment is $1.81/share which yields 17.30% at my cost.

This is a good holding for the IRA since every quarter it spins off $0.45 tax
free. I converted some of my treasury bond money that currently yields 0.005%.

The investment should double in 5.7 years w/ a very small risk of default.

First Industrial Realty Trust Inc. (FR) owns 70 million square feet with 56
million sqft leased under long term contracts. No real maturities are due until
2011. They just sold a vacant industrial building in AZ in the worst market
ever for $55 per square foot all cash.

Their break even price per square foot at "extreme foreclosure liquidation" is
around $38 per square foot (70Mx$38/ft). Their long term and preferred debt
totals $2.7 Billion. This debit total assumes that all of their preferred
series debit is paid off at par $25.00/share (per their liquidation terms in
their prospectus).

Therefore, unless the commercial real estate sector in the US totally falls off
a cliff and drops another 40% (in a fire side foreclosure sale), FR still s/b
able to pay off these preferred series in full w/ payment of any accumulated
deferred dividends too. To date no preferred dividends have been deferred. Only
last quarter did the company suspend the dividend on their common shares in
order to preserve their capital

As an extra bonus, you can buy these at a 58% discount to the $25/share IPO par
value ($10.50/$25 par value = 42%).

I continue to buy these at or around $10.50/share in size but you have to be
patient because they are thinly traded.
