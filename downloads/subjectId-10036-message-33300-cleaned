Hedged a small portion of my SVU shares bought in November by selling a few of
the April $20 calls. My thought was to try to tweak my return by collecting the
next dividend and possibly the $1.40 call premium. If the market stays in a
trading range for the next few months, I do not expect the stock to be called
away. If it does get called, I will be able to book my first profit for 2009.
It won't help too much with my carry forward losses from 2008, but every bit
helps.

I am looking at similar strategies with some of my other high dividend payers
where I have a substantial short term gain that I do not want to give back. The
call premiums out three months are pretty attractive. If the market stays in a
narrow trading range, then this is free money that adds to my overall portfolio
return.

Here are a few I am looking to buy on the next move down.

Perhaps an Obama honeymoon will limit our move down even with an economy that
is sick. There just does not seem to be too many investors willing to commit
new money for the long term. From what I can tell, there are a lot of swing
traders holding stocks for only days with a "hold cash" bias.

STT -
STT posted an shocking (IMO) 8k today: the unrealized market to market losses
are 5.5B$ as of 12/31/08. Tangible equity is about 6B$ as of 9/30/08 so
theoretically that is all gone. Now unrealized losses due not need to
acknowledged if management does not assume them to be other then temporary.
Great! But 3.6B$ of those unrealized losses sit in this infamous conduit. If
this conduit needs to be consolidated on STT's balance sheet those losses need
to be realized - so this even would reduce STT tangible value to about 2B$.

Then on the other hands I read about the high tier 1 leverage ratios of STT
(8.4%, 16% risk based). It seems that my simple math would indicate that STT is
almost illiquid (tangible equity depleted by market to market losses) while
their regulatory capital is just fine. Well STT is supposed to be one of the
stronger banks.FWI i don't own STT right now but i think given the choice I
would sleep better being short than long the shares.

 As of December 31, 2008, there were $5.5 billion of after-tax net unrealized
losses associated with our portfolio of investment securities available for
sale and held to maturity.

Thoughts on GTI:

Although GTI has more than doubled from its November low, GTI appears to be
significantly undervalued at its current price.

1) Unlike many materials companies, GTI's balance sheet is solid. The company
has a debt/equity ratio of 0.28. It has an Altman's Z score of 3.6, which
indicates that GTI has sufficient resources to weather the next two years with
little risk of bankruptcy.

2) GTI has a price/FCF of 6.4, trades only 20% above its replacement value
(Tobin Q-ratio is 1.18), and with a P/E ratio of under 5, it trades at a 45%
discount to the industry average P/E. Although these are based on historical
earnings (i.e. the first two qtrs of 2008, when steel consumption was higher)
steel consumption in 2009 is expected to decline only 5%, and at most 10%, from
2008 levels. Because of demand growth in other business lines (such as from the
transportation and energy industries) and expected electrode price increases,
forward P/E should actually decrease to 4.5 from the current level of 4.6
(TTM).

The key negative, as I see it, is growth in the accruals ratio (i.e. ratio of
non-cash earnings to total assets). Relatively higher levels of non-cash
earnings (rising or high accruals ratio) suggest that non-cash items are
driving earnings. Academic research in the 90s and 00s has showed that growth
in the accruals ratio is negative for stock performance, and this has
historically been true for GTI.

BK earnings release was moved forward to quell market fears. BK also has high

so much.

STT is an interesting case. The base business is solid but the market to market
losses and the SIV (assets on the SIV need to be immediately valued at market
if the SIV is consolidated) and the commercial paper liabilities attached to
that unfortunate blemish is killing them. STT needs to be recapitalized (Tarp

Hi Paul - I own some Treasury Strips in my IRA account and noticed that over
the last 90 days they increased significantly due to the flight to quality
Treasury securities. I peeled off a portion and plan to buy some of the HRP
Series D Preferred shares with a quarterly distribution of $0.4063/share
(HRPpD).

This is the most actively traded preferred of all the series but still is a bit
thinly traded. What has been your experience in getting fills? Do you put in
GTC orders and wait for your price or rather try to split the middle of the
Hi/Low for the day?

Two distributions from the HRPpD (six months) equals six years to maturity for
my Treasury strip. It seems like a no brainer to switch into the HRP preferred
as long as HRP remains solvent. I will take that bet with a small buy.

================================================================

Bought some more COP yesterday and plan to sell some XOM in March or April
since it looks like COP is replacing their reserves at a better rate than XOM.
I also like COP's exposure to NG. COP's dividend is higher than XOM now around
4%.

I am also looking to add some Spectra Energy Corp. (SE)if it cracks $14/share.
They have lots of debt but I like their NG distribution network. I believe NG
will eventually benefit from an Obama administration as they move towards an
integrated (green) energy policy. SE makes most of their money on both the
distribution and storage of NG.

EKS. My gtc tactics vary depending on a number of reasons. Moslty based on
stock amounts already held and at what price I established the position. In
general, I'm trying to use volatility such that I don't step up for anything
and I'm trying to buy near recent or 12-mo. lows.

I keep telling myself I really want to pump up my position quickly at once to a
full amount on some of these stock drops in order to trade on what has been the
reverting upswing. The trade always looks so good in hindsight. In actuality,
some of the times I've tried it, the stocks have not recovered. So my courage
fails me now, and I'm just adding small amounts.

For PG, my tactic is to increase my position every 50c share drop in price. I'm
doing that with a couple of other holdings too.

Some stocks I just want to get more of if they'll hit 12-mo lows again - SYY,
or drop near cash value - DSWL.

---
I have HRP, more common than preferred, but both.

I like SE for its pipeline and storage also. I don't have an order in for more
now. If I were considering adding (and I might) I might do similar as you: Pick
an amount close to the 12-mo low and put on a gtc order. Low is $13.36 - looks
like at a panic day - a round low number seems to be $14 (not seen since Dec),
stock close though at $14.10-$14.15 lows past couple of days. So yes, for me,
I'd place a gtc order anywhere under $14. If it filled, it might be traded
profitably soon thereafter at a higher price (short-term consideration) or held
for the pretty good dividend and possible long-term cap. appreciation. With me,
knowing that I could be impatient, maybe in a couple days rationalizing what's
10-15c, just place or move part or maybe all of the gtc order to $14.15.

Aside: I fight my impatience by following a bunch of stocks so that I reduce my
focus and dependence. So for example as regards SE, my tendency would be to see
that I missed it these past couple of days at $14.15 or so, and it's now around
$14.70. I might up my buy order to $14.50- $14.60 (which is still a decent
price, imo). By having several stocks with gtc's, it's just easier for me not
to have to chase, and I can wait for the stock to come to me. And if it
doesn't, too bad. There seem to be others that will.

How do you guys handle your gtc orders?

Well a lot of us had the right idea about banks last year. I remember we had
discussions about shorting banks in June 2008, but i suspect none of us really
followed up on the idea. Shorting is not an easy thing to do but i am convinced
that shorting/speculating against bubbles can make more money that being long.

I have largely avoided US banks or even financials but dabbled in Asian banks
(DBSDY, WF) under the assumption that they would be OK. Turned out to be a
disaster for the most part (despite some decent trades). I never thought that
this mortgage mess could bring the whole system down

Now I do own some USB which is relatively solid and probably cheap but
according to the ticker tape it trades like a piece of garbage. Nationalization
of most of the sector is a possibility. Other nations have done it (Sweden)

JNJ at current prices.

If PFE does complete the buy of Wyeth, I would probably scale down my PFE

Although you directed your question to Paul, my own strategy is to buy shares

that the 250MM - 8B market cap range is the sweet spot for major pharma on the
hunt for acquisitions to restore their pipelines.

Also, consider that the primary care marketing model that worked in the 90s and
early 00s is dead. The growth doesn't exist there, and the PC therapies will
come under pricing assault under Obama. There are some great opportunities with
companies whose therapies are concentrated in critical care or oncology. These

Really? Of the ones I listed, CEPH, for example, has both positive earnings (in
fact a PE of 22) and positive cash flow. SEPR has positive earnings and a P/E
of less than 4 (although it is facing a patent expiration of Lunesta, after
which the P/E should be about 10). ILMN, AMRI, and MDCO also have positive
earnings. VRTX has negative earnings, but their pipeline is in some therapeutic
areas with a high unmet need.

Had Pfizer not made a play for Wyeth, it probably would have ended up with
negative earnings within the next five years, and yet many analysts are touting
it as a safe stock. Nearly all of the major pharma face the same hurdle during
the next five to eight years. If they can make it to 2018-2020, most likely the
second generation of biologics will start coming to market. But in the interim,
there is a pipeline void at major pharma companies that can only be filled with
acquisitions.

It is the pipeline that matters. Each molecule is, by itself, a negative cash
flow business in the beginning due to the heavy cost of clinical research and
registration trials. By your logic, why shouldn't a pharma company simply ditch
these money losing businesses (i.e. their pipeline)?

Every company has negative cash flow in the beginning. The startup phase is
especially long in biotech, because of the long time periods required for
registration trials.

Well, if you used to do early-phase commercialization forecasting for a major
pharma company then you perhaps can invest in such companies. I don't see how I
or mostly anyone else can. IMHO, most people - and I exclude you from most
people :) - investing in biotechs are speculators who have no clue and lose
their shirts.

Just a comment about positive earnings. I can guarantee that none of the
companies you mentioned have returned any capital invested during last 10
years. Actually it's easy. Just look at their balance sheets and find one with
positive retained earnings. Which pretty much means that anyone who invested
capital into the company would be still very much into red if they counted on
cash from business. So, why would one buy a business that loses cash for 10
years? Perhaps, as you say, for the big cahuna profits at the end. Isn't it
better to bet in the lottery though? (No, scratch that question, I know about
the societal value of early stage investors who bet their farm on unproven
concepts and usually lose. We need to celebrate their input into the progress
of our civilization. :))).

You might be able to say which ones of the listed have gone over the crest and
will generate cash/profits from here on. I cannot. I can only use historical
results and they are not pretty.

The above does not mean that all pharmas are bad businesses. Far from it. The
old big companies have been throwing off great earnings and cash flow. However,
it is possible that golden age is past and will never return. Or perhaps there
will be a paradigm shift to biologics and/or new gene-based therapies that will
lead to another low-investment-big-returns boom. It's just impossible to
outsiders to know.

I think I am with Buffett here: I have no clue which small pharmas are going to
make it, so the only thing I can invest in is the long history of some
companies to either R&D or buy their way into good products and great
profits/cash flow. Such as JNJ, PG, maybe GSK, maybe SNY, maybe WYE.

I agree that nearly all biotechs don't fit the criteria for value investing,
and are a speculation.

For myself, I try a barbell strategy: a handful of biotechs and a handful of
big steady companies. For the biotechs, I do not like to invest in the riskiest
companies that only have development phase molecules, even though this may be
where the greatest gains are to be had. I prefer to invest in companies with at
least one marketed product in disease states with a wide moat- for example,
SEPR's Alvesco (Asthma) and Brovana(COPD). And IMO the development they are
doing should be attractive to major pharma. For example, BMS and LLY are
shopping for an oncology portfolio.

In terms of major pharma worth buying, I concur with your list:

JNJ, PG, maybe GSK, maybe SNY, maybe WYE

and I would add ABT. Note that with the exception of SNY, all of these
companies have extensive CPG product lines in addition to their pharma
products. In fact, I wouldn't really consider PG a pharma company, although
they do have some blockbuster medicines. Also JNJ probably makes more money
from devices than drugs.

I think diversification away from primary care drugs will be essential to
survival over the next few years. If the US moves closer to socialized health
care, chances are that catastrophic care may be more widely available, while
routine care may suffer (e.g. MRIs "just in case" and statins as a heart
disease prophylactic).

Hi Oblomov - Several of the more risky biotech stocks have JV's with the large
Pharmas that IMO reduce the risk of holding the stock. As the biotech companies
proceed with their trials and move from phase II to phase III receive larger
payments with the eventual possibility for a buy out. This is the case with the
two I currently own (AMLN and VVUS).

I recently started a small position in Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NasdaqGS:
AMLN) who receive progress payments from LLY for their BYEITA drug.

These companies also burn through a lot of cash so I am very careful to select
only those companies that have been able to manage their cash reserves so they
have staying power to complete their drug trials. VIVUS, Inc. (NasdaqGM: VVUS)
is one I hold (a very small position) that seems to maintain their cash
reserves. I have peeled off enough shares to cover my seed money and continue
to hold as I have a very low cost basis.

My main strategy on investing in this sector is for steady dividend income with
reasonable growth as I believe this whole sector will grow with an aging
population. About 7% of my Pharma portfolio investment are in emerging biotech
companies. Maybe it might be good to add some type of sector fund that would
provide me a basket of biotech companies.

Any ideas?

I have focused on those companies that develop drugs and devises for the
diabetes market as this disease is growing in the US. NOVO NORDISK A S (NYSE:
NVO) and LILLY ELI CO (NYSE: LLY) are a few of the large companies I am looking
at. LLY is my favorite as their current dividend is now yielding 5.2%.

Another area that would complement my Pharma holdings are drug stores that
would benefit from the distribution of generic drugs. CVS, WAG, WMT and COST
might be possible value plays. I recently sold my WAG but might start a small
position if we see new lows. Many of these companies have recently started an
inexpensive generic drug program which should generate more traffic in the
store.

Given the large percentage of money spent on health care (insurance, hospital,
drugs, prevention etc) and the continued increase in costs (even in a
deflationary environment), I thought it might be wise to increase my portfolio
exposure from 8% to something higher. Most middle class families spend 10%-20%
of their income on health care and related services. Since the Obama
administration wants to promote universal coverage, I expect continued growth
in expenditures for all of these services.

CAI Int'l Staying Contained
Wednesday December 31, 10:47 am ET
By Ann Heffron, CFA

Founded in 1989, CAI International, Inc. (NYSE: CAP - News) is the one of the
world's largest intermodal container leasing and management company, with
roughly a 6% market share of the worldwide leased container fleet. This
consists of standardized steel boxes used to transport cargo by a number of
means, including ship, truck, and rail.

We are maintaining our diluted EPS estimates at $1.31 for 2008 and $1.35 for
2009. Results will likely reflect weaker container utilization amid the growing
recession as roughly one-fourth of the company's equipment base is on
short-term hire (a portion of which might not be released) and lower equipment
gains due to reduced sales, partly offset by the acquisition of Consent
Equipment.

We are continuing our Hold on CAI International, but cutting our target price
to $3.25. CAP pays no common dividend.

Most of their debt is their revolver to finance ongoing operations. The big
question would be, how big a revenue drop could CAP withstand and not default
on the revolver?

(a) Revolving Credit Facility

The Company has a senior secured line of credit agreement with a consortium of
banks to finance the acquisition of assets and for general working capital
purposes. This agreement was amended on May 27, 2008 to increase the maximum
credit availability. As of September 30, 2008, the maximum credit commitment
under the senior secured line of credit was $290.0 million.

The Company’s senior secured credit facility, including any amounts drawn on
the facility, is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company
(excluding CEAB assets) including the containers owned by the Company, the
underlying leases thereon and the Company’s interest in any money received
under such contracts. The facility may be increased under certain conditions
described in the agreement governing the facility. In addition, there is a
commitment fee on the unused amount of the total commitment, payable quarterly
in arrears. The agreement provides that swing line loans (short-term borrowings
of up to $10.0 million in the aggregate that are payable within 10 business
days or at maturity date, whichever comes earlier) and standby letters of
credit (up to $15.0 million in the aggregate) will be available to the Company.
These credit commitments are part of, and not in addition to, the total
commitment provided under the agreement. The interest rates vary depending upon
whether the loans are characterized as Base Rate loans or Eurodollar rate
loans, as defined in the senior secured credit facility. As of September 30,
2008, the interest rate under the amended agreement was approximately 3.7%. The
agreement governing the Company’s senior secured credit facility also contains
various financial and other covenants. It also includes certain restrictions on
the Company’s ability to incur other indebtedness or pay dividends to
stockholders. As of September 30, 2008, the Company was in compliance with the
terms of the senior secured credit facility.

As of September 30, 2008, the outstanding balance under the Company’s senior
secured revolving credit facility was $219.4 million, out of which $104.3
million was allocated to CAI Barbados and $115.1 million to CAI U.S., compared
to an outstanding balance of $147.6 million that was all allocated to CAI U.S.
at December 31, 2007. The portion of this credit facility that was allocated to
Barbados is guaranteed by our international subsidiaries. As of September 30,
2008, the Company had $70.3 million in availability under the senior secured
credit facility (net of $328,000 in letters of credit) subject to our ability
to meet the collateral requirements under the agreement governing the facility.
The entire amount of the facility drawn at any time plus accrued interest and
fees is callable on demand in the event of certain specified events of default.

FRX is a fallen angel, for several reasons.

In the early 00s, consultants would tell the pharma companies that were not
based on the east coast (e.g. ABT, LLY, KG, TAP, Takeda USA, Yamagouchi USA)
that they needed to adopt "a New York state of mind". This was an explicit
reference to FRX and PFE. PFE grew through aggressive acquisitions -
Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia-Upjohn, etc and FRX was seemingly doing everything
right in terms of marketing. Not only did they have Lexapro, which led the
depression market for a while, and Namenda (Alzheimer's), but they marketed to
physicians very aggressively, refusing to sign onto the PhRMA (the leading
industry organization) guidelines for good promotional practices in 2003. So
they were inviting physicians to weekend seminars at Jackson Hole long after
the other major pharma compaqnies abandoned such appearances of conflict of
interest.

FRX has hit a wall recently. Lexapro loses patent exclusivity in 2011, Namenda
possibly as early as 2010. Aclinidium, their prospective therapy for COPD,
hasn't done so well in Phase III trials. Savella is launching right now for
fibromyalgia, but it is third to market after Pfizer's Lyrica and Lilly's
Cymbalta. The in-licensing of dutogliptin ( a DPP-IV inhibitor like Merck's
Januvia for type 2 diabetes) has only raised questions about the NPV of their
pipeline. They may have to acquire a pipeline, too, and unfortunately they will
be competing against the big players for the choicest acquisition targets.

I'm not saying that FRX can't perform well here- if the entire pharm,a sector
took off, it would likely rally in sympathy, but I think there are other
mid-cap pharma companies with better prospects. My own DD has led me to hold
CEPH in the mid-cap space for the time being.

Despite the gloomy forecast I liked the tone of CAT's CC. They actually had a
"recession" plan in place since Y2005 that they are now executing. Revenue
forecast is 40B$ +/-10% and they think they can hit 2.5$ earnings/share if the

Too difficult for me to pin down words like "Armageddon", "next depression".

I guess for "we are on the edge", I'd say who's "we"?

My bank overextended itself and was closed and bought out by another. No change
for me as far as my dealings with the new bank.

I got Bloomberg in the background now and there's that incessant commercial on
for Nutrisystem with spokespeople urging people to sign up (pay up) and they
can lose 30-40 pounds or more too.

While at the same time, tonight I'll be seeing a friend who is a big volunteer
at a church in a downtrodden adjacent town. She reports families now watering
down milk to make it last longer.

No breadlines, but there are volunteer feed stations at several places in towns
around where I live (and in my town). I still see stores toss out food with
outdated, expired numbers. And I see and know people who scrounge for these
either to feed themselves or to recycle to others.

So I guess it depends on where you are class-wise, asset-wise, job-wise,
aquaintance-wise as to whether you believe we're on the edge.

The thing is not so much where we are, but where we are going, and do stocks
reflect that? I say there are lots of value stocks which seem to me to be cheap
on an absolute basis and which seem to me to discount a lot of the problems we
might see in '09.

I2, as I've bought some P&G, Pepsi, etc. recently, I had been reflecting on
some of our previous conversations where you've mentioned you've been a buyer
and holder of some of the country's (USA) best/strongest companies for more
than 20 or 30 years. Maybe since the '60's if I recall correctly.
Perhaps too late for me now - I might not have time left to hold on for 20-30
years like you've done. It seems to me though that the strong companies, with
moats, with a history of increasing dividends, will come through the turmoil
we're seeing now. And that now might be a good time to be buying some, if one
ever wants to own these companies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Florida fund manager Arthur Nadel, whose family reported
him missing two weeks ago, turned himself in for arrest on Tuesday on a
criminal charge of securities fraud, U.S. officials said.

Nadel fled after a partner in his firm told him that following the arrest of
accused swindler Bernard Madoff in December, the funds should hire an
independent accountant to audit the books, an FBI agent said in a court filing.

Nadel, head of Scoop Management overseeing six hedge funds he had valued at
more than $300 million but may have less than $1 million according to
authorities, is expected to make an initial appearance in a federal court in
Tampa, Florida, later on Tuesday.

"Arthur Nadel surrendered in the company of two lawyers to FBI agents in
Tampa," New York FBI spokeswoman Monica McLean said.

Nadel was charged with securities fraud in New York because he traded through a
brokerage in the city. His attorney could not immediately be reached for
comment.

The purported fraud is one of several that authorities have announced across
the United States following the sharp decline in the fortunes of the financial
industry.

The biggest by far is New York investment manager Madoff, who authorities said
confessed to running a Ponzi scheme over many years with losses of $50 billion.
A Ponzi scheme is one in which early investors are paid with the money of new
clients.

A criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan linked Nadel's
decision to flee to the Madoff case.

FBI agent Kevin Riordan said that an unidentified partner of Nadel's "informed
me that, following the arrest of Bernard L. Madoff by the FBI in New York and
the subsequent publicity ... Partner I again told Nadel that (the funds) had to
hire an independent certified public accountant to conduct an audit."

The document said that on January 8 Nadel agreed to the audit but by January 14
he was reported missing by his family after leaving a suicide note "reflecting
that he was no longer going to be around."

Nadel was charged with securities fraud and wire fraud related to his funds
from around 2004 until at least January 14 this year. Investors were located
throughout the United States, the court document said. His assets have been
frozen by court order.

The complaint contains excerpts of a handwritten letter from Nadel, 76, to his
wife. It says the letter was found by Scoop employees in an office shredding
machine.

"The avenues to money for you will likely be blocked soon," the letter quoted
in an affidavit by Riordan said. "You must use the trust (yours) to your
benefit as much and as soon as possible."

The complaint said Nadel of Sarasota, Florida, owned two general partnerships:
Scoop Management and Scoop Capital LLC. An unidentified partner created two
other partnerships called Valhalla Management and Viking Management LLC.

Nadel was the investment adviser for all of the funds under the partnerships
and the only person with authority to trade the money, according to the court
document.

Maybe these geezers (Nadel age 76, Madoff 70) should plead dementia in their

Nadel gets convicted, he might die in jail. What is it with these people - are
they just crooks all their life or just late bloomers?
=========================
I would like to say it's another lesson for investors to not put all their
money into one investment or with one investment advisor. Otoh, there seem to
be so many crooks out there - considering bank/investment ceo's and their
companies and their arrogance - maybe most are crooked - if not all - that the
lesson is not diversify diversify, but rather the lesson is to not deal with
any investment advisor at all.

I read some statistic somewhere that said despite the clear mismanagement of
many banks and financial institutions around 86% of the most senior executives
continue to remain on the payroll earning their lovely salaries and perks. In
my opinion Geithner is part of the problem and i dont see him as being part of
the solution. I dont recall him ever being someone who was concerned about
derivatives, the manner in which mortgage lending was being conducted, leverage
of the investment banks, the conduits, or the lack of regulation. Aside from
being a tax cheat I dont understand what qualifies him to be Secretary of the
Treasury. I am frustrated and disappointed with that important appointment and
pretty amazed that he got confirmed. BWDIK.

My guess is that these older guys got caught and couldnt just admit to their
clients that they were incompetent money managers . They had spent decades
earning peoples respect in the community and tried to hold onto it as long as
they possibly could. its also possible that there's lots more problems that
will surface over the next couple of years as lots of these hedgefunds have
investments in private companies, just like the bdc-s and we dont really know

cannot make a macro call and perhaps you are right to avoid luxury stocks. I
got out of BID at a loss, but their balance sheet is a bit ugly due to
financing operations. HOG is another one of close-to-luxury stocks that also
has an issue with financing arm. Compared to this COH has a pristine balance
sheet and that's a plus. On the other hand, they are still valued at 3xbook,
which is a risk in this environment. Whether they can maintain earnings and
keep their brand cachet during these times, remains to be seen.

Thanks for heads up on SEPR, but it's not very enlightening to claim that "it
was trading just a bit over BV+cash today", since BV already includes the said
cash. :) Yes, it was trading at about 2xBV, where BV includes quite a bit of
goodwill too. And most of its cash is offset by convertible subordinated debt,
so it's not really very cash rich. ;)

It may or may not grow 50% in 2009. It did not do so in 2008. Sales grew less
than 10%, while growth in income is 10x, but that's because of losses in 2007.

I can understand why it might not be your style of investment. It certainly
isn't a value stock in the typical sense of that term (so I'll shut up about it
on this thread after this post).

The company made some mistakes in 2004-5 that resulted in losses in 2004-2006;
most prominent is that they followed the terrible advice from WS analysts and
tried to run the company by the 90s pharma model (which the big pharma
companies are abandoning, but slowly): too much DTC for Lunesta and a big sales
force. They have brought on a new middle and upper-level management team on
their marketing side that is excellent, and whose vision of an efficient
marketing culture is starting to come to fruition. So I hold it as a turnaround

A question: would you hold WYE here for PFE stock or sell it?
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:1/29/2009 4:34:43 PM
From:Oblomov
>>would you hold WYE here for PFE stock or sell it?

It's interesting that PFE (which became the largest US pharma company by buying
Warner-Lambert) would buy WYE (W-L's other suitor prior to the PFE merger in
2000 - remember when it was rumored that P&G would buy both WYE and PFE?). Had
WYE bought W-L, it would have had a half-interest in Lipitor (with PFE), and
might have ended up buying Pfizer...

I'm lukewarm on PFE. The stock could do OK over the next 12-18 months,
especially if the dollar falls a bit, since over half of PFEs sales are outside
of the US. This, even more than rising commodity prices in 2007-8, has been a
significant headwind for the company.

But PFE has probably the greatest risk of any of the major pharma companies to
changes in the US health care system, and the Wyeth acquisition only mitigates
it slightly. Drugs like Lipitor, Zoloft, Bextra, Celebrex, Chantix, Viagra,
Detrol, and Lyrica have succeeded because of primary care marketing (same with
Wyeth's Effexor, Pristiq, and Protonix). Whether or not we agree with the
policies, chances are that there will be more government influence on
reimbursement decisions, especially in Primary Care. Even under single payer
systems, critical care and catastrophic care coverage tend to be quite good,
while primary care prescribing latitude tends to be quite limited and primary
care itself is effectively rationed. This could actually be a boon to companies
with large pipelines in oncology, critical care, and disease states such as MS
and Alzheimer's that require expensive ongoing treatment (i.e., if these
diseases could be managed down by drug therapy to permit patient independence).

A shift toward a less consumer-driven regime could greatly reduce the advantage
conferred by Pfizer's size and marketing resources. Pfizer, of course, knows
this, which is why it is buying Wyeth. Wyeth has an excellent biotech
development platform. But probably even with this acquisition, PFE will not
have the best biotech platform, and it will still be several years behind other
major pharma in acquiring the ability to produce biologic generics (an
attractive growth opportunity for pharma under the current political reality of
a Dem Congress and President).

Look at the acquisitions major pharma has made over the past few years: LLY
buying IMCL, BioMS and AMBI, AZN buying MEDI, SNY buying Acambis, Takeda buying
MLNM, GSK buying ATLN, NVS buying Speedel, and of course Roche trying to buy
the remainder of DNA. With the exception of the last one, the acquisitions are
small to mid capitalization, with a specific development platform. Look at
Amgen's acquisitions: they are obviously very well tied into the Silicon Valley
venture community - all of their acquisitions have been small private firms
with a very specific technology. PFE, on the other hand, seems intent on the
sort of large mergers that have a questionable benefit to shareholders. It
appears that the proximity to Wall Street has infected Pfizer with the
"deal-bug". PFE would be better off buying five mid-size biotechs, and would
not have to take on any debt or cut its divi as it will with the WYE
acquisition.

The upshot is that there are probably better big pharma companies to hold (In
my opinion, ABT, JNJ, BMY and maybe SNY). But PFE could benefit more than other
pharma from USD depreciation, and has probably learned some lessons from its
messy acquisitions of Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia-Upjohn-Searle. It is a solid
company despite the S&P/Moody's ratings cuts, but not a particularly exciting
company. Holding Pfizer here is, in essence, a speculation that the merger will
work out better than expected.

Thanks a lot for your analysis. You write "better big pharma companies to hold
(In my opinion, ABT, JNJ, BMY and maybe SNY)."

I have not looked at BMY and SNY recently and I need to relook at them. With my
valuation methods JNJ is cheaper than ABT. PFE is cheaper than both, but not
much and this may change with WYE incorporated.

How about GSK? Would you think it's comparable to the four you mentioned?

BMY, IMHO, is also not very cheap if you subtract one time gain in 2008.

SNY - I still don't like its low ROE. Or looking from another point of view,
they have low ROE due to ridiculous balance sheet with 70 billion intangibles
and negative tangible assets. Spekulatius I think considers my reservations
about SNY unfounded though. :)

I guess I would choose JNJ from your 4. :)

GSK is in a better position than Pfizer in terms of pipeline. They have an
immediate revenue problem because of the collapse in Avandia sales, and the
precipitous drop of the pound against the USD will compress earnings even more.
The dividend payment is denominated in pounds, so the yield based on historic
dividend levels won't stand. Also, debt levels appear to be high, roughly 50%
of market cap.

The company offset its loss of patent protection for Wellbutrin XL and other
products with four or five launches in 2008. And they have probably the best
pipeline in the industry, with 40-50 compounds in Phase III trials. These will
probably begin to generate impressive growth sometime in 2011, so maybe the
time to look at the company is later this year or early next. I might pick up
some if I can get it in the high 20s.

I agree with your selection of JNJ. I hold it, and some LLY out of the big
pharma.

I hadn't thought about NVO much until EKS mentioned it here recently. I
consider the company to be among the best managed in the industry, perhaps even
the best managed of the big pharma, but had always considered the stock
valuation to be rich. It looks more attractive in terms of valuation than I've
ever seen it. So, I'm looking at it.

I'm curious how you value a stock. Do you use the same method for every
industry, or different methods depending on the industry?

PM (39$), TEL(14.1$), CAT(31.8$) EEQ(31$)-
two little helpings of PM for me. I am re-establishing a position that I sold
at higher prices a while ago. Rinse and repeat.

TEL - business terrible but expectations are realistic. With TEL I think the
revenue decline is partly due to inventory correction so this should reverse
somewhat once the inventory stocks are depleted at their customers even if end
user demand does not improve.

CAT - seems to have a plan how to get through this downturn. if they indeed
manage to earn 2.5$/share in Y2009, the stock is a buy here. Chart looks like
it may have bottomed.

Sold part of my EEQ position. This pipeline stock has done well.

AFLC, PG:

Aflac recovering somewhat from management's error and/or stupidity in exposing
the company to risky hybrid securities. Looks like company will survive - the
positives of having a good business/good franchise. As you point out though,
survive at what profit to the long-term investor?: Eight years of stock market
gains wiped out by management's big bet folly.

PG might get back to the $40 level you mentioned. Who knows in a depression.

Company sells so many consumer staples.
http://www.pg.com/common/product_sitemap.shtml

If management doesn't make acquisition or financial blunders and if generic
substitutes can be contained, I assume company will be able to raise prices
eventually and successfully in an inflationary environment while maintaining
sales in a recessionary/deflationary one.

Hard to see PG stock as a significant grower in next few years. OTOH, I see the
company as safe and its stock buyable for me now. I'm adding today as company
issues an expected not-so-great quarterly report:

Fill for me now on more GTI.

Recapping: This stock's been discussed here for many years. (It was once called
UCAR.) Basically if we're going to have steel from mini-mills, those mills need
and consume graphite rods that are only made by a few companies (an oligopolic
market). GTI is the only USA producer. (So a weaker dollar might mean less or
no price competition for GTI.)

The way I'm seeing it now, there were good times in past year or so for steel,
and that has allowed GTI to prosper and reduce its debt. Now times aren't so
good for steel - and maybe not so good for GTI -- but GTI has only made itself
much stronger (by improving its balance sheet). If that's so, then I've been
terribly wrong by not going all in when GTI fell to $3-5 in November. At
current price, $7.94, I'll continue though to up my position some. My feelings
say I'm too late but my head says it's still a possible double from here within
two years. Maybe.

JST -followed you into that one. It's cheap, probably risky, has a decent
balance sheet and may actually one of those companies that benefits from
infrastructure spending.
I also added some NSRGY (my favorite consumer staple). I also like PG here and
may establish a position. i remember i looked into this stock way back then,
must have been in the late 80's. It was trading at a 12-13 PE then not that
cheap and boring. i bought Prime Computer instead which was what I thought in a
short term funk and in the Minicomputer growth Industry. Well there is
something to be said about investing in a strong company with products that do
not become obsolete.

I don't recall how he Prime Computer play turned out but I didn't rode it to
zero. I think at some point tit did bounce back somewhat and I sold.

PG trades at about the same PE then in the 80's so i think it is cheap here and
I bet it will trade higher twenty years from now.

I guess you wrote this to provoke a reply :-). Here you are - the goodwill
originates from the Sanofi/Hoechst merger that build this company. I do think
this merger allowed the combined entity to be stronger than the individual
companies preceded it, so I would just ignore the goodwill as an accounting
artifact. I don't own SNY or any other pharma at this point but i think SNY
would be on the top of my list based on valuation.

PG. I had checked those long-ago 1980's PG prices too. It was when I bought my
house. Turns out, if I would have bought all P&G at my house price back then,
instead of my house, I would have been 5x better off. (PG going from about
$2.45 to current $54.50). My house appreciating maybe 5x. And additionally, I'd
be getting $1.60 share dividend on each $2.45 cost-basis share now. (Okay maybe
5x better number not quite right because I put 20% down on my house, and so I'd
not be able to buy as many shares as my house cost with margin on stocks being
maybe 50%. Plus, I'd have to pay rent someplace. Still though, PG proved a
better financial investment than my house, it seems to me.)

Who knew that PG would be a great long-term investment? (Well, great by my
standards). Actually, we who were there maybe all knew. Motivated by
inexperience and short-term considerations though, who cared? -- relatively
high p/e, lousy div yield, stodgy non-hip investment. Maybe a good place to
work (if you were in brand management especially), but tech/medical/other stuff
-- that's where the money was to be made in the stock market.

I have the same opinion today regarding PG: A great long-term investment. And I
believe the young guys have the same belief now that I had then -- p/e too
high, good company, not exiting, no ruling reason to buy, there's got to be
better out there for somebody trying to make big money with not-a-big bankroll.

Ltb&h people now may get rich on this stock as the 1980's ltb&h people may have
done. It's a company with moats, so I bet your statement is right: "I bet it
will trade higher twenty years from now." I'm guessing the issue is whether
I'll be around 20 years to see it. -g-

E_K_S -
Barrons is like a broken record. Their picks seem to perform worse than
average.

Prices for the REIT index are down less than 60%, the REIT index changes for
Y2008 was a little less than 40%, i think inline with the SP500.

Nevertheless a 60% decline in the REIT prices implies a 30% decline in asset
value assuming a 50% leverage to begin with, which appears not that unlikely,
given the fact that we started out with record low Cap rates (below 6%) in
Y2007. If we just go to historic averages (8-9%) in cap rates a 30% decline for
commercial RE seems not far fetched. This assumes stable rents of course.

Well SPG just announced that they do pay their dividend 90% in stock. This is
supposed to be one of the better names in the REIT world and tells me that
there a fundamental issues.

I agree with your observations regarding GSK debt. It needs to be taken into
account.

For me, LLY and NVO are still both too expensive to buy. So I will probably get
some JNJ. :)

I use couple valuation methods: ROE/ROIC based extrapolation of earnings to the
future and then calculating rate of return; inverse P/E or earnings yield
adjusted for cash/debt; net-net current assets or net cash. I use the same
methods for all industries. I avoid low margin, high debt, low ROE companies
though. And net-nets are usually a totally separate category, although now
there are some OK ROE companies that are becoming net nets. Hope this helps.

Paul,

There are couple "but"'s to your argument.

PG is now much bigger than it was in 1980's. Therefore it will be much harder
for it to grow both in business and in stock price from where it is now.

IMHO, JNJ, PEP, NKE, MSFT, MMM and perhaps HOG, GLW, GSK, CSCO are better
priced and more attractive than PG. Of course, this is not an argument for you,
but it is for people who choose stocks.

SNY - my favorite metric would be to compare the EV/EBITDA and PE. The
enterprise value which accounts for leverage and cash on the balance sheet.

It looks like SNY has about 4BEuro in net debt, 8B Euro in EBITDA,
5.2Euro/share earnings and a 2.07Euro(shares trade at 44Euro).
