Re: E&P Basket

Here is how some of the INDEXes have performed YTD:

-index/

(Note: My 9% is looking pretty good compared to the equivalent ETF's)

FWIW with the wild swing in commodity prices, my E&P basket is now at it's
lowest level since I started constructing it in Oct 2010. My gain is now only
9% and at one time it was up over 33%. Therefore, it might be time to start
buying more shares of the companies that still have a good story to tell.

The quick gains from the large price spikes higher where I peeled off shares,
now looks like the right move (LEI & SSN). I also have a portion of my shares
where I wrote May 2011 options (GMXR & MHR) which also locked in some good
gains.

Therefore, in managing my basket, selling a few call options 4-6 months ahead
and peeling off shares from time to time on large one day price moves seems to
have help me manage the large volatility swings. A straight Buy & Hold strategy
would have been a bit more painful.

Have you done in depth dd on TEO?

Most of my investments are driven by a more quantitative qualification approach
than case specifics, and on TEO I "like" the story, but it wouldn't even be on
my radar if not for the qualifying metrics. I don't have a huge position, but I
do like the growth they're showing and just general market opportunity. It
gives international diversification which is a part of my portfolio goal. The
dividend is very nice - although in the CC they said they might hold it in the
forthcoming year as some spectrum is coming up for sale and they're wanting to
bid aggressively. the stock didn't react well to that indicating to me that
alot of investors are in the stock for the divy, but in the context of what I
perceive as a longer term growth story I'm really fine with it. They're good
allocators of capital. The market did not respond well to increased talk of
government intervention in managing the pensions earlier this year - so you're
right that's a very real risk - kindof same thing that holds down companies
like PBR that otherwise look great but have the govt intervention thing always
hanging over them. AS far as the currency - I'm not smart enough to figure out
risks on those, but my general thought is many of the developing countries
should have stronger growth than the U.S. and my guess is that there's in
aggregate a better than 50/50 chance that the dollar gets weaker over time vs.
most world currencies. I've made a conscious decision to give a high % of my
assets international exposure because I don't trust the US dollar's ability to
maintain value.

re DO: the drillers have disappointed me. I do believe the world is going t be
energy hungry - and the Japan situation really diminishes nuclear potential
imho. I just can't figure where the right energy play is. I think solar becomes
very competitive in the next 4-5 yrs given expected scale/cost reductions, so
it'll start picking up some of slack, but otherwise I'm not sure. Battery tech
makes sense but none of those companies have crossed my radar recently, maybe
PWER, but I didn't seriously look at it.

on the healthcare stocks - i do feel like I'm in the line of danger on these,
but I guess I'm sortof OK with LHCG as home health should benefit from cost
saving moves and based on my parent's example it's way better than being in a
hospital. MDF is just a tiny small cap but it actually scores #1 on my rankings
of all stocks right now (or it did last time I ran them a few weeks back). I'll
probably take some profits since I recently doubled up on a pullback, but they
just seem very well run and low valuation baked in.

USNA - the MLM angle kept me out too - but I got lured back after I saw Avon's
excellent earnings and I saw that as foreshadowing that this type of stuff
might be doing very well right now. Glad I stayed away though as I think I saw
top leadership just quit - problems over an acquisition and move into China
marketplace.

re CHL- I do think that CHL should not be compared to Chinese RTO. CHL's
positives are that it is listed in HK and pays a decent dividend. It is the
flagship Chinese company in he wireless sector.

Having said that, the government does have a heavy hand into this. They forced
(my interpretation) them to use an inferior Chinese standard for 3G which gave
the competition a leg up, imo. They also have a stake in a Chinese bank:

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26562572&srchtxt=CHL

However the value of the bank stake is fairly small, compared to the EV of CHL.
For me the interesting angle with CHL to have a growing and purely domestic
business with utility like economics that obtains it's revenues in RMB. I
expect to see a 5% annual tailwind on CHL value solely based on slow RMB
appreciation.

Shane,

Overall, I like your portfolio, it is possibly closest in spirit on SI to what
I invest into. ;)

TEO - I was not aware that they are planning to suspend/lower dividend. This
might not go well :/ Also dividend suspension is talked about in other
Argentine companies as government intervention of giving more money to
employees and less to shareholders. This may not be good. :(

I agree that USD is weak and there's a high "chance that the dollar gets weaker
over time vs. most world currencies". However, Argentine peso is one of the
currencies that might be even weaker than USD. They have a long history of
devaluation. :( Of course, the future may look different from the past, but so
far I see no indication of that.

I just can't figure where the right energy play is. - oil E&Ps have been a
great play so far. However, most of them are too expensive now, so it's not as
good as it was a year or two ago. If oil crashes to $60-70, we may have great
bargains again. Alternatively, you could buy supermajors, but they carry a lot
of refining/chemicals/etc. baggage. I have not seen much that I like in solar
or nuclear.

LHCG - even assuming medicare is fine, IMHO it is expensive. So pass for me. ;)

at or near their 52wk highs.

At 16 PE these companies might be considered near a fair value level but their
forward PE's are lower around 13. IMO these are still holds and to me continue
to be undervalued.

In both the Drug stocks & Medical equipment companies we are having a stealth

re GS -
>>The problem with GS is that I am not sure they have enough internal controls
for some trader not to flush the company down the toilet.<<

I agree unfortunately, lot's of fat tail risk with GS.

For me the risk of something really bad for the shareholder to happen could be
estimated like this:

1) Probability that some at GS did something really nefarious. Estimated
probability: 0.75 (75% LOL)

2) Probability that above nefarious thing will be uncovered: 0.5 (50%)

3) Probability that above uncovered nefarious dealing will be prosecuted using
criminal charges (a few Billion $ fine does not count) 0.25 (25%)

So, the risk of self destruction for GS: 0.75x0.5x0.25= 0.094 (9.4%). That is
pretty substantial but probably acceptable. The problem is that once 1) and 2)
are given it takes a long time (year?) for 3 to play out. I assume of it get's
to #2 with a serious outlook for #3, the shareprice would be a whole lot lower.

FWIW, "criminal charges" are a "death sentence" for a financial entity since it
pretty much prohibits many customers from doing business with them. of course I
could be well wrong with above probability, you can do your own guesstimates
and come to your own conclusions, which may differ from mine.

The issue with GS business model, is that it is constantly at the bleeding
legal edge of screwing someone else and I think it is becoming more and more
obvious that what has been tolerated for years or decades may not stand up in
front of regulators or the court any more (see the Galleon trial). So in my
opinion, Wall Streets current business model is essentially broken. Maybe they
should move to China - the downside is that when found guilty, the verdict may
get the bullet and the relatives have pay for it.

AAPL is relatively inexpensive. If I had pistol pointed at my head, I'd go long

growing at current pace, the stock will smash everything. But their past growth
is parabolic and it just can't continue at the same pace. AAPL is a HUGE
company by now and you just can't go x4 on 320B market cap. So assume you get
x2 from here (tremble XOM, who needs oil, when they can get iPad!!! :))) and
even that is far from certain.

AMZN - is ridiculously overpriced. I probably wouldn't buy it even with pistol
pointed at my head. ;) (Well, I would, I am a coward ;)). The risk with Amazon

now, so it could do x4.

I've spent some time studying these companies, and I've decided to shy away
from COCO and APOL. From what I've seen, they have been much more aggressive
than others in engaging in the sharp practices that have led to the intense
scrutiny the sector faces from the Department of Education. The two stocks I
like most in this sector are Devry (DV) and Strayer Education (STRA) (I own
both). Both are beaten down, though DV has had a bit of a run up lately while
STRA is trading near a 52 week low. I also recommend a read of Strayer's 2010
Annual Report, which is available on their web site.

http://www.strayereducation.com/annuals.cfm

Management of this company does a better job than most of explaining their
business and laying out their long term strategy. They also go into great
detail explaining what the new Education Department rules are and the issues
they've faced in trying to understand and adhere to them. It's a good
description from the trenches of what these institutions are up against and is
worthwhile reading if you're interested in the sector, whether or not you're

probably have the transcript still up.

My interpretation was business was good and they were expanding when

The problem with "it's enterprise" explanation is that IMHO "it's the users"
explains much more. ;)

If it's enterprise, why MSFT did not just build the technology into Outlook or
some other enterprise offering? Outlook already has huge penetration in
enterprise. The technology is not rocket science, most of Skype functionality
is already available in Microsoft Live Messenger.

The only gain MSFT gets in enterprise is a brand, which is OK, but terribly
expensive and maybe a bit technology in multi-country Internet to phone system
connection.

On the other hand in private/personal calling, they get brand, which is very
sticky for non-techies - my mother and aunt will never switch from Skype; they
get technology, which may be a bit better than what they have in Messenger
Live; they get 700 mln wide social network of people who may not be on Facebook
(again my mother and my aunt ;)). It's not bad. ;)

What's the vision? Probably four pronged:
- Enterprise Skype - makes sense.
- More social networking in private/personal Skype - games are already there,
but maybe more sharing / walls / pictures, etc.
- Mobile Skype - ??? - as supplement of Win Phone? As an app on Android/iPhone
for Voip calls? (I believe Apple prohibits Voip apps, but I may be wrong).
- Xbox Skype - I am not sure this is a big deal - again why not just Xbox Live
messenger?

I am not a tech visionary though. I may be missing some other huge
opportunities. And obviously execution will matter a lot. If they screw things
up, even my mother may ditch Skype. ;)

I worked within the community college arena during my working years.

Lots of financing came to the colleges via state and county property taxes,
educational dollars from the state treasury (grants, special project funding,
etcetera) and special educational tax assessments. More money came from the
federal government through federal grants and other projects. It would appear
as though the USA (and other western societies) will soon be entering a period
of economic austerity, and any reduction of monies from the county, state or
federal government will surely have an impact on all post secondary education
facilities, whether private sector or public sector.

A double whammy comes in the form of federal and state financial aid programs
for students. With near certainty, these aid programs will have their funding
slashed or even eliminated, separating many potential students from any
opportunity for a college education.

In my opinion, the markets have correctly priced the stocks of the private
schools like Strayer, Apollo Group and Corinthian, taking in all of the current
risk factors. If it were me, I'd take a wait and see attitude until the current
government financial deficits are dealt with.

Upped my PXL.v (Palliser position). I liked the recent presentation and
quarterly report.

With 45.5M shares fd shares and net debt of $8.6M, EV is roughly $88M dollars
with stock at $1.75/sh. Company says its nav is $1.97/sh.

This for a company that says their end of year production will be 1600-1800
boepd (more than 90% heavy oil). Numbers revised downward from previous
1900-2050 boepd. Company maintains its 2011 exit production should be 2,350 to
2,600 boepd.

In researching these small e&p companies, I find few companies like this with
so much potential current oil production for such a low enterprise value. Stock
is a good value imo, assuming that the production actually occurs as management
has outlooked.

Community colleges win hands down for the first 2 years-generally better

more serious attitude about actual learning. Having specified agreements in
place for 4 year schools to transfer credits is a huge plus. Besides it's
possible to learn a trade if one chooses that might actually produce a job with
a middle class income. Welding? HVAC? Plumbing? Machining. Web Design and

I suspect that we would have the same numbers of students enrolled but that the
major impact might be on college administration costs and faculty fees.

Colleges have very few dollars that comprise "discretionary spending". Most of
the money received from various levels of government are earmarked for quite
specific spending purposes and cannot be used for general expenses like
salaries, administrative expenses and other fairly general costs. Likewise
monies received from taxation (usually a property tax or special property tax
levy) carry specific spending limitations. Monies obtained via the sale of
bonds also carry restrictive rules governing spending, and those limitations
are spelled out in the language of the bond referendum itself.

So, you are somewhat correct that if incoming dollars are reduced, one of the
major impacts will be on administrative costs and salaries. There's simply not
many other areas to cut spending. Some courses of studies would be entirely
eliminated (presumably those tracks with lower enrollment numbers) and, of
course, spending on extracurricular activities such as non-revenue generating
sports.

Tuition and fees would likely increase to cover any shortfalls, but the higher
the costs to the students, the greater the likelihood that less wealthy
students would be unable to afford college.

The biggest price headache for colleges is not administrative costs and/or
salaries. It's the cost of technological advancements that directly affect
graduating students. By the time a student graduates from a four year program,
what s/he learned in the first 2 or 3 years is technologically obsolete
already. Colleges cannot graduate students that haven't been exposed to the
latest and greatest in technology, whether it's hardware or software programs.
The costs associated with replacing existing technology nearly every year is
staggering. Even students share in these costs as the laptop or PC that they
use for college courses must be updated to be able to stay current with current
business practices and employment opportunities upon graduation. Education is
no longer simply "put in 4 years and then work seemingly forever". Education is
now an ongoing process and there's just as many if not more returning adult
students to contend with as there are students taking undergraduate courses.

I am trying to ascertain now where the value lies in various colleges. where
does one get the biggest bang for the buck as an undergrad?

Clearly, community colleges are the low cost leader in undergraduate studies.
For the most part, they're extremely cost effective. But community colleges are
effective only for the first 2 years of study, and also effective for returning
adults in a few select courses of study. After that, a 4 year school is the
only realistic choice for most people.

The differences between a public sector school and a private school are
difficult to discern. Generally speaking, public sector schools are less
expensive to the student as more of the overall costs are shouldered by the
taxpayer and the government (also the taxpayer). The quality of education
depends entirely upon the individual schools. Some are better than others, some
shine in certain studies such as business and lag in other areas, say sciences
(or vice versa). All schools have to be accredited by various agencies, and the
standards are the same for the public and private sectors.

Hi Grommit

Yea, PE is high (Forward PE s/b around 19) but so is their growth in revenues
(over 100%!) A lot of those revenues are in regulated industries w/ guaranteed
returns too. The kicker for me are all their water treatment franchises. 50% of
their profits come from their Water business and 50% from their Energy
business. If you look at the PE's for water companies they are typically very
high. On average, the dividend payout for water companies are also not as high
as an electric utility. My one problem in buying pure water plays are that they
are expensive (high PE's)

My thinking is you get the blended package with a falling PE that should
eventually land somewhere around 15 (or even lower depending on where their
revenue growth stabilizes at). The blended company should also provide you a
higher dividend payout. Perhaps as much as 2% higher.

I also like their renewable energy resources, specifically their geothermal &
hydro. With very high oil prices into the future, this division should
contribute a larger incremental profit to the group.

Finally, I am not too sure what their plan is long term in the NG distribution
business and their expansion into the U.S.. Canada has a lot of NG and they
could somehow hook up with a pipeline transporter (like PVX) and use that to
supply their expanding distribution network. Again good growth possibilities.

Lots of possibilities for growth IMO. Their water assets is really what
attracts me to them in the short term. Water is going to be more important that
oil, electricity or NG. This is a good way to buy into that w/o paying the
premium if one was to buy a water only company.

Two reasons:
- Some companies have been accused last year on excessive and possibly

- Medicare is right now one of the prime targets on the budget deficit cuts. At
the very minimum, Medicare reimbursements are likely to be cut. Yes, this is
not very popular, but it's also unclear whether it matters.

These are broad thoughts. I somewhat agree with Paul Senior and Shane that some

reorg. I'm just not confident to say which ones. ;)

 why do you think a stock like STRA trading at ~14X forward earnings in an
industry that is under the gun and depending on public funding is attractive.

First, the downwardly revised forward estimates are lower than CY earnings. Not
a great thing, but unless the whole industry is doomed, it's a short term blip.
I also think those estimates, especially for 2012, are on the low side. That
aside, 14x is not hugely expensive. If you look at Strayer's current size and
the room they have to grow, there is plenty of potential upside. Meanwhile, I'm
collecting a better than 2% dividend that is very secure (~33% payout ratio).

As for the future of the industry:

- There is huge demand for what these companies are offering. The number of
working adults, their target market, that do not have a college degree is
staggering.

- The public institutions that are their competitors, especially the Community
Colleges, are being hit even harder by the cutbacks.

- Public funding is not going to dry up. The education benefits for the
military, in particular, are not going anywhere. STRA is run by ex military
people, and returning military and military spouses are one of their prime
markets.

That said, my value style has management quality as a major component, and I'll
pay up for it. If your strategy is to make a basket play in a beaten down
sector without getting too deep into the individual companies, the answer is
different. COCO and APOL belong in that basket, STRA probably doesn't.

Do you have data on this or are you just speculating?

I am asking because I am not sure how much you are correct. I work in computer
science and pretty much nothing has become obsolete in the last 10 years.
C/C++/Java/Python/Javascript/Perl/Windows/Linux/MacOS/databases/etc. have all
been around for 10 years or more and have not changed much. Sure, there are
some changes, but IMHO the whole cry of technological obsolescence is way
overblown. IMHO a lot of it is pure marketing by schools - pay us moolah and
you'll get the latest and greatest! Other students won't have a chance to
compete! Do you know what MIT or Stanford teach their undergrads in CS? Guess
what - pretty much the same things as 10 years ago! Maybe somebody should tell
them that they won't get jobs after learning "obsolete" stuff at the two most
prestigious CS schools. ;)

Is there an area which is progressing faster than Computer Science so to
require updates every 2 years? Examples?

On the equipment side, I agree that a computer lifetime at college lab is
probably ~3-4 years because it's just not worth fixing after that time. And
software licenses might cost renewal if school does not use free software. But
even Microsoft seems to have lowered their educational prices a lot.
100 computers at $1000 a pop is still only $100K. Multiply by 2 for upkeep,
amortize over 4 years and you're still talking only 50K per year. A BIG lab for

Calvin,

and to piggyback on Jurgis's comments.... and I'm going entirely from memory
here. late in 2010 the govt. produced a report of graduation rates that broke
out graduation by individual campuses for many of the schools you're looking
at. If you can find it it's an eye opener - some campuses having single digit
graduation rates -- and some much much better - even comparable to public
institutions. What was striking to me was even in schools run by the same
company, some campuses seemed much better than others.

another thing: tuition is ridiculous. I thought the for profits would have a
cost advantage, but in most cases it seems students would be better to just
find one of the lower cost state schools and go there. I'm not sure what
dynamic is at work unless alot of the for-profit-school students just need
something closer to home and/or can't get admitted to the state school. credit
costs seemed high to me when I called around to soem local places just to get a
feel for their programs. I was shocked at the cost actually.

1. The availability from our gov't of easy to obtain student loans which has
increased the number of students attending 4 year colleges and allowed colleges
to become flush with cash and in turn undertake expansion efforts, building
programs, etc

2. The college Arms race - look at how colleges are now trying to compete with
each others with massive fitness centers, luxurious student unions, fancy
dorms, etc

3. Increasing overhead costs primarily due to addining administrative personnel
and for a period of time, increasing salary and benefits at a rate faster than
the private sector

speak from experience

Paul re RWE , there is more than nuclear nervousness going on - some of thire
older nuclear reactors have been shut down for the time being, per government
decision. Those reactors were mostly written down already and were huge cash
cows. While the shutdown is a temporary suspension for now, I expect this to
become permanent and this is going to have a real impact on the bottom line.

re RWEOY: Sounds like it could be bad for the company. In the US I believe
utilities are often entitled or permitted by law to earn a specified rate of
return on their investments (book value). I don't know how regulators allow
rates to be set and changed in Germany or other places where RWEOY operates.
I'll presume though that if Germany's old nuclear plants are shut down, that
energy supply will have to be made up elsewhere to meet demand, and that any
investments that RWEOY will make thereto will earn RWEOY an okay return.

Perhaps the stock will drop further if cash flow decreases and dividend is
reduced with that. Longer term RWEOY and stock should be in good shape. Imo.

This does not apply in this case - the electricity generation in Germany is
mostly un-regulated. RWE may be entitled to some compensation (RWE is suing the
government) but that is a long shot. Best case scenario is that rising
electricity prices due to the nuclear capacity being taken out, raise the
profits for their conventional generation. What little political goodwill was

Re: for profit education
The 20% drop of student enrollment in Strayer definitely warrants
investigation. I can somehow understand the big drop of enrollment in
Corinthian or Apollo, since these two have to change their marketing practice
and drop certain student candidates to comply with the new rules. But based on
what I read from Strayer's annual report, its business model should not be
impacted too much. For example, it has never used any bonus or incentive scheme
for its admission staffs, nor has it aggressively market itself in the past.
And federal funding only takes about 78% of its revenue. (Source: Strayer 2010
shareholder annual letter) So, the big drop is a surprise to me.
Strayer's management blames it on bad press. This might be the real cause, or
not at all. I guess I will just have to wait and see the results from next a
couple of quarters. (I assume that management might be able to use bad press as
a reason for one quarterly results, but unlikely to keep using it for
sequential quarterly results)

When analyzing the for-profit education industry, one question I ask myself is
what the industry would look like, if there were no government funding or if it
were operating in a pure market economy environment. Do those players provide
valuable services to the target customers? How much will the target customers
be willing to pay for that service if they have to either pay out of their own
savings or out of loan with a market interest rate?

I think the services, which Corinthian provides such as training for message
therapy,mechanical skills and other vocational trades, have a genuine demand in
the society. In addition, those training programs are kind of difficult to be
replicated online. (This is just my own assumption or speculation.)

However, Corinthian's current business model is clearly not sustainable given
changing regulatory environment and I imagine that the tuition would have to be
a lot lower if the company were operating in a pure market economy environment.
So my questions for Corinthian are:

First will the company successfully adapt to the new environment?
Second, during the adaption process, will the company sail smoothly? (i.e., not
filing bankruptcy during the process first, then reemerge and be successful)
Third, given all the information, how low the stock price should be to afford a
margin of safety for a value investment?

RWEOY - Looking at their Q1/2011 numbers, they got 24% of German electricity
from nuclear (they have zero nuclear in other countries). Since German
electricity sales is ~1/3 of total revenues, they potentially lose 8% of
revenues (it's not clear whether "German electricity sales" is just the
electricity they generated, so perhaps the loss is even lower). Is this such a
big deal? I understand that you claim that the reactors were depreciated, so
these 8% was "free" money, but that's not exactly true. They still had to pay
for upkeep/running them/fuel, etc. And on the other hand don't they benefit
from the reactor closure in their other businesses?

I would be more concerned that they had negative FCF for last two years and
presumably they will have negative FCF again if they decide to replace closed
reactors with anything. :) Though perhaps its similar concern to yours.

Jurgis, are you sure your numbers are correct;
Per Y2010 annual report power generation in Germany generated ~52% of RWE
operating earnings (P. 90). Nuclear power is ~18.5% of RWE's German operating
capacity, so there is an almost 10% hit to RWE operating earnings, which I
think will reduce net earnings by ~20% (fixed cost and debt payment stay the
same, I also think that nuclear power generation profitability exceeds that of
conventional generation).

RWE operating earnings are supposed to fall by ~20% and net earnings by about
30% The earnings projection of about 5.2 Euro/share for Y2012 seems a bit on
the high side. RWE currently trades at ~42Euro/share so the PE is around 8, if
these earnings in fact come through. So, I think that the very real earning hit
is amply reflected in the share price already.

Correct. The 30% earnings reduction for Y2012 are from analyst estimates from
German sources. Besides the problem with the nuclear power generation, other
parts of the wholesale business suffering as well. For example they have NG
contracts with the Russian sources, with the delivery prices indexed to crude.
Since the world is flooding in NG (not just North America), this has turned out
a very bad idea. Same applies to EON.DE.

GFRE- I listened to the Q&A part of the conference call. the questions seemed
better than the answers. I guess the principal sounds like a typical
entrepreuner, he wants to grow the business long term, and doesnt really want
to sacrifice a long term plan for the clearly advantageous alternative use of
the cash to buy back shares. When someone put on him on the spot though and
asked him if they were still dithering about buying back stock or were actually
planning to do so he replied that they intended to buy back stock or they would
not have announced a share buy back. To me that means that there will be some
sort of buy back but most likely more modest than investors like me would hope
for. If any of you are interested in buying gfre shares I strongly suggest you
listen to conference call. Its a bit time consuming but on the recorded one you

Hi Grommit -

I would love to get 8% on the DFTpA but at Par ($25/share) they yield 7.875%. I
need to be able to buy around $24.50/share to capture that 8% yield.

DuPont Fabros Technology, 7.875% Series A Cumul Redeem Perp Preferred Stock
Ticker Symbol: DFT-A CUSIP: 26613Q205 Exchange: NYSE

They also have a Preferred D which yields 7.7% at current prices.

DuPont Fabros Technology, 7.625% Series B Cumul Redeem Perp Preferred Stock

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's on my watch list for an add at $24.50/share or lower. For now, I am buying
the MHRpD 8% which yields 8.16% at current prices. They also make their
distributions monthly rather than quarterly.

These preferrds are much better than my Credit Union yield of 1% or even my
Vanguard GNMA yield of around 4%.

The risk is a bit more as these preferreds have a B-/Ba3 rating (MHR is no
rated) but Free Flow Cash appears to more than cover the interest obligations
for both MHR & DFT.

Shane,

One theory to explain the high tuition price from for profit colleges can be
found in the annual reports of Washington Post which owns Kaplan.

Basically, the theory says that the price hike is partly due to the unintended
consequence of one government funding rule, the 90/10 rule. To save me some
typing, I will just copy and paste the relevant paragraphs from Washington
Post's 2010 annual letter, which does a good job articulating the theory.

"on tuition: the federal government is an inadvertent price-fixer in the
for-profit education field. a simple change would allow price competition among
for-profit colleges. We would cut tuition for some programs if we could do so
without running afoul of government regulations.

How does the federal government fix prices for our tuition?
For sensible reasons, the government long ago decided that for-profit higher
education companies had to get at least 10% of their revenue from sources other
than federal title iV aid, the
so-called 90/10 rule. Fair enough.

But the 90/10 rule has a perverse consequence:each time the federal government
raises the maximum amount granted under pell grants or the maximum federal loan
amount, we end
up compelled to raise tuitions to comply with 90/10. (as a general matter, no
university can limit how much a student can borrow under title iV.)

Does this make a difference?

there’s one for-profit higher education company whose major source of funds is
not title&#160; iV. it’s american public education, the owner of american
Military university (aMu),and most of its funds come from federal funds that
are not subject to the 90% limitation, particularly gi Bills and veterans’
benefits. aMu’s annual tuition for a bachelor’s program is about $7,500. i’m
not saying that Kaplan could or would offer $7,500 per year bachelor’s degrees.
i am saying: experiment with freeing companies from 90/10 on programs where
they offer to reduce tuitions and keep them low in the future. i tell the story
of aMu (we own no stake in it) to make a point: for-profit education and low
tuition are not incompatible; 90/10 and low tuition are incompatible."

Hope this helps.
