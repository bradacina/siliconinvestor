I read the article with interest as I own Aruze which has a big stake in WYNN.
Unfortunately there is little to hang my hat on in the article. To argue that
its undervalued based on cash flow projections in 2009 when the casinos have
not opened yet seems questionable to me. I realize that they have to use some
kind of numbers to come up with cash flow projections in order to do the ipo
and get project financing but at these valuations I would rather real numbers
from an operating fully built casino. According to yahoo mpel has a market cap
of $6Billion, while the market cap for Wynn is $9billion. But Wynn has
operating casinos and a history of innovation and great success in the casino
business. So I dont know why anyone would prefer to purchase MPEL over WYNN.

Here is why I bought MPEL.

The company does have a history of operation in Macau as only one of six
companies having gambling concessions.

I view buying a casino in Macau is akin to buying Vegas in the fifties. Slides
20-25 of the latest WYNN Bear Stearns presentation shows the growth potential
for Macau.

MPEL's will have one hundred percent exposure to the Asian market as its first
casino is planned to open the second quarter of this year. Two more are
currently planned. Wynn has one casino operating and plans for another.

The article states that there are certain advantages that MPEL will have over
American companies. I understand that advantage comes with a risk. But I feel a
"local" operator will have a hometurf advantage to the Sands or Wynn.

From the article: "Discounting back the company's 2009 cash flow, the stock is
trading at a one-year forward EBITDA multiple of 11." Certainly that is a
guesstimate number. But WYNN doesn't look cheap on a enterprise to EBIDTA ratio
either. (Enterprise value for WYNN is 12 B)

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=WYNN

I like the institutional holders that currently own MPEL. Janus Overseas fund
has done well in the past.

Finally, because of its speculative nature, MPEL will have greater volatility.
It fell six percent today vs. two percent for WYNN. Since I will mostly likely
trade some of my shares, I like the volatility factor.

Me too on AHM, bought more at $20.01 today.

Averaged in at $23.91 now.

A little perturbed that we havent seen any significant insider buying.

My fear is that nobody, not insiders, not brokerages, not the government really
knows what the heck is going to happen.

Ive pretty much given up on their 1/25 guidance and expect a dividend cut next
quarter. If they can earn $4 for the year and payout $3.50 or so in dividends,
the stock can still rebound a great deal.

I wont be buying anymore unless some of the big money earning insiders step up
and buy like they mean it.

Curious why you expect a dividend cut here? It would seem that with rates
seemingly going down people will refinance their arms into fixed loans and that
should mean more profits for AHM. Assuming that they can get the financing to
float the loans until they can securitize them. I would not like to see the
company issuing new equity at these levels. But I am far from knowing much
about this inscrutable company.

I guess Im taking a q from the trading action.

Perhaps they will need to increase their reserves or something.

Hopefully they can just reduce the dividend rather than halt it for 6 quarters
or something.

I just fear that AHMs problems, while not as severe as subprime, will become
visible.

Either that or the stock will quickly jump back to $32.

I like that scenario better but it just doesnt seem realistic.

I would expect AHM issues will become noticeable. My read was they hold a large
number of loans that are option arms which are a risky product (imo) as the
mortgage holder doesn't have to pay the full interest due each month.

In terms of refinancing, generally the ones that will need it will have a more
difficult time qualifying due to either a lower fica score or a lower amount of
home equity - so a rate cut may be too little too late here.

I am always on lookout of high (>8%) yielding investments. I already have a
full position in the Canroy's but if there are some other thoughts out there,

Bulk Shipping. I suggest you take a look at THE ECONOMIST magazine March 3-9
edition. Article on page 71 titled "Container Ships - Maxing Out".

Basics -

Rates peaked 3rd qtr 2005. Causing a splurge in new orders and "all to
predictably, these are about to be launched into a cycle turning down".

Freight rates down 8% from a year ago. 4,000 box carrying ship afloat today,
but 1,300 on order. Tonnage up more because these ships are BIG. Half of
existing fleet (tonnage) on order. Historical tonnage on order is 30%. But most
of present fleet is modern, so % should be lower.

And they discuss the largeness of the new ships. Ships used to carry 5,000
containers, new ones carry 11,000. (A train carrying that load would be 44
miles long!)...

Lehman has yet another update on AHM. The report is titled "Liquid Balance
Sheet Limits Risks" and is dated 3/14/2007. They reiterate 1-Overweight. The
following is the Investment Conclusion section :

"Liquid Balance Sheet Limits Risks

Investment Conclusion

Liquidity crises among the subprime lenders have touched off concerns that
other lenders like AHM could experience similar problems. After examining the
issues that are draining liquidity from the subprime sector and examining AHM's
balance sheet, we have concluded AHM is in a much better position to manage
through this challenging operating environment, so we reiterate our
1-Overweight rating.

Summary

?? AHM is now trading below book value and just above tangible book. To justify
a valuation below book, earnings would have to swing to a negative, which seems
unlikely to us given the high credit costs already embedded in our estimates.

?? The drain on subprime liquidity was largely
attributable to a precipitous drop in the value of subprime mortgages that
prompted warehouse margin calls. AHM's prime mortgages are still getting a
strong bid, so as long as those values hold in, margin calls should be minimal.

?? AHM could expand its liquidity provided through warehouse, repo and
commercial paper facilities, if need be, by drawing on FHLB advances.

?? AHM has $9.1B of MBS ($8.1B are AAA) that it could sell, releasing
$400MM-$500MM of capital."

1) AHM has a book value per share of $22.64 and tangible book value per share
of $19.98. To the degree the stock is falling below that
level implies that investors are discounting the value of assets on the balance
sheet by the amount of the discount in the stock, in our
opinion.

2) In order for the assets to be worth less than book value, losses on assets,
or loans, would have to exceed current year earnings and wipe
out current earnings and create a loss equal to $51MM for each dollar of book
value. Currently we estimate earnings at $4.90 per share in‘07, or $295MM in
total dollars. We estimate provision for loss this year of $47MM and total
credit costs of roughly $150MM (inclusive of
repurchase credit costs reflected in our assumption for 25 bps of y-o-y gain on
sale margin contraction), thus, in order for earnings to go to
zero credit costs would have to increase $295MM above our estimate.
3) The "run on the bank" so to speak at the subprime lenders was caused by a
chain of events that resulted in their funding sources going
away. Most notable was the fact that the subprime lenders had no unsecured
financing such as FDIC insured deposits and were reliant on
securitization funding and "warehouse lines of credit" that were backed by
collateral. As the value of subprime loans decreased, the value of
the collateral backing their funding decreased, causing margin calls to
increase the amount of collateral used to keep the warehouse lines in
place. When the companies could not supply more quality collateral, the
subprime companies went into default on their financing
agreements and the warehouse lines were withdrawn. In the case of AHM, its
collateral is higher quality, mostly Alt-A, ARMs and FNM/FRE
conforming fixed rate loans (not subprime by definition). The secondary market
for its loans continues to pay premiums in the 101-102
range relative to par. This pricing is barely profitable net of origination
costs, but it is still netting a gain on sale. At year end 2006, AHM had
liabilities of $17.6 billion and $1.3 billion of equity. Warehouse lines of
credit were $1.3 billion, commercial paper was $1.2 billion, and
CDOs, or collateralized debt obligations were $4.8 billion. As far as we know,
the collateral underlying the warehouse lines and repos
continue to perform well, and thus the liability side of AHM’s balance sheet is
still in stable condition, with no funding problems that we are
aware of.

4) In our opinion, with a 20% dividend yield, the market no longer believes the
dividend is secure. Under REIT rules, the company must
continue to pay out 90 percent of earnings in the part of the company that is
the qualified REIT subsidiary (QRS), and this part of the
business has been generating about 85% of the dividend. In our discussions with
management, and in analyzing the company, we believe
this dividend is secure. For the sake of creating more conservative
expectations, it might add confidence to the market if the company
lowered the dividend contributed by the TRS, or taxable REIT subsidiary just to
build capital, even if management believes it is not
necessary to do so. If this were to happen, the yield would still be in the
mid-teens at the current price. Of course, that is a tough call
because given the apparent current state of fear in the market, a reduction in
the dividend would be likely PERCEIVED negatively at first.
5) Of assets on balance sheet, there are about $8 billion of AAA securities,
which could be sold even in a tough market and free up about
$500 million of capital if so needed.

Hopefully this isnt anything like the Bear Stearns recommendation for New

for example. When a loan becomes nonperforming and a reappraisal is done, I
would expect that LTV typically will take a hit.

Thanks, Grommit. I will get that ECONOMIST article on container ships.

Some of the container companies have fixed-rate contracts that extend several
years. For those companies, that should help protect the dividend and stock
price (for a while).

I've read that the new container ships are big, and that's a difficulty for the
companies placing orders for them with the shipyards. There are only so many
slots available at the few yards that build these big vessels, and the
container companies have to compete for slots with oil tanker companies whose
large ships I've heard are more profitable for the shipyards. That has/will
delay the delivery of the new larger container ships (so an analyst has
reported).

Nevertheless, you may be right about the danger with these companies. EXM
reported last night, and the news is not good: "Greece's Excel Maritime
Carriers Ltd. on Tuesday said fourth-quarter profit plummeted 32 percent as
weaker revenue from cargo shipping met with sharply higher costs.:

Paul, I don't believe that a USA taxpayer who owns an MLP has to file any kind
of K-1 partnership form. Rather, they should receive a K-1 form from their
broker, issued by the company in question, that shows in detail where all the
various dollar amounts should be shown on your tax return. Varying amounts may
go on Schedule B, E, A (sometimes a charitable contribution or other
deduction), or D, and may also be a return of capital, necessitating additional
record-keeping.

Granted, it's a pain in the neck, not only the way the distributions are
allocated, but also, as you say, waiting for the K-1 from your brokers.

(Also, if I recall correctly, one may or may not be able to escape the issue
even if the MLP is held in IRA. There's a limit of $1000 in the amount of
partnership income or gain or something that can be got per year in a 401/IRA.
If more than that amount, there are tax consequences triggered that go outside
the IRA, and the tax forms you mentioned are required.)

About partnership income in an IRA. In googling it, I find there are several
MLP's that have FAQs on their website. Here is what one (BreitBurn EP) says:

"...in general, you can own MLP units in an IRA, pension or profit sharing plan
subject to the following caveat: Only the first $1,000 of net Unrelated
Business Taxable Income, or UBTI, from all sources is excluded from taxation.
In other words, to the extent that the IRA or plan has more than $1,000 in
aggregate UBTI, the excess would be taxable even though the units are held in a
tax-exempt account. There is a reporting obligation if gross UBTI exceeds
$1,000. Virtually all of our income will be UBTI."

Anyone has an opinion on BSX at these prices? Tough nut to crack. On one hand,
it's pretty impossible to trust most metrics, since its balance sheet and
earnings at least are contaminated with all kinds of post-Guidant accounting
adjustments. E.g. huge chunk of assets is goodwill, rendering equity negative
if we write it off. Using Q4 earnings, neither PE, nor ROE is spectacular (even
if we consider ROE a valid metric, where equity is fake). Then there are all
the recalls and investigations and lawsuits and so on.

On the other hand, the whole company now sells for less than it cost for BSX to
acquire Guidant. Presumably JNJ (or whoever) could just buy two companies for
the price they would have paid just for Guidant.

Still undecided though.

Sasol today announced that it had conducted a preliminary study of the Task
Team's report on possible reforms to the fiscal regime applicable to windfall
profits in South Africa's liquid fuel energy sector, with particular reference
to the synthetic fuel industry.

From sasols website- " The Treasury Task Team's 182 page report is wide ranging
and covers many aspects, all of which should be given due consideration. These
range from recommendations for regulatory changes through to a possible tax on
windfall profits and an incentive arrangement for new investment in liquid fuel
production capacity.

"We will respond in detail to the National Treasury," says Sasol GM Bheki
Khumalo.

"Sasol notes that the Task Team's report must still be considered by National
Treasury and the Department of Minerals and Energy. We welcome the invitation
to engage with government," says Khumalo. "We also welcome the definitive
schedule to finalise this matter as this will provide certainty in the tax and
regulatory regime," he says, adding that Sasol looks forward to helping address
South Africa's transportation energy security needs. "

Dont know anything about this company but 182 page report on imposing a
windfall profits tax might be cause for some concern, before taking into
account historical and forward p/e ratios based on existing taxation.

dividend-payers (ELN and LSE:AFN being the only exceptions), and sometimes I
find myself amazed that I've got this position. Like the company, like the
chart, hate the product.

For about 3 years I've refused to buy anything with a BGG engine because Honda
makes a far superior engine. Of all the BGG engines I own (surely a dozen),
only one runs and starts on the first or second pull. And the rope broke on
that one recently. I have at least twice as many Honda engines and they all
start easily and run great. Even things like water pumps which I tend to
neglect until I need them. I've got one down by the lake that hadn't been
started in at least 2 years, put fuel in it the other day, and it lit right up
after a few pulls. Fortunately I always run it until it runs out of fuel, so no
carb gumming issues.

I'm in this one for the long haul because I like the chart, like the dividend
(a little), and like to think that perhaps the beating Honda is giving them is
finally one they won't take laying down.

 If anyone were to buy BSX it would probably be Abbott. It may be the only way
BSX can pay its debt to Abbott. 

Very unlikely. When BSX bought Guidant, ABT bought Guidants device/stent
business (Xience etc.) for a relative bargain price, because Guidant/Bsx had an
antitrust problem. If Abbott were to pursue Bsx now they would have to sell the
successful Xience business to obtain the struggling Bsx Stent business. This
does not make sense to me and hopefully not to ABT management as well.

To buy or not buy HMC? A simple question, not so easy to answer.

After 30 years, I finally discerned an important secret to buying auto stocks.
(Or so I believe. I could be wrong.) The buy decision is very very situational

Ben Stein was on TV this weekend saying the subprimes were oversold and its
overall effect on the economy would be negligible.

----
Another analyst update...

Subprimal Fears Signal a Time to Buy

Jim Ackor is scratching his head.

Ackor is an analyst for RBC Capital Markets, and the cause of his bemusement is
the share price and dividend yield of a conservatively managed company he
follows closely: American Home Mortgage (AHM).

Thanks to the panic over subprime mortgages in the past few weeks, any stock
even associated with the mortgage business has seen its price bludgeoned.

In the case of American Home, the panic's knocked it a third in a month to just
$25.10 at the market close on Friday.

At these levels, the shares have a forecast dividend yield of 18.5%. That's
right: 18.5%. The company is organized as a real estate investment trust, or
REIT, which basically means it pays out all its earnings as dividends.

How vulnerable are those dividends?

Ackor notes that subprime mortgages made up less than 2% of American Home's
business last year. And American Home chose to increase its latest dividend a
week ago, even as the subprime panic was taking hold of the market. "American
Home has been unfairly clumped together with the subprime originators," he
argues, and "the company's decision to declare its 1Q '07 dividend of $1.12
suggests to us that business trends remain largely on track." His worst-case
scenarios only see modest cuts in the dividend.

Best news of all? The insiders haven't been selling the shares. In fact,
Michael Strauss, founder and chief executive, holds 9% of the stock and hasn't
sold any since 2002, according to regulatory data tracked by Interactive Data
Corp.

It's just one case that suggests Wall Street may, in places, have overreacted
to the subprime lending fiasco and other fears that have reared their heads in
the last month.

In the included article there's this:

business last year.

Fine and dandy. Now, pray tell, what part of their profits come from subprime
mortgages? I'd guess more than 2%, but don't have a clue as to how much more.
Any guesses?

I almost bought at $21 (and wish I did), but am not sure about buying at $25.

Ben Stein knows a little about a lot of things- a financial analyst he's not.
As for AHM suggest you read this weeks Barrons carefully. AHM has a lot alt-a
type loans and a lot of arms. their loan reserve is too small relative to the
potential liability. If their is even 10% less demand for housing because of of
more restrictive lending what will be the impact on pricing on starter homes
and the next level up? what is the impact of investors who are stuck with
unflippable condos? homebuilders trying to sell their now spec inventory? I
just have too many questions here to have confidence that AHM will even be able
to pay out a dividend over the next couple of years. If you have enough
confidence maybe the preferred offers better value.

Well, on 1/25 the company provided guidance of $5.40-5.70 per share for 2007
and hinted that they expected to increase the dividend 6 cents each
quarter...$1.12,1.18,1.24 &1.30 for total dividends of $4.84.

Lets say their less than 2% subprime and other Alt-A loans cause them to miss
guidance by 25% both on earnings and dividends.

Thats still $4.05-4.275 per share in EPS and $3.63 in dividends.

Lets further assume that they cant grow that in the future and just come in at
that range for the next 10 years.

Whats the stock worth ?

A helluva lot more than $25 I would think.

However, the lack of really heavy insider buying dampens my enthusiasm
somewhat.

I also dont know the extent of their exotic mortgages like interest only and
teaser rates which are in effect negative amortization loans for a few years.

Those could become problem loans in the future as even though the folks have
good credit, they realize they cant make the note.

Im afraid AHM as well as others felt like rising home values would protect
them. Well, home values have decreased and interest rates have went up. Could
be a double whammy.

I dont know how much exposure AHM really has to loans they have sold.

that 25% is pulled out of thin air. The basic question is out of the $20Billion
of loans sold with recourse, how many will be put back to AHM and how much
money will they lose on these loans? Will they be able to obtain financing to
repurchase these loans or will they have to either issue equity or preffered to
do so?

Houses cheaper than cars in Detroit By Kevin Krolicki
Mon Mar 19, 11:48 AM ET

With bidding stalled on some of the least desirable residences in Detroit's
collapsing housing market, even the fast-talking auctioneer was feeling the
stress.

"Folks, the ground underneath the house goes with it. You do know that, right?"
he offered.

After selling house after house in the Motor City for less than the $29,000 it
costs to buy the average new car, the auctioneer tried a new line: "The lumber
in the house is worth more than that!"

As Detroit reels from job losses in the U.S. auto industry, the depressed city
has emerged as a boomtown in one area: foreclosed property.

It also stands as a case study in the economic pain from a housing bust as
analysts consider whether a developing crisis in mortgages to high-risk
borrowers will trigger a slowdown in the broader U.S. economy.

The rising cost of mortgage financing for Detroit borrowers with weak credit
has added to the downdraft from a slumping local economy to send home values
plunging faster than many investors anticipated a few months ago.

At a weekend sale of about 300 Detroit-area houses by Texas-based auction firm
Hudson & Marshall, the mood was marked more by fear than greed.

"These people are investors and they know the difficulty of finding financing.
They know the difficulty of finding good tenants. They're cautious," said
realtor Stanley Wegrzynowicz, who attended the auction.

HOW LOW IS LOW?

The city, which has lost more than half its population in the past 30 years and
struggled with rising crime, failing schools and other social problems, largely
missed out on the housing boom that swept much of the country in recent years.

Prices have gained less than 2 percent per year in the five years since 2001,
when the auto industry entered a renewed slump.

Steve Izairi, 32, who re-financed his own house in suburban Dearborn and sold
his restaurant to begin buying rental properties in Detroit two years, was
concerned that houses he thought were bargains at $70,000 two years ago were
now selling for just $35,000.

At least 16 Detroit houses up for sale on Sunday sold for $30,000 or less.

A boarded-up bungalow on the city's west side brought $1,300. A four-bedroom
house near the original Motown recording studio sold for $7,000.

"You can't buy a used car for that," said Izairi. "It's a gamble, and you have
to wonder how low it's going to get."

Detroit, where unemployment runs near 14 percent and a third of the population
lives in poverty, leads the nation in new foreclosure filings, according to
tracking service RealtyTrac.

With large swaths of the city now abandoned, banks are reclaiming and reselling
Detroit homes from buyers who can no longer afford payments at seven times the
national rate.

Michigan was the only state to see home prices fall in 2006. The national
average price rose almost 6 percent but prices slipped 0.4 percent here,
according to a federal study.

The state's jobless rate of 7.1 percent in January was also the second highest
in the nation, behind only Mississippi.

HOW MUCH CAN YOU BUY FOR $1 MILLION?

Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was greeted with applause when he announced last week
that two condominiums in the city's revitalizing downtown sold for over $1
million each.

But investors, including some from out of state, proved far more cautious at
Sunday's auction.

In the most spirited bidding of the day, a sprawling, four-bedroom mansion from
Detroit's boom days with an ornate stone entrance fetched just $135,000.

Dave Webb, principal at Hudson & Marshall, said Michigan had become a "heavy
volume" market for his auction firm in recent years, although bigger-money
deals were waiting in California, a market he said was ready for the first such
auctions of repossessed property in years.

"These people that are buying have got to look at holding on for five to seven
years," he said. "The key is holding power."

Even with the steep discounts on Detroit-area properties, some buyers handed
over their deposits with a wince.

"I'm not sure it's congratulations," said Kirk Neal, a 55-year-old auto body
shop worker who bought a ranch in the suburb of Oak Park for $34,000. "My wife
is going to kill me."

Realtor Ron Walraven had a three-bedroom house in the suburb of Bloomfield
Hills that had listed for $525,000 sell for just $130,000 at the auction.

"Once we've seen the last person leave Michigan, then I think we'll be able to
say we've seen the bottom," he said.

Sold my BGG trading shares at 30.60 and my long-term shares at 30.87 this
morning. The LT shares had a gain that was the equivalent of 6 quarters of
dividends and I've seen this one get above 31 not too long ago only to erode
back down to 27+. Not going on that ride again. If I buy it again in the LT
account, it'll be in the 28's. And will try to learn the short-term pattern a
bit better and trade it more frequently in the trading account.

Also got out of F at 7.91 and may stay away although I do still have it in the
IRA.

Not seeing any other compelling trades yet, though FMT is the one I'm watching
most closely. Have it in the LT account and am about the least underwater I've
been on it. There are still two more shoes to drop. Earnings and divi
announcement. They might be good shoes. I'm not quite sure how the math works
that they sold $4B worth of loans and are taking a $140MM charge on the sale.
I'm coming up with 3.5% as the effective amount of damage done to them by
non-performing loans. Other companies have reported as much as 20% of their
sub-primes being in default, but I don't know how much they lose dumping such
homes on the market. Anyway, 3.5% damage to half their business works out to a
1.8% haircut they should've taken. We'll see. They're about 60% down from their
52-week high. I bought when they were down a little over 50%. And even with as
much as they've recovered, the dividend is good if it holds.

Speaking of dividends, WPL. 8.5% and trading about half their 52-week high.
Tanked when execs resigned and hasn't really recovered with the return of their
founder. My bet on this one is that with the quick return of their founder, the
folks who left didn't take as many clients with them as normally would happen.

Two others to mention one or neither of which may not qualify as "Value
Investing" discussion. BME, which I own mostly as a relatively safe
dividend-payer and ELN which has been really volatile in the past but a lot
less so recently. I used to trade it a lot; sometimes multiple times in a day.
Now I can hold a position (long or short) for weeks in it. I think Tysabri
sales are doing better than we know and it's a roll of the dice that AAB-001
(their Alzheimers compound) may get through clinicals successfully. And I think
nanosphere technology is a sleeper that could become a very substantial portion
of their business.

Opinions? Other positions I've got that're only barely worth mentioning are JPM
in my LT account an HMB in my speculation account.

Any other decent dividend payers out there on sale? That's the focus of my LT
account and there's a lot of dry powder in that account that's just earning
3.5% in bonds.

Edit: Regarding FMT, the big unknown to me is how much they typically earn from
their sub-prime business, which is a part of their business they're exiting. I
don't understand this market very well. Whether they're one of the ones who
typically sell loans as soon as they make them or if they keep them and reap
the benefits of the performing ones, which I would think would be very
substantial.

I have a few shares of WPL also, SI Bob.

I'm figuring it for a reversion-to-mean play, and that the dividend, if
sustainable - IF -, provides a little margin of safety.

On the negative side, the market cap to aum (assets under management) percent
is 6.5%, and that is high. (i.e a buyer of the stock pays a high price for
every dollar that WPL manages.) And the latest two analysts calls were
"underperform" and "sell". That's not so reassuring.

I hold a few shares of JPM among a package of financial services stocks and
bank stocks.

I scanned other stocks you mentioned. They hold no interest for me. Jmo, I
could be wrong. And have been many, many times.

I've posted several stocks I'm buying for the dividend growth or yield. There
are some pundits who believe that it can be a very dangerous way to invest if
somebody is chasing dividends. "More money is lost chasing dividends than any
other way". We see that this could be so with the stock declines of high div.
yielding companies in the subprime business.
----------
I'm not sure I'd characterize the div. paying stocks I'm buying as "being on
sale", but to me they are worth buying at prices I'm paying. To me, I'd rather
be buying/holding such stocks now than holding "a lot of dry powder in that

decline. That's just my proclivity though.

BDR looks attractive to me here. Well below book and seems to be turning things
around. Several of the good news you mentioned --- such as a very accretive
buyback and gain on sale of underperforming businesses --- should come out in
10-K earnings coming later this month.

There seems to be a sneaky large seller here (showing small size, but a lot to
sell), which has me a little concerned. As long as he doesn't have insider
information, I'm not as worried. The CEO has been selling stock, but I checked
and he is getting on in age and has been selling stock for years through an
automatic program.

New investors might want to wait until earnings come out. I am taking my
chances with a decent-sized position going into earnings, but I have been wrong

EDV. Okay, it still sells below NAV now. On the one hand the company is unique
because it gets in early in some of investments and helps the managers of these
companies. OTOH, EDV can be viewed as a fund that holds shares of private and
public companies -- and that maybe EDV stock should be evaluated by its
relationship to NAV --- just as typical funds are.

EDV NAV is moving up and so is EDV stock price. Maybe stock price might
fluctuate +- around NAV as some funds do. Maybe the stock price will generally
lag NAV as some funds do.

At at $8.80C share price vs. $10.16 that's about 14% discount to NAV. Not
really a huge discount (undervalue), imo. On the one hand, I don't see the
discount as being unreasonable, given that NAV consists of some privately held
companies, where estimates of value are maybe made by EDV management. OTOH, NAV
has been growing strongly, and so EDV at current discount seems to me to be a
promising valueif NAV growth continues. It appears to me - I'm not sure though
- that EDV has positioned itself heavily in current or potential uranium plays.
So in some sense, EDV seems to be a bet that uranium demand will increase and
uranium prices will remain at or above their very high current prices.

For me, I'm in the stock. However, I don't see EDV as a screaming buy, grossly
undervalued, or very ignored by the market. So my position is small.

Jmo, wrong though I might be.

I dont know what EDV holds at a given point in time. We knew the asset
composition as of 12/31/06.(20% uranium, 20% gold etc.) what it is now is
speculation. we also speculate re the discount as its 25 days or so since
2/28/07. We do know that the company has had a terrific track record in
increasing their NAV, seem to be experts in the space, and its small enough
that there is no reason to believe that they wont grow their NAV at least 20% a
year going forward given the current climate. Most companies that generate ROEs
of 20%+ a year sell at good size premiums to book. Banks which are heavily
leveraged and typically generate roe of 15% or less usually go for at leat 1.5x
book. This company doesnt use leverage, doesnt deal in derivatives, and on top
of that offers inflation protection. So why wouldnt any investor want to own a
piece of it at a discount to book? I expect that sooner or later it will trade
to 1.5 NAV. Until then Ill be happpy to see NAV increase 20% a year and more.
Its over 10% of my portfolio now so Im not adding but no plans to sell any
either. BTW my recollection of how they account for non-public companies that
its either cost or the valuation of the most recent equity financing, unless
there is reason to believe that asset values have been impaired.

Frank Holmes has noted that
given that most investors are not familiar with the mining space, it offers a
vehicle,where an investor can make a mining allocation, get diverse exposure
and not have to become a mining expert, of course you can do the same thing
with RIO and BHP, but the premium to book is much larger.

EDV. At a peak, I'll agree that 1.5 NAV is possible. Peaks are extreme, and
1.5x is an extreme number. Imo.

EDV says they add value by getting in early (private companies), and adding
their (EDV's) management expertise. So that's worth something. Maybe 1.5x NAV.
I'm guessing not that much though. jmo.

For public companies that are held, I presume most - if not all of them - are
selling already at prices over their stated book value.

NAV calculated on selling price of companies in portfolio means to me that 1.5x
NAV is effectively another multiple overlayed on the price/book multiple of the
public companies.

In other words, at 1.5 NAV, a buyer ought to get better value just buying the
underlying companies rather than EDV. Unless the buyer believes the skills and
astuteness of EDV as fund manager and company activist are worth such a premium
to NAV.

For me, my bet disregards the possibility of a premium to NAV. I'm just hoping
either to see NAV gap move to parity (by stock price moving up to NAV), or the
gap percent remaining where it is but the stock price still moving up as it
follows behind the rise in NAV. (I'm hoping EDV can and will continue to
increase NAV.)

let me clarify my understanding as to what edv does. at any given point in time
perhaps 50% or more of their investments are in start up or early stage
companies. they frequently finance them with debt or equity and get warrants
too. Their philosophy has been to demand at least an annual rate of return of
30% on these types of investments. As far as I know they dont take their
proceeds of investments and buy mature stocks with the money. rather they may
have retained some of their original investments such as in NTO, BGO, UUU, SLW,
and the like or perhaps put in a bit more money as they exercised their
warrants. The company recently announced approval to buy back up to 10% of
their stock over the next 12 months. Im not saying they will do that of course
but that would to me certainly be a preferable use of funds, rather than to buy
more stock in nto or slw, where there is no advantage to the investor. As of
12/31/06 about 22% (down from 28.5%) of investments were in warrants.

I certainly agree with you that a closed end fund should not normally sell at a
premium to NAV.

Portfolio adjustments - i reduced my position in VLO. Stock has exceeded my
expectations and trades now close to fair value. I have also ventured into MOT
recently but sold immediately after their miserable earnings. MOT has a long

BUERF. (HOFF) Blue Earth is such a dink, obscure company. I'm just holding it
as a call on the price of cobalt.

Aside: I came across GNCI looking at Lloyd Miller's holdings when I was
reviewing BUERF over the weekend

Aside: In the "oil/gas construction support" arena I have GLBL and GIFI. I've
recently been considering HOFF and have started a position in it today. These
companies are doing well, and I suspect business will remain strong, and that
HOFF might be somewhat undervalued based on its earnings and p/e. I mention
HOFF here because I noticed that Lloyd Miller is a big stockholder of HOFF.

I've no idea who Lloyd Miller is or his investment record. Just that I like a
couple of stocks that's he's a major stockholder of.

I had some Blue Earth from the spin off as well, but didn't really give it a
chance to work out.

On another topic, the OMG deal to sell Nickel business to Norilsk has me
puzzeled. Norilsk states:

As a result of the purchase, Norilsk Nickel has acquired the following assets:

&#183; Harjavalta nickel refining operations in Harjavalta, Finland

&#183; Cawse nickel mining and processing operations in Western Australia

&#183; A 20% stake in MPI Nickel Pty. Ltd. ("MPI"), which operates the Black
Swan and Silver Swan nickel mines in Western Australia, and is developing the
Honeymoon Well project

&#183; An 11.1% holding through common shares and convertible debt in
Talvivaaran Kaivososakeyhtio, a biological heap-leaching project in the Kainuu
Region in Finland.

I am interested in knowing what assets OMG will be retaining, particularly in
countries outside the US and in Africa. I wrote to the Co. and when I get a
response I will post. Seems a whole new strategic direction for OMG. I wonder
about the cobalt refinery in the Congo. OMG posted a loss last Q after
subtracting out the nickel business, and I really wonder exactly what assets
they will retain. Seems that a long term supply agreement was reached on both
cobalt and nickel which is a plus in a tight market. They could be the supplier
of choice for value added products to industry. But why sell a thriving nickel
business, other than to satisfy some debt obligations?

I'll take a few shares of commercial real estate reit, FPO now.

Just to diversify a little. A few shares to start with and to follow.

Div yield okay, not great (for a reit) at about 4.7%.

Positives are: little insider sales; fund investors Davis, Marty Whitman,
Franklin Templeton have positions.
