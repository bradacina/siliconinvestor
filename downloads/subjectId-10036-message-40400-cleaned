re NFLX, shorts
>>The valuation does not make sense. I thought we learned our lesson on
valuation during the late 90s??? <<

Most value investors do not do well with shorts. The problem is that the short
targets are often overvalued Momo stocks. Somehow the thinking of a value
investor is, that if they discovered an overvalued stock, others may do
likewise, generating selling pressure until the stock reaches "fair value". The
problem of course is that those that own or buy the Momo stock dont' buy of for
valuation to begin with , before or after the value investor initiated his
short. Some are growth investors but many buy the story or the chart and don't
understand or care about valuation. An overvalued stock of course then becomes
more overvalued.

Well that is based on my own experience - so I barely short anything any more.
If so inclined, I try my luck with puts, where your risk is capped (those tend
to be very expensive with Momo stocks, since volatility is higher and other
folks have the same idea) so in many situations I don't do anything. In a way,
the price of puts is a good measure of the risk that shorts are taking.

The better deal (IMO) is to short an index (or buy puts an on index) to hedge
long positions against a market decline. When shorting ETF for example, puts
tend to be cheaper, because a large population of stocks tend to have less
volatility than just one single stocks and it's also a better hedge against a
market decline. Also, when the market become really crappy, the stocks tend to
be more correlated and the index more volatile, which makes puts more valuable,
so both a decline and the increased volatility will increase the value of the
puts.

So, I do some of that, but even that very cautiously and in small amounts.
Right now for example is a decent entry points to buy index puts or establish a
short position to hedge against a market decline.

Cwillyg,

I own some NE, DO (and L its majority shareholder), RIG, ATW.

However, I don't think that they are very attractive companies. Even for
deepwater drilling the barrier of entry is not that high and the list of newly
build deepwater platforms is pretty long. IMHO, it's tough to figure out
whether supply will be higher than demand or vice versa. Also, this is very
capital intensive business. Very few companies have consistent positive FCF, in
fact, companies usually bleed cash.

Overall, I would rather hold E&Ps that will benefit from high oil prices than
drillers who trade mostly on rig supply and demand. E&Ps are getting expensive
though, so I have to think whether I want to own more of the second-best
business. :/ At least for now, I don't think deepwater driller prices are very
attractive.

Regarding a choice of driller, I don't have a strong preference. NE levered up
a bit with FDR purchase, but all balance sheets are strong with RIG being
weakest. OTOH, RIG trades at cheapest P/book compared to others - possibly due
to BP spill legal risk. NE is as good as any other. Dale prefers SDRL which
showed good results, but is very expensive compared to any other driller.

Matt,

Everything is absolutely logical. BUT, these people have mind blowing financial
resources, very proud and stubborn. I think they will not allow a crush to
happen, but will soften it as soon as possible and will make another bubble
target: nuclear power plants for example. An then all those 400mil Chinese that
are building houses will be digging the foundations of the power plants. :) As
I said I will be monitoring the BDI index. It is a reflection of the real price

Hello Jurgis,

Thanks for the reasonable thoughts. I agree with you that E&P's are a better
play, but at this point I feel like I have plenty. NE is my only oil services
play as I feel like NE is the cheapest large company in the sector for the
companies not involved in the BP spill.

Good points though. Not sure if I will add. It takes a lot of commitment for a
company to build more than a 5% position for me.

I've hear something along those lines. It might be true if you have a potential
large unrealized capital gain this year. One that someone doesn't feel
comfortable holding or offsetting. I usually don't think about tax planning
till years end. Unless I need to pay estimated taxes.

If your not offsetting losses, and going to take losses only, next year. You
are limited (filing status) to the loss you can take. Carrying forward to the
next year any losses over the limit. Personally, I try and book some gains
earlier in year if possible. So I can take more risk later. Tax wise, if your
not booking long term gains. The best offset of a long term loss, is with a
short term gain. I try and not offset a long term gain (lower tax rate) with a
short term loss. If booking gains you might want to make sure you qualify for
one of the tax rules so you do not owe a estimated tax penalty.

*Returns are adjusted for fees where applicable.</pre>

just how am I supposed to have got better results than what I got?

Paul's return:
1 year: 9.9% (primarily had monies in the High Yield Bond Fund since '08)
3 years: -1.5%
5 years: 6.8%

Vanguard - who emphasizes long-term, must feel five-years is what their
customers believe as long-term, because they don't provide me with an
annualized return for a period longer than 5 years.

Somehow, I guess by some fortunate shuffling by me among the funds, my result
(+6.8%) beats the results of every one of the fund's for five year performance.

Whereas I had believed for diversification and taxes I'd like to eventually
turn the accumulation phase into receiving an annuity (i.e me becoming an
annuitant), I now believe it's crazy to keep on with Vanguard's lousy
performance (and thus, my lousy performance). I'll sell, pay the taxes that
have accrued (and with annuity funds those taxes are ordinary income,not
capital gains), and manage the resulting net cash in a brokerage account (with
stocks and bonds of MY choosing). I'll have a lower dollar amount to work with
(after the taxes are taken out). My bet is that within some reasonable period
of time I can pick stocks/bond funds such that my holdings will climb further
than what I'd have if I stayed with Vangard Annuity Funds.

the table you provided is fascinating. pretty much indicates to me that
pensions are kidding themselves if they think they can do any better than 6%
long term. I think your 6.8% long term performance is pretty good for an
annuity. when i think about the number I need to retire- what would happen if i
could not invest for myself or no longer want to, I use a 6% return and assume
liquidating payments of 30 years. a couple of years ago i think the insurance
company offered me a 5% annuity as part of a settlement. I declined it.

Re: Value in Drug Companies? MRK vs PFE

Pfizer CEO Kindler resigns

From the article:"...After more than four years at the helm, President and CEO
Jeffrey Kindler has resigned from Pfizer Inc., which employs about 500 at
research facilities in the St. Louis area.

The New York-based pharmaceutical giant's (NYSE: PFE) board of directors
elected Ian Read, 57, currently head of the company's global biopharmaceutical
operations, to serve as president and CEO...."

Not too sure if this news is going to help PFE and their drug pipeline issues.
I continue to own PFE but not adding to my shares. I have been selling covered
calls and harvesting earlier tax losses to bring my average cost down to
$19.00/share.

===================================================================

MERCK & CO., INC. (NEW) (NYSE: MRK )

With a 4.4% dividend and 9 PE, I like MRK as a possible add if the price is
right (ie below $30.00/share).

I have owned MRK off and on with my latest purchases in Q4 2008 and Q2 2009. My
average cost is now at $28.50/share. This is my 2nd largest drug stock
position. PFE is my largest. PFE & MRK combined represent 4.5% of the total
portfolio(s) value.

Not only do the analysts have problems forecasting the success of new drugs,
many times the companies themselves have trouble knowing if they are going to
have a hit or not.

Could this be MRK's next big block buster drug?

Many of these I own and now in their latest release LINE is on their list (up
23% from my initial buy in 09/2010 and now trading at an all time high!). The
air is getting pretty thin at these levels, I am tempted to peel off a few
shares on their list as the valuations are high and there is too much
"positive" discussion on all of these MLP's.

I am still bullish on NG. It may have finally broken out of it's consolidated
multi year price range of $4.00/mcf (today's price hit $4.50/mcf). As the deep
water drilling bans continue (looks like several years),E&P money is flowing
into land based drilling. As a result, many of the MLP's will benefit from the
cash flow generated from their pipeline services due to the increased volume
processed (so that to me sounds bullish for the sector).

Your PWE add amid all this activity in the sector is probably a better bet than
upping my MLP holds. I am also looking at possible adds to Williams Companies,

Hi Madharry -

Congratulation on your silver trade (s). Silver hits a new all time high (not
if you count the 80's & the Hunt Brother's trade to $150/oz) with Silver
testing $30.00/oz. I believe Gold also traded at an all time high too at
$1,423.00/oz.

I continue to hold my few gold mining stocks as they are in the portfolio to
provide a hedge against run away inflation. I do have quite a few gold coins
but plan to continue to hold those too. It's much easier to buy & sell the
stocks than it is with the coins.

I should be happy but the run higher in all the commodities signals further
debasing of the $US dollar and possible much higher inflation in the future.

I am not quite sure what the best exit strategy is for my basket of
commodities? Do I really want U.S.$'s or do you buy hard assets like real

Have you thought about what your exit strategy is?

anyone would have an opinion on why HPQ would be an attractive buy.

Also note, he has less MSFT than HPQ even though MSFT is half the price and

Pharm is generally a sector that I tend to stay cautious in.

A company can live and die by patents in this field and unless they have a
substantial part of their sales in something else like JNJ where they have a
lot of sales in Consumer Health(btw. JNJ is at an okay entry price, by no means
value but not expensive too!).

I haven't read into Merck but by looking at their financial statements, Merck
has a billion more in shares outstanding and sold a lot of their Treasury Stock
as well.

Doing a quick google search, I noticed they paid $49.6 billion for rival
Schering-Plough which is probably a good deal considering their is a lot of
praise for the deal.

thank you. i have been very fortunate. as far exit strategy i can only say that
my hope for 2010 was that silver would hit $20 and that slw would reach a
similar price.
ever since I have been just holding on to what i feel is a run away horse. when
my position in slw got really huge and slw was approaching 30 i decide it would
be stupid for me not to hedge some of my position especially since i also had a
large position in axu and the combined position was more than 20% of the entire
portfolio. so i hedged a little over 1/3 of my slw position by selling 30, and
31 calls with an expiry of 12/15. when silver went up more i sold some 37 calls
and when it later dropped i bought back my 30s at a loss and some of my 31s.
now i am 1/3 hedged on the slw position.
if slw drops sharply i will probably repurchase the 37s at a loss, if not i
will be reducing my position to a more normal percentage and paying some taxes
on the long term gains. I believe that this is one of those situations where i
ve screwed up in the past, when i ve purchased undervalued situation and sold
as it approached fair value only to see the shares move up several fold.

I will be holding on for the ride for now. My guess would be that when interest
rates start to move up sharply the ride will be over certainly when long bond
rates hit 6% I will be curtailing commodity positions drastically. but thats
just a guess for now.

the other thing that is missing, is the report from Deloitte & Touche, which
they appointed to look at the internal controls. the latter was announced in
Sept. 10. So far, there is no announcement regarding the results.

Both the stock buyback and hiring a respectable accounting firm to look at
internal controls (not an audit of the balance sheet, mind you) were the reason
for the bounce from the 6$ range. Since they apparently do not follow through
with any of this, I can understand why somebody has the urge to sell.

Hi Grommit -

Re: AGL Resources Inc. (AGL) & Nicor Inc. (GAS)

AGL Resources to Buy Nicor for $2.4 Billion
http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2010/12/07/agl-resources-to-buy-nic
r-for-24-billion/?mod=yahoobarrons

From the article:"...AGL Resources (AGL), the owner of Atlanta’s natural-gas
utility, announced it would buy Nicor (GAS) for $2.4 billion in cash and stock,
almost doubling its gas customer base..."

==========================================================

I looked at GAS when researching NG utility stocks and passed because of their
higher PE (16 next year) and somewhat lower dividend yield (4.1%). I was
attracted to their business as they had one of the largest NG storage and
distribution systems in the US. Their NG storage facilities include 8
underground storage fields w/ the largest storage capacity in the industry.
This should be a good fit with AGL.

Note: GAS also owns a hidden asset subsidiary (a container shipping company
that services Florida & the Bahamas), that will probably be sold or spun off to
share holders. I figured it was worth $3-$4 per shares if sold.

The Oppourtunity

A lot of the domestic NG begins to come on line from the different recently
developed U.S. shale fields (ie. Marcellus, Williston Basin, Bakken, Eagle
Ford, and Niobrar). This new production is going to "squeeze out" much of the
current Canadian NG. An AGL and GAS combination should benefit from this
development.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AGL,GAS,TRP&d=s

Now I am thinking of selling my TransCanada Corp. (TRP) holdings and buying
moreAGL Resources (AGL). The PE for a combined AGL & Nicor s/b less than TRP
(12 vs 16) and the dividend yield s/b a bit higher (4.7% vs 4%). The future
prospects looks better to me for the new AGL than for TRP.

Therefore, I am going to close out my TRP position and increase my AGL holding
by 60%.

I am also going to take the additional proceeds and buy Provident Energy Trust
(PVX). This Canadian Trust yields over 9% and provides NG midstream services
into markets in central Canada and the eastern United States. (
http://www.providentenergy.com/files/factsheet/PVE-Q3-2010-Fact%20Sheet.pdf ).
I am betting that their Midstream infrastructure build out will benefit from
the increased NG production in the U.S. and also take advantage of the TRP
"squeeze out" volume distributed w/i Canada. My previous buy in PVX was in
10/2007 at $10.80/share.

The new AGL and PVX should out perform TRP. The net dividend yield is much
higher too. PVX distributions made monthly (9.1%); AGL quarterly - 4.7% (Feb,
May, August & Nov). Both TRP and PVX has a 15% Canadian foreign tax withheld
from all distributions made.

The blended yield for the new AGL & PVX shares s/b around 6.5% vs a TRP
investment yield of 4.1%.

CBST: I like it for its drug Cubicin which fights MRSA, a germ that can be very
dangerous because it's resistant to most other bacteria-fighting drugs. MRSA
turns out to be ubiquitous, and there are many reported cases of it infecting
hospital patients, and causing serious damage to them.

On the one side, CBST is a one-trick pony... they're trying to expand, but CBST
is likely to be their $1B+ drug (making CBST one of Fortune's Top 100 Fastest
Growing Firms). Cubicin has treated over 1M patients. Although the drug's
patent expires in 2016, Teva Pharma has filed a legal challenge, and that's yet
to be resolved. Also, some competing drugs are making their way through the
pipeline.
Convertible debt was issued in October. The company is projecting total
cash/cash eqiv/long-term investments to be $890M by Dec., with ltd at $559M. So
the company does have money to make acquisitions, do deals, etc.

In total then from what I can discern, (others may have a more perceptive
view), this stock is iffy as to where it might go, and I'd not be a buyer at
current price unless I felt more comfortable with the company's prospects. Or I
was willing to chance a ride on the pony for just a few shares.

Hi Bordeauxman - The key is to buy value when everybody is selling. The company
has been quite successful with their other properties developing working wells
that are now generating revenues for the company.

http://www.gastar.com/globaloperations.cfm

From their Web site:"...Gastar has significant strategic acreage in some of the
most successful and richest gas production areas in the United States,
including the Deep Bossier Sands/Knowles Limestone play in East Texas, the
developing Marcellus Shale play in Appalachia and Wyoming's Powder River Basin.
Gastar recently completed the sale of its assets in the Gunnedah Basin of
southeastern Australia....".

There was a small set back in losing a court judgment which cost them $24
million to settle but with the current stock sale, the proceeds cover this and
the additional monies needed to pay off their new Marcellus Shale property
leases.

Here is the way I look at it. The value is in the ground and I expect oil &
natural gas to maintain their value even as the $US debases it's currency. The
assets are located inside the U.S. and not subject to other political
influence.

Management has a pretty good track record to develop working wells too.

I have been using a strategy of hedging my small position by selling covered
calls on a portion of my shares on prices above $5.00/share. This (mentally)
helps me protect the downside and since my buys are small (compared to my total
portfolio), I feel comfortable buying more shares at the current level. It's
possible the current sell off may take this stock below $4.00/share, where I
will probably add to my current position(s) (11/17 $4.17.share & 12/08
$4.06/share; sold 25% March $5.00 Calls at $0.85/share).

I think in 3-5 years, this is a $15.00/share stock. Even more important, I now
own hard assets "in the ground" with this company that complements my other
natural resource stocks, gold & silver coins and other hard assets that hold
their intrinsic value.

Long term, I am much more concerned about the value of the U.S. dollar and just
what my purchasing power will be. $100 dollars for a loaf of bread or 1 share
of GST?

Meanwhile, AZZEF is down from my purchase price with no adverse news that I

AVNR just got their drug approved and are lining up a roll-out. I'm slightly
down on some shares I bought a month ago, but now I feel like there are some
value risk/reward characteristics including:

1) The Current price is $3.8 which is below a share offering in November of
$4.4 which followed the drug approval.

2) The projected sales of the drug seem to make this a value if they can
achieve some success.

What I really like though from a risk/reward perspective is I bought some more
shares today at 3.76 and wrote March $4 Calls at 0.50. That's a good return in
3 months if shares stay here or go up a bit, and good defensive positioning if

Maybe we are over reacting. Maybe you are right. But according to my logic if

interest rates. This will put brakes on construction. I don't know how badly
they will stop building, but as far as I understand they have built pretty
enough. They will use a lot less iron, tiles :) and everything that goes in
construction. They may start building something else (power plants, etc) but we

The reason for the expected 1/4 point rate hike in China is inflation that is

don't see a crash in the near term and therefore continue to hold GFRE and HRBN

undervalued. I hope my target prices hit before the "debt hangover" does or I
can read the tea leaves and get out beforehand. I have little doubt another big
US and probably world economic crisis is coming, but not in the next 1/2 year
at least. I will never ever continue buying into a downturn like I did in
2008-2009... portfolio down 5 or so percent and it's asta la vista to
everything except cash and short-term investment grade bonds.

Good luck,

Hi cwillyg -

Re: Avanir Pharmaceuticals (AVNR)

I am the wrong person to ask on this company since I can not really value the
company or it's new drugs. To me it's a lottery ticket.

My only successful pharma/development play was with VVUS. I bought this one in
the $2.00/range some years back and eventually sold it around $7.00/share. I
had many round trip rides w/ this company as each new clinical trial was going
to be their next big block buster drug. I think I owned it through three
different drug clinical trials.

The only reason I bought the company was that it was the only one I ever found
that generated enough income to pay for it's clinical trials w/o issuing too
many new shares. In fact, I think in the five years I owned it, they only
issued new shares twice which only represented a total dilution of no more than
15%.

AVNR has a book value of $0.34/share so the assets they do own are intangible.
Their employees provide the company's intellectual capital and they can leave
any time. It looks as though they are burning cash at about 5x as fast as it is
coming in.

They appear to have enough cash on hand to finance 18 months of day-to-day
operations. If they are not able to license a JV partner based on successful
clinical trials, they will be required to issue more shares. They already have
94 million shares outstanding and may have trouble selling more shares in the
future.

Looking at the March 2011 call activity, lot's of open interest is at the $6
strike price and even more OI on the June $7.00 calls.

The only way I would play this one would be to purchase covered calls. Sorry,
but this one does not provide me any "Value Proposition". The company may do
extremely well in the future but I would pass on it. Generally new drug
development is a money pit black hole to me and I have no confidence in valuing
any new drug proposition.

EKS

P.S. The small E&P companies that I sell covered calls on from time to time
actually own hard assets (ie raw land & producing oil/NG wells). The value of
the common stock increases in value as new wells are developed and booked as a
proven reserve. The main factors that go into valuing these companies are (1)
the market price for Oil & NG, (2) the cost of well development and (3) the
price paid for land and permitting. Then it is just the time it takes to bring
a well to production. You also must be lucky to hit a drill zone that actually
produces enough flow to bring the well to production. I can estimate the cost
of all of these factors for an E&P company much easier than for a BioTech
company developing a new drug.

TPCS looks interesting and cheap'ish at first glance

There are number of issues by looking just at latest 10Q (I did not look at 10K
yet!)
- Preferred shares are not really well accounted for. If you use fully diluted
shares, the market cap goes up by 1/3 to about $25M.
- "Costs incurred on uncompleted contracts, in excess of progress billings" on
balance sheet 4M - do you know what that is and why it went up from March 2010?
- Operating cash flows about 30% lower than earnings. To be fair, last year OCF
was much worse.
- Company organized through reverse merger. This is yellow flag in Chinese
stocks an orange flag in American stocks (American stocks have more
opportunities to list than Chinese, so reverse mergers are very dinky).
- Related party transactions in 10Q sound like self dealing or worse.
- Option grants to CEO are pretty high - 7% of non-diluted, 5% or diluted share
count!
- 2 customers are 70% of sales. They lose one and stock goes down 50%.
- "Although we provide manufacturing services for large governmental programs,
we usually do not work directly for agencies of the United States government.
Rather, we perform our services for large governmental contractors and large
utility companies. However, our business is dependent in part on the
continuation of governmental programs which require the services we provide." -
how sure are they that these government programs will continue?

On the positive side, if the new CEO gets on the growth path with Chinese
production and customers there + gets to uplist company, the return could be
great. Keep us posted on your thoughts.

Thanks for great synopsis on CBST. You're right, the risks are that they are
one trick pony and that they lose to Teva earlier than expected. The pipeline
looks somewhat weak at a glance, but I am no specialist.

Pharmas are tough for me. I don't understand the pipelines. They had great
times decade or two ago, but now it seems the business is hard, lots of
investment in R&D and not many blockbuster drugs. You'd think doctors like
Ipsofacto and Mike Burry would have much better insight into this, but I
haven't seen much of that. There was a guy - Oblomov - who posted here some
time ago and had some deeper insights, but even his picks did not do very great

That said, I still hold AMGN, ASRG, DGX, GXDX, MDT, JNJ, GILD, LTUS. Only AMGN

TechPrecision Corporation Receives Purchase Order to Produce Advanced Nuclear
Reactor Equipment
Six-Month, $420,000 Project Demonstrates Importance of 'N'-Stamp Quality
Certification
On Wednesday December 8, 2010, 8:00 am EST

WESTMINSTER, Mass., Dec. 8, 2010 /PRNewswire/ -- TechPrecision Corporation (OTC

Here is some feedback on your comments:

>>> Preferred shares are not really well accounted for. If you use fully
diluted shares, the market cap goes up by 1/3 to about $25M.</>

I agree that you need to factor in the fully diluted share count when
determining your valuation. However, I think your terminology is a bit off
("not really well accounted for.") as the accounting is proper.

>>>>"Costs incurred on uncompleted contracts, in excess of progress billings"
on balance sheet 4M - do you know what that is and why it went up from March
2010?

Here is the explanation of this from the 10-K. If you still have questions,
please ask. "Revenue and costs are recognized on the units of delivery method.
This method recognizes as revenue the contract price of units of the product
delivered during each period and the costs allocable to the delivered units as
the cost of earned revenue. When the sales agreements provide for separate
billing of engineering services, the revenues for those services are recognized
when the services are completed. Costs allocable to undelivered units are
reported in the balance sheet as costs incurred on uncompleted contracts.
Amounts in excess of agreed upon contract price for customer directed changes,
constructive changes, customer delays or other causes of additional contract
costs are recognized in contract value if it is probable that a claim for such
amounts will result in additional revenue and the amounts can be reasonably
estimated. Revisions in cost and profit estimates are reflected in the period
in which the facts requiring the revision become known and are estimable. The
unit of delivery method requires the existence of a contract to provide the
persuasive evidence of an arrangement and determinable seller’s price, delivery
of the product and reasonable collection prospects. The Company has written
agreements with the customers that specify contract prices and delivery terms.
The Company recognizes revenues only when the collection prospects are
reasonably assured."

>>>>Operating cash flows about 30% lower than earnings. To be fair, last year
OCF was much worse.

Your comments are correct. However, the differences between income and OCF have
varied over the past few years both positively and negatively. The differences
to a certain extent are related to revenue recognition (see comment above). If
you compare the cumulative net income and OCF since the beginning of fiscal
2009 they are almost identical. So, this smooths out over time but the
timeframe is longer than with most companies.

>>>>Company organized through reverse merger. This is yellow flag in Chinese
stocks an orange flag in American stocks (American stocks have more
opportunities to list than Chinese, so reverse mergers are very dinky).

Most small companies these days organize through a reverse merger. That doesn't
bother me at all. However, I don't touch Chinese companies.

>>>>Related party transactions in 10Q sound like self dealing or worse.

This transaction happened in 2006 and is not a concern for me. It is prior to
the current management.

>>>>Option grants to CEO are pretty high - 7% of non-diluted, 5% or diluted
share count!

I agree that the option grant to the CEO was high. However, he brings
significant experience in the solar industry and that seems to be bringing
significant traction in solar. I think he is taking the company to the next
level. I don't mind 5% dilution if his skills grow the company massively. If
not, then I agree but I think he has already showed that he has added a lot of
value.

>>>>2 customers are 70% of sales. They lose one and stock goes down 50%. 

I agree that customer concentration is an issue. They are making steps to
broaden their customer base but it will take time to reduce the concentration.
In the mean time, it is important to watch their customers closely. I'm less
concerned by loss of a customer than I am about the change in business
condition for their customers (especially SOLR).

>>>>"Although we provide manufacturing services for large governmental
programs, we usually do not work directly for agencies of the United States
government. Rather, we perform our services for large governmental contractors
and large utility companies. However, our business is dependent in part on the
continuation of governmental programs which require the services we provide." -
how sure are they that these government programs will continue?

I'm not sure what this text is talking about. I'm not aware of governmental
programs that they are working on indirectly. Maybe this is legacy text
relating to past business. I'd have to dig in further to understand this.

Canaccord Genuity maintains a 'Buy' on Gastar Exploration Limited (NYSE: GST),
PT $4.25.

Canaccord analyst says, "We are maintaining our rating and lowering our target
price based on Gastar’s recent equity offering and associated Marcellus
leasehold acquisition. We continue to like the company’s torque to the
Marcellus trend and believe Gastar is an attractively priced Marcellus producer
given its relative growth potential and liquidity. With the funding overhang
now removed, we believe the company is well positioned to outperform in H1/11
based on its initial Marcellus and Eagle Ford test wells. Gastar expects to
have an interest in at least eight Marcellus wells by mid-2011."

December 8, 2010 2:21 PM EST

MKM Partners upgraded Gastar Exploration Limited (NYSE: GST) to Buy.

===============================================================

Hard to say what the intrinsic value of GST is but a secondary sale at
$4.00/share was way too low IMO. Hopefully these will be long term holders.

Based on the analysts estimates prior to the announcement of the secondary and
then adjusted for the stock dilution, the fair value price target s/b
$4.40/share - $5.00/share.

After the secondary, several other analysts have come out and rated GST a BUY
(at current levels) and have raised their longer term price targets too. MKM
Partners even has a new price target of $6.00/share.

I suspect this is an 18 month-24 month hold . Remember, Gastar just bought
north of 50,000 acres at $1,000 an acre or less in the Marcellus shale region.
Earlier in the year, they sold similar acreage for $4,000/acre to their JV
partner after they obtained the necessary drilling permits and completed the
development to begin exploratory wells.

I will look at selling some covered calls early next year as the stock trades
above $5.00/share. Probably some of the September 2011 calls when they are
listed at the end of this month. A lot depends on new company announcements in
the next six months.

For now, this one is a good long term hold for me.

Thanks for your points. AVNR just did a secondary so they have some cash to
move forward, but your point is the same. It's more of a speculation on the
company's future sales. I also wouldn't buy the company on its own, but I'm
attacted by the covered calls which to me gives me a decent risk/reward.

Overall, I think I just thought I'd throw one of these plays out here on this
thread, but I think going forward they're more appropriate on the calls/puts
for income thread.

Thanks for the feedback, and I'd still like to hear about new covered call
plays you make on more value stocks. And if I feel like I'm writing calls on a
stock that is a value play, I'll bring up my strategy again.

For example, I bought SD (ng/oil company) at 5.17 and I'd love to write a
covered call @7 in March or June if I can get a decent price. Haven't pulled
the trigger yet.

Here is a letter I sent to MasterCard investor relations. I encourage all other
MasterCard, Visa, PayPal and Amazon shareholders to contact the respective
companies regarding their suppression of free speech via closure of Wikileaks
accounts. If anyone willing to raise these issues at the shareholder meetings,
that would be great too.

---------------------------
As a MasterCard shareholder, I am deeply concerned about the steps MasterCard
took to prevent people from donating to Wikileaks using MasterCard products. It
seems that MasterCard management took unilateral decision of questionable
legality that does not serve the MasterCard users or shareholders. Instead of
supporting the will of the people to donate to organization fighting for
freedom of speech, the management decided to bow to the political pressure of
unknown actors and censor the will of their clients. This is unacceptable and
the decision should be reversed immediately.

At the same time MasterCard spends no time or effort to prevent payment to
clearly illegal organizations such as Ku Klux Klan. This double standard shows
obviously that the decision to close Wikileaks account was not based on any
rules or regulations, but on impulsive management decision that MasterCard
clients, employees and shareholders will come to regret. It is not too late to
turn around, reopen Wikileaks accounts and apologize to people affected by this
MasterCard decision.

I propose that MasterCard management and Board of Directors review what went
wrong in this decision, reverse it and ensure that there will be no future
decisions that stop MasterCard users expressing their free will by sending
payments to legal political and media organizations worldwide. If the decision
is not made now, I expect that it will be raised at MasterCard shareholder
meeting with all the publicity that will entail.
