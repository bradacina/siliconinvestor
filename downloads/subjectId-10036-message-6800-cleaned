I used Market Guide's for a long time, but was frustrated by the inaccuracies
in their data sets (such as computing market cap off only the A shares when B
shares exist). Lots of false net nets. Still, it has customizable variables
(though limited primary variables with which to create them). And you can
dowload the data set on your own schedule (pay as you go).

CompuStat. Eegad. It's not worth it. There's a limitation to screeing anyway
(see my disclaimer on the screening session of my web page).

Value Line has always appealed because that's what Buffett claims to use, and
you aren't necessarily limited. They have a more expensive, expanded package as
well. I've come very close to using it.

But my favorite is MSN Investor's Investment Finder screener. Easy, cheap (for
me it's free, and I'm not sure what they charge for investor these days but I
think it's like less than 10/month).
And most of all the data is usually pretty accurate. I find the limitation in
the tool is that it is a bit imprecise. It does allow ranking.
Good investing,
Mike

1) perhaps end of ira/401 funding internet fund buys
2) general movement of feeling that the U.S. is overvalued, and the tech's are
the most overvalued of all.
3) even runners on "speed" must run out of breath sometime

Jim: nice pick on LKI. I've been watching it for 4 months -- keep forgetting to
buy when it gets under 7. Should have set my buy point a little higher.

Others I've been looking at lately - not buying though - prices are getting
away - include VANS (in addition to their shoes, they have a business opening
up very successful skate board parks); PPG (very strong dividend yield, stock
buyback) - hit a low within past couple of weeks at 48, now 10+ at 58. Also, in
the same vein (chemical stocks) missed SHLM (16+ up from low 13)and GRO (10 up
from 8) I'm very upset that I didn't start a small position in the Hilton
gaming spinoff (PPE) which I thought about for a long time. Stock is up 50% to
about 9 1/2. I also forgot to buy BEAV at 12 (now 18).

Perhaps I am spending entirely too much time writing that the market has plenty
of values-- and spending too little time buying stocks myself -gg-.

New positions I'm looking to start somewhere around this level are: Allstate
(ALL) if it'll drop a tad closer to its low, RPM if it will drop a little
lower. (A lot of the chemical stocks seem to be doing VERY well the last couple
of days). I'm also watching FA (Fairchild), a company that looks very good on
Yahoo, but about which I seem to be unsure when I dig further.

SLOT is being sued by another gaming co. as you know, and I missed the chance
to average down at 42 this week when the news came out.

And of course -g-, no list of mine would be complete unless I had yet another
stock to buy which differs from one of your picks: If MBI drops a bit more, I
will add to my position. (My cost basis is about 57-58---- I'll add more scale
down..)

Paul,

I saw your post mentioning interest in ALL.

This is entirely my personal opinion, but I'd hold off for a while on
purchasing ALL. I wouldn't have said this a month ago, but outlook has gotten
tougher IMO.

I get the feeling that the first quarter top line growth is going to
dissappoint, and we're seeing competition intensifying from all sides. There's
no room for price increases, and several players seem willing to run higher
combined ratios right now. State Farm seems to be phasing in an all out effort
to defend marketshare, and Progressive is making inroads in most of the state's
I am familiar with. AIG is taking an aggressive posture also. Insurance
departments in general are becoming more combative from what I can tell
following several years of strong profits by insurers.

I hope Allstate announces a direct operation before it's too late, and I think
the new CEO (Ed Liddy) understands this must be done if growth is to be
achieved. The old distribution channel aint what it used to be and ALL isn't
positioned well in the areas that are rapidly growing (like direct writers).

FWIW, I'm aware of several of the new projects the company is implementing and
I get a sense of increasing frustration from home office. All the old tricks
don't seem to be generating growth like they used too, and I don't think
they've yet come to terms with that.

I am long ALL, but am cautious.

Thread, I would like to again state my opinionated 3+ rule for stocks which
people post here. Which is: if a person posts here on a stock- and a 2nd and
3rd person each confirm that he/she did buy the stock at that time (or soon
after it was mentioned by the first poster), that stock is worth a very, very
close look by other investors.

I tracked such posts - there weren't that many- in '97 and part of '98. They
ALL were profitable as I recall. Further, it was the only consistent thing I
could correlate between poster, recommendation, and profitable investment.

I suspect there's some correlation between the purchases of two people on the
thread (Mssrs. Burry and Clarke). That doesn't seem to matter though. If any
three people buy, that stock should get very strong attention from the rest.

My explanation for this is that we are all different in the way we approach
investing and what and when we will actually commit money. When 3 people --
each with a different value perspective,commit funds to a particular stock, I
think that that stock may be undervalued on a number of different aspects -
each of which, or any of which, might be a catalyst to eventually surface the
underlying value.

I seem to have missed this opportunity myself with AG, CSE, and NH (I don't
like ag. stocks- and that is solely MY problem!!)

We may be seeing a couple of stocks now though where there are 3 or more Value
Thread buyers establishing positions.

I'm sorry if I turned you off of PPE with my remarks on the spin-off thread.
I've keep looking at it - market leader, good reputation for management,
diversified portfolio of properties. I still come back to the facts as I see
them - it is highly leveraged, Indian gaming in California is expanding (Prop.
something or other was passed), lots of more places opening in Vegas, and more
competition appearing in other "good" locations. This stock still isn't really
attractive to me, because I don't feel comfortable with the balance sheet and
the outlook.

After watching the death stocks for some years (e.g. LWN and SRV) with their
seemingly "reliable cash flow" for servicing debt faultering, I've been
thinking about Buffet's low debt to equity rule (i.e. < 0.4 if I recall
correctly). Still seems like a good general rule to live by, even in those
"stable cash flow"-type situations.

On VAR, there was an intelligent post on YAHOO basically saying that real
progress is starting to be made on cancer which may well moderate demand for
the therapies provided by VAR products over the next several years. The minute
people see that starting to happen, it will be tough to sell new equipment.

It makes sense that SOMEDAY that will happen. Therefore to some extent
VAR should be priced like an oil well -- at a P/E sufficient to provide
return of most of capital plus an investment return over some finite period of
time.

I will probably pass unless I see a very low price, which will likely not

Re: VAR

Since the published numbers in the databases mean nothing, I compiled
my own based on pro forma numbers for VAR and recent reports by
several cos identified as being in the same industry/competitors by
VAR's investment bank. I'll post them here to support what I said
about being willing to buy VAR at a little cheaper prices.

VAR ADAC BCR OXE SLMD
P/B 3.8 1.9 4.8 3.1 0.9
P/S 0.96 0.84 2.8 1.8 0.56
ROE 28% 12% 20% 15% 3%
LTD/E 0.36 0 0.28 0 0.40
P/E 13.7 16.6 24 21.5 36
%NM 7% 5% 12% 9% 1.6%
CR 1.4 1.6 1.6 3.4 2.8
Yld 0 0 1.5% 0 0

VAR is Varian Medical. ADAC is ADAC Labs. BCR is CR Bard. OXE is OEC
Medical. SLMD is Spacelab Medical.

CR Bard is the big one, with the multi-billion market cap and standard
big-company numbers. Well managed with all the right ratios. Just
wish it was a little cheaper.

OEC Medical is a turnaround of sorts, and is growing more than VAR.
There's a lot to recommend this stock, but it remains a small player
with more risk than CR Bard. It would have to be cheaper.

Varian is just cheap. World-class tech, and without a lot of direct
compeition in its oncology division. Management is a question mark,
and they don't seem very incentivized to me. 25% of VAR's sales are
in the imaging area - they sell x-ray tubes to most of the world's big
suppliers of x-ray and CT equipment. The funny thing is that all of
these suppliers have their own in-house x-ray tube production. And
they still buy from Varian. In fact, 1/2 of all mammography machines
and 1/4 of all CAT scanners contain Varian tubes! This is both a
threat and a commendation. I view these sales as stable with mild
growth potential.

The oncology group is what's growing, and there's a
software/information technology component to it. The model is akin to
IBM's software for its mainframes. There is an opportunity for
further service revenue via software updates.

For having a ratio analysis that's as good as it is, VAR seems to
trade at a discount to its peers. And it earns a very decent ROE
given its industry. That ROE is probably protected to a degree thanks
to market position/the Varian brand.

Where's the margin of safety? VAR is only growing its top line around
7%, and the results are lumpy. The wild card is the ability to cut
costs and revamp operations now that VAR is free on its own. I see
this as a limited opportunity. Cap ex will remain around 2.5% of
sales, and the opportunity for margin expansion by cutting is probably
capped somewhere below 10%. The real growth will have to keep coming
form the oncology division.

Threats are mainly financial in nature, with reimbursement and a
shrinking health care pie the big issues. This is the reason for the
slump throughout the health care sector.

Still, I'm looking at putting together a mini-portfolio of biotech,
medical device, and care companies as these cos continue to get
cheaper, and VAR would be a nice core holding. I haven't bought
anything yet.

And if one is worried about antiangiogenesis drugs curing cancer, buy
a tiny dollop of ENMD to pair to a full position in VAR. If this
hypothesis is even halfway correct, the ENMD profits will more than
make up for any loss in VAR.

Good investing,

Mike, ADAC produces three things. 80% Nuclear Medicine equipment, 15 %
Radiation Therapy Planning systems, and 5% Hospital information system (not
oncology specific). The only products that they compete with Varian on are RTP
systems, and ADAC is the market leader with their Pinnacle product. We have
one. CMS, a private company is second, with Varian struggling with the rest of
competitors for third. But, Varian just entered this arena two years ago,
whereas the others have been there for the long haul. Where Varian has plenty
of room to grow is where hospitals building new therapy centers are installing
all new equipment and Varian offers the "whole package" allowing the hospital
to only have to deal with one vendor for all equipment (Linear Accelerator,
Simulator, RTP system, Radiation Oncology specific information system, HDR
afterloader for brachytherapy).

As for the others, OEC is no where near competing, Spacelab is a partner of
Varian on their Brainlab stereotactic product, I am not sure what products CR
Bard produces.

On the issue of x-ray tubes, remember that I have been told that Varian has a
patent on new solid state cooling devices for x-ray tubes that eliminates the
need for oil in the tube which is in a vacuum and when it cracks can cause
tremendous damage to other parts of the machine. Thus, they may increase their
x-ray tube penetration higher than 25%.

Of course I would have to defer to Doctor Mike, but I am inclined to disagree
with you. In my opinion, we perceive of cancer as a "completely different
disease" (for different body systems) because we do not understand enough about
it to have discovered the similarities. When we have discovered them, we will
be on the way to more effective treatments.

The way I look at it is sort of like where we were with infections treatable
with penicillin BEFORE penicillin was discovered.

On VAR, to what extent do these tubes eventually crack causing that damage to
which you refer. If is usual, I would think they could increase market share
materially. In other words, does the advance address a major problem?

There are similarities, but, different cancers arise from different celluar
structures. What might turn on a mutation in a epithelial cell will not be the
same catalyst for a glandualar cell. Each of these cells react differently to
different types of treatment. Cancers such as kidney, liver, and melanoma
respond poorly to radiation, whereas, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and basal
cell skin cancers respond greatly.

I guess what I'm trying to say is there will be no magic bullet such as
penicillin with cancer. As I'm sure you know, we are now running out of
antibiotics to treat many infectious diseases due to their ability to adapt and
evolve to such drugs as penicillin.

Tubes crack due to high heat generated in the tube. When x-rays are produced
they are only 2% of the product. The other 98% is heat. Often a machine's use
is limited while waiting on cooling of the tube. Sometimes technologists don't
wait and overheat the tube thereby damaging it. I will investigate this issue

Thanks "Two Bear". It would be interesting to find out what kind of increase in
market share for vacuum tubes the company might be expecting. A really
important technology advance could find people replacing all tubes now to avoid
the problems you describe. A minor advance could lead to a 5 point increase in
market share.

Furthermore, we would need to know what percent of the business selling tubes
represents with what kind of (higher than normal?) margins, to get a handle on
the additional earnings potential. If it is a few pennies, who cares? Potential
of a quarter would be something different.

Jeffrey Bash - OT: cancer - The unusual thing about the antiangiogenesis
strategy is that it is not a "cure" but rather a way to box the disease. It's
built on the physics of the situation relating to the distance that an oxygen
molecule can travel via diffusion in a biological matrix. It turns out that a
cancer can only grow to be ~1mm in size without a dedicated blood vessel. (A
basic element of the healing process is to grow new blood vessels to bring
oxygen where needed - be it an infection, a wound or surgical incision, etc.)
Unless the cancer is located in a strategic place, a 1mm space occupying lesion
will cause little or no problem. (Curiously there is still some argument in the
literature about how a cancer causes death/ it probably works via starvation,
but that's another story.) To get big, cancers need to develop their own blood
vessel conduit. With something that abrogates angiogenesis, blood vessels don't
form. However, since this process is of central importance to the organism, you
also won't heal wounds, cure infections, grow muscle, etc, etc. The sexy part
of this story has been the lure of curing cancer. The productive part of the
story has been the understanding of wound biology. For the first time surgeons
can understand why their trade works. And vascular surgeons could be threatened
by pills. How you invest in it, go to medical school I guess.

Jeffrey: re SLMD depressed earnings. With this company, it seems that every
year in the past few there has been something - foreign exchange, in-process
R&D write-offs, asset write-offs. They have big and tough competitors in their
patient monitoring and clinical info. systems businesses. The long sales cycles
dealing with hospitals also are a factor.

Order backlog is up 50% to $67M in 1998 though. There's been a stock repurchase
plan also. The ceo claims in the latest annual report, that they are "making
steady progress" and they "have the plans in place to continue to move forward"
--- A Buffett type annual report this is not -g-.

Stock, imo, is suitable as a small investment for value investors within the
context of a well-diversified portfolio. Larger (or perhaps no position -g-) of
course for someone who really knows what's what- has intimate knowledge of

Mike, based on the Mike Burry "Barron's Effect" phenomenon, I am selling a
chunk of Chicago Title (CTZ) today (Monday am). (I HOPE I can buy it back
LOWER- I hope that's part of the effect -g-). FWIW, I placing some of the
proceeds into Federal Signal(FSS).

FSS:

I often see this stock show up on value screens. I've always passed on it.
Dull, mundane- fire trucks, warning lights, etc-- but profitable (-g-) company,
I never could understand why some pundits would recommend it.

I finally succumbed to the song sung by Bob Perkins of Berger Small
Cap fund, interviewed in Morningstar 2/12/99. "(They are) largely a
non-cyclical business, because it's dependent on municipalities keeping their
fleets current. If you look at the long-term record, you'd think it was Coke,
because it had grown very, very consistently at 12-15%. This year was the
exception...But (the) problem is going away and we're getting paid 3% while we
wait... "We're paying 12 times what we think is secular growth at 12-15%."

The stock is up 3-4 points or so from its low (what industrial stock hasn't
been bumped up in the past week?). Looks to me that roughly, stock has traded
in a 20-25 range since about '96. If stock market's past week's performance
continues, FSS has a chance for an upside breakout. Guess I'd just rather be in
now, than wait to see if the stock retraces to its low. (Getting sucked into
the euphoria-- uh oh -g-)

Dividends, sales increasing every year since '93 (don't know of an internet
source that goes back earlier); psr and p/bv look at low range of past few
years.

A little late perhaps, but I am taking a position today on HLR.

Hollinger is about 16, up from its lows of 11 and close to its 12 mo. high of
18. Yahoo shows a pe of 9 and a div. yield of 3.5%

My history of it, shows a co. with rapidly rising sales, but stalled out in
'98. ROE in mid 20's up from about 6. At the cost maybe of taking on a bunch
more debt,1.4B. Div. is increasing, as is apparently earnings. Price to sales
near its high.

Twister, I believe, has posted that these newspaper companies trade on cash
flow or EBITDA or some other measure (I don't recall)- and that that, (again if
I recall correctly)is the standard way for a business person to evaluate these
newspaper businesses.

So the numbers and ratios I am posting may not be meaningful.

What seems important to me is the margin of safety (div and pe) as this company
goes about doing some odd (IMO) things. They sold off a bunch of community
newspapers (I thought that was supposed to be like a Buffett moat), and they
SEEM to be directing their efforts to the internet. The kicker to enhance value
might be the interent companies in which they may have stakes (refer to the HLR
SI thread, quotes from Merrill Lynch analyst). If the internet interest/mania
continues (and in the last couple of days it looks stopped-dead-in-its tracks),
the stock offers some opportunity to reward investors.

I say there's a margin of safety with HLR and while waiting, you get a
management team that is trying to bring out the value they have in their
business(es). Reluctantly but expectantly, I'm stepping up and buying.

Heads up, textiles -- PTX

Anyone follow pillowtex?

They recently got nailed when they lowered announced EPS for the next 2
quarters tt .40 and .50 -- the analysts were at .59 and .54 projected. (Prior
year was .39 and .42)
http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/990322/tx_pillowt_1.html

Notes from analyst interview after the announcement (2 pages - click to the
next)-- it is very favorable --
http://messages.yahoo.com/bbs?action=m&board=7078730&tid=ptx&mid=230&sid=707873

However the stock is still quite the bargain. Selected textiles are up recently
on good outlook. Although I do not follow the others too closely -- SMI just
beat estimates and MHK just upgraded today.

http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=wpsn+ptx+mhk+shx+smi+bur+ufi&d=0b

There was a Wall St Journal feature 4-12 on textiles. They separated generic
textile and home fashion textilers. Said generic textiles outlook is weak due
to foreign competition (and those who make denim should be having extra
difficulty). BUR, Cone Mills, Galey and Lords, Uniffi they mention in this
category.

Home fashion, however was very strong, says the Journal. They have vary little
labor as compared to apparel, and are therefore not subject to foreign
competition. They mention WPSN and PTX in this category. Both WPSN and PTX have
recently been spending $$$ tons on capital equip for expansion and cost
reduction.

More on PTX --
I have heard analysts mention and I have read that management of PTX is top
notch. I like PTX better than WPSN. You gotta like a 7 PE stock that is growing
solidly. I think the analysts went too far in the lowering of estimated and
have a call into CFO to discuss.

Congrats on the AMZN short...I nearly reshorted on the recent runup but
chickened due to: Concern that entry into auction Biz might continue to stir
animal spirits in followers, Concern that a split announcement [I know nothing
of one coming, but high price might justify it] could cause a beeeg jump, and
Concern that they might use cheap currency to buy an infrastructure element
with real value...like Ingram Micro. None of the above should be construed by
anyone as implication that Amzn is anywhere near fair value, just that I don't
want to be standing under it when someone lights the auxiliary rockets.
Instead of AMZN, I shorted S&P E-mini futures a few days ago and covered at the
close yesterday for about a 36 point gain after having it go against me for
about the same amount. The reasoning is that the S&P is quite overvalued, but
is less subject to the animal spirits of the net stocks. One of the issues Jim
cited for selling his positions was possibility of sell off due to nifty fifty
falling out of bed. The S&P short position covers this issue without abandoning
the carefully selected value stocks. Of course there's still basis risk with
this hedge...to the extent the S&P outperforms the value stuff, you lose.
Interesting that this didn't happen this time. SPY on the amex is an
alternative to futures with equal liquidity and the ability [I believe] to
short on a downtick. It can be used in smaller chunks [the E-mini is 65k per
contract at $50 a point] at 130 per share. The future, offers a tax advantage
if your right in that it's 60% Long term even if holding period is intraday.
Before I get hate mail from some board participants about all this having
little to do with value investing per se, let me say that a mix of shorting
activity that lessens exposure to overVALUED market allows one to maintain
value positions within portfolio risk tolerance.

Mike & all, how low would Eli Lilly (LLY) have to go before being considered a
"value"? Of course, LLY lost a lot of ground after its Prozac sales were off 4%
from same qtr last year, primarily due to advance buying from Q498 as vendors
stocked up in anticipation of a price increase. As excess inventories are
worked down this should IMO prove a fleeting temporary phenomenon.

Using existing earnings est's of $2.35 and $2.69 for Y/E Dec 99 & 2000
respectively, LLY is trading at 31x 1999 fwd earnings and 27x year 2000 fwd
earnings. Although 10-13x seems the "magic" number for "value" oppty's here,
LLY hasn't traded at a multiple of 31x forward earnings since late March 1998,
when it did so for a _very_ brief period (calculation: 1.91 actual FY 98
earnings * 31 PE = ~$59.33...see chart:)
http://www.stocksite.com/magic/research/?symbol=LLY&button=2&type=108w

I don't believe the dip in Prozac sales are indicative of a trend and the
annuity it provides (monopoly I believe thru 2003) commands a higher multiple.
What IS holding me back is that their recent earnings release predicted next
qtr results are expected to reflect "some" additional working down of excess
inventories as well. Thoughts welcome.

I would say the pharms are great companies. But they have all, LLY included,
deviated upward out of their historical valuation range. This has happened
especially over the last few years. So that LLY is back to March 98 valuations
is not attractive to me. I've become only mildly interested on the recent
pullbacks in several of them. They'd have to get back down a lot more for me to
start buying.

Re: AMZN, AAPL, my port

Thanks. It's up again. Maybe I'll get a chance to short it a third time.

Today I messed around with my portfolio.

I'm out of Brazil. After liquidating 1/2 positions in Unibanco and Telesp
Cellular a few points ago, I got out entirely today. Hopefully they'll get
acutely undervalued again.

Also sold half my Mattel, half my Callaway and the remaining half of my Finish
Line after their recent jumps. And I got out of Noble Drilling. I like all
these but seems to me that they've all jumped for no good fundamental reason
other than returning to near-fair valuation after steep undervaluation. This
was my reasoning for getting out of Tricon Global, so watch these rocket ;0

And I'm out of BHP. Old Broken Hill was supposed to be a 50% gainer in two
years, not three months. I'll take it.

What did I buy? Apple (AAPL).

First off, think about the market cap: 5.88 billion. For Apple. This is a
company that I think has gotten its ducks in a row, and once it fights through
all the resistance in the 30's and 40's can spring ever higher. One of those
stocks we'll look back on and say, "I could've had it at 15X earnings, 6X
operating cash flow." For value investors the interesting thing is the
$11.36/share in cash net of debt. This means the enterprise itself is trading
at just about 4X operating cash flow. The company is a cash machine of late,
and is carrying virtually no inventory. This is a company that seems to me to
have really righted itself. But the current investors are too concerned with
every little $1 fluctuation to let it go higher. And the value investors are
too scared away by the technology and/or hating to buy a stock that's doubled
in the last few years. The enterprise is well under sales, and the company is
under 3X book despite ROE IMO sustainable in the 20-30% range.

Still with about 23% cash to spend myself.

I actually reinvested quite a bit of my cash today.

I bought more MO, more Robert Half, more Borders, more Apple. With most of
these I was cash-constrained when I initiated the positions, so I was just
waiting for the cash to become available to take a more substantial position.
After reviewing my watch list, and my holdings, these four stood out as being
definitely better than a new pick.

I also bought two new ones. All of these are long-term holdings in my view. IMO
I've converted some of my deep value "pop" money into some quality companies
with good long-term records.

The first is American Power Conversion (APCC). Trading at historical lows on
ratio analysis basis. Seems to have a good amount of brand equity in the power
field, which I can imagine will only grow. There's been some new competition
which has knocked down their ultra-high returns a bit. But a little
investigation with some tech-savvy friends say this is boring, but essential to
just about any large enterprise. Well, it may fall a bit, and it's not a deep
value, but it's not a used cigar butt either.

The other is HRPT Properties Trust (HRP). I've already got a luxury hotel reit
(LHO), a warehouse reit (EGP), and I wanted another subsector of REITs that had
been killed. HRP seems well-managed in a time of turmoil for health care REITs.
A decent yield, with a relatively low D/E.

Still got a little cash to spend. My intent is to spend it.

I am in absolutely no position to know what's going on inside the company. When

Wayne,

A tidbit today stated that this CEO was hired to lead them onto the internet.
Given the recent strategy switch, which I feel is positive, maybe this CEO just
wasn't the right fit anymore.

Re: Waldenbooks, I like the way Borders looks now from a fundamental
analysis/numbers standpoint. Qualitatively I hate Waldenbooks. But if a
business that is turning in great numbers and has ugly parts to it still, well,
all the better. If this was as good as Borders could get, I might not be so
interested.

BTW, Robert Half had a 2 million share dump at the open that dumped it eleven
points. Then it trended lower, then rallied at the end pretty significantly to
close above its open. I was lucky to buy near the low today, and my cost basis
is now 26 and change (my initial buy was 29 15/16). My first blow-up of the
year, and it doesn't hurt so bad.

I never looked at this one.

I currently have an idea brewing that I think will be appealing to most of the

I'm consolidating my portfolio some, in that maybe I became overdiversified

Re CPU - From the IBM report today - IBM also said it will continue to explore
direct sales over the Internet to businesses and consumers. Maine said that IBM
expects to sell $10 billion to $15 billion in hardware, services and software
directly over the Internet in 1999, compared to
$3.3 billion in 1998.

It still concerns me that they have the business model that will suffer the

Jeffrey,

CPU falls into the MWY category for me. I have no idea what catalyst will shoot
them up. All the available news is bad and the stock gets crushed and insiders
buy.

All I can say is that there will be a nationwide physical chain of computer
superstores with an internet presence. And it appears the stock is being valued
as if its bricks and mortar are a liability rather than an asset.

All the news was bad on Brazil, all the news was bad on the shoe retailers, all
the news was bad on the oil companies, and yet they still rallied for some
reason. And there wasn't nearly this much
insider buying.

Then again, Midway just sits there like a bump and falls
every so often.

Yeah, CNA owns 10% of Global Crossing, which was on their books for $1 billion
as of the last quarter, but will be marked up to $2 billion as of March 31.
Plus they own a large piece of London real estate property Canary Wharf that
was on the books for $25 million but will be marked up to $500 million on March
31. CNA trades well below book value AS OF DECEMBER 31. The math is not hard.
The only question is is CNA a crappy enough operation, and is the insurance
market bad enough that even that will not move the stock?

I guess my beef with Loews is that yes, it is an asset play, but
it is so well-known. I love asset plays, but this one everyone
knows that it trades at a big discount and that it has all these
assets. Barron's publicizes it. Forbes publicizes it. And everyone
just says, yeah, it's way undervalued. And no one buys.

I called Loews to get some answers when I was trying to figure
out the asset side of the equation a few months ago. Most people
at Loews don't even know what they're sitting on, other than that
it's a lot and its undervalued. And no one buys.

So there's no catalyst. And I figure it's because, well, how are these returns
going to trickle down to shareholders. If Tisch isn't going to liquidate, spin
off or sell its assets, then the bet is he'll die and someone else will in a
reasonable time. If not, well, the present value to me of all those assets
might be very small.

If management recognizes that the company is being perpetually undervalued by
the stock market, then it has a fiduciary responsibility IMO to start
liquidating. If the world thinks Lorillard is such a liability, well then sell
it for $6 billion and show the world it's not.

I figure at $120 I'd be buying a conservative dollar for a dollar. If it hits
$55-60, I'll buy in again, get my dollar for 50 cents and wait.

Jim, on CPU, why do you say hold for at least 6 months? Are you saying it might
be dead money for that long (and therefore should not be considered for new
money)? What is something good that might happen -
some Internet spinoff IPO type of thing? I am considering buying it,
but have a somewhat negative bias, particularly since the price paid for the
Computer City purchase probably means that the $90 million good will is
worthless and mgmt is of questionable quality?

Mike, I disagree on CPU future:

But some of that depends on our definition of how long the future is. Two years
or ten?

I looked closely at CPU in early 98. Price about 33. PVing my projected
earnings, I valued it at 17. When it fell below 17, I took another look,
thinking I could now get in at a discount due to short term bad news. But now I
dismiss it because of the business model that I think is doomed.

IMO: Two years from now, CPU will still be around. But it will be gone in ten
or less. There won't be a national physical chain of stores. Software will
directly downloaded or, like TurboTax, an impulse buy at Walmart. Little odds
and ends will also be picked up at Walmart. PCs will be sold over the net or at
non-specialty stores as they become even more of a commodity item.

So where does CPU land? It may be a showroom for PCs, but I doubt it. More
likely it will evolve into a service shop.

I think you can take the internet retail concept a step further to apply to
everyone in the mall to some extent. The information age explosion eliminates
the need for so much of what's there. Why should I go to the kids Gap store in
three different malls to find 6 pairs of jeans for my 9 year old son for
school? I know his size and what I want. I should be able to just click on
style, size, and color and have them arrive at my doorstep. And I do. My wife
bought EVERY Christmas present via the net last year.

Time and convenience needs will kill brick and mortar.

I guess we have possibly different views on the population in general. I see
most as computer illiterate and will stay that way. The idea of all retail at
the net level to me is utopian and orwellian. I don't have a good fact-based
response though.

If I thought the way you did, I'd be buying Amazon, shorting Borders. Instead
I've done the opposite. The fact that your wife made all her purchases on the
internet maybe indicates that the family and people you're exposed to are
extremely into the internet. I live in Silicon Valley, am very net-cognizant,
and my fiancee and I put a lot of miles on our feet this last Christmas, buying
everything in retail physical stores. And it was crowded.

And I've detailed before my frustration in trying to buy a printer on the net.
We're just coming from two different experiences. As most of the investment
community seems to think your way, I'll stay with mine.

Mike, You have good points on my perspective.

I should get out more for a reality check on the general population.

While I envision retail moving to the net, I don't see the value in Amazon and
am looking into leaps there as a way to short in order to avoid the unlimited
exposure.

As another way of looking at CPU, consider their competitors who are on the
net. I'd call them "bad competitors" if they were in my business, because they
aren't going after a profit today but just going after market share. "Bad
competitors" drive down margins in their entire industry until the market share
wars go away.

OT re CPU: I used to work next to one. I'd go in weekly and see what was
selling and talk to the guys on the floor. They'd even look up sales statistics
for me. They could tell me how many had sold over the past week or two, how
many were in stock, and what the delivery time was for any out of stock
software. In this way, I found The Learning Company when it was still small but
growing fast (I got out at the first acquisition). I probably got better true
sales data on them sooner than they got it.

My wife goes to the mall just because she likes to shop. I think you discount
that social behavior. Of course, if the mall just becomes a showroom and
purchases are made elsewhere, it would be doomed long term (with severe

many people with limited educations).

Here's the numbers on VELCF. Trading this morning at 12 3/16.

Some of the numbers are approximates because I am looking at the most recent
annual report. Changes in the value of the investment portfolio would alter
these numbers slightly. But not enough to change the general flavor of the
company or value.

Book Value = 4.58

Investment Portfolio at Cost = 3.16 (market is higher)

Operating Book Value = 1.42 (approximate)

EPS = .91 (including realized gains, interest, dividends)

Earning from operations = .62 (This is a firm estimate. I do not know the exact
tax rate to use in order to separate investment gains from profits)

ROE on operations = 43.7% (.62 / 1.42)

5 year compound sales growth = 13%

1 year sales growth = 10.8%

1 year growth in operating earnings = 23.5%

If you subtract out the value of the investment portfolio and the associated
earnings you are paying less than 15x earnings for a very high ROE business
that seems to still be growing well. Last year's results were affected
negatively by the strike at GM and global weakness in many foreign markets.
Decent results for a bad year.
Growth prospects are related to new applications (ex. diapers) and associated
products, and new markets.

Wow. I guess what I want to see is how they'll grow, since
they're well above any kind of liquidation value or other

and even on some of my recent buys. I'm not sure that I've
made much money doing it yet.

That said, I went and shorted AMZN again today at 185. It was

Mike,

>>Wow. I guess what I want to see is how they'll grow, since

absolute bargain ratios.<<

I have used the ROE strategy very successfully. The key in my mind is that you
have to make sure it's not due to excess leverage and you must also believe
that the company can sustain it. Otherwise you could be paying for above
average levels of profitability. A big NO NO.

Higher ROE companies generate greater levels of free cash flow than average
companies. So the value is there as long as you continue to grow EPS at the
same level as say the market as a whole (or greater). At 14-15 times earnings
you are paying the long term average market multiple for a very above average
company (ROE wise). The key, as you say, is the value of this franchise and its
ability to grow.

The strategy is new applications of the basic product and maintaining very high
quality. (diapers seem to be growing) The brand itself is recognized by
everyone. It's been successful over the last few years as growing sales,
growing EPS, and recent capital spending levels indicate. Comments from
management indicate they believe there's plenty more to come. I hope they're
right.
