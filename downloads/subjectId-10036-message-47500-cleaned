OK, I understand. I am not sure that you (or anyone) has the data to call China
situation correctly, but I am not gonna try to tell you that you are wrong. I
have seen reasonable arguments from both sides, I try not to be too much
engaged to either side. :)

My FCX, RIO, SLT holdings are not very big. I would buy much more if they
collapsed.

BTW, I did not say "world end", I said "world collapse". There is a difference.
The second one is more likely. :)

You can pretend to be self-righteous as much as you like. But if you really
valued SI as a platform and community, you would write articles here.

Now you write articles on SA and other platforms instead of writing them on SI
and come over here to push your other platforms. So really you are just saying
that SI is a cheap advertising place for you, while SA is for big boys who
write serious articles. I wonder why do you need SI audience at all. Not
getting enough reads on SA without it?

Perhaps you should stay on SA. If we want to see your SA articles, we will find
them there without your "selfless" help. I am sure everyone here knows how to
use Google or track their favorite authors on SA.

Jurgis - you are really screwed up in the head or either you have too many
dodo's here trying to market themselves to you, because you are so important in
the world.

SI is the last place i need to advertise and i sure don;t need you to read my
ideas, if you don't want to. I come here from time to time, to either interact
when i can or post when i get my hands on a good idea and in the process also
learn. You can ask Paul or few others. I have more than enough audience for my
ideas on SA and clients around the world - so take my advice and stop sounding
stupid.

Now for why i don;t post them here - well I do when i have a good idea, however
its way too long, so I usually post link to the article I have, either on SA or
on my blog. I have never asked anyone to follow me and hell your viewership on
SA is not gonna make any financial difference to me.

I would recommend, next time you try to generalize or give advice, atleast get
to know the person first, before you open your mouth. I have not only lost
respect for you but honestly, you remind me of a fund manager, I met who, in
trying to give unwanted advice made a fool of himself and also missed of a 4
bagger. I am many years younger to you, but man, atleast today, you did prove
to me that age sometimes truly does not make a difference or sometimes makes it
worst.

And you cannot google me, because I don't write under my name and for good
reason!. The only reason I spoke about my Dell writeup is because people seemed
to be actually invested in the name and I thought my writeup might be of some
help.

For your own good - don't try to win a losing argument, especially when you
don't have facts. And next time, you don;t need to respond to my posts if you
feel like I am trying to market myself here.

C'mon, take it easy guys.
FWIW, the Dell idea is hardly groundbreaking but it has merit. What I like
about Dell is that their balance sheet is strong enough that they can make
mistakes and still stay in business, which is not necessarily the case for HPQ,
which has somewhat similar problems. Therefor, I think Dell has similar upside,
but less downside than HPQ and I would prefer it as an investment.

I don't own it right now, but it's a decent turnaround bet, especially when I
can get it somewhat cheaper.

I read the "non advertised" DELL writeup on SA. It is detailed, but I don't
think it offers much new insight. As I mentioned before, I hold some DELL and I
might buy more.

IMHO, the real question in tech space is not whether DELL is a buy or INTC is a
buy or MSFT is a buy. The real questions are two: how much money to put into
tech space and what company (or companies) to overweigh. Easiest choice is
"some money" and "mostly equal shares", but this is somewhat a copout.

I would be really interested if somebody gave a good argument why one of the
above (or another company like AAPL, GOOG, IBM, STX, SNDK, ORCL, HPQ...) is a
big overweigh vs all the others.

Personally I have MSFT on overweigh, but I don't claim that I have a very
strong argument for it. IMHO, it has potentially highest moat while also having
low valuation. However, it's not a strong argument, since other companies may
have comparable or stronger moats while having a better growth or lower
valuation. Some other companies might also be buyout candidates, while MSFT
isn't.

I believe someone on this thread claimed that HPQ is a best bet in tech space.
I did not find that claim convincing. But that's just me. :)

Overall, I find that making comparative judgement is very tricky and hard.

Disclaimer: I own positions in DELL, INTC, MSFT, SNDK.

Hi Jurgis,

You've touched a nerve and I'll come outof lurking here for a bit

Intel is building our 3 22nm fabs.Capex = 12.4 billion
Samsung is investing in Austin (aapl chips) 12.0 billion
Usmc and Taiwan semi are not able to build enough for qualcomm and AMD.They
pulled in their Capex mid 2011

Capex expenditures playing catch up and a shortage of leading edge capacity.

Seems to me the semi equipment players should have a good run here for the next
year.

They are depressed in price and have fortress balance sheets.

Asml announced yesterday and gave excellent guidance for the next year and
confirmed that investment was tabled in mid 2011 and 2012 will now play ctach
up.

Semi equipment companies have been marked with substantial M&A activity.

Amat has tendered Vsea
Lrcx has tendered Nvls
Advantest has tendered Verigy

Last time a huge run ocurred 1998 - Klac tendered Tencor and it was off for the
entire sector.

I wonder if it is time to rhyme ?

Amat is just now bouncing off it 200 day sma - I just bought my first shares
yesterday - so I am talking my book here.

Well, apparently SI has changed and now it's OK to post content elsewhere and
just link to it here. At one time this was explicitly prohibited by SI TOU, I
guess it no longer is.

This is not limited to one particular poster, who may have good motives - at
least he claims he does. There are others on other threads who abuse this much
more.

IMHO, this will lead to the loss of content, contribution and discussion on SI.

However, since apparently community approves the new standard, who am I to
fight against it. :)

clown - I looked at how Dell has changed over the last 4 - 5 years or so and
its a story where they have really been trying to restructure their business.
they are trying to make their entire business more synergistic and now, instead
of selling PC's they are selling an entire solution to companies. thats whats
good about Dell in addition to the fact that they have been making some pretty
good and scalable acquisitions.

I was at the office of Greenlight Capital 1 month ago and met two prominent
people - cannot get into details here. sorry. however, their main premise for
investing in Dell is the efficient capital allocation that management has been
doing. They really like that.

So i have to agree with you and HPQ is not there yet. Howwver, you will not see
a 30% - 40% upside in dell in 2 to 3 months. Its more like a medium term
investment in my opinion.

always love to learn and improve.

I will say it again - i am not here to promote myself. I am not going to
respond to your idiotic comments and assumptions anymore and besides it pains
me to be rude to someone much older than i am. Therefore discussions on me
trying to promote myself should be over, right here and now.

Next time I share an idea here, you don;t need to read it or respond to it, if
that makes you happy. But in life, atleast don;t try to paint everyone with the

GOgo - you are correct. I mentioned in my writeup. I get bored to rewrite
things. But this time, i will not direct you to SA writeup, otherwise Jurgis
will start again with how i am trying to promote myself...

If you look at the 10K for redbox from 2010 to 2011 and look at the payouts for
studios, these have increased 45% YoY for 2013, 2014, 2015. 2011 is also the
year where they extended/resigned some studio deals such as Universal.

Redbox capitalizes its costs, so you might not see an increase on the income
statement YET but don;t be fooled by it.

If you read the court documents from 2008/09, you will also find how imp.
relationships of studios is with wholesalers and how it affects red box
margins. That relationship which played out for Redbox until now is becoming
more costly, day by day.

so the story does not look too good. There are some other things I am worried
about, such as JV's, recent acquisition, marginally declining footprint in US (
this needs a little more detailed explanation).

So i will be tuning into their calls to see any signs of the probability of my
catalysts panning out and then take an appropriate position...

either of the two but your paying a premium for ibm. If you are comfortable
with that then go for it. As far as the quality of products go HPQ trails ibm
but is ahead of dell. Redhat reported good numbers and a lot of co's are moving
toward redhat which co's usually buy HP or IBM Hardware for. I have been in IT
over 15 years and i have never seen dell in the data center of any co i have
worked at. This is not to say dell isnt a good buy at this level.

The balance sheet metrics are misleading - when looking at HPQ vs DELL. DELL
has a similar D/E ratio than HPQ but that is because HPQ E is bloated by merger
related goodwill. HPQ more meaningful tangible equity is at -16B$.

DELL's balance sheet look great, cash is 2x the LT debt, while HPQ balance
sheet looks like crap.

Man, I could always use some help in this area. I tend to oversimplify
situations and most I don't understand and have to move on, so it's it's been
awhile since I've stuck my neck out in the area, but that doesn't mean I'm not
looking. A few years ago I was in this merger arbitrage and the only way I
could force myself to understand it was by making up an anecdote (I'll include
it here if you have time to read it and I'll definitely take you up on the
offer if I see something).

In June of 2009 when reading the Wall Street Journal, I noticed a passage of
the biggest stock drop of the day, a tiny company called Biotel, Inc located in
Eagan, Minnesota. I got interested in the story and dug deeper and was
interested how investing imitates life...

Once upon a time there were two companies; Cardionet of Conshohocken, PA and
Biotel of Eagan, MN which after a long courtship decided to get married (merge
in business terms). The husband-to-be, Cardionet (or the acquirer as it were),
decided as part of the prenuptial agreement to demand from the beautiful Biotel
to drop one of its customers, or kind of saying to your wife-to-be "I don't
want you to be kissing with your old boyfriend anymore". Biotel dumped the
boyfriend, although had to return some jewellery he had given her (those would
be any future proceeds from the sales between the two) and moved along with the
wedding preparations. For a while the marriage seemed a sure thing and all the
family (the shareholders of Biotel in this case) prepared for the wedding date
(the shareholder's meeting to vote on the merger). The day before the event,
Cardionet forgetting about the prenup, broke off the wedding stating that
Biotel was courted by another man. Based on the prenuptial agreement, Cardionet
was going to pay a dowry of $14 million to the family of Biotel. Regardless of
Cardionet's actions, the family got together on the wedding day and voted to
proceed with the marriage and subsequently filed a legal suit. Cardionet's
response to this statement was: "Why don't you pay me $1 million and we'll
forget about the engagement all together?" Move forward 9 months (no baby
news), and the stock of Biotel had fallen down so much that the market valued
the company between $3 and $4 million, simply nobody wanted to date poor Biotel
anymore, as if she were pregnant indeed. Well, looked closely, not only did
Biotel pulled in about $1 million annually from her full-time job as a nurse
(don't ask me for what services a nurse gets paid like that), but she had no
credit card debt and $1.6 million in cash under the mattress - for a young lad,
Cardionet was not very enthused by the allure of Biotel's mattress. Overall,
Biotel's stock on the "love market" was selling for about half of what it was
carried on the books - the new family members were getting $1 back for every 50
cents they put in to be part of the extended family. On the other hand, there
was the intrinsic value - potential resolution of the legal matter in favor of
Biotel, which would give the family a beautiful return. What gave additional
conviction at the time of joining? For once, none of the close family was
deserting (i.e. there was no insider selling) and the Patriarch of the family
(the CEO) held about 10% of Biotel (there's no explanation in life for this
relationship besides that he was a loving father), so he was going to do
anything in his power to see his daughter married.

Move forward to November 8, 2010 and the resolution came - the two parties met
up and kissed up (that's as much as we know about that encounter). Cardionet
said that he'll pay a dowry of $11 million, or about $3.8 a share. The price of
the stock shot 150% in one day. A lot of the family ran for the exits at that
point, exchanging their invitations for hard cash. Well, in that hurry they
forgot to read that under the new agreement, the family was going to split up
the working capital (cash and receivables less any credit card debt) of Biotel.
For the ones that stayed, they drank and ate at the wedding and had so much fun
- even raised a toast to the young family!

re MSFT -
I think the one product that has received little buzz but has significant

something after all with this asset) merged with MS Messenger.

The company I work for is starting to adopt it and get's completely rid of the
the legacy phone system. This will probably open up a new subscription based
revenue source and since it is linked with outlook and works with Office it
reinforces the moat that MSFT has with corporate customers.

At least on the PP presentations the Lynx capabilities look good. I think this
may also be a way for MSFT to get a hold on the tablet market for corporate
customers, since it should work well on tablet platforms.

I believe we also have ATT phone but this will phase out in a couple of month

So far the hearsay is that Lync works well. I think the impact of Lync on MSFT

GBLB.BR at 52.5Euro - decided to take a flier on this Belgian holding company
on what appears to be a widening discount to NAV. As mentioned before, GBL has
holdings in many European large cap stocks that I consider cheap, foremost TOT,
Suez, Lafarge, Pernod and material company Imersys.

They did sell off some shares in Arkema and peeled of some Pernod to reduce the
already small leverage. I believe they are now in a net cash position. There is
also a nice dividend coming soon (~2 Euros).

The discount (to NAV) on to of a discount (owning cheap stocks) makes GBLB.BR

Hi robert -

Re: Graham Number

I have now been using this as one of my main metrics for new buys. For me it is
a fast and easy 1st screen that I can modify to an EK$ value adjusting for
company specific factors and events. I have found that I have made money with
some of the most boring (off the radar) stocks so OMG may be a good value pick
especially if/when the semiconductor cycle picks up (as Intel recently
described in their 2012 forward look presentation).

The key is to spread your bets around and not to necessarily focus on leading
edge technology products but rather support type components (ie. capacitors,
connectors, simple test equipment) that does not change too much from each new
development cycle.

I have found more companies in the Oil & Gas sector that sell below their GN
but have not really screened too many in other sectors. From the list in the
article, Cascade Corp. (CASC)is one that pops out for me. Their GN value is
$49.28 (article uses BV rather than TBV but even w/ a TBV at $20.07/share the
stock sells below it's GN). I have added CASC to my watch list. Their 3%
dividend is a bonus too.

As has been pointed out in several comments regarding the Graham Number, there
are specific minimum criteria that companies must meet to generate a GN that
means something. First, EPS must be positive and reflect at least a 10 year
stream. I will let some companies get a pass if EPS show a one time loss that
might be a company specific issue that is easily explained. Use TBV not BV when
possible as BV contains Goodwill charges that really add no $ value to the
enterprise. PE s/d be 15 or less but I will use up to 20 if that number
reflects the industry average. Finally, the GN has worked well for me when I
initiate a "Buy" but almost always has gotten me out too early when I use it to
calculate a fair value market "Sell" price.

Therefore, when the GN equals or exceeds the market price, I remove the stock
from my GN watch list and watch it more closely for company and/or industry
specific news. I watch it with a short leash and might begin to scale out of
the position w/ one of my first three sells. Many of these GN finds will and
have become multi baggers (ie CBI is one I own) so keep at least a 1/3 position
in your basket to obtain the higher valuation the market is providing during
this peak cycle run.

I continue to fine tune my use of the GN. I am not so sure what will happen to
GN valuations if/when the FED starts to raise interest rates but I expect more
refinment will be required.

much all my computer drives.

So I am looking at STX trading at multiyear highs and I wonder if SNDK could be

True. That's why I usually buy on valuation. With SNDK, the valuation is
difficult, since they have had great 2010-2011, but crappy 2009 and Q1 2012. If
you don't average and look just at Q1 2012, it's overvalued here. That's very
conservative though. If I average, I still think I don't want to add here. I
would reevaluate around $30. If you believe that 2010/2011 is the new norm and
Q1 2012 is exception, then it is very cheap. I am not sure we can make that
assumption though.

But obviously others who believe that SNDK is cheap here, could add it here. :)
Or if they don't have position at all, small tracking position might be
worthwhile. :)

re Pargesa, GBLB.BR - these are layers in the holding structure that Power/
Frere control jointly that was build to enable control with less capital, imo.
Pargesa's main asset is its 50%+ holding in GBLB, which holds straight stakes
in several public companies.

The problem I am having with Pargesa is that they count their NAV based on
their share of the ,b>NAV of GBLB.BR not their share of the current GBLB stock
market value (GBLB NAV is 30%+ higher than GBLB stock market value right now).

So this inflates Pargesa NAV as stated on their website. the argument of course
is that they control GBLB, which is true since they have more than 50% of the
voting rights. My personal preference with these holding structures is to go
down as far as possible because that way NAV are more straightforward to
calculate. it remains to be seen if this is correct, because Frere took out the
NAT.BR layer out first and has shuffled some Imerys holdings from Pargesa to
GBLB, a transaction, which slightly favored Pargesa.

I think they could easily take out either GBLB or Pargesa to unlock the
difference between the NAV and the lower market value but that would cost them
some capital to buy out the minority shareholders (unless they do some sort of
a swap, but that is difficult, because the holdings trade in different stock
markets).

Another thing that i can see happening is that Imerys (which they control)
either becomes a 100% holding, via buyout, or they sell them for a nice premium
to a willing buyer. But of course in any, case, we are talking probably years
here. For now, i am happy to hold some decent European stocks (which in
aggregate i consider undervalued by itself) at a larger than usual discount and
getting 2 Euro/share in dividend (minus some taxes) in about a month.

Shane, regarding HITK, I agree with Jurgis Bekepuris that this pharmaceutical
company's losses in '07, '08 are a concern. Even with the stock now down from
ytd highs (i.e. from $43 to $33), I still don't see it as value stock with a
margin-of-safety. However, IF the company could maintain its current very good
profit margins and ROE (which the company has not been able to do in past),
then the stock should do okay. Seems to have plenty of cash and negligible ltd,
so that helps.

I'll go for a few shares here for a spec. While HITK does fall into my value
box on it's current good numbers, its history is not so encouraging.

Nursing-home landlord, Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (SBRA) posted the
second-best performance in the latest quarter with a total return of 38.8%.
Last year, the stock of the company, based in Irvine, Calif., posted a total
return of negative 29% on fears that steep cuts in Medicare reimbursements
would hurt the ability of its tenants to pay rent.

Joel Beam, a fund manager at the Forward Select Income Fund and one of Sabra's
largest shareholders, said the company and its tenants should be able to cut
expenses to offset expected drops in Medicare revenues. Besides, "there aren't
many stocks out there that you can get an 8% yield," Beam said. Sabra's yield
is significantly higher than industry's average of roughly 3%.

Have you looked at this REIT? I agree there aren't too many with this yield and
sadly I know cuts are being made in this field left and right; their holdings
include 76 skilled nursing facilities, ten combined skilled nursing, assisted
living and independent living facilities, five assisted living facilities, two
mental health facilities, one independent living facility, one continuing care
retirement community, and one acute care hospital. I have been holding SNH for
quite a while, and it has been a nice yielding "bond" but I would like some
more growth.

Also am looking at ROIC (Retail Opportunity Investments Corp), but have only
scratched the surface on that one and the yield is much lower than SBRA.

Exxon Mobil Corporation Common (NYSE: XOM) - peeled off 27% of position (Market
price exceeds GN)
C&J Energy Services, Inc. Commo (NYSE: CJES) - started a "value" swing trade
position @ $16.45/share.

http://goo.gl/HyCJi

I noticed that XOM is one of my only integrated oils where its GN ($78.55) is
less than the current market price ($85.30). The stock is 8% overvalued
according to this metric. Peeled off 27% of my shares (purchased 7/2010 @
$58.02) and plan to deploy the funds into better undervalued oil propositions.
HES tops my buy list below $54/share. The GN for HES is $85.16 (I used 2012 EPS
avg est. $6.76 w/ a TBV= $47.68). The current market price for HES is $55.07
but I think I can buy it cheaper in the coming weeks and/or month.

After blowout earnings by HAL and SLB both stating that their North American
operations exceeded their expectations, I decided to start a "value" swing
trade position in CJES. CJES provides hydraulic fracturing, coiled tubing, and
pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas exploration and production
companies.

Halliburton Profit Rises as U.S. Oil Fracking Demand Grows
By David Wethe on April 18, 2012
http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-18/halliburton-first-quarter-profit-ri
es-as-fracking-demand-grows

Although I am generally negative now on the market in general (looking for at
least a 10% correction... or more to $SPX 1340; Sell in May & Go Away), I
believe there are pockets of value that can be traded with a low risk & high
reward strategy. Rather than trying to find overvalued short plays, I am
utilizing a new technique (for me) establishing what I call <u>"value" swing
trade positions</u> that can be put on during a correcting/down overall market.

I believe CJES is one of these plays. CJES has a GN value of $22.98 (TBV=$5.87
& 2012 EPS est=$4.00). My purchase price of $16.45 provides me a buy in point
that is 40% below what I consider to be a fair value for the company (as
measured by the GN). Private equity firm Greenwich (
http://houston.citybizlist.com/17/2012/4/18/General-Atlantic-Reports-69.4-Milli
n-Stake-in-CJ-Energy-Services--cbl.aspx ), CT-based General Atlantic LLC filed
an SEC Form SC 13D/A indicating that it now holds 4.2 million 8.1% of
outstanding shares, an increase from the 3.4 million shares. They had been
acquiring stock in the open market from March 20 ($18.00) through April 9
($17.00). I estimate that the average price they paid during this period was
around $17.50/share.

My strategy is to swing trade the position to generate a 30 day gain of 20% by
(1) selling May $17.50 covered calls for $1.50 and/or (2) take a quick $1.00
gain on 1/3 of my shares at $17.50/share and selling the rest in increments up
to $19.75/share and/or (3) some combination of both. The key for me is this is
not a long term buy and hold.

I believe with the new 8.1% stock owner in at $17.50/share, my downside risk is
small and on any rally, the stock could easily move back to their average
acquisition cost of $17.50/share. There has been rumors to take the company
private especially with cheap money trying to find a home in very profitable
businesses.

My defensive sell target of $19.75/share should leave enough value in the
shares even in any sustained general market sell off (worst case scenario) that
I can exit today's buy with a profit.

Intrinsic value: I give my opinion, fwiw.

I neither agree nor disagree that the formula you present is the proper
definition of intrinsic value. When I go on the internet to see if it is, I
find several intrinsic value formulas.

What is the author of the book proposing you do with the formula, if anything?

If you are a business, MBA student, then you better know and use an equation
like this in your homework/project assignments. 'Cause that is what's taught.
Academically it seems to be estimating the stream of future cash flows
(discounted back to the present). If you are trying to make money in the stock
market, then predicting the future with a discount rate to calculate present
value, imo, is very dangerous. Not necessary either. (jmo, others will differ)

You will find here (this site) that several people are using the Graham Number
or a modification of it, to estimate intrinsic value. While I myself don't use
the Graham Number, it seems to me to be much more useful and practical than the
formula that the author presents to you. (In terms of screening, and
determining buy and sell prices or ranges).

ROIC I have been following and have a postion in. ROIC has an advantage in the
REIT field as it was formed after the collapse in real estate prices. It was
therefore able to accumulate valuable property at distressed prices. They had
extra everage by being well funded, so they were able to buy property without a
need for financing...a better price and no financing costs.

They have a formula for what they look for in their investments; shopping
centers anchored by a drug store or supermarket all in high population middle
class or upper class locations, and have done very well in their short history.
They get high grades when comparing their growth to other REITs, but they have
a short history with a good start.

Don't know if you knew that I posted to you about ROIC a few months ago.

I spent the last few days visiting my dad in a rehab center. There are no beds
available in his area. He had to wait in the hospital until there was space in
a rehab center, and each time he has returned to the hospital for overnight
care his room was given to the whomever was first on the waiting list. He was
not guaranteed his room or even that the same rehab center would have an
opening when he was released from the hospital. I don't know how crowded senior
facilities are throughout the country, but I am sure there are lots of senior
citizens needing services. I don't know what happened during the Clinton
presidency when healthcare cuts forced many health care related operators into
bankruptcy. I plan on looking into that, but from what I see, these operators
are now trading at or below book and have healthy profit margins and there is
public demand.

SBRA, as you cited pays out an excellent div., much higher than any other REIT
in the same field. There's not enough data since the spin off to get a good
read other than to look at SUNH since 75% of SBRA's income comes from SUNH.
SUNH reported in January that they were able to mitigate cuts in govt. payouts
by paying down debt, IT solutions and other improvements. While SUNH survives
to pay SBRA rent, SBRA is safe.

Thanks for your thoughts on SBRA. I do need to do some more reading. I could
not find a website for SBRA.

Did you look into SGT's long term agreements? SGT's LTAs have increased
dramatically. Price on LTAs benefits their customers and SGT can better plan on
production to meet demand. But what happens if prices drop significantly and
customers walk away? SGT ends up with a huge backlog and further deprecess
product price. I see this as inevitable given that the shortage created by the
Thailand floods will eventually be resolved.

I think that the Alpha site is fantastic for what you get. Sure there's some
not so good stuff, but there's a bunch of gems. It always comes down to doing
your own research anyway.
