More bad news for Chinese jeweler FUQI. Among my largest losers. I had bet it
could have been a competitor to Tiffany in the Chinese market. Maybe not a
close competitor, but with a p/e 1/4 that of TIF's and an apparently strong
balance sheet and growth, a growing profitable company.

It may still overcome its issues. That's it for me though for a while. Out now.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=fuqi

Something just not right with these stocks. Too many are down. And it's not
just my picks, because I have too many different companies for it to be stock
specific. Either the Chinese small cap market is out of favor with investors as
a macro call on China economy and/or fear of government intervention, or the
system is so suspiciously corrupt that we are seeing company after company with
accounting issues, fraud issues, insiders roughshod over small outsider
investors, etc.

I'm selling because of the pain and losses, and because I want to redeploy
monies elsewhere. My opinion is that my sales at max pain might be a very good
indicator that people here might consider it a good contrary indicator and
should maybe consider buying into this sector now. There is continuing growth
in China, and these small caps will grow.

I'm keeping some of these stocks on my watch list, and if I see some good news
or regain some of my confidence, I may buy back in.

Eyaktek - hidden stake

Yes the Seeking Alpha takes the EyakTek stake at $23m annual earnings and
multiplies by PE 7.5 (privately held) to arrive at a $172m value (GTSI owns
38%) therefore, the adjusted value is $65.5m.

The value seems conservative given EyakTek's niche operations as an
Alaskan-Indian company (favorable terms from gov't as you previously stated).

GTSI is getting hit by downturn in gov't IT spending, Q3 and Q4 are supposed to
bring in the money every year, so let's see. Eventually gov't IT spending will
rise as IT systems eventually become obsolete.

Here is the valuation of the article:

Stated - Adjusted

Cash $24m - $24m (100%)
Net receivables $113m - $107m (95%) uncle sam always pays
Inventory $9m - $4.5m (50%) conservative value
Other current assets $7m - $3.5m (50%) conservative value
Long term receivables (lease) $26m - $20m (75%) conservative value

EyakTek stake $8.5m - $64m (37% ownership interest) rolling 4 qrt earnings =
$23m *PE 7.5 (Q1 2010 earnings doubled compared to Q1 2009), value of stake
likely to be higher in 2010

Plant & Property $11m - $5.5m (50%)

--------------------------------------------------------------

Total liabilities - $112m
Shares outstanding: 9.6m (Q2 2010)
Adjusted book value: $121.5m or $12.65 per share
(increase from our previously stated $12.10)

Unilens Vision - Jurgis, I see that the company issued $6.5m in a facility from
Regions bank with a variable interest rate.

? Do you know why they bought out their largest shareholder Uniivest Holding
AG?

I am very curious what else you see in the company.

The shareholder right now is getting a 8% return on FCF (including the large
royalties), given the EV value of about $15m with the new debt issuance. I
normalized the FCF for the year using the past qtr figures with new interest
expense, I arrive at about $1.2m. ($1.2m/15m = 8%)
I like to see a FCF return of at least 15%, preferably 20%.

Unilens' core lens business is also loss making due to higher competition and a
slower economy.

They also pay out most of net income via a dividend, exposing the shareholder
to higher taxes (doesn't matter since they can't invest it at higher return
given the state of the core business).

with his ability to grasp detail and marshal evidence, he is well suited for

891&releaseSeq=0

Penn West Energy Trust Announces Plans for Corporate Conversion, Increases to
Capital Program, and Changes to Monthly Distributions

1) Cutting Monthly distribution from $0.15 per unit per month to $0.09 per unit
per month.

2) Horizontal drilling Results "exceeded expectations".

From the article:"...Drilling results to-date have exceeded expectations. Two
of our most recent wells, drilled approximately 70 kilometers apart, had
initial test flow rates in excess of 2,000 bbls of light oil per day. One of
these wells was in Willesden Green and delivered first month average production
of 860 boe per day. <u>Penn West believes these results are not confined to a
specific part of the Cardium, but are indicative of opportunities across the
trend.</u> Our current inventory of approximately 3,000 locations and our
growing experience in the use of horizontal technology provides us with
confidence that we can consistently meet and/or exceed our previously published
type curve expectations. ..."

3) Drilling in the Waskada fields exceeds expectations too.

From the article:"...In the Waskada / Goodlands Amaranth play in southwest
Manitoba, much like in the Cardium trend, our recent results have exceeded
expectations. Recently we drilled and completed what we believe is a
groundbreaking well in the area. After an innovative 40-stage fracture, this
well has been put on production without artificial lift at a rate of
approximately 200 boe per day. This significant well is producing at a level
2.0x – 2.5x our typical type curve for the area....

===============================================================

Stock traded on 4x it's average volume and after opening down 6% ended up for
the day.

The company will ramp up it's light oil resource plays (using horizontal
drilling technology) for Q4 2010 by $150 million. 85% of their 2011 capital
program ($1.0 - $1.2 billion ) will be allocated to this area next year too.

By the end of 2011, they should have a better accounting of their actual
"proved" reserves AFTER completing the horizontal drilling technology on
several of their properties.

Regarding GTSI and its Eyak Tex stake,

It feel that it is probably worth much more than the company has it on the
books for.

However, I would attribute a lower PE to it because I don't see much
information on it (hence I have trouble getting real comfortable with its
financials and operations). I am also not big on investing in companies that
are dependent on subsidies/special treatment. Government subsidies are not my

larger US cities.

Fwiw, I added a few more SKX shares today, as stock fell further. In total,
just a very small position for me.

is that SKX it's sort of like COV for me, which I held various times and made
money with my entries. It may not look like a value to most others, but some
stocks just work out for some people and not for others.

As for SKX, they neither seem a clear buy nor a sell to me, probably closer to
a buy. To to the fuzziness I see in their business direction (betting on fads)
I probably need to wait for a cheaper entry point because my conviction to buy

I guess I should have consulted with you before making my inital purchased.
would have saved some bucks.

Here is a puzzler. numbers aproximate: fund sells for $12. nav 21 but dilluted
nav is 16 because of warrants that sell for $1 allowing you to purchase more
shares for $12. now it seems to me that if you owned all the shares in the
company it would make sense to buy all the warrants and let them retire
worthless as it would cost $1 per share to add $5 of NAV. However if you own a
small number of shares does that plan make sense as well? what if you owned 10
or 20% of the shares? Now originally the fund floated a unit consisting of one
share and one warrant so its very possible that the majority of shares are
owned by individual who own the same number of warrants as shares. from a tax
point of view if one buys is these in a taxable accounts and instructs the
brokerage to allow them to retire worthless even though they have economic
value. can you still deduct the loss from your income?

re the fund. So let me see if I get this right - the fund trades at 12$ (NAV is
currently 21$ but would be 16$ after the rights are exercised). The rights
allowing you to purchase more shares at 12$. So essentially they have no
intrinsic value but they should have some residual value as a short term call
option.

Now as to the question if it makes sense to buy rights and let them expire
worthless , I assume for a small investor it would not be worth the trouble. if
many would do it it would help to reduce the dilution Furthermore it could well
be that there are oversubscription rights - some offerings allow investors to
obtain more new shares (they have to sign up for it) if other investors let
their rights expire. This is another way for management to make sure their
offering is fully subscribed.

Car to post the name of the fund here? The very NAV dilutive offering is not a
sign of a shareholder friendly management but the fund shares may already be
punished enough for it.

FWIW, I picked up a partial fill in HQS on Friday. The stock now trades for
less than the cash on their balance sheet. The company is still profitable,
earning close to three million for the first six months. Short interest is at
its lowest for the past year.

Management has killed the stock, but I'm betting that HQS is oversold and, at
some point, will trade much higher than its cash value.

I'm holding my shares, so I'm betting that the numbers add up. As much a the
attention has turned to Chinese micro-caps, it should be noted that bad numbers
aren't limited to Chinese stocks least we forget about Enron, Worldcom, AIG.
etc. (Irish banks anyone?) Trusting any company is a bit of a leap of faith
these days.

But, I agree that involving Deloitte is a step in the right direction. Having
them take over the account would be even better.

But, so far, there has been no indication that GFRE is cooking the books. Sites
that have studied both the SEC and SAIC reporting have not mentioned GFRE.

http://chinesecompanyanalyst.com/about/

GFRE is suffering more from having BDO limited as their auditor.

One must remember that GFRE is a company that deals with commodities. Factors
that have increased the price of bromine have been corroborated by other
international companies.

LOL- are you sure its not a spoof?

SEATTLE, WA--(TP Newswire – 8-22-2010). HQ Sustainable Nightmaritime (HQSN ), a
leading consumer of investor’s cash, today announces a surprise follow on
offering of 5 million shares of common stock priced at $2.00 per common share.
An additional 800,000 shares will be available for over allotment. WTF Bank is
acting as the underwriter for this transaction.
This offering will provide HQSN with approximately $9.3 million in net proceeds
that will be used for debt repayment, capital expenditures, and general
corporate purposes. HQSN’s CEO, Mr. Snowbert Spurns, justified the massive
dilution as follows: “Our management team identified 10 reasons for an
additional capital raise. This simply was too many reasons to ignore and we
felt that we needed to act quickly.” Mr. Spurns added “The fact that we
identified 10 reasons to raise capital now clearly supports management’s
actions. The identified reasons for the current equity offering include:
1. It came to our attention that there are 800 tour buses that bring in over 20
million tourists daily in some parts of China. This underscores our basic
business thesis that there is @#$%load of people in China.
2. With an average of more than 25,000 tourists packed into each bus tighter
than a pond full of tilapia, we concluded they can’t all fit in the usual
cultural and historical tourist sites. We expect the spillover tourists to hang
out at nutraceutical and bio-marine product stores to replenish their pockets
full of shark fins and fish liver pills.
3. Existing cash is allocated to other capital projects that are not expected
to ever generate any significant positive cash flow – just like our previous
capital projects. Therefore, we need additional cash to strike rapidly while
China’s population remains large and tourists continue to be unbelievably and
densely packed in buses. This business opportunity will not last forever.
4. The additional cash will allow us to further vertically integrate our
operation through innovative downstream capital deployment. In addition to our
rapid expansion of nutraceutical and bio-marine market stalls placed throughout
China’s many outdoor markets (referred to as our superstores), HQSN will extend
even further downstream by hiring local Chinese consumers to shop in its
stores. This innovative initiative is expected to immediately increase HQSN’s
sales and provide a new platform for sales growth. Everybody knows that, when
it comes to sales, more is better.
5. Ms. FU, HQSN’s founder, chairman, and largest shareholder, has an extended
family that needs a new fleet of Mercedes and this company is not generating
enough cash to meet this important need. We don’t want the densely packed
tourists to see Ms. FU’s family drive older model cars.
6. The capital raise fits within HQSN’s previously announced Shareholder’s
Value Reduction (SVR) Program. This program provides our investors important
relief from paying capital gains taxes.
7. With a stock price that traded more than $14/share in 2007, the current
capital raise accelerates our SVR Program and we believe it now places HQSN’s
SVR achievement at greater than 98 percent of all US-listed Chinese companies.
This remarkable achievement will attract a new crop of bottom-feeding investors
necessary to sustain our SVR Program.

TTT,

I have been investing in the TTT rights offering just like I do stock
offerings. I loaded up during the offering period and would now be looking to
pare back now that the stock is up 10%. The stock usually trades cheap into the
offering and then often rebounds afterwards (assuming it is not a toxic
company, which I don't think it is in this case).

I will look to start unwinding my trading position and keep a core position on
this one, since the management is savvy if overly complex. I put in for a lot
of oversubscription, but it does not look like I will get much.

In case anyone wonders, here is a follow up of mine on Chinese microcaps from
last year, which I said basically to avoid unless you have strong confirmation
that the company is legitimate.

Here are a few questions you might ask yourself:
What is your competitive advantage in Chinese microcaps? How do you know which
ones are legitimate versus which ones are scams? Are you the most knowledgeable
about these companies of all the current and potential investors? I can't
truthfully answer yes to these, so I stay out of most of these stocks.

Warnings signs:
1. Stock is ludicrously cheap (PEs in the 2s, etc). Are the company managers
that dumb they wouldn't invest in their own stock if they believed in the
prospects? No, these guys are smart. If it looks too good to be true, it
probably is. One possible exception is in an economic crisis when even
reputable companies can sell for cheap as institutions/hedge funds are forced
to liquidate large positions.

2. Company issues stock at 52-week lows, way below book/cash with great
earnings, etc. Again, it is either a scam or the owners care so little about
you (diluting you at huge cost), why would you want them to continue managing
your money?

Granted, you might miss out on a 10-bagger as speculative fever takes these
stocks up, but I am not big on greater fool investing.

I am tempted by GFRE, however. It seems to me to be a legimitate company and,
if it is, I think it is a buy. If anyone could help convince me of that (not
sure you can, but would love to hear input), I'd be buying it here.

Catalysts?

If it's a Buffettology investment, it needs no catalysts. Great companies
continue great business performance. Eventually the spread between the great
business performance and the market price will be enough for market to
recognize the disparity. The longer it takes, the more shares I can accumulate.

If it's a profitable Graham net-net, either company gets bought (takeover) or
the net-cash continues to grow compared to market price. Again, this disparity
cannot hold forever.

I don't need any other catalysts. :) I don't invest in turnarounds, craparounds
or other speculations that need catalysts. :)

Comments on yours:
1. New management - how can you evaluate the goodness or badness of management?
I never could and I think 99% of the people can't
2. Share buy-backs - it's somewhat OK, but IMHO it's never a deciding factor.
Share dilution is bad though. Share buybacks at inflated price are common, bad,
but almost unavoidable in Buffettology businesses (KO, PEP, etc.)
3. Spin-offs - this is a special situation investing and should be done as
such. Don't invest in a company expecting spin-off, it may never happen.
4. Asset sales - see comment on spin-offs.
5. Change in corporate strategy - see comment on new management.

an economic crisis when even reputable companies can sell for cheap as
institutions/hedge funds are forced to liquidate large positions.

Which is what happened last year. Which is what is happening this year when
people dump shares because of panic, double-dip, China is going to
crash/die/burn, etc. Most of the Chinese small caps are not owned by mutual
funds. They are too small and illiquid for that. They are owned by Yahoo
pump-and-dump crowd that only recognizes the momentum and trades on it.

It's fine if you prefer not to invest there. It's fine if you want to persuade
others not to invest there. People who prefer to invest there will get to buy
more shares at cheaper prices. :)

I don't think you are adding much substance to the debate by throwing out
generic cliche comments though. We have already heard 100 times that Chinese
small caps are all fraud and self dealing American-investor fleecing bastards.
How about something concrete about GFRE or any companies you are interested in?
Why should WE persuade you to buy GFRE? Why can't YOU do some DD that would

Jurgis, my catalyst comments:

I agree with you on closing of the spread between performance and market price
with Buffett/Graham net-nets. Here is my response to your comments on the
catalysts:

1. New management - how can you evaluate the goodness or badness of management?
I never could and I think 99% of the people can't

*You can evaluate this partly by looking at the management's track record
(acquisition, growth, other capital allocation decisions) in the past. Perhaps
the new CEO was previously successful and is making drastic changes...and the
results are becoming positive.

2. Share buy-backs - it's somewhat OK, but IMHO it's never a deciding factor.
Share dilution is bad though. Share buybacks at inflated price are common, bad,
but almost unavoidable in Buffettology businesses (KO, PEP, etc.)

*That's why you see past track record of share buy-backs and determine if
current buyback price is reasonable.

3. Spin-offs - this is a special situation investing and should be done as
such. Don't invest in a company expecting spin-off, it may never happen.

*Spin-offs have produced annual results of 20% on average...you are right,
never speculate on a spin-off, but when announced look rigorously at the terms,
sometimes they are very favorable.

4. Asset sales - see comment on spin-offs.

*Partial asset sales can unveil value of the whole asset to the market

5. Change in corporate strategy - see comment on new management.

*Company may jump unprofitable divisions, boosting the bottom line.

6. Activist investors - if company needs activist investors, it's an avoid for
me. Most of the time.

*Activist investors such can enforce good capital allocation decisions and
force the company to avoid making bad ones.

7. M&A activity - Don't invest in a company expecting M&A, it may never happen.

*A purchase of a more profitable business can boost profits, a sale of
unrelated division may allow the company to focus on core business, etc....

1. Industry consolidation - see note on M&A. how do you evaluate if this is
good/bad?

*Fewer competitor's = higher margins

2. Cyclicality - don't buy cyclicals or have cyclical-specific investment
approach.

*Mr. Market often overreacts to negativity, pushing some cyclicals to
ridiculous valuations

GFRE,

Jurgis, I will look for more information, but not speaking or being Chinese I
feel am at a disadvantage against oh 1.3 billion people or so. Here is what I
could discern so far. The top holders, including the Chairman of the Board are
Chinese and have not been selling, although I don't see the CEO or CFO owning
shares, which bothers me a little. My overall exposure to the company gives me
a gut feeling that the company is not a fraud. However, unlike George Bush, I
am not willing to make a big gamble on a gut feeling.

gcrispin came up with some good links, which I think are the best leads at this
point in determining the validity of the company. I also note Madharry has done
analysis on the stock and his ideas have served me over the years.

Side note: You admit yourself you are buying stocks owned by the Yahoo pump and
dump crowd, so at least you are being honest about playing the greater fool
theory.

By the way, I have seen any real analysis on these Chinese stocks from you --
why don't you do what you recommended me to do and post something substantive.

Small e&p's. I don't know what the appropriate valuation methodologies are. I
know what I'm using, but as people here have commented about them or their own
methods, I'm less sure I'm correct.

I'll have to look closer at my notes to see if I've got any links to forward to
you. I've quickly scanned Google again now, and I don't see anything I like
regarding valuation methods. This link seems current and somewhat helpful:

http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article22565.html

----
I am using three methods:
1. Enterprise value to nav. Enterprise value definitions vary. Nav even more
so. I use proved and probable reserves. As I infer from others here,
proved-only should be safer, more accurate, and maybe all-around better.
2. Enterprise value to value of flowing production. I like oil. I don't like or
much use gas equivalent production.
3. Land value. Estimate of net acreage owned in high po oil shale fields. Using
values based on recent sales of adjacent or similar fields. (I am buying some
small e&p companies solely because they have land in some very high potential
oil shale areas (e.g. Bakken).)

I'll point out my modus operandi and contrast that with what appears some
others are doing, and this may be helpful and cautionary for you. If I find
stocks in a sector that's downtrodden and seems opportune now, I like to buy a
package of stocks in that sector. Sometimes a large package. Consisting of
SMALL positions in a large number of holdings. Depending on how judgmental you
are, this ultimately may be viewed as doing inadequate dd or surface dd or
sloppy dd. Perhaps also not considering valuation methods more carefully or
stringently. Also, maybe a sub optimum way of operating-- essentially because I
am looking for ways to include companies in the sector for my portfolio,
whereas others might study the sector and the stocks within the sector and look
at their values closely and intensely so as to cull the list and select only
those stocks or that particular stock which seems to have the "best" chance for
success and/or the least chance of losing. This all boils down to if there are
people here like Spekulatius who do seem to study carefully both the broad and
narrow aspects of the companies and their businesses, these folks are likely to
have, if not a better way to value these companies than I do, perhaps at least
a safer and maybe more logical one as well.

As regards the e&p sector, my belief is it won't matter. If oil holds, and frac
drilling continues, for me, I'll have losers, but if I'm somewhat careful with
position size, my winners will carry my losers, and I'll wind up okay. Not as
well as others maybe, but okay for me.

GL, and let us know what you find that we can use for our learning too, and
what e&p stocks you ultimately choose for purchase.

RE: Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. (ARI)

4:13PM Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance announces proposed common stock
offering of 6 mln shares (ARI) 17.40 -0.13 : Net proceeds from the offering
will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt
and investment in target assets, with a focus on performing commercial first
mortgage loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities, mezzanine financings and
other real-estate related debt investments.

=================================================================

I noticed that this was one you owned earlier this year. Their proposed stock
offering would increase the outstanding shares by 60% from 10.65 million to
16.65 million. Not too sure what happens to their dividend but just based on
the increased shares it would fall down to a 6% yield which would be at the low
end for the industry.

If the stock falls into the low teens based on dilution, there may be a "buy on
the sell off" buying opportunity. I suppose you could write a short term
in-the-money call on any bounce to lock in the st gain.

Stock already down 4% in after hours trading.

What's your take of their portfolio of loans. Assuming no double-dip and a very
slow domestic economic recovery, their secondary equity offering could generate
a good chunk of capital so that they can acquire more distressed real estate
and/or sure up any sour loans in their portfolio.

strategy. The Company's Form S-3 shelf registration statement was declared
effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 31, 2010. The
registration statement provides the Company flexibility to offer and sell from
time to time up to $120 million of securities, including equity, debt and other

remain an important part of our growth strategy and we plan to use our common
stock as currency for acquisitions, but only at levels that are accretive to
our existing shareholders."

Not too sure why the company issued a S-3 shelf registration to raise $120
Million when they already have $55 million cash in the bank?

It has been their strategy to grow by acquisition and to have access to more
funds through the possible sale of stock (or acquired debt) provides management
flexibility when structuring another deal. Just hope that when the deal(s) are
done, they indeed are accretive and not just fancy accounting.

FWIW, I have owned U.S. companies where a lot of fancy accounting was done and

re ARI - the operating model for the commercial mortgage REIT's (ARI, STWD)
simply does not work. i might have worked if spreads for Commercial mortgage
debt had stayed sky high as in late 2008/early 2009 in combination with access
to relatively cheap money through government programs (TALF etc.).

Spreads for mortgage backed debt have collapsed however faster than most trusts
could get their funds to work and that in conjunction with their relatively
high management costs makes the operating model for these entities
unattractive, imo.

I think they now try to cater to yield pigs that mix up yield with Return of

selections of stocks and /ES (Emini S&P500 futures) levels in the main IM chat
room under the moniker "spm." I became a member there a year ago as most of the
prop traders and hedge fund managers there are fellow IBDers. As the name
suggests we are all pattern traders, so it made sense for me to be there. I
absolutely love it! We catch the movers before they go, and we get out before
they fizzle out. Let 'em rest.... set up again... and then get 'em again. Wash,
rinse, and repeat. Our "bible" is How To Make Money In Stocks by William J.
Oneil.

Along with market leading stocks my passion has become trading the Emini S&P500
futures. While I'm not swinging 200 lot positions like some of my Chicago
friends the cash flow that is and can be extracted from this very liquid market
is phenomenal. I use Ben Lichtenstein's pit squawk during market hours
(www.tradersaudio.com) which happens to be free via the market cast chatroom of
Think or Swim's platform. I use Infinity futures dome for my execution. Their
feed is direct to the floor, so it's actually faster than TOS's chart! So I use
patterns intraday on the 5min chart along with the audio to gauge what the
locals and paper (institutional players ie: GS, MS, JPM, ChiCorp, etc) are
doing. You'll find that this market is the tail that wags the dog of the US
stock markets.
**Here's the audio from the flash crash:

To say the least this was a crazy day. If interested in this there are 6
tutorial videos to explain what you're hearing. Pretty much like listening to a
cattle auction all day! I'm used to it now.

If you check out my blog at www.tcmllc.blogspot.com you can view my shared
items which are articles selected from my google reader. My twitter feed is
also available there as well. Just recently we've seen the QQQQ and QLD have a
10/240 simple moving average cross over which can be a prelude to a larger
trend as put forth in a study done by my friend Easan Katir. The link to that
white paper can be found on my twitter feed. That simple 10/240 cross over can
be applied to any equity for that matter and can save you from disaster on a
stock that's trending the wrong direction.

I like to scan the charts within the 52wk high/low list in IBD to see who's
moving, and setting up a new base. www.finviz.com is another free site that has
an excellent screening tool for finding the movers.

I looked at your stocks you mentioned, but none of them currently fit my
criteria for a buy. Keep up the good work, and kudos again on a nice 47%
gain!!!

Paul,
What do you think about PNCL? Pinnacle corp.
I bought them at 8$, at 1$ and finally managed to loose some money:) The risk
there was that 85% of their business came from NorthWest and they got bought by
Delta. Most people thought that Delta will drop their contract, but they did
not. There is good return on equity net income 41 mil / equity ~80 mil. They
are selling at 4.5 at the moment.

Good Luck,
Georgi

Gulf Resources Provides Clarification on Financing Timeline

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Gulf-Resources-Provides-prnews-3714659657.html?x=
&.v=101

The company has decided not to raise capital in 2010. This is very good news in
my opinion. It is a wise business decision, and it further strengthens my
belief the company is legitimate. I am not 100% confident in this belief (or in
my ability to evaluate Chinese stocks), otherwise I would be loading up.

Nevertheless, I bought some shares this morning.

I looked at my brokerage account that contained my TTT shares and found that I
still have an equal number of TTT rights shares which I already exercised
before the deadline for acquiring common shares at 6.50/s. The rights shares
are now valued at 0.294/s. I read somewhere that the rights options have been
oversubscribed. Would you know where and what percentage of the common will be
allocated to shareholders? TIA

Paul, if you take out the goodwill and intangibles of Hawaiian, there isn't any
equity left. Curious to hear your response.

PNCL. As I remember, I didn't like that they were so closely tied to Delta,
because I believed they'd be hurt if Delta squeezed them at contract time. I
passed on Skywest too.

Looking for a minute now, I see PNCL with high debt to equity. I don't see
anything interesting as regards their business. Whereas for HI, I believe I see
where they might grow. ALGT is my favorite for its business model which is
unique in the industry and which seems to be working okay for them.

Jmo, and I've been wrong plenty of times on this industry.

HA. Yes, I hadn't seen that. Goodwill and intangibles are only about 18% of
assets, enough though to wipe out book value if they're subtracted from asset
base.

Doesn't affect my reason for buying the stock though, and if it ought to be a
significant factor, I don't see it.

TTT,

They have been slow to process the offering. If you subscribed in the regular
subscription (4 rights = 1 share), you will get all your shares. Who knows
when, though.

If you signed up for oversubscription, you will likely get very few extra
shares. Playing it like a lottery ticket, I bought a lot of rights and signed
up for a ton of oversubscription (going on margin). Now, knowing I won't get
much oversubscription, I would like to get my money back so I won't be charged
any more margin interest. This violates my rule of not going on margin with
these stocks, but it was a special situation and I figured the cost of the
margin was like the cost of a lottery ticket.

Feel free to call and complain to the company, as I would like them to process
this quicker.

>>1. New management - how can you evaluate the goodness or badness of
management? I never could and I think 99% of the people can't

>*You can evaluate this partly by looking at the management's track record
(acquisition, growth, other capital allocation decisions) in the past. Perhaps
the new CEO was previously successful and is making drastic changes...and the
results are becoming positive.

Maybe you can. Buffett presumably can. I can't. :) (Well, I made a good call on
Aubrey, but then Aubrey is one-of-a-kind character... :P)

>>2. Share buy-backs - it's somewhat OK, but IMHO it's never a deciding factor.
Share dilution is bad though. Share buybacks at inflated price are common, bad,
but almost unavoidable in Buffettology businesses (KO, PEP, etc.)

>*That's why you see past track record of share buy-backs and determine if
current buyback price is reasonable.

Nah. I don't like information where I have to micro-decide. Is 0.5% buyback at
10% overvaluation OK, while 1% buyback at 15% overvaluation a signal to bail?
Is not buying back shares a deal breaker? Like Buffett said, I'd rather be
approximately right than precisely wrong. If the company is good, I don't care
if they buy back or not buy back. I don't even care if they overpay for
buybacks. If a company is lousy, even best buy backs won't save it.

.....

>>5. Change in corporate strategy - see comment on new management.

>*Company may jump unprofitable divisions, boosting the bottom line.

Still see the comment on management. :)

>>6. Activist investors - if company needs activist investors, it's an avoid
for me. Most of the time.

>*Activist investors such can enforce good capital allocation decisions and
force the company to avoid making bad ones.

If the company needs activist investors to enforce good capital allocation
decisions, the company is lousy by definition and not a buy. Yeah, you may make
lots of money on the coattails of activist investors. You can also lose lot's
of money. I don't invest in such situations.

>>7. M&A activity - Don't invest in a company expecting M&A, it may never
happen.

>*A purchase of a more profitable business can boost profits, a sale of
unrelated division may allow the company to focus on core business, etc....

Maybe. Let's get back to concrete examples. IMHO, most of the things above are
pretty rare (and mostly not exploitable by me) and I cannot build a portfolio
on pretty rare. :)

>>1. Industry consolidation - see note on M&A. how do you evaluate if this is
good/bad?

>*Fewer competitor's = higher margins

Grossly oversimplified. What about new entrants? What about industry that is
dying (newspapers)? 10 companies in an industry can have as brutal price war as
25. See HDD or airline industries couple years back even after consolidation.

>>2. Cyclicality - don't buy cyclicals or have cyclical-specific investment
approach.

>*Mr. Market often overreacts to negativity, pushing some cyclicals to
ridiculous valuations

IMHO, cyclicals are pure fantasy. People think that there is an easy
determination of business cycle. But there isn't anymore. Last two recessions
were not regular economic cycles but rather a sector-based collapses - first
tech then RE/financials. So there is no way to say that autos are cyclical or
steel is cyclical, since the next recession may not affect autos at all. Are
commodities cyclical? Not really either. Yeah, oil went to $35 in 2008, but
show me oil's previous cycle or predict the next one... ;)

i know, my oversubcription has not been processed yet either. probably has more
to do with the transfer agent than the company is my guess. pretty sure they
will want to get that straightend out before 9/23/10 if that is any
consolation.

My biggest positions now are:
