Portfolio Changes in the last couple of weeks:

I sold some MSFT on its run, taking a large 8% portfolio position down to about
2-3%. I still want to hold MSFT for the long-term.

I've been building a position in SVU so that now I have a 5% position.

I also bought some DKA which is an ETF aimed at international oil producers
(TOT, E, Russia, China, etc...). I tend to use ETF's for my international plays
these days.

I sold my SD on the run-up. I just bought this company a month ago, but when a
stock goes up 20%+ in a month, I tend to take my quick profits.

I bought some more of my long-time small copper mine play TGB. P/E of around 8
now. Has had some hard-times recently as it's Gold Mine Prosperity was not
approved by Canada, but I feel that it should do well with Copper around $4.10
now. Also, bought shares at 4.94 and sold a $5 May 'll Covered Call for 0.70. I
think that provides a good risk/reward setup.

Thanks,

What a boring and overvalued market. I have not done any trades for almost 10
days which I think is a multi year lull for me in terms of activity.

The overall market looks very richly valued with substantial bubble in Momo
stocks, REITs, MLPs, small cap crap and selected industrials. in fact looking
into those classes, the market multiple is higher than it was in 2007.

The problem is that this high multiple does not pay investors for the high
(imo) risk that things will become unhinged again, this time related to public
debt, which has replaced private debt.

I do see some value in Japan (most 2nd tier stocks) and some utilities and some
regional bank stocks (the latter will benefit from a lot of acquisition
activity in 2011) and maybe some oversold defense.I'll try to avoid further
sales this year but I am 35% cash and and have hedged some longs with short
positions.

interesting that you say that, many value investors continue to believe that
their shares are pretty cheap. Barrons has an article about savings banks being
unusually cheap and sallie mae as well, but when i researched sallie mae it
seems to be full of risk and questionable management decisions. one of the most
interesting comments i read was from someone who pointed out that sallie mae
really cleans up when a student defaults on a govt guraranteed loan because
then sallie mae collects 100% on the guaranty and then turns into a collection
agent getting as much as 1/3 of the funds eventually collected from the
defaulting student. if this is true i would certainly be leery of sallie mae
servicing my student loan. as an investor the 50-1 leverage is pretty alarming.
On top of that I read that over 9% of their private student loans are in
default now. if there were secured bonds though that would be another matter.

The macro events continue to be interesting, I wish i understood the mechanism
for expanding euro money supply better. its funny to see all those heads of
state posing for pictures, smiling , when they are facing such serious problems
between debt crisis, austerity programs, and civil unrest. I predict that
monetary expansion will continue in 2011 and that should be good overall for
the stock market and commodities as stores of value. I also wonder what the
ramifications will be of china being upset with the united states and bernanke
for their monetary policy which is contributing to the increase in commodity
prices which china abhors. When you say cash> what exactly do you mean?

Re: The Market

Yeah, some stocks are getting frothy, I agree. But, I guess I'm not feeling
like there aren't value plays still out there as I'm still finding value in
Large Caps mostly in Energy and Tech. But, other than that, I agree. And even
in these large caps, I don't have over 10 that I'm really confident of right
now.

I'm not finding value in many other places, hence my move to trying to buy
companies with good premiums on calls to start a covered call position with
good risk rewards. At this point, I'm thinking that's a better play than to
continue to stretch into questionable 'value' stocks and/or to just keep
pushing a lot of money into the few value stocks I'm confident in and create a

My concern is that the cracks in the bond market start to widen, there is the
muni crash, the Euro troubles and finally some concerns about the sovereign AAA
rating for the US. I think the bond market is the biggest bubble there is and
certain asset classes that are anchored buy bone valuations (MLPs, REITS etc.)
and have soared as well could go bust.

The FED is extremely long bonds (through all the interventions, QE1, QE2...)
and could sustain extremely high market to market losses if bonds falter. If
this matters, I have a hard time telling but I don't see that we get paid for
all this risk. The fact that almost nobody seems to care about this does not
make the market less risky, imo.

I agree that energy, large cap high tech and some regional banks are still good

The problem is that you and most bears like Hussman forget that we are on year
two of the expansion cycle after the "great" recession. If this is going to be
regular recovery - of course bears will say "No way!" - the economy is going to
continue growing, the unemployment will start to shrink and the corporate
results will continue to be great with no wage inflation in sight. On a normal
recovery, economy can run up for another 2-4 years and stock market can follow.
If this happens, the bond market issues will not derail the stock market.

Now, you may be right, this may not be "regular" recovery, US could double dip,
Europe could fold, China might hard stop, Russia might blow up, Iran and North
Korea could nuke somebody, etc. Then, definitely we'd be in trouble.

I disagree about market being overvalued. If you look at the mega caps that are
major part of market-weighted indexes, they are all still pretty cheap. It's
your XOMs, JNJs, KOs, MSFTs, BACs, WMTs, etc. Calling market overvalued due to
MLP and REIT rise is rather inaccurate when both these categories are probably
less than couple percent of the market. Same applies to couple momo stocks.

Hussman's afraid that cyclicals are expensive on what he presumes to be the top
of the cycle earnings this year. Apparently he believes that this business
cycle will fold in only two years of economic expansion. Possible, but this has
not happened often.

On the other hand, I understand your situation. I'm myself in a classical value
investor's bind, where everything has moved up and I don't want to chase the
buys up. So I sold some stuff and I did not redeploy the cash. I still have a
long list of names that are perfectly cheap good buys, but I just hate to pay
couple percent more than half year ago. ;) And I say to myself: "Yeah, we gonna
have the repeat of this summer's drop and then I'm gonna buy". But really, we
may or we may not. Impossible to say. ;)

Matt, rather than shorting VALE, which owns large deposits of iron ore that
count amongst the lowest cost sources in the world, I would rather short steel
companies, in particular those that are expensive and don't have a moat, like
Posco does. X looks to me like a perfect example that operates with relatively
high costs, trades at 4X tangible book and has shown huge losses in 2009 and
2010. Apparently it is part of all the material indices and ETF and get lifted
up no matter the fundamentals. Well that is at least as I see it.

Coal and iron ore are the ingredients to make steel. Control of Low cost
resources of either one constitute a moat. High cost steel producers like X
have no moat, but are valued as if they had one. Those are a better short if
things turn down from here.

I view X differently.

Currently (but not in the future, according to the company), US Steel is 80%
self-sufficient in coke. It also owns iron ore mines. Therefore, X has an
advantage in material costs over some competitors who do not have their own
captive sources for raw materials. X may "operate with relatively high costs",
but that imo is due to X's high labor costs.

X trades now at about 3x tangible book value (per SI financials and S&P
numbers), and has had a loss year in '09.

It's certainly possible X could be a short "if things turn down from here". I
can't put a probability number to it though. Nor can I put a probability number
on the stock doing better if the US economy does better. In recent times
though, when things were better, X stock has been up there. That is, while the
stock now is @$59, 30 months ago it was up at $180.

Imo, with these price swings, this is a stock whose shorting, if any, should be
left to professionals.

I've owned a few shares since 7/'09 with an occasional few share add. I'm not
saying US Steel is a buy or recommending it as a buy now. I own a few shares,
am aware that many if not most steel stocks have participated in the current
market rally, and am betting on further upside move.

re X - interesting view. I was surprised to see that X made ~18$share in 2008.
the question is if they can repeat that feat, and of course it is not
sustainable to begin with.

X is in fact self sufficient in terms of US iron ore but they mention that
their coking facilities reach the end of the life. Besides that, coking is just
a processing step for metallurgic coal and does not protect from rising coal
prices.

They need to pay in between 600-800M$/year into their benefit plans (health
care, pensions etc.). These do not seem to run through the income statement but
are a reason why so little of the earnings accrue to the shareholder.

They also paid a top price in 2007 for Lone Star (tubular products).

Maybe it's not a short but it sure does not look like a long either.

Thanks for the reply, my thing is if china stops buying (2/3rds of vales iron
ore goes to china) vale will have no where to ship the bulk of there iron ore
no matter how cheap they produce it. I think people are missing the
overvaluation of vale. They are becoming a shipping and logistics company,
undergoing a very aggressive ship building program that will leave them the
largest private ship fleet in the world, not JUST a low cost producer of iron
ore. Best case scenarios on some estimates already has them losing money on
spot rates in good times (though I take alot of numbers estimates with a grain
of salt) It seems very risk for me even if china property doesn't go bust.

There is alot more interesting things about vale like financing there ships
with Chinese financing, and not very upfront about a whole host of other issues
that they want kept secret, why I don't know.

They have assets in the ground and according to the Barron's article I posted,

I may consider some covered calls but I would like to see a run in the stock

but go out at least six months. I am tracking the July $60's and would like to

What's your target on Corning Inc. (GLW)? I own a lot of this that I bought in
2002 in the $5.25/share price area. I have been peeling off shares above
$25.00/share and think we could see another run towards $30.00/share by the

CNX. Yeah, not so easy a decison, imo. If you value the company on earnings,
then yes, p/e is high-side at 107% of average p/e over the last five years.
Seems to be one of these companies where market doesn't trust sustainability of
earnings: when earnings are down, p/e's are up. And when earnings are up,
market accords them lower p/e's.

If you value the company on its assets though, then you might conclude the
company is undervalued at current price. I look at it that way, and I'm holding

Hello EKS,

I had a few minutes here and wanted to do a comparative analysis of SVU from an
EV perspective. I think what makes SVU look really cheap is that it has such a
small equity portion compared to debt. So, I wanted to do an analysis (from
Yahoo) of Enterprise Value ratios to Sales and EBITDA. Here's what I get:

EV/SALES EV/EBITDA
SVU 0.24 4.24
SWY 0.31 5.13
KR 0.25 5.47
WMT 0.57 7.24
COST 0.36 9.83
TGT 0.86 7.97

So, SVU is still the cheapest on both metrics, but I don't know if it's really
trading on potential bankruptcy risk. That being said, if the EV/EBITDA bounces
up to the 5 or 6 level, that's a solid return on the common equity. Especially
if debt is being paid down on the way to that ratio value returning. I have a
solid position in SVU, and I'm at least telling myself I'm not adding unless it
goes down more.

Hi Grantcw

The key IMO on SVU is if sales have indeed bottomed. The company is paying down
it's debt faster than any of the other companies you listed. They are able to
accomplish this from their cash flow. As a result, stock holder's equity is
growing much faster.

It also looks like SVU is able to maintain their current sales margins
(operating margins are now around 3%). SWY had to cut their margins earlier
this year (ie lower prices) just to maintain their previous sales level.
Hopefully, SVU did not have to do this. SVU does have some play in their
margins w/o killing their free flow cash. It's a balancing act and it really
all hinges on where we are in the cycle and if the sales slump has bottomed.

My one best play for 2011 is SVU. I would like to load up on more shares but
would like to see some discussion from management about company Q4 sales (did
we see their sales bottom in Q3) and if there are plans to refinance some of
their debt especially the $1B coming due in 2016. It may be too late to get
cheap shares once any positive news hits the streets. If it is bad news then
you may not want any more shares.

SuperValu: Earnings Play With Compelling Risk/Reward Ratio
http://seekingalpha.com/article/242718-supervalu-earnings-play-with-compelling-
isk-reward-ratio

From the article:"...SVU is past due for an upside surprise, and this time
around it might just pull one off. My “shot in the dark” on this one is
earnings of 33 cents on sales of $8.76 billion. If this occurs, the shares
could rise an immediate 10-20%. Also, the fact that its short interest has
approached historic highs (16% of its outstanding shares) means “fuel to the
fire” could be added as fast and furious short covering becomes plausible.,,,"

You might want to add Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFMI) to your company
comparative list. Their EV/Sales is 4x that of SVU and are able to maintain 5%
operating margins. SVU would be selling at $18.00/share - $20.00/share if it
was priced like WFMI.

What's your strategy if they surprise to the upside?

Hello EKS,

Good points about SVU.

Yes, WFMI is definitely a pricey one on those metrics. But, a better comparison
from a business standpoint than companies like Walmart and Target, which I
threw in there. Good food for thought. Personally, as a value investor, I'd
rather be in SVU with it's large # of save-a-lot's than the higher-end Whole
Foods, but I think maybe that's because I'm more on the frugal end in real
life. :) I imagine there are non-frugal value investors out there.

I guess my strategy is that I'm hoping that the valuation metrics listed don't
get worse for SVU. If EV/EBITDA is 4.24, I hope the market at the very least
continues to give it this valuation, if not better.

Then, as SVU pays off debt with cash flow, the common will hopefully increase
directly with the payoff. And I like the fact that the common market cap is
under $2 billion now, but they're paying off over $0.5 billion this year.
That's a decent gain right there if that payoff goes right to the common. Add
to that the fact that SVU may get a valuation metric bump as the debt is paid
off, and we're looking at a good risk/reward.

To your question, I have a big enough position in SVU that if for whatever
reason it bumped 20%+ over 10, I'd probably sell some shares into a run. I
don't expect it too though.

Good point. SVU has Jewel stores in my area, and they are also on the expensive

variety of stores across the price ranges and therefore will hopefully be able
to figure out what brand mix is the best for profitability and go with that
strategy. So, good point that SVU is not a discount grocer overall, but I'd

Supervalu partnered with CVS Corp. and an investment group led by Cerberus
Capital Management for the Albertson’s deal, taking on about $6 billion in debt
as part of the transaction.

Supervalu’s acquisition of its larger rival gave it more than 2,600 stores
across the country. Besides its name sake, Albertson’s also operated Acme
Markets, Bristol Farms, Star Markets and Jewel-Osco.

But the financial crisis hit supermarkets hard, and a slow economy and intense
price competition continue to plague grocery store chains. Supervalu has also
been struggling with its debt load. Moody’s recently cut its rating on
Supervalu further into junk territory. Wall Street has called for Supervalu to
shed assets to pay down some of its debt.

The grocery store chain has been selling off parts of the company throughout
the year. In February, it sold 16 Shaw’s stores in Connecticut, but there are
still more than 175 stores in New England. Some analysts have valued the
chain’s assets at about $1 billion.

And in October, Supervalu announced the sale of its Bristol Farms division to a
company formed by Bristol Farms management and private-equity firm Endeavour
Capital. Bristol Farms is a grocery store chain that markets itself as being
“upscale”, with thirteen stores located mainly in the Southern California
market.

Last year, Supervalu said it was selling 36 Albertsons stores in Utah to
Associated Food stores.

With a market capitalization of $1.85 billion, a size that’s in the sweet spot
for dealmakers, Supervalu itself has been the subject of takeover rumors.

Question - Has takeover rumors done anything to SVU so far?

Massey Board Weighs Future

http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703886904576032001891175130.html

From the article:"...Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross could end up playing a
pivotal role in Massey's fate. He is chairman and the second-biggest
shareholder of ICG, which itself controls about 325 million tons of
metallurgical coal reserves, and an outside director at ArcelorMittal.

Mr. Ross declined to comment on ICG's interest in Massey, citing a company
policy against commenting on rumored merger activity. "I do believe as a
general matter that there will continue to be a strong trend toward acquisition
of natural resource companies by their competitors by their customers and by
financial investors," he said....".

==================================================================

CNX is sitting on a lot of similar coal reserves and are looking for a JV
partner to help develop these fields. They also are diversified w/ their recent
NG purchase from Dominion Resources, Inc. (D). CNX up again as the market
raises price expectations for U.S. coal reserves.

Fidelity provides 2 options for purchasing Canadian stocks.
1. You can buy the pink sheet symbol. They seem to be keeping the symbol prices
up to date much better now. Used to be, you'd have to ask for a current price.
You get a bid ask that sometimes has a sizable spread, it's quoted in US $.
This is what most US investors have typically done for quite some time.
The commission for me has been the same as buying US stocks. I just bought some
AABVF (AAB.TO) and paid 7.95 commission.
I still buy most of my canadian stocks this way.

2. You can set your non-IRA account up to trade international shares. In that
case you can buy directly on canadian exchange in CAD $ and indicate the
settlement currency you want to use to make the purchase (free US$ or free
CAD$). When you sell, you do the same - you can sell and settle in CAD$ leaving
you money in CAD$ rather than converting back to US$.
There is a small amount of spread or margin taken to convert $ back and forth.
The commission for one of these international trades is more - the last one I
did was $19.00 for about a 3K purchase.

If you look at how they charge, I think it works out fairly close to the same
costs either way, although I haven't really put the pencil to it. I should do
that just to make sure.
With the pink listings I have a smaller commission, but may pay a little more
to hit the ask. No US/CAD currency conversions.
With the international trade, I may pay a currency conversion fee if I don't
have CAD $ free for trading and I pay a higher commission. I may get a better
ask however.

Hope that helps you Madharry.

re Muni bonds - a 9% discount for a closed end muni bond is nothing special. I
remember seeing 10-15% discounts on bonds and muni bonds funds a few years ago
on and off. That was before the credit crisis when we had discounts of 20%+ on
top of the NAV losses.

A 9% discount is nothing special in particular since I don't even like the
underlying bonds that much. It was only during the recent bond bubble that the
closed end bond and muni funds were close to NAV, history tells me that a 10%
discount to NAV is the rule, rather than an aberration.

Well - Bill always likes Bonds. I am not sure it means much. I agree that many
muni bonds look oversold and may be a good bounce play. I don't see them as a
value per say.

MCA has basically 5% bonds with maturities from 8-20+ years in them. A 35%
leverage at current near zero % interest rates boost the yield to 7%. the
leverage boost the yield but also leads to losses when there is a selloff in
the underlying bonds, because the limitations of the leverage ratio will force
(partial) liquidations. Over time, this leads to losses of principle and you
can tell, because the Fund was started with a 15$ NAV (now 12.6$). So over long
periods of time, you will get somewhat less than 7% return on investment, in
particular if Short term interest rates rise and financing get's more
expensive.

The question is now if a 7% return is really enough to justify the risks. the
biggest risk is really a rise in interest rates which will severally reduce the
NAV of the long bonds, amplified by the leverage. Well that is your call to
make.

MA

I don't remember if I shared this before:

Randolph McDuff
May 9, 2010
Mastercard (nyse: MA, $223.09). Priced by Fear, Rather Than Success

MA shares outstanding: 131 million.
MA net liabilities (as of 03/30/2010): $1.34 billion.

MA enterprise value: $30.8 billion.

MA 2010 est. EBITDA: $2.8 billion.
MA 2011 est. EBITDA: $3.3 billion.

Est. 2010 closing EV/EBITDA ratio: 10.5X
Est. 2011 closing EV/EBITDA ratio: 8.5X

Mastercard's global growth rates seem to be unappreciated by North American
investors.

Q1, 2010 revenues came in a $1.31 billion, up by 13.1%. This surpassed the
highest view of $1.28 billion for Q1 and the analyst consensus of $1.27
billion. Earnings came in at $3.46 US per share, ABOVE the highest view of
$3.40, ABOVE the whisper number of $3.35 per share and 10% above the consensus
estimates of $3.14 per share for the quarter.

EBITDA in the quarter was $735 million, or 55.8% of net revenues, a record
since inception. Net liabilities fell by $568 million in the quarter.

click here to download the company's press release

click here to see the transcript of the company's earnings call

Mastercard has little respect from a "US centric" North American analyst
community.

Mastercard became a publicly traded company in May 2006. At year-end 2005, the
firm reported total revenues of $2.937 billion and EBITDA of $592.4 million, a
margin of 20.1%.

At the end of fiscal 2010, Mastercard revenues may exceed $5.75 billion, with
EBITDA surpassing $2.8 billion, a margin of 48.7%. Should this be proven
correct, on an absolute basis, EBITDA will grow by approximately 472%, on
revenue gains of 96%, during a five year period.

EBITDA increases of this magnitude occur at companies with largely fixed costs.
Mastercard has proven an ability to keep costs in check throughout the past
five years, while expanding revenue at a 14.5% compounded annual clip.

Despite a share price gain of more than 540% since issue, Mastercard is selling
for roughly the same forward relative valuation, as in 2006. EBITDA growth has
risen, virtually lock-step, with share price appreciation. The balance sheet
improvements are equally notable. At the end of 2010, Mastercard's balance
sheet will have moved from a position of net liabilities, in the range of $2
billion, to what looks to be a totally debt free position and a modest net cash
balance. 4 million outstanding shares will have been retired through share
repurchase since IPO.

Subsequent to IPOissue, MA has beaten analyst views on revenues and earnings
EACH and EVERY quarter, sometimes by amounts sufficiently high, so as to call
into question, the modelling systems adopted by various analysts. Q1 2010
proved, yet again, that analysts do not seem to be able to accurately compile
various components of the international revenue streams. Visa, the larger
competitor, did not beat consensus expectations on revenues and earnings by
analysts. This represents a paradox for analysts. One can easily and logically
conclude a confirmation bias exists in favour of Visa, and against Mastercard.

Mastercard is a larger issuer of credit cards than debit cards. Analysts are
bullish on the outlook for debit, less so for credit. Mastercard's historic
emphasis on credit, rather than debit, represents another point of contention
with analysts. Many are of the opinion that Mastercard will not be able to
fully participate in a secular trend towards debit.

Analysts and individual investors alike often report that Visa is more than 2X
the size of Mastercard in the US, and extrapolate this market share on a global
basis. Such a view represents a fallacy. Globally, Mastercard's business is
roughly 67% the size of Visa.

Mastercard derives more than 55% of revenues outside of the United States, and
has key strengths in emerging markets such as Brazil, Asia and Mexico. 66% of
the total number of cards, carrying the various Mastercard brands, are outside
of the United States. 60% of gross dollar volumes (GDV) processed by Mastercard
are generated outside of the United States.

http://phx.corporateir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MjY5NTMzOHxDaGlsZElEP
M2ODM5MHxUeXBlPTI=&t=1

The Asia Pacific region is Mastercard's fastest growing market. In Q1, 2010,
GDV in this region represented 22% of total volumes, up by 20.9% year over
year. In 2009, Asia Pacific GDV represented 18.7% of the total.

http://phx.corporateir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9Mjk3NzAyOXxDaGlsZElEP
M4MDQxNHxUeXBlPTI=&t=1

Latin America GDV accounts for 7.8% of Mastercard's total. A year ago, Latin
American GDV was 6.7% of the total.

In aggregate, Asia and Latin America are Mastercard's second largest overall
market, ahead of Europe and behind the US. Should present trends continue, by
mid- 2011, Asia and Latin America will become Mastercard's largest market, as
measured by GDV.

While Visa and Mastercard represent a de-facto duopoly in global credit/debit,
there is a substantial difference in valuation, between the two firms.

Visa (V-NYSE, $83) has 737 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis
and currently has net liabilities of $3.52 billion. This represents an
enterprise value of $64.9 billion. Visa should report 2010 EBITDA of $4.7
billion. Visa has currently made a dilutive purchase (Cybersource) to be
completed later this year; total liabilities should remain unchanged through
the 2010. Visa's 2010 year end EV/EBITDA looks to be in the range of 13.9X.

Mastercard has a current enterprise value of $30.8 billion and should report
2010 EBITDA in the range of $2.8 billion. The year-end EV/EBITDA ratio looks to
be 10.5X.

Mastercard generates less than 67% the revenue of Visa and produces 62% of
Visa's EBITDA. As an offset, Mastercard sells for roughly 44.6% of Visa's 2010
year end EV/EBITDA ratio.

Both Mastercard and Visa are well positioned to capture the secular global move
to a cashless society.

As processors, Mastercard and Visa remain immunized from direct credit risk.
They generate revenues from license fees, cross border assessments and a modest
percentage of the interchange fee charged to merchants who rely on their global
payment systems.

There has been periodic upheaval in the share price of Mastercard throughout
the years 2008-2010. At first, criticism was levied regarding the earnings
reliability throughout the global slowdown in 2008-2009. Such fears of earnings
compression proved to be wholly unfounded.

In the case of Mastercard, revenues have grown by a solid 25.3% from 2007 to
year-end 2009. Processed transactions were up 19.5% over the same period.
Operating expenses have not changed significantly in the last several years.
Almost all of the increase in revenues fell directly to EBITDA, and
subsequently to the bottom line.

Capital expenditures to support and grow the Mastercard network have
approximated $162 million per annum, for the last 3 years. This is
approximately 3% of annual revenues.

The initial fixed costs of setting up competing businesses are extremely high,
which is a key barrier to entry. Fees paid to processors are miniscule on a per
transaction basis. Economies of scale are therefore almost impossible to
achieve for new entrants to the business, which represents the other barrier to
entry. For these reasons, I do not own the smaller processors, which include
American Express and Discover. Visa and Mastercard produce some of the highest
non-cyclical profit margins on the planet. With fixed costs in check and
rapidly declining interest charges, future revenue gains may produce
disproportionately high bottom line profits. Frankly, they both operate
terrific businesses that are virtually impossible to replicate, in scope and
scale.

Two banks are attempting to set up a credit and debit processing partnership in
Brazil, which will report start up assets in the range of $8.5 billion, before
adding in debts. The partnership hopes to generate roughly $600 million of
total profits in the next five years, ($120 million per year), a modest 1.4%
annual return on invested capital. Such a start-up cost certainly reinforces
the current value of highly profitable businesses operated by Visa and
Mastercard.

Visa is certainly more advanced in the debit card market.

US consumers completed more debit transactions than credit transactions in
2009. Analysts reported this as a tipping point. Whether or not the emphasis on
the use of debit vs credit can be considered a permanent trend remains to be
seen. It is my contention that at least a portion of the debit increase in the
US, and to a lesser extent Canada, is largely cyclical. Should the US economic
recovery continue, it is my belief that credit trends will revert to the norm.
Debit usage will continue to increase, but credit could recover very quickly.

Globally at Visa, debit card use accounted for approximately 57% of gross
dollar volume

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Visa-Inc-Posts-Strong-Fiscal-prnews-1476842592.ht
l?x=0&.v=1

Mastercard's perceived current weakness in US markets are not nessarily
reflective of a global trend.

Insofar as debit is concerned, Mastercard's international operations
represented 17% of gross dollar volumes for Q1. Total debit (including US)
represented 33.7% of gross dollar volumes for the quarter. As with Visa,
Mastercard also reported US that debit usage surpassed the use of credit in Q1,
2010.

Internationally, Mastercard reported debit volumes were up by 33.2% in Q1. On
an absolute basis, Mastercard debit is smaller both domestically and globally,
than Visa. However, Mastercard's growth rates in debit are quite comparable to
that of Visa.

http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MzgwNDA5fENoaWxkSUQ9
zgwMzc1fFR5cGU9MQ==&t=1

Recent criticisms impacting Mastercard's share price, as well as that of Visa,
reflect the possibility of interchange fees moving towards a regulated
structure, in the US.

Retailers continue to try to have US congress cap the interchange fees. The
implication put forth by mainstream media is that the lobby group of Visa and
Mastercard is weaker than the lobby groups of retailers, and will therefore
lose out in some sort of regulatory end run.

http://www.reuters.com/article/idCNN0511837420100505?rpc=44

http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d1045.pdf

What media outlets fail to take into account, is that a full 85% of interchange
assessments go to the member banks of the credit and debit card systems. Almost
$40 billion of total interchange fees were paid to the issuing banks in 2009.
Retailers are really fighting banks. Mastercard and Visa, as partners with the
banks, are certainly exposed, but represent more peripheral players.

Banks and financial services presently account for more than 2X the amount of
US GDP, when compared to retailers. Banks are an incredibly powerful lobby
group (some argue too powerful) and will neither willingly give up either
current fees, nor will they give away potential fee growth, without a fight.
Both banks, V and MA argue that assessments are made against merchants, not
consumers; the issue in their mind is one of "business to business" and need
not be regulated.

http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704905704574622722184163510.html

In a worst case scenario for Visa and Mastercard, any potential cap on
interchange fees could, in all likelihood, simply be replaced by a new type of
fee which would be levied, so as to offset interchange caps. Such a fee could
be similar to the dreaded "system access fees" consumers pay for mobile cell
services in certain parts of the world.

What businesses are doing, essentially, is attempting to shift the burden of
the interchange payments off of their backs, and directly to the backs of
consumers. There is no free lunch. Consumers are already indirectly paying the
interchange fees; merchants build into merchandise selling prices an amount
equal or greater than, the current assessments. In the event that interchange
fees are capped or reduced, it is highly doubtful that merchants will then
reduce product prices by an amount equal to interchange fee reductions. What is
attempting to be accomplished, is simply a lateral transfer of profit away from
card issuers to merchants.

Since the earnings report of May 4th, 2010. Mastercard shares have fallen by
12.1%, far greater than the average decline of US equity markets as a whole.

Visa shares have also fallen by approximately 12.5% since the release of their
last quarterly financial report. It would appear that a portion of the pullback
may be attributable to the potential for some regulatory fee cap being imposed
at a congressional level. Whether or not this comes to pass, or whether it will
have an impact on the business remains to be seen. Interchange fees are now
regulated in Australia; according to financial reports ay Visa and Mastercard,
no material challenges to the business model or profitability in that market
occurred. Many of Mastercard's primary markets already carry higher degrees of
regulation than the US. With a larger US business, Visa will be potentially
impacted to a greater degree than Mastercard, should punitive regulations go
into effect.

Investment markets have generally been weakened by a key national issue coming
from Europe.

The current risks of a default in the national debts of Greece are cause for
concern but are possibly very overblown. Greece is not a substantial economic
power. With a population of just 10.8 million persons, Greece is the 34th
largest economy on the globe, but is the 17th largest external debtor. It is a
government heavy nation; more than 40% of GDP comes from public sector
employment. Some government employees are paid bonuses simply for showing up to
work on time. Direct EU aid represents about 3.3% of Greek GDP per annum. GDP
is about 2/3 per capita that of leading Eurozone nations. National tax policies
are lax, collections are uneven and the cash economy is rampant.

https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html

Through direct subsidy, Greece has been effectively "propped up" by EU aid for
many years now, and will continue to be afforded substantial aid in the future.

A country of 10.7 million people is simply is too small to have meaningful
negative impacts upon forecast global growth. However, investors are now
becoming preoccupied with a fear that Greek "contagion" will spread to other
nations in the EU. Three nations have come under increased scrutiny of late,
Spain, Portugal and Italy.

Spain has a 20% official unemployment rate, to be sure. This is not a new
phenomenon; in fact Spanish unemployment rates have been structurally high for
more than 20 years.

http://www.allbusiness.com/public-administration/national-security-internationa
/524124-1.html

High unemployment rates in Spain are a more or less permanent paradox. Many of
the officially unemployed in Spain are actually "double dipping"; they generate
tax free cash incomes in Spain's large underground economy, while
simultaneously obtaining tax assisted government benefits, or "Paro". It is
widely assumed that the black market economy now equals 25% of reported Spanish
GDP per year.

Portugal has a more diversified economy, a lower budget deficit and workers
willing and able to be work for wages roughly 2/3 that of Greeks. Spain, Italy
and Portugal are less dependent upon EU aid, and are not in the same leaky boat
as Greece.

Italy has the largest black market, or "shadow" economy in all of Europe.

http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=1262

In my view, the risks of a Greek domestic capital crisis spreading throughout
the rest of Europe are as likely today, as was the likelihood of the swine flu
becoming a true pandemic last year; not likely. However, a common underlying
thread of Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece is the absolute size of their
underground cash economies. Reform is required to "out" these substantial
shadow economies, so that tax revenues can be paid. Some external shock is
required to affect the changes, as their domestic governments refuse to do so.
Hopefully, this is presently underway.

A greater blow to the credibility of North American markets recently came about
from the VERY recent disclosure of Goldman Sachs discussing an SEC settlement
on their mortgage securitization issuance activities.

Such a settlement, if reached, will confirm long held suspicions by investors
at large that we operate at a considerable disadvantage to a select number of
financial institutions.

It is equally important to note that true financial reform cannot occur, when
those who are supposedly overseeing the financial firms, find themselves in a
position to earn outsized financial benefits by trading on material non-public
information.

Key government officials have clearly demonstrated their abilities to drive
down the shares of Mastercard and Visa by more than 6%, over and above normal
market fluctuations. This was effectively accomplished simply through
discussing the placing of an addendum to a bill. Competing bank lobby groups
will now go to work on lawmakers. Nevertheless, negative media attention has
been generated. Unfortunately for investors holding securities other than Visa
and Mastercard, such negative government pronouncements for index stocks
created a ripple effect one that spilled over into other securities. So long as
officials are also in a personal position to sell shares short, without the
requirement of disclosure, their motivations for spreading rumour may certainly
be called into question. I estimate that more than $8.6 billion of the market
cap decline in Visa and Mastercard is directly attributable to potential
interchange proposal. Quis Custodiet ipsos custodes?

http://rightsoup.com/insider-trading-illegal-for-you-but-not-for-congress-hr-68
/

Trading volumes and selling pressures for Visa and Mastercard spiked VERY
dramatically for 2 days, immediately prior to the announcement that a
government official is considering adding an interchange fee amendment, to a
forthcoming bill.

Pundits may shortly discuss potential negative impacts of a spending slowdown
in the Mediterranean Eurozone nations.

Some have already concluded that Greece will fall into a period of economic
malaise that will require a decade or more to recover. More worry that Italy,
Spain and Portugal will soon follow suit. An inference might be made that
conclude Mastercard and Visa will experience sharp reductions in European
processing. This is unlikely.

What the mass media will inevitably fail to take into account, and what this
article has pointed out earlier, are that Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal
represent the four largest "cash" economies in the EU. Even should all four
nations fall into an economic recession, payment processing rates are likely to
be unaffected. Those who pay with cash don't generate a dime of revenue for V
and MA. Credit and debit volumes, according to Visa and Mastercard, in Q1,2010,
grew by rates significantly above that of the US. Most of this growth came from
the northern and central regions of Europe. Recent declines in the Euro will
make these nations, which are the key "producing" economies of Europe, even
more competitive going forward. In fact, there may be longer term unintended
benefits of PIGS (Portugal, Italy Greece and Spain) reform for V and MA. Any
substantial reforms in these cash economies will create more non-cash
processing, down the road.

Mastercard represents one part of a duopoly presently benefitting from one of
the planet's defining secular trends; a move from cash to electronic payments.

The business model of Mastercard and Visa proved itself out during a period of
below average global growth. At less than 10X my 2011 forward EV/EBITDA
estimate, shares of Mastercard now look to be about as cheap, on a forward
basis, as they were shortly after the IPO.

I feel that Mastercard has significant earnings leverage, should credit use
increase in a more broadly based economic recovery. The secular trend towards
increased debit use will continue; Mastercard seems well positioned to grow the
debit business as well.

After several years of holding shares of Mastercard, without either buying or
selling, RMG#1 has recently moved to add some shares of Mastercard to the
account.

At the current price, it is my view that Mastercard is presently valued as a
broken growth stock. Mastercard is the more international investment in the
card processing market, as compared to Visa. In about a year, Asian and Latin
American processing by Mastercard will surpass that of the US.

Mastercard's growth story, which never abated during the economic slowdown, is
likely to accelerate in the near to mid-term. Interchange fees improve for
Mastercard and Visa when average ticket size increases. Purchases on credit are
historically much higher than purchases on debit. Mastercard's revenue stream
is credit oriented. Only modest growth in the use of credit cards is necessary
in order to produce a material revenue "shock" to the top line.

By the end of 2010, even using my conservative determination of EV, Mastercard
should boast a net cash balance. Significant forecast net cash balances, in the
years to come, may be used to repurchase stock, raise the dividend and be
invested for organic growth.

Opportunities to invest in a strong, highly profitable and non-cyclical
company, for less than 9X 2011 EV/EBITDA, generally only present themselves
during bouts of fear. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down for the
year, as of the close of business on Friday, May 7th, 2010. Clearly, this
appears to be such a time.

Visa is also currently selling for a valuation well below its growth rates in
revenue, EBITDA and earnings. I consider the shares of Visa to be attractively
valued. Visa has recently increased their merchant assessment rates, to be
effective July, 2010. Q3, 2010 earnings for Visa could surprise to the upside.
I will seek to increase the RMG#1 position in Visa shortly.

On Friday, May 7th, 2010, I added to my personal position in Mastercard.

Hi Paul -

Re: Ultrapetrol (Bahamas) Ltd. (ULTR)

I noticed that too. The convertible bonds (total $70 million) were priced to
convert at $7.51/share and mature in 2017. The monies were going to be used to
pay for the two new service ships that get delivered next year. There was also
some rumors that a purchase in land for port & storage facility expansion in
their River Business. Cost of capital at 7.5% should provide a good return
considering the double digit growth in that segment of their business.

I was going to add more shares if it broke below $6.00/share. I was early
selling shares earlier this year at $5.60/share.

It's encouraging that management is still very positive on making more capital
investments.

I like CONN's (symbol CONN) a small (76 locations) competitor in retailing
electronics. It's selling at .33x book. Nobody likes them because they finance
2/3rds of what they sell and have a huge underperforming loan portfolio. Yuck!
But, they just got their banks to issue new debt extending maturities out,and
their long term largest shareholder, Stephens Group, just increased share
ownership by excercising rights and fully oversubscribing (I entered by buying
rights, excercising and oversubscribing). Management, while likely not great,
has displayed the ability to focus on desired metrics and bring them in on
target. Their underwriting got better beginning a year ago and these average
$1350 loans roll off pretty quickly (6 to 36 month financing). I think it's a
double in time with pretty limited downside.

Bill Gross put 4.4 million dollars of his personal money into municipals. From
my perspective, that says a great deal. To say that he always likes bonds is a
little narrow in focus. Sure, he runs a bond fund, but what is he buying with
his own money? There is a universe of bonds out there, so his purchase of munis
certainly defines a value proposition to me.

This bond fund charts back to 1993, so I would say that the share price has
been pretty stable. I'm willing to accept a 2.5 point loss in capital in 17
years.

You're right that the biggest risk in a rise in rates, and as I said
previously, I'm in the camp that short term rates aren't going anywhere soon.
The return--7% tax free--is enough for me to take that risk.

Re: Eagle Ford Shale

Penn Virginia Corp. (PVA)

Hi Paul - I have been going through your earlier post in October on the Eagle
Ford Shale plays. Penn Virginia Corp. (PVA) came up on that list and caught my
eye.

http://oilshalegas.com/eaglefordshale.html

The company has a lot of good producing assets but quite a bit of debt which
seems to have adequate coverage from their cash flow. One of their best
producing assets is their Natural Gas Midstream segment which provides natural
gas processing, gathering, and other related services. As of December 31, 2009,
it owned and operated 6 natural gas processing facilities; and approximately
4,118 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines in Oklahoma and Texas.

In August 2010 they bought 6,800 acres (@ $4,500/acre) in the Eagle Ford Shale
area. The acreage is contiguous to the company's existing acreage in the area.
The new acreage comprises at least forty locations that can be used for
horizontal drilling. The company said that the properties contain mostly oil.

The company seems like it is undervalued based on their market cap vs the
assets they own (and the revenue generated used to service their debt) when
compared to many of the other smaller E&O drillers in the area. I scanned
through about 10 of the other companies on the list w/ similar market caps and
they seem to be priced about 30% higher.

Any opinion on PVA? Did I miss something like a hidden liability or has the
market just overlooked this company? I have it on my watch list and am looking
at possibly starting a tracking position.

I bailed out of llen with a much smaller profit than i had before greenberg

final straw was the kabani certification letter attached to the fiscal '09

realize that the numbers from china could be anything and the auditors would be
off the hook.
that coupled with principals less than sterling reputation was enough to get me
scurrying for cover. The company could turn out to be great or a fraud I have
no idea and here I choose not to stick around. Prior to selling I called
investor relations but a
couple of days later and they have not returned my call about the accounting.

I dont know who authored this report it would be interesting to know. certainly
if i were in position to do extensive research in china i too might be owning

There is no question in my mind but that HG has been in bed with short sellers
for at least a decade, but that doesnt mean the short sellers are wrong. Also
while technically the report is correct, the company is essentially based upon
coal mine operations in china and from what i can garner from the guarded cpa
opinion letter, the cpa performed very little audit functions on the chinese
operations.

Between mr. lee's finra sanctions and the quarded opinion letter accompanying
the fiscal statement and the company's lack of a timely response to my question
about the accounting, it was enough to scare me out. if the numbers are real
its a bargain, however as someone who has been victimized by frauds in the
past, i cant stay in a position where i have concerns. I'd rather be wrong
,preserve capital and miss an opportunity, than be wrong and lose capital.

I would point out that this report does nothing to address my accounting
concerns, which the company is supposedly addressing. three months ago they
