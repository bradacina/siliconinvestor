I don't know why ASTC is down. Small companies have been a bit weak as of
lately so perhaps it is that. I believe the end of the space shuttle mission
will have no impact on them as it is my understanding that ASO isn't involved
in the space shuttle.

I used the June 2010 and 2009 years as a base because I'm expecting a higher
level of revenue in fiscal 2012 due to the large $16.2M contract. I'm guessing
$34M in revenue in 2012 ($8.5M/quarter average). My earnings estimate may be
high but I don't think we need numbers that good for them to be a good
investment.

Also, keep in mind that they have done some significant cost cutting.

re ASTC - seems like a checked history. Plenty of shareholder value must have

in shareholder equity left).

1st Detect:
I know a bit about Mass spectrometers. Fragmented niche market, hard to
penetrate because mass spectrometer are tuned to specific applications like
vacuum, process control, leakcheck, chemisty etc etc. I don't see that going

Astrogenetix: 
Microgravity research was a buzz word a few years ago and has grown stale, just
like nano science. Too expensive and difficult to commercialize, imo. Long

As for valuation, they are currently loosing money and trade a equivalent P/S

Space business is currently down and trends weak (again a business a know a
little about. overall it's a crapshot at this price. I see quite a bit of
management turnover and also share dilution (6% annually) I think this could
become an interesting if they get a capable manager at the helm that can make a

These covered call cef's look interesting.

I'm always wondering and concerned about what it is exactly that I am getting
when the distribution yield is 10%.

Nuveen says these cef options results fluctuate, so to make the quarterly
dividends consistent some return of capital might be included in the
distribution.

Poking through the website, I find this page:

http://www.nuveen.com/Home/Documents/Default.aspx?fileId=43431

It looks like really quite a bit of what I would be getting back is return of
capital. I don't know exactly what that entails. If it means though that what's
being distributed is culled from nav, then essentially it seems to me Nuveen
would be giving back fund holders' own money as a big majority of the
distribution. If this is so, then this is not what I want.

I'll just pass unless I can get some assurance that my understanding of the
situation is incorrect.

Yeah, I see how that chart brings up questions.

The way I see it is that each month they're buying large companies and writing
calls on them. They generate cash in that way and that would be income. Also, I
imagine they let some of their covered calls be exercised, calling some of
their shares way, which brings them cash but might be classified as a long-term
gain. So, I think they're going to generate 10% in cash one way or another
between call premiums and allowing covered calls to exercise. But, I imagine
that where they're using the premium cash or covered call exercising cash is
going to determine what the chart says between short-term income and capital
gains.

That being said, to me, the true measure of whether they're doing well enough
to pay out 10% in dividends is how the stock market is doing in addition to
their call premiums. If the stock market is even or up, they should have enough
to pay it that year. If the stock market is down, they may be reaching into
their NAV to pay it.

But, I like having a cef at a discount paying a large yield because even if
it's above earnings in a year, it will help to reduce the discount over a
long-term.

Thanks,

Hi Bruwin -

I am always looking for the Ag play that presents a value twist.. I have been
studying "Salicornia farming" which is a grass like plant that grows in salt
water.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicornia

From Wikipedia:"... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicornia_bigelovii can be
grown using saltwater and its seeds contain high levels of unsaturated
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicornia_oil (30 percent, mostly
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid ) and protein (35 percent),
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicornia#cite_note-Glenn1998-6
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicornia#cite_note-SAWorld1994-7 it can be used
to produce animal feedstuff and as a biofuel feedstock on coastal land where
conventional crops cannot be grown. Adding nitrogen-based
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer to the seawater appears to increase the
rate of growth and the eventual height of the plant,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicornia#cite_note-8 and it has been suggested
that the effluent from marine http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture (e.g.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp_farm ) could be used for this purpose.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicornia#cite_note-Glenn1998-6

Global Seawater Inc in Mexico is a company that has some farms located in the
Sea of Cortez where they use an integrated approach to grow shrimp, salicomia
that produces vegetable oil and protein feed

http://youtu.be/u0L-PLtNvRg?list=PL448B934626B01F17

I have not found a pure investment play yet but the concept of an integrated
farm operation makes a lot of sense especially when they can use marginal farm
land.

The corporate farm operation as we know it is quite efficient and produces ever
growing yields. Farms have used new technologies including genetic hybrid plant
stocks to highly mechanized machinery to produce these high yields. The next
step IMO is to integrate these highly efficient & productive operations using
the marginal lands (usually those contaminated by sea water) around the world.
Abundant labor is available but the "integrated technology package" is not. The
need to produce high protein foods to feed (& power) the world will drive the
economics in this equation.

I suspect at some point the big players like DD, MON & DE will play a big part
in the development of these new technologies. I am looking for the one that has
yet to be discovered.

EKS, Coastal lands, far from "marginal" in the sense I think you mean, are
often the brackish nurseries of many species and the home of the critical
organisms at the bottom of the food web. We already have seriously impacted
these most valuable areas of the planet with non-point source run-off from
large scale agriculture. It is in fact the largest polluter of our water.
Adding more nitrogen based fertilizer leads to algal blooms and they in turn
create hypoxic zones which kill all life. This occurs now in large areas of the
Gulf of Mexico from upstream effluent from the Mississippi and in the Great
Lakes, particularly Lake Erie.

The rate and volume of flushing and subsequent dilution of the Sea of Cortez
into the Pacific is unknown to me but does raise questions about Global
Seawater's ability to recycle enough of its production to avoid these kinds of
unintended consequences. I'll read up on them as soon as I can.

Figuring out these complex problems is precisely what we need to be doing and
we need to do it quickly. We also need to be smart about it. The binary nature
of the "discussion" about environment vs. capitalism is just stupid. We need
complex models and approaches and one of the optimal ways forward is to take
the best science, the best business practices, marry them to high standards of
ethical behavior and make a lot of money over a long period of time at good
margins.

All that said, I have followed your writing about Marine Harvest, looked at
their record and assessed their ability to both make money and behave
responsibly and invested accordingly. Market risk is high but so are growth a
opportunities and good margins. I agree enough in the growing need for protein
that I've committed substantial funds and will add to the food sector as high
risk/high reward opportunities present themselves.

Thanks for your many fine writings. I've learned a lot and earned a lot. best,

Thanks for posting the article. I'm interested in agriculture as I own wheat
farmland that has been in my family for over a hundred years. I agree that I
would be cautious in thinking that "this time is different" as the variables
that go into a price of wheat are many, enough at least to counterbalance each
other.

However, one can make the argument that agricultural prices haven't kept up
with general inflation and this could be one of those periods where there is a
secular period of prices simply catching up amidst the general boom and bust
cycles. Below is a further explanation to this proposal that I posted earlier
on the farming MB.

I think it is also interesting to note the difference in obesity rates between
developed and some developing nations. The WSJ had an interesting article
regarding this. My point is that our assumptions of consumption (ie demand)
might not be factored correctly. As much as the food paradox is focused on an
increasing population, one must also consider the wealth factor. There are a
couple of statistics that stand out.

Regarding the wealth factor, which mostly demonstrates itself as meat demand,
The Economist does talk about this phenomenon. It is a bad trend, however, it's
unlikely to change. As a vegetarian, I am very sad that humanity eats more and
more meat, which is bad from multiple angles. I do not invest in companies
directly involved in meat and fish industry. (I must say that using food as a

Hi gcrispan

Thanks for the reference to the Food Processing and Agriculture Farming (
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=24638 )SI thread. I find
that many of these large conglomerates have a way of stumbling into some of
these forward looking ventures which can create shareholder value through their
participation. Many times it is just the infusion of new capital into some of
these projects that starts the ball rolling.

Bunge Limited (NYSE: BG) and Solazyme, Inc. (NasdaqGS: SZYM) (
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27423411&srchtxt=solazyme )
is one group I mentioned up thread that has a JV project in Brazil to produce
ethanol and other complex oil products from sugar beets. I have been
accumulating shares in BG as I consider them a value Buy selling at a 4 PE (w/
forward PE of 11). More importantly, they are committing some very large chunks
of capital into some of these new emerging AG technologies that increase the
efficiency in their after harvest production operations . I would not be
surprised to see one of these large conglomerates begin to invest seed money
into one or more of these Integrated Seawater Forestry Farming ventures. The
key will be which one(s).

I was quite impressed what Eritreay is doing with mangrove tree production (
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnzIg3XdcjY&feature=autoplay&list=PL448B934626B0
F17&index=6&playnext=2 ). I have investments in Fibria Celulose SA (FBR) that
grow eucalyptus tress in Brazil to produce paper pulp for China. FBR has a
profitable operation but requires a lot of capital (typically LT debt) to
achieve the efficiencies of scale to run their operations. Their earlier
company formation was wiped out from the US $/Real currency devaluation (FBR is
the result of a previous BK) which only points out that the huge impact a
strong/weak$US can have on leverage capital used throughout the world.

Therefore, I see the next big transition is the flow of new capital into
several of these AG resource regions (primarily third world) combined with new
efficient technologies (from U.S , Israel & Canada) probably introduced by one
or more of the mega conglomerates through a JV or subsidiary company.

One last example where this occurred (not w/ agriculture) was DuPont's China
Solar Panel JV resulting in several leading edge manufacturing facilities in
China. I have followed this project through inception and posted several
articles of their progress to this thread. They now operate a several billion
dollar subsidiary (started w/ a $25 million investment) supplying solar panels
throughout China. It was pointed out by one or two posters on this thread that
their investment and the corresponding sales would be too small to move the
needle for a company as large as DuPont. That's what makes it so exciting since
it was their capital infusion (eventually over $1Billion) which resulted in
billions of new sales accounting for 10% of DD's 2011 profits and upwards of
17% of their profits for 2012.

The value proposition will be if a BG or DD or any other of the large
international conglomerates commit new capital to one or more of these
projects. We have seen Google do it for solar and wind farms but no one yet for
integrated Ag farming to the extent that "will move the needle".

I'm still considering my response about this growth rate.

There are two definitional aspects. What is it that's growing when we say
growth rate? Here the author means eps. What is meant by long-term? Here I
infer it's the 3-5 year holding. (That ain't long term to some of us -g-) Is
there a third aspect?: I assume when people talk about long-term eps growth
rates, they mean compounded.

When I read this: "BNY Mellon also sports an impressive 12% long-term growth
rate." , I assume that that is a fact, a historical number. Growth might not
continue at that rate, but it was there up until now.

I initially believed the author was being tricky by switching me from
historical to predictive --that what he actually was saying was that the 12
percent is from a few analysts predictions, and tricky to my mind because it
had nothing to do with eps results BK has achieved previously.

I'm going to stay with that. I have from S&P, 2005 forward , eps as
2.15;2.05;2.38;1.22;-.93, 2.11. That doesn't look like 12% historical growth in
eps to me.

Growth rates: And I am still considering my response:

Nobody knows the future. It just seems to me though that if somebody says a
rather dull-plodder like BK had an historical eps growth rate of 12% and might
continue that rate in future, that that could be something that might be
plausible - maybe reasonable - just on the face of it (i.e. the trend merely
just continues--- given that I don't know enough about the company's future to
contradict the assertion). However, BK eps growth rate does not seem actually
to have been anywhere near as high as 12% historically (past five years or so).

I can accept the continuation of the historical trend a heck of a lot easier
than what a few analysts (none of whom I know) seem now to claim about BK -
that it will grow eps at 12% -- much higher than it may have grown in the
recent past. I have no idea why that higher growth in future or where it might
be coming from. Not sure what BK's historical eps growth rate actually is, only
that it may be lower, maybe only as much as 6-8%, if that. In which case,
saying BK growth rate (eps growth rate) will be 50% higher (i.e. 12%) without
great supporting evidence, well imo that is speculative bunk.

From:Shane M
Anthony,

As far as specialization. I'm not sure of your experience or background, but
depending on how much time you've put in and time/experience I think matters
for how you perceive the market and how it works. I've had the benefit of 2
monster bear markets in the 2000s followed by a couple of powerful bulls.
Before that I saw the tech bubble of late 90s. Prior to that it was pretty much
bull market my entire life. (I bought my first stock with lawn mowing money
when I was a teenager back in the 80s, so until the 2000s I didn't really
experience the a real grinding bear until the tech crash in 2000-2002.) I was
getting very much into tech until the 2000-2002 bear which showed me the
downside of the market - caused me to broaden my thinking to be much more
afraid of the downside. It's odd now that many of the tech darlings of 2000 are
so "cheap" now - things have nearly come full circle in a way.

I started educating myself w/ the Peter Lynch books - I really liked the way he
took time to explain how to read financials in some cases; stuff like Malkiel's
"Random Walk Down Wall Street" was interesting was recommended by one of my
college professors. After that I just started reading a bunch of stuff that was
in the same section in the library. After a while alot of it starts sounding
the same so you can start skipping more, but occasionally you get lucky and hit
something interesting from different angles. I read through Value-Lines that
were free at my college libraries. (This was before the internet so seeing long
trends of data like value line had influenced me some I think). I still didn't
have enough money to be dangerous with when I was in college, but that formed
my basis (that and I was an economics major which trains you to think in a
specific way about incentives imho).

What really made a difference for me for organizing and filtering ideas down in
a businesslike way using stock screening software and then doing financial
projections in Excel. For me anyway, there are too many stocks to just take any
stock and try to put a value on it. 95% I can exclude without even thinking
about them. I used screening software (I use AAII Stock Investor Pro software)
to narrow down my field of choices - exported alot of the passing companies
financial stats to Excel, and then used excel to quickly narrow even further to
a manageable amount. fwiw - while I've developed a much better gut feel for
companies I'm looking for now, I still can't imagine trying to invest without
using the screens I've built up over time when looking for new opportunities.
I'd build in alot of automatic protections to filter out things that seemed to
consistently get me into trouble - (for example excluding financial companies,
or certain debt levels)

Test your ideas: I used a website called marketocracy.com which let me run lots
of trial portfolios over many years to try different approaches and verify what
worked - which is very important - without confidence I'm toast. In my opinion
there's a distinct lack of quality control in the investing area out there -
most professional money managers can't beat the index so take market advice
with a huge grain of salt. Most of them don't have an approach or system that's
any better than average - but they may still get on TV or be interviewed in the
paper. If you can find things that work for you - go with it.

As I mentioned in a previous post Buffettology was a book that just "clicked"
with me when i read it. It fit with the way I thought and it very much fit with
a methodical stock selection approach. A lightbulb came on that what this book
is telling me to look for companies w/ certain characteristics, but also having
a high degree of predictability. The predictability part was very important for
modeling values looking several years out into the future. So I set out
building lots of filters that require long periods of predictable results and
the screening software was excellent for that. The book provided a couple of
formulas that are similar to what I use to do projections on stocks that meet
enough stability requirements to be "projectable". IMHO not many stocks are
projectable over several years, but there are a few that it seems it can be
done with, and that's one of the areas I started with with a high degree of
seriousness.

I think there are probably 100s of other approaches that will work - but that's
the first one I landed on and built out. It tested OK over time, it worked for
me in practice, fit my personality, and I honestly liked the types of companies
which tended to a growth bent - and I still have alot of bias in me toward
growth stocks even today. Alot of folks would say most of the stocks I've made
most of my money on have looked expensive - and they did unless you combined
predictability of returns and growth over long periods of time. That doesn't
mean I don't get burned every once in a while (example recently Garmin
collapsed before I saw what was happening, but the Garmin lesson helped me
understand and avoid companies like RIMM) - but I have confidence it'll work
given the constraints used.

More recently I've gotten into Greenblatt's Magic Formula approach. He has a
few books out and a website that'll show the top passing companies. It's
striking how simple his approach is, but I really like the type of companies
his approach produces and he's already done a ton of the work by backtesting
and sharing his idea with us. I do edit the results of the approach heavily (I
also throw out almost all Chinese companies - there are lots that will pass)
and am still learning, but I've added those companies to the universe of what I
look at now. His approach really is all about buying only companies that have
high "Returns On" calculations, but only buying them when they are priced
"low". Many of these I think qualify as value stocks and are sometimes posted
on this value board, but you'll still run into some that pure value investors
will think are expensive, but that's OK. Everybody's gotta find their comfort
zone - the types of company they can believe in - I think that's important.

And another thing. Don't take anything I've put in here too seriously. I am a
hobbyist. A pure investment hobbyist. I've done OK and think I've found some
alpha over time. But I mean it when I say I think there's 100 different ways to
make money - you've just got to find something that works for you AND fits your
personality. Finding a style that fits our personality and approach is
important. For example: I've never made a dime in financial stocks - I for the
life of me can't understand them - I've done so badly with them that I have a
rule to never buy another one that even "sounds" related to financials. There
are other investors who have made their living in financial stocks - so if
that's your game or area of expertise go for it. Peter Lynch said some of his
best research was going to the mall and walking around and seeing which stores
were crowded and which ones weren't. If you have special insight there - that's
an advantage you have and go for it. You'll better understand why those
companies are moving. Or how many people in the south saw Wal-Mart come into
town and demolish K-Mart and all other competitors, but didn't buy the stock?
Geography can sometimes be an advantage if you see something that works before
it spreads (ala Starbucks maybe?)

I guess I'm just trying to say there are lots of advantages out there, don't
close off your mind to some advantages you may already have just because books
may tell you to do something else.

As far as your last comment about amount of money.... We all probably started
w/ small amounts and it was a good thing. Learning can be expensive. Be humble
with the market. Never think you know more than the market. It is smarter than
everyone else combined. Some of my biggest mistakes were cases where I was in a
stock that was going down, and I was convinced the market was wrong to be
driving the stock down. So what would I do? I'd average down by buying more.
And the stock would keep going down.... The market knows what we don't. I've
found it best to assume the market knows something I don't - it keeps a little
bit of fear in me at all times now. I used to get too confident at times,
especially after some good runs. I now have a rule to never average down, and
more often than not I'm now likely to just sell if a stock is moving against me
strongly and I don't know why. Occasionally I'll sell at a low, but it's also
saved me from larger losses more than a couple of times.

With transaction costs as low as they are now you can move in and out of
positions with relatively low cost, so I wouldn't think there's much concern
about investing small sums of $ vs. large sums of money anymore. It used to
matter more when commissions were higher, but now not so much.

Anyhow, hope this helps.

Traditional Hard Drives are going to be cheaper and cheaper the more we go into
the future. IMO, that's why Samsung and Hitachi sold their hard drive
businesses because the margins are not that spectacular and also demand will
continue to soften into the future.

Make no mistake, there is a very good chance that traditional hard drives will
stay around for a long time because they offer superior storage and barely any
speed loss in 99% of the tasks by everyday individuals. However, there's no way
for me to figure out whether or not chip memory will completely replace
traditional spinners but I have been picking up signals from developments into
the future, for example, Cloud. The basis of Cloud Computing is for computers
to rely less on internal storage as everything is stored in a remote server
elsewhere and therefore computers will turn into terminals. This seems like its
going to encourage laptops that are more portable and that's where chip memory
will definitely be the choice over traditional spinners.

Overall I skip this sector because its still somewhat blurry to me but if I had
to pick a company from this sector, i'd choose SNDK and hold it. Demand for
chip memory is going to grow and i'd rather bet on that than calculating the
life left in WDC/STX.

Keep in mind, product wise WDC > STX but STX is the MUCH more attractive
purchase here. The recent purchase of Samsung's Traditional Hard Drive may have
enough R&D to propel traditional Seagate Hard Drives over WDC.

Thanks! I appreciate your sharing.

Tech companies are wonderful examples of Black Swan companies, but the book
doesn't follow my "line of thoughts", first because my thoughts are not linear,
and second because the book endorses a type of biased thinking...

People tend to make sense from patterns that in fact make no sense, Michael
Shermer who wrote "The Believing Brain" said: "Unfortunately our brains evolve
to assume that most of the patterns we see are true", you may check the man's
arguments.

People involved in value investing are often effected by such bias, you see a
company that made big success, you make your own conclusions that the company
did succeed because of factors: a, b ,c , ...etc
If you hear somebody else speaking about a given set of factors, say :b, and c,
you may start believe even more strongly in the said factors, and if someone
commonly called "expert" says the same thing it may exaggerate the importance
of these factors in your mind, the next you do is look for companies that
gather the biggest number of "success factors", and you buy. If anyone here has
been long enough in the value investing business he must have had experiences
like "it was had everything to succeed but it didn't".

Nassim Taleb provides very good arguments about fallacies and biased thinking,
he also says, which may not be new to anybody here, the events that had the
biggest impact were unpredictable, but they seem to be that way after they
occur, The Black Swans.

I don't look for the so called factors of success and don't believe in magical
recipes, if anyone was so special to find the "great secrets of success" then I
believe they wouldn't share it in a publicly available book.

I strategize starting from an understanding of uncertainty, and from studying
the exposure of the company to the unexpected, random and big events.

I am glad to react to every constructive post in this forum.

Hi ShaneM,

Thank you for taking the time to share your experiences and advise with me. At
present I am following the recommendations of others on the thread who have
kindly shared their thoughts. I ordered a bunch of books and I am working my
way through them as they arrive.

I am starting to formulate filters for investment candidates. I am looking
primarily at trying to identify companies with greater book value per share
than the going share price. Then I try to identify and cull financially weak
companies. Next, I try to determine if the industry of the company in question
has any favorable factors or at least developing favorable factors. The story
of Mr. Womack, and the concept of "Black Swan" events has set me thinking.
Therefore, the current "season" of the investment, and probable positive events
are filtering elements I consider. I have not fully understood the practical
application of black swan events into the screening process yet.

For now, I am reading books rather than 10Ks. I hope in the future I will be
able to contribute to the thread in a meaningful way. Presently, I think it is
wiser to "lurk", and listen. As an ancient Hindu text declared, "Through
observation Indra became king of the the Gods."

The fact that we agree is disturbing :) I'm sure it means that default won't
happen. ;)

There are some people talking about Black Swans. Hey, here's your chance. Buy
US debt CDS'es. The prices are very cheap, nobody believes that default will
happen, you don't even need a default to make money, you only need market to
shrug off the current Polyannish outlook and get a doubt.

No, I won't buy CDSes, although perhaps I should. On the other hand going to
cash is pretty painless solution here. The market is not very cheap. Let's say
there is no default. What will happen? The market may rise a bit, but whatever
solution is accepted will come with spending cuts that lead US towards slowdown
and possible recession. Market may start worrying about that and not rise much
if at all. Will I miss 5% runup? Perhaps. 10-20% runup? I don't think so. Not
in a week. My biggest risk is not a market runup. My biggest risk is another
IDCC/TRH/??? buyout where I am selling a stock now that will be bought out in a
week and return 50-100% So perhaps I should sell MSFT. There will be no MSFT
buyout, right? ;)

I think you are correct, this debt limit drama is one of those cases, where
there is very little upside but a lot of downside. Even if a deal is made, I
see a situation where roughly 10% of the GNP (15 Trillion us$) is generated by
the deficit (1.5$ trillion Us$). So, if we go into a self sustaining situation
where the deficit stays the same, the GNP would be 10% lower.
Of course, that would never work that way because -10% GNP would be a disaster,
but that just shows the severity of the situation. Any cut in spending, will
cause a corresponding reduction in GNP - since the numbers are so large, there
are going to be severe headwinds in growth for many years and maybe decades. I
see little good coming out of this for the stock market, no matter what the
solution.

Popularity and growth of ETF's is really affecting the asset management
business: "The growing popularity of ETFs has posed a difficult problem for the
more traditional Asset Management Sector. It seems possible that a secular
shift is taking place away from actively managed mutual funds and towards the
macro-outperformance based model of ETFs. This has consequently resulted in
major outflows in some companies' assets under management."

Because I couldn't figure out the value of its combined operations, when I did

Of course congressman are not complete idiots, but history shows that a group
of smart people, acting by virtue of competing parties can come up with very
boneheaded results. Then, there is also the risk that they wait until the last
minute to resolve the differences, a technicality prevents them from raising
the limit, even if they intend to do so. Last not least there is a case to be
made that, regardless of circumstances; if a country is only a couple of days
away from default, it can't be considered AAA any more. This is because in the
end, paying or not for a sovereign is a matter of political will to use the
governmental powers to pay their debtors.
If that cannot be considered a given any more, foreign debtors should not
consider sovereign debt safe. Sovereign debt is not like debt of a company
where in case of a default, the debtors have the claim to the assets. The
sovereign owners are the people and the government body and if they don't pay,
the debtors are basically out of luck - they cannot claim anything in most

We discussed refineries few weeks ago and just read an interesting article

(7/26/11) - the article explains why the shares of refiners such as

http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=us:DK ,
http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=us:HFC and
http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=us:WNR have surged between
75 and 130 per cent year-to-date due to a profit from an anomaly in global
crude oil prices.

"For years WTI traded at a premium to Europe’s Brent and other light US crudes.
But a glut at its delivery point in Cushing, Oklahoma, after regional
production surged has imposed a large markdown. This month
http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0a079568-9d67-11e0-9a70-00144feabdc0.html . No
pipelines run from landlocked Cushing to the refinery corridor along the Gulf
of Mexico, or to refineries in the east and west coast, so regional refineries
able to tap the hub to make fuel have seen profit margins widen sharply.
Western, which has two small refineries that supply less than 0.9 per cent of
US fuel needs, said in a filing the imbalance was “a positive development for
us as all of our oil purchases are based on pricing tied to WTI”. CVR, with a
lone small refinery 100 miles from Cushing, enjoyed margins of more than $20 a
barrel in the first quarter, from $6 a barrel a year before. The reporting
season for the refiners, to start this week, is likely to show even better
economics in the second quarter of the year."

armi, thanks for the perspective. I'm coming around to the view that the
computing power and storage power is going to live in the cloud, but I'm not
sure what that means for processing (I'm long INTC) and storage (WDC, STX,
SNDK, others).

What makes it fuzzy to me is all the devices on the consumer side seem like
they create a ton of demand "behind the curtain" - and while consumer device
might have different CPU and storage, I'm not sure where that leaves what is
out of sight. again, I'm long INTC so that tells you I'm betting some on what's
behind the curtain (more of a gut feel and based on comments from the company),
but I really wonder if the same game plays out in storage w/ consumer devices
going one way and the cloud going another.

anyhow, how it plays out I think provides opportunity which is what I'm looking
for.

thanks again, Shane

Jurgis,

just a totally uneducated guess - but I think the market's lack of concern over
default increases the likelihood - and it allows the game to go on until the
last minute. At the first sign of the markets getting seriously concerned a
deal gets done fast. all imho.

My thought - if there's a sharp selloff: buy the dip. I do have quite a bit of
cash on sidelines. A deal will get done.

There is zero likelihood that the US will ever default on its debt. it can
always print money and raise taxes. Heck on a worst case basis it can go into
the expropriation business. its absurd that the rating agencies who for years
blew the rating on mortgage backed securities could have any credibility at
all.

congrats. i note that brk-b is actually down from 12/31/10 and there was a
large disparity in price between slw $39.04 and slv $30.18 on 12/31/10. this
has now narrowed to the point of equality. This makes no sense to me for three
reasons. the tax benefits of ownership vastly favor slw and there are questions
as to whether slv even has physical silver available to cover their
investors.Lastly according to the former CEO each share of SLW represents about
5 ounces of silver in the ground.

Re: Magellan Petroleum Corporation (MPET)

Doubled up on my MPET. Today's buy represents a 15% discount to my original buy
on 11/9/2010. Two new "positive" developments (w/i the last 10 days) by the
company have occurred:

<ul><li>On Monday July 18, 2011 - VAALCO Energy signs LOI to acquire additional
Bakken acreage (
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/VAALCO-Energy-signs-LOI-theflyonthewall-759666076
html?x=0&.v=1 ).This is a deal where VAALCO (EGY) has paid for a 65% interest
to develop a portion of MPET's Bakken acreage (23K acres). The cost is
estimated to be approx $5M/well at VAALCO's expense.</li></ul><ul><li>On Monday
July 25, 2011 - MPET announced that they unwound their deal with Santos and
will receive $10 million to terminate the previous Asset sales deed. (
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Magellan-Petroleum-prnews-113381761.html?x=0&.v=1
). The parties could not agree on the potential development terms. The cash is
good since there are plenty of other projects to spend it on (ie like on their
Bakken proprieties).</li></ul>
The net result of the two announcements provides the company w/ $10M cash
(about $0.19/share) and several new wells under development (through 2012) on
MPET's Bakken shale property.
Here is a good article on VAALCO (EGY) and where they are drilling. The company
is cash flow positive, no debt and sells at 9PE.

AVY: Avery Dennison which I poo-poohed in May of '09 when the stock was about
$29 and yielded over 5%, I now find to be attractive -- now that it's $31.65,
yields 3.2%, has been kicked out of Dividend Aristocrats, and reports an
earnings miss. -g- How strange! Anyway, it's another I pulled off the new lows
list on today's market drop (Dow down about 199). I'm in this afternoon for a
position.

"For all of 2011, the company expects to post adjusted profit of $2.45 to $2.75
per share. On average, analysts expect $2.64 per share, according to FactSet."

No assurance that these earnings would be achieved (This may be the second
consecutive quarter they've missed estimates), but if $2.45/sh were to be
achieved, it would give the shares a p/e of 12.9. --- High in my view, but
below what AVY averages in good years.

Dividends will continue to be an important component of shareholder returns, as
AVY president alludes:

“During the second quarter, our two largest segments, Pressure-sensitive
Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions, experienced a rapid
decrease in unit volumes that drove results below expectations,” said Dean
Scarborough, Avery Dennison chairman, president and CEO. “We are taking action
to reduce costs and increase productivity through this slowdown, and we expect
to regain momentum when market conditions improve. We remain focused on
maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing return of cash to
shareholders.”

Thanks for the MPET report. It would be nice if the company put out a new
presentation.

I'm in a losing position with all my MPET shares; I have a full position (for
me), and I'll continue holding, and I won't change that until I know more.

Company has an enterprise value (per Yahoo) of $74M dollars. I show among other
operations, MPET holds 23K acres in Montana Bakken. I'd sure like to know what
comparable land in their area there is going for. $1K/acre, $2K, 3 or more?
=====================
=====================

I'm willing to continue to bet on e&p's where the probability of success may be
small, but if there is a payoff, the consensus is that it would be very very
large. MMR is one, and VQ is another. I added to both positions today. I like
these two because they are USA. And as I often say, I want a basket -- my hope
and expectation being that if even one pays off, it'll make up for losses that
might be sustained by the other or others in the basket.

I can find several such e&p opportunities in foreign countries too - in the
"stans", and in Africa, and in Venezuela. I won't now put any more money into
these. I continue to hold positions in a few, Mart Resources (MAUXF.pk/MMT.v
being my largest such. My worry is the probability that the governments will
change terms of the agreements with the e&p companies to eventually grab more
of the oil should any wells be prolific. And I don't like that it's not
possible to quantify "more" in advance: it could be 50% it could be 90-100%
that these governments might confiscate.

re GLW - I decided that 16.05$ is low enough for me and adequately reflects the

I am selling down other position that have done well - sold the rest of Nippon

Hi Clownbuck -

What's your holding period and long term target on GLW? I have shares I bought
in 5/30/2002 at $5.05/share and another much smaller lot on 8/2010 for
$17.48/share. I have peeled off shares every time the stock ran up to
$22.00/share but on the last run at this level I re-evaluated the company and
it's products and came to a $29.00/share fair value target..

They have a new diesel filter they using a new innovative technique with a
catalyst (similar to a catalytic converter) that was first introduced in Europe
in 2009 and then into the US in 2010. Sales have done extremely well and many
(if not all ) of the new diesel cars & trucks sold in the U.S.have to use this
filter to meet the new EPA rules. This diesel filter is also used on all heavy
duty equipment (tractors, backhoes, semis etc) which is a new market for GLW.

Their LCD display screen technology is now really a commodities business. They
are working on something called gorilla glass which could leap frog the current
technology used for touch screens. This new glass will be used in smart phones,
tablets and and larger "touch" screen panels. Windows 8 new Touch Screen UI to
be released in 2012 will create a huge demand for this GLW product.

The company has always been good at developing new products. In fact they have
a new fiber cable that they invested tons of money that can be manufactured at
a very competitive price, can be flexed at greater degrees than competitive
brands and is capable (w/ their electronic hardware) of carrying significantly
more data than the leading technology.

All in all I see GLW as a good GARP stock especially at current prices and I
continued to hold my top 15 position waiting for my $29.00/share value price.

re Corning - the LCD display glass was always a commodity business, but it is a
good one, since there are only a few established players - Corning with a 70%
market share, there is Schott, and Nippon Electroglass. It is the profitable
part of the LCD display business, just like the aircraft builders are the
profitable part of the aircraft industry (relative to airlines; I know the
analogy lacks a bit).

Besides that, Corning is a company that always has been coming up with new uses
and technologies around glass (I know that because I work with glass a lot in
my job), the diesel technology you mentioned, catalysators were one that came
up in the 80's and the Gorilla glass is another, glass fibers etc etc.
As such, I believe it is a fairly well run company that is somewhat
underappreciated. I plan on building my position if the shares go below 15$.

These two wells have been tested at a combined stabilized rate of approximately
15.5 MMCFD of 1285 Btu natural gas and 1,100 barrels of condensate per day
("BCPD") while each well was flowing at approximately 1200 psi of flowing
casing pressure and each well was producing over 150 barrels of frac water per
hour. The Wengerd 1H and 7H are expected to be placed on sales in mid-August
following delivery and installation of separators capable of handling the
condensate volumes. Gastar owns a 44.5% working interest ("WI") and 37.5% net

It is not at all clear what you are doing. The first portfolio you linked to
had 60 stocks, and we were discussing a stock bought 5/5/10. Now the discussion
is involving a portfolio of 210 stocks theoretically bought 5/15/10?

It seems to me your method will face headwinds, because for it to be successful
(and I don't see enough evidence to say it is) - it seems to me to require a
large number of picks -- as you have done (210). The issue is that no one will
take that seriously. I mean actually put down money on such a large number of
positions.

Apparently you've realized this, and you've now selected 21 on your site for
consideration, and as a representative sample or your best guess. If you have
210 and claim great results for 34 and fails for 22, if that were normative,
then of the 21 on your site you might get 3 success and 2 failures. Or maybe
just as easily 2 successes and 3 failures. So 21 picks is not enough, because
the variation imay be too large for the sample size. In some samples of 21,
you'd be a winner, and in some samples of 21 you'd wind up a loser.
You apparently get around this by creating a weighting factor -- more money is
committed to some stocks than others. That presupposes then, imo, that you can
determine which stocks in a list are going to have a better chance of being a
positive black swan than the others you've chosen to also be potential black
swans. The thing about black swans, as I understand it, is it's very very
difficult to predict which are going to be such. And the reader has to rely on
a weighting system -- on your site, it would apparently be a reliance on your
ability to predict the occurrence of the black swan.
