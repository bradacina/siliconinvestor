On Aug 16 NCZ set an all time low of $8.94. With a monthly dividend of about 11
and a half cents, or $1.39 a year, this would be a 15% yield.

Author Richard Lehman was on a couple interview shows that day and rather
prophetically said that "when greed overcame fear at about a 15 percent yield"
people would start buying NCZ.

They did, it closed today over 13.

CSE - Still going up AH almost to yearly high.

Aug 16 Morningstar article suggests that CSE fair vakue is in low 30's

Firms at Fire-Sale Prices
A long time horizon, coupled with the confidence that the best lenders will
survive this crisis, means that we are sticking to our guns and recommending
some outstanding values. We will highlight a few names here, but
Morningstar.com Premium Members who want a fuller picture of 5-star financial
stocks can see them by clicking here. (Data as of Aug. 16, 2007.)

Countrywide Financial
Current Price: $18.95
Fair Value: $48
Morningstar Rating: 5 Stars

Countrywide is the largest mortgage lender in the U.S. It has been caught in a
barrage of negative sentiment surrounding its ability to borrow money to fund
its operations. We think it will not only survive, but that it will emerge
stronger in the future.

CapitalSource (NYSE:CSE - News)
Current Price: $16.02
Fair Value: $33
Morningstar Rating: 5 Stars

The company and its dividend still appear to be in good shape, and
CapitalSource is well positioned to take advantage of current fears in the
capital markets, in our opinion. When credit spreads widen, companies like
CapitalSource can charge higher interest rates on loans, potentially improving
net interest margin in future years.

E*Trade Financial (NasdaqGS:ETFC - News)
Current Price: $13.55
Fair Value: $24
Morningstar Rating: 5 Stars

In light of the difficulties in gaining access to short-term credit that other
mortgage lenders have experienced, there appears to be concern that E*Trade may
be dealing with many of the same issues. However, we believe that E*Trade has
adequate access to liquidity in the near term through its substantial deposit
base, as well as access to Federal Home Loan Bank advances. As such, the firm
should be able to weather the current storm.

Newcastle Investment Corporation (NYSE:NCT - News)
Current Price: $31
Fair Value: $16.28 (seems like typo, $46.28 ???)
Morningstar Rating: 5 Stars

Of Newcastle's $9.1 billion in assets, $1.2 billion are subprime loans or
subprime-backed securities. Going forward, there is still the risk that many of
these assets may be further impaired; however, Newcastle is taking calculated
risks and buying assets at distressed prices. This is core to the strategy in
which they seek to exploit market turmoil. Besides credit concerns, fear about
short-term liquidity problems is elevated in the mortgage real estate
investment sector today. Newcastle has a balance of $300 million on its
warehouse facilities. Meanwhile, it has $35 million in free cash and $154
million in restricted cash. Liquidity does not appear to be a concern in the
short term, since the majority of assets are financed with long-term debt.

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC - News)
Current Price: $49.85
Fair Value: $70

The following is from a Street.com article quoting info from the CC this week.
It appears to me that the story is still unfolding.

Melco said average daily VIP rolling chip volume -- a key Macau operating
statistic -- was $20 million in the second quarter. The volume more than
doubled to $44 million in July and has improved another 25% to $55 million
since the beginning of August.

For the second quarter, Melco reported a loss of $69.2 million, or 6 cents a
share, widened a loss of $5.2 million, or 1 cent a share, a year earlier. Heavy
property-related expenses dragged down results.

The period marked the first quarter that included any casino results, since the
Crown property opened in May. Thus revenue for the quarter soared to $45.1
million from $5.5 million a year earlier.

Melco said Crown's market share of total gaming revenue in Macau was 1.7% in
May, 2.7% in June, and 4.9% in July. In August, the share rose to 7%,
management said on the company's conference call.

I also bought a few shares of CIT, as i think that the stock has gone too low
and they are unduly punished by the subprime craze.

My argumentation: 10.4B$ mortgage loans with 0.7B$ reserve for credit losses.
Management projections are that the portfolio will be income neutral (net
interest spread of 50M$/quarter will neutralize 50M$ in credit losses). i think
about 20% of that portfolio looks at risk for default (LTV 90-100%, low credit
scores). if they recover 2/3 of the loan amount in case of default, they would
be OK. for me management projections for the loan losses still look a little
optimistic but i think most potential losses are reserved. Anyways those 10B$
in assets will be sold, as soon as feasible.
CIT core business assets are about 70B$, so only about 12.5% of CIT assets are
in the mortgage sector. As long as the core business is intact i do not see a
big problem.

Finances: 6B$ in commercial paper outstanding. They have 2 sales each for 3B$
internotes (424B prospectus) done (successfully?) which should cover the entire
commercial paper outstanding and convert those into LT debt (at higher cost of
course). In addition they mention 7.5B$ in bank credit lines. I think the
internote sales were done to cover liquidity needs in case commercial paper
rollover is not possible. It looks like the liquidity needs are covered short
term but the cost of capital will rise. My guess is they may be able to charge
higher interest rates to their customers as well, so spreads my not be
affected. Anyways that sounds a whole lot better than CFC, where the whole
business is at risk. Trading at a small premium to book at with LT ROE of 15%
should make CIT an OK buy at current prices. I am in for a few shares at this
point.

Hi Spec,

Current leverage is smaller than in other lenders and financial companies.
The 6.67% loss probability translating into about 500MM at risk need to be
considered and if spreading to the remaining mortgage book, could put the
company a bit stress and the leverage to an unacceptable level.
Their quick ratio points to unsound financing practices namely to have a too
high amount of short term liabilities. This is a hazard and the only visible
risk at the current time. CP and repo dryup and the company is at stake.

Remains the question about the quality of the non-mortgage part. While we might
not be there yet, and currently the credit risks appear to be confined to the
MBS sector, contagion into other ABS spheres can not be ruled out.

Bloodthirsty as the market is, a stock with declining earnings having some
mortgage exposure is prone to sudden declines and shakeouts.

It is a good candidate for a shakeout in October when Institutions dump stocks
which are down for the year.

I would buy CIT but it should bottom out first. Maybe it trades sub-$20 for a
brief time.

Midland - no argument here that CIT is risky:
 The 6.67% loss probability translating into about 500MM at risk need to be
considered and if spreading to the remaining mortgage book, could put the
company a bit stress and the leverage to an unacceptable level. 
They reserved 700M$ not 500M$. I think they may have to reserve another 300M$
but that should be about it.

 Their quick ratio points to unsound financing practices namely to have a too
high amount of short term liabilities. This is a hazard and the only visible
risk at the current time. CP and repo dryup and the company is at stake.

They know that. I think the internotes issue of 6B$ total (which have a fairly
long maturity) are an attempt to replace the outstanding commercial paper. What
I do not know is if those internotes have been sold successfully.

 Remains the question about the quality of the non-mortgage part. While we
might not be there yet, and currently the credit risks appear to be confined to
the MBS sector, contagion into other ABS spheres can not be ruled out. 

I do not see any trouble except the mortgage companies doing ABS. If this
indeed happens and the ABS market becomes illiquid as well, a lot of financial
companies will be in trouble, not just CIT. So far the (non-mortgage) ABS
market has held up, as default rates are low and also yield hungry investors
have less alternatives now.

Bloodthirsty as the market is, a stock with declining earnings having some
mortgage exposure is prone to sudden declines and shakeouts.

LUM: Sold shares today for small gain. While news today is helpful for
liquidity, selling half the company for 18 cents/share certainly dilutes
existing book value and shows how weak of a position they are/were in. Maybe
they survive, but I don't think upside is that great from here at least anytime
soon at this point.

LEND: Still too much of a crapshoot for me, have no position. Although a

"...a bottom for at least another decade -- i.e. the start of an
inflation-adjusted increase in house prices."

The beginning of an inflation-adjusted increase would not mark the bottom. A
bottom imo, is better defined when housing prices just stop dropping and begin
to go up with inflation.

That is, I'm saying if a home increases with, or even below, the inflation rate
, that's still very okay with most potential buyers because even if the
inflation rate is 3% and housing increases 3% per year (that is, the
inflation-adjusted increase in housing is zero or non-existent), that's pretty
good for most folks who are likely to be leveraged with the conventional (or
maybe soon to be conventional) 20% down payment. In other words if the house
only goes up the inflation amount (presuming that there is inflation), the
return on investment (downpayment) is roughly 5x the inflation rate (ignoring
transaction costs), and I believe most folks - potential homeowners - would see
that as very positive.

perhaps i misunderstood but what you just wrote makes no sense to me unless you
pay 0 interest on your mortgage. Id like to get a deal like that. As far as I
know you can only make good money if the price appreciation is well above your
mortgage interest rate. otherwise given the fact that you have to pay real
estate taxes , upkeep, decorating costs , you will likely make very little
money on having a house. For example my house in wisconsin increased by some
60% over the 10 years we lived there. However we paid re taxes of some 3% a
year, we probably put in at least 13% in repairs and decorating costs, so we
ended up netting maybe 8% on our investment if that, and that was because the
real estate broker gave us a break on her commission in order to make the sale
happen. Current interest rates are over 6%, if we assume no house appreciation
for 2 years, it will be very difficult for home owners to make any money at all
unless they buy a bargain, So if i were buying a house today i would only buy
something at 20% below current market prices. I dont think I will make a dime
on this house which we purchased 2 years ago, but I might because my 30 year
mortgage is at 5.5% and my re taxes are very low, less than 1% of the value of
the house.

cheapest", "no, buy defensive stocks", "no, it's time to buy beaten down growth
stocks" in last crash. What was the best thing to do? Actually, it was "buy
beaten down quality growth stocks", IMO. But then it was a growth stock crash
in 2001. Right now growth stocks are not dropping much (unless you consider
homebuilders and mortgage-financials to be growth stocks ;)), so it's tougher
to guess what to buy. I am somewhat drawn to quality during crashes, but not to
the exclusion of valuation calculations. And I buy trash too - these usually
fluctuate much more widely than quality companies, so it's more likely that
price will drop to ludicrous levels.

Most canroys appear overvalued to me. the Dividends are not sustainable as the
reinvestment after payout ratios of around 70% is not enough to replace the
production, so reserves and production per trust unit are sinking. Some Canroys
have been getting around this by doing accreditive (in terms of reserves/unit)
acquisitions. this only works when share prices are high, but since the tax law
disaster last Halloween that is rarely the case any more.

take a look at the PV10 values of most Canroys from their Sedgar filings. you
will be surprised to see that they are below the current share prices in many
cases. When the tax law changes come into effect, those Canroys will trade at
the same PE ratios and cash flow ratios than their peer E&P's.

ERF which Paul mentioned is one of the better Canroys, as they have a long
reserve life and low costs. PWE which i owned a while ago looks like a disaster

ABIX,

Thanks for mentioning this Paul. For once I made a correct decision --- I sold
this along with some of my speculative holdings that had run up earlier. Still
got creamed on some of my other holdings.

I'd be inclined to take a small nibble and look for opportunity to add on
further weakness surrounding the delisting. It looks like the company will
continue to provide information, which is good.

CDL: Seems to me to be in a sector - radio broadcasting - that's in a downward
spiral with no end in sight. I've bet on a turnaround -- a revision to mean --
and have been VERY wrong about my bets on WON and SALM.

I've participated in some tremendous percentage losses here in these stocks
over the past few years:

http://finance.yahoo.com/charts#chart1:symbol=cdl;range=5y;compare=won+salm;ind
cator=dividend+volume;charttype=line;crosshair=cross;logscale=on;source=undefin
d

While CDL might recover, for me, I don't see anything that might be a catalyst
for the sector, and I've been slowly --too slowly-- reducing my positions in
this sector. (So I have no interest in buying CDL.) I guess I'm beat up enough
to where I can't see that if company earnings or cash flows or potential or
actual takeovers aren't by now - in our currently strong economy - helping the
share prices, then I don't know where the bottom or recovery for the sector
could be. Otoh, at some price, there will be a bottom.

For me, when I get like this though, rather than add more money into additional
buys, I'm dissuaded. I figure there's got to be better places in the stock
market to invest in.

Hi Paul - I feel your pain on WON. I think it is an industry thing.

You stated that :"...For me, when I get like this though, rather than add more
money into additional buys, I'm dissuaded. I figure there's got to be better
places in the stock market to invest in...."

Some of my BEST gains and WORST losses have come on buying more shares
averaging down. They key is to let your winners run and reinvest more dollars
on pull backs.

I did this with DRYS doubling up at $10. Great earnings announced today and the
stock traded up to $64.00 today.

I tried to buy more RIO as well below $40. It got as low as $34.00 on the sell
off last week. Today it was one of my largest gainers closing at $44.29. This
stock should sell over $100 in 3-5 years.

I bought more WON which continues to be a toad. I am not sure weather it will
ever be a princes. Ug.....

"Some of my BEST gains and WORST losses have come on buying more shares
averaging down."

That's a true statement for me as well. In general, I'd guess most of my gains
come as a result of averaging down. If I recall right, that's similar to what
Bill Miller said for himself in the interview article here recently.

I've got formulaic approaches to investing which get me into a variety of
stocks where I believe the models apply. Adding to, or subtracting from a
position, that though is where there's more judgment or art involved.

Generally I like to determine a priori if I will add to a stock if it declines
or if I will add to it if it should rise. Sometimes I don't make these
decisions in advance. I rarely though just plunk down a bunch of money at one
time: I like to enter in stages, if I'm going to make a substantial buy.

A key for you is "... to let your winners run and reinvest more dollars on pull
backs", and I have found that to work sometimes too. (--Everything works
sometimes and that is the problem -gg-).

One issue for stocks that decline is how long a person should hold them, or
should add to them. Bill Miller says he'll continue to add as the stock drops
(assuming he believes in his thesis for the company) as long as the stock
continues to trade. I believe Ben Graham's holding period for cigar butts was
two years. For me, for reversion-to-mean or turnarounds, I want to see some
stock improvement within three years (assuming my patience will last that
long). For company wide cultural changes, I don't expect completion for about
seven years.
Anyway for WON I've been in for at least 2 years, SALM 2 1/2 years, but the
drop has been so severe that I guess a gain (if it occurs) from current prices
over the next 12 months won't be enough for me to break even on my bets.

I do recall the discussion about Bill Miller and found it quite interesting. I

turn around.

Interesting note on Graham's general holding period for cigar butt positions.
Do you know if he found it profitable to ever establish new full positions from
his cigar butts? I find that I continue to have pretty good knowledge about
these companies and their operations. I tend to sell them too early in their
recovery. HAL is one that comes to mind.

I am currently reviewing my portfolio for tax loss selling candidates as I like

I guess I was not clear on the cigar butt question. I understood that this type
of position is established from a full position that has become fully valued.
One sells this position keeping a small number of shares identified as the
"cigar butt". At some point in the future (ie two years), the rest of the
position (ie cigar butt) is sold.

I just wondered if some time in the future Graham ever upped his remaining
small number of shares (the cigar butt) into a full position again because he
may have under estimated the "true" value of the company.

I have found that sometimes I sell too early but keep a small number of shares
only to up my position again in the future. This is because of (1) new company
events or (2) there is continued strong sector growth that leads me to think
that the company is under valued.

The best strategy would have been to just not sell the original position, but
sometimes I am wrong. By keeping a few shares in the portfolio (the cigar
butt), I continue to monitor the stock and if the company becomes under valued,
I up my position.

It just points out that the "sell" proposition is not always straight forward.
I know that I will never get it perfect, but it's establishing a discipline for
an exit strategy w/o leaving too much money on the table.

As far as I know, when Dr. Graham sold, he sold out completely, the stock price
meeting his objective. I did not know he kept stub remainders (what you call
cigar-butts.) I assume if the stock price declined again while other factors
for the stock (the business numbers) remained okay, he would buy back the
position if the stock were to drop down enough to hit his buy point again.

Somebody please confirm or correct if they are current on Dr. Graham's methods.

----
If I recall right, there could be an argument made that Dr. Graham made his
real money - his real big bucks - through his affiliation with GEICO. At some
point he became acquainted with management, and they put him on the board of
directors. I believe he was wanting to sell his GEICO shares (and maybe did
sell some), but he felt he couldn't sell all as a board member, so he held them
(most or maybe it was all), and over time his holding of these shares made the
big impact to his wealth.

I can't answer about whether Graham kept small positions but my understanding
and if memory serves the "cigar butts" was a reference to the type of stocks
that no one wanted and would through away (hence cigar butts) but still had
something of value left. In a Buffet book contrasting the similarities and
differences between the two of them this reference also indicated limited
upside.

Hope this helps.

Theres a lot of wisdom in that post Paul. Most wise is that there are no rules,
only judgement based on the situation at hand.

I've averaged down in stocks though that is not my style - my good ones I
usually nail a bottom and average up from there, though I've had a couple I
averaged down into which made a year for me. No rules, though I do have a few I
try to adhere to.

One thing I'll point out just from my experience and the kind of stocks I buy.
I will ONLY average down if I'm sure of the balance sheet. Thats why something
like a Countrywide is so uncomfortable for me to get into in the first place -
I missed the 75% move in a week - simply amazing for a market cap that size,
but I also didn't take the pain on the way down. If you bought CFC at the
bottom my hats off to you. I was looking at it at the bottom too, but I also
rejected it at 35, 32, 29, 24 and 18 so I'm not beating myself up over that
miss.

I can't remember an average down where I lost a lot of money (though I'm sure
there were a couple over the years that I erased from my memory because they
were so painful). Thats because of the kind of stock I'll average down in.

I used to have a rule for years that i've kind of loosened up on that you get
one average down after taking a full position and then thats it. That instills
a sort of discipline in that it makes you wait for an even better price and
also keeps you from fixating on a loser and adding to it all the way down then
finding out you were wrong.

The exception are the ones where you anticipate averaging down on a "falling
knife" and lay out a plan to buy 1% at 18, another 1% at 17, and fill the
position at 16. In that case if the stock went through 16 I've got one more
swing and I'm going to make it meaningful but its not going to be 15 1/2 - I'm
going to wait for 12 and then I might double the position. And then that is it.
After that the strategy is pray hard!

We all have ways of building our position based on our own psychology and the
kind of things we buy. Those are a few of my ways of looking at what Paul was
discussing.

Retailers have gotten annihilated folks, whats your favorite? I'll put up BGP,
though it is not one that looks cheap at first glance. Thats one I've been
averaging down into since 19. And don't tell me don't buy retailers - they've
gotten killed. Tell me six months ago don't buy retailers...now THAT would have
saved me some money!

Borders Group let me just say i'm working through a tattered copy of War and
Peace I bought 21 years ago when I was in high school - this is my third read
of it - the first in almost 20 years - and you know what the hundreds of hours
of intellectual stimulation I got out of this book cost me? $5.95. Gotta love
books. Thats not why I own Borders but just putting in a plug for Tolstoy.

Here is a difference between techniques:

Someone like yourself comes across this stock, evaluates it, decides it is a
very good buy for the portfolio. Tactically the portfolio is structured to
hold, say 12, maybe 15 key stocks or maybe just 12 or 15 stocks in total.
Therefore the position when taken, will be relatively large. When gains show -
if they do - they will be significant to portfolio performance. I've not gone
back to look at initial discussion for this stock, so I'm just guessing initial
buys might have been made in lower/mid $20's or even lower. The stock has moved
up so $ gains (relative to portfolio size) have been large from a combination
of large initial position and good percentage appreciation in the stock.

My consideration was this: I've no real information how this relatively obscure
company actually will see money from its business(es). I do see where the WYNN
holdings are reported as a significant asset. So my bet is on WYNN's possible
(probable?) good Macau performance that might propel this stock too. How much I
do not know.
My idea was that if things actually work out favorably, the stock
should/could/might rise over time. I would know more (maybe) as the situation
unfolded. So my tactic has been to enter for a small amount, and watch the
story and the stock, and add to my position if/as the stock rose. Which is what
I've been doing. I presume (rightly or wrongly) that the stock's rise is
confirmation that the company's investment in Macau (WYNN) and Japan are
validated by others who've come in to buy the stock.
I don't get the big $ profits by averaging up small from a small base, but I
didn't take a big initial risk either. (Well, I saw it as a risk.) I'm okay
with adding as the stock rises, but otoh, my cost basis keeps rising too, so if
the stock drops greatly, I recognize I could sustain losses (Losses which
somebody who bought all shares at 2/3 of current price might not experience.)

I mention my tactic with this company/stock only to illustrate a case where I
have planned to average up if/as the stock rose.

Regardless of averaging up or not, or averaging down or not, my overarching
philosophy holding a diversified portfolio is that it is better to be in a
stock that could/or might/or will do well if only for a few shares, than to out
of it totally and so miss out and get nothing.

And of course, going forward, I hope this stock continues to perform well for
all of us here who are in it, Madharry.

regarding CIT -
CIT has in addition to the aircraft lease payment notes (6 bill), a bank credit
of 7.5 bill which you mentioned and is in their 10Q. So if they have problem
rolling the CP you would think that they could use the bank LOC and also have
lots of cash from the aircraft lease payments notes they issued which is a long
term 2012 note. 

Rich, you are correct. they could use the bank LOC but i think they want to
avoid that. For one think bank debt tends to be more expensive but even more
important, it does look like a measure of last resort. As a financial entity,
the reputation is important to CIT, so I think they will try to avoid using the
LOC or at lest use it as little as possible.

 I would avoid all financials. It is just an opaque situation as to what banks
have perceived to be liquid cash equivalents may not be so; no one knows what
banks exposure is unless they choose to tell you or you audit their books and
records. 

I own quite a bit of financials still (also i have reduced my weighting since
many came back nicely the last few days). the current crisis has increased the
difference between the "have" and the "have nots", IMO. The have nots are
overleveraged entities holding the hot potatos, the have's are well capitalized
institutions which have excess to cheap credit funding and hold the good loans.
Most banks should be doing fine, indeed the fallout of the have not's which
suppressed margins should help them long term. For example the credit spread
for a Jumbo loan has basically doubled for any bank that has the means to keep
them mortgage on their book. This will improve operating margins going forward.

Furthermore, thrifts are a nice playground for a value investor and/or nimble
trader. For one, they trade very inefficient, they are simple to compare and
there is much information around from the FDIC. Nowadays they trade at
reasonable multiples and to top it off there is a decent chance of a takeover.

CIT has also already taken their hit on their mortgage business and mortgages.
The amount was 765 mill about and this was after netting the reserves of over
200 mill. So the total markdown was about 1 bill.This was announced way back
about July 17. So I doubt that their will be any more writedowns. CIT said they
will continue to operate mortgage business and sell it when they can do so at
reasonable prices. So like you I took a position. Paul did also but none of us
I think took a huge position or bet the farm. So far so good. The CEO recently
bought shares after earnings announcement - about 12000 or so. To do so he
could not have inside material info like a buyout etc. Anyway looks favorable.
Tyco IPOd CIT for 4.5 bill after buying it for 9 bill. This was all about 5
years ago. If you count intangibles CIT book value is 35 dollars. Right now its
value is about 7 bill even. Would you buy more if it looks like all clear in

CIT liquidity:

By Karen Brettell

NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc.'s (CIT.N: Quote, Profile, Research)
credit spreads may have value as the "A"-rated company trades at similar levels
to junk rated companies.

In a market that remains nervous over corporate access to short term funding
and averse to any exposure to residential mortgages, however, trading of its
debt is likely to remain erratic.

CIT's debt has been marred by concerns about whether the company will succeed
in rolling its commercial paper, and that it may be forced to sell mortgage
assets at distressed prices as part of its plans to exit the business, if it
cannot obtain liquidity elsewhere.

But "given that five-year senior CDS spreads are already trading at high
yield-type levels, we continue to see value in the credit at current spreads,"
CreditSights analysts including Richard Hofmann said in a report on Wednesday.

CIT said in July it was exiting the mortgage business after selling its $2.6
billion portfolio and that it took a $495.3 million after-tax write-down
related to the assets it plans to sell.

At a meeting with sell side analysts on Tuesday night, CIT assured attendees
liquidity was not a problem and that it was aiming to time asset sales with a
view of obtaining favorable pricing.

"The company stressed that it is active and maintains access in the short-term
funding markets, albeit at higher costs," Hofmann wrote.

CIT indicated that the cost of rolling its commercial paper has jumped to a
range of around 25 to 50 basis points over the London interbank offered rate,
compared from about 5 basis points below LIBOR before recent market
disruptions, he said.

How about this one for a Hedge Fund Letter to its shareholders:

Aug. 16 (Bloomberg) -- (by Mark Gilbert - Bloomberg in London)

Dear investor, we'd like to take this opportunity to update you on the recent
performance of our hedge fund, Short-Term Capital Mismanagement LLP.

As you know, market selection for the entire fund is guided by a proprietary
investing tool we like to call "a dartboard.' Once the asset classes are
decided, individual security selections are generated by digitizing our unique
hexagonal cuboid models.

Unfortunately, it transpires that our hexagonal cuboids are not as unique as we
thought. Hundreds of other hedge funds possess identical dice. The technical
term for this is a "crowded trade.' You may also see it referred to as
"climbing on a bandwagon already headed for the wall.'

As our alpha generation collapses, our beta has turned negative, our delta
hedging has gone toxic and, trust me, you do not want to hear about our gamma.
We can't even find our epsilons in the dark with both hands.

You will appreciate that accurate pricing is essential for evaluating our
investment strategies. This has proven to be extremely challenging in recent
days. Previously, we have relied on Bob, the sales guy at Hokey-Cokey Bank. Bob
assured us the securities were still worth 100 percent of face value, so
everything was cool. Bob sold the collateralized debt obligations to us in the
first place, so he knows what he's talking about.

Bob, however, appears to have had a nervous breakdown, judging by the maniacal
laughter that greeted our requests for price verification this week. Our
efforts to implement an in- house CDO valuation framework, using a technique
the ancients knew as "making things up,' proved unsatisfactory.

Where's the Bid?

Currently, all of the portfolios we manage are undergoing a rigorous screening
known as "crossing our fingers and praying that we don't have to try and find a
bid in the market.' This is supplemented by a cross-market statistical analysis
originally developed by the U.S. military called "don't ask, don't tell.' This
"unmarking-to-unmarket' procedure has been the benchmark for the hedge-fund
industry for the past, ooh, 72 hours.

We have, of course, been in touch with the rating companies to update our
default-probability scenarios, particularly on the AAA rated investments we
own. They recommended a forecasting method using stochastics to regress the
drift-to-downgrade timescales for the past 100 years and throw them forward for
the next five minutes. The technical term for this is "induction,' though those
of you of a less quantitative bent may know it as "guessing.'

AAA or Toast?

We are pleased to report that, contrary to what current market prices might
suggest, all of our top-rated securities remain absolutely AAA. Provided, that
is, the future performance of the underlying collateral is identical to its
history. Otherwise, the rating companies say our investments are likely to be
reclassified as "toast.'

We have also been checking our back-up credit lines with our friends in the
investment-banking world. As soon as they return our calls, we'll be able to
update you on our emergency liquidity position. We are sure they are fine.

Some of you have written to us asking for your money back, citing clauses in
the fund documentation called redemption rights. Frankly, we never expected you
to actually read that prospectus, which came prepackaged when we bought the
Microsoft Hedge-Fund Guy software. We certainly have no idea what all those
long words mean.

We have filed your letters in a special drawer in the filing cabinet marked
"trash' for now. Do you have any idea how much trouble you all would be in if
we actually sold this stuff in the market today? At these crazy prices?
Fuhgeddaboudit. You'll thank us later.

Not a Rescue

Speaking of crazy prices, we know you'll be thrilled to learn that we've
invited a bunch of our rich pals into the fund to participate in this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But this is not a rescue. Do not even think the
word rescue. This is an opportunity. Not a rescue. An opportunity.

In fact, we think this is such a fantastic opportunity, we've agreed to forgo
our usual management fee, and we'll only take half our usual slice of the
profits. Provided there are any profits to slice. You, of course, are
absolutely invited to participate in this offer by sending us yet more of your
money on exactly the same revised terms as our rich pals.

Finally, a word for all of you who have been kind enough to inquire about my
personal financial situation. I am relieved to report that my directors and
officers insurance is fully paid up. Furthermore, my Bentley Continental was
paid out of the 2 percent fee we levied when you wrote your first check to us,
so I will still be able to trundle into the parking lot each morning in an
open-necked shirt to ignore your telephone calls and emails.

Yours, Hedge-Fund Guy.

Disclaimer: I own BAC.
I think BAC made a terrific deal with CFC with the $2 bil. convertible
transaction. It is obviously not without risk, but I like it. They get paid 175
basis points over the rate the Fed is providing at the discount window (BAC
just tapped that to the tune of $500 mil.) with the option to convert (with
restrictions) into stock at $18, or about 22% less than CFC's current quote.

Jim,

Personally, I do average down. Previously I did it in 20% drop increments,
which ensured that I don't get many average-down steps unless the company is
going kaput (here's for your Tolstoy russian... :P). But then, like you I
reevaluate the company at each step averaging down and if I find its balance
sheet deteriorating or investment case changing, I either stop averaging down
or sell the whole position.

I almost never average up though. Which may be a mistake. I know I missed a
bunch of gains this way. But then maybe missed a bunch of subpar returns too -
those are harder to track when you don't average up...

And like Paul (and you?) I have often sold way too early. RTRSY is my most
painful sell. I got it close to bottom in 2002 and sold for marginal gain.
Don't even look where it is right now. :((((((((((((((((

Ah, forgot to comment on retailers. I got a position in LIZ and TLB. TLB I
would hold lightly, since it is not clear if they will get out of their mess. I
have traded it $20-$24 for couple times already and I may do the same again.

I missed to buy AEO on recent drops. I may try to get it still.

With the thought that this store is by all means an not indicator for the
balance of AEO. My daughter informs me that AEO is selling a lot of jeans for
back to school. Style wise, she thinks AEO currently has a good mix. She also
informs me the distressed look is out or headed there. I asked what she meant
by distressed look. She means, holes and rips in the jeans look. The 1980's
dark washed look is inn.

My nephew informs me word is very hush hush about Gilly Hicks the chain A&F is
about to open. He informs me sales have been very good there to, for back to
school.

Sometimes I have to chuckle when I hear they buy their Starbuck's specialty
coffee's and Figi water, but have no money for gas. I guess this is a good
indicator the economy hasn't slowed down enough yet for a cut back.

I've been looking at starting an initial position in SEH Spartech Corp for a LT
value pick. Had a little pop on the Ceo leaving. Waiting for a cool off,
possibly back to the 18 range. IMO-Nice yield for a wait.

OK, color me trader, but I sold TLB again. I looked at TLB second quarter
report and I did not like what I saw there. The market is rather optimistic
that TLB has a bright future, but I am not convinced. They did not have great
results historically except for 2001-2004. And even then their sales were
stagnant, so it is obvious that some idiot decided to grow via J.Jill
acquisition. It may still work out, but it does not look very good right now.
Cash has dropped a lot and though the debt has lessened a bit, there are some
funny "other liabilities" that increased a lot on the balance sheet.

I may rebuy it again, but I am not sure. The trades were in tax deferred
account.

you could be very right about the thrifts. dealing with banks around here, it
looks like things have changed a great deal in banking. At the local branch
level it seems to me people either have no authority or are incompetent. I am
disgruntled with a regional bank where i have my checking account so I looked
at 4-5 state banks who have more of a local presence. I was not impressed with
the personnel that I saw at any of the banks. I didnt see how they were
offering anything more than I could get from an on line or out of state bank.
From the above I surmise that credit scoring has taken over and that
relationship banking is now a foreign concept.

URBN. My market research staff (teen age nieces) like this one also.

My problem is ... my problem. I don't consider the stock a value pick, the
stock being very expensive imo on several metrics.

My research staff also has liked Under Armour and Zumiez. I have dismissed
these two several times because they also are expensive - very much so for a
value investor. I've been correct about that all right, but VERY wrong
nonetheless because I've forgone opportunities to profit from the stocks' rise.
And they have risen:

Ach. The old story. Is it better to have a consistent viewpoint or method that
doesn't sometimes work, or are we here to make money when we can and the
opportunity presents itself?

Maybe I need to reframe the way I view retail stocks, get away from trying to
find value plays in retail, and just faith-base jump in on the recommendations
from my expert research staff who seem to spot the growth opportunities.

As I say, my problem.

Re: Citadel Broadcasting CDL

Citadel Broadcasting sets special dividend
Friday May 25, 2:13 pm ET

The board of directors for Citadel Broadcasting Corp. will pay out a special
dividend of $2.46 to its shareholders upon the closing of its $2.7 billion
purchase of ABC Radio Holdings Inc., according to media reports.

The payout will be for Las Vegas-based Citadel's (NYSE: CDL) shareholders of
record as of June 8. The deal is set to close on on June 12.

Among the stations set to change hands at the close of the deal are KABC-AM and
KLOS-FM in Los Angeles.

ABC Radio is part of Burbank's Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS).

Other than this one-time payment, CDL recent dividends have been .18 in Nov.
2005, March, June, and Oct. 2006, and Feb 2007.

I wouldn't really characterize this record as a company "paying 17%". The data
Yahoo displays on their Summary page often deserves a little more research.

Yeah, it's tough for value (or GARP :)) guys to jump on these growth machines.
They are expensive. And by the time they are not, they may be in trouble. And
then we have to evaluate if the trouble is temporary or not. ;)

Like Chandler said "Trouble's my business" :P

P.S. Yes they are all too expensive for me

Paul, I agree that URBN is a bit pricey right now from a value perspective, but
it has been in the 14's within the past year. That counts as a value using my
metrics. But I wouldn't recommend changing strategies just because you missed a
few, and I certainly don't recommend "faith-based" investing. However...

In my experience, if you identify and keep an eye on well managed, fast growing
retailers with no debt and the ability to fund growth from cash flow, you will
often be able to snap them up at a decent price. My own research staff started
talking this one up when it was in the high 20's in late '05. I watched and
waited, and eventually got a starter position in the high teens and then was
able to load up in the mid teens. Given their fairly credible claim that they
will be doing above 20% growth and above 20% margins for the next few years, I
consider that a good price.

Where we may differ is that I don't look have any absolute limits for P/E, P/S,
P/B or other measures when defining value. For a company like this, or any
company you understand well enough, if you can explain with confidence how it
is going to grow quickly enough to justify the current price, I think that,
say, a P/E in the low 20's can definitely be considered a value.

What do you guys think about CHS? It seems to be somewhat attractive if - IF -
they can sustain their 20% ROE. If not and we assume 15ish ROE going forward,
it's not so attractive. Any opinions?
