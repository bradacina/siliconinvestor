Yes, the chart is about all I like. They continue to lay off people, and
discontinued operations still provide losses. I see no near term catalysts.
Currency translations have also been a problem. Probably just a matter of time
before tangible book and stock price better align with each other. For me, its
probably just a watch list stock for a while, always of interest to see if they
can get out of the mess they are in without a favorable macro uptrend in the

=DJ Fluor Surges As Conoco, Peabody Move Forward On Energy Plant

By Kerry Grace Benn
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Shares of engineering and construction company Fluor
Corp. (FLR) climbed Tuesday on hope the company would get a coal-gasification
contract as part of a plan by ConocoPhillips (COP) and Peabody Energy Corp.
(BTU) to open a coal-to-natural-gas facility in Kentucky.

Earlier Tuesday, Conoco, which already has a joint venture with Fluor, and
Peabody said they got a draft air permit from the state for the plant.

Because of the joint venture, Jefferies & Co. analyst Mike Dudas said the
market is likely thinking Fluor could be a contractor on the project, which he
said could be worth about $3 billion. A contract award might not come for a
while, he warned, though suggested the news would likely get investors excited.

Fluor shares rose 7.9% to $43.70 in recent trading. The stock is off 2.5% so
far this year but is up 1.2% in the last month.

Fluor spokesman Keith Stephens said the company had no comment on the stock
movement.

Conoco and Peabody said the Kentucky NewGas project would be capable of
producing 60 billion to 70 billion cubic feet of pipeline-quality natural gas a
year.

Meanwhile, Fluor peer Foster Wheeler AG (FWLT) announced its own contract award
this morning, Dudas said, calling it a nice win for the company. Foster
Wheeler's stock increased 2.5% to $29.20.

Foster Wheeler said Refineria de Cartagena SA has accepted its offer of a joint
venture for the expansion of its refinery in Cartagena, Colombia.

Dudas said the sector was also helped by crude prices firming above $70. He
added companies like Fluor often benefit from inflation, but said he wouldn't
read too much into U.S. producer price data that came out Tuesday morning,
because other companies tied to inflation were mixed. U.S. producer prices
surged 1.8% and industrial production rose 0.8% in November, bringing inflation
worries to the surface. Inflation often benefits commodity prices.

Other peers including Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC) and Shaw Group Inc.
(SHAW) also rose, with Jacobs up 3.4% at $36.83 and Shaw up 3% at $30.08.
=============================================================
These sticks could also be "Global Warming" plays especially with the U.N.
climate conference ending Friday.

http://www.alternet.org/rss/the_wire_provided_by_huffington_post/100300/evelyn_

"If you look at countries like India and China...which are highly reliant on
coal I really don't see us coming to grips with climate change at a global
level without nuclear energy playing a role," said Yvo de Boer, the UN climate
chief at the current climate conference in Copenhagen. But he told reporters
that nuclear energy could only play a major role "if we can deal with issues of
safety, if we can deal with issues of waste and if we can find people that
actually want one of these things in their backyard."

I wonder how long the internet retailers will be able to mostly avoid state

collect partially (i.e., Amazon).

Given tight state budgets and growing internet sales, I am sure there will be
more pressure to find a way to capture this lost revenue.

RE: VZ

In spite of their balance sheet, I started a small position in Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ). I am mainly looking at their 5.7% dividend vs the
1.25% I am now receiving at my credit union. I do think that their wireless
franchise is solid. There forward PE is around 13 which is a reasonable price
to pay for a growing franchise (especially as the Apple Iphone exclusive deal
w/ T ends soon). It seems that everybody has some type of cell phone with large
monthly bills (including the revenue streams they generate from texting).

I own some AT&T and thought Verizon would make a good addition to provide me
some more exposure to the industry.

I am not sure what impact the new Google phone will have on the industry. It
may just allow VZ to expand their prepaid service offering or even tailor a new
type of bundled package that includes their FIOS cable like service.

I am targeting a $35.00/share price which is right around their 50wk MA (or
about 6% under the MA). T is selling 14% under their 50wk MA which also may
present a value opportunity. I now own both with twice as much T vs VZ. Will
average into more VZ over time to obtain equal weighting of each that will
leave me with a 2% portfolio exposure to this sector.

First post for me in quite a while.

I am disposed to buy good values. My observation is that some on this board
seem to be trading a lot in and out. That cost of commissions, covering the
spreads on in and out transaction, and possible taxes, is a high expense to
overcome. Still good luck to all who try.

Here are some general ideas. Any responses welcome, or alternate ideas welcome.

I have looked at high dividend mutual funds. Almost all of them are eating
capital, so I do not not screen for them anymore. Also many of these are high
cost.

I have looked at closed end funds selling at large discounts. I rarely have
purchased them. When I have it has been more as a trading move, to sell when
the discount narrowed. Here is the problem with holding closed end funds. Say a
fund has NAV of 100 but trades at 80. Let us say long term the market grows at
8%, and the fund matches that growth. So, your NAV goes up 8%, which equates to
10% on your purchase price. You are getting an extra 2%. But almost invariably
these closed end funds are charging 2% or more in fees. So you are not really
getting ahead. The harder you have to look to find the expense ratio, the
higher it is. I gave up trying to figure out how much the expense is in GLAD,
which was recommended on this board at 30% discount. What is their expense? I
suspect well over 2%. Another problem with closed end funds is that computation
of NAV may be subject to interpretation, another issue with GLAD.

Now I have found ADX, a closed end fund that has been around for a long time
and seems to have management with integrity. They sell at a 15% discount, and
historically their expense ratio has been less than .5%. Now it is around .8%,
but they indicate that is short term and will recede. So this one looks good
and I am thinking about it.

One can look at industries. I have always stayed away from airlines for my
whole investment career. They lose money, have ruinous unions, and invariably
declare bankruptcy every 10 years or so. That might be overstating the case,
but I still have the strong opinion on airlines and if I live to 100 I do not
think I will ever buy one.

I have recently invested heavily in REIT preferred in my IRA's. I think REIT's
should be held in IRA's or 401K's, best of all in a ROTH IRA. Since their
dividends have higher tax rates, a non-sheltered investor will discount the
dividends in comparison to dividends of other industries, such as utilities.
But to an IRA holder, that is a non-consideration. Think about it: A REIT
preferred paid into a ROTH IRA is giving you income that is never taxed, not at
the REIT level and not at your level. It is similar to the idea of muni bonds.
Those are the domain of high rate taxpayers. REIT's are the natural domain of
IRAs, 401ks.

REIT preferred have already made a big move off their bottom. But you can still
pick up over 7% in pretty safe REIT's like O-E, and 8% in decent REIT's like
HRP-D and AIV-U. DDT is a bond trust but really is more like a REIT preferred
if you look into it, and it yields nearly 10%. Of course you figure there is
some risk here, but in my opinion reasonable.

I generally pick individual stocks after considering various ratios, such as
dividend yield, PE, PS, stockholder equity (market cap less debt), and a long
period of company press releases and stories on the company. I tend to look at
micro-caps, because that is where you have the better chance of finding an
overlooked prospect. I much prefer a long history. I do sometime invest in
flash in the pans, but it really has to have a good story. And these micro-cap
stocks tend to have larger bid-ask spreads, so that is another reason I try to
refrain from trading in and out.

Speaking of good stories, that leads me to another factor. One factor I mean to
consider but too often overlook is management integrity. I do not trust
managers that raid the piggy bank with too high bonuses and stock options,
especially repriced options. Those without integrity will lie, carefully of
course, but still lie. And there are many managers who do. You have to be
alert. It probably is a good idea to get out of any company when you just ask
yourself: "Is this guy maybe lying to us?" I guess it is too much to expect a
manager to say: "We have second-rate products, the competition is eating our
lunch, we are pushing the pipeline to make sales look good, and we sit around
the water-cooler joking about what shmucks shareholders are, while we talk
about what vacations we will have on our bonuses based on optimistic
financials."

For stocks I own, I would recommend IRIS. Solid financials, good ratios, and
they are hopefully about to have a new valuable product approved to detect with
ultra-precision PSA levels post prostatectomy, to determine whether chemo/rad
is even necessary (no PSA at all means no treatment needed). I think management
is somewhat inept as financial men, but they seem honest and their science
seems right.

Another stock that intrigues me is CPWM, cost plus world market. I like the
stores and buy some there. But they are losing money and could be BK, although
it appears they have a good shot on downsizing and surviving. What intrigues me
is the Cost-sales ratio which is .03! If they can get through the great
recession and turn the company around, there is a great potential on the
upside.

Welcome back, Jeoffrey Wren. Thanks for your update.

I still try to look at every stock mentioned here. (A few slip by though.)

Generally, I'm not commenting on stocks that don't to me seem like value buys
or that I otherwise have no interest in. That'd be something like IRIS, which,
having a p/e of 22-27, roe under 10%, p/b of 2.5, is a stock I will want to

decide to stop paying the dividend that is the recourse? now the stock craters

Geoffrey,

You talk good talk and I agree with most of your points. :) Yes, a lot of high
dividend mutual funds are traps for people who don't understand where the
payout is coming from. Yes, CEF NAV discounts are probably not tradeable and
they CEFs charge a lot. Yes, management integrity is important. Yes, airlines
are terrible investments and I will never own one (I'd say I won't own a bank
or insurance company, but unfortunately I do already... ;)). Yeah, micro caps
are great. Yeah, long profitable history is great. :)

BUT... :))))

BUT... :))))

Then you turn around and give us two stock selections where one is close to BK
and losing money for last 4 years and the other one has mixed history with low
ROE and perhaps something that you believe as a story. Sorry, this is a let
down. :)

I'll answer your comment that we (I) perhaps trade too much. Yes, I bought a
lot and sold a lot this year. However, it was a year when prices fluctuated
more than couple-baggers for a lot of stocks. They also fluctuated for couple
baggers for a lot of preferreds that you mention. And currently prices are not
terribly attractive. So I understand your rather tepid (IMHO) picks. I don't
have huge, great, wonderful screaming buys on my list either. I am still buying
things - and selling things. Prices are not in a huge bubble land, but neither
they are freebie steals. :)

Take care and don't take this comment too seriously. ;)

Actually I mentioned I believe six stocks.

As to CMWM, I think I was clear that I was not in the stock and was considering
it only as a speculative play, with upside that might be greater value than the
risk of BK. I do not think I would get in unless I saw some sort of inflection
point, but it could happen.

As to IRIS, they are plowing a lot of operating profit into their new product
development. For instance in the last nine months their income before income
taxes was $8,310,000, and this was after spending $8,010,000 on research and
development. Also, their profit margins are set to improve since they are
selling more consumables for their placed machines.

Another theme I have besides no airlines is yes to health care in some form or
another. It is just going to grow overall no matter what Congress does. So this
is one other reason I am inclined to look positively on IRIS. Also I have owned
it for 11 years, so feel I understand the company.

But I could be wrong of course. Heck I look at 20 stocks for every one I come
close to buying. So I understand anyone passing on anything I mention. If you
are not comfortable with it, pass.

One stock mentioned here recently was RPT, an REIT I had not looked into
before. I looks pretty good at first glance and I will look into it further.

Good investing to all.

Hi Paul - I can not understand the excitement to buy (or even touch) C even if

their 60 million secondary at $13.00. It was over subscribed and new buyers
still find the stock attractive now at $14.00. If I wanted a bank stock, I
would still buy this one over C as the 7% dividend is safe and most analyst
upgrades see the stock fairly valued at $16.00/share.

I would only touch C AFTER a 30:1 reverse split. If WFC has a reverse split, I

LYG -
currently trading at 51pence with tangible book at 64 pence. LYG is the largest
UK bank (in terms of domestic market share after the ill fated takeover of
HBOS). They recently did a secondary for their common and a debt exchange that
boosted core Tier 1 to 8.2% (or thereabouts) to enable them to escape the asset
protection plan setup from the government (mostly for HBOS legacy assets) .
There are a couple of presentations in LYG's website regarding the capital
offering - you will get more info if you are/claim not to be an US citizen :-).

LYG right now seems to me like buying BAC at 8$. there are a lot of parallels -
extraordinary help from the government, ill fated takeover but a sound core
franchise with high domestic market share. Writeoffs are supposed to tail off
if you believe management. Not without risk but if indeed the UK economy
stabilizes and recovers this should take off. I bought a tiny position today
and look to buy more.

this was a decently managed outfit but the HBOS (HBOS was 2x Lloyd's size at
the time of the takeover) was a huge mistake that almost did them in. now I
think we are close to a bottom and they should have enough capital to survive.

When the report of a delayed filing hit in November, I exited before any harm

loss is unlikely to be large enough to offset the huge discount to tangible

Small banks. "I agree there are many opportunities in this sector"

Delving into this, I ask myself how do these banks propose to make their
profits?

To check what services these banks might provide, I randomly picked number 7 on
the list. It turns out to be BankAtlantic, a stock I once owned and at one time
almost got thrown off somebody's thread for suggesting it was an inappropriate
"investment" for the person. Anyway to quickly move on, I'll pick #10 too:

Here are their businesses, which I assume are similar for all the others.

https://www.bankatlantic.com/default.html

https://www.sterlingsavingsbank.com/personal_banking/personal_home.aspx

Basically, these small banks seem to have businesses that involve credit cards
and atms, making commercial and business loans (for those banks structured that
way), and...what I am interested in --> making mortgage loans.

In past, it seems to me (I have no facts), that the bulk of their profits has
come from mortgages, esp. home mortgages and refinancing. Not so much from
money management or their issuing CD's or having ATMs, and maybe not so much
from other business/commercial aspects.

Therefore, if someone is buying these small banks, they seem --to me-- to be
making a bet that the housing sector will still be important, and that these
local banks might really succeed going forward, if the housing industry
prospers too.

Well, I'm one who is looking to again reenter the housing stocks. That sector
seems very much out of favor. Not too many positive people betting on housing
stocks.

If bets are willing to be made on some of these small banks pulling through,
then imo, some housing stocks ought to be considered as well at this time. And
I'm just in the process of doing that.

re small/regional banks:

they make money from
a) commercial RE loans
b) single family mortgages (conformal mortgages are mostly sold to
Fannie/Freddie,non-conformal (Jumbo etc.) are kept
c) small business lending
d) consumer lending
e) wealth management

The commercial RE loans are the biggest trouble spots because most of the
single family mortgages are sold off. I'd prefer to see banks involved in small
business lending (probably the biggest opportunity right now) and wealth
management.

Many banks out there that trade below tangible book and are profitable with
decent asset quality (at least judging by the non-performing asset ratios).

I keep reading that the next shoe to drop is commercial real estate. (-g- How

If commercial is in trouble, the small banks may have further difficulty.

If the business of the banks is also to make mortgage loans and they are okay
for the bank because they are sold off, then that's okay for me by my
reckoning, because someone is buying those mortgages. Which means houses can
and are being bought.

That's unlike the last cycle where I started with several, and eventually came
to have shares in about nine or more.

For the small banks, their balance sheets are difficult for me to understand,
and their lending issues may be specific to their region - which I would have
no clue about. I suppose a package of these would see a couple of decent
gainers, and that might make the basket of buys worthwhile. If someone posts
their package of actual buys, I'll consider. Doubtful I'll act though, given
other opportunities I see.

Jmo, I could be very wrong.

The impression that I have gotten from banks in my neighborhood that i have
talked too over the last couple of years is that hey are poorly equipped to
make credit decisions regarding loans. this is what I did and trained others to
do for many years. Now at the small loan level everything seems to revolve
around collateral valuation and credit scoring. I realize now that over 20
years ago the mid size bank that i worked for in new york decided that it would
no longer make loans under $100,000 on a note basis, they would be handled as
consumer installment notes.
The local banks here seem unable to make loans unless they fit into some well
defined categories. mortgage, auto, credit card, home equity.

Hello GW,

I have monitored ADX for a while as a closed-end fund selling at a discount and
it definitely seems like a decent play. I'd rather own a closed-end fund like
this than a 401k mutual fund not selling at a discount.

At the time I was seriously considering buying closed-end funds, I ended up
buying CET, which hasn't worked out incredibly for me, but I'm still holding.

I think there's a place for closed-end funds selling at a discount in anyone's
portfolio. But, I tend to find other individual stocks with greater potential
(in my perception) whenever I consider close-end funds. But, ADX is one I will
probably end up in eventually.

Thanks for the ideas.

ADX is pretty bland to me. It always trades at a discount to NAV, so one would
only realize some or all of this discount were it to be liquidated. And, as I
understand it, there would be some cap. gains consequences were it to be
liquidated (and, I don't think that will happen, as this one has been around
since 1926).
It has a slight bias to the energy sector, given that an energy sector fund
(which has a relationship to ADX) is its biggest holding. So, one should be
comfortable with exposure to the energy sector.
I have not dug deeply enough to figure out how levered ADX is.
Essentially, if this is your mutual fund of choice, so be it. Overlay a chart
of the S&P 500 for the last ten years, and ADX has pretty significantly
underperformed this benchmark (but I will admit to not knowing how the special
distributions, which seem to happen annually, would affect this).
This apparent underperformance to the S&P 500 would rule it out for me, but
that's JMHO.

OK Paul - Thanks for the heads up on the Pharma. Pulled the sell order on SNY
and will hold (Forward PE is low as you point out). Sold out of my JNJ to book
my profit instead. Hedged my BMY selling June $27 covered calls. Will look to
sell my LLY after their divi or at least hedge the position. The patent concern
is a bit over done and is known by the market but one can get caught chasing
the high dividend yields too. BMY is raising cash by selling their interest in
Mead Johnson (their swap bid was over subscribed). They plan to use this cash
to buy a biotech or pharma company w/ a big drug pipeline. LLY is a different
case and I am now a bit concerned it might be a value trap.

These drug and pharma companies are difficult to value. In the 90's anything
with a PE <20 was a steal and now most of these companies sell at 10PE or less.
I try to hold a basket of these companies and book my log term profits as they
are generated. I like to re-deploy the funds when the news is bad or the sector
is over sold (especially if I can buy at a PE <10).

My portfolio only has 7% exposure to the pharmaceutical sector and I should
probably build this up to 10%. I have not been very successful with my health
care stock picks over the years and have concluded that many of the typical
value measures just do not work. Experience has taught me to buy the larger
companies that pay a dividend and book your long term profits from time to
time. These companies can hit a land mine from a lawsuit, get whacked from new
government legislation or enter into a stupid and/or expensive merger
agreement. Many of these things do not benefit the long term shareholder.

Banks - i use the Bankrate safe and sound rating as a first gage. they also
have a breakdown of the safety factors available
when you click at the * rating.
http://www.bankrate.com/rates/safe-sound/bank-ratings-search.aspx

This is from a depositors point of view but it still is a good indication of an
institution's health.

There are about 8200 institutions in this list (82 pages/approx 100 each). I
found this number when looking for 1*+ rated institutions , which are all of
them. Anything rated 1* only is deathwatch (IMO) and 2* is pretty bad too. I
would not touch any stock rated less than 3*.

There are 12 pages of institutions rated 1* only or roughly 1200 of them. I
think the Fed guys closing down banks are going to have some work cut out for
them.

Anyways, looking at the Bankrate safe and sound rating is the first thing I do
when looking at a bank stock. Quick and dirty, I admit but with so many to
choose from why bother with questionable cases?

There is also a Bauer financial rating but it does not provide any details
(unless you pay for a report), so I think it's less useful.

Sanofi-Aventis to Buy Chattem for About $1.9 Billion

From the article:...Drug maker Sanofi-Aventis S.A. said it has agreed to buy
U.S. consumer health-care company Chattem Inc. for about $1.9 billion in cash
in a deal it said would create the world's fifth-largest consumer health-care
company..."

------------------------------------------------------------------

It looks like a 33% premium over Friday's close Chattem Inc. (CHTT)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CHTT
Their offer is at 18x analysts estimated forward earnings. The price to sales
is 4x ($458M/$1.9B) definitely NOT a "value" buy.

Chattem, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the manufacture and
marketing of over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare products, toiletries, and
dietary supplements.

This purchase is similar to JNJ's 6/2006 acquisition of PFE consumer
health-care where they paid $16.6 billion. SNY's purchase is only 28% the size
of JNJ's when adjusted for market cap and purchase price.

BMY,

I take it you didn't participate in the BMY tender into MJN. In my experience,
those tenders usually work out pretty well. I have found that a 10% edge
(although it ended up trading down to a 5% edge) usually works and is
especially good if you are thinking about exiting the position anyway.

My BMY shares convert to $27 worth of MJN shares as of current market prices.
Who knows where it will end up by the time I get my MJN shares, but I'll take
my chances.

Sure, MJN is not a stock I'd normally own, but these tenders have pretty

This is from optionseducation.org, the subject - Options Strategies:Covered
Call

Benefit
While this strategy can offer limited protection from a decline in price of the
underlying stock and limited profit participation with an increase in stock
price, it generates income because the investor keeps the premium received from
writing the call. At the same time, the investor can appreciate all benefits of
underlying stock ownership, such as dividends and voting rights, unless he is
assigned an exercise notice on the written call and is obligated to sell his
shares. The covered call is widely regarded as a conservative strategy because
it decreases the risk of stock ownership.

Winmill (WNMLA),

Here is a blast from the past. Management seems ethically challenged, but quite
an interesting 13D/A came out today --- a nice shot across the bow IMO. I had
bought a little WNMLA this year on a spec hunch after selling it a couple years
back. It seems way undervalued to book value (although we don't really know
what book value is now), but management doesn't seem to care about its
shareholders.

I myself had thought about writing a letter requesting that they provide
shareholders some information. Mr. Abella wrote something far better than
anything I could have come up with. I have pasted the excerpt below, but anyone
interested probably should refer to the SEC filing itself.

Note that anyone else who still owns the stock might also want to pester the
company to actually do its job and provide shareholders relevant information.

Attention: Mr. Thomas Winmill President
Winmill & Co. Incorporated
11 Hanover Square

Re: Transparency and Corporate Governance Issues

Dear Mr. Winmill,

Clients of my firm, Investment Partners Asset Management, own 86,845 Class A
shares of Winmill & Company Incorporated (“Winmill or “the Company”). As I
write this letter, we are in the midst of the holiday season of 2009. For those
running companies whose shares trade publicly, I would expect the end of the
year would be a time to remember the valuable relationships with stockholders
and clients, evaluate past performance, and plan for the future.

Unfortunately, as 2009 draws to a close, outside, minority shareholders of
Winmill have not heard from you this year… or last year for that matter. In
fact, you have not updated your outside Class A shareholders with consolidated
information since November of 2007 (25 months ago) when you released Winmill’s
Third-Quarter 2007 financial results. Given the financial crisis of the past 2
years and the increased scrutiny and skepticism of financial institutions
during that same period, it is uncertain as to why you have not been more
communicative. One expects that a responsible board in this environment would
proactively assure investors that measures are being taken to improve
operations, grow revenues and enhance shareholder value. To date, though, there
has not yet been any message from your management directly to its outside
minority shareholders during this tumultuous period. With the stock, according
to the last-sale price on the pink sheets from December 16, 2009 at $2.25 (down
from more than $6.00 roughly two years ago), the current market capitalization
of the Company is only about $3.71 million – representing only a fraction of my
estimate of Winmill’s tangible book value.

Additionally, beyond just the lack of transparency of your holding company, a
deeper analysis of some of Winmill’s funds and affiliated companies seems to
show a past strategy of converting open-end funds into closed-end funds, and
converting closed-end funds into operating companies. It also appears that a
number of your affiliated entities have de-listed from national exchanges
and/or de-registered as public companies. These entities also seem to rely on
provisions of Maryland Law and other anti-takeover provisions to entrench
management - possibly benefiting insiders of those entities at the expense of
their outside minority shareholders. As you know, Maryland Law (and
specifically the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act) can limit the rights
of outside investors to the degree they own over 10% of an issuer’s outstanding
shares, and thus can limit outside shareholders’ ability to effect change –
even if change may be called for. Since the tactics above can favor the
interests of management rather than the interests of outside minority
shareholders of your affiliated companies, I fear these corporate governance
characteristics may be impacting the market value of those companies’ shares,
and thus indirectly affecting the market value of Winmill’s shares.

Analysis of Available Information

Affiliates of Winmill:

Tuxis Corporation (“Tuxis”, formerly Bull & Bear Municipal Income Fund) is
approximately 24% owned by Winmill. According to Tuxis’ annual reports and SEC
filings, in late 1996 a diversified series of shares issued by Bull & Bear
Municipal Securities, Inc. (an open-end management investment company organized
under Maryland Law in 1983) converted to a closed-end fund named Bull & Bear
Municipal Income Fund, also organized under Maryland Law. In 1998 the Bull &
Bear Municipal Income Fund changed its name to Tuxis. In 2001, the board of
Tuxis approved of a new investment policy to own through internal development
or acquisition majority stakes in new and small businesses, including
privately-owned companies, with an emphasis on real estate. In 2004, Tuxis
applied to de-register as a closed-end fund and in 2005 it was granted
de-registration. In 2007 Tuxis’ shares were de-listed from a national exchange
and it de-registered as a public company with the SEC. Among the reasons cited
for this decision were the ongoing costs and expenses of remaining listed on
the American Stock Exchange (“AMEX”). Tuxis’ most current financial information
is from September of 2009 when it showed a book value of $6,968,254. Tuxis’
cumulative rental income from its properties over the past 5 and 3/4 reported
fiscal years does not reach $750,000. Despite Tuxis’ stated desire to reduce
certain expenses, Tuxis has incurred nearly $3.89 million worth of expenses
during the past 5 and 3/4 years (with the largest percentage being salaries.)
Even though Tuxis’ stated book value at September 30, 2009 was more than $6.9
million, its market capitalization at its last-sale share price of $1.28 on
November 19, 2009 (according to the quote in the pink sheets) is only about
$1.3 million - a discount to book value of about 80%. Since October 5, 2005
when Tuxis was granted de-registration as an investment company, its share
price is down approximately 85%, while its stated book value has decreased by
about 19% during the same period.

Bexil Corporation (“Bexil”, formerly Bull & Bear Government Securities Fund) is
approximately 25% owned by Winmill. According to Bexil’s annual reports and SEC
filings, Bull & Bear Government Securities Fund, which previously had been a
series of Bull & Bear Funds II (an open-end mutual fund), in 1996 converted to
a stand-alone closed-end fund organized under Maryland Law. In 1999 Bull & Bear
Government Securities Fund changed its name to Bexil Corporation. In December
1999 the board changed the investment objective from purely government-oriented
income securities to include equity and other securities of selected growth
companies and in companies that invest or deal in natural resources or
commodities. In 2000, the board again adopted a new investment policy to own
through internal development or acquisition majority stakes in new and small
businesses, including privately-owned companies. In 2002 Bexil filed to
de-register, and in 2004 Bexil was granted de-registration as a closed-end
fund. Bexil purchased a stake in York Insurance Services Group in 2002 and sold
that asset in 2006 for $38,864,121. Upon entering the agreement to sell that
asset in 2005, $815,625 in bonuses were awarded to employees, and upon
consummation of the sale of that asset $1,909,228 in bonuses were paid to Bexil
employees. Bexil’s total expenses in 2006 were $3,452,332, with the largest
percentage being employee-related costs. In 2007 Bexil’s shares were de-listed
from a national exchange (AMEX) and it de-registered with the SEC as a public
company. Among the reasons cited for this decision were the ongoing costs and
expenses of remaining listed on the AMEX. Bexil’s most current financial
information is from September of 2009 when it showed a book value of
$38,146,124. Despite Bexil’s stated desire to reduce certain expenses, from
fiscal 2007 through the 3rd quarter of 2009 (while Bexil had not yet purchased
a stake in an operating business) it incurred $3,339,993 worth of expenses
(with the largest percentage being salaries.) During the first quarter of 2009,
Bexil provided for a loan for insiders to purchase $2,366,933 worth of Bexil
stock under options for which Bexil does not appear to have yet received any
cash proceeds. The transaction appears to have given Bexil insiders (who
previously only had stock options) actual ownership of more than 100,000 shares
at a weighted average price of around $21.95, while book value per share at
that time exceeded $38.00. While there is likely a benefit to insiders of Bexil
personally, it is not apparent how such a transaction benefits outside minority
Bexil shareholders directly or outside minority Winmill shareholders
indirectly. Though Bexil’s stated book value at September 30, 2009 was
approximately $38.1 million, its market capitalization at its last-sale share
price on December 15, 2009 of $22.40 (according to the quote in the pink
sheets) is only about $22.5 million - a discount to book value of more than
35%. Since January 6, 2004, when Bexil was granted de-registration as an
investment company, its share price is up about 36%, while its stated book
value has increased by approximately 151% during the same period.

Foxby Corp. (“Foxby”, formerly Internet Growth Fund Inc.) is approximately 24%
owned by Winmill. (As you know, our clients also have a minority position in
Foxby.) Foxby is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
organized under Maryland Law. In 2003 Internet Growth Fund changed its name to
Foxby Corp. In 2008 this fund lost 63.27% of its value and de-listed from the
AMEX to trade in the pink sheets. Foxby’s asset value has recovered somewhat in
2009, but due to its loss in 2008, it is currently among the smallest (if not
the smallest) of closed-end funds. It also has among the widest discounts to
asset value of any closed-end fund. For the first time since its inception,
Foxby has not scheduled an annual shareholder meeting where investors can voice
their concerns. As of 9/30/2009 Foxby’s net asset value was $3,993,377 but its
market capitalization was $2,818,854 – a discount of nearly 30%. Foxby has a
staggered board of directors and relies upon the Maryland Control Share
Acquisition Act (which, as referenced above, can serve as a
management-entrenchment tool). At yesterday’s closing share price of $0.92,
Foxby is trading at a about a 43% discount to its net asset value.

Based upon the financial information above, the value of Winmill’s holdings in
affiliates taken as a percentage of the stated book value of each of those
holdings, as best as I can tell, is approximately $12 million (or roughly $7.20
per share), but given the discounts to book value that these companies trade
at, the market value of Winmill’s holdings of these companies is only about $7
million (or about $4.20 per share).

Assets Under Management:

From the quarterly reports of the various Winmill funds, it appears that assets
under management as of 9/30/09 are as follows:
State of
Open-end Funds Net Assets Incorporation Form of Fund / Trading Venue

Midas Fund (as of 9/30/09) $102,755,656 MD open-end
Midas Special Fund (as of 9/30/09) $ 10,944,398 MD open-end
Midas Perpetual Portfolio (as of 9/30/09) $ 7,686,396 MD open-end

Closed-end Funds

Global Income Fund (as of 9/30/09) $ 31,785,423 MD delisted from AMEX 2007 -
(formerly a series of Bull & Bear Funds II – trades on the Pink Sheets an
open-end fund until 1997)

Foxby Corp (as of 9/30/09) $ 3,993,377 MD delisted from AMEX 2008 -
(formerly Internet Growth Fund Inc.trades on the Pink Sheets
until 2003)

There are various metrics for valuing assets under management, but I suspect
that more than $150 million spread over 5 funds should add at least something
to the franchise value of Winmill, and that value does not appear to be
reflected currently in Winmill’s stock price.

Questions

The above is basically the extent of the information that I could discern from
what your funds and affiliates have disclosed. But there are many questions
which remain unanswered which would be beneficial for shareholders to know when
analyzing their investment in Winmill. Such questions include, but are not
limited to:

What are the revenues and expenses of the advisory business?
What is the status of the 5-year 500,000 share buy-back program commenced in
July 2006?
What is the current cash-surrender value of the key-man life insurance
policies, and are these policies still in effect?
Were the promissory notes of $390,000 from December 12, 2006 (in connection
with employee stock options exercises) repaid?
Are there any negative developments which should be disclosed to shareholders
(lawsuits, regulatory matters, etc.)?
Does your firm plan to convert any of its open end funds to closed-end funds?
If so, would they trade on the pink sheets as your current closed-end funds do?
Does your firm plan to change the investment objectives for its closed-end
funds, de-register them as funds, switch them to operating companies, or
de-register them as public companies?
Given the depressed share price, is Winmill re-issuing (or have you already
re-issued) employee stock options? A number of the current outstanding stock
options appear to be expiring during 2009.
Given the discounts to book value that Winmill and its affiliates’ shares trade
at, have insiders of these companies been utilizing these low valuations to
effect inter-generational transfers of stock for estate-planning purposes?
Would the company and/or its affiliated entities benefit from consolidation in
order to reduce costs and improve economies of scale?

Possible Impact on Shareholders of Your Company’s Lack of Transparency

The company’s lack of communication and transparency are somewhat confusing
since you state on your website that “one of (your) guiding principles is that
(you) will communicate with (your) shareholders as candidly as possible because
(you) believe shareholders benefit from understanding (your) corporate
philosophy and approach.” When you issued an 8-K filing on July 13, 2004
explaining your rationale for delisting Winmill’s shares from the Nasdaq you
stated that “delisting and deregistration will allow management to focus its
resources on implementing the Company's business plan and thus position the
Company to enhance long-term stockholder value. The Company intends to update
its stockholders with financial information on a regular basis.” As mentioned
before, you have not provided shareholders with updated consolidated financial
information in a timely or regular fashion for the past two years, even though
your website and your 8-K seem to suggest otherwise. Incidentally, with respect
to your goal of enhancing long-term stockholder value, I note that Winmill’s
closing share price when you announced Winmill’s delisting and deregistration
on July 13, 2004 was $4.02. As of this writing, more than 5 years later,
according to the last-sale price on the pink sheets, Winmill’s shares are
$2.25. Maybe resuming a timely release of information would improve the
depressed price for the stock at least to some degree.

Possible Impact on Market Participants of Your Company’s Lack of Transparency

Beyond the frustration of performing due diligence given the lack of current
consolidated financial information, there are possibly other effects of
Winmill’s lack of transparency. According to rule 15c2-11 investment firms
making a market in your shares are required to maintain reasonably current
financial information. Specifically, according to rule 15c2-11, the balance
sheet information in the market makers’ files should be no older than 16
months, and the statements of profit and loss and retained earnings should be
for the 12 months preceding the date of such balance sheet. While you have a
tab on your company’s website to provide 15c2-11 information to market
participants, your financial information is too stale for the market makers to
adhere to the rule under normal circumstances. The only way that market makers
currently appear to be able to continue to provide an active trading market for
Winmill’s shares is for them to rely on piggy-back exceptions of rule 15c2-11.
It’s possible that this is the reason that there are now only 7 market makers
of your stock, compared to the 10 market makers discussed in your 2006 annual
report.

Bottom Line:

Your company still has a publicly-traded stock, and you have a fiduciary
obligation to enhance shareholder value. Due diligence for shareholders is a
continual process, and to that end, I request that you immediately release
Winmill’s consolidated annual reports for 2007 and 2008, as well as resume
quarterly updates. Furthermore, you should hold an annual meeting where
shareholders can have a productive dialogue to voice their concerns, better
understand your company’s approach, and hear about your strategy for creation
of shareholder value. Also, your affiliated companies and funds should consider
abandoning the protection provisions of Maryland Law (specifically the Maryland
Control Share Acquisition Act) and any other poison pill provisions, as I
suspect that these limitations on shareholders’ rights may be contributing to
the discounts to book value of these companies’ share prices. For similar
reasons, I also think you should consider re-listing the shares of your holding
company, closed-end funds, and affiliates on national exchanges - or at least
move them up to a higher tier on the bulletin board, such as the OTCQX.
Finally, in order to represent the interests of the outside minority
shareholders, you should consider appointing an independent outside individual
to Winmill’s board of directors. To ensure independence, that new board member
should be someone who is unaffiliated with your firm, its affiliates, its
employees, or employees’ family members.

I am interested in seeing Winmill’s share price more accurately reflect the
value of the company’s enterprise, and would expect that you also share this
goal. Therefore, as 2009 closes, I would like to see Winmill’s board take this
opportunity to improve communication and enact strategies to create value for
the company’s outside minority shareholders.

Regards,

Gregg Abella

Hi McSweet - Interesting 13D/A.... The filing party is a 5.29% equity owner.
Wonder if he will get a response from management? Is it management that
determines when to close the fund(s) and liquidate the proceeds for
distribution to the equity holders?

http://www.pinksheets.com/edgar/GetFilingHtml?FilingID=6953318
From the filing:"...The purpose of the acquisition is investment. The reporting
person may from time to time recommend actions to the issuer’s board of
directors or management for the purpose of increasing the market value of the
issuer’s shares generally. A letter to the issuer’s board of directors, dated
and sent December 22, 2009, is attached as an exhibit hereto. That letter urges
the issuer to release its consolidated annual reports for 2007 and 2008, as
well as to resume quarterly updates; to hold an annual meeting of shareholders;
and to consider appointing an independent outside individual to the board of
directors. The letter also asks that the issuer’s affiliates consider
abandoning the protection provisions of Maryland Law (specifically the Maryland
Control Share Acquisition Act) and any other poison pill provisions...."

":: INSIDER TRADING WARNING

This company may not be making material information publicly available.

If you are an affiliate, employee, insider, or any person in possession of
nonpublic material information about this company, please be advised that
buying or selling this security may constitute trading "on the basis of"
material nonpublic information prohibited under Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 10b5-1 thereunder. Violators of these
laws are subject to civil and criminal penalties.

What is insider trading?

Illegal insider trading refers generally to buying or selling a security, in
breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, while
in possession of material, nonpublic information about the security.

Rule 10b5-1 provides that a person trades on the basis of material nonpublic
information if that person is "aware" of the material nonpublic information at
the time of the purchase or sale.

Affiliates, insiders, relatives, or other persons in possession of material
information should use extreme caution when buying or selling securities on the
basis of material information, particularly in securities where the company is
not making adequate current information publicly available as a matter of
practice.

Why is Pink OTC displaying this warning?

Companies that are identified on pinksheets.com as having “No Information” may
be placing their shareholders at risk of violating 10b5-1 insider trading
rules. Pink OTC Markets recommends that investors wishing to place a trade in
such securities contact the company to verify it is making adequate current

ouch! I hate these companies with sleazy management. I invested in one such
company which shall remain nameless. I carefully looked at their investments
and the company seemed very cheap, unfortunately the company has not released
any financial info in about 3 years, the stock has lost 95% of its value and I
have no idea what the **** they are doing. The problem with this type of
company is that all the assets can sucked out through less than hands on
transactions and the investor becomes a bag holder. The same situation to a
lesser extent happened with Endeavour Financial. They used to release decent if
not great info, but after they cajoled investor into authorizing the purchase
of the investment bank, they provide minimal information, which hast cost
shareholders big bucks. Im holding on in the hope that eventually they will
want to cash out their shares and start providing info in order to lift the
share price, but its not a confident position and Im not holding my breath

Thanks for WNMLA report, MCsweet. I likely wouldn't have seen it otherwise.

In since '07, I'm underwater on my shares. Stock seems undervalued based on
numbers that were available then, and I suspect stock is still undervalued.

However with apparent continuing obfuscation by management, the small

Hi Grommit - Followed you in on GOVERNMENT PROPERTIE (NYSE: GOV). Will be
selling my HRPpB next week and wanted to hedge my lost 8.75% preferred dividend
with a safe high dividend payer. GOV is a good candidate as it yields 6.9%. GOV
is the spin off of all of HRP government properties back in June 2009. The new
dividend will be "qualified" and GOV stock should grow in value especially as
the government sector grows.

I no longer own HRP common but am looking at starting a new position if there
is a sell off below $6.00/share. For now GOV looks like a safe place to park
some funds.

Peeled off a few shares of BHP. Stock up 2.7% today and approaching both a 52wk
high and 10% from an all time high. This is my number one position in the
portfolio and after today's sale still remains my no 1 position (10% more than
my No. 2 - AAUK). Need to whittle down the shares and reallocate the proceeds
into other sectors.

I don't think there is a whole lot of near term risk here besides a languishing

With the 13D/A in hand (and I plan to pester management separately myself), I
think their is a potential for a positive catalyst. The upside is greater than

The HRP notes (HRPN) recently issued at 20 with a 7.5% coupon are trading at
18.79. This looks to me to be priced cheaply versus other HRP debt, which
trades around 7.0% yield.

Note that they are only 10 year maturity and are senior to the preferred, so
lower interest-rate and credit risk versus the preferreds at yield-to-maturity
that is close.

I am guessing they are cheap because of tax-loss selling.

Hi MCsweet - I am looking to convert my non qualified preferred dividends to
"qualified" dividends as I expect all tax rates to go up in the next few years.

To pay my annual health care insurance premiums, I need to buy $134,560 worth
of GOV (5,800 shares). If the annual dividend of $1.60/share is paid, I will
have enough "after tax" (Fed & State) proceeds to pay my monthly heath
insurance payments. I am assuming that the Federal "qualified dividend" tax
rate will increase to a minimum 25% rate (from my current 15% rate) and the CA
"qualified" dividend rate will go no higher than 10%.

If I did this with preferred dividend income, the minimum non qualified
dividend Federal tax rate may go as high as 50%. Therefore, I would have to buy
6,877 shares ($159K) to achieve the same goal.

Too bad health care premiums are not tax deductible like mortgage interest.

Yes there is more credit risk but is it worth an extra $25K (or more)in the
principal investment not to mention the specific company risk involved in
buying the senior debt note? I plan to spread $150K around into as many 5% and
7% qualified dividend paying companies to achieve a blended rate just north of
6%. If I am lucky, I should also generate an average 4% annual capital gain on
the basket of qualified dividend paying equities.

That's the plan as long as my health care premiums do not grow faster than my
dividend payouts plus the earnings from the long term capital gains.

Good point MCsweet. The key to a lower tax rate dividend strategy is to obtain
the blended rate based on companies that pay "qualified" dividends. After
checking the 10K for HRPT, their dividends are not generally qualified. Thanks
for the heads up.

This strategy becomes moot if the lower tax rate for "qualified" income is
changed (in future years) and is taxed at the same rate as non-qualified
income. Another moving target that is hard to forecast.

I was still surprised after doing the calculation how much capital is required
to produce an income stream (after taxes) to pay the required health insurance
premiums.

Any suggestion for companies that are high qualified dividend payers that also
fit the "value" company profile?

balance sheet and KBH looks the cheapest (in terms of EV/ Sales). their balance
sheet actually look pretty solid since they sold unneeded land (albeit at

Homebuilders:

I chose MDC primarily because, per Yahoo, it has more cash than debt:

MDC: $1.6B cash : $1.0B Total Debt

TOL: 1.8 : 2.1

KBH: 0.9 : 1.8

Haven't confirmed accuracy of those numbers (Yahoo sometimes being wrong). I'm
figuring that in a protracted downturn, MDC with its high cash to debt ratio
will be a survivor, and could/will pick up market share. Of course, this may
have nothing to do with putting a floor under the stock. MDC and all others
could drop to earlier lows and stay there or worse.

In the past cycle, I have used p/bk to value these homebuilders. I have read
that some pro analysts who follow these stocks also use p/bk as a key factor.

In any case, I remain grateful for what I've got and what I've received.

I hope you all have a joyous Christmas and happy holiday.
