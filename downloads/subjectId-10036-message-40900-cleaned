2011 is going to be pivotal in the U.S.

I think you guys are way early.

My prediction: nothing big expected in US. Unemployment will improve, economy
will improve too, debt will rise, but nobody will care, oil prices will stay
stable or even drop a bit.

I also don't see a lot of extreme values, which is a value investing problem.
However, I expect the economy upswing to keep market up and stable for 1-2
years at least.

My guess is US debt problems and tough choices will happen not earlier than
2013-2015. May be not even then.

What may break the market in 2011?
- Huge Euro crisis. Probability: low.
- China hard landing / crisis. Probability: low medium.
- US municipal/state crisis. Probability: very low.
- Oil blowup top like in 2008. Probability: low.
- Wars/terrorism/natural catastrophes/pandemics - probabilities: unchanged ;)

I don't think I am any good as macro predictor, so take this with a bottle of

FWIW I think airlines (e.g. LCC) may be reasonable investments here (startup
capital is no longer dirt cheap and some of the airlines are starting to be run

then fly (generally more expensive to drive and takes more than ten times as
long)?

I agree that certain REITS like RAS remain interesting (and I also added some
TCI late last year because it seems to have sold off excessively). But TCI like
TTNP (which I will try to buy a small position if it doesn't run away from me)
and to a lesser extent RAS are probably too speculative for most here.

SSN/oil shales. There seems to me to be a circle of people who are avid
followers of shale plays, especially penny stock plays. And so these plays are
well-known among this group, and the same people are buyers of all or several
of the stocks.

Some of these stocks have done quite well (so far), especially small e&p
companies that control acreage in more than one hot prospective oil area. As
I've said before, I believe the hot areas for oil are now Three Forks TX, and
USA Bakken (including Saskatchewan Bakken). Coming up close behind for 2011 is
Niobrara, as I've also suggested. Next (2011-2012)I'm guessing Cardium, but
maybe it'll be Alberta Bakken too, or predominantly. A lot of prospective stuff
here, and not a lot of public data on success or not of drilling so far (i.e.
Alberta Bakken).

Anyway, my guess is people who are following these plays are figuring, why take
a chance on one company in a hot or to-be-hot area, when you can buy a few of
these companies that are in several of the areas at the same time. The
potential of having a winner area might be increased for the company, and at
least give the company some options on how and which hot area it might
prioritize for development.

So you have the popularity of MHR, SSN, and others which are in multiple "hot"
areas. I've eventually taken positions in every one of such stocks that I've
been able to find. With some such as SSN, as the stock has moved up, I've
increased my position. Not sure right now if I'll add more (rapid run-up in
price past few days scares me).

I've been remiss on AXAS, one of these multiple plays, which I see now Dale
Baker has begun a position in. I've mentioned AXAS before, and I'm grateful for
my 2-3 bagger that I have in the year or so I've held shares. However, it's
ultimately afaik about making money --- not making percentages, and I've just
not been alert or aware or courageous enough to have acquired anything other
than a very small $ amount of shares. Again, as I've suggested before, it's
possible that shale stocks like these might run long-enough and up-enough to be
VERY significant enhancers to portfolio values. --- I seem to have forgotten
with AXAS and others that if someone wanted such gains for their portfolio,
they'd have to establish positions that were more than just token.
I've reviewed AXAS now again, and given what seems to me to be its potential
and involvement in these multiple shale plays, and its value (still well under
2p nav, according to the company), this is a shale stock I'll concentrate more
on adding to now. Which I'm doing today.

These gold and silver plays are way ahead of the fundamentals. Debasing via
inflation is a slow process while gold and silver and the derivative mining
plays (which are levered bets on metal prices) have been a runaway train.

the difference between the gold boom in 1980 and 2010 is that the majority of
the game is played in highly liquid vehicles (ETF, futures) which did not exist
back in 1980. A lot of institutions (hedge funds etc.) are using these vehicles
which also was not the case in 1980 (it was more a mania of the commons).

If I were in these plays, I would sent a mental stop and get out when the
kitchen get's too hot. FWIW, one thing to look at are interest rates. Higher
interest rates already negated QE2, imo.

sometimes you toss out opinions like they are facts. are you talking about the
price of silver and gold or the price of silver and gold mining companies or
both? In my opinion the gold and silver shares are not ahead of themselves at
all if you believe gold above $1200 and silver above $25 are reasonable levels.
Now i have seen statistics that if you compare the amount of gold and silver in
existence with the amount of money circulating that gold and silver are way
undervalued.

the cost of producing an ounce of gold seems to be going up so much annually
that most large goldminers are unable to replace their reserves except by going
out and making acquisitions.

The cost of production of silver is even more difficult to determine because
the vast majority of silver is mined as a byproduct.

No question though that its reasonable to expect 20% movement in either
direction over the course of a year just like we do with individual stocks.

I am willing to make a prediction that over the next few years at least one
government will figure out that they can make plenty of money by selling legal
tender coins that are 90% silver for face value of silver, and that these coins
will be pretty popular. i would certainly be happy holding a bunch of $30 legal
tender us coins that are 90% silver.

My posts are always opinions. If the amount of money were equal to the value of
precious metals, then that would return us to the gold standard. I don't think
the argument can be made that the wealth generated by the world economy is
proportional to inventory value of a few elements (Au, AG) horded in safes.
This was what the gold standard was about.

Now I am agreeing with you that we are on the wrong track with QE's and such,
but my argument is that there is not fundamental reason for the rapid
appreciation of precious metals.
In the 70's we had high single digit or even double digit inflation and now we
are a far cry from that. I remember the 1980's gold boom I played it as a 14
year old with 2 British Sovereigns. It was my first speculation. Back then, you
had to buy actual coins (which you could do at the bank for an about 8%
commission in Germany) now you can just buy GLD with a mouseclick. This makes

Hi Paul

E&P Land Leases - Not all are equivalent

I have been studying several E&P annual reports and in particular looking at
the specific types of land leases used. I come away more confused as the annual
reports really do not provide the details of the specific lease terms necessary
to compare which companies have the best leases.

Did you come to this conclusion on your reviews?

Many of the leases have both three year and five year terms. Several have
different royalty payment amounts depending if on (1) Indian Reservation land,
(2) BLM land and/or (3) private land. Some of the leases provide for sub-leases
with an over riding royalty paid to the lessee.

All of these factors can affect the final cost of production to the lease
holder.

I suspect that some of the older leases and/or original land owners have the
best terms. Many times when they sell their land interests, they keep a small
"over riding" royalty interest which when bought by a large E&P driller can
generate perpetual "royalty" income to the seller.

The hidden value lies with the large land and/or lease holder that have no
expiration term or with the mineral rights acquired years ago. Usually the much
larger company can negotiate (and even demand) the most favorable terms. That's
how they can achieve such a low cost of production.

In summary, all land acquisition deals are not the same. One must be careful
with the smaller E&P companies as their land deals look to be the most
constrictive and w/ their limited capital could be squeezed by lack of
performance and lose their lease(s).

Finally. what is to prevent the Federal and/or State or local agencies charging
additional taxes/royalties on all producing NG/Oil wells and/or upping their
permit fees for well development. This seems like a possible new source of
revenue especially for States loaded w/ debt (ie California). Therefore, E&P
companies w/ operations in the mid west, North Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado,
Montana may be better prospects.

EKS

P.S. The more I study the landscape, MDU through their Fidelity Exploration
Company may have the best overall package of leases (both w/ terms &
locations). (

Oil land leases. Yes, the situation is complex. I find as an outsider, it's
unfathomable. That's why I buy a basket of e&p stocks - large e&p and small,
within a particular shale.

Other aspects which are important, that a package of such stocks may facilitate
dealing with, are:

1. Bakken shale and some others extend across state lines as well as country.
So we're dealing with various state and provincial laws regarding land use and
rights.

2. Some leases (esp. some Canadian gov't) require the acquiring company to
drill a certain amount in a certain period of time or else the leases will be
rescinded. Which means somehow, the acquirer has got to have funding and has
got to secure fracing crews to drill.

3. There are several layers in geological formations (levels of shale). In some
states, drilling rights can be bought and sold on the particular geological
formation, i.e. the particular layer in the earth. Thus, if some company says
they've got land holdings in the Bakken, I have to assume (given my limited
knowledge) it's not necessarily so that the holdings relate to that geological
level which has been proven to be the productive oil layer.

Hi Jurgis -

What type of Oil related investments are you looking at?

I am looking at mid cap energy & distribution companies with market Caps less
than $3 Billion but larger than $1 Billion.

I have my eye on a few that are selling at a reasonable PE for their sector,
have acceptable debt profiles (total LT Debt no more than 6x annual Net Income)
and pay a pretty good dividend.

Each company in my list has a growth theme that if executed by management could
add additional value to shareholders in two or three years.

Some of these companies have already been discussed on this thread. I still
believe they present a value opportunity at current prices. I have them on my

below their 200 MA. AGL is the only one that sells below it's 200 MA at this
time.

Another "Wild Card" small cap on my list is Gas Natural Inc. Common Stock
(AMEX: EGAS ) . The company pays a good monthly dividend, has a low PE and has
a growth strategy where the CEO (and largest shareholder) has delivered double
digit growth for the last few years. The company is a NG distributor & well
owner that has been buying other very small utilities primarily in the North
East. I hold this in the IRA account and have recently added shares.

Looking to see what you eventually buy.

Hello Jurgis,

I'm going to join you in general in regards to looking at the p/e first of
energy plays when looking at value stocks. I look at the p/e first of all
stocks I'm considering, so I start there with energy also. Not my only
consideration, but my first.

That being said, I do have a few growth/speculative plays in my portfolio. In
the energy sector, those are ATPG and IOC and then I've got a few biotech ones
also that I'm writing calls against.

I think when I started investing, I was at about 99% growth/speculative stocks,
so I feel I'm doing pretty good these days at around 80% value and 20% growth.
:)

Overall, I understand why value investors wouldn't necessarily buy ATPG. But, I
like the risk/reward.

Thanks,

Grant

In somewhat-majors I have NXY, in supermajors E and TOT.

I have not really invested into energy infrastructure companies. I am not an

Hi Paul -

Re: Magellan Petroleum Corporation (MPET)

Value Extracted - Oil Confirmed!

UPDATE 1-Northern Petroleum confirms oil find at Sussex licence

* Finds oil in core regions of Markwells Wood-1 well

* Penetrates hydrocarbon-bearing interval of 275 ft

* Shares up 4.4 pct

(Adds details)

Jan 6 (Reuters) - European Union-focused explorer Northern Petroleum confirmed
on Thursday that it found oil in the core regions of its Markwells Wood-1 well
in Sussex, sending its shares up more than 4 percent.

In December, Northern said it found oil in the primary reservoir at the site,
after the well was spudded in November.

The explorer said it penetrated a hydrocarbon-bearing interval of 275 feet,
with a calculated net reservoir of 192 feet at the well, located in the PEDL126
licence.

"Success at Markwells Wood, helped by current oil prices, should enhance the
value of the other undeveloped discoveries and exploration prospects held under
licence by Northern in the UK," Managing Director Derek Musgrove said in a
statement.

Northern, which operates the PEDL126 licence, holds a 50 percent interest,
Magellan Petroleum has a 40 percent interest, while Egdon Resources holds the
remaining stake in the licence.

Northern shares, which have gained nearly a third in value since the Markwells
Wood well was spudded in November, were up 4.4 percent at 142 pence at 0817 GMT
on Thursday on the London Stock Exchange.

Very encouraging that there is oil flowing, and that maybe there's a chance

I originally bought MPET primarily as an add to my basket of Bakken stocks. (It
has 23K acres in Montana.) Additionally, it has feedstock and production
facilities for making methanol in Australia for sale to China. As I've been a

production. And MPET says they intend to use C02 for oil
enhancement/development in their Bakken properties.

NRP was mention on the Dividend investing for retirement thread. I looked it
over even though it is selling at a 52wk high, it still seems a "value" buy.
Low Debt, low "industry" PE very coal specific. I passed because I do not want

their diversified holdings in both Coal & Natural Gas.

My thought was to look at the flooded mines in Australia to see if they could

resume business as normal. Have you looked at any of these names? If so, can

http://www.google.com/finance?q=ASX:GNM

JP Morgan rates as Overweight + two other brokers rate it a buy, these guys
ship out of NSW Kembla Port Terminal, very close to their mines, under 20 km,
(the terminal is very under utilized, its in New South Wales, about 40 miles
south of Sydney, no flooding near this area).

Lately they have even shipped some spot to China, (they just announced that
more spot shipments would be going to China + other countries), the vast
majority of their coking coal output goes to their parent company in India,
they have an offtake agreement with them. The price formula can be found on
page 52 of this:

http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20100906/pdf/31sbvh65trfhyb.pdf

They did recently say that they are reducing annual output from 2.0 million

at 2.5 million tons.
See page 4:

NOBGF: Positive article in today's Barron's on trading/agribusiness companies
Noble Group, Olam, and Wilmar International.

Article suggests growth in agribusiness will continue, and these companies
participate not only by trading ag commodities, but more so also because they
are moving aggressively into agricultural production themselves by buying
land/farms/production operations.
===============
"NOBLE GROUP, WITH ITS HEADQUARTERS in Hong Kong, is Asia's biggest supplier of
raw materials. Just 22% of its revenue comes from agriculture; the rest is
derived from materials like iron ore. Noble has invested heavily in mines and
processing. It's also in shipping and logistics and energy sales; it owns bulk
carriers. And it recently purchased Sempra Energy Solutions, a North American
electricity retailer that operates in 16 U.S. states. The seller was a joint
venture owned by Sempra and Royal Bank of Scotland. SES is expected to account
for 13% of Noble's 2011 earnings.

...For all of Noble's strength in hard assets, agriculture is a fast-growing
focus for the company. Agriculture accounts for less than a quarter of its
revenue but 38% of its gross profit. In 2009, China Investment, Beijing's
sovereign wealth fund, took a 15% stake in Noble. The Chinese also plan to make
joint investments with the company. Noble already processes oilseeds and owns
palm plantations and other ag assets. Last month, it bought two sugar mills
from Brazilian ethanol producer Grupo Cerradinho. Agriculture can be a
high-margin business. HSBC reckons that an increase of just a 10th of a
percentage point in agricultural margins boosts Noble's earnings 1.3%.

"...earnings have grown at a fast clip over the past few years, and are likely
to spring more than 50% this year. Says Noble's Ricardo Leiman: "Noble is a
growth story. We intend to get to $1 billion in earnings in 2013. We want to
grow the top and bottom line 20%. We pay a 25% dividend every year."

"...Noble has long traded at a discount to Olam and ADM because of its exposure
to cyclical commodities..."

I continue to hold all my Noble shares.

Foods. It was first brought to my attention by morokko65
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=21367236

On these type of companies. I always use limit orders, but I'm sure you already
know this. I am only a retail individual investor. If I want to buy a large
amount, or sell a large amount. I will put orders in piece meal. HOTCHKIS &
WILEY once owned 188,700 of UFPT shares, bought under 7. They have since sold
out. I still like the company prospects. Of coarse, if things don't live up to
expectations. Things could get ugly quite quickly. It seems a few analysts and
firms are currently taking a liking to it. It's a hold for me currently with
the balance I have left.

One company I currently like, that's quite bigger is SHLM. The company just
disappointed with earnings, but guidance wasn't cut for the year. I'd be

market it's getting harder to find value. IMO it still looks to be a value.

DinoNavarre, re. coking coal. I'd forgotten about that coal company. In past,
Gujaret's been hard for me to pin down as to its value.

As a speculation I hold Rey Resources in Western Australia -- Gujaret is a
major stockholder. But REY is thermal, and I'm with you in looking for met coal
- met coal primarily being in the flooding area of Australia.

I continue to look. All the small companies I'm seeing seem to have already
climbed in price. Expectations are high.

As of right now I may just stick with US steel producers with locked in met
supplies, and with US coking coal exporters. While shares in these companies
have already moved up too, here I would hope they may not have the large
volatility that one might experience with dinky small foreign companies that
may be momentum plays now. (i.e. maybe less risk for less gain with the big

Hi Paul -

Re: NOBLE GROUP LTD(Other OTC: NOBGF.PK )
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=NOBGF.PK+Key+Statistics

I calculated my overall return on this one and it looks with the dividend it
has generated <u>28% per year</u> (based on my original purchase date of
9/21/09).

The total return w/ dividend(s) is 36.31% which I have held for 1.3 years (so
far).

<u>Investment Return Summary</u>
Initial Buys:<pre>9/21/09 $1.71/share
12/31/09 $2.29/share
1/27/10 $2.01/share
6/3/2010 Stock Split 1.5453 shares for 1
7/8/2010 cash dividend 1.8%

Closing price:
1/8/11 $1.77/share</pre>
The company does carry a lot of debt, but they have been buying "hard" assets
all over the world that will generate pretty good income streams into the
future. Their "hard assets" should grow in value (relative to the U.S. dollar)
so it provides a modest hedge against U.S. inflation for the portfolio.
Historically they have paid cash dividends that equaled a 10% yield but in
6/2010 they did a stock split with a small cash dividend (1.8% yield).

Their logistics business services China a huge growth market.

My holding period is at least 3-5 years so if they can keep up their current
growth rate, this one should double in value in 4 years or less.

I will hold my shares and may add on any significant pull back and/or company
asset acquisition(s). I like their agricultural exposure in Brazil as it
complements my Ultrapetrol (Bahamas) Ltd. (ULTR) River Barge services there.
Nobel controls interests in the complete growing, transportation, distribution
& processing of the Brazil soybean harvest that eventually gets distributed in
China. This is a pretty good "pure" play w/o the concerns with those fraudulent
Chinese shell companies.

http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20101122/pdf/31v1s5w8nlfsjt.pdf

Pure Hard Coking Coal play,(so far), IMO difficult to find these.

They have an aggressive growth plan, upgrading both mines and delivery
infrastructure to the port facility, increasing coal output (I believe the
target is for 6 MTPA by FY15, that would be equal to or slightly above
estimates of India's total 2010 HCC imports) and adding additional value by
increasing the amount of their coal resources/reserves that can be mined.

IMO, I think that the company/stock is not well known by investors outside of
India/Australia, hopefully that may be changing!

When I read this article I thought of SVU. Very few analysts like this except

taking a position in SVU.

The article also made me think of a couple of years ago where almost every
article I read about solar industry was negative. Being in solar for the last
couple of years paid off well.

In the last several months I read that most analysts are avoiding utilities. I
understand the negative take if the fear is decreasing utility stock price if
interest rates rise. But utility stocks still seem better than the direct
inverse relationship you'd get with bonds. Bottom line is the negative analyst
reviews on utility stocks may be a good contrary indicator.

Same story with nat gas. There are a lot of negative analyst stories about the
over-supplied nat gas market. A lot of folks here think nat gas is attractively
priced for patient investors. So analysts' view in this case may also prove to
be a good contrary indicator.

The article's author does not realize that the situation is not symmetrical.

It does not matter if investor does not like and does not buy a stock that goes
up 100%. What matters is what they like and buy. If they buy a stock that goes
up 50% and outperforms the market, that's great. It does not matter that some
other stocks went up 100%.

Sure, you can blame the analyst or the investor for dissing and missing the
100% gainer, but IMHO it's a waste of time.

I'm sure I did not like a ton of 100% gainers in my life. Do I lose sleep about
it? No. And if someone would blame me for not liking and buying these stocks,
I'd think that they should find something more useful to do with their life. ;)

An analyst or portfolio manager can be held accountable for results that they
produce in their portfolio. They cannot be held accountable for results of
stocks that they did not put into their portfolio. Measure them against other
managers, measure them against market, but don't measure them against some
random selection of stocks that nobody invested into. ;)

richardred,

I'm not familiar with SHLM. I pulled it up in my database (SI Stock Investor
Pro) and quick thoughts:

My participation in the value realm is fairly narrow - if a company isn't
hitting alot of Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula criteria or if it doesn't hit
alot of Buffettology-type screens I pretty much don't see it. My guess is the
returns on capital, return on equity, and various other similar calcs combined
with the lower earnings yield have never brought it to my attention.

The sales growth is interesting to me, but they've gotta improve operationally
before they start showing up on the filters I use. One other thing I look at is
book value growth and their book value is about the same as it was 7 yrs ago -
they're not creating much equity via the business. It looks like free cashflow
was starting to surge a few yrs back and then they went negative again
recently. Without digging more it's tough, but again - they haven't
historically proven great managers of capital on a ROTC or ROE basis, but maybe
they're onto something with what looks like a recent big investment.

But again - just my quick thoughts and I'm not a die-hard value guy and there's
lots of companies on this thread that folks like that never get past the first
filters I have. This one just doesn't fit the profile of what I tend to look
at.

Jurgis, LOL. It's not so much what the small investor does who buys some small
positions in the microcaps, but if somebody big wants to get out of some of the
more thinly traded issues the price can start diving hard and fast on no news.
It can be a bit scary. And selling pressure can persist for a long time. (works
opposite on the buy side which can be nice too).

But even the little guy has to be careful when buying/selling. Even buying or
selling a position of say $10-20K might require a limit spread across several
days to move in/out without distorting the price too much. I think even the
small investor can move the price on these some.

TTT - I bought into TTT before the rights offering and participated in the
rights shares with the subsequent KHDHF distributions, the most recent now
shown in my Fidelity account. Seems like a good investment so far as shown on
the books. However, I am somewhat confused on the value of the KHDHF spinoffs
and the overall value of the combined company. The following clip seems to shed
some light on the evaluation of the company:

thATS interesting. i was unaware of the rights offering and am not pleased with
the potential dillution there. i will have to do more research because in the
press release it says that us investors who are accredited will be able to
participate through a private offering.

i believe that ttt is undervalued because they underpaid for mass financial by
at least $2 a share maybe even more. as far as i know mass financial owned a
bunch of companies in the health care field in china and still does. no doubt
that will be part of a future spin-off. mass financial was one of the best
performing and largest positions in my portfolio and it seems to me that smith
is pretty astute although ttt no doubt will also be a bit of a black box. its a
bet on management for me.

Shane,

Yeah, if we talk seriously, the issues you outlined are very real. In some of
the microcaps discussed here I could get a 10-20% jump just by placing 100
share market order. Of course, the price would go down immediately back, but if
I made another market order, perhaps I could drive it up even more.

So, yeah, gotta use limit orders, spread them across time, etc. And, yeah,
there's a risk that you won't be able to get out in a stampede. ASRG is a good
example if you review its trading last year.
