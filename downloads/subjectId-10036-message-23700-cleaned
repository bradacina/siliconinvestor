Good luck with the WON. They are generating a lot of FCF. I think the comapny
will raise its dividend again soon.

I looked at the name recently but decided to pass on it. I was hoping WON could
sell its traffic content to SIRI, but that went up in smoke when CBS sued SIRI

Thanks for your kind words Paul. You're right, BDT has been very good for me.

I must tell you that after I bought my first shares, I bought again last spring
all the way down to $20 CDN. Later in the year, Bird Construction announced its
intention to convert to the trust structure. Management paid a special dividend
of $8.35 and issued 3 units for 1 share in the conversion process. A unit is
now worth a little bit more than $16 and gives a 10 cent dividend each month.

BDT.un is really a cash cow. Over the last year I have received in dividends
about 50% of my total investment. And distribution will start April 20, which
is also my birthday!

If you want to follow an other CDN value stock, look at CAM.sv.a, Canam Group.
I was in at a little bit over $7, but I think that there is still a lot of
upside. I'll let you know if I see anything else of value.

Fwiw, I'm using Sedar,

to search info. on Canadian company, Canam Group

Looks like about 42M sh. out and with good 2005 sales of about 711M, that gives
a p/sales metric of .67. I don't know if that's good or bad --- company is in
at least four sectors of construction; I don't know what a comparable metric
might be.

Seems like a cyclical business, and the company's already made a breakout move.
OTOH some aspects of its businesses look pretty good... growth in Canada,
infrastructure improvements in USA (railroad bridges are a competency
apparently), debt's being reduced.

Conclusion is not clear to me.

then now has equivalent share price of 2x2x$72/sh. = $288/sh. That's more than

I'm back buying more BEL. I've about doubled my position in the last two days
with an average price of about 3.25. Looking at the financials, the stock
doesn't look like a value company. But I was initially intrigued by the 13-Ds
filed and the past years of earnings with this company. FWIW, today some
interesting posts were made on the Yahoo board.

The reasons you would not buy this stock are if you are concerned about the
fact that they are just at cash flow breakeven until they get more soil volume.
It looks like cost cutting is pretty much over so there may not be much more
upside to the bottom line.

The reasons you would buy this stock are:

1. There have been and continue to be a number of vulture buyers constantly
pestering the company to buy them out for just the liquidation value

2. The company goes out and procures soil volume by buying a number of
mom-and-pop site services companies.

3. The management realizes there is value due to the high margin/high fixed
cost nature of their business and buys out the company themselves.

4. The new management team's revised relationship with the Canadian regulators
has recently resulted in its ability to finally bid on contracts competitively
and in a timely fashion without waiting for approval from the Canadian
government (which used to happen because they hated John Bennett)

5. Clean Harbors is having a hard time continuing growing because their
incinerators are now operating at over 100% of stated capacity. They are
growing their site services business but cannot find a place to incinerate. To
recreate the 200,000 tons of capacity that Bennett has would cost in the
hundreds of millions, not to mention, years to construct, assuming that they
even get approval for one of these things as nobody wants an incinerator in
their back yard. There are very few other incinerators and if Clean Harbors
wants to grow, its going to have to use that $150 million of cash sitting on
their balance sheet and buy Bennett.

I will feel compelled to force the issue...

David Cheng
Oakdale Capital Management

As to the question of value...

That would depend on to whom. They are worth hundreds of millions to Clean
Harbors because there are very few other incinerators and they take a long time
to build. In the meantime, Clean Harbors needs growth to make their stock price
go higher. They cannot really grow unless they get more incineration capacity.

One other interesting phenomenon is as commercial construction increases, land
that was previously contaminated (held by GE, etc) that had been monitored is
becoming worth more and more in a sale for companies as usable land becomes
more scarce. As such, companies like GE are beginning to re-evaluate
contaminated sites that they had previously only monitored as sale candidates
but that cannot be accomplished until the soil is cleaned up. Strange, but
there is actually a small commmercial (not residential) real estate play here.

As always said, DYOD, but I thought the posts were interesting in an otherwise
disastrous week for the stock due to the fact that they are restating earnings
and showing a loss for the last quarter. They have also delayed their quarterly
earnings. (What else could go wrong.) But, for me, it is an interesting
speculation due to their assets. The company is basically event driven in that
if they land a big contract they are out of the woods, and it is compelling
that the competition is compacity constrained.

Nevertheless, definitely a speculative situation.

EXM looks okay. Been profitable every year since '99. Maybe at some point the
stock approaches net tangible book value (i.e salvage value of the ships). Or
maybe the company is and will continue to be a value trap. Perhaps the story is
that investors see a boom/bust with each of the profitable companies now
commissioning new ships, thus setting up the sector for overcapacity and losses
in future years. I do not know.

I've considered trimming my position also, but my initial postion is small, so
I'm letting it ride. The big question to me is the future price of copper. If
copper sustains this price for the next year, my model shows about $0.65/share
expected over the next four quarters, giving TGB a current p/e based on the
next year of less than 5, which I think is attractive.

But, who knows? My model could be materially wrong, and it's very hard to
predict what will happen to the price of commodities, so I think your move is
wise and I would do the same if I had a bigger position.

But, thanks again for the idea, I appreciate it.

E_K_S. I have full positions in BDC's ALD as well as ACAS.

Hard to say if any in the sector is undervalued. I was PM'd that ACAS could be
trouble because of the way the company might be doing business: One internal
entity apparently might or could be selling to another to get fee income. (A
Ponzi scheme). Possible, but I doubt that significant amounts are involved. But
I've really no inkling. Perhaps all these stocks are dangerous or risky ---
that might be the reason for the high dividend yields (and occasional short
attacks).

I also have shares - in smaller amounts - of all the companies Carl Worth just
mentioned.

One argument against the older, established BDCs is that they sell for so much
more than stated book value. And they always seem to be going to the trough for
more money (by selling "inflated" stock). And it's tricky to understand where
the money comes from to pay their dividends. However, the stocks have traded
this way and done these stock issuances for years. Which might suggest to bears
that yes, you can fool some of the people all the time.
I'm looking at it this way though, that the unseasoned BDCs - ones selling
closer to book value - while they're perhaps untested in down markets and/or
it's not so assured as how disciplined and competent their managers are in
finding and consummating deals - yet because the stocks are selling close to
book, the stocks might have a chance eventually to move higher--- closer to
p/book of the seasoned BDCs. In any case, the dividends are good while waiting
to find out.

As I mentioned in an earlier post, my portfolios' volatility and composition
(lot of cyclical oil stocks) is starting to bother me. I'm hoping that the BDC
stocks because of their dividends (dividend yields) will temper some of that
volatility. I note though that I have relatively large holdings of a few of
these BDCs, so even small changes in a few of these stocks show up markedly in
my portfolio swings. That's one reason I've expanded the BDC companies into
which I'm willing to commit funds. Another reason is that I'm hoping the
diversity will reduce risk in any particular company. I have MCGC, and with a
dividend yield close to 12%, one does have to worry that there's something just
not real good there.

Thank you for your answer. One concern I have is as rates rise does not the
potential for a loan "default" increase with the deals these companies
structure?

MVC Capital Inc. (MVC) looks interesting as they have several deals that are
outside the U.S. with exposure to European markets. I like the potential return
these companies can achieve when they structure financing for these very small
undercapitalized and very profitable companies.

What bothers me is if management makes deals that are marginal just to meet
their growth targets. In rising rates, more of these marginal deals can turn
sour.

I have been watching ALD for sometime and have always been concerned with how
they structured many of their deals, floating more shares to finance these
deals while continuing to pay such large quarterly dividends. I sold my
position in ALD early last year but I guess I was wrong as ALD has hit new
highs.

I will watch the stocks that both you and Carl Worth have posted and perhaps
nibble at a few shares when rates have stabilized.

Possible that defaults occur but possibly not because of the deal structure. I
presume each deal is somewhat structured to account for rate rises. OTOH, the
customers of a company might have to reduces their dealings with the company
esp. if interest rates bite enough to cause a recession.
This in turn could cause the company to default on its BDC loan due to lack of
cash flow. Or the company could drop in value. (Thus hurting the BDC, e.g. if
there were stock or warrants invoved in the particular loan.)

Back otoh: Because bank rates to borrowers increase and become more difficult
for smaller companies to obtain, I expect that more small companies will turn
to these BDCs for the BDCs relatively more attractive financing, so demand for
the deals that the BDCs do, might increase.

ALD has a long history: It's survived interest rate swings. I hope it and other
BDCs can do so again.

i don't think it's as likely that defaults would start to be a problem due to
interest rates, since the loans are already in place, and are largely fixed
rate debt...as such, the companies qualified for those loans at a known cost,
to both the borrower and the lender, unlike an adjustable mortgage or the like

i'd be more concerned about these companies if and when the economy slows down

CSE in particular makes fairly short term loans, as you can see by the
maturities in their recent collateralization

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060403/dcm046.html?.v=38

as such, they should be fairly well insulated from defaults, since it would
seem unlikely that a significant number of their customers would have their

Hi Carl - Do you know if CSE's dividend is a "qualified" dividend? I noticed
that CSE is trading near it's high. Other than the growth in the general
economy, what factors influence the price of CSE? For the larger commercial
banks it is the general shape of the yield curve and the growth of their
deposits in their bank.

I have an over weighted position in banks both large (JPM, C & WM) and regional
(NYB). These financial stocks usually rally towards the end of an interest rate
increase. I wonder if the 2nd tier financial stocks like CSE act in a similar
manner.

I sure like the dividend yield of 8%. It's about twice of what I am current
getting from the large financial banks and 1.3x that of what my regional bank
NYB pays.

CSE recently elected to operate as a REIT, so the dividend is not qualified,
assuming you mean the way it is treated for tax purposes

i'd say CSE's stock price is currently being affected by the overall interest
rate environment, and the overhang of the recent secondary offering...longer
term i think the price will rise as they show they can grow as the estimates
are predicting...of course, if they fail to do so, the price will reflect that
as well

i would think that the end of the interest rate increases would have a more
favorable effect on banks than on companies like CSE, since the yield curve
probably has more of an effect on the banks...it is my perception that
companies like CSE can pick and choose the investments they want to make, and
thus build in the return on investment they seek, whereas banks are in a much
more competitive environment, and must respond to their competitors as they try
to deploy their much larger amounts of capital

i own NYB and WM as well, and have owned C at times...in most cases i play
these stocks for the dividends and covered call premiums, whereas in a company
like CSE, i figure that assuming they execute, they will in time receive a
multiple more commensurate with their growth rate

Hi Paul, I have not participated on this thread in several years, but I wanted
to put in a plug for it and the value of long term value investing.

Because of this thread, I bought LUKOY in August 1999 at $7.50 per share, after
adjusting for the May 2005 , 4:1 stock split. Total dividends per share since
August 1999 just under $3, net of withheld taxes in Russia.

Price per share is currently $87.

Much of this rise, of course, is due to energy prices, but I always felt much
more confident holding the stock because it was undervalued relative to its
peers. Much of that under-valuation was warranted, of course, but much of it
was not.

I hardly ever invest long....I'm a shortseller by nature. But I think some of
my ability to hold this one was because I always love a bargain.

Anyway, I'm not sure what nugget of thought can be derived from this

Nice run there by LUKOY. I don't see it mentioned on this thread though in
1999. But okay, I likely would not have recognized the potential nor bought the
stock at that time anyway. I own it now though.

Congratulations to you. If you're a short seller, and if you invest roughly the
same amount of money in each of your shorts or buys, then LUKOY is likely to be
your best or among your best investments. Well, by the aritmatic anyway. A
$7.5K (for example) short at best drops to 0, for a $7.5k profit. But going
long back then for $7.5K of LUKOY would have fortunately (luckoyly? -gg-)run
the 1000 shares up to $87K (so far). Long term tax rate too when you sell (if
not in an IRA) vs. short-term tax rate for any short sale profits (assuming
you're subject to USA taxes). Also there's the "extra" of $3K in div. collected
along the way. (So 3/7.5 = 40% of invested dollars already returned to stock
buyers of 1999.) All very sweet.

Its amazing to me that with all their financial clout the quality of some of
these fortune 500 companies decision making has been so consistently poor. I
dont see how gm survives without reorganizing a. looks like the auto supplier
union are going to strike, gm is going to lose billions, wagonner gets a golden
parachute and gm probably files, the bondholders end up with ownership and then
gm revives with much lower contract labor. of course shareholder equity has
been wiped out and the midwest gets plunged into recession or worst. there will
probably be lots of unhappy retirees too. just a speculation on my part.

I've considered many auto suppliers. Either I can't convince myself that they
won't teeter into bankruptcy or else they are niche suppliers that have
dominating positions in their field but whose stock seems expensive. For
example, self-dimming mirror co. GNTX - now near a 12 month low. The p/e is
either absolutely high and not a buy, or else one sees the p/e as relatively
low compared to its past and so it is a buy if one strongly weighs the
company's apparently sustainable competitive advantage. I've bought and sold
this one, and my opinion is that it's not a value play. Others might say it's a
beat down growth stock whose story is still intact.
Other 'good' niche players I've looked at are that Swedish(?) air bag supplier
(dominant position) (Stock moved up while on my watch list and I missed it.
Don't recall the name now.); and I've just recently found and passed on a small
company which is doing great (and whose stock reflects it) in supplying the
perforated/ventilated seats for the heating/cooling seat options on cars.

I've had SUP for a while and recently sold at a loss. SUP has good finances
(cash, no ltd), but it's suffering two ways: Competitor plants are domiciled in
low-wage countries, so SUP is moving there to compete. A chief competitor,
HAYZ, is really struggling too - they've got lots of debt - and so the risk is
HAYZ cuts margins to the quick to stave off bankruptcy, thus hurting SUP's
ability to profit. OTOH, SUP is family controlled, so there's a possibility
that at some low SUP price, the insiders may make an offer to buy the company.
(I believe there might be a stock buyback in place now too.)

I've looked briefly at Lear. It's been suggested here before, and apparently
some professional value investors have been buying. To me, Lear, with a d/e
ratio of 2, and being a supplier to GM and I believe F, I don't see a margin of
safety. It could be there, I'm a little shell-shocked though and maybe can't
see it. I've recently taken losses in DRRA (near bankruptcy?), and I've
followed (owned) a couple other suppliers right into bankruptcy in past years.
So I'm not keen on stocks in this downtrodden sector. (Realizing that MAYBE,
now at perhaps max. pessimism, might be the very time to buy them.) I'll go
back and look at Johnson Controls though.

I've looked briefly at auto parts retailers, but I don't see the bargains
there. These chains seem to be everywhere in middle/low income areas -
Autozone, Pep Boys, etc. I would assume they are just fighting it out for
shares in a saturated market.

Perhaps marginally related to auto stocks are the truck manufacturers and
suppliers. A cyclical business, and I'm not sure where we are in the cycle. I'm
holding NAV and CVGI though. For right now, there doesn't seem to me to be the
bankruptcy risk within this sector that is present in the auto sector.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NAV,CVGI&d=s

I'm still positive on big auto retailers, and I'm still holding several stocks
there. Imo, in past couple of years this has been among the best stock
performing areas of all sectors in the truck/auto universe. Some auto loan
companies have done well too, and some have been acquired by larger companies.
(I still hold ACF purchases from '02, '03, '04.)

I like auto insurers, and I have a couple there. I've mentioned CGI maybe a
dozen or more times over the past years. I'm also holding CPRT in the salvage
business, and KAR in the auto auction business. (I wouldn't call either of
these latter two a value buy at current prices though.)

Oh well, jmo.

RE: Lear and Auto Parts

You are correct in that more than 60% of Lear's revenues (in seats) is
attributable to GM, F, and DCX (That's the old "C" ticker, right).

This is the "big picture" thesis on Lear. Lear has three businesses; one of
which is a great business (Electrical components), one of which is a good
business (seats), and one of them is an absolutely horrible business
(interiors).

Historically, Lear has earned high ROCs since the "good business" (Seats) is
essentially a duopoly amongst JCI and Lear. While Lear's fate is tied to GM, F,
and DCX, I believe what the market fails to see is that Lear is strengthening
their partnerships with Asian vendors, more specifically, Nissan. The key to
understanding the "seat" business is that seats are both heavy and large. As
such, any "labor arbitrage" that one vendor can utilize by assembling in China
is quickly "arbitraged away" due to shipping and transportation costs. On the
other hand, Lear's factories for seats are located "very close" to automobile
assembly lines. So, for about 70% of their revenue stream, I'd argue that there
is a moat and a competitive advantage. When thinking about this, think also
about WHR how they source their parts globablly, but assemble locally!

Interiors is either going to be spun off to Ross, sold, or destroyed so it is
much ado about nothing.

Electrical connectors is a great business and production is outsourced overseas
to low cost countries like, i believe, the Phillapenes (sp?).

RE: Auto Parts Retailers

That, to me, is an extremely interesting space. All companies such as AAP, AZO,
and ORLY are doing quite well on a ROC basis. This sector has a natural moat
since auto parts are a slow turning business. As such, the WMTs of the world
won't get into it. Furthermore, from recollection, I believe that the largest
publicly traded auto parts retails have about 30% share in the US. Auto parts
retailers is a highly fragmented business with lots of mom and pop shops
around.

Another interesting thing about this business is that it is not cyclical at
all. Think about it, when your car breaks down, you have to get it repaired or
you don't go to work.

Third, the average age of automobiles is getting older and we are entering the
"Sweet spot" of age where autos need more repairs. Moreover, until gas prices
shot through the roof, Americans were continuing to put more and more miles on
their cars each year.

Fourth, while DIY (Do-it-Yourself) is the model that everyone thinks of, the
key to "growth" is the DIFM (Do it for me) model selling to garages and the
like. This is generating nice growth.

AZO is more of a turn around story, but ROC is very high. I believe that one of
the reasons why SSS has been falling is due to the fact that AZO is more
expensive than a comparable AAP. (I priced checked various items such as spark
plugs and light bulbs using the Internet).

AAP is the "Growth" story and if you look at their historical operating
margins, margins continue to increase which is a good sign.

AZO has 15-17% op. margins whereas AAP has 10-12% op. margins. I'd continue to
look for AAP margin expansion.

My best idea is Lear, FWIW. Good business, good management. Mr. market has
become quite pessismistic given that Delphi, Collins & Aikman, and Dana are in
bankruptcy and is shooting first.

Remember, spark plugs and small, light things can be outsourced very easily.
Engine blocks, chasis and other large heavy items cannot.

Hello, I2. I sold all RML in my accounts this am. If I could quantify risk, I'd
say there's a high probability of a profitable short in the stock now. (Stock
at 18.28 vs. buyout price of 18.00.) I don't see a higher offer coming, and
even if so, management/BOD likely would still choose to be with Mr. Buffett.
Just may not be worth spending $18.28 to gain .28, unless stock drops more
while waiting for deal to close 3rd quarter. That's iffy, given the assurance
(Berkshire commitment) that the deal will proceed.

Hi StreetSmart71 - NYB pays $1.00 per year but they only earn $1.13. Next
year's earnings should be a bit higher and growing as they have acquired
another smaller bank that should be additive to their earnings.

The one benefit to NYB's dividend vs CSE's dividend is that NYB is "qualified"

I use IB as well. The Java interface takes a little to get used to. Prices are
low but in order to get quotes on the screen one must subscribe to US Market

- on reits - i'm big right now on IMH - they're focused on the variable rate
mortgages & selling off their fixed rates - so they should be well-positioned
in the rising rate environment - current yield is about 12% - good luck

- Given that IMH just paid a 1Q06 dividend of .25 and is solidly profitable -
arent’ the shorts in big trouble? Per IMH’s 12/31/05 bal sheet - $27.7 bill of
assets vs. only $26.6 bill in total liabiliteis. So about $1.1 bill in equity.
About 76.3 mill diluted shares outstanding. Book value stands at $14.42
diluted. If the repurchase of shares took place at $10/share - it would only
take $763 mill to repurch 100% of the shares outstanding. Heck - the stock is
only at $9.40 now. How difficult would it be to come up w/ $763 mill?

Based on IMH’s $1.1 bill in equity - I think IMH’s Board could very easily
execute on their open authority to repurchase 5 mill shares. If the stock price
didn’t move appreciably after the 5 mill share buy back - then just continue
buying up the remaining shares.

With respect to the shorts - short position at a record 10.5 mill shares. Stock
is trading at 65% of book value ($9.40/14.42). Shorts just paid a hefty
.25/qtrly dividend. They know IMH is solidly profitable and should clean up on
their interest rate hedges due to the recent increases in the 10-yr treasuries.
Given that IMH’s deliquencies remain very low; and they’ve maintained their
focus on holding variable rate mortgages; I have to believe at some point IMH’s
shorts are going to want to cover. And IMH should begin trading along with
other mreits - and should reach $20+. Good luck.

Johnson Controls Reports Record Quarterly Results, Updates Earnings Guidance
for Full-Year 2006
Wednesday April 19, 7:00 am ET

MILWAUKEE, April 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE: JCI
- News) today reported record results for the second quarter of fiscal 2006. In
addition, the company increased its full-year earnings outlook.
ADVERTISEMENT

(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20030423/JCILOGO )

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John M. Barth said, "The quarterly
operating performance was in line with our expectations. Our strategies for
profitable growth and disciplined approach to cost reduction and quality
improvements continue to enable us to achieve our financial commitments. We
remain confident that we will extend our track record for consecutive years of
record sales and earnings in 2006."

Mr. Barth continued, "We have 136,000 employees around the world who are
devoted to our customers, to continuous improvement and to innovation. They
make us successful, and I commend them for their efforts."

Second-Quarter Results

For the three months ended March 31, 2006, sales increased 18% to a record $8.2
billion from $6.9 billion last year, primarily reflecting increases in the
building efficiency and power solutions businesses. The negative effect of
foreign currency in the quarter reduced sales by approximately $315 million.

Operating income was a record $266 million versus $43 million which was reduced
by a 2005 restructuring charge of $210 million. The tax rate in the 2006
quarter was 17.3%, reflecting a cumulative reduction in the annual base
effective tax rate to 21% from 24.3% (see tax note). This reduction principally
reflects a higher proportion of 2006 earnings coming from lower tax
jurisdictions. The company expects the tax rate in 2007 to be within the range
of 23% to 24%.

Income from continuing operations in the current quarter was $162 million
versus $54 million in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations were $0.83 compared with $0.28 in the prior year.

Second-Quarter Results Excluding Special Items (Non-GAAP)

The following discussion focuses on the performance of the ongoing operations
of the company and therefore excludes 2005 special items such as restructuring
costs, gains from businesses divested, and a tax credit. A reconciliation to
GAAP measures is provided in the footnotes to the attached Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating income was 5% higher than the prior year due to increased earnings
from the building efficiency and power solutions businesses. Income from
continuing operations of $162 million compares with $165 million for 2005, as
the net interest expense and acquisition accounting related to the December
2005 York acquisition more than offset York's earnings and the benefit of the
lower base effective tax rate. Diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations were $0.83 versus $0.85 in the prior year.

Interior experience sales for the second quarter of 2006 totaled $4.8 billion,
approximately level with sales in 2005 while operating income was $135 million,
1% lower than in the prior year. Excluding the negative effect of foreign
currency, sales increased 5% and operating income increased 8%. Industry light
vehicle production in North America was approximately 4% higher; European
production is estimated to have been up 2%. The European interiors operating
margin increased over the prior year. The North American operating margin
declined year-over-year due to commodity pressures and a negative vehicle mix,
but improved slightly compared to the first quarter of 2006.

Power solutions sales were up 29% to $874 million from $680 million due to the
impact of the July 2005 acquisition of Delphi's battery business as well as
higher organic shipments. Operating income increased 14% to $75 million from
$66 million due to the higher volume and improved operational efficiencies.
Operating margin declined due to record high lead costs, most of which are
expected to be recovered in customer pricing, as well as the Delphi battery
acquisition.

Building efficiency sales increased 74% to $2.5 billion from $1.4 billion in
2005 primarily reflecting the York acquisition as well as increased sales of
control systems and services for non-residential buildings in North America.
Operating income increased 10% to $56 million from $51 million due to the
higher volume. Excluding non-recurring acquisition costs of $22 million,
operating income was up 53%. York's results improved over its 2005 second
quarter, led by a strong performance by its residential air conditioning
business. The backlog of uncompleted contracts was $3.3 billion, up 8% from the
previous year (pro-forma including York).

2006 Full Year and Third-Quarter Outlook

Johnson Controls forecast that its diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations for 2006 would be in a range of $5.25 - $5.35, including a $0.22 to
$0.24 benefit from the lower effective tax rate. The company previously
provided earnings guidance of $5.00 to $5.15 per share from continuing
operations. Sales expectations for the year are unchanged at approximately $32
billion.

For the third quarter of 2006 the company anticipates diluted earnings per
share from continuing operations of $1.65 to $1.70, an increase of 26% to 30%
over the $1.31 per share earned in the third quarter of 2005.

Johnson Controls said the expected substantial increase in earnings in the
second half of 2006 is primarily attributable to its building efficiency
business, reflecting the absence of York acquisition accounting costs, the
positive seasonality of the air conditioning industry and increased customer
demand. The company said it also expects a continued strong performance by its
European interiors and power solutions businesses.

The company expects that its financial position will remain strong. It
anticipates that its ratio of total debt to total capitalization will decline
to approximately 40% by the end of 2006 from 45% at March 31, 2006.

"We continued to make progress transforming our businesses to take advantage of
the global growth opportunities," Mr. Barth said. "The underlying performance
of each of our businesses continues to improve. Additionally, as we improve our
cost structure, we continue to identify more opportunity to deliver greater
value to our customers."

ABT and JNJ - weak revenue growth but earnings were OK. Both stock are cheap
and should do OK even in a slowing economy. I am ho,ding and migh even be

C - decent earnings in a difficult interest environment. Foreign operation
almost contribute 50% of C's earnings nowadays. Strong capitalization, 4%
dividend yield and sharecount sinking 4% due to buybacks. A cheap stock worth
holding, IMO.

In reply to my previous post, I have sold a majority of my ARDI. I currently
hold only 2000 shares. My purchase price was around 3.5 and have sold for an
average of 5.85. I added to my position in CKSW, an ARDI competitor, as I think
it is a better value based on its enterprise value.

I still hold IMOS and NPTH. IMOS should have a good first quarter and record
sales for 2006 and sells for a PE of less than 10. My average price is 5.00.

NPTH came out with stellar first quarter results. As previously stated, the
stock is my largest holding and, though not as great a value, this company has
many growth opportunities ahead. They have stated they have more opportunities
than resources. It is a small, illiquid OTC stock, but I really I like the
market cap, management, and the opportunities it has in its business. I also
think the new CEO will increase margins as he has in the past. Currently the
largest mutual fund owning the stock is the Wasatch Value Fund with over

GSHF controls two public entities, VRDM and INSQ.

I've seen INSQ trade much more than a BILLION shares per day.

NOt to worry I'm sure brinks has analyzed each and every one of them. *S*
Silver really got hammered today. I wonder if there were a lot of newbie
speculators who are now broke. When a commodity drops 15% in one day there is
bound to be considerable pain attached. I added even more SIL towards the
close. so I bought it twice today. May well go lower tomorrow but I expect it
to see 30s in the next year. Interesing to me that KHDH and ME showed decent
gains in a sea of red for my portfolio, edv held up pretty well today all
things considering. TO finance the SIL I liquidated 1/2 of my position in NTO
and 1/4 of my position in CHK. and also added more IVN.

AGT is on the list. High low range was disconcerting. I have a large position.
Added small amount today, but not at the best prices. Never give much weight to
after hours but wonder if todays action means anything given the pending
release of reserve data for Black Fox.

APOLLO GOLD CORP CDA (RT-ECN)
Symbol: AGT
Last Trade: 0.799 5:27PM ET
After Hours Change: 0.079 (10.97%)
Today's Change: 0.011 (1.36%)
Bid: 0.67
Ask: 0.78

Am a potential seller at pre determined levels. Guess I am also a buyer on
drops, if I want to be bothered. At present, I intend to keep a large core
position. Adding makes little difference to the end result given that I can't,
nor would I add amounts that would make a significant impact on the amount
already owned.

They are no longer reporting M3 which is one big fat warning sign.

Lookout below, US dollar.

Think of it this way, 500 junior stocks is but 3% of the total number of stocks
in your portfolio. Piece of cake....

Speaking of INSEQ Corp and their stock INSQ.ob.

You need to buy a new calculator!

1,000,000,000 *.007 does not equal $70,000!

Try $7,000,000 per day.

Todays volume was 206,261,070 or $1,443,827.49.

PS Walmart will sell you a calculator for $0.99 perhaps...

I doubled up on my WON position today (@ $9.57) which may be trouble as it hit
a new low today. I found this article which confirms my earlier post that
Westwood One is developing their distribution channels to offer their services
across many different platforms.

This article quantifies management's goal for future revenues based on these
new distribution platforms they are developing.

Westwood Extends Content to Other Platforms
Katy Bachman
FEBRUARY 27, 2006 -
(http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/search/article_display.jsp?schema=&vnu_content_id=
002074811 )

From the article:"...Peter Kosann, president and CEO for Westwood said the
company would like to grow its reliance on revenue from other distribution
platforms from the current 8 percent to 15-30 percent...."

The company is going to make significant investments into new equipment and
consolidating operations and stated that first quarter expenses will be in
double digits.

There may be one more buying opportunity when the next quarter financials are
released. Based on the growth of the Internet sector (i.e. Yahoo & Goggle), WON
may indeed achieve the high end on their revenue forecast from these "other
distribution platforms".

The dividend is not too bad either at 4.2%.

In 2-3 years this company could be a three bagger if management can show steady
revenue growth from these new distribution channels.

Thanks. Yes, I realized right after I wrote it that 7.x10^(-3) dollars/share
times 10^9 shares has got to be 7x10^6 or 7 million dollars.

Very embarrassing error to me personally and professionally. I didn't know
whether to just post correction or let it go assuming nobody reads my posts in
any detail anyway.

I have maybe 50 or 60 calculators around the house. Maybe I need to pick one up
and properly use it before I spout off these numbers.

Hi Madharry - Peter Kosann was recently promoted to CEO for WON (Westwood One).
He has been responsible for Network advertising since 2001 so it appears he
understands what their customers want and are willing to pay for.

I am still learning more about the company and the potential new advertising
dollars that can be generated from this "non traditional" medium (I am
impressed by Google's revenue growth!). WON is a "pure play" as a content
provider.

Peter Kosann was responsible for signing a contract to obtain a 6% interest in
Webradio.com in 2000, so he has been around this emerging technology for
awhile.

Streaming audio takes on radio challenge
By Eve Epstein
May 19, 2000 1:01 pm PT

From the article:"...Peter Kosann, a senior vice president at radio giant
Westwood One, in New York, doesn't see the Internet bringing revolutionary
change.

"Do I think it's an emerging technology that's interesting? Yes," Kosann says.
"Do I think it will do significant harm to terrestrial radio? No."

However, Westwood One is hardly ignoring the Internet. The company recently
entered a multiyear agreement with WebRadio.com, a subsidiary of GEO
Interactive Media Group, in Woodland Hills, Calif. The agreement gives Westwood
a 6 percent stake in WebRadio, which will offer discounted pricing and media
sales such as digital downloads, CDs, movies, and video game sales.

According to Kosann, Westwood was intrigued by WebRadio's technology, which
allows listeners to hear audio without downloading a browser. That could be
crucial at work environments in which employees are not permitted to download
software onto a computer.

Although the future of streaming audio is cloudy, the technology -- and its
potential for profit -- is garnering some attention. ...".

Madharry, it's hard to quantify the expertise of the CEO especially one that
builds a business using non-traditional distribution channels like wireless &
the Internet. CEO Eric Schmidt could not turn Novell around but seems to be
doing pretty good as CEO at Google.

As a value investment, WON seems like a low risk value play that could
capitalize on the Internet growth. I also like that they produce the content
and can sell it into these different distribution channels.

I have been wrong plenty of times before so it is possible that this CEO could
mess things up too.
