Good Grub! Congratulations!

I use Beta several ways. In my long term portfolio I like to see whether I have
a good mix of Beta(i.e not all >2 or not all >0and<1 or not all <0).

Mostly, though, I use it for my shorter term trading buys. If I'm looking for a
stock to make a move soon, it is much more likely to do so with a higher Beta.
Additionally, the move is likely to be more intense.

dimitri,

Interesting article, although I'd tend to disagree with the premise that
companies will jump on the bandwagon to correct deceptive accounting practices.
Without restarting the debate on option issues, I still consider options
considerably less critical than practices of capitalizing current expenses as
assets, and off balance sheet tricks to shore up the books. The recent
legislation is almost completely without teeth and basically amounts to the
addition of one more bureaucratic red tape machine, heartily endorsed by paper
tigers. CEOs and CFOs are already issuing PRs calling the bluff. When the
stakes are measured in the billions of dollars, the threat of a pleasant few
month stay in a country club prison is hardly a deterrent.

I recently started a small position in puts on HD after going over their
filings. Their filings are a joke as far as disclosure is concerned. Financing
of new locations is done off the balance sheet, expenses such as interest
payments are capitalized as assets and there is virtually no disclosure on
profits, losses, and exposure to credit card risk in their filings. They have
issued over 10 million credit accounts, they admit to owning a portfolio of
these loan pools, 21% of revenues are related to house credit accounts, and
they actively hedge their interest rate exposure.

Nowhere in their filings is there any break down of this segment of their
operations, and there is no disclosure of how these loan pools are funded. They
pay $5 million a year to their auditors for "consulting fees". Insiders have
taken out loans from the company in excess of $40 million. Compensation levels
are absurd, not to mention the awards in the form of stock and options. They
happily certified their books without a quiver. Why shouldn't they? It's all
good according to GAAP.

The basic problem is how to get someone who makes $150K a year to prosecute
someone who makes $30 million a year, especially when "investigations" are done
under the table without any disclosure to the public. It's hard to imagine a
more perfect set up for corruption and graft. Not to mention the only CEOs and
CFOs required to certify their accounts are those of companies with revenue in
excess of $1.2 billion. Why not make it a standard practice for all publicly
held companies? Aren't bribes from small caps worth bothering with?

Maybe when enough private investors have exited the markets for institutional
investors to start exercising their voting rights as owners, management will
end up being accountable for how public companies are run. But until GAAP
accounting is replaced with tax accounting, I really can't think of any good
reason to hold a long position for any length of time in any US company.

That sounds to me like a lot better system than one set of books for the tax
man and one set of books to show investors. At least if a company wants to pad
the numbers, the public in general gets some benefit from increased tax
revenue. It also strikes me as likely that paying more tax would provide some
incentive to report numbers more in line with actual real world results.

Stock Options accounting and the Value Investor

I know it seems as though this issue is both murky and seemingly largely
unimportant in the overall scheme of deriving the fair value of most companies.
However, in the next several posts I will attempt to show that sometimes how
the stock options are accounted for can have surprisingly negative implications
for the value investor.

The company I will use to highlight what I mean is DELL. This is a company that
many would agree represents many good things about technology, business, and
seizing new opportunity (the internet) and actualizing it to nearly its full
potential for growth and profit.

If you will bear with me through this process, I think you may be surprised at
the outcome.

As a value investor, I have been virtually salivating over the trend in stock
prices because, finally, there may be some larger cap companies that will
qualify under the rubric "value".

During my wanderings over the net last week I saw several posts that indicated
that DELL's stock options, if properly accounted for, would result in negative
earnings rather than the positives that had been reported publicly
(unfortunately, I don't remember who posted or where, or I'd give them credit
for bringing this to my attention). The first time I read this, I put it down
to perhaps a short-seller with an agenda, and pretty well dismissed the notion.
the second time I saw it, it was a different poster and some of the numbers
this poster used were reportedly from the Statement of Cash Flows. Since this
has been an area of focus for me over the last several years, I thought I'd do
my own research and see what I'd discover.

Before I get into the actual numbers themselves, I'd like to address
methodology. Both the common short-cut version and my own more detailed
version.

The common short cut for determining Free Cash Flow(FCF) is Cash From
Operations (CFO) minus CAPEX.

For those unfamiliar with the Statement of Cash Flows, before your eyes start
glazing over, let me just give a quick refresher of how we get to CFO. The
starting point is the Net Income reported as the bottom line on the Income
Statement. The Net Income is adjusted to remove all the non-cash items imbedded
in the Income Statement (like Depreciation, Amortization, reserves accounts,
etc). Once these adjustments are made, the answer derived is called "Cash From
Operations" and is supposed to represent the cash earnings of the company for
that period.

So, to recap.....

The common shortcut formula is: CFO - CAPEX = FCF

This short-cut will work most of the time, but for a company that wants to
mislead investors and analysts and knows how widespread the short-cut usage is,
there are other ways to report the numbers that by-pass this shortcut. Whether
what DELL did is intentional or not, I cannot say. The impact of their
methodology, however, makes me suspicious.

The way I calculate FCF is by starting at the bottom number of the Statement of
Cash Flows and moving up through the "Results of Financing Activities" and the
"Results of Investing Activities" backing out all non-operational entries, such
as money received from selling stock or borrowing money or selling land and
equipment. I also add back all deductions for the optional uses of cash like
paying off debt, paying dividends, and buying back stock for the treasury.
Theoretically, the number I derive using this method should be the same as the
number derived from using the short-cut formula. In the case of DELL, it is not
even close. How many other companies might use similar techniques I don't know,
but this analysis has certainly opened my eyes regarding the possibilities.

I know these posts will be longish, but I hope to give enough insight into the
issue to stimulate others to research this aspect of the financials prior to
making investments.

DELL a look at the Statement of Cash Flows (page 1)

The first thing I want to do is to indicate that all the quotes and all the
numbers I use in the following analysis are taken directly from DELL's most
recent 10K filing with the SEC. here is the link:
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/826083/000095013402004432/d96254e10-k.ht

First I'll list some quotes from this filing to set the stage:
"Dell Computer Corporation (the “Company”) is the world’s leading computer
systems company and a premier provider of computing products and services. In
fiscal year 2002 the Company’s revenue was $31.2 billion. The Company was
founded in 1984 by Michael Dell on a simple concept: by selling computer
systems directly to customers, the Company could best understand customer needs
and efficiently provide the most effective computing solutions to meet those
needs. The Company’s climb to market leadership is the result of a relentless
focus on delivering the best customer experience by selling computer systems
and services directly to its customers." 

and then later in the report:

"The Company’s objective is to maximize stockholder value by executing a
strategy that focuses on a balance of three priorities: liquidity,
profitability and growth. Management believes that opportunity exists for
continued worldwide growth by increasing the Company’s market presence in its
existing markets, entering new markets, and pursuing additional product and
service opportunities."

and then this:

"The Company achieved industry-leading results in fiscal 2002 as year-on-year
unit shipments increased by 15% while industry shipments declined 5% (the first
ever year-on-year industry decline), resulting in market share gains in every
region and product line. The Company attained and solidified its position as
the No. 1 personal computer systems company in the world. The Company generated
relatively stable year-on-year net revenue of over $31 billion, and achieved
operating earnings of over $2 billion (excluding the impact of restructuring
actions), whereas its five largest competitors collectively experienced
declining revenues and operating losses in their personal computer systems and
related businesses. Additionally, an intense focus on operating expenses
resulted in the Company reducing operating expenses (excluding special charge)
as a percent of revenues for the year.

In addition to maximizing profitability and growth, the Company delivered
outstanding liquidity during the fiscal year with operating cash flow of $3.8
billion and with $8.3 billion in ending cash and investments. The Company
exited fiscal 2002 with a record cash conversion cycle of negative 36 days." 

So what's not to like?

Some numbers from the income statement and elsewhere:

Stockholder’s Equity:
Year ended:
2/02--4,694
2/01--5,622
1/00--5,308

Weighted Average number of diluted shares
Year ended:
2/02--2726
2/01--2746
1/00--2728

Reported EPS (diluted)
Year ended:
2/02--$0.46
2/01--$0.79
1/00--$0.61

I'll start the numbers crunching in the next post and see if we, as investors,
end up with the same "flavor" as the report projects for us.

Dell a look at the Statement of Cash Flows (page2)

From the Statement of Cash Flows (p.34 of the 10K)

Net cash provided by operating activities:
year ended: (numbers in millions)
2/02--3,797
2/01--4,195
1/00--3,926

CAPEX
2/02--303
2/01--482
1/00--401

Therefore using the shortcut formula to determine Free Cash Flow (FCF) we get:

2/02-- 3,797 - 303 = 3,494
2/01-- 4,195 - 482 = 3,713
1/00-- 3,926 - 401 = 3,525

Surely does look like a cash machine from here! What's not to like about a
company that apparently throws off in excess of 3 billion dollars in Free Cash
Flow a year? Or does it?.....

Another quote from the 10K might indicate that all may not be as it seems. The
quote is theirs, the bold type accent is mine:

"Share Repurchase Program — The Company has a share repurchase program that it
uses primarily to manage the dilution resulting from shares issued under the
Company’s employee stock plans. As of the end of fiscal year 2002, the Company
had cumulatively repurchased 940 million shares over a six-year period out of
its authorized 1 billion share repurchase program, for an aggregate cost of
$9.8 billion. During fiscal year 2002, the Company repurchased 68 million
shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $3.0 billion. The Company has
utilized equity instrument contracts to facilitate its repurchase of common
stock, but has not entered into any new contracts subsequent to October of
2000. At February 1, 2002, the Company held equity options that allow for the
purchase of 25 million shares of common stock at an average price of $58 per
share. At February 1, 2002, the Company also had outstanding put obligations
covering 51 million shares with an average exercise price of $45 per share for
a total of $2.3 billion (compared to a total of $5.4 billion at February 2,
2001). The equity instruments are exercisable only at the date of expiration
and expire at various dates through the first quarter of fiscal 2004. However,
these instruments contain termination triggers that allow the holder to force
settlement beginning at an $8 share price. The outstanding put obligations at
February 1, 2002 permitted net share settlement at the Company’s option and,
therefore, did not result in a liability on the accompanying Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position included in “Item 8 — Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.” The Company’s practice has been to physically settle
in-the-money put contracts as they mature by repurchasing the shares subject to
the contracts and plans to continue to utilize this settlement option. 

This section says clearly (to me anyway) that this money is really an expense,
not an optional use of cash by buying stock for the treasury. Keep this in mind
for when we derive FCF by using the "bottom up" method I described in the first
post of this series.

Timba,

Interesting analysis. It almost looks like the issue is one of expensing stock
buy backs as a current operating expense rather than one of expensing options
as wages. The worst part about GAAP is it makes it fantastically difficult to
tell where the money goes and there's no uniform treatment from company to
company. If a company issues a few shares of new stock to control cash burn,
it's not the same as spending $50 a share in the open market to issue as
compensation. If nothing else, I'd think insider trading regulations should
apply to the transactions. I've seen a lot of cases where a company will
announce buy backs while insiders are exercising options and dumping the stock
in the open market. At the very least the six month rule should apply. If the
company is buying, insiders should be prohibited from selling for six months. I
think there are times when buy backs make some sense. For example, when a
company is debt free and has a lot of cash at the bottom of the chart. But I
don't think insiders should be allowed to use shareholder assets to make a
market for their personal sales.

Truly outstanding analysis. I especially liked the fact that you mentioned a
passage from their 10K which states that the stock buy-back is to prevent
dilution from the company issuing stock options. I agree with you 100% that the
purchase of stock, in this case, should be included in CapEx.

Dell a look at the Statement of Cash Flows (page 3)

Let us now try to determine FCF from the bottom up.

Again, all numbers are in the millions.

Net (decrease)increase in cash:
year ended:
2/02--(1,269)
2/01-- 1,101
1/00-- 2,083

Cash Flows from financing activities:
<par>
year ended 2/02 2/01 1/00
Purchases of
Common stock (3,000) (2,700) (1,061)
Issuance of
common stock 295 404 289
Employee plans
Other 3 (9) 77
------ ------- --------
Net Cash Used
in Financing
Activities (2,702) (2,305) (695)</par>

The adjustments to the bottom line cash flow from these entries would be to
subtract the money from the issuance of stock for the employee plans but to do
adjust nothing else. The reasoning here is that DELL has clearly said that cash
to buy stock was just to prevent dilution from the exercize of stock options,
so that is considered (by me) to be an operational expense because the
presumption is that the employee would have insisted on being paid more cash if
the options were used as an incentive. The amounts listed under "other" aren't
significant enough for me to go searching out what they might be, so I'll give
them the benefit of the doubt and not back them out.

So... having gone through the Financing portion our numbers look like this:
year ended:

2/02-- (1,269) - 295 = (1,564)
2/01-- 1,101 - 404 = 697
1/00-- 2,083 - 289 = 1,794

For the Cash Flows from investing activities I'll take a short cut and say we
will add the amount spent on investment purchases and subtract the amounts
received from "maturities and sales" and use the numbers just derived as the
starting point, so we have:

years ended:
2/02-- (1,564) + 5,382 - 3,425 = 393
2/01-- 697 + 2,606 - 2,331 = 972
1/00-- 1,794 + 3,101 - 2,319 = 2,576

So the real Free Cash Flow appears to me to be:
year ended:

2/02-- 393
2/01-- 972
1/00-- 2,576

So what conclusions do I derive from this?

Well one of them is that while DELL may be a successful business, in year ended
2/02 it is paying almost 90% of the profits to insiders via stock options. (393
Real FCF divided by 3,797 CFO means that only 10.4% of the profits get to the
bottom line). In year ended 2/01 it paid about 77% to insiders (Real FCF of 972
divided by CFO of 4,195 means only 23.2% made it to the bottom line). In year
ended 1/00 almost 65.6% flowed to the bottom line.

This shows me that the trend of giving profits to the insiders is accelerating.

One of the conclusions that I have drawn is that DELL is a public company that
is treating its profits very similarly to a private company, they're dividing
them among the insiders. While this behavior may be OK for a private company, I
think it highly inappropriate for a public one.

This "bottom up" method of FCF determination surely has highlighted the
importance of full and accurate accounting for stock option expense.

What you are trying to compare is a company's Income Statement to a company's
Statement of Cash Flows.

Put simply, if a company states that they had $1 in Net Income due to GAAP
accounting, that does not mean that the company generated, from operations, $1.

Let's make a simplistic analysis. You are Don Earl, Inc. and you have a widget
that cost you $30. Assume no liabilities or other various forms of assets and
no taxes.

Therefore, on your Balance Sheet you have Inventory of $30.

Now, let's Assume that Dave, Inc. purchases that "widget" from you in the next
quarter.

Therefore, you report "earnings" next quarter.

Income Statement:

Revenues: $50 (Dave, Inc.'s purchase)
Cost of Goods Sold: $30

Profit: $20

Now, I have not yet "paid" you, therefore that $50 is on credit.

In the previous period, you had one asset which was Inventory valued @ $30.

The current period, your Inventory went to $0 (you sold the widget); however,
your Accounts Receivable Increased to $50

As for your cash flows

Net Income: $20
Decrease in Inventory: +30
Increase in A/R: -50

Cash Flow from Operations: 0

>>7/20/02 BARRONS ALPERT: Borrowing trouble

Actrade Financial Technologies shares collapsed to nearly 3 this month, after
the company disclosed a sales drop and layoffs. The New York-based trade
financier's stock, which hit a high of 40 last year, was at 24 in February when
we reported problems with its lending practices.

Founded after Amos Aharoni fled Israeli creditors a decade ago, Actrade claimed
its Internet-based lending methods would revolutionize trade financing the way
that credit cards had revolutionized consumer purchases. The growing profits
reported by Actrade in recent years lifted the Nasdaq-traded shares to the top
of many value investors' computer screens.

But a class-action complaint filed Wednesday in Manhattan's federal court
alleges that Actrade's profits were inflated by transactions with offshore
entities controlled by Actrade affiliates, as well as by domestic deals that
were really subterfuges for moving funds between related entities.

In an exceptionally detailed pleading by the Boston law firm Shapiro Haber &
Urmy, the stock-fraud suit says Actrade's own loan documents show the company
was financing deals in which the buyer and seller had the same address and
signature. Citing an unnamed former employee, the complaint says more than $160
million in Actrade financings backed dealings between a parent firm called
Pacific Realty Group and Pacific's subsidiaries and affiliates -- ultimately
leading to default.

Actrade also paid commissions to a Brazilian firm for facilitating a purchase
by a firm controlled by defendant Aharoni, according to the allegations.
Financials for another purported customer were sent to Aharoni's New York
apartment, suggesting to the plaintiffs that Aharoni controlled that customer,
too. Yet another Actrade customer was incorporated in Panama by a lawyer that
plaintiffs allege had close connections to Aharoni. And funding for these
offshore deals purportedly came from a British Virgin Islands-registered
institution whose phone number was that of Aharoni's bankruptcy lawyer in
Israel. The questionable foundations of these dealings, says the complaint,
"indicate that the cash claimed to be located in offshore financial
institutions is nonexistent."

According to an unnamed former employee cited in the complaint, Aharoni had
offshore accounts that he used to sell stock. Actrade offered no comment on my
inquiries. But in June, the company announced that it was the subject of
informal inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National
Association of Securities Dealers.

Stock Options Accounting and Insider Profit-Grabbing:

This look at DELL has been very revealing for me.

They reported net income of $.46/share
They claimed (and showed) cash from operations success of $1.39/share ($3,797
CFO divided by 2,726 diluted shares)
We derived Real FCF flowing to the bottom line of $.14/share

So....let's see....if I want to be compensated, let's say, twice the amount I
could make on a CD for assuming the risk of being in the market....what would a
share of DELL (or any company making these numbers) be worth to me?

Let's assume a generous 5% CD rate. Then I would want 10% rate of return.
So....

$.46 divided by 10% means a share should cost me no more than $4.60/share based
on reported EPS

$1.39 divided by 10% means a share should cost me no more than $13.90/share
based on claimed CFO.

$.144/share divided by 10% means a share should cost me no more than
$1.44/share based on Real FCF.

No more than $1.44/share! Amazing! And it closed today above $24.00. Think it
has some room to drop yet?

I think what prompted me to post this analysis is a combination of the sheer
effrontery of DELL to take 90% of owner's earnings and divvy them up internally
and the fact that I haven't heard one single analyst mention this finding. I
mean DELL has to be one of the most followed companies in America. How many
mutual funds and pension plans must own this dog?

What does that say about the analytical skill level of our so-called
professional fund managers?

The next post covers the accounting gimmicry they used.

Stock Options Accounting and Insider Profit Grabbing (page 2)

From DELL's 10K (bolding is mine):
"At February 1, 2002, the Company had $8.3 billion of total cash and
investments (including investments in equity securities discussed below), all
of which is stated at fair value. The Company’s investment policy is to manage
its total cash and investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity
while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full
investment of available funds.

and:
"The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which require
the use of management’s estimates. The Company believes its most critical
accounting policies relate to revenue recognition and warranty accruals....."

and:
There were 290 million, 254 million, and 264 million options to purchase the
Company’s common stock available for future grants under the Option Plans at
February 1, 2002, February 2, 2001, and January 28, 2000, respectively.

and:
Fair Value Disclosures — The weighted average fair value of stock options at
date of grant was $13.04, $20.98, and $22.64, per option for options granted
during fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Additionally, the weighted
average fair value of the purchase rights under the employee stock purchase
plan granted in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000 was $6.74, $13.95, and $11.12 per
right, respectively. The weighted average fair value of options and purchase
rights under the employee stock purchase plan was determined based on the
Black-Scholes model……

What a crock! Why not use the actual cost to replace of $44.12/share (3 billion
divided by 68 million) if not for the intent to hide the real cost?

And then the real doozy:
Had the Company accounted for its Option Plans and employee stock purchase plan
by recording compensation expense based on the fair value at the grant date on
a straight-line basis over the vesting period, stock-based compensation costs
would have reduced pretax income by $964 million ($694 million, net of taxes),
$620 million ($434 million, net of taxes), and $329 million ($224 million, net
of taxes) in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The pro forma effect on
basic earnings per common share would have been a reduction of $0.27, $0.17,
and $0.09 for fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The pro forma effect
on diluted earnings per common share would have been a reduction of $0.27,
$0.16, and $0.08 for fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

They admitted it cost them 3 BILLION to buy back enough shares to prevent
dilution in fiscal 2002....almost twice as much as they are claiming it cost
for all three years!

Now, I have no doubt that DELL will be able to prove that they followed GAAP
procedures in the reporting of the numbers. But the INTENT....ah, that may be
another issue.

So what's to be done to correct this kind of abuse?

I recommend some statutory changes:

1). Force companies not to dilute shares due to stock options.
2). The cost of buying shares to prevent dilution should be the HIGHER of a).
the actual cost to buy them; b). the fair market price of the shares on the day
of exercise; or c). the cost of buying them if they are taken from treasury.
3). Limit the amount of profit that can be taken by insiders to 20% of CFO or
Net Income or taxable income whichever is less.
4). Some kind of regulation prohibiting practices which would delay a company
from excerising options in one year to claim them in another year. (The idea of
this is to try to prevent manipulation of the exercise recognition).

OK, I'm done!

"If nothing else, I'd think insider trading regulations should apply to the
transactions. I've seen a lot of cases where a company will announce buy backs
while insiders are exercising options and dumping the stock in the open market.
At the very least the six month rule should apply. If the company is buying,
insiders should be prohibited from selling for six months. I think there are
times when buy backs make some sense. For example, when a company is debt free
and has a lot of cash at the bottom of the chart. But I don't think insiders
should be allowed to use shareholder assets to make a market for their personal
sales.

the fact is that DELL is indeed a cash machine but spends the cash generated by
operations in a stock repurchases. However since the number of shares is
apparently about flat, all the cash is essentially used up to eliminate
diluation - or in other words DELL does not have any free cash flow at all. My
own method of calculating Free cash flow does not use the income or cash flow
statement at all:

I calculate the net cash change (cash- debt (long term and short term) of any
given period - the only problem is that this can be distorted by asset sales or
equity offerings so I back them out. This will also show that DELL does notm
have any free cash flow.

You lost me on that one. Unless we're going back more than a few posts, I don't
recall making the comparison. At the same time I do like to see some
relationship between free cash flow from operations, and earnings according to
GAAP. If Don Earl, Inc. earns $20, with AR at $50, somewhere along the line
there should be some cash coming in as the $50 is collected. Unless DSO is in
excess of 90 days, on a quarterly basis, the $50 should be flowing as cash with
$20 showing up as profit AND free cash flow from operations. If that isn't the
case then Don Earl, Inc. is likely to go the same route as Global Crossings,

From the DELL 10K:

"...The Company has utilized equity instrument contracts to facilitate its
repurchase of common stock, but has not entered into any new contracts
subsequent to October of 2000. At February 1, 2002, the Company held equity
options that allow for the purchase of 25 million shares of common stock at an
average price of $58 per share. At February 1, 2002, the Company also had
outstanding put obligations covering 51 million shares with an average exercise
price of $45 per share for a total of $2.3 billion (compared to a total of $5.4
billion at February 2, 2001). The equity instruments are exercisable only at
the date of expiration and expire at various dates through the first quarter of
fiscal 2004. However, these instruments contain termination triggers that allow
the holder to force settlement beginning at an $8 share price. The outstanding
put obligations at February 1, 2002 permitted net share settlement at the
Company’s option and, therefore, did not result in a liability on the
accompanying Consolidated Statement of Financial Position included in “Item 8 —
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The Company’s practice has been
to physically settle in-the-money put contracts as they mature by repurchasing
the shares subject to the contracts and plans to continue to utilize this
settlement option."

At this rate of decline, it does not appear likely that DELL will exercise the
call options on 25 million shares because of the $58 strike price.

However the 51 million shares of put obligations with an average strike of $45
for an obligation of 2.3 BILLION dollars coming due between now and 3/31/04
will obligate them to buy at $45. Not only that, but if DELL gets priced by the
market where their Real FCF says they ought to trade, the provision that kicks
in when the share price hits $8 could put a real hurting on the cash situation.

I love the part taken from their 10K that I highlighted with bolding. Let's see
if I understand the situation here. DELL buys back shares only to cover stock
option dilution, so they don't have inventory. They claim they don't have
liability because they can settle the put obligations with stock, so I guess
their intention is to dilute shares by issuing more, thereby diluting ownership
interest by $2.3 BILLION dollars?

"...Maybe I am missing something in your analysis ..."

My analysis was only a limited analysis related to their reported Cash Flow. I
have not looked at their NetNet value, or anything else. Once I saw that the
insiders got 90% of the money, it made me mad and it made me sick. I didn't
look further.

Dell's problems with puts are somewhat unrelated to the their option story.
Selling puts was a market speculation: it worked well in bull market, it
backfired in bear market. It is like buying shares at the same time as options
are issued. If shares go up and options get exercised, this is a smart move. If
shares go down, it is a stupid move.
On the other hand, if company does not buy stock when it issues options, it
loses in bull market and wins in bear.

BTW, Dell cannot cover their put obligations by issuing shares, since they have
an obligation to BUY shares, not to SELL. Unless they decided to sell enough
shares to be able to buy them under puts for much higher prices. This would be
totally stupid.

Jurgis or Timba.. I haven't thought this through but IF Dell intended to buy
back shares or even if they suddenly decided to buy back shares.. could that
share buyback satisfy the put selling position AND retire shares at the same
time? If so it would be rather brilliant.. because they took some money in
selling the puts, then buy back the shares (which is good.. fewer shares in
float) at a lower price. Either way they make out ok.. if the stock had gone up
they pocket the put sales, when the stock goes down they cover by buying shares
out of circulation.. and who's to say they can't sell more puts now to cover
buying previous obligations.

I have a suspicion that with HP's problems with CPQ having caused lots of
channel problems.. they gained significant market share. In addition, they've
been selling EMC storage systems like hot cakes.. now they're going into the
printer market with momentum that HP's losing and looking ahead at PDA

in the mid-$20s -- to be bought in stages through 2004. Then again, Dell has
only 60 million shares left in its buyback program, with 940 million of the 1
billion goal already bought.

Investors who recently witnessed the implosion of another Texas company that
courted much more risk, though, will take note of Dell's disclosure that the 51
million share obligation contains a footnote. If Dell's share price drops to
$8, it has to settle up. Of course, no company thinks it will suffer a stock
catastrophe, but if that were to happen somehow, Dell would have $2.3 billion
in put obligations to cover, a fine portion of the $3.6 billion in cash it had
on hand when it ended fiscal 2002 on Feb. 1."

Jurgis, re options. Are you familiar with the term "notional value" as it
applies to derivatives? JPM has exposure to 30 TRILLION in notional value
mostly to interest rate derivatives. I have jnpr 01/03 200 calls naked and
assume that the notional exposure in each option is $20,000, although my
exposure is nil(<$5). If this is meaning of notional then it would be very
difficult to discern just how much risk JPM really has. In any case they are a
hedge fund masquerading as a bank.

So, let's see if I understand your rationale here. A company goes from taking
35% of owner's earnings, to taking 77% the next year and then 90% the year
after that is....all of a sudden.....going to change? You're kidding, right?!?

I hope your investing decisions are better thought out than this type of
rationale, or you just might as well send them the check directly instead of
play-acting about really having an interest in sharing the profits of the

"...I take it you're long.. 

I hope that was humor, and I missed it. No, James, since I discovered that they

Jim,
Sorry, no go. Dell has put obligations to buy shares... at $45 or so. And they
have to do this whether they want or not - the put buyers are not going to
allow puts expire in money. Dell can then retire the purchased shares, but the
problem is they would be paying $45 and not $24 per share.

Below is a link to the historical prices for DELL for the period of their last
10K (02/01/01--01/31/02). It appears to me that, during this period, they never
once closed above $30.00/share so your assessment appears to be validated.

If DELL could simply fulfill the put obligation with shares, then their AVERAGE
cost to buy the 68 million shares would have been more reflective of the market
pricing instead of the $44.12/share it was (3 billion/68 million).

This historical look at prices and what it reveals about the true nature of
their liability really makes it seem to me like they grossly misled the
shareholders when they said: "...The outstanding put obligations at February 1,
2002 permitted net share settlement at the Company’s option and, therefore, did
not result in a liability on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position..."

BTW, this does not apply to Dell. They are in naked put in the money situation

Agreed. Even more difficult, since JPM may have more complex derivatives than
just plain puts and calls. That's one of the reasons I try not to invest in

TimbaBear,

I had a long argument last year on the Zeev Hed thread with someone (an
accountant no less) who believed that options were fully accounted for by
dilution alone so there was no need to expense them - "a free lunch" as he put
it. The key to them as you've pointed out is to treat them as an ongoing
expense rather than a one time event. I said then that if they ever were
expensed the nasdaq would go under 1000 for sure (it was around 1800 at the
time) and that's what seems to be happening as they slowly get factored in.
This whole phenonomen is similar to that of the Robber Barons of the early 20th
Century who would dilute successful ventures as a matter of course but let
failures be carried by the shareholders alone.

The New Fundamentals
The High Cost of Dell's Stock Option Program
By Whitney Tilson
Special to TheStreet.com
6/26/01 1:44 PM ET
URL: http://www.thestreet.com/comment/thenewfundamentals/1464998.html

After owning Dell (DELL:Nasdaq) stock for many years, I sold the last of it in
January because I am not sure how much -- if any -- free cash flow Dell is
really generating for shareholders. Those last two words are critical, because
even with the slowdown in PC sales, Dell is undoubtedly generating robust free
cash flow. But a great deal of it appears to be going to management and
employees, in the form of stock options, rather than to common shareholders.

Dell spokesman T.R. Reid responded to my questions by noting the company is in
an industry in which stock options are the norm. "It is highly unlikely the
company could have achieved such high rates of growth over time, and resulting
shareholder value, without stock-based compensation as a tool for recruiting,
providing incentive to and retaining literally tens of thousands of employees,"
he said. Stock options, he added, have allowed Dell to take a relatively
conservative approach to other compensation.

I agree that Dell's stock option program is necessary, but investors should
carefully consider its true costs, which don't appear on the income statement.

This issue is not unique to Dell. As a recent article in Fortune notes, many
companies, especially those in the technology sector, issue large numbers of
stock options to employees. Similar arguments could be made for other companies
that issue large numbers of stock options to employees -- that includes most
companies in the technology sector, and many companies beyond it as well.

The Data
This chart shows Dell's free cash flow and amount spent on share repurchases on
the left axis, and the year-over-year change in diluted shares outstanding on
the right axis:
(they intersected)

Dell's Balancing Act
Is Dell's stock buyback program shareholder-friendly or not?

(Note: All numbers are in millions of dollars. Free cash flow is cash flow from
operations, minus depreciation and amortization, which I use as a proxy for
maintenance capital expenditures. I did not subtract cap ex, because this would
penalize Dell unfairly for its investments in growth. Normally, I also subtract
"tax benefits of employee stock plans," which in my opinion have nothing to do
with operating activities, but I have not done so here because free cash flow
is being compared with amounts spent repurchasing shares resulting from those
same employee stock plans.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dell generated healthy free cash flow, totaling $10.8 billion, in the 13
quarters covering fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001, plus the recently reported
first quarter of fiscal year 2002. (This figure significantly exceeded net
income of $6 billion during this period, demonstrating how the company's direct
model combined with effective working capital management -- not to mention $2.6
billion of tax benefits of employee stock plans -- enhances its cash flow.)
Dell used 56% of its free cash flow over these 13 quarters to buy back its own
shares, which can be a shareholder-friendly action.

This sounds great, but there are two problems with what is happening. First, it
is unclear whether Dell's share repurchase program in the past few years has
been creating or destroying shareholder value. The stated purpose of the
program is to offset the dilution due to Dell's stock option program, but
that's not necessarily a good thing. As Warren Buffett wrote in his 1999 annual
letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, "There is only one combination of
facts that makes it advisable for a company to repurchase its shares: First,
the company has available funds ... and, second, finds its stock selling in the
market below its intrinsic value, conservatively-calculated."

Dell has had plenty of cash in recent years, but was the stock really trading
below conservatively calculated intrinsic value above $40 and even $50 within
the past year? If not, then Dell was destroying shareholder value when, for
example, it spent $2.7 billion in FY 2001 buying back 65 million shares at an
average price of $41.54. Dell continues to spend nearly all of its free cash
flow to buy back shares in the belief that, according to Reid, "We don't think
we're a $24 to $26 stock long term." Current and prospective Dell investors
will have to decide for themselves whether they think this is a good use of
Dell's cash.

The second problem is that Dell is getting less and less bang for its share
repurchase buck. Let's look at the data for each year:

In fiscal year 1999, Dell spent $1.5 billion on share repurchases, equal to 65%
of free cash flow. Consequently, diluted shares outstanding fell by 2.6% during
the year, which is exactly what a shareholder would like to see (not to mention
that the stock nearly quadrupled).

In fiscal year 2000, Dell scaled back its share repurchases to only $1.1
billion, or 28% of free cash flow. Wise move, given the stock's lofty valuation
-- it traded at a price-to-earnings ratio above 70 for much of the year -- but
consequently, the share count only fell 0.7%.

In fiscal year 2001, as the stock fell dramatically, especially in the second
half of the year, Dell ramped up its share repurchases to $2.7 billion, equal
to 68% of free cash flow. Yet the diluted shares outstanding rose 1.9%.

The trend continued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002, as Dell spent 99%
of its free cash flow buying back shares, yet the share count rose 0.7%.

Stock Options
Wait a second! How could the share count be rising when Dell is spending so
much on share repurchases? Can you say stock options? Like many companies,
especially those in the technology industry, Dell issues a large and increasing
number of stock options to its management and employees.

Last year, as Dell's stock price fell, many options became worthless because
they were struck at much higher prices. This is demoralizing to employees and
no doubt made the company nervous about retaining its talent. So what did Dell
do? It more than tripled the number of options granted in fiscal year 2001 vs.
fiscal year 2000 from 50 million to 154 million. (This information is in the
fiscal year 2001 10-K under Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.) It's not surprising, therefore, that Dell's share count rose
despite the massive buybacks.

Reid at Dell notes the jump in stock options granted last year was due partly
to many new employees and also to a special double option grant. However,
unlike regular options, which begin vesting immediately, the extra options
don't begin vesting for two years (all options vest over five years). Reid said
the recently granted options are neither vested nor in the money, so the stock
price will have to rise over time for them to be worth anything, thereby
aligning Dell employees' incentives with those of shareholders.

By my calculations, had Dell wished to keep its share count steady in fiscal
year 2001, it would have had to buy back 52 million more shares (on top of the
65 million shares it purchased for $2.7 billion). Using this average price of
$41.54 per share, Dell would have had to spend an additional $2.2 billion, for
a total of $4.9 billion. Obviously, this was not feasible given that free cash
flow was only $4 billion.

Implications
Even though the cost doesn't appear on the income statement, stock options are
clearly a form of compensation, and there is a real cost associated with them.
Let's say a company spent 100% of its free cash flow buying back shares, yet
the share count remained constant. Isn't this just a compensation expense, and
therefore in this scenario the company generated no free cash flow for
shareholders?

At Dell, the situation was even more extreme last fiscal year: Had it spent
100% of its free cash flow on buybacks, the share count still would have risen
0.8%. Thus, one could argue that Dell had negative free cash flow for
shareholders last year.

To some extent, this analysis penalizes Dell for having a stock that's done
well over time (though obviously not in the past year or so). The dilution that
took place in fiscal 2001 was due mostly to stock options granted many years
ago, when the stock was at a much lower price. Had the stock done badly, then
many of the options would have expired worthless and the company also would
have been able to buy back more of its shares for the same amount, but
shareholders would, of course, be worse off today.

Papaya,

NAT has minimum contract payments from BP for their 3 tankers through 2004. I
don't think all VLCCF tankers are under minimum contracts through 2004, but
they could be. I have not looked at their SEC filings for 6 or so months. These
two companies send dividends based on their incomes. VLCCF and NAT dividends
have been variable but better than most investments. Last time I looked at the
SEC filings they are insured through Lloyds of London. So if one of the tankers
is taken out and the stock has no bids it is time to buy assuming Lloyds has
capital to pay for the tanker loss. <g> Guess I will have to go back and read
the latest SEC filings and see if things have changed.

NAT has a nice write up in their SEC filings on the organizations structure.
Each tanker is a separate corporation and the whole company can not be taken
down by the loss of one tanker. VLCCF could have the same structure but I could
not find the discussion in the filing I was reading.

Anyway I use these two for higher yield income than CD's and short term
treasuries.

Interesting post!

Dell spokesman T.R. Reid responded to my questions by noting the company is in
an industry in which stock options are the norm. "It is highly unlikely the
company could have achieved such high rates of growth over time, and resulting
shareholder value, without stock-based compensation as a tool for recruiting,
providing incentive to and retaining literally tens of thousands of employees,"
he said."

I hear this notion bandied about like it is an immutable law, but I think it is
merely convenient for managements (so they can mask the true expense of
compensation or pass it on to the shareholder), so it is unlikely to change
without extreme pressure.

"...Dell used 56% of its free cash flow over these 13 quarters to buy back its
own shares.... "

While your percentages may be true (I haven't cross-checked them) they hide the
important fact that this trend at DELL has accelerated each year for at least
the last three.

"At Dell, the situation was even more extreme last fiscal year: Had it spent
100% of its free cash flow on buybacks, the share count still would have risen
0.8%. Thus, one could argue that Dell had negative free cash flow for
shareholders last year."

This was what prompted my publishing of my analysis of their cash flow. One
would be hard pressed to find a more widely respected engine of profitable
business enterprise that exemplifies the blending of technology, internet and
sound business strategies than DELL, yet it is utterly amazing that the
shareholders don't benefit at all. NOT AT ALL!!!!

Reid at Dell notes the jump in stock options granted last year was due partly
to many new employees and also to a special double option grant. However,
unlike regular options, which begin vesting immediately, the extra options
don't begin vesting for two years (all options vest over five years). Reid said
the recently granted options are neither vested nor in the money, so the stock
price will have to rise over time for them to be worth anything, thereby
aligning Dell employees' incentives with those of shareholders.

Nice phrasing, but it doesn't work that way at DELL. What really happens is
that the stock option program aligns the employees' incentives with management
greed and both combine to screw the shareholder.

To some extent, this analysis penalizes Dell for having a stock that's done
well over time (though obviously not in the past year or so). The dilution that
took place in fiscal 2001 was due mostly to stock options granted many years
ago, when the stock was at a much lower price. Had the stock done badly, then
many of the options would have expired worthless and the company also would
have been able to buy back more of its shares for the same amount, but
shareholders would, of course, be worse off today. 

I don't follow your reasoning here. Whether the price does well or it doesn't
has no impact on the shareholder as far as the shareholder participating in the
profits of the company. The shareholder doesn't have any profits left over
after the stock incentives are paid off. The stock performance has been poor
the last two years and all that has accomplished was to bring more clearly into
focus the screwing the shareholder is getting with this company. With no
dividends and no participation in the profits of the company, the shareholder
is forced to ascribe to the "greater fool" theory and hope that the price rises
and he can sell out to a greater fool than himself.

As a shareholder in any company, I don't mind paying management and employees a
piece of the profits as a combination of a bonus for a job well done and an
incentive to keep up the good work. When the company is a publicly traded
entity, I don't think that the combined bonus/incentive package for management
and employees should exceed 20% of yearly profits. For the incentives to assume
more than that percentage is unconscionable, for them to approach or exceed
100% is criminal in my opinion. To me, this level violates the fiduciary
responsibility I believe all managements of publicly traded companies have with
their shareholders. DELL is my candidate as the poster child for this type of
fiduciary violation.

The reasoning is correct. If stock tanks, the options
expire worthless, there is no dilution and no need for
stock buyback. Also the buyback is cheaper unless locked in
by selling puts. So all cash flow is saved.
BUT! THERE IS A BUT! But this is only
true if the company does not grant more and more new
options as the stock tanks...

Of course your assessment is technically correct. However, I was responding to
the embedded assumption that the shareholder of DELL would benefit in any
scenario.

The price has declined, but to offset the "savings" of fewer option grants are
the massive Put obligations requiring the shares to be bought back at $45
regardless of how low the stock price goes. Either way, rising or falling stock
price, the shareholder gets the same result....NADA.

TimbaBear, I want to thank you for your superb expose of Dell and stock
options. I've never owned Dell but your discussion made me look at other stocks
that I actually own and I could see that one of them erred in the Dell
direction, (though not that bad), so I sold it. In a few days it sank much
lower. Thanks!

Hi Joan:

Its been a while since I've read NAT & VLCCF's SEC filings. While the companies
have many similarities a few main differences are:

1) The only NAT debt is when they issued debt to buy back shares (30M?). This
is paid off at the end of the 7 year lease. VLCCF actually has much more debt
incurred to acquire the tankers.

So @ the end of the day when the tankers have to be sold in NAT's case the
proceeds go to shareholders while the ULCCF's proceeds go to the lenders.

2) NAT lease after the 7 years is 1 yr annual renewals @ BP's option and I
think BP has to give either 6 or 12 months notice. ULCCF is a 7 yr lease with a
7 year renew.
I can't remember if the renew is automatic @ existing terms. I think (so I
really don't remember but its in the documents) NAT / BP is on same terms but
ULCCF has an increase for operating expenses with all things being equal the
dividend would decrease. Probably the same terms for NAT.

On the insurance at least for NAT BP insurers (has to be with Lloyds) the
tankers with pretty good guarantees to NAT so the shareholders are protected
for the CURRENT fair market value of the tankers in case of loss.

Could be, although I've noticed times when a company buying a full page ad in
the WSJ tends to eliminate the more critical articles or even result in a more
favorable article as a follow up to one of the mud rakers. Maybe what Wall

I'm glad that the DELL analysis served as a help for you. That is the best
compliment I think I could have gotten! I have always liked this board because
of the sharing of ideas and analyses and strategies. I have gained far more
than I have given.

Incidentally if you want to buy an insurance company, can you do better than
Berkshire Hathaway?

While I cannot argue that Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger provide a good
influence for the managers of the insurance components of Berkshire Hathaway, I
still haven't found a way to quantify risk exposure.

Good management is definitely an important factor in the investment
decision-making process, however, it is not a sufficient one for me. If I don't
have confidence in the fundamentals of a company, then how will I know how to
proceed if I discover (usually well after the fact) that Mr. Buffet has
lightened up his holdings in this or that company?

Buffet on options, pensions: [I missed this when it initially ran since it was

Who Really Cooks the Books?
Commentary by Warren E. Buffett for The New York Times

There is a crisis of confidence today about corporate earnings reports and the
credibility of chief executives. And it's justified.

For many years, I've had LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN THE EARNINGS NUMBERS REPORTED BY
MOST CORPORATIONS. I'm not talking about Enron and WorldCom — examples of
outright crookedness. Rather, I am referring to the legal, but improper,
accounting methods used by chief executives to inflate reported earnings.

The most flagrant deceptions have occurred in stock-option accounting and in
assumptions about pension-fund returns. The aggregate misrepresentation in
these two areas dwarfs the lies of Enron and WorldCom.

In calculating the pension costs that directly affect their earnings, companies
in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks are today using assumptions about
investment return rates that go as high as 11 percent. The rate chosen is
important: in many cases, an upward change of a single percentage point will
increase the annual earnings a company reports by more than $100 million. It's
no surprise, therefore, that many chief executives opt for assumptions that are
wildly optimistic, even as their pension assets perform miserably. These
C.E.O.'s simply ignore this unpleasant reality and their obliging actuaries and
auditors bless whatever rate the company selects. How convenient: Client A,
using a 6.5 percent rate, receives a clean audit opinion — and so does client
B, which opts for an 11 percent rate.

All that is bad, but the far greater sin has been option accounting. Options
are a huge cost for many corporations and a huge benefit to executives. No
wonder, then, that they have fought ferociously to avoid making a charge
against their earnings. Without blushing, almost all C.E.O.'s have told their
shareholders that options are cost-free.

For these C.E.O.'s I have a proposition: Berkshire Hathaway will sell you
insurance, carpeting or any of our other products in exchange for options
identical to those you grant yourselves. It'll all be cash-free. But do you
really think your corporation will not have incurred a cost when you hand over
the options in exchange for the carpeting? Or do you really think that placing
a value on the option is just too difficult to do, one of your other excuses
for not expensing them? If these are the opinions you honestly hold, call me
collect. We can do business.

Chief executives frequently claim that options have no cost because their
issuance is cashless. But when they do so, they ignore the fact that many
C.E.O.'s regularly include pension income in their earnings, though this item
doesn't deliver a dime to their companies. They also ignore another reality:
When corporations grant restricted stock to their executives these grants are
routinely, and properly, expensed, even though no cash changes hands.

When a company gives something of value to its employees in return for their
services, it is clearly a compensation expense. And if expenses don't belong in
the earnings statement, where in the world do they belong?

To clean up their act on these fronts, C.E.O.'s don't need "independent"
directors, oversight committees or auditors absolutely free of conflicts of
interest. They simply need to do what's right. As Alan Greenspan forcefully
declared last week, the attitudes and actions of C.E.O.'s are what determine
corporate conduct.

Indeed, actions by Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission have the
potential of creating a smoke screen that will prevent real accounting reform.
The Senate itself is the major reason corporations have been able to duck
option expensing. On May 3, 1994, the Senate, led by Senator Joseph Lieberman,
pushed the Financial Accounting Standards Board and Arthur Levitt, then
chairman of the S.E.C., into backing down from mandating that options be
expensed. Mr. Levitt has said that he regrets this retreat more than any other
move he made during his tenure as chairman. Unfortunately, current S.E.C.
leadership seems uninterested in correcting this matter.

I don't believe in Congress setting accounting rules. But the Senate opened the
floodgates in 1994 to an anything-goes reporting system, and it should close
them now. Rather than holding hearings and fulminating, why doesn't the Senate
just free the standards board by rescinding its 1994 action?

C.E.O.'s want to be respected and believed. They will be — and should be — only
when they deserve to be. They should quit talking about some bad apples and
reflect instead on their own behavior.

Recently, a few C.E.O.'s have stepped forward to adopt honest accounting. But
most continue to spend their shareholders' money, directly or through trade
associations, to lobby against real reform. They talk principle, but, for most,
their motive is pocketbook.

For their shareholders' interest, and for the country's, C.E.O.'s should tell
their accounting departments today to quit recording illusory pension-fund
income and start recording all compensation costs. They don't need studies or
new rules to do that. They just need to act.

Warren E. Buffett is the chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a
diversified holding company.

Timba, excellent work on Dell. Eye opening stuff that made me go looking for
similar stuff in other co's.

Was checking out Intel on Marketguide... over the last 5 fiscal years, Intel
has spent $17.8 Billion on share repurchases and yet the shares outstanding has
remained roughly constant (actually they increased from 6.5 to 6.7 billion
shrs). There are no notes in the most recent Intel report to rival Dell's
candid admission of options-related dilution management and I suspect that one
would find that some of this is acquisition related dilution management, but,
in the end, it seems to be an all-the-same kind of thing. Are there any other
reasons why this type of expenditure should occur w/o the reduction in shares
out?

From a general perspective, it seems true to say that if a company is spending
cash on share repurchases but the number of shares out is not declining, then
the repurchase expenditure is not in the shareholder's interest. Your comments
are saying that from an analysis perspective, all cash spent on repurchases
should be subtracted from FCF b/c it clearly reduces cash. Then the repurchase
benefit for companies that are actually decreasing the number of shares out
will show when FCF is converted into value/shr. Whether or not the repurchase
expenditure should reduce reported earnings is a matter of the why's of the
dilution management, yes? Options dilution management is clearly compensation,
so it indicates inflated earnings (e.g. Dell). Something like acquisition
dilution management (i.e. you paid with shares but bought back to prevent
dilution) is not part of COGS and so would not have affected net income.

competitive advantage of in-house lending is further enhanced by withdrawal of
lender their competitors depend on. Wanna buy a MOB...want financing...gotta go

A net-net play: Valueclick (VCLK)

This company has $3 per share in cash. Today's closing share price was $2.53
per share. The company has $33M of their $276M in cash earmarked for buying
back shares.

VCLK's conference call was yesterday. I highly recommend taking a listen.
You'll hear that they stopped their buyback 2 weeks ago due to blackout.
They'll be resuming in a couple days. Their average price in the buyback (so
far) has been around $2.65 per share.

Operationally, the company has recently acquired two subsidiaries -- Mediaplex
and Be Free. Each was acquired for about the cash in the bank. That is, VCLK
bought the businesses themselves for nothing.

VCLK has done a good job integrating these companies and trimming costs. VCLK
is just about breaking even right now, which is impressive considering (1)
they're operating in the depressed online advertising space, (2) their cash is
generating almost no income due to low money market rates, and (3) they've been
busy integrating acquisitions.

In short, buy buying VCLK stock at these levels, you're getting the business
for nothing. You've got a price cushion due to the buyback's resumption in a
couple days. Finally, I've worked with the company's management, and in my
qualitative judgment you have an honest team of people truly focused on
shareholder value.

If you'd like to discuss VCLK further, drop a message here or message me on
Yahoo Messenger. My username is "mikeslemmer".

You ask a lot of good questions.

"...over the last 5 fiscal years, Intel has spent $17.8 Billion on share
repurchases and yet the shares outstanding has remained roughly constant

of this is acquisition related dilution management, but, in the end, it seems
to be an all-the-same kind of thing. Are there any other reasons why this type
of expenditure should occur w/o the reduction in shares out?"

I haven't looked at INTC for quite some time, but I think I'll have to in the
near future. My computer is down and I'm using someone else's to post. I expect
to have my computer in the next day or two and then I have some catch-up to do
with it as I have to re-install all my software and copy my files. So I can't
say for sure whether I'll have the analysis done this week-end or not.

If a company issued no stock options, but issued shares for acquisitions, then
they might have a similar number of shares after a massive share repurchase
program. I would look at notes to the financial statements as there usually is
contained therein a listing of the options granted and those exercised. Taking
the total spent on share buy-backs from the Statement of Cash Flows and the
number of shares from the notes, I could determine the average cost/share
during the buy-back. Knowing the number of options exercised, I could then
multiply that number by the average cost per share to determine how much was
spent to prevent dilution due to options.

From a general perspective, it seems true to say that if a company is spending
cash on share repurchases but the number of shares out is not declining, then
the repurchase expenditure is not in the shareholder's interest

I don't think I'd view it that way. I'd rather say that the shareholder's are
able to benefit by seeing the true cost of options and therefore add it to the
labor costs (or subtract it from cash flow). Additionally, it isn't the
repurchase that is not in the shareholder's interest, it is the options
granting process if it appears that it costs more than 20% of the net
profits/free cash flow.

Your comments are saying that from an analysis perspective, all cash spent on
repurchases should be subtracted from FCF b/c it clearly reduces cash.

No, that is not my position. Only that money spent on share buy-backs that are
to prevent dilution from stock options exercise is to be subtracted from FCF.
In and of themselves, share buy-backs are an optional use of free cash and
should be added back into cash flow (using my bottom up methodology) when they
serve as an investment of the company's cash. In this case, the company could
have (theoretically) just as easily have employed the same amount of cash in
CAPEX, debt reduction, or dividends, but chose share repurchasing as the best
use of the money at that time. Far different thinking than preventing dilution
due to stock options.

Whether or not the repurchase expenditure should reduce reported earnings is a
matter of the why's of the dilution management, yes? 

Yes

Options dilution management is clearly compensation, so it indicates inflated
earnings (e.g. Dell).

Correct. But the way DELL did it, it also appeared to increase FCF by the
short-cut formula that is most-widely used (CFO - CAPEX = FCF). The way they
did it, it appears to be full disclosure with no impact to earnings or cash
flow. A real trust-buster for me.

Something like acquisition dilution management (i.e. you paid with shares but
bought back to prevent dilution) is not part of COGS and so would not have
affected net income.

The broader picture here is much more complicated than this. Including a host
of issues like goodwill, depreciation, CAPEX, acquired R&D that is written off,
etc. etc. Also an accountant might have an issue with much of that going to the
item "COGS". I think you meant somewhere that affected net income.

In a narrower perspective, I think I would view the issue of share repurchase
as an alternative use of FCF in all cases except those that I can clearly see
that the real purpose was to mask a business expense (like options).
