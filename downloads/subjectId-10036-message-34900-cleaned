I'll throw out BDR as another microcap value possibility.

Stock is selling well below book (near net assets) with a PE of 10 or so.
Management seems to have turned company around for the moment.

The CEO personally went bankrupt last year and there is a huge potential
overhang of his shares in a bankruptcy trust. I think this could be keeping a
lid on the stock. If the company addresses this and/or the stock get liquidated
in the market, I would think the stock would rally significantly on its
improving fundamentals.

Risks are a reversal of recent earnings trend and/or a slow steady drip out of
CEO stock.

MC

PS: I'm not getting much feedback recently on these microcap ideas. If anyone
actually gets anything out of these ideas lett me know (public or private),
otherwise I'll just save the time and space and keep them to myself.

Please continue posting picks, microcaps or not, EKS. They are very important
to the success of the thread.

I'm not too interested in microcaps currently unless I can easily see why the
particular stock stands out as a buy. I don't see that with BDR, why it might
be better than so many other value propositions. (Some of these dink Chinese
stocks are under stated book value, profitable (it seems), with p/e's under 4.
That's the competition for my microcap funds.)
So if I don't see a ruling reason for digging deeper into BDR after a cursory
glance, I'll just pass. That's just me though - the thing could be a very good
purchase idea for others who'll research and understand the stock better.

I'm keeping my OGE shares. I like it for Enogex. "Enogex’s transportation and
storage business owns and operates approximately 2,433 miles of intrastate
natural gas transportation pipelines." I'm interested in the various nat gas
shale plays, and the Woodford is one: "Enogex delivers natural gas to most
interstate and intrastate pipelines and end-users connected to its systems from
the Arkoma and Anadarko basins (including recent growth activity in the Granite
Wash play in western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle and the Woodford Shale
play in southeastern Oklahoma)."

GLW's moved up, and I have been considering exiting too. However, I note this
comment from a customer which looks bullish to me for the outlook for GLW, so I
guess I will continue holding on:

"LG Display (034220.KS), the world's No. 2 maker of liquid crystal display
(LCD) panels, reported forecast-beating earnings on Thursday helped by robust
demand for flat-screen TVs and higher panel prices on tight raw material
supplies.
'There will be an oversupply of some extent between from December through
February,' chief executive Kwon Young-soo told reporters at a news conference.
But I doesn't (sic) appear too worrisome. Even if we face oversupply, I expect
makers to choose to reduce output rather than going into a price war.'

He added the shortage of glass used in screens was severe and could change the
outlook. Glass suppliers such as Corning Inc (GLW.N) have been slow to raise
output after last year's slump in the LCD sector, keeping a lid on capacity
growth."

RE: OGE Rate hike approved today

Okla. utility regulators agree to $48M rate hike Oklahoma utility regulators
give tentative approval to $48 million rate hike for OG&E

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Okla-utility-regulators-agree-apf-1027681597.html
x=0&.v=2

It's a lot less than their original request. From the article:"...OG&E
originally requested a rate hike of a little more than $110 million in
February..."

I do like the individual components of the company but with such a small rate
increase, I think future growth is limited (at least until the local Oklahoma
economy picks up). Perhaps the non regulated segments of their business will
continue to grow and move the stock much higher.

The stocks all time high isjust above $40 in December 2006 and has a 50 week MA
around $32.00. The upside is perhaps 9%-28%. The dividend is ok at 4.9% PE with
a 11.5 PE. I am a buyer of the stock if it falls back between $28-$29.

I guess the value proposition is if their non regulated subsidiaries can grow
more than 11% and move the overall company PE higher (how about above 14 PE).
The analysts target next year's PE at 12 with the company earning $2.83.

===============================================================

I like Black Hills Corp. (BKH) with their non regulated Coal & Nat Gas
subsidiaries. It still is not a compelling buy at current levels but the
company has shown they can surprise on earnings to the upside. PE is now
tracking around 12.

They recently got a new rate increase approved for their IOWA natural gas
operation
Black Hills Energy Receives Approval From Iowa Utilities Board to Implement New
Natural Gas Service Rates
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Black-Hills-Energy-Receives-prnews-1207923910.htm
?x=0&.v=2
From the article"...The new rates represent approximately $10.4 million, or 5.8
percent, in additional annual revenues for the company's Iowa natural gas
operations. The increase is based on a return on equity of 10.1 percent with a
capital structure of 51.4 percent equity and 48.6 percent debt. The rate design
provides for 56.4 percent of costs to be recovered through the fixed monthly
customer charge, up from 48 percent before the rate case, with the remainder
recovered through a variable charge on the natural gas used by customers....".

The Utility Board was pretty generous with their ROE and recovery of direct
costs.

At current prices their dividend still yields 6%. I am apt to buy more of BKH
on any sell off to $21-$22. My initial buys were in May 2009 around $20.00. The
stock has seen $40 in the past 52 weeks almost a double from current prices.

I am sure there are many other of these "hybrid" utilities that have businesses
as natural gas consolidators, pipeline distribution, coal mining, and various
Nat Gas shale plays. It's worth looking at their component subsidiaries
especially their non regulated businesses. I have owned some of these where new
stock was spun off for their non regulated businesses which ultimately have
outperformed the parent company's common stock many times over.

re FR
Where is your valuation for FR squarefootage coming from? Citigroup REIT report
seems to indicate that FR stock trades at a premium to NAV. Since FR stock is
only ma miniscule slice of the EV that does not seem to imply a huge margin of
safety for FR-XX preferred since they come next in the capital structure. I
agree that short term maturities are doable (assuming no nasty surprises from
the joint ventures) but I do no think that FR preferred a low risk by any
means.

Hi Spekulatius - It was a simple back of the envelope calculation and just
another way to view total debt coverage under a worse case fireside sale
scenario.

I took the Total Gross Leasable Area (Square Feet) 70,780,259 (as of March
2009). Then I calculated the price per square foot to cover all their
outstanding debt including their preferred series (around $2.7B). It comes out
to be around $38.00/sq foot.

(The information comes from First Industrial Realty supplemental report dated
March 11, 2009 - See page 14.
http://www.firstindustrial.com/_files/ir/supplemental/0309supp.pdf )

My observation was that based on their most recent sale of non leased
industrial space in AZ, the market cash price was $55.00/sq foot. Remember that
85% of their industrial space is already leased and generating excellent cash
flow. This space (about 57M sq.ft) would generate a much higher price than
$55/sq foot.

If there was a foreclosure fire sale at a net price of $38.00/sq foot (for both
leased and non leased space), the net proceeds would cover all of their
outstanding debt obligations. This includes the preferred series which would be
paid off at their par value of $25.00/share. Common shares would be worthless.

As long as the market price $/sq ft did not tank more than 44%, the risk/reward
was acceptable especially with a yield on the discounted preferred stock
approaching 17.5%. <u> Furthermore with a liquidation, the preferred series
gets paid off at $25.00/share (a premium of 138% from the current price of
$10.50!).</u>

To me the issue is not a question of asset valuation but more of cash flow
which appears they have covered w/o a problem through 2011.

It seems like a compelling value buy to me. If they took on more long term debt
which was superior to the preferred or the GAV significantly decreased, then
it's not worth the risk.

EKS

P.S. Citigroup's analysis page -5- shows FR's Debt/GAV at 83%. I guess this
implies that they have all the outstanding debt covered based on Citigroup's
most recent estimate for GAV (Gross Asset Value).

E_K_S - i like the valuation approach but i do not think that based on data
from a singe sale, the average value of huge industrial portfolio can be
deducted.

I took another stab based on a recent mortgage financing:

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/921825/000095012309011149/c51730exv99w1.
tm

1) 2.6 msqft mortgaged for 71M$= 27$/sqft
2) 3.1 msqft mortgaged for 62.5M$=20.2$/sqft.

Now the big question is the hypothetical capital structure of the deal. if we
assume that 30% equity /70% debt than
1) Batch one is worth 27/0.7 =38.6$
2) batch two is worth 20.2/0.7=28.8$/sqft

Of course we do not know if the 30%/70% assumption is correct, but still those
values are lower than the 38$. So know we have 3 datapoints: 55$/sqft, 38$/sqft
and 29$/sqft.Take your pick. Fun business to do this back on the envelope stuff
- or maybe I should say funny business <g>.

Chinese microcaps,

Hi Paul, I should probably be looking at these more closely, but I don't trust

paying a dividend? If they are actually returning money to shareholders (or
provide some other indication they are on the up and up), I think they are good

I bought some on the open, ty. I have been transitioning my portfolio into

After living through last year and not optimistic on a big run from here, I

nothing, so not inclined to sit on a hoard of cash.

Maybe I should take a longer view and hold more cash in order to take advantage

Settlement of Preferred Shares of Mass Financial and its Former Subsidiary

Our investment in the preferred shares of Mass Financial and one of its former
subsidiaries is a legacy asset and was recorded at its estimated fair value of
Cdn$23.4 million as at both March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. In our annual
report on Form 20-F, we announced that as part of the continued realignment of
our business to focus on the expansion of our industrial plant engineering and
equipment supply business, we had entered into negotiations with Mass Financial
in an effort to come to an agreement regarding the immediate realization of the
economic value of the preferred shares of Mass Financial and one of its former
subsidiaries by way of redemption of these shares. For more information, please
see “Item 5 — Operating Results — Fair Value Loss on Preferred Shares of Mass
Financial and its Former Subsidiary” in our annual report on Form 20-F.

On May 12, 2009, we entered into and completed an agreement with Mass Financial
for the redemption of the non-transferable preferred shares of Mass Financial
and its former subsidiary for net consideration of Cdn$12.284 million, which
represented the gross redemption amount of the preferred shares of Cdn$49.284
million offset by the indebtedness of Cdn$37.0 million owed to Mass Financial.
The payment of the Cdn$12.284 million was payable as follows:

(a) Cdn$8.28 million being satisfied by Mass Financial agreeing to transfer
788,201 of our common shares to our company;

(b) Cdn$1.71 million being satisfied by way of cash payment by Mass Financial
to our company;

(c) Cdn$1.75 million being satisfied by way of issuance to our company of an
assignable promissory note having a principal amount of Cdn$1.75 million, a
term of 24 months and an interest rate of 4% per annum payable annually in
cash. The note is repayable at the option of the issuer by the issuance of
common shares of Mass Financial based on the number of common shares of Mass
Financial equalling the amount being repaid divided by the 30-day volume
weighted average trading price for the Mass Financial common shares. The
promissory note can be repaid or be redeemed at any time in cash at the option
of the issuer; and

(d) Cdn$539,697 being satisfied by setting-off of accrued and unpaid interest
on our indebtedness to Mass Financial pursuant to a loan agreement with Mass
Financial dated January 31, 2006.

15

Table of Contents

Mass Financial also agreed to settle Cdn$11.346 million owing to us in respect
of the accrued dividends on the preferred shares, which will be payable by way
of the issuance of a promissory note having a principal amount of Cdn$11.346
million, a term of 24 months and an interest rate of 4% per annum payable
annually in cash. The note is repayable at the option of the issuer by the
issuance of common shares of Mass Financial based on the number of common
shares of Mass Financial equalling the amount being repaid divided by the
30-day volume weighted average trading price for the Mass Financial common
shares. The promissory note can be repaid or be redeemed at any time in cash at
the option of the issuer.

The settlement of the preferred shares was approved by our independent
directors, as recommended by our audit committee, which took into account a
variety of factors prior to granting such approval, including material tax
consequences, the importance of maximizing cash holdings given the current
economic situation, the ability to reduce the number of our outstanding common
shares, the impact of the transaction on creditors, lenders, customers,
shareholders and other interested parties, the fact that the preferred shares
were not core assets and the current economic value of the preferred shares.
The directors and the audit committee also engaged and considered the advice of
an independent financial advisor and outside independent legal counsel. The
directors and the audit committee also considered the advantages, disadvantages
and risks of proceeding with the transaction and concluded that proceeding with
the transaction was in the best interests of our company and its shareholders.
This transaction substantially completes the disposition of our financial
services operations which commenced in 2005 and enables KHD and Mass Financial
to focus on their respective core businesses.

As a result of the settlement of the preferred shares of Mass Financial and one
of its former subsidiaries, we will recognize a loss of approximately Cdn$11.1
million in the second quarter of 2009.

I've also been looking at the defense sector and agree with you that it is hard
for the individual investor to determine the winners and losers.

That said, I believe that the defense industry is at an inflection point where
dollars will be reallocated. A recent article in Foreign Affairs highlights the
challenges the US is facing in crafting a defense policy for future threatening
situations. It is well worth reading.

http://www.csbaonline.org/4Publications/PubLibrary/O.20090630.Pentagons_Wasting
/O.20090630.Pentagons_Wasting_.pdf

I think the following document and article also sheds light on the direction of
defense funding.

One company that I have taken a position in is KTOS. In its previous
incarnation the company focused on building wireless infrastructure. But in the
last two years it has sold off those assets and focused on defense. It's more
of a turnaround than a value stock. In fact, with the impairment charges one
can argue that the stock has little value. For that reason it trades at below a
dollar. Nevertheless the company is cash flow positive. I believe it is
positioned in several areas that will benefit from future defense expenditures

operation earnings are OK (+10%/per share) and dividend is increased.

Hi Jurgis - I picked up a few shares of NOK to add to my current position. I
noticed that back in May 2009 this was one of your top five positions. My last
sale on NOK was 10/2007 at $38.00/share, so I feel lucky that I can add back to
the position at $13.15 in July 2009.

My last buy on NOK was on 2/27/2003 at around the current levels $12.70/share
so to me this seems like a good entry point. The company does pay a decent
dividend at 3.9% for a tech stock. The company is a good low cost manufacturer
and should be able to supply China with millions of inexpensive phones. They
slipped a bit on their high end "smart phones" with market loss to Apple but
this market is growing and NOK should continue to be a major player. Forward PE
is low at 12 and when compared to Apple's PE of 25 you are able to buy NOK at
1/2 the price.

Gross margins for NOK have always been good especially at the low end. Recently
margins have shrunk across all of their product lines. Their last earnings
report was bad which is why shares are priced so low.

NOK has made it into my top 15 and is one I might add more to since I am light
on Tech stocks.

MOT surprised with their earnings as the market expected a loss. Stock up more
than 9%. I own a small position but it is much more speculative. NOK is my
first pick due to it's current low valuation and potential to grow their
earnings.
=============================================================

I peeled off a few shares of GLW which is a top 10 holding where I have a
substantial gain. Most of my shares were bought in 2002 in the $5-$6 range. I
sold a few shares in 10/2007 at $27.00 but held my large position as the growth
prospects continued to look good.

The company has four major operating divisions: Display Technologies,
Telecommunications, Environmental Technologies, and Life Sciences. Most people
are only aware of their big two: (1) Telecommunications (fibre optics) and (2)
Display (LCDs). The LCD Glass has always done well but I was very positive on
their Environmental division especially with their new catalytic ceramic diesel
filter insert. It was doing really good in Eurpoe and they were ready to ramp
up production in the U.S.. The company saw lots of growth in Europe and U.S.
especially with new U.S. EPA diesel regulations.

From my earlier post on GLW 07/20/2008
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=24806649&srchtxt=ceramic

The little filter that could
http://www.mpnnow.com/archive/x1743991648/The-little-filter-that-could

From the article:"...Between the Jetta’s diesel-engine exhaust and the outside
world sits the DuraTrapAT diesel filter, Corning’s aluminum titanate CERAMIC
catalyst created for diesel VWs. Hundreds of thousands of VW’s with the Corning
DuraTrapAT are already on the road in Europe and elsewhere. They arrive on the
U.S. market in September.

Corning Inc.’s filter removes 99% of a diesel’s excess carbon soot from the
exhaust, making Jetta emissions cleaner than some gasoline vehicles.

Corning’s CERAMIC diesel exhaust filters may not seem very high-tech, but it
generates great black ink on company balance sheets. Net diesel product sales,
including heavy truck diesel filters, rose to $249 million in 2007 from $164
million in 2006...."

I was surprised to read this story early this week that the company is not
seeing the growth expected for this business segment.

Technologies Segment

With a forward PE of 12 and a consistent 1.2% dividend the stock is still in
bargain territory. I continue to peel off a few shares now as I think I can
purchase them at current or lower prices six months from now. I have put the
proceeds into NOK which on balance should perform better in the next 12 months
than GLW. I own both companies.

FMC's numbers look okay to me. Nothing spectacular in the ratios that I often
use for buy determinations. I suspect FMC is trading at its low p/e range if
earnings hold up. I like FMC for its lithium exposure, for its ag chemicals,

E_K_S,

NOK is a hold position for me. I will not add, but I won't sell either. It has
a potential to come back, although it is not clear what exact catalyst would
be. NOK came back from last drop by capturing a huge percentage of emerging
markets. This is impossible to repeat, so they will have to find something new.

I still hold my full position of GLW and don't plan to sell here. Not a buy, a
hold too.

Overall, few very cheap opportunities. Market is not overpriced, but getting
closer to being fairly priced. I did very well on preferreds, but now I have
either to take the prices close to par or to be satisfied with under-10%
yields. Neither is very exciting. I am considering establishing significant TIP

JST, et. al. Yes, I'm still holding some JST shares purchased in '03 and most
recently Jan and Mar '09. Traded some shares in '08. This year has been
set-and-forget for me with JST. My error: if I knew what I was doing and what I
had with JST after all these years of following it and had any confidence, I
shoulda/coulda added much more esp. as stock advanced this year. But I didn't
and didn't.

Over the past few years JST has moved from being a great net-net to moving to
value stock to now, a gaarp stock, if not still a value stock. I'm positive on
the company, afraid to commit to more shares at current price though, since
I've already been late. And this thing can be volatile, as a five year chart
shows.

I'm still holding ABB. I like JST better only because it's an easier company
for me to understand/follow than ABB. (ABB being so much larger and more
diversified. And also ABB more of a checkered past - just a few years ago
flirting with bankruptcy.)

For the electrical grid buildout and as an adjunct to utility stocks and ag
stocks both of which I've been favoring, I'm a buyer now (today) of an initial
few shares of Valmont http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=VMI (<span

http://www.valmont.com/page.aspx?id=3

From the 7/21 quarterly p.r. I see that sales and earnings have held up in a
general market where many (most?) other companies' sales are down. Co. ceo is
upbeat on the company's future, and it seems to me too that VMI could do and
might do well in future.

Mr. Bay, Valmont's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said about 2009
outlook,

"Our outlook for 2009 has improved," Mr. Bay said. "Although we expect sales
comparisons to be lower in the second half of the year, we now expect net
earnings for the year to be modestly higher than 2008's record earnings.

"Our sales outlook in the second half of the year is based on several factors.
Current raw material costs are down from last year, which could impact
comparisons in some businesses. In the North American utility market, we expect
the sales gain in the second half to moderate as a number of large orders have
shipped. In the Engineered Support Structures Segment, while we do not expect
major changes in market conditions, we have recently seen an improvement in our
export markets from Europe and China; as a result second half sales could show
positive comparisons. For the North American business, an important long-term
driver would be an extension or renewal of the U.S. Federal Highway bill. In
the Coatings Segment, we expect sales declines, reflecting weakness in the
industrial economy and lower zinc prices. In the Irrigation Segment, third
quarter comparisons will be substantially unfavorable compared to last year's
record third quarter results. Fourth quarter results will be determined by the
conditions in the agricultural sector following the fall harvest in North
America and the resultant outlook for farm income.

"We have leadership positions in very attractive markets. When economic
conditions improve, we should be well positioned to participate in global
infrastructure and agriculture growth. Our industry, product lines and
geographic diversification have allowed us to deliver record earnings during
the current global economic recession. We will continue to be prudent in our
management of capital and maintain a conservative financial profile."

Although VMI's p/e is somewhat lower than its avg. p/e over the past few years
and I am looking at a steadily increasing bv over the past decade, I don't see
ratio numbers low enough to where I can say VMI is a value stock: It's a gaarp
stock to me. Prospects seem good, price seems right; I am a buyer of the stock.
(A few shares at current price)

Now as I consider JST again after your post and in the context of all this,
maybe I will try some speculative swing trading in JST with a new small dollar
commitment.

Over five years, they track:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ta?s=HON&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&p=&a=&c=utx

I like neither as regards their aerospace stuff:

HON: 35% of revenue, 46% of operating profits
UTX: Pratt&Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand: 33% of rev, 40% of operating
profits. Adding in Sikorsky gives another 9% and 6%.

(I've already got an appetite full of aerospace (e.g. GR, COL, PCP))

I like UTX for Otis. A razor and razor-blade business, it has been said.

Div. yield %, 2.60% vs. 3.9%, HON wins. Not sure it's significant in making the
buy decision. Haven't looked at rate/freq of increases. Also of course depends
on how long somebody would be holding the stocks.

Given what I already have with aerospace, I'm sticking with UTX. Pass on HON.

I'm taking the bearish side of the natural gas view, Madharry. We're (USA)
loaded with the stuff. This horizontal drilling thing has enabled going from
shortage to excess (imo).

A lot of producers seem to me to be showing profits because they're hedged
through 2010 and to lesser extent in subsequent couple years at prices that
were favorable for nat gas in 2008. Those hedges come off though, and imo,
prices will be at marginal cost of production with so many producers and so
much available to be produced.

This opinion is coupled with my broad exposure (over commitment) to oil/gas
stocks and my weariness (and wariness) in holding on to losing positions even
though the stocks have rallied somewhat. Many that I own are still down more
than 50% from my buys in past years -- a few e&p's down more than 80%.

From what I can posit, this would be the analogy that I'd use:

There's the Nat Gas train. It's moving down the tracks quite nicely; hard to
tell if it's at constant speed or accelerating though. Nevertheless, by using
charting techniques, its performance is okay, if not good, you might be saying.
Stepping back a little (i.e. the apparent macro view) there's a problem down
the line that I believe I see. Not sure exactly where (i.e. 2009, 2010, 2011
--when the hedges come off), but that problem is a bandwagon of nat gas trains
that look like they are converging. The Eastern USA states are loaded with
shale plays. And of course the usual suspects OK, TX, ND, Canada. There's even
talk now of California nat gas fields to be developed from fracking technology.

Maybe a lot of the potential won't be developed. There's the environmental
concern (e.g. the new drilling techniques do or don't cause earthquakes), gov't
regs and taxes, plus there's nimby.

We make our bets from what we believe we see and within our risk tolerances.
For me, I'm reducing my natural gas stocks on the presumption that gas will be
extracted, but low gas prices from so many nat gas companies and their fields
will make these companies poor investments. For me, my new monies into the
sector will go to the companies that supply the infrastructure to get the gas
to consumers.

Congrats on GGC.

"The moral is that once the reverse split was completed and I noticed the super
high trading activity on Friday, I should have know that the equity was
significantly undervalued based on the book value of their tangible assets.
That's a six bagger in less than 20 trading hours!."

I don't see how anyone, any outsider anyway, could determine undervaluation
based on book value of tangible assets. Because even with a debt-for-stock and
reverse split, the book value numbers are not well reported or easily
calculated (it seems to me):

http://si.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&cb=1249431635&symbol=NY ^GGC

I does seem though that the "super high trading activity" was a clue that the

EKS,

These kind of opportunities are great, but tough to grab. I don't know anything
about GGC except what you told. However, I would try to distill some lessons
from what you wrote:

- Buying a company stock that has problems making debt payments and may go BK
is a gamble. Yes, it may work out, but it may not. June 30 results list huge
shareholder deficit:
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Georgia-Gulf-Reports-Second-bw-713405935.html?x=0
.v=1 , which may have led it to BK. Even if it looks cheap, it can go almost to
the zero (If I calculate correctly, your purchase price was at $3
pre-reverse-split = $75 after split! - so stock has fallen nearly 90% from your
initial really cheap price?).

- Buying a company AFTER it settles issues with bond holders, can be extremely
satisfying, but the buy window can be really short. Here is where the
"pre-settling" speculative position helps, since one follows the events as they
happen compared to someone who does not have a position. Analysis of post-event
equity structure still is needed to figure out what is "cheap" and what is not.

- Market mood is very important too, sadly to say. If the reverse split and
recapitalization had happened in March, I am sure the stock would not have 6
bagged...

Take care.

SAFT seems to be continuing to chug along ok. I like a company that is below
book, pays a dividend, and buys back stock. That's what I call doing the right
thing. I'm in for a little more. Will continue to be on guard for deterioration
in their auto business.

BDR is up 40% from my recommendation. Reminds me of the quote don't confuse
brains with a bull market.

Steve Felix: I'll go for a few shares of utility stock PPL also now. Stock down
enough for me on co's lowered expectations for 2010.

...And join you guys too who are buyers now of MCD. Upping my few shares a bit
here.

MCD is a good play on a dollar recovery. It won't do so well if the USD
continues to drop.

With a weaker dollar, why wouldn't MCD's European sales and euro profits be
that much stronger to MCD's bottom line ("if USD continues to drop")?

PPL.. currently S+P sees $3.35 in 2010. At a pe under 10 on the low end company
guidance, seems like a good place to park a few bucks.

From PPL conference call:

"Thus we are reaffirming our 2009 forecast of $1.60 to a $1.90 per share in
earnings from ongoing operations.

Now turning to 2010. We continue to anticipate very strong earnings next year.
However, market conditions and volatility surrounding customer demand levels
are putting significant downward pressure on the 2010 earnings. Driven by our
current expectations of lower margins and marketing and trading and the
continued decline in 2010 wholesale electricity prices, we’ve reduced our 2010
earnings forecast range to $3.10 to $3.50 per share."
