Autos: F could be bought here. As for me, I'll add to my Ford shares if stock
drops 10% on no adverse news. My preference and largest position among auto
manufacturers I hold is Volkswagen (VLKAY.pk). I hold Hyundai, bought through
EWY.

I am only buying Toyota (TM) now as stock continues to fall. I have to assume
weather problems are/were temporary. Perhaps the more lingering problem is the
expensive yen which decimates TM's exports (TM profits). Eventually - as they
have done since WW2, Japanese government will intervene to juggle the monetary
system and/or change internal laws to aid Japanese manufacturers.

I'm figuring maybe a three year holding period for me for these stocks.

Several conflicting aspects:
1. All manufacturers rushing together into China. China economy slowing, and
possible glut of middle/upper-class cars that bring in the good profits for the
manufacturers. Also China demanding technology/joint ventures from the
manufacturers if they want to continue in China.

2. Aging fleet of US cars. As stated, people keeping cars longer (reported to
be 50K more miles longer on average). Replacement is inevitable though.
Inevitable (?) that in few years, more new cars will be sold than now. (And if
demand for used-cars remains strong, auto retailers -- Penske (PAG), et al. -
should do very well.)

I can't make a compelling case that any of these stocks are value buys just on
their metrics. Company profitability history is erratic. For me, some of the
stocks are cheap enough now though --given that I'm making a theme-based
investment: Demand for new cars will surface in next several years in US, and
as status-conscious emerging market consumers become more affluent and
numerous, they will continue to upgrade to more expensive cars.

Paul,

If people are keeping the cars longer the spare parts manufacturers should
flourish too, because you have to maintain it longer. Most of them went
bankrupt in 2009 unfortunately I cannot recommend anyone. I have not looked at
them since 2009. The cars these days can be driven quite long especially in
those states where there is little snow (salt) in the winter. In my opinion it
is difficult to say when things will recover with the global austerity that has
to happen.

Take this with a grain of salt. I've had only a cursory look of the statistics:

Average FCF/equity in the last 5 years is about 10.4%. It's currently trading

I think GMCR was a bit a growth story stock, not a value stock. Even with this
major pullback I think risk and market valuation is to high. IMO JVA has a more
reasonable valuation at current levels, but it's come down greatly. I still
think Farm has more upside potential than JVA if they can turn the company
around. Industry wide- I'm reading into Starbucks latest acquisition. They just
decided to diversify into juices. IMO this shows that the coffee will be
growing much slower going forward. McDonalds and Dunkin Donuts in the market
place shows the coffee industry has staying power. McDonald's & Dunkin are also
into specialty drinks.

Anyway Coffee is a commodity and so is Oil and Natural gas. I think I'm more
inclined to invest there than the coffee industry, but I still might go after
Farm.

IBM: EKS, I'm in since '96 @$50. With a small add at $124 last year. Sorry I
didn't add more when Bill Miller was recommending it at that time.

"The thing that's... interesting about IBM is they're very transparent. They
tell you their long-term economic models of the business, they give you
detailed guidance as to growth rates and margins and cash flows. The upshot of
all this is that there's very little dispute about what IBM is going to earn,
and so if any stock should be efficiently priced in the market, it ought to be
IBM. And yet IBM for the last five years has grown its operating earnings per
share 15% a year, it's grown its dividend over 20% a year. It's bought back
stock every single year so shares outstanding have fallen. It's maintained a
fortress balance sheet during that time and through the worst recession since
the Great Depression. It's continued to have record earnings and either record
or near-record margins.

"So my view is if it can grow this way during a terrible time, what's it going
to do when things get better? The answer is it will do at least that well. Yet
you can buy IBM today at 11.5 times consensus earnings this year and 10.5
consensus earnings next year. " (ed: That was said 5/'10)

Hi Paul -

Do you see any other stocks similar to IBM where what they do is transparent
and the company can maintain their growth during good and bad times? Only one
comes to my mind where the board recently approved to increase their stock buy
back (they feel the company is under priced), raised their dividend and
continue to grow despite the slow growth economy. It's Corning Inc. (GLW).

Hewlett-Packard Company (HPQ) doesn't fit the mold. Their board is too
dysfunctional. I am sure there are other companies that make the cut but
sometimes it takes an investor like Buffet to confirm the obvious.

Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM)

ADM to Build Biodiesel Plant in Lloydminster, Canada
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/ADM-Build-Biodiesel-Plant-bw-2361943140.html?x=0&
=1

From the article:"...Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM - News) today
announced that it will build a 265 million liter (70 million gallon) biodiesel
plant in Lloydminster, Alberta, Canada, which will increase ADM’s North
American biodiesel production capacity by 50 percent. The biodiesel plant will
be located adjacent to the company’s existing canola crushing facility in
Lloydminster which will help optimize ADM’s agricultural origination,
transportation and processing assets in Canada.

“<u>The same agricultural processing operations we use to transform canola into
oil for food and meal for animal feed also provide ADM with the ability and
scale to efficiently produce cleaner-burning, renewable biodiesel</u>,” said
Mike Livergood, ADM vice president, global oleo chemicals. “This new biodiesel
facility will help support canola crush margins and capacity utilization at
this facility.” ...".

<snip>

"...In March, ADM announced plans to double the canola seed receiving
capabilities and storage capacity at the Lloydminster facility. The project,
which is expected to be completed by the end of the calendar year, includes the
construction of five new storage bins and a second receiving system, which is
expected to significantly reduce unloading times for area farmers....".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----

ADM's biodiesel investment was spurred by Canada’s renewable diesel mandate
which now requires all diesel fuel and heating oil sold in Canada must contain
at least 2 percent biodiesel. By building the plant adjacent to their canola
oil processing facility, they can gain production efficiency both in crush
margins and higher plant utilization.

I missed buying more shares at the recent $24,00/share low available in early
October I have raised my GTC buy up to $25.00;share. At this time I only own a
small tracking position bought in 6/2011 at around the current price level . At
a forward PE of 9 and total LT debt only 4.3x annual earnings (at my upper end)
it fits my value mold. Typical of these AG plays, margins are small and ROA and
ROE are at the lower end (definitely not like IBM).

EKS. Similar as regards other large tech companies? Maybe MSFT? I pick it over
Corning, because Corning does not sell to the end user. Their customers are
other industrial companies, which makes what they produce and to whom they
sell, less transparent to me.

Maybe for Mr. Miller, but for me, none of the large caps is transparent. They
all seem to either have many business sectors or are so international in scope.
Maybe food companies could be -- Nestle? (It's Swiss though ... so that means
little transparency -g-). Maybe bev companies which seem to me as an outsider,
to be straightforward businesses -- Diagio (DEJ), others. Much more complex
when you're inside and trying to operate and grow the business.

Perhaps I'm confusing transparency of operations vs. transparency of plans. IBM
has stated its plans/objectives. These seem to be consistent and often
repeated. And measured against in company reports to shareholders. So
transparent in this regard.

TC- sold. Completely out of mining (I also mentioned I sold Vale before)
FLU.VI - successfully swapped high cost shares for lower cost shares. Flughafen
Wien has new management in place and they have actually shown good traffic
numbers (+~7% in September). The big deal will be get the new terminal into
operation without delays or issues. Next years earnings will be down due to
startup costs and because they will take the full depreciation expense on the
new terminal, while this terminal will only open mid year 2012 but 2013 should
look much much better.

BK - sold some higher cost shares in my taxable account last week and hope to
buy back at the same price or lower after 31 days. Other than that I have
eliminated marginal positions in financials like C as well (this time at a
profit).

For the most part, i have substantially de-risked my portfolio. I continue to
believe, that there is substantial risk for a recession and/or a credit event
(probably induced by Europe but it could also be trouble in the US) that skews
risk reward towards the downside. Some of political developments in Europe are
quite positive (Berlusconi's resignation and a new government lead by Monti)
but then on the other hand the result of Italy's latest debt auction were very
worrisome.

Sign of the times - Barrons had an article about Advisers that have gone all
ETF. These guys don't even attempt to be stockpickers or mutual fund pickers
any more, they try to be in the "right" sectors. One of the revealing reasons
they stated is that they stated is that if a stock with bad headlines is in a
mutual fund they have picked, they get a lot of calls from customers but they
get none if a stock is in an ETF. Never underestimate the power of incentives!
It is my opinion that ETF and their rebalancing makes for a lot of weird
trading, which I think can lead to exploitable opportunities. I believe that in
the end the prevalance of ETF's will make the stock market much more volatile.

One thing that puzzles me is why the gross margin varies so much from Q to Q.

Also, the Sal/Gen/Admin expenses have steadily gone up every Q as well. Is this
because of acquisitions or organic growth?

In Q2, COR is up and Sal/Gen/Admin is down. In Q3, COR is down but

Whereas Mercedes autos means primarily Benz.

Mercedes may be a better value than Volkswagen. I haven't looked closely at

Big Oil find in Wattenberg field. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC) said
that land it controls in northern Colorado may hold more than a billion barrels
of recoverable oil and natural gas, the latest sign that U.S. energy production
is set to surge.

Anadarko Raises Colorado Oil Tally 
NOVEMBER 15, 2011

From the article:"...Anadarko on Monday said that results from 11 recent wells
in the Wattenberg field have given it confidence that it can drill between
1,200 and 2,700 wells in northeast Colorado. It plans to drill about 160 wells
next year.

Based on its early results, it expects its wells will ultimately yield between
500 million and 1.5 billion barrels of oil, natural gas liquids, and natural
gas. Finding a billion barrel field is extremely rare. Only a handful of
billion barrel fields have ever been found in the U.S..."

Samson Oil & Gas Limited (SSN) and Rex Energy Corporation (REXX) have been
drilling in the same area (Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Wattenberg Field area of the

I'd definitely buy MSFT over IBM. I wonder why Buffett did the opposite.
Perhaps there is the conflict of interest somewhere due to his friendship and
dealings with Gates. Perhaps he just thinks that IBM is a better deal because
it's mostly a service company now and therefore more stable long term and less
prone to tech disruptions.

If you look at numbers it's hard to buy anything in tech instead of buying
MSFT/AAPL/GOOG. Neither of the three is very expensive and all three are huge
cash flow generators with incredible moats. The only reason not to buy them is
their big market caps, which make it hard to double, triple, quadruple from
here. But that's true for IBM and BRK too.

I believe this to be correct. Also keep in mind that the Gates foundation will
own a lot of MSFT stock and later will get WEB shares too, so from a
diversification point of view, it may be a bad idea to have ton's of MSFT stock
in BRK portfolio as well. Then the close friendship between Gates and WEB would
certainly raise insider trading questions, if BRK were to buy f MSFT shares.

re: FBN

Your NCAV doesn't look right.

NCAV = Current Asset - Total Liability.

It's a negative figure for FBN, not to mention it has another $181m off balance
sheet lease obligations. So, it's not a net-net.

Looks at its FCF in the last 3 years, probably you can argue it's cheap on

Hi J Mako - When you analyze your value candidates do you take into account the
possibility of unfunded pension liabilities? I guess it only pertains to the
old companies that may still have some sort of pension obligation(s) for their
current and/or recent retires.

I was looking at some of the defense contractors (as Buffet and his group
bought a small position in GD) but was wondering if many of these older defense
contractors and/or suppliers to the defense industry might have unfunded
pension liabilities that would reduce their future value.

Didn't know if you even take into consideration any of these potential problems
or is it already typically disclosed somewhere (like in the YAHOO Finance

Hi EKS.

I like XRX as a comparison to IBM. Buffett is famous for using book value and
deriving intrinsic value based on intangibles or value not readily found on the
balance sheet.

Both companies have well know names, have changed their business plan focus
from hardware to service, and are strong free cash generators.

I don't expect to get much support on this opinion. Just a thought.

Also, thinking out loud here on some investment ideas. Discussed previously on
this thread is the flooding in Thailand. We discussed how the flooding could
have a negative effect on earnings but the opposite is also true for other
companies. Little LRAD could be one winner here. Rising commodity costs on
fertilizer companies have a positive effect on seed companies like MON.
Abundant new supply of natural gas in U.S may lead to more demand for n.g.
infrastucture as well as perhaps increased demand for converting n.g. for
automotive usage and for creating LNG pipelines and exportation facilities.

J Mako is right:

NCAV = CA - All Liabilities

There is very little reason to calculate CA-CL when other liabilities can be
arbitrarily huge. (There is some reason, but it's too technical to get into
here, since it's not what you think ;)). It's like people mistakenly claim that
some company has tons of cash without subtracting liabilities from that cash.

The theory is that if a business is selling for 2/3 less than NCAV then it is
worth more dead than alive...

Very few companies liquidate anyway. For most of them you should be looking for

Personally, I don't buy stocks trading under NCAV (CA-All Liab) in companies
that are losing money (earnings and/or CF). However, it's again a matter of

I don't think I know much more than you do. :) I am not really on the data
center or service deployment side of things. I see some of the stuff that
happens, but I am not directly involved in it. So thoughts below are all
anecdotal. :/

Blade servers - Small companies just do their own rack (or use cloud) and
change things fast as they grow. Midsize companies get into various bizarre
setups since cloud doesn't usually work while homebrew sucks and outsourcing is
not viable either. Big cos that are not technical at core might be getting IBM
setups - I don't really know. Then there are
Googles/Amazons/Facebooks/Microsofts that have teams for building out
data/compute warehouses next to nuclear power stations. ;) Even that changes a
lot, Google has gone through maybe 3-4 iterations of more and more
sophisticated setups in last ~10 years. I know this does not answer your
question really. :/

Services - I think things are pretty sticky until some IT-infra activist
decides to switch things around. Or the operational side of company raises hell
about something. But usually, if you get ORCL stuff or IBM/HP/etc. services
they stick for a while. There is still a lot of spectrum though - things are
very different between employee personal computer SW/services/support,
data/compute centers, HR/admin tech infrastructure, etc. Still even crappy SAP,
ORCL setups last for ages and even replace a simpler/better working products.

EDAC - Paul, Thanks for the reply. What p/bk and roe values do you guys
consider attractive?

Here is some info from an investor from another msg brd:

"No idea how much more they can produce before reaching capacity. They are
under contract to grow revs by $5M per quarter in the next few months so I
expect revs to grow to $25-26M per quarter. To be perfectly honest, I don't
care if EDAC grows beyond that. Here's why. If they get gross margins to 19%
which I think is entirely doable, and quarterly revs to about $26M, they will
start banging out $0.33 eps consistently beginning in either Q1 or Q2 of next
year. Sustained quarters at $0.33 eps takes EDAC to $27/share in about 18
months from today at a P/E ratio of 20. That's only delivering their backlog
and what they are committed to right now, never mind about future growth beyond
that. These numbers are becoming astronomical and sound silly to talk about,
but the reality is, all these projections are based on what EDAC's already
signed up for and the CEO's comments. Companies like EDAC with only 5M shares
available can experience this kind of exponential growth, that's why I follow
them and look for these turnaround stories and try and get in before they go
parabolic. EDAC is an absolute monster, they have blown away my lofty
expectations the past 2 quarters and my projections for the next 18 months are
absolutely doable. I'm completely confident of my $15 price target by April,
the other price target, well, we need to see about 2 more quarters of earnings
to see how much revenues and margins can grow and if my estimates are on point.

Aircraft deliveries are expected to grow starting in 2012 and increasing
through at least 2015. So this story is only getting started. The only thing I
see slowing down the EDAC train is a potentially terrible global recession
which could temporarily cut back aircraft demand. Outside of that, I expect all
my price targets and timeframes to be met."

I agree with Jurgis that ERP (Enterprise resource systems) are extraordinary
sticky. Huge outsourcing deals where the outsource typically runs the entire IT
of a company are sticky too since they are multi-year contracts (sometimes 10
years +).

Software imo is more sticky then hardware (Companies would switch from Dell to
HP computers without thinking too much) since it tends to be standardized.

I personally have not seen anything related to IBM yet at work but I have seen
Oracle and other ERP setups which last probably for ages. Changing an ERP
system in a company is sort of like doing a heart transplant on a life body ,
you don't want to do it unless you really have too. it is also my belief that
most other software systems are getting more integrated into the ERP setups,
which adds complications and also nice revenues sources for ERP vendors. This
is one of the reasons why Oracle is so acquisitive and SAP tries to do
everything themselves.

The above is all anecdotal (long suffering user :-( )

Barnes Group Inc. (B) may be a better "value" play with a PE of 14 and a much

I do like the play on the vendors that supply services to Boeing. UTX would be
another one but it's a smaller play on Boeing because of it's size. However,
UTX seems like a Buffet Buy especially with his recent GD purchases.

You do get a better dividend with UTX w/ a 2.5% yield vs B's yield of 1.5%.

Both of these companies fit my value criteria (UTX & B) so I will add to my

EDAC. It seems like the person is putting a trough p/e (which is a high number)
on peak earnings for a company in a cyclical sector. That is, at trough when
price is low and earnings are minimal, p/e is relatively large. When earnings
are large in future, people have anticipated this and then anticipate earnings
level won't be sustained, so p/e is often is relatively low when comparing that
p/e to the company's historical p/e.

Maybe it depends on your view where we are in the cycle. Stock has already
moved up quite a bit from lows, so it's not like people aren't expecting good
things soon from the company.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=EDAC&t=my&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=

"I'm completely confident of my $15 price target by April". Confident of a
target yes. Confident that the target can be achieved in the time frame, that
is hope. We're talking about a small company where unforeseen events can really
affect it. Plus the volatile stock market in general.

No intent to dissuade you from buying the stock, Kauz.
I am betting on the growth of aerospace -- both commercial airliners and
private planes -- and I've bought and am holding stocks related thereto, as

the complexity of the world and how much of it is still to be digitised, IBM’s
human platform looks unlikely to reach its limits soon. Perhaps not for another
100 years."

I used some Oracle stuff and some SAP stuff (couple years ago). In my
experience SAP was crap. Oracle deployment I use currently is half crap too. I
respect Oracle much more for their DB division and well for Sun stuff they
bought (Java, etc.). Of course, that's my technical user bias - I like the
backend technology, not the front end superugly ERP. But yea, ORCL is quite an
enterprise SW squid. :)

Good point.

But I suppose everything is relative and there is a price for (almost)
everything. If the P/B has gone down to 0.5, then a 8% ROE to the firm will
become 16% to a shareholder. And as long as the mgmt doesn't do stupid
expansion (of which return will still be below their cost of capital), that it
would be good buy.

OK, I will just patiently wait...

I am reevaluating my Peak Oil stance in the light of shale boom. IMHO, there is
a conceivable risk of overproduction, especially if economy remains weak. There
would be much more risk if natgas was easily convertible to oil though. :) I
may lighten on my overweighed energy portfolio if energy cos run up again.

Paul Senior keeps making this point to me periodically. :)

If the P/B has gone down to 0.5, then a 8% ROE to the firm will become 16% to a
shareholder.

Yes, but it's not exactly the same.
ROE is still 8% to the firm and it can only use the 8% (instead of 16%) to
invest in growth/dividends/etc. ;)
If you look at longer term, the fact that you bought a 8%-earner for 50%
cheaper than 16%-earner costs you in compounding. Here's the table - buying
100-20% earner for 100 and buying 200-10% earner for 100. And results in 10
years:

100 0.2 <- bought for 100
120 0.2
144 0.2
172.8 0.2
207.36 0.2
248.832 0.2
298.5984 0.2
358.3181 0.2
429.9817 0.2
515.978 0.2
619.1736 0.2

200 0.1 <- bought for 100
220 0.1
242 0.1
266.2 0.1
292.82 0.1
322.102 0.1
354.3122 0.1
389.7434 0.1
428.7178 0.1
471.5895 0.1
518.7485 0.1

Obviously this does not matter much for 2-3 year investors

I've found for me, it's a very good way to invest. Very suitable for me. For
others, apparently not.

Buying those assets for $100, after four years, book value with the low grower
is about $293 vs. $207 for the fast grower.

Perhaps too old-fashioned or just stuck in a Graham bowl, but for me, all else
being equal, I'll take four years for a value stock and a 100/293 = .34
price/bv at the end of it. It just seems like in my experience, eventually the
p/bk will get to some low number and not go below it. .34 p/bk is pretty low
for example. Not many get that low and stay that low --- so far not even
something like NWLI, which itself is consistently very low.

And of course, I wouldn't choose between the two hypothetical situations. I'd
take both stocks. -g- Both situations would appeal to me.

Yes, yes, yes, I'm aware of this pitfall. That's why I said "as long as the
mgmt doesn't do stupid expansion (i.e. growth) of which return will still be
below their cost of capital" which you've conveniently cut out. :-)

Correct me if I'm wrong:

Company 1 - ROE 8% - P/B 0.5
Company 2 - ROE 16% - P/B 1

When both company pay out all the earnings as dividends, both companies don't
grow and both give the investor the same return. So, high ROE is important when
it's a growing company.

If I'm correct, we are on the same page.

p.s. Of course, there are a lot of caveats in reasoning with ROE and growth. I
have reservation on the assumption that Growth = Retention Rate x EPS x ROE.

p.p.s. I still haven't received my copy of Buffettology... I'm definitely at a
disadvantage here given that you've read it but I haven't. :-p

Forgot to elaborate: My problem with this is, it gives the appearance the RHS
are inputs and the LHS is the output, and the mgmt can just dial up or down the
inputs to get the output. In the end of the day, everything is driven by the
characteristics of the competition.
