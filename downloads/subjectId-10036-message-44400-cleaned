Ruminating on banks gone awry, Greece, etc reminds me of collective stupidity
of Iceland detailed in 2009 by Michael Lewis...Wall Street on the Tundra.

"Iceland’s de facto bankruptcy—its currency (the krona) is kaput, its debt is
850 percent of G.D.P., its people are hoarding food and cash and blowing up
their new Range Rovers for the insurance—resulted from a stunning collective
madness. What led a tiny fishing nation, population 300,000, to decide, around
2003, to re-invent itself as a global financial power? In Reykjav&#237;k, where
men are men, and the women seem to have completely given up on them, the author
follows the peculiarly Icelandic logic behind the meltdown........"

It went something like this: My dog is worth $1 billion Kroner...your cat is
worth $1 billion Kroner. I sell you my dog and you sell me your cat. We are no
longer pet owners but are now Icelandic banks each with 1 billion in assets.
Fake value with astronomical asset inflation. I remember laughing at this at
the time, but it was going on world wide.

Iceland is a really interesting study as it is so small and isolated from the
world. One of the earliest implosions and not really linked to any "global
miracle".

Link to most interesting book, a compilation of various stories about the Great
Worldwide Stupidity (my words)

re Carroll - POS bank, imo. Very small (80M$ balance sheet) - the smaller S&L
converting have a way worse outcome than the larger ones.Right now they are
just breaking even - NPA are still high (~3% of assets) but are shrinking. Bad
demographics (Baltimore hinterland). Reserves are only 33% of NPA, which is
very low.

The biggest red flag is the underwriter - Stifel and the huge cut there are
taking (2$/share at the Mininum conversion). As far as I can tell, that is
unheard of, with similar small conversions, the underwriter took ~0.8$.

based on what I see this issue will have a hard time holding par (10$) and
probably see 8$/share. Just my guess of course. I recommend your clients to
stay away from this one <g>.

Going through these stocks again, Rockwell (COL) does seem undervalued if I
look at where the stock is now compared to where its numbers --p/bk, p/e,
p/sales have been previously. OTOH, all or almost all these stocks seem
somewhat undervalued on these historical numbers. Of course it's possible I'm
giving too much importance to these past numbers. You may be right in that the
way you may evaluate COL and the others, that COL is the best among the group.
COL's a specialized business (avionics primarily), so I'll be waiting to see if
the USA government will ever come closer to actually providing funds to upgrade
our obsolete airports. Maybe then I can get more interested in Rockwell
(presuming I can catch the stock before it moves up in anticipation of the
government actions). For whatever reason, COL's stock has already recently
moved up from lows, and in this volatile market, I'm just very reluctant to
step up for stocks off their lows.

It looks from the news this morning that you will be correct about GR being
UTX's target.

I've looked at UTX again, I see now competitor HON. I've liked HON stock in
past; I was a contractor at Allied Signal which was later acquired by HON, and
I like how Allied Signal operated. I like HON because of its diverse
operations.
http://honeywell.com/Pages/Home.aspx
If Yahoo average of analysts' estimates were to be correct --- 10.6x for 2012,
that would make HON a buy in my opinion. For me otoh, I already have UTX, and
based on stock performance, there's not much difference between the two
companies' stock performance during the last five years:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=UTX&t=2y&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=hon
And dividend yields are about the same too. So I might just stick with UTX.

all considered income, on which I'll likely have to pay state and federal

I have owned BWEL for about a year. I was able to pick some up in the 535-550
range. The dividend was recently raised to 4%. This valuation analysis appears
to be accurate. My math was similarly eye-popping. The water rights are the
most valuable asset, and I think its simply a matter of time before the value
becomes evident. The drawbacks of holding BWEL are the complete lack of
communication from management, and the lack of liquidity.

BWEL appears to attract a more patient investor, so it didn't drop much in the
recent market downdraft, only briefly dipping below 680. It does correct
periodically, and the decline in the price of cotton from the highs earlier
this year may have weighed on the stock price. The stock is ~15% off its
February high. Cotton topped out in March, and is about 40% off its high, so
BWEL is weakly leveraged to the price of cotton.

re UBS is starting to look interesting here. My estimates is that UBS
investment bank only generates 20-25% of their earnings, the remainder is
wealth management/asset management and some swiss banking operations.

There is talk about a radical restructuring of he investment bank, which means
that it will be sold or shut down, imo. I assume they give away the investment
bank for free, it certainly isn't worth much more <g>.
I would peg their earning power ex investment bank at around 1.5$/share but
that does not include potential buybacks due to the capital that is not needed
to support the investment banking business and may be used for buybacks. My
target would be ~10$/share - then you could buy an relatively pure swiss
asset/wealth manager for 0.8x tangible book and 7x earnings. My guess is that
this should work out OK when they slowly rebuild their tainted (imo) image and
increase the earnings power of their remaining business. UBS wealth management
is legendary and still has a strong brand, imo.

ConAgra Foods, Inc. (CAG)

Hi Grommit -

I am trying to figure out CAG and what they need to add (via acquisition) to
get those profits going again.

<u>ConAgra 1Q profit falls on higher costs</u>
<u>ConAgra Foods 1Q profit falls 42 percent, pressured by higher costs in
consumer foods division </u>
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/ConAgra-1Q-profit-falls-on-apf-42096196.html?x=0&
v=6

From the article:"...ConAgra and other food companies have had to raise prices
as higher costs for ingredients and other raw materials cut into profits. The
Omaha, Neb. company's announcement that it plans more price hikes is not
entirely unexpected, as higher costs for ingredients, packaging and fuel are
expected to continue to be a challenge for the remainder of the year and
possibly further....".

The company withdrew its $5.17 billion takeover bid for maker Ralcorp Holdings
Inc. on Monday. I wonder if they can buy a company that can help them "fix"
their raw material costs. Perhaps this is what they were trying to accomplish
through a private label division since there would be a little more flexibility
in their margin structure to absorb higher raw material costs.

I held off buying more shares this AM as the stock sold off on this dismal
earnings report. If it was obvious how they can squeeze out more revenues from
higher raw material costs then this one might be a buy. They have the capital
to "buy" a solution. The company is limited on how much they can raise end user
prices.

Gas Pipeline/Distribution Companies hitting All Time Highs - Over Valued or are
the new domestic NG shale reserves starting to kick into the storage &
distribution systems?

I have been watching these NG pipeline, storage & distribution companies on
every rally and have noticed that several are flirting with all time high
levels. One or two of the companies I watch could be characterized as reaching
high valuation levels (I would not buy them) but several others I see as fairly
valued or even under valued.

<u>Here are a few companies from my GAS_Pipeline watch list:</u>

NiSource Inc Common Stock(NYSE: NI) and CenterPoint Energy, Inc (Holdin(NYSE:
CNP) are ones I sold because of valuation but are near all time highs. AGL
Resources, Inc. Common Stoc(NYSE: AGL) and Atmos Energy Corporation
Common(NYSE: ATO) are close to their all time highs but I still consider
reasonable values.

<u>These are some on my watch list that still seem like value buys in this
sector: MDU, SEP, SE, TCLP:</u>

http://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/MDU,SEP,SE,TCLP/view/dv;_ylt=Ajhxj9LOehWTX1cLxF
ZIPILv7gF;_ylu=X3oDMTExYzFvNTI2BHBvcwM0BHNlYwN5ZmlUYWJsaXN0BHNsawNkZXRhaWxlZA--

I sold SE at $19.50/share since their PE was above 14 but based on the recent
run (and their business profile), at 15 PE they could be seen as undervalued.

<u>Sector Observation:</u>

As many of these companies begin to flirt with all time highs, could the market
be signaling that several of these companies will benefit from the increased NG
production from all of these new NG shale wells? It seems like the market is
pricing in increased production of NG that will need to be processed, stored
and transported in one or more of these pipeline networks.

AGL and MDU seem to offer the best values and own some of the largest storage
and distribution NG assets of the group. Of these two, MDU may offer the lowest
valuation. I am still a buyer of shares below $20.00/share.

Re: Aerogel

Hi Sergio:

After a brief search, it appears that Aerogel has been around and tested in the
use of several applications since the 1930's.

Two specific applications came to my mind: (1) Fuel Cell membrane/Catalysts
"container" and (2) Hydrogen storage "container". Two companies I own Corning
and DuPont have patents for products and/or manufacturing process for the use
of Aerogel,
http://aerogel.nmcnetlink.com/aerogel-history-2.html

From the article:"...Following the success of the new found process, Armstrong,
Hoechst, Dow Corning, NanoPore and Cabot all start programs to develop a
commercial, large-scale process for manufacturing aero gels. While these
companies are testing for versatility of the product, marketing studies are
conducted to confirm the value of the aero gel to industries. Beginning in 1996
and continuing into 1998, Dow Corning, Hoechst and Cabot develop independent
variations of the “silation technology” used to make aero gels. All three
companies file a series of patents for their new processes, and for potential
applications for aero gels...."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------

I guess I would bet on well capitalized large conglomerates to industrialize
"aero gel" into their manufacturing processes. DuPont and Corning are two
companies I own that have patents.

<u>Cabot Corp. (CBT) may be the best "pure" play.</u> As a value candidate,
they look attractive. http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=CBT+Key+Statistics With a
9 PE (forward PE at 8), Less than 2.5X's LT debt to net annual income
reflecting a low risk debt profile and pays a 2.1% dividend (only 21% payout
ratio). With some recent insider sells in May 2010 at $42.50/share, a
$30.50/share may provide a reasonable entry point.

I will add CBT to my watch list. Jefferies came out yesterday with a downgrade
on the company and suggest waiting for a few months before buying shares. The
other chemical company I am looking to buy is DOW as I like their AG business.

Maybe Paul has some thoughts on some value and/or speculative plays for aero
gel and it's development.

re Boswell and the water rights. I am not sure if the water rights are worth as
much as claimed. For one thing - if the ground water is used to growing crops
it would mean that if indeed the groundwater rights were sold, Boswell could
not grow any crops on their land any more.

I also know that water for agricultural use is heavily subsidized or discounted
and still based on the rules when the initial central valley canal system was
put in place. but i don't think that farmers could just sell their water rights
to a city that needs the water for full price.

An what about the oil and mineral rights that are worth 4B$. unless there is a
half a billion barrel of crude lying under their land, that number is highly
unlikely. Still, even heavily discounted, there seems to be a good amount of
value there....

Thanks for your thoughts.

The analyst downgrade on CBT makes little sense and seems to be based on the
sale of their supermetals unit.

<THE ANALYSIS: "Cabot is one of the most intriguing structural transformation
stories in chemicals, but near-term uncertainties likely trump the growth
levers," Alexander wrote in a note to investors. The analyst said Cabot shares
could continue to fall and recommended that investors wait three to six months
for more attractive prices before buying them.>

It's almost the opposite of what Zack's recent opinion:

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Cabot-Corporation-CBT-Zacks-zacks-3543506190.html

CBT sells for very reasonable multiples as you pointed out and was recently
illustrated in a Motley Fool article.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/09/13/the-7-highest-potential-return
-in-diversified-che.aspx

And CBT's forecast as of July:

'We continue to see solid demand in our end markets,' said Patrick Prevost,
CEO. 'The tire and automotive sectors are returning to their long-term regional
growth rates and the foreseeable demand should ensure ongoing high utilization
rates of our assets. There continues to be strong demand growth for high
performance electronics, such as smartphones and tablets that will benefit our
Supermetals business,' he added.

While aerogel has been around for almost a century, the range of products that
it is being applied to continues to increase. For example, residential uses as
in skylights is a rather recent development. From the website on my link in my

CBT. If it's in the midst of a turnaround as someone stated, then it's a buy
(maybe).

Based on past results --- no real growth in stated bv, not so great roe--- it
is not a buy (imo).

Otoh, based on past p/e it would be or could be a buy

Again otoh though, I've no idea why people in past have pushed the p/e over 20
for this company. It cannot have been for the dividend or earnings and book
value growth, or roe, or anything else that I can understand.

If there's a turnaround in progress, or maybe just if the market in general
improves, then I suspect that the stock will garner a higher p/e than
currently, and the stock price will have improved. Just based on a retracement
to its historical p/e numbers.

ConAgra Looking at ‘a Number’ of Acquisition Targets
By Matthew Boyle - Sep 20, 2011

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-20/conagra-quarterly-profit-trails-estima
es-on-higher-food-costs.html

From the article:"...Takeovers are “very high on our radar screen,” Rodkin said
today on a conference call, a day after ConAgra dropped its $5.18 billion bid
for Ralcorp, ending a pursuit that began in March. “We certainly do have a
number of different initiatives that we are looking at,” said Rodkin, who also
reiterated that the company is “still focused on private label.” He declined to
identify potential targets for ConAgra, which today also reported quarterly
profit that missed analysts’ estimates.

ConAgra, based in Omaha, Nebraska, is seeking to boost sales of less expensive,
store-brand foods as some shoppers trade down because of the weak economy.
Possible takeover targets include TreeHouse Foods Inc. (THS), Snyders-Lance
Inc., or J&J Snack Foods Corp., according to Alexia Howard, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein in New York...".

If I was forced to choose one based on their "Value" Metric it would be J & J
Snack Foods Corp. (NasdaqGS: JJSF). However, I think there are other private
label branded companies that could be had at a better value and transitioned
into a good line for CAG. Many of these companies are selling at PE's in the
high teens low 20's and are just not that cheap. I do suspect they will stay
with cereal and/or grain related snack foods and not venture into meat, pork or
poultry products. It's possible they might venture into fruits & vegetables. A
lot depends on the distribution channels they get in an acquisition.

<u>Seneca Foods Corp. (SENEA) is one name that has been discussed on the thread

manufacturing assets and could probably be bought for BV (ie $28/share). If
they combine this company w/ a cereal and/or grain/chip/cracker line, they
would have quite a few bases covered. It would take a good management team to
marry the best features of each company into a "private label" division but
each group have unique distribution channels that would complement the whole.
Lot's of growth expansion especially with SENEA's government/school accounts.

EKS, I note many utilities hitting new highs today.

I will just step up on my soapbox one more time:

It is amazing to me that so many people use the S&P as their index and their
bogey. "I beat the S&P (500) by such-and-such for so-and-so many years". That's
what people want to say. When in fact, the S&P has done rather poorly, and
poorly compared to utility indexes. "Everybody" wants to say they beat the 500
-- the "best" or "strongest" or "largest" or "most well known USA" companies:
the S&P. And nobody who wants to claim any expertise as a stock picker or
financial advisor wants to say they compare themselves to a "dull/prosaic"
utility index. Or for heaven's sake have to be put in a position where they
have to admit they can't even consistently beat some widows/orphans utility
index. And given that many funds/advisors can't beat the S&P, or only beat it
by very little, it's my opinion, that if somebody says or presumes or intends
to be a good stock picker, they might get a dose of reality if they compare
themselves to what utility stocks have done over any five year, ten year, or
longer period.

Utilities have just been very very good ltb&h stocks, dividend stocks, and
short-term trading stocks.
Too bad for me, I came to this knowledge late in life.

A bit better than S&P500, but not much. Worse than Nasdaq (starting in 1999 BTW
;) and Dow. Yes, this excludes dividends - do you have numbers that include
dividends?

Overall, IMHO, not impressive.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=my&s=IDU&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=&c=
^GSPC&c=^IXIC&c=^DJI - same

All of these are returning less than 2% annualized pre-dividends. I would
rather invest with Paul Senior given his claims of ~12-13% annualized if I
remember correctly? :P (Not even talking about Mike Burry. ;) Or Warren
Buffett... ;))

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=my&s=VPU&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=&c=

Hi Paul,

Thanks!

Stocks I like/hold:

MSFT - no need to explain.

CNRD - pinksheet microcap. Barges builder. Solid balance sheet. Hurt by the
Deep Horizon incident. But they manage to book orders from clients outside the
energy sector to offset. Decent ROE and net margin in the last 5 years. I
believe it's just a matter of time drilling will resume in the Gulf and CNRD
will benefit.

SODI - another pinksheet microcap. Semiconductor manufacturer for DOD. trading
at NACV level. Tonnes of cash. IIRC, average ROE is around 11-12%. Got some
messy bankruptcy history (and its 10K's need some good editing). I still can't
make up my mind to pull the trigger. I wanted some discount to NACV. Am I
unrealistic? Anyone got any comment on this?

And i've been vetting Corning (GLW) for a couple of days. No matter how I cut
it, the price seems too good to be true. P/E 6-7, double digit ROE for the last
4 years, truck load of cash, CFO was buying (whose last buy was the bottom in
2008). Products not under any near-term technology threat (unlike msft). New
product (Gorilla Glass) has potential. It appears to me the market is pricing
it for perpetual decline of LCD sales.

Any comment on GLW? Do I miss something obvious?

Thanks for the update, that PR came in after I left for work. I was mainly

a new merged company. I don't think the integration of Synders into Lance has
been fully appreciated yet. So it's hard to get a true valuation yet. Still
with LNCE. It would more than likely have to be a friendly deal. Insiders own a
big piece. They are also under going high input food costs, they can't pass

"GLW got me thinking of subscribing to Barron's because I saw reference to a
negative article there"

The benefits of having a subscription in this case. I can go and look. Looking
now, was it really a bad article that the person referenced?

http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&symbol=GLW (GLW:
NYSE)
By Sterne, Agee & Leach ($14.36, Sept. 9, 2011):

We have these statements:
"We are lowering our calendar third-quarter revenue and EPS estimates from
prior $2.03 billion and 49 cents, respectively, to $1.98 billion and 43 cents,
respectively, and lowering calendar 2011 revenue and EPS estimates from $8.1
billion and $1.98, respectively, to $8 billion and $1.84.
Our calendar 2012 revenue and EPS estimates go from $9.03 billion and $2.26,
respectively, to $8.7 billion and $2.01, respectively"

Otoh with the stock at $13.42 now and $14.36 when the article came out, this
can't be too bad when Sterne, Agee & Leach also say:

"Based on the revised guide, we have adjusted our estimates and lowered the
price target to $24 [from $26].
[We rate Corning at Buy.]" (edit: Bold theirs)

=======================
Also there's this blurb the previous month about Corning:

"A new QE? Markets Might Yawn, by J. Doherty

PERHAPS THE MOST POSITIVE THING to be said about today's stock market is that
it already reflects an awful lot of bad news, and companies have balance sheets
that are vastly improved since the 2008 downturn. One example: Corning.
Shares of the glass manufacturer have fallen 38% to $14.32 from roughly $23 in
February. "I've followed this company for my entire career," says Edward Shill,
chief investment officer at QCI Asset Management. There are times to buy and
times to sell, and of late, Shill has been buying. He sees maybe $2 to $3 of
downside risk and $10 of opportunity.

Shares reacted to the company's lowered estimates for this year's sales of LCD
(liquid crystal display) glass, which goes into flat-screen televisions. Its
customers have been reducing inventories in expectation of a slowdown in TV
sales. "Panel makers have historically reacted to TV sales," says Shill. "Now
they're trying to predict TV sales."

Corning's other businesses have become a larger part of the mix, and they're
growing rapidly. The LCD business contributes just under 40% of revenues, with
the rest of the company's sales coming from items like fiber used by the
telecom industry, exhaust-pollution filters for trucks and cars, and Gorilla
Glass -- a super-strong glass used in cellphones, tablets and laptops.

Corning's balance sheet is in fantastic shape, with $6.4 billion of cash and
short-term investments, more than offsetting $2.3 billion of debt. In the last
downturn, when shares traded down to $8, the company's balance sheet was is
such dire straits that the company's solvency was a concern.

Now Corning's shares trade just north of book value and at only 6.6 times the
$2.16 it's expected to earn in 2012. The icing on the cake: In early August,
Chief Financial Officer James Flaws purchased 75,000 shares at roughly $13.50,
spending a cool $1 million of his own money.

The purchase "demonstrates my belief in the company," says Flaws. While he
declines to say what he thinks the shares are worth, Flaws would say that "at
$13.50, it went below fair value."
==================================================
I have some GLW. I'll give some consideration now to averaging down on my small
position.

Tons of market data to sift through to balance out a trading decision and well

GLW (glassworks)

I remember back when this stock was going gangbusters, think fiber optics back
in the late 90's. If they would have done a secondary when everyone wanted to
own it would have been no problem raising a few billion to sit on the sidelines
for supporting the company when the good times stopped rolling. After the 3-1
split in 2000 and the crash of the dotcoms and tech the company had to issue a
grundle of stock just to stay afloat like this convertible issue done when the
stock was about 1.60/share.

Company has always been on the cheap side with dividends with management
overcompensated IMHO for a mediocre stock performance. Lots and lots of options
issued.

Doesn't mean that this one looks expensive at this price, but would rather
write naked put options to try and glean some premium as compared to owning it
outright with the small dividend.

Maybe you said "When I looked at the DJ utility index" in some other post. You
did not mention that specific index in the post I replied to. Never mind
though, since I provided a chart of IDU which is presumably "DJ utility index"
and, yes, you are right, it has beaten S&P since IDU's establishment. But so
has DOW. And equally weighted indices ( http://valueweightedindex.com/ ). And
probably commodity indexes. And emerging market indexes. IMHO, it's very easy
to look back and say "look here's my favorite index and it has beaten my hated
index".

You do have a point that very few investors beat "better" indexes. And if you
start picking "better" indexes post-factum, then almost no investors beat them.
Not sure what you can learn from this though, since it's not clear that the
lessons are applicable for the future. Would you suggest that utility index (or
commodity, or emerging market, or value weighted) will beat S&P for the next 3,
5, 10 years?

Returning to your statement:
if somebody says or presumes or intends to be a good stock picker, they might
get a dose of reality if they compare themselves to what utility stocks have
done over any five year, ten year, or longer period.

I still disagree. Sure on one hand you, Mike Burry and Warren Buffett
outperformed the utility stocks, so it's not a very high barrier to jump over.
However, I'm concerned that this leads to "best" index post factum picking and
claiming that no investor can outperform "best" index.

Hi Sergio -

Re: Platinum

ANGLO PLAT UNSP ADR(Other OTC: AGPPY.PK )
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AGPPY.PK

May I suggest AGPPY. I have owned this one for over 15 years (basically when
they started using Platinum in catalytic converters). Of the precious metals
"platinum" is the only one I have found that is used in quantity and remains a
good store of value. This metal usually sells at 2-3x that of Gold and has not
increased in value recently relative to the big run up in gold.

I own a few of the one-ounce Noble Platinum coins from the Isle of Man
<img src='http://bullion.nwtmint.com/images/platinum_noble_rev.jpg'>
http://bullion.nwtmint.com/platinum_nobles.php
The first platinum investment coin, the one-ounce Noble from the Isle of Man,
was introduced in November 1983. The Isle of Man is an ancient British
protectorate, and well known for producing a variety of high-quality coins with
innovative and unusual designs. From 1983 through 1989, The Pobjoy Mint of
England produced The Platinum Noble in sizes ranging from 10 ounces to 1/10
ounce, with the face value shown in "Nobles," a value equal the platinum
content in troy ounces. The reverse of all coins features an historic Viking
longship, “Thusly,” shown under full sail. The obverse features the young Queen
Elizabeth II with crown. 

A better Platinum investment is in AGPPY.pk. This stock recently split 6:1 in
11/2010. I like the company since they pay a dividend (every year since I have
owned them EXCEPT 2009) (
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=AGPPY.PK&a=05&b=2&c=2005&d=08&e=21&f=2011&g=v )
and currently it yields 2.25%.

The company is trading in the low end of its trading range ($11.56-$18.36) @
$12.55/share. Their dividend is paid in March and August of each year. The
stock is reasonably priced at a 14 PE, carries very little LT debt when
compared to it's net annual income and provides a good and efficient way to
speculate on platinum.

The stock is thinly traded as i believe the main holder of shares is the parent
company Anglo American. To learn more about the company here is the link to
their Web Site: http://www.angloplatinum.com/

This one is No. 17 in my Top holdings. My No. 5 holding is Anglo American plc
(AAUKY.PK) which was the parent company before the spin off of AGPPY many years
ago.

If you can find a 20 year chart that shows the stock splits and dividends paid,
this company has performed well for me, almost as good as my XOM or BHP during
the same time period. I continue to hold shares in the portfolio as a "store of
value" hedge and I am able to book some revenue from their dividend
distributions too.

Sergio H, I don't understand the question. We are talking about GLW, right? Are
you suggesting there's a better time to buy the stock?

I see GLW stock is now at a two-year low, and selling now a bit under its
stated book value. In past few years, stated bv has been increasing. The stock
in last nine years has, on average, sold above stated bv. That makes the stock
attractive by my reckoning. Of course, if someone believes that GLW's largest
business segment -- those flat panel display sales -- are going downhill fast,
and permanently (which could be), then GLW stock will fall more I guess. So
maybe there may be a better time to buy the stock. Or not buy the stock at all.

I'll just assume that management will respond okay to what might be normal
demand fluctuations, and so for me, the stock is a buy for a small amount, at
current price. With an intent to add more if stock falls further.

Maybe caution with platinum. It seems to me that every time there's a sustained
run on gold, you get people writing articles about platinum, and why it should
be considered as a buy, and why it's maybe now a better buy than gold. The same
reasons each time --- harder to find, more expensive, catalytic converters,
everybody knows gold, but fewer consider platinum and that will change, thus
helping to propel platinum stocks.

Betting on platinum after these articles have appeared has not worked for me.
For other faster/more astute or more knowledgeable people, playing platinum
might work for them. For me, the platinum theme is well-known and I suspect
already exploited. I'm sticking with the gold mining shares I have.

re AGPPY - Anglo mining does not look like a value to me. PE ~14, EV/EBITDA
~12x. you get a lot of mining stocks extracting Copper, Iron etc. for half that
valuation and less. they also suffer from signficant cost pressure (wages,
higher Rand etc. )

While Pt has industrial uses, most of the material used is recycled so the
effective consumption is much less than the gross consumption. The high price
also encourages economical use (cats using less and less material) and
replacing it with other/cheaper metals (Palladium being one of them).

Hi Paul -

Corporate Office Properties Tru(NYSE: OFC)
Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Comm(NYSE: DLR)
CoreSite Realty Corporation Com(NYSE: COR)
Government Properties Income Tr(NYSE: GOV)

<u>With the Market down by 216 points (-1.86%), I upped my position in GOV by
30%.</u> Stock yielding 7.9%. Goes ex-dividend 10/7/2011 for $0.42/share.

I am having a hard time finding the value proposition in Corporate Office
Properties Trust (OFC). They do offer some three different preferred series
(H;J & G) but none of them are selling below Par which is where I would want to
buy at. The common shares do not seems that attractive to me when I compare
with GOV. The stock is trading as if a Secondary is coming shortly but their
preferreds seem to be holding their prices.

I have started tracking their preferreds to see if they attract some selling in
advance of a secondary announcement.

The only possible value proposition when I compare to GOV is that OFC is off by
more than 40%. If you compare the same time period with Digital Realty Trust,
Inc. Comm (NYSE: DLR ) OFC is off by even a larger percentage. One can make the
argument that OFC is more similar to DLR as they build specialized U.S.
Government and Defense Information Technology data centers. The value
proposition is that these data centers carry a higher premium and through
buying OFC you own these properties at a discount when compared to DLR or COR.

I am watching but not convinced. I continue to own shares on DLR, COR and GOV.

Foster Wheeler AG.(NasdaqGS: FWLT)

Followed you in for a starter & tracking position on Foster Wheeler AG (FWLT).
I still own Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. (CBI) which I bought 6/10/10 @
$17.83/share. The theme was to buy those companies that participate in the Oil
& NG infrastructure build out. CBI is one that has landed a lot of contracts in
the NG area. For the price FWLT seems like a good hold especially that they
have $1.68B in backlog orders the largest since 2008.

These are the constriction companies I have owned since 2009: FWLT CBI SHAW FLR
& SI

I look at the fundamentals as well basic technicals. When a stock is hitting
new lows and doing so with average volume it indicates that there are more
sellers that have yet to unload. So, a buy on GLW today, before the program
selling reaction to the Fed. policy, would not be a good entry point or a good
opportunity to add shares. I would look to see why the stock is hitting new
lows instead of guessing or just looking at the numbers and saying it is a good
buy based on their prior history.

It appears that the flat panel displays account for half of the GLW's earnings
and that their market share in this segment has been steadily declining since
its peak in 2009. Additional concern is that only two customers account for
almost all of their flat panel business.

I do agree with you that some of the numbers indicate that the price on GLW is
close to finding a bottom. The PEG is very attractive and analyst are
forecasting that their flat panel sales will pick up.

On the topic of Platinum, what's different now is the relationship with the
price of gold and platinum. Platinum has historically and consistently traded
at substantially higher prices than gold and futures for the two metals are
currently even, suggesting that the upside for platinum is higher than for
gold.

FWLT is another stock hitting a new low on avg. volume, and not the best
opportunity to buy the stock. Just wondering what you guys like here. The PEG
eliminates it as a value play. The dividend is below 2%, margins are low,
growth rate is anemic. Just asking because I don't get it. The 13 analysts

The company works on energy and infrastructure related projects worldwide that
are sorely needed,imo. 1/3 of the market cap is net cash. Orders are rebounding
and next years earnings are supposed to grow to 2$/share+. Last time I bought
it at about the same price in 2010 with a crappy chart too and sold it 35$. I
hope to do this again and again. I give as much of a damn about the people
selling now than I did in 2010. I am also willing to buy more if it drops
further. I don't claim to know the bottom and but I think I am buying close
enough to make a profit.

On a technical note, Infrastructure stocks have a history to dropping hard but
also rebounding fast, without any catalyst i can see.

More thoughts on GLW.

I read the transcript of the most recent conference call. CFO hinted returning
cash to investors (buyback?) was now on the board's agendas.

I gave it some more thoughts. GLW's effective tax rate in 2010 was only 15%.
GLW has a lot of offshore equity earnings. So the GAAP earning figure isn't
real. To bring the money back, correct me if I'm wrong, GLW needs to pay for
the difference in tax. And of course, some of those retained earnings will be
plow back into Capex locally without incurring additional tax. I did a back of
envelope calculation. Assuming GLW will bring back distributable cash back
onshore after local capex, it's trailing P/E will be more like 8.5x.

Now, thinking about it, there is a simply way to look at it: we can simply use
EV/EBIT to bypass this taxation mess.

I suppose large-caps like MSFT, GOOG, CSCO, etc with lots of cash all have this
issue.

re insurers and interest rates; my main concern is with life insurers for two
reasons:
a) longer contract terms (and it's not clear how these contracts like life
insurance will perform at sustained low interest rates)
b) higher leverage (naturally comes with a) but increases sensitivity to
liability changes to shareholders capital. As a rule of thumb, a life insurer
has a 1/20 leverage and a property& casualty insurer 1/3.

Short term insurers should not suffer too much or at least not too long since
they can reprice their contracts annually to should adjust for the lack of
interest income with higher prices, everything else being equal.

Life insurers or LT care insurers are a different story - once the contract is
written, it is done, if the insurance has guaranteed (or assumed) a certain
return on their investment and they can't get that return because of low
prevailing interest rates, the contract will make less profits or may even
incurr a loss.

Furthermore, any policyholder has a put option, he can stop paying premiums.
Assume for example that interest rates are low for a long time and he has a
life insurance that is based on those returns. If interest rates were to shoot
up some time later substantially, new insurance contract would be on better
terms. The policyholder could exercise his put option (he would loose some
money but if the contract is still young it wouldn't be too much) and stop
paying.

The life insurer would then have to forego profits but even worse, but would
take a loss to book value, since most US life insurers activate the cost or a
portion NPV of the insurance upfront and that would need to be reversed (the
deferred acquisition cost is up to 50% of the shareholders capital for many
companies). Accordingly the hit to book value could be substantial.

This is just one example where screwing around with the interest rates and
yield curve (QEx) might screw up an industry at a later on.

Hi Sergio -

Foster Wheeler AG (FWLT) - My valuation observation

First, from my previous post, I started buying these Heavy Construction
companies towards the end of 2008 and beginning of 2009. My target list was
narrowed down to FWLT CBI SHAW FLR & SI.

http://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/FWLT,CBI,SHAW,FLR,SI/view/dv;_ylt=Ajhxj9LOehWTX
cLxFNZIPILv7gF;_ylu=.. .

<u>The theme of the investment was based on the expansion of the Oil & Gas
infrastructure from all the domestic shale drilling </u>and/or Obama's stimulus
program to fund shovel ready projects with the U.S. Government's $800B spending
spree and/or new proposed Energy stimulus funding w/ lots of chatter about new
nuclear plants.

I started positions in all of the companies except FWLT (based on current PE
valuations). After the Japan nuclear disaster, I closed (FLR & Shaw) or peeled
off shares (SI & CBI) in all my construction companies. As my remaining shares
approached new highs in 2010-2011. I closed out SI and maintained a 50%
position in CBI as they continued to land new NG infrastructure contracts
(search this thread for "CBI" as these posts document several major contracts).
[This link might work:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/boardsearchresults.aspx?boardnum=10036&SrchStr=C
I ]

(Note: I use the "search" feature a lot on this thread especially to check up
on my old posts and to see the exact entry prices and dates of buys and sells
of posters)

<u>Valuation Criteria:</u>

I have learned that standard valuation metrics are different for these Heavy
Construction companies. <u>The best first look is to look at their order
book</u> and if it has been growing and how large it is when compared to past
historical cycles. A quick review of FWLT's order book shows it is at
historical highs going back to 2008 levels.

<u>Second I look at if they are earning money and how their PE compares to
peers in the group</u> (see the current PE's from the Yahoo link above). I want
Forward PE's to be falling but these are not critical as they represent
analysts estimates which could be wrong.

<u>Third, and now an important value criteria for me is the LT Debt profile of
the company.</u> How leveraged is it and can their annual net income cover
their LT Debt obligations in 1 year or less. These Heavy Construction companies
must have little to no LT debt because of the cyclical nature of their
business. SHAW was a quick sale for me as they carried a lot of debt from their
Hitachi/Westinghouse nuclear business. They recently sold their 50% share back
to Hitachi. CBI has a very manageable LT debt from acquired companies which
have made them the leader in the NG infrastructure business. Annual FCF has
been paying this debt off while building BV of the company at a greater rate
than some of the other companies on my list..

As far as FWLT, I only considered their PE and forward PE not their PEG. It was
their large order book and forward PE of 9 that peeked my interest. Since I
have a pretty good understanding of the peer group of companies, FWLT looks to
me to be the best value buy (at this time). I still feel that the domestic NG &
Oil infrastructure will demand more dollars for at least the next 5 years, FWLT
and CBI should get their fair share of orders. CBI demands a 10 PE looking
forward and I can get FWLT for 9.

<u>Portfolio Weighting:</u>

<u>Based on my 2009 portfolio sector weighting for Heavy Construction companies
(2.5% of total portfolio), w/ my FWLT buy today I am up to 30% of my target
portfolio weighting.</u> I really want to build this up higher and plan to buy
more CBI and/or FWLT. I would like to increase the size of my position by 70%
but only if I can buy at the right price (A 10 PE or less and very large order
book). The risk reward for FWLT is a bit better than CBI at 75% return vs 65%.
My 2-3 year sell target for FWLT is around $35.00/share (75% upside) and CBI is
$ 50.00/share (66% upside).

That's how I evaluate my small FWLT buy today. I try to build a position w/
several small buys over time. As always, I have been wrong many times and will
be wrong in the future. It does help to at least have a method to the madness
and I hope I am buying closer to the bottom than the top. It's a 2-3 year ride
after all.

re GLW - i know a bit about glass and I like Corning. They have a very strong
market position in Display glass (Eagle XG and LCD glass) both from a market
share and a technology point of view.

The tax differential of approx 20% between the US tax rate and the foreign
taxes that GLW pays goes into deferred income taxes. If they can get around to
pay those (because of a repatriation holiday or earnings just stay where they
are generated) the book value would increase.

Corning is a "material" company so a lot of the know how is in how to make
stuff, not how it works together (system know how) or in the software. That is
why a material company like GLW always will incur a lot of capex and has to
carry assets on their balance sheet, because they cannot outsource
manufacturing, while most industrials know outsource quite a bit (the low tech
stuff as they claim) and achieve higher ROA than a company like GLW.

GLW spends a lot on R&D (~9% of revenues) which is way more than most
competitors. it seems to pay off since they do come up with new stuff like
Gorilla glass or the specialty products in their life science divisions or new
applications for ceramics. My sense is that a lot of GLW product go into one of
the many high tech value chain and since high tech tends to recover first, GLW
should shine again. With plenty of cash to fund operations and being the low
cost leader in LCD glass (their biggest competitor is Nippon Electroglass and
suffers from high yen prices) I am not worried about their future.

United Technologies to buy Goodrich for $18.4B
United Technologies to buy Goodrich for $16.5 billion in cash and assume $1.9

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/United-Technologies-to-buy-apf-1800614677.html?x=
Alex Veiga, AP Business Writer, On Wednesday September 21, 2011, 9:39 pm

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- United Technologies Corp. says it has agreed to buy
aerospace manufacturer Goodrich Corp. in a deal valued at $18.4 billion,
including the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt.

The deal had been rumored for days, sending Goodrich's shares soaring. The
stock was up more than 11 percent to $122 in aftermarket trading Wednesday
after word of the deal broke.

United Technologies says it agreed to pay $127.50 a share in cash for Goodrich,
which is based in Charlotte, N.C.

Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies anticipates that its sales will be
about $66 billion following the buyout.

Looks like the stock ran 20% higher from the first mention of the rumor. Should
be a good fit.

The bit I'm uncertain of is the tax treatment. The tax stuff in its 10K

re GR, UTX - 17x EBIT that is a lot of pay for GR. I don't think it's a good
deal. For one thing, the valuation looks rich, second it does not help with
diversification (GR has quite a bit of military business) and third with GR
aircraft engine components, UTX now competes with GR's customers.

This only works because of cheap debt financing (75% of the cost is debt
financed) and it looks like all the synergies and will accredit to the seller.

Looking at your criteria, first is order book and let's examine it further if
you don't mind. Not sure what you are looking at. I see that earnings improved
but orders not paid for declined. So, its a zero sum. Second is the PE relative
to its peer group, which appears to be higher from the industry per Yahoo

re FWLT - first you have to go beyond yahoo/finance to analyze companies. peer
comparison is not a bad first shot but not sufficient by far. For one thing, PE
is a not a leverage adjusted return - I use EBITDA/EV (which is readily
available and not impact by tax) to make a quick comparison.

When you do EBITDA/EV is is evident that FWLT is cheap because subtracting
800M$ in cash from a 2.4B$ market cap reduces EV.

>>You will be able to get it cheaper.<<

My bet is that even with the chart vodoo, you will not be able to pick the
bottom better than I do. Most likely you will be correct but does it matter?
Since you will never buy at a 52 week low you will never buy at a bottom either
by definition. Maybe, if certain chart patters occur (a LT consolidation) you
will be able to buy closer to it than I do. Based on my former experience, that
may not happen however i found that infrastructure stocks are high beta and
fall or run hard and fast and they also turn before fundamental indicators show
up. And they do have an improving order book (P16):

Good Morning Jurgis.

Sorry for ruffling feathers. Let me be more clear as to what I am saying.

When a stock hits a 52 week low its a good opportunity to look under the hood
and find out why. In the case of GLW I found fundamental reasons for concern
and in the case of FWLT I did not. On the technical side, known as voodoo on
this thread, let me give an example. CSCO hit a 52 week low in August but
unlike GLW and FWLT the new low came on double average volume and the stock has
made a nice gain since then.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=CSCO+Historical+Prices

So what I am saying is that the 52 week low is a good place to look at what's
going on fundamentally and technically. John Neff a well know Value investor
wrote in his book, JOHN NEFF ON INVESTMENT about his methodology for reviewing
stocks hitting new 52 week lows. I'm merely adding to take a look at the volume
as well when a stock hits a new low.

A good day to you.

re buying at 52 weeks lows.

Do what works for you. I look at technicals too but the problem is decision
paralysis when I focus too much on getting the best price. For me it's
important to get a good price and go from there. For example, I remember I
owned GR in 2008 and sold it because of obsession of short term price movements
(sky high volatility). I owned this stock at around 36$ and it went down 20%
from my purchase price. I know from a fundamental side that this wasa airspace
company with a strong product portfolio, a decent balance sheet and good
prospects. Somehow i never got around buying it again - decision paralysis. I
would not have held it to 120$ anyways but the sale sure cost me a chunk of
clownbucks.

FWIW, I added some FWLT today at 18$
