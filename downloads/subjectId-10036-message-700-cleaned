Robert - In addtion to Paul Senior's comments, here is some
additional info on MLHR:

MLHR Industry AVG
--------------------------
PSR 1.14 0.68
ROE 22 12
Margin 7.1 6.3

A PSR of 1.14 in this case is quite high particularly with the
size of the company. In fact there are only two other furniture
companies that have higher PSRs. Basically a PSR of 1.14 would
be good if its peers had and average PSR of for example 5 which
would indicate that MLHR was bombed out stock. The ROE is good
which says something positive about management.

Jeff, thank you! It helps. I was up 9% in January and now I'm even.
As usual, I'll save your reply for reference. BTW, my largest gain
is in an oil drilling stock (Ensco) that is still being recommended.
I've had it over two years, but wouldn't buy it at todays level.
It amazes me that oil prices aren't higher than they are.

I keep bringing this one up, and I certainly don't want to cram it down
anyone's throats (I don't even have a position), but here goes:

Premenos Technology (PRMO) Price 5 7/8 by 6 last I saw.

As of Dec 31, 1996:

Cash/Share = $56.482M/11.829M shs = $4.77 Cash/share
Annual Sales = $3.06/share vs. $2.84/share in 95
Quarterly sales = $0.93/share vs. $0.74/share in 4Q 95 (+25.7%)
EPS Annual -- not analyzed due to non-recurring charges
EPS Quarterly = $.05/sh vs. $.13/sh (-62%) due to increased
SGA expense

Operating earnings were -$69,000, but additional income (probably
interest income kicked the final earnings up to $.05/sh.
Long Term Debt is $0.17/share
Current Ratio is 69.948M/12.361M=5.66

At 6 ask, the enterprise/sales ratio=(6-4.77 cash)/3.06 sales= 0.40.
The Enterprise/97 earnings (~20) is 6.65.

Latest estimates from Wheat First and First Albany are .18-.22/sh
for 97, and around .30/sh in 98.

Assuming avg 50M in cash througout 97, with only a 5% return on that
sum, we get .20/sh in interest earnings. The 97 estimates basically
assume no operating earnings, which is what we got 4Q 96.

The Enterprise/97 earnings (~.20) is 6.65.

News:
Only news release this quarter was 3/24-- release of Templar 2.1.
Nov 18 Barrons: Chip Morris of TRP Sci & Tech promoted Premenos as
a buy (then at 8 7/8) because "financial services will be one of
the earliest commerce applications on the internet.""

Summary: If the company is going to be operating earnings neutral, then this 6
is fair to overpriced. If the company experiences any growth whatsoever in its
product lines (which it has -- but offset by SGA expense) over and above SGA,
then the shares become a buy at 6.

ACAR has a lot of problems like much of the subprime lending sector does at

to Dec 96 ACAR shareholder equity droped from 34mm to 10mm. IMHO this one may
not be around 12 months from now.

WHX is another story. Once the strike ends, the price should rebound quickly to
the $11.00 range and may continue to around $14.00 Book on WHX is $29.00+ with
over $14.00 in cash last time I checked and they made $2.18 in 1995 (last full

it get below 7.00.

Wayne Davidson: How much has your car depreciated since the first of the year?
How much has your house changed in value in the last 2+ months (if you got a
house)? Do you care enough to find out and make a sell decision? Regarding
stocks - if you liked them at higher prices, then what has changed in their
valuations/business models to make them unattractive? Just the stock price.
There's a reason these value stocks have value I think - they have problems or
are unpopular or something. For that perception to change takes time - not
hours, not days, and maybe not months. If you can get away from looking at
squiggles and focus on a long term payoff - like you do with house values and
car prices - you will do better in my opinion. (Note to myself: please try to
follow this advice too,Paul -g-). After all, it did take Buffett and Lynch some
time to make their first million (I think -g-). In short there, is nothing
wrong with the methods you see. (I am not sure about the stocks you've listed
though) Maybe in down markets, the artillery shells kill all living things.

I posted on OLS. Implied I was a buyer (I am). I am still a holder, and buyer
if the price goes much lower. I don't follow any of the other stocks you

Jay,Jeff: The AAII (American Association of Individual Investors) Stock
Investor is a software package that has an excellent display of each of about
6800 stocks, and industry norms (not only limited to PSR). I use it to
complement value line (for ones not in their universe). Also, the value line
industry classifications are very broad, altho I think you can select companies
and compute stats. Stock Investor is not as expensive as value line (but
doesn't have the rankings or analysis) or zacks (but doesn't have the up to
date broker and earnings estimates/monmentum ratings). Great for fundamental
historical data and screening based on it. Also, they do carry I/B/E/S earnings
estimate data.

They send you software and quarterly updates to stock data. Main drawbacks are
that their screening is not on web, they only update quarterly and need lotsa
disk space. Jeff: i do NAIC ssg's from their data, although I prefer value
line.

AAII web site is:
http://networth.galt.com/www/home/planning/aaii/about/aboutaaii.html

Stock Investor Software

This quarterly updated program enables you to screen and analyze over 6,800
stocks using a menu-driven program. Stocks can be researched by using 300
predetermined financial variables or by creating your own variables. The
financial summaries for each company include: overall company summary, income
statement data, balance sheet data, key ratios, share summary, valuations, and
dividend reinvestment plan summary.

All active stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange,
Nasdaq National Market and Nasdaq Small-Cap are covered. Features include:

Covers over 6,800 stocks
Ability to create custom variables
More than 300 financial variables for each stock
Custom screens using company and industry data
Information on over 100 industry groups
Ability to sort stocks on any variable
Predefined and user-defined reports
Information on dividend reinvestment plans
User's guide with tutorial and on-line help
Ability to export data for use in spreadsheet programs

The Stock Investor requires an IBM 386SX equivalent or better with 35MB of hard
drive space to install, and at least 3MB RAM available for the DOS version. The
Windows version requires 8 MB of RAM and a IBM 486 is recommended. The price
for the program is $99.00 per year; $150.00 per year for non-members

Jim - You might consider Zacks Research Marvel for screening stocks. It sounds
similar to the AAII productin capabilities. It costs $150/yr for anybody. Data
is updated monthly from their web site (they may go back to weekly in June) and
you get access to other data like ACE and Zacks ranks. Monthly data is of
marginal use and quarterly data would be useless to me. As it is, I end up
doing my research for the first week or so after new data is released. With the
market volitility, a price could drop 30% and rise 20% over a month and you'd
miss it unless you had weekly updates. I looked at the AAII product and IMO RM
is a somewhat better tool. You can download a free demo from

I can pick off just about everything I need from my custom RM value report so I
don't rely as heavily on SSGs except for the final details. Before RM I used to
run 20-30 SSGs per month and now its down to 2-3. I spend the extra time on
other research like reading stuff from Edgar which I find more useful than
grinding through SSGs that end up as dead ends. And for that I use Value Line

Pardon my beginners questions. Does Zacks give you historical financial data? I
am attempting to learn how to distinguish an improving balance sheet and would
like to easily see changes in cash flow, accounts receivables, etc. I believe
that Value Line provides this.

Also, what is SSG?

Based upon discussions on this thread I am looking at SEHI. They had 36%
earnings growth last year and are trading at around 10PE. Could someone give me
a beginners lesson in reading this company's balance sheet? To my amateur eyes
this and other mobile home stocks like OH and CMH seem undervalued, and with
stable earnings growth, a potential good investment.

Jay - Zacks doesn't provide 10-years worth of historical data. What it does
provide that I find useful is 5-year average historical EPS growth rates and
year-over-year and 4-quarters worth of necessary data. Value line provides the
data you want directly to look for improving balance sheets. But just because
you have an improving balance sheet doesn't mean you have good value. The stock
may still be over priced. So I prefer to screen on value by identifying low PSR
stocks relative to ones industry group peers and then look for improving
balance sheets. I use Zacks RM to do this. This is much easier since the
computer does most of the work to qualify value stocks the way I define it.

As for learning how to read balance sheets, I'd recommend becoming an NAIC
member which has a nice Investor's Manual that teaches fundamental investing in
easy to understand terminology. It costs something like $30/yr
(www.better-investing.org). Or you might check out "Beating the Street" or "One
up on wall St." both by Peter Lynch.

The entire manufactured housing industry has been hit quite hard and it will
probably continue to be hit as long as there are interest rate fears. Of the
entire group, IMO OH and SEHI are the best values and CMH is still overvalued.
Its PSR is higher against than its industry peers. Other folks on this thread
that look at other factors will probably disagree with me here. If you want to
pursue SEHI, take a look at the 11/4/96 issue of Forbes which featured SEHI as
one of the top small companies in the US.

Happy Investing!

Jeff, Thanks for the great info. Why is PSR such a good indicator? (PSR is
Market Cap/sales, right?). It seems that sales has little to do with
profitability or value.... But perhaps you use PSR as a first screen to find
all the companies that have the potential to make a good profit/share, and then
look at the other fundamentals after that (or vice versa).

Jay - PSR is Price/Sales. Another way to look at is the amount one is willing
to pay for $1 of company sales. If the PSR is 1, then you are willing to pay $1
for each $1 of sales.

The reason why it is a good indicator is that it is much more stable than P/E
if the company experiences a glitch which is considered to be part of the
growth cycle for high-tech companies, even the best managed ones. It happens to
lower tech companies but usually for different causes. So while earnings may
drop 60-80% while sales remain flat or drop 10%, you can imagine what happens
to price. Price typically drops substantially when earnings decline. If sales
remain nearly constant, then PSR is going to drop significantly which will
identify a **potentially** undervalued stock.

>Why is PSR such a good indicator? (PSR is Market Cap/sales, right?).

The classic work on low-PSR value investing methodology is Ken Fisher's book
"Super Stocks" which we've discussed here. Check the archives of this thread as
we've had a lot of discussions about this topic which will probably interest

Return on Equity, aka Return on Common Shareholder's Equity is :

Net profit after tax/stockholder's equity

Don't forget to calculate this using the end of the year profit
and the beginning of the year equity. If you use the end of the
year equity, the figure will not be accurate.

It is a measure that is most useful in comparing companies in
the same industry, as the mean ROE across industries varies
greatly. It is not useful to compare the ROE on your steel stock
to the ROE on your software stock.

A similar ratio that is very commonly used is the Return on Assets,
aka the Return on Capital. This is:

Net End of Year Profit after tax
---------------------------------------------------------------
Total Capitalization (=LT debt plus equity)at beginning of year

You can see that the Return on Equity is a distilled version of the
Return on Capital. This makes sense since all debt originates from
a healthy amount of equity in the first place. You can use the
average total capitalization over the year if you'd like, or the
average shareholders equity over the year if you like.

Both of these ratios should be looked at in comparing companies
within an industry. In general, the higher the more efficient the
company is at producing profits, which implies fastest growth and
ablest management at making strategic investments that work. It
also means the best ability to generate cash for even more investment,
which will likely be good investment as the management has proven
itself adept at such choices.

You can see that some of us really like these ratios and use them
a lot, as they give a lot of information on a company. These two ratios belong
to a group of "profitability ratios" that includes
pretax profit margin (pretax profit/sales), net profit margin (aftertax return
on sales). They generally do not tell you much
about the company's balance sheet and financial condition. I
recommend the book, Why Stocks Go Up (and Down) for a good intro
to this stuff. It's by William H. Pike and is essentially the
text of the introductory investment course that he has taught at the
Boston Security Analyst's Society for 15 years.

You can get the figures for computing all ratios from the balance
sheets and income statements. Never trust another's figure -- always
work it out yourself.

Fm: Jim O'Shaughnessy

Hi,

The purpose of What Works was to test a group of Wall Street's favorite
investment strategies to see which ones emerged as the best. What I can tell
you is the simple screen of buying the 50 stocks from the All Stocks universe,
$10,000 invested on December 31, 1951 was worth over $8.2 million at the end of
1996, a compound rate of return of over 16 percent. That was not getting rid of
any low margin business. The same $10,000 invested in the S&P 500 grew to $1.7
million, or a compound return of 12.12 percent.

We also tested a variation requiring higher profit margins with low PSR, it
didn't do as well as the straight low PSR screen.

Date:3/29/1997 6:51:00 AM
From:Jeff Maresh

Robert J - For long-term holdings I like to find companies with higher profit
margins. They are usually the industry leader (aka Gorilla). I do this because
if they want to gain market share against their competitors who usually have
lower margins, the Gorilla simply lowers margins to a point where competitor
cannot afford to do so.

O'Shaughnessy's approach is to roll the entire portfolio every year which is
not practical for most small investors because of transaction costs. The reason
why O'Shaughnessy does not eliminate low margin stocks is simply that if he did
so, he would be eliminating turnaround plays. On turnaround plays, I look for
low margins relative to historical values for the company. When the company
does turnaround, margins rise (sometimes 2x, 3x, 6x...) which produces huge
earnings gains which in turn result in big share price gains.

So when I posted a few days back regarding my overall strategy for investing, I
was speaking of the one I use for long-term plays while I handle turnarounds
differently as described above.

Jeff

E Newman: re VVTV. It might work out okay. I make cash to be 56/34 or $1.60 sh.
Price to sales: 34M outstanding @4/160M rev = .85 Co is into radio, cable (#3
they say in home shopping) and seems moving into catlog - I'd guess to try to
get synergies among their diff. business units.
I have trouble valuing co. on a PSR basis. If they are making their money
mostly from catalog - that's where the revenue is coming from (and they doubled
rev with their acqusitions in past year), PSR would need to be lower to tempt
me into a buy. (Also inventories are 28M up from 8-- not sure what this means
given doubling of rev.'s and diff businesses. I think if they don't sell some
stuff, those numbers could be cleared off the balance sheet by markdowns which
will hit the income statement) But as you point out, lot of cash in the till,
aggressive expanding co. and stock price at a year's low already maybe
reflecting much of the negatives. Paul Senior

Do you think we could better Value Line. I have been watching and using VL for
years and when it comes to Value (Fundamental) investing information it seems
pretty hard to beat.

I would like to learn of the limitations of Value Line but would value work
just be reinvention of the wheel?

Hope to hear from you, Seattle Val

Revenues for Value Vision were 159 million in 97 versus 88 million
in 96 read press release:

ValueVision Announces Record Fourth Quarter,
Year-End Revenues
Direct Mail Operations Make Significant Contributions to Revenue
Growth
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., March 20 /PRNewswire/ -- Valuevision International Inc , an
integrated electronic and print media direct marketing company and the nation's
third-largest
television home-shopping network, today announced net sales for the fourth
quarter ended
January 31, 1997 more than doubled to $65,231,000, an increase of 140% over net
sales of
$27,167,000 for the year-ago quarter.
ValueVision's direct-mail operations contributed over 50% of the company's
total revenues for
the quarter. Gross profit margins maintained their strength for the fourth
quarter ended January
31, 1997 at 45.4%, versus 40.3% for the comparable period of the prior fiscal
year. The
significant increase in revenues and the improvement in gross margins is
primarily attributable to
contributions from the company's direct mail marketing acquisitions made during
the second half
of fiscal year 1997. These operations include Montgomery Ward Direct, Catalog
Ventures, Inc.
and Beautiful Images, Inc.
ValueVision reported an operating loss of $402,000 for the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 1997,
compared with operating income of $689,000 for the year- ago period. The
operating loss was
due primarily to costs associated with the company's television home shopping
operations,
particularly higher program distribution costs resulting from higher cable
access fees, increased
marketing and promotion costs to enhance the company's programming as well as
additional
labor costs due to increased sales volume. The company noted that its direct
mail catalog
operations contributed positively to fourth quarter operating results.
The company reported fourth quarter net income of $882,000, or $0.03 per share
on
34,317,000 weighted average shares outstanding, compared with net income of
$3,242,000, or
$0.11 per share on 29,323,000 weighted average shares outstanding, for the
prior-year period.
The company noted that net income for the fourth quarter ended January 31, 1996
included
approximately $2,000,000, pre-tax, realized from equity in earnings of
affiliates, compared with a
loss of $250,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997.
"We're delighted at the fast start at generating operating profit our
newly-acquired mail order
operations turned in during the fourth quarter," said Robert L. Johander, the
company's chairman
and chief executive officer, "and we are perplexed by the revenue relapse
suffered by our
television home shopping business. Some of the steps we are taking to increase
revenues in our
home shopping business include increasing market research and marketing,
intensifying the
interaction with our customers, and improving our visual identity. We intend to
continue to
develop the revenue and earnings growth of our catalog and other direct
marketing operations
while working to improve revenues from television home shopping."
ValueVision reported an increase of 79% in net sales to $159,478,000 for the
fiscal year ended
January 31, 1997 from $88,910,000 for the prior year. The company's direct-mail
operations
contributed over 35% of the net sales for fiscal 1997. Net sales for television
home shopping
increased 12% for fiscal 1997 over fiscal year 1996 on a 9% increase in
full-time equivalent
cable homes (FTEs).
The company reported a net operating loss of $2,640,000 for fiscal 1997,
compared with a net
operating loss of $766,000 for the prior year. Net income rose to $18,090,000,
or $0.57 per
share on 31,984,000 weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal 1997,
compared with net
income of $11,020,000, or $0.38 per share on 28,627,000 weighted average shares
outstanding
for the prior year. The company noted that net income for fiscal 1997 includes
a $27 million gain
on the sale of two broadcast stations in a $40 million cash transaction
completed in the first
quarter.
ValueVision reported operating cash flows before changes in working capital
items and investing
and financing activities of $3,400,000 for the year ended January 31, 1997,
compared with
$4,000,000 for the year-ago period.
Expansion of Cable Homes
ValueVision's full-time equivalent cable homes increased 9% from 10.5 million
at January 31,
1996 to 11.4 million at January 31, 1997. At January 31, 1997, the company's
programming
was carried full-time on approximately 7.7 million homes, a 7% increase over
7.2 million full-time
homes at January 31, 1996. The total number of cable homes able to receive
ValueVision's
programming increased approximately 21% from 13.6 million at January 31, 1996
to 16.4 million
at January 31, 1997.
Strong Balance Sheet
At year-end, ValueVision had cash and short-term investments of $52,859,000,
total assets of
$166,413,000, current liabilities of $37,724,000, long-term obligations of
$1,443,000 and
shareholders' equity of $127,246,000.
On November 22, 1996, ValueVision announced that it reached an agreement on the
sale of
WVVI-TV-66, serving the Washington, D.C. market, for $30 million to Paxson
Communications
Corporation, plus and additional $10 million in the event the U.S. Supreme
Court upholds the
"must-carry" provision of the 1992 Cable Act. This transaction, which is
subject to final
regulatory approval, is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of
fiscal year 1998.
"We expect to build both the company's financial performance and return to
shareholders through
our active acquisition program. ValueVision's strong balance sheet enables us
to pursue profitable
growth by acquiring strong direct marketing operations that continue to
leverage our
telemarketing, merchandising and back office infrastructure," concluded
Johander.
Company Acquires 15% Interest in NetRadio Network
On March 10, 1997, ValueVision announced that it has entered into an agreement
to acquire a
15-percent interest in NetRadio Network, a subsidiary of Navarre Corp , a
leading national
distributor of music, computer software and interactive CD Rom products.
Following the
completion of the agreement, ValueVision's 24-hour per day shopping program
audio feed will
be carried by NetRadio, one of the most popular music and entertainment sites
on the Internet.
As part of the agreement, ValueVision has been granted exclusive rights for
most merchandise
categories to be made available in NetRadio's programming.
Stock Repurchase Program
In May 1995, ValueVision established a plan to spend up to $10 million to
repurchase shares of
its common stock. As of January 31, 1997 ValueVision had repurchased 1,047,000
shares of
common stock for approximately $5,826,000. On March 4, 1997, ValueVision
announced that
its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $10
million of the
company's common stock in continuation of its previously announced stock
repurchase program.

My bet is it scares investors away if only in that it will eliminate
TLC from the stock universe of people who use screening packages,
as has been discussed on this thread. Most screen for a lower
ratio on the debt/equity and debt/assets. I know I did when I used
to use screening programs.

The proliferation of these programs (which use data that ignores
one-time charges, exceptional debt circumstances, etc.) may well
allow TLC (and others) to fall off the edge of the earth before

St. Joe Corp. Any seasoned value investor should know this one. I posted a
summary of the story about a month ago. The new 10-K is out which shows beyond
any reasonable doubt that the management change is for real.

This is a unique story. The company owns about 3% of the land in Florida. For
50 years, they sat on these valuable assets and did nothing. About a year ago,
the majority shareholder ordered management to shake out the change, which they
are clearly doing. Major operating businesses have been sold, a $10 dividend
has been paid, and top quality management is now in place to develop the land.

This is no small cap. Market cap is about $2.3 billion.

It is trading at 76 now. I think it is worth at least $110, possibly much more.

If you are partial to asset plays, you have never seen anything like this one.

BTW, did you ever in fact buy CNTR? If not, this may be your best time to do so
yet. It closed at ~$3.56 after being punished for over a week during the tech

I do believe that this is a case of the baby being thrown out with the bath

Back in February I made some picks for a fantasy portfolio based soley on
fundamentals. I looked for stocks at or near their 5yr lows. Stocks that people
had mentioned on this thread. Actually my judgement was crappy even from a
technicians point of view. I did not wait for clear signs of reversal; or an
uptrend with rising support. Below is the portfolio I put together and the
purchase prices I "bought" them at.

USLD 10
CNTR 4 9/16
RTEC 4 1/4
EAR 2 13/16
SMTL 13 1/2
NMRX 4 1/2
BORL 6 3/4
CAMP 6 1/2
CYTO 5 7/8

Since putting together this group, I have read a lot on this thread, and also
some books on fundamentals. Now I don't understand the majority of the data I
read but I can recognize when revenues, assets, profit margins, ROE, ROA, and
EPS are increasing from one period to the next. I am now trying to read the
fundamental data and make selections based on data that shows a year to year
improvement; timing my purchases with the use of the charts. In addition, I am
learning patience; My selections won't skyrocket overnight, it will take time.
With my modified technique in mind, I have come up with the following four
stocks. Each has shown good increases in the afore mentioned data catagories.
But only one has a definatly positive chart. These stocks listed below are for
my FANTASY PORTFOLIO and in no way constitute a recommendation. Remember, I'm
sharing my skills growth with you in order to solicit your feedback to help me
grow more.

TBP Buy at 9 1/8 or better
MTY Wait for a more positive chart
MDCD Wait for a more positive chart
VVTV Wait for a more positive chart

I have several that have mediocre to poor fundamentals. I will look at them
only ocasionally (once a month if that).

If anyone here wants to help me out with my education, feel free; any comments
welcome. Paul Sr., Michael, and Jeff, you've provided great insight in the
past, so I'm especially interrested in your opinions

When looking at Price : Sales ratios, do you ever back out the cash per share
on the balance sheet from the price of the stock? This of course reduces the
ratio, and may more fairly represent how much a dollar of stock price
represents in a dollar of enterprise price. On the other hand this might just
be inflationary flim-flam. Does anyone have any thoughts? (All this assumes
that debt is either zero, or zeroed.)

Mike

From:James Clarke

Yeah, back out excess cash, but be careful how you do it. First of all, like
Mike said, if there is debt you've got to make sure you include that somehow.

Take an example. A company trading at $50 with $20 a share in excess cash and
no debt. I would start off any valuation by setting the cash aside and saying
that is worth $20. Then do any multiple analysis based on a share price of $30.

This is pretty elementary, but it is incredible how many mistakes people make.
I was reading a research report from a very reputable Wall Street firm a few
weeks ago. The analyst was doing exactly this kind of analysis, ripped out the
cash, then valued the business on a P/E multiple and added back the cash. But
he forgot to take interest out of the earnings. Thus he double-counted the
cash. Note that this is not an issue on a sales multiple, or an EBITDA or EBIT
multiple because that is before the interest line. That is the most common
mistake - double counting interest earnings.

Another common mistake is forgetting about the debt. A price to sales multiple
is very misleading unless you include the debt as part of the price. Both debt
and equity have rights to the sales, so the numerator should be "enterprise
value" (price x shares outstanding + NET DEBT).

I saw Mario Gabelli speak yesterday, and I'll post the several Graham-Dodd

fascinating. But all VERY illiquid.

National Presto
Hudson General
Greif Brothers

These are value investments for the intellectually rigorous, who don't care if
they make money in the next three years. But, as Gabelli said, any time you can
buy a dollar bill for fifty cents, take it.

It is incredible to me that there are still investments like this in today's
market.

I would add one (Which Gabelli told me he owns) - St. Joe Corp., which I have
pitched twice with no response. A CLASSIC Graham-Dodd investment, plus a huge

Mario we are all familiar with. Value investing, definitely, but you have to
know that when he buys he supports his stock. He continues to buy. You can not
own high flyers because you can not support the market. So, he pick stocks he
can handle, with money coming in to his fund.

Value investing with both Buffett and Gabelli, is they have to keep on
investing in the same stock. They are the liquidity in the market making. When
you sell, they are the buyers.

Certainly Gabelli has given you a 'blast from the past' since Grief Bros. was
the one Buffett tried to convince Graham on in the '50's and NPK was worked up
in the Intelligent Investor.

I must confess that I own some NPK if for no other reason than the dividend. If
you back out its cash, the PS, etc. start looking very good.

Where I'm going with this cash back-out thing is that I am beginning to find
IPO's from last year where the stock price took off, and now has crashed to
below IPO level. If you back out the IPO cash, PS starts looking attractive. So
long as there is no significant cash burn, I think that these could be nuggets.

James Clarke: Well these four co's seem to keep coming up in my life and I keep
missing them. Greif has been recommended by Phil Carret for at least 20 years,
maybe closer to 40. Every time I look at it, I just shrug. I could never get
comfortable w/the numbers or the co. (It's my problem, I'm sure); Worked out
great for Carret, but when I think about it, I figure....shoot, why not just by
Merck or American Home or IBM and hold for 20 years.

Same w/St Joe. Every value investor runs across this one. It's always
undervalued and they always own miles of prime FLA land. They are alway about
to unlock the value (Duponts are dying, Ball is gonna sell before he dies,
etc.). Well you are right looks like. Now management is doing something. In
looking at your past posts, you gave a threshold number that you thought the

Mike Chen: re. backing out cash from PSR numbers.

I seldom back out numbers except when cash is large percent of stock price. I
use PSRs for initial co screen and screen within industry. Too much work to
adjust each PSR number for cash (net cash, enterprise value) for co. in screen.
No evidence that I know of shows adjusted PSRs (for cash) is any better as a
screen than just PSRs. (I assume a net cash (after debt) co. has a higher PSR
than a peer co. with same sales but lot more debt. That's somewhat allowed for
in mentally banding the ratio, ie. 0.8-1. or 3-4)

After screening,with cash rich companies I try to determine if the company's
having a large cash position is a benefit or a drawback to investing in the
particular company. In a down market for a value stock... maybe a benefit. In
up market, for a growth co... they hould maybe be be putting all cash to work.

H. Sullivan: thanks for posting. Lots of stocks there to go through. Common
thread seems to be beat down tech stocks selling (mostly) under $10. I took
five minutes to look at MDCD, VVTV, CAMP. Since I know nothing of the
businesses or their current problems, I better back off and let others comment
who have more knowledge.

I have two observations based on my own experience.

Technical analysis works sometimes. When I need it to work, it won't. It works
perfectly in explaining what I did right or wrong AFTER I've done the deed.

Fantasy or theoretical portfolios don't translate well.
Something about seeing hard earned dollars "invested" in stocks which are
declining or going nowhere. Something about value investing being about
patience which is lots tougher when the money is tied up. In my experience,
I've found it's better to start actually buying small amounts than spend too
much time watching from the sidelines -- but of course you have to study and
watch for a while too, . . . it's just like learning to shoot craps ;-)

Hi Paul - You made a couple of key points here that hopefully others won't
ignore because they are at the bottom of your note. It seems like a lot of
folks that frequent this thread are traders looking for quick gains. There's
nothing necessarily wrong with that but it doesn't fit the classical value
investing methods of Graham, Newman, Buffett, P. Fisher, and K. Fisher.

Lynch in one of his books said that he made the most money on turnarounds
(translated: value stocks) after 3-4 years. Patience was the key. Also, notice
Buffetts style of holding on forever.

BTW, I don't know how everybody else's portfolio is doing but I'm still in the
black but down somewhat from the +5.5% of a few weeks ago. The hedges are
working well so far. TNH started going up when everything started down and
paying nice "dividends". Probably 20%+ again this year. Also YEN/EUNMF is up
11% for the year. I'm planning to nibble on more SGI and OLS next week.

You're right, to really value St. Joe precisely, you'd have to know where and
what the properties are. That information is not yet available, although new
management is trying to make it clearer.

My strategy was to value the things I knew for sure:
1. Cash
2. Shares in FLA, which trades publicly

Then the things you're not so sure of
3. Then you have almost a million acres of timberland. Timber has been selling
for $500-$1200 an acre, depending on the quality. So pick a number in that
range and value that part.
4. I think most of the value is in the 50,000 acres of development land they
own. What I did was pick a per acre multiple which I figured was a worst case
scenario.

Add them all together, with a couple odds and ends, and you should end up over
$100 a share. Its trading at $76, and management is definitely in the process
of trying to maximize that share price.

With that kind of margin of safety on a conservative valuation, I don't need to
know anything exactly. If the price were to go to my target, then I would have
to look a little deeper.

Tell me more. I am always looking for more things to read on investment, but

I just finished Tobias's (?) Investment Gurus. Great book of interviews with
top investors of all different "persuasions". Gabelli, Price, Sloate, Murray
make the value case extremely well. But growth and momentum investors are also
featured. These guys are not stupid, and the ones interviewed have stellar
track records. If you are going to be a value investor, it is very helpful to
know how the other guys think. A wonderful interview with Peter Lynch, who I
believe transcends all the approaches by combining their best elements, anchors
the book. He also includes a selection of top academics who make the case that
all these guys are wasting their time - nobody can beat the market

You can order the paperback from Amazon.com for about an eighth of a point

And I get to read about Mr. Womek. Yes! John Train's most memorable article (as
far as I am concerned) - -about the value investor (Womek) who never lost money
-right never - -first published I think in Forbes when Train was a columnist (I

Thanks to both you and Paul for your comments. One comment made several weeks

3 months." I keep that thought in mind and it helps me better understand the
time frames needed in investing; and to be patient. The upper list on my post
746 was made with purely technical criteria. This was before I read a lot on
this thread and gained just a smidgen of comprehension of the fundamentals.
Ignore them. The bottom 4 stocks were first selected by looking at the growth
of their financials using Wall Street Research Net (www.wsrn.com) and then
looking at the charts to select an entry point. Being more fundamentally savey
than I; Could you look at the bottom 4. Are these value plays? As for TBP: The
fundamentals look good and the stock is going up. Buy now, sell higher.
I did get tired of sitting on the sidelines. Bought RTEC and OTEXF. A little

Hi Mike - Ford doesn't fit my investment style since I prefer bombed out growth

cyclicals, Peter Lynch has a nice discussion about picking them in "One up on
Wall Street". Also, Fisher in "Super Stocks" recommends buying below PSR=0.4
and selling at PSR=0.8. Ford is in the "buy" range but I can't just the rest of
the numbers very well since I don't study these types of stocks. One method I
generally use is the look at the current PSR vs. historical highs and lows to
see where is now lies. Good luck.

Hi All :

Per Morningstar, all the three -- Ford, Chrysler and GM, have PSRs of 0.3 So
they are all equally good (or equally bad, depending on how you look at it!).

However, with rising interest rates, car sales might come down and whether or
not this materially affects the profits of the companies, the mere news might
bring down the stock prices (and the PSRs) further, thereby pulling up the
dividend yields to 6% and beyond. I feel that we can afford to wait until then.

And just as an aside, I am currently implementing Motley Fool's Foolish Four
for my IRA portfolio, and happen to have GM in it. And I think GM will be with
me for at least a couple of more years!

Remember that interest rates are not rising significantly,

I've been trying to learn some fundmental analysis (under fire so to speak) as
I've been short MU since last July and have taken a real beating. In self
defense, I've been going back and trying to better understand the fundementals.

I've spent a lot of time reading the 10K and 10Q's. Since MU's financial
statements include their partially owned subsidiary, it's made it very
difficult to sort the facts out. Some comments and questions I've got after
re-reading the MU's footnotes.

As of Aug 96, MU had cash and liquid assets totally $287 million, a decrease of
$269 million during 1996. Of this, $269 million, $115 is held by MUEI and not
available to be used by MU.

Then I looked again at MUEI's 10K from the same date and sure enough, it shows
$115 million. But since MU owned only 79% of MUEI, shouldn't they only report
79% of the cash?

I guess until I read this, I didn't _really_ realize that the financial
statements were consolidated. Since MUEI is a publicly traded company on it's
own, I didn't occur to me to think that MU's reports incoporated all MUEI's
figures into theirs. Which raises another question. MUEI is a 79% owned
subsidary. Should I be able to set the two Financial Statements side by side
and just subtract out MUEI's numbers? If I do, should I be able to subtract the
whole amount, or should I take a lessor amount since 79%

I've got some other questions specifically about MU but to start with, I need
to understand how to deal with the subsidiary relationship between the two
companies. Something that's caused a bit of discussion elsewhere is that MU
sold 13% of it's ownership in MUEI in Febuary. So for the current quarter, of
the .68 in reported earnings, .50 is attributable to the sale of MUEI stock.
(Unfortunantly for me, most of the web financial services are not
differentiating this) and to a casual viewer, it looks like MU has a nice
increase in earnings.

Since MUEI ownership has now declined to 64%, how do I factor this in?

Under the Liabilities and Shareholder Equity section of the BS, MU reports $53
million for "minority interest". What does this mean?

TIA

To all: I need a reality check on the discussion of value in the automotive
sector at the current time. I thought the idea for cyclicals was to buy when
business was terrible and sell when it was good (like buying straw hats in
winter). All have been doing fairly well and are building up cash to carry them
over the next recession (at least that's what chrysler claimed).

Also, I thought that you bought them at high pe's and sell at low ones - the
reverse of the usual guidelines. IMHO we are looking at limited (ie like
market) upside in the majors.

BTW: Value Line is relatively positive on the industry looking ahead altho
ranking 61 of about 100 with 01 tops, based partly on demographics and
favorable comparisons to last years strike depressed results. Their industry
summary indicates that in their opinion, chrysler's stock price is overvalued
since their automotive operations are valued higher than the others, ford
probably a market performer long term but underperform the next year due to
troubles with overseas operations, and gm best introducing new models, stock
buy back and dividend increase.

IMHO the timing wrong to buy these.

My opinion only.

volume lines! That's a cyclical.

The other 3 are really retailers and I have no info on how they would be
affected by recession (AZO and DAP went public later). I realize that you were
presenting the results of a scan but I have some comments on them:

I'd question a PSR of around 1.4 (.9 for DAP) for retail operations. AAII Stock
Investor gives .5 psr for Retail (Specialty Non-Apparel) - would have to look
at more closely.

I did ssg's on azo and dap and got really good upside/downside and growth
numbers so IMO I'd agree they would bear looking into.

Azo has also kicked out on some of my value line scans. If I remember
correctly, I threw it out since it was so lowly rated by zacks (they recently
took it up to a 3 from 4) and zweig (9 the worst) and no great shakes (3,3) for
value line. Also, I noticed that the price has oscillated between 20 and 30 for
the last 3 years so you'd have to buy it low to have a good chance of some
reasonable performance. The 71% institutional holding and big negative cash
flow would concern me. Value line indicates that maybe with the quality of new
cars, competition and moderate weather that this has a very tough business
lately. They like it long term, but notes the volatility.

Fortunately, MU did not use MUEI stock in their treasury, as short term
investments. They will really show a lot of cash and short term investments.
This is a problem of 2+2=5, because the MUEI stock is certainly marketable
securities.

Minority interests of MUEI stockholders' are added in the liabilities column,
when MUEI balance sheet is added in the asset and liability columns.

Better go back to overbought and oversold, you can call the shots more
accurately, if you want to short stocks when overbought. Balance sheet can not
be evaluated to buy and sell stock. Only can be used as a relative value

my mind for the near future. Or like there may be better value found
in the next 3 months. Long term I have no doubt about value investing
still if what I see is happening, is really happening then going
into a MM or bond position for the time being makes sence to me,
there are just to many sectors that are down, some good value
stocks can go even lower as people and funds on margins have to
make margin calls, often this has little to do with common sence,
if the market was full of common sence we would not get caught up
in sell offs created by so many margin calls. This could take a
bit to settle out. Sure don't want to be in anything thats held
by some of the aggersive growth mutuall funds that have a lot of
tech exposure..if called, they will often sell anything that brings them real
cash before taking the hit and selling the margined stock, because they take a
bigger hit, ( have to sell more of it )..there
should be a law that any mutual fund who has to make a margin call
has 24 hrs to report it. It's a mess some of them can margin up
to 25%..past that point they have to thin their margin, at least
this is what a broker at AGE told me. I don't think funds should

Hi Jim - The PSRs came out of Zack's Research Wizard product and data is as of

We've had discussions on this thread regarding these ratings in the past. I
think the consensus of most folks on the thread was that VL doesn't rate value
stocks very high and that the data and commentary is useful. Personally I use
Zacks ranks as a contraindicator. I've made the most money on stocks buying
when the Zacks rank is 4 or 5. If its 3 or higher, it's usually too late to be
considered a value stock. The price may have already doubled from the bottom!

Thanks for the other comment on AZO.

Jeff:
Re psr: I'm not questioning the values of the psr numbers - I'm questioning
whether I would pay 1.4 for a retailer (like in industry specific psr's).

I made 38% last year buying stocks ranked highly by zacks, value line and zweig
with good ssg and selling when dropped to 3- zacks or upside/downside <.3. I
have used the buying low ranked also, but I like to see the + changes in their
ratings, especially with zacks. There are many ways to make money in the
markets. Not so good this year but what is?

IMO you are right on value line's ranking system bias somewhat against value
stocks - ranking is based in part on earnings momentum. I place a lot of weight
on the comments and ssg in these cases.

Good trading.

Jim: <Value investing is not working....All the funds that do nothing but hunt
value stocks are down.>.

To try to check this out, I ran an analysis on the Morningstar Principia data
base of the mutual funds they track for ytd as of 3/31/97. They qualify mutual
funds as value, blend and growth and large, midcap and small cap.

The overall averages of total return % for ytd for funds classified as value
and growth are:
Growth -4.63%
Value .60
compared to:
S&P500 2.69

So, at least for the mutual funds, the overall average much worse (loss versus
gain) for growth as of 3/31/97. I personally hold small cap value funds from
fidelity and t rowe price and they are holding their own (+.42 -.92% ytd), but
my t-rowe price new horizons (Morningstar has as blend but usually qualified as
small company growth) has been doing terrible (-11.53%).

The average numbers based on company size are interesting:
Large cap .50
Midcap -1.26
Small cap -4.40

Good trading.

Hi Jim: The data you put to me checks out OK, the Large cap doing
far better, or at least not as bad as the mid, and small caps
have been under a lot of pressure..and from the first of the year
value has held up best..but the "more recent" lows hit the value
funds and they have started to trend down in respect to the large cap growth,
all in all I think we can expect some up trend but I'm afraid
that with more rate hikes on the way the longer trend is going
to be down, equities have to compeat with bonds, and as long as
interest rates trend up the eq market maket will trend down, and
value stocks with it. Finding a steal doesn't help if funds are
squezzed by margin calls, even the so called steal can get
cheaper. I'm going cash and or short term MM..untill I see this
bleading stop..should have been there already.

Jim - I agree with you on the 1.4 PSR for a retailer. Too high.

The problem I have with SSG is that if I use Zacks and value line EPS
estimates, it will lead one into buying high PSR stocks with high US/DS ratios.
I lost money 5 years ago using straight NAIC philosophy which is why I use
Fisher's method. Its been working well and I still use SSGs to support
purchases. But I buy and sell now primarily on PSRs.

I like the long-term philosophy of NAIC and I don't like the churn one gets
with Zacks and Value Line methods even though I know you can make good money as
you have. I didn't beat the market last year simply because I bought a lot of
bombed out stocks, some of them on the way down. But at this point I'm just
north of even for the year so I can't complain.

Regards
Jeff

My small-cap value stocks are getting annihilated too, but I have no intention
of selling at these prices. Would I be more comfortable in cash? No. I don't
own stocks. I own pieces of businesses. I think I have some idea what they are
worth, and that value hasn't changed. If the market price drops, so what, as
long as you don't have to sell at that time. You will sleep a lot better (and
Ben Graham also said you will eat a lot better) if you deal with the market in
this way.

This message board is starting to take off. Good work, Michael.

Ford creamed estimates by reporting EPS of 1.20 vs estimates
of .90.

How should this figure, I wonder? One may say this cyclical
is obviously near the top of its cycle (hence the high
earnings and low PE), but with the economy
picking up steam, Big Three car quality surpassing
import quality for the first time in decades, and this
performance in the face of a strong dollar, can it be
that this cycle has some legs left? The high and stable yield
would imply a limited downside, especially with the stocks
all well off their highs.

Is this a kind of value investing? :

I read about this in a book (I think it is "Surviving the Coming Mutual Fund
Crisis" by Don Christensen). In that book, the author recommends the following
stock-selection strategy :

1. Look up the latest edition of "Moody's Handbook of Dividend Achievers"

2. Pick 12 to 15 stocks from different SECTORS (not just different
industries) from the Handbook.

3. Buy the stocks, preferably equal dollar amounts of each stock.

4. Evaluate the stocks after one year using the latest updated edition
of the Handbook. If any stock has been dropped from the Handbook,
you drop it too, and replace it with another from the Handbook, and preferably
belonging to the same sector as the stock that was dropped.

Is this a kind of value investing? If not, what do we call this?

The author (as well as Peter Lynch in "Beating the Street") claims that this is
a strategy that
could hardly go wrong, and one can be quite confident of beating the market, by
investing this way.

Dipy.

Value investing is different things to
different people. This sounds like a variation
of the theory behind the Dogs of the Dow.

The reasoning sounds familiar -- if the dividend
is high, the stock must be unreasonably depressed.

If you continually invest in stocks that offer
secure dividends that beat a benchmark rate
such as the 1 year T-bill,it stands to reason
you'd do well and that you'd be picking
depressed "value" stocks with better than average
downside risk. So why not call it value investing?

Mike :

This strategy, unlike the Dow Dogs, does NOT ask us to look for high dividend
yields. Instead, it forces us to look for stocks of companies that have
CONSISTENTLY INCREASED their dividends over the last 10 years (or more). The
stock does not necessarily have to be depressed (though if it is, it certainly
helps!).

Also, unlike the Dow Dogs, the portfolio turnover in this case is expected to
be very low (if you have done a great job of selecting the stocks, and also are
a little lucky, you might not sell anything for years!)

I am currently implementing the Foolish Four (a variation of the Dow Dogs)
portfolio, and to me, this one surely looks quite different.

Regards,

Dipy.

Mike: <Ford creamed estimates by reporting EPS of 1.20 vs estimates of .90.> I
was suprised when I heard this, especially like you said with the strong
dollar. I was even more suprised that a stock that suprised by 20% really
closed up! unlike wdc, sunw, etc

<can it be that this cycle has some legs left?>. Sure it has some legs left and
the fed see's consumption leading to inflation so they are increasing rates. I
seem to remember something about not fighting the fed. IMHO it's late in the
cycle with limited upside.

<The high and stable yield>: It does have tempting 5% yield, but does NOT have
a history of stable dividends - for 1990 it paid 1.50 for 1991 it paid .98 -
that last pesky recession again.

Again, I'm not knocking the company - just the timing for buying a cyclical.
They seem to be doing a real good job.

My opinion only.

good trading

Good luck - can't argue with your decision since at least once or twice a week
I am tempted to do the same thing. I just really think this is a correction and
uptrend will resume, probably this summer and I've recently been buying SPDR's
(S&P 500 Depository Receipts SPY ticker) recently. As for my stocks, I am
content with the companies I own a part of thru their stocks and always decide
to stay the course.

Time will tell which is the best approach for this market.
