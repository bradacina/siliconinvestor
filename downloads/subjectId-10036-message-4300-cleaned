Andrew,

Would you expound on your reasons for thinking this? I own BHC
via CCN, and FLA via SJP, but with this one I just went with TIMT.
I admit TRE is at least an equivalent.

TRE trades at discount to market value of its NL and TIMT holdings. Arbs short
both of those stock and buy TRE. TRE is cheaper way to play TIMT, just short NL
only. Get TRE 10-K and 10-Q and details of its recent lawsuit settlements with

Re:"Please don't take as a flame, it's not. My .02, sell, and if you are
looking for a grocery value stock, consider Albertson's on NYSE"

Mike "MOO"
Not bad, a company with 27 consecutive years of increased earnings and 25
consecutive yrs of dividend increases!!

I recently read a book "America's Finest Companies Investment Plan" by Bill
Staton, easy read, but very thought provoking, basically buy great
companies,like Albertson's, review once a yr or so and dump them if they dont
keep increasing earnings and/or dividends..

When you combine that with Buffetology(sp), try and value a company like a
bond, it seems to make things pretty simple. (Of course nothing is ever as
simple as it seems)

However its easy for me to see how someone could be very successful over 5 yrs
if you bought 5-10 companies like Albertson's, put them away and instead of
spending time on SI, doing something else like watch TV, ah ah ah well how
about get drunk!! Just my 0.02..Scott

I think it is really decent advice. But the way to make real money
is to find an Albertson's at its stage 25 years ago. To do that you need
resources like SI, etc. A company doing it for 25 years, like Albertson's or
Coca Cola, is probably valued properly or overvalued by the market, i.e., not a
value stock for sure. Buying such stocks is likely a way to get slightly below
average, consistent returns in the future - which really is not that bad.

Albertsons is a well-known Buffett-like stock. I keep it on my watch list, but
it never gets cheap enough to buy. It's not so far from fair value by Buffett's
method, but is a far cry from the 30-50% undervalued I'd like to see. And if it
did get that cheap, I'd have
to wonder, since it's so well-known.

Paul, Re: OLS

I know you've brought it up here several times. And any stock that keeps
getting brough up and keeps falling deserves some attention.
So I finally looked at it, and if it ever was a value I guess now
is better than ever. It's recommended as a Year 2000 play in one
of those Y2K books, and at less than book and 1/5 of sales for a
services firm it seems to hold value. After all, it's still profitable and has
a healthy dividend yield. And S&P looking to downgrade it from BBB+ - well,
BBB+ is a pretty high place to start from. What's your opinion on it, now that
you've watched it a year or two or more?

Paul (who I respect quite a bit) PMFJI, just my take on OLS, which I held at

I'm wary of stocks with a health care services bent at this time; witness the

businesses of these two are not identical to the health care division of OLS,
but it seems that anything that has a health care bent is in a difficult
situation at the moment.

Re Albertsons(ABS), I commented on it because its 1 of over 300 on the list of
Amer Finest Co's, found the book as mentioned thought provoking and may
implement the strategy in some of the accounts I manage.

I took a closer look at ABS over the last 5 yrs and not including div's has
gone from about $30 to $79, pretty good in my book. The 100 month graph looks
like a triangle laying on its side. As far as not being cheap, its not, however
tough to buy quality cheap...
Anyway it seems like a good strategy for a small account $10-50K where you want
to put 5-10 stocks in it and forget about it, maybe a kids Univ fund or
something like that.. Scott

re: OLS. Now there's a stock that will build character if you own it. My
problem is I'm a character enough already -g-. I've added to my position in OLS
at these low 11 levels earlier this month, and I've been in OLS since about
12/96. Aside: note that bv in Yahoo is incorrect IMO. Correct value is 10.4, so
price today is not below book.

I originally thought the problems that OLS faces would eventually be overcome.
These include: an on-going investigation of corruption in gov't billing alleged
of Columbia and OLS (I will just trust that OLS is not going to be severely
financially affected by any outcome -- I hope (of course) they are totally
innocent and exonerated); and home health care itself which is government
dependent and unprofitable. Since home health care seems to be a reasonable
alternative to nursing homes or other "assisted living communities", I believe
the government will act to restore some of the incentives they (the gov't)
removed after bad business practices by small (maybe big too?) operators.
Thirdly, the temp. business seems to be hurting the big players -- there was a
12 point drop in Manpower a few days ago when they announced weak earnings.
This is not due to lack of temp people or temp positions to fill -- seems like
companies are still going this route as full-time people in some fields are
apparently hard to find. Rather, in my opinion, the problem is a bunch of
recent IPOs of temp agencies and also, all (IMO-my belief) full service co's
are now struggling to get contracts from fewer large customers. (This is a very
difficult systemic issue and problem for OLS, IMO.)

Some of the specialist agencies - Robert Half - are doing great with their
specialties in Information Technology or Legal. (Aside: how astute of Ron Baron
to sell his stake in OLS last year and buy even more of Robert Half... and how
thick of me (and financially impoverishing too) not to have considered this
fact more carefully then.)

On the positive side, we have very good value statistics - psr, b/bv, div.
yield; there's been a change in some of the top management with new people
brought in (I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and just call this positive);
and continued financial losses in home health by OLS (OLS is the biggest
player)getting some gov't attention and political attention (I believe.) Olsten
has a brand name, and it continues to expand its temp bus in Europe (where
changing employment laws are seen spurring growth of this business) and South
America. They also are growing their professional services operations -
expanding their IT, legal, and financial staffing operations-- although this
segment is a very small part (by rev.) of their overall business.

Okay... so here we have a beat-up, formally widely-followed-and-owned company
(by mutual funds anyway), that looks okay on fundamental numbers for value
investors, but may or may not be able to solve its problems... although it is
reacting to those problems and trying to overcome them. (And management is
(are?) the controlling shareholders. These "fixes" will take yet more time. I
wouldn't be surprised if I have to wait another 18 months to 2, maybe 3 years
(oh no!--I just hope I can hold on.)to see some profits on my position.

I recall you saying you still own CCN. If you have been willing to hold on to
CCN, then perhaps you might also be able to hold onto and profit from, OLS. I
guess --and of course IMHO only, that the downside might be about 2-3 points
from here and the upside 7-10. Probably a reasonably good bet for anyone with a
diversified portfolio and a long-term perspective (that could be you -g-)

Robert Hoefer: If you're out there... as a fellow shareholder (there are only
three of us left - Olsten family, Hoefer and Senior)would you have anything to
add about OLS?

Hi Shane, re. JOB. I'm not following it. With only 200 employees and a high psr

the whole meal-- watch out jackals! (Uh sorry if I got my animals and their
home continents confused -g-.) But the returns on this legal, IT business are
just too good for MAN, OLS not to grab as much as they can.
Have you looked at staffing companies which lease employees back to companies
on long-term contracts? Two would be Staff Leasing (STFF- large and with a
fabulous ROE, per Yahoo) and RCM Technologies (RCMT -about the size and margins
of JOB, I think... Note, and as far as I can tell, not affiliated with the

Re: JOB

Management has been so inept for so long. Imhoff has been running the
company forever, and they are really only coming into their own because of
their (lucky?) recent focus on the IT temp sector. But they change their colors
rapidly and have no true, lasting expertise. Executive pay is too high for this
microcap. I don't always require good management, but when there's evidence of
bad management I try to avoid it.

The only margin of safety here is in continued growth, and I can't put any
decent sustainability to whatever growth they've had the last 5 years.
Personally, I'm more willing to bet on OLS to turn itself around by entering IT
and bumping JOB-types off, so I agree with Paul.

I should disclaim that I did once own JOB before they attained their IT cache.

Buffett Announces BRK is Overvalued

Hey guys, did you read between the lines of the acquisition announcement today?
The biggest acquisition Buffett has ever done. This position is now
significantly bigger than Coke, and correct me if I'm wrong, probably bigger
than GEICO. Buffett passed on General RE last year when it was trading much
lower, and now he buys it at double that price. Why? Because he's paying in
stock. If you read Buffett, you understand the difference between paying in
stock and paying in cash. If you believe your stock is overvalued, you can buy
a fairly valued business at a discount. I think that's what happened today. To
state it a bit more strongly, Buffett just went short $22 billion worth of
Berkshire Hathaway. That's not how other companies would look at a stock
transaction, but that's how he has written about it in the past. We may have
just seen the top of the market.

so 'yesterday' -g-. (But of course millions of people tune in to them every

This stock needs an event to happen which will galvanize (oops, sorry--still

James,

Buffett did it again. Lessons?

I said in February:

--------------------------------------
James,

One more way to look at the valuation of BRK
is to look at its market cap. Currently it's $64B.
Compare that to KO $170B, MSFT $190B, GE $245B and
GM $45B. This puts a nice upper cap to BRK
valuation - it won't be a ten-bagger. Sorry. :-)
At $640B it would have a market cap as large as
MSFT, KO and GE combined.

---------------------------------------------------

As Cramer says: Wrong!!! Almost 2-bagger in less
than half year with $120B market cap. But is it worth
this price? Not to me. Not when I can buy open ended
funds of Whitman, Price, Gabelli for NAV. Buffett
is a &$%&%# genius but not at this price. Maybe I'm
wrong again, but that's fine with me. ;-)

And James is right:

Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire, commented:
''The merger will bring more than $80,000 of

James: I like your analysis. He buys for cash when his stock is cheap and
switches to buying for stock when the stock gets high (too high). Personally,
if I were a Gen. Re holder I'd be glad to be in Berkshire, but I'd be somewhat
chastised that Gen. Re is being bought by Buffett. Because Buffett says (to me
anyway if I were a Gen.Re holder), "I'll manage your float better than your own
managers -- move you clowns out of 5% bonds into something more profitable -
and of course, being Buffett, I certainly am not going to overpay you for your
stock ---although you do get a chance to ride with me in Berkshire paper."

I own some insurance companies and I surely wish they would be more agressive
in dealing with their float. Of course they are bound by legal requirements as
to what they can invest in, but still... as a class, they seem just moat
managers-- staid, status quo types whose paramount function is not building
shareholder value.
Some of my P&C positions have crept up as the overall market has increased and
the price/book values have climbed from my purchase price. IMO, these companies
almost all need someone to shake them up-- else they will continue to languish.

That being said, one company people might look at who are seeking a similar co.
to Gen. Re. might be NAC Re (NRC) which perhaps has some of the same financial
numbers (but not the size). I do not own, nor do I follow this co - nor do I
claim any expertise in evaluating or understanding the insurance industry. Paul

Paul and Mike,

Thanks to both of you for the comments on JOB. The thing that sets JOB apart
to me is revenue growth. They've shown they can grow the top line at @30%
annual pace while maintaining good margins and have been expanding
locations. I have no firsthand information concerning their level of expertise.
Their margins would seem to indicate they have it, but per MIke perhaps they
have no real competitive advantage in the IT/accounting area. Like he
mentioned, perhaps they were just lucky.

Below I've listed some numbers for competitors in the area. Prices are as of
end of May I believe, and the ratios are based on them. They are sorted in
order of highest 12mm margins to lowest. OLS clearly seems out of pattern
with the others. Hope this is useful. Thanks again. Shane

Chris Craft has a margin of safety but little to recommend it. Any significant

willy-nilly with their/BHC's cash. Looks like the acquisitions they have made
have been prudent. But it's a classic value stock - little downside but no
reason for it to go up right now. It seems to be moving with the market

the market is wrong and we are right about the company"s value.
So isnt the exact opposite doing the same except that the assessment is that
the market is wrong by placing a high value on our candidate. But Siris goes on
to say that "individuals can find short ideas as often as they find long
ideas." and he makes an important point that "They have to be very sure they
know why they are shorting a stock-and that reason shouldn"t be merely that it
is overpriced."
Now I am not advocating short selling because I do not personally have the risk
tolerance for it. However when confident that an issue is seriously mis-priced
for a good reason, then a low cost bear option spread seems to me to be a
contrary value play. My assessment was that DELL was an appropriate candidate
and several weeks ago I placed a 10 by 10 January 90 over January 85 put
spread. The reason that DELL is overpriced is because of the inevitable squeeze
on all box sellers which will result as lower priced boxes come on the market.
Similarly I am now assessing ITWO and the rationale for a bear spread is
because of the punishment meted out to MANU shareholders for their poor
assessment of the competitive nature of the supply chain software market
I would be interested in others viewpoints on the concept of low cost bear
spreads as an equivilancy to a low price value play.

Penobscot Shoe. (PSO) Go figure. You buy something because the business is
free, and the first quarter after you buy it sales go up 74% and earnings go
from a loss of 4 cents to a profit of 10 cents. Their spring line did VERY
well. Earnings came out after the close. I have to think this stock is going to
go up significantly tomorrow. If it doesn't move at the open, the first trade
will be mine.

No, I did not predict this. But as I have said on this thread over and over
again, when you buy a dollar bill for fifty cents, the surprises tend to be
good ones.

I went and found my first post on this stock a couple months ago. I don't know
how to do a hyperlink, so I'll just repost it. After the bell, this company
released sales up 74% year over year and earnings up from a loss to a profit of
.10. Earnings in two quarters are 35 cents. I know some of you own this, but we
should all be watching it tomorrow morning. - Jim

<< The company imports women's shoes and sells them under the Trotters
brand name. I've never heard of it either, but their biggest retail
customer is Nordstrom, which tells me all I need to know. Average price
point of about $70 a pair. The company has been in business for a long
time under the same management. The stock is controlled by the founding
shareholders. Lets cut to the chase - this is a crappy business. BUT...
1) It is profitable
2) It pays a 3.3% dividend yield that is not going anywhere
3) Orders have been up over 10% for the last two quarters
4) The company has bought back a very large percentage of its shares in
the last couple years, and may buy back more.

Thats not what you tend to see in a company with a valuation like this:

I will use Ben Graham's net-net technique of valuing the company. Very
simple. What do I own if I buy this business? Start (and finish) with
the balance sheet. In this first cut, we are going to consider fixed
assets worthless. We are only going to value current assets (much more
likely than fixed assets to be worth what the balance sheet amount),
though we are going to subtract all of the liabilities. Here goes ==>

There are 1.4 million shares outstanding, which trade at 6 1/4. So lets
start with the "asking price" in mind (remember, we are buying a small
piece of a business). That asking price for the whole company is $8.7
million.

Now lets go to the latest balance sheet:
- There is $4 million of cash and marketable securities. I know what
that's worth.
- Then there is $4.2 million of accounts receivable. I considered this
suspect until I talked to the company and found out that their creditors
are not middleman distributors, but rather Nordstrom, Dillards, and
other big name retailers. This is a sound number.
- Inventories of $4.7 million. Once again, suspect, until you ask some
questions. For you accounting guys, it is LIFO. And last year, the
company sold into inventories and booked income on LIFO liquidation. In
English, what that tells me loud and clear is that the inventories last
year sold for much more than their value on the balance sheet. So I
consider the $4.7 million number neither conservative nor aggressive
(they already took the LIFO liquidation), but I see no reason to haircut
it.

When we add a smidgen of other current assets, we get to $13.3 million
of current assets, or $9.65 a share. Remember, the stock trades at $6
1/4.

Now lets move to the liability side. This is easy. As Buffett and Graham
teach us, question assets, but always assume liabilities are real. Total
liabilities are only $2.6 million.

So that gives me a net-net valuation of $7.78 per share. In Ben
Graham-speak, at a 6 1/4 price, this is a 25% margin of safety. I would
have invested on the above, but there is more.

Remember, we assumed fixed assets are worth zero for our net-net
valuation. So if the fixed assets are worth anything, its "bonus
points". What do we find when we look into Penobscot's fixed assets?

Well, they own just two things (remember the business, they're an
importer, which requires no factories or anything). They own two pieces
of real estate. (Incidently, I am a REIT specialist, so I know how to
value real estate.) One is an industrial property in Maine which I
valued very very conservatively at $500,000. I assumed it was termite
and rat infested. i.e. - its got four walls and a floor. what is the
LEAST it could be worth. Then I called the company, and found out two
very important things. 1) the property is literally for sale, and 2) the
asking price is $1.6 million, and they think they could sell it in a
second for $1 million. So take the $1 million number. That's another 70
cents per share, or 13% of the stock price. If they sold this property
and used the proceeds to buy back stock, its worth even more to me as a
shareholder.

The second piece of real estate is the company headquarters, and is not
for sale, but we are talking about a leased building of about 70,000
square feet. The very least that is worth is $20 per square foot, or
$1.4 million. That is VERY conservative. Add $1 per share.

So lets wrap this up.

Net current assets $7.75 per share
Real estate 1.75
Total asset value 9.50 per share

and the stock trades at 6.25. That, my friends, is what a 35% margin of
safety looks like. i.e. I could be high on my valuation by 35%, but you
would still be paying fair value for the assets.

And don't forget, we would be getting a business (a net-net valuation
values the assets in liquidation, not as an ongoing business) which a)
makes money, and b) pays a dividend yield twice the market's yield.

This is what a value investment looks like. This is my second largest
investment, and my largest U.S. investment. With the dividend and the
valuation, I don't think it has any market risk.

I would be more than happy to answer any questions from anybody who read
this far. Sorry to be so verbose, but I wouldn't put my own money into
anything somebody pitched me in a one liner. Check my facts. The numbers
are straight out of the 10-Q and you can read about the real estate in
the 10-K. And the corporate treasurer takes calls.>>

Re: PSO

Thanks Jim for sharing your work on this one. I felt lucky to get into
it in a significant way in the low 6's when you first brpught it up. I feel
even luckier to be able to buy more today at 6 3/4. I notice that its run up
has attraced some sellers, but I'm willing to buy a company with a 3% dividend
and growing earnings up to fair net asset value, and I'm also willing to tuck
the shares away. I'm still holding half my Saucony, but PSO is better because:

1)Dividend while you wait
2)historically rising share price
3)assets are more substantial

I like that they have a niche and a brand that shelters it some from
competition. Looking at their historical sales, buyers tend to repeat, and they
have had some luck in attracting new buyers. I'm wary this Q was a lucky fad,
but nevertheless the value you pinpoint has a margin of safety that quells such
worries.

Nothing against your evaluation techniques, but why do you think some of the

the "we just wanted to diversify" or whatever, but it usually seems that

Congrats Paul. There goes Methode, up significantly on already-triple volume on
no news. Of course it's still on my "buy soon" list - other than Ron's
observations, I couldn't find a reason to invest quickly enough. Meanwhile, the
stocks in my portfolio have taken turns hemorrhaging, and it's awfully hard to
figure which ones are at risk cuz they all seem so darn cheap already. With an
average PE of 9.6 and an avg yield of 2.3%, PSO is my high-PE play <g>. I still
like all the stocks in my sealpoint portfolio, which is up-to-date except for
BHP, which I sold (at its short-term bottom) to make room for PSO. They've all
been brought up here before, but especially New Holland and Deswell seem
inexplicably cheap. The Deswell thread here is the best source of info on the
company anywhere, and Ron's recent post about his talk with the CEO may shed
some light on the weakness, which is overdone IMO. As I've said before, I've
talked with the CEO as well, and he is very seriously and successfully running
the company. He seems to regard the stock market volatility as extraneous and
somewhat humorous. Yes, the stock's down over 30% in recent months, but last
time this happened, he told me "long-term investors should regard it as a
buying opportunity." The dividend isn't quarterly, but it has been generous.
New Holland stock is no doubt suffering due to the emerging market weakness and
the threat of a world recession, but and as with Deswell there's a decent
dividend while you wait. And that low PE is real - the company is flush with
true earnings and cash-generating ability, even now in the face of the last 9
months of emerging market turmoil. Jim Clarke knows the company better than me
(I believe he's had access to management in the past), so maybe he can comment
on the sub-$20 price.

re: PSO insider selling, New Holland

PSO: Insiders sold shares late in 1997. It was Mildred something or other, I
assume she's an heir to the founding family. She lives off the shares and owns
a big (like 20%) chunk of the company. Don't worry about her.

The latest insider trade, the only one since sales turned up, was a tiny buy
from the treasurer.

And New Holland...I am responsible for this one institutionally, and am taking
heat. Below $20 is absolutely nuts. Earnings estimates came down a few pennies
today. So what? The company offers a FREE cash flow yield of about 12-13%. Find
me another one of those that doesn't make a product that causes cancer. The
company has analyst coverage, but apparently no real investor loyalty. There is
absolutely no catalyst, but at some point it just becomes so cheap that you
can't ignore it. (BTW, this is no 8 million market cap like Penobscot. New
Holland is a stock that any institution could buy - the market cap is well into
the billions.) I know this company well, and the valuation just boggles my
mind. It looked ridiculously cheap at 25, and now its 19! The company hosts an
analyst conference in two weeks - July 7th. If it doesn't go up at least 10% in
the next week, I need to find another career.

James (& Robert Hoefer #3953)): re RN. Thanks for info./opinions posted here.

I am ashamed and embarrassed to inform you that I have taken a small position
in this socially unacceptable co. Worse, I am trimming my outsize position in
ABT. Which means for today anyway, I am moving from a company that tries to
help people (to the extend that any publicly traded company does this) to a
company which essentially hurts people.

James, I think the risk of bankruptcy has lessened since your last post; and
the price of RN has come down also. At least several value investors are buying
positions -- Dremen and Al Frank and Robert Hoefer (-g-). On the other hand,
the exceptionally high dividend implies something that is not sustainable-- so
there is still plenty of risk in the stock. Back on my other hand -g-, one
thing that struck me in my reading was that with the gov't pressure, the
barriers to entry in the tobacco business are now enormous- it is not likely we
will ever see a new tobacco company being formed (or so I read).

Sometimes IMO, the best investments for value investors are those companies
with a very high shame component on the continuum of shame through pride (DELL,
for example, being a very high pride stock.) So this is a positive sign for the
tobacco stocks IMO.
I know there's quite a value contingent going for MO (Dremen, Yacktman, Clarke
(--g-) , but I am seduced by RN's dividend. FWIW. Paul

You just pinpointed the big flaw in New Holland. Management does not seem to
care what the share price is. Fiat owns about 70% of the company, and is
content to book the net income on its bottom line. The CFO wouldn't know a
share buyback if it kicked him in the butt. But the CEO is credible. And if you
want to talk catalysts, the CFO I'm talking about resigned a couple weeks ago.
I have to believe he was fired, he had zero credibility with investors. I don't
know the new CFO.

If you want to do tobacco, do Philip Morris. Don't be seduced by the dividend
or the Nabisco shares. Did you read the New York Times magazine's cover story
last week? The reason the industry settled with Minnesota for billions of
dollars was because RJR was afraid to face a jury - because a loss could have
meant bankruptcy. That's too close for me when there's a better company paying
a 4 1/2% dividend. The way I figure it is that Philip Morris has higher upside
in the short term, much higher upside in the long term, and lower risk of
disaster. I don't know why people mess around with RN.

Allen Furlan: re CMO. Well I looked, but it's too tough for me to figure. I
think it's okay on a bv basis-- I read their news release with $705m in equity
for 61-62m shares out., so $9 price is below $11 bv. (Although somebody on one
of the Yahoo msg threads says bv is below $9 as he calculates it.) And it's
definitely been a stock that's been hit -- so a lot of some risk is out of it.
(But maybe not all of the risk or the major risk-- maybe that's the crux of
it???.)

And other numbers might not be so great. Like potential or actual div. cuts.
Their ROE per Yahoo was about 20% (although as REIT their taxes would help by
being negligible) .. My opinion is that that is a heck of a high return for a
company that services paper (Sorry... putting my own manufacturing background
into this-- we'd nearly kill for a 20% ROE -- it's so hard to achieve and
sustain.)

Initiating and repackaging and selling of mortgages seems to be a 'strange and
wonderful' business. I can't even tell at this quick glance if other companies
I've looked at, or bought, are even comparable. I looked at and passed on RWT
(A REIT w/mortgages in the California market --- also a co. down at its lows),
and I've added last week to my very small position in UC (they originate and
repackage- stock price also down and below book, and with 3000 employees, maybe
(I only hope -g-) they might know what they're doing.

Not knocking CMO. If Gintel owns CMO, that is a very, very good sign. I've
watched (read about) this guy for maybe 15-20 years. He seldom misses. Although
he does miss. He can, and will, hold and hold. My history is that I've tried to
follow him into his picks, but I get chased out of his stocks before they
improve, and so I have not been able to profit from his ideas. Or his calls
have been too tough for me to understand at all, at so I've avoided those
stocks. They most likely worked out great for him though -g-.

My guess would be that if you've done the research on CMO and you like it at
current prices, you'll do okay with Gintel type patience. Anyone else... it'd
be a risky buy for them. JMO, and as you can see from my recent past posts,
-g-, I've been wrong many, many times before. Paul Senior

MO is safer than RN, James, as you say, and it is the one for more conservative
accounts. I heard on an NPR radio report that jury verdicts usually don't
bankrupt companies because of a principle in civil law that requires the
damages to punish but not destroy the company that has to pay. So a judge might
reduce an excessive award. I had the impression from the Minnesota case that
the companies settled because they were not getting a fair trial and the bad
publicity was tainting everyone's judgement, but perhaps that's just the
industry line. I haven't seen the NY Times story that you mentioned yet. Sounds
interesting. Paul mentioned the higher dividend on RN, but I would also point
out great P/B and P/S ratios too, about 1 and 0.5, respectively. And he must be

This time, I am one of the unfortunate ones who was wrong on CMO. A few years

environment possible for CMO, but the whole way mgmt. has handled this debacle
is IMO very poor. Plain and simple, they made a bad bet, using shareholder
equity as currency. In reading past reports, I recall there being mention of
the company usually faring better in a declining interest rate environment
(although not getting squeezed to this extent by a flat yield curve). To quote
from the '97 annual, "....provide our stockholders with superior rates of
return in a variety of interest rate environments." Why the big bet on IOs,

Hollywood Entertainment (HLYW) is very undervalued.

Price target is $22-$25

Following are my investment hypothesis:

1) Significant baked in-cash flow in maturing store base
2) Market large and fragmented, significant opportunity to grow store base from
1000 to 3000 stores
- Mature store ROI = ~50%
3) Revenue sharing will hasten consolidation opportunity
4) Stock market overreacted significantly to fears about re-emergence of
Blockbuster video
- I believe this quarter will be fine

Detail on investment hypothesis:
1) Significant baked in-cash flow in maturing store base:
New Hollywood Entertainment stores perform better over time. When a new store
opens, it takes a while to ween people from their traditional mom & pop video
retail outlet to the more compelling shopping/availability Hollywood format.
People slowly become familiar with the store and brand name over time, and
gradually do more shopping there (Just like Home Depot takes more people from
the local hardware store over time). Goldman Sachs data indicates that on
average a typical Hollywood Store does $625k revenue in year 1 and $70k of cash
flow, and then $800k of revenue and $180k of cash flow in year 4 (large
incremental contribution - tape gross margin drops to bottom line). At the end
of FY 97, they had 907 stores. Of those 907, 356 were opened during 1997, and
another 246 were opened in 1996. Well over half their store base therefore is
very new. If you looked at how much cash flow the existing 907 stores will
generate in 2 more years after they are fully matured, at Hollywood's current
valuation, you are buying the existing stores for about less than 6x fully
burdened (corporate overhead, etc.) free cash flow, which is incredibly cheap
for the 907 stores alone.
2) Market large and fragmented, significant opportunity to grow store base from
1000 to 3000 stores - Mature store ROI =~50%
Blockbuster has about 30% of the market, Hollywood about 8%, Other public
companies about 6%, and the rest are Mom & Pops. There is a huge remaining
opportunity for both Hollywood and Blockbuster to gain share. In the previous
paragraph, my hypothesis is that at the current valuation, you are getting the
907 stores that Hollywood already has on the cheap. The extension of that
hypothesis is that you are getting the next 2,000 stores that Hollywood opens
for "Free". Goldman Sachs data indicates It costs about $400k to open a store
and the average store does $180k cash flow on a mature basis. This is a 45%
mature store ROI, so the economics of these stores are incredibly good. I don't
think the stock market understands how good video stores are from a cash
flow/ROI perspective.
3) Revenue sharing will hasten consolidation opportunity
My first two hypotheses become magnified under revenue sharing. Revenue sharing
greatly increases customer satisfaction through guaranteed availability of
tapes. This makes it all the more compelling for someone to go to a Hollywood
as opposed to their normal retailer because they know they can get the hit
movie at a Hollywood Entertainment store. Therefore, the dynamics of 1) the
store maturation pattern should improve because 2) the consolidation pattern
accelerates because Hollywood will now be offering a more compelling value
proposition than they previously had

4) Stock market overreacted significantly to fears about re-emergence of
Blockbuster video
- I believe this quarter will be fine

Hollwyod was a $14 stock about 2 months ago. It collapsed to $11 recently. The
collapse started after Viacom reported and indicated Blockbuster comped up 10%,
as compared to Hollywood's latest 5% rental comp. Then, another public
competitor, Video Update, reported a bad quarter, and blamed their troubles on
a rejuvinated Blockbuster. My reaction is several fold. A) Blockbuster comped
up 10% against a (1%) comp last year as opposed to Hollywood doing 5% against a
5% comp last year. Over the year period, therefore, Hollywood actually did
better (1.05x1.05=1.1025 vs. 1.10x.99=1.089). Blockbuster just had an easy
quarter to comp. against B) Blockbuster and Hollywood don't really compete
against each other, the focus of both is to consolidate a very large and
fragmented market. Concepts with inferior product offerings/retail environments
bear the brunt of Hollywood and Blockbuster growth. Video Update is having
trouble because their stores are no-frills boring shopping environments that
don't attract customers. Mom & Pops have got it even worse when you compare
their offerings to a Hollywood or a Blockbuster. C) However, I don't completely
dismiss Blockbuster either, as they are a sleeping giant. To me, this quarter
is a very interesting quarter for Hollywood. This is the last quarter
Blockbuster will be ahead of Hollywood both in terms of revenue sharing
agreements with major studious and a national advertising campaign. Next
quarter, Hollywood will be "caught up" as their revenue sharing deals are
finalized and the advertising campaign rolls out. Also, during this quarter,
they comp. against Jerry McGuire, which is the single best rental title of all
time. Anyway, this quarter is their single biggest risk point in my mind, both
due to lag against Blockbuster and Jerry McGuire comparisons. Apparently, in
the face of these two issues, they are doing fine (with only one week left in
current Q). If they can do fine in this period, things should only get better.
Comping up this quarter would be a stunning achievement, and if it happens it
really demonstrates the robustness of the Hollywood concept.

Summary:

Valuation compellingly cheap on a cash flow basis, huge opportunity in large
market to grow store base and free cash flow -> story very misunderstood by
Wall Street as stock out of favor.

The above information is all my opinion. I have posted this hypothesis because
I own the stock and I want to give people a chance to react to my thoughts so I
am better informed. I appreciate all constructive comments, whether positive or
negative. Feedback is appreciated. Good luck investing.

Two cautions, IMO, are a high debt to equity (~.90+) and low ROE (~5%). You are
right about the cashflow being heavily discounted. So, if they can execute as

18acastra: Seems like every time I argue contrary to you, I lose. (Both the
argument and money -g-.) But I won't stop now -g-. Since I'm a buyer of Midway
Games (MWY) whose products are offered in Blockbuster stores, I obviously would
pick Blockbuster as my company vis-a-vis Hollywood.

Nevertheless, I don't see any of these video rental chains as having such great
economics. If Hollywood can generate great ROI's it certainly isn't reflected
in the stock's financials that I see. Maybe because they keep putting the money
into new stores that aren't so profitable for a while. Great. Just what I need
in my neighborhood --yet another store that has the same titles as most all of
the other ones. I assume that's where the stores are going--cities where the
people already are. Country folk being tied into satellite so they don't have
to make the trip into town I'd think. And looks like my cable operator is
trying lots of things to get me to pay-per-view (like pay once and get to view
it all day.) That pressure can only increase IMO. (When will play-on-demand
show up?)

How about Albertson's? If it's about revenue sharing (and that rev.sharing co.
takes its cut and in effect maybe has the pricing control), should be easy for
any of them, Am. Stores, Long's, etc. etc. to do a deal with that company.
(Forgot the name of the company that started the rev. sh deals, but it is
publicly traded.)
In Texas, I could rent videos out of my local Kroger. I don't know Albertson's
or what they've got... but if the business is so darn good - Albertson's, et.
al. would have brains, space, inventory control, and checkout people just
awaiting to scan popcorn, pretzels and videos.

When these stocks dropped a year or so ago, the managements stated (I seem to
recall) something about dearth of hit films to carry over to video). Great
profits with Jerry McGuire apparently changed that.

So taking all this together I have to laugh when I see projections of
profitability FOUR years out. Yeah, sure. And if things indeed don't go right,
I cannot see where there's a margin of safety now in HLWY, or even VUPDA (even
if its bus model or share-of-market is way different.)

But as I say, I've been wrong many, many times- and you have been right on your
detailed analyses in the past (again as I remember), so you might be right here
too. And I'd certainly just like my share of traffic into Blockbuster for
potential MWY rentals.

Responses to issues:

Paul - your reaction to Hollywood is typical of most investors, which is why
the stock is so cheap. 11x forward P/E for 30% growth. But the
misunderstandings are what create the opportunity. Here are my responses:

1) Stores are cash flow positive year 1, just much more positive in year 4
2) Financials don't yet reflect true underlying earnings power of business
because store base so new
3) Supermarkets already tangentially in business - don't do a great job as not
destination locations, don't stock enough inventory, etc.
4) Blockbuster and Hollywood only companies that can do revenue sharing with
studious as only ones large enough for studios to administer directly - need to
drill directly into MIS system to monitor sell through
5) 50% of studios revenue (and growing) now comes from video rental. Release
window of 30-45 days before a rental type allowed to go on alternative format
like PPV or DBS and talk of that window being extended because video rental
enormously important category to studious. DBS penetration slowed greatly
lately. Only 27mm PPV enabled homes in US and not growing as opposed to 95mm
VCR homes -> what do you think is most important to studious?
6) Like I said a very misunderstood story - 11x forward P/E for 30% growth. But
misunderstanding creates the opportunity
7) Think WMS Industries, espescially below $3.5 is more interesting than
Midway. WMS sells at 50% of the value of its net working capital.

You're looking for value in a bull market, you need to take a look at
agriculture equipment stocks. There are four. DE, CSE, NH, AG. The leader in
the industry, John Deere, trades at about 12 times earnings. The up and comer
in the industry, Case, trades at about 9 1/2 times earnings. The other two,
which are credible companies with growing earnings, trade at under 8 times
earnings.

Of course there are reasons to be scared. Corn and wheat prices are down
bigtime and US farmers income should be down year over year. But they're not
awash in debt as they were entering past downturns. The corn is in the ground,
so a drought would raise corn prices and probably bounce these stocks about
20%. The danger is that the current crop comes out perfect and inventories are
high going into next year - exports to Asia are going to be way off.

I'm not recommending anything here, although New Holland looks phenomenally
cheap (400 million of free cash flow versus a market cap of about $3 billion).
Case also looks exceptionally cheap, although it was up today. But this is the
kind of industry which value investors should be spending their time
researching.

I have a question "el basico neophyto grande".

I am learning the ABC's of valuation. I understand that a GPE ratio (Growth to
P/E ratio) of higher than 1 is good, since growth is greater than the P/E.
Reading the Motley Fool I see they have a Fool ratio which is actually the
inverse of a GPE, (it is the P/E ratio divided by the annualized growth).

Can anyone explain to me why people consider a company to be fairly valued when
the growth is the same as the P/E? Like, why not 5 times P/E? Why not
1.9862837564 times P/E? Why not the square root of PI times Bill Clinton?

I can see that the more annualized growth then you should expect a higher P/E,
since the company is worth more. But why say that the P/E should be equal to
the growth?

Any SIMPLE explanations? Thanks in advance!

About the only thing good about GPE or PEG is that it get the direction
correct. All other things being equal, more growth is worth paying a higher P/E
for. But as soon as you start to consider things like risk, quality of
earnings, applicability of GAAP earnings, inherent nonlinearities in such a
simple relationship, etc, you quickly realize why you ought not use PEG.

Yet the thing that amazes me is that I have seen professional analysts use it
in their published buy reports. Amazing!

Interesting. I try to employ criteria like that for my taxable account except
that I keep the bar at 10 years. And TMO is one such example (12 yrs of
increasing earnings and does not pay a dividend).

I looked up the book and found the following 10 qualifiers :

BMET CSCO CBRL FAST HCCC ION KEA MSFT OSM TMO

However, it is quite easy for a company to fail to increase earnings (in which
case the stock has to be sold). And the fact that the investment is in a
taxable account doesn't help matters either. And that is where "earnings
achievers and potential future dividend achievers" like SYK come in. A complete
list is :

CMH DG HD LLTC MBI NWL SYK

These generally pay out very low dividends and hence have low dividend yields
and are attractive for investment in a taxable account. Of course, one has to
watch what price he pays -- that should go without saying.

Penobscot Shoe (PSO) has been looking very very strong. Its at 7 5/8 now, up
from 6 two months ago when it first appeared on this thread. I know there are
some investors in this one on this thread.

What to do with a sudden 25% gain in two months when you would have been happy
to make that in a year? I want to be patient, but I don't want to round trip
the stock. After much thought, I decided to hold on for now. Here is my
reasoning.
1) Net current assets value, adjusted for real estate for sale, is about $8.75.
If you add in real estate not for sale, based on a conservative valuation, its
more like $9.50. That looks like a buy point, not a sell point.
2) The last quarter was a phenomenal surprise, and the stock is so ignored that
it is having a delayed reaction. Sales were up 74%, and the business made good
money in what is normally a negative quarter due to seasonality.
3) It broke out to an all time high with virtually no resistance, which tells
me it could go much higher.
4) In my experience, these very cheap illiquid stocks generally spike all at
once, then fall back hard. I usually take my profits immediately on the big
spike. PSO is behaving very differently. It has gone up an eighth here, an
eighth there, and then today a half. Nothing extreme so far. The stock is just
looking very strong technically, not irrational. My sell signal is
irrationality or it hits my price. We're still have a way to go for that.
5) It pays a 3% dividend and has been buying back shares.

As for my timing - don't read too much into it - it was pure luck. But there's
a world of difference between that "luck" and making 12 points in a day on
Amazon, because I don't think I took a penny of risk.

I heard an ad on Limbaugh today pitching some option strategy which will double
your money every 90 days whether the market goes up or down. I was golfing with
a couple retail brokers last week and they told me that all their clients want
is Amazon (139 with a 52 week low of 9), Yahoo - up 24 (!) today - (199 with a
52 week low of 22) and AOL (the only one in the group that I think could
possibly be worth the same number of digits it trades at). The brokers are
trying to short these stocks, but can't get shares. Not that they are screwing
their clients. They claim to be advising them "what are you, stupid?" (as you
would if you're short the stock), but the clients insist they want to buy it -
its a sure thing. So far they've been right. These internet stocks are going to
be a major catastrophe as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow morning, but we
don't know when, and there are no shares to short anyway. That's another reason
why I am so comfortable owning PSO 25% below what its balance sheet is worth.

Respectfully,

Jim

James,

Congrats on PSO but I have a question. From eyeballing a volume chart on PSO,
the total volume since mid-June (approximate time of the nice earning surprise,
yes?) seems to be about 50K-60K shares. I could be off there but that's my
guess. Figuring that the average traded price since mid-June could be about
$7/shr, that's a whopping $350K-$420K thrown about in this stock. The resulting
move was about $2/shr, increasing market cap by a little less than 3million.

Question is, with this very small amount of cash involved, isn't it completely
feasible that readers of this board are a large part of PSO's support?

BTW, I really appreciate your detailed posts and do not mean to imply any price
manipulation on your part. You have been more than clear in advising the PSO
shares be purchased with limit orders and not at market. If my volume estimate
is off, I gladly stand corrected.

Re: PSO I would view it more from an "event trading" perspective. When I traded
futures I learned that for all the second by second analysis and intense
trading, it still often took a few days for surprise news to really sink into
the price of the commodity. In stocks, I've noticed the same thing, except the
less liquid the longer it takes to move. When the awesome earnings came out, I
plunged back in for more shares at 6 3/4 even though it didn't jump because I
expected a near term response if not an immediate one. In stocks, I tend to
attribute it to the fact that the same few massive screening databases are
often updated weekly, and many individual investors (the only ones that invest
in true microcap values anymore -g-) don't even recheck their screens but every
few weeks to months for new ideas.

Re: manipulation, on a value thread that - out of necessity in this market -
"touts" many microcaps, it is a concern. But in reality I think all the
long-term participants here know that even what seems like the best idea in the
world to two or three of us is panned by another two or three of us. Check the
discussion surrounding his initial mention of PSO or TRC, or my mention of
HYDEA. Moreover, we know that this thread does not move mountains, even for an
8 million market cap. However knowledgeable some here are, it doesn't appear
that anyone piles into any of the ideas here in what the Street would consider
a big way. I think James has had about the best timing on the thread in terms
of the ideas he brings up, but I wouldn't attribute it to us mimicking him,

Well, New Holland preannounced, which accounts for its fall
I presume. The charts told the story on this one. Crashing through
strong 23 support several weeks ago and then a 400% volume spike
the day before the preannouncement. On the NYSE no less.

This tells me that I am not in tune with the movers of the stock.
In the future, the same leakiness will guarantee that I and John Q

But I'll hold it because I still see a strong balance sheet and cash
flows, very positive earnings, a decent dividend, and a play on any Asian
rebound. Quite a pyrrhic task this value investing has become.

News blurb yesterday says that the co-founders of Yahoo are both
officially billionaires now. Company started 4 years ago, and now
a 12% stake is worth a billion bucks. They join the founder of Amazon,
who has been a multibillionaire for a few months now. Thousands of
millions on no earnings. I've been a permabear since mid 1997, so
I'll be the first to admit I don't understand the current investing climate.
I have a hunch that 15 years from now I'll be glad I experienced it
though.

Good Investing,
Mike

I'm with you, Mike...value investors are a forgotten breed, I guess. I'm
frustrated as can be by the internet tulip mania. See my reply to the response

Mike, let me tell you as an institutional holder of New Holland (and soon to be
an individual holder too) that you weren't the last to know anything. The
selling has been irrational, preannouncement or not. That was not the reason
the stock sold off. There are three reasons why it has been so weak:
1) Cyclicals, and especially agriculture equipment (falling corn and wheat
prices) have been very weak. Ag has sold off for good reason, but I think its
overdone, especially with New Holland.
2) The stock is an orphan. Its not real liquid, management is European (no
affirmative action in the stock market).
3) There are a few very large investors, given that only 30% of the stock (give
or take) floats. The rest is closely held by Fiat. One or two of those
investors are clearly exiting whatever it takes.

BUT...Mike, at least, I hope you read on this far. I spent the last 24 hours in
State College with the top 10 executives of New Holland and institional
investors and analysts. Earnings miss or no earnings miss, the selloff is way
overdone. And the stock actually rose today on the earnings miss even though
Deere was down hard. I sat next to the CEO at dinner last night. He is baffled
by the share price (though he may be more upset that Italy lost to France in
the Cup). He started the question and answer session with institutional
investors with a question of his own. "We sell more tractors worldwide than
Deere, we had higher margins last quarter than Deere. Why is our stock trading
at 7 times earnings when Deere is trading at 12 times earnings?" He didn't get
an answer.

This stock is a screaming buy anywhere below 20. There is no catalyst on the
horizon, and there is a lot of fear on the ag cycle, but let's get real. Deere
is the U.S. leader, but New Holland sells more tractors globally than anybody
in the industry. The business produces about $300 million in free cash flow
(they did $400 last year, so I'm being conservative) and the market cap is
under $3 billion. They are reinvesting that free cash flow (I define free cash
flow as cash flow less the capital expenditures required to maintain the
franchise - if they reinvest beyond that at a good return, that's even better
than paying it in dividends) back into a non-U.S. business franchise that I
think is a real winner. (Wall Street analysts and institutional investors are
very U.S. oriented in this industry despite saying they want global leaders.
New Holland is at the very least neck-and-neck with Deere globally).

The stock trades at 7 times earnings. Senior management is honest and capable.
They have done virtually everything they said they were going to do. Fiat will
not sell its shares at anything under 30, nor will I. Wall Street analysts
agree that the stock is extremely cheap, but don't want to upgrade without a
catalyst.

As I see it, your downside is 17-18, and your upside is 30. The stock trades at
19. Do your own homework, but don't let anybody tell you that this is a
mediocre company until you find something in the financials or the management
to back that up. I know both very well, and I don't see it.

The risk is the ag cycle. Although at this price, I don't know how much risk
there is even if corn falls to $2.20 again.

Yeah, I'm saying buy the stock. What you should be looking for is a virtually
risk free 20% gain, with the potential for $28-32 if there is a drought in the
midwest this summer. (Droughts aren't great for farmers, but would be very
bullish for ag stocks. Don't ask me why.) I think the downside is not far below
where the stock trades. Mike Burry was early, though I probably would have gone
with him if I did not cover the stock insitutionally - his logic was not wrong
at all - a lot of institutional investors with all the information thought they
had a bottom at $22-24. (I can't say on this thread what I've been doing
professionally - that would be crossing the line). But personally, I am buying
tomorrow unless of course my firm wants to add to its position.

Sorry for the long post. Hope it was worth the read.

Mike, Wallace: re investing climate. Well I don't understand it either. Man, I
can't recall when so many of my stock picks and long term holds have been
trading at such lows. And in such an apparently great investment climate. OLS,
SFLX, EX, PGTZ, WDC, APM, CYM, ICOC, TCMS, OEA, TIMT, UNMG, CAG, NTAIF, ELAMF,
CCRO, HDCO, RACCQ, ESST, LODG, UC ------ whew! wow! Losers all. I still own
'em. And I can dig up a few more if I look. I'd be upset if I had to judge
myself by these downtrodden clunkers --g--.
Taking profits recently in Durakon (was twice mentioned in Barron's as
undervalued), CSTM (accepted buyout offer), LQU (was a bought as a short term
speculative buy), FLEXF (slight position trimming), ABT (position trimming ---
and I bought after reading Peter Lynch write in early '95 in Worth to avoid
because it was overvalued. HA! Half the fun is seeing him wrong -g-). Starting
this week a new small position in HOT (Starwood Hotels & Resorts - an
aggressive gorilla in the hotel business.)

It would seem to me that people who want to invest in the stock market to make
reasonable profits or very good profits, would want to develop some methodology
around which to operate. Given that most --all-- successful investors seem to
be people who invest over a long period of time -- many years or decades, there
should be some framework or guiding principles developed and repeated (with
occasional tweaking) over this long timeframe. To me, internet "investing" -
either by the general public or by insiders who have secured millions of shares
of stock-- that is not a long term strategy because there is not a repeatable
methodology with it. (Well, maybe a few entrepreneurs can repeat their success,
and maybe a few investors can play fads over and over again-- that's rare and
not practical for the rest of us.) Of course for those people who have "taken a
shot" and made a couple of million or the several insiders with $billion in
profits - they could care less if it's repeatable or a viable method because
they've secured brass ring. That's good for them, but I say this is not the way
for most investors to optimize their risks/rewards and secure a profitable
future. Of course in looking back... I'd rather be with them for a couple of
thousand shares of AOL (at last year's low price), than any of the more than 20
problem stocks I've got now -g-. However, the game for us value investors is
not yet over - or so I keep telling myself. And sometimes I actually believe
it.

FWIW. Paul.

take heart Paul...here's a little history lesson from Mr. kaplan:

"OVERVALUATION, EVERYONE?--The price-to-earnings ratio of the Standard and
Poor's 500 Stock Index (average
stock price divided by average earnings per share) rose above 29.5 in the late
afternoon on Wednesday, July 8,
1998, a new all-time record, according to Dow Jones News. For comparison with a
bear market bottom, this
value averaged 5.9 in the second quarter of 1949."http://www.investor1.com/gmo/

Re: NH, James thanks for the post. I am very much bullish on NH.
It has churned twelve times its daily volume in the last two days
without significant movement. There were some smart buyers among
the panic sellers no doubt. I'm holding it and forgetting it, and
will average down when and if it falls to 2/3 my purchase price.

Thanks, Paul, I meant to ask you about OLS (believe me, no slam intended)
specifically.
I recently figured this out, based on a YHOO price of $200.
YHOO market cap 8.6 bil.
FDX (Fed Ex) market cap 9 bil. FDX moves the products which are sold over the
internet.
BAY (Bay Networks) market cap 7.3 bil. Supplies hardware products for the
internet. To be taken over by Northern Telecom.
NUE (Nucor Corp.) market cap approx. 4.5 bil. Largest steel minimill in the
country.
Ridiculous. BTW I am looking at FDX and NUE now. At least there is a relative
margin of safety and sanity here. But, I've been wrong before!. Lately, more
wrong than right!
Good luck all value investors.

Jim,

Thanks for your insight into NH. I was quite happy that this recent press
release didn't "talk down" the stock like past quarterly releases seem to have.
I was glad that the PR focused on NH's growth opportunities.

Another reason for DE trading at a higher P/E than NH is due to its revenue
composition. Last quarter, DE got 78% of its revenue from North America and was
able to grow these revenues at 21%. It's non-North American revenue was
actually down 1% last quarter. Contrast that to NH - 54% outside North America
showing a year-to-year decline of 10%. The finance operations of Deere are also
significantly larger portion of revenue. And, since I have received letters
from J. Deere Credit offering lines of credit, I suspect that the finance
operations of DE are significantly more diverse that NH. On a region-to-region
or segment-to-segment comparison, NH compares very well to DE, its just the mix
of regions and segments that are causing the problems.

Of course, the regions showing growth will also change from year-to-year. NH's
finance operations will grow up. As you say, don't know when it will happen,
but it will happen. If you ask me which one's outlook is brighter, I think it
is NH.

Today JP Morgan downgraded the agriculture equipment sector. Deere and Case
were down about 5%. New Holland held up pretty well. That tells me we're
bottoming here. There has been a lot of panic selling in New Holland.

James: I keep thinking these ag co. stocks should sell at low multiples --
that's been their history after all. I've gone back to look at NH because I
intend to show you that a good case (no pun intended -g-) can be made that it
is STILL overvalued. But I give up--- it does look undervalued to me based on
the way I'm looking at past/present numbers and ratios. Not sure I understand
why there'd now be "panic selling" in this stock (esp. as I also view analyst
downgrades now as showing us where a bottom might be); but as you say, it may
be a very good entre point now for value investors. I am sticking with my pick
of RDO- I still prefer a distributor (esp. of the caliber I think I'm getting
)--drawback or positive though is that it's solely US sales based-, who is in
more than one market (construction as well as ag.). JMO, Paul.

I'd want NH precisely because of its emerging market exposure.
It continues to expand and remains tremendously profitable even
through this trouble. When the trouble ends, NH should benefit.
It is aggressively expanding its finance arm - with success.
I just don't see a signficant downside in the cheapest stock in
one of the cheapest market segments.

They have a great informational web site:
http://www.newholland.com/nh/press_f.htm

Oh well. Honestly, I'm bearish about all sorts of things, but
I'm having no trouble looking around and lusting after stocks
here and there and wishing I could buy more of the ones I already own,
which are down about 4% in the last two months.

Thanks Paul. One of the best tests of a value investment is when an astute
investor goes in trying to make a sell case and ends up buying the stock.
You're not there yet, but it sounds like you're a lot closer than you were this
morning.

For those of you who like investment books, David Dreman's Contrarian
Investment Strategies is pretty good. He's not the best writer in the world,
but he presents some interesting statistics and viewpoints about how silly
forecasting can be. This is a pretty dense read, but its probably something a
scholarly value investor can take something out of - it addresses the issue of
value investing in the "modern" market (essentially he says just do what worked
for the last 50 years).

Mike, my problem with value stocks is that they have been the wrong stocks for
this market and I am fearful with the Internet craze,
valuations generally, etc., that we are so close to the end of this bull market
that they are also the wrong stocks now (versus cash).
If we have a crack in the ridiculously overpriced sectors, can value stocks
bought now give you a positive return? I doubt it. I have too many value stocks
I am down on and really think cash is the better choice now.
