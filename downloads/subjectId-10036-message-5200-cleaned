Actually, most of the stocks that I made such a good amount of money off of
recently are the ones in which I averaged down aggressively. Deswell I've held
since last fall at over 20, and came out well ahead thanks to confidence in my
fundamental value-oriented analysis. New Holland got a huge dollop of my
capital when it went to 9 1/2, after having first bought it at 23. Asyst got
double my original investment when it fell to 6 1/8. Tidewater got a doubling
of my money at 17 1/2. And I just doubled down into Midway at 9 1/4. What sort
of world indeed? I know fundamental analysis, and I know my version of value,
and I still make no excuses for moving in and out of positions with frequency -
Paul and I have had this argument before. To each his own, though it may offend
purist sensibilities. Certainly Graham didn't require long-term holding periods
- holding for 2 years was a failure of sorts.

I suppose the ag equips are reacting to New Holland's guidance. I still love
the sector, just hoping to get it even cheaper. IMO stocks don't typically make
a single low and then reverse course. Usually there's some bouncing along the

I admire your timing but i don't get your reasoning; if you liked Deswell at
20, why don't you like it more at 12? And if you like a 5% real rate of return,
Dswell is around 25% return on enterprise value, should their profits drop by
50% that would still leave a 12.5% return and of course they have no debt and a
significant cash cushion. I liked Deswell at 18 and also added to it at lower
levels. I just can't see a reason to sell it until it becomes too big a part of
my portfolio

For what it's worth, there may be opportunities in stocks with leaps which can
be sold against the stock for possible long term gains and with reduced risk.
An example is madge systems(MADGF) which is currently trading at 3 3/8. Net of
the year 2001 call(strike 5) my net cost for this stock is 1.875. I believe the
company with over 3 dollars cash will survive and hopefully be above 5 in 27
months. If so the annualized return will be almost 60%. Normally I write ratios
of nearer term(3-4 month) out of the money calls but I am cautious because of
the possibility of a secular bear market. I have used this strategy many times
in the past for 1- 1 1/2 year options(KM,UIS,DEC) Of course the great bull
market would have made outright purchases many times better. But the point is
that if you are very very nervous about the market there are alternative
strategies which significantly reduce risk but still offer reasonable
expectations.

Here's some of what I've been doing. If this gives anybody any ideas --good. If
anybody's got any ideas to help me-- good too.

Trimming stuff: ABT, for example. Stock just keeps going up, and I just keep
peeling off shares. I don't know whether to congratulate myself or kick myself.
Got the same feeling regarding SUNW, some others which I've been taking profits
on. I'm just getting scared - and scared out, I think.

Starting to buy: TMO. Can't seem to get what I want at my price though. Buying
a little earlier this week. TMO is the mother company of all the Thermo
spinoffs. Now they think they've got too many of these kids (30+?), and are
going to bring some back in. So there's some concern about how this is all
going to play out. But sales keep growing, the pe and some other measures are
low historically (or were). So I've stepped in to buy. I will probably
reluctantly step up and buy more.

Starting to buy SPF: Standard Pacific builds homes in the California market,
and business is good. I looked at other home builders (BZH for example --
mentioned on this thread before), but SPF just looks more attractive to me.
Homebuilding stocks have been moving up, SPF is lagging; I don't think it
deserves to.

Adding to position: MMI. Apparently they've announced a loss for the quarter.
Stock is down about 3 to 15+, its year lows. Reasonable dividend and below book
value. They are a medical malpractice insurer. As long as our favorite doctors
don't turn into day traders, there's probably still a market (albeit
competitive market) for their insurance business. Stock has had its earnings
ups and downs. I'll bet they'll come through this too. (It will take 12 months
maybe.)

Starting a new position: BUNS. Now this is a vaguely kinda/sorta company like
the restaurant biz. that Warren Buffett bought last year. That is, they make a
lot of their money from the franchising end. (Although they don't have have
moat protection of the ubiquitous small town locations that the Dairy Queens
have) Selling near book value, with no LT debt, rising sales-- BUNS is a
company that announced a not-so-great quarter also. So what, I say -g-. The
stock is a buy here.

Well, for what it's worth.... Paul.

Paul,

Starting to buy SPF: Standard Pacific 

A company in the manufactured home business that I find attractive is Champion
Enterprises, CHB. It's more expensive on a book value basis than SPF or BZH,
but you get a better ROE, and the book value for CHB is growing more rapidly,
PE for each is about the same.

On a lighter note: the name Standard Pacific brings back bad memories of a
recent stock price implosion I suffered through in Southern Pacific Funding.

If you have an opinion on CHB I'd be interested to hear.

Some comments Paul.

All the homebuilders are doing poorly in the market, anticipating a poorer
economic environment to come here. If it does not occur you will probably do
well.

On TMO, I know a great deal about this "family", having followed it for 15+
years. You might want to read my (critical) posts on it on THI on Yahoo. I am
much less enthusiastic now. The company's operating income performance, without
gains from subsidiary stock sales and using something more reasonable than 40
years(!) to amortize huge amounts of good will would be much, much less
impressive.

In my opinion, they were fabulous at financial engineering. But how could you
lose if the price you paid for any acquisition did not really matter because
the resulting good will was amortized over a period so long, and your financial
engineering allowed you to raise capital very cheaply by selling high P/E
stock. They were less good at running businesses as has recently become
apparent with the financial gains disappearing and many subsidiaries taking
charges to restructure operations.

I estimate that reported earnings would be about 25% lower if goodwill
were amortized over a period 1/3 as long as the 40 years used.

In sum I once thought this was a great company. I don't any more.

That's an interesting point of view on goodwill. I take exactly the opposite
position on this accounting question. In most cases, I add goodwill back to
earnings, thus ignoring it completely. You on the other hand think goodwill
amortization is understated. My rationale is that if a company paid a fair
price for an acquisition, amortization has zero economic meaning. And if they
overpaid, then write it off all at once, not over 40 years. Goodwill
amortization is one of my pet peeves. Why do you think it matters so much?

Jim. I'll have to think about this. I do think that if a company paid a fair
price for a company, then good will is a realistic component of book value -
because if the acquiring company had to sell the acquisition, a new buyer would
be willing also to pay for the good will component. I also assume -- have no
facts to support this though-- that most transactions among 100M publicly
traded companies involve the payment for goodwill component. Acquisitions
aren't made for net book value of the acquired company (unless the acquired
company is distressed). The issue maybe involves "fair" price. If the acquirer
wildly overpays, then book value obviously is that much more distorted.
I am so used to assuming earnings are overstated and hyped by companies, that I
just automatically look for ways to subtract stuff from "their" reported
numbers. But I am wrong. Maybe too much automatic instead of thinking about it.
As a value investor, I should be trying to get the intrinsic earnings value -
and that may mean adding back into earnings. I'll have to think about it some
more.

re: goodwill
Paul, you've got it. But maybe this is worth expanding on a little because it
is a big deal for many companies. Lets use a real example.

When Disney acquired Cap Cities/ABC, they paid $18 billion over book value. I'm
not interested in whether they overpaid or not, but it should be obvious that
the franchise of ABC is worth more than its book value, signficantly more. Now
Disney has an $18 billion asset on its balance sheet called goodwill. It takes
a charge to earnings to amortize that goodwill over 40 years, so there is an
expense of almost $500 million a year for amortization.

Lets think about that. Its a big number, about 23 cents a share. Without that
charge, Disney trades at 22x earnings. With the charge, it trades at about 28x.
Big number.

Now what is it? The way I look at it is this. If Disney had not acquired Cap
Cities/ABC, that expense would clearly not exist on Disney's income statement.
But it is equally clear that it would not exist on ABC's income statement
either. So where did it come from? The only economic rationale is that the
asset on the balance sheet (which also would not exist anywhere but for the
acquisition) is depreciating in value. Is that reasonable? ABC's franchise may
indeed be diminishing in value, but the accounting would be the same even if
the FCC outlawed cable television tomorrow. The point is that the charge has
nothing to do with economic reality, it is a non-cash expense, and it distorts
earnings downward. In this case, I would add it back to earnings and base my
P/E analysis on that figure.

If you believe this argument, you will be surprised how many companies you find
that are much cheaper than they look. Sometimes the market recognizes this, but
in my experience I find I can buy real bargains because of this accounting
noise which distorts true earning power.

Very interesting rationale; thanks.

If I understand you correctly, adding the amortization expense back to earnings
results in a lower "P/E." The higher the goodwill amortization expense, the
lower the "P/E." Therefore, the lowest "P/E" would would result from the
highest goodwill. In other words, the more the company overpaid for its
acquisition, the better its "P/E" will be.

How do you address the issue of goodwill being much larger than the true value?

If a company overpaid for an acquisition, that's probably going to show up in

Not at all. There are plenty of industrial and manufacturing companies with
franshise value well in excess of book. Caterpillar, Deere, Dover, Danaher,
Intel...

But that wasn't my argument. If you believe a company overpaid for an
acquisition, then by all means zero out the goodwill on the balance sheet. But
that has nothing to do with the income statement, and has nothing to do with my
argument.

If the company is earning a dollar in cash, I'll value that dollar the same way
regardless of its history. I am not talking about the balance sheet, I am
talking about cash flow, which is how I value companies.

Goodwill amortization is a non-cash expense. So is depreciation. What I am
arguing is that goodwill amortization is a non-economic expense as well.
Depreciation is a real expense because depreciation of assets usually has to be
replaced by capital expenditures (cash). Of course ABC's (to go back to my old
example) franchise will depreciate without advertising and other cash expenses.
But those are already on the income statement. Goodwill amortization is
double-counting that expense.

Jim,

Don't you counter your own position?

"Goodwill is the amount paid above the BV" - Accepted.

Then you say, "Depreciation is a real expense because depreciation of assets
usually has to be replaced by capital expenditures (cash)"

Depreciation is the primary reduction on BV and if considered a 'real expense',
then how can you ignore 'Goodwill'?

I understand and agree with much of what you are saying about cash flow but
feel you paint with too broad a brush. IMO for value determination, the 'value'
and 'rate' of reduction on Goodwill must be considered as one considers the
rate on Depreciation. Each can be an overstated or understated expense.

Example: A company pays above BV for a software company that's carrying a large
R&D asset and sets up the Goodwill amortization over a 10 year period. In 10
years the software would likely be obsolete. I would write off both the
Goodwill and R&D assets and base forward value of the company purely on
anticipated operational cash.

The opposite: A company pays above BV for a manufacturing company with modern
equipment and facilities that they have been depreciating on a 3-5 year
schedule. One can assume that the facilities are worth far more than the BV and
that the Goodwill is justified. I would accept BV and base future value on BV
plus operational cash (adjusted to a realistic depreciation and amortization of
assets)

IMO 'Goodwill' is not something to be ignored and must be looked at carefully.

If it is true of a software company, as Jim agrees, why isn't it true of most
technology companies where the products are obsolete well before 10 years --
like chip companies for example?

This brings me back to TMO which started this discussion. That is largely a
technology-related company. For example its big instrument
subsidiary's products are surely obsolete long before 10 years. So why is a
goodwill amortization period of 40 years appropriate? (It would be so only if
no goodwill amortization is correct, and therefore the longest period allowable
should be used.)

I was told by a couple of CFOs that the IRS and company auditors don't like to
see capitalized software development resulting from work done by employees. If
companies decide to capitalize, the CFOs prefer that those costs come from work
done by outside contractors and consultants - abundant in the software
industry, but not so much in the semiconductor industry. It is somewhat of a
judgement call whether you should capitalize or expense these costs.

As far as amortizing capitalized software development costs, I believe that
most companies use a period of less than 30/40 years. I believe 5 years is
typical. Of course, the period should be the useful life of the project or
technology.

Jeff, regarding the goodwill on TMO. Any acquirer who would buy the whole thing
isn't going to calculate the earnings AFTER deducting amortization charges be
they 40 year or 10. He is going to look at the PRE TAX cash flow, what's left
after real R & D, SG & A and maint cap ex. He then will try and figure out what
MULTIPLE of that figure will give him a decent return on his outlay, over time.
He will also look at the balance sheet for assets that could be sold off or
used to REDUCE his purchase price, dollar for dollar. Again, he will COMPLETELY
disregard the amortization charges because they don't effect his CASH return on
investment. You should do the same. If you want more conviction about it, take

That is the way I handle it and for exactly the reasons you describe.

To be honest, some of these accounting and valuation issues can get extremely
complex. After 2 years of trying to persuade Reynolds Russell of GADR that you
should crunch numbers to death, I am starting to come around to his point of
view. Absent any extremes, there are advantages to simplicity. If you build in
some margin of safety, calculating the number of years that goodwill should
really be amortized at (and other such things) buys you very little except less
time. If it's that close, maybe you shouldn't make the investment.
There seems to be numerous flaws/questionable rules in GAAP accounting and
maybe we're better off just insisting on margin of safety.

Jim,

I'm trying to learn from your goodwill post, using your specific example of
Disney.

I'm posting the information the way I'm understanding it, and was hoping you
or others on the thread would tell me if I'm adjusting things in the correct
way.

I've grabbed the most recent 10Q I could find on Edgar (June 98)for Disney and
posted Income Stmt, balance sheet, and Stmt of Cash flow at the bottom of this
message.

If I'm understanding you correctly, to correct for goodwill accounting I should
take the $321 million goodwill amortization for the 9 months of 98, and add it
back to earnings. So earnings would be $1,875 vs the stated $1,554. This
increases EPS from the stated $0.75 diluted to $0.90 diluted for the 9 months.

You also mention backing the goodwill out of the balance sheet. How would
this be done? Would you back it solely out of liabilities or would equity be
impacted at all? I'm thinking in terms of impact on book value if any.

I apologize for my ignorance if this is an obvious question, but I'm trying to
make sure I understand this.

Thanks for any comments,

Shane

Apparently SEC is looking at the R&D/goodwill writeoff issue as well.

http://www.mercurycenter.com/business/top/047327.htm

"Feds looking hard at R&D write-offs ... The Securities and Exchange Commission
is clamping down on an accounting technique that's central to the way Silicon
Valley companies make acquisitions. ... At issue is the write-off of so-called
''in-process'' research and development expenses. The technique allows
acquiring companies to take an upfront charge to their earnings for the value
of the target company's technology. Without the charge-off, companies must
account for a portion of the acquisition over a longer period of time, a
practice that diminishes earnings -- and, importantly, a company's
public-market valuation -- for quarters to come."

The U.S. Dollar and the German Mark - Greenspan

In Alan Greenspan's talk this afternoon he spoke about currencies. At one point
he classified the U.S dollar and German Mark as seasoned well established
currencies of comparable high quality.

I disagree strongly. Take current events for example.

In the crisis several weeks ago the German banks took a much more serious
monetary hit than the U.S banks. They also have much greater exposure to Russia
and some emerging markets. The German economy is also presently suffering from
significant unemployment. Yet despite that, the Bundesbank has yet to drop
interest rate even though much of Europe already has. This is how a real
currency to managed. Price stability and currency value is the most important
thing.

On the other hand, at the first sign of trouble, the U.S. Federal Reserve
lowered interest rates. Not once, but twice. Anything to prop up the system and
excesses.

This is partly why the U.S is the greatest debtor in history. This is partly
why we have a large and growing trade and current account deficit. We are
constantly flooding the system with money at any sign of trouble and as a
result we are flooding the world with Dollars and IOUs.

For now the U.S. dollar maintains it value for several reasons.

1. ILLusion
2. Delusion
3. There are not enough of German Marks or Swiss Franks to be the reserve
currency.
4. Governments have effectively demonetized gold for now.

I got my flu shot but it didn't keep me from catching the greed bug-
I am way too anxious to commit funds to capture benefits of the rising market.
That's often been a scary time for me.

Also, a corollary is that I'm furious with myself for missing easy and quick
profit runnups -- Lyondell from 16 to 22, Aetna from 66 to 80, Cooper Vision
from way under 20 to over 27, and many others --- daily march upward - almost
straight up. Which of course builds on the feeling that it's a heck of a lot
better to just buy something than be in cash -- this is the time to be making
money. Especially with so many -- maybe almost everything - moving higher.

One switch I am noticing is that it seems that with many/most of the stocks I
am watching, if the company now announces unexpected bad earnings, the stock
doesn't get hammered as it seemed to midyear through early Oct. Some companies
even rally -- as was the case with many companies before the June/July market
breakdown.

Right now, I am finding it hard to step up and find stocks I like at prices I
will pay.

I am looking at the health care sector because it's out of favor and because
there's maybe a fear that with more Dems in Congress, Pres. Clinton will push
for and maybe get, healthcare legislation/reform. So far, I've added to my
position in SHG (p/bv = .78, psr= .12) and initiated a position in GHV (p/bv =
.64, psr = .32). As the population ages, the demand for eldercare services
should increase. And somewhere along the line, maybe the prices of these
provider companies will too.

Today I've gone back and bought more of Mike B's recommended MWY. Seems like
insiders are increasing their buying, so I have too. It's a risky company IMO-
big profits depend on hits-- and, like the movie biz., that is often random.
Plus, there are a lot of these kinds of companies out there. Still, we have a
pe of 8 (assuming they can maintain earnings), a large number (several hundred)
probably very good technical people, and Sumner Redstone controls the business.
This stock has not moved up (from its lows) in the current market-- but it
could.

I've also started a tiny position in Catellus Development (CDX)this week. They
are big property owners and developers in California. Stock's up about a $1
from my buy point. Chose CDX after I noticed good 'ole JOE starting to move.
(And it was from 20 to 26 and I missed it yet again!) These real estate
companies were mentioned by fund manager Leon Cooperman in Barron's about 2
weeks ago.

I've also added Tue. to my position in Schlotzsky's (symbol BUNZ -- I notice it
was incorrectly reported by me as BUNS in my first mention of it). Given the
price near book, the reasonable-for-this-market pe, the repeating stream of
earnings from being a franchisor, the apparent popularity of the food (my
subjective and unqualified opinion), and my guess that they can replicate their
model, plus there's no on-the-books long term debt-- I think it's worth it to
increase my bet on the expectation that the stock will move up from current
lows.

exactly why it is down, and it hasn't participated at all in this greater

Some suggestions:

Solid undiscovered companies (microcap):

ADMS, Advanced Marketing Services --- distributes books to
superstores like WalMart and KMart. Average annual earnings
growth of 40% over past 5 years. P/B=1.2, P/S=.21, P/E=10,
no debt, small dividend, not much coverage.

CUO, Construction Material Corp --- construction company and
also sells air conditioning unit. P/B=1.03, P/S=0.33, P/E=8.
Don't have earnings growth on past 5 years, but stock has
tripled in that time. No analyst coverage that I know of
(at least not on Zacks or Yahoo).

Speculative microcaps:

Michael Anthony Jewelers --- manufactures and sells gold
jewelry. P/B=0.47, P/S=0.15, P/E negative, Insider buying.
Has been a dog for quite awhile, but severely undervalued
(book value appears legit, esp. with write-down earlier
this year) and should show positive earnings this year.

Movie Gallery --- movie rental store. P/B=0.45, P/S=0.25, P/E
negative, stock buyback. However, much of book value is goodwill,
and they just announced a write-down and new depreciation
schedule. Nevertheless, cash flow (EBITDA) is solid, 5.6
million for last QUARTER on a market cap of 68.8 million
(does not take into account replacement value of buying new
videos). Debt is high (0.39 of equity).

Battered smallcaps with cash:

BOSS, RAIN, GIBG --- all priced below book value, huge amounts
of cash, significant positive cash flow, low debt. (RAIN and
GIBG were growth stocks turned value due to earnings
disappointments.)

Some larger caps and cyclicals I have had success with recently:

LEH, RTNA, RN, YELL.

Some larger caps and cyclicals I had my eye on:

JPM, CCK, CSE.

The valuations are not as compelling as for the smallcap stocks,
but I am looking for a little diversity, esp. since until recently
large caps have outperformed.

Ron,

Thank you for your comment, I think you make a very good point ---
earnings growth is important. I will try to address it.

I would prefer to see earnings growth, but the strategy is
to buy ugly, beaten-down stocks for 3-5yrs until they become
fairly valued. I have found that adding too much growth
factors into the mix has gotten me into some trouble.
(e.g. It lead me to companies like Boston Market that were
cheap by all measure because they were fraudulent.)

If my screen includes tech stocks, so be it. Note that earnings
growth estimates for tech stocks does not always help --- it did
not save those people who invested in disk drives or semiconductors
in the past year or two due to low PE and high growth. Even in
other industries (e.g. oil service stocks), the earnings growth
numbers seem to lag reality by quite a few months.

However, perhaps I should have mentioned that for all of these
types of value stocks, one should always figure out the reasons
why they are so cheap and make sure he/she is comfortable with
these reasons.

Also, I believe a screen based on PE/Growth and relative strength
can lead to good growth stock portfolio, but it requires a fair
amount of trading and monitoring of your positions.

Does anyone have an opinion on MGIC (symbol: MTG).

Stock is up from its 1998 lows (what isn't?) but trading down quite bit from
its high.

It has a pe of 13.

My tables on MGIC go back to 1992. Looks like every year there's been an
increase in revenue and a corresponding 6 years of increasing earnings.

Isn't this a business that MGIC has pretty much either a lock on or dominates?
And a business - insurance - that is required for most people who are buying
homes?

I would think that MGIC would trade at a higher multiple than 13X. However, it
traded on average roughly between 12-14 back in '92 through '93, according to
my table. And its price to book (now about 2.9) was between 2.3-2.5 in '92-94.
So maybe the stock isn't undervalued. But yet those earnings/revs are moving
up... and so has the stock price - from under 10 in '92 to over 70 this year.

My questions would be: is this company fairly valued now or is it still too
expensive- by a value investor's criteria? Or are we talking about a growth
stock here? And if so, is it a reasonable buy now given past growth and based
on criteria a growth investor would use? Or maybe it is a GARP stock? (I do not
own this stock; if you were to buy it what would be your ruling reasons?) Paul

I do not understand what you mean. If you mean growing earnings

If you mean high forecast short-term earnings growth means high

McSweet: I try never to predict earnings or use analysts' estimates of future

earnings is up. (I define a trend as 7 points in the same direction.)

I believe we all define value a little differently. Nevertheless, I'll guess
that not many people here on the value thread think that Mr. Buffett is a value
investor as they define value investing. (Maybe he once was, but not now.)

To me, buying a company below some level of its intrinsic value (evaluated by
using p/bv or psr company history or industry comps, and some other measures)--
that is certainly is a form of value investing.

I do not require increases in revenue to be the driver to get to higher stock
prices in all cases. For example, some investment categories that are generally
considered 'value investments'-- net-nets, hidden assets, and temporarily
depressed prices -- do not require 'growth in revenue' to be 'relied on
foremost'

I have some general thoughts about MI (mortgage insurance)companies....I am a
residential mortgage loan originator for a major bank in Florida and my
thoughts come from that perspective, not from having done any analysis
whatsoever on any of the MI companies (like MGIC).

The growing trend in the mortgage industry seems to be away from those loans in
which MI is required. There are many different loan products that offer a
combined package of a 1st mortgage that doesn't exceed 80%(the threshold over
which MI is required)and a 2nd mortgage of 10 or 15%(and, increasingly, up to
20%). These packages are specifically designed to avoid the customer needing to
have mortgage insurance. So there is a major erosion of the base of business
going on here.

On the positive side, some MI companies, and I think MGIC is one, are offering
other types of service to the mortgage industry to offset the loss in revenues.
Contract loan processing and underwriting comes to mind. I don't think that
these other types of services are nearly as profitable as the MI business they
replace, but I haven't looked at the numbers. The problem with the alternative
sources of revenues is that they would dry up a lot faster if the mortgage
volume drops off, because lenders would have in-house staff do the processing
and underwriting.

nope- not a buffet tenet and all good growth/value investors absolutely do NOT
rely on this formula.

This statement might be true: "growth in revenue + growth in earnings = growth
in eps." But it certainly is NOT a formula for share price appreciation. What
you are missing is dilution. I could grow my earnings a lot if I have a boat
load of new capital from shareholders to invest as I see fit. Just putting it
in the bank would add to EPS. The question for shareholders and management is
"what return can you deliver on the money I give you?" The answer to THAT
question might either be a formula for share price appreciation—or
depreciation.

I agree that Buffet was probably a value investor, especially
since everyone says he is/was. As of today, he appears to
be a combination of growth and value, since everyone agrees
that KO is not a value stock, and it is a substantial part of
his portfolio. (I am not saying that KO is not a potentially
undervalued stock, just not a value stock.)

My value stock ideals are Price, Dreman, and Graham.

As far as my misinterpretation of your comments go, I was trying
to interpret them in the context of my screening strategy. Ron
Bower offered a solid criticism my strategy, and I assumed you
were offering a follow-up critique. If so, then I may have
missed your point, because even though earnings growth is the
eventual driver behind stock price, I do not see the necessity
of adding in PE/(predicted growth rate)into a value screen.

More on Buffett as not a value investor:

Of course every investor who buys a stock thinks he/she is getting a good value
for his/her money. But if we categorize purchases by growth vs. value, then
Buffett neither buys popular growth stocks nor deeply-discounted Ben Graham
stuff.

IMO, Mr. Buffett is not a value investor because - in contrast to Ben Graham--

1) Buffett does not buy (from what I can see) undervalued and sell at full
value.
(KO, G, AXP, WXP, DIS, FNM, MCD --- all high pe and high p/bv IMO)

2) Emphasizes income statement over balance sheet.
"Your goal as an investor should simply be to purchase, at a rational price, a
part interest in an easily understandable business whose earnings are virtually
certain to be materially higher five, ten, and 20 years from now." Buffett
quote. This is not classic value investing! Even if it does work out fabulously
well.

The article

is dated March 1997. Equities are up substantially
from that time. Greenspan has done an excellent
job managing interest rates.

With interest rates so low, equities deserve a higher
PE. Stocks are still probably overvalued, but there
are lots of undervalued smallcap stocks around. By
buying value stocks (staying away from Internet stocks!)

If, the feds lower rates again next Tuesday, which I feel they will then we
enter into another world of economics that we have not experienced in

Now a few if's. If the economy goes into recession. If the stock market reacts
negatively. What do we do for an encore. Monetary policy alone will not pull us
out of a recession. We will not have a federal government willing to deficit
spend us out of recession. We will not see the Congress give us a whopping tax
cut to pull us out, because of the argument we need to save social security.

Then as we sink deeper and deeper credit parameters will tighten to the extent
that we will be in big trouble. So we are walking a tightrope.

I think this is an excellent suggestion as a value stock.
If it were in the US, and we knew a little more about the
management it would be a definite buy.

Unfortunately, it is based in Hong Kong where
(a) accounting standards and management accountability
are a lot less strict
(b) there are currency risks and risks of intervention
from the Chinese government
(c) we have the general overall Asian crisis

That being said, management appears to be taking all
the correct steps. (The story about Sunbeam seems reasonable,
since Sunbeam is having major problems.) It does not
seem wise to build plants right now when demand is
weakening. It appears that the company has lots of US cash
and no debt, which is heartening in terms of potential currency
devaluations.

If someone could get some more info on this company (esp.
management), I would view it as a good potential high-risk
buy. Not something to bet the farm on, but appropriate for
a small part of a portfolio. I just wish we knew more
about the company.

I've been out of touch for a while, but I'm with Mike. Unlike Mike, I sold
almost everything near the top in May-July. But also unlike Mike, I sat on my
hands while he called the bottom and bet huge on his call. So we probably came
out even. Both up single digits for the year.

But I agree with him now. This market is in my opinion MORE speculative than it
was before. Because now we KNOW that earnings are in decline. Check out those
internet stocks today. That was my sell signal in the summer. Like I said then,
the market will be a value buyer's market when Amazon trades in single digits.
But on the other hand, unlike the peak five months ago, there is some breadth
now. Value stocks are going up too. Small stocks are going up, although what I
look at is sputtering now, while the Dells and Amazons are starting to fly
again. Deja vous all over again? In my view, this is the final gasp of this
bull market and possibly one of the great bear market selling opportunities in
market history. The numbers support the valuations even less than they did in
July, because at that point earnings might decline, but now they are declining.
How the %$&* can you pay 25x a declining earnings stream for the S&P? I don't
care what interest rates are.

But I did put my cash to work. On Sunday I bought my dream house with the money
I took out of the market in the spring and summer. That'll keep me disciplined.
Nothing like having no money to keep you from buying stocks. I figured if I can
buy a house now at 7% interest rates, do it. Maybe it will interest people
which stocks I actually own now after the big sell. I have my name associated
with a lot of stocks I no longer own
ABK, CMH, LHO, USU, NH. That's it. Down payments on houses suck. But I really
don't think I'm missing any big opportunity now. Taking a mortgage at a 7%
interest rate is some form of a value investment in my view. Anybody willing to
put up money on a side bet that I will get a shot to buy stocks with the S&P at
750 or lower within the next three years?

I;ve been on vacation for a while and I don't have time to restate Shane's
post, which is worth reading again.

But the answer to his question, is in my interpretation, that is exactly what
you do with Disney earnings - add back amortization. And if you're taking it
out of the income statement, you've got to take it out of the balance sheet.
Drop goodwill, taking it out of equity, then calculate ROE based on that, if
ROE is your thing. If the conclusion looks aggressive, go back and read what
Buffett wrote in his annual reports about Cap Cities/ABC.

Take Philip Morris as an example. If you removed goodwill, I believe equity is
pretty darned close to negative. What that tells me is that book equity is not

Joe, thanks again for keeping us updated on interesting articles.

This one you linked to I found very interesting and informative:

I like that Glassman says that Hulbert says that almost all newsletter writers
have failed to beat the Wilshire 5000 over time.

Also there are some very interesting value stocks mentioned -- interesting to
me anyway, since a number of them have already been discussed on this thread
(and so possibly already owned by some of us - deBeers, Brunswick, KLM, Sea
Containers, others)

One company mentioned in the article, but not brought to this thread before was
Fleming. I'll look at FLM a little closer: seems like it always trades far
below book value, but now, at about 10-11, it's at a 10 year low. Maybe this
dull, 2nd tier food distributor should sell at a low price, but at .03 psr (per
Yahoo), that does seem low indeed.

Thanks. Paul

Well James I may be in trouble, once again I disagree with you and am fully
invested. I agree that the nifty fifty is frothy. But the entire universe below
that is looking awfully cheap to me in relative terms, ESpecially stuff like
Deswell and the semiconductor stocks many are close to cash or book. All the
energy and oil drillers are cheap historically, the natural resource stocks,
many of the small caps. There is optimism for a recovery in Asia and that will
lift the tech stocks as they move into a new cycle. Lastly the Macro factors
have shifted. With the dollar decline and increase in yields, buying long term
bonds is no longer a can't lose proposition so there will be lots of money
moving back into equities. Also it is that tax shelter time of year so there
will be lots of money flowing into sundry IRA's and SEPs between now and APril.
My scenario is for a steady rise in the market until April, at which point we
may see declines. JMHO.

I also agree with you about the internet stocks, Netscape excepted. I don't see
how the cash flow generated could possibly justify even half of most of these
prices, but they make excellent trading vehicles. It seems to be similar to
those y2K stocks but with longer legs.
BTW Is the market drops precipitously I would not expect real estate prices to
hold up, especially in the NY area.

No argument whatsoever - we don't disagree with your strategy to invest in deep
value stocks like Deswell. I bought that one at about 9 and sold it a bit early
at 12, but I figured 30% in a week...

But toward the tail end of that message you said the internet stocks are great
trading vehicles. Yeah, as long as they are going up. Do you have some edge to
tell me when that is. Or what piece of seemingly insignificant news (to guys
who own Deswell and New Holland at least) would drive the stocks down 25% in an
hour? Think risk. As Jimmy Rogers said it, "Look down before you look up" Thats
just my investment strategy - I am very conservative with investment principal,
which Ben Graham teaches is the first (and second) rule of investing. (The
first rule is don't lose money. The second rule is don't forget the first
rule.) The phrase "trading vehicle" has no more meaning to me than "slot

This strategy I don't understand. In two real estate markets I'm familiar with,
San Francisco and Chicago, prices of single family homes have exploded in the
last two years. The acceleration in Chicago, usually a very stable market, is
unlike any I've ever seen.
If you are forecasting a severe downturn in the stock market do you really
believe there will not be a corresponding downturn in highly leveraged single
family home prices?

Brendan/Jeffrey: re: MONY (symbol: MNY) I'm interested in this stock also ---
I'm always interested in insurance companies when they sell below book value.
Yahoo News for MNY offers an article about how these company conversions have
worked out well. (The bad news being that it often has taken time- sometimes
years). There also was a favorable article in the 11/1/98 NY Times if you have
access to it.

I'm disappointed the offering price, first estimated to be about $20, was
upped, and the stock initially began trading at 28. The good news, to me
anyway, is that stated book value is $35.58/sh. (per NYT article), so there's
still value and still opportunity.

What I don't like is that MONY, somewhere around now (I think), "plans to issue
34M shs to its 900,000 policyholders" (the conversion from mutual status). I
see that as a serious drag on the market price as policyholders cash in stock
for cash. In which case, maybe some patience and forbearance now might let
value investors pick this stock up at lower levels.

I bought in June at 13/16 and sold several months later at 1 5/8 because the

at a million a week clip. This latest news came out of the blue to me. Unless
the news release is outright fraud I cannot believe that the stock price will
remain in the 1.15-1.2 range. I am buying shares now as another speculation
that the company will re-establish itself as a viable entity and will file
appropriate SEC reports. Investor relations says the business plan is to
complete the audits and re apply for listing on some exchange(probably NASDAQ).

This is the first time in a while since I've stopped in at Value Investing.
There's a local company that I follow and invest in called OmniQuip
International (OMQP). Call it the Peter Lynch method, the city of Port
Washington is only about 10,000 people, and with OMQP a major employer in the
area, it's pretty hard not to know what's going on. I'm pleased with my results
so far (I've owned it about a year) but it's taken active risk management. With
a 52 week high of $26+ and a low of $8+, it's still reasonable at
$11-$12/share.

The fundamentals are discussed in the expanded version of Value Line. Right now
it's showing a P/E of about 6 while growing at a very respectable rate. Last
year they had a couple of large acquisitions which have taken a bit of time to
digest. It looks like they are on track again now.

Their business is tied to residential and commercial construction in that they
make off-road utility vehicles such as telescopic cranes, work platforms and
small front end loaders. Most of their business at this time is domestic US, so
overseas doesn't affect them. They have plans to expand overseas some time in
the future as they continue to grow.

Just thought some of you might have some interest in this small manufacturer.
If you look at the growth rate vs the P/E, I think you'll agree this is good
value for investing.

Brendan: re STAR and LDRY. Thanks. Your post very helpful to me.

I'll turn away from STAR. Many of the financials look okay to me, although it
does seem like they are being trounced by Outback (OSSI). The niche is
mid-price steak restaurants. Seems like a market already well served.

LDRY also has some pretty good numbers I see. Their ROE isn't as good (as
STAR), but it looks okay to me for a restaurant chain. Both stocks show book
value at about $14 with no or minimal LTD, and both stocks are selling for
about 7 1/2 - 8.

I found that LDRY is the number two seafood chain (after Red Lobster)in terms
of number of restaurants. I suspect (but have no facts), that the seafood
business is a more difficult concept to execute than steaks (importance of
freshness of product,spoilage control, being able to properly cook the fish vs
just grilling a steak), so maybe the barriers to entry are tougher too. I'll
look more closely at LDRY.

Thanks again. Paul.

G'day Paul (in the spirit of OSSI!)
I was in the restaurant business, and suspect that the LDRY concept is only
marginally more difficult to execute than STAR. I like LDRY better, as well:
competition (primarily Red Lobster) seems less severe, they have been pummeled
by serious bad weather in a lot of their markets.
I like the risk/reward better with LDRY.
Anyone else looked at or followed Wellman (WLM) - price to book is very low,
and financials are pretty good. Fortunately, I can say I owned it, and made a
profit, at much higher prices (in the 20s). Best could be described as a
specialty chemical manufacturer.

In the past couple of weeks,I've added to my position in BUNZ (as I've posted),
and today I'll try to add a little to my position in DANB. DANB is not a value
stock, but I like their business model,the great business they seem to be
having, and the word-of-mouth publicity I keep hearing from people who've gone
there. I also looked at CAKE - a great concept, very, very popular chain, but
price (to value)is too high for me.

Yes, I looked at ROAC after you (?) mentioned it here, but passed. Several
investment firms reported buying it at lower prices than current. Maybe around
current price they'll begin selling pressure. I'll check into WLMN.

Paul, I don't think STAR compares with the other steakhouses. I'm guessing
their Del Frisco concept is outstanding but it's also very high-end and is too
small now to really hit their bottom line. Their main business "Lone Star" has
a very heavy "country" flavor to it and has a very different clientele than the
competition. This is the business that has some great attributes but suffers
the problems as well.
