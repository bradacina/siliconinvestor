I continue to hold all shares of NSRGY.

I took on a few shares of utility RRI. Company has its problems. However, with
stock at less than 1/2 tangible bv, and p/sales at a relatively low .17, I can
wager a little on RRI as a reversion-to-mean play.

re RRI, AYE. I don't understand why this company has produced a seemingly
neverending string of screwups. I'll pass.

The way I see it AYE (and others) are a better bet. Wholesale power is risky
business , especially in a recession. AYE has issues with that too, but their
plants are better located (NE), they have a regulated business (utility, 50% of
earnings) and a focus on potentially lucrative transmission projects (currently
10% of earnings). All the wholesale power generators are as I see it a bet on
recovering NG prices (NG is mostly the swing producers source of energy).

Anyways, i added a few more shares to my position.AEP stock has done better
today though.

TDW (41.15$). A fill for a first few shares on TDW. Earnings apparently did not

Hi Spekulatius - How are you positioning your taxable portfolio in this
recession (slow recovery) environment? What is the general breakdown of your
holdings and are you holding a lot of cash (money market, bonds etc)?

You seem to be quick to take your gains and move to other opportunities which
might be the appropriate strategy in this fickle environment. Since March, I
have followed you into several of your utility picks which have performed quite
well. This group has held their gains and seem like a safe place to hide. Here
are some of my buys since March that I still hold but it's a bit discouraging
to have these one day hits strip me of my recent gains.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=ggb%20svu%20bkh%20swx%20cnp%20agl%20oge%20
rk%20nyb%20d%20lly%20trp%20hon%20si%20abb%20cop%20wmb%20pwe%20sfl

I have also positioned more bond & money market funds into REIT preferreds (5%)
but still hold the largest amount of my cash in Vanguard GNMA and credit union
accounts (16%), and a small amount in laddered Treasuries (2.5%). My total
Fixed Income is around 23.5%.

I am trying to set up the portfolio to generate income for the next 18 months
as I see this recovery to be quite slow in developing. Based on David Einhorn's
recent discussions, I am a bit concerned of a remote "Black Swan" type of
systemic event but not too sure how to defend against it. I have tried to focus
on core equity holdings that contain "real" natural resource assets that should
maintain their purchasing power in case of (1) debasing US $ or (2) super high
interest rate event in Japan or US. Therefore, 4% of the portfolio is invested
in gold and platinum mining stocks which is my insurance policy of hyper
inflation or depression. Even though gold is trading at an all time high, my
mining companies are still selling around 2002 levels (AU, GFI, AGPPY).

My biggest sector holding continues to be with the integrated Oil, NG &
Canadian Oil Trust companies (27%). The group generates an average annual 4%
dividend and has shown good overall growth over the last 20 years. However, as
oil prices bounce around, the portfolio's net value changes too.

Schwab recently prepared me a Sector Portfolio analysis report designed for
moderate safety & growth. The report said I owned too many small cap stocks and
is out of balance by 6% (which is comprised mainly of the smaller utility
companies listed above). My International Equity holdings is out of balance by
24% and comprises my largest positions in both Oil (PBR) & Canadian Oil Trusts
(ERF & PWE) and Mining ADR's (BHP AAUKY & AU). The report also said I needed to
own more Fixed Income (as high as 35% of the total).

The income generated by my taxable portfolio is what I use to live on. I need
consistent monthly & quarterly dividend streams that I use to pay my bills.
Monthly health care premiums now represent my largest expense (about 15% of the
portfolio income before taxes). I try to calculate the total amount (by month)
a year out based on the current payments announced by each company. I have
raised the taxable portfolio income payout from 3% to almost 6% (comprised of
qualified dividend income, non-qualified preferred dividends and interest
income).

That's the big picture overview of my set up. It's almost like managing my own
mutual fund. Your simple valuation observations has helped me a lot in
structuring my holdings. I appreciate your stock picking suggestions and think
your focus on the utility sector over the last 8 months has been right on.

What's on your radar screen for the next 18 months?

E_K_S I can't give a good breakdown on my portfolio right now but i do own
cluster of stocks around healthcare services (SUNH,SKH,MDTH,KND), utilities
(D,AEP,LG,AYE) a couple of small banks (too small to even mention here and I am
still accumulating). I have almost zero exposure to commodities or energy
(except some TDW), still own quite a bit of NSRGY and of course scattered other
stuff. besides that I now again sit on a huge chunk of cash 40-50% depending on
the portfolio.

I don't have much of a macro picture but I think we will see inflation in some
areas going forward. I think utilities are good and relatively cheap and a
decent place to be. Commmodities m might be even better but the trade look
tired and if wrong a lot of money can be lost in these stocks at current
levels. Another macro bet I am making is based on micro cap bank stocks with
decent credit metrics that look absurdly cheap to me. It is basically a bet on
the recovery in the credit market and commercial RE.

Overall I am taking profits as I can, which helped during the crazy days in Oct
2008-March 2009 but hurt me since then. I am not complaining though. I try to
use the market volatility to my advantage, easing out and in with the ebbs and
flows of the market. So I am really a trader with a value bias rather than a LT
investor.

My income stream is my salary, my portfolio has nothing to do with it, so I am
in a different situation than you are.

Also it's kind of brave to classify their company as well financed while
Moody's downgraded them to a single B "trash rating". No word while they sold

re CVS. CVS was a GAAP stock that seemed to have lost he "G" today.

I skimmed through the CC transcript and the CEO seemed quite disorganized.
Essentially they pulled the guidance for next years earnings. The PBM business
is 40% of the gross profits and lost 4B$ in annual business for Y2010. The
general manager for the PBM business has retired (=fired) and now they are
looking for a new manager. they only have clarity on the retail side (60% of
earnings) but not on the PBM side. Given my impression that the PBM business is
falling apart and represents 40% of CVS earnings power, a 20% haircut for the
stock seems justified.
I don't see a reason to buy and if I owned the stock, I would not be a seller
either (except to harvest a tax loss). While a 20% haircut seems overdone, this
stock went up 15% (from 30$ to 36$) on no real news either, so it's a bit
relative.

ATPG. Yes, a disappointing report. Your comments seem to quite well summarize
the situation and risks. The progress of the company and the detail analysis of
the development of their oil fields are closely followed and disected on the
Yahoo board.

Of all the oil stocks I am familiar with, this one trades the most below nav.
This is my ruling reason for buying the stock. Below nav essentially means
greatest proved and probable oil reserves to market cap as estimated by the
company/independent examiners. And that nav is nav after taxes, and where I
believe "oil reserves" for ATPG are essentially "oil" and not so much "boe"
(nat gas).

I have a big bet on the company succeeding in converting those reserves to cash
flows and transforming itself into a bigger company.

Measured by my dollar commitment, ATPG is by far my largest oil stock and among
my largest individual stock positions.

ATPG - given that this is your largest position, have you confidence in
management NAV estimates? I would do at least a "back of the envelope"
calculation of the NAV based on similar other companies or such.

ATPG management had similar things going on a few years ago, i believe with
North Sea oil fields. They have blown it back then, so i have little confidence
in them (or has management changed since then), but if I would gather some
independent validation of their NAV, i'd be willing to make a wagger as well.

Maybe $/barrel of oil based on proved reserves would be a decent number. Maybe,
i look around a bit myself. that aside the chart looks like it may fill huge
gap down to about 12$. Makes me leary too, even though i am not a chartist.

The verified PV number is only evaluated once a year. From ATPG's 10k I read:

 At December 31, 2008 our standardized measure of discounted future net cash
flows was $1.1 billion. The present value of future net pre-tax cash flows
attributable to estimated net proved reserves, discounted at 10% per annum,
(“PV-10”) is a computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net
cash flows on a pre-tax basis. The table below provides a reconciliation of
PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at
December 31, 2008. 

This number from the 10k is based on 12/31/08 crude prices and known reserves.
Current ATPG enterprise value is about 2B$. The current situation is quite a
bit different. My concern is that the NAV value that ATPG is giving out now in
their presentation is not a certified number and made up by management. Because
I have seen management blundering before I would not be willing to accept their
numbers without a sanity check.

ATPG. I'm not sure I understand what "verified" means in "only evaluated once a
year".

Imo though, you are right regardless. It is a bet on management and management
trustworthiness. I don't know if the ATPT guys shop around to get various
estimates of reserves, if the "independent" evaluators are evaluating properly,
or if the corporate and outside auditors are auditing correctly, honestly,
truthfully. (Auditors often audit only the numbers and info given to them by
management, imo).

Maybe management are liars. And if you're going to lie, might as well lie big.

I am going by slide 3 in the Robert and Renshaw conf. It shows -- ie management

I just arbitrarily take 65% of that to get to roughly after tax of $74/sh.

That is one high NAV number compared to current stock price. (NAV's come down a
little with latest published info, but still very high, >$60/sh

You bring out a possible good issue. Where is common sense with this thing? If
we can't trust management (trust management's numbers I'm talking about here.
Although also to a different but still significant extent management's ability
to finance operations and deliver oil), then ATPG should be avoided. The
extreme opposite case, maybe the worst case, would to make a big bet on ATPG --
perhaps I show my naivety and gullibleness by so doing. Maybe if someone were
willing to bet on the company and management, it should at best be only for a
small wager, at least at this time. At least until some of the oil prospects
become actualities.

Others will make their decisions; I make mine. I've been wrong many, many
times. And with this company as well.

Most companies have third party evaluations of the NPV (based on year end
status and prices) once a year only when they file their 10k. Larger companies
don't state the NPV at all, they just publish the reserve numbers. The NPV
during the years tend to vary widely (even the third party validated number
vary widely - ATPG went from 2.6B$ NPV(2007 10k) to 1B$ NPV (2008 10k) probably
due to crude prices) and they are based on management estimates and not numbers
from a 3rd party audit firm.

That is why I am skeptical of the numbers that ATPG is posting because it
differs tremendously from the 12/31/08 number in the 10k ( there are valid
reasons for this but still it's a factor 5x higher) and because ATPG has a
track record of overpromising.

As I see ATPG's dire situation a few month ago and the prospect of running out
of cash, i can't blame them on promoting their prospects but given the
circumstances, i think chances are pretty high that they are overpromising.

I only vaguely remember the story around the promising North Sea assets, but I
sure would study what happened in 2006 or so, if I had a substantial investment
in this stock.

ATPG: "ATPG went from 2.6B$ NPV(2007 10k) to 1B$ NPV (2008 10k) probably due to
crude prices) and they are based on management estimates and not numbers from a
3rd party audit firm."

There's a lot going on here. First and importantly, the oil/gas reserve numbers
are made by 3rd party audit firms hired by ATPG. Once per year numbers as you
say. I presume it's management who takes those reserve numbers and discounts
them with a calculation to get NPV numbers, which are the proved figures and
the proved&probable figures. And in turn from those figures, management
calculates nav (where assets/liabilities - the balance sheet - are audited by
the corporate auditing form).

I'm saying yes, I believe management makes some calculations, but the estimates
- the important reserve estimates that start the process -- are made by the
independent (presumed independent) reserve engineering firms.

==============
I'm not exactly sure what's being measured here:
"That is why I am skeptical of the numbers that ATPG is posting because it
differs tremendously from the 12/31/08 number in the 10k."

I pull up a page from their latest presentation, and from the numbers for pv10
proved (and also pv10 proved&probable) from Dec '08 and June '09, they don't
seem too different given changes in strip prices. I have to assume the pv10
numbers are based on the reserve numbers, and so I don't see much change from
12/08 through 6/09 for reserves. Again though, I don't dispute that these
numbers cannot or will not change dramatically. I just don't see "reserves" as
fluctuating and a possible clue of management overpromising something. (It may
be so; I just don't get it from these numbers.)

In addition to NAV and PV-10, the other (more-important) thing to look at is CF
and EV\EBITDA and I think ATPG looks very good if you look at those metrics
(e.g
http://www1.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=2831&mn=830&pt=msg&mid=8151893) and
managements forward projections on production and assume oil prices stay
somewhere around where they are now. If you assume that the management
projections are all hogwash not so much (but my personal opinion is that ATPG
management does a pretty good job).

The other thing that gives me some confidence s that Ed Ajootian I think has a
position, and this guy is one that makes coming to SI worthwhile and

A land loan for 1M$ and another one for 3.7M$. they also gave Carinalli an

that they tend to give you poor prices when thy buy and sell (at least that is

In my largest brokerage account, I'm running a little over 1/2 of 1 percent of
assets. And I'm okay with that.

If the Greenblatt model is to buy about 20 stocks that meet criteria and hold
them for one year (and then sell), that'd be about 40 commissions per year for
an individual follower. At say $8 per, that's $320 commission cost per year.
With $25K invested, it's only $1250 per stock though. Still, the idea is
supposed to work out okay over time, so the diversity might just act to smooth
things out.

If somebody followed what Greenblatt seems to be doing himself --go very
concentrated-- and which he suggested (?) for his kids or someone just starting
out (again, go for a few stocks), then the person would maybe spend a little
time to whittle down the possible buys to maybe 8-10 positions (every year). In
which case, maybe 20 $8 commissions. $160 vs $250, but you use your judgment
and time to select the stocks.

I say for $25K, it might be okay. For $100K, for me, I'd not want to give up 1%
per year.
====
Markets up this year, so I'm guessing Greenblatt model doing very well. Seems
though that since publication of book or the past 2-3 years, model has not
performed as historical results. I believe Mr. Greenblatt has said there've
been times when model doesn't work for 2-3 year period. So current performance
results don't invalidate his model or his enthusiasm for it.

IF somebody is really confident that the model works and garners 20% returns on
an annual average, then if the alternative to going with the Greenblatt
promoters (paying the 1% fee) is to buy bonds or etfs or mm funds or pfd
stocks, then maybe just go for it and forget about the "measly" 1% charge:
Focus on the 19% average gains to be expected which could/should/might exceed
those alternative choices. For me, while I believe in the model, I have trouble
coming to believe on a 20% avg. annual return.

well, it sounds like you would only be giving up 1/2% a year or so and the
ability to manage your own taxes for which you probably already employ a full

15% net of costs on an annual basis I would be ready to retire again and pursue
something else like writing, or growing an organic vegetable garden. I figure
Mr. Smith is managing a good chunk of my money and I own another 18% or so in

Greenblatt portfolio fund. On balance, I'd say it could be worth a shot for
part of a portfolio.

On the one hand, why pay someone for something that seemingly, you can do
yourself? That would be so if we knew exactly what the formula was. We know
it's 1/pe vs. roic, but the definition of roic is not specified by the author
(or wasn't when the book came out). Still, imo, pe vs. roe is just as good.

The benefit with these guys is that they do the work - picking and holding and
selling, and that they follow some approach that is understandable and
consistent (assuming they pick stocks from the quadrant of high roic and high
1/pe). Yes they'll use judgment to select from among low cap/high cap,
domestic/foreign, etc., but it should all be encased within the quadrant (the
criteria). To me, this beats most mutual fund managers and people here who
claim to be value investors but you can not understand how they determine that
a stock is undervalued. As for example with mutual fund managers who say they
have quant skills in a black box; just trust them. Or fund managers who ask you
to invest with them because the value they provide is meeting with and
evaluating the companies' corporate managers (access to whom, individual
investors don't get).

just to remain in the black) and will have beef up reserved in future quarters.

Of course there could be similar cases like Carinelli lingering but they are
probably smaller in size (since he is the largest landowner in Sonoma County)
and SSBI tend to loan locally.I don't think the dividend is safe either,
building reserves in this environment needs to come first. Quite a bit of

Thoughts on SPPR earnings?

My thoughts:

Cons:

1) They seem to have missed some debt covenants and have obtained waivers for
these covenants.

2) They've rolled the $9-$10M 9/30 Debt Payment to Wells Fargo to a payment due
on November 12th (this is a negative because I expected them to have already
paid this off).

Pros:

1) They've sold many hotels for an overall gain, showing that their hotels can
be sold above book value.

2) Stock is still selling significantly below book value, which may be a
semi-valid book value given #1 above.

3) RevPar is down less than the industry. No net income this quarter but still
positive FFO.

My overall thoughts are that I'm glad I've sold most of my individual hotel
stocks. This quarter has been a very negative quarter for hotel companies and
though I missed selling AHT, FCH, and BEE at the highs, I'm not looking to buy
them back at cheaper levels now. SPPR is doing better than most from an
operational perspective and may have value here, but on the other hand, I'm
glad I don't have a big positon (and don't recommend one) given the covenant
waivers and other debt issues they're working through.

expect to recoup their investment of 45 million in less than three years. Below
is the most recent presentation (though the timelines are out of date.

There were good questions by analysts on the call. They are building a subway
in Xian which will cut into the use of taxis, but many hybrids of gas and
natural gas are being built in China today. The company has a fifty percent
market share in Xian and they expect that to increase by the end of next year.
I would suggest listening to the call. The Roth analyst recently recommended
the stock, so he's a bit miffed on the call. The Heartland Advisor analyst was
also on the call and that fund owns a significant amount of stock.

I'm currently a bit neutral with the latest news. I've owned my shares for a
while as I've always thought CNG made sense in China. Currently natural gas
only supplies three percent of China's energy needs. I also think the LNG plant
will be very successful, but they have to get it built. In the meantime, you
never know what China will do with the price of CNG and it's difficult to
decifer how much competition is coming online with other means of
transportation or more stations.

I'm still holding my CHNG shares even though the price was crushed two days ago
with the announcement that the LNG plant will be delayed. The quarterly numbers
weren't great either, but the company is reaffirming guidance for the year. The

appealing. The company has one hundred percent commitments for their LNG and

re CHNG - much of the vialability depends on the input cost for NG from
Petrochina, the behemoth. The LNG plants run in the hundred of millions $, how
are they going to pay for it? It seems like a huge equity raise is due.

I'll bet we see a lot more nat gas coming on board from China for Chinese to
use as they employ recent new USA fracing technology. With their broad
geography, they are going to find shale, and gas there, ala USA deposits.
