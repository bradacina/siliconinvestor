I agree with you that it is vastly overvalued however I sold
a stock earlier this year after it had gone up 600% and was convinced it was
overvalued by at least 50%. It quadrupled after that and is now only triple
what I sold it for. Had I shorted that stock I would be asking for donations

Sigh, another scaredy bear (but you outlasted me!). I am becoming increasingly
convinced that all of us who "know better" (or thought we did...) will not make
any significant money when the bubble bursts, and might get hurt quite badly in
the meantime. I used to (smugly) think that the silver lining to a bubble burst
would be that I'd be able to make a bit of money off of it.

I have said this before on this thread about shorting - a lesson I learned from
seeing a hedge fund manager (Jimmy Rogers?) get absolutely killed in a well
publicized shorting of Resorts International over 20 years ago. He was right
about what eventually happened but his timing was wrong, and he missed the
party.

You short a company with bad fundamentals and a bad chart, like the
semiconductor stocks when it was obvious the industry was in a recession and
the stocks had thoroughly rolled over. You do not short overpriced stocks
without those characteristics as there is no inherent limit on how overpriced
they can become. These comments also apply to QQQ as it is largely an
aggregation of overpriced stocks, without those two characteristics.

And FWIW, my buys/shorts/sells:

Shorting stocks where I can see the bad news confirmed in the numbers.
Amazon.com (short at 82 5/8 again today) is pursuing some creative financing to
get the cash to keep going. Selling euro-dominated bonds follows an Australian
issue follows equity-linked debt follows who knows what.

Exodus (short at 129) is in a capital-intensive business with high start-up
costs and business inputs that have short half-lives. The barriers to entry are
minimal in the long run. Exodus' major shareholders have sold big-time. The
company should be raising its needed additional capital by selling inflated
shares but instead is borrowing $1billion plus at 10%+ rates. Intel is one of
the many targeting this same market.

Pre-Paid Legal (short at 24 3/4) I've gone through before (I shorted it from
$37ish down to 24ish last year). Cash flow continues to lag far behind reported
net income, membership retention stinks, and the CEO is engaging in borderline
stock promotion while he steadily sells. Many in the investor community
misunderstand this stock.

Bought Sara Lee, now trading at an EV/EBITDA of just over 8, and with return on
capital greater than 25%. Management's initiatives to maximize return on
capital and follow an EVA-type strategy over the last few years have been
successful, and the company has been buying back stock with its tremendous cash
flow. Its debt is rated AA-. Solid, defensive stock in an industry given no
respect by the market.

Bought Hasbro in addition to my Mattel. Hasbro is another one with an EV/EBITDA
just over 8. Tremendous brand equity and a good future strategy, IMO, with its
games.com. On the Buffettology thread early last year I made a strenuous
argument against Mattel and pointed out Hasbro's better record of return on
investment. Well now they're both so cheap I'm in both of them.

Sold Philip Morris (MO) as it makes new lows.

If you take out insurance+ and reserve+ from last year it was 2.49 - .62 =

1999 was $1.84, and it is now unclear to me just how much you might adjust EPS
higher to reflect the inventory write down (one time event?). I thought it was

$1.05 net vs $.79 in 1998. The improvement was "primarily due to increased
response to a reduced advertising program" - sounds good to me. It looks like
they repurchased something like 10% of their share count, so the net-net per

HAS: In today with modest starter position @15 5/16. In addition to valuation
rationale Mike stated, I see competitive battle rationale: Simply stated, there
are two armies on the toy field of battle. One, HAS, has seasoned leadership
the other, MAT, doesn't and is in disarray. I think leadership counts for a lot
given the fast changing nature of this biz. While MAT's assets are arguably
valued for less currently, they deserve to be as HAS is positioned to score
more wins going forward...it's gonna take awhile for MAT to come up to speed in
the leadership department - this is the same board that chose Barad and let her
buy TLC for way too much. Don't expect their judgement to improve that much.
Some resellers may be doubtful about MAT's ability to skillfully market and
thus reluctant to commit to programs and inventory. With 'Open to buy's' being
fought for, I give HAS a big edge.
I've been somewhat reluctant about HAS regarding Pokemon [Look at KIDE chart
They license Poke], but this probably has more legs than the street is giving
HAS credit for [Though not as much as KIDE is still credited for]. 75+% of HAS
revenues are 'Evergreen' non-promotional categories, an underlying theme of the
co for years and a sustaining base in a volatile market environment.
That said, I won't be suprised to see the market continue to play 'Prariedog'

James/All

My analysis of SNH is a little more negative than that presented on this thread
especially in regards to a possible dividend cut. I believe a 9 month loss of
50% of their total revenue base is a real possibility.

From the 10q if you look at the Frontier and Sun rent obligations, they are 1.1
in arrearages on annual rents of 1.7mil as of Nov 1. (I do not think they have
collected yet) These operators declared chapter 11 in July and October and here
it is Feb so the 9mo scenario does not seem unrealistic.

Look at Mariner and Integrated, they declare chapter 11 Feb 2000 and represent
48% of rental income. If we pull the income statement and cut revenues by 50% I
calculate net income of ~2mil/yr Add back in depreciation gets to ~24mil/yr.
Use the obligatory 85% payout gives me a dividend of ~80c/share possible.

Since everyone in this sector is in the same boat, it is doubtful (imo) that
asset sales will bring any relief even if they could get decent prices for
them.

While I agree that this is probably close to a worst case scenario, it is not
the worst case as we do have a rising interest rate environment. SNH debt is
all floating according to the 10q. A 71 Bpt rise (from Sept 99) will cost an
additional 1.4mil/yr according to 10q. I believe we are looking at about
another 2-3mil/year in costs in the current interest rate environment.

It would seem entirely possible to have a dividend reduction of up to about 60%
instead of the 20-30% I have seen mentioned on this thread.

Agree / disagree and why. Thanks as I am trying to determine at what point I
would be interested in adding to my position.

You just made the bull case on SNH. If the worst of worst cases STILL leaves
you with a 9% dividend yield at the trough (i.e. before they can take
possession of, or retenant the distressed assets), that sounds like a pretty
firm margin of safety. Where we get the $1.80-1.90 stabilized dividend is by
recognizing what happens after that 9 month period you are focused on. Also
recognize that this could resolve itself a lot quicker than that.

around. This is complete government mismanagement, but then the Energy
Department has the nerve to brush off USEC when they ask for a little relief.
Be careful who you move in next to. Shouldn't there have been some kind of
Megan's Law disclosure here?

I have learned a lot of lessons from this disaster. It would take pages to
enumerate them.

The question is do you sell the stock here? I am choosing not to, but I am also
not adding. Unless they can get some relief on cost, the company has no future.
And they face miles of red tape to do so, and they don't have much clout to get
what they want from the Feds.

Jim, what came to mind in reading this is that the government has little
concept of fair dealing with private enterprise, probably because from the top
down there is almost no exposure to working for a company where the security of
your job depends on the success of your company. From this company to the
myriad of health care providing companies (or REITs) that have recently been
put at death's door, you see it everywhere. The moral of the story in my mind
is that if the business is in bed with the government or substantially affected
by it you should stay away unless the government relationship is very well
defined, like the FDA, or the stock price is exceptional.

Beware of the government. Lesson learned. Still the best trade I ever made was
selling a large holding in Philip Morris at the peak in 1997 when speculation
surfaced that there would be a settlement with the government. The stock went
up because people felt that would put an end to liability - I sold because it
sounded too good to be true. Never would have imagined what turned out to have
happened, but to this day I have never bought a tobacco stock again, though I
have been inches from doing so several times.

Clearly you want to avoid the government's next target if you can predict it.
But the tough thing for value investors is to avoid the government's current
target, even though the risk appears to be in the price. The collusion between
the Clinton administration and trial lawyers is bordering on criminal in my
opinion, but when it comes down to investment I put my politics aside and bet
on Clinton.

What are his next desperation targets in the last year of his presidency (and
Gore's campaign issues)? Bank ATM fees would be one. Tobacco will continue to
be flogged. HMOs may be passe, but I wouldn't bet on it. I think they're done
with airlines. Gore's environmental thing should make us wary of a lot of
utilities that burn coal, and rust belt America in general.

Speaking of rust belt America, I bought CAT at 35 with a stop-loss at 34 1/4 on
Friday. I have watched this stock like a hawk for three years now, and I didn't
think it would break 40. Now we're at a level where CAT hasn't traded since
1996. (We had a global economic crisis between then and now). Cyclicals are at
an extreme in sentiment in my view, and CAT is among the first investors will
go to to play the bounce, if not the recovery. The danger is that on
fundamental analysis, if you really believe the US economy is going into a
recession, CAT could go significantly lower. This is a trade for now - thats
why I have the stop-loss. I would be looking for a sell point if the stock
rallies. But one could also make a very strong case for CAT as a long-term
investment at this level. This is a great company trading at a 3 year low. A
cyclical stock, no doubt, but a company that in Buffett-speak will almost
certainly earn more 10 years from now than it does today. (And to stop one
counter-argument in its tracks, before you say earnings are at a peak, look at
the last three years earnings. One could argue they are at a trough.)

running rampant, and it seems that the market is valuing Morris tobacco with a
negative net worth because of litigation. I hate it when the government
interferes in cases like this, and finds another way to allow lawyers to

a big if for value players or if you want to diverisify into the internet

to their shares that is a quadruple since then. Meaning IM minus Softbank goes
for about $400MM. IM IPOed at $18 and is now going for $13.5 having moved up a
lot in the past day and a half after going nowhere in awhile as the largest
computer distributor in the world. The company is looking for a ceo and there
are rumors of a buyout as well. This is a profitable business that is not going

Paul,

I think the Citigroup stake is the result of his original position in the
Salomon convertible preferred. Salomon was taken out by Travelers who
subsequently merged with Citibank.

The original Salomon (which I assume is now a Citigroup preferred) stake is
eligible for conversion to common on each October 31 starting in 1995 and
ending in 2000. That's the reason for the current holding I suspect.

I believe he sold some of that common stake in prior years via a convertible
bond he issued. I don't know the details.

In any event, I didn't take the current Citi stake to be a meaningful
endorsement of that company. He converted to get the capital gains and added
value. Even if he winds up holding it, I still don't think that's much of an
endorsement. He has few common stock ideas and a ton of cash and bonds. Why
sell a stock and trigger 35% capital gains tax when you have no alternative use
for the money if it is even reasonably valued? If he sells that means he hates
it.

Jeffrey: re: classy women's clothes (timeless) and fashion. Yes, I can't seem

earnings to be more stable than if it's a business that caters to fashion
whims. That stability would appeal to Buffett types, I assume. But if the
clothes are so classy/stable then where's the sales growth?

Here's what Ann Taylor says (per Yahoo):
"The Company believes that "Ann Taylor" is a recognized national brand that is
represented by classic styles and reflects current fashion trends. The
Company's product extensions support its total "wardrobing strategy," and
provide existing and new customers with additional reasons to shop at stores.
Product extensions over the last several years include Ann Taylor shoes, denim,
petites, fragrance and personal care products. "

Question is, can we determine if the stocks of these companies are cheap and

Thanks, Twister and Bob. Helpful cautions there about Mr. Buffett and his

I assume - and wrongly so -- that if a guy's name were attached to the pick and
both were bandied about all over the world -- that if the pick wasn't from the
guy -- he or she would be very quick to so state the pick doesn't represent his
personal choice. Maybe Mr. Buffett has so stated this and maybe several times
in the past. But at least a couple of us missed it or forgot it, and those
stocks that were mentioned yesterday that I'm looking at are all up today - so
someone's buying on the 'Buffett' news, imo.

Mr. Buffett owes no explanation to anyone. He's followed all government
requirements. So if he says nothing
that should be sufficient. Guess I'm just assuming my own expectations of what
I believe a person should say if those picks weren't his personal choices. Hah.

SNH could go to 6. I won't argue with you.

SNH offers something very rare. Economics I think I have done my homework on,
and a shareholder base which will sell every time it goes to a new low because
it is a recent spinoff with a lot of retail investors. I have no reason to
believe that the market is efficient here, so I just watch what is going on
economically. If something happens to shake my analysis I will change my
strategy. If not, I hope it goes to 4, because I am a buyer, not a seller.

I don't expect everybody to share my view. My background is real estate, and I
am in contact with management, so I think I understand what is going on and
feel capable of following the turnaround in detail. Stocks other people on this
thread have similar confidence in are outside of my circle of competence, so I
don't mess around with them.

The risk in SNH from my perspective is not that it goes to 6. The risk in SNH
is that my real estate analysis is wrong. Period. Mike came to the same
conclusion independently of me. When I talked to company management the first
time I found that my estimate of the sustainable dividend was within 10% of
theirs.

The current dividend will be cut within the current quarter. Know that going
in. There may be a scary period with a lower dividend in between, but a year
from now this company will pay a solid dividend in the $1.50-$2.00 range. The
stock trades at $8 1/4, (going to 6?).

that is the price that I believe "smart" money (Bronfman) made its(his) latest

I've started a very small position in TRW. Odd conglomerate imo. It's partly
and significantly in the auto parts OEM business. Stock is selling at pe of 11.
Imo, that is too high a pe given what I perceive as comparable pe's in the auto
parts sector. On the other hand, there's a significant technology component
with incubator companies, stake in satellites, and broadband technology. Here
the 11 pe is too low for what I would expect from a leader in, and/or developer
of, these 'fashionable' businesses.

I see it as a tug-of-war as to how the market categorizes and values TRW
(whether the pe moves up or down). Given that TRW is selling near a 3 year low,
the potential for the conglomerate (TRW has resources to spinout or spinoff,

J.V Smith, Jr.: re: POOL. I'll call it a maybe, but I'll pass it by.

I looked at POOL last year at $12 and passed. I was wrong then (POOL is now 24)
and I could very well be wrong now.

I need to know what might make them so special. I didn't understand last year
when I superficially looked, and I don't see it now after a quick scan. They
distribute pool supplies. Sales have increased 6X in the past few years (to .6
Billion -- not a tiny company anymore), earnings have risen too. Plus this
expansion has taken place with no long term debt taken on and not very much
increase in stock outstanding. And pe is fairly attractive. All very
positive,imo.

But how can this be? They are a distributor of pool supplies. I guess this
should be a very competitive business with not much barrier to entry. From the
specialty chemical manufacturers and distributors themselves. Why aren't
companies like RPM, CENT getting into this apparently very profitable niche
business? (EMN bought out Lawter Chemical if I recall correctly and Lawter is
also in the same business (if I remember) as POOL>>> + is that POOL might be an
acquisition target too for somebody; - is increased competition that might be
there from well capitalized competitors) For a growth business,I just don't see
how POOL's good numbers can be sustainable. Even after 6 years of proof (-g- I
want to see 7 years). If POOL's to be valued as a distributor, then imo, it's
too expensive based on book value and price to sales.

All jmo. And I've been wrong many, many times. I might even be wrong many, many
times on just this one stock -g-.

http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=MAXS+WWW+NKE+KSWS+TBL+BWS+CVE+BOOT+FLH+RCKY+SKX&d=t
which confirms they're assessment that retailers are problem. Some of the
players are 'blowing out' inventory which is potentially harmful to margins,
however these guys say they will not be discounting agressively even if it
prolongs inventory overhang and lowers unit volumes and shares - they cited
prior multi-year period where they employed similar strategy.
They're looking at making acquisitions, but won't buy a loser or overpay for a
winner. I like the way they disclose. They seem to take straitforward 'Tell it
like it is' approach which will cause difficulties to be discounted sooner
rather than later. An important key to this group would appear to be to study
the retailers and industry to get an idea of what's hurting them and when the
shakeout may be ending. A reasonable strategy might be to buy on bad news dips,
to average in over the next year with a 2 - 3 year time horizon. I own MAXS
because of Jim's rec. but will study the industry a bit more before getting
further involved. It's an approach avoidance thing with the shoe biz: I love
bargains and there clearly are some, but I lack anything resembling a sense of

probably diversify if I get further involved.

Purchasing Loral as it drops to $16 or slightly below. I think it's worth in
the 30s and I hope I am right about it.

I passed on the footwear sector for now. Not a deep value play, but opted for
buying WMT today. IMHO, ridiculous to take the world's largest retailer down 8%
on fear of Mr. G, after a very decent earnings release.

Michael, I'm curious whether the bulletin board on your website has a couple of
posts that appear to be advertisements for what look like an illegal HYIP
scams?

Here's some info about these types of scams, in case you're unfamiliar with
them:

I'm not knocking your website. It's just that I did a search at a major search
engine for the phrase "bank trading program," trying to find, out of my
curiousity, whether anybody advertised these illegal schemes on the web. When I
did this, I came up with several hits on your website.

Thought you should get a head's-up on this one.

Hey, it looks like post #10,000 is coming up. Wonder who will get the grub on
it?

Mike,

Recently my broker mentioned "burning" biotechs and
I recalled you recommending INCY couple hundred points
lower. Did you buy any? :-))) I didn't. ;-)

Paul,

TRW looks interesting, but I'm bothered by debt/equity
jump last year (per stocksheet). I don't like high
debt levels and I'm too lazy to dig in real SEC
financials to figure out what's up.

I'll throw out SG. Somebody mentioned it in the past
(?). Slow growth, OK ROE, no debt. 5 year chart would
kill even most dedicated holder. PE lowest in a long
while, but maybe they are killed by Internet lotos? ;-)
Anyone wants to do some digging?

BTW, a friend said some time ago that we won't see
one digit PEs (like in the 60's-70's?) on serious
companies ever again. I guess he'd been right if he
said "when pigs (I mean Internets) fly" instead. :-))))
