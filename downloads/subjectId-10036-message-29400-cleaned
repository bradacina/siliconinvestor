LAD not particularly great, although showing profits in each of past ten years.
Perhaps negatives specific to LAD might be too dependent on Western USA, too

BRKA - Although I pounded the table regarding WSC and I still think it is
undervalued, I am getting a bit antsy about BRKA. BRKA is becoming a huge
conglomerate. And now it buys not a company, but another conglomerate of 125
businesses. Buffett or one of his successors will be overseeing the operational
businesses, but I am still concerned. The company now owns over 140 different
businesses (including the new ones). Can it maintain operational excellence in
all of them? And if some of the businesses don't work, what then? Buffett was
always against disposing of the deadwood but is that a good and reasonable
strategy going forward for BRK? I guess the sellers are attracted to BRK's
aversion to close or sell businesses, so it will be tough to change that. But I
can't really believe it's possible to run over 140 businesses at the super-high
level of operations. You can find maybe 5-10 super leaders for Geico or
reinsurance or Nebraska Furniture Mart. But 140?... For example, I don't know
what targets Buffett had for McLane, but from recent margin analysis I am not
sure the purchase is bringing much if anything to BRK...

They fund new acquisitions through their unsecured revolving credit facility
maintained with a group of institutional lenders. At March 31, 2007, there was
$144 million outstanding and $606 million available on our revolving credit
facility, and had cash and cash equivalents of $23.1 million.

It looks like they pay between 6%-7% on their borrowed money. Any increase in
borrowing costs would impact future acquisitions only to the extent that they
are not able to increase tenants longterm lease rates.

I am looking for values in Japan. I recently purchased some Ricoh (RICOY.OB)
and also started a position in Canon (CAJ).

Furthermore I am looking into the conglomerates Itochu and Sumitomo (ITOCY
SSUMY) which seem to have the lowest PE from the bunch (which would also
include Mitsui and Mitsubishi).

Those trading houses have really remade themselves in the last 5-6 years ,IMO.
They used to be control companies more so than profit oriented but that appears
to have changed, the removed a lot of deadwood, restructured and improved their
balance sheet. Now their services which include pretty much everything the
growing economies in Asia need (Mining, Energy, oil, financing,
infrastructures, heavy machinery) are in demand and profits are gushing. As far
as i can see those stocks are still fairly inexpensive, the PE range from about
9-13.

The stocks have surged during the last few days while I was researching them (I
hate it when that happens) so I am waiting for a pullback. i think they are all
buys but i like ITOCHU and Sumitomo the most right now because of valuation.

ITOCY and SSUMY financial data is not readily available and I don't think well

lot of values appearing right now in US market, why I should go and try to
understand foreign conglomerates that don't even report their financial numbers
in USA? It's a real question, not a rhetorical one. You say that they are
benefiting from Asia buildup, but is that a guess or do you have facts to
substantiate it? The second question: except of oil, I believe everything else
in heavy construction / machinery, etc. is still cyclical. Are you sure you are
not buying at the (Chinese) top?

I agree with Buffett: with dollar at record lows, US industrials should have a

Jurgis, i do not see a lot of leverage with RICOH. Their equity is 48% of their
balance sheet, they have decent FCF, revenue growth, liquid assets are 10% of
the balance sheet and debt looks fairly low for a Japanese company. With
Japanese, quity tends to lower which is no surprise since the interest rates
are close to zero.

CAJ forward PE is 13. this combined with a stellar balance sheet and stock
buybacks is cheap when compared to historical valuations for CAJ.

My source is simply the TSE website to begin with and then i look at the
company websites themselves. You will see that SSUMY and ITOCY have had a
remarkable increase in profits during the last 5 years.

I do not care too much about published US figures. Being brought up elsewhere I
am just fine with foreign accounting, in fact i think i prefer the lowballing
approach of the Japanese to the sometimes aggressive accounting of US
companies.

As far as cheap US manufacturing is concerned, i wonder what the values are
that you are seeing. Not much around for PE <15 except for microcaps, or very
cyclical industries as far as i can tell. The values in the US appear to be in
the financial sector where I am treading very careful right now.

My mistake. Still their ROE is about 10%.

where?

2006: 16,368,291
2005: 16,954,280
3% growth from 2005 to 2007. :(

CAJ as I said is probably fairly valued. I would not buy it, but it's your
choice.

Regarding SSUMY and ITOCY, IMHO, the only worthwhile time to venture to foreign
companies not reporting in US is when there is a huge story. Whatever you would
say, the reporting varies country to country. I've done Mexico, UK, China,
Brasil, Chile and they all have quirks. I have not yet looked at any Japanese
reporting companies but I can guarantee there are quirks and that website
reporting is worse than SEC 10Q/K. So there is pain. What about gain? Let's go
back to story.

You claim that story is Asian buildup (mostly Chinese I guess). I buy that a
bit, but I am concerned about cyclicality and being late, actually being very
late to the party. Do you really believe that next 5 years will repeat the last
5 years for these companies? This is the main question. If the answer is "yes",
then they are cheap. If the answer is "no", China crashes or at least cycles,
then they are not. :)

>As far as cheap US manufacturing is concerned, i wonder what the values are
that you are seeing. Not much around for PE <15 except for microcaps, or very
cyclical industries as far as i can tell.

So you are dissing US cyclicals, but not concerned that your Japanese
conglomerates are possibly at the cyclical top?

Regarding US, yes, the biggest values are in financials, retail, housing, oil
and gas, which I claim is no longer cyclical but you have to be careful not to
buy declining companies. Weak dollar plays? HOG, definitely. COH, maybe.

OK, I looked really fast at Itochu:

Positives: You are right, the debt is decreasing for last 9 years, equity is

Negatives: D/E is still high at 1.8. Net margin is very low at 1.5%.

Now, to the story. Hmm, actually according to their geographical segment
information, there is no real story. They have growth in Japan (not sure if
this is connected to China or not and no way of checking really), they have
some growth in Asia, some in NA and Europe... Asia is still <20% of revenues
and not growing very fast, in fact it went down in 2007 (which ended in March
2007).

Looking at industrial segments, it is a true conglomerate with no dominant
segment. I don't really like that, since it means that I have no clue where
this company will go in the future. Actually the largest segment seems to be

Ok my last rebuttal
CAJ 's numbers are here:

http://www.canon.com/ir/chart/01.html

CAJ numbers are very clean. High single digit sales growth and a substantial
amount of the cash is FCF and the absence of one time charges looks good to me.
Please also note that US companies with foreign exposure sure will show good
growth in US $ if the currency depreciates.

The allure of SSUMY and ITOCY is that they are restructuring stories that are
about 50% finished and they are cheap based on PE's of 9-10. They sure are in
cyclical industries but they have very little exposure to the US or Europe and
more so to Asia (not just China), which is where the growth is supposedly.

I do not agree with you that one should not venture outside the US unless there
is a huge story (or maybe we differ on what a huge story means). Increasing the
profitability by 10x is a huge story. i agree that those companies are in
cyclical business but they are also quite diversified.

Madharry, I sold MOGIF at a loss in November. Have EDVMF. As I followed you
into it, I will follow you out -- after Dec. 31 though. I'm trying not to take
any more gains in '07. Searching still for tax loss candidates. A trade-off
with Canroys: Have large short-term losses with many Canroys; not so willing
though to be out 31 days with such high div. payers. (They could bounce in a
Jan. effect.)

Just odd. 2007 eems to be among my worst years this decade for stock market
performance. Yet I have humongous ("humongous" by my history/lifestyle/assets)
taxable gains to report -- my largest ever. And will likely have a huge AMT to
pay. Is what happens I guess when a large account ("large" for me anyway) is
cleared up and reduced. Taxes on stocks held for 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 etc. years
must be paid when eventually sold. I'm guessing with AMT, my effective fed tax
rate will be closer to 25%-35% than 15% commonly suggested for USA long-term
capital gains payers. And I could be subject to state AMT tax too. (Seems like
being subject to AMT means I'll be foregoing any and all deductions for
adjusted gross income which I was counting on before my stock sales.) I've
reserved a huge chunk of cash I received from stock sales to pay Jan 15
estimated fed/state tax due. So, since my stocks (i.e. my taxable portfolios)
didn't go up near 25%, paying 30% or more to feds/state gov't from stock sales
effectively means my portfolios' total value at year-end 2007 will be much less
than seen at Dec. 31, 2006.

Have you looked at their 3Q report:

Talk about a mess... Huge revenue drop from 2006, large chunk of shares issued,
net loss covered by "foreign exchange gain"... OK, I realize you talked about
"faith-based investing", so it's really up to you (and few shares might not
hurt), but for other investors I would recommend reading their reports and
making up their own mind from there. From Seeking Alpha article I was almost
ready to make "faith-based" investment of my own, but now I am not going to. Of
course, management have a rosy explanation and plans for the future, so I may
be totally wrong and you may have multibagger in your hands.

This is in the IRA account. Proceeds were allocated 3/5 into HRPT Properties

HON is near a 52wk high up 35% for the year. It far exceeded my two year price

The drug stocks in the IRA pay good dividends so I continue to hold. Last year
I sold some BMY and added to my MRK at much lower levels. 25% of the IRA is in
the S&P Index and no one individual stock holding (other than CVX) accounts for
more than 4% of the IRA portfolio.

12% of my IRA is made up three drug stocks; PFE, MRK & BMY. Since I have a long
time horizon (25 years), I believe the drug sector will achieve at least a 10%
compounded growth rate over this period. The baby boomers will need and use
drugs.

My IRA growth goal is 10% compounded growth. The drug stocks average 4% annual
dividends and only need to contribute 6% annual growth to meet my 10% growth
target. I use the dividend income to buy other stocks or add to my current
holdings. I no longer contribute to my IRA as I do not generate "earned" income
so I rely on dividend income streams to fund new purchases in the IRA. So far,
my drug stock holdings have generated a good dividend income stream and MRK and
BMY have actually exceeded my growth targets.

My expenses are less than any of the mutual funds and I have very good stock

(imputed) expense fees. I have sold all of my mutual funds (except for three)
in 2000 because their annual expenses were quite large when evaluated over a

What is interesting is since 1988, I have achieved a compounded annual return

There was large insider buying August 1, 2007 at prices between $6-$8.90.

The "value" proposition is that the market over reacted in the sell off in
early August 2007 (from $30 down to $6) due to the uncertainty of the value of
their different debt obligations. My expectations is that over time the market

Ashford's Solid Share Count
By Rich Duprey / Motley Fool....................December 6, 2007

Insider stock sales typically don't account for much in determining a company's
future growth. But when insiders are making significant purchases with their
own money, it could very well be a signal that management thinks its stock is
seriously undervalued.

That's why investors might want to take a closer look at Ashford Hospitality
Trust (AHT), a real estate investment trust that invests in the hospitality
industry, with a primary concentration on hotels run by Marriott (MAR),
Starwood (HOT), Hilton, and Hyatt.

Along with many other players in the real estate market, Ashford has found its
stock trading at far lower valuations from where it sat just a few months ago.
As a result, not only has management instituted a buyback program of $50
million -- which, at today's prices, would be equivalent to about 5% of the
REIT's outstanding shares -- but insiders have begun snapping up shares as
well. In November alone, insiders have bought up more than $3.2 million worth
of shares. Both the chairman and the CEO each purchased almost $1.5 million
worth of stock, and various directors have bought thousands of shares as well.

Should investors act on their confidence? Well, consider the facts.

Ashford owns, directly or through joint ventures, 119 hotels, with Marriott
alone managing 46 of them.

All except one are located in the U.S., and the REIT has acquired some 56
properties since June 2006. It's trading at just two-thirds of its book value,
including $218 million worth of accumulated depreciation on the properties it
owns.

In the third quarter, Ashford saw its RevPAR -- revenue per available room, a
metric the hospitality industry uses to gauge operations -- increase by 5.5%,
and it also achieved a 6.3% increase in average daily room rates (ADR). That's
pretty much in line with Ashford's year-to-date totals, in which it benefited
from 6% increases in room revenues and 7.2% increases in ADR. The price
increases helped offset some occupancy weakness caused by renovations at some
of its properties.

The results also compare favorably with those of competing REITs such as
Hospitality Properties (HPT), which saw 6.3% increases in RevPAR and a 5.2%
increase in ADR. According to Smith Travel Research, national trends are in
line with what Ashford is seeing. The market research firm reports year-to-date
increases of 6.5% in RevPAR for the industry and a 6.3% rise in ADR.

Given the smart acquisitions, a depressed valuation, and the typical increase
in hotel value over time, management's decision to invest in itself -- even as
its dividend yields nearly 11% -- may indeed be a prudent move that we should
pay some attention to.

Re: http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WPL 

As did I yesterday, and I also put my neck pretty squarely on the block in my
trading account today, but kept some funds available to average down pretty
seriously Monday if the opportunity arises.

Getting down to here is really pretty much just in keeping with the normal ebb
and flow of this stock lately and I think that it's gotten down to here ($4.79
close revised to $4.86 less than a minute later, and currently $4.90 in AH)
solely because tax-loss selling happened during a normal flowing out of the
tide.

It's been strongly range-bound for about 2 months, but if one is willing to
wait several days between trades, it's been a very tradeable stock, with 10-15%
possible each time.

The last time I sold it I tried to turn around and go short but couldn't. I
don't know if I just couldn't get a borrow or what.

If anyone's reading this and considering trading it (arguably a good move if
you trade contrary to my positions) to get those semi-reliable 10% gains
occasionally, be forewarned that this stock epitomizes the old joke that has
the punchline "Sell it to who? You've been the only buyer." The volume is
pretty thin on it. I don't normally trade stocks whose volume I don't think is
high enough for me to "hide" in, but this one's been worth it to me.

Like me, I suspect this is one of the cheapest stocks you go anywhere near.

I'd be curious to hear your take on http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FMT , which I
trade and have invested in, and is even cheaper. It got beaten with the rest of
the companies involved in subprime (and they were knee-deep in it), but have
the advantage of having sold off that business early. They've done two 50%
upward climb days in the past couple of months (~20% pullback after the first
one -- the latter just happened a few days ago). Currently $3.89, traded below
$2.00 in early November, and were mid $16's a year ago. And spiked from $7 to
about $13 in the last half of May.

Before the subprime mess, it was a tradeable, dividend-paying $20-24 stock.

I don't think it's a $24 stock, since it got there largely on the back of
subprime, but I also don't think it's a $4 stock.

Re: http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=LAD 

Will check into this one. I tend to favor stocks that've fallen from grace for
whatever reason, if I think the fall is overdone. And a ~50% drop does catch my
attention, though the fact that it's done so in an orderly fashion gives me
pause. I prefer overdone knee-jerk reaction stories like
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ELN , http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WPL and

Since the dividends reported are so often wrong everywhere (everyone still
shows WPL paying a dividend, though they suspended the dividend a month or so
ago), I'd rather ask you than the quotes page: The dividend still intact?

Hi Lazarus - According to the rule of 72, an annual compound growth rate of 10%
would produce a double in net assets in 7.2 years. I did not do the calculation
for my IRA but $1 grew to $8 dollars in 19 years. That's more than 10% annual
compound. They key for an IRA account is to not loose principle, limit all
losses and generate income (ie dividends) so the proceeds can compound.

My goal is to achieve a diversified portfolio of stocks that generate dividend
income, have potential for growth and from time to time re-balance the
portfolio to take advantage of value opportunities.

If a portfolio that has grown 100 times its asset value in eight years would be
a huge number. Can you enlighten the board with the calculated number?

regarding the following:

did ok in the "not lose principle dept"

sucked BIG TIME at limiting losses - for example had 20k shares of a stock in
my IRA that I purchased for under a dime and when the stupid (dotcom) stock was
$18.75 I didnt sell. I actually watched it go BK and sink to ZERO. Thankfully I
did sell some other shares I had on the way up for a profit.... I was holding
the last 20k shares for "better or worse" and got shown the WORSE and managed
to leave the BIG BUCKS on the table.

since all the stocks were for pretty much for capital gains I havent made much
on divys - except CDLA which I snagged as low as 7 cents per share and grabbed
my last 50k shares at .15. they are paying me another penny per share divy this
year.

lest anyone think my head is puffy, let me assure that you that I made blunders
galore. by my last count I had 84 stocks in my portfolio that = zero or are
otherwise untradeable.they represent hundreds of thousands of dollars in
paper-profit losses.

Do not feel too bad but in my 19 years working my IRA account, I did have two
small positions that went BK. Hindsight says that it was not a good investment
for the IRA but these two were during the dot.com period.

I try to be very conservative with the IRA account and now maintain a
discipline that any new IRA investment must pay a dividend. I probably should
also amend my rule to include not to invest in any sub-prime companies too.

I am looking at using ETF funds in the IRA as the expense fees are low and you
get instant diversification and can target specific sectors.

Good luck on your strategy. Good find on DYSL. Have a profitable New Year and
focus on steady and slow gains that generate income for the IRA. Limit your
speculative picks to amounts you can afford to lose.

Those BK assets in the IRA are worthless so I try to speculate on those
prospects in the taxable account.

hours to find out!

With ASSURED, we clearly post the price of every single vehicle in our
inventory right on the windshield. For new cars, that price is ALWAYS AT OR
BELOW THE MANUFACTURER’S SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE (MSRP). For used vehicles, we
use information gathered from an independent, 3rd party source that tells us
what similar vehicles in the area have actually sold for and then we use that
as the basis for our price…we don’t just make up a number based on how much
profit we want to make. It’s simple."

Hi Bart -

Thanks for making the calculation.

Here is the formula I found on the Investopedia.com
site(http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp)

Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR):

The compound annual growth rate is calculated by taking the nth root of the
total percentage growth rate, where n is the number of years in the period
being considered.

This can be written as follows:<pre>
(1 / # of years) - 1
CAGR = (ending amount / beginning amount)
</pre>
==========================================================

Sir John Templeton was one investor I followed in the 1970's. He achieved a 16%
compounded growth rate over 20 years between 1958-1978.

sub-prime/real estate update.

I continue to hold title companies. I'm temporarily out of Fidelity (both FNF
and FIS) as I am taking a tax loss. I upped my First American position in lieu
of them. Still hold small Landam position having bought @ $27.

I have been lucky with the homebuilders. Last year I made small money with MDC
Holding. I have exited that in favor of more speculative Meritage and Pulte
which also has been profitable. Bankruptcy risk is offset by price/book ratios
around .5. This good fortune has been more than offset by a bloodbath in
Building Material Holdings. I continue to up my position as P/B is < .3 and
trailing P/S is .07. Amazingly, BLG has continued to report profitable quarters
through this mess (so far).

I exited Moody's and McGraw Hill early in September sidestepping some of their
decline. I want to stay out not knowing how solid their legal defense is in
future litigation about their possible culpability in rating sub-prime related
securities.

I continue to hold First Marblehead but my faith has been badly shaken by their
issuing equity and needing lines of credit to continue their business under
current market conditions.

Wells Fargo. I'm starting a small position in Wells Fargo ($30). Forward PE is
11 and P/B is 1.25. I don't know how adequate their loss provisions are but I
also don't know if PE and P/B are going to get better than this.

Also, I have moved one E*Trade account to a "Wellstrade PMA" account in
December. 100 commission free transactions a year. The website is pretty lame
(it seems like it's 8 year old technology) but the price is right and I don't
do much trading in this account as its taxable.

I moved most of a retirement account from E*Trade to Scottrade in November.

Wells is currently the only bank I hold. I exited Washington Mutual in June in
the low $40s. This was dumb luck as I was simply taking some small tax losses.
As the damage unfolded I didn't get back in as I knew how aggressive WM was in
California with ARM products.

I still hold State Street and Bank of New York which have done well... I
consider them banks in name only.

Still hold large positions in Microsoft, Google, Ebay, Digital River, YUM
restaurants, Principal Financial, and Wal-mart. I'm not saying they are value
stocks, but I don't think they are expensive either.

In oil and gas, I still hold a large position in Patterson UTI (a contract
driller) at a small loss. I have almost completely exited the Canroys (Peyto,
HTE, others) and Canadian Oil Sands (Connacher) having small appreciation with
meaningful dividends. The recent talk of the Canadians altering the royalties
on the back of changing the tax treatment of the canroys was enough for me.

I'll post my new positions this week.

Those are pretty impressive rates of return.

Your return of 12% is not bad either, especially considering the 2000 - 2002
period which was very difficult.

The S&P 500 (darling of the indexes) just pulled up to even after 8 years (over
the 1999 - 2007 period of time). I don't think Wall Street will be pointing
this out and throwing a party.

Hi Paul - Guess which investor turned $10,000 borrowed from his boss into
$40,000 over 4 years. His strategy was to buy all the 104 US stocks that were
selling for less than $1 at the outbreak of the war?

Answer: Sir John Templeton

I discovered this site as I was researching successful investors.
http://www.incademy.com/courses/Ten-great-investors/-Warren-Buffett/9/1040/1000

My Dad introduced me to investing by having me read Templeton's mutual fund
prospectus and annual letters. I guess that exercise got me into the mind set
of value investing.

Of the 10 great investors reviewed in the above Web site, I guess Sir John
Templeton is the one which mostly matches my style. I tend to focus on
value-based methods which have led me to own a large numbers of stocks that
with time beat the overall averages. The get rich slow method.

It is interesting to read about the attributes of these other great investors.
The key take away is to employ a method of investing that suits ones
temperament and skills. It's a good primer to read, especially as we start a
New Year.

Happy New Year!

EKS. Imo, when it's to a person's advantage to have a stellar investing record,
lo and behold, that person will never correct exaggerated or isolated
compounding figures nor otherwise correct the impression that the person is a
guru of investing.

I don't for one minute believe Cramer's investing performance of 24% compounded
over 13 years. Never see any reference to audited statements. And from what I
read/surmise/suspect of Mr. Cramer, given that he IS a good investor (distinct
from playing with mad money), some or a lot of his gains are also attributable
to some sort of gaming the system - front running, insider access, planting
articles, etc.

O' Neil (Ten Great Investors). Him? This is a guy who makes his money
investing? Or is it from touting his newspaper and its/his CANSLIM? Another
person with no audited figures that are offered to substantiate. He made big
bucks on Syntex. Okay great, but what the heck. That was 35 years ago; I don't
see anything he done big in the last 20-30 years in stock investing that's made
him even more successful and worth learning from.

i wonder if you have read any of cramer's books. In his first one there seemed
no doubt that he benefited greatly from his wife's expertise who had been
superior trader. he also made a lot of money over time from investing illiquid
thrifts. I believe he could have earned that return over 13 years.

Cramer ran a hedge fund, which has to be audited and send out statements to
clients at least once a year, any one of which could disprove an exaggerated
claim. That said, I have no doubt that much of those gains came from hedge fund
tricks and illiquid stuff, plus Cramer's spouse.

I don't have an auditor but my portfolio has been on SI for ten full years now.
My spreadsheet tells me the compounded return is 28.77% as of today. That
included a couple of ridiculously fat years in 1999 and 2003 and one small
losing year (-7%)in 2002. No idea if it's sustainable over another ten years.

OT: Cramer - I don't have any knowledge about his investment record, just
wanted to comment on his current insights. He may be annoying, but I don't
think he is stupid. And he's definitely worth listening regarding the stocks
you own or are planning to buy/sell, since he does provide valid observations.
Mostly I've listened to him about homebuilders this year and he was definitely
knowledgeable and conservative (he suggested that KBH was probably the only
homie worth owning since it has hugely delevered). You just have to ignore his
crazy outbursts and theatrics. I would not use him as a primary source of
investment ideas though.

O'Neil - again I have no idea about his investment prowess. I recently looked
for local investment meetups (www.meetup.com) - similar to investment clubs. I
found it intriguing that the only meetups I found were Real Estate (OK, those
are officially suffering now :)) and IBD. I can't believe people are still so
big on CANSLIM. I plan to go to one of their meetings sometime just to see what
the heck they are discussing. Charts, oh man...

I've an idea your record is not sustainable.

Large percentage gains off a small base in initial years.

'Course I said similar and worse about Mike Burry. And look where he is now.

-----------------------

I got to see those audited statements to be convinced about Cramer. And I never
see them anywhere.

In '98 or so, when the market tanked, I believe hedge funds or funds or
websites that claimed great success changed. What the owners did was to start
new hedge funds and new websites. Thus essentially wiping the slate clean,
starting over, and ignoring the disastrous year that killed performance figures
they were previously touting. So I'd like to know just what figures on what
fund for what people Cramer reports. I don't doubt that the billionaire who who
gave Cramer his start and stuck with him (I presume), is happy with Cramer's
performance. The people who came later, I wonder. I don't see them complaining
in the media, so maybe they're happy too. It's really all irrelevant though.

There would be two things somebody reporting in the media to have had outsize
gains over a decade or more would be saying. 1.) I get these outsize gains,
they're typical or have been for me, and if you want to duplicate that too,
give me your money to invest. 2.) I get these outside gains, so I'm a guru,
listen to me and learn from me (Buy my books, listen to my show, feed my ego. I
want you to succeed.) With Cramer, from what I've read and what I've heard from
him, if one listens to how he invests (not mad money, not speculating), he
makes a lot of sense. That puts him in the investor group with which I am
familiar. A group where 24% gains for 13 years or more is not common and not
sustainable afaik. To get those 24% gains (if he got them), Cramer went beyond
"investing" with his "trading goddess", his machinations, etc. For me, I am
always looking for what works for the average investor, and these things Cramer
employs are not available or are unappealing. In that sense, Cramer's record
doesn't give any particular reason for listening to him.

--
I have been looking at AIG as a value play. I happened to read Cramer's two
sentence analysis: Stay away. Heavy insider selling will keep the price down. -
And when I checked, I found it to be a compelling reason (so far) to not buy
the stock. (The 10% or more holder seems to sell tons into strength.) I'm
saying although I dismiss Cramer's record, and I can't take more than a couple
of minutes, if that, of his theatrics, I do want to consider his stock ideas as
separate from the man, his wealth, his record, his ability to irritate, or his
questionable methodology. One never knows where a good stock idea will come
from.

FWIW, my results weren't totally skewed by the "early years" - my last four
years were 42%, 32%, 32% and around 20% this year.

The question mark is what I would be able to put up in a year when the markets
are negative again. I like to think I have learned enough not to repeat 2002
but the market is always there to teach us unexpected lessons.

I agree with you and Paul, AHT looks solid to me. I'm a traveling consultant
and really it's just getting harder and harder to get hotel rooms in a major
city at a decent price these days.

For some reason, I hadn't realized the Hotel Reits were pounded until today
(haven't had much powder to play with), and AHT seems to be a solid value in
that bunch. Nice dividend.

I looked at the property list and it looks pretty good to me. No
'one-of-a-kind' properties, but lots of Hiltons and Marriotts that appeal to
the business traveler. And though I don't stay at Hiltons and Marriotts
generally, they seem to have the most loyal customers of the major chains.

That being said, if the Economy slides into a serious recession and the
consulting market goes with it, I could see these kinds of hotels being less at
capacity. But the possibility of a recession is still a question mark to me. In
the meantime, these types of hotels are doing very well out there and probably
will continue to raise rates each year a good 5% or so without issue.

Thanks again for the post.
