I'll add a few more shares Stone Energy (SGY) to my few shares. Of the
several/many oil/gas/related stocks I am following, this is the only e&p stock
I see that is down today. There's no negative news out. OTOH, because other
stocks in the sector are so strong, one might reasonably assume there is a
reason this stock is down. Therefore, rather than add to a weak stock in a
strong sector, the little investor (me) if he even were considering adding,
ought to be adding to the stronger stocks and moving out or away from the
obvious weak stocks.
My shares of SGY are few though, so I can maybe afford to fool myself that the
fundamentals might be okay for the company and that the increased volume today
is a merely a function of people following each other in a rush to exit their
positions.

I will mention though that I am adding - averaging up - on other e&p and oil
related stocks that I have that are moving up. And with the sector being up
again so strongly today, that may be very risky indeed.

This whole sector in the oil/gas/related stocks have had an excellent run. In
particular the large integrated oils including XOM & CVX and even some of the
smaller companies including MRO and OXY have had excellent gains. I am
generally a long term holder (three to five years) and find your value approach
to buying similar to mine. It's pretty easy to identify out of favor value
oriented companies and then wait until they become in favor to sell. I
accumulate shares over time to establish my long term position.

So here is the question. The hardest decision for me is when to sell and
developing an exit strategy. What alerts you to a sell decision and what type
of approach do you take into consideration when selling? I generally scale my
selling into 1/3 positions and sometimes even use cover calls (selling the
strike month after the x-dividend date) to squeeze out additional profits.

Perhaps you can include in your discussions some of your exit strategies for
value positions you have acquired. I try to find special situations that make a
stock a "value" proposition and when the market discovers this look at selling
part of my position.

Any observations you can provide in determining an appropriate "exit" strategy
would be helpful.

This was not addressed to me, so hope you don't mind. :)

I think exit strategy for oils is much more unclear than for other companies.
In other companies, I can see whether something is overvalued. In oil (and
other commodity companies), a company may look overvalued based on current
commodity price, but be cheap if the commodity price goes up (and vice versa -
so there is additional risk if commodity price declines).

Otherwise, I sell when my metrics show that the expected annual return is lower
than 7-5% (depends on company). I also sell if there is a change in the company
that makes me change my mind about holding it.

Good luck

Hi Jurgis - Those are good tips. I try to manage an overall annual return on
the portfolio of 10%, so keeping a company that returns less than 6%-7% must
have a continuing value story for me to hold. I recently sold my large position
on ABS that I accumulated under $20 several month's back at $25 this year
because of the new CEO's recent $2.5 billion purchase of Shaws stores. I just
thought they already had a lot on their plate and were making progress (36
months in the works) in their restructure from their previous purchase. I will
revisit the stock if it drops below $20.

Do tax considerations come into play when developing your sell strategy? I try
to take all portfolio gains as "long term capital gains" unless the story is
really ugly and I need out fast.

Paul, re oil stocks -
I feel that momentum players are running up oil stocks. Under these
circumstances I do not add to my oil holdings and i look forward to selling
some positions, once they reach LT gain status. Oil stocks should be valued
based on forward PE's based on future prices for crude which are lower than the
current spot prices. Apparently, the perception of the oil stock buyers is that
spot market prices will hold or even increase further.

So far, I have not sold any oil stock holdings as the gains in the late stage
of a rally (which I consider oil stocks are currently) can be very significant.
Going forward, I believe that charts may tell when it will be time to take
chips of the table.

Selling is the most difficult part of an investment operation.

Most people sell too soon. I'm guilty of this sometimes too.

For most value situations, I outlook at least a 12- 18 month holding. If
there's a corporate restructuring or transformation, I'm figuring 3-5 years
before results show in the stock. Maybe 5-7 years for completion and top gains
in the stock.

I guess most advisors would say to sell if there's been a change in the
underlying fundamentals or expectations for which the stock was bought. Or if
one sees a new opportunity (stock) that is just so much better than the
currently held stock. (Pig-at-trough investing. I'm not a fan of it.)

Know your personality. I'm a strong 6 - loyalist on the Eneagram circle. Which
means with my nature I might likely stick with a situation or stock longer than
I should. And another danger for me is that I pick the wrong stock and hold it.

http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/eneagram.asp

Here are some ideas I find helpful:

I'm with you in easing out of positions. You use 1/3; I like fifths. Each stock
is different; as long as I can see that management can continue to deliver
results, I generally will hold shares. But if the stock seems expensive on
p/sales and/or p/book I will want to sell at least some.

If I can get people on the thread to offer up a buy or sell decision about one
of my picks, I've found the sell advice to be very helpful. When I can listen
to it and absorb it. (It's often more difficult to convince somebody to sell
something they own than convince them to buy.)

For some stocks I'll have a core position and a trading position.

How about some of you other guys chiming in with an opinion?

My opinion isn't worth that much. Obviously, if I'm a loyalist type and I've
accumulated over 200 different stocks, I'm not one to be giving advice on
selling. -gg-

I don't usually look at tax considerations. Most of the time I hold long term.
In the situations where I sell short term, the stock is either so overvalued

Eric Strohmeyer: A current example, fwiw: Sold my exploratory (very, very
small) position in MDTH today.

Stock is not too expensive on p/bk or p/sales basis, although there's not much
history to compare with. Revenue seems to be expanding at a pretty good clip.
And mgmt says capital spending (relating to the opening of five new hospitals)
has dropped quite a bit. The stock might actually be a buy for value investors.

I'm closing my small position because I'm not that comfortable or knowledgeable
about where the business might be heading. I bought the stock early '04 because
the ratios looked attractive. Very importantly, there seemed to be substantial
insider buying and I could get shares at a price close to what the insiders
paid. In June and July the stock was over $20/sh. Since about August it's been
hovering around $15+, still up from the insider buys. I'm not willing to devote
more time to studying MDTH to see if I should add or hold, and I'm willing to
exit at current price. There's certainly some fear on my part - this sector
isn't performing so well, I don't see where next year's p/e will be attractive,
and I don't want to be in the stock if it drops further.

That is helpful Paul. I have always learned that you can not be right 100% of
the time and there is nothing wrong with booking a profit and moving on.
Sometimes I have a hard time to sell a position because I have worked so hard
acquiring the "value" position at a good entry point.

One thing I do when I begin to establish an entry point on an investment is I
write down my exit strategy. I might utilize a partial covered call position
where I can lock in my 10% annual return goal and then continue to add to my
position as the story unfolds. Like you, on other special situations, I buy a
very small position as it makes me monitor the company (read their annual
report) and basically pay more attention to the value proposition.

I modify my exit strategy (in writing) over the term of the investment and
modify my structured call position or even use naked puts to acquire more
shares. I use both naked puts and trading stock to take advantage of
significant swings when there is a sell off or unexpected positive news.

The best technical indicator I use for buying is the 20 & 50 day
on-balance-volume average. I want this to be at it's extreme lows as this tells
me that everybody has thrown in the towel (blood in the street concept) and I
can buy for $0.50 on the dollar. I also want the company to be near it's five
year lows especially if it's a 3-5 year turn around story.

The real life stories are helpful as every situation is different.

re Selling stocks -
I found that my sell decisions were much less rational than
my buy decisions in the past. In particular, I had a tendency to pocket
gains and play the volatility game. This has worked sometimes but hurt
my performance, in particular during the long bull market in 2003. From Y2000
to Y2003, the average holding period for my stocks has been around 3-4 month
only, and I did not hold any stock longer 8 month during the period.

I felt discouraged to hold on to stocks a long time due to the bad economy,
corporate scandals and my own unsteady personality. During 2003, I started
to reduce my frantic trading and have now a goal of holding on to stocks for
1-2 years. I order to do so, I changed my selection criteria for the stocks -
instead of focusing on value and potential I decided that "quality" (in terms
of
management integrity, balance sheet, track record etc.) is paramount, since
i find it virtually impossible to hold on stocks when i have lost confidence.

Before investing, I define how much money I am willing to put in a stocks
(based on my risk assessment) and depending on the sum, I buy a small position
at once, or larger position in fractions. Accordingly, I do likewise with my
sells.
My cutoff criteria for a low risk stock is 8% return/year with the assumption
that
the market will increase by 6-7% going forward - for higher risk stocks, i
demand
higher returns. When a stocks approaches approx. market returns (based on NPV
with 6% implied
return) I may start to sell chunks of my holding with consideration of the
technical
condition of the stock (charts).

which i have seen happening frequently after a stock declines. i do acknowledge
that my argumentation sounds a bit circular here, but I am careful with stocks
that a starting to decline and have strong institutional backing (still) - i
rather buy when analyst have thrown in the towel at that point, the stock is
held by stronger hands. I'll keep BUD on my watch list but i think it may go
lower to the mid 40's where it has more support, guessing from the charts.

Hi dstange -I use the Street Smart Pro package that Schwab provides. I set up
my time series screen with the price, bollenger bands and MA in the top screen
and volume and on-balance volume AVG on the bottom part of the screen.

You can really use any "On-Balance" volume indicator but it is most effective
over a long time series 36 months. When you can see a double bottom formation
with lower volume on the lower low, the on-balance volume s/b at an extreme
low.

This formation also works on 18 month charts ( 100 weeks) too. The shorter the
time slice, the less accurate the indicator is since it takes several months
for the strong hands to eventually throw in the towel.

When the on-balance volume is at a high extreme, all the news is good, the
stock is near an all time high and everybody is talking about the company. This
is a good signal that the company is probably over valued and ready for a fall
back to its mean price.

Do a simple Google search on "On-Balance Volume" and you will find many better
definitions that I have provided here.

Hope that helps.

My understanding is that the major credit card companies are not permitting use
of of their cards for internet gaming, but I assume this is already factored
into the price of CRYP. I don't know what the recurring revenue stream is for
CRYP's licenses is, but it appears that CRYP gets an on-going cut of the

Stock seems cheap if one anualizes their last quarterly earnings (PE around 5).
IMOS business (as well as it's peer SPIL) is a contractor for packaging and
testing, a very competitive and capital intense business with gross margins
south of 30%. Because of the business IMOS is in, they will have problems to
generate Free Cash flows. For those reasons, I don't like the business
prospects of IMOS too much, but i do acknowledge that it may be a good play on
a recovery in semis.

For a semi company to be investment grade (at least for me), I like to see
gross margins of around 50% or more, which is only consitently achievable by
companies with a sustainable competitive advantage (MXIM, LLTC, ADI,
ISIL,TXN,ALTR, XLNX fall into this category(.

AVZ was the stock that caught my attention as well and i bought a position

However there are some good reasons for the discount:

- US Funds tainted in market timing scandal. AVZ has agreed to pay a 450M$
fine, which is roughly 1/10 of it's market cap.
- US funds appear to be underperforming

On the plus side, we have a fairly low relative valuation. The fund/money

Added PFE doubling prior position at 30.59, similar to ititial cost. I expect
2/3's of $2.5B Vioxx rev will migrate to PFE's Celebrex & Bextras, #1 & 3
Cox-2's. PFE has reaffirmed no evidence of heart risk. This revenue should be
highly profitable since it is incremental to in place structure and thus will
not be accompanied by normal level of expenses, IMO.
Also looked at MRK, but it's multiples are less actractive than PFE's when you
factor loss of Zocor in 06 on top of Vioxx. I guesstimate that MRK @33 without
Zocor or Vioxx is ~17x PE vs PFE @ 13X 05 without factoring additional eps from
Vioxx refugees.
And that ignores the gorilla in the room for MRK: Litigation risk. There was a
good article on Forbes.com today, "MERCK'S LEGAL NIGHTMARE" comparing it to
Wyeth's Phen-Fen nightmare - WYE has taken $16-17B in charges on that, and it's
far from over. The chief lizard from Milberg-Wiess was on CNBC licking his

yield is a plus and with the company growing in the upper single digits, i can
see double digit investment returns LT, if things work out well. Chart looks

Added small to my small position in home builder KBH today.

Home builders continued to take a drubbing today. I'm a bit conflicted with
PHM, the cause of the sector decline. Pulte is very diversified - by home
price, by geography, and by customer profile (e.g. they have Del Webb
retirement business). Prospects seem decent enough to me, although PHM
apparently can't sell their Las Vegas houses at the high prices they were
hoping for, so that's going to impact earnings, they say. Nevertheless, the
revised forward p/e still remains pretty good imo.

PHM is by far my largest position among the home builders, and I'm reluctant to
take on yet more shares. For now, I prefer to keep my risk with this position -
the business risk - where it is. I'm willing though to take on more sector risk
by somewhat upping the small positions I have in other home builders. I am
presuming the earnings warning by PHM is specific to PHM vis-a-vis its business
decisions regarding the Las Vegas properties.

Hi Paul - The home builder cycle may be long in the tooth but it is a sector,
if timed right in the cycle, where you could make tons of money. I think that
ths shipping/tanker sector follows a similar cycle to the home building sector
but rather than a function of interest rates it is following the price of oil.

FRO and SFL continue to hit new highs as oil closes above $50.00.

I hear that the daily tanker rates are at all time highs and during the next
six months is peak season too.

Do you think this time it is a long term trend higher (like what the housing
stocks are seeing?) or is it just a short term bubble? Based on pure value
analysis both the home builders and the shipping/tanker companies have very low
PE's and resonable book value based on the underlining assets. I am tempted to
buy more SFL or even diversify into other tanker/shipping companies but like
the home builders we may have already seen the run.

Any opinion?

EKS

P.S. I have my eye on MRK but am looking for a lower low on lower volume (some
price below $31). This may occur in the next six months on continued negative
news (ie more litigation, bad pipe line, negative WSJ articles etc.). It's
setting up for a perfect value play. You just have to wait for the OBV to reach
it's low and then back up the truck.

Shippers: my opinion: at this point, continue to hold. Somebody might be adding
- I find it scary. But... sigh... profitable and maybe right.

I have positions in all the shipping companies mentioned here over the past few
years. VERY sorry I haven't recently added to FRO. (FRONY from the old days.)
Have added to SFL recently, but looks like FRO was the better, correct bet. I
have been wrong on how far these stocks could move and how much an investor
should bet here. Nevertheless, I have been, and am, in, and I'm holding on. I
count my blessings.

We could talk about FRO and how great a bet it turned out. But if you missed it
- the price appreciation, the spin-off and IT'S rise, the large FRO cash
dividend - ah, forget it. There's only the future, and my guess is ... hold. In
past I have been wrong, quite wrong - it just would've been so much better if a
punter bet more as the stock was rising.

Can't figure if smart money is or is not leaving. These stocks often sell at
low multiples, so bargains may be elusive on such measures as p/e or forward
p/e now. Seems like future still favors these companies. bwidk. Still, as I
say, I'm in for a position. If you've got good reasons for adding/buying now,
let me know and I'll try to up my courage for a few more shares.

re home builders -
it is time to be extremely careful with these stocks, IMO. The housing cycle
looks like it is going to end. Las Vegas was the hottest market and it seems
that the bubble is bursting. South CA is slowing down as well as it seems.
There is a lot of speculation induced demand in the market that will quickly
disappear, when home prices won't rise any more. Looking at PHM balance sheet
YoY I see that cash is down and debt is up to finance the house inventory
(6.6B$ !) which are roughly 2/3 of the balance sheet). Despite the housing
boom, the company does not seem to generate FCF. The question is how much of
the earnings is just appreciation if the house inventory, which in my opion
should be accounted for as market to market gains rather than operating
earnings. If I assume a rather lowly 10% appreciation gain for the inventory
680M$ of the 950M$ in operating earnings is due to market to market gains
rather than the operating business itself. In other words, if the housing
market were flat, about 70% of PHM earning would disappear, if my above
assumptions are correct.

i just bought puts on BZH. i am convinced that the housing market is now a
bubble - accelerating housing prices justify the high prices relative to income
as well as property taxes which over the past 3 years the increases have vastly
exceeded the cpi , wage increases , anything but oil and health insurance. I
remember in late the 60s making some money on the land development companies
some of which went up exponentially just like the home builders. after they
went into the toilet accounting irregularities surfaced such as recording a
sale and booking profits when someone put down a 5% deposit. The thought
suddenly struck me that now one can buy houses buy putting down 0-3% down.
people in my area are flipping houses for a 35% profit in 2 years. if housing
goes down 20%. how many of those people that put 0-3% down are going to stick
around and pay the balance of their mortgages? what will that do to the shares
of homebuilders? with the cost of energy being what it is-many empty nesters
will be looking to downsize in a hurry.
will the 20 something generation want to buy those $400,000 houses?

oil. almost a year ago I said that the sky was falling concerning peak oil
production and I found some stocks to hedge my portfolio against oil production
declines. I thought those stock were overpriced, but i wanted a hedge witha 10
year horizon. with oil now over $50 per barrel, their profitability will be
higher and the stocks have attracted a following. things sure are grand. :o)

I still think oil production is limited and will drop over then next 10 years.
i've seen wall street journal and new youk times articles where experts say
that any supply disruption could cause $100 oil in a jiffy. but they fail to
point out that normal demand increases will have the same effect if it is true
that production is limited (let alone declining).

Hi Paul - I like CSX a lot and there is a bunch of hidden value in the real
estate rights they own on and near their rail right of ways. I know at one time
that they may have sold some of these easements to telecomunication and gas
companies to install fibre and natural gas lines.

Any thought on pipeline companies that might be under valued? I think with all
of this oil talk, natural gas pipe lines and transmission companies might be of
interest. I have accumulated EP (starting buyin in the 3's and 5's) my fair
value estimate is $11.00, MRO I recently sold my small holding but I really
like the company. They have an interesting natural gas pipeline distribution
subsidiary which is over looked, UGI begun buying a few months back at $30 with
a very profital natural gas distribution business and TRP a Candian company
which have natural gas pipelines and transmission facilities in both Canada and
the U.S..

I love these types of companies as they control the infrastructure for
distribution and get paid based on volume of product moved not necessarily
based on the price of the commodity. They also have a lot of intanagibles like
leasing the right of way for stringing telecommunication fibre or adding
natural gas pipe lines (in the case of CVX and MRO).

I believe Warren Buffet last year invested big dollars in the West Coast to
Texas pipe line company (I think it was previously owned by Williams). He got
it for pennies on the dollar when the Enron thing imploded. A very smart value
investment.

Therefore, I am looking for any good pipe line investments that may be under
utilized and at or below book value. Can you or anybody on the board provide
some suggestions?

P.S. MRK hit a new five year low. Will begin buying on a lower low on lower
volume. OBV needs to get more negative. Not enough blood in the street and we
still have a few long term investors holding on. Target price somewhere below
$30 but it's more a time thing than price. Need to be patient and wait at least

Hi Carl - You are probably correct but right now with MRK and PFE they are in a
free fall and the best thing is to wait and watch. The same type of thing
happened with HAL in 2002 with their aspestos litigation. The stock was trading
around $50 and reached a bottom of $8. I loaded up at $9, continued to collect
the dividend and two years latter it has reached a recovery high today of
$35.5.

Check out the five year HAL chart during this period
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=HAL&t=5y

I believe MRK & now PFE are experiencing an extreme sell off which when done
will become excellent value plays. The question is how long it will take. HAL
experienced a double bottom with a lower low on lower volume and took six
months to reach it's final low. The OBV was the statistic I used to guide my
entry point for my initial buy.

MRK & PFE will take a similar amount of time so I suspect by 2nd quarter 2005
we may see some final low . What the final low price may be is anyone's guess.
MRK at $10 or $15? Dodn't know but whatever it is, it will be a huge value play
so I continue to watch. Both PFE and MRK are excellent companies so at some
point the value investor may get a chance to buy for 50 cents on the dollar.

I added PFE today @29 bringing my cost on entire position down to a bit over

problems in shorter studies will evince risks in longer term studies as Vioxx
did. This excerpt from a NYT piece reassures: "Pfizer issued a statement on
friday saying that three trials involving a total of 6,000 patients that have
been under way for several years had not shown any significant safety issues.
The tests are trying to determine whether celebrex can help prevent colon
cancer or prevent or slow alzheimer's disease."
The concerns may benefit PFE by delaying MRK's Arcoxia from being released as
scheduled...in any event, it's highly unlikely a new cox-2 from MRK would get
any scripts.
With the difficult to quantify litigation risk, I wouldn't consider MRK unless

reported earnings for any of the past four-five years - how there can be such a
thing for them as an "economic moat" if they only have the "prospect of
earnings in the future".

Homebuilders may continue to crash and burn. One doesn't really know. DHI - to

that this company knows its business and that if the price is reasonable
compared to financial metrics - the stock is a buy. I WILL bet on its history.
Of course, streaks end, and I could be very, very wrong on the stock. I hope
though, the methodolgy is correct.

Not saying here, one stock or pick is better than another. It's more about how
one might structure one's portfolio. And since goals might be different, there
will be differences in what one expects and hopes from one's portfolio(s).
Therefore, different structuring and consequently different stocks to be
chosen.

Very well said - an excellent rule to remember.

"in my view better to have lots of cash and an economic moat and prospects of
earnings in the future than to have past earnings and not know if they will be
there in the future."

That is certainly a remarkable record Paul- almost too good to be true.
Unfortunately too often i have seen that when a company like that stumbles the
market overeacts and the price plummets. then it might be a terrific buy. OT -
I just received a letter in the mail from my previous mortgage holder offering
to either extend my loan at a lower rate or to increase my loan and take money
out of my equity to use for my cash needs. I assume they are trying to beef up
their refinancing profits and numbers before year end. they have closing fees
of $3,300 which they are kind enough to include in the new mortgage balance if
i refinance at the lower rate . but if i take money out and increase the
mortgage balance it looks like there are no closing costs. but below it says
that closing costs will be deducted from the cash out. oh well it looked too
good to be true. I wonder what it costs the bank to refinance this loan- i am
guessing that their profit margin on this transaction is probably at least 40%.

 re economic moat 
The concept of "moat" which sort of was conered from Warren E Buffet is an
important one. it manifest itself usually with the opportunity (if management
does not screw up) to achieve above average ROI and/or growth rates in the
future. I agree that the rear window view can be very misleading, examples
where the rear view did not work are pharmas like BMY and now potentially MRK.

Unfortunately I think cencept of moat is often misused, especially by biotech
and technology companies. Companies like MLNM have been taking about franchises
even before they had products on the market. In technology, there are very few
true moat companies - examples are INTC, CSCO or the analog semis like LLTC and
MXIM. On the other hand remember ARIBA, HGSI, GLBC?

re MRK, anybody who is interested in MRK as an investment should take a look at
how the WYE "Fen Phen" litigation is working out. The liabilities for WYE are
about 15B$ and still seem to be piling up 5 years after the product recall. I
think it's reasonable to estimate MRK's litigation at north of 10B$ and if you
add to this the lost income strea from Vioxx, the recent haricut for the stock
is not that irrational any more.

FWIW, I like WYE at current levels much more than MRK's P/S is about the same,
WYE has already payed/reserved for good deal of it's litigation and it's
pipeline is much better. MRK is not a buy at current levels, IMO.

Regarding: "the concept of moat is often misused"

Yes, it's one thing to have good rules and ideas. Another to follow them.

If people here actually are basing their portfolio on their evaluation of facts
or analyses regarding
1. Cash
2. Moat
3. Prospect of future earnings

then they'd likely have very few stocks and low turnover. And there'd be little
or no use of stops. After all, if the stock declined - the cash and moat still
ought to be there, esp. if no news was out to change that.

On this thread there are darn few moat stocks, imo. Value investing often means
investing in troubled companies wtihout moats. Even on the Buffett thread
though, you don't find that many people investing in Mr. Buffett's picks, and I
believe he is among the chief proponents for moat investing.
