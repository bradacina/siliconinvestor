I hate to be controversial, but why are so many people on this board fixated
with Warren Buffet?

I think we all agree that Warren Buffet has had a tremendous historical track
record, but I would hope that each of us would try to find our own investment
style and not mimic or be concerned with someone else's strategy.

I believe that each investor should seek to fine tune an investment style that
will work for him or her. This could be a growth strategy, value strategy, or
some other strategy. These could be influenced by great investors, but after a
while I think we should be able to "cut the cord" and be comfortable with our
own analysis.

And what if none of our own investment strategies seem to work, or we don't
have time to do a thorough analysis? Well, index funds are not such a bad thing
...

I don't think you are being "controversial" at all. I agree with you. I hope
you don't misconstrue my Buffett comments as a "fixation" on Buffett.

I posted a reply to someone who thought Warren Buffett is "senile". In
hindsight, my response was not appropriate to this individual.

I am not fixated with Warren Buffett: I would not buy any of his current
holdings except for HR Block -- at a much lower price.

He has been a very successful investor and it is interesting to hear how he
made his money. But I agree with you that we all need to have individual
financial plans to succeed with an appropriate risk/return model.

I much prefer to read about Paul Senior & the regulars on this thread
(TimbaBear) -- and what they are buying.

To be honest with you, I have a lot more interest in Charlie Munger. His
insights, as discussed in OID, are a tremendous resource. But I will stop a
Charlie discussion. I don't want to be accused of a "fixation" on Charlie....

'fixated' seems to be a pretty strong word, but please accept my apology if I'm
the one whose psychopathology offends you.

Turns out that this board is entitled Value Investing. Mr. Buffett is the
greatest 'value' investor alive, and perhaps the greatest investor of all time.
Why not invoke his name and concepts, early and often?

He's never written a formal 'How to' book, yet he is one of the most incisive
and prolific writers on the investment scene today. I would characterize his
communication style as 'reverse Socratic'.

I consider Warren Buffett to be code encompassing Ruane, Miller, Gipson, Mason
Hawkins, Goldfarb, Klarman, Whitman, Brandes, Nygren, Jim Clark and Mike Burry.
-I've shamelessly stolen from them all. But once you get hooked, it's hard not
to share needles.

LauA,

I have no idea where the street is going to let MRK base. Am selling covered
calls on my initial position so it does not matter to me what they do with it.
I like MRK's management plan - they do have partners and drugs in all phases of
trials. What they are doing is building a marketing organization - planning on
making it second to none. If the management is successful in this endeavor the
company should be just fine. A close to monopoly position in the marketing
drugs is attractive to me.

BTW, they recently put up a presentation on their site that communicates the
vision of management. IMO, it is well done.

First, thanks for your encouraging feedback.

Second, fixated was too strong a word and doesn't apply to your specific post.
What I really trying to do is make an observation about the numerous postings
on Warren Buffet on this board.

There is nothing wrong with postings about Warren Buffet, but I am more
interested in stock ideas and insights that you and other posters have. I am
not as interested in what Warren Buffet is buying next or what kind of company
might he like.

This is just my preference --- I'm not out to spark a debate or censor anyone.

"There is nothing wrong with postings about Warren Buffet, but I am more

not as interested in what Warren Buffet is buying next or what kind of company
might he like."

In a brief synopsis:

A stock I have been buying over recent weeks/months has been Phoenix (PNX). The
stock is trading significantly (approximately @ 75% of book value) below its
book value. State Farm owns 5% of the company and will be selling PNX
services/products to State Farm customers in the future. PNX management has
been aggressively been buying back stock. PNX management has intentionally kept
out of the spotlight due to its image in the financial community. That is my
stock idea!

Now, I would like to hear what stock(s) you currently like.

PNX looks interesting. I like book value in these kinds of companies, since it
is usually financially based (e.g. I love cash and and investment). The PE is a
little rich, and I'm not sure what the recent downgrade was about, but the PB
is attractive for this kind of company.

I own some REITs and some microcap stocks. I need to diversify into more
general value stocks, but haven't had time to do much hwk, so only own a
couple. The rest is in index and mutual funds.

My focus recently has been on stocks selling below cash value. You can call
them microcap value stocks or, as my friends describe them, MICROCRAP stocks.

Right now, one of my plays is SOFN. I am hoping they will announce a
liquidation plan within the next few days. I've made some good $$$ on SOFN, but
am somewhat nervous right now.

Here are similar stocks I am interested in:
ISTN, VCLK, ALPH, VNWI, VCNT, PRTS

Instead of giving you a blow-by-blow on each stock, I'll give you the criteria
I used to select them. The basic principle is decently run companies should
sell for at least cash value:

1. Price below or near cash value (with no or very little debt)
2. Lawsuits, accounting problems, and/or other potential liabilities well known
and at a minimum
3. Earnings and cashflow positive or at least close to break even
4. Management that doesn't intent on spending all my money
5. Potential for a catalyst that will allow me to realize the cash value or
greater
6. Decent liquidity and price > 1.00 if possible. (I went against this
principle with PRTS and am currently feeling the pain, but have decided to
stick with PRTS because of its rich cash position. If fundamentals change, I
may have to exit at a loss.)

Joan,

Thank you for directing us to that presentation.

I haven't any idea where MRK might 'base', but I will confess that I've sold
puts at 50 so I won't be unhappy if it dips into the 40's. I've threatened to
sell covered calls, but I've never been able to calculate the return. It would
make me very sad if Mr. Market suddenly took a liking to MRK and I lost my
position.

Perhaps you could share your rationale and calculations on writing covered
calls.

I typically write them when I hate the underlying company. And just as
frequently I pocket the call premium and continue to hold a company that I
don't like. (I got into this situation via an inheritance situation. A stock I
just can't get rid of is DOW. I must have a 20-30% gain on it during the past
year, but I still own it?!#%! I have a tax question: If you have a stock put to
you, you can clearly use the put premium to lower your basis cost. Can you
similarly apply the call premium against the cost basis of a stock if it is NOT
called away. I assume not, but I had a broker whisper to me that put and call
income is not reported to the IRS. The way it was said, I assumed that options
players sometimes didn't report. I'd love to find that it can be construed as a
return of capital. Is that remotely possible?)

If you read through the demutualization filings, you'll find that they had been
living off of VC activities. They got trashed after 9/11 because of pay out

Thanks for your list of 'under cash' stocks. I might point out that VCLK seems

A couple of comments on PNX,

The 12/31/01 10Q report indicates a book value price of $23.51.

The management conference calls address the issue of past venture capital
investments & the past/current/future role that venture capital will play
within the firm. The calls also address management's committment towards
creating shareholder value (i.e., State Farm cross-selling PNX products -- and
the # of customers that State Farm has that fit the PNX-customer profile.)

Regarding the recent downgrade, I don't pay attention to what Wall Street does
with upgrades/downgrades. I pay attention to competition, business
fundamentals, and intrinsic value.

But ValueClick & SOFN may offer more bang for the buck.

LauA,

My opinion of writing calls and puts, is you obtain a stream of revenue and if
the stock goes against your position you have to be ready for the inevitable. I
like to look at the return when I write a call and my current call position in
Merck gives me 9% (this does not include the capital sitting in my great money
market account <g>) including the dividends which is hard to find anywhere
else. IMO, Merck is a quality company selling at a fair price, with management
that has a track record – not an over priced Intel or Microsoft. If the stock
goes down I will buy back the call at fire sale prices and write another one.
If it goes up the risk is it could get called away, but I have the 9% revenue
in the bank. This game can be attractive for capital preservation accounts
looking for above average income returns. My thoughts are you do not want to
play this game with stocks that you have not researched and feel comfortable
holding for the longer term.

My calculations are simple, just take your costs of owning the stock and
selling the call and look at the yield of this capital you receive from the
call and dividends from the company. You also can calculate the yield on this
capital as it sits in your money market fund which is additive. One can also
sell naked covered calls and keep sufficient capital in a money market account
to cover the cost of the stock getting called, With Merck right now this is not
an attractive alternative since the dividend from Merck is better than your
high quality money market rates.

We know when wall street gets down on a sector the prices go down and there is
generally a quality company or two that become an attractive value. The
financials on Merck are not all that bad, but like Buffett points out - it is
the management that is important. BTW, my current position in Merck is a first
third purchase. My plan is to buy the other 2/3 rds positions at lower prices
if the opportunity presents itself.

IMO, anyone that does not report option transaction losses/profits on their tax
statements are asking for trouble. The transaction data is available to the IRS
with a telephone call and IMO not worth the risk. If one writes calls in an IRA
the money is gravy. You can not change the bases of the stock that is put to
you for IRS reporting, since you must report the put transaction and the stock
purchase transaction. Of course the bases of the stock that is put to you is
lowered, because you sold the put.

sure, great investments come rarely. ----Keep taking pitches because you only
have 20 swings.

Buffett is surely famous for his aphorism that "there are no called strikes in
investing." but what about 20 swings? there is a school of thought that
positions should be concentrated because one should have "faith" in one's
positions and also one can't really know well a huge number of positions...this
is the sort of argument Mason Hawkins makes. (recently he said in OID that most
of the diversification benefit comes from just 12 positions). other OID
regulars call for even fewer positions, and i think Buffett is on the record
saying he made his career on like 5 stocks or something (although BRK is
effectively around 100 positions).

while there are academic reasons people argue for diversification effects out
of just a few positions, i believe there are other considerations. i personally
have become more comfortable with the idea of 75 to 100 positions. part of my
rationale here is that this permits a greater degree of asset-class
diversification--in addition to owning a variety of individual issues
(diversifying nonsystemic risk), one can own a variety of asset classes and
also spread the bets around different countries. that is just a personal
preference.

there is another argument (really an indexing argument) against owning a small
number of positions: terminal wealth dispersion (TWD). it is discussed in the
following article.

Buying Bonds as Interest Rates Rise
Sun Mar 31, 9:48 AM ET
By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Economists expect interest rates to go up as the U.S.
economy recovers. So that must make this a bad time to buy bonds, whose value
falls as rates rise.

Nonsense, says Tom Ricketts, president of Incapital LLC, a Chicago-based
company that, through its "InterNotes" program, tries to help ordinary retail
investors buy individual bonds with no-commission minimum purchases of $1,000.

"We don't know that it's going to be a rising interest rate environment," he
said in an interview. "It's ill-advised to try to time the equity market. It is
even more ill-advised to think that with the 'safe' part of your portfolio,
you're going to time the bond market too."

Incapital began offering InterNotes early in 2001, and says it has sold more
than $7 billion offered by four brand-name, "investment-grade" companies:
banking giant Bank of America Corp. , automaker DaimlerChrysler AG , consumer
finance company Household International Inc. and, starting in March, aerospace
giant Boeing Co. .

"A year ago, the question was, 'Is there demand for corporate bonds in
retail?"' said Ricketts, whose father, J. Joe Ricketts, founded discount broker
Ameritrade Holding Corp. . "A year forward, there's no question."

The program, also arranged by Banc of America Securities LLC, is one of at
least two bond programs focused on ordinary investors. Another is the "Direct
Access Notes" program offered by the LaSalle Broker Dealer Services division of
ABN Amro Financial Services Inc.

Both are designed for investors who wish to buy individual bonds rather than
invest in bond mutual funds, and who, unlike institutional investors, cannot
buy bonds in bulk.

BITING THE BULLETS

Typical InterNotes investors are between age 55 and 64, invest less than
$20,000 per issue, and want to capture perhaps 25 to 40 percent more yield than
they can find on safe U.S. Treasuries.

InterNotes carry a variety of coupons (usually 4 to 8 percent), maturities
(usually two to 25 years), and interest payment schedules (monthly, quarterly
or semi-annually).

A majority of the bonds carry "call" options letting the issuer buy the bonds
back in two to five years, in exchange for a higher yield. The remainder,
nearly 40 percent, are "bullet" bonds that require an issuer to make interest
payments until the bonds mature.

"There are always investors who like the callable products and go for the
highest yield they can find," he said. "We're finding more people are looking
at relative value, and we're selling a lot more noncallable bonds. A few years
ago, everyone said you couldn't sell bullets to retail -- all they do is buy
yield. We've proven that wrong."

RISK, AND ENRON

To be sure, corporate bonds still have risk.

Ask any investor in Enron Corp.'s bonds, which went from "investment-grade" to
default in four days.

"I don't think there's any investor who thinks corporate bonds have no risk,
particularly in light of recent developments," said Ricketts. "On the other
hand, I think they recognize that events like Enron are relatively anomalous."

Ricketts said Incapital plans to add at least two new InterNotes issuers in the
next few months. He said four or five individual bonds should give investors
enough diversification.

"You don't need to have 15," he said. "You do that in equities to track an
index, or eliminate all the idiosyncratic risk. In bonds it isn't that
complicated. You should pick a few across different industries with different
credit profiles."

For all you SOFN Phreaks - there is one thing you should know. Ronald I. Simon
sits on the board and functioned as CEO and CFO last year. He's a serious
GREATER FOOL, and a destroyer of capital. I would run, not walk from any
company with which he is associated. His background is seductive - degree from
Harvard, PhD from Columbia; presided over the liquidation of Henley Group.
Check out his record since then. I believe that everything he has touched has
fallen into the sewer.

If you want to read something that's unique, check out the 8-K filed by Western
Water Corp. last fall containing a letter from him. It's astounding because
he's the one who single-handedly destroyed that company by liquidating its
assets at a fraction of intrinsic value. He extracted big salaries and awarded
himself stock options that he sold to unsuspecting shareholders in the public
markets. After cratering the company as CFO and a Director of the company, he
resigns and writes this letter saying that it should be liquidated. I assume
that he's trying to distance himself from shareholder lawsuits.

Reminds me of the kid who murders his parents, then pleads for mercy from the
Court because he's an orphan.

Consider yourself warned.

Joan Rate rise in Aussie Land ?

RBA tipped to delay rate rise
Financial markets will start the trading week on tenterhooks with the Reserve
Bank of Australia board meeting on Tuesday amid expectations that interest
rates will soon rise.

Australia's cash rate stands at 4.25 per cent and the RBA last altered interest
rates in December 2001 when it cut the cash rate by 25 basis points.

However, most economists believe the RBA will not increase interest rates on
Wednesday after its board meeting the day before and will instead prefer to
wait another four weeks until the May meeting by which time further economic
data will be at hand.

Credit Suisse First Boston chief economist Peter Horn said he expected the RBA
would want to wait.

"Let's wait until May although you can't rule out the fact they may have
changed their view on the balance of risks to growth and inflation ... I'd want
to see at least another month's worth of data and the CPI," he said.

The Consumer Price Index inflation data is published on April 24.

Standard & Poor's MMS director of economic research Stephen Kirchner said the
RBA would commence a new tightening cycle following its April or May meetings.

"The choice the RBA makes between the two will tell us something about the
RBA's thinking on the world economy and its willingness to front-run inflation
outcomes," he said.

Dr Kirchner said a rate hike on Wednesday would suggest a dramatic turnaround
in the central bank's view of the world economy.

He said an April tightening would support those who believe the RBA should
pre-empt any surge in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

A change in interest rates in May, however, "would allow the RBA to commence a
tightening cycle with somewhat less flak from the usual suspects in the
business and political communities".

RBC Capital Markets senior economist Monica Fan said despite the perception the
RBA would be pre-emptive by raising rates now, the lack of urgency meant the
bank could wait and examine another month of economic data.

Nomura Australia senior economist Tom Kenny said he would not be surprised by a
hike on Wednesday but it was more likely in May.

"You could make an argument either way," he said.

However, he did not think the CPI would necessarily be the catalyst for May's
move.

He said the RBA was probably more interested in housing, employment and the
prospect that the downside risks to the economy from the United States seem to
be fading.

Mark Rider, chief economist at UBS Warburg, said he did not think the RBA would
move this week.

"I think they normally tend to - not necessarily their first (tightening cycle)
move - but most moves tend to be following inflation data so the usual
procedure would be to wait for that," he said.

Mucho Maas, thanks for your comments and the link about problems with
concentrated portfolios. Given that I generally have over 100 positions at any
time, naturally I'm going to be posting very much in favor of diversification
vs. concentration.

For too many years theorists have just said a small number of stocks - say 15
to 30 - provides as good a risk reduction (standard deviation measure of risk)
as a portfolio with more than that number of different stocks. And there
they've stopped. But to make money, if one is a long term investor (which I
define for this post as somebody who will be buying, holding, and selling
shares of stock for decades - as opposed for example, to the lucky few who
worked at Dell, and by happenstance or skill kept only Dell stock), one can,
imo, increase one's chances of success by holding a diversified portfolio of
stocks: Small cap/large cap, tech/non-tech, manufacturing/financial,
domestic/foreign, growth/value, high div payers & growers/non-dividend paying.
And of course by time diversification. Say 12 to 25 stocks bought each year
being sold not just in that first year, but some being sold in the
2nd/3rd/4th/5th, etc years. (ala planting a garden and reaping the harvest in
the appropriate season).

The link points out that success in the backtest came from holding a few
superstocks like Dell which increased 550 times. The likelihood of having one
of those stocks in a portfolio was 1 in 6. Yes, if a person had (and kept!)
Dell in a portfolio of 15 stocks, the person might become "fabuously rich". My
idea though is that in a portfolio of 60 stocks, 10 might become superstocks.
Now although that's still 1/6, there are 10 possible "superstock" companies
that one could deal with - buy more shares, trade around, sell. Maybe if a
stock like Dell got in there, the 552x gains would be much diluted, but still,
Dell's performance is going to be very, very attractive for the portfolio's
performance. And there might be 9 more very good superstocks in there as well.
Compare this to the backtested S&P groups of 15 stocks, where so many
underperformed because they did not even contain one "superstock".

jmo.

FMSB might work out. Positives include increasing dividends and many quarters
of increasing revenues.

I'll pass on it and add a little today to my small position in WM, another
Washington state-based savings bank (in which Legg Mason has a position too
-g-). It's a stock that's done well in the past as the company has grown
through acquisitions. It's debatable whether the benefits of geographical
diversity and the presumed cost savings of integrating acquisitions are more
attractive to investors than the (imo) resulting complex accounting and
possible treadmill effect (addiction to acquisitions to spur revenue and stock
price). Concomitant with revenue growth, dividends have increased too.

Within the last couple of days I've also begun a starter position in FBP, a
full service commercial bank in Puerto Rico. Here too, there's a history of
revenue increases and dividend increases. While the stock is not cheap at
current prices, I like, and am willing to step up for, the consistent high ROE.
ROA, perhaps a better and key measure in evaluating banks, is okay. (-g- And
since you mentioned Legg Mason,David, they're in it also... but just for .56%)

With both these purchases, I am expecting that I will be trying to hold them
for 3-5 years.

lose the patent lawsuit they're involved with, their growth will suffer (I am

Oops, you're right, I'm wrong. Looks like I misread a price/sales figure for a
cash per share number.

LTD to stated equity is low, but as you suggest, the very large equity contains
an awful lot of intangibles (to be written off?). So the ratio of ltd to "real"
equity will be much higher than the very low figure one sees. An important
point for GMST I too quickly overlooked.

My price/cash number was way too high; consequently there's not any margin of
safety that a high cash figure might supply. Maybe (or maybe not) that ups the
risk of holding GMST here. It could be an important point if GMST spins down
under 5 as so many formerly strong tech companies have.

I won't sell out of the position though. I'll hold on for a while to see what
further developments occur.

Thanks, room222, for your comments regarding GMST and in providing the correct

BMY redux - I've had so many posts on this one, and each time, I've avoided the
temptation to catch this falling knife. It is now trading down about 11% from
the NY close in the aftermarket, at about $33.50. Earnings will be down 25-30%
yr./yr. That equates to $1.69-$1.81. I wouldn't be surprised to see BMY break
30, where it would still possess a 17 multiple on forward earnings. What might
prop it up to some degree would be a juicy (that's relative) 3.7% yield at 30.
The dividend IMHO can be supported even with substantially reduced earnings.
Still wondering where the bottom is for this pharma giant.
Another wild card is that some vulture will come in there, thinking that this

I just couldn't help myself today! I bought ACK (Armstrong Holdings) you know,
the flooring company.

Right up front, they have filed bankruptcy and it's about asbestos litigation.

But I'll tell you, there comes a point when the money is just laying
there......

I get Free Cash Flow of about $2.80/share (I bought the shares today for
$3.32). I get a NetNet valuation of $35.00/share. Even in bankruptcy
proceedings ACK has a Return on Capital Employed of 10% (If I use FCF instead
of earnings it's 14%).

This is a company that filed bankruptcy to stop the onslaught of asbestos
litigations. They have a solid business model, and even assuming the carrying
of a multi-billion dollar debt from asbestos, their cash flow would be solid
for this price point investment.

I backed away from some other companies due to asbestos, but I just had to take
a shot on this one. I'll throw the shares in the IRA drawer and see how they
look in 5 years or so.

Bar Date for Filing Claims
--------------------------
The Court established August 31, 2001 as the bar date for all claims against
AWI except for certain specified claims. A bar date is the date by which claims
against AWI must be filed if the claimants wish to participate in any
distribution from the Chapter 11 Case. The Court extended the bar date for
claims from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service until March 29, 2002 and for
claims from several environmental agencies until the second quarter of 2002. In
March 2002, the Court ruled that the time to file claims related to asbestos
property damage
would not be further extended, but allowed certain alleged holders of asbestos
property damage claims to file a class proof of claim against AWI. Upon such
filing, the Court will later determine whether the proposed class should be
certified. A bar date for asbestos-related personal injury claims has not been
set.

Approximately 4,400 proofs of claim totaling approximately $6.0 billion
alleging a right to payment from AWI were filed with the Court in response to
the August 31, 2001 bar date, which are discussed below.AWI continues to
investigate claims to determine their validity. The Court will ultimately
determine liability amounts that will be allowed as part of the Chapter 11
process. In its ongoing review of the filed claims, AWI already identified and
successfully objected to approximately 900 claims totaling $1.4 billion. These
claims were, primarily, duplicate filings, amendments to previously filed
claims or claims that are not related to AWI. The Court disallowed these claims
with prejudice in January 2002.

In addition to the objected claims described above, approximately 1,000 proofs
of claim totaling approximately $1.9 billion were filed with the Court that are
associated with asbestos-related personal injury litigation, including direct
personal injury claims, claims by co-defendants for contribution and
indemnification, and claims relating to AWI's participation in the Center for
Claims Resolution ("the Center"). As stated above, the bar date of August 31,
2001 did not apply to asbestos-related personal injury claims. AWI will address
all asbestos-related claims in the future within the Chapter 11 process. See
further
discussion regarding AWI's liability for asbestos-related matters in Item 3.

Approximately 500 proofs of claim totaling approximately $0.8 billion alleging
asbestos-related property damage were filed with the Court. Most of these
claims are new to AWI and many were submitted with insufficient documentation
to assess their validity. AWI has petitioned the Court to disallow
approximately 50 claims totaling approximately $0.5 billion. AWI expects to
continue vigorously defending any asserted asbestos-related property damage
claims in the Court. AWI believes that it has a significant amount of existing
insurance coverage available for asbestos-related property damage liability,
with the amount ultimately available dependent upon, among other things, the
profile of the claims that may be allowed by the Court. AWI's history of
property damage litigation prior to the Chapter 11 filing is described in Item
3.

Approximately 2,000 claims totaling approximately $1.9 billion alleging a right
to payment for financing, environmental, trade debt and other claims were filed
with the Court. AWI has identified approximately 200 of these claims totaling
approximately $20 million that it believes should be disallowed by the Court.
For these categories of claims, AWI has previously recorded approximately $1.6
billion in liabilities. AWI continues to investigate the claims to determine
their validity.

AWI continues to evaluate claims. AWI has recorded liability amounts for those
claims that can be reasonably estimated and for which it believes are probable
of being allowed by the Court. At this time, it is impossible to reasonably
estimate the value of all the claims that will ultimately be allowed by the
Court. However, it is likely the value of the claims ultimately allowed by the
Court will be in excess of amounts presently recorded by AWI and will be
material to AWI's financial position and the results of its operations.
However, AWI is not able to determine a range of possible liability with any
reasonable
degree of accuracy, due to the uncertainties of the Chapter 11 process, the
in-progress state of AWI's investigation of submitted claims and the lack of
documentation submitted in support of many claims.

Financing
---------
As of December 31, 2001, AWI had no outstanding debt borrowings under its $200
million debtor-in-possession credit facility (the "DIP Facility") and AWI had
$193.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, excluding cash held by its
non-debtor subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2001, AWI had approximately $8.4
million in letters of credit which were issued pursuant to the DIP Facility.
Borrowings are limited to an adjusted amount of receivables, iventories and
PP&E. AWI believes that the DIP Facility, together with cash generated from
operations, will be more than adequate to address its liquidity needs.
Borrowings under the DIP Facility, if any, and obligations to reimburse draws
upon the letters of credit constitute superpriority administrative expense
claims in the Chapter 11 Case. The DIP Facility is scheduled to expire on
December 6, 2002.

Grommit, my comments on some of the stocks you mentioned:

WM: I'm trying to buy more. I missed getting the price I wanted this a.m., so
I'll wait a bit. (If there are 3 of us on the thread who've made a WM buy this
year, I add WM to the 2002 thread list.)

I still have ABS and SWY. Sorry to say I only started an exploratory position
in SWY when it was lower. I'm holding other grocery stocks as well, and now I'm
also considering making an initial purchase in KR.

Housing: True, there have been some very good moves in the housing stocks.
(multiyear highs) I suspect the conventional wisdom exists that housing is
cyclical (and we're at the top). We see the housing price increases and media
reports of big demand (which some say are indicative of a top or at least
unsustainable). These "facts" all put pressure on us investors to at least take
some profits now. I am trying to keep myself focused on the financials of the
companies and the reported profits and the expectations these companies report,
because I am trying very hard to resist selling. There is still room for
upmoves, imo. (Insider selling that you notice is either normal for these
executives now, or else there IS something they know - like getting out while
the getting is good -g- - that we should be alert too. I choose, for now, to
say it's normal selling.) I've not sold any shares of any of my housing stocks
(stick builders) within the past 12 months (if I can remember correctly).

AMN: I have owned AMN for sometime before your purchase. AMN has bounced around
between 60 and 70 (very roughly) for the past year. At mid to low '60's I
considered adding more, but decided against it. Still, I expect the company to
do to well over the next year or so, so I am holding the stock I do have.

APCC. I read where several professional value investors have purchased this.
And in past, there's been some favorable comment on this thread too. I went to
FRY's to look at surge protectors, and I was amazed to see so many different
brands. That discouraged me from APCC, even though I suspect APCC might (?) be
dominant in other market segments.
Given what I see now in Yahoo, p/e 23, p/b >2, p/s >1.8, not only will I pass
on the stock, I will call it 'shockingly' expensive -g-.

SGR: Really nice move in that stock in past month. I looked at it near lows,
but got scared away with media reports saying electricity costs may come down
because so many power plants are coming on line; the media reported it might be
very possible there's going to be an excess of such plants. (So SGR, which
designs the things, would lose business and the stock would remain very
depressed - I wrongly guessed.)

Brendan Watt, okay, I'll try to slowly follow you out of Moody's (MCO). Sold
1/3 of my position today (also in a non-taxable account). While this stock
might be a Buffett hold-forever, I find the price very expensive around current
level. And, like you, I am concerned about legal attacks on companies with deep
pockets who are associated with Enron.

Sold out of remaining shares of NOR today. It seems to look like the company
has had side business deals with its executives. Given Enron, that's enough, I
am guessing, to have dropped this energy/utility stock to near annual lows.
Enough to spook me too. Last time it dropped to lows, I was a buyer. Not this
time.
Nice dividend yield and potential stock gain from here for those with some guts
and knowledge of the situation (That eliminates me!) who determine that it's a
buy and are proved right.

Freeing up some buying power by taking losses in sales of HLTH, and (sigh) my
1999 purchases of BMY (which have turned from gains to losses). Too many BMY
management screwups this past year for me to maintain an overly large position
in this company now. (For now, I've backed down to just a large position -
large relative to the stock's % dollar value of the portfolio.)

I've started a position in a geezer's stock, CWT. Price looks reasonable, long
history of dividend increases, and div. yield now about 4.7%. In past couple of
years there's been consolidation in the water utility business, so CWT might
appeal to an acquirer. Stock now is suitable for a Mom's Account, imo.

Paul, can I ask you 2 questions?

I rarely post on this board, but follow it, because it is an interesting
insightful board. As much as I look into value, I tend to favor growth.
However, I have taken a somewhat large position in a closed end mutual fund
(TY) trading at about 11% discount, and with an expense ratio of .6%. Seems
like better bang for the buck than an index fund. And I really do mean to buy
and hold this fund.

Anyway, my questions from following this board. You seem to have a pretty
consistent approach to investing.

1. What is your turnover? My vague impression is that you are fairly high, but
high turnover is usually more associated with technical trading.

2. Are you doing better than whatever is the most appropriate benchmark index
fund? In other words, have you found a chink in the random walk theory that you
can consistently exploit?

I ask these questions with respect and curiosity. My own yearly turnover has
been around 30%-50%, and although I have been fortunate enough to do better
than the Nasdaq for the past five years or more (which only means also that I
have gone down less than 65% since the peak), but feel I would have done better
if I had a higher turnover (rather than keeping stocks too long after they run
up). Yet, the theorists are pretty unified in saying that high turnover is the
mark of a misdirected investing strategy. I'm curious to have your thoughts on
this subject.

Hello, jeoffrey Wren: (long prattle follows)

Imo, my turnover is low. Perhaps you are noticing that I post often that I am
starting a new position in a stock, and perhaps you are assuming I have sold
something to replace it. My preferred way to come up with funds is to trim
stocks that seem to be at the "harvest" stage. Occasionally I sell losers in
disgust or panic. Sometimes too, I lose patience with small winners.

With lots of small buys and a few sells, the result is that I hold what most
people would consider an exceptionally large number of different stocks.

My basis is this: I want to buy stocks whenever I find them that seem to be
undervalued, and I want to hold them until they are fully valued. My intent is
to have a diverse portfolio so no one or two or three or four stocks decimate
the portfolio(s). I have difficulties with these wants! -- in determining
undervalued; in figuring full value (it's harder than ascertaining
"undervaluedness"); and now I am having a difficult time in sitting still and
holding on to some winners.

I don't have a benchmark that I measure against. I have a dollar value that I'd
like each of my portfolios to attain by year end. One portfolio that has an
outsize position in BMY and maybe SUNW too is down for this year, and from last
year also, and so is not meeting my objective. All my other portfolios are (as
of a couple of days ago - not today though) at new all-time highs.

I keep wandering around my house muttering to my wife and cats about how I
don't understand how I can still be in the game like this. I believe I have
every single debacle stock of the last twelve months (tech excepted). That's
not possible of course - but I can't now recall one catastrophe that I didn't
own. And since I generally hold on - until the bitter end, I have MANY dropping
into bankruptcy. As examples of debacles, just off the top my head, bot. Enron
@15, luckily (?) sold at 9. Bought CHEZ (a cheese maker for pizzas and a Forbes
best small co.) between 11- 13. I figured you could not go wrong with this
thing - sales up every year - pizzas are here to stay. Investors didn't know
management cooked the books as well as the cheese-- stock closed one day at 13,
and I believe opened up in bankruptcy last month at .02. There's COV which I
posted on a couple of years ago when it was Ogden. Rode it from 10 to 20 back
to 10 to 5 to bankruptcy (last week or so). There's AREM. (In at 15, I've been
selling recently near 1). LDP, mentioned here by me, from about 8 to 30 down to
about 3. ECIL which I really liked (good thing nobody else here seemed to!!) at
24 through 27, I'm now selling at about 4-5. GX, others are in there
somewhere... maybe last year. I have both of today's crashes, CPW and BMY.

Perhaps it's that my winners win more than my losers lose, or I'm merely in up
a temporary cycle for some stocks when the whole investment scheme is based on
ups and downs, and the downs for the portfolios are due to come later.

Given my current frame of mind and knowing something of my personality type,
regarding these losers and turnover, my opinion (for today and subject to
change) is that it's somewhat in my nature that I hold on too long and don't
turn 'em over enough.

fwiw,

Drug sector -
i remember a while ago reading an article (WSJ?) about channel stuffing in the
drug sector. Both BMY and SGP were mentioned as aggressive channel stuffer. If
that is true i would be careful with SGP right now. According to the same
article, the inventory level for MRK and PFE were "normal". Sorry but i don't
remember the source. The article was one reason why i excited BMY at a loss (at
47$), which in hindsight looks pretty good.
I do think that BMY at current prices (32$) attractive. If the price goes any
lower, the company will be acquired, IMO.
The main concern with BMY is research productivity which unfortunately will be
and even more important asset for drug company in the future.
SGP's research appears to be more productive but the channel stuffing issue
scares me, so I am not starting a position yet. MRK has top notch research, IMO
but a very challenging patent expiration hanging over them for the next years.
After the current wave is over, Zocor which expires in Y2006 will start to
loom. I am passing on MRK for this reason as well.

A couple of ideas:

1) One stock I have been buying (interesting volume activity) is "AOC". "AON"
will be spinning off "Combined Speciality Corporation (CSC)" this spring --
most likely in May. Check out the recent volume levels. Due to the new
accounting standards, the expected EPS should be $2.50 for 2002. I am figuring
a $2.20 figure based upon management & pre-2002 accounting standards. This
equates to a current 16-multiple -- without any premium for the pending spinoff
& possible accretive earnings. I am hearing a lot of good things about the
spinoff.

2) I am buying TSCM based simply on their revenue generation. Their new
product, TSCM Pro, charges $2k per year with close to 200-signups (according to
the conference call) on the first day -- prior to anyone knowing what this
product would look like (soft dollars can be used to purchase this product).
Hedge funds are paying $30k per year. Company is offering a number of
pay-for-products. The company is also increasing their enforcement a one-user
policy for subscriptions.

3) "G. Willi-Food International" is an Israeli-based food importer with
approximately a $13 million market cap. The company has over $8 million in cash
& marketable securities & profitable -- selling at a low free cash flow & p/e
multiple.

4) "Ambassador (AMIE)" currently, after their recent spinoff, has more cash
than the current price @ $8.50. The company has, in the past, been very
creative in using money to build up the business. The old Mr. Baseball
commissioner PeterU & his family have run this company out of Spokane, WA. I
sold off the more enticing & sexy spinoff & kept this boring, low-margin
business.

hi, paul --

You say: "I have a dollar value that I'd like each of my portfolios to attain
by year end."

I sort of do the same thing but it's just rank greed/clinging/hoping. This
seems foreign to value investing so I'm curious.

How do you establish the target portfolio value? Why do you establish a target
value? Do you base any decisions on variance around the target?

Passsing on CWT. If the normalized operating cash flow is even $1.50, that
yields only 6.5%. On the quick, I couldn't figure out a way to expect growth
with any confidence. I still like the idea of owning water service companies,
though. Which I don't.

There was an excellent program on Nightly Business News on Good Friday. Because
the market was closed, they did a special on current investment theory.

They said most investors make a mistake in thinking of having multiple
portfolios because of various financial objectives (college education, home
down payment, retirement, etc.). They likened this to someone who gets tips or
a bonus and takes more risks with it. I have seen gamblers talk about being
"ahead" when they have won at the last casino they played at, and they have a
wad of money more than they last gambled, even though their overall cash
position is down from when they arrived in Reno. NBN said people should think
about having one overall portfolio that needs to serve various purposes. One
can set up a Yahoo portfolio that includes all investments.

They said most failings of investment are psychological, and that the way to
beat the market is to invest without emotion and not trade much. One fellow
explained the psychological habit of "anchoring." That is we estimate values of
unknown things from value of known things, and never make a full adjustment.
Thus when we estimate prospective earnings we will always estimate them closer
to historical earnings than we should (either up or down), and this would go
for share price too I suppose.

It's a tough game to play.

BTW, Paul, thanks for your answer to my questions.

geoffrey Wren: I can see how it might not be advisable to have portfolios for
various purposes, e.g. the kids' college portfolio, the retirement portfolio,
the vacation/fun portfolio. I guess though that most people(Americans) will
have several portfolios rather than one. (Their ROTH IRA, the 401K or other
deferred, and the taxable portfolio, for example)

For me, I like to have several portfolios because I don't want all my monies
tied up with one broker. So I will have two or more taxable accounts, for
example. Also I like to see how I'm doing with various investment strategies--
dividend investing, growth/speculative investing, value investing. That's

An interesting wrinkle from last year - I have two portfolios, one taxable with
two accounts and one non-taxable IRA. Because the IRA does not allow shorts,
options or margin, I am forced to "behave" and stick to plain stock buying and
selling. I also tend to buy more conservative, long-term development stocks.

I finished 2001 up a few percent overall - but there was a large gain in my IRA
and a not so large loss in the taxable portfolio - simply because I was tempted
to take risks and trade more in the taxable account. You would think I would
notice after a while that the IRA approach was vastly more successful (and more
important, did not lose much when the markets were folding).

In late February 2002, I was not happy with my small loss for the year and
scoured my trading records for the worst bloopers. Once I identified the
clunkers, I set up rules to avoid those losses in the future and mostly stuck
to them. The result was the best five-week period since the October rebound.

I still don't trade my taxable account exactly like the IRA but I treat it with
much more caution, like I treat the IRA.

And the approach pays off. So far, at least.

Dale... I take the opposite approach. I take all the risk in my Roth and the
long-term conservative stocks in my margin account. Simply because my turnover
is higher on the riskier portfolio and I don't want "the government" cutting my
compounding by taking out its 30 - 40 whatever percent. Also, conversely, my
Roth is stomping on my margin account's performance. I treat the margin account
as a place where I will only put assets that I am willing to hold for a year to
get the favorable capital gains treatment.

FYI, under present regulations I don't do shorts. I rarely do options.

Dale, in the same vein. It's funny how it's often a surprise to people that
when they manage their parents' funds, how much better those accounts seem to
do than the kids' management of their own funds.

It's because the children respect the likely conservative wishes of their
parents - maybe no short-selling or options trading for example. Also because
the kids know they may have some 'splaining to do if a position goes wildly
wrong - esp. if it's a large (concentrated) holding. And maybe because they
(the kids) avoid dinky companies that nobody ever heard about or whose products
can't be seen or understood -- because they (the kids)know that they might have
to justify to their folks exactly why they spent their parents money on it.

I wrote this up here a few years ago, and ever since, some of us mention stocks
we are buying as suitable for a "Mom's account" -- one that a mother would
understand and approve of. CWT, one of my recent picks, is one for example,
imo.

I know a value hound who takes a fairly conservative approach to his whole

Good evening Bob,

Cramer's monthly picks are picking up subscription due to his "magnetic"
personality & his radio show, 3) Gary Smith's charting product is doing very
well @, I believe, $99/month, & 4) the Value product is doing very well.

The Telecom product runs somewhere between $500-$800 per year. I've tried the
free samples of all & use soft dollars when available.

I personally can not tolerate JJC's attitude, but this stock is developing
significant cash flow. The new management team is focused on profits only --
advertising & # of eyeballs are meaningless now & the management team has no
faith in these metrics anymore.

I would love to see a Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Bogle, Schwab type in the

in software for drug development and simulation of chemistry and materials.
At a current share price of 12$, the market cap of 290M$ is more than half
covered by underlying cash (155M$) and there is no debt. The software business
is quite profitable but the drug discovery service is struggling. PCOP
management tried to improve this by "doubling up" the drug development arm by
merging with an biotech company (EOS). This got voted down due to valuations
issues.
It appears to me that if PCOP can sell the drug discovery arm, we are left with
a profitable software company in a very interesting niche trading at 1.5x

(Caveat: I have also been reading all of Graham's books again -- and how a real
bear market reacts.)

1) Energy is stabilizing, & I feel it should decline -- but higher energy
prices will effect industrial profits.

2) Every valuation metric for most large companies (& many mid-cap companies)
are way out of proprortion. Reading about people putting stocks like "AOL",
"TYC" in the value category is a little disturbing. The writeoffs of goodwill,
stock options, and balance sheet manipulation are rampant and continue to pop
up on a daily basis.

3) Interest rates will be increasing over the next few years -- albeit,
probably slowly -- but who knows. I doubt they will go to 0% like in Japan.

4) Insider selling continues.

5) Value stocks, in my opinion, are very scarce. The market is simply way over
priced -- in almost every sector.

6) Investors I respect, (Bill N of Oakmark Select fame), are buying stocks like
Merck. This is a quality holding: top financial rating, blue chip one-decision
stock, etc. But going through the patent expiration review, P/E, P/S valuations
-- I just don't see the same cheapness or value.

7) Every valuation metric, comparing the current coming-out-of-a-recession
timeframe vs. prior periods -- a la 1990 time frame -- indicate a major rebound
is already in the cards.

I'm a firm believer in Graham & Dodd's valuation metrics. I hope the
significant bear market doesn't occur, and hopefully earnings will rebound
soon.

Thanks for letting me get that off my chest! :)

Advice - ignore the big caps, the "market" and the whole macro picture and find
quality value stocks in the mid-cap and small cap range. Lots out there but
most folks never look.

Most big cap stocks are a waste of time or a total fraud right now, with AOL
among the leaders.

<<7) Every valuation metric, comparing the current coming-out-of-a-recession

is already in the cards.>>Just to clarify, by "already in the cards," you mean
already priced in to the prices of the shares, right?
If so, I agree. When you find something that looks cheap, you look deeper and
find out WHY it's cheap...and oughta be cheaper.
<<P/E, P/S valuations -- I just don't see the same cheapness or value.>> I
don't either..but that leads to a broader point: Value is less about P/E, P/S,
P/B and similar multiples and more about the quality for the /E, /S & /B. It's
about recognizing red flags from accounting gimmickry to 'run on the bank'
reputation & 'credit trigger' risks. And evaluating intangibles that may as
robust Coke's brand [Survived New Coke] or as fragile as Enron's reputation.
And it's about recognizing when concerns are overdone on some of the above
issues. It's complicated and difficult. Smart people like you and Bill N aren't
going to agree on these calls.
Graham's early works predated the SEC and covered a time when chicanery was
common and investors just had to get behind the numbers, wait for the fat pitch
and deal with it. Sound familiar?

For those into cautionary tales, but tired of Enron, I recommend WSJ articles
on Xerox's accounting issues. Start with the most recent:
http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,4287,SB1018389042238760960,00.html
and work backwards - there are links to the side and bottom
Don't miss this one
http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB993674133642973302.djm,00.html
What might you get out of this time-consuming read:
A feel for how culture lead to the problems
Internal and external cover-ups by PR flacks, lawyers and top management
Cockroach effect: One problem area, Mexico, indicated many more problems
A lot of people knew there was a problem, but chose not to speak up [Methinks
employees sometimes vent frustration on message boards...what Phil Fisher
called scuttlebut]
Why it pays to listen when a whistleblower pops up...and not quickly buy the
companies' line to discredit same with labels like 'disgruntled ex-employed'

Asbestos: There have been several discussions on companies hit [& bankrupted]
by asbestos. An inflection point may be at hand...or not, too early to tell:
Following is an excerpt from David Faber's report on a deal in the works on FMO
Full article:
http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,BT_CO_20020409_004811.djm,00.html
<<While there are many factors unique to Federal Mogul's situation that have
allowed it to forge a potentially quick emergence from bankruptcy, the
agreement could, nonetheless, become the blueprint by which other bankrupt
companies that face massive asbestos lawsuits, forge a way out of bankruptcy
quickly.
Those companies, such as W.R. Grace (GRA), Owens Corning (OWC), Armstrong World
Industries (ACK), Sealed Air (SEE) and many others, were forced into bankruptcy
after lawsuits seeking damages for alleged asbestos related injuries piled up.
In many of the bankruptcies, the asbestos plaintiffs have laid claim to all of
the equity of a reorganized company. The willingness of asbestos plaintiffs to
accept 50.1% in the case of Federal Mogul may open the door for future
settlements based on the same formula.
The alternative is for the bankruptcies themselves to drag on for years, while
the companies languish.>>
There was also a peice in the NYT: A Surge in Asbestos Suits, Many by Healthy
Plaintiffs
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/10/business/10ASBE.html?pagewanted=print&positio
=top
The companies that file for bankruptcy protection are automatically excused
from lawsuits against them. (By filing for bankruptcy, the companies
essentially agree to pledge most or all of their equity — their assets, less
their debts — to a trust that will be used to pay off asbestos claims. Though
the companies continue to operate, they often have trouble getting loans or
expanding and some have had to cut their work force to save cash. Their current
shareholders are left with little or nothing. In return, the companies receive
permanent protection from asbestos lawsuits.)

<<Biggest downside is very high debt load. But is selling at very low cash flow
multiple.>>Haven't looked at GI, but as a general observation, when debt is
high, consider using Enterprise value [Market value of stock + debt [including
fixed preferred and cap leases] - cash] multiples to 'normalize' the debt
factor. That way you can more meaningfully compare industry players with
varying debt loads.

Dale,

OK, I'll take the your offer: Why is AOL "waste of time or a total fraud right
now"?

I see a company that acquired tremendous media assets
and got cut into 1/4 from the top. I agree that it
is difficult to value, but I would like to hear your
story. How you valued it and came up with "waste of time"?

mrcjmoney: regarding the market and some stocks you mentioned.

I am guessing, but it seems like it's sweet now for value investors here. So
many stocks mentioned here have been hitting new highs (NYSE). I see many from
here that people said they were buying - and that I should have too (but
didn't). A few there that I had and sold too soon. Regrets...I have a few.

I do see a few up there that I still own though.

On the new lows (NYSE)list I count 22 stocks (ignoring trusts, mutual funds,
pfd. shares). Of those 22, I have 7. Yikes. I own 1 of every 3.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?h=1&s=aol+cwp+eln+ets+ldp+mrk+vod&d=t

With a record like that, I continue to wonder how I remain in the stock-picking
game, let alone how I'm able to say my portfolios are mostly doing okay. -g-

Looks like there's no downside to telecom. I added to my losing position in
WCOM today. Also bought more of losers AOL and AETH.

Paul and all,

Sold NAUT today after warning. It may be cheap here,
but I have no conviction. On projected .94 2003
earnings, projected ROE is <10% which is too low for me.

Very likely buying SGP with the proceeds.

I haven't crunched the numbers in AOL because I don't play many big cap stocks;
but even at $20, AOL trades at more than 12x EBITDA with uncertain growth
prospects.

More important, stocks like AOL only go down when the major funds are dumping
the shares. Individual investors don't stand a chance fighting the tape when
the weight of Wall Street is pulling a stock down.

If you have a long-term horizon AOL may be a decent buy right now. I would much
rather put money into mid-caps and small caps at much lower multiples.
