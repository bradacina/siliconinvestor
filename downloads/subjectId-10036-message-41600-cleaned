Yes, that article spurred me to begin acquiring TPLM shares. I'm intending to
build my position. Fwiw, today I added to positions in thinly-traded SROE.ob (a
lot of pv10 compared to enterprise value. Company in LA: not a shale play);
averaged up a little on ROSE(no claim by me it's a value buy at current high
price); also SDCJF. I like Canadian Arsenal Energy (AEI.to/AEYIF) -- It's one
that to me looks like it's undervalued on flowing barrels of oil -- if it can
produce (and at least sustain) it's claim of 3300 boe/d at exit rate '11; 85%
oil.
GasFrac Energy Services works with the oil shale companies. Its technology uses
nat gas instead of water. So there's no issue of contaminating a water supply.
(Might be other issues though (safety?) which I'm not aware of. I continue to
add to my small position.

To the best of my knowledge, FKWL doesn't compete against CSCO, APPL, or NTGR.
FKWL makes USB modems, wireless routers (MiFi not the WiFi router you have in
your house) and embedded modems for cellular systems. I don't think any of
those competitors make those although APPL does have that technology embedded
in some of their products. A better list of competitors would be Sierra
Wireless, Novatel, and Pantech.

Yes, there is a lawsuit between Novatel and FKWL.

The funny thing is I read the patents in the NVTL lawsuit and none of the
patents have anything specific to do with MiFi which is what Novatel claimed.
In fact, one of the patents goes back to the days of analog cellular. I don't
know the details of the FKWL designs but my gut feel is that most if not all of
the patents aren't violated by FKWL. Furthermore, Franklin's sales of MiFi
products are rather small as of this point.

I think the lawsuit is more about NVTL trying to spread FUD.

As a point of reference, I spent roughly 15 years in the development of
cellular phones prior to becoming a full time investor. I also personally have
many patents in the area. Having said that, I'm not a patent lawyer by any
means.

I don't think the FKWL lawsuit has anything to do with the Mifi term. I've

it might better help to explain their products. The lawsuit is clearly about
patents and not about any Novatel trademark.

FKWL announced awesome earnings for the second fiscal quarter of $0.17/share

Franklin Wireless Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2011 Financial Results
Net Income Increases 147%; Gross Profit Margin Rises to 39%
On Monday February 14, 2011, 4:15 pm EST

SAN DIEGO, CA--(Marketwire - 02/14/11) - Franklin Wireless Corp. (OTC.BB:FKWL -
News), the market leader in dual-mode WiMAX and CDMA modems for 3G and 4G
wireless broadband data communications, today announced financial results for
the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 ended December 31, 2010.

The company reported net sales of $15.6 million for the quarter, compared with
$25.2 million in net sales for the corresponding period of 2009. Gross margin
improved to 39.1% from 11.5% and despite the decrease in revenue, gross profit
increased by 110% to $6.1 million compared to $2.9 million for the same quarter
last year. In addition, net income increased to $2.0 million for the three
month period ending December 31, 2010, compared with $821,546 for the same
period in 2009, which represents a 147% increase year-over-year. The improved
gross margin, gross profit and net income were driven primarily by an increase
in the proportion of FTI supplied products (vs. third party suppliers), which
consisted of the Company's U600 and U210 USB modems.

"Despite operating in a very competitive environment during this past quarter,
Franklin Wireless posted solid financial results including substantial
increases in gross margin and net income," said OC Kim, president of Franklin
Wireless. "During the quarter, we continued to ship a greater mix of FTI
supplied products, which was the primary reason for the improved results and we
feel this further validates our strategic investment in FTI which took place in
fiscal 2010."

Diluted earnings per share improved to $0.17 for the quarter compared to $0.06
for same period last year. The increase was due to higher net income as well as
the lower share count resulting from the recent repurchase of approximately 1.8
million shares from C-Motech. The Company expects to repurchase C-Motech's
remaining 1.6 million shares by March 31, 2011, which will further reduce the
number of shares outstanding.

The company's 10-Q filing for the three month period ending December 31, 2010
is on file with the SEC (www.sec.gov).

Re: Avg Daily Volume Sector screens

I talked w/ Schwab and through their Street Smart Pro platform, using their
stock screen module, you can create a dynamic list that creates the current
volume/Avg Daily Volume Rank list.

I added a column to the information to list the Industry Sector so I could sort
the candidates by Industry. When you add a column showing the % change from the
previous day, you can further sort your list by stocks that are up and stocks
that are down.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MNOV,LEI,RAME,LXU,TPLM,FUBC,INVE,AAIGY.PK,NKRSF.PK

The list has 9 candidates that are gaining on heavy volume, 4 Oil & Gas, 1
Biotec, 1 Chemical, 1 Bank and 1 Electronic

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AUAYF.PK,DPM,EVEP,DX,CLR,CODGF.PK,FN&d=s

Seven candidates for the largest loosers on heavy volume include, 3 Oil & Gas,
1 REIT, 1 Electronic

It's an interesting study. I thought there might be more Oil & Gas candidates
with unusual heavy volume that might be good adds for my E&P basket.

DCP Midstream Partners LP (DPM) shows heavy volume as they announced a
secondary offering totaling 3.2 million shares at $40.55/share.

FKWL. I can justify to myself a very small buy. The company's past few years of

allow that. I'll take a few shares now.

I seem to live in a 1G world, if that's even possible. I don't know diddly

might be superseded by somebody else.

I like that FKWL has r&d and manufacturing facilities in Korea. Isn't Korea the

Hi Lazarus -

Pretty good move today on your Tengasco Inc. (TGC). Up 31% on almost 10X it's
average volume. Don't know if you held any of your $0.45/shares from 7/2008.

I am not too sure if it's hidden value finally getting recognized or just
clueless buyers buying the momentum. Many of my small E&P companies broke out
today w/ this one on similar or heavier volume.

After screening the group to determine if these are isolated cases or just part
of a group, I have concluded that it was a very selective group that
participated.

Here are the other E&P stocks in your select group that showed unusual heavy

It's all about Volume and the Flow of Money

From the Bearbullwaves.com web site
http://bearbullwaves.com/OnBalanceVolumeTheBasic.aspx

"...There are many indicators available to measure volume and the flow of money
for a particular stock, index or security. One of the most popular volume
indicators over the years has been the Accumulation/Distribution Line. The
basic premise behind volume indicators, including the Accumulation/Distribution
Line, is that <u>volume precedes price</u>. Volume reflects the amount of
shares traded in a particular stock, and is a direct reflection of the money
flowing into and out of a stock. <u>Many times before a stock advances, there
will be period of increased volume just prior to the move.</u> Most volume or
money flow indicators are designed to identify early increases in positive or
negative volume flow to gain an edge before the price moves. (Note: the terms
"money flow" and "volume flow" are essentially interchangeable.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think this heavy volume reflects the beginning of a "new" significant bull
move in these stocks.

I will be looking to add to my positions on any sell offs.

Hi Lazarus-

Here is my first take on Seychelle Environmental Technologies, Inc.

Re: SEYCHELLE ENVIRONMTL (SYEV.PK)

The first thing that popped out for me was their PE of 7. The company is
profitable and for 2010 had sales of $4.255 million compared to $2.439 million
for 2009. That's a 75% increase YoY so they are definitely in their growth
phase.

Four customers accounted for 65% of their sales in 2010. I suspect these are
large retailers. This is up from 50% in 2009. They are on track to generate
$228K in sales from their Web store next year which represents 5% of their
total annual sales. I believe this will be a very big and profitable segment of
their growth.

Their overall net profit margin is around 23%. Based on their 25.88 million
shares outstanding, every $1M in sales generates about $0.01/share earnings. In
2010 they earned $0.04/share and based on today's close their PE is around 7.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=SYEV.PK+Key+Statistics

They do sell replaceable water filters which could eventually be a future
consumable product but currently I see their product(s) limited to one time
"buy" items. Therefore, they really do not have a customer base that are repeat
buyers/consumers like with the Armanino Foods product(s).

Armanino Foods of Distinction Inc. (AMNF.PK) operates with a 16% net profit
margin on $24 million 2010 sales. They are about 5x larger (in sales) than
Seychelle and continue to grow their business at double digit rates (about 11%
for 2010 vs 17% in 2009).

The big question for me is how long and by how much can Seychelle Environmental
Technologies, Inc. grow their sales. They booked an incredible 74% growth in
sales from 2009 to 2010.

This is a cheap stock price now selling at 7 PE. Assume they increase their
sales by 50% in 2011 (from $4.255 million to $ 6.38 million) and get recognized
by the market and are priced at a 15 PE (only 30% of their growth rate). That
type of valuation would price the stock at $0.96/share or make it a 3 bagger
from the current price of $0.31/share.

I bought several items from their Web site today and am considering starting a
tracking position.
<img src='http:////store.seychelle.com/icon-img-stainless-categoryb.jpg'>
http://store.seychelle.com/

I prefer Armanino Foods of Distinction Inc. (AMNF.PK) with their consistent 5%
dividend (43 consecutive payments), expanding profit margins (more efficient
facility operation), modest growth rate at 11% (w/ expanding national
distribution) and potential for repeat sales (food is a consumable) providing
many years of increased growth opportunities. Armanino Foods could even start a
Web site to sell gift baskets that would include their new high end cheeses
which would further expand their margins through direct sales.

In summary -

Armanino Foods of Distinction Inc. (AMNF.PK) could see a 40% gain in price next
year with my estimate 2012 sales at $23.3 Million generating $0.11/share. If
their forward PE reflects their two year growth rate (ie @ 11%) then 2012 price
s/b $1.21/share.

Seychelle Environmental Technologies, Inc. (SYEV.PK) could be a potential 3
bagger next year. If they increase their 2012 sales by at least 50% to $6.38
million and maintain their current 23% profit margin, they should earn
$0.0587/share in 2012. To achieve a 3 bagger status, the market must assign a
17 PE to their earnings which would make their price $1.00/share. Even at a 10
PE the stock should sell for $0.58/share or 89% higher than the current price
of $0.31/share. Thats still a very good risk/reward speculation!

I can see value in both of these companies. The stock shares of both companies
are thinly traded w/ average daily volume around 25K shares. If one is a buyer
of shares be sure to use limit order(s) and be patient on your fill.

For completeness - he believes that some reverse merger companies are real, but
many are not. Also for the record, to pull the SEC equivalent records from the
Chinese operating subsidies you need to go through and Chinese law firm - you
can't pull them yourself (That is why my lengthy google searches where
fruitless).

One of the key parts from the interviews:
What role do auditors play generally in reverse mergers?

In many cases, the U.S.-listed company and its subsidiary in China don't have
ownership of the operating company in China. They just have a contractual
arrangement that mandates that the operating company in China transfer profits
in the form of regular payments to the China subsidiary of the U.S.-listed
company. If payments don't occur, the consequence is that cumulative profits
have not been transferred into the corporate structure that encompasses the
U.S. shareholders. That should raise red flags with the auditor. It could be a
signal that management intends to drain money from the company. But the U.S.
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board doesn't appear to be ensuring that
auditors are verifying these payments. That is a major problem that hasn't even
come to light yet.

Hi Spekulatius -

Do you know if the larger JV's (ie. DuPont and Corning) operate in the same
way? Both DuPont and Corning have spent billions with their Chinese JV partners
on factories and R&D facilities which I would assume provide some type of
ownership rights (at least through the subsidiary operating company).

I do know that the way Chinese handle property rights are much different than
in the U.S.. The Chinese government has been know to just take property for
their own interest w/o compensation to the previous owner(s) (ie no eminent
domain laws).

Perhaps it all comes down to enforcement. If a deal goes sour, the U.S. entity
has no real legal recourse as long as the Chinese judges (ie. Gov) trumps all
other agreements.

It reminds me of how they do business in Russia.

The Chinese have ownership rights. I have heard about disputes (there was an
example with Nestle a while ago) but i have not heard about an example where
foreign companies ended up with nothing.

Most foreign companies try to own their entire operation outright if they can,
since JV are always a can of worms.

Well I see we have the honored rhetorical device of put-down in play. I am
check-mated by your reasoning power. Now that you have corrected me, I will
nonetheless continue to do what I have done, which is not invest in Chinese
companies. Feel free to do so yourself.

As to who history will prove right, it is not a matter of a few years. A few
years is just trading. Madoff kept his scam doing for many years. Ultimately it
is about getting money out of an investment. I am down on China because the
government countenances theft of foreign investment, countenances theft of
foreign patents, because their securities laws and audit practices are a joke,
because Chinese companies will always be favored there, and because it is
inconceivable to me that when the US devalues its currency to avoid giving real
money to the Chinese, that the Chinese government will not sit idly by and
allow US investors to reap good dividends on Chinese investments.

That is an opinion. If you do not like it, ignore it.

I think I made the comment either here or on another thread a month or so ago
that as a CPA (I no longer practive public acctg), that type of structure with
Chinese companies was what would worry me. It is an invitation for fraud that a
normal audit typically would not discover. This is how CCME is structured

 In many cases, the U.S.-listed company and its subsidiary in China don't have
ownership of the operating company in China. They just have a contractual
arrangement that mandates that the operating company in China transfer profits
in the form of regular payments to the China subsidiary of the U.S.-listed
company. If payments don't occur, the consequence is that cumulative profits
have not been transferred into the corporate structure that encompasses the
U.S. shareholders. That should raise red flags with the auditor. It could be a
signal that management intends to drain money from the company. But the U.S.
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board doesn't appear to be ensuring that
auditors are verifying these payments. That is a major problem that hasn't even
come to light yet.

Executives at C&K and Supervalu could not be reached for comment.

C&K operates 61 stores, of which 40 operate in Oregon and 22 in Northern
California. Although the chain's total volume is estimated at $460 million, a
Unified spokesman said the member-owned cooperative would lose "less than 3%"
of its $4 billion volume.

Minneapolis-based Supervalu will reportedly supply C&K's stores out of a

Callon Petroleum Co. (CPE) is one that is trading down today (off 6%). They did
a secondary at $7.75/share last month that increased outstanding shares by 30%.
Company has operating offshore wells in the Gulf (may have impact from drilling
moratorium?) and recently have working their interest in onshore well
development.

I like the company since they generate income from their offshore wells which
finances their onshore E&P operations. They announce earnings tomorrow. The
street expects break even.

Their reserves are 60% oil, 40% NG. They have been paying down debt (down 50%
from last year) selling non core properties.

Here is there most recent presentation February 22, 2011:
http://www.vcall.com/IC/newCoLocated.asp?ID=163294

I have two different buys in January 2011 and February 2011 at an average cost
of $7.35/share.

I hold this based on their long term value prospects w/ their proven reserves.
Stock ready to break out and my longer term target based on 2006/2007 price is
$14.50/share.

2011 CapX is going to be increased to finance 44 wells (vs 22 announced
earlier). Proceeds from their secondary will be used to pay down debt and pay
for 2011 & 2012 E&P well development.

Didn't know if you had an opinion on this one?

I'll look again at it.

I've added today to PXL.v yet again.

This one may be among the cheapest oil stocks in my purview.

Depends though, of course, on who and how one figures these things.
For me:
Basically, the company expects 1.9k-2.0k boepd production in 2011. That's to be
97% oil. Heavy oil. Which some people discount by maybe $20 per barrel compared
to more desirable light oil. I've read other people say, no, no discount should
be applied. I do not know.

I show company with 40M fd shares and 12M in debt. At 2 bucks a share, EV =
$92M (roughly). There are another 12M "special warrants" which can be converted
@ $1.90. I'll just add that to the stock base and call EV $92M+$23M = $115M.

2k bopd for $115M. That's pretty cheap to me. I'm just not seeing numbers like
this for any other Canadian company that's producing oil in Canada.

Some negatives and some assumptions:
I assume they can meet their production targets. (They did slip a little with
2010.) I'm not sure, but it seems like they have enough oil reserves to at
least continue 2011 production levels in 2012.

No pink sheet for this stock, so it has to be bought as PXL.v.

Stock's already moved up recently. Seems to have stalled. Maybe that's now as
far as the stock will go until positive production news is published.

Cheniere Energy Shares Plunged: What You Need to Know

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/03/08/cheniere-energy-shares-plunged
what-you-need-to-kn.aspx

From the article:"...What: Shares of liquefied natural gas infrastructure
wrangler Cheniere Energy (AMEX: LNG) are going up in smoke today, losing as
much as 20.8% of their value on about three times the average trading volume.

So what: The heavily debt-burdened company just filed a lawsuit against hedge
fund Centerbridge Partners, which claims that a Cheniere subsidiary is in
default on its senior debt notes. At issue is a complicated money flow between
Cheniere Energy, subsidiary Cheniere Energy Partners (AMEX: CQP), the central
Sabine Pass operation, and marketing entity Cheniere Energy Investments, and
whether or not such transactions qualify as GAAP revenue for Sabine Pass.

Now what: My head hurts from this shell game of Cheniere entities. I can't tell
whether the debt should be repaid immediately (which none of the business
bodies can afford) because it's actually in default, or perhaps Cheniere's
proclamations of innocence should win the day. But either way, management tells
us that the default claim alone is damaging Sabine Pass operations, and
financial damage will follow. I sure hope you don't have your entire nest egg
hooked into the juicy 9% dividend yield on Cheniere Energy Partners, because
this looks like a 50-50 chance of that yield evaporating in short order....".

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I like the industry but according to the article the company could technically
be in default of their senior notes (for one of their subsidiary companies).
When the dust settles it may present a buying opportunity.

I closed my naked March $12.5 Puts which I sold in 8/2010 (rather than buying
the stock). Made some money but avoided the land mine.

Hi Paul -

Still holding the ATO I bought 5/7/2010. Never added to my small lot. I still
like the over all NG theme and do notice that their PE is coming down from 17
to a forward PE of 14.5. The stock has however, broke through my yield criteria
of a minimum of 4% (current yield is 3.9%). I am going to continue to hold my
position looking for a dividend increase in the future.

If the yield goes lower to 3%, I probably will move the monies into MDU
Resources Group Inc. (MDU). MDU has one of the largest underground NG storage
infrastructures in the U.S..

Thanks for the heads up on your sale as many of these value utility buys over
the last 18 months may have had their run and the monies could work better else
where. I did notice that Black Hills Corporation Common (NYSE: BKH ) had a good
move up today and is slowly getting to my $35.00/share fair value price target.
I was tempted to sell my lot earlier this year but continue to hold until we

Lately I have been looking at growth stocks trading at lower PE's. In other
words low PEG's. That's value, right? Not where I have been lately, but seems
there are some opportunities opening there. Of course the problem there is if
the anticipated growth falls off.

Did get a small amount of AMNF.PK. But I always have concerns about a thinly
traded stock with the market maker keeping high spreads (e.g., 7%), but if one
likes the potential of microcaps, that problem often comes with the territory.

Did get some FKLW.OB on the same theme. I believe the pitch for it that alerted
me to the stock was on this board.

Got some UTHR after a Wall Street journal article being positive about it
alerted it to me.

Tried to get some HITK after researching UTHR and finding also in the low PEG
range. But I have been too cautious in my bids, so missed buying any so far.

At to SVU, I do follow it, and if the price dropped a lot I would probably get
in. It may be a value stock, but they do seem to have a lot of problems in
execution. It concerns me that they are not transparent on how well the various
supermarkets they own are doing, particularly the smaller ones they are opening
now. So for now it is intriguing, but I'm holding off.

Hi Spekulatius -

You do provide a balance of caution for this board. Back on 8/21/2010 when I
was excited about CQP researching plays for my NG themes, you provided a
general word of caution regarding MLP financing debt spreads. (
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26769754 )
<u>
"...However those MLP's are very dependent on credit markets (or the spreads)
that are at almost record lows. I think the MLP's mimic the bond bubble. I
would not advice putting new money in this sector...".</u>

It looks as though CQP's heavy debt financing needs and the way they
constructed their pass thru distributions to their LLP companies may have
invoked an immediate payment clause on one or more of their senior debt
covenants. Lawyers on both sides will have to argue their case.

It does go to show how fragile the financing can be for some of these leveraged
MLP's. It was only 18 months ago that the entire credit markets were frozen.

from the little score i keep in my head, the shorts are right more often than
they r wrong so i wouldnt take a lawsuit being filed as a reason to buy the
stock.

slw was and is a play on silver prices going higher. when i brought it to the
thread its was about $11 and the price of silver i think was about $14. the
price silver dropped to maybe 8 and the stock tumbled down to $4 and change.
sometime along the way I pretty much said that I believed that if silver went
to $20 SLW would be worth at least $20 and would probably sell at a premium
because of its size and being a unique vehicle as a leveraged slver play. this
stock has certainly exceeded my expectations and although i continue to believe
silver is headed higher i have hedged and reduced my position a bit.

aab.to is a different kettle of fish entirely- despite being up maybe 200% from
its lows it continues to be a value stock with significant upside. I just added
a few more shares last week.

I dont understand the energy space well enough to know whether these small E&Ps
are mo-mo or value but I suspect the former.

OTOH the ceo of MHR was on "taking stock" last night and I thought he presented
himself quite well.

In a couple of other segments i watched on tv- the internet analyst at Citi
spoke highly of GOOG. thought the company would generate cash flow of $40 in
2012.

and a venture capitalist and bloomberg contributor noted that GOOG and Facebook
were the two dominant companies in the world today. Now that would make GOOG
selling for less than 12X cashflow net of cash a year down the road. that seems
really cheap to me.

As for other value stocks, I seem to be a lone voice in the wilderness touting
the small chinese stocks as value plays.
a few years from now, I believe some of these stocks will have moved up
considerably and time is usually on the value investors side.

re CSR - pretty vague proposal, imo. No financing in place, which i think is
the big sticking point.

Essentially the buyout would probably also bail out the major shareholders
since they would tender their shares as well. So for them it's a no loose
proposition. however the sticking point is if they find somebody to put down
the funds to finance the whole thing with debt.

Same as HRBN where it seems that debt financing cannot be secured or at least

Looks like the makings of more bad pr and class action suits. the offenders
incude Bank of America and JP Morgan.

finally discovered that investor hub has a pretty good thread on GFRE for those
who are interested. learned that there is a 15% holder of gfre stock that is in
court to avoid the lock-up provisions in their deal. on the plus side the
latest salt purchase from the chinese govt had never been explored for bromine
before and under the terms of sale gfre is required to look for bromine there.
the demand for bromine in china is likely to continue as bromine is required in
coal plants for which demand is growing in china. should be an interesting
decade for this company.

I took a look at HRBN on finance.yahoo.com. Doesn't seem to have the Q4
figures. But from looking at the Q3 figures, it seems that they have less debt
than CSR

HRBN balance sheet looks OK, just as it does with most Chinese microcaps. They
also try to do a debt financed buyout like CSR, where they of course also buy
out the management shares at the same price as well. So it's a LBO - the
problem is that they cannot seem to come up with the financing.

I took a look at AGNC too. Seems to be good value at first glance but this is
true for all the other REITs as well (take a look at NLY for example).

From what I understand, these REITs invests in Agency MBSs, so with the low
interest rate environment that has been prevalent for the past couple of years,
they have minted! AGNC is relatively new when compared to NLY, but I think they
have the highest divi yield around for now. In terms of a divi play they're
good as they pay quarterly divis (though some REITs like ARR pay monthly
divis).

Following on from the point I made about the low interest rate environment...it
stands to reason that if interest rates increase, then these REITs would start
to feel the pain. Therefore you will probably see a decrease in the divis that
they pay out, though that is just my opinion as I have not really done any
meaningful analysis.

Many pundits are predicting that interest rates are going to increase after QE2
ends in June, and that will probably be bad for MBSs.

I don't buy major banks, i buy the small one very selectively. most stuff is
too small to even mention here, like my adventure with FMNB.OB (I still like
and own this outfit but have reduced my position by about 1/2).

I sold out of HCBK because of disclosures regarding interest rate risk and
trouble with the OFS. I never argyue with a regulator so I sold (at a loss). I
do think that banks like BK with very little risk exposure are worth a look (I
own quite a bit). Insurance companies like TRH, ALTE, trade at <0.8x tangible
book which is a steep discount to historical valuations of 1.2x. this is where
I see straightforward values ( recently added TRH).

Boring day, i see nothing to buy or sell. If we get at 15-20% haircut, which i
think is well in the cards given the crosscurrents, then it's going to be a
different story.

Let's see - Greece was downgraded yesterday (doesn't matter much), Spain today
(matters a little more), Crude above 100$ (matters even more still), Gaddafi
bombing his people and his oil ports ( does matter since Saudi's have spare
capacity) and Saudi's shooting their own people (ohh wait a moment...?). Today
is an exception but i have never seen a market so ignorant of macro risk.

FWIW, US downgrade is overdue and only a matter of time. i don't it's going to
stop with AA either. Of course i do not know if it matters or not for the
stockmarket LOL. Maybe it's a good idea to keep your silver and gold stuff, as
much as I hate to admit it.

Took a quick look at APNX and INMG. Both look like promising businesses.

Questions over both though. APNX seems to have an ok balance sheet, but its
debt levels are way high. Its interest servicing obligations over the next year
are about 500k, and for the next 2-5 years about 1.2m. However, it only
generated 143k in cash for 2010. This fact coupled with rising fuel costs
raises doubt over how it can address operating costs. Though in saying that the
price moved from .11 to .14 today, so not a bad gain in a day's work.

INMG I am more comfortable with, as it, has less debt, and if it has recurring
business, chances are its going to stay profitable. Due to rising food costs,
somehow I am of the opinion that their business will be required more and more
by the food and agricultural industry in general. In saying that apparently the
price moved up by 30% today, so not sure if its shot its bolt...

OT- Spekulatius,

My reasoning is that we have major inflation in all the wrong places.

I completely agree with you.

Enough said, this does not really belong in a value thread.

I disagree. I think these posts have a place here bc proper market timing is an
important part of value investing (as long as it's not in the context of swing
trading)... especially since macroeconomic and geopolitical trends have set the
market tone in every nook and cranny recently. Paul Sr. himself often posts
"DOW up/down x% I think I'll reduce/add to these positions...".

FKWL - great "earnings" and yet OCF is negative. Tons of adjustments for OCF
vs. earnings too. Both yellow flags for a small company.

Cash on books is positive.

Customer concentration is a big issue. MikeS implies that Sprint will buy even
more, but if sometime in the future they decide to diversify suppliers, FKWL
can lose a bunch of business really fast.

I'll pass.

Oh, BTW did they remember to pay their royalties to IDCC? ;)

SYEV -

6.5M warrants outstanding. 4.5M of them included in diluted share count. IMO
slight negative.

Reverse merger company. Not Chinese though, so it must be OK. :P

Company restated financial results for 2009: "On August 27, 2009 the Company
was informed that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB")
revoked the registration of Moore & Associates who was serving as the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm. The revocation was a result of
Moore’s violation of PCAOB rules and auditing standards. As a result, Moore &
Associates was not licensed to issue an opinion on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2009. During the
reaudit of the 2009 consolidated financial statements, we identified
misstatements to our previously filed financial information as reported on our
Form 10-K as filed on May 22, 2009. These misstatements during fiscal 2009 were
the result of the improper recognition of an airplane recorded as an asset held
for sale within current assets and a corresponding related note payable
classified within both current and long-term liabilities in 2008. The Company
ultimately disposed of the airplane and recorded the sale. The Company also
incorrectly classified warrants issued on settlement of amounts due as prepaid
expenses in the amount of $56,243. Certain amounts reported in the income
statement were also reclassified. The restatement reflects the reversal of all
transactions related to the acquisition and disposal of the airplane that was
never in fact owned by the Company." - well, it's not a Chinese reverse merger
co, so these are not the droids you're looking for... wait, airplane? No, never
mind. :)

Lots of sales to emergency relief and NGOs. I am not sure whether to count this
as positive or negative. On one hand, these could be considered "sophisticated"
buyers. On another hand, these organizations are sometimes persuaded to buy
either inferior or overpriced products.

Company uses and plans to use MLM for sales...

"As of February 28, 2010, we had a President and two (2) executive employees
managing the Company with two (2) administrative employees supporting that
effort. In assembly, operations and warehousing we had two (2) full-time
employees and two (2) independent contractors working to fill orders. " - so 8
employees equals multimillion dollar co with "over 100 years of combined
experience in developing improvements and innovations in the field of bottled
water, reverse osmosis, ultra filtration and filter technology."...

On the positive side, CEO, EVP and CFO take very little salary. 44% shares are
held in CEO granddaughters' trust. Granpa wouldn't defraud his little ones,
would he? :) Ah, but the grandkids provide valuable consulting: "During the
nine months ended November 30, 2010, payments totaling $58,999 were made to the
TAM Irrevocable Trust as compensation for consulting."

Obviously if the company continues to sell its bottles like pancakes the stock
is cheap... :) I'll skip it though.

Can anyone explain to me how they manage to pay 18.6% dividend?

AGNC is basically just a pool of capital used to speculate on interest rates.
The fund manager borrow short term (~1 month, paying maybe 0.6% annual
interest) and invest the money in longer term notesw (perhaps 2 years, earning
2.8% annually). The pocket the differential (2.2%). They then leverage that
position up 7x or 8x. As long as their is a big gap between short term and
longer term rates, they'll be fine. If rates change in a way that they don't
anticipate, then they may run into trouble.

So it's not really a business, just a highly levered pool of money.
