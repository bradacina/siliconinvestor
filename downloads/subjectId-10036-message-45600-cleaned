Hi Tonto -

Who are the major players and are their any specialty suppliers that we should
look at? I know from the several mining companies I own, they have special
requirements and the expenses charged are very high. It may be too late in the

Michelin - specialty business, which includes tires for earth moving equipment,
motorcycles and aircrafts are about 20% of the revenues in 2010. it's profit
margins are probably higher than that is the standard business lines.

There is no question that tire manufacturing is a tough business but it's
better than it used to be - apparently the competitors are more rational with
their pricing and roll over input cost increases to their customers. This is
probably a result of the consolidations that have been playing out in this
sector for 20+ years. The emerging market exposure is another plus.

But the main attraction is the very cheap valuation - ML.PA has a market cap of
~8B Euro right now, but generated earnings of 670M Euro in the first 6 month
alone. That in combination with the low gearing (<2B Euro in net debt), 8.7B
Euro in book (~8B Euro is tangible) it's very cheap by almost any value metric.
There are ancillary business like the Michelin guides and Michelin maps which
may be worth something too, I suspect
It's a volatile stock to, so there is quite some opportunity to trade this with
the ebbs and flow, which is what I have been doing lately. At current prices, I
don't mind holding either if the shares just sit there.

re Bridgestone 5108.T I watch out for many stocks but i buy only those that are
a good value. Earnings for Bridgestone are projected at 145Yen/share while the
stock is trading at 1700Yen, that's a 12x PE. Virtually any valuation metric
(PE, EV, EBITDA, revenue growth) looks worse than Michelin, plus they have a
higher debt gearing (0.55x debt/capital versus 0.2x for ML.PA).

In order to justify the higher valuation, they should show better metrics
compared to Ml.PA but they don't. I don't see the value owning Bridgestone but

NikhilJog - bridgestone is not really heavily invested in China - in fact they
don't invest heavily at all after an investment binge from
2004-2007.(Bridgestones depreciation is actually higher than their investment
in tangible assets right now, so they generate FCF while ML.PA FCF is negative
this year).

Bridegstone biggest market are America's, Japan, Europe and the rest (~18% per
2011 annual report). Michelin is building brand new plants in China, Brazil and
India, going after emerging market growth, which is the right (imo) albeit
risky strategy.

Waste Management, Inc. Common S(NYSE: WM )

Upped my holding in WM by 300%. Didn't realize that their landfill real estate
(w/ permits) are their biggest asset. New landfills are costing more to
approve. Depending how you value these properties, they are worth between
$12.75B $27.00/share (pg 155 2010 annual report) or $5.8B $12.60/share after
depreciation (pg 51 2010 annual report). Their landfills allow them to land
their municipal multi year contracts but now they are making as much money
(more when analyzed on ROI) on their recycling programs. More of the waste
stream is recycled and the useful life of their landfills are extended (as is
their value).

• Recycling 15%
•Waste-to-Energy 11%

I am a buyer below $30/share and will load up if the 52wk low is breached at
$27. Forward PE is around 12.5 All of their divisions exceed 11% ROI on new

Is the Mafia all out of WM? I remember looking into WM some time ago (>10

inside and outside crooks, and I noticed that many of that sort of story
continued after that, to include WM having some accounting revisions. I believe
old Tony Soprano was involved in waste management.

It does seem that the mob has been ejected from the casinos, but it may have
been easier to get the mob out of the casinos. How confident can the current
investor be that the mob really has been sidelined in the waste management
business?

My other hesitation with WM or any trash company is their getting hit with
groundwater suits or other sorts of toxic byproduct cases.

Other than that, yet WM does seem like a worthwhile company. Decent dividend,
the work cannot be outsourced, there is a semi-moat on their business (at least
at the multiple local levels they operate), and the underlying business will

With NYB you are betting on the multi family refinance & renovation
(construction loans) market in New York and surrounding areas. The positive is
that the management has an excellent track record of managing their book in
this sector especially during the 2009 melt down. There is growing demand for
rentals. The bad is that this is no longer a growth market at least for the
next five years. Their portfolio turns over aprox every three years so they
will benefit from the refinancing boom. Dividend is probably safe.

I held this stock for over eight years but early this year closed out my
position. I hold no financials and have moved the money to assets that are
collateralized by Oil & NG rather than real estate mortgages.

This is one of a few of the larger banks that never took TARP money.

NYB is a good one to write covered calls on but I am finding just as good yield
else where. The current price is a fair entry point w/ minimum downside risk
unless the economy falls back into a deep recession.

CANADIAN OIL SANDS(Other OTC: COSWF.PK )

According to the McDef ratio, COSWF has one of the lowest ratios in their list
at 0.48 (1.0 is considered fairly valued).

http://www.mcdep.com/mr111101.pdf

I still prefer the U.S domestic producers but still hold positions in ERF and
PWE. However, my most recent transactions have been sells in these names rather
than new buys. FWIW, I also like PWE for their Candian to US distribution
pipeline (they recent divested themselves of their Oil & Gas exploration
division). I have been buying PVX in the $7.00-$8.00 range.

With the delay in the Keystone pipeline, speculation is the Canada will build
their own pipeline to the West coast for transportation of the Oil Sand
production. I think with a lack of a definite pipeline to export their
production has made the stock sell off. Could be a buying opportunity but with
many of the other domestic producers selling pretty low too (when viewed based
on the Mc Def ratio), I would look at them first.

My positions in PWE & ERF pay pretty good dividends but get hit with the
Foreign Tax withholding. Therefore, I have been selling down these positions
and working the money into the large U.S. integrators (XOM) and more of the
smaller domestic shale producers.

COSWF is definitely a value buy at current levels but I plan to focus on the
U.S. producers (maybe we will get a U.S. energy policy that promotes U.S.
production).

My actions different from you on these, EKS.

PWE. I'm building a position as stock falls. I'm interested in the potential of
Alberta's Cardium light oil.

"The Cardium trend in west central Alberta is one of the largest light oil
plays in
North America. Penn West holds the largest single land position. Our 670,000
net
acres under lease represent approximately 40 percent of the prospective area,
and are estimated to contain significant light oil potential."

I am hoping this will be a long-term hold for me. The dividend will be
important, but for me, not the determining factor to hold the stock.

CVX at current price and its current troubles (Brazil leak), looks like a
better bargain to me than XOM. Hard to determine since XOM is generally
considered the premier integrated oil company, and consequently the market
generally gives it a premium multiple compared to competitors. I notice per
Yahoo, XOM now has more debt than cash, CVX more cash than debt. Perhaps that's
not relevant to anything though.

My preference is SU over COS. Just a personal preference at this time. Have had
COS, didn't do well for me.

I'm going to build a position in SU. I hope as a long-term holding. I like oil
analyst Charlie Maxwell. His advice is to avoid XOM because he says they can't
replace their oil resources at their current consuming rate. Unlike SU, which
he recommends, that has proven reserves that should last for many years.

Coswf (Canadian Oil Sands) - dug around a bit and i think the reason for the
weak shareprice is that they lowered the dividend from 0.5$ quarterly to 0.3$.
They did this despite higher earnings compared to last year, which are due to
higher realized product prices.

I believe the reason for the lower dividend are the changes in tax law (trust
structure); as a consequence of these changes (originating from the infamous
thanksgiving massaker) , COSWF is now a C-tax cooperation which pays income
taxes.

What I like about them is that they have long life operations and a path to
expand production, existing infrastructure build at costs that are far below
current costs, virtually no debt and run by very skilled operators (Imperial
Oil / Exxxon, SU etc.) and pay a nice dividend to boot.

Hi Clown.
MET's management agressive strategy was slowed down by the Feds. From the
conference call:

< As we announced, we recently submitted a capital distribution plan to the
Federal Reserve for approval that included both an increase in MetLife's annual
dividend, as well as the resumption of stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve
has concluded that the company's planned capital actions should be tested under
a revised adverse macroeconomic scenario, which is being developed for those
firms that will participate in the 2012 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and
Review. As a result, the Federal Reserve did not approve the company's planned
dividend increase and other proposed capital actions at this time.>

MET hedged against low interest rates by purchasing $18 billion of notional
interest rate floors in 2004 and 2005. I don't know if other insurers have done
the same.

The p/b alone makes MET a compelling value. Their acqusition of Alico have made
them an international precense and they are now undergoing restructuring to
enhance their operational growth. The only negative I saw here is that they
have a large exposure to Japan where their business has been disrupted due to
tsunami issues but that has to be already factored in to the share price.

Is the levered free cash flow negative due to their acquisition?

re MET and Aflac - Aflac has way more exposure to Europe than MET - Aflac still
holds a lot of crappy bank paper (preferred, subordinated notes) when i checked
on them a while back. MET is not even close in exposure (relative to Aflac) to
troubled European credit. It sort of surprises me that Aflac never got rid of
all that paper after 2008 when they could have done so.

The news regarding the dividend increase and stock buyback (or lack thereoff)
was from 10/25 and lead to an immediate drop in stock. It appears to me that
this was done solely on the grounds that MET is a bank holding company (they
gained out access to Fed liquidity in those dark days of credit crunch in 2008
via the bank holding loophole even though it is primary an insurance company),

The bank holding status is not needed any more (we could even argue if it was
needed back then ,even though it seemed like an idea to gain access to Fed cash
in a crisis), so i think they will sell the bank and get rid of the bank
holding status which stops the Fed from having a say over their affairs. I
regard this as a temporary setback that does not change the intrinsic value of
MET stock.

Correction, MET's U.S. earnings are about 60%.

Regarding their European exposure, from the recent conference call:

<I want to quickly review another topic with you, our European investment
exposure. There are 3 slides in the appendix starting on Slide 32, which
summarize this. MetLife's total European exposure is approximately $42 billion
in GAAP book value, which is less than 10% of our general account portfolio.
It's important to note that the market value exceeds the GAAP book value by
more than $1 billion. Generally speaking, our European exposures focused on
those higher-rated countries in the region. The largest holdings are our $24
billion of non-financial corporate bonds. These holdings are in companies that
are market leaders in the utility, telecom or infrastructure sectors or large
investment grade companies that are globally diversified such as food and
beverage, energy or pharmaceuticals. I would highlight that over 90% of our
European portfolio is investment-grade, and of the 10% which is below
investment grade, approximately 60% of it is in the corporate sector. Less than
2% or about $8.8 billion of our portfolio is invested in European financials.
This is an area where MetLife has been reducing exposure for nearly 2 years.
Within financials, our European hybrid exposure is less than $1.4 billion or
less than 0.35% of our total portfolio. Our hybrid positions are concentrated
in financial companies in the U.K., Netherlands and Switzerland. As you can see
from the slide, we hold approximately $6.9 billion in European banks. We've
sold nearly $3.5 billion in book value since early 2010 at average prices in
the mid-'90s. Sales have focused on institutions with exposure to peripheral
Europe, lower preference capital structure instruments and larger absolute
exposures, particularly where we had any credit concerns. Our remaining
holdings are generally in the larger, better-capitalized European banks.>

Levered cash flow is not a useful metric for a financial - I cringe when I read
the seekingalpa articles about financial discussing cash flow or free cash
flow. Any growing financial will show negative FCF, this is simply a result of

The metric that matters for a financial are:

Maybe the CEO get's another margin call and we have a chance to pick up some
below 3$/share. Many of these guys never learn. I also think JEF is one to look
for , with the CEO exposed so heavily, and agitating to keep the share price
up, I would not be surprised if we were margined to the hilt too. That could be
an opportunity to pick up some real cheap shares (<5$/share). Who knows?

My MHR valuation based on 8500 bopd would be different and much lower. Lower
than the current stock price.

Couple things going on:
Latest production figures I see are 8400boepd. Boepd includes nat gas
equivalent barrels. I discount boepd quite a bit. Sometimes in determining if I
want to buy an e&p company, I count the value of nat gas as zero. I view gas as
being unprofitable for most e&p companies at current price. Jmo. I want oil, or
ngl's - not gas.

I will use '11 year-end projected production numbers. That'd be 10,000
bo<u>e</u>pd.

I base my valuation off enterprise value. Looks to me as I look at your
numbers, it seems to me you are using only shares outstanding (133M ) in your
equation, not accounting for debt.

-----> I am talking here <u>only</u> about valuation based on flowing barrels
of production. Not allowing for value of land -- proven but not producing,
probable assets, and possible assets. I once looked at trying to value the
midstream business, but decided I didn't understand how. I'll rely on your
opinion for this business.

I continue to hold my shares.

As for MAN, I liked what i saw in the last quarterly report for the 9/30/11

significantly growing business in Brazil. Furthermore, i expect Volkswagen

Thank's for reminding me about Enterprise Value which includes all the
outstanding debt. For MHR that's $1.97/share roughly $257M of debt. I feel that
counting their NG (especially now that their lifting costs are much lower) is
much more favorable to MHR's value because their Midstream operation helps them
monetize this asset.

This is true for MHR more so than for several of the other NG E&P companies
that do not have a midstream business or that have already sold that business
like GMXR.

Therefore, I mis-spoke that 8,500 BOEPD is worth $4.25/share but rather
$4.25/share less $1.97/share debt or about $2.28/share. At the end of 2011 they
produced 50% Oil and 50% NG (pg 8 of company 11/2011 presentation:
http://www.magnumhunterresources.com/Magnum_Hunter_Resources.pdf ). I will
count their NG equivalent in my BOEPD valuation because their Midstream
Operation does in fact monetize the asset but I could be wrong here.

Finally, the value of their Midstream business can be valued between
$1.20/share (this is what they have invested already $125M and why they have
the $257M in debt) and $3.80/share ( or $475M is what the CEO says it should be
worth by Q2 2012 which is probably too high. Clownbuck stated earlier that this
figure probably does not include the additional capital necessary to complete
the phase 2 build out).

<u>A conservative analysis of value for MHR might have it worth $2.28/share for
Boepd and $1.20/share for the Midstream business or about $3.48/share. </u>

<u>The thing that continues to intrigued me with MHR is that their Midstream
business makes their NG assets worth much more.</u> Not one of my other small
E&P companies have such a combined operation (I believe GST has already entered
into a JV with a MLP partner for all of their NG gathering business and it's
much smaller than what MHR has already going in Utica).

I would say I may be off by no more than 15% in my MHR valuation. My back of
the envelope Boepd valuation counts their NG production (which is 50% of my
valuation) as a very valuable component of their value. Their NG assets would
be worth close to $0.00 if they had their beginning of the year "lifting costs"
and no Midstream Operation to sell through to. I will stick to my $3.48/share
"Value" price or about $435M.

I have been wrong many times and could very well be wrong now. Trying to
calculate fair value on these small E&P companies is a moving target and in the
final analysis it is up to what a willing buyer is ready to pay for such an
operation. I expect the next big Buyer to be <u>ConocoPhillips (COP).</u> They
recently sold their stake in Seaway Crude Pipeline for $1.15B last week and now
have a war chest of $10.5B for making acquisitions.

re MHR - my stab at the Midstream business:
per 9/20 10Q: Gas gathering and other equipment 110M$. I assume it generated
20M in EBITDA. If you have a willing buyer, he may pay 10x EBITDA= 200M$ for
it. Based on these generous assumptions, the midstream assets would be worth
1.5$/share. Generating almost 2x the cost is possible for new gathering assets
but it's a rich multiple. So E_K_S numbers for the value of he midstream
business are not too far off.

The problem is MHR cost of capital, which hovers around 10% the way I look at
it. A cost of capital this high makes it hard to build gathering assets in an
stockholder accreditive way. Also, selling he business of course will remove an
income source for MHR which will have to be accounted for. So, considering
that, the net value added is at most 1/2 the gross value or 0.75$/share

One thing about MHR that it constantly needs new capital - their debt
(including preferred) stands at ~380M$ and their net current assets are
negative by about 50M$. This is not good if credit market go into somewhat of a
funk. it also does not make a good impression if the CEO is dopey enough to
margin his shares to the extend that he receives a margin call. This also
happened to Audrey, CHK CEO and my perception is that these guys will bleed
their shareholders (via dilution) to get back what they "lost".

Hi Andy -

Abraxas Petroleum Corp. (AXAS)

AXAS makes up only 5% of my small Cap E&P basket while MHR is now over 25%. My
next largest holding is SSN at 13%. I have now been in these small E&P
companies for about 14 months and as the Value picture (for me) becomes
clearer, I have been moving my holdings into the value names rather than the
"speculative" names.

AXAS is still a speculative name for me. Their Boepd is small and the big bet
is on how they have been deploying their Capex budget drilling several new
wells. I like their land holdings but am still waiting on their on going
production results. I have not reviewed the company lately based on their
barrels of flowing production (Boepd) and I suspect it does not even begin to
approach the levels seen in MHR or SSN (or even to a lesser extent LEI). I may
be wrong so it might be worth looking at their most current presentation (
http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MTE1NDI0fENoaWxkSUQ9
TF8VHlwZT0z&t=1 ).

According to their report, they have a 50% mix of OIL & NG. Their exit Boepd
rate for 2011 is 4,800. According to YAHOO debt is $104M w/ 91.53M shares
outstanding so they have $0.88/share LT debt.

At 4,800 Boep x $60,000/flowing barrel (This is the value I have been using
based on what the large integrator pay; It's worth much less for NG and maybe
10% more for all Oil) = $288M

First, according to Paul's analysis (he see's NG equivalent as worth very
little sometime $0.00) and for AXAS I see it as not worth too much since they
have no ownership in a NG gathering business and/or Midstream operation to reap
the full value of those assets. Unless NG goes back up to $8.00/MMBTU (it is
now around $3.44/MMBTU), it cost too much to lift, transport & process the gas
and is more valuable to leave in the ground. Therefore, the $288M is an
overvalued estimate and could be much lower if you look at the Oil assets only
(perhaps as low as $144M).

Assume you do use the full vale estimate of $288M, this is equivalent to
$3.15/share. You must subtract out the LT debt per share of $0.88/share and you
are left with a flowing # of Barrels value of $2.26/share.

The company still has valuable assets in their land holdings, new well
development and their efficient cost of production in both drilling & operating
their wells.

At $3.07/share the stock could be seen as 27% to 60% overvalued based on a
flowing barrel analysis w/ and w/o NG added into the valuation. In other words,
I would only back the truck up and buy this stock if the price traded somewhere
in the range of $1.16/share and $2.26/share. In October 2011 the stock did
trade at a low of $1.86/share. I am currently under water with this one with an
average price of $3.75/share.

If the company can double their Boep production w/o diluting the common shares
too much the stock will gain value. I choose this company because of their use
of the drill pad technology a method for drilling wells in one location for the
least cost per well. This is the most cost efficient drilling system in the in
the industry now and AXAS uses it for most if not all of their new wells. Their
land holdings are good and I especially like their exposure to Niobrara Shale
(about 23% of their acres).

Using the # of Barrells of flowing oil analysis (at least in my E&P Basket)
MHR, SSN and LEI are my best value bets at this time. My other 10 small cap E&P
companies are currently speculations but do have significant (potential) value
in their land assets.

AXAS. I hold a decent size losing position. I like it because it's in diverse
shale plays -- the possible prolific ones of Bakken and Eagle Ford, and also
South Alberta Bakken, Niobrara, and Wolfberry. That is very diverse for any
small e&p.

It won't work as a buy if it's looked at on flowing barrels. It's the potential
that I find attractive.

Company talks about the importance of PV-10 (discounted estimated future
production), but I don't see now where they give any current numbers for it. In
my notes I show in an early 2011 presentation they give 1pnav as $2.57/sh

I show they said 2pnav was $16.237/sh. I'm not surprised proved and probable is
this high, given the shales they are in (although I don't know the specifics of
the particular sections). Still, it's a risky stock, because we're talking
about potentials which may or may not come to fruition or might not be
profitable even if they do pull up the oil that might be there. Still, it's why
I'm in the stock. I've mentioned it a couple of times on this thread.

Fwiw, I'm adding to my oil positions, and looking for new ones. I'd not be a
buyer of AXAS at this time. Others seem more attractive to me.

I have been expecting NG to sometime revert back to its AVG mean price (much
higher than current levels. However, with the huge supplies in the US shale
regions, NG prices may stay depressed. Many of the E&P explorers are focusing
on their OIL production. AXAS will develop 20% more OIL in 2012. So as more
resources and capital are moving to Oil liquids, this may be the time to pick
up NG but you might have to hold on for several years for it to pay off.

CZE/CNCEF: insights pointers.

Here again, as you might charitably say, my analysis is just back-of-envelope.

Using co's 11/10 unaudited interim report I see 93.3m diluted shares. CZE is at
$6.76. (I assume currency difference in US$ vs C$6.76 is small enough to
ignore.) I use Yahoo's value of $431M-362M =$69 for an estimate to plug into
enterprise value (It's a number that's lower, more conservative than just the
net cash figure of $75M). This gives a most conservative enterprise value of
about $562M vs. Yahoo's $362M number.

Company says production in 2012 isn't going to increase from what's expected to
be produced at year-end 2011.
That's not so good. Otoh, those production numbers are expected to be 10-10.5k
bopd

Some discussion here (this thread) about using $60-65K per flowing barrel of
oil per day, as a metric. As what an acquirer would pay for producing assets.

I make my value case, rightly or wrongly for this particular company, on such
flowing barrels of oil. Also, just for a check, its netback numbers seem good
to me.

----------------
Stock is volatile. So is its trading volume. Stock seems to be falling past few
days. I'm a buyer of both CZE,CNCEF depending into which account I add. I'm in
for a little more CZE today.
----------------
For a pointer, I recommend posts by "architect*" on "CANADIAN OIL AND GAS
COMPANIES" thread. He has a different way -- likely a much better way -- of
making value evaluations, He wants companies with low debt, high cash flow to
enable companies to develop their holdings. He seems to follow the Colombian
e&p companies pretty closely --- he can discuss specific plays, land holdings
and inter-reactions and relationships among many e&p companies involved in
South America oil. He holds shares in CZE.

I've been looking at ECOL, with a div. now at over 4%. It's different that WM
in that it does project work rather than contract work.The stock price has been
in the same trading range for the last two years.They completed an acquisition
earlier this year that expanded the co. into Canada.

They have exposure to oil and gas refineries with their trains. And maybe they
would be a beneficiary of increased business from waste water treatment if
fracking picks up. Another angle that could pan out for them is increased
inspection and safety standards for the nuclear industry since the Japan
earthquake.But, regardless of the angles, it looks good at this price. Last q

I will add it to my watch list. ECOL has less debt than WM and is selling
around the same forward PE. The hazardous waste industry can be very profitable
as such their operating margins are quite high.

I like the water treatment angle for fracking as that could be a real growth
business. I will have to research the business more and see if this is
something they do and/or consult on. If there is some sort of future EPA
permitting requirements for treating fracking effluent, this could be the
perfect company to provide the certification.

I do know from limited experience that hazardous waste disposal requires
extensive tracking and certification of the waste disposal. Disposal permits
are filed w/ the State and Feds. The waste stream is owned by the generator and
processed through to disposal (incinerated or buried).

Hazardous waste disposal is sensitive to general economic activity. Located in
Idaho, they probably have MU and INTC as major customers.

This one will be a good one to research. Thanks for the lead.

I found several small caps and bulletin board stocks that are targeting the
fracking wastewater issue, as well as all of the major oil and gas companies.
There is legislation pending from the federal level as well as the state level
and because there is so much money at stake, the water purification issue will
come to the forefront.

Right now, the majors are for the most part treating waste water themselves,
but with increasing pressure this might not last. Fracking and its indirect
industries has the potential to be the (positive) investment story for 2012

Hi Sergio -

US Ecology, Inc. (ECOL)
Flotek Industries Inc. (FTK)

A brief review of the ECOL's Web Site disclosed that their agreement to
purchase <u>Waste Treatment and Storage Facility</u> in 2/11/2011 (located in
California) expired and there were no provisions to extend the agreement. There
was nothing mentioned in their 2010 annual report regarding any water treatment
permitting, facility or services. It just may be too early in the fracking
development for such a specialized service.

Flotek Industries Inc. (FTK) is one of the emerging leaders in the business.
Forward PE around 11 but tons of debt. The larger companies like Halliburton
Company (HAL) have subsidiary divisions that provide these well build out
services. There may not be a "pure" value play in this area but you might also
look at Seadrill Limited Ordinary Share(NYSE: SDRL ) which owns 31% of ARCHER
LTD (ARHVF.PK). Archer bought Great White Energy Services which is another well
service company that operates in the Eagle Ford shale region;
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27609503

From the link:"...Fredriksen expands his empire into well drilling and services
through Archer and the acquisition of Great White Energy Services. <u>Great
White Energy Svs looks like a "pure play" for U.S. energy shale drilling in the
Eagle Ford region</u>. Today's buy by Seadrill (aka Fredriksen) gives them a
39.81% interest in Archer Ltd. The buy was done as a private placement by
Seadrill and Archer Ltd...."

The other area that looks promising is the capture and condensing of NG that is

I agree with you 100% that its too early in the fracking development story for
a specialized service player to evolve. Just looking at potential for ECOL to
expand as fracking develops and through their railcars and their existing
relationships.

From their 10q, "We manage a dedicated fleet of railcars and arrange for the
transportation of waste to our facilities. We also <u>utilize our railcar fleet
to provide transportation services for disposal at facilities operated by other
companies</u> on a less frequent basis. Transportation and logistics services
are a significant revenue source for us. We, or our predecessor companies, have
been in the waste business since 1952. They provide "treatment, disposal,
recycling and <u>transportation services</u> to commercial and government
entities including, but not limited to, oil refineries, chemical production
facilities, manufacturers, electric utilities, steel mills, biotechnology
companies, military installations, waste broker aggregators and medical and
academic institutions.

ECOL could link up into "condensing the NG into CNG or NGL and storing the fuel
on a mobile truck on site that is later delivered to a gathering hub or NG
distribution station." FTK l also put on a watchlist. It's up over 100% in 52
weeks and not cheap on multiples.

Thanks for your research and links too.

Hi Ditch. I came across HEK and got lost reading their last report. I think
they are getting out of the Chinese bottle water business and they are involved
with fracking, but I got lost on this one. It might be a good investment, but
its not for me. Doing my dd I found an older article by somebody who liked them
but maybe wasn't so sure what they did either. Look at the April article here:
http://www.minyanville.com/library/search.htm?q=hek&x=22&y=9

Anyway, it would be difficult to classify HEK as a value stock.

Here's a list of some of the fracking stocks I have been looking over.

Is there a Value Opportunity for different services in the growing domestic
shale sector? Here are some value companies I have on my watch list. The value
opportunity might be in the rail transportation and/or service to that sector.

GATX Corp. (GMT) - good value candidate but perhaps too much Europe & India
exposure
Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) - Value candidate reasonable PE @ 13.24 good debt
profile
Canadian National Railway Company (CNI) - Value candidate PE @ 14.5 excellent
debt profile
US Ecology, Inc. (ECOL) - 80 company owned rail cars valued at $17M (25% of BV)
could possibly provide environmental services if/when EPA require "clean"
effluent standards. - Possible Value Buy
CARBO Ceramics Inc. (CRR) - Speculative "pure" play providing well
development/environmental services. High PE, high margins - Not in my Value
zone.

I recently sold my GMT that I bought for their Oil and NG railcar lease
services. They provide both NG and Oil cars some 167K cars that are leased to
large customers in North America, Europe & India. This is a very profitable
business and GMT is indeed a value proposition w/ a 14.5 Forward PE, 3.1%
dividend and selling 1.5x book. The negative is they have a lot of debt. My
last buy was 2/2011 @ $34.40/share and I closed the position out 7/2011 @
38.26/share. Until the Euro situation is resolved, I am holding off on any
buys. Stock sold down to $13.50/share in the 2008/2009 crash. Another Europe
crash event could provide an excellent entry point.

I was attracted to GATX because they provide NG equipment leasing through their
Enerven Compression JV. From their Web Site :"... We offer leases both directly
and through our Enerven Compression LLC (Enerven) joint venture, which was
founded in 2008. Enerven provides natural gas compression equipment leasing
through its subsidiary, Enerven Compression Services (ECS), and third-party
maintenance and repair services through its subsidiary Worldwide Energy
Solutions Co. (WESCO). ...".

<img src='http://www.enerven.com/images/02_cc00122.jpg'>

They lease LNG & Oil rail cars. Below is one of their LNG railcars.

Buffet through his acquisition of Bu<span style='color: rgb(34, 34,

rail cars. These are the rail companies on my watch list: UNP (PE=15.26), CNI

CRR is involved in international projects including China. They are number one

their cash to buy back shares as well as fund expansion and have no debt. All
this being said, I don't think its a value stock either.

Thanks for the info on railroads. I didn't know the additional cost of rail vs.
pipeline. Buffett's interest in Burlington Northern Santa Fe led me to
connecting with ECOL's rail capacity. I have not studied US fracking locations
regarding availability of rail v pipeline for each location and I have not done

I bought at .46 and will double if it goes to .1
I think this is craziness, but on the other hand we have to agree that this is
a pure speculation of whether the banks will kill the company or not. I think
not, because they have no hard assets that the banks can take. I also don't
think that the business is going away any time soon. At this price the company
is valued at 100 million. Net income for 2010 is 290 million. For me it will be
0 or triple :) In the next 4 years they will have to pay about 300 mil each
year on their debt. They have to find a way to restructure it or sell assets.

In any case this is a speculation and not an investment IMO.

good luck with it.

It's not when you look at EV, which stands at about 2.4B.

My back of envelope calculation gives EV/EBIT* = 5. With the risk of
bankruptcy, I'm not sure its cheap enough, particularly when one has to expect
its CF will decline over the years. But even when stock price is zero, EV/EBIT
doesn't move....

"Our strategy is to provide an integrated and efficient complete water solution
to our customers through a full suite of services which we have built and will
continue to build through organic growth and acquisitions. HWR’s largest
acquisition to date, Complete Vacuum and Rental, Inc., or CVR, was completed on
November 30, 2010, and HWR completed several acquisitions during the first half
of 2011, including fresh water and produced water transportation operations in
the Haynesville, Marcellus and Eagle Ford Shale areas.
As a result of acquisitions and our organic growth, we now own and operate a
fleet of approximately 450 trucks for water transportation and approximately
1,100 frac tanks. In addition, we have approximately 23 operating salt water
disposal or underground injection wells in the Haynesville and Eagle Ford Shale
areas which have a combined permitted salt water disposal capacity of
approximately 368,000 barrels per day. We are also in various stages of
acquiring, developing and permitting additional salt water disposal wells in
our operating markets.

HWR also develops underground pipelines for the efficient delivery of fresh
water and removal of produced water in the Haynesville Shale area in connection
with fracking operations. On January 31, 2010, HWR completed a 50-mile water
transport pipeline, which at design capacity could carry up to 100,000 barrels
of water per day. The pipeline is supported by a network of deep injection
disposal wells which we believe is not only an efficient solution for our
customers, but also provides HWR with a strategic competitive position.

HWR has started construction on a pipeline expansion that will significantly
increase its produced water disposal pipeline capacity in Louisiana. The
expansion will supplement HWR’s 50-mile pipeline through the Haynesville Shale
area with the addition of approximately 19 miles of significantly enlarged
fiberglass pipe and increased pipeline capacity for salt water transportation
and disposal. The existing 19-mile section of the eastern portion of the
pipeline will be used to transport fresh water to current and new customers for
shale well development. The additional capacity is required to support any
future extension of the pipeline further east into the Haynesville Shale area
to accommodate our growing customer base. The expansion will also enable the
construction of additional truck terminals. This important combination of local
trucking and pipeline facilities is being developed to provide customers with
more convenient access to HWR’s disposal wells."

We also own approximately 180 miles of portable poly and aluminum pipe and
associated pumps and other equipment that are used above ground for pumping and
transporting water from streams, ponds and special holding areas, including our
frac tanks, to hydraulic fracturing wells primarily utilized in the Haynesville
and Eagle Ford Shale areas. We are currently expanding these services in other
shale areas. These assets also enhance our service capabilities to our
underground pipeline network in the Haynesville Shale area and are available to
complement our current service offerings to our customers throughout all shale
areas in which we operate.

Our HWR operations are impacted by certain seasonal factors. Generally, our
business is negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement
weather, fewer daylight hours and holidays. During periods of heavy snow, ice
or rain, we may not be able to move our trucks and equipment between locations,
thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues.

During 2009, we acquired an approximately 7% equity interest in Underground
Solutions, Inc. (UGSI.PK) (“UGSI”). We believe UGSI’s complement of patented
flexible fusion pipeline products and fusion processes, technologies, and field
know-how positions it as a leading and innovative pipeline products solution
provider. UGSI provides infrastructure technologies for water, sewer and
conduit applications."

For me EV is quite indefinite in the case of YLO. I cannot value it. This is
why I am looking only at what they are making net (about 260 mil/year) and the
price per share ( 500 mil shares X about 23 cents = roughly 100 mil) I think
the banks should prefer to get 200 mil for 5 years rather than 2.4B imaginary
money.
Banks would kill the small guys and support the big and YLO is somehow not too
big and not too small. I have noticed that many Canadian companies, really big
and leaders in their industry go in the ground very easily, they just loose it.

Hi Ditchdigger -

Heckmann Corporation Common Sto (NYSE: HEK )

The problem with HEK is that they are still losing money and have almost $100M
in debt. I do like the fracking infrastructure they have invested in which
should pay off in the long term. If there is more strict permitting
requirements for fracking effluent there may be some issues with injecting the
recovery fluids underground w/o extra filtration/processing. This could provide
them an advantage (at an extra cost) because they have the systems in place to
capture the waste.

Maybe the best value measure is to use their BV @ $2.53/share as the base line
for the cost of the assets they have invested to do their business. So they
sell for 2.17X BV. I am not too sure what or if their China Water & Drinks
division is worth which could be a lot more than their investment in the
fracking business. I do like that they are also in the fracking tank rental
service. It's very profitable and provides an excellent payback on the asset
(sort of like portable toilets). They also make money on the pick-up and
disposal of the waste water. Two separate revenue streams.

I have this one on my watch list. Based on your posting, they seem to be moving
ahead in a big way into developing their fracking services. Lots of trucks,
tanks and dedicated pipelines invested in.

Any idea what the total amount of water is needed to complete one fracking
well?

WILC,

Well this is another case of I should have not bought much stock without
understanding why the stock is cheap. That usually means someone understands
something much better than I do, like margins are going way down. Note to self:
If it looks too good to be true, put your hands in your pocket.

That being said, there is a nice cash cushion here (they declared cash of 3.70
on the call), company is still slightly profitable and expects to be in Q4,
management is buying back stock, and if they can revert to normal levels of
profitability in a year or two, buys in here should be well rewarded.

I will be looking to accumulate more, but with a much lower price target. If I
had not position already I might step in here, but for now I'll be looking for
a further drop, such as from tax loss selling.

I'll take my lumps and take the tax losses on ATPG. Also selling some high-cost
SSN shares. Still have an outsize position on this one.

I'll give up on asset manager, Legg Mason (LM) and take a loss on this one. In
assets under management it has more fixed income products (by dollars managed)
vs. equity products, than I was aware of. Since I buy these asset managers
based on aum, and because fixed income is so much less profitable than managing
equity, this stock at current enterprise value, is not the value I had
previously believed.

I'm adding to DOLE as it falls.

Packaging/container company Greif lowered its profit estimate for 2011. The
stock's fallen back near lows, and I added a tad to the very few GEF shares I
already have. It's a little disconcerting to me when a company like Greif
("Greif, Inc. engages in the manufacture and sale of industrial packaging
products, and containerboard and corrugated products worldwide.") lowers
expectations. It suggests that GEF revenues are going to be lower than
expected, which implies that GEF's customers aren't demanding GEF containers to
send product to customers. This is not a sign of robust growth in the economy.

For a speculation, I'll take a few AAPL shares at current price. My first add
to my few share position since 2006. Too bad for me I did not add shares in any

What are your thoughts on AT here? Appears they will pay out 100%+ for a little

Long-term guidance unchanged
– able to maintain dividend level into 2016 even under downside
scenario with no acquisitions or organic growth
– 2011 project distributions projected to be $80-90 million
– higher distributions from existing projects
– initial distributions from recent investments in Idaho Wind and Cadillac
• 2011 payout ratio expected to be slightly higher than 2010
– increased project distributions, offset by dividends on common shares
issued in October 2010 and ongoing conversions of debentures into
common shares
• 2012 payout ratio significantly improved
– further increased project distributions
– Selkirk will make last debt payment in mid-2012

Hi Steve -

Atlantic Power Corporation (AT)

My StreetSmart Edge Research module has very little information on this
company. From YAHOO finance I do see that they carry over $4.50/share in debt
w/ no net income (could be due to some recent acquisitions). BV stated as
$5.50/share.

Really no opinion other than I see they also own 84 miles of electric power
transmission lines in CA, own a biomas project (still under construction) in
Georgia and is involved in some private party co-generation projects.

I guess I would like to see a more substantial cash flow over a longer period
of time before committing to a monthly dividend payout.

I would pass on this one but may be worth watching to see how they integrate
some of these non conventional power assets into their operation.

This one is similar to Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (AQUNF.PK) but AQUNF
yields only 5% and has more water treatment & delivery exposure (45%) than AT
but owns unconventional power assets like geothermal, windmills and other
"green" resources. FWIW they just raised their dividend from $0.065/qtr to
$0.07/qtr.

Hi Gogo,

Say I open a bakery with a $100,000 loan from the bank and an initial seed
funding $10,000 from a VC. EV of my bakery is $110k. Business goes sour and I
have to close shop. The bank is now the first in queue to ask $100k back.

I don't understand why the $100k I owe to the bank is "imagery" and
"indefinite".

The bank may not be able to recoup the entire $100k. But from the perspective
the VC (i.e. the shareholder), his main concern is whether anything is left for
his after the bank gets their part. If the bank can't recoup 100%, the VC gets
nothing back.

Similarly, in YLO's case, the main question: is there anything left to the
shareholders after the banks and the senior debt holders are paid.

My two cents....

There have been several posts on this thread about the risks involved with

political problems in Israel as well as the general work stoppage.
Surprisingly, because people gotta eat, all this has resulted in lower margins
than could have been anticipated by all the factors discussed.

It's now trading barely above its cash. But, I'm not sure we're ever going to
see that cash do much.

Referring back to Jurgis' post about Israeli management loving to build cash

Hi Mako,

Mhat I mean by imaginary is that all YLO has is intangible assets and goodwill
and 300 mil current assets. In my opinion before you sell the intangible assets
you "imagine" they are 1,680.41 million $, but how much it is true we don't
know before the sale is completed. And it would matter only in case of
liquidation. In this case I consider I will get 0.

I don't understand why the $100k I owe to the bank is "imagery" and
"indefinite".

If we consider the goodwill and intangibles to be worth as much as they are in
the books, then this is a good investment.
(goodwill 3,015 mil + intangibles 1,680 + 300mil cash) minus 2000mil debt =
2,800mil at 500mil shares we have 5.6$ per share for a company that that makes
260 mil per year and sells for 0.23$ per share. If we think this way, this is a
brilliant investment.

I think that at this price this is a speculation with a very good probability
to triple your money if they don't have very disappointing results in the near
future.

Good Investing,
