GTSI,

This new bad news may just be coincidence, but I have to tell you
implementation of new enterprise-wide software is a strong sell signal for me.
It is now on the level of accounting fraud in my book.

I personally worked for a company where such a software implementation was a
total disaster; I lost a lot of money on a couple of stocks like this,
including a disaster called ENC; and I have heard lots of similar horror
stories for other companies.

I also lost money on GTSI, but luckily took my lumps early.

Yes, big sell signal for me too. I should have listened to that signal!

Worked for a company a decade ago that went for full SAP installation. Terrible
- business interruption, resources (management & employees) wasted, expensive.
I left before it was completed, so I don't know final outcome. Imo, SAP and the
company's aggressive but unwise managers who promoted the thing, diverted the
company. Jmo, maybe it turned out great, but I have read horror stories back
then from so many companies about failures in implementation and results, and
costs and personnel issues that were not as expected.

Otoh, in reporting poor quarterly results, sometimes bad management is masked
by blaming poor results on "weather" or "new software implementation issues".
Perhaps it's a a complexity of issues, but still... as you say, when earnings
issues are blamed on "implementation of new enterprise-software" glitches, it
is a sell signal. I figure for maybe one or two years.

For GTSI, I had more faith than I should have apparently in business acumen of

Is this a "Value" play or a "Value" trap?

I'd bet that it is most likely a way of throwing away your money. "Value play"
implies you make money and "Value trap" implies that your money is somewhat
safe but does not grow - this is neither. The equity is so far down on the food
chain on Dana - with Pensions/Unions and the debt - that there will likely be
no recovery.

Take that from someone who's followed lots of companies thru bankruptcy. Heck,
take it from someone who's lost money on companies that are close to exiting
bankruptcy and have a published restructuring plan that says equity holders
will get new stock and than go into liquidation with no recovery.

If you do go into Dana, you might look at their bonds. They're trading at about
70 cents on the dollar. Or wait 'til they exit bankruptcy and then buy the new
stock.

The prospectus for the secondary mentions the risk, in particular the aging

at about 20 years which means that this cannot justify the discount to TDW.

From the WSJ

WASHINGTON -- David Tepper is widely credited as a savvy investor in distressed
companies, but observers have some advice for those considering emulating his
investment in Dana Corp.: Don't try this at home.

Mr. Tepper, who heads Appaloosa Management LP hedge fund, yesterday disclosed
that he had acquired 22.5 million Dana shares, a 14.8% stake. Mr. Tepper, who
made a similar bet last year on the stock of another company in Chapter 11,
Delphi Corp., argues that Dana shares are potentially a good deal.

However, Delphi has publicly stated that it is "highly unlikely" that common
shareholders will recover any value from their holdings as the company
progresses through its bankruptcy proceedings. Dana spokesman Chuck Hartlage
said, "Our advice on our stock is to seek the advice of a professional
investment adviser."

Ben Silverman, research director at InsiderScore.com, praised Mr. Tepper's
smarts, but argues that less well-connected investors might look elsewhere for
a place to put their money. Mr. Silverman said, "This guy's a distressed-debt
specialist. This is his game, and he likes to do some dumpster-diving down
there." Even so, Mr. Silverman added, retail investors should be cautious about
any company in bankruptcy. "It's a very risky bet for the average investor --
one that rarely pays off, if ever."

Ben Branch, a professor of finance at University of Massachusetts who was
co-author of a study on the stocks of companies in bankruptcy, said they
generally aren't a good gamble. "We looked at what would have happened if you
bought the stock the day after the bankruptcy," he said. "If you did that, for
every dollar you invested, you'd get back about 30 cents. ...Close to half the
time, you'd get nothing back."

Mr. Silverman said that from Mr. Tepper's filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, it appears that Appaloosa acquired the bulk of the shares
on or before March 2 -- the day before the company filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection. Mr. Tepper disclosed that he acquired 2.3 million shares
March 2 through March 6, paying an average price of 95 cents a share.

Mr. Tepper didn't disclose -- and wasn't willing to say in an interview -- when
he acquired the remainder of his stake. "That question doesn't mean anything,"
he says. "Who cares? What's the difference? You own what you own. What's the
difference when you bought it?" Dana shares dropped nearly 37% on March 3 after
sliding steadily with bankruptcy looming.

"If he had waited until it filed [for bankruptcy protection], he probably would
have bought the stock for less," Prof. Branch said. "To the extent that he
acquired the stock before the bankruptcy, then he paid more than if he waited."

In the bankruptcy filing, the Toledo, Ohio, auto-parts maker listed $7.9
billion in assets and $6.8 billion in debts. Mr. Tepper argues that those
figures position the company's shareholders more favorably than equity holders
in other bankruptcies. "It's not necessarily the case that companies come out
of bankruptcies and their stocks don't have a lot of value," he said.

At the same time, Mr. Tepper acknowledges the risks involved. "It's a
probability game," he says. Shareholders "could come out with nothing. They
could come out with $12 a share."

I am holding CVX since it's less vulnerable to NG gas pricing right now (not
that the stock seem to care CVX is a weakest of the three). I will be watching
for a reentry point into CHK in particular.

It's not clear to me how the street will value the hedge gains that CHK will be
showing in the near term future. My guess is that they will be treated as a one
time event rather than operating earnings and hence CHK should still trade in
lock with NG prices. That being said, i do like CHK and this they will try to
benefit and buy reserves in the ground for lower prices. My guess is that gas
in the ground can be had for 2$/MCFE again if weaker prices persists for a
while. XEC may also be a company to watch, even though they are less hedged
than CHK they have very little debt, which will allow them to lever up if they
see opportunities to buy reserves.

FWIW: Another opinion.

By Deustche Bank ($55.85, March 7, 2006)

THE TEMPTATION IS TO WANT to buy Chevron, with the last bulls having turned
bearish and the stock offering the cheapest credible oil and gas reserves on
Wall Street (at just $5 per barrel).

For now, we retain a neutral view of the company, unchanged by its analyst day,
which broadly speaking was in line with our expectations.

A bull would argue that Chevron sandbagged its analyst meeting. First, it gave
a deliberately low 3% growth target in volumes, despite a huge suite of
projects that start growth delivery in 2007 and keep coming.

Second, there was no grand outlook for reserves replacement despite a simply
outstanding exploration record over the past five years. Third, the company has
a fantastic exposure to growth oil-demand markets in Asia.

Finally, there was only mumbled mention of a $5 billion buyback program over
three years that could be done within one, implying $2 per share of yield,
worth 4%, to add to 3.3% dividend yield this year.

A bear would argue that the company's 2008 [production] target for three
million barrels per day is the same as 2004; except the 400 kilo barrels per
day that Unocal has been acquiring in the meantime. That represents a
spectacular miss on a volume target. This meeting revealed yet more project
slippage to major developments such as Agbami in Nigeria and Tengiz in
Kazakhstan, combined with ever-higher capital-expenditure requirements.

This struggle to successfully develop major projects -- brutally evidenced by
the woeful actual reserves-replacement ratio reported with the Securities and
Exchange Commission over the past two years -- indicates that the well-known
massive resource potential of the company will not be exploited for good
returns. Furthermore, capital expenditure is also up dramatically in the
volatile downstream.

Finally, and we are near-term bears, our first-quarter earnings-per-share
number of $1.50, versus the Wall Street consensus [estimate that is] closer to
$2.00, is terribly low.

The key issues are horrible Asian refining and U.S. natural-gas prices far
below fourth-quarter levels.

re CVX - about 35% of CVX earnings come from NA and a good deal of that is oil
upstream rather than gas. If lower gas prices hurt CVX imagine what earnings
for the NA gassy E&P's will look like. 1.5$ earnings/quarter would be a 20%+
reduction from the last quarter, which I hardly can see for CVX just through
lower NA NGAS prices alone, given CVX's diversity.

I wonder if you have listened to any of the chk presentations.
The bottom line is that every year is a new year for natural gas in terms of
pricing and storage. So unless you can predict that winters will always be mild
or that LNG will be come a reality much faster than anyone predicts. I dont see
any meaningful decines in reserve pricing in the future.

Madharry, yes i have looked at CHK's presentations. As long as NG prices stay
high, CHK has the means to produce a lot of value for shareholder. I did notice
a few things on the website:

1) Their charts stop at 7$ MCFE pricing - spot is currently lower than that.

2) When i compare earnings estimates for the same pricing in 2006 and 2007 i
notice that CHK earnings will be quite a bit lower at the same price points.
This is due to increasing costs.

Prices are made a the margin. I predict that if we see 5$ NG (which I think is
quite probable) reserves in the ground will be worth no more than 2$. The high
prices of the past did have an impact when i look at the injection/draw numbers
and inventory. the demand /supply balance has shifted due to obvious drilling
response and demand destruction. This could drive NG prices quite a bit lower
during this summer. Yes next year is another game but this is a long time to
go.

Just read your post of KSU. I believe its a fine RR servicing the plains of the
USA and beyond.

I have done some research and I will share it with you and look forward to
corresponding with you on KSU.

Pay special attention to 2000. That year the dividend was suspended, the
Stillwell financial subsidiary (Janus) was spun off, and there was a reverse
split in the common stock. I am a historian so I may have overemphasized the
Staggers (RR deregulation) Act information.

During 4q2005- KSU and Norfolk Southern agree to Joint Venture. NS will pay
$300 mill to upgrade the
railway from Meridian MS to Shreveport LA

April 1, 2005 - KSU competes the acquistion of the controlling interest in
Kansas City Southern de Mexico railway.

Jan 1, 2005 - KSU completes the acquisition of the Tex Mex railway.

Nov 11, 2005 - The Billings MT Gazette had an informative article on ksu,
especially
for transporting goods overseas from Asia.

Sep 2005 - I read an informative article in the "Rocky Mtn News" reviewing the
shortage of rail cars to carry the coal from the western slope of Colorado &
Powder
River Basin of Wyoming to end markets. The RRs impacted were the Union Pacific
and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe. Both railroads stated they are improving
their
rail lines in the areas, AND experiencing a shortage of railcars that carry the
coal to markets in the east and midwest.

Tom White of Amer Assoc of Railroads states "The rule of thumb is that for
trips of
about 750 mi. of longer, particularly if the cargo is heavy, the railroad can
move it for
at lower cost. Trains are inherently more fuel-effiecient than trucks by a
factor of 2
or 3. One train moves cargo equivalent to 280 trucks, but instead of 280
drivers
a train's got 2".

April 2002 - KSU and BNSF sign a marketing agreement, kind of a joint venture.
where each RR uses each other rail lines.

In 2002 - KSU sells Wyandotte Garage for a gain of $4.9 mill

During 2001 - Canada National RR acquires Wisconsin Central

June 2001 - STB issues new rules governing major railroad mergers or
consolidations of 2 or more 'class 1' RRs. The new rules increase the burden on
on the acquiring RR to demonstrate the transaction is in the public interest.
Class 1 - RR w/ $250 mill revs; Class 2 are regional RRs; Class 3 are local RRs

Mar 12, 2001 - the TexMex sub buys a 85 mi line from Rosenberg, TX to Victoria
TX
from Union Pacific for $ 9.2 mill, effectively connecting Laredo to the Gulf of
Mexico

July 12, 2000 - KSU spins off Stillwell Financial (Berger, Janus, other fin
opers)
to its shareholders

July 2000 - stk does a reverse 1-for-2 split

First qtr 2000 - KSU suspends the div on com stk.

Late 1999 - BNSF tries to buy Canada Natl RR, and the Surface Trans Board
says WHOA - there must be railway competition in No Amer these
consolidations are going overboard.

June 1999 - Canada Natl RR buys Illinois Central RR - further consolidating No
Amer Railways

During 1998 - KSU buys concesssion for $9.5 to rebuild the Panana Canal Railway

During 1998 - KSU gets haulage rts to Omaha, Lincoln NE, & Council Bluffs IQ as
result of UP buying the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad

Dec 1997 - KSU and Norfolk Southern enter 3 yr marketing agreement giving
co the right to service the railroad from Dallas, TX to Meridian, MS

During 1997 - Norfolk So & CSX buy the assets of Conrail - furthering RR
consolidation in No Amer

During 1997 - KSU buys 37% of Grupo TFM (Mexico) for $298 mill

During 1996 - KSU authorizes a 9 mill shs buyback program

During 1995 - KSU authorizes a 24 mill shs buyback program

During 1995 - Union Pacific and Chicago & NW RR merge - furthering RR
consolidation in No Amer
During 1995 - Burlington Northern and Sante Fe RRs merge - starting RR
consolidation in No Amer

During 1995 - KSU buys 49% of Tex Mex of Laredo for $23 mill

During 1980 the RR industry changes drastically because of the Staggers Act
which derulated the industry and let to market base competition in RRs.
In addtion trucks remained a very strong competitor. The railroads were forced
to adapt or die.

During 1887 Arthur Stillwell starts a north south railway that become the
Kansas City RR, he wants to get midwest food stuffs to the Gulf of Mexico
ports.
For export around the world.

Just watching . . .DANA Corp. DCN (now DCNAQ) filed for bankruptcy on 3-6-06

it continues to rally higher. The stock is trading now at $1.62.

I guess these potential value bankruptcy plays is a question of Risk vs Reward.
It will be interesting to see if the company ever comes out clean from their
bankruptcy and can keep a large percentage of their pre-bankruptcy equity (s/b
around $6.00/share).

The dividend was cut. I'll have to settle for stock appreciation once the stock
settles from divided players wanting out. I'll add averaging down looking for a
bottom. Hopefully the dividend cut shows the company is serious about fixing
and improving the business. KKR found out it took a long time to re-coup from
RJR/Nabisco and Bordens. Some divestitures are still in the work that should

blankmind: KDE. I'm not happy with the answer I gave you regarding why I like
the stock. I find I don't like the stock.
You got me to focus on the stock and company, and I decided in spite of having
cash half of market price, the business prospects don't seem so great. Although
company has resources and talents to come up with a hit product, there's really
nothing noteworthy there now. The company may be moving from having a viable
(growing) business to being a cash-in-search-of-a-business candidate. I'm not
so sure I want to own it at current price if that is so.
So, I sold down my position to a stub.

Now today there's a very negative analyst report that knocked the company's
business prospects and dropped the stock further.

one thing to keep in mind is what Graham called "margin of safety". with goog I
don't see it. The search business is not a mature business and could change
rapidly. A new search technology could be invented and it could be bought by
aol msft ebay or msft. msft is committing major brain power to doing search
better than google. Playing the "relative" value game is what hurt many a value
investor in the late 90s. They relaxed their standards so they could "play".
Having said that, the stock could do very well from here. Just pointing out
that if it did, it wouldn't be because it was a value in the Grahamian/Buffett
sense of the word.

Is it that you don't see a "margin of safety" or a "moat" protecting the
economic castle.

Internet based businesses follow what is known as a "power law" function and I
believe what one fails to see with Google is a network effect, but not in the
same way as Ebay's network effect. Google has, in fact, tremendous pricing
power for ads since the more people who use Google to search, the more valuable
Google's search engine becomes to advertising.

Next, Google's business model is not very capital intensive, but it is op. ex.
expensive. As such, incremental amounts of capital can be invested in this
business at extremely high Returns on Capital.

The reason why Google got to where it is today is thanks to Yahoo!. Yahoo!
pursued a portal strategy and, as such, let Google handle its search
functionality. Much like the barbarians eyeing the Roman Empire, Google saw the
returns and entered this business also. What one fails to see is that the
advertising market is huge and that more people are spending more of their time
on the Internet rather than other forms of media such as Tv, Radio, Newspapers,
and the value chain is shifting and with that shift, more value will flow
online.

Hi Paul - What's your reentry strategy if any? Do you wait for a 10%-15%
correction and get back into the sector, move the money to another sector or
hold cash and wait for a value proposition?

I have been building up my cash reserves by (1) peeling off shares from my
largest positions, (2) selling over valued equities with limited growth
prospects and (3) rebalancing my equity holdings vs bonds, TIPs and money
funds.

The markets are nearing all time highs so it might be wise for me to lighten up
on some of my SWWC. It's been an excellent performer even with it's high PE.

FWIW I have scaled back on some of my large bank stocks (WM, C, JPM) locking in
my 10% return. I will reenter at lower prices. Bought more SFL as it now pays a
qualified dividend at 10.5%.

I might re-enter SWWC for a trade (not a value buy) if it drops 10-15%.

A re-entering point 10-15% below a price I sold (assuming I'm selling at my
opinion of full/fair value) can't be a value investment for me. There's just no
margin of safety and it's too ambiguous to fix value points: can't say a stock
is undervalued (therefore a buy, and with an implied margin of saftey) at .85x
, but fully or fairly valued (and a sale)at x. That's just too narrow a spread
and too tough to call.
But, otoh, sometimes I will take a flyer and buy back in anyway. My record is
not that good in doing this.
---------------

I prefer to park monies in a money market fund. But as you will surmise from my
posts I always - rightly or wrongly - seem to be finding something to buy, so
the monies don't stay parked long.

Sometimes I rebalance within a sector. I've mentioned some restaurant stocks
that I've sold where I reinvested sales of the appreciated stocks into other
restaurant stocks that looked cheaper to me. In oil/gas sector - unlike
restaurant stocks - I've sometimes moved monies from underperformers in to
stocks that seem to be the better performers (stockwise).

Hi Spekulatius - Thank you for your list. I already own INTC and CVX. INTC is
my most recent purchase and I believe the down side risk is small. I own CVX
from the Texaco days. That was one of the best value plays at 10 PE and a 5%
dividend. My original purchase was in the 1980's and I have added more shares
from time to time.

I like the business of ALCO but I have a hard time finding the "value"
proposition from their current business operations. I may be missing something
but according to Yahoo the PE is 49, they carry $8.00/share in debt, revenue
growth is negative and both their price/sales (5.81) and price/book (2.25) do
not signal a screaming buy to me. Could this be a real estate play and/or a
turn around situation?

I have not followed the CBS & VIA story like you but believe that this is an
area worth more investigation. It's hard for me to wrap my hands around a good
pure "value" play in this sector. I own Comcast (CMCSA) (cable, ISP & VOIP) who
is also in talks to buy EI (a content producer). I also own some shares in the
"new" T which has exposure to wireless (Cingular), landline phone (both Pots &
VOIP), Video On Demand & ISP services (DSL). Neither really produce content
like VIA & CBS. They currently just deliver the content. This may change for
Comcast. I have been watching Disney but I am waiting for a lower price. Disney
is a true content producer. VIA & CBS may help fill the gap in my portfolio.
Keep on posting your opinions of each because there is lots of overlap in this
sector.

Hi Dolan - Yes, it's human nature but you can not be greedy either. I have left
a lot of money on the table but I also have provided myself with the
opportunity to invest in new more profitable "value" propositions.

I try to scale back or peel off a portion of my gains over time. Usually I will
take 1/3 off the table if the equity has become fully valued and the growth
prospects have slowed. Also, this allows me to get back my initial investment
especially if it's a multi-bagger. One example is with GLW (Corning). I finally
sold 10% of my original shares that I acquired between $3.50-$5.00/share in
2003. The stock is overvalued at $26 but I believe the growth prospects are
still very good.

The difficult decision is to step up and buy more shares after a stock has had
a significant rise. Once investors discover the hidden value and/or management
has shown that they have started to turn the company around, the stock usually
increase back to fair value (or higher). Sometimes stocks over shoot their fair
value mark and the prudent strategy is to sell your shares.

You will never book a profit until you sell. Trading a stock can be part of
your investment style but you must be disciplined and have an exit strategy. I
have been much more successful selling a portion of my shares and moving on to
something new.

B K S regarding Value stocks -

I do not care much about ALCO's operation (as long as they don't destruct
value), it's the land value that attracts me. i have posted a while back on
deals where they sold parcels of land, for sums that suggest that the company
could be worth several multiples of their total EV if they sold out completely.

INTC could be a great rebound story 1-2 years out. They have fallen behind AMD
but i believe they have the means to catch up. MSFT's Vista is coming and they
have a new generation of dual core chips coming that should help to counter
AMD's threat. Give it some time and they will be back, hopefullky not before I
rounded up my stock position.

CBS and VIA are my favorite media stocks. I have been pushing them on this
thread since 2003 so take this with a grean of salt. However those company's
have been getting better and stronger in the meantime, through spinoff of
Blockbuster, share repurchases,organic growth and the recent spift into the CBS
and VIA combo. I prefer content providers over distributors as I think the
latter is a commodity type business.

Media stocks have been in the stock market basement for quite some time. I
believe those two company's are well managed. I also believe that while
broadband internet is a threat to TV and Cable, it's also a huge opportunity
(see the recent buzz around CBS March madness) as the two will converge with
broad band video. A few years down the road the internet players like YHOO or
GOOG might take over content providers like CBS or VIA for this reason (and
hopefully for a large premium). In any case the valuation is undemanding

I am not that big of a fan for DIS stock. DIS most valuable property is ESPN
but in reality ESPN is more a package than real content. The major leagues
(Footbal, baseball)are the real content providers and will demand a larger and
larger share, IMO.

OT - Morningstar stock analysis

Does anybody use Morningstar stock analysis for his own investment
considerations? When I gained access to Morningstar reports through my
brokerage account I initially started to like the way they look at stock.
Unfortunately i found that following their investment logic appears to me
detrimental to the health of my portfolio. I believe that the Morningstar
reports have a tendency to put their readers in the right stocks at the wrong
time. I think the main reason is that their analyst cover so many stocks that
they are behind the ball in most and don't discover early warning sign that
indicate a deteriorating business.

I used to have access to Goldman Sachs report and found them timely and often
well researched. i still have access to JPMorgan reports. What i like about

foreign stocks where it can be a lot of work to compile the data. While i do

OT - Re: Morningstar stock analysis

You can correct me if I'm wrong but it seems to me that their ranking system is
primarily based on the discount to their 'fair value' estimate. They get fair
value from a DCF model. Their ranking system does not seem to consider when
this value will be achieved or how easily it will be achieved. This effectively
means that their rating system will not favor those GARP-ish stocks that are
running well right now. On the other hand, it seems to recommend a lot of
"broken" growth stocks that could potentially turnaround.

I agree with you that a lot of the information in the analysis is shallow. I
haven't seen any insight in any of the reports that I've looked at which isn't
already well known.

Overall, it feels somewhat mechanical. I do like the section that says what

P/S is compelling. The question is can they increase their margins by going
after government contracts. The recent downdraft was due to their exiting their
Mexico business and not providing forward guidance. Since they missed guidance

And how about posting results from when you mentioned them here. That is, HANS
was first mentioned June 18 by you, not one year ago. (Good results still, but
nobody here could've bought and got 304% pa, if they bought when you first

I do not recall that you ever said you were actually buying or bought these
stocks yourself. I recall words like "recommend", "it's still a buy", but
nothing like "I bought at $x" or "I'm buying now". You ARE putting your own
money on the line with these recommendations, aren't you?

You must exist on a parallel universe from the rest of us, if you are
disparaging of a capital return of "only 32%". I suspect there are people in my
universe who would kill if they could even achieve, let alone sustain, a 30%
annual return on their investments. (I'm talking a universe of value players
with money, not some kid with $10k who'll risk it all on a couple of stocks to

Given that you were banned from the 50% gains thread, I hope you are not using

Paul, unfortunately this is exactly the sort of reply I hoped I wouldn’t get
when I sat down to write my last message. Why is it that there seems to be a
reluctance on this Board to debate an issue, and instead to attack "the
Messenger" ?

Surely the issue here should not be whether or not I, or anyone else, has
bought what and when, but rather the strategy of spreading one’s investment
over a large number of stocks for reason of "risk aversion", or whatever.

I mentioned the examples of HANS and PDX because I've personally referred to
them in the past, and, more importantly, because they’ve exhibited that sort of
Fundamental Quality which is concomitant with ongoing demand and parallel price
increase.

I looked back a year because that’s a common timescale for comparison purposes.

I also used ‘50% Gains Investing’ as an example of this multi-stock portfolio
strategy because it’s presumably well known by most members of this Board. I
could have referred to many other proponents of this methodology but the
chances are they would have meant little, or nothing, to the reader.

In my personal opinion it doesn’t say all that much for a Portfolio Manager
when he/she needs to populate their portfolio with an overly large selection of
stocks in the apparent hope that the winners will make up, in some way, for the
losers. Either you know what to look for within the Financial Fundamentals of a
company, or you don’t.
If one really knows what to look for, then a Portfolio will contain far fewer
stocks, but of far greater Fundamental Quality. In so doing, the really good
performance of Quality companies are not diluted by the poor performance of the
laggards.

And if one adopts a strategy of buying or selling stocks only when the
financial results are made public, which is when one knows most about the
"financial affairs" of said company, then there’s very little risk of damaging
one’s Portfolio. After all, a really good, Quality company will only be able to
provide ongoing profits and value for its shareholders if it’s able to "shine"
in certain specific areas of its Financial Statements. A laggard will never be
able to do both over the medium to longer term.
So why invest in it in the first place ?!

And, Yes, I personally don’t see 32% PA as a major achievement. For those who
may be interested, you can visit the USA Board at www.advfn.com. There you will
find reference I made to three South African stocks way back in September 2004,
viz., DAW, DGC and WBO. I’ve held these stocks from before that date and still
do. I’ve also regularly updated their price performance since that time.

After 17.5 months their average share price has increased by 185%. After 12
months their average share price was up 98.9%. And every 6 months, when their
Financial results come out, I check them to confirm whether, or not, they still
meet or exceed the required criteria. And as long as they do, I’ll continue to
include them in my brief Portfolio. When they don’t, I’ll sell them.
The proof of the pudding, I believe, is in the eating.

And "eleutheria", it goes without saying that no one can know, in advance, as
to whether or not a stock’s price will increase by 300%. It would be na&#239;ve
to think so.
However, as I mentioned above, a QUALITY company will reflect certain aspects
within its Financial Statements, and because it does, it will, over the medium
to longer term, provide above average share price increase. A laggard could not
do that.

Therefore I personally don’t see it as a "conundrum", but rather as adhering to
the true tenets of Fundamental Analysis, with some basic understanding of maths
thrown in for good measure !
As the saying goes, "you cannot make a silk purse out of a pig’s ear".

Why settle on only 300%. Watch for the bolded company going public.

"MineCore board approves 50% sale of La Fortuna gold prospect to San Remo
Resources

MineCore International, Inc. ("MineCore") (Other OTC:MCIO.PK -News) announced
today that the Board of Directors has approved the sale of 50% of its interest
in the La Fortuna gold prospect in Venezuela to San Remo Resources Ltd.("San
Remo"), an Alberta, Canada, Corporation, in exchange for 8,000,000 common
voting shares valued at CDN$0.25 per share or CDN$2,000,000.

The Definitive Agreement, signed on May 26, 2005, requires San Remo to raise up
to CDN$1,000,000 in equity financing for the exploration and development of the
La Fortuna property. San Remo has engaged Leede Financial Markets Inc. to raise
the capital on a commercially reasonable efforts basis.

To assist San Remo, MineCore will prepare a report that complies with the
Securities Commission National Instrument 43-101 to ensure that the La Fortuna
Gold Prospect meets the TSX-V Minimum Listing Requirements. An Independent
Geologist will be retained to complete the report.

San Remo will have the option to purchase the remaining 50% interest in the La
Fortuna gold prospect on a right of first refusal basis from MineCore.

The closing for the sale to San Remo was completed on May 30, 2005. MineCore
will complete the TSX-V Rule 43-101 report for San Remo as its last condition
to close.

The La Fortuna property is a single 520-hectare Exploitation Concession under
contract with the C.V.G. (Government of Venezuela) based north of Las Cristinas
at Km 88, in the state of Bolivar, Venezuela. The deposits are alluvial and in
saprolite veins to depth in fresh rock with broad zones of potassic alteration
with gold mineralization. The La Fortuna property is adjacent to the El Foco
property owned by Zaruma Resources Inc., which announced on February 24, 2005,
that they reported a 75% increase in the estimated saprolite gold resource at
Alcaravan, to close to 100,000 ounces (source: Canada NewsWire via COMTEX).

MineCore started work on the property in 1995 and has continued to explore ever
since. Work completed to date consists of soil sampling, trenching, auguring
and diamond drilling. Soil sampling revealed several areas of good gold
anomalies, with values up to 3.64 grams per tonne in the soils. Trenching has
revealed four broad zones of pervasive alteration and gold mineralization with
ore grade sections up to 3.88 grams per tonne over widths of 9.0 meters running
through them. Diamond drilling has confirmed the mineralization indicated in

EXPE - market shares

from memory:

EXPE - 40%
Travelocity: 20%
Orbitz: 15% (?)
Priceline and others share the rest.

The advantage to use travel sites like Travelocity or EXPE against other means
are package pricing ( Airline Ticket = hotel), availability and ease of use.
booking multiple hotels and airline tickets on different websites can get a
pretty big chore if one does it on different websites, but is much easier to
track if done on EXPE for example.

I see business travel and international business as major growth areas as most
are not served well yet (I can talk from my own experience there).

EXPE had more deals that Travelocity but recently this gap has shrunk and now
Travelocity is almost on par.

Thanks, gcrispin. Is it possible that other travel sites have similar
agreements with hotels? To me, unless there are tremendous economies of scale,
which I doubt, I'm still having trouble understanding why one would use Expedia
over another site.

I know that Spek. (sp?) posted market shares from memory and the "power law" is
somewhat in effect since the largest online travel site has nearly double the
marketshare of others.

I know that EXPE appears to be "inexpensive" or even cheap by some metrics, I'm
just having trouble analyzing this issue.

Spekulatius,

I agree that one stop shopping is "easy" for the end user, i.e. the consumer. I
believe that the leisure sector is a good sector to be in.

However, as I've said (and I know I'm sounding like a broken record), why do
people use Expedia over Travelocity? What drives traffic to Expedia/Hotwire
over another site?

The Internet has "power law" dynamics, but in order for an advantage to be
sustainable, there must be something else that compels people to use Expedia or
any other travel site.

OT

< It makes me wonder at the Investment "strategy" of something like '50% Gains
Investing' which recommends a portfolio of something in excess of 41 stocks,
excluding a selection of Call and Put Options !
Apparently there were times when something like 20 stocks were "in the red". >

There is nothing to wonder about Dale's portfolio. He (as you sure know) post
his buy's and sell's.

Makes ME wonder, what is your reason for upper statement. This is not yahoo or
similar msg board. This is community, where members earn respect with their
work, not with bashing others.

Since this is OT I will not post any further about this subject.

Yes, Madharry. I've got "Margin of Safety" -- packed away in my garage. Wasn't
impressed with the book. My summary conclusion is that there's so much risk
involved with stocks- risk that people don't consider - that if they did, they
almost wouldn't invest. As a balance of risk vs. reward, because the focus
seemed unrelenting on risk, it was a somewhat discouraging discourse to read.

I suspect plenty of investors try to follow his Baupost picks. I've looked at
them when I could find them, didn't understand the value propositions of
several (some so esoteric they didn't trade much or financial data was
difficult to find), but I eventually bought a couple... and had no success.
Perhaps it was timing: I bought too late or I bought common when he bought
preferred, or I didn't hold on long enough or held too long. (I give him the
benefit of assuming that these stocks I did look at did work out okay for him.)

I don't understand the demand for the book. Imo, many better books out there
for all levels of value investing.
I'll retrieve the book and relook.

Well Mario, my question to you is "why have you preferred to go down the road
of assuming that my comments regarding 50% Gains Investing is 'bashing
others'"?
Have you not considered the possibility that my reason for the reference may
have more to do with raising debate on the issue of whether or not multi-stock
portfolios are the best form of stock market investment.
As I said to Paul Senior, in my reply to his message, I chose 50% Gains
Investing, as an example of this form of investing, because it’s well known to
most Board members, and, in addition, its results are there for all to see.

I also see no reason why the community, that you refer to, should not publish
their stock buys or sells.
However, I also see no reason why anyone shouldn’t be permitted to raise
questions, or enter into debate, regarding any specifics about stock market
investment strategy.
Personally, I believe one shouldn’t ever get too set in one’s ways with regard
to the systems and methods we use to analyse companies.
Surely keeping an open mind, with an ongoing willingness to sensibly discuss
and debate, will ensure that we constantly hone our systems and strategies of
Fundamental Analysis ?
In case you haven’t noticed, there’s a line in the "Founding Statement" of
‘Value Investing’ which states, "Schooling in the art of fundamental analysis
is also appropriate here."

And Mario, have you not also considered the possibility that maybe the reason
why I haven’t published that many stock preferences, buys or sells etc ..., is
because I don’t hop in and out of stocks as often as many members on this Board
do ?
In fact, considering that ‘Value Investing’ is purported to be about investing
according to the tenets of Fundamental Analysis, the numerous buying and
selling actions of some Board members reminds me more of what Day Traders, and
the like, tend to do.

Another reference in the Founding Statement refers to the Benjamin Graham
‘tradition’.
Well ... one of his most famous pupils, Warren Buffett, still has stocks in his
portfolio, such as Coca Cola, American Express and Wells Fargo, that he first
purchased over 18 years ago ! Obviously he hasn’t seen any need to hop into,
and out of, those on a regular basis.

My own personal strategy currently involves confirming QUALITY in a company,
confirming whether or not it’s currently cheap, and then deciding whether it’s
most likely to have the greatest percentage increase in its stock price in the
medium term. Once I’ve bought into several of those companies, I see no reason
to sell them until such time that they no longer meet the required criteria, or
something with better prospects comes into view. And I generally make those
decisions only after a company publishes its Financial Results. Therefore you
won’t read many mentions from me regarding buying or selling, because I don’t
do that much of it.

Personally, when I read of Portfolios that have a large number of stocks in
them, I have to wonder why that is, because, invariably, the performance of a
fair percentage of them will bring down the performance of the better quality
companies. It also indicates to me that the system, or strategy, used to choose
those poorer performing stocks in the first place is somewhat suspect.

The fact of the matter is, that those companies that produce regular profits
and provide ongoing value for their shareholders will exhibit certain criteria
and meet, or exceed, certain critical financial ratios. The poorer performing
companies won’t be able to manage that. Therefore it shouldn’t be ‘rocket
science’ to have a Portfolio of fewer, better Quality companies that will not
suffer from "performance dilution".
Even if HANS only performed as well as PDX did with a 12 month increase of 41%,
that was still better than 32% from 40+ stocks.
Should an investor or Portfolio manager be too risk averse to invest in only 2
stocks, I’m sure one could find 3 or 4 more stocks which would perform much as
well, and thereby not incur all that brokerage expense !

Of course, there's also the issue of a Portfolio Manager having a large amount
of investment capital available to invest, and the 6 or 10 stocks that he
targets may not have enough traded volume for what he wants to buy. He is
therefore "forced", in some way, to look at stocks that have much larger stock
volumes available. This often means he has to go for the larger cap. stocks
which don't necessarily perform that well.
This is the reason why I, personally, advocate that the individual investor
obtain the necessary stock analysis know-how for him/her-self, such that he/she
can buy into any Quality company without having to be too concerned about
available traded volume.

Needless to say, I respect your right to publish, or not to publish, any
further comments in this regard.
Hopefully, Mario, you won’t have to "wonder" any longer as to the "reason for
(my) upper statement".

Paul,

I don't understand the demand for the book. Imo, many better books out there
for all levels of value investing.

Could it be possible that since the book sells for several hundred dollars per
copy that the crowd believes since its price is that high that it offers a
comparable level of value?

Personally, I believe that the best book(s) that I ever read were by Robert
Hagstrom and Roger Lowenstein on Warren Buffett.

The next set of books that I enjoyed reading were money manager interviews by
Peter Tanous, Kirk Kazanjian, and John Train.

I've become quite fascinated as of late with crowd theories and have focused my
attention on that now.

Regards.

Bruwin:

Thanks for the information. I had to pass on all of them as they didn't meet my
criteria - some that I thought I would like are just in the wrong business (for
me) - although they are tempting (pdii especially so). Does he have any
additional recommendations ?

From my end, I picked up fdp (via long term call options), dswl and volvy
recently. Dswl is near my purchase price, volvy & fdp have moved up. Dswl &
volvy have been on my watch list for some time, I was just waiting for it to
reach my purchase price.
