----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Still a bit too much debt for me especially in this fickle economy. I would
like $1.2B less debt or $200M more sale per year. The forward PE is attractive
at 6 but I doubt the analyst are correct especially with the company's gloomy
outlook. The one positive is their dividend is now yielding 3.5% but I doubt
there will be any increases in the near future.

I will pass on this one. It looks like the company is still digesting their

Foster Wheeler AG (FWLT)
Corning Incorporated Common Sto(NYSE: GLW)
VALE S.A. American Depositary(NYSE: VALE)

I still own all three. I think FWLT and VALE can go 30% higher before they move
out of my value range and would be candidates for peeling off some shares for
sale. GLW has another 20% move before I would consider selling.

I have owned VALE since 8/2008 at a cost near current levels. Added some shares
in 9/2011 at $26.25/share. Still hold my FWLT shares that I bought 9/21/2011
@$19.89/share. My GLW shares were acquired in 2/2005 at around $5.50/share and
would never sell at the current price. I have been peeling off shares around
$22.00/share and have sold some $20 calls over the years when the opportunity
arises.

These positions account for 1.8% of the portfolio but only contribute a 1.5%
blended dividend yield (portfolio average is around 5%). The stocks when/if
they meet my fair value targets should represent a 2.4% position in the
portfolio. For me there is a lot more upside than down side.

FWIW by position rank I own 8x GLW and 3x VALE and 1x FWLT.

I guess I am still a buy and hold investor but I tend to hang onto value and
will only sell it when I feel I can get a "fair" price.

HPQ: Honestly, I sold out at the bottom. IMHO it's still a company with a lot
of brand value, a lot of good products and a lot of technology. With the right
leadership and execution, they can have a lot of sales and earnings. I just
thought that the board was pretty dysfunctional and I don't know if Whitman +
Lane will be great for the company. It's tough for people to be yanked in
different directions all the time. What happens if this is not the last of
reorgs and direction changes?

Product sales and margin trend wise HPQ is not easy to analyze. It has some
moat in terms of brand and enterprise relationships, but it's not a huge one
IMO. The PC and mobile business debacle definitely weakened their position.
Still it would be tough for me to evaluate the effect. Perhaps looking at .43
PSR is the right criterion to say that it's cheap. Looking at it another way,
HPQ is not in such a deep crap as NOK and RIMM are in terms of product
obsolescence and need to reinvent the company (or most of its products). So it
may be more attractive than NOK or RIMM as a potential turnaround. OTOH, if NOK
turns around it could easily go 2x-4x in ideal case. HPQ, I'd say 2x is
optimistic limit, since it did not lose so much as NOK did. All these three
companies are trading at similar PSRs

Company announces 3rd quarter earning on Thursday Nov. 3, 2011. There is also a
production update too.

<u>Double Eagle Petroleum Outlines Pinedale, Niobrara Drilling Plan</u>

http://www.epmag.com/Drilling/drillingnews/2011/August/item86538.php

From the article:"...2011 Exploration Projects

The company also plans to drill one Niobrara Oil Shale well in which Double
Eagle will have an estimated working interest of 93%. The company initially
planned two Niobrara exploratory wells but due to certain lease holders in the
area not cooperating in drilling plans, the company determined that the best
location and opportunity to gain formation knowledge was to drill in a section
which the company controlled. The company is awaiting final permit approval for
this well.

The company also is evaluating further development of the Main Fork Unit
Project (formerly known as Christmas Meadows/Table Top Unit). The company
previously drilled the Table Top Unit #1 well in 2007. The company is working
with a major integrated oil and gas company that has option farm-in rights to
advance further unit delineation, assist with costs related to seismic,
environmental analysis and, if necessary, an exploratory well. Assuming the
farm-in right is exercised; Double Eagle will have a 12%-16% working interest
after payout.

Prior seismic data has been reprocessed and a LIDAR (Light Detection and
Ranging) survey has been conducted. Preliminary development well locations,
pipelines and roads have been identified as part of a full field development
environmental impact study being conducted by the USFS. In 2011, surveying and
associated archeological and biological studies are being conducted along with
a source test in preparation for a potential 2D seismic acquisition program in
2012...."

Hi SergioH -

Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK)

Merck 3Q profit soars, beats analysts' views
Drugmaker Merck profit climbs from year-ago results weighed down by charges,
beats Street view 

From the article:"...Excluding more Schering-Plough acquisition and
restructuring charges in the latest quarter, adjusted income was 94 cents per
share, 3 cents per share higher than expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet.
They typically exclude one-time items.

Like other drugmakers, Merck continues to suffer from U.S. and European
government health programs reining in spending, generic competition to former
blockbusters and other problems.

The company raised the lower end of its 2011 forecast, to a new range of $3.72
to $3.76 per share, excluding one-time items. Analysts expect $3.73 per share.

Analyst Erik Gordon of University of Michigan's Ross School of Business was
upbeat about the results.

"Merck could become the only recent megamerger in pharma that is actually
working," he said. "Usually, the claims that a merger will create a stronger
new product pipeline and reduced costs pan out as firing lots of people and
overpaying for a pipeline that disappoints.",,,"

==============================================================

Analysts s/d be raising their 2012 estimates. PE is now around 9. Merck said it
expects revenue for all of 2011 to grow by mid-single digits from $46 billion
last year. That would indicate most growth is coming from beneficial exchange
rates and probably some price increases.

Therefore, I see this one priced fairly at 9 PE based on their organic growth
rate. You still get good exposure to their global foot print. They probably
also are able to maintain their pricing power looking into 2012.

I am a buyer below $30.00/share but would only start to peel off shares around
$40.00/share. My position in MRK is 1.6% of the portfolio. My buys go back to
2008 with an average cost around $28.50/share.

I'll assume the market in future will be similar to the past four months, and
so I have sold some stocks with a view to reentering at lower prices. Fwiw,
today I cut back ADM (as Clownbuck did yesterday), sold TCLP, VMC&LLL (at small
losses), and EL (not a value stock) with a view to buying several of these back
later and lower. I sold more BRS and closed CMI after it came off its 12-mo
highs today.

I averaged up a little on my few shares of MSFT. I'm going to increase my
position in this one if stock falls on no adverse news. I am believing the
margin-of-safety is there for this one, and so I should be willing to up my few
shares to take advantage of that.

As mentioned before WHR earning quality is very poor and getting poorer. The
Pension gaps are something to watch out for, they are getting larger because of
low interest rates that make it harder to earn a decent return on assets to
meet the liabilities. A few years ago, companies assumed return around 8% -

I don't remember where I read this. After WWII, the US debt as percent of GDP

lower than inflation over extended period, and got rid of debt reasonably

Hi Windgoof -

<Are you holding any NG companies long term?>

Yes

A few NG & Oil E&P companies (GST, GMXR, MHR)

Small CAP NG distributor/Utility (EGAS)

Several large interstate and intra-state NG pipeline & storage companies.
Mostly MLP and MLP funds that focus on NG & NG pipeline (TPZ, DPM, SEP, TCLP,
EPD, EEQ, EP, WMB, MDU, AGL, ATO)

NG construction companies that build infrastructure. (CBI, FWLT)

NG LNG shippers and terminal owners. (GASS)

Some pure play NG companies - CNX

Some steel companies that manufacture the NG pipe (GGB, FRD)

If you search this thread and use the term "NG" and the ticker symbol you will
find several posts on NG "value" plays. It's been an investment theme of mine
for the last 24 months since NG has been so low. I only want to own the
profitable companies at this stage. If they can survive and make money at the
current NG price, they will really make profits when NG price move higher.

Most if not all of these also pay pretty good dividends. You can build a basket
of these stocks and hold long term as I believe activity will be higher as they
complete the development of U.S. shale fields over the next 5-10 years. The
pipe line and storage companies will probably benefit the most from the build
out as they make money based on volume moved not necessarily the price of the
commodity.

Win phones before holidays. Now it's the question how much they can push the
phones in their best brand-loving markets. If they can, they should have pretty
clear sailing with totally new SW platform and much better SW development
organization within Microsoft.

Android and Apple are not as unassailable worldwide as it seems from US

RIMM IMHO is probably in much worse position. Now they have to pick Android or

From:Jurgis Bekepuris
NOK. Good question. Let's look at Q3 NOK numbers:
http://www.nokia.com/about-nokia/financials/quarterly-and-annual-information

I think that NOK is somewhat the right company to be valued by PSR. Assuming
that sales are around the bottom this year and will stay flat or recover next
year, the PSR is low at ~0.5. The opportunity is that NOK goes into 2012 with
completely new software stack - Microsoft Windows Phone - and respective phone
lineup. NOK still has a respectable brand equity and market share in basic
phones worldwide and they can turn that into the smartphone share now that they
are not stuck with Symbian and its problems. Windows Phone does not have high
acceptance so far, but the reviews are positive, so it's not a horrible choice.
And IMHO Apple/Android entrenchment is overestimated. Now, if I am wrong and
NOK cannot maintain or rise sales then we go to part 2 of this evaluation. :)

Part 2: sales suck, what are the assets? ~Euro14B book value minus ~7B
intangibles. Leaves euro~7B (US$10B) tangible book with ~2B
property/plant/equipment. Not great. NOK does have some attractive assets that
probably would value it above the tangible book: Navteq, patents. However, the
patent buyouts have slowed down and it's clear that only Microsoft could buy
NOK (perhaps INTC could too, but I doubt they are in this game). Still I think
that US$15-20B is a level where NOK would be quite attractive as a purchase.
So, I'd say on asset side we have a low bar valuation around there. That's
still ~30% down from here.

The upside is more fluid. Assuming current sales and 5% net margins and 15PE,
you'd get to 37B valuation. Assuming sales grow 10% and they can get 6% margin,
you'd get ~53B valuation. That's still less than 2x from current price. So
perhaps I was overoptimistically guessing more than 2x upside.

Overall, it does not look like there is a great risk-reward here, unless NOK
surprises more on upside than I estimate. What do you guys think?

Hi Jurgis -

What about the value of their Nokia Siemens Networks segment? I remember
reviewing the terms of their JV agreement and believe Siemens has first right
of refusal for acquiring the division. I am not too sure how their deals are
structured but in China they do have several projects. I believe there is some
type of reoccurring revenues from the service side after the network
infrastructure is built.

When I looked at it last year, I valued this division at between $2.00 - $3.00
per share but could be worth more to Siemans. This was their biggest asset that
I found to have value but not really reflected in the share price.

Their Network Division has built infrastructure Cell systems in South America

Gruma S.A.B. de CV (GMK)

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=GMK+Key+Statistics

Gruma, S.A.B. de C.V., through its subsidiaries, engages in the production,
distribution, and sale of corn flour, wheat flour, tortillas, and other related
products. Its products include rice, oats, packaged tortillas, grits, snacks,
preserves, hearts of palm, tortilla chips, corn chips, and potato chips, as
well as flatbreads comprising pita, naan, chapatti, pizza bases, and piadina.
The company also involves in the design, manufacture, and sale of machines for
tortillas and tortilla chips production. It operates in the United States,
Mexico, Venezuela, Central America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania. The company was
founded in 1949 and is headquartered in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico.

The corn tortilla maker suffered heavy losses on derivatives contracts during
the 2008 global financial crisis that substantially increased its debt load. As
a result the company sold the bulk of its 8.8 percent stake in financial group
Banorte in January 2011. $750M was raised in the sale and used to reduce their
LT debt.

Their debt profile looks rather good now with LT Debt only 2x annual net
income. Earnings from their core operations are quite strong and is priced with
a 3 PE. BV is $3.65/share so the company sells at 2x BV. Because of all of
their losses from their sour derivative deals, ROE and ROA & ROI are all out of
whack and are not very good predictors of future performance. Projected EPS
growth (5 year) is 39% and represents just how good their core business is
performing in the markets they are in. Their 5 year sales growth is at 11%. Two
analyst follow the company and they have very low expectations for the company
(perhaps only earning $1,00.share in 2012). Once earnings stabilize and growth
continues at double digit rates, The company could eventually be priced with a
double digit PE. Forward PE is 8 based on analyst current estimates.

===============================================================================

This one is on my watch list. I am not too sure where their earnings are now
that they have paid down debt, took the hit on their sour derivative deal in
2009 and sold off their bank holding stock for a one time gain, and just how
their FCF will now translate into earnings per share. Stock has been in a
trading range from $6.00/share to $9.00/share.

This should be a good grower if purchased at the right price. They had paid a
pretty good dividend for many years up to 2007 when they had all of their sour
derivative deals. Hopefully management has learned their lesson and will no
longer do leverage derivative transactions and rather focus on growing their
core business.

JNJ - I was looking for cold/flu medicine in a store and noticed how Tylenol
has almost completely disappeared from the store shelves as a brand. Previously
I've seen tons of Tylenol brand/subrands. Now there was only a single item with
Tylenol label. Not sure if this is the result of JNJs problems or if the store
simply puts more of cheap generic brands on the shelves. Either way I was
really surprised. It does not mean that JNJ will do poorly though. :)

their technology becomes outmoded and the brighter minds in the company move on
for more lucrative pay packages and the value investor gets a bargain based

re VALE - iron ore prices are falling rapidly and the Chinese are
re-negotiation existing contracts apparently. Steel stocks have been very weak
and my guess is that iron ore producers are not far behind. in addition, the
Brazil government has raised the iron ore royalty rate.

Earnings for Vale are in the process of being revised down, from 5.2$/share
recently to 4.5$ now. I expect this trend to continue. i like that they own
world class reserves with probably the lowest production cost but I don't like
the underlying trends. I also noticed that Vale stock has underperformed most
peers in the recent recovery bounce.

My first buy was at 29.1$ and was an mistake - my second buy was at 23$ and
lowered my overall cost basis to 26.xx$. I feel good when i make a mistake and
still exit without loss. My plan is to enter this name again around recent lows
(<22$/share).

As for FWLT, i noticed that MDR had very poor results. I decided to exist
before earnings to a avoid similar disaster. I felt that the risk/reward is not
good ahead of earnings.

These are not really value calls, I admit - but with a stock market correlation
of 0.86 what matters short term to be in or out, not so much what you buy.
These stocks above area all high beta stocks and I felt i needed to reduce my
risk exposure. I think i get entries again in these names with a better risk
reward (although not necessarily lower prices).

Good points on VALE. Barclays cut their price target to $37 from $42.00 today.

Vale S.A. (VALE)

I am in this one for the long term and believe VALE holds significant core
assets. It's not a big position in the portfolio but goes with my theme of
holding companies that own "real" assets (ie mineral) which provides protection
from debasing of the U.S. dollar.

From a recent Seeking Alpha article: (
http://seekingalpha.com/article/303725-vale-shows-record-profit-on-rising-iron-
re-and-nickel-volumes?source=yahoo ):'...Vale Entered into a Strategic alliance
with Millrock Resources for Copper-Gold deposit exploration in Alaska. As per
the terms, Vale will fund Millrock for further research and early-stage
exploration. Vale will spend $1 million annually for the first two years of the
exploration. On completion of exploration, Vale is entitled to a 65 percent
interest if it pays $200,000 to Millrock resources and spends $3.5 million over
the next three years for the project development and feasibility studies. Vale
also has an option to extend its interest to 75 percent by undertaking the
total cost of the project development and implementation.....".

Therefore, I get a little more gold exposure with VALE than I do in my largest
holding BHP. VALE represent a 0.5% of the portfolio and generates a 2.2%
dividend. I will peel off a few shares on any price above $34.00/share and buy
more shares below $20.00/share. The 200DMA is $29.10/share and the 50DMA is
$24.64/share.

Did you exit out of your Foster Wheeler AG.(NasdaqGS: FWLT) completely? I put
in an order to peel off 50% of my Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N(NYSE: CBI) at
$39.90/share. That would be a 52wk high. I bought my original lot 6/2010 for
$17.83/share and think $39.90/share is at the high end of fair value.

It is encouraging that SHAW is shopping around their energy divisions both of
these companies have very profitable energy construction divisions. That is the
main reason I own them as the energy construction sector (OIL & NG) is one of
the fastest growing areas for these companies.

McDermott International Inc. (MDR) may actually be a possible value Buy with
their disappointing earnings announcement. It looks like it might be a company
specific issue with some of their projects coming in at less than expected
profits (could be a project specific problem not an industry thing). I have
this one on my BUY list. IF my CBI gets sold I may add this one to my group.

What would consider a fair value PE to pay for something like GOV that yields
7%? I would think they would be a better payer than other REIT companies that
lease buildings to the public retail and/or office space sector.

My portfolio has about 5% exposure to REITs. GOV and data centers are my
biggest positions.

GV0YWlsZWQ-

My biggest concern with all the REITs is their use of leverage LT debt
financing and these positions are vulnerable to any type of credit lock up.
This comes at the benefit of being good dividend payers, Most of the REITs I
own have properties exclusively located in the U.S. but any issues in Europe
would probably spill over to the U.S. debt markets.

Good point regarding the reduction of USPS properties. I would think that the
State & Federal government sector would be doing more lease back deals with
somebody like GOV being the operator. Many of the Cities (ie San Francisco) are
doing these lease back transactions to generate upfront cash to meet their
immediate cash flow needs. Personally, I see it as just a short term solution
and in the long run the City ends up paying more for their office space.

Thanks to Clownbuck, this has been one of the best performers since my purchase

ADM: stock down with market and apparently also, or more so, because company's

"As for oilseeds processing, the unit's profit dropped 28% while volume fell
0.8% as challenging margin pressured profitability. Industry margins have been
suffering broadly around the world due to excess processing capacity.

"It was a difficult and challenging market environment this quarter," ADM Chief
Executive http://topics.wsj.com/person/w/patricia-a-woertz/468 said in a
conference call with investors. She said the company sees the margin
environment "modestly improving" in the short term.

Corn prices have climbed sharply since mid-2010 due to disappointing U.S. crops
and continued growth in demand that has drawn U.S. supplies to uncomfortably
low levels. Prices are generally expected to remain high at least until next
year's harvest.

But ADM said demand for its corn products remains strong, with
high-fructose-corn-syrup volume climbing 15% in 2011. The company said it was
optimistic about sweetener prices in 2012, and Ms. Woertz added that ethanol
demand will remain"

-----------
It's going to be interesting (for me anyway) to follow fructose manufacturers'
attempts to change the labeling on food products. Apparently "high fructose
corn syrup" has become a pejorative --some groups associating it with food
products that lead to obesity or unhealthy lifestyle. The new name the
producers want is "corn sugar". The cane sugar people oppose the name change.

“Eveillard is a value investor but one who has always kept an eye on the big

Where should people invest today? Eveillard: “In the long-term, emerging
markets will be the place to invest. But there will be bumps along the way, and
corporate governance is still bad, particularly in Russia and China.

There are indirect ways to invest in emerging markets. Look at high-quality
global businesses that do a lot of business in Asia and South America.

These large-cap stocks have not done terribly well the past few years, but they
lost much less than more-cyclical stocks did in the 2007-09 bear market.

Just Buy the E&P companies that have both Oil & NG reserves and are close to or

thread for different valuations and discussions about the company. The kicker
is they also have $3.00/share of value in a Midstream company (a NG gathering
subsidiary) which the market seems to be only valuing for pennies.

I also own some E&P preferred shares to generate income: MHRpC, MHRpD, GSTpA.

re TM - yes they will weather the storm. the question is if they will prosper
though. I feel the newest models in the US are more competitive than what
Toyota had to over during the last 3-4 years but I am not sure it's enough.

One thing that has not dissipated yet, is that the car demand in Europe has
become very weak during the last 6 month. Evidence of this are the very poor
results that Peugeot has been showing recently. Another piece of evidence is
that apparently a price war has broken out in Germany (one of the stronger car
markets so far) where the average rebate from list price has reached 18% ( read
that in the Handelsblatt magazine), which is unheard of. This means that
operating margins for European car makers should come under strong pressure.
This may affect Toyota somewhat less but is very relevant for VW or those that
are bullish on car suppliers (most of them have quite a bit of business in
Europe).

Paul - It's based on a valuation of $325M for their Midstream business (125M
shares outstanding in MHR common). They already turned down $125M and when it
becomes operational (1st phase) in Q1 2012 or Q2 2012, the market value in my
estimate s/d be $400M. When they complete phase 2 (basically increasing
capacity and adding more processing/ NG compression liquids) CEO Evans stated
that the "plant" would be worth close to $1B.

I also remember a 3rd party might purchase all the interests in the processing
facility and the gathering business (w/ gathering contracts) would be operated
by a newly formed MLP spun off to MHR shareholders. Therefore the complete
operation may be a bit less if the compression plant is not included (MHR may
keep a 50% interest but controls the combined plant to help him secure long
term NG gathering end user contracts - smart deal).

Either way lots a value is being created in this business that I do not believe
is factored in the stock at the present price of $4.30/share. As time moves
closer to Phase I operation (w/ no JV deal to dilute the value of the asset),
the more MHR common creates value.

As you know many of these NG gathers in the form of MLPs have performed quite
well since 2009. The early NG gathers in the shale fields are already at
capacity and the very large operators are scrambling to buy out the small
players (take note of the recent big pipeline deals EP buyout etc.).

MHR is set to be a large player in the Utica Shale NG gathering and processing.
I am anxious to get my MLP units from MHR. These units may be the eventual
"golden egg". Could be worth more than the E&P side of the business in the long
run.

Therefore, I believe my $3.00/share valuation is conservative.

FWIW I have made five buys in 2011 in MHR; from prices ranging from $2.74/share
to $4.88/share. I made one sale at $5.00/share early in the year selling a
covered call. It's my number one holding in my E&P basket at 25%. SSN is my
number two holding at 18.35% and VOG is #3 at 10.52%.

1) in order to be worth 1B$, it need to generate 100M$/annually in EBITDA
2) How much is is going to cost to do all above. Typically, expansion projects
like that go for 5x EBITDA multiples, which means they would have to invest
500M$ in capital (250M$ in Equity / 250M$ in debt).
3) There is a time lag between putting the assets into the ground and
generating EBITDA.

The ghist of my post is that you can't count the value of the assets without
accounting for the cost to build them. Sure building something for 500M$ and
then selling it for 1B$ is nice (if you can get it) but you have to include
that the build out need so to be pre-financed which is not a minor feat given
MHR high cost of capital.

getting hurt in a car crash because he didnt bother wearing a seatbelt I might
have been more cautious about it from the get go.

Hi Nikhiljog

MDU is one of my favorites. It's a 1.5% position in the portfolio. Not only do
they own an E&P subsidiary w/ quite a bit of acreage in productive U.S. shale
regions but they operate one of the largest NG storage and distribution
networks in the nation. They own huge underground caverns that they use to
store NG.

I am a buyer below $19.00/share and would consider peeling off some of my
higher priced shares above $22.00/share. This one is a long term hold for me.
Lots of value in there different divisions.
If you like MDU you might also like AGL.

Hi Grommit -

A pretty good report. They delivered on their FFO growth (over 16%) and that
was/is the thesis for my Buy. The company is building value as they grow their
data center base. I plan to eventually peel off my higher shares purchased
6/2011 at current prices. My winning Buy was following you in at $13.00/share
when the market was crashing at the end of September.

If the stock can string together a few strong quarters like reported today,
this one could be close to a double in 18 months. If they also raise their
dividend ( just over 3% yield) from time to time it will help support higher
prices too.

Hi EKS,

You were holding GMXR a while back. Don't know if you're still holding to that
one. Did you see there earnings and the hit it took today?
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:11/3/2011 2:00:27 PM
From:E_K_S
Yes I saw it. The company is spending more money than they are earning. Also
they are asking some of their Note holders to trade in their notes (at a
discount) for a new issue so they can free up money to continue their drilling
program.

This is a risky deal. I own a small amount of the GMXR preferred and a small
amount of the common shares. I may buy a bit more of the preferred if I can get
at a deep discount (perhaps around $10.00/share). It could be a long time to
get your money back (if at all) because they have to finish drilling, get the
wells producing and need NG prices to move higher.

There is value in the land holdings they have and in the reserves they own but
any buyer will want to buy at a discount. GMXR is in no position to sell at a
premium to BV. They will be lucky to get BV.

On the positive side, the company has a few good well prospects that if their
money does not run out, and they can get them producing, future cash flows will
be much better.

In this environment, you are probably better off on staying with those E&P
companies that are near breaking even or already booking profits. It also helps
to own a basket of these companies since the big winners can off set the losses
from the losers. It's hard (if not impossible) to just pick out the winners.

GMXR. Stock is undervalued based on assets (Bakken&Niobrara land, and proved
gas reserves in TX). Company is overly indebted--- the land and gas production
don't seem to be generating enough cash flow ---so the issue seems to be, can
they monetize their assets before they run out of time/money? Their recent
presentation describes what they are planning to do to extricate themselves
from this situation.

I've added a few shares to my very losing position this morning. A bet that
management would have the financial savvy to make use of the company's assets
in a way that increases cash flow before the debt burden overwhelms the
company. Of course, -g-, it was management that got themselves in this
situation, so one could wonder about their perspicacity and ability to be
successful.

All sales today raising cash. CBI is near the top of my value range. With the
way FWLT traded (sell first buy value later), I decided to peel off a few
shares and book my gain on 50% of my position. Sold higher price shares in MDU
and COR to book a small gain. I doubled up (and more) on both at lower levels.

It looks like one buys the dips and sell the rally building a longer term
position with low cost basis. That is why you buy on the way down, let the dust
settle and then sell the higher priced shares leaving the lower priced shares
as the "value" holds.

This type of trading doesn't produce the multi bagger gains so I still plan to
sit on a portion of my good value buys.

JEF by now is 1/4 of the investment portfolio? I don't know. Gurufocus shows
LUK manager Ian Cumming with 54.5M shares as of June. Say maybe 55.5M now. I
don't know how they account for their purchases on their balance sheet (at cost
or mark-to-market). They may have bought most shares $20-27/each; now JEF's
fallen to about $12. If JEF on the LUK balance sheet is still valued by LUK at
say $25/sh, that'd be 55.5M x $25/244M shares out. Or about $5.7/sh. Yahoo
shows LUK's stated bv as $27.81/sh., so I'd say conservatively JEF might be
about 5.7/27.81 ~ 20% of LUK assets (as measured by latest book value number I
see)

You are right the last ten years has not been good for tech stocks. i like hp

2. current earnings yield 17%
3. 126B Rev 51B Market Cap manageable LT debt/EQ.
4. New CEO $1 salary but bonus if she meets certain economical goals, also the
option to by over 1million shares at $23.96. more incentive to increase share
price
5. John Paulson bought 1Billion worth of shares earlier this yr at a much
higher price.
cash cow is printers but also keeping pc business... building up services

I have to admit i brought this up before and bought in when it dropped to $22.

As an outsider who never owned the stock, the choices that the board made for

They maintain a high debt to equity ratio.

Take a look at their cash flow for specifics. The dividend has been maintained
by selling shares and borrowing money.

re NS
>>Take a look at their cash flow for specifics. The dividend has been

IT is a little bit more complicated than that. For MLP's earnings are not as
important than the Distributable cash flow. the distributable cash flow is the
cash flow - maintanance capex:
http://www.mlpinvestor.com/2010/07/27/distributable-cash-flow-explained/

This is the metric that matters. Since MLP are pass through vehicles and
typically don't keep spare cash around, new Capex has to be financed by a
combination or new units and debt (typically 50:50 for an MLP with investment
grade credit rating).

I like NS but i like NSH (the general partner) even more and bought a few
shares recently. the general parts get's incentive distribution rights that
lever the General partner to growth. the feature i particulary like is that the
GP does not get diluted when Lp units are issued, it's a free ride.
http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/ml_partnerships.asp#axzz1cmcopfq

NSH itself is unlevered and get;'s about 50% from it's cash flow from IDR and
the remainder from the ~11.5% stake in NS units it holds. the insider are
buying NSH, FWIW:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=NSH+Insider+Transactions

Noth NS and NSH have suffered somewhat from limited growth, which imo is due to
2 reasons:
1) limited Capex after Y2008 to avoid dilution and getting stuck with expensive
financing
2) Somewhat ill conceived diversification into Asphalt refining (~20% of DCF)

I like however that they have a lot of pipelines that are currently
underutilized. Some of those pipelines now get a second lease on life with all
those oil shales liquids looking form transportation, so they reverse the flow
and brush them up, which is cheaper than building anew. They have some nice
projects in the Eagle ford shale going on where they can invest a few hundred
million $ yielding 4-6x EBITDA multiples. My guess is that they will issue new
NS shares to the amount of 200M$ soon and NSH will get a free ride on the cash
flow generated with expansions project that get paid from the capital raised.
That is another reason i like NSH better right now.
