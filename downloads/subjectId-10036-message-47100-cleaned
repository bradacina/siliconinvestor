<< "At 1% margins, a slight miss leads to losses.">>

<<That sometimes seems to be the reason that people won't buy such stocks. In
my experience, I've found that that concern about low absolute margins to be
almost unfounded. First, companies can often go years or decades doing okay
with low margins. Especially if they have a lot of sales per share (low p/sales
ratio). Grocery chains, for example. >>

Paul - I agree. The grocery business is a high volume, low margin business
eternally, never mind decades. Looking at profit margin misses the point.

Look at ROA and ROE, not profit margins for this type of business. Sure, you
won't find hit-it-out-of-the-park Microsoft numbers (for which you'll typically
pay through the nose), but you will often find them sufficient. I find boring
is good when looking for values.

Hi EKS. A few notes on IRET as they reported earnings last week and came up a
little short on EPS and revenue. Their apt. segment was the best performer and
their office segment was the worst.

As of the end of 2011, only 26% of IRET's folio consisted of residential
holdings and by the way, only 15% of their folio is invested in North Dakota.

It's amazing that even BMW - one of the best companies in the field - has
margins of ~3%. Was just looking at the 2011 financials. Otherwise numbers are
OK, but the stock is far from cheap unless I am looking at numbers in a wrong
way. (Yahoo says P/E is 9 for BMW.DE, but I don't get that).

I am also not sure whether I should go with Buffett's quip that 'When a

Hi Sergio -

Thank you for the update on IRET. This is a position I bought for the IRA which
now represent 1.3% of that portfolio. I have two different Buys 7/2011 and
4/2011. The dividends are reinvested back into stock w/ a 5% discount offered
by the company. The initial idea was to seek out a REIT that owned properties
in the Midwest oil shale region that could benefit from the drilling dollars
being invested in that area. IRET was the only major REIT I could find that was
a "pure" play on this theme.

My investment is still underwater but I will continue to hold as they still
maintain their foothold in North Dakota and eastern Montana. As the real estate
market stabilizes and eventually increases in value over the coming years,
IRET's properties should benefit. If they can be profitable in the tough times,
then when times get better EPS should get better too.

Many of the standard value measures are really not that good. The company does
carry a lot of debt, BV is only $4.84/share (Price/BV=1.76) and the only
positive I see is their forward PE should come down to 11 and the company
should have sufficient cash flow to maintain their 6.7% dividend.

In summary, I am still betting on more growth and better returns on the
properties they manage. The key is for them to increase their cash flow(s) from
their portfolio of properties they own and/or acquire new properties (I like
their interest in multi-family units) where they can generate a higher ROI on
these new investments.

The company is still small enough to make significant changes that will impact
their EPS. So maybe some of these new property acquisitions will allow them to
do just that. At least this is the right time in the cycle to be buying
properties.

I always liked BHI for their proprietary tools (Diamond tools, fluids). I felt
they have a moat in this business. the pressure pumping business is a commodity
service at it's core and requires heavy Capex expenses.
I used to own BJS (the pressure pumping unit of BHI) before it was taken out
and I did not feel that the economics are good unless there are capacity
constraints. What I expect now to happens, is that not only demand will fall
for pressure pumping services, but prices will fall as well, which will lead to
a double whammy in revenues and margins.

I think I would buy BHI probably in the 30's assigning only little value to the
pressure pumping business, but I would have to run the numbers again. BHI
problems will be shared by many service companies that have been benefiting
from the fracking boom, imo. Those without proprietary products lines like BHI,

Yes, Mr. Gogo, an interesting article. Ultimately for me though,
unsatisfactory. I read it briefly twice, not sure what I'm supposed to do with
the information. I guess the author's point is that he/they are cautious - and
I should be too - because profit margins are very high now, and at an
unsustainable level, and that might mean stock prices (p/e's) might fall and/or
p/sales. (price/sales divided by profit margins (i.e earnings/sales = profit
margins) = price/earnings). Looks like author compares current high profit
margins with smoothed(averaged) p/e prices. Maybe should be smoothed profit
margin numbers vs. smoothed p/e numbers.

Afaik, I'm one of a few people around here who mentions incorporating profit
margin numbers in determining whether a stock is a value buy. I don't want to
get into details, essentially though for me it's a question of what am I
willing to pay for the profit margins I'm looking to expect, based on the
company's historical profit margin performance. Google, which I've mentioned
occasionally over several years has profit margins of 25% or more. What am I
willing to pay for a company like that if they can continue this performance?
How do I handicap that versus something like ALU which shows profit margins of
7% (per Yahoo) now, but a string of losses; or vs. BHI which shows about 9% now
(Yahoo) but between 4% and 15% in recent past years? Questions I ask myself.

I guess my point is that I look at profit margins at the company level,
comparing each company to its history and to its other metrics. I'm not much
concerned about high profit margin levels currently being seen by the author on
stocks in general.

BHI was around 37$ in Fall 2010, after they announced the BJS takever. i think
it will get there again. Stated book is irrelevant, they have now 7B$ in
goodwill due to the BJS takeover mostly. A lot of the 7B$ that they invested in
BJS will eventually be written off. BJS made 300M$ in earnings pre-merger and I
don't think that they will be able to hold that earnings level, so in given
that BJS is a very capital intense business, it is probably worth less than 3B$
now.

Due to the merger, BHI has added almost 40% in share count and the balance
sheet looks worse now than in 2009/2010 (Cash component of merger and low FCF
due to heavy Capex). I think they blew it big time with the BJS takeover and it

Since I mostly buy high-ROE companies, I have a feeling that adding some points
for high margins just double counts the company's success. In other words,
their high ROE is due to the high margins, so I can't give them extra for the
margins. This is not true for WMT/TSCDY/etc. who achieve the high ROE with low
margins, but that just reflects their business.

Something like ALU, I just don't buy at all.

So overall, I don't spend much time on margins. I am just careful with
companies that have OK'ish ROE with low margins where the business is not
obviously a low margin business or where I think that the company does not have
enough moat like WMT to sustain even the low margins. Obviously, low margins
with a lot of debt is a recipe for disaster even when debt is used to spruce up
ROE.

Thanks for the article Georgi.

I just skimmed over it, but the margins do seem a bit stretch.... hoping
looking for value with decent margin of safety will hedge this. I dont own that
many stocks though, not sure how this effects me.

Is this something us value investors need to be aware of?

What macro things do you all even look at now that i think about it?

My only two thoughts are either low interest rates/cheap money/household
debt/emerging market spending are helping drive the margins or the tech sector
is becoming a larger part of the broad market.

Re: What do you guys think about 

<<Why is it trading at a really low price?>>

It looks like they recently guided down for the year, to the surprise of some
analysts. Pork prices are off and this is apparently significant to their
profitability.

Of course, if this is truly a solid company such reasons for price declines are
a value investor's dream and I have made most of my money on companies with
good long term histories and poor recent short-to-medium term results.

See MCD in Q1 2003. The Motley Fool piled on to the pack that wrote off the
company that invented fast food just as the price went under $15/share (as I
recall). I read a lot of huffing and puffing about how Wendy's at 6% market
share was eating McD's lunch (ha, ha) at 50% market share. McD's subsequently
released several hit new products and the rest, as they say, is history.

It was very similar to analysts writing off Coke at a time when Coke still had
6 of the top 10 drink products as Pepsi made all sorts of noise and the book
"How Pepsi Won the Cola Wars" was released.

All this said, every time I see a Chinese company that appears to be a great
value, I immediately start to wonder when that company that exposes Chinese
sham companies will release a photo of an outhouse that's carried on the
balance sheet as $1B worth of real estate.

It's unfair, but there are so many scams it's hard to sort them out. I think
that this, and to a greater extent, the speculative general expectation for
Chinese companies has conspired to whack the price.

If you can confirm that the company's reporting is accurate, this looks like a
pretty good situation for a value investor.

Yes, it does seem that high margins double weights the high roe. However,
sometimes I find companies with very high profit margins (margins that might be
sustainable), moderate or only very good roe, yet with a high enough p/e to
where I wouldn't buy the stock if it were only on my usual p/e to roe
valuation. GOOG and QCOM are examples where the very high profit margins
weighed heavily on my decision to buy -- those superb margins trumped what I
would otherwise avoid (very high p/e but not an off-setting outstandingly high

My assumption is that almost all these Chinese companies are frauds on the face
of it, or fraudulently run. I've got the scars from purchases of maybe 15 of
them to remind me of that. If my experience is typical, it's going to be
difficult to get speculators/investors to get back into the Chinese market when
there's no evidence that foreign investors can rely on financial reports or
Chinese laws/regulations. So some of these "value" stocks may just languish.

In my experience, everything looked good -- p/e, roe, cash, debt, sales -- yet
there's nothing that the investor ultimately gets other than creamed as the
truth comes out. My feeling is that the people running these companies will
eventually go to the next higher level of fraud -- give "investors" something
to draw them in so as to prop up the stock price while the fraud continues. And
that would be a cash dividend -- if the real company owners haven't siphoned
the cash off the books yet.

I'm guessing the Chinese managements haven't wanted or needed (or been able) to
institute a dividend, and so any Chinese company that now actually does share
some of the profits with a cash dividend to small investors might be looked at
as 'possibly' legit and maybe a possible speculation. For me, I only hold one
mainland Chinese stock -- and it's just a few shares as a speculation -- XIN.

So you think that a dividend can be used for fraud paranoia too? What is the
scenario you imagine? The company gives shareholders 10-20% stock price
dividend, then what? Announces secondary? The stock price does not really go up
much and would drop on secondary anyway. What other fraud possibilities you see
that the dividend would enable? Isn't it silly to give out huge stock pile of
cash as dividend that could be siphoned to the fraudulent management instead?
And if the company is a fraud, where did it get the cash from anyway?

if the metrics are good, if the cash is "supposedly" there, then for me, I'm

Yes, it is. What is your point though? It is actually the most
shareholder-friendly way of transferring cash from the sub to the parent, since
all shareholders get the cash equally. I assume you (or shareholders) would be
much more unhappy if SNDA would have bought out GAME with all its cash on the
books at pre-dividend price. They could have done that quite legally you know
since they have 96% voting power. How about the fact that SNDA still provides
GAME with a number of professional services. They could have just hiked up the
prices and gotten the cash from GAME this way. I'd guess you (shareholders)
would be much less happy too.

So overall, if you are complaining that they paid dividend to themselves, I
really think that the complaint is rather silly and misplaced.

Seems like GAME should be consolidated in SNDA's books already

I'm not sure how this is important in anyway. There are tons of subs trading in
markets. Whether they are consolidated on parent's books affects only parent
accounting. It does not affect the sub in any way. Unless you mean something
different than what you said.

BTW, if you want to complain about SNDA's treatment of GAME, I wonder what you
think about BRK's treatment of WSC. WSC was 90+% owned by BRK. WSC CEO Munger
spent most of his time on BRK business. WSC money was always used by BRK the
way they wanted. Remaining WSC shares were bought out at a price BRK suggested
without any due process. Overall, I'd say the treatment of minority
shareholders was quite horrible. And this happens when the parent is one of the
most admired US companies... ;)

Fair enough. :)

My story:
- Made great money on Chinese stocks 2008/09 - 2010.
- Lost bunch of money on frauds 2011.
- Made some (bunch) of money on management buyout arbitrage in 2011, when
nobody believed that managements will come through with money/votes/payout.
- Made some (bunch) of money in 2012 with GAME divvy. 20% divvy almost zero
risk with less than 1 month holding period. Shoulda bought even more, but I had
position limits due to it being Chinese company. Sold some, holding some longer
term to see how this plays out.

Having a lot of people skeptical and some Chinese RTOs still imploding is a
good place to be. It means that no one believes any good news and everyone
tries to find some kind of nefarious motives in everything. Management is quite
self-dealing too, but not necessarily totally against shareholders, since they
are large shareholders themselves. That's what makes some plays quite cheap.
Management buyout arbitrage premiums have shrunk to unplayable levels though,
since most of them went through.

Sergio -

Excellent results on DG (last $41.13). I noticed it is near a 52 week high too.
Using next year earnings I arrive at a GN of $30.76. What's your exit strategy
for this one. Do you peel off shares as the stock moves higher and/or hold
expecting a surge in earnings (Forward PE only 14) and/or take out seed money
and let the rest ride?

I have always been early to sell on a lot of my winners. My exit strategy
usually is determined if I have a better investment to move the proceeds into.
Diversification is important too. Of the banks I like WFC but right now, I am
still avoiding all banks.

So as you begin to exit one or more of your winners, it would be nice to hear
your thinking; how you arrive at a fair value price range, if your sell is
determined on something else you want to buy and is your sell a sector switch
and/or just basic diversification.

FWIW, BOX is at the high end of their price range (like a lot of stocks) and to
me it is not at a value buy level but if you are looking for an income
generator, it could still be a candidate. Another one similar to BOX but builds
coal rail cars is RAIL. I am looking at adding some more SDRL on any sell off
below $36 and will be selling some of my SFL to finance the buy. Both generate
good income(almost 8%) but SDRL should be able to increase earnings faster as
they should be able to get higher day rates on their next contract extension.
Their last fixed day rate was just north of $600k/day! My pick of the three is
SDRL.

I'm interested in buying stocks of local banks involved in shale plays. I've

I'm considering adding more now -- although I feel I'm very late. On the one
hand, the company/stock should do okay over the next five years (my estimated
holding period). Otoh, the stock's already up, and in a market correction this
year, it may fall back again to provide a good or better buying opp.

Fwiw, for the Eagle Ford shale and infrastructure, I recently did step up to

I don't have an exit strategy for DG just yet. Have you read about their
expansion plan, including adding more stores and using their sales model to
offer staple products?

Basically, their model is stores much smaller than big box in rural locations
where it is more advantageous for a consumer to pick up an item at DG rather
than drive 300 miles to a big box store. According to DG there's plenty of room
in America to expand. Despite lower same store sales than forecast and a likely
slowdown in their growth rate, I'll stick with DG because their strategy is
working and the valuations are reasonable. I think that there's a story in this
weekends Barrons on DG.

I might maintain my portfolio differently than most. I can only keep track in
the way I want to of in a limited amount of stocks. So, when my portfolio can't
fit in one page, I start selling what I think are the weakest stocks. This is
what I do when my returns are in the green. When my returns are in the red,
somehow I find it much easier to keep my portfolio holdings on one page

SDRL is already in my folio and the recent sell off in oil and gas stocks is
offering an opportunity to add shares. I would also look to buy below 36. And
there's huge support at 34 if that fails.

to slow down in Chinese demand but Peru has slowed down mining. Maybe the sell
off is overdone. Not sure.
