ABS and WM are "stinkers"

http://fnews.yahoo.com/street/00/03/02/wrong_000302.html

ABS just announced that they are comfortable with $0.70 per share in the qtr.
Those stinkers!

And LEN is a stinker too. Old economy. Will home building be revolutionized by
the web? They have a new acretive acquisition, a stock buyback and a Merrill
upgraded them. Conspiracy with Merrill perhaps?
http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/000217/bb7.html
That link implies 5% over 2.83 for year ending Nov 2000 = around $3 per share.
Nice growth, nice PE.

Anyway...Thestreet link clearly shows the mentality investors face. Don't look
at the company look at the momentum. Invest with the herd and prosper, is the
mantra. To go where others fear to tread is contrary (so to speak).

enjoy!

PS -- another tidbit:
At $95, Palm (with sales of $259 million and profits of 12.9 million in the
latest quarter) has a mkt cap of about $53 billion. And Palm will be facing
stiff competition in the future. Free sales growth is not assured, let alone
profitability.

LEN capitalization is under $1 Billion. While profits were $173 million last
year. Over $3 billion of revenue.

This makes sense. You buy some of your equity (a balance sheet item of course)
in a foreign currency. Then you suffer a 2:1 devaluation of that currency
relative to your native currency. That portion of your equity is halved. It
shows up in the reconciliation of equity, and in the adjustments to net income
if the company is progressive about accepting the FASB ruling on the subject.
But that adjustment doesn't show up in the standard reported P&L. It's just in
the notes to the financial statements.

So where is it in cash flows? Well you've already spent the money on acquiring
that equity. That equity is now halved in value. But then the cash was already
spent. So cash flow isn't affected. So it is an illuminating but potentially
irrelevant accounting maneuver. For instance, if Equifax from here on operates
in Brazil cash-flow positive, all the maneuver does is hyperinflate true return
on equity.

The adjustment I was referring to was really just balance sheet-based. As far
as ongoing expenses and revenues of the enterprise, then that is dependent on
changes in the currency exchange rate in the future. Basically, though, my
question is answered for these foreign-currency adjustments to equity: no
effect on cash flow, keep it in invested capital, and make sure to add it back
in as an equity-equivalent.

Right?

That is how I understand it however, bear in mind that if you are investing in
a company that is reliant upon fx revenues and its liabilities be they accounts
payable or debt are in US dollars there could be trouble up ahead as all of us
the ability to repay debt becomes impaired even though there is no immediate
impact on cash flow. That is my understanding anyway.

FX effects --

I am sure you are aware that many companies will hedge their foreign (net)
asset positions. That would cover the exposure to FX movement in the balance
sheet.

But (this point was made here previously) you still have all the foreign future
cash flows which will be affected by a currency movement. A company could hedge
the cash flows also, I guess, or could choose to be exposed to the risk (I
think this is normal -- to only hedge the asset). The effect of currency
movement on future cash flows will not affect the bal sheet so will not affect
present earnings (like the asset revaluation would). But it would affect the
valuation of the company since the cash flow denominated in US dollars would
change.

You also have to be careful because there are lot of nuances . In some
countries there is a revaluation for fixed assets which is done periodically to
account for inflation. So if there is inflation and a devaluation against the
US dollar and a revaluation that might wash out. if you then try to make some
kind of adjustment for that devaluation of fixed assets you might be double
counting somewhere. I think thses adjustments are tough to do unless you have
the companies actual ledgers but I am no CPA and I am sure there are readers
with a much more current and professional grasp of these issues.

OT I have just taken a look at AOR- Aurora Foods. This is not a recommendation
just a topic for discussion. This company buys sagging food brands and tries to
rejuvenate them. A Goldman Sachs IPO at $21 in 1998. There were large amounts
of insider buying in December of 1999 at around $9 a share, insiders own over
70% of the company. At that time the shares appeared to be a bargain . In
February they announce that they are delaying earnings subject to an audit
completion. Later they announce that earnings will be restated and that 4
executives have resigned. stock drops from the 7s into the 3s. Moody's
downgrades the debt citing expectations of reduced cash flow going forward and
the class action suits commence. Now it seems to me that the issue consists of
when promotional expenses are expensed so that we are talking non-cash
adjustments. Presumably the brand names remain intact. Has anyone followed this
soap opera and are there any lessons that as investors we can learn from this?

Armin AOR - I had looked at it prior to debacle, intrigued by the orphan brand
concept, but didn't buy any. Since the crash to 3's, I looked further & didn't
see any huge warning signs in the financials - Cash flow from operations was
erratic and margins appeared to dip a bit in Sept qtr, but nothing that would
have alerted to this debacle.
Currently investors and analysts are waiting for the other shoe to drop - 4 top
execs don't hit the door arguing with auditors over timing of accounting
treatment of promotion costs - there's more to it than that - probably a lot
more. Some folks on Yahoo boards are looking at modest market cap and thinking
"It's got to be worth more than that" Which is correct, until you add in the
debt - total liabilities nearly $1Billion, most of it incurred buying brands
when brands were valued a bit more than currently [Look at Kellogg for example
of this].
So the key issues from current investment perspective:
What more will be revealed about the accounting [Those of us that have looked
at/danced with CD, MAT, & WMI know this can play out over time in stages].
If the accounting is adjusted to reveal owner earnings, is the equity priced
with margin of safety after debt is considered.
Who's gonna do it - the entire top tier of management hit the door. Investment
firms with large stakes are holding the reins - but they don't have the skills
to run the busines and so must find a managment team. Since the key to this
business is maintaining and building brand equity, marketing skills are
critical. If the board picks badly or waits too long, value could be impaired.
It's a real shot in the dark - I gotta see more cards, probably still won't
play because the debt looks like such a hurdle - could easily see this going
BK.

Mike,

I think the restaurants are getting hit for some of the same reasons as retail.

This is the bear story.

Consumption in the US has gone from 65+% of GDP to 80+% of GDP during the 90s.
The personal savings rate is low and consumer credit growth is high.

Both of the above are considered to be partly tied to the extraordinary stock
market rise during that period as people consider their wealth to be equal to
the market value of their portfolios. Therefore they are living far beyond the
growth of their income - which should be the basis for consumption.

This combo has also manifested itself in the huge current account deficit.

The Fed considers this situation unsustainable (no timetable though). I agree.

If you believe an economic slowdown is a must because of the current account
deficit etc... and that the market overall is very overvalued, then when it all
breaks, savings will go up and consumer credit growth with slow down or
decline. (perhaps sharply)

All sectors vulnerable to that scenario are taking a beating.

I personally can not estimate the extent of what we are talking about, when it
will occur, or the exact impact on individual companies. I do sort of agree
about its inevitability though.

My view is that at a minimum, there is probably a strong headwind in store for
retail, restaurants, and other forms of consumption at some point. That view is
further enhanced (I've held it for at least 2 years) by the fact that Alan
Greenspan is whistling the same tune in a more serious and understanding tone.
If he is serious, then I see no reason to throw myself into the fire yet.

There's a number of restaurants and retail companies I am looking at right now.
I am hoping for a better entry point. If I don't get it, it's OK because I'm
finding good values in other sectors that face no possible headwind that I can
find.

Armin,

I've written about my favorite sector a few times. I like property casualty. It
faces no headwinds. It is in the middle of the storm. :-) I think it is a
cyclical storm and we are getting closer to the light. More than a few
companies are already raising prices.

I like auto insurance the best because it's the easiest for me to understand.
(I'm far from expert). The advantage of auto to me is that it isn't long tail
insurance so I think the quality of earnings (or least their trustworthiness)
is better. (I do look at reserve levels.)

When I'm studying a new industry I like to look through the Value Line to see
if there are any companies that I would have bought in the past that
subsequently fell apart on a permanent basis. Then I try to figure out why.

I saw a number of them in longer tail commercial lines that I would never have
seen coming. The auto insurers seemed OK.

Right now my favorite is Mercury General (MCY), but there are others that are
either reasonably priced or cheap. (HMN, PGR, TW etc..). I only own MCY. I
added to the position at 21+. As you probably know I'm a huge fan of BRK at
this price too. I trust Warren and General Re without fully understanding that
business. I think the problems are cyclical.

I also broke my rule recently and took a small position in CATA. It was so
cheap (10 vs book value of close to 12) and I got a very good feeling about the
management from reading the annual report. It's an on the job training position
for me. They are very strict underwriters and overcapitaized so I am reasonably
comfortable while I learn. Combined ratio is usually in the high 80s to low 90s
with occasional sour years.

I like to get them when they are in the storm and not when they are just
starting to discount it.

In the non-insurance area I bought into Velcro Industries (VELCF) last year at
about 12 1/4. I added to that position this year at 11 1/8. The busines is
doing great. They have a $4+ porfolio of investments and I think cash earnings
will come in at about $1.00 this year (non capital gains). Maybe it's a little
vulnerable to a slowdown (headwind), but at this price....

I'm getting a whiff the healthcare sector is turning a bit. WellPoint (one of

Then Manor Care, the best-run nursing home operator, gets takeover activity
news.
Several stocks have made good technical moves.

I just sold my two favorite healthcare stocks - SNH and HRC. Bought back HRC
today as it jumped on large volume. Certainly felt like eating crow, but there
was no other conclusion than to buy into this stock. SNH didn't move hardly at
all. I'd like to get back into that too. Frustrated that I just sold. This is
one of those cases where maybe a depressed sector is turning and it would be a

One thing to consider about HRC is that intranet and internet-based

Mike,

I'm not too familiar with any of those businesses. I noticed the Aetna deal and
I'm hoping that there's a little action like that in the property casualty and
food groups. I believe there's value in both sectors. Maybe I'll take a look at
health care.

I own a little SLE (average price about 17) and some IBC. I think I may have
blown it on IBC. I bought it in the low 20s so I am getting killed. I do think
it is extremely cheap right now but I think I overestimated the value
initially.

Here's the lesson I learned. I've always discounted free cash flow defined as
follows:

Net Income + Depreciation + Amortization - Capital Spending - Some Increase in
Working Capital

Before IBC I never really looked at an industry where virtually all the growth
comes from acquisitions. Companies in the food group (especially IBC) often get
most of their growth that way. So I was discounting the growth but not
subtracting the cost of purchasing new businesses. I am not sure how to resolve
all the issues related to buyouts and mergers as it pertains to free cash.
Sometimes they are for part stock and part cash. Sometimes they are financed
with all debt. I am only certain that without the acquisitions there is almost
no growth for IBC and there are real costs associated with them that lowers
free cash. Maybe I was the last value guy to realize this, but if not I think
others should take a closer look it - especially in consolidating industries.
An acquisition is some form of capital spending. You are just buying the plant
and equipment instead of building it.

I have been looking at BRK recently and like just about everything I see.
However, I have two concerns which I would appreciate your comments on. First,
the company, as you mentioned, is becoming much more of an insurance concern
and much more heavily weighted towards catastrophic insurance. With the concern
about global warming and changing weather patterns, I wonder whether
statistical records from the past provide an adequate data base for calculating
future risk. Second, most other corporations have moved away from the kind of
radical diversification BRK practices. Buffet seems to make it work by
concentrating on capital allocation while granting radical delegation to
carefully chosen executives. As these managers retire, I wonder whether this
conglomerate system can keep working. Further, if shareholder value would be
best realized by spinning these companies out, would corporate dogma prevent it
?

Allen,

TEXP - can't disagree with your or unocals choice. If your base is at 4 you're
going to have a fun year! As for adding to TEXP, one approach is to choose
valuations at which you are comfortable taking profits, and likewise,
valuations which are unusualy low. For example, if Pure trades at >7-8x cash
flow in August, beware of correction in fall and then a setup for tax loss
selling in Nov-Dec. That might bring it back to todays (well, a week ago!)
anomalous valuations. Significant tax loss selling is more likely if the bulk
of the volume in the Spring run-up is at prices above the corrected prices in
late summer.

It's interesting that you state that "financials look only adequate at best".
If you compared TEXP financial to others in its peers, you would find a similar
story; Debt, limited access to capital, but rapidly rising cash flows and
earnings. In other words, a cyclic in the initial leg of a turnaround. By the
time a cyclic appears on typical stock screen, the share price is well on its
ways to its 52 wk. highs.

Foreign currency analysis and EFX.

Question was regarding: "how to interpret and value this, especially as respect
to cash flow analysis and cash return on equity/cash return on capital
calculations."

As a general interest question or as part of a specific valuation methodology
or for those who believe the more you know the better off you are--- a good
discussion item.

I'll take a different viewpoint. For EFX, from what I can understand, the
currency issues were primarily from Brazil operations. Total 1999 operating
income (i.e. Operating Contribution) of Latin America was 22.9M (up from 21.4M
the previous year) out of a total Operating Contribution of 450.5M. There was
also some Brazil component perhaps in another category "Payment Services"
(corp. tot.: 135M vs. 109M prior year). I don't have this broken out in the
1/25 press release.

These currency issues seem minor -- Latin America contributing only 5% of total
operating income. EFX in recent weeks has: hired a new CFO, announced a $260M
acquisition, and made several announcements with partners in e-commerce
thrusts. Success or lack thereof within these areas greatly outweighs the
effects currency swings might have and are much more significant aspects for
anyone considering starting a position in EFX.

Jmo, although I've been wrong many, many times before.

Roy,

You brought up a lot of good issues. Here's my thoughts.

If global warming and other changes in weather patterns become an issue because
of poor insurance statistics, my guess is that the PC business will have a few
rotten years. Then it will adjust. I'm not too worried about the super cat
business though. When people first hear that BRK is insuring against big
catastrophes it can be a bit frightening. But most of the losses are capped at
a level that would easily be absorbed by BRK because it is so over capitalized.
It won't be fun, but I don't think there will be any disasters. Another thing
working in our favor is that BRK usually turns away marginable business and
prefers to write insurance at a profit. It takes greater risks on the
investment side of the business by focusing on equities. So if we are bleeding
on our insurance business everyone else is dying. That can be a long term plus.

Management succession is a problem for every corporation. There's a plus side
to the current situation though. Warren is less critical now that BRK is mostly
a group of operating companies than he was when it was mostly an investment
vehicle. Let's hope Warren will continue to attract and keep the best in the
business on the management side.

I don't think Warren will spin anything off even if it creates value. He's made
comments in the past about not selling certain securities because of the
relationships he develops with people - even if it hurts performance. I would
say that's more of a factor in the 100% owned businesses. Personally I love
value creation and making a few extra bucks, but I have no problem with Warren
putting people he admires and cares about above a few extra dollars in my
pocket. In fact, in the current environment, it's a welcome relief.

(arbitrage opportunity)

Short answer--don't know, folks may want to
just skip this message.

Long answer:

Sorry, don't know. I ascribe to the K.I.S.S.
method of investing--seems like a good solid
old economy play and the contrarian in me
found it while it was dirt cheap, may stay
cheap for a little while, but not willing to
bet that shares can be had much lower.

In my job as a government weather forecaster
(which I intend to quit soon if my stock perform
just a little longer for me...) I have found that
the people with the most elaborate explanations
for why an event will or will not occur, are
generally overthinking the problem--or are simply
full of shit. I adopted KISS to keep sane on the job.

I am not saying that there are not many ways to play
these stocks, and certainly not saying that "arbitrage"
is not a reasonable way of making some money, but I
really could even define the word for you!

I bought BNI because I like the business and the
merger, oil is a bit pricy so profits should again
be up as shipping by truck becomes unreasonable,
and someday Amtrack is going to be taken off the
lines somehow--it is not reasonable for these
fellas to pull over for these passenger trains (and
when a solution is found I look back on my investment
with great satisfaction.) I only am in for "half" of
a position, a couple thousand shares for me.

Also, BNI is the opposite of my biotechs--perfect
way to diversify. I have not read the Yahoo thread,
I'll bet there are a lot of thoughts over there which
are a lot better informed than my own!

I am probably a bit early diversifying--I was 100%
biotech just a few weeks ago. I'll probably be down
to 25% by the top of this run up in biotech, which
should be a couple months away. I'll probably keep
adding these old economy value stocks all along
the way.

Energy Stocks Slump As Oil Prices Continue To Rise - Tulsa World, Oklahoma,
March 3
When oil prices rise, energy stocks usually tag along for the ride. It's one of
the industry's most fundamental and predictable market reactions.

This historic trend, though, has been turned upside down.

For several months, energy stocks have steadily declined, sliding lower as oil
prices get higher. Analysts blame investors' growing interest in technology
stocks for the declining value of energy stocks.

"Investors are attracted to growth stocks, particularly high-technology growth
stocks," said Ed Maran, a senior oil analyst for A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in
St. Louis. "Individual investors are taking their money and either buying
technology stocks or putting their money into funds that invest in technology
stocks."

Such a shift in investment, however, may not be wise, Maran said, because
earnings for oil companies such as Bartlesville-based Phillips Petroleum Co.
are expected to break new records in 2000.

"Most of them will be up 50 percent or more," he said. "Their outlook has never
been better."

Maran, who rates Phillips stock a "buy," said he expects the company's stock
price to reach $60 a share within 12 to 18 months. The stock closed Wednesday
at $38.68.

Phillips has combined some of its secondary business units with those of other
companies to focus more on the production of oil and gas.

Still, in recent months, Phillips shares have fallen along with other oil
stocks at a steady rate.

Since the beginning of the year, Phillips stock has dropped more than 14
percent. Other oil stocks, including Texaco Inc., Chevron Corp., BP Amoco and
Conoco Inc., have declined between 8 percent and 19 percent.

PG Small initial position - After looking at really beaten down 'bargains'

I've been used to looking at. But it's on my list of great companies I want to
get if they fall in reasonable range. That said, if it drops out of the support
zone [See 97 on longer term chart] I'm probably gonna throw it back and wait
for lower entry.
Based on adjusted #'s 3.05 this year growing at 15% and 20 multiple in 5 years,
this returns 15% - Like I say no bargain, but I think a really great company

Like Wayne and Jim, I've felt tinges of the insanity this market's dissociative
characteristics can bring to bear on the typical value investor. Absolutely
outrageous comparisons. Infuriating. And unlike Wayne and Jim, I've been plain
stupid with some of my trading. The insanity has driven me from mumblings to my
wife in the car and in bed to actual point-and-click trades that I would never
have done had I had a brain.

But then, PG is now only becoming fairly priced. Same really goes for PEP. I
mean, if we are expecting 1970's Washington Post-type or 1986 Coke-type Buffett
bargains, these things need to be halved again. The S&P Index buying drove many
of these "buy what you know" stocks way too high, and it will the S&P Index
selling that will drive them way too low. I think some patience is still in
order. I'm not buying them yet. Same goes for the drugs - another big S&P 500
component that is only now getting fairly priced after 50% haircuts.

Hey, if we get thousands of swings and thousands of "take-backs" then so-called
"start-up positions" in some of these might be warranted. But these aren't the
home run balls. These are not chest-high 80 mph fastballs.

Jim, Jackpot, and Mario:

Congratuations on Jackpot. It was a good value play at $8.00 all right. The
risk being that the investment banker guy running it would do something not so
great with the $8 cash. And Jackpot's business - servicing slots in Nevada -
maybe was worth $2 a share more. It wasn't a very profitable business though.

At $12 -13/share (up from $8) maybe there was some clue that something might be
happening. A technical chart breakout perhaps - stock hadn't traded so high for
quite some time. And Mario Gabelli in with a big position. Even adding to it if
I recall correctly (not sure).

To me, here's a case where the mutual fund manager has it all over the little
guy. There is NO reason (imho) that anyone reading the public documents or
studying the crummy business would take a large position in this stock at $10
or more. Other than the $8/sh in cash, there's really (again imo)no hidden
value to pull out of this business. There was no reason for a fund manager to
hold on to the stock when it got over $13 - at least based on publicly
available information. The value was not there. MARIO GABELLI HAD TO HAVE
KNOWLEDGE THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE GENERAL MARKET. Namely, that J's
management was preparing to totally transform the company in a very positive
way - by becoming an incubator and populating the company with high powered
internet execs and entrepreneurs. As they say in bridge, a peek is worth 100
finesses.

Super Mario wins again! The lesson maybe is to keep following Mario - he knows
exactly what he is doing. And now that the company won't have earnings, but
instead will have potential spin offs, plus power players plus Mario to tout
it, the stock could easily (imo) go to 40 from today's 21.

Mike,

I don't know the BOA story.

I think a number of the banks are looking reasonable. I just took an opening
position in STI. They have a huge stake in KO that's worth about $7 per share
that doesn't contribute to EPS very much. It looks like they are overreserved
too. ROE minus the KO contribution to book value is very high. Management is
considered to be conservative.

MTB and WFC are two interesting ones also. These two are tricky because there
are large amortization charges related to mergers. Both usually disclose "cash
earnings" in their releases.

I think one negative is that this is the peak of the economic cycle so earnings
and ROE may be above normalized levels. I wouldn't go out on a limb. A positive
is that the consolidations may continue.

I've tossed the thought of NKE around a bit, as well.
One of my best friends was a rep for the Swoosh for about 10 years, still has
good contacts with the company, works in the sporting goods industry, and has a
chunk of NKE stock in a 401K (which I've constantly suggested to him to peel
off a bit, as that is his biggest holding, by far).
He has told me that, per his contacts, things are still weak, and will be for
another Q or 2. This is not insider info, believe me, rather an interpretation
of futures orders, etc.
That said, WS often overreacts, and NKE is still a big time brand name,
experiencing a temporary (?) setback. Trading at a multi year low. Don't really
understand the business that well, so I passed - bought WMT (a high PE stock
for me) instead.
I mentioned EK here a while back. Still is interesting, even though the "axe"
(Alex Henderson at Pru) said Wednesday (hence yesterday's weakness) that sales
trends in the core photo biz are flat during this seasonally slow period. Has a
modest PE, and has recently shown decent, if not spectacular, growth. Trading

The old economy is still alive and well at PACCAR in Seattle (PCAR). The
company makes trucks. Peterbilt - check out your rear view mirror when you're
driving and look for Peterbilts. Very cyclical, right, and earnings are at a
peak. The stock is a buy. It has held a $40 support level despite the fact that
the truck backlog has gone from bad to worse news, and despite the fact that
the entire industrial sector has collapsed on the stock market. By Mike Burry
logic, you buy this at 41 and put in a stop loss at 38 or 39. So you've got 6%
downside. Now lets look at the upside.

Truck orders have been falling for a year now and the backlog is half what it
was at the peak. That's my contrarian buy signal for Paccar if the valuation is
right.

$3.2 billion market cap with 700 million of that in net cash. So call it $2.5
billion for the enterprise. The company earned $500 million in free cash flow
in the last nine months. 2000 earnings will decline. Well, duh.

I estimate they earn about 16% ROE over a cycle unleveraged - and its probably
even more than that if you completely deleverage them - i.e. back out the cash
and restate the equity based on that. Great company in a lousy industry. Don't
get scared off by the industry until you look at the balance sheet and
understand that this company has not lost money in 50 years. I visited them in
1998 - probably the most frugal manufacturing operation I ever saw firsthand
with the possible exception of Clayton Homes. If you know anybody who knows
trucks ask them what the best truck is and they will probably say Peterbilt -
that brand is like BMW in the truck business, where resale value is half the
game. The company is controlled by a family and they run it like owners - i.e.
they don't care what the stock price is today but they sure care what it is ten
years from now. But they recently did start buying back a few shares, which was
a big step for PACCAR. The dividend is huge - don't forget to add the special
year end dividend based on earnings - screens always have the dividend yield on
Paccar wrong.

If anybody can find a hole in this I'd appreciate it. What I didn't mention
above is the finance sub, which is probably where we should be doing our
digging.

Added to positions in Seagate (SEG) and Trinity (TRN). I've been playing catch
the falling knife with TRN since I first posted on it- from 28 on down to
today's 20.

Added more to Del Webb (WBB) as it's hit new lows.

Added to my long term holding in TFH. A management buyout went totally awry,
and I'm taking big hurt here. Buying even more @ 1 1/2 -- gives me a perpetual
call. I've done this before elsewhere -- with terrible results. This time may
be different, but I've got no justifiable reason it might be.

Building back my position in RAD again. A special situation I've posted on
before. (Stock subsequently rose and I exited most of my small position.
Stock's now backed down.) Essentially, there's the new investing firm and new
management that might turn this company around. .... maybe.

Added to Genuine Parts (GPC) as it hit new lows.

Started and added to DNB. Special situation: spin off of Moody's. Tremendously
powerful franchise. For example, they just rated Mexico. THAT has an impact on
Mexican economy. Warren Buffett's increased his DNB position too.

Selling off Cross Pens (ATX) at a loss. Gave it a couple of years to work out,
but now I give up. Similar with RDO. (With RDO it was the Buffett example of
the excellent manger who tries to run a mediocre business and how the latter
triumphs.) I posted on both these stocks here --- and as a reminder-- I AM
wrong many, many times.

Took small amounts off the table on SUNW, LSI, GEMS, FLM and SEMI, more off on
ELAM. LSI, GEMS, FLM and ELAMF (ELAM) were discussed as possible value stocks
several years back. SEMI was mentioned here last year couple of times by

Here's a link to an interview with value investors M. Whitman and R. Rodriguez.
I believe these guys' performance is not so hot recently (-g-). I have some of
the same stocks they do, and I know they are hurting on some of these. I bought
at same or lower prices than these guys did and these particular stocks have
since gone down a terrific amount. That would be, for example, Conseco
(CNC,which I am considering adding to), Consolidated Stores (CNS) and First Am
Financial (FAF). What I like is that these two still have faith in their picks,
and persistence to hold for many, many years. (I know for example, that
Rodriguez has held CNS when they bought out the old Pic-and-Save chain-- at
least a 7 year holding for him I believe. And Mr. Whitman's been wrong on FAF
for more than two years now.) Of course, I see they've got some winners too -
-g-I mentioned MIKE (Michael's Stores) here about a year or so ago at 17 and I
sold couple weeks ago at 28-- stock's now 37. When that happens I can't tell if
I'm a winner or a loser -g-. Maybe I'm both.

Rodriguez holds Horace Mann (HMN) which has some interest for some on the
thread. I've got CP Clare (CPCL, which I've posted on, and that I still believe
is a cheap, cash-rich tech stock), and also I am a long term holder (sufferer)
of Catellus (CDX).

need to do some more thinking on why
I feel I need to abandon a hot sector
(biotech) when I know why I own each
of my companies--but was merely buying
value because they are "cheap".

With regards to JCP I wrote "any chance you
could see sombody like a Wal Mart buy or
merge with JCP". I thought it was interesting
that a blurb in the April issue of Worth, p66,
said that Penny's catalog business is losing
share to discount stores like Wal Mart which
"have greatly improved the quality..."

Along with WM, BNI, and BA, Penny's is on my
list to think about some more.

I have a question for the thread: Up til now
Greenspan and his threat of rate hikes has
punished "old economy", value stocks getting
cheaper all the time...but he has not taken the
steam out of high tech "new economy". Should I
feel compelled to move from a winning sector to
losing sectors merely because I have done well?

I would hate to 'lock in gains', and then lose
30% off the top if the cheap stocks keep getting
cheaper. Plus it would be particularly annoying
if each of my biotech speculations turned out to
be correct.

Recently my father has been pointing out all these
value stocks which are down, and I've encouraged him,
my value list is getting longer by the day. So keeping
an open mind...and my biotech were off seven percent
on Friday, so that gives me pause.

Thread,

Hi guys. I've been away from the thread but still tracking some of the stocks
that were brought up. Has anybody looked at BEBE recently? Share price has
plummetted with the sector but balance sheet and SSS still appear strong. I am
holding a position at a small loss and was considering adding more but I
thought I would put it to the thread to see if anybody was still following it.
Unless people have decided that retail was dead for good? <g>

Terrapin - Welcome back - BEBE - looked at it after seeing your post. Looks
real attractive in rear view mirror - the financials, earnings, growth would
seem to justify way better share price. Problem is that growth has stalled
based on same store sales from 20 - 30% last year to recently announced
negative for March. Margins are also under pressue. Three top execs have
departed [Marketning, merchendising, & today - retail operations] - a strain on
a small co & a possible sign of deepening problems. Shorts clearly expect
continued problems: 85% of small float [10% of cap] is shorted. I respect the
deeper analysis work often done by shorts, but good news - if there ever is
any, could spark a rally/squeeze due to thin float. I've seen some discussion
of a secondary, but could find no confirmation in the SEC docs.
BEBE has a very narrow focus, young thin women, so a shift in fashion
preferences, could be ugly. Maybe that's why many of their managers are jumping
ship.
Even if I had a really good feel for ladies fashion, I'd probably be on the
sidelines due to the management exodus. As it is, I have no feel for fashion
whatsoever, and am thus rather reluctant to bet on something with key metrics
on the decline despite very attractive valuation based on recent history.

Since oil-producing basins are maturing rapidly, companies have to drill more
wells this year than last year just to keep production flat.

On average, yes. But there are many counter-examples, and many companies who
have sucessfuly discovered new basins. OIL comes to mind. When I look for E&P's
to hold, exploration upside is important - if all they are doing is "drilling
more wells.. keeping production flat", then they don't deserve a second look.

Meyer pointed to Burlington Resources' move away from shallow water drilling
and its substantial maintenance costs in the Gulf of Mexico as evidence of one
"major portfolio shift." Apache, on the other hand, remains committed to
growth, he said.

But which strategy has proved better for shareholders in the initial phase of
this most recent cycle? BR's or APA's?
If ng was hovering around 2, and oil around 18, the concept of profitable
growth vs. pure volume growth might have merit. But where prices stand now, and
where I think ng will continue to be, there is no reason to limit production
volume.

Wooing investors away from high-flying technology stocks into a sector that's
slowing its growth won't be easy, said Meyer, adding that demand for E&P grows
at 2 percent a year "at best." 

This must be an average number.

Making the following changes in past few days:

Buying:
Alberto-Culver (ACV). I considered also Dial (DL), but I like that ACV said
it's on track to meet earnings estimates. Dial is a bigger, more diversified
company (positives, imo); down for now - but could be a long-term winner. ACV
has a good multi-year performance record.

Buying:
Building Materials Holding Corp. (BMHC). Nice (imo) small cap. In somewhat same
business, CAB is being taken private; doing a comparable, the private market
value of BMHC would be much higher than its current price. (I'm not
implying/anticipating a takeout will occur.)
BMHC numbers look good to me:
http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=bmhc

Buying:
Counsel Corp. (CXSN). Another tech/internet incubator company. And once again,
I'm doing a sum-of-parts-is-worth-more-than-the current-price. As some of its
holdings go public - value and price of CXSN may increase - assuming ipo market
for its companies remains strong.

Selling:
Taking some KEM (discussed in 1997/98(?) off the table on good earnings
announcement and analyst upgrades.

OT,I thought people might like to see that the SEC wants some input on this:

Selective Disclosure and Insider Trading Rule Proposals

... The Commission is proposing a new Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure), which
does not treat selective disclosure under insider
trading laws, but rather creates requirements for fair disclosure practices by
companies.

Proposed Regulation FD would require that:

(1) whenever an issuer intentionally discloses material information, it do so
through public disclosure, not through selective
disclosure; and
(2) whenever an issuer learns that it has made a on-intentional material
selective disclosure, the issuer make prompt public
disclosure of that information.

Under the proposal, an issuer could make the required public disclosure through
one of several methods: (1) filing the information
with the Commission; (2) issuing a press release; or (3) providing public
access (for example, by phone access or webcast) to the
conference call or meeting..

I have checked BEBE at the end of last year. The price was already very
attracting, and the bad news was not out yet. I elected to buy SBUX instead
(it's been a better choice so far...). My reasoning was the same as yours:
BEBE's focus is very narrow, probably too narrow. I also came to the conclusion
that the popularity of the stores was dangerously linked to their sponsorship
of TV series like Alie McBeal. Now, I don't have anything against Alie (in
fact, I like the show), it's just that I feared a price drop if the serie
became less popular or - worst still - if Alie decided to gain a few pounds and
shop at Sears instead of BEBE. ;-)

Paul, you mentioned two of my favorite value stocks in the same post a few
months back (they're both now even cheaper if you could imagine):

#1 - Allstate (ALL) - which will have bought back every last share of stock in
7 years at the current rate; was $52/sh; makes about $3 bill/yr; and is about
to get in to the internet in a big way (now at $21/sh)

#2 - ESG Re (ESREF) - which is wrapping up a buyback; book value stands at
$15.26; pays $.32/yr dividend; its 12/97 ipo was 9 mill shares @ $20 led by
Deutsche Bank, DLJ, & others; 13 mill shares o/s; and stock hit a high of
around $30 back in '98 (now at $4/sh)

Blankmind, I am learning to hate the insurance business and the stocks thereof
-g-

Allstate (ALL), imo represents an okay buy at this point for a value investor.
Sorry I did not buy more in high teens.

Somebody is very, very, wrong about ESG Re (ESREF). So far it's me. But I have
a lot of company. There is a bunch of insider buying all the way down on this
stock. Well, with a great price/book, maybe 2x cash, no LTD, they do have some
financial reserve. If they could only now make some money. How they might do
this I don't know. Still, I may add to my position just on what I perceive as
cheap price to its assets.

I'm believing now it's going to be about appropriate business models. We've
read on the Buffett thread how GEICO
will increase its marketing by $1B. Two companies which might have models that
could work to help them fend off this onslaught are ALL and CGI (which I've
posted on before). With Allstate, you might not (won't?) get the cheapest auto
rates, but you will be easily and conveniently able to keep all your insurance
requirements with them. ALL has the money to spend to set up an e-business.
They will spend if they have to and it will cause them turmoil and bucks. It's
in the stock price now, I hope. With CGI, the dominant auto insurer in
Massachusetts, you get the inertia of people comfortable with CGI. Plus CGI's
marketing ploy is to groups - if x number of your members sign up with us,
we'll give you all a very good price break.

I've been selling some CGI - the only insurance co. I have whose stock price is
above my cost - and I will likely start a position in UNUM (UNM)- another
troubled carrier, but the dominant player in disability ins.

fwiw,
Paul S.

<<With Allstate, you might not (won't?) get the cheapest auto rates, but you

I priced my Allstate auto policy against Geico, and even with the 8%
shareholder discount Geico was not even close. I was surprised to say the
least. State Farm, on the other hand, was 10% below Geico, which tells you why
this is a bad business unless you are the low cost producer.

That said, I too like Allstate at anywhere close to 20. But there are so many
similar ideas out there which I understand better than insurance. And owning
Berkshire and Ambac, I really don't need more insurance stocks. (A buy
rationale, not necessarily mine, for both Berkshire and Ambac was in Barrons
today).

that use Allstate & refuse to swtich.

- Not sure if I posted this or not, but look at the buyback going on at
Allstate; and please let me know if any other insurers are on track to buy all
their stock back in 7 years:

12/31/95: 996 mill shs o/s
12/31/96: 884 mill shs o/s
12/31/97: 850 mill shs o/s
12/31/98: 818 mill shs o/s
12/31/99: around 790 mill shs o/s

combined with a $20 stock price are going on

blankmind (TRH, GMT): only other strong insurance buyback I see now as I look
through my notes-- TRH. Situation is much different though. With TRH, you have
Greenberg as TRH Chairman who has his AIG keep buying, buying, buying shares of
TRH. The plus is that your downside with TRH is limited (as long as AIG keeps
buying). (Too bad I wasn't nimble/astute enough to add when TRH was lower in
past few weeks.) Negative is that if Greenberg ever does actually mount a
takeover (and since he'll already own the majority of TRH, maybe he won't want
to), it won't be for much money.

I face that same possibility with GATX (GMT) & Mr. Buffett. I am possibly one
of the few who look upon Mr. Buffett's large 14% share investment there as a
danger to the shareholders' pocketbook. Because with 14% I'm convinced
Mr.Buffett could/would/might cosider a buyout of the whole company. And Buffett
being Buffett, it could happen and for what HE considers a fair price.
Generosity not being his strong suit - say $42.50/sh up from $28-30 where it
was trading before his first large holding was announced. Now that would be
terrific (imo) for people following Mr. Buffett into that stock in the past few
weeks. But for long term holders like me who've been building up holdings over
the past few years, I(we) would not realize the value of the stock as I see it
or be compensated enough @$40 or $45 for years of holding. (The stock's
essentially gone nowhere in past few years although its business value has
increased.) A similar situation happened to long term holders of Dairy Queen, I
believe. Mr. Buffett ooched them out of the really good earnings and stock
gains we might have seen as DAIQY came out with new popular products and
greatly increased expansion of units.

BARR sure looks good to me at these prices.

I lost some money on this one a few years ago but just stepped back into it. BV
& cash per share are wonderful. I figue $6.60 BV and $6.26 working cap per
share. No debt, no liabilities at all essentially. No BS on the balance sheet.
Profitable. Looking for growth via new applications of existing technology --
i.e. they do trace detection for explosives and are moving to biological.
Orders coming in.

I see the downside to be limited at these < $7 level and the upside to be
fairly substantial long term.

PS - my other "barr" is worth a peek also.
