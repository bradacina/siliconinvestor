I'm feeling your pain on FR, now underwater after years of holding. Of course,
I'm feeling a lot of pain, almost across the board. So much for the bailout
bounce.
I think the market is saying that now the heavy lifting begins. The rescue
package is not the be all and end all.

I was able to grab some ULTR at the low. Stock down another 10% trading at an
all time low. The market seems to be selling the company along with all the
other "bulk" shipping companies. 2/3 of the company revenues come from domestic
services not specific to the bulk shipping industry. I am betting that their
domestic revenues continue to grow. Hopefully they have long enough hedges in
place in their bulk shipping division to weather the current downturn.

Finally, the company stated yesterday they have $43.5 million left in their
stock repurchase program which they extended to December 2008. This should help
support the current price level.

=========================================================

This is a tough market with new bargains showing up every day. I hope the value
investors pick through the bargains carefully and do not use margin. I believe
there will be at least 6-8 months to buy your favorite "value" picks, so no
need to rush to the cashier. Cash is King in this environment!

I feel the pain. FR was my largest REIT holding after adding to it a month ago.
I bought a bunch more today at 18.8 near the close. With their press release I
think the dividend is covered both this year and next year. At $20 the yield is
14%.

But I bought quite a few things over the past few days that looked good at the
time... COS, SU, AFC, other REITs...

COS (with it's 13% dividend), and SU are easy stocks to own. They will sell all
the oil they can produce no matter when the economy does. The only question is
the price.

My guess is FFH, a current holding of his, although if I am correct Pabrai is
being a bit disingenous. The company appears to have lots of cash and
investments, but as insurance company some of that has to flow back to policy
holders such that the stock trading is above book value. No stock would truly
be trading that cheap without a lot of hair.

This company made a great spec bet against the economy, going short massive
amounts of credit default swaps massive and buying them back. It is not clear
to me that their insurance operations are all that great.

Paul, I can't blame you with STT. scary volatility. Bought. some again after
selling in the high 50's at 52$ and 46$ this stock goes on "hellrides" almost
every other day now without obvious reason.

Business, IMO is intact. 2/3 if fee income - the dull business of custody and
investment services which is very profitable and has been for many many years -
and secondary their are a bank. there are no big issues in this business either
but (a big one) they do manage a 28B$ SIV that appears to be a source of
problems. They say they do not own it, but who knows. This thing is in the hole
by about 1.6B$ (per 6/30/08) but isn't probably more by now. They provide some
support (a few 100M$ in commercial paper financing) and help to run it. Legally
they are probably not the owner but who knows about the contractual terms?

Luckily they raised 2.5B$ in June issuing shares at 70$, which as they claim is
enough to consolidate the SIV and still be well capitalized.

http://library.corporate-ir.net/library/78/782/78261/items/300267/ABCPSlides_Q2
8.pdf

So I say they should survive - they have the capital to do so and even more
importantly they have a profitable business that does not need a lot of capital
to run and is very profitable. But who knows, their could be a run on the back
or the SIV is far worse than expected and we get the FED's coming in and taking
this bank over too. I think there is a chance that this could happen but it's
less than 10%, IMO.

In my opinion almost any bank could implode in the US except USB and WFC; even
JPM and BAC. Here is my list of risk factors:

C: , many bad loans and weak earnings and risk of worldwide recession which
traditionally has hit banks with international business very hard.

JPM , seems to have a bulletproof west lately but they also have a huge credit
card business and a ton of derivatives on their book. In fact the derivatives
on their book far exceed tangible equity. Are they a risk? I don't know but I
do not understand why they keep so many on their balance sheet.

BAC: thin tangible equity blanket and MER takeover = risk

Compared to that STT looks like a decent bet playing the Russian roulette game
with financials.

HWD. Yes, I've followed it. So many value buys out there now, it's hard to
focus on reading the links explaining why HWD is one too and/or should be
considered.

I see it this way: I'll allow that HWD is a value buy, maybe an exceptional
value play. It's in the retail jewelry sector essentially, a very discretionary
and dangerous area now.

Question 1: No matter how cheap any stock is in this sector, is now the time to
buy a stock in this sector? (Assuming we're talking about making a value buy,
not a quick trading buy/sell).

Question 1b: There are so many stocks that are so cheap relative to their
fundamentals, why HWD now? Alternatively, all stocks seem to be falling, why
buy any stock at this time?

Question 2: If we look at the retail jewelry sector, are there any equivalent
or better bets to be made than HWD? My opinion here is I don't know. However,
my money (with a few shares) is on http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TIF . TIF has
the cachet, the history. I expect TIF to be a survivor. In normal times - if
they ever return - TIF will once again sell at a p/e of 20, as it has in past.
Analysts predict Jan '10 p/e now of 10. However, I may yet see p/e 20: If
earnings fall off the cliff and stock price continues to drop, the 10 p/e
estimate will shoot right up.
Very short term (six months), I don't see the jewelry stocks performing as well
as other areas - if I can even surmise any areas will move up. I failed to buy
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SIG , so I could be wrong still or again on the
jewlery biz. For myself, I'm considering getting out of TIF and redeploying
funds elsewhere. Too scared to consider entering HWD even at current price.
(Which might mean it's a very good entry point -g-)

The question is how is going GE to perform going forward? I do not think they
are going to outperform the many good industrial names that are on sale now too
(UTX, RYCEY, FWLT, TYC, TEL and many others...) and that do not have to deal
with the financial baggage.

If split ever happens than I expect the GE financial Spinco to be dumped by
investors. the financial part will earn something like 1.2-1.3$/share and is
probably worth 15$. I do not think that GE Financial Spinco will trade for 10x
earnings so it seems like the spinoff will not create much value, at least not
initially. I hope I am wrong, i still hold 1/2 of my initial position but I am

The more I read the more paranoid I get.
I have now read that there was $5 billion in wm bank that belonged to the
holding company at the time the regulators seized the bank. The debt holders
are wondering why the funds werent used to support the banks operations.

I also wonder whether its legal for JPM to be examining the books of wm under
the guise of making a legitamate offer for the company, while they have been
secretly discussing with the regulators taking over the bank after seizure.

Then today I read this:

From Times Online:

JP Morgan has been accused by its Wall Street rivals of dealing the final
hammer blow that forced Lehman Brothers into collapse in a sensational claim
that threatens to spark a colossal legal battle.

The giant American bank is alleged to have frozen $17 billion (&#163;9.6
billion) of cash and securities belonging to Lehman on the Friday night before
its failure.

According to Lehman’s biggest creditors, this was what precipitated the
liquidity crisis that embroiled the firm, forcing it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection on the morning of Monday, September 15....

The funding lines provided to Lehman to finance its everyday operations amount
to $188 billion, according to court filings.

The creditors are now demanding that JP Morgan open up its books to the
bankruptcy court to allow the transactions to be assessed.

“The creditors’ committee understands that LBHI [Lehman Brothers Holding Inc]
had at least $17 billion in excess assets which were held at JPMC [JP Morgan
Chase] on the Friday going into the weekend before its bankruptcy filing,” the
documents said.

“The creditors’ committee further understands that, on September 12, 2008, JPMC
refused to allow LBHI access to its excess assets and instead ‘froze’ LBHI’s
account. In freezing LBHI’s assets, JPMC was purportedly holding all of LBHI’s
assets as a potential offset against any claims JPMC may have had against
LBHI.”

I'm no securities lawyer, but if that is indeed what happened, that is
unconscionable. A clearing bank is supposed to act in a custodial capacity.
Freezing the assets is tantamount to seizing the assets. It's self-dealing,
pure and simple.
More from Bloomberg:

JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by deposits, financed Lehman's brokerage
operations with daily advances, while money market funds and other short-term
lenders provided overnight loans, according to bankruptcy court documents. When
JPMorgan shut Lehman off from funds, Lehman ``suffered an immediate liquidity
crisis that could have been averted by any number of events, none of which
transpired,' according to the filing....

Lehman seemed to have enough liquidity to meet its obligations on Sept. 12, the
Friday before its bankruptcy filing, creditors said, referring to the cash and
collateral at JPMorgan. In addition, the bank held ``highly liquid' securities
bought with secured financing amounting to $188 billion from banks and other
lenders, they said.

The ``freezing' of Lehman's account meant it no longer had funds to support its
operations, they said.

Explaining Lehman's collapse to the judge after the bankruptcy filing, company
executives and lawyers said the $188 billion pool of loans mostly financed the
bank's least liquid assets, subprime mortgages and structured financial
instruments.

``Secured financing fell out of reach' because of the devaluation of assets
securing the loans, forcing Lehman to deplete its cash to continue trading,
said lawyer Shai Waisman of Weil Gotshal & Manges in a Sept. 16 court hearing.
``This began the stranglehold on Lehman,' Waisman said.

JPMorgan is Lehman's largest secured creditor, with an estimated claim of $23
billion, according to a Sept. 25 court filing. Unsecured creditors have claims
on Lehman that might be worth 15 cents on the dollar or less, according to
analysts including Peter Plaut of Imperial Capital LLC.

After Lehman's filing, JPMorgan advanced the company $87 billion on Sept.15 and
$51 billion the next day to pay short- term lenders and settle trades,
according to court documents.

This Bloomberg story fails to note that at least $87 billion of those advances
were repaid by the Fed. From an earlier Bloomberg report:

Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the securities firm that filed the biggest
bankruptcy in history yesterday, was advanced $138 billion this week by
JPMorgan Chase & Co. to settle Lehman trades and keep financial markets stable,
according to a court filing.

One advance of $87 billion was made on Sept. 15 after the pre-dawn filing, and
another of $51 billion was made the following day, according to a bankruptcy
court documents posted today. Both were made to settle securities transactions
with customers of Lehman and its clearance parties, the filings said.

The advances were necessary ``to avoid a disruption of the financial markets,'
Lehman said in the filing.

The first advance was repaid by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Lehman
said. The bank didn't say if the second amount was repaid. Both advances were
``guaranteed by Lehman' through collateral of the firm's holding company, the
filing said. The advances were made at the request of Lehman and the Federal
Reserve, according to the filing.

Madharry wonders whether the lehman disaster, with JPM being the largest
unsecured creditor, and shortly thereafter wm assets falling into jpm's lap
under the auspices of the regulators as more than $40 billion of shareholder
equity, preferred and debt gets wiped out is more than a coincidence.

Looks like the bailout bill had to be passed in one form or another, but I
wonder what sort of immunity provisions are buried in it. Was anyone minding
the store?

At this point I sold as their business became less transparent to me. Then they

After listening to the GE CC last week, I don't think that the financial assets
should be spun off. If you haven't listened to it, then you will most likely
find it worthwhile.

http://www.ge.com/investors/events/event_id09252008.html

Of particular interest is the Q&A and the answer to the ML analyst who asked if
they are going to have to tap their bank lines. The answer to that question was
straight forward.

GE has 15 billion in cash and 20 billion in marketable securities.

The have 120 billion in committed collections that mature in the next 12
months.

They have no exposures to the write offs from the banks.

They still will earn 2 billion on the financial side in the third quarter.

They don't anticipate tapping any bank lines. (Of course, they did raise
capital.)

Their problems are having to mark to market 350 to 500 million in securities
and future anticipated problems with their private label credit cards.

So the financial division, on a relative basis, is outperforming the sector. Of
course, the Oct. 10 earnings release will tell more.

But I understand your reasoning. I am not familiar enough to comment on the
companies you mentioned.

But this excerpt from Barrons "Streetwise" column sums up my previous posted
reasoning on GE.

"One man who seems uncommonly immune to negative reinforcement is, of course,
Warren Buffett, who never hesitates to buy things that look cheap and sure
doesn't sell things because they go down in price.

His recent injections of capital into Goldman Sachs (ticker: GS) and General
Electric (GE) -- and the just-released doorstop of a biography of him -- are
amply explored elsewhere in this issue (see Buffet's Great; This Book Isn't).
What's striking from a market-sentiment perspective, however, is the general
skepticism that has greeted the same kind of "Buffett-is-buying" news that used
to spur investor euphoria.

Mike O'Rourke, strategist with institutional broker BTIG, says, "For 20 years,
market participants clamored to follow Buffett into any transaction, and now
that he is finally putting money to work, the common response is that companies
are giving him too much."

The 10%-yielding preferred shares and rights to buy more stock on attractive
terms were commonly characterized as "sweetheart" deals that conveyed scant
endorsement of the companies themselves -- as in the Breakingviews.com feature
in the New York Times headlined, "Buffett's Moves Aren't Stock Tips." Bloggers
chimed in with foreboding, if accurate, reminders that Mr. J.P. Morgan Jr., the
Buffettesque figure of his day, bought big stocks including GE in the panic of
1929 -- before the crash.

Sure, paying 10% on Buffett's billions can't tickle the CFOs of Goldman and GE,
but who in this world thinks Buffett would even roll out of bed for a mere 10%
return from just any company, even with a sweet equity kicker? And with the
Vanguard GNMA mutual fund -- and GE common shares -- yielding more than 5% now,
how much less would you figure Buffett would open his checkbook for? Oh, and
with the decline in GE's stock below the $22.25 strike price of Buffett's
warrants, you and I now share his "right" to buy it there and collect that 5%
yield.

Can the market get to a position where it is too low to sell? The difference I
see this time vs the last panic down in October 1987 is there are very few
companies buying back their own stock.

I have set aside a lot a cash (now at 40% vs 10% at the start of the year) with
the strategy to sit it out. I am tempted to nibble at some real values but the
market at this point seems to be trading on fear. It also appears that margin
calls are amplifying this downward move which should continue with each daily
spike down. Why buy today when you can buy lower tomorrow?

Until we start to hear some very large company stock buy backs, I plan to
remain on the sidelines (even with all of these value opportunities).

I wonder how much selling will occur on any dead cat bounce. I think the latest
pundants are expecting the DOW to bottom near 8500 which is about another 12%
lower.

Hope those GNMA funds continue to pay their monthly dividends.

CAPITULATION
Definition

The sale of a security at a loss for the specific purpose of moving funds from
the sale into a less risky investment. Capitulation refers to investors "giving
up" on a particular security. Value investors often review such sales of
securities, since the value of the underlying security could be inherently
higher than what the share price currently is. Technical traders might view the
low price as a potential bottom of a cycle.

This content can be found on the following page:
http://www.investorwords.com/cgi-bin/getword.cgi?id=6438&term=capitulation

I'll take more ULTR today.

It would actually be helpful if analysts or the companies would come out with
adverse news on some of the stocks I am holding. For example, with ULTR, if I
were to be made aware that something was amiss with the company as regards its
business or its business prospects, then I could reasonably weigh either
holding-on or selling. As it is now, I seem to be just following the stock

Didn't Buffet load up on physical gold sometime back?

How about gold as a value play? Wouldn't turning fiat dollars into something
with real worth, be the ultimate value play?

Consider this: Around the turn of the last century, a dollar was worth just shy
of an ounce of gold. By 1934 a dollar was worth 1/20th an ounce of gold. Today
a dollar is worth 1/860th an ounce of gold. If that trend continues, in another
century, an ounce of gold will be worth over $700,000.

Of course if you told someone in 1908 that in one hundred years an ounce of
gold would cost a thousand dollars, they would have told you you were crazy.

The 7% plus in muni's is just the yield while you wait for price recovery. I

From:Paul Senior
I looked at two of those, NMO & NPT, and both have two aspects that I don't
like and that would keep me from having major commitments to either of them or
to muni CEF's in general, unless I understood the situations better.

The first is the management fee which is over 1% on the NAV.

I have a CEF. I keep looking at the yield and it's good. I keep forgetting to
take into account the management fee in which they quietly and conveniently
remove over 1% of the nav. So for example,with something like your muni NPT -
since with it, like most other CEF's, its nav is higher the market value per
share - in effect, imo, the skimming off of market value is more than 1.24%.

Secondly they (my fund and NMO and NPT) use leverage. 36% for NPT. Which - if
one goes into muni CEF's assuming lots of safety - professional management,
diversity of holdings, history of very few muni's defaulting - adds a layer of
concern rather than assurance - imo.

With leverage, there now becomes another layer of complexity that maybe - in
this kind of credit freeze-up environment - needs to be considered. For
example, how is that leverage funded? Can it even be discerned easily from the
fund? For me, I'm not happy to have received a note from my preferred-stock CEF
saying that my fund is leveraged by-the-way by using auction-rate preferred
securities, but not to worry, they're working the situation "although
significant challenges remain".

Perhaps these muni-CEFs are all well and good, and I am needlessly issuing a
cautionary or alarming note. One buys what one will. For me, given my
unsatisfactory foray into preferred CEFs, I'd never put a significant chunk of
my money into a CEF subsector (muni-CEFs) unless I understood it carefully. To
me, it often seems that CEF fund management's objectives and the investor's are
different.

Paul, good points.

There is always risk in the market, nowadays even Money Market funds may have
some risk depending on the institution (see Reserve Funds). The issue is
whether some of the risks have been baked into the stock or CEF. I hold
individual CA muni bonds too but not enough to become fully diversified so I am
opting for muni funds in lieu of Money Market funds for a portion of my cash
holdings. I think muni's are a way to go because of the prospects of higher tax
rates for the next administration. I am tired of paying taxes for holding cash.
We'll see if this is a good strategy. Will know in the fullness of time.

RE: "And yet isn't that only 7 % per year minus whatever the holding costs

It would be 70% the way you're figuring it, although in that context, it's a
compound interest problem that isn't figured by using straight division. If you
know someone who has a calculator that will do compound interest problems, it
might be interesting to see what rate of compounded annual interest would turn
$1 into $900 in 100 years. Off the top of my head, I think you'd be in the
ballpark of 15-20%.

At this time, I don't think there is any hard bottom for any stock. I have
profitable stocks trading below net cash on their balance sheets and yet they
are dropping every day. Theoretically company could just buy itself for cash,
go private and still have everything except their cash. Practically, these are
usually small Chinese companies that will not do this, since they need cash to
expand.

This is a buyer's market, not a seller's market. If you have cash, there are a
lot of deals. If you need to sell, my condolences. If you don't need to sell,
probably the best thing is to hold. ;) Unless you see much better opportunities
elsewhere. :)

Only 19 more days like today and the market is at 0! There still seems to be a
lot of forced selling from margin calls, hedge funds deleveraging their
positions gone sour and companies raising capital (selling new stock or calling
off stock buy backs).

At some point the value opportunities will over ride this net selling. I still
have some gainers that I want to sell now because I believe there are better
values now in other stocks. I am waiting for a significant dead cat bounce (VIX
closed at 54) to off load these winners and then plan to build new positions in
several of these oversold deep discounted value plays.

I think the market is setting up for a significant rally from some coordinated
global rate cut and/or new intervention. I plan to take more cash off the table
and after a few days begin to deploy new funds into several of the value plays
from my watch list.

I still think the final bottom will take months if not a few years before it is
in place. Therefore, there should be plenty of time to pick off several of the
value opportunities. I will be looking for good balance sheets and stable
dividends. Cash is still King.

On a market timing note, does anyone put much weight in the VIX being as high
as it is now? I think the only time it was higher was during the '87 crash.

Well, the VIX sure would seem like a contributing indicator that, even if we
are NOT in the latter innings of this ballgame, we could reasonably expect some
sort of rally very soon.

I'm looking too at the average peak-to-trough decline in recession-induced bear
markets for the last 50 years and it shows the average decline of nine such
bear markets was about 27%. As of today, the S&P is down 37% from its high. See
the chart in the following article.

http://www.hussman.net/rsi/recessionbears.htm
Note the article was written in Sept, 2007.

Looking at the range, rather than just the average decline, however, it's not
exactly a tight statistical distribution! In the 2000 recession-induced bear
market, the decline was close to 50%. The global financial system crisis would
suggest this is not your average bear market. Having said that, I have to think
that the upside/downside risk is improving daily. There is an enormous amount
of fear out there.

Keep in mind that the average loss for all bear market declines of the past 80
years has been 30%, but the average loss for those bear markets lasting a year
or more has been -42%. And that's an average. From peak to today the Dow
decline is about average for bears lasting a year or more. My tendency is to
dispel the idea that the magnitude of this one can be predicted based on past
bear markets as we are in a new frontier. But its certainly worse than average.

EURO CORP-Spreads wider, crisis fears offset rate cuts
Reuters - 08/10/2008 17:20:49
LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - European credit spreads widened on Wednesday as a
boost from concerted global interest rate cuts earlier in the day wore off,
overcome by worries about recession and the soundness of the world banking
system.

Credit default swaps on British banks continued tighter, however, following the
government's multi-billion pound plan to inject capital and liquidity into the
banking system.

By 1507 GMT, the investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index <ITEEU5Y=GF> was
at about 129 basis points, according to data from Markit, 4 basis points wider
versus late on Tuesday. The index had tightened to 117.5 basis points shortly
after central banks announced a 50 basis point cut at midday.

"We have entered a new and potentially very dangerous phase of the banking
crisis," wrote Nigel Myer, a banking credit analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort in a
note to clients.

"No one quite knows what the rules are. Creditors to banks in danger of failing
might be alright, they might all be wiped out or they might actually benefit
from a sovereign guarantee. In recent weeks all three have occurred."

Until creditors do come to understand what their risks are, there is likely to
be little incentive for interbank lending to return to normal, he said.
"Further intervention by the authorities looks necessary to stabilise money
markets and prevent more liquidity problems."

The Markit iTraxx Crossover index <ITEXO5Y=GF>, made up of 50 mostly
"junk"-rated credits, was at 638 basis points, 23 basis points wider.

In the UK, CDS on five-year senior debt of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) were
at 210 basis points, about 60 basis points tighter on the day, a trader said.

Comparable CDS on Barclays (BARC.L) were offered at 150 basis points, around 70
basis points tighter. CDS on HBOS (HBOS.L) were about 30 basis points tighter
at 202 basis points, the trader said.

The Markit iTraxx five-year senior financials index <ITEFA5Y=IE> was at about
113.5 basis points, the trader said, about 6.5 basis points tighter on the day.

Hi with_a_K -

Closed out my CSX Corp. (CSX) position which I started on 9/17/07 @ $40.61. It
was an excellent run hitting a high of $70.07 but I did not want to book a loss
so I closed out my position today at $45.25. With the dividends, I booked a 13%
return.

Sold half of my JNJ with a similar gain.

I eventually want to re-enter back into these companies at lower prices on any
continued sell off.

I put part of the proceeds into ERF a Canadian Oil Trust that now yields 22% at
my buy in price of $23.50. Unfortunately all of my other buys are at higher
levels but my average price/yield s/b 14%. Their oil and Gas portfolio is
hedged to produce enough revenue to pay their dividend as long as Oil stays
above $60/barrel.

I am a bit frustrated that I did not peel off some of the CSX shares near the
top but was lucky to peel some on the JnJ shares at the high.

You certainly made a good pick in your 10/24/07 posting for Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Corp. (BNI) at $84.20. It traded as high as $114.58 (36% gain) but
like CSX has made a round trip back to $81. When the economy eventually
recovers and oil trades above $100/barrel, these railroad stocks s/b excellent
long term value investments. They are the most efficient way to move goods per

PBR seems to have a great future ahead of it if we can wait for the oil

what's going on.

History of this company indicates it ought to survive normal bad times.

A company only has to be in the insurance sector to be sold off today. ACGL has
been rock solid and just got a credit upgrade from AM Best, and today it's at
2-3-year lows.

I'll take more Royal Caribbean Cruises - RCL - at current price.

A most small add.

Yes. NWLI another example.

A record-breaking loss for me that I'm not thrilled about--- losing $90/sh. on
one stock in a couple of hours:

Well, BRKB dropped to $3700 at one point and WSC is still at $290. While Fido
ate my money, so I could not buy anything. :( Of course, I should thank them -
tomorrow I'll probably get it for 10% cheaper :P

I was able to pick up some SFL and DRYS at the close. The problem is my system
feed was hanging and only got partial execution on my trade amounts. My broker
(Charles Schwab) may have been having system problems on their server.

AMAT ended positive on the day....go figure. This was one I was thinking of
selling.

I have never seen so much selling with such a buyer's strike. I do know from
the phone calls I have been getting, there will be lots of margin calls and
forced selling tomorrow morning. A lot of the good stocks were being sold today
to raise capital. This includes most of the consolidated oil companies.

The value investor likes to pick up companies that other people are forced to
sell that are significantly undervalued. Cash is still King. Any buys I make
are done in very small amounts.

It's still too early to even think of loading up. On any significant bounce, I
have my list of stocks for sale and may even consider selling some of my recent
purchases for a quick gain.

Paul,

Fortunately had sold RCL in mid 20s. Unfortunately, I didn't sell everything
else at the same time.

I am like a deer in the headlight - staring, but unable to react. Sell, hold,
or buy - no easy choice.

I've been waiting 7 days for that "significant bounce" !!!! :)

Best opportunity may be Monday or Tuesday....tomorrow will be interesting, but
I wouldn't expect a reversal day on a Friday, although we are so oversold at
this point, who knows...Art Cashen wants to see the washout and then rebound
and large volume reversal, close near the highs of the day.....surely we are
close to being there, short-term at least....longer-term, looks like nothing
but global gloom-and-doom at this point....whoever wins the election will
probably be wishing he had lost within a few months of being President..... :)

STT, MET and insurers -
Business cannot be good for insurers. They are in the "confidence" business and
with a stock chart that looks like a black hole, how are they going to close on
long term insurance contracts? Everybody who is in the "confidence business"
like Banks, insurers, money managers, hedge funds etc. are in big trouble. I
closed a term life insurance contract with Transamercia last year (runner up
was AIG direct) and keep on checking their stock quote (Aegon owns them) every
time I sent them my monthly payment.

The health insurers are somewhat better off because their contracts are short
term in nature, IMO
I think eventually the government needs to backstop everything in the
"confidence business" , banks, money managers, insurers, commercial paper
issuers etc. to break the viscous circle of distrust that stall the whole
economy.

I sold STT for a smallish loss today near the intraday height - one of my
"lucky" trades today. Bought some UL today on the rapid fall because i figure
that people still will eat some food going forward.
