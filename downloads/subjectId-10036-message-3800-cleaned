I bought St. Joe at 18 (adjusted for the split and the return of capital
dividend) and bought Tejon at 17 and sold it at 31. Tejon is fairly valued in
my view (it could be worth 50 and it could be worth 20). The very interesting
real estate play on your list is Florida East Coast because it has a catalyst.
St. Joe will make another bid on FLA within the next year. Its the only way
they can consolidate their land development franchise. No, I have not bought it
yet, but I probably should.

TRC, been there, done that. I should have known y'all had gone there already.

I think you have a very good point regarding SJP's flexibility and potential.
They have land in the right place, and have management who knows how to develop
it on a large scale. I think that SJP is way ahead of the development curve
compared to TRC. But development is a slow process, and the really big gains
from SJP are likely to be several years out.

Another stock I mentioned, TPL (Texas Pacific Land Trust), is, well, bizarre.
This outfit will sell their land, but won't seek buyers. They are the largest
private landowner in the state of Texas (sound familiar?). Most of their land
is West Texas scrub but some is prime El Paso real estate. The Yahoo msg boards
on TPL make a very interesting read. But there is no development potential like
St. Joe, and West Texas appears to be going nowhere fast. TPL is (slowly)
selling off the land, while also (quickly) doing share buybacks . As one astute
fellow on Yahoo put it, "The last shareholder left standing at the end is the
winner. Thus, this is a no-brainer holding if you live long enough." (a value
stock, but only for your heirs' heirs?). Anyhow, even if TPL is well
underpriced, it's hard to see how that value will be unlocked anytime soon.
With St. Joe, we know we have management capable of unlocking the value of the
real estate assets.

I agree with you. I think I'll add a few more shares of SJP and leave TRC
alone.

Investor2, the assets weren't phony --- the depreciation charges were. That's
why you need real knowledge of the industry. What is the appropriate time frame
to fully depreciate a semi-submbersible oil rig? How about hubs and routers for
networks?

I simply bring these things up because when you do "value" investing you rely
to a great extent on the honesty and judgement of management. Unfortunately,
industry analysts are not real analysts -- they are touts and salesmen. And
CPA's are hired by the companies they audit and they want to be rehired.

James C: re fear in tobacco stocks. That maximum point is maybe possible to see
only in hindsight. So perfect an issue for Wash. politicos. Tax the tobacco
co's to get rev's., force people away from smoking because that's the
righteous, moral things to be doing, and with all the ballyhoo, divert voters'
attention from other more controversial issues. If Pres. Clinton makes it an
issue to the extent as was done with health care (I'm thinking back to the '93
opportunities with pharmaceuticals), there will IMO be a better buying
opportunity when it seems that the tobacco companies will be forced out of
business (or their discounted cash flows will be projected to drop
dramatically). I would bet that MO and BAT would survive, and even thrive,
because of their foreign exposure. Because I think that in emerging countries,
tobacco is one of the first "pleasures" very poor people can step up to as they
get jobs and small amts. of discretionary income.
But I just don't have enough conviction or courage now to buy either co. -g-.

I disagree. I am hoping Shane could put up grids of P/E, P/B and P/S
against sales growth quartiles and price performance to see what sections of
the grids give the best performance; and use that prospectively to create a
list of interesting stocks.

P/FFO and D/E are more for examining the merits of individual companies, in my
opinion. For example, a company in the highest sales growth quartile might have
mediocre FFO, because of the need for additional working capital to support the
higher sales. (FFO and sales growth tend to be inversely related.)

If it were necessary to answer such questions before determining whether to
invest, then there'd be darn few people investing. Of course, one could say
there SHOULD be a lot fewer people buying these stocks. On the other hand, I
prefer to take the position that perhaps the answers (therefore the questions)
might not be significant to individual investors who are making buying

And now... here's a 40,000 employee, int'l co. you've never heard of:

BOC Group PLC or BOX.

Very interesting (to me anyway -g-) co. and a very innovative co. PE is high at
about 17 but there's a 3.6% div. yield (all per Yahoo). Stock is at 30.3/4 in a
yearly range of 28.1/4 to 39. As with many of these English or euro co.'s,
financial information is hard to access from our American databases. (Which
translates as: I sure couldn't find historical psr's, pe's, p/bv -g-.) From the
company's website, they are in 3 businesses (4th bus. is being sold)--
industrial gases, vacuum products, and contract logistics (and this is
essentially, trucking food/commodoties around England and the continent).
Industrial gas business is a necessary and specialized bus. - there are about 4
players in the oligarchy. BOX is trying to differentiate itself by providing
superior customer support (although, of course, its competitors are trying to
do the same).
I like BOX because it does seem to be innovative. This is only a personal
preference, as I have no data or research which indicates that innovative
companies produce revenue and profits greater/better than less innovative
companies. (Some people would say maybe the LESS innovative, the better -
Microsoft??). Two new product announcements that might be of interest to some
thread readers are: (for our MD's) a Hepatitis B DNA vaccine delivered by BOX's
just developed needle-less injection system; and (for our CALM egg farmers) an
ozone system for reducing bacteria in the chiller baths of poultry processors
(I know killing ("processing") chickens isn't the same biz. as egg farming, but
them ole hens gotta go somewhere).
BOX earnings aren't so great - they seem to be mightily affected by currency
(strength of dollar, and strength of pound). And I'm not too happy about the
PE. However, the management seems aggressive and committed to shareholder value
(they're selling one underperforming business), and the dividend offers some
protection to the patient. I expect the stock to be significantly higher in 3
years. I've bought some at a little higher price, and I expect I will average
down if the price goes lower from current. JMO and I've been wrong many, many
times before. Paul

The St. Joe piece is at:

http://www.pathfinder.com/fortune/pfortune/0427joe.html

Thanks Paul. The article is essentially a carbon copy of my
Investor "Top Pick for 98" piece on St. Joe, except I was
told to do it in less than 400 words. No surprises, and I agree
with the article.

The Telebras piece is interesting, but again it's nothing new.
I feel it is a very very big deal that all 12 pieces will trade as
ADRs. For a 2nd world country, Brazil is acting awfully sophisticated
and proper in its dealings with the world currency markets
and US investors.

Along with Deswell, these are my three biggest investments.
I've said enough about Deswell. If it ever falls below 20 again,
I'll buy more again.

Has anyone here taken a look at Adaptec (ADPT)? Historically, the
company has earned high ROE and adapted well to various
movements in the PC world. Management is now taking
heat, earnings are falling short, and the stock is trading
way down. Even the bulls can't make a good case for it.
And I'm on the verge of buying it.

Did everyone see the Bill Gates/Callaway Golf advertisement
entitled "I Love a Big Idea." I wonder how they pulled that off.
Anyway, Callaway is another company that is getting punished
but I feel has shown great innovation and returns. Best of
all, it is easy to see past the current troubles. Looking to
pick it up too.

Hewlett Packard derives only 20% of its sales from PC's.
What a great opportunity to pick up a technology stalwart
that you know will be around forever. I can't believe it
moves so lock-step with the PC cos. I'm already in.

If I'm going to invest in PC's, then I'm going to invest in
Micron Electronics (MUEI). I just finished shopping for a PC,
and there's no doubt they were the only ones that could
supply what I needed. What other PC maker is developing
chipsets more advanced than Intel and released before
Intel? Even after it's current run to 14, it is the cheapest
PC maker by just about every ratio, next to Apple. But there's
no debt and there's a substantial amount of cash, and
yes, there's a research department. A visit to their web site
shows they are finally getting it right. They seem to be
implementing the JIT model well. With their operations getting
in line, they become an easier takeover candidate and should
move to more fair valuations.

Sorry for the long note. I can't update my web site or write
articles since I have no PC (it crashed and burned), and
this is an easy outlet.

jeffrey,

No contest. I have had no luck finding good buys with any screening grid format
I've tried. My suggestions are for individual stocks as you say, but PE, P/BV,
and P/S are also variables that do not necessarily represent the value of a
stock. A list based on these parameters, even with my suggestions added, will
likely bring forth a group of tech and oil stocks because they are historical
values.

Investors have been trying to find a mathematical formula for finding
undervalued stocks since there has been a market. None have been successful and
I don't think, even with computers, that one ever will be.

Shane, I think the real trick is to repeat that for P/Book and P/Sales and see
which gives the most noticeable "sweet spot". You then use that one as the
primary variable, and use the other two to possibly carve up that sweet spot
more precisely. (Ideally, if you had enough data points, you would create a
three-way P/E, P/B, P/S grid to test
which part of that 3-way grid was best.)

When does eaglg become callable? If you received uis stock on the conversion of
their bonds you know quite well that buying in the money bonds can be a losing
proposition if the company decides to call and you have invested into bonds
which are offered at a premium to conversion price. My Ibd shows convertibility
price of eaglg at 18 which means bond now has 14% premium to conversion with
bond price at 114. You might wish to look at ach 7.5%/01 convertible for
reasonable chance for rise above current 101 price should market drive up price
of common. Solid assets of this REIT make it very safe as an interest
play,which is how I view it. For a speculation,albeit a reasonable one, you
should review hechh. Greene and company bought out the Hechinger family
interests and also acquired K-Marts builders square unit. Combined, this is the
third biggest entity in the sector. Two positive writeups were made the
Washington Post in the past two months . Greene and company have been very
successful in their turnaround efforts in the past. After 6 months still
without positive cash slow but company has never missed a dividend on the bond,
last paid on April 1. About 67 million in cash assets and 110 million in hidden
assets on books because bonds are carried at full value but are trading at only
40. I am speculating that positive cash flow will be reached in next year and
that bonds will be priced closer to their ccc rating, about 70. If I am right
the return to hold will be 14% on basis of dividends and 75% on price. High
risk but possible returns warrant a look.

17% YTM.
Re Eaglg, you are right the debenture is callable at 103.570, HOWEVER only if
the stock trades over 27$ for 20/30 days, which of course would drive the bond
up to at least $150. Eagle perked up a bit on thursday, I personally think this
is an undervalued growth story and hope to see it back into the mid 20's before

Jeff,

I'm going to try and post the data on PE's below.

Hope it's not too ugly.

The data has been analyzed as follows. Using AAII Stock Investor data.
Reduced the dataset to stocks with a price change for Y1/Y2 where Y1 and Y2
represent the most recent two complete fiscal years in the database.
From this I threw out all stocks with a Y2 market cap of $35 million or below
(primarily threw these out because I don't invest in companies much smaller
than this.) Then I restricted the data to stocks with a positive PE in Y2.

All of these restrictions produced a dataset of 2918 stocks.

The data has been broken down into strata of Y2 PE, and 12mm Sales Per
Share change at Y2. Price change is measured as Y1/Y2 (12 months into the
future).

There are four tables: Average Price Change (Y1/Y2), Median Price Change
(Y1/Y2),
Group counts (number of stocks in each grouping),
and the win percentage (percent of stocks in each category that went up in
price (y1/y2).

You'll notice the "sweet spot" of above average returns right in the center of
the grid.
I know there are alot of numbers, so I'm just going to post these so you can
see
them and digest. If anything about the grids is unclear (and I'm sure there's
something) let me know and I'll try to explain.

Michael,

It looks like we are sharing some stocks in our
universes. :-)

I have no comment on SJP and TBR except that
I find them interesting. :-)

Regarding ADPT, I looked at it and decided that
I can't see whether they will survive the next round
of PC-on-a-chip consolidation and what are the future
high-margin high-growth areas that the management will find.
They fall into a class of companies that I don't understand
and that I would have to buy just on the belief that the
management knows what they are doing. Similar to MOT, NSM,
TXN, IDTI. I will not buy it but I know that I may miss a
superstock.

Additional comment on all semi stocks including INTC and
HWP - they all are very capital intensive and spend incredible
amounts of cash-flow on capital expenditures. Even INTC spends
all its income on capital expenditures! They have a positive
cash flow after adding depreciation and amortization but
it's still mind boggling. ;-)

I am waiting for more downside on ELY - it's still too
expensive for me. I would buy HWP at the current price if I
had more cash.

Good luck

Hi Mike sorry about your PC.

I have concluded that I do not understand enough about tech stocks to invest in
them. It seems that when they look like bargains they are not and when they
seem overpriced it is because they have or about to have some technological
edge. There is a new book out called the gorilla you may want to look at.

After reading the article in Fortune re SJP it makes me want to go down to
Talahasee and check the place out. I don't see the urgency of investing in SJP
at these levels. They seem to be expanding into different areas and I predict
some learning curve difficulties which may augur for a better entry price.

Big MO looks really cheap to me and I find it hard to believe that this will
not be a profitable investment. Addictive substance pushing usually is. SO
personally if I were to pick a can't lose stock for 1998 MO would be it. I 'm
surprised buffett isn't a big investor in it.

I just purchase a closed end fund-Royce Global Value. It trades at a 17%
discount! I don't know why. the other royce closed funds trade at 8% discounts.

I also own Deswell and TBR as well as Elamf.

There is a monthly update CD for around $200 annually now called "Stock
Investor Pro". They currently don't have web based price updates, but I've
talked to the programmers and they say they're working on it.

AAII has a web site (not sure of the address, but maybe www.aaii.org) that
describes what's on the CD. Brief description, the Pro version has 7 years of
fundamental historicals in addition to most recent 8 quarters. Balance sheet,
Income statmt, and Cashflow. IBES earnings estimates are included too.

Data lag is somewhat of a problem, but usually not more than a quarter.

It's not good for charting if that's your thing, but for fundamentals it has
about everything I could want.

Don't know about Microsoft Investor, but I believe it is web based. One
advantage of having datasets on a CD is being able to export sizeable datasets
to Excel and further work with them. I'd think something web based may be
limited in that respect.

Good luck,

Liquidation Mode

I sold about 25% of my stock portfolio today and plan to sell another 20%
within the next few weeks. I was 15% in cash to begin with, so you do the math.
I have never done this before, so this reflects some serious concern.

I put about 10% into Morgan Stanley Asia Pacific Fund (APF), a closed end cross
section of Asia, including Japan, trading at a 18% discount to NAV. (The
specific country closed ends are all at big premiums to NAV. I would not touch
them.) I intend to average more into this investment over the next several
months, as I sell my U.S. stocks.

I am looking to sell anything that I do not have a big short term tax hit in.
So if I've owned it 18 months and its near my price target, I'm selling. And if
I just bought it recently, I'm selling all but special cases. Its not panic -
that's when the market is going down. I just do not want to have my net worth
in a market trading at 26 times trailing earnings, where earnings estimates are
coming down and every single "expert" is wildly bullish. If this isn't a top,
its got to be pretty close to one.

In reading the Wall Street Journal this morning, I read that three of the five
largest mergers ever have happened in the last WEEK. And that bearish sentiment
is about the lowest it gets, at a time when valuation is as high as its ever
been. What that tells me is that everybody who could invest has. Thats what we
call a top. Earnings are just starting to come out this week, and I think there
is going to be some carnage. If we get through this quarter intact, something
else is going to do it.

As anybody who has read my posts for the last two years knows, I am no market
timer - I look at one stock at a time. But when sentiment and valuation are at
extremes, as I believe they are both in the U.S. and in Asia, I have to act.
Selling U.S. stocks and investing the proceeds half in cash, half in an Asia
closed end selling at an 18% discount. This may look like a really stupid trade
now, and may look even more stupid in six months, but we'll see how dumb it
looks three years from now.

I'm currently contemplating taking a similar course of action and, like you, I
have never done that before. I am almost envious of you, since I haven't been
able to work up enough courage (or motivation? or fear?) to begin liquidation
of stocks that I've held for years. The capital gains on most of my portfolio
are huge. My typical cost basis is about 25 to 30 percent of the current market
value, and I just can't bring myself to incur such a large capital gains bill.

How did you finally decide to do it? Any words of encouragement?

Best wishes,

P.S. And where are you putting the rest of the proceeds, in a 5% money market

Thanks for the URL. Looks like the information will be quite a translation
puzzle for me. But basically, I expect BOX earnings and dividends to increase
over time -- that seems to have been the case since '93, and I'm betting this
will continue.
I don't use volume to make buy decisions (although I understand there are
several reasons why other people do -- TA or perhaps people want to make sure
there's a big enough door if they want to sell quickly). I sometimes use volume
in making sell decisions though. (For example, today sold 1/3 of my small amt.
of NationsBank -- very popular stock today -g-.)

Shane, great job! I would summarize these results as saying the somewhat below
average P/E companies with manageable sales growth rates are the place to look,
and the high P/E companies with sales growth rates at or below the P/E are the
ones to avoid. The latter is intuitive, the former is not. Perhaps the very low
P/E companies are low because the market correctly perceives a problem more
often than not.

Could you do this on P/Sales?

Re: Liquidation mode

I don't consider it courage, I consider it common sense. But ask me that
question again in six months if the market doubles again!

As a scholar of value investing, I have done a lot of reading on market bottoms
- what stocks look like when you can really steal them. That sounds like Japan
today. It sounds EXACTLY the opposite of what I am seeing every day in the US
market.

Lately I have been doing some research on market tops. What I have concluded is
that the psychology today is extreme. And so is the valuation. Warren Buffett
implies strongly that he has not bought a stock in a year and the media
trumpets his words (which any Buffett scholar would have read as pro forma)
that the market may not be overvalued, though it lacks a margin of safety. My
own mother will enthusiastically buy anything I tell her to buy, but will not
listen to my sell recommendations because my last couple sells went up further
after she sold. I work for a deep value fund that is scared to death to hold
cash and "risk" underperforming the S+P though every portfolio manager is in
cash personally. Thats what our clients say they want. If deep value investors
have no cash, who is going to "buy the dips"? An interesting question. Ah, the
individual investors. But I know more individual investors who are on margin
than in cash. What if the market goes down, guys? Oh, we'll buy the dips. With
what? More margin? Can we say uh-oh?

What really scared me though was when the Wall Street Journal published an
editorial (not by its own staff) two weeks ago saying that the market is not
overvalued, in fact it is at half its real value. Because equities have no
risk. In finance speak, equities deserve no risk premium. That is an incredible
argument, and I can remember the last time I heard it.

I worked in Japan as a real estate analyst for a major U.S. securities firm in
1994. Our clients (the Japanese banks and developers) had already been
brutalized, and they were starting to face what they had done wrong, buying
both U.S. and domestic Japanese real estate for twice what it was worth under
the most optimistic forecast. What they told me after a few rounds of sake was
that they had assumed that real estate was a special case, that it would go up
forever. In 1989 they thought they had demographics and finance to back them
up, but in hindsight their forecasts were absurd. And they have still not
recovered ten years later. I am a 29 year old securities analyst, the kind that
has never seen a bear market. But I have. Because I covered the Japanese from
1991 to 1995. It was ugly, and it still is.

To repeat my last post, I am in the process of selling at least half of my U.S.
equity position, which I have never done before, and reinvesting half in an
Asian closed end at a discount to NAV and half in cash earning whatever cash
earns.

I am not scared...any more.

From:Shane M

jeff,

I agree with your summary. Based on the data I'd say the "sweet spot" would be
companies with PE above 8 and below 20, and sales per share growth between 0%
and 20%.

Coming from a "value" frame of mind, I was sortof surprised that good
performance could consistently be found in stocks with PEs up to around the 18
to 20 range. I had expected the superior returns to begin diminishing at lower
PEs.

Another thing that surprised me is that moderately negative sales per share
growth (between 0 and -10%) at low PE's seems to be acceptable as long as the
PE is held lower, to between 8 to 16. I'm interested to see if this effect
persists using other valuation methods.

One thing in particular that I found interesting was the "win percentages" in
the preferred section of the grid. I'm one of these fellows that really hates
to see my stock go down, and approx 85% of the stocks in this range had price
appreciation in the year. In terms of safety of principle this range seems
favorable also.

I plan to look into doing P/S and P/Bk as time permits, but probably won't be
before the weekend. Hopefully can put everything together and develop a screen
that produces a managable number of stocks with consistent market beating
characteristics.

Keep in mind that this is just data over the course of 12 months for the
selected stock sample. Like they say in the mutual fund prospectus: "Past
performance is no guarantee of future results"

BTW, One thing I forgot to mention when I posted the numbers was that I had
also excluded financial sector stocks from consideration.

I've heard you give this argument before. It
was last year at Dow 7500. Why is it valid any more now
than it was then?

>who is going to "buy the dips"? An interesting question.
> Ah, the individual investors. But I know more individual
> investors who are on margin than in cash.

I think you contradict yourself here. First, you say
that all fund managers are in cash (which is not true, look
at Third Avenue and Tweedy Browne guys :-)). Then you say
that all individual investors are on margin. I can add
anecdotal evidence that lots of money is on the sidelines.
And lots of money is still going to come into the market.
I'm in high tech industry and all my graduating friends
are going to extend the market and Silicon Valley real estate
bubbles. :-)

>what stocks look like when you can really steal them.
> That sounds like Japan today.

I'm interested to hear why you think so. From what
I read the cross-ownership, subsidiary accounting and
hidden debts make impossible to value any Japanese company.
I would stick with INTC at 5 PSR and increased competition
but with excellent disclosure instead of buying
a possibly bankrupt operation at 0.03 PSR.

Finally, I still see a lot of companies that I like
long term. Agreed, they are not steals but they are
reasonable buys. Semi-equips are in a cyclical slump where
PEs don't mean a damn. Some semis (INTC, HWP), your
real-estate play SJP, Mike's TBR and poor NKE are interesting.
I am not saying we won't see a crash but I'm not
gonna get out of the market because some idiot in WSJ
writes that stocks are risk-free.

Good luck

<<I've heard you give this argument before. It

I probably did argue bearishly before. But don't believe anybody's bearish
argument if it does not also say they are selling significant portions of their
portfolio. This time I'm putting my money where my mouth is, meaning I see
something new here. I tried to explain it, but so much of it is gut.

But, as you ask, why is my argument any more valid now than it was at Dow 7500?
Thats a question that answers itself. The market is up 20% since then! That is
at least two "normal" years of gains by historical standards within less than
one year. And it was hardly a cheap market last year. I considered the market
P/E then extended, and it was about 20 or 21. Now its 26 or 27. And that was
before Asia collapsed. Asia was the "growth story" at so many companies which
now brag about how only 5% of their business is in Asia. (I refer to
Caterpillar, United Airlines or just about any consumer products company - yes
Mike, Nike too)

I'm not asking you to sell your portfolio just because I am selling mine. I am
not selling the stocks I have with big long term gains - yet - because I don't
want to pay taxes. But they're next. I had one of them jump 10% today. Its
probably gone tomorrow. But if I owned Coca Cola at 10 would I sell it?
Probably not. All I'm doing is presenting an argument. This is not fear - this
is coldly rational. Which is why I will sleep very well even if the market goes
50% higher. We are in a mania right now. My suggested reading list would be the
first chapter of Contrarian Investing or the first three chapters of Popular
Delusions and the Madness of Crowds (or whatever the title is - its a 19th
century work by a writer named MacKay. Should be on every value investor's
bookshelf so we can keep our heads in times like these). You can never pick the
top of a mania, and you are a fool to try. The key is recognizing that there is
a mania and getting out so you can watch rationally from the sidelines. Is this
a well accepted argument? Of course not. A correct contrarian argument, by
definition, never is. (Though neither is an incorrect contrarian argument, like
"buy Japan" in 1991.)

And that brings me to your next question. Why would I put that money into Asia?
Asia looks absolutely awful. I agree with just about everything you said. But
that is exactly when you want to invest. Do you realize that there are many
profitable companies in Japan and Asia trading at less than the value of the
cash on their balance sheets? With a sophisticated institutional screen, it
would take you about five minutes to find a profitable net-net in Japan. This
is the second largest consumer economy, and arguably the best educated, in the
world. Like I said before, this trade may look very very stupid in six months,
but that is not my time horizon.

Respectfully,

Jim

First of all, there are numerous stocks that are
lower than they were last year. Almost all examples from
my previous post fall there. So the saying "market is up
20%" is meaningless especially from a value investor
who claims to buy companies and not market.
To take this argument to extreme, if tomorrow BRK.A fell to
$1000 per share while Dow climbed to 20000, would you
hold cash because "market is overvalued" and gonna crash?

For example, I am not buying anything because
I see a lot of companies as "weak buys" but not "screaming
buys". So I just see no compulsion to buy but this is not
dependent on the market level.

> And that was before Asia collapsed. Asia was

Yes, but now they can say that it's a cyclical
decline and PEs are irrelevant until next Asian pickup. :-)

This is something that I find surprising. You would
sell something which is close to fair value but you would
hold a grossly overvalued stock for tax reasons?
Hmm... I guess, I had different ideas about value investing. :-)

> This is not fear - this is coldly rational.

I don't agree that it's rational.
What is a rational benchmark behind your claim:

> We are in a mania right now.

I interpret your position as follows: "Something
ticked me off, so I am selling. Hey, but I need a justification
for that. Let's see... Market PE is 26-27. Voila! Rational
explanation!" I'd regard your decision as rational if
you said: "I am going to sell company XXX when its PE is
greater than 26". Or even if you said: "I am going to sell
half of equities when market PE crosses 27". You say it
yourself: "I tried to explain it, but so much of it is gut."

Regardless whether your decision was rational or gut
feeling, I disagree with painting the market with "Mania"
brush. Definitely, there are excesses but I don't think they
warrant selling undervalued companies to get "safety".

BTW, I am not trying to talk you in changing
your mind. I am still trying to work out my investment
approach, and such discussions stimulate ideas about
overall strategies.

I agree with one of your reasons for selling:
you gonna sleep better at night. :-)

>Re: Asia. With a sophisticated institutional screen, it

Hmm. Could you give us some examples. I don't have
an access to institutional screens. May I ask why you are
buying some closed-end fund instead of buying these
net-net values in Japan? I would assume that the fund will
have worse performance than your personal selections.

You are not a "kneejerk fearmonger" and I was never
trying to make you one. I was just wondering why people
start making decisions using macro economic and
general market data when most of their investment decisions
were made using company specific data. I find this
intriguing and, yes, irrational.

To tell about myself, I have done some
market timing, and I am pretty bad with it. So I decided
to follow mostly valuation based buy-and-sell approach
combined with buy-and-hold forever. Consequently I am
surprised that lots of people whom I regard as great
value investors use some sort of market timing and short
term trading. Mike Burry does some shorting, you do a
portfolio adjustment to cash, etc. I am also surprised
that lots of fundamental investors turn bearish while
I still find attractive buys.

I'm interested in whether these decisions are
"kneejerk reactions", succumbing to the pressure of too
much media (like the WSJ story you mentioned), ego trips
("I know better than these jerks in a market"), or
whether they are well thought of hedges, portfolio allocation
plans, and overall sell strategies. I was trying to
find out exactly how you got into your decision and
to raise some (controversial) questions. I would ask
the same questions to Vinick (sp?) and Buffett
but they are not on SI. :-) :-(

To confuse matters even more, I think that
intuition based style may work great for some people,
so "irrational" is not a dirty word in my dictionary. :-)

> I am not posting any more justifications

Here's a thing I don't understand. Why do
you care about justifications? First of all, I understand
your reasons and I think they are valid - at least for you.
Second, even if I thought they were totally wrong - why do
you care? I'm not your boss... :-)))

If you are right, justifications are unnecessary.
If you are wrong, they won't help. ;-) Even if you
are wrong, nobody's been right all the time. People
worship W. Buffett, but they forget how many mistakes
he made.

> I'd love to dissect that last post

If you have time and interest, I'd like to see

James: making stock/bond (or cash) allocation would have to be judgment call -
with each of us having different opinions. Per Graham (1974), "If, as we have
long believed, the stock market has lost contact with its old bounds, and if
new ones have not yet been established, then we can give the investor no
reliable rules by which to reduce his common-stock holdings toward the 25%
minimum and rebuild them later to the 75% maximum."
Writing about the high (-g-) levels being seen in 1972, Graham says (p. 42),
"...we would counsel against against a greater than 50% apportionment to common
stocks at this time. But, for complementary reasons, it is almost equally
difficult to advise a reduction of the figure well below 50%, unless the
investor is disquieted 'in his own mind' (Graham's italics)about the market
level, and will be satisfied also to limit his participation in any further
rise to, say 25% of his total funds." Looks like you're following exactly what
Graham says. (I equate cash in money market funds with bonds in all of this.)

Interesting to read about concern for selling due to tax consequences. Since
value investors buy undervalued and sell at full or fair value, I would expect
tax ramifications not to be the key component for determining timing of sales.
At least that's what I would expect from myself for value stocks. However, it
seems in this market, when many value stocks go up so quickly, I find that I
seem to want to hold on to reach 12 or 18 month timeframes. Or try to offset
losses with gains or vice versa. Just can't seem to ignore the tax consequences
in the sell decision -g-. Paul

CFWY projected earnings growth of 7.5% and a PE of 19.9, not for me

while these 3 have better p/b etc., looking at the whole sector USAK's numbers
are very favorable. Combined with the growth they are showing and the swamping
of estimates over the last 5-6 qtrs., I feel this is still the best play of all

James,

I've done some reshuffling as well. The sealpoint portfolio is
now about 25% cash, and that cash will be used to pay off
a 9% mortgage. Once that's paid, the portfolio will be
100% invested again. What did I sell? Swisher, Pacificare,
Medusa, and ALR. Swisher and ALR are tax loss partial offsets for
the profits in Pacificare and Medusa. If I was bullish on the
market, I wouldn't play this game. I hope to buy back Swisher
and ALR cheaper.

Another portfolio is now 23% invested in the Prudent Bear Fund.
It rose nearly 11% on October 27th, and "The Bear Book"
brought it to my attention. This portfolio is
the one that is short Nike, and long Ciena and HP along
with Deswell, Telebras, and St. Joe. I'm looking at the
best way to take a 10% Asian position in this portfolio as well,
knowing that Telebras and Deswell move with Asia.
I invested in APF when it looked cheap at 10, and got out
around 9 5/8 thankfully. So I'm a bit burned on it. Also,
Barton Biggs touted the Fund in his roundtabe, while it
turns out that some Morgan Stanley funds were actually
selling it.

It's nice the market has given
us this extra cushion by running up so high - I've been
fully invested the last 4 months - but now it certainly feels
like time to take some equity off the table.

Jurgis,

I agree that the market level is deceptive. There
are companies that look attractive. I list them here
and there and everyhwere. But more and more
it is obvious that the value candidates I find really
do have something seriously wrong - something
that depends as much on chance as Ciena
hitting the next earnings number. This degradation
in the quality of candidates - and the rise of
virtually all of my "value" stocks - tells me that
the market is hitting an extreme level.

I feel that value investors have an edge as market
timers. We know when the there is a general
decrease in the quality of our candidates. I'm
certainly seeing it now. With the confirmation
in the broader market ratios, I'm wary
and am backing it up with shorts and decreased
equity weightings. The Nike short, to me, is
a good short. But the market has been tearing
straight up. Nike just stands there. What if
the market had been declining 10-20%? Given
Nike's problems and its performance during
this blowoff, I'm sure it would exaggerate the
decline.

Value investing is my main vehicle, but if I were
to not add my own wrinkles to the game, then
I might as well throw my money in with Tweedy
Browne or Marty Whitman, as surely they
know traditional value investing better than me.

You'll want to update your research on APF (Morgan Stanley Asia Pacific Fund).
The fund started buying back its own shares in January, and the discount to NAV
closed to about 6%. Then they announced they had solved that problem, so would
stop the buyback, and now the discount is back to 18%. They reserved the option
to repurchase shares again. And very important, Barton Biggs just bought a
bunch of APF shares personally. I'd consider that a very significant insider
buy. If Barton Biggs wants to buy Asia that is a plus in itself. But he has
many other ways he could do it.

The only other way I could find to buy a diversified portfolio in Asia without
paying a premium was through WEBS.

Totally agreed. I am thinking of having some part
of my money in TBGVX to gain global exposure. I am
reluctant to buy other international funds because I
don't like their management styles: top-down approaches,
country allocations, excessive turnover, etc. I don't like
Webs because these are broad market bets like SPYs in US.

I thought of buying stocks of foreign companies
but I am reluctant to do so because the research is difficult
and information is sketchy. I am following your investment
in DSWLF and TBR to gain some knowledge about pros
and cons. BTW, what is your take on currency fluctuations.
These influence individual investments. I know that TBGVX
hedges for currency fluctuations. We cannot do it in affordable
way, so what should we do?

The only drawback of TBGVX is that it's a global
fund, so it invests in US stocks too.

Good luck and thanks again

Thanks for link to Foolish analysis of Intel

There are so many things wrong in that analysis, that my head spins. First,
Intel will be lucky to earn $3.25 a share this year, and sells for 23 times
earnings as margins shrink and earnings drop. The revenues in the MPU sector
will be lucky to grow 10% a year as 25% unit growth is offset by declines in
ASPs. The drop in prices will be due to considerable new fab capacity coming
on-ine. By the end of 99, Intel,AMD, and NSM will be able to produce close to
180M to 200M units per year. Last year they only sold about 80-85M. There is no
reason why most MPUs should sell for more than $100 a pop by that time versus
the $250-400 today, and they won't. There will be a glut of MPUs on the market,
and more than 50% of all PCs will sell for less than $1000, and many PCs for
$500.

Funny how in the write-up, they seem to use the same trend as an argument for
Intel and against their competitors. Check the last wording in these paragraphs
about the move to 0.25 icron process and AMD's problem with yield. Yes, AMD has
yields of 50%, but they are transitioning to the 0.25 micron process. The move
will essentially double the number of chips per wafer at AMD's fab, and there
are new fabs starting up in Dresden and NSM has one in Portland, Maine along
with Intel's 2-3 new fabs.

To be sure, all of this is cause for concern, as Intel seems destined to see
EPS slide this year for the first time since 1989. On the other hand, the
chipmaker has still given no clear evidence that end-user demand for PCs has
actually slowed significantly. Grove blamed PC original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs) for Intel's sales slowdown, saying they had built more product than
end-customers purchased. Moreover, faster, more efficient Pentium IIs are
hitting the desktop and the notebook markets today, with shipments of Pentium
IIs surpassing Pentium shipments this week. Plus, Intel has now moved the bulk
of its production lines to the 0.25 micron
technology, which Micro Design Resources has figured will cut manufacturing
costs by as much as 60%.

As AMD struggles to boost chipmaking yields above 50%, it's still a reasonable
bet that Intel can weather the industry dislocations. If so, this company may
prove more valuable than the market has ever believed in the past, and far more
valuable than the market currently thinks.

I think they have blown the analysis because they have recommended Intel at a
much higher price in one of their portfolios (although its a dividend
reinvestment portfolio). They can't seem to admit that they have made a
mistake. They also don't seem to recognize the cyclical natures of some
industries in their valuation methods. They are repeating the mistakes they
made when they bought KLAC and AMAT right at the peak of the last semiconductor
equipment supplier cycle in their Fool Portfolio.

I sold the last of my Intel last September in the 90s, and am not interested in
the stock given the cyclical and secular trends in the microprocessor business.

I'll post a reply on the ECM thread.

I think we've discussed this several times over there, so lets keep the
discussion there.

I am very interested in the comments on whether the overall market is
overpriced at this point, and simply wanted to comment on one of the market
leaders over the last 8-10 years. I believe that a stock like Intel, that is
about to enter a cyclical downturn and loss of its monopoly position, shouldn't
trade for 23 times current year earnings. When I bought Intel several years
ago, it traded at 12 times forward earnings versus 16 forward earnings for the
S&P with interest rates in the 7.5% range. It was going into a cyclical upturn
and a stronger monopoly position in MPUs. As events unfolded, the earnings came
in even stronger than anticipated due to increased margins.

Now essentially all of that has changed. There is much more capital being
invested in the MPU sector which along with technical advances is driving
capacity up and will push margins down. The stock is trading at about the S&P
forward multiple of about 24 to 25 IMO, if not higher if margins really go
punk. And the S&P seems to be trading very close to overpriced territory, with
interest rates at 5.9%. I did an analysis early last year on the valuation of
the S&P500, and at that time at 20-21 times trailing and 17-18 times forward
earnings, I couldn't see the market as overvalued considering the low interest
rate environment. Now the market has appreciated to the point where I believe
any appreciation beyond here cannot be justified on a discounted future
earnings stream basis using the current interest rate. We are entering LaLa
Land.

The question is how far up will we fly, before the dream breaks, and how should
we position ourselves? Like many of you, I'm still finding fundamantal values,
and growth opportunites out there at a good price. Also, although its not the
purview of this thread, I have found several stocks that should rise or fall
almost entirely based on their ability to execute their business plan, and so
do not contain much "market risk".

I have found the stocks I like the best on the NASDAQ, are foreign stocks, and
now own five foreign stocks that together comprise 60% of my portfolio (mostly
in the sector I know best) up from maybe 30% last summer. These stocks are
heavily weighted toward China and Mexico. I really am finding the best values
in the "f" symbol stocks. In addition to these five stocks, I own shares in
Tweedy Browne Global Value fund.

These are my strategies to deal with a possible problem with the market.
Position into stocks with limited market risk, go overseas to beat up markets,
and invest in an international value fund.

Interesting point on any valuation (eg. intel)

For the last several quarters its gone on unnoticed (until now by mgmt) that
intel has been growing its work force at substantially faster pace than sales.
Further S,G&A wasn't growing as fast as work force. So I asked where were the
bodies being buried? It seems most of these fixed costs were going into
production and thus COGS. So what's the big deal, you ask? If more and more
fixed costs are going into COGS, the "operating leverage" of Intel rises to
levels not seen since intel small early days. Operating leverage is no
different than financial leverage in that it increases volatility of earnings.
The point I am making is that the predictability in intel's earnings has been
deteriorating for some time. Hence, the continual earnings misses. Intel is
much more susceptible to volume shifts than it has been in a decade. Most
analysts give lower multiples to debt-laden companies for this reason. few tech
analysts have any clue on cyclical industries and why they get lower multiples.
thus they have and continue to miss the point that intel with much higher
operating leverage (hidden in its COGS) is a more cyclical company than ever
before and where it is in cycle deserves much lower multiple!

James:

I wanted to make sure you had heard about FLA's 4:1 split. FLA is up 4-5%
today, was even higher earlier in the day. I still plan to buy FLA, because I
think you are right that St. Joe will almost certainly make another run at FLA.
And FLA is a good company by itself. I wonder if SJP is considering buying FLA
and then selling off both railroads (FEC and Appalachicola), keeping only the
acreage. FEC is no obscure short line. It is in a very unique position with its
Jax-Miami run. The big RR's like Norfolk & Southern would seem to be logical
buyers, but they can't buy it until SJP relinquishes its 54% stake.

But for now, I share your feelings that we are somewhere near a overall market
top. I can't find many stocks to buy that have the margin of safety I need to
buy.

I am about 25% cash right now, and would be around 65% if I could bring myself
to sell my Berkshire Hathaway. That is a tough call--is it worthwhile for the
BRK shareholder to pay an additional premium to own stocks (G, KO, Disney,
etc.) which are already at mind-boggling premiums themselves? The easy answer
is "heck, no", but the other easy answer comes from one glance at Buffett's
history. I think I'll just sit tight with BRK and brace for a few rough years
and try to ignore Mr. Market. Which is quite difficult when Mr. Market is daily
offering you a king's ransom for a piece of the mysterious and wondrous BRK.

In any case, I completely agree with your take on the market. Even if this is
not the top, it seems extremely unlikely that we will see anything like the
gains of recent years over the next 5 or 10 years. And there is so much dumb
money in the market.

Dumb as in: "I'm buying this fund because of it has a good track record (but I
have no clue what it owns)."

I don't mean dumb people, not at all, just dumb money that isn't buying value,
just buying something generic called "stocks".

I think we are in for a hammering, and I think it will probably be a long drawn
out sort of thing over several or many years. I know others disagree strongly
or feel that this is an emotional response, but I agree with you that the signs
of a frothy market are everywhere. Sure, it might go higher, much higher, just
like Japan kept on going thru the roof 10 years ago, but I get jittery when I
feel that much of my portfolio's value is held up more by market froth than by
underlying value.

Sorry such a long post. But you hit a nerve a few days ago, because I was
having the same thoughts at the same time (why else would I spend most of
Saturday comparing real estate plays like FLA SJP TRC & TPL?). The logic behind
your portfolio reallocation made perfect sense to me. Buy low, sell high. What
a unique concept.

By the way (if anyone is still reading this), does anyone have any comments on
TPL (Texas Pacific Land Trust)? This is one weird vehicle, and there is value
here, but will it ever get unlocked?

Andrew: Well I'll give you that if earnings volatility increases, then the
multiple on stock that buyers would be willing to pay could, should, or does
decrease. But you say this volatility is due to increases in cost of goods
sold, specifically hiring people for production. I assume any capital that the
extra people need are counted once in operating leverage (loans to buy
equipment). So you are assuming that production workers are a fixed cost??
Because operating leverage from debt ... that stays mostly fixed (unless
equipment is sold), but workers... they are dismissed all the time. What's the
big deal?
As I read your thread you are saying if Intel hires more people to produce
(more) product, that is a bad thing for shareholders. I agree. We need to find
a way to produce product without people. Or better yet, we need to find
companies with lots of people on the payroll where managers can dismiss them by

Volatility increases with increased fixed cost. volatility increase is not due
to increases in COGS but to shift in mix of things in COGS specifically caused
by increase in employee #. In Intel's instance the huge scope of its increased
fixed costs are being missed by analysts who look solely at S,G&A and R&D
lines. What I was getting at is that the Gross Margin line at Intel is much
more volatile and volume sensitive than in a decade. This only multiplies the
impact of more widely known "operating leverage" factors like S,G&A and R&D.
Note, Operating leverage is NOT financial leverage; operating leverage is above
EBIT line and financial leverage is the I of interest and the impact on T
taxes. If intel had debt volatility would even be worse. But even the laziest
of analysts know to give lower multiple to levered companies
Hiring people to produce more product is not bad. they are just another form of
resource allocation. If they don't produce resulting in slower growth in
product sales than growth in people cost that is very bad. Even in this day and
age of low job safety, additional personnel is a more fixed cost than most give
it credit with salaries, standard bonus, options, fringes, space, eqpt,
support, etc.)

On a bell curve, Intel's gross profit, ebit and net income and eps volatility
has gone way up. The likelyhood of an earnings miss (and in good times a big
earnings surprise) has gone way up. The volatility of intel's options has not
adjusted to this. And since the analyst community has not adjusted expectations
and multiples down for this greater cyclicality of cash flow and earnings,
earnings misses are going to occur way more often than earnings surprises. one
day people will catch on here but not until many lose alot of money.

Re: Volatility (and the collapse of Cendant - totally unrelated)

Paul, I have read enough of your posts, some of which castigated me (which I
loved because you make me think) to make this statement in advance. I am not
arguing with you here, just making a point about an argument you made. I think
you probably would agree with this.

VOLATILITY IS YOUR FRIEND IF YOU ARE A VALUE INVESTOR. The last thing you want
to invest in in this market is a company that cranks out that 10 or 15% growth
every quarter. Those are by definition overvalued. If you have any conviction
of your own intelligence or research ability, what you want as a value investor
is a great business which is volatile. No, that is not an oxymoron. Nike is
one. AMR is another (but DO NOT buy that one now. Buy it a year ago). Sure, it
requires more time and homework to understand the business, but it is very
profitable to buy these things when they are down.

HFS (the company now known as Cendant) was pitched to me MANY times as a one
decision growth stock, and even a value stock. And it got WHACKED yesterday on
one mistake. I never took it seriously because it looked like a Ponzi scheme to
me. If their stock price was high, sure, they could acquire companies with
lower P/Es and produce EPS growth. But that is eventually a fools game. As the
Wall Street Journal article said today, Cendant's collapse (this was a $30
BILLION company Wednesday which is now a 15 billion company) really makes you
question Nationsbank among others.

As an institutional value investor, I had calls yesterday telling me that
Cendant has $21 worth of "real value". From firms that had strong buys on the
stock at 40 and holds at 19. The phone calls were kind of fun. Make them go
through their argument as to why the stock is worth $21. Then ask why they had
a strong buy on it at 40 and a hold on it at 19. Thats fun for a value
investor. Growth investors would call it sadistic.

Re: how and when to protect ourselves

The best recent book on the subject is called "The Bear
Book" by Rothschild. Though a bit repetitive in the
middle, it is a quick read and gives plenty of ideas about
what to do should you expect a bear. Since I agreed
with most everything in the book, of course I liked it.

Where to go? Dividend-paying consumer staples.
Asia - he tells us which countries don't correlate with
the US (Korea, Japan are two). Cash. MO. What to
get out of? Latin America/Mexico. Cyclicals. There's
lots of ideas.

If you have an opinion on whether it will be a deflationary
or an inflationary bear, then there are other options.
Obviously, zero coupons for the former. The pros/cons
of gold are discussed.

There's a lot of history in the book, enough to steel
up those of us taking the bearish position.

What am I doing? A lot of what's in the book. The
book helped accelerate an action that I already started -
moving funds out of US equities and into Asia and cash. I'm
doing that a variety of ways. It also turned me onto
the Prudent Bear Fund, which sells stocks short.
Obviously it has not done well, but for a fund that
has been short the last few years, I'm impressed it hasn't
gone under.

Another book with a different view is 'Market Magic' by Louise Yamada, a market
analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. She likens the current market to the bull
market of '42 to '66. This bull started in '82 according to her analysis and
could keep going - even from where its at now. One reason with both positive
and negative implications is the global scope of larger US corporations. She
thinks we might have a two tier market one - the larger, international
corporation - the other domestically oriented corporations and industries.
Because the international corporations will benefit from the increasing markets
in developing countries they are leading the drive to new highs on a regular
basis. And she says past indicators of market valuation may be have to be
rethought if in fact the international factors are prevailing.

I find her arguments very clear and supported by many different facts - mostly
time series such as DJIA behavior, S&P 500 behavior versus the dollar,
inflation, interest rates, advance/decline ratios, etc.
Haven't completed it yet; however, it offers a view that could be further
discussed here.

James, TPL has not changed since you looked at it. There is no catalyst (a la
SJP) in sight. It can be volatile at times due to very small float and oil
correlation. I think this is one to glance at every six months from a value
point of view. But it will probably never be a value+growth story like SJP.

I'm not sure why TPL management doesn't work to sell more of their land, but
they are waiting for civilization to reach them.

That's what gets me. It's as if every 30-40 years, people judge
the generation two generations above them as somehow
dumber. The idea is, we're smarter now. Whether it's infotech
change, graying demographics, globalization, or
portfolio insurance, bull markets create excuses for a populace that
wishes to have greater tolerance for higher valuation levels.
Yet bear markets happen anyway.

Re: a book from a brokerage insider, I can't imagine that
it would be bearish. Nothing could be more antagonistic
to the brokerage's purpose than a bearish book. Of course,
at least she makes the comparison from 42 to 66. I wonder
why she didn't bring it all the way up to 71- when the bull
really finally started to crack. Is she implying that it's ok because
we have a few more years left?

The Bear Book has some revealing inflation-adjusted statistics for the
"buy and hold" cult. Obviously, if you buy and hold Microsoft early
in a bull, no problem. But buying and holding "the next Microsofts" is
much more troublesome, even if you aren't dealing with a market
that is historically too rich. And the rich markets of the late 60's and
late 20's brought >15 years of losses to those that bought
and held within two years prior to the peak.

It is shockingly revealing to me at least that Disney went from
the 60s to 6. But it seems most people today think, "how stupid
of those people to not buy it at 6," and hence miss the point
entirely.

Re: the advance/decline line, I wonder about is usefulness now.
When stocks go up because more money is being forced into
the market rather than because valuations are attractive, I would
expect the A/D line to be more a reactor than a predictor.

Re: interest rates, could it be any more perfect? Could the
dollar be any stronger? Could the threat
of inflation be any less remote? Of course it looks perfect. Stocks
are well above the level before the Asian crisis because
of this. So should we shoot for 30X earnings - that's only another
10-15% on the market. Or should we prepare for a retracement
to 5-10 X earnings, as history shows us can happen soon after
perfection is attained?

I'm more inclined to do the latter, but of course to each his own.

The value of Intel is difficult for me. If character of a company effects value
then Intels character is well documented by the Judges opinion in the Integraph
Lawsuit which is worth reading:

http://www.intergraph.com/intel/order.htm

This opinion also shows however that Intels products are now becoming more
proprietary and how difficult it is to compete especially with the chip sets,
buses, sockets and graphics all needing compatibiltiy and the cost and time to
develop all of this so Intel may well have a lock. As to lower tech chips, how
long before the low end boxes and other TV devices etc need high tech chips to
handle all the requirements of voice and video etc.And Intel has most of the
Fabs/production and the proprietary designs of all these chips and subsystems.
With 6 month product time and capital required it will be hard to compete. But
then the NT 5 is supposed to be designed to work with the Alpha but DEC
indicated that Alpha Machine sales are down another 4%.I thnk Analyst estimates
for INTC therefor are wild guesses. The value of intel arises for me because in
May the 2001 leaps become available and if INTC stay in the low 70s one could
i.e. sell a $100 put and get about $28 a share right away.But if you are right
and MPUs go the way of DRAMS then...And if INTCs customers and others can break
the INTEL Lock and Planned Lock of Merced then...I am sure if they could they
would based on no love for Intel. CPQ may be thinking ahead this way once it
gets control of Alpha with the NT5 OS.One cansee why Intel keeps investing in
other companies such as the graphics designer Chips and TEch etc.I'll probably
pass on these puts but it is hard to forecast I think where this is all going"
a year or two ahead.

Mike: Well maybe it's time again for the thread to hear another of my shooting
dice analogies.

Playing the stock market is very close to shooting dice. And I don't mean the
media comparison equating gambling to stock investing. Forget that. I don't
mean that at all.

It's all about the similarities of what goes on in the gambler's head and in
the investor's head. Because the behaviors - responses to stimulli -- are very,
very similar. We can learn a lot about how to invest from studying how people
behave at the dice table. In this case, how might one behave when one KNOWS
that one's money is going to be lost?

Take a long- very long- winning streak at the table. This ocurrs when numbers -
4,5,6,8,9,10 are being rolled but there's no occurrence of a 7. The money is
piling up on the table - bets are getting bigger and bigger, the table is very
crowded. Everyone is in a good mood. But EVERYONE knows at some time a 7 will
be rolled. When this 7 shows (i.e.the shooter sevens out)all bets will be
losers (except "don't pass" players who are equivalent to our short sellers)-
the players (investors who are long) will lose all the money on the table. All
they will have left are the chips in front of them (= our investors' cash) that
they didn't bet (have invested). Some people even know that a seven shows on
average once in 6 rolls of the dice, so to not see a 7 in 20 or 30, or 40 rolls
of the dice is very unusual. The rareness of the occurrence though, this
everybody knows. Maybe a long roll like this (Dow = 9000)might happen only once
or a few times to a gambler (investor). As the roll continues, more and more
numbers being made (Dow going to 9500), what are gamblers doing with their
chips (money) that maybe investors ought also to be considering?

1. Some gamblers will have raised their bets early in the roll to a maximum
amount they will commit. This is what the good gambling books recommend (ref:
How to Win by Mike Goodman, Casino Gambling for the Winner (Stewart), Big Julie
of Vegas(Linn) others.). These people will have thought through what they are
going to do if that great roll occurs while they are at the table.
That would mean for an investor (who has more time to think about what's
happening) - no increasing investments - new 401k money goes to cash or equiv.,
no increase in margin, or throwing money into stocks greater in amounts that
was done in '97 or maybe '96. No making wild-eyed investments (like getting
sucked into poor bets only because they seem to be paying off.)
The idea is that as the numbers roll in, the winnings are withdrawn. It's the
amount of chips in front of you not played that count now --- because the
amounts on the table will be history. The good gambler (investor) will always
have cash to play another day. The purpose is to make and keep an adequate but
optimized return. The intent is not to break the casino bank (which I equate to
trying to make Wade Cook change-your-life investments -g-).

2. Some people will reduce the amounts of their bets. A maybe obvious choice
given that we KNOW a 7 will show and all wagers will be lost. Not a tactic used
by good gamblers or good stock (value) players though IMO. Because dice have no
memory - numbers can go on and on, the market can go higher and higher, and you
want (I think, my opinion) to be in a position to capture gains while you can.
Reducing the absolute amount played (invested) is a retreat and loss of the
courage it took to get to the betting (investing) level that was achieved, IMO.

3. A very,very few people will start to make offset bets (start to go short)-
after all... a 7 MUST show. These people IMO either seem to bet against
themselves or worse, fail to make any kind of worthwhile return on their bets
(shorting detracts from profiting from going long). Also, this is not a tactic
recommended by any gambling book with which I am familiar, nor is it
recommended by any classic investing book (Buffett/Graham/Fisher) I believe.

In any case, no experienced gambler will gather his/her chips in the middle of
the roll and just walk away (Go from 100+% invested to 0%). Not to cash out,
and certainly not to start at another game. The events occurring at the winning
dice table (Dow 9500)are too rare to be ignored or to be dismissed so readily.

Especially as everyone else is screaming to get in on the action -g-.

My own investing pattern right now mirrors my own gambling pattern on these
long rolls. I'm long stocks and long cash. I generally am increasing my
investments but at a smaller and smaller rate. Currently I have more money
invested than I ever have. But I always try to take some and play some.
Although my cash is at its lowest % level in several years, the absolute amount
is at the high range.
FWIW, Paul.

Thanks Mike. The Bear Book. That sounds right up my alley now. I'll see if I
can find it on Amazon.

I had an interesting conversation with a relative at my wedding. This guy
always asks me for advice, but I should be asking him. He had 1/3 of his
portfolio in Lucent since the spin-off and hasn't sold a share. Also bought
Intel at the '96 low and held (a triple, despite the last year's performance)
and has a huge gain in Compaq.

He asked me what are you buying. And I said nothing. He looked at me like "you
can't be serious", and then I got him scared by telling him I am on a gradual
buy deliberate "sell everything thats not nailed down" strategy. The the
question I always get:

"Ah, you're expecting a correction" (meaning 10% down, then buy it back for
larger gains). And I said no, I'm not. That really confused him. So I told him
a little bit about what the market looked like in 1968-70, and what it looked
like in 1974.

I did not advise him to sell. He has huge taxable gains and you have to have
the conviction yourself. You don't do something like that based on "tips" and I
would not want him to because I could be very wrong. All I wanted to do was
shake him up a little and make him think.

And as for this "throw out the old rules of valuation" stuff. The only rule I
have is Ben Graham. An asset cannot trade indefinitely for more than its worth.
To decide what something is worth, you certainly need to go far beyond
multiples. I know a lot of ways to value companies, from the most conservative
to the most generous. What I refuse to do is value companies based on "relative
multiples" - i.e. since Citibank trades at 4 times book value so should Chase.
But after doing my valuation on a business, I just go back to that simple rule.
For two years now I have found undervalued businesses in an overvalued market.
I still can, though its difficult. But if the market breaks down, those will
collapse too. Don't kid yourself that your stocks will be safe. Go back and
look at some charts of the early 70s. Nothing survived.

James,

Except for a few choice US stocks, I am considering getting
out of most us stocks and moving to foreign stocks. That
won't win me any buy and hold awards, but that is not my
aim. I have spent the last few days looking overseas and
I am convinced that several of the bear markets abroad are
presenting some excellent opportunities. I already have Telebras,
Deswell, APF. But I'm thinking of a more wholesale switch
to go where the value is.

As you suggest, it is unrealistic to believe that US value stocks
won't get hit just as hard as the rest of the market in a true
bear. My short strategy is less appealing than simply moving
overseas and continuing to play the long side. The extraordinary
strength of the dollar can only help
overseas investment, as it will eventually tumble.

I know a few like your relative. Two or three stocks and they've tripled their
money without even thinking about it. Like I said, it's too
easy for me to be comfortable. Hey, I'm walking scared. But I'm
building it to a jog. Maybe in a few weeks I can get to a run.

From:James Clarke

Paul, thanks for the thoughtful post - it made me think - but the analogy has a
fatal flaw. Rolling dice is purely random. The odds of a seven are exactly the
same whether the last five rolls were sevens or if there hasn't been a seven in
forty rolls.

But in the market, if you are thinking in the long term, the "odds" are related
to price moves. After 40 rolls without a seven (i.e. the market trading at 27
times earnings), a "seven" (interest rates increase, Clinton gets impeached, or
any number of other things that could happen) has devastating consequences.
After five straight sevens (check out where stocks traded in the 1970s), the
market trades at 10 times earnings, and one more seven doesn't really hurt you.
That's the way the game is played at this table. Which means cashing out when
you're happy has to be an option.

To refine that analysis a little more, in Vegas, the behavior of the other
betters is irrelevant. The odds of a seven are the same. You are essentially
still playing against the house and against the dice whether there is one other
guy at the table or ten guys betting $1000 a roll. But in stocks, the behavior
of other investors is critically important. Because you are "betting" on THEIR
behavior, even if you buy a stock that is reasonably valued. You are certainly
betting on other bettors behavior if you buy an internet stock today. And at
the table, what is a seven is pretty clear. Its either a seven or it isn't.
When you play the stock market game, the question "what is a seven?" changes
with the multiple. Cendant traded at 50 times earnings and announced horrible
news and got cut in half. Harnischfeger traded at 10 times earnings and
announced horrible news last week and the stock dropped about 5%.

Just some food for thought.

Hi James, thanks for your reply. Yes, Vegas is not quite the same thing as you
point out. But players' attitudes and responses are interesting because as the
good roll gets longer and longer (more and more money is being won), the volume
of play, the amounts played, and the enthusiasm of the players, all seem
similar to the euphoria and behavior I see with the DJ or S&P hitting new
highs. And the gambling outcome is obvious - the only question is when. And
that is what people are saying also about investing now -- the good times are
going to come to an end. And in the past, it's often not ended well for the
players (or for observers - ala the economic declines which affect everyone and
which might also occur concomitantly (I was just waiting to use that word -g-)
with the market decline)

If as you indicate, market pricing depends on believing that other people will
be committing to buying stocks to take them off sellers' hands - and I believe
that this is so (someone has to be around and willing to buy my stocks when
they reach fair value -g-) - then why are people so sure that stocks are at a
peak as they concurrently bemoan the fact that more and more people are coming
into the market and making ever riskier investments? Isn't this all grist that
will push stocks even higher?
For me, the answer is I don't see any bullish sentiment. On this thread, I
would call it cautious at best. I can't believe - don't believe - the Economist
article in Crimi earlier post which says (I think) Merrill is encouraging
people to up the percent committed to stocks. My full service broker, my
discount broker, VL, everything I see, all say reduce or, if buying, buy to
hold. Yes, we've got excesses - Tokyo Joes, beer-drinking Harvard psychologists
with 2 year track records now stock experts,etc.--but mostly people are very,
very cautious and worried. That's what I think I'm hearing you say also about
your professional colleagues.
So from this sentiment standpoint, maybe the market peaks are close at hand as
all who can, slowly walk to the exit doors. -g- Paul.

not all analysts have missed my point. The analysts who have observed the
greater fixed cost in intel's production stream have quietly gone to other
stocks or don't bang the drum on intel for the many other reasons its
overvalued (eg. tom kurlak - merrill lynch). Bottom line there is higher
volatility in fundamental cash flow of intel deserving lower multiple at
cyclical peak (as cycles are made bigger). This is cyclical peak for intel and
thus its a sell not a buy.

Please don't take offense if I could add I think you are also being a bit naive
to seemingly imply a high level of objectivity and for that matter integrity in

Well, I'm catching the "cautious and worried" theme. So I'm making some
portfolio changes too.

Sold out UCR at market open (luckily)as UCR says something about they are not
filing for bankuptcy. Sure looks like they might be getting prepared for this
contingency though (as they probably prudently should). I've been alerted, and
now I am acting. Company and stock may do just fine - in or out of bankruptcy.
I just lost my confidence, and I am taking my profits.

Sold a portion of SFLX (unluckily at the open). I think Paul K. got...upset...
after his close reading of what may be happening to this stock. (He's the de
facto guru on the thread and an occasional poster here.) This caused me to
reevaluate my own position; I just think I own too much (compared to other
stocks in my portfolio), and this causes me to become too concerned with the
company and it's poor stock performance (losses from my initial buy points). So
I've cleared out those initial buys.

Buying MMO. Monarch Machine. It's in a very dull (-g- uh... that's supposed to
be a pun) and prosaic business. I've always liked the metal benders I've dealt
with, and Monarch supplies some of the tools these people use. MMO has
excellent, excellent management. How else can you describe managers who are
able to lose money (negative earnings), year after year after year after year
... and yet they are able to keep the company in business (that's iffy too IMO)
and more important (-g-), themselves still on the payroll? Got to be a heck of
a management team. LOL.
Anyway, for some strange reason, they apparently have decided they intend to
become profitable (Why change now? LOL). They are actually taking some steps to
do this by selling off some unprofitable lathe making subsidiaries. (For you
electronic guys/gals - a lathe is a contrivance used in machine shops (and
these places still exist!) -g-). The financials look terrible to me (except
maybe psr) - (but I don't claim to be an expert financial analyst either). The
stock is selling below book value (8 below 12). No big deal though. This stock
is ALWAYS selling below book -gg--. My idea is that if the Japanese haven't
killed them off by now (Japanese are powerful in computer controlled machines),
and the stock is near its lows, and managers are serious about changing (which
they seem to be--there's some insider buying), I am going to spin (that's
another pun -g-) with them too. LOL.

Also taking a position in RDO Equipment (RDO). Here too, it's a management play
but based on what the owner/controlling stockholder can do. Some people think
he has a good record in this business. RDO sells/leases/rents farm and
construction equipment. Company has not been public long, price is kind of
expensive (but near its lows), hard for me to get comparables that I'm
comfortable with. But the business model looks okay. Well capitalized to have
product available in smaller towns (yes, I know --that's where the farms
generally are -g-), acquisitive and apparently aggressive management with
opportunities to consolidate smaller players, possible benefit from increased
construction spending. It's worth it to me to take a small position in this
company to see what the top guy can do.

For what it's all worth.... Paul

What I find interesting during the bearish posts to the thread is that the

initiated coverages. Looks like it's 10,000 DOW and 2,000 NASDAQ by mid-summer.

Anybody for average PE's of 40?

Over the past 15 months I've been on the thread, when it stops posting stocks
for consideration and gets bearish, it's usually an indicator that no one can
find anything worth buying, the market is overpriced, and a correction is soon
to come.

What's interesting is that if you use the dividend discount
model to value stocks, the current low rate environment
gives absurd discount rates that results in even more
absurd "valuations." Nevertheless, these absurd valuations
are being reached, essentially bringing many stocks in
the market to the 5% expected return range, in line with
money market funds. Heck, even the Travelers/Citicorp
merger looks like it gives less than a 5% return on investment.
So not only are individual investors paying the absurd prices
for stocks, but the companies themselves are acquiring
other companies at these insane prices - in stock transactions, of
course.

I do own businesses I like, and I will leg out of them and into
India, Japan, South Korea and other markets that have been
absolutely crushed. But I cannot justify selling at the current
prices. Tricon at 33, Ciena at 48, Hewlett Packard at 67 - these I can
sell, but not until they show weakness, and they all showed
relative strength in today's down market. Deswell at 19, Telebras at
120, BMC at 19, Applix at 6, St Joe at 33, Hyde at 5, Elamex
at 7 - these are clogging my portfolio with longs, and I have no
good reason to sell no matter any weakness they may show.

The Prudent Bear Fund, the Nike short, and initial positions
in the Morgan Stanley Asia Pacific Fund and the India Fund
are the starting points for my US bear strategy.
I'll likely buy more of the India Fund and initiate a position in
the Korea Fund soon.

I already sold off a 88% long US stock/12% cash IRA portfolio,
moving the money into 33% dividend stocks, 20% small caps,
33% cash, 15% emerging market debt, and 15% Japan/Asia.
I just made these moves Monday.

Yep, I'm bearish. I even started a "Bear!" thread here
on SI if anyone is interested. Long candidates I like are
of course Swisher, Adaptec, Jones Medical @ ~26, but
I just can't bring myself to initiate more US longs right now.
