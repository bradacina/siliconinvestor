I've used that Costco Amex for a while. I get 5% back on gas, 3 on restaurants,
etc. but that is changing. Yesterday a letter announced that the gas rebate
will be reduced to 4% in 3 months. It must make a difference when you applied
for the card. The rebate is only on gasoline purchases up to $6000. You receive
a credit voucher to use at Costco in February each year. MP

I have Fidelity Amex that gives 2% cash back off everything, which is a great
deal IMO. However, I don't expect this to last forever even though it is not an
intro deal. You have to have Fido account to get an offer (and cash back goes
to Fido account too).

BTW, it seemed to me that lately Amex is very aggressive in replacing
Mastercard and Visa in branded credit cards. A lot of offers I get is Amex
this-or-that. I also seem to have received a lot of Visas to replace my old
bank-branded MCs. I wonder if MC is not doing that well compared to Visa. Amex
of course is still the 3rd place runner, but it is much more aggressive in
pushing its brand compared to Discover who tried it years ago.

OT - the FIDO card rebate has been reduced for new account holders, i believe

FWIW the rebates and benefits are going downhill. I have a Amex Simplycash
Business card that had a 5% gas rebate and 3% on some other stuff (Cellphone
bills, some tickets) and 1% on everything else and the gas rebates are reduced
to 3%.

I also believe that Visa is doing much better job at marketing and should be

I sold my GE, IMOS for major losses. I also sold ULTR (Thanks to those for

I did buy AWK this week. I've studied some of the water stocks that you hold,
Paul and the one I've been buying is HOO. Page 7 of the investor Presentation
visually details the unique niche it holds in the sector which I find very
appealing. The company is also very inexpensive on a PE basis yet has
significantly grown their earnings on a nine month basis. (Page 20)

gcrispin: My comments, fwiw:

I can't figure GE. So complex, can anybody, really? At current price, maybe
still more short than buy, I am guessing.

Looking back, I see you've liked these waste utilities, and have done well with
them --WMI, RSG, etc. Sorry I missed that sector completely at stocks lows.

PRSC way too tough for me at a scan of it. More sale than buy, it looks like to
me, bwdik.

GFRE, CNOA, CHFI, and SNEN. I have GFRE. The other three I can't get enough
info at a scan to understand. So I'll pass unless others here provide more
info.

I am hoping the sales overhang with AWK is disappearing - at least for a while
- with the recent stock offering. I have a gtc order in to buy more low 17. I
didn't and don't expect it to drop back again to Spekulatius' under $17
buy-more price. I do note June 2 insider buy (I call it substantial for a
utility person) at $16.70-$16.80.

Not much to add to the conversation about HOO. HOO first mentioned here by EKS.
Spekulatius followed up with some positives. Imo, you either see HOO and want
it, or you don't. To me, it became and still is, an obvious buy. I started
buying at $3.76 and added as stock fell. The big question for me, and more so
now that I have more shares - is just how much risk (position size in
portfolio) am I willing to take with HOO, a company which only has a few years
of public history? We are talking about a dink company that has to have people
adept and astute enough to manage geographically dispersed operations with both
technical and political components. (Other issues too, e.g. a British company
so earnings in pounds thus there's the exchange rate to consider. Smaller
issues to me though.) I am still weighing all this as I consider adding more to
my still small position.

Anializer - what do you think about RF. Trading at 1/2 tangible book. They
recently raised a bunch on secondary @4$ and with a debt exchange. I think they
will have 1.3B shares outstanding when it's all done. That should be enough to
keep them afloat even in a bad economy and still,be well capitalized. The
government stress test gives me some confidence that the number are reasonable.
They can make 1.5B$ in earnings in a decent economy, so that is more than
1.2$/share earnings power - not too bad for a 4$ stock. I got a few shares only
at this point but I think I'll average down if they go towards 3$/share.

Based on a review of all the recent news, stress test results, lawsuit

inclination would be to wait a while before averaging in or taking an initial
position. It happened to me before where I take a position in these low priced
stocks only to watch them erode another 30% or more before finally bottoming.
Don't like holding thru that and the backdrop of news not all that encouraging.

I'm not sure how you came up with your numbers on tangible book post dilution,
but I suppose without making alot of assumptions it pays to wait and see the
new balance sheet that reflects the additional shares. Just my cursory thoughts
based on a 30 minute look at it. As always my approach could be too cautious
though. Ideally I like value with earnings more than value with losses but
occasionally a money losing company can turn it around.

Some interesting developments with Centerpoint Energy Inc. (CNP) and the
Haynesville Shale discovery (touted as the largest natural gas field in the
continental U.S).

There Will Be Gas
Forbes.com
Jesse Bogan, 06.05.09, 07:00 PM EDT
Welcome to northwest Louisiana, where natural gas is flowing, property prices
are popping and not everyone is happy.

http://www.forbes.com/2009/06/05/natural-gas-haynesville-shale-business-energy-
aynesville.html?partner=yahootix

From the article: "...Johnson says the pipeline infrastructure is full, though
help is on the way from Energy Transfer Partners ( ETP - news - people ) and
<u>CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission</u>. Additionally, he says, pressure
decline rates aren't yet known. "The oldest producing Haynesville Shale well is
probably just a year old at best. That isn't enough time," he says. "Everybody
is trying to put pie in the sky, but you don't know what the pie is."..."
================================================================

In this case too much of a good thing is positive for CNP. The development of
the Haynesville Shale fields assures CNP 100% utilization of their pipeline
infrastructure. CNP makes their money not on the daily rates for NG but how
much gas they move through their pipelines.

Energy Transfer Partners L.P. (ETP) ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=ETP ) may
be one to look at too, but they are not cheap. Selling near their 52 week high,
and towards the higher end of the sector PE range at 12, they are poised to
benefit from the future growth from the development of the Haynesville Shale
fields. ETP pays a nice dividend of $3.58 per year or about 8.20% annual yield.
Analysts peg their 2010 annual earnings between $3.30/share and $4.78/share.
The company carries a lot of debt too. If their earnings come up short, their
dividend will be cut and their huge debt will continue to loom over their head
(especially for future capital investment projects).

I continue to add to my CNP as I consider it a lower risk and better value play
than ETP. Both companies carry far too much debt but CNP seems to be better
diversified in their pipeline assets and other business segments.

RE: Highest Yielding Gas Utility Stocks

I took the stocks posted from the link provided on the previous page for
<u>Highest Yielding Gas Utility Stocks </u>, and selected those with a PE of 10
or less.

I sorted this list by those that have moved least-to-most from their yearly low
to arrive at the table below:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?s=FE,ED,AEP,SCG,LNT,CNP,AEE,UIL,EIX,DTE,SE,BKH&d=
8

All my new buys in this sector appear in this list: They include SCG, CNP, SE
and BKH. I would like to add others in this group as many still look to be
undervalued. Many have advanced more than 30% from their yearly low and still
trade at a PE of less than 10.

Perhaps I will screen further based on those that are selling at the extreme to
their 8 year PE mean value and see if any pop out. Paul has been successful in
buying these over sold issues and waiting for a reversion to the long term mean
PE value.

Hi Paul -

I briefly looked at AEE and do not like their electrical power fuel mix. Their
power plants operated by their different subsidiaries (both regulated & non
regulated) fuel type ranges from 85%-100% coal with nuclear making up from
0%-15% and NG & Other less than 1%. (Note: The company has five operating
subsidiaries 4 regulated: Ameren, Missouri,CILCO & EEI and one non regulated:
Genco)

The company has already set aside monies for the proposed carbon tax credits
and according to their annual report will require significantly more dollars to
be set aside w/o any detail as to how they plan to recover these expenses (ie
higher rates?).

The one positive I see is they plan to double their nuclear electricity output
by building a 2nd generation unit on the site where their one active plant is
now producing. No regulatory papers have been filed and the earliest it could
come online is 2018.

Even though the company has had good growth over the last five years both EPS %
and Dividend % have been negative.
(data from Reuters:
http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/financialHighlights?symbol=AEE.N )
<pre>
Growth
1 Year 3 Years 5 Years
Sales % 3.66 4.96 11.21
EPS % -3.36 -2.72 -1.72
Dividend % -39.37 -15.36 -9.52 </pre>
Perhaps with PE expansion and reversion to a higher PE mean value based on the
past consumption of coal w/o carbon tax credits, the company could be seen as
slightly undervalued. However with the unknown treatment of the carbon tax
issues, I will stay away from this one.

There are many other "hybrid" utilities that utilize a higher percentage of NG
which to me provides a cleaner and cheaper operating cost per MW (based on
current NG prices) than coal.

Also, I agree with you on utilities located in Michigan and even Ohio (to a
lesser extent). These utility companies could very well be at the same prices
3-4 years out as overall electricity usage contracts and per share earnings
(and dividend payouts) shrink. This may be a region to look at in 24-36 months
but not now.

need to sell shares to take a loss then you cannot buy any shares for 31 days
prior to the time you anticipate selling shares in the same company or you will

A book on managing a portfolio for tax consequences. Well, if you're going to

selling and buying back to an extent where it's trading that affects the
portfolio. So maybe a book on trading that deals with taxes. I've no
suggestions for that. Interested to see what suggestions others might have.

For value investing, where there comes a point that the stock should be sold,
and that might be within a year (short-term gain vs. long-term), again I do not
know of a book that offers tactics/strategies that go beyond the general stuff:
consider taking losses to offset gains, short-term losses are "better" than
long-term losses for write-offs, carry-overs, etc.

it seems to me that is highly advantagious to take the short term losses as
opposed to hoping that the stock will eventually come back assuming that I have
short term profits to offset against them. This allows me to avoid paying taxes
on the gain entirely whereas holding on to the a short term loss puts one in
the arena of "two in the bush". Im just trying to avoid the unpleasantness of
inadvertantly entering into a wash sale and having the irs coming back to me
years later denying the offset and hitting me up for penalties and interest. So
it seems to me that cost of being wrong in such a matter is fairly significant.
I wonder if gainskeeper is good for keeping one aware of potential wash sales.
POsco and aib are acting really well today. Hope this is the start of something
big as opposed to a blow off top. I have no idea which.

Did you notice after the 30year bond auction today (
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aTxJD2uhydvg ) that the
utility Index took off higher.

S&P up 1.23%
Dow Jones Utility Index up 2.75%

I wonder if the DJU index will converge to the S&P Index like it did in
January? If it does, there is at least a 10% move to be seen for the utility
index with the S&P staying at current levels.

Treasuries Rise as Bonds Yield Most at an Auction Since 2007
June 11 (Bloomberg) --
"...Treasuries gained as the highest yield on a 30-year U.S. bond auction in
almost two years attracted investors concerned that record government spending
and debt sales will lead to inflation. The bonds drew a yield of 4.72 percent
at the auction, the highest since August 2007. Benchmark 10-year note yields
reached 4 percent earlier for the first time since October ...".

I noticed almost all the utility stocks I follow were up and are up now. (POR
and HOO are my reds.) And I did notice too, the utility stocks are up stronger
(bigger percent) than the DJIA.

Seems like the market in general was up - is what I attributed it to. I forgot
about the bond auction and didn't make its connection to utilities.

Nice short squeeze in the XLU happening. Cup and handle breakout on the daily
chart. And a move above the 20dma on a weekly. According to option monster,
folks are buying the Sep 28 calls and selling the Sep 24 puts to finance the
transaction. This news was from yesterday....following through in today's
action. 27.72-73 is the buy point. Resistance at 28.44 the 200dma. The move
today puts XLU firmly above the 150dma.

The Bloomberg video lays out the fundamentals very nicely.

This is true to some extent:

"cannot buy any shares for 31 days prior to the time you anticipate selling
shares"

You can buy shares and sell those same shares at a profit while still holding
your original shares. I recently did this with a trading stock that I should
have sold for a small loss but was asleep at the wheel and it ballooned.
Problem being that I wanted to be in the stock, and still am.

Bought 2k more, and flipped for .50 two days later. Sent an email to Ameritrade
that I was selling the lot I just bought. A "versus purchase" in their lingo.
And here I thought it was just designated shares. gg

Their reply:

"We have received your versus purchase instructions and acknowledge your

Please be advised that Form 1099-B reflects solely those gross proceeds

Yes Gainskeeper does keep track of potential wash sales. It also lets you know
when stocks are within 45 days of going from short to long term and also what
they call potential double down candidates which is described below. I copied
it right from Gainskeeper.

To use the strategy you should:
1. Purchase an equal number of shares for each investment you still wish to
hold
2. Wait 31 days to avoid wash sales
3. Sell your original investment
In 31 days, you will be left with the same stake in your investments, and you
will have recognized a large loss for tax purposes.

My opinion (I'm not qualified to give any tax advice though) is this: It's not
that you can't buy or sell the same security within 30 days: the security can
be bought and sold at anytime. It's the case where there is a loss on the sale
and the stock bought back in 30 days that the wash rule applies. There's no
wash rule to worry about with a gain.

If you have several lots, you can tell your broker which lot you want to sell.
(Otherwise FIFO applies.) This is helpful to either increase or decrease your
gain or your loss on the sale -- depending on what you want to do. And if you
have stock bought over a year ago, and another lot bought within the past 12
months, by choosing to allocate which lot you want to sell, you can control
whether the gain or the loss is either long-term or short-term. There's no way
of avoiding the wash rule though by allocating among lots, if you have a loss
on sale and a buyback of the stock within 30 days.

The iffy/questionable thing (to me) is if you have the same security in both
taxable and non-taxable accounts. Some people say if you sell a stock out of
your taxable account for the loss (remember, if it was sold at a gain, there's
no wash-sale issue) and if you immediately bought it back in your non-taxable
account, then you would or could avoid the wash sale rule. I don't do this
because I'm not convinced of this way of avoiding wash sales, but I do not
know.

There's some other complicated stuff too, most too esoteric for me. Wash sale
applies I believe to a short sale, where the short is covered at a loss, then
reshorted within 30 days. Also some things with options that apply.

And of course this is for USA tax filers. Other countries, other laws.

One thing I have found very very helpful to me is seeing my results of
year-over-year numbers for short term (under a year)performance vs. long term
performance (more than 12 months)

That is, on the tax forms there is the calculation of net short term gains or
losses (adding up all the gains and losses made in the year for sales of stocks
held less than 12 months) and a calculation of net long-term gains or losses
(for stock held longer than 12 months).

Somewhere in the 1990's I believe I noticed that there were many years where I
had net long term gains, but losses or smaller profits when I netted out my
short-term sales. Then I began to notice I would have years where I might have
really substantial long-term gains (net of long-term losses) yet at the same
time experience a net short-term loss. (That loss though being smaller than my
net long-term gain) jGoing back maybe 20 years, there has never been a year for
me where my net short term gains exceeded my net long term gains. There have
been years where I've had net long-term losses, but these were less than the
net short-term losses I sustained.

In other words, for me, whether unconsciously - the way I buy or sell or the
way I'm willing or unwilling to make or hold short-term buys-, I have found
from my annual tax filings that if I report capital gains, they invariably are
either solely or substantially from net long-term gains and NOT from short-term
holdings. Apparently for me, for whatever reason, trading (under 12 month
buying and selling) just has not and does not work.

It was an important reveal.

Of course, knowing this about my past results makes me even more attuned now to
going for a +12 month holding and less willing to speculate for profits using
short-term trades.

re aib:

from yahoo poster:

AIB bond exchange to boost capital:

Shares in Allied Irish Banks rose by over 9 per cent in Dublin this morning
after it announced a plan to exchange up to €2.7 billion worth of perpetual
bonds for a new bonds in a move that may improve its core tier 1 capital by up
to 10 per cent.

At 9.30am AIB shares were trading at €2.17, a gain of 9.3 per cent and bringing
the share price to levels last seen in early January. At this share price the
bank has a market capitalisation of €1.9 billion, some €200 million behind Bank
of Ireland.

Under the proposal AIB is to bid for up to €2.7 billion across six petpetual
bonds and is offering a premium over their current value.

Because these bonds do not have a specified maturity date and are outside the
Government guarantee they are trading at a significant discount estimated to be
up to 35 per cent of face value.

Although AIB has set different prices for each bond, on average investors will
be offered around 50 cent in the euro.

AIB said it will set the interest rates for its new bonds on June 22nd and
until then the precise level of potential benefit to the bank remains unclear.

In a note to investors Bloxham Stockbrokers said this morning it had previously
said ”AIB could benefit to the tune of €700 million to €800 million from a
hybrid buyback which would have provided a 10 per cent boost to existing core
equity tier 1 capital of €7.7 billion”.

According to Bloxham if a price of 44 cent was assumed and a take-up rate of 50
per cent achieved, “the net benefit to capital could be over €750 million”.

Goodbodys said in a note to investors that if it is assumed that bond holders
were happy to accept prices similar to that offered by Bank of Ireland that the
take-up as a percentage of the amount of the securities outstanding was the
same “it would realise a pre-tax profit of €910 million for AIB, adding 68
basis points to its equity tier 1 ratio.”

BTW citi put its sell call on aib on 2/26/09 the stock is probably up 600%
since that call. and now up another 6% in europe.

For all the fuss about wash sales, I have never seen anyone on SI post about
having their trades audited. For small investors and traders, what the IRS
might gain wasting time checking your accounts just isn't worth it.

This is especially true if you take a loss then buy back the stock in an IRA, a
no-no under the law but in practice, the IRS would have to get your IRA trading

Firstenergy Corp. (FE)( http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=FE ) is a possible
value play which was up over 7% this week. I think a buy in a price range
between $37-$38 might be a good entry point dor a starter position.

Generation system

FirstEnergy's subsidiaries operate 18 power plants with a total system capacity
of more than 14,200 megawatts. Of the total generation capacity,

* 56% (7,932 megawatts) is produced using coal
* 28% (3,945 megawatts) comes from nuclear plants
* 11% (1,599 megawatts) is fueled by natural gas or oil
* 5% (796 megawatts) comes from pumped- storage/hydroelectric/wind facilities*

*Long-term contracts with third-party wind suppliers.

With over 50% of its generating capacity in coal, it is less effected buy the
new proposed cape and trade tax but is still vulnerable to future increases as
their future capacity expansion plans still continues to rely on increased coal
usage.

The company recently acquired a $125 million equity interest in Signal Peak
Energy a coal mine located in Montana. This investment is expected to improve
plant output and environmental performance that should produce a fuel supply
that offers the benefits of cleaner-burning western coal but with a higher heat
value.. (
http://commerce.mt.gov/energy/Includes/NewsArticles/2008Articles/082208_Compani
s_Say_They_Plan_to_Invest_450M.pdf )

<u>Valuation:</u>

At a 10.48 PE, the company appears undervalued to its peers and its historical
long term valuation price. Their seven year average PE is 14.34. 2010 company
per share estimates are expected at $3.70 to $3.85 per share. A reversion to
their long term PE mean should value the stock at $55/share a 36% increase from
Friday's closing price.
<pre> 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 1998
Price/Earnings Ratio (a) 11.0 17.0 15.7 18.3 14.3 24.1 16.7</pre>
The company pays $2.20/share annual dividend which yields 5.4% which is at the
mid range yield for companies in this sector.

Insiders have been quick to sell at these lower prices and the short interest
is heavier than normal indicating that there are investors skeptical about the
current valuation, future earnings prospects, and/or outcome of the trade and
cap proposed tax.

I would like to see more hidden assets to categorize this as a "hybrid" utility
opportunity. Even a sign that the company was expanding their future NG or
nuclear generating capacity would be a plus. For now, I plan to continue to
watch this one for future sell offs and may start a small position at lower
prices.

If the company announces an expansion program using NG or some future
partnership with other regional utilities to expand their nuclear generating
capacity would move me to step up and buy at current prices.

FE: Nice write-up.

I see the stock show up when I review utilities. I keep passing. Can't seem to
overcome my geographical preferences or prejudices. My issue. The thing is
either a value stock (bargain) or it is not. At some point (i.e. at a price)
being a bargain trumps my geographical concerns, assuming they're even real.

http://www.firstenergycorp.com/corporate/Corporate_Profile/index.html

I don't like that book value hasn't increased much over the past years. ROE and
ROA look like they've been improving, a positive. Debt ratio's gone up though.

This company might be undervalued relative to its peers. I've no idea how it
might close the gap though, or if it will. Meanwhile, I expect and hope that
peer stocks will do okay over time. And since I am holding some of them, I'm
okay with just that and, like you, I don't feel compelled to buy FE at its
current price.
============================================

Couple things going on that might be worth considering/discussing.

Are there even peer companies? It's not like VZ vs. T or Sprint. How many
electrical companies could there be servicing FE's area? Which might mean these
utilities can't be compared to each other on a generalized p/e, roe, p/bv?

With electric utilities, that's one sector where I have some difficulty in
believing that prices will revert to past years' higher p/e levels.
Deregulation in the '90's and past few years imo resulted in more
investor/trader interest in the sector, and pushed p/e levels up the past
decade. (The utilities supposedly could compete and enter new markets,
unregulated aspects that would/could/should improve profitability.) We've seen
though that many utility managements just weren't successful when they had to
be or tried to be more entrepreneurial. Maybe now that there's a better or
different understanding what utilities are capable of doing or should be doing,
as utility managements focus on reasonable objectives for their companies given
their management skills and core competencies, the businesses will return to
the focus of the past. And therefore, the p/e's of yore (e.g. closer to 11 or
under) will be about the norm for the sector.

"Mixing quantitative tools with a subjective read on a company's underlying
competitive strengths, Schier's $824 million Rydex/SGI Mid Cap Value Fund
(ticker: SEVAX) was up 17.29% this year through June 11"

"He's also bought electric utilities in recent weeks, including Allete (ALE)
and NorthWestern Energy (NWE). The two trade at a discount to other utilities
based on his valuation metrics. Schier likes their opportunities for building
transmission lines to connect wind farms to the interstate grid. Such projects
are usually regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which tends
to offer a more favorable regulatory environment for investors than do state
commissions, he says."

Hi Paul -

CDN UTILITIES came up on the ValuCruncher list of undervalued utility
companies. Their common (Class B) yields about 4% but they have a preferred
(CDN UTILITIES CUM RED 2ND PRF ) selling below the $25 par (pays 6% at par)
price which looks interesting.

http://www.canadian-utilities.com/Investor%20Relations/Shareholder%20Informatio
/Preferred%20Shares/

You are limited on the upside with the preferred but can lock in a pretty nice
yield with the diversification in a Canadian Utility. This might be a good one
to hold in an IRA but I do not know if they withhold a foreign tax. Many of the
Canadian companies have an agreement with the U.S. where these taxes are not
withheld. This make a big difference in an IRA account.

They have a pretty good dividend payment history on their common.

I do like the company's revenue diversification (and that the assets are
located in Canada). From my brief review it also meets my "hybrid" utility
requirements. ValueCruncher shows it's fair value at $41 but at 17% undervalue
for the 'Class B' common shares I am not so sure it is a compelling buy.

Company Profile: CDN UTILITIES

late, I've begun a small position in CHCG.

I'll mention I note excellent (5 bagger+) move in pick of CHNG. Too late for me
with that one though, I suspect.

Averaged down with a buy today of CHME.ob

Yes suddenly mr market is saying that infinite amounts of pieces of paper are
more valuable as compared to useless things like food, energy, and metals. im
just trying to roll with punches but i just walked into a left hook. I fear one
day we will wake up as a nation of debtor/renters, being forced to sell off
pieces of our nation to satisfy the debt.

re Utilities. bought some FTE @22$( France Telecom). Fixed line Enterprise and
mobile business. In Euros: Shares are about 16 Euros, dividend 1.4 Euros.
FCF/share > 2 Euros/share. Revenues for Y2009 are expected to be stagnant. FTE
has delvered their balance sheet substantially to less than 2x EBITDA debt in
the last few years

This is not going to be a fast grower but it's a business with steady cash
flow. The dividend yield is similar to decent quality corporate bonds and there
is some growth potential.

I did not check your calculations, but they could be correct. The issue is that
you assume that ORCL can keep earning 37.8% ROE for the next 10 years AND that
they can put all money earned to earn 37.8% return again and again. This is
pretty unlikely and close to impossible. If they COULD do it, then, yes, their
stock would be very undervalued at the $19.48 price. :)

Overall, if you assume much higher ROE for company than a discount rate (i.e.
37.8% ROE >> 15% discount rate), the stock will almost always look undervalued
due to huge effects of differential compounding.

I was aware of NRG and SCG application for Nuclear power plant loan.Approval of
the loan does not mean that those plants actually get build though. And with a
construction start in Y2011 and completion in Y2015 (best case) I am not
holding my breath either. These types of projects never are going to be on
schedule anyways.

We were lucky to get out of AHT. It was gotten whacked over the last week. The
risk on AHT, from my understanding, is that they've bought a good chunk of
their portfolio in the last 5 years and therefore their PPE could be higher on
the books than in market value. Their mezzanine loans seem to have gotten them
down recently though...

That being said, I bought some more FCH today as, if my calcs are right, I've
got, from their financial statements on yahoo, a PPE/Room of $91k vs. a
debt/room of $62k, and a big portion of their portfolio is in Embassy Suites.
$91k room is a very favorable ratio compared to my analysis of the other Reits
and based on the fact that they're mostly a Suite Hotel owner. The name of the
game these days in Hotel Reits is to be a survivor, and I don't see them being
underwater from a market value to debt perspective.

Also, they did a huge renovation of hotels in 2008 and are gaining market
share, with few purchases of hotels in the last few years.

Still down seemingly 90% from its high. I see it coming through this mess.

Still like SPPR which has not fallen much in the last week though Hotel Reits
have in general.

FTE: So much jargon and acronyms in that presentation that it's not only
off-putting, it's almost laughable to me. Or cryable. Reminds me of trying to
read a French train schedule. Otoh, if I don't understand what FTE are saying,
maybe I shouldn't be considering buying FTE shares.

Your couple sentences seem to correctly sum up FTE's position and outlook
though, from what I can understand from my looking at some of the company's
reports.

Given the yield and the ownership stake by French gov't, I'd say FTE's worth a
small commitment at current price. (French gov't stake is both a positive and a
negative. More positive I believe in times like now when things are tougher and
stock prices are lower).

I've decided though to start by going with a small bet now on both the French
and the Dutch telecoms. (I'd try KPN on the NYSE, but I don't see enough info
on those shares (which seems odd), so I'm going with KKPNY.

My telecom positons now:

VZ TNE CHL AMX TKC NOK LBTYA(stub only), BT KKPNY.PK FTE

re FTE. I wasn't too offended by FTE's presentation. Lot's of analyst speak for
sure but it did give me an idea where the company is going, together with the
annual report. FWIW, they have done a great job deleveraging during the last
few years. KPN's leverage is about 3x EBITDA, almost twice as high as FTE's
1.8x EBITDA. That makes FTE preferable over KPN in my opinion.

This stuff (not tradeable REIT's) appears to be designed for folks who think
that stocks, include publicy traded REIT's are too volatile in value. If it's
not traded, you can't sell it and you have no clue what it's worth. This makes
it a long term investment <g>.

re AET. I looked at AET. What scared me off was a report from Credit Suisse
(accessible via E*Trade account) that suggested that AET reserve level was too
low (they substantially lowered it over the last couple of years) to boost
earnings. So I expect that sooner or later they are going to have a "face
Jesus" moment and have a big writeoff, probably a few % of annual revenues (3%
would be 1B$, just a pick a number). After that everything will be cool again
for a couple of years <g>. However when that happens, i do not want to be
bagholder.

AET. Yes, I see their report now. I find it thorough and ultimately,
discouraging. Not enough reason to hold AET given info from Credit Suisse. I
believe I'll close my exploratory AET position, esp. as I already maintain a
position in UNH in the sector. (UNH which Credit Suisse is also neutral on as
of April)

Anglo American rallies on Xstrata bid approach
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/anglo-american-rallies-on-xstrata-bid-approach
siteid=yhoof

From the article - LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Shares of Anglo American rallied on
Monday as investors bet that the mining group will reject a merger proposal
from rival Xstrata and demand a premium for a deal to go through.

Xstrata said in a statement that it sees "substantial operational synergies"
and reports indicate that Xstrata sees those savings amounting to $1 billion a
year. The companies both, for instance, have coal assets in Australia and South
Africa.

"Merger and bid proposals normally flush out unseen value in major mining
companies as boards compete to show which company has greater value. Previously
unseen projects and overlooked assets may come to the fore and hidden
businesses may be sold to realize cash," said John Meyer, an analyst at U.K.
brokerage Fairfax, in a note to clients

================================================================

It seems like a good one to continue to hold as the hidden value from all of
their natural resource assets are now in play. Specifically AAUK has
substantial platinum holdings in AGPPY ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AGPPY.PK
). This one might be a good one to add as it is trading near it's low, pays a
huge annual dividend (every August), is thinly traded on the pink sheets and
Xstrata is said to be quite interested in these (platinum) assets.

Platinum is used in the production of catalytic converters (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_converter ) and AGGPY is one of the few
producers in the world that mine this specialized metal.

I own both AAUK and AGPPY as core holding in my portfolio since they provide a
good equity hedge against inflation.

Hi Paul,

SUAI finally got the buyout offer. Many other stocks here have done better, but
I'll take 6's from 2/3's.

While I am tooting horns, I figure I might as well give a summary of recent
recommendations.

1. Have been selling RCMT up just under 100% from a couple months ago when I
mentioned it
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25581379&srchtxt=rcmt

2. Have been selling MNDO also up a lot from my recommendation in the 60's
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25427839&srchtxt=mndo

3. Sold some PIY (trust bonds for FTR) up 50% from recommendation, but still
own some at a yield of 12%.
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25457872&srchtxt=PIY

4. LOAN I have been trading, but still own a core position. The company still
seems like a decent risk/reward even though I wouldn't bet the ranch on it.

5. ABIX remains a dog
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25174106

6. TAIT and GV, mentioned along with SUAI have worked out ok for me as well.
Been selling GV until recently and got a TAIT divvy.

I hear microcraps are up about 70% from bottoms and others on the board have
had better picks, but I am quite content with this year's performance. Looking
to take my risk down a notch from here given the limited opportunities I am
seeing ...

Quite here been out for a couple of days on a camping trip. no cell phone,
internet, TV etc. a couple of my limit orders hit:

BRK.B @ 2750$. First time owner. BRK.B has underperformed the market. Intend is
to ride it back to 3000$+ on a swingtrade.

BMR@9.5$ - health care REIT. Trading quite a bit below book value which
overstates (IMO) the NAV because most properties were acquired after Y2005 when
cap rates were low.S till I believe that health care/lab space properties are
holding better than most other CRE classes and BMR has below average leverage.
they also raised most equity at top prices and issued the last secondary at
10.4$, taking care of all debt maturing until Y2012.

SUNH@ 8.12$ - stock in the controversial nursing home sector. Cheap valuation
is earning estimates come through and some analysts are starting to warm up on
the stock.
