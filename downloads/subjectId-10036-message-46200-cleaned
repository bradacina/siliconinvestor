PEMBINA PIPELINE COR (PBNPF.PK) -Other OTC
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=PBNPF.PK+Profile
Pembina Pipeline Corporation operates as an energy transportation and service
provider in Canada. It operates in four segments; Conventional Pipelines, Oil
Sands & Heavy Oil, Midstream & Marketing, and Gas Services. The Conventional
Pipelines segment operates a 7,500 kilometer pipeline network that transports
crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids in Alberta and British Columbia.

the Cheecham Lateral, and the Horizon pipeline, which deliver synthetic crude
oil produced from oil sands. </u>The Midstream & Marketing segment offers
storage, terminal, and hub services. The Gas Services segment consists of
natural gas gathering and processing facilities, including three gas plants and
nine compressor stations. This segment also operates approximately 300

Under the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, Provident shareholders will
receive 0.425 of a Pembina share for each Provident share held (the "Provident
Exchange Ratio")

Benefits of the Combination
The proposed transaction is expected to provide Pembina shareholders with an
increase in cash flow per share, increased dividends per share and reduce
Pembina's payout ratio, while giving Provident shareholders a significant
premium and a 27.5% increase in monthly cash dividends on a per share basis
after taking into account the Provident Exchange Ratio...

---------------------------------------------------------------

Have you studied Pembina Pipeline? Is it a good value? It seems overvalued at
$27.50 (GN shows a value of $12.00 but w/ the combined company with total cash
flows and combined assets it could be higher). I do like the new footprint of
their pipeline & storage assets. They also now have direct access to the
Canadian Oil Sand region w/ distribution to the U.S.

Not sure what to do with my remaining shares. I have 35% shares in an IRA and
65% in the taxable account. Should have loaded up the IRA especially now that
the distributions are going to increase.

My first take is to take the windfall from the taxable account and buy more
Suncor Energy Inc. Common (SU) and let the IRA shares convert to Pembina
Pipeline shares. If their Oil Sand pipeline division expands capacity and
integrates the final distribution point into the U.S. (utilizing the PVX
acquisition pipeline assets), it should benefit companies like Suncor providing
better distribution capacity directly into the U.S..

Also, I believe SU is a net better value now than PBNPF based on the 27.5%
premium paid to PVX shareholders.

Any thoughts ?

There are definitely positives in RIMM. Low valuation. Still positive earnings.
No debt. RIMM email platform. Some brand cachet (even discounting the tired
look for executives). There are negatives too. They are losing market share.
They are struggling to convert to a new still pretty much proprietary platform.
Clownbuck is right that their cash flows are bad in last 3 quarters. 3B of the
book value are intangibles.

IMHO, RIMM has more time to right the ship than most bears expect. However, I
am not sure they have a good plan for righting the ship yet. They have to throw
in the towel and switch either to Android or to MS Win. But either of these
choices makes it an also-ran late-to-the-party. On the other hand if they stick
with their proprietary stack (and QNX), they will have very few developers and
very few 3rd party apps. So they could sell basic smartphones, but not the
top-line app-rich phones. Overall it's tough to estimate what the remaining
market for them will be and how things will work out.

I think NOK is in better shape and further down the road in re-turning than
RIMM. OTOH, NOK is a bigger ship, it has some of its own issues, it has losses,
etc. And NOK is still risky - if their MS Win phone line is not successful,
they will be in much worse shape, since they would be very late to any party.

Personally, I still prefer NOK and own a small position. However, overall, I'd
say neither company is a top-line investment here.

add more SU if it drops a couple of points. I've no plans to add to PBNPF,
other than to just hold on to what I already have. Over time I expect the stock
to do well-enough (for me) given that its pipelines are in the Athabasca heavy

NVDA. I agree with Paul Senior.

The positive of NVDA is that it's the only game in town if you look for
non-captive GPUs. So Intel or someone else might buy them. They are not very
expensive for buyout at 8B, even assuming 1.3x multiple.

The negative is that GPU-intensive computers are a niche. Almost everyone is
trying to integrate GPU into CPUs or SoC solutions. Sure there are
gaming/graphics-intensive PCs bought by enthusiasts. Yet, every year there are
fewer and fewer PCs-with-name-brand-GPUs. Most of the market is
crappy-but-workable Intel integrated graphics solutions or
AMD-a-bit-less-crappy-integrated-Radeon solutions. Yes, NVDA got some of that
business, but I'm pretty sure it's lower margin. And Intel contract can be
considered negative - if Intel has a contract, they won't buy the company.

I am not up to speed about Tegra competitive position, but IMHO NVDA will have
very very tough competition in CPU area. Intel is 900 pound gorilla, while
ARM-solutions is even bigger gorilla in non-x86 space. To get into this field
and remain profitable there is very very hard. Almost all companies that tried
it are now gone.

IMHO, it's not surprising that NVDA does not have great long term financial
results. They are trying to compete in a big-boy playground. It's not going to
be easy.

Did you hear about any problems about VW , BMW or Daimler's financing business
in 2008/2009? There wasn't any - at least not in Europe. Car loans in Europe
tend to be very well collateralized. Even in the Us, car loans performed quite
well.
Also, BMW and VW have their own banking subsidy that actually collects deposit
and runs savings accounts for folks in Europe, which makes it easier to
maturity match liabilities and assets.

Thisis very different from GE and possibly HOG which are heavily depending and
securitization and commercial paper funding. I think a better comparision would
be CAT's financing subsidy, which I believe did not have serious issues either.

RIM Gains on Report of Samsung Interest

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-17/rim-climbs-on-report-samsung-may-be-in

From the article:"...Samsung may be interested in buying RIM, and no deal has
been made because Waterloo, Ontario- based RIM is asking too much, the blog BGR
reported today, without identifying its sources...."

<snip>

"...“This has been speculated before, and it does have logic to it in the sense
that Samsung has no viable high-end smartphone operating system, and
increasingly reselling Android or Windows Phone is being viewed as a commodity
business,” said Tavis McCourt, a Morgan Keegan and Co. analyst in Nashville,
Tennessee...."

Samsung . . . That might add some value to RIM. Similar to what NOK has down w/

As far a michelin goes I think there is a lot more due dilligence that needs to

would be the impact of euro splitting on the michelin operations? As a side

re Michelin - the dividend is going to be 2Euro or close to that number.
pension tend to be a smaller issue in Europe; most companies have a deficit too
but the numbers are relatively small relative to market cap.

Splitting up the Euro will have consequence for their operations in those
countries that would split up. This is really no different for European than
for US companies. Michelin's headquarter is located in France and i don't think
there is a risk that France splits away from the Euro zone.

Michelin is a multinational with international operations. They sell tires just
about anywhere in the world. They have a larger market share in Europe compared
to an US companies like Goodyear or Japanese companies like Bridgestone but any
company with operations or sales in a country that were to change it's currency
would be affected in the same way, regardless where it is located. I think the
multinational will deal with the situation not matter what, regardless where
their headquarter is situated.

Folks get antsy about that Europe stuff, selling stocks in companies like TOT,
as if it would matter much if Greece defaults or not. It may matter for the
international economy but that affects all O&G companies likewise. Crude is
fungible and basically trades for the same all over the world and is quoted in
US$. It does not matter what currency the Greek are going to pay in, they will
have to pay the same for TOT crude than for XOM crudes and they will have to
pay in US$. In much the same way, they will have to pay for tires, unless they
intend to go back to wooden wheel carriages <g>.

"RIM could strike a technology- licensing deal with Samsung . . . That might

Won't happen. Samsung is now working with Intel to use Tizen (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen
http://www.infoworld.com/d/mobile-technology/tizen-merge-samsungs-bada-184318
). They even abandoned Bada for this. They won't go QNX and they don't need
QNX. Of course, IMHO Tizen is as much a deadend as QNX (and Bada) is.

For better or worse, there is one dominant open platform for smartphones
(Android), one closed platform (Apple) and one potential survivor with deep
pockets (MS Win Phone). Everybody else is a loser wannabe. HP WebOS, RIMM QNX,
Tizen, etc. Yes, it's possible for some of them to have niche success in
low-range-smartphones, but none of them will be huge app platforms.

Of course, companies do stupid things for variety of reasons. So it's possible
that Samsung, Asus, China Mobile or Euro Parliament will buy RIMM. But buyout
is the best possible outcome for RIMM. Tech licensing deals are not going to
save RIMM even if someone decides to do it. They won't get enough money from
them.

Hi Paul - From the link provided, its hard to know what individual stocks IEP
actually own. Looking at the PDF link you provided, the IEP report contains a
summary of the business categories they own (ie. rail cars, metals) but not too
many specifics on the individual companies (other than Commercial Metals
Company Commo (CMC)).

Here is a site that shows the companies that Icahn (as an individual) owns: (
http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/institutional-portfolio/icahn-carl-c-18190 ) 21
positions. When I do an equivalent search for IEP, I get no stock holdings. I
assume that these 21 positions make up the compiled list that is presented in
the IEP report (but w/o mentioning the actual companies).

I find it useful to look at the individual companies and/or sectors where he
finds value. Some of those companies I find to be undervalued but others are
not (at least for me). In fact, those that are at or near BV and have earnings,
I find interesting especially when some of the parts are sold and the remaining
company is restructured.

I am 50% successful following Icahn into some of his deals. Many times I lack
the patients to stay with the trade but those that I have, I have always made
money. The key is to use his picks as a start. He tends to discover sectors
that I have overlooked and when I dig deeper, I sometimes find competitors that
are also undervalued which can provide a good value trade.

Re: PP&L Corporation Common Stock (PPL) 

One of the reasons I like PPL is that they focus on NG services and
distribution.

PPL Corporation, an energy and utility holding company, generates and sells
electricity; and delivers natural gas to approximately 5.3 million utility
customers primarily in the northeastern and northwestern U.S.

Wouldn 't Utility companies benefit from the low price and ample supply of
natural gas going forward ? YES, but it requires a large amount of capital to
do the conversion. NG is also a cleaner burning fuel so it is a positive for
the environment. There was also some discussion by Congress to institute a
"Coal Tax" to promote cleaner fuels. This would hit those utilities in the
north east where coal is mined and used to generate some power. Although NG is
now selling at 10 year lows, it's the abundant supply (from all the new shale
drilling) that will keep prices low that would help promote the use of more NG
in electric utilities.

Agree w/others regarding who benefits. For regulated utilities, they are
entitled to a legal return on their capital employed. So they could benefit by
making the capital investment to convert to gas. Of course, otoh, that benefit
would be subject to limitations too by the laws and/or regulators.

Isn't USA nat gas at something like a multi-year low now? If nat gas has ever
competed with coal, now would be the time I just assume.

This one should of dropped more with the rev & earnings dropped but given the

If revs and margins can get back to 2006/2007 level it could double and raise

In for more utility EXC now.

I don't view the utility sector's one or two month's underperformance to an S&P

pricey though (p/e's on some are over 15), so I'm trying to be selective.

Utility stocks with the importance of their businesses, their long history of
dividends and dividend increases, will remain attractive to individuals.
Especially given the European macro climate, low interest rates in US bonds and
with bank accounts.

Hi Labrador -

Re: C&J Energy Services, Inc. Commo (CJES) -NYSE

This is one of my current favorites. I am accumulating a position w/ 60% of my
buys completed. Just missed completing my buys today at $17.16/share.
Hopefully, I will be able to get the rest of my shares at that level or lower.

The company really does not have that long a history so their earnings could be
suspect when viewed for the long term. My brief review of their financials
shows that revenues are exponential, doubling from 2010 to 2011 as they build
more fracking rigs to bring into service. They build these Rigs based on 2-3
year customer service agreements so they are pretty much assured of their use
because of the terms of their service contracts.

I was able to identify their 8 largest customers (those that have entered into
these 2-3 year service agreements). They are very large and credible E&P
companies that have sound balance sheets and can afford their services.

Their next quarterly earnings are to be released 2/15/2011 and analysts show
$3.17/share for 2011 and $3.28/share for 2012. Based on these numbers, current
BV and their trailing PE, this stock (for me) is undervalued. Their GN
calculation shows that $25.00/share is fair value. At the current price of
$17.76/share, the stock is 40% undervalued. I have been buying very small lots
of shares at prices below $20.00.

I expect their earnings to stabilize at current levels and do not expect the
exponential growth as we have seen in the past. Even with modest future growth
this stock is significantly under valued at current levels (if you believe
their financials and/or managements recent forward views).

My total position is still small less than 1% of the portfolio but I am still
quite excited to see what numbers they actually report in February and if they
can continue their growth.

Here are my concerns about CJES. There are no barriers to entry in the business
long-term and no way does the business sustain 30%+ EBITDA margins.

At the end of 2012, CJES is expected to have 270,000 of frac horsepower. The
average frac fleet has 32,000 horsepower of capacity and the cost of ordering a
new frac fleet is $25MM today. That means that the replacement cost of these
assets should be $210MM or $4.00 / share.

Without any sustainable barriers to entry, the assets are really only worth
their replacement cost. The market for frac capacity has recently been tight,
but companies like HAL, SLB, etc. have talked about frac rates flattening /
weaking in certain markets with the addition of new capacity.

Furthermore, the horizontal rig count has recently stopped growing in the US
(likely due to European concerns).

This is not to say that margins collapse tomorrow, only that they will at some
point. I guess you can add some value for the super-normal earnings that CJES
may get for the next 1 - 2 years that the market remains tight, but I still
think that's a long way away from the $17.50 where the stock currently trades.

Also, I'm concerned since 26% of the stock is still locked up and the lock-up
period expires at the end of this month.

Hi Clownbuck -

CJES service contracts cover about 60% oil and 40% NG (it may even be less NG).
I was surprised to see this mix as I thought it was close to 100% NG. What is
interesting from Sheth's earlier post was the tangible value of the Rigs built
and the exposure CJES has when a contract is finished and/or a RIG is not in
services. It reminds me of the Ship Tanker business where the industry is
really cyclical. They make loads of money when day rates are high and lose
money when they over build their fleets and day rates crash.

There has been a lot of discussion that CJES is an acquisition target by A HAL
or SLB but as both of you stated, barriers to entry is small so it is unlikely
unless the company could be had at a deep discount.

My position is small and I do see this as a several month play not years. I was
planning on doing a few month's of covered calls as the premiums are quite

those shares were purchased at a much higher price and most who wanted to sell
did so when the first round of shares (over 75%) were sold.

I will be watching the earnings for the large Oil Service companies (ie

It is a two to three year play, not months or weeks for sure. The company
income has been effected by several patent infringement law suits they have had
to defend, hence their legal bills have gone up. Over ten million dollars last
year. They won all cases and feel their legal liability for the coming year is
$500,000. Once this is all settled earnings and margins should both improve.
Looking for a double from here over the next year or two if not bought out by
Icahn prior. They have the products that the industry wants and are going back
into the shrink wrap area as well ,now that their non compete clause from the
sale of previous shrink operations has run out.

Hi gizwick. I was curious as to the distorted numbers on VKSC's history and
found the lawsuits from World Pac and American Can and the sell off of the
shrink wrap division to cover debt and how it lost its listing due to market
cap and that they recently appointed a new CEO.

Concerns....It's still selling at high multiples when you look at the debt.
Their sales are predominatly overseas where a strengthening dollar may hurt
sales. And its almost illiquid as sometimes days go by without a trade.
There's also some EPA problem that may come up in Tenessee as well as a new
lawsuit from a private party that may be nothing at all.

It does not matter, even if 100% of their contracts were related to oil. The
equipment and processes to use for pressure pumping fracking are largely he
same with oil and NG, which means that glut in said capacity is affecting them
no matter what.

CJES and other companies are benefiting from tight capacity and my feel is that
this is about to change, and quite possibly resulting in a glut that is going

I think that the clearer play would be to buy the companies that build the
large NG fired turbines for generating the electricity. I looked around to see
if I could determine who builds these things and it appears that GE is the
major supplier for these. If anyone knows of another industrial company that
produces large NG fired turbines please chime in.

I do own GE, but it is a large conglomerate, where additional earnings in this

Hi Brian -

The other angle is to buy the construction companies that do the upgrades. The
ones that come to mind are Foster Wheeler AG. (FWLT), Chicago Bridge & Iron
Company N (CBI), Fluor Corporation Common Stock (FLR) and even Johnson
Controls, Inc. Common S (JCI). As I recall, CBI has a subsidiary that deals w/
the planning and retrofitting and/or expansion of NG systems including
generating facilities.

These are tough plays because their business is cyclical where they do good
when the economy is booming and not so good in sour economies. CBI for example
is close to it's all time high. I bought my first lots in 2010 around $17.00.
Stock traded at $44.00 today and they still are receiving new orders mainly for
NG processing plants.

The overall theme for this play is NG and it's 10 year low now selling @
$2.30/mcf. What companies can benefit from these historically low prices?

A group of us on the 50% Gains mIRC chat were brain storming on this theme and
the best we could come up with is "fertilizer". Therefore, certain chemical
companies that manufacture Ammonia Nitrates or other products with NG as it's
input could see higher margins.

Definitely, NG Utilities will benefit from lower rates, those companies that
distribute NG (pipeline & NG storage & Processing plants) will benefit from
lower rates but have already increased in price as a result of investors
bidding up prices. So maybe another area to research are the specialty chemical
companies and/or the fertilizer companies that distribute Nitrogen fertilizers
and/or AG companies that benefit from low fertilizer prices and even AG
equipment suppliers.

The disruptive event all stems to historically low NG prices and a glut of
supply due from all the new U.S. NG well with NG and nowhere to go.

>>New vehicles being more expensive with controlled incentives while the
average age of the vehicles in the USA hits a new record of 10.8 years.<<

I am in the market for a new car and I have the feeling that the dealers and
even more so the car companies have me by the balls. Lot of cars have very
sparse availability and even worse are not available in basic trims without
options I Don't want at all. Examples are Hyundai Elantra and Honda CRV ( very
hard to get LX Model). No incentives whatsoever and the sparse inventory makes
negotiating hard. Used car prices are through the roof and cars from the
recession years 2007-2009 are sparse.
However, I don't really have a choice but to purchase a new vehicle since I
pushed off the purchase since 2008 already and my 15 year old junks tear is
falling apart.

I find th way cars are sold in the US to be very strange. In Europe, typically
you will order your car the way you want it (color, options), wait a couple of
weeks until it is build and then pick it up at the dealer. The dealer will have
very little cars for sale - mostly demonstration vehicles. You don't really go
to the dealer and drive the car of the lot. I think it is better for the dealer
too, since he carries much less inventory, however the car companies are more
demanding with their dealer network in terms of presentation and technical
proficiency. Maybe somebody get's the idea and starts to sell cars this way in
the US - could be a gamechanger,IMO.

OT - things might improve as the year rolls if there are no additional natural

the inventory. And yeah, the lean years before. I may be in the market for used
car this year, hopefully I can stretch it out...

Euro model has advantages, but I guess also disadvantages... probably more
difficult to get a great deal compared to US lot clearances. And the ability to
test drive the exact model you're getting is great in US. I think Europe is
just space constrained, especially in cities, so it's hard to use American
model.

Did you notice that sedan body type is almost non-existent in Europe nowadays?
Almost everything is a hatchback. Or at least that's how it seemed in Brussels.

Jurgis, I think the effects of the Japan quake and Thai floods are indeed
rolling off but it's hard to explain the shortage of Hyundai (at least certain
models) with that. I suppose supply exceeds demand for these vehicles, because
they are good values. I actually found sufficient supply with many (but not all
Japanese models), for example there are plenty of Civics around but after
testing them I came to the conclusion that the Hyundai Elantra is better in
it's class.

Toyota's for the most part look very stale, almost as if their product
development department has slept for ma couple of years (or worked on fixing
their quality problems). To some extend, that even applies to Honda.

I always bought used in the past ( sold and bought 2 cars over craigslist) but
there is so little supply right now, that I feel there are no good deals to be
had, so I think I might as well buy new.

As for Euro versus US sales model, I know right now that car discounts in
Germany are easily 15% off from MSRP, which far exceeds what you can get in the
US right now. I vastly prefer the European model - driving exactly the same car
is not as important to me than buying exactly the car with the features that I
want.

As for body style, I consider the Sedan style impractical (of course I grew up
in Europe so I am biased) and so do most Europeans. With a hatchback of wagon
style car, you have many more possibilities to reconfigure the existing space,
that just don't exist with a sedan style car. Of course the US has trucks for
this kind of stuff but their mileage is poor and they are impossible to park in
tight space so they don't work in cities at all.
I think the station wagon is the most practical car and I wish there were more
choices available (the Jetta Wagon is pretty good imo).

It looks like the near term prospects for the US car industry is quite good -
there really is pent up demand out there, especially for fuel efficient
vehicles. I think trucks and truck based SUV are in LT decline, so the industry
has to learn how to make money from smaller vehicles. Right now, it looks like
they found a way to do that.

Hi CB,

You are correct - the manufacturers do push dealers into a bigger supply
channel.To a much lessor degree now than say pre 08.

If you choose the desired vehicle - specify the options and colors,it is by far
cheapest for a dealer to order and deliver vs locate ,trade,travel to obtain
it, and then deliver it.

I had a large group of repeat customers and families that preferred to order
and wait.

With a controlled supply vs demand (many plants are shut down) the time
required to build a vehicle from order date to delivery is greatly reduced.

Most dealers have an internet or Business Development Center,they will be glad
to accept and place a "SOLD" order.

What you want is a "Sold Order" status.Which will give you protection from
future price increases - at least with GM it does.

It will not assure you the current rebate - that can go up or down.Historically
as we enter the spring months the incentives generally go up into the best or
highest for summer months.

In the GM lines 2012 will be done with production ending generally by early
June - so the order should be placed by late April early May.

Big aggressive stores will want to trade and do the deal tomorrow.My advice
would be to work periferal dealers, smaller single point stores - they'll be
glad to take a sold order and keep you advised.

Work your deal based on Invoice or floor planned amount less rebates, which can
be easily determined by factory websites and enjoy your buying experience with
a quality dealer.

They are not hard to find.

If you keep your vehicle a long time (as it sounds you do) - I would
predetermine the cost of a factory extended warranty plan as well, they will
add to your purchase price - but cars are no longer simple and labor rates
usually start at $100.00 plus per hour.As a percent of the product price they
are not a bad deal and if ever needed you'll be glad you have it.If you trade
every 50,000 mile don't bother.

Be prepared to be amazed at the very limited mark up dealers have with new
vehicles.

It is often a great misperception.

Hope that helps.

Any questions - just holler.

divisions for sending down tech to the mainline. So I'll be looking at
Accord/Camry/Altima/Maxima again (might go with Acura/Lexus/Infiniti if there's
a great value deal ;) but usually prices are too high). Love my 2003 Accord and
even 97 Camry is going OK (knock on wood).

I've had station wagon (~80 Corolla) and hatchback (coupe?) (~79 Nissan SX). I
did not see any advantages over sedan really. If you have to buy something big

Hello Jurgis, the sweet spot for Hyundai is the lower middle class (Elantra/
Sonata, Tuscan). Those cars are selling very well, they feel well build and
very complete in terms of accessories. The cars are somewhat cheaper than Honda
but not that much.

I was open to trying the Civic but the trunk is so small and the interior build
quality is inferior to many vehicles out there. if you want a used value car,
Nissan is the way to go, since their resale value is not as good as those of
it's Japanese peers (but then Nissan's are really french cars <g>).

Right now I am driving a Ford Probe 1996 hatchback - I purchased this car when
i moved to the US and I bought it cash really cheap back then. It's actually a
fund car to drive but it's seeing the mechanic more and more often now and has
reached the end of it's useful life. While a two seater, it's a great car to
haul stuff around, I could do all errands for many home renovation projects
with this car, which includes hauling a complete door with frame- try that with
a sedan!

In the mid price sedan range, the new Camry Hybrid is a good value, imo. With
hybrids, Toyota still got an edge and the value proposition at the price target
for this car seems good.

OT - I gave up on Corrolla/Civic class last time since it seemed that either
you don't get much or you get the options, but pay almost the same as for
Camry/Accord, so why settle for lower class priced-up with options?

I've thought about hybrids long time, but I am concerned that you are pretty
much forced to use dealer mechanics for them and overall the system has more
moving parts, so more failures. Plus it's harder to determine when the mechanic
is just milking you for dough. I am too cheap to deal with that. :/

So probably Accord/Camry/Maxima/Altima/maybe Sonata + glances at
Audi/Lexus/Acura/Infiniti. Somewhere couple years old, 50K miles, $15K or so.
Might be tough depending on used car market, but I hope I don't need to do it

DLR with their 4% yield and double digit growth (for me) is a good combination.

this is strictly anecdotal. we have owned a hyundai elantra hatchback since
about 2002 the car performed great for about 100,000 miles or so and then
problems began. the worst of which was corrosion in parts connecting the wheel
to the axle which caused it to rust through to the point where i briefly lost
control of the car. Had it happened on an expressway a tragedy could have
ensued. I wrote a nasty letter to the company and they covered my repair costs
but did not issue a formal recall untill several months later. then this year
after about 130,000 miles I have had major expenditures starting with front
struts etc then later some oil leak which destroyed the alternator and then the
battery. Now after 150,000 miles im told i need new rear struts and swingway,
the hydraulics on the trunk are shot and there are no aftermarket parts im
told. there is rust in the rear and at this point I am reluctant to put any
more money into it. so my experience says the hyundai are good for 130-150,000
miles but i know people with toyotas and subarus who are driving them with
200,000 + miles. Also as i said before had i lost control of the car on the
expressway you might not have heard from me again. Now I live in the northeast
with lots of exposure to the elements and salt in the roads, and potholes.
My in-laws in arizona have a sonata and after 6 years it still drives like a
new car.

I guess i am in the market for a new/used car. are other car is a prius, which
is not that much fun to drive but the gas milage is pretty good and so far no
problems after 85,000 miles. So right now my inclination would be to spring for
a toyata as opposed to a hyundai if the price differential is $2,000 or less
for the same car equivalent. Hatchbacks are pretty convenient so I might look
for one of those again.

re PPL - 40% of their 2011 earnings are from merchant energy and this sector is
going to hurt in 2012 due to low NG prices. I think their regulated business
alone makes only 1.6$ share , this is going to be up a little - let's say
1.7$/share. i think merchant energy earnings will be cut in half, which get's
us to 2.2$/share.

Based on that, i would rate PPL a reasonable value but not a great one (FWIW, i

OSG is a tanker stock and there's a glut of tanker stocks. Maybe more new

I'm interested in these companies if I can buy their stock at/near scrap value
of ships after subtracting debt.
I don't know if OSG is there or not.

Some of the argument here is that OSG is better than FRO. It's seems to me to
be another case of relative value investing. I do that, but it is dangerous.
Maybe in this case, doubly so. Given that OSG is a better investment than FRO,
neither looks inviting to me.

I also don't like OSG's d/e ratio of 1.3x. OSG's got to service that debt.
($2.1B per Yahoo) Am I understanding correctly that it's very difficult for
anybody to make money in the tanker business now? If so, that d/e ratio becomes
a concern for me.

I just don't see a compelling reason to buy the stock at its current price.
Maybe if there's a Mideast war or USA exports more oil. (website: "The only
major tanker company with a significant International Flag and U.S. Flag

I'll pass on OSG. Jmo, and point out I've been wrong many, MANY times.

Paul, thanks for the feedback, it was helpful. I agree that my relative value
approach could add an important bias to my thinking. Its like comparing a ship
with a massive hole to one with an average size - both will eventually sink

To answer your question about the tanker market: yes, it is probably hard for
anyone to make any money right now and may be even over the next year. My
thesis is that because operating ships is such a cash intensive activity many
uneconomic operators lacking the financial wherewithal will probably go out of
business or voluntarily put their ships in layup. Many of the new orders that
are in shipyards will either be delayed or cancelled (the respective parties
will find it cheaper to pay the cancellation fee than operating a vessel at
below cost). Finally, the significance of escalating geopolitical tensions
involving Iran and the rest of the world cannot be downplayed. It is a very
real threat that has significant implications for the price of oil and by
association freight rates for tankers.

I think the other two important things to note are the dividend yield and the
amount of insider buying going on. Although it cut its dividend in half last
year it current dividend offers a 6.5% yield and it has been paying dividend
since 1988 which encompasses at least 1-2 other shipping cycles. As I mentioned
earlier insiders have spent $32m net since june last year with 1 of the
directors (Oudi Recanati) spending about $6.1m.

Once again thanks for your thoughts, I would love to get some more insight if
you think about any issues.

Hi Moj. Thanks for sharing your work on OSG.

The stock along with its peer group have been red hot since hitting lows in mid
Dec. and is likely to consolidate a while. I did note that you are looking at
this as a long term play but the recent rally is providing evidence that the
sector has bottomed out.

Credit Suisse came out with an Outperform rating in late Nov. based on expected
improvement in rates and demand late in 2012. Suisse's target price is 20.

A recent Bloomberg article has information supporting your thesis.

Hi Moj,

Interesting analysis and thanks for posting it.

Other than the insider buying angle (insiders should understand the
fundamentals of their business and must see an argument that the company is
undervalued assuming that it is their own money put at risk) I didn't find the
argument for OSG to be particularly strong. It seems to me that it is a long
term play on increasing VLCCF rates (and they do have a strong enough balance
sheet to wait a couple of years for rates to recover), or a short term bet on
Iran getting stupid and closing the straits of hormuz.

Personally in the space I think I prefer VLCCF. At least they can still make
money at these current depressed rates (may be that some of this is temporary
as they generally have longer term rates locked in?). If you expect VLCC rates
to recover to the 2000 - 2009 rates OSG may have significantly more upside, but
it seems to me that OSG also has decidedly more bankruptcy risk if rates stay
depressed for a long period. (The VLCCF has a an interesting graph of these
rates on slide 7: http://hugin.info/132879/R/1562005/483567.pdf ).

I do sometimes like to buy stocks at a low percent of book but I also like to
see total liabilities as less than 50% of total assets. So I think I'd prefer a
stock like PRGN (<10% of book and less debt if you look at total liabilities/
total assets) or SBLK on this metric. As oftentimes these stocks sell at a low
percent of book for a reason (e.g. they overpaid for ships when rates were much
higher).

Just some random thoughts. I do think OSG is interesting and hopefully will do
quite well without Iran doing anything overly stupid. I wish you luck with it.

Area51,

Appreciate the feedback and I agree my analysis is not perfect. VLCCF
definitely looks like an interesting prospect given its dividend yield(almost
14%!).

What I like about OSG is its size and market position. Although that is no
guarantee against bankruptcy its access to capital in market downturns second
to none. For example for 2013, 5-6 banks have agreed to collectively give it
access to a $900m revolving credit facility with an accordion feature to raise
its line to $1.25b. For banks to extend such generous amounts on an unsecured
basis speak volumes for the credit quality of the company. Having access to
that kind of liquidity can be crucial especially in shipping that relies
heavily on cash for day to day operations.

It's size also serves to diversify its sources of revenue. It operates a
diversified fleet (108 in all) of crude and product tankers and has a joint
ownership of 4 LNG vessels with qatargas. It also has a niche US flag operating
segment whose revenues are quite independent of world tanker rates since there
are regulatory rules that protect it from international competition. If rates
were to recover in the next year or two OSG's well entrenched market position
would act as a favourable factor in its valuation imo. The same cannot be said
about VLCCF. It really only has a fleet of about 8 VLCC's out of which time
charters on 2 are going to run out this year that could cause a significant hit
to earnings. That being said the strength of their balance sheet is commendable
in terms of liquidity (5.5x quick) as well its 0.5 debt/equity ratio.

Sergio,

Appreciate the feedback and the article. Yes, I know about LNG and US flag
operations. In fact those operations give its revenue some diversification. It
has a 50-50 joint venture with Qatargas Transport on 4 lng vessels and are on
25 year time charters with Qatar Liquified Natural Gas. Its US flag operations
are quite niche because it is protected from international competition. The
1920 Jones act requires all vessels carrying cargo between contiguous US ports
to be US built, registered, owned and operated. Furthermore, the ships need to
be manned by US citizens and fly the US flag.

Also, it is possible that the sector has bottomed out but the oversupply of
ships and uncertainty around macro picture might keep freight rates low for
some time. I think to take full advantage of a price appreciation requires a
2-3 year time horizon, although you could easily see a 50% return if rates
improved even slightly.

If you come across any more articles like the bloomberg one, it would be great
if you could pass it on.

Siemens is another big player and it looks like they are making big investments
into the Gas Turbine sector. I sold my last few shares of SI (10/20/2010) @
$115.00. Their Graham No. is calculated at $97.81/share. The stock is selling
right at the GN fair value. I plan to pick up shares on any significant market
sell off. I bought my original position 8/12/2009 @ $69.80 roughly 38% below
the GN. I would be a buyer at 30% below the GN or about $75.00/share. Their
forward PE is 8.55 and LT debt profile is good w/ 3X net annual revenue
covering their LT debt. Their annual dividend is not too bad either paying 3%.

Siemens AG (SIE) has earmarked more than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) to
expand production of gas- turbines and fend off General Electric Co. (GE) as
they jostle for share of the expanding market.

A “genuine boom” is under way in some regions, with the gas-turbine market
growing more than 9 percent annually in the Commonwealth of Independent States,
Roland Fischer, the head of Munich-based Siemens’ Fossil Power Division, said
in an interview. The division generated 14 percent of Siemens’s total 74
billion euros in revenue last year.

Siemens, which claims the No. 1 spot in larger, flexible turbines, is betting
rising U.S. shale-gas output and its focus on gas-turbines will help it
outflank GE and Alstom SA (ALO), which focused more on steam-turbines. U.S.
spending on upgrading power plants to meet tighter emission rules may touch
$100 billion, and falling gas prices will likely tempt utilities away from
coal, said Peter Reilly, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.

“We believe our technology is two to three years ahead of the competition,”
Fischer said by phone on Jan. 17. “Competition is tough. It’s been hard work to
get where we are today. Our rivals are surely not happy. We will do our utmost
not to allow anyone to take that position from us.” His unit added 3,000
employees in the past 1 1/2 years, Fischer said.

Statistics on turbine suppliers are compiled by McCoy Power Reports. Since
2003, GE has averaged 44 percent of the market for 20 megawatt or more plants,
though a single large order could swing annual market share figures, Paul
Browning, president of thermal products at GE’s energy division, said in an
interview. Figures for 2011 will be released around March, and McCoy declined
to give details before then.

Profit Generator
Fossil power-generation, the largest of Siemens’ 10 main divisions, has long
been an earnings driver and a swelling order book will help offset sluggish
demand in areas such as health- care equipment. Under Fischer, sales last year
rose 6.8 percent to 10.2 billion euros and earnings jumped 85 percent to 2.83
billion euros, eclipsing the entire profit produced by the Munich-based
company’s health-care operation.

Chief Executive Officer Peter Loescher is banking on energy products to help
push sales past 100 billion euros. The company is expanding gas-turbine
factories in Charlotte, North Carolina and Berlin, as well as building new ones
in Saudi Arabia and St. Petersburg, Russia. Northeast Asia, including China,
and the Middle East will also show above-average growth in gas turbines going
forward, Fischer said.

Crack Cocaine
Siemens, which has about 1,300 gas turbines installed, has almost doubled its
market share to 40 percent in larger turbines with power output exceeding 100
megawatts in recent years, Fischer said, without giving a specific time frame.

MARKET TALK: JPMorgan Raises MAN SE Target Price
0830 GMT [Dow Jones] JPMorgan raises its target price for MAN SE (MAN.XE) to
EUR87 from EUR70, expecting German truck sales to hold up relatively well.
Overall, "European freight is starting to show a stabilization at a lower
level, which would bode well for truck demand," JPM says. It maintains its
overweight rating. The brokerage also narrows its forecast of the expected fall
in 2012 European truck volumes to -12% from -15%. In addition, it views
synergies between MAN SE and Scania (SCV-A.SK) positively. Shares are 0.4%
lower at EUR77.46.

MAN expects to triple revenue over the next ten years.

MAN SE's Diesel & Turbo Unit Might Triple Revenue Within 10 Years

FRANKFURT (Dow Jones)-- The new head of MAN SE's (MAN.XE) Diesel & Turbo
division, Rene Umlauft, said the unit might be able to triple annual revenue
over the next ten years, adding that it can react flexibly to softening demand
as it braces for some "heavy weather" during the anticipated economic slowdown.
"It's conceivable that the company triples [annual] revenue to around EUR10
billion by then," Umlauft told corporate magazine MANforum in an interview
published Monday when asked where he sees the Diesel & Turbo division in ten
years' time. He said growth will be fueled by emerging markets.
The Diesel & Turbo division produces large diesel engines and turbo machinery
as well as turnkey power plants. It posted almost EUR3.77 billion in revenue in
2010 and EUR2.61 in the January-to-September period last year. MAN's total
revenue was EUR14.7 billion in 2010, and EUR12 billion in the first three
quarters last year.
MAN produces mainly trucks, buses and other commercial vehicles, but its diesel
and turbo-engine business had a stabilizing effect when global truck markets
tanked in 2009.
Umlauft took over the wheel at MAN's Diesel & Turbo unit on Sept. 1, 2011, and
became a member of the parent firm's management board. He joined MAN from
German industrial giant Siemens AG (SIE.XE), where he was in charge of the
renewable energy division.
Volkswagen AG (VOW.XE), Europe's largest auto maker, acquired a majority stake
in MAN last year.

MAN is the leader in Brazil truck sales.

Could it be that Tech stocks are undervalued? Buffett bought into IBM last
year. It seems that all the media(barrons, forbes, etc) is pushing dividend
stocks as the safe play. Barrons even suggested that tech firms should start
paying or increasing their dividend in their latest edition so that it will
attract more investors.

IMO, large tech stocks are undervalued. I bought more HPQ last week(thursday)
before IBM release. This time I bought the Jan 13 2013 $35 call options. They
ask price was 1.05 with no activity so I bought them. I think I was the only

Regarding EKS post about "Stocks Are Cheaper Than They've Been in Two Decades",
I don't argue the facts of the report. It's just that the report seems
irrelevant to me.

Just my issue of "anchoring" --- fixated on the most recent prices of S&P and
tech stocks and others. The stocks I am looking at are all up now from lows. Is
market volatility now gone? If not, these stocks will drop back with the next
market downswing. So I'm very reluctant to step up (what I consider up) now for
stocks that are still values (like HPQ). It is just difficult for me to find
tech or other S&P stocks to buy now given my concerns. I continue to hold the
shares of tech stocks that I do have though, HPQ, INTC, etc.
