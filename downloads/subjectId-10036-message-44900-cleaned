I tried Google spreadsheet for simple subset of my stuff and it was not
workable. The speed was atrocious. I think it's not ready for bigger
spreadsheets. :( Might be a combination of my browser/machine/internet speed
and other factors, but it still does not attract me to switch. I agree that
Google spreadsheets would have some advantages of being integrated with their

I find a huge difference in speed using Chrome (google browser) All other

many rows. I think they recommend 1000 rows. It depends when you tried. There
is huge difference from a year ago. What I like a lot is that you can share the

"After you guys have researched a stock and decided the value was not there
yet, how do you keep track of it?"

J Mako, if you are a person who puts a lot of time & effort into researching
individual stocks, then I guess you would want to keep alert to such stocks
even if your decision has been to not buy at the current time and/or price. For
me, I spend very little time in researching a potential stock (but I do look at
a lot of stocks), and so I keep no records for 98% of the stocks I look at and
dismiss. The other 2% that I look at that I might want to revisit, I list at
the top of a watch portfolio. Of course, I keep tracking records for the stocks
I already own -- and I maintain positions in at least 200 stocks.

For my purposes, I find it pretty easy to monitor at least several hundred
stocks at a time. As I say, I use Yahoo. My purposes are to be alerted to news
about each company and see price change and percentage change (20 min. delay),
I partition the stocks into various Yahoo portfolios -- real estate, bdc's,
tech, retail, industrial, food, watch, etc. I can easily get Yahoo's metrics
that I want for each stock or portfolio by making use of Yahoo's "custom"
button for a portfolio. One drawback is that I do miss small changes in stock
prices that accumulate. That is, I may be watching a stock that moves up 1/4
point a day for a few days, and I don't realize the stock's moved up a big
percentage or dollar amount over a couple of weeks. I try to catch that on the
downside by looking at new lows list.

I like to know what kind of mistakes I am making in selling, so I add all the
stocks I sold out of to the bottom of my watch list.

Somewhat OT - Google spreadsheets.

I tried a week ago uploading 4K row spreadsheet with no formulas, just data. I

choked the browser, then looking at the spreadsheet was similarly bad. I may
try Chrome, but then my Firefox tools won't work.

I am surprised when people are happy about Google "office". Almost every time I

The maximum rows in Google Docs spreasheets only depends on the maximum number
of cells in a spreadsheet. When you hve reached this maximum you most probably
won't be able to add any more rows.

The theoretical limit of the number of rows in a spreadssheet is 200,000 rows,
provided you have one sheet and a single cell wide column. See also the limits
below.

Spreadsheets Each spreadsheet can be up to 256 columns, or up to 200,000 cells,
or up to 100 sheets -- whichever limit is reached first. There's no limit on
number of rows. Each spreadsheet can have up to 20,000 cells with formulas. Of
this total, the following limits apply: Up to 1,000 GoogleFinance formulas Up
to 1,000 GoogleLookup formulas Up to 50 Import formulas You have a limit of
1000 spreadsheets. The spreadsheets that are shared with you do not count
against 1000 limit. The limit on spreadsheets open at one time is 11. You can
import spreadsheets up to approximately 1 Mb in xls, csv, or ods, txt, tsv, tsb

Contract research organizations (CRO): "until the lousy economy and big changes

that crushed profits and share prices throughout the drug-research industry."

I see the big issue as being "big changes in the drug industry". It's not - imo
- the lousy economy or the slowdown in r&d spending. It's that there's been
consolidation in the drug industry (which means consolidation and/or permanent
(imo) reduction in drug research ), and so the contracts let out to the cro's
are down. And halcyon times may not return to the sector as cro's compete for
the lesser pie. This jmo of the situatation. And I've been wrong many, many
times. Regardless, I'm out of the sector now, and intend to stay out. Of course
I could be very wrong about that also. Proposed takeout of PPDI shows that the
big money is interested.

The roe turns pear shaped only in recent years. If you go back 10 years, it's

it will be a good buy when it reverts to mean.

Hi Windgoof -

Be sure to install the CHROME Browser when using GOOGLE Docs and their
spreadsheet application. I have not tried it on my Android Tablet yet but on
the PC the CHROME browser makes the Google Spreadsheet run much faster and
everything displays nicer versus Firefox.

I have done some editing on my Google Spreadsheets from my Android Tablet. They
even have a voice command input mode.

I am still learning how to work with portions of the spreadsheets like print
range, export range etc. One of my Tab sheets is a summary page of the basket
of my E&P stocks. It shows the % of each company in my basket (based on market
price and cost). I like to sort this list from highest % to lowest % and w/o
screwing up the spreadsheet, I export this table to a .srv file do my sort and
then print the output text file. I like to post this table from time to time on
the Value thread.

There must be an easier way to create summary tables of my results. I did
notice that they recently included a "convert file to HTML" . This works fast
and it is easy then to cut and paste results from the HTML output file.

There is a lot you can do with the GOOGLE integrated spreadsheet functions. One
thing I want to add to my E&P basket spreadsheet is to include a table of the
proven reserves (ie BOPD and/or BOEPD) for each of the companies in my E&P
basket. Over time, companies update their BOEPD so it is nice to calculate the
"Fair Value" based on Boepd vs the current market value. This way I can see
just how undervalued the stock is priced by the market given the current price
of Oil.

Hi Madharry -

CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (CX)

me. I will pass on this one.

My 30 year mortgage is paid off March of next year and I have yet to load up my
Home Equity Line (now available interest only at 3%). My plan is to pick up
some rental properties, fixed them up and get them leased. I plan to eventually
put 15 year fixed loans on them (3.65% from my Credit Union). I will keep just
enough equity in the properties so they are cash flow positive.

The Lowest Mortgage Rate ... Ever!
By Rich Smith Posted 4:15PM 10/07/11
http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/10/07/the-lowest-mortgage-rate-ever/
From the article:"...if you've got the balance sheet to work it -- might be to
lock in a lower rate on your current home, then buy a second home at the same
low rate. Rent out the first, and live in the second. Because even if people
aren't buying houses, chances are they still want a roof over their heads.
Today's low rates give you a great chance to play landlord....".

It seems like the right time to nibble at investment rentals with mortgage
rates at 50 year lows. I was a landlord in the early 90's during the S&L bail
out. I sold the rentals after 5 years so I could focus full time on stocks. I
made good money in the early 90's flipping foreclosures but it was a lot of
physical work.

I try to stay as liquid as possible. I set up my Home Equity credit line 4
years ago at the peak of the real estate market. Never used the line of credit,
but it's nice to know that it is there. I have been waiting 20 years for this
phase in the real estate cycle and now that I can buy properties at $0.50 on
the dollar, the long wait may have been worth it.

The lenders learned this the hard way. Somebody with home equity lines and a
mortgage is more likely to default on the mortgage than somebody without home
equity line. Think about it - it makes perfect sense.

I had a home equity line with zero balance too at terrific terms since it was
based on libor. When I re-financed last year, I had to close it since they
would not allow a change of first lien, even though from a coverage point of
view it did not make a difference to them (Cashless refinance). It was their

Thank you for the AG report Links. I am not too interested in the monthly
variations but more so of the longer trend. The grains and oil seed harvests
are areas that BG and SEB seem to be investing in so these would be of
interest. My new tracking position in AG GROWTH INTERNATIONAL INC. (Toronto:
AFN.TO ) make a lot of the grain storage bins and conveyor systems (even those
that load ships). They recently reported lots of growth in Russia and Australia
too. I provided a link to their most recent June 2011 presentation in my
earlier post.

The interesting thing with BG is they have a JV with Solazyme, Inc. (SZYM) to
process several variants of high valued oils from their oil seed milling
facility in Brazil. Therefore, their productivity boost does not come from
higher productions but rather from more efficient processing technologies. As a
result, earnings are higher based on selling these higher margin oil variants
from their new facility.

Therefore, my value AG theme premise is not so much on "higher productions" but
rather reducing costs (through more efficient equipment & systems) and
integrating sustainable practices (like SEB has done w/ their bio-diesel plant
in Colorado that uses the waste output from their HOG farm) to better use the
inputs now used in production.

Noble Group Ltd. (NOBGF.PK) has a sugar processing facility in Brazil that they
recently expanded at a cost of $900M. This is the first facility to take the
"waste stream" biomass of the plant to power generators that produce
electricity sold to the local utility. All areas of their facility are
profitable and sustainable.

So the Value opportunity is in the process engineering that goes into building
these next generation facilities. I have also created a new watch list titled
"Processed Engineering" Companies that develop and engineer these systems. This
would include utilizing new materials (ie catalysts) and technologies that make
the sector/industry more efficient.

The companies in my value list for this group (processed engineering) include:
Dow Chemical Company (The) Comm(NYSE: DOW), Cabot Corporation Common
Stock(NYSE: CBT) and OM Group, Inc. Common Stock(NYSE: OMG).
http://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/DOW,CBT,OMG/view/dv;_ylt=AqyuF0.4mI0z2uc191EJR2
Lv7gF;_ylu=X3oDMTEydDA3OGxkBHBvcwMxMQRzZWMDeWZpVGFibGlzdARzbGsDZGV0YWlsZWQ-

There are many other companies that I need to add to my list and cover several
other sectors but are developing and/or engineering better and more efficient
solutions to old problems. These systems can be installed all over the world
(especially in China and Brazil). Most of the technologies are developed in the
US and exported to countries around the world.

wouldnt bite , they said they would renegoitiate after i got approved. I got
approved but they dont want to abide by the terms of the original lock letter.
I figure in two years i will probably reduce the mortgage loan to a more
managable level and then will either refinance or sell it depending on where my
son goes to college.

I have been building a position in CCCL lately. Seems like things are a little
too negative when people take rejection of a $7 buyout offer as a negative
thing for a stock selling around 2.70. But if I had built a company I don't
think I'd be too anxious to sell at a 3.4 P/E or 1.7X 2012 EBITDA. Then again
it seems like you can never be too negative on these China plays. I think I
need them to accept a $12 buyout offer just to break even on my China plays

Hi PC,

If I'm not mistaken KLIC has outsourced its production to a contract
manufacturer in Asia.

So they use their money only after a contract maker has finished the equipment.

They buy it ship and avoid the carrying costs of WIP.

If the quality is there - it is an excellent business model with excellent

FKWL - It is cheap based on cash value and current earnings.

Couple questions/observations

- They have 7M receivables. Who are they from?
- Their cash flows are all over the place. Is that lumpy contracts or something
more to it?
- Their FTI acquisition is rather weird. What do you think happened? They are
still increasing the position by buying a convertible that was converted into
shares. Is this a good use of money? How do you interpret "On October 15, 2009,
we opened a branch office in Seoul, South Korea, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Franklin Wireless that manages certain logistical and administrative efforts
for the Company. The Korea-based business office has been inactive since
September, 2010." (from 10K
http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=8165576-115
-199921&type=sect&dcn=0001019687-11-003096 )
- Why there was a huge sales jump in 2010 but the earnings were exactly the
same as on much lower sales in other years?
- AT&T and Verizon are conspicuously absent from the list of companies that
certified FKWL modems. Comments?
- Sprint accounts for 59% of sales. I really don't like that much
concentration, especially in Sprint, which is IMHO a very erratic and not well
managed company. Sprint purchases may explain the huge jump in 2010 while
margin dropped. It's also possible that A/R are at Sprint, which also raises
the question whether that sales channel is still stuffed.
- The whole situation with C-Motech, which still owns 13% of the company shares
is weird. FKWL may have to purchase these shares from C-Motech.

Overall, I think I will pass for now. However, it might be a great buy if they
get another big contract somewhere.

But I'm not sure it's true for the young Buffett. It's well documented in the

ROIBD:

It's a tough call. Like Buffett and Munger say, read everything, learn
everything. But, yeah, there are only 24 hours in a day and there's only so
much you can do in a year. So is it worth it to spend time on something? I am
not sure it just depends on current return expectations.

I think Buffett and insurance is a great example. He spent a lot of time with
Geico when he was young. Sure, he made money, but the big lesson of value of
float in insurance did not sink in for decades. And the lesson of not buying
cigar butts also did not sink in for quite a while. Now he says that he would
have outperformed himself if he bought insurance company instead of Berkshire.
And that's Buffett - one of the smartest investors ever. Would he have learned
the lesson of float if he decided that insurance is boring, does not offer high
enough returns and is not worth the ROIBD? Would he have learned the lesson
about cigar butts if he never bought Berkshire? Maybe.

So analyzing HP may not lead to great returns now either, but perhaps it will
teach the person a lesson, which will return handsomely in the future either in
selecting a great investment or in avoiding a money loss trap.

On the other hand, yeah, perhaps spending half a year on Chinese RTO does not
teach anything additional. You still don't know whether it's legit, you already
know all the possible ways to fake the financials and you know that some of
them are untraceable for you as small investor. So extra day on another
possible fake might be waste of ROIBD.

It's also possible that you spend time on something and yet you repeat the same
mistakes next time and never learn from something. E.g. you analyze a cyclical,
buy it at the top of the cycle, get burnt and then repeat the same thing during
next cycle. If person does not learn, then perhaps time should be spent
elsewhere or differently. But it's not easy to notice this for yourself and
it's not often someone tells you that you are wasting time or repeating old
mistakes.

Still tough call. :)

Positions eliminated: COPJF, HPQ, AMGN, LDRXF, GEOI, GPOR, AAPL
Flip-flop: OXY

The theme of "rebalancing" continues. As markets dropped, I bought a bunch of
stocks. And then I sold some lower-conviction positions. Still not sure
decisions were correct. :)

Fixed income. Not much action, added a tiny bit of MHR-C under par.

Energy. Added my favorites DRAGF, EGY, PMGLF. Also added a bit of MHR and ENI.
Sold COPJF that has not performed very well operationally. Sold LDRXF as low
conviction position. Sold the rest of GEOI and final bit of my top performer
GPOR. Maybe I should have kept GPOR for reminder and long-term cap gains, but
out it went. Flip flopped small OXY position.

In commodities I added some FCX and PKX and bought starter positions in RIO,
TX. All of these are risky due to possible global and Asian economic slowdown.

I continue reducing IDCC position as buyout is not materializing. I sold AMGN
as possibly low return stock. Sold HPQ on yet another reorg - might be that I
sold at bottom, but I really don't know what's going to happen. Sold AAPL on
Steve Jobs' death. This one is a high shame sell, perhaps unwarranted.

Chinese stocks continue to be quartered by investigations and possible new
regulations. Obviously, if China or USA disallows contractual arrangements, US
listed Chinese Internet companies are goners. Still a small bet on PWRD and

What is your current analysis of DLB?

I don't think you had "superficial analysis", but with these companies there's
always a risk of licensee defection and there's always clients playing chicken
to extract the most favorable licensing terms. If you look at IDCC, NOK, QCOM,
etc. there are legal and PR maneuvers that last for years and years. That's the
drawback of licensing companies. Plus the results are usually lumpy and
investors hate lumpy results, so the stocks are even more volatile.

On the other hand, you have potential for upside jump if things go well.
Unfortunately, DLB is closely held, so the sale of the company is probably
unlikely, so we can't expect patent buyout.

China ploughs a new corn furrow

http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/MJ08Ad04.html

From the article:"...China's Ministry of Agriculture has floated the idea that
its moratorium on commercial use of genetically modified (GM) seed would
continue -<u> with the exception of corn. </u>...".

<snip>

"...It is no coincidence that the biggest players in genetically modified seed
are also the world's biggest producers of herbicides: Monsanto, DuPont (which
purchased the venerable hybrid corn outfit Pioneer), and Dow...." ...A
milestone of sorts was reached with the release of "Genuity Smartstax", a
Monsanto/Dow joint effort that piled on six varieties of Bt expression with two
additional herbicide tolerance traits on top for good measure. ..."

<snip>

"...Pioneer, a subsidiary of DuPont, has achieved some remarkable results in
yield with its Xianyu 335 hybrid corn variety.

Development of the variety began in China in 2000, the seed - produced by two
local partners of Pioneer inside China - came on the market in 2005, and sales
exploded in 2008-2009.

XY335 is now the second-most popular hybrid corn seed in China, with over 40
million hectares under cultivation...."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

This would be a big deal if China allows GM corn. I am not sure that DOW's
"Genuity Smartstax" herbicide is the best approach for efficient "sustainable"
production but their GM corn seed and herbicide (w/ Bt expression)
significantly increases production.

With both companies priced at a PE of 12, they make my initial value screen. I
would prefer a more sustainable "technology" solution but I think w/ all the
recent concerns, the industry is taking a more conservative approach in
developing integrated farming solutions. The herbicides now used are so much
more environmentally friendly than those used 20 years ago. The issues now are
due to genetic resistance leading to applications not as effective on weeds.
However, the herbicides now breakdown in days (not years like DDT) and become
inert in soils.

STT/FLS. I am finding it difficult to step up for stocks in this current market
upswing. Given past volatility, I have to believe another downswing is coming,
and it's going to be more that a couple hundred DOW points in a day. And since
everything seems to be tracking together, why buy anything now, when everything
will be cheaper, perhaps much cheaper, in next week and/or in the following
week?

I hold some stocks that I liked (bought) in July/Aug and although these stocks
have moved up recently, the prices are still below my cost basis. I'm
interested in averaging down to lower my cost basis, so I've added a few shares
today to my positions. With a view that I'm prepared to buy even more if/as the
stocks fall back in the next week or so.

Tom, I did say it's something to keep an eye on.

Nice chart on MON.

MON, btw is due to restate earnings due to an investigation into herbicide
sales, isn't it?

MON, DOW and SYT control almost half of the world's seed market for corn.

It's a good op for competitors, isn't it?

re: DAR

Paul,

That's one interesting stock. How did it come to your attention?

I did some background reading. DAR is a monopoly in the rendering* industry. It
also appears they paid off half of their $700m debt incurred in their Griffin
acquisition in late 2010 in just 2 quarters. That says something about the
mgmt. With historically high ROE's, that make the ttm p/e 11 looks very
interesting.

I'm still digging.

re: DLB

When I said superficial, I meant it. My original thesis was light on the
quantitative side. That taught me a lesson...

My thinking was: Dolby would be able to penetrate the mobile audio market just
like how it penetrated the walkman market. At the same time, corporations have
been slow in upgrading to Win7. It's destined to happen. So, I figured that
would give Dolby a stable stream of zero cost revenue in near term in the face
of decline of DVD player sales. I also convinced myself the I should substrate
out its massive cash on the book when I evaluated it. That gave me a rationale
to pay a relatively high multiple.

All of these are still truth now. But what's lacking is a quantitative anchor
for the margin of safety...

I'm still hanging onto the stocks.

The market doesn't seem to think the restatement is material, does it? I
stopped myself out of MON in early August. That was evidently a mistake.

You're right. The restatement is no biggie.

I was thinking that MON is moving too fast relative to its peer group, but
nobody matches them on profit margin.

Hi J Mako -

You might want to look at these companies too. DAR has an interesting story.
Some of my observations are below.

Darling International is Among the Companies in the Agricultural Products
Industry With the Highest Gross Margin 
http://www.fnno.com/story/331-darling-international-among-companies-agricultura
-products-industry-highest-gross-margin-dar-alco-cpo-alco

From the article:"...Below are the three companies in the Agricultural Products
industry with the highest gross margins. Gross margin represents the amount of
revenue retained after deducting direct costs associated with producing the
goods or services which led to that revenue. The higher the gross margin as a
percentage of revenue, the better...."

AG stocks mentioned in the article:

wLv7gF;_ylu=X3oDMTEydDA3OGxkBHBvcwMxMQRzZWMDeWZpVGFibGlzdARzbGsDZGV0YWlsZWQ-

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

<u>Darling International Inc. (DAR)</u>

This one fits in with my AG theme. Schwab's Equity rating on this company is a
"C" - Market Perform as of 10/7/2011. There was a pretty large insider sale in
August 2011 at $15.80/share for 89K shares. BV is 7.35/share so at current
prices the company sells at 1.79X BV. Sales growth over the last 5 years was
18.6%. EPS growth over the last 5 years was a respectable 34.8%. Therefore, it
appears they were able to achieve margin expansion over this period through
efficiency and/or higher end product/service prices.

<u>I do like their high margin business: Gross Margin @ 30% ; Operating Margin
@ 17.2%; Net Profit Margin @ 9.2%</u>. ROA is 13.0% and ROE is 20.5% both
respectable returns. The company has shown good double digit growth in both
earnings and sales over the last five years.

<u>The company carries a lot of goodwill ($3.21/share) as a result of their
$840M Griffin Industries Inc. acquisition</u>.
(http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2010/11/09/griffin-industries-acqui
ed-for-840m.html ). This amount on their balance sheet is almost as much as the
line item for property plant and equipment. I was interested to see if they own
or lease their processing facilities.

From their 10K:

"...As of January 1, 2011, the Company operates over 125 processing and
transfer facilities including the processing locations listed below. <u>All of
the processing facilities are owned except for ten leased facilities and the
Company owns or leases over 60 transfer stations in the U.S., some of which
also process yellow grease and trap. </u>These transfer stations serve as
collection points for routing raw material to the processing facilities ...".

(Note: Substantially all assets of the Company, including real property, are
either pledged or mortgaged as collateral for borrowings under the Company's
Senior Secured Credit Facilities. )

So, they have real property assets which are probably carried at cost but are
mortgage for borrowing under their credit facility. The company has been paying
down this credit facility which adds directly to BV.

Paul is correct that this is a capital intensive business. I see they carry
$250M of long term (Note due 2018) fixed debt paying 8.5% and $300M term
loan(s) priced at various variable interest rates.

On January 27, 2011, the company sold 24,193,548 shares (diluted current shares
by 21%) at a price of $12.70 per share. This resulted in $307M. $140M of the
proceeds was used to pay down their term loan facility (from $300M to $160M).
The remaining reduced their floating credit facility.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------

<u>This one is on my watch list and I will look to add shares below their
secondary stock offering price of $12.70/share. </u>The company still has a lot
of debt at fairly high rates (8.5%). Their recent acquisition resulted in over
a $3.00/share Goodwill balance sheet adjustment which to me carries no "real"
tangible value.

Their overall operation(s) brings more efficiency into the back end food
(waste) processing business but it is not clear to me if such operations should
be integrated with the current farm operation(s) first (similar to what SEB is
now doing on their Hog farms). DAR's network of regional processing facilities
does serve a niche market but does not seem to me to be a growth industry
except for adding new "waste" processing segments like they have done with
acquiring Griffin Industries Inc. and also by building their bakery segment.

<u>Therefore, I am on the fence with this one unless it can be purchased at a
bargain price.</u> If after a year their consolidated operations can book a PE
less than 10x and still maintain their double digit EPS growth, that might
provide a good "value" entry point. Eventually after 3 years of similar
results, PE expansion (reflecting growth rate) might eventually be priced into
the stock.

re: DAR

Hi EKS,

I'm going to spend some serious time on this. I haven't dug deep into its 10K's
yet, as my wife signed me up to participate in a church event and the
rehearsals have been consuming me... So, take whatever I said below with a
grain of salt.

DAR looks like a growth story to me, with strong moats. While it's capital
intensive, it appears its facilities don't required a lot of maintenance capex.
Growing + Moats + Low Capex. Isn't that the holy grail for value investors?!
This is like Buffett's toll booth, but the things got moved around are not cars
but grease waste and the likes.

I read that Griffin's network doesn't overlap much with DAR's. And Griffin is
more profitable than DAR. While I also don't like the goodwill on the book, I
sense strong synergy here. And DAR's track record of integrating its previous
acquisition looks good.

My main concern is its profit is linked to ag commodity and fuel prices, and
this is not in my circle of competence. I still don't have a good sense where
we are in the cycle. (Did you say Ag sector is currently depressed? Why? Would
you mind to remind me?)

Its beta is 1.9! I think if there is any bad news from Europe in the coming
months, we will have good opportunity to buy this cheaper.
