Jeff: congrads on being positive this year - I went slightly negative last week
(the s&p was at .1 ytd on weekend), but most people I know are very negative,
particularly with the drugs and other 'defensive' stocks getting hit.

From reading some of your posts, I have started factoring psr into my stock
evaluations also, although I tend to like the naic evals in combo with the

Hi Jim : Thanx for the reply, I am looking at some value type mutual
funds, and with my wanting to go back off shore I think I'll turn
over the picking to the pros..it would give me more of a broad

hit..but I got to unwind my holdings, to get into the funds,
hopefully I can do this with out to much pain.

Certainly a conservative strategy. I might take this a step further by
selecting the stocks by this method, get a list of them together, then set
price targets 10-15% below where they trade. Buy them one by one as they enter
that range. I don't know if this would work or not, but often you pay up for
quality. This is a way of "waiting for a sale".

The dividend achievers strategy as I understand it is not a value strategy.
Dogs of the Dow is. Johnson & Johnson may have increased its dividend regularly
for decades, but that alone does not make it a value play if the yield is only
1.4%. Unless I am misunderstanding this strategy, there is nothing here to
indicate that the stock is undervalued. These quality stocks, in today's
market, may very well be overvalued. What this strategy does accomplish is to
virtually guarantee that there is no garbage in your portfolio. Thus you should
be able to sleep well at night.

VALUE of his or her stocks goes down, but should not be particularly worried if
the PRICE goes down. Unless you need cash for something, or unless you depend

Paul Senion: <Very Negative? With drug stocks?>
IMO, long term you are right on target, but I was referring to this year by
which I mean year-to-date - from the beginning of the year (1/1/97). I am sorry
if this was not clear.

I was only using drugs (really pharmaceuticals) as example of the industries
that have been mentioned to me as suprising on the downside (or maybe not going
up - as you indicated they have in the last 2 years). Not based on rational
analysis of the numbers - "sentiment", if you will <g>.

The S&P 500 was up only .1% ytd last weekend and average mutual fund is down
around 4% in the first quarter, so IMO I'd expect most portfolio's are down
from their value on 1/1/97 (excluding contributions I am sure since I believe
most $ are invested in mutual funds).

BTW, Merck is not what I would call <down a few points from the high> - it's
trading around 85, down from around 100 - that's a -15% (and it touched 80
which is -20%). Price is around where it was the beginning of the year. IMO,
prices got ahead of themselves, but I expressed that on the Merck thread (BTW:
I am a long term holder of Merck).

Irregardless, long term I agree with your comments - that's why I'm holding and
not folding (actually buying SPDR's) during what I think is a short term
correction.

Jim: Re: <mutual funds>.
Depending on how much you are investing, you might consider a diversified
approach. What I do is have 2/3 invested in a diversified (different styles)
set of mutual funds and 1/3 in individual stocks. I trade mutual funds maybe
once or twice a year - they are the stable, diversified core with average
holding period of 3-5 years (some I have held for over 10 years). EG I sold out
of PBHG Growth Fund (momentum growth) at beginning of year and bought into a
large company growth fund is the only trade this year.

Irregardless, for mutual funds I'd recommend a diversified approach - IMO Peter
Lynch has a good writeup on funds in his "Beating the Street" - and he should
know!

I'd keep the stocks of good businesses if I were you, but that's your choice. I
have a core holding of stocks that I will keep thru thick and thin (see my
profile if you are interested), long term holdings that I expect to hold for
3-5 years and trading stocks that I turn over about 2-3 times per year. If I
really expected the bear market, I'd go to cash in for the trading stocks and
selectively on the long term holdings.

If you want to keep it real simple - like on "autopilot", IMO you should decide
how much in bonds (yes bonds) and stocks. Buy 5-10 year government bonds (not a
fund) with the bond part. Invest the stocks in the s&p or broad market index
fund. You won't have specatcular returns, but around 6-10% per year (pre tax)
and you don't have to worry about too much - including inflation. Just make
certain you do something with the bonds after 10 years <g>.

My opinion only.

Good trading.

Dipy - I've never heard of this method but there are a lot of methods that
work. The reasons I use the methods I use are as follows:

1. It works very well in a bull market.
2. It minimizes downside risk in a bear market or correction.
3. There is a lot of historical data supporting the method and the returns
(O'Shaughnessy, Fisher)

There are a lot of fad methods that work well for awhile but you typically find
out that it doesn't work by losing your shirt. Momemtum Investing is the latest
casualty and IMO Indexing is next on the list. As an engineer, I like to find
methods that are invariant so I don't have to relearn everytime the current
method fails. You get to know a method and its strengths and weaknesses over
the years and just incorporate this in the buy and sell judgment. I'm always
tweeking the method but not making radical changes. This might seem boring to a
lot of people that like adventure but I prefer other adventures outside of
investing.

There are also a lot of very good time-tested methods for investing.
Graham/Newman/Buffett is one. Dow Dogs is another but IMO not with the current
market conditions.

Jeff :

I agree that the "Dividend Achievers" strategy doesn't look attractive right
now when the whole market is so spectacularly overvalued, but I don't think it
is a "fad method". Far from it. If a company can earn more and more every year,
even after putting more and more money in the hands of its shareholders in the
form of dividends, then there is something fundamentally right about that
company!

And we are not looking for shooting stars, mind you. We are looking for
companies that pass the test over 10 years, 20 years or more! In the 1996
edition of the Handbook, there were only about 340 companies that made the
grade, when the cutoff was 10 years. And when it was increased to 20 years, I
think the list had just 60 companies or so.

I think the best way to go about this strategy is to begin by looking at
companies which belong to sectors that are not overvalued right now. Later,
when the market turns sour and everybody is proclaiming the end of the world,
we know exactly which of the presently overvalued ones to pick!

I am very interested in Fisher's/O'Shaughnessy's methods too, but I feel it is
better to have this one as the "core" portfolio and build a portfolio of low
PSR (or high dividend yield) stocks around this one.

Dipy.

Dipy - There have been several articles recently and also a few folks on CNBC
and CNNfN that have explained away low dividend yields. They claim that many
companies that used to pay high dividends have been using the money to buy back
shares. I can't tell you what pubs I read this in because I wasn't interested
in dividend yields. But this is easy enough to verify by screening for
companies that have less outstanding stock than they had last year. So although
this method might not be a fad, it **may** be losing validity.

One of the things I look for is consistency regarding dividends. If a company
doesn't pay a dividend, that is okay. It doesn't have to start. If a company
does pay a dividend, I don't want to see that dividend cut. Cutting dividends
IMO is a sign that management can not maintain the discipline that is required
to pull cash from the business. (Of course, some change in business strategy
may have the effect of requiring dividend cuts, but then I'd want to know what
that strategy is and it's liklihood of succeeding.) And if a company has a
history of increasing dividends (for example by maintaining a steady payout
percent as net incrome increases), I'd want and expect dividends to continue to
increase. "Dividends matter!" - that is my general take on the subject. The
ONLY CLAIM that stockholders have is a claim to dividends (a tenuous claim.).
To suppose that investors are business partners or have a claim to a piece of
the business as partial owners, well that IMO is a useful assumption because
it's a nice way to evaluate companies and sleep at night, but stockholders have
no claim to any part of the business (unless there is a default). That is - you
get a legal claim, but just try to go to HP, if you owned HP stock for example,
and tell 'em you want your share of the business, a nice laser printer say. -g-

I think the "dividends don't matter anymore" argument is more a phenomenon of
the bull market than anything else (just like the routinely high PSRs of
today). When there is a downturn, dividends would quickly become "fashionable"
again. Why, just during this recent correction, Barron's and some other
publications started advising readers to look for high dividend yields, when
the decline was not even 10%!

And talking of this subject, there is a book from Standard & Poor's which I
have ordered from the Moneybook Club (http://www.moneybookclub.com). It is
called the "Dividend Rich Investor". I will post some comments after I read it.

Re: how you can invest using dividends: Very Interesting article in last week's
Barron's: "Go for the Dividends". For example, regarding a stock you bought and
it stayed at same price for 10 years. "If the stock yields 4% currently and the
dividend grows 4% a year, or slightly more than inflation, your $1000 original
stake would have grown to $1612 after a decade" - if you reinvested the div.
And if the stock fell by 50% then came back, "you'd wind up with $1932. That is
nearly double your money, with no share-price appreciation."
May not seem like much especially when the market is booming and you want to
invest every penny you can in appreciating stuff, but in down or stable
markets, it beats a kick in the pants (wallet pocket side). Plus these things
have a tendency to grow to large amounts (real money!) as one's contributions
are made and increased each year in savings/IRAs/annuities/etc. JMO-- And I own
stocks that don't pay dividends and that I hope never do. ;-)

Paul :

Continuing on this topic, again, the authors of "Dividends Don't Lie" have
examined several companies and identified their "overvalued" and "undervalued"
dividend yield numbers. They say that the simple strategy of buying stocks when
they are undervalued by this criterion and selling them when they are
overvalued would generate solid, reliable returns year after year.

For instance, they have computed that if Hewlett-Packard stock gives a dividend
yield of 0.6%, it is overvalued. But if the yield is 1.5%, it is undervalued.
(Right now, the yield is 0.95%). So, if there is a general stock-market decline
now, and HP drifts to the low 30s, the "dividend investor" will buy it
confidently while the rest of the world is screaming, "The market is going
down!! The damn market is going down!!"

Dividends are taxed twice however.
This double taxation was not the case
back when Graham and Dodd and
Buffett and Kahn and etc. were starting
out. Convertibles,
and in general capital equities, have
flourished to evade this double
taxation. So have buybacks.

An argument can be made for simply
buying back stock. In fact, this is what
a lot of companies are doing.
One would not expect this to be
a phenomenon of a bull market -- would
companies turn to buybacks when their
stocks are inflated?

Graham really felt dividends were
a must, because they represented
management's awareness of the company's
responsibility to the individual
investor as well as an immediate
cash return. This is an understandable
position but if one is looking for
total return, one could also look
to avoid the double taxation and
go for the buyback.

Does anyone have the power to
screen for substantial dividend
paying companies in the
midst of a buyback? Wells Fargo,
Coke and other well known
stocks fitting this category
have done very well. I wonder
if there are any bargains left
in the group. (I'm short

Hi Mike :

Two points about the issue of stock buyback. One, companies don't buy back as
much stock as they claim they would (I remember reading some statistics that
companies generally end up buying back only about 30% of their stock that they
originally promise to buy back).

And two (here I am a little sketchy because I am quoting from vague memory), I
have read interviews where people have said that the stock buyback programs are
more geared towards artificially inflating the prices in order to enhance the
profits of the company executives who are paid in the form of stock options...
(I know I am vague here but maybe somebody can elaborate).

Bottom-line is, if a company is not issuing dividends, fine. Then I can use
some other yardstick to decide whether or not to invest in it. But if a company
has been giving dividends in the past and now, instead of increasing the
dividends, claims that it is buying back stock to help me, the investor, I will
take it with not one, but two handfuls of salt!

Dipy.

Coke is probably not as overvalued as people say. Analysis of the cash flows
can get you to $45-50 with pretty sensible assumptions. Why would you short
something to try to catch a 10 point move down, when you know you are on the
wrong side in the long term? There have got to be safer shorts out there than
KO.

I agree. Promises of a buyback are often bogus. That's why you want to check

Dipy,

Precisely why I wish to evaluate companies
in the midst of proven buybacks. Small
marginal companies have taken to using
buyback announcements as a publicity
stunt to support their stock. More often
than not, the buybacks do not materialize.
When they do, they end up not retiring
the stock and placing it in the
corporate treasury, which is of marginal
use to shareholders. Everyone should
be aware of this trick, as you point
out.

Hi James,
<< There have got to be safer shorts out there than KO>>

Yeah, Gilette. I'm expecting a Nifty Fifty swoon as indexing proves a Ponzi
scheme at the slightest sustained barrage of fund outflows.
I imagine apoplectic fund managers desperately and ineffectively
trying to raise cash to cover even more expected outflows. They
got into the Nifty Fifty because of liquidity, and that's where
they'll look when they need cash as well.

The S&P is overvalued historically and logically,So I'm targeting Nifty Fifty
stocks.

1/S&P PE = 1/22 = .045 <<< .074 = Corp AAA bonds.

KO is more so. KO's cash flow multiple is 33.92, and the free cash flow
multiple is 123.98, compared to the S&P's 13.7 and 36. Div is~1%
v. S&P's 2.27. PSR is 7.26 v S&P's 2.36. KO's Net Working Capital is a NEGATIVE
$1.5 billion and its current ratio is around .8 (not that
I think KO's going under). These values are more rich than the non-EtOH bev
industry as well. KO makes the S&P look cheap, which it's not given the
interest rate scenario.

The return on equity of ~60% (indusry's is 46)is the reason Buffett's in it,
though, and who am I to argue. My targets to cover are 40,46 and 48, depending
on the market and other opportunities for
the funds.

While I consider myself a value investor, and am moving more to that realm with
every book I read, I still use TA for entry decisions on both shorts and longs.
Exits and decisions to go long or short
are value-based.

Most N50 stocks are making the second or third lower high in a sawtoothed
downturn as well as hitting 50dMA overhead resistance. This week is actually a
pretty critical point for the market technically. If they move up from here
they've severed this downtrend-- good for the market and I cover and my longs
benefit. If not, I'm ready with the shorts.

I would not invest in Coke now, don't get me wrong. But make sure you
understand the business before you start betting on statistical ratios on this
one. Nothing wrong with ratio analysis, but KO is something special. I think
your free cash flow ratio is wrong, and that is the key to this stock's
valuation. Check that ratio (123x doesn't sound anywhere close - the dividend
yield alone is 1% plus a mammoth share buyback. Its high, but its not 123
times) You also have to look at the growth rate. You might question its
sustainability, and that would be your reason to short, but you've got to
engage that issue. You brought up the issue of Buffett, as you should. Why
would you want to short stocks Buffett owns 10% of? Granted, he said they are
overvalued at the present time. But not by nearly enough to short.

I don't short. But if I did, I would want to treat short decisions the same as
long decisions. Am I comfortable being short this stock long term? Not that I
wouldn't try to cover sooner, but what if it hangs around the 55-60 level for a
while? Then what do you do? Sometimes you find a company with accounting or
management problems ready to crash and burn. That's a short. Or some new IPO
trading at these ratios. But the greatest business franchise in the world,
because it might be 25% overvalued? I don't like those odds. I am a cheapskate
value investor, and I would be all over KO at the 45-50 level. I doubt if I'll
get the chance.

I mentioned that I pick stocks to short
based on valuation, not ratios (I ask you to find
the correct free cash flow -- I bet most
people don't kow they're working with
negative net working capital, either).
But I ENTER based on technical analysis.
KO could go up or down. The odds are down,
technically, but that's what buy stops
are for. This isn't a long term short by
any means. Research on shorts show that
profitable shorts make money with small
gains, not by waiting for businesses
to bankrupt. The small gains are usually
there for the picking. Another indicator --
if it's mentioned in Barron's as a buy
three different times <g> -- set me onto
Wells Fargo.

What's there to understand about Coke? The
business is a KISS model. This gets
to my value/short strategy. When
people start claiming a business deserves
a special valuation above all reasonable
fundamental analysis (because
of the "franchise", because there's so
little institutional ownership for
a big cap growth stock, because Buffett's
in it, because global expansion will
provide endless opportunity, because
ROE is so damned high, because it's
nearly a monopoly, because Buffett's
in it...), that's a short, IMO.

I just read a bunch of Graham, and he doesn't
deal with shorts (I assume it would
be "speculation"), but EMT isn't all
that its panned to be either, IMO.

Just trying to think independently,

A word on cash flows:

<< I think your free cash flow ratio is wrong, and that is the key to this
stock's valuation. Check that ratio (123x doesn't sound anywhere close - the
dividend yield alone is 1% plus a mammoth share buyback. Its high, but its not
123 times)>>

Cash Flow typically refers to operating cash flow.
Free Cash Flow refers to Operating CF + other net cash flows (Investing CF +
Financing CF + exchange rate effect)

In Coke's case,

Operating CF $3.5 B
+ Investing CF ($1 B)
+ Financing CF ($2.1 B) -- this includes 1.4 B in stock purchases
+ ER effect ($ 45M)

gives Coke's FCF of $ 266 million. So, in the presence of
a huge cash buyback program, one might be better off
looking at the operating cash flow (though one should
analyze every aspect of the Cash flow). In
a company whose outstanding shares keep increasing, we'd
want to look at the investing cash flow to make sure
the Free Cash Flow isn't being overly inflated by
either the selling of shares or other investment activities not
related to the company's operating status.

This is a Buffett company, no doubt. High return on
equity, and it is plowing its cash flows right
back to the shareholder in the form of a steady
buyback. It hedges its overseas operations to maintain
a fairly stable Exchange effect. This thing is
fine-tuned, well-run. What we should look for in
a company as value investors.

One interesting screen is to look at _actual_ buybacks plus cash dividends.
Exclude banks and utilities, and the top "yielders" are sometimes surprising
(Jostens: dividends 4.2%, buybacks 4.5%), sometimes obvious (MO: div 4.8%, bb
3.3%, AMB: div 5.2%, bb 4.4%).

Buybacks seem better for the taxable investor. Conversely, I'd argue that high
cash dividends are better for the tax-free or -deferred investor, as the market
should be pricing the difference into the stock, and offering you cash
dividends at a slight discount.

A word on ratios and figures.

Graham popularized the "intrinsic value" concept, even
gave it an equation:

IV = Trailing EPS (2 X est growth rate + 8.5) X (4.4/AAA Bond rate)

Where 8.5 is the P/E he assigned to a stock that has zero growth.
In today's market, maybe that's a bit higher.

Few use this today, and Buffett never took to it or any
formulas really.

IMO, this is a useful adjunct, though, because it addresses
the P/E issue in a methodical and unemotional way, and is
logical at its heart.

Other things Graham and other value investors look(ed) for:

Share price < 2/3 of Net working capital
Current Ratio > 2 (I like > 3 myself)
Quick Ratio >1
Debt/Equity < 50%
Liquid Value of Assets
Sales growth > 10% annually (read: 7-10 year avg),
NI > 15% of sales
ROE > 20%
EPS growth > 7.5% annually
CEO owns > 20%
Proper use of cash flows -- either dividends or buybacks are best
Peter Lynch: "Buying back shares is the simplest and best way
a company can reward its investors."
Steady dividend payment for 10-20 years without suspension and
growing at rate of EPS
Return on Capital --(Net Income + Int Expense)/Mark Cap-- 12-25%
Too high ROC "attracts competition, and, generally speaking,
it is not lkely too continue indefinitely," says Graham.
IV = or > than stock price

To assess the market conditions, one may want to use
this formula, although I have no idea as to its validity:

If 1/S&P PE < AAA rated bond yields, start reallocating
to cash/bond equivalents, always staying at least 25% in equities.

These ratios largely reflect the quantitative aspect of a stock.
These are not meant to be rules, but rather a base of knowledge
to use to evaluate various aspects of the company. Graham did
set down some rules later in his life.

Buffett, esp. starting with AMEX I believe, modified his methods
to include qualitative aspects. Other than recognizing
blatant monopoly situations, most of us cannot evaluate management
well up close and personal like Buffett.

So we can rely on ROE, ROC, dividends/buybacks,CEO ownership
to reflect on management to an extent. Inconsistencies such
as unfulfilled buyback promises, frequent number restatements,
insider dumping before bad PR, etc. can also be used. I just
dumped a stock that didn't fulfill a buyback promise.

Just IMO,

Mike

You are misunderstanding what free cash flow is. You are correct to start with
operating cash flow, which is 3.5 billion. And you are correct to take out
capital expenditures. Where you go wrong is taking out financing cash flows. If
that is negative, that represents dollars going TO shareholders. It should be
obvious that it should not be deducted. It is hard to explain the error, but I
will give you the two ways of calculating free cash flow. This is not my
opinion, it is textbook finance. Just think about what free cash flow is - the
dollars left over from the business after necessary investments in the
business. Dividends and share buybacks are not investments in the business,
they are just what you do with the "left-over" (i.e. free) cash flow. I would
be happy to go through this further if necessary because it is not an easy
concept, but it is absolutely critical when looking at companies like Coca Cola
or Philip Morris (and many others).

There are two ways of calculating free cash flow:

Cash flow from operations - capital expenditures

Or in the case of companies like KO that pay out all excess cash flow to
shareholders

FCF = Dividends + Share buybacks

For KO, either of these is well over $2 billion. I wish I had the numbers in
front of me, but my purpose here is just to correct an obvious
misunderstanding. Don't take it personally, I've learned a lot from your posts
on how to look at shorts. Its not the long term, its the short term as long as
you have stops in place. I really think that is the purpose of these message
boards - learning from each other. I am a finance guy, but I will admit I am
just graduating business school (will start working in May at a value investing
firm) and have much less real investment experience than many of you. I am
eager to learn some technical analysis and screening techniques. I am on
another board where all people do is post their opinion, and when it is
challenged they get defensive. We have a good thing going here on this board,
and we can all learn from each other if we respect each other and each of us is
here to learn and exchange ideas, not to put other people down.

Thanks for the correction. I meant to be more emphatic that
what I presented didn't make sense if one was looking
for an accurate representation of the business's health.

MarketGuide calculates Free cash flow differently, resulting
in a number that is much lower. I had thought they were including
Financing cash flows, but now that I've used a calculator, they
are not. I am not sure how they calculated it, but their number
comes up on my end-of-day service as well.

Since I believe MarketGuide sells fundamental data to screening programs, I
wonder how much of the FCF figures out there in investing resources and
screening tools are calculated differently? Is this another
reason to be wary of screening figures?

At the very least, it's a reason to analyze the cash flows
breakdown.

Re: KO, they paid out 1.25B in dividends and 1.4B in buybacks
in 96, offset by 542M in new borrowing. In KO's case,
FCF does not equal Dividends + Share buybacks, but rather
KO holds onto a little over 300M. In any case, these are
actually peanuts given Coke's current market cap.

Lets get free cash flow straight once and for all. It is not what the company
holds onto. It is what the SHAREHOLDER gets. If the company is not paying it
out like KO, you might look at it as what the shareholder would get if he or
she ownned the whole company, but this is not as valuable as a company like KO
or MO which pays out all of its free cash flow immediately to shareholders. The
point is, dividends and share buybacks should NOT be deducted. Any screening

Free Cash Flow Defined by William Pike, author of Why
Stocks Go Up (and Down):

Free cash flow is the cash flow from operations that the
company is free to spend on whatever it wants after it
has met its basic survival needs of debt repayment,
maintenance-level capital expenditures, and POSSIBLY
preferred dividends.

Some investors or financial services might define free cash
flow SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY, perhaps not deducting preferred
dividends because failure to pay the preferred dividend cannot
cause the company to be declared bankrupt; or perhaps excluding
maintenance-level capital spending, because it is not a
contractual obligation like debt repayment; or perhaps
including or excluding some other minor items. But
the concept of ree cash flow -- cash that can be
used at the management's discretion after all requirements
have been met-- should be clear.

Uses of free cash flow include : increase capital spending,
dividends, repurchase company bonds/pay debt, hoard cash,
repurchase the company's outstanding preferred or common
stock.

*******************************

I'm an MD, not an MBA. I learned what I know from books.
This book is one of them. Hence, this is the definition
of free cash flow I go by. Notice that stock buybacks
and dividends are uses of free cash flow, but not
equivalent to free cash flow according to this
definition. Your definition you learned in
business school is evidently different. The one
in this book looks like the one MarketGuide uses,
which is what many professional investors use.
Your definition makes sense, but it's just not what
I learned. Sorry for the confusion.

KO's free cash flow from the 1996 10-K is:
Cash from operations $3.5 billion
less: capital expenditures $1.0 billion
= Free Cash Flow $2.5 billion

If your screens say anything different, then stop screening for free cash flow
because its giving you bad numbers.

stocks that are "too high". They seem to have a tendency to stay high or go
higher. Seems to me that shorting for low point gains (small % drops) is iffy.
I don't buy for small point increases (small % gains) because I tend to think
of short term price swings as mostly random events. But if there is a study
that shows small point gains are the way to short, then I would maybe have to
defer to the "experts". One thing I am interested in, but have not pursued, is
shorting stocks where all the bad news is out, the stock is heading for
bankruptcy, and the stock has declined from - say 10 to 2. Can money be made

Hi Mike - SGI (Silicon Graphics) just had a major train wreck. IMO its the
classic Fisher glitch complete with the howling, gnashing of teeth and other
generic vitriol that currently pervades that thread. I work in both computer
graphics and database management and so I'm quite familiar with SGI, the
competitors, and their position. I made good money on SGI in years past selling
out when the last product cycle was coming to a close in '95. In the past 6
months they have completed the reengineering of their entire product line and
production is ramping up. They also swallowed Cray around this time last year
which has been difficult short-term. There are a lot of other complex issues
here but if anyone is interested in discussing it on this thread, let me know.

10% of my portfolio is in SGI and I'm planning to double my position. PSR is
0.77 based upon last year's sales and current price. I didn't compute a number
based upon the last four consecutive quarters but it will be quite a bit lower.

The last two stocks that I found that were this good were AMAT which went from
20-something to currently around 50, and APCC which I bought at 9 and sold at
27.

Jim Garrison: Thanks for this post. Very interesting. And nice to see a couple
of "my stocks" listed.

One I own but do not necessarily recommend, is HSB.

Hartford Steam Boiler is basically an insurance company, insuring guess what?
and whose competitive advantage (maybe) is that they are proactive in working
with their clients. The company employs engineers who "help manage risk and
solve operational problems".

Revenues have declined in '96 as they experienced difficulties with an
environmental services subsidiary; and there's been some defection of customers
in their core business. At least one insider has been a consistent seller of
the stock (1996).

Just as you might at first suspect with such a company, it's been around for
years (actually more than 100), and it's not in a fast growing business.
Business is never booming ;-) .
IMO, they seem to try different things which build to and on their core
strengths. (But again, IMO, such efforts really haven't changed the importance
of their core business to the bottom line.)

So here's what I like:

Stock now at 46.5. It's traded over 50 every year since 1989.

Dividend is about 5%.

Dividend has been raised every year for past 30 years

The stock was recommended in "The Dividend Rich Investor" (Tigue and Lisanti,
1997). I've not come across anybody else that I can recall with a favorable (or
unfavorable)opinion about the Co. Poor li'l ignored company- well here's where

Jeff-
You may be correct about SGI at this point. I did a similar calculation on DGN,
and bought ten days ago at a P:S of 0.5. Even with the recent price pop, I
think the ratio has not moved much because the revenue has increased. I
recognize that SGI and DGN are not totally comparable, but take a look.

With SGI, I'm interested at this price. I'm a little confused about their buy
of Cray - it seems that they sold off the Cray server business built on SPARC
to Sun, and they kept the rest. The MIPS business had looked to be a liability,
but with Nintendo driving volume, not so. I've had this generic concern about
the time when SMP might overtake their floating point strategy, but I'm not

Salomon Brothers analyst John Jones downgraded Silicon Graphics Inc to hold
from buy. He cited SGI"s lower than expected third quarter earnings, and noted,
"This is the fourth consecutive major shortfall by SGI in the last year." FY 97

Soundview kept Long and Short term holds. Cut FY 97 from 85 to .49.
Cut FY 98 to 1.43 from 1.53.

*********************

My thoughts:

They're keeping costs and R&D steady. The earnings fluctuations
seem to be a function of revenues. The tiny margins and ROE
seem to me to deserve a low PSR. What do you think? How will
they increase their margins?

One other issue. SGI doesn't have the "planned obsolence"
going for it. I mean, once you've invested a huge amount of capital in the high
end workstations, do you really NEED to upgrade, ever?

How is its market expanding? It's already 50% overseas, and
without a planned obsolence or new uses for the products,
how will they expand revenues?

Looking forward to your analysis,

Mike

Thank you, Michael

They have been giving away the software Wavefront with their workstation at
$25,000 total. However, the Cray strategy is multilevels of products, from
workstations to Mainframe. For automobile designs, they have not been diligent
to port software to Cray yet. Any large scale design should be ported to Cray
to increase sales. Takes time to impliment, but easy fix.

You are back to value analysis. Appreciated your input.

Reginald Middleton: I like that you have a well thought out model and are able

Microsoft. That's good. I like that you use EVA - I look to buy companies that

I notice that you use EVA - in the posts I have read - without acknowledging
that this is a trademark name. Also, your efforts imply that investing is
difficult or something more than a pencil and paper exercise - we need models,
and a "retail version" thereof. (This seems overly complicated to me
(especially in screening stocks), and Ben Graham says it shouldn't be
complicated.) Basically, I believe any co with a 20% ROE will be earning its
cost of capital and creating economic value. Your conclusion that "earnings do
not count" goes against my empirical experience. I'll stick to what the battle
scarred veterans say is the way to go. Not able to change my paradigm based on

Thank you for the complement. I refer to EVA in some of the postings in SI, but
not in my models. I use generic terms or my own proprietary terms (and
methods), depending on where in the model you are looking.

<Also, your efforts imply that investing is difficult or something more than a

I disagree with Ben Graham when it comes to technology, it is not always that
simple (if that is truly what he said), but the lay person is more than capable
of accomplishing it. Surgery is not simple, neither is rocket science, and I
bet that your profession is not "simple" either. It takes time and work to be
able to defeat other"smart" people in the quest for capital (which is what
investing is - a competition for money). There are a lot of other well learned
individuals out there looking for YOUR money to add to thiers.

<I notice that you use EVA - in the posts I have read - without acknowledging

I don't think that I am obligated to indicate that EVA is a trademarked name in
the posts that I make on SI just to use it. I noticed that you used the term
Microsoft without acknowledging that this is a trademarked name! It works to
the same effect.

<Basically, I believe any co with a 20% ROE will be earning its cost of capital
and creating economic value.>

This is simply not true, and I have given several example of it. ROE is an
accounting measure which leaves out a lot of parameters, and may not create
value for the debt investors or may skew returns for equity investors. It is
not complete. In addition, the cost of capital can simply be above 20% which
invalidates your point (high interest rates combined with extremely volatile
equity as compared to the broad market).

<Your conclusion that "earnings do not count" goes against my empirical
experience. I'll stick to what the battle scarred veterans say is the way to
go>

That is what the majority of investors say, also worthy of note is that the
majority of investors underperform the broad market over time. I am not going
into why (there is a lot of conflicting theory here), but a likely component of
the reason is that they "follow the crowd" so to say.

Thank you for your comments and criticisms.

Hi Paul - and everyone else who is interested in SGI. I put together a pretty
comprehensive post with some historical perspective on the company.

Regards
Jeff

Summary
When everybody hears about Silicon Graphics, the first thing that comes to
mind is the graphics in Jurrasic Park, Independence Day, or the latest hot TV
commercials. But because of their historical dominance as a computer graphics
system manufacturer since the mid-80's, they are one of the most misunderstood
high-tech companies today. Just for starters, here are a few facts. SGI is
the leader in the development of high-performance computers for generating
computer graphics. SGI is the second largest manufacturer of microprocessors
in the world - second only to Intel. SGI is the only computer manufacturer
that has a full product line of computers ranging from $6,000 desktops to
multi-million dollar supercomputers. Here is a few of my opinions. SGIs new
product line which is now completed and is entering full-scale production will
likely challenge Sun's (SUNW) and Hewlett-Packard's (HWP) dominence in the
Unix server market which is growing at 45% per year. The new graphics system
will effectively challenge the Wintel graphics systems that have been on the
market for the past year.

Background
I want to give you the perspective from which I am writing. As we are all
aware, there is a lot of rumor, speculation, and general garbage on the web.
Most of you folks on this thread are aware of my past picks but I thought this
section was in order to lay the ground work for my recommendation of SGI as a
great value stock.

I am an engineer twice by degree and a consultant of 15 years. The mantra of
my work is high-performance computing which covers two primary areas: visual
simulation which includes flight, driving, and air traffic control tower
simulators, and work with commercial database products on Oracle DBMS
(database management system). Most of the work involves software development
of some sort and consulting. My current and past customers over the past
several years include USAF, NASA, FAA, DFAS (Defense Finance and Accounting
Service) on the government side and National City Bank, Nationwide Insurance,
and Chemical Abstracts Service which are based in Columbus, Ohio where I am
located. I typically work with middle and upper management in organizations
to solve their problems from an engineer's perspective.

I started working with SGI products around 1987 for visual simulation. In
recent years, I have been watching SGI gradually move into the commercial
sector by targeting the rapidly growing database server market which is being
fueled by corporate rightsizing and the internet. As part of the corporate
rightsizing process, many companies are moving from the traditional main frame
computing environment to more flexible and cost effective client/servers. To
support on-line commerce and information services, companies are building
entirely new systems to support the internet which is growing at about 100%
per year. Because my business strategy has overlaid SGI's strategy, I believe
I have a good perspective on their past, present and future as a lot of people
do not since they do not span both of SGIs markets. Sharing similar
strategies has been purely coincidental.

Things I'm not going to discuss
I'm considering SGI as a value play from the standpoint of Ken Fisher's book
"Super Stocks". If you want a better understanding of SGI's current woes,
just read the first two chapters. I've been using this method of stock picking
successfully now for about 5 years and SGI fits Fisher's model better than
just about any other stock I've been involved with. So I'm not going to get
into discussions on PSR or PRR here.

I'm not going to discuss details about the financials since you can get these
from Value Line or for the 10K and 10Qs on Edgar. SGI also writes a lot of
computer software through its subsidiary Alias|Wavefront which is discussed in
the annual report.

There is also a nice document that I'd strongly recommend you read at

reality.sgi.com/ariel/sgi-myths.html

This is an document generated by some folks at SGI that decided to do
something constructive about all of the company misrepresentation by the
media. It does get somewhat technical but I think its useful to anybody who
would consider buying the stock. I'd say its about 85-90% accurate bearing in
mind that it is an insider's point of view.

The press releases for the current earnings tell you the numbers but not the
story behind the numbers. I was feeling a bit queasy after hearing the latest
quarterly results but based upon the conference call, I've turned rationally
exhuberant on the stock. You can hear a replay of the conference call through
probably next Saturday at 800-964-4428. It lasts about 2 hours.

Here's the current situation
On Thursday after the market closed, SGI announced between the 5 and 7th
consecutive earnings disappointment. This had about the same effect as a
cesspool explosion on shareholders. The price already at its 52-week low of
$17 on Thursday closed Friday at around $13. The ACE was 27 cents and they
turned in 6 cents.

Analysts have lots of egg on their faces. So do instituational investors and
all the TV pundits. Shareholders are madder than a wet hen. Everybody hates
management. This was supposed to be the turnaround quarter. Or to quote
Fisher: "They'll bitch at the glitch".

Here's the story
So why am I so hot on SGI? Lets do the history leading up the current
debacle. SGI revenues and earnings had grown at a phenomenal rate since the
late 80's. Revenues have grown at an annualized rate of 45% since 1987 through
1996. The stock corrected during the recession in the early 90's because they
became overvalued in my opinion. Their product line which had already been on
the market for 3 years dominated the graphics market. By 1995, that line was
starting to see challenges from Windows NT computers and other Unix
workstations. I think this was more media hype than reality however.

A lot of other changes were happening during the same period. The internet
just started to explode. Companies were starting to jump on the rightsizing
bandwagon. Sun, HP and Wintel got the lion-share of this market. There were
a few reasons why SGI didn't participate. First there was the perception that
SGI is only a graphics company. There was some truth to this. Second, I
think they still had a small company mentality. Third, marketing didn't have
experience in this arena. The new markets were outside of their traditional
graphics market.

However during this period, SGI realized that the features that make a
high-performance graphics system could also make a high-performance business
system
with some tweeking. In 1995, I saw the first SGI machines placed as database
servers. These were still the old generation machines but they outperformed
best offerings of both Sun and HP. The problem was that they were more
expensive than the competition. Customers chose SGI because of the
scalability feature which in the long-term is the low cost solution. Neither
Sun or HP can scale as well as the older SGI systems.

The scalability issue is simply this. In a rapidly growing market like
internet commerce, it is not unreasonable for the system requirements to grow
by a factor of 10 in 1 year. Just look at amazon.com, or even the popularity
of our very own Silicon Investor site. The customer has 2 choices. Buy one
machine up front to handle capacity for the next 3 years, or buy a machine
that can be added on to incrementally as demand grows. But in the first case,
that might require purchasing a $5M machine and have it underutilized for the
first 2 years. Another solution is to keep adding smaller machines and spread
the load. But this leads to high maintenance costs and reliability problems
and might not be practical database application. The ideal solution is to
provide a system that one can add microprocessors, memory, and disks
incrementally to get the necessary capacity. Sun and HP can do this but
because of their inherent design, can only do so cost effectively to perhaps a
factor of 10 to 15. Wintel isn't even a player here. Because of SGI's
design, they were able to scale by a factor of about 50 and in my opinion
thats how they got a lot of their server business in 1995 and 1996. In the
fiscal year ending last June, it was 7% of their total revenues but they
landed customers like AOL so they proved the concept. I was aware of the
purchasing of two big SGI systems here in Columbus.

In the mean time, SGI starts to transform internally from the small company
mentality to a large one. In 95, marketing and sales gets shaken up. The top
guy gets thrown out and there are a lot of promotions from within. In my
opinion, the company got a bit complacent because their market didn't have a
lot of serious challengers. So this was a good move. Also, the marketing
budget tripled between 94 and 95 and doubled again between 95 and 96.
Superimpose this over 45% annual revenue growth rates.

So SGI takes off designing their new product line in early 96. The goals are
scalability, performance, and more competitive cost across the entire product
line.

Now comes the first big hit. Around this time last year, they bought Cray,
the world leader in supercomputing. Paid cash over several quarters. In the
past, SGI had a good relationship with Cray using SGI boxes to "front end"
Cray's supercomputers. Its another story as to why Cray wanted to be bought
out by SGI but in my opinion it was a brilliant strategic business move. It
would make SGI the only computer company in the world to have a full line of
computers ranging from desktops through supercomputers. SGI could also use
some of Cray's technology to make their lower machines even faster.
Investor's howled because the writeoffs led to a quarterly loss. Bear in mind
that through this entire process, SGI made money Pro Forma every quarter which
is pretty impressive.

This lead to the second big hit around the middle of last year. Tom Jermoluk
(TJ) the President and COO leaves the company. He was with the company for 10
years and it caused yet more uncertainty about the destiny of the company. Ed
McCracken who was chairman of the board assumes Jermoluk's role. Meantime,
there is an endless barrage in the media about how Wintel spells the end of
SGI. Since the high of around $45 in the summer of 1995, the stock price has
tumbled to a low of $17ish. Things look bleak. More missed earnings
estimates. An endless trail of "one time" writeoffs for Cray and high R&D
costs are the culprits.

In the fall of 1996, their first reengineered desktop graphics computer, the
O2 is released. Everybody loves it but now manufacturing fumbles and can't
get enough of them out the door. More missed earnings. The O2's performance
is impressive and hailed the "Wintel killer" by trade publications. A fully
loaded system costs around $6,000 which is well below the price tag of a
comparable Wintel box.

Early this year, the mood among investors starts to change for the positive.
They know that the end of the new development cycle is near and that Cray is
pretty much digested. They are cautiously optimistic about the new products
even though only one of four is on the street. A few brave analysts tepidly
recommend SGI as a buy. Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs recommends
Microsoft and Intel along with that laggard SGI. Stock price runs up to $28.
Fidelity goes on a buying frenzy and raises its stake to 6%. Capital
Management joins in and buys 8.6%. Zacks even upgrades the stock to a 3
(neutral).

March comes in like a lion... McCracken in an informal announcement states
that due to the strong dollar overseas, and a manufacturing delay of the new
Octane higher end workstation that earnings would be materially affected.
Fidelity starts to sell along with others and the stock prices plummets back
down to $20 in a few weeks. Speculation abounds. Price drops to $17 early
last week. I even jump in and buy more which brings my average cost down to
$24. Then we get the latest earnings news.

The Conference Call
Having quite a bit of confidence in the company since I really did my
homework, I started thinking that perhaps I had made a major error. So I
listened to the conference call to see if it was Merrill Lynch that was going
to bring the tar and Morgan Stanley the feathers for McCracken, or vice versa.
But I actually listened to the whole thing in its entirety and remain very
bullish on the stock. Here were a few key points.

1. They missed earnings so significantly because of the manufacturing delay of
Octane. They stated that in the past few quarters due to manufacturing timing
that it was not unusual to generate 80% of the revenue in the last month of
the quarter. Even so with 8 days of Octane production in March, they shipped
1150 units.

2. Over 20,000 O2 systems were shipped by mid February which in my opinion is
very good. They stated that shipments of that new system were significantly
higher than any other system in the company's history.

3. 368 new employees were added during the quarter and employee turnover for
the year was <10% compared with 25% for silicon valley. This dispells the
rumors that morale at SGI was bad.

4. International business was soft across the board. France and Japan both
have economic problems. Sales in Germany were sluggish, UK was strong. US
was very good.

5. Backlog was down to $709M from $745M(?) Sequentially and they expected to
ship about half the backlog this quarter. Apparently unlike the semiconductor
equipment industry, big backlogs are not a good sign of health according to a
discussion during the conference call.

6. BTB for the entire company was 0.94 and excluding Cray was >1.

7. All of the new products (O2, Octane, Origin 200, and Origin 2000) were out
of R&D an in manufacturing. O2 was at full scale production and everything
else would be ramping up to full-scale production during the quarter.

8. Bookings for all of these systems was strong and they also sold quite a few
supercomputers over the quarter. A couple of the big ones was $25M order for
servers by AOL and a sale of 1280 Origin 200 servers to Lockheed-Martin for a
postal service project.

9. They are realigning R&D spending to the fast growing markets which include
internet, intranet, electronic commerce and broadcast applications.

10. The forward looking guidance was very positive. The goals are improved
sales and to grow earnings faster than sales. ACE growth rate is around 20%
but in my opinion it could be much higher. Analysts are pretty shell-shocked
at this point.

11. They stated that the longevity of the new product line would be about 4
years. This is a good figure.

12. While everything else going on within the company, SGI has been deploying
a new information management system that integrates manufacturing, sales,
finance and accounting. My opinion based upon experience with my own
customers is that this is a critical feature to have in place for fast-growing
businesses. I'm not sure what the competitors have but I think this will
make a difference in management's ability to make decisions quickly and
accurately if the system is executed properly.

Why I think SGI is very well positioned
Look at each market separately: Graphics system and Unix Servers
On graphics systems, the media-hyped threat is Wintel. The issue is that
Wintel boxes can outperform SGI's at a lower cost. This isn't true. I'm
using high-end Wintel graphics products and I can tell you first hand that the
benchmark numbers quoted for comparision don't accurate represent real-world
applications. The truth is starting to come out on this. There was a
discussion about this during the conference call. Another way to explain this
is that an identical test program is run on all systems being tested and the
numbers are compared. The problem is that the test doesn't take advantage of
SGI's new architecture so the benchmarks favor the Wintel boxes.

The second issue is more elusive and has to do more with the media hype. I
was reading another article last week about Wintel killing SGI again and it
went something like this... "Intel's Merced may spell the end of SGI's
dominance. The new processor due out later this year will be able to do
"Jurassic Park" like graphics at a fraction of the cost of an SGI machine. "
There are a couple of problems here. First, Merced is not out yet and may not
be on the street for another year. Second, the expensive machines used to
develop Jurassic Park are already 5-6 years old and you can get the same
performance at a fraction of the cost on SGI right now. So what they are
saying is that the hot new Intel chip is going to be just as good as that SGI
machine that everybody just donated to charity. Not a fair comparision but
they are all similar. The other issue is that what is hot in graphics today
is far beyond Jurassic Park and can still only be done on SGI boxes. Period.
They own this market and they will continue to do so for the foreseeable
future. IMO Merced will still not be able to do Jurassic Park graphics. But
when SGI returns to its former Wall Street Darling status at a price of $60,
the media herd will of course speak favorably about the company as in the
past.

So to summarize, the new line of SGI graphics systems (O2 and Octane) will
compete well against Wintel for years to come. The graphics market is growing
rapidly and will continue to grow for quite awhile. Graphics applications are
growing more complex over time. Its a moving target.

Unix Servers
I think this is where SGI is going to grow the fastest. Internet is growing
at 100% per year. The Unix workstation market is growing at 45% per year.
Its dominated by Sun and HP and they stand to lose the most. Who will gain is
both Wintel and SGI.

First the low-end Unix workstations. Sun sells a lot of desktop system to go
with their servers. Because of high acquisition and maintenance costs and the
inability to run Windows NT, I'm seeing a lot of companies buying NT boxes to
replace their low-end Sun workstations in favor of NT boxes. Look at the
recent growth and sales numbers for NT. There is a lot of corporate
purchasing going on. So only Sun stands to lose here unless they embrace NT
and I don't think McNealy will do this.

Now mid-range servers. Sun dominates this market. This might be a
departmental system that has 8-16 processors and supports 100-200 users on
desktop workstations. They may run a database application like Oracle,
Informix, or Sybase. Sun is late in their product cycle and apparently is
trying to improve incrementally. Their long-awaited UltraSparc II system is a
disappointment. I have worked on one and its not much of an improvement over
the SPARC Centers.

Here is where I think Sun has made a couple of major strategic blunders. The
major problem is that Solaris which is the Unix operating system variant that
Sun developed is only a 32-bit operating system. What this means is that you
can only put 4GB of memory (not disk) into one of their systems. SGI's IRIX
is a 64-bit system and has been around for quite a few years. The 4GB memory
limit is a severe limitation for database applications on their systems and
they are not planning to release a full 64-bit version of Solaris until around
this time next year. I know that Sun couldn't meet the bid spec because of
this on the two big SGI systems sold here last year. The other blunder is
that Sun has embraced a design architecture that is far less scalable than the
one used by SGI. See the discussion above on scalability issues for more
info. Neither of these problems are easy to fix. They are going to cost Sun
a lot of time and money to solve and in the mean time SGI stands to gain their
business. The new Origin products are designed to compete with Sun servers
but I don't think won't be proven for another two quarters.

High-end products. Because of the scalability of the SGI machines, I believe
that they are also going to take market share away from Hewlett Packard. I
know that they are already winning some government business away from them.
SGI was cost competitive against HP on their old generation systems. The
latest Origin products will be more competitive.

Product Cycles
SGI has a brand new product line. Sun is making incremental improvements to
their products but SGI just leap frogged them by at least a year and perhaps
longer. HP has good products on the high end but I think SGI can beat them
comfortably in both price and performance. I don't know where HP is in their
current product cycle.

Why I think SGI is a bargain
If you compare SGI with the primary competitors in the Unix server market, HWP
and SUN are both have PSRs around 1.5. SGI is currently around 0.75 based
upon recent prices and last years sales. If you consider SGI's last four
quarters of revenue (we just finished the 3rd quarter), the PSR could be
around 0.5-0.6. I didn't compute it. But anyhow remember that Fisher
recommends PSRs below 0.75 and that for companies losing money. Remember
that during the last two years, SGI didn't have a pro forma loss.

So lets see where SGI has been in the last year. Here is the summary of key
points:

1. Completely redesigned the entire product line to be competitive in price
and performance.
2. Developed new products to compete in the Unix server market.
3. Executed a major acquisition to gain superiority in the super-computer
market.
4. Installed a new management information system to integrate the entire
organization.
5. Made management changes transition from "small" to "large" company
mentality.

I think it is not unreasonable for some to question management's competence
because of all of the missed earnings which has caused the stock to crater. I
think a lot of the bitterness has to do with their handling of the various
situations. Everybody was clueless Cray acquisition occurred until after it
happened. This recent earnings shortfall blindsided everybody. Even Zacks
which is pretty good at predicting these sort of things did not.

But in my opinion I think they made some very good strategic decisions.
McCracken was off on political activism on behalf of the company so I think
his attention may have been diverted somewhat until he took the reins from
Jermoluk. But there have been recent rumors that McCracken was on a short
list of Republicans for a high position in the Clinton administration. I
seriously doubt he'd leave SGI at this point. Management decisions over the
past year have obviously hurt in the short term but if they do pay off, SGI
could get some pretty significant sustained growth in both revenues and
earnings. The problem has been is that the market in general is very short-term
oriented. Remember that through this entire saga, SGI didn't lose money
except through writeoffs for Cray and debt is still not bad. I don't know of
another company that has been able to pull off this kind of "reinvention of
itself"without almost going broke. So now SGI is the best positioned company
across its entire product line and the stock is trading at a PSR of 0.7.

Risks
I see little downside risk at this point. As I've stated above, I think the
new product line addresses customer's needs well. What I see as the risk is
whether or not marketing is able to penetrate markets. Marketing appears to
be making good strides but the real test is yet to come. Manufacturing also
has to prove itself. They achieved full-scale production of one system in
the past quarters and they are currently ramping up three other machines. If
they falter, there could be more disappointments. But these are short-term
problems. So I think this is a very good mid to long-term value play.

Hi Reginald,

Congratulations on the time and thought you've put into this, but I think that
it is indeed more simple than something needing software for a lot of us here,
at least.

Most sophisticated investors already break down expenses. We already know what
increased R&D means, what increased SGA means, etc. We can see if a company is

also already
look at cash flows and how they are used.

Your model seems like it would work well for stable growth stocks,
if there is such a thing. But where is the Margin of Safety should the business

I read through your post, and while I agree with much of what you said
(capitalizing R&D is very conservative, EPS is not the be-all and end-all of
analysis), I do not see why you think MSFT is undervalued. Maybe I missed it,
but I found no valuation result to compare with the current share price. Thus,
while you have argued that MSFT is a phenomenal company in terms of EVA and
ROIC, I do not see the most important step - does the current share price take
all that into account? Often the greatest companies are not the greatest
investments if everybody already knows the story.

Reginald's essential argument is sound, though, in the context of this message
board. Ratios like earnings per share (distorted by R&D) and especially
price/sales (unless you believe MSFT's profit margin is average - which is just
stupid) are going to be relatively high, but that is not in itself an
indication of anything. Like Michael said, I am not convinced I need some
special model to figure that out.

Very nice analysis on SGI and their product line against competition. May I
suggest that Cray marketing has not been analysed. The unknown factor of Cray
team organized with the SGI marketing team, into a unknown combined market, is
the problem of unsteady sales and unsteady performance. Cray market stands by
itself. So far, SGI has not been looking at Cray in the really large commercial
system market. Cray is still in the small supercomputer, computational,
governmental market; that Cray has always stayed. Cray always had feast and
famine, and survived only by national security reasons.

Jeff - great post. I don't know enough about the company or the market to agree
or disagree with your thoughts, but I know a lot more than I did before I took
the time to read your post.

What got my attention was how SGI has missed six or seven quarters in a row. To
a growth investor, this is bad. To a value investor it is good, provided the
price has gotten clobbered along the way. If every analyst loves the stock,
there is no possibility of an upgrade. If every analyst hates the stock, the
next move has got to be an upgrade.

One point I think is missed in value investing is that many investors should
agree that the stock has value; before the market of the stock achieves
liquidity, so that market of the stock can be maintained. To invest only when
no one else believes there is value in certain stock, does not confirm the
liquidity in the stock market. Many value investing end up with no move in
stock prices, because no one else agrees with the reason of the value
investing.

So, if everyone knows the story, the price will go even higher. And if it is a
winner, you want to hold on to it longer. That is value investing. Otherwise,
you will be just a trader.

Arthur - I can give you some insight into the entire Cray integration. The
Origin 2000 is actually marketed as the "Cray Origin 2000" system. It has
Cray's nameplate on the box and has a lot of other SGI components. But actually
I read a white paper from an east coast insurance company that was discussing
Oracle issues on their Cray. They run their entire operation on the machine and
I know that some larger corporations are doing the same thing. So Cray is going
mainstream with the huge computing demands on corporate databases and also
lower prices.

As far as marketing, SGI addressed joint marketing of Cray products in their
conference call. The fired off a list of perhaps 5-7 sales of traditional
supercomputer customers that bought a lot of other SGI workstations as part of
the deal. One of Cray's problems was marketing. Now Crays are sold through SGIs
worldwide marketing network which is a very good thing. The fact remains
however that the supercomputing market is showing signs of recovering from its
slump that started several years ago, but it is not fully over yet.

All,

Re: WHX Corp from earlier on the thread ($16/sh in cash, union
strike with complete work stoppage, etc.)

This co. is undergoing an amazing barrage of bad news and stands at
6 1/2:
http://biz.yahoo.com/news/whx.html
Note S&P's comments on their credit on 3/31.

WHX is approaching a criterion that Graham used during the Depression -- 2/3 X
the net nets value per share. This strategy
made him famous, although he used a diversified approach, not just a few
stocks.

Net Nets = [(CA-CL-LTD)/Shares Out] is now at 9.20/sh, making the ratio P/NN =
2/3. As one observer pointed out "if there is
one rule that exemplifies Graham this is it." In my experience,
the satisfaction of this guideline is extremely rare these days.

Net working capital is 20 1/4, satisfying the Price < 2/3 NWK rule.
Quick ratio is 2.10, assuming 229M in inventory. Graham wanted >1.
I'm estimating minimum Net Liquidation Value at 10 1/4.

It's getting awfully cheap, and it is worth noting that the institutions have
been buying -- over 1 1/2 M shares net this past 3 mos.

This is a very profitable company when the employees are working.
They have been trying to sell or shut down plants ,and have made
a bid for Dynamics Corp of America with its extra cash. Management
is bent on doing what's right by the company, in my view, even
if it means getting out of the steel business and away from the
union. Standard & Poor's seems to indicate that if management accepts
the union demands, the credit rating will fall. The PSR here is
under .2 for the last 4 quarters the company was running.

An update: Premiere Radio Networks, which was growing at 30% yet
selling below book when it was brought up on this thread at around
11 is being bought out for $18/share, or about 1.3X book. Rupert
Murdoch and Milken were large shareholders in this one. Just
a validation that sometimes good things do happen to value investors,
even in today's market.

Market and credit risk is assessed in the costing of capital. The capital
markets actually asses the risk for you and price it in, you simly need to know
how to decipher it. Basically the higher the cost of capital the higher the
market/credit risk combination. You then factor in the risk for the entity as
an ongoing entity (where risk is definded as deviation from expected return) by
performing sensitivity and scenario analysis. This is all done automatically in
the model folowing the paramaters that the user sets.

The model answers that question for you. The current share price does not

I never alluded to anyone needing a special model to figure anything out. But
you do need to have a cursory grasp of cash flows and acounting, "digital"
economics and the flaws in classical economic theory, and the capital markets.
Knowledge of structured products are indeed useful as well. While this may seem
excessive, remember that the guys who put these securities together in the
first place, and the guys that trade them (read compete with you for capital)
on a regular basis possess this knowledge and they did not obtain it for
nothing. What the model does is encapulates much of it and runs the

Reginald,

How to find misleading profit loss statements: there
are as many ways to find these as there are ways to mislead,
several avenues to key in on are accounts receivable trends in the balance
sheet, inventory trends, changes in the structure of expenses (incl. R&D, SGA)
over time, changes in sources and uses of cash flow/income, and management's
statements in relation to the
p/l statement (thank God for on-line Edgar!).

A lot of it starts with knowing the manner in which
the company realizes revenue and knowing the nature of the company's
business.

Margin of Safety: a central concept of value investing
as practiced by Buffett, Graham, Klarman, and others
with long term success. This relates to the extent
an abundance of value exists in the share price, i.e.
what cushion exists against error that minimizes the
downside risk over time? Graham states "the MOS resides
in the discount at which the stock is selling below its
minimum intrinsic value." Intrinsic value is calculated
in different ways by different people.

When I talk about risk, I am talking about the risk
in the purchase of shares, not the credit risk in the the
company. Graham long ago pointed out that in assessing
the company's financial health, one can use its bond
ratings as an adjunctive guide, as you suggest. However,
this does not describe the risk in establishing a long
position in the shares, which is independent of the
the credit risk in and of the company. The level of this
investment risk is key to value investors.

Thank you for bringing your model to our attention.
Several of us will surely find it useful. Good luck.

Suppose the company has practiced thier "misleading" procedures from the
beginning, such as deferral of taxes or revenue. This will not show up on a P&L
statement. Buffet is famous for using deferred premiums in providing low cost
leverage in investing (he uses an insurance company as an investment vehicle).

This, as you described it, is very subjective, and as such has only as mich
credence as the intrinsic value that you assign the stock. Therefore, according
to your definition, the answer to your original question is that the MOS is
about $300 for MSFT.

Risk theory has come a long way since Graham was teaching. Since it is such
broad topic, I will not go into depth, but I will elaborate a little. There is
only one definition of risk in the financial world (deviation from ex[ected
return). This risk consists of several components which amount to the general
term risk. For instance, you cannot use a company's bond rating if it carries
no debt. You guage the market's perception of risk by measuring it's cost of
capital, which consists of many things, but is primarily debt and equity.

<. However, this does not describe the risk in establishing a long position in
the shares, which is independent of the the credit risk in and of the company>

Bond ratings do not contribute directly to investment risk. I use the market's
interpretation of the risk of debt in measuring credit risk, bond ratings are
quite subjective for they are created by a very small subset and not the entire
liquid market. Credit risk does alter investment risk since debt service
directly affects the volatility, and therefore the reliability of expected
futures cash flows, and therefore directly affects risk as it is technically
defined.

< The level of this investment risk is key to value investors.>

You are also leaving out the business risk for equity (deleveraged beta plus
the risk free rate), which measures risk for the equity portion of capital.
This when combined with risk from debt capitalization, contribute the majority
of risk to a company's capital base which can be classified as market risk.
This describes a significant portion of " the risk in establishing a long
position in the shares." Also of importance is legal and regulatory risk, as
well as political risk (most of these are often folded into the combined market
risk equation through credit risk and the business risk of equity after an
adjustment for cash). A weighted costing of the capital incorporates nearly all
of the quantifiable risk in a share or a bond of a company.

As I have said earlier, risk quantification and mangagement have come a long
way since Graham (especially with the introduction of new asset classes, such
as derivatives and excessive volatility), and although I believe he has
contributed greatly with his value theories, technology and research has
brought these concepts much farther.

This model is a tool and not an end all. As for the historical success using
the model, you can review my posts from the past. I have called INTC and MSFT
against popular opinion quite succesfully for the last two years and it has
helped me short NSCP very accurately on both of its 40 point plus drops by
showing its extreme overvaluation. It is not a growth model. In my opinion,
there is really no such thing. A model (should) measure risk and potential
reward, over a varietly of different scenarios and neither of those
characteristics are the sole purview of growth stocks. A model that does not
measure these factors is not a growth stock model, just a poorly conceived
model.

<but just as likely to be devastated by a disruption in the company's fast
growth or a lowering of general market valuations. >

I must assume that you have not looked at the model or you would not have made

What makes the analysis easier maybe is that, at this point it seems to be a
question of whether SGI is or is not a value stock. And if so, can I value it
with the fundamental ratios we have been talking about on this thread? If I can
play it as a value stock, then I must prepare to treat it as a value stock. (in
which I TRY to hold on for 3 years to reach a fair value point. This is almost
always hard because if I don't know the co., I get blown out by the
downs/ups/media/earnings/rumors, etc.) On the other hand, I like to at least
try to keep it simple, so I want to buy companies where I can believe that they
have and will use their strong resources (which may be unknown to the outsider)
to overcome the adversities they currently face (and which the outsider perhaps
does see). In other words, I don't need to become as knowledgeable as you to
make an SGI investment pay off. - I think -g- --but it helps!

Come now, both institutions and analysts have been in love with INTC and MSFT.
Besides, the last two years mean little in this bull market. Darts do well.

To achieve a Margin of Safety you must:
1) Buy when the overall market is low and there are many
undervalued issues
2) Look for companies under temporary stress
3) Search for overlooked stocks even when the market is not
particularly undervalued (Janet Lowe, Value Investing)

I don't want to get into a tit for tat. By acknowledging
that you are one of those that doesn't believe in growth
models, you leave yourself open to the criticism that this
is indeed a growth model from those of us that do believe
they exist.

In sum, it is hard to throw out Buffett and Graham and Klarman and other proven
value investors in favor of any model.

Highly unlikely. It happens, but not with a company with the institutional

Hi Jim,

I agree with everything you just said, esp re: Intel

Graham bought a huge basket (100's) of them. Additionally, the market was
depressed so a higher percentage of the NN's
were just misunderstood. In this market, a net-net would carry more risk, I
would think, because it is less likely to be overlooked and more likely to be
really in trouble. Also, I can't find hundreds to
diversify and lessen my risk. But it's a situation I would
watch. When this same company came out of bankruptcy in 1991,
it rocketed 10-fold.

PSR 0.03, PE 3
Just reported NI up 87% for year to $4.3M
Up to 3.5 from 1.75 on March 24
ROE 31%, ZERO LT debt
84% insider ownership
3 yr Sales Growth has been 17% annually
3 yr Earnings Growth has been 9% annually
Sells at 50% discount to Net Working Capital
Since no long term debt, this is a NET NET ratio of 0.5!

A special net net since it is profitable with a 30% ROE
and growing.

Seems to be in a market that is growing quickly -- China's Ag

Risks include its business is all China (though its a US corporation), among
others. Currency risk. Also, the price has doubled in the last 4 weeks, so may
be in for a short term retracement of some significance.
The management made a smart call re: the rubber industry this

A good company, no doubt about it, selling at 23 1/2 per share.

Selling just under its Net Net. Price/Book is 0.71.
PSR 0.05 (MCap 612M, Sales 12B) owing to its low margins, but
ROE is a healthy 21%.
For such a large company, insiders still own 10%.
3 yr sales growth is 43%. 3 year EPS growth is 29%.
PE is 27, but this does not reflect the value here.
LT Debt/Equity is only 0.33, about the industry average.
Management is determined, with good public relations staff.

I'll tell you what, let's go over the model piece by piece. The term growth
model is more a marketing moniker than a feat of financial engineering. I will
acquiesce if you can prove your point, empirically (that is using numbers and
historical fact in lieu of hyperbole). As for "selling" mine as you put it, the
smaller model is free, always has been and the larger model is quite advanced,
since it prices mergers and acquisions using a 20 year time span and conists of
more than 177 different possible scenarios per company. The target audience
that I would aim for with a $10,000 model with customized coding such as that
is not the SI crowd. To be honest, there are lot of professionals lurking
around these threads who are volunteering to beta test the model (analysts and
bankers), and in the process I am using the oppurtunity to teach those who do
not understand how the institiutions price the securites that they sell to do
so. Yet, as usual the institutions want to learn more, while the small guys
refuses to even look. Have you thoroughly examined the model that you are
commenting on and understand it.

Let us try to answer your questions. What is your definition of value? I define
value as the amount of cash generated, net of all capital expenditures and
expenses that surpasses the weighetred average cost of capital (where the
weighted average cost of capital is the consumamte sum of the financial risk
that the market has priced into the company's capitalization). Then this figure
is brought to the present value, it illustrates the value created by a company
as adjusted for risk on both equoity and debt,as well as cash flow volatility.
Growth, dividends etc. have very little to do with it. High growth simply means
the company is investing capital at a very rapid pace, it does not mean that
they are getting a decent return on that capital. An undervalued stock is a
stock whose market value is below that of its projected economic value as
articulated in present value terms. An overvalued stock is the inverse.

Allen - On APCC, it showed up on a value screen one day on the way down at
about $15. I bought at $9 and sold at $27 simply because it was obvious that
the price was bid up too high. Its a great company with a great future and
definitely the market leader, but they completed their turnaround. I figured
that the stock would tumble after the earnings announcement to its present
reasonable value no matter what happened because the PSR was pretty high. It
was near the middle of my sell zone. If the stock drops to around $17-$19
range, I buy it back as a long-term growth stock holding.

As for finding market leaders (gorillas), I just read everything I can find,
talk to lots of people, and build dossiers on each company I find. Then I just
wait for the train wreck that often occurs when they go through new product
development or the industry takes a hit. Other gorillas I picked up in the past
were AMAT in the $20s, COHU and CEMX. The last two are both small caps and
haven't moved much since I purchased. I also bought KMAG when it was bombed
out.
