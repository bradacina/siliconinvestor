What's the story with GTAT? General solar hate/overcapacity/etc.? But they are
still making a lot of money? And it doesn't matter?

DELL is still a hold for me, but more of a "show me" stock now. I'll give it
another year or so. Might add, but lower than here.

Hi Shane. Look at today's action. Specifically new highs compared to new lows
as opposed to stocks declining vs. stocks advancing. Lots of new lows despite
more stocks advancing than declining.

In my opinion it's not a good time to be looking at stocks hitting new lows
regardless if you are a value investor or short termer or whatever. Looking at
the bottom when the market is tanking is not where you find value.

When the market is in a downtrend, I sell stocks that are hitting new lows. I
prefer to buy at stocks that are trying to regain traction that are in an
uptrend. MSFT, INTC, RGR, CLMT, SDRL, XOM are all stocks that I have been
adding on the recent downtrend. Some of these names have been mentioned here as
value plays.

Jurgis,

re: GTAT: I think it's an outlook thing. Alternative energy - both Solar and
LED - is dying right now, and GTAT supplies tech to producers in both areas.
There's probably concern about quality of GTAT backlog also (possible order
pushbacks).

OK, so I guess the next question is why are you buying it? :) Just because it's
ridiculously cheap on E/EV basis (but the business can disappear...) or do you
have some other insight? :)

It also has a fair amount of cash compared to market value. Is that it?

MET. It's one I'm adding to as it falls. Fwiw, I added more today (Wed).

(Fwiw, because I'm getting many fills I'm not now mentioning many stocks each
time that I add shares -- unless someone else comments about these stocks. If
there's no news out about the stocks, and because I may have already mentioned
each stock here once, twice, or more -- I assume no comments on these stocks by
others means there's really no interest in my repeatedly posting when I am
adding more shares to my positions.)

OT: I'll follow Paulson&Co and Seth Klarman and Tocqueville Asset Management,
and maybe slip in underneath them to start a position in NovaGold (NG). The
company's apparent claim to fame is that it primarily holds interest in the
Donlin Gold deposits located in southwestern Alaska.

The company has no revenue. It says though it has enough cash to get it through
the permitting process to mine its apparently very good gold deposit (Donlin).
How this company could have a margin-of-safety though (for Baupost per
Klarman's espoused views) - is beyond my comprehension.

IF the company ever actually begins digging and processing -- it may take years
and maybe require stock dilution to fund. Jeez.

Otoh, maybe NG is a trading sardine. It seems to rise and fall hand-in-hand
with other gold miners (miners that actually produce gold). So maybe not having
actual production is not a hindrance (for a trading sardine). Also, as more and
more countries seem to put limits or taxes on exports of their commodities, or
otherwise increase taxes on the foreign miners in their midst, having an
apparently large gold reserve in Alaska might make NG an acquisition target for
one of the larger international mining companies.

Anyway at NG's current relatively low stock price, I'm willing to follow
Paulson, et. al. and hold a few shares in my gold miner basket.

Took a beating on GTAT last year, was up 50%+ thinking I was pretty smart, it
was summertime and life couldn't be better- ended up losing 30+% (ha). The
price is even lower now. Tough nut to crack, little debt and a revenue/earnings
grower. I kept hoping they'd suggest a divy at some point. I was more
interested in the sapphire end of their business as it relates to LED lighting.
A picks and shovel play, with what I thought was a lead in the area at the time
,oh well.

SFL is holding a conference call at 10:00, raining again here so I may listen
in.
Jeez, GE has/is sure moving into the O & G service sector. When history is
written, this will probably go down as my best purchase of the market down
turn. Have others up more, but like GE.

cash-sweep agreement with tanker firm Frontline Ltd .The company also raised
its quarterly dividend by 30 percent to 39 cents per share.January-March net

cents a share, a year earlier.Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 40

I/B/E/S.The company accumulated $13.6 million, or $0.17 per share, in cash
sweep from Frontline.</blockquote> --------------------------------------------

Their new Frontline Agreement allows SFL to have a higher profit sharing
arrangement (they call it a cash sweep agreement). In any case, when FRO does
well, SFL gets more money.

Since I have a very low cost basis on quite a few shares, I will start selling
some August $15 Calls to help my overall return.

Stock goes x-dividend around June 7th for $0.39/share.

Closed out position in BG. These were shares bought 1/2012 at $58.67. I did not
want my small profit to disappear so I sold my small amount of remaining shares
and booked my 3.5% profit. I will re-enter at a lower price, hopefully below

lower from my earlier sells. I plan to re-enter these two on another 10% sell
off when/if Greece announces their exist from the EU and we see a huge sell off
in EU stocks.

On the positive side, SFL came out with good earnings (due to their FRO "sweep"
agreement) that added an additional $0.17/share to their results. I sold August
$15 cover calls on half of my shares to lock in an additional 17% gain from my
earlier purchase. I should also receive another $0.39/share dividend. Last
$15.01 +8.53% today on slightly higher average daily volume.

I found another very nice pref share. EXL-B. retail reit. 8%. very low debt.
very profitable and insiders buying a lot of common. so i bought a small amount

also bought more STAG-A at 8.8%. they just had a large issue of common, which
makes the pref even safer.

I am loading up with more and more pref shares. Some experts here are hoarding
cash to protect against an economic fall, but pref shares of domestic companies
are safe enough for me since they pay a fine div.

Hi Gogo -

Re: Natural Gas
(Note: The NG value plays may be in Australia w/ Japan being the big new user)

Two items come to mind from the article.

The first is the matter of well depletion rates BOTH for Oil & NG.

<blockquote>He noted that shale wells not only cost “three to four times” as
much to develop as conventional gas wells, their rate of depletion – the amount
production declines over time, a natural phenomenon with all wells – is much
higher. As a result, <u>the average annual depletion rate across the industry
has risen from about 23 per cent five years ago to more than 32 per cent
now.</u></blockquote>
The actual depletion rates could even be higher than those stated in the
article. We just do not have enough experience w/ these wells in the different
shale regions to know what the depletion rates should be. I do know that many
of the analysts reports I have seen use a far lower depletion rate (making the
NPV of the well far higher) than it really will be, especially in the out
years. Therefore the intrinsic value of those wells is much lower than their
"stated" value IMO.

The Oil Sand projects begin to look pretty attractive as their "strip mine"
depletion rates are calculated differently and probably more accurate. So their
very long "end of life" projections have merit. That's why the value
proposition for Suncor Energy Inc. and CANADIAN OIL SANDS (Other OTC: COSWF.PK)
are very attractive to me.

Second, Japan is the wild card "huge user" for NG causing large future growth
in NG consumption.

LNG Consumption in Japan Reaches Record High in April
http://community.nasdaq.com/News/2012-05/lng-consumption-in-japan-reaches-recor
-high-in-april.aspx?storyid=141871
<blockquote>Japan's 10 utility companies, with no more nuclear power to turn
to, burned natural gas to a record high in April this year compared to a year
ago.Data from the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan showed the
country used up a record 4.56 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas ( LNG
),<u> a jump of 33 per cent versus the same period a year ago</u>. The
corresponding electricity generated from the consumption totaled 70.99 billion
kilowatt-hours, up 2.7 per cent from April in 2010. The Australian NG reserves
will go to Japan. Chevron, COP & HES all have properties and/or JV they are

<blockquote>Japan, the world’s third-largest energy consumer after China and
the U.S., is ramping up natural gas use due to a shortfall in nuclear power
output following the earthquake and tsunami last year.Nuclear power provided
30% of Japan’s electricity generation before the earthquake and now all of the
country’s reactors are offline. <u>The country’s natural gas consumption surged
27% in the fiscal year ended March 31</u>, helping it avoid major power
shortages last summer.Gorgon is over 40% complete and remains on track to ship
its first LNG cargo in 2014, while Wheatstone is still targeting first LNG in
2016, Mr. Krzywosinski said. <u>The deal with Tohoku means over 80% of
Chevron’s equity output from Wheatstone is now contracted to buyers under
initial or binding long-term deals.</u></blockquote>BHP Billiton Discovers
Natural Gas Offshore Western Australia

<blockquote>BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP.AU) said Wednesday a natural gas discovery
offshore Western Australia state could significantly increase the size of its
Scarborough gas field, enhancing its appeal as a potential supply source for
gas export facilities under construction on the coast.....BHP wholly owns North
Scarborough, located near one of the company's biggest gas discoveries in
recent years, held in a joint venture with ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM).</blockquote>
My largest holding is CVX (No. 1 holding). I also have shares in BHP ( No. 3
holding), COP (No 5 holding), XOM (No. 8 holding) and HES (No. 39 holding). All
have plans developing their Australian NG interests.

I think I will build my Candian Oil Sand holdings because of the well depletion
rate argument but I will still focus on those companies that build and operate
the US domestic NG infrastructure. This includes the MLP's that operate
mid-stream operations that process the NG, pipeline (and some rail/truck)
operators that control the intra-state transportation of NG and the utilities
(ie, GAS, ATO & MDU) that have the large underground NG storage facilities and
inter-state distribution lines to deliver the NG to the business and retail
users.

There are a lot of ways to spread your money around to participate in the NG
explosion from the U.S. shale fracking. I am beginning to believe that only
when the rates are really low (like below $2.00/Mcf) does a "pure" NG play
makes sense (I bought XCO at prices below $6.00/share). Also, prices w/i the
industry get over valued (like some of the utilities MDU for examples over
$23.00/share) so you really can not buy & hold but rather you buy and rotate
except for the very large integrators.

I do believe that the overall growth in NG is real and is replacing nuclear and
coal powered utilities. Japan's switch was forced by a disaster. Germany and
U.S. usage is being driven by price and environmental concerns. However, the
undervalued overlooked energy play may now be the Canadian Oil Sand projects.

I see the Greece situation as irrelevant. The loans to Greece have already been
largely written off by the banks and the Greek economy itself is small, so it
does not matter. This is much noise about nothing in my opinion.

I got my first lot's of MGDDY and BG (and others) to a 15%+ discount to my
sales prices already, sure the stocks could go lower but who knows?

This downturn is different than the June/July downturn in 2011 because it hit
some stock groups very selectively (materials, mining, crude, investment banks,
insurance), while other sectors like consumer goods, regional banks,
automobile,utilities and even industrials have held up well.

I think some sectors are way overdone with their correction and could bounce
back strongly. I could be wrong of course and the technicals look weak but I
think there are very good bargains to be had, right now.

<blockquote>Personal Systems Group (PSG) revenue was flat year over year with a
5.5% operating margin. Commercial revenue increased 3%, and Consumer revenue
declined 4% while Workstations revenue was down 1% year over year. Desktop
units were up 5%, notebook units were down 6% and total units were down 1%.
Services revenue declined 1% year over year with an 11.3% operating margin.
Technology Services revenue was flat year over year, Application and Business

Imaging and Printing Group (IPG ) revenue declined 10% year over year with a

with commercial printer units down 7%. Consumer hardware revenue was down 15%
year over year with a 13% decline in printer units.

year with an 11.2% operating margin. Networking revenue was up 2%, Industry
Standard Servers revenue was down 6%, Business Critical Systems revenue was
down 23%, and Storage revenue was up 1% year over year.
HP Financial Services revenue grew 9% year over year driven by a 4% increase in
net portfolio assets and a 5% increase in financing volume. The business
delivered a 9.9% operating margin.
Software revenue grew 22% year over year with a 17.7% operating margin,
including the results of Autonomy. Software revenue was driven by 7% license
growth, 17% support growth, and 72% growth in services. Autonomy saw a
significant decline in license revenue</blockquote>The only growth is in
software revenue... but then Dell had high storage revenue growth (from a low
base).

HPQ is forgiven that "GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.80, down 24%

I don't like GE because of it's huge financial arm, that is generating 6.4B
(~32%) of GE's pre-tax profit. There is also 440B$ in debt load for the
financial arm, which owns assets that are very sensitive to the economy (real
estate, leasing etc.) The whole thing goes for 12x earnings.

I recommend you do a sum of part analysis and split up GE in it's industrial
ops and the GE finance. Compared to mother financial, GE Finance is not worth
more than 7x earnings, imo (look at JPM, MET etc for comparison)

Ge industrial is going to make maybe 13B$ pre-tax or 10B$ post tax profits,
take a 13x multiple and you have. 130B$ in EV for this business. Ge finance is
going to make 5B$ post tax, with an 8x (generous multiple) I get 40B$ in value.
Sum of parts is 140B$. Current market cap is 200B$ -Based on a sum of part
analysis, GE looks overvalued.

Also, GE is heavy into acquisitions in the Oils and gas sector. This is a
cyclical sector that typically commands lower multiples than other industrial
business lines.

Why not by ABB or SI at 12x or 10x multiple, get rid of the tail risk from
financial operations and a cheaper multiple. personally, I'd rather deal with a
somewhat higher exposure to Europe (ABB or SI are European companies but run
their business worldwide) than with the tail risk from the financial
operations.

Yes , the withholding tax is an disadvantage for foreign stocks, but even after
withholding 25% of the German dividend, SI yield is 3.2% while GE is at 3.5%,
not exactly a large dividend. If you hold SI in a taxable account, you get
credit for the foreign taxes too.

British stocks are interesting for dividend investors because there is no
withholding tax for British companies and some pay very well.

Also, if you really are interested in accumulating stock in one company, it's
better buy stock in companies buying back there own shares from a tax
perspective, since with dividends, you pay Uncle Sam 15% (+ state taxes) on
your dividend, which is avoided if the company does not pay a dividend and
directly invest the funds to buy back their own shares.

This assumes reasonable asset allocation skills from management of course,
which is not a given. but with companies like L or BRK, management are also
large owners and buy their stock when it's cheap, while most companies buy back
stocks while it is pricy, which makes the value of those buybacks very suspect
for LT shareholders.

Re: ETF - UNG

UNG is a commodity play where as my NG utility basket of companies include
utilities, MLP's, pipeline and infrastructure companies and a few NG/Oil E&P
companies. For me, it's a better way to pick out value opportunities rather
than be exposed to the NG commodity price directly. I suppose a small
percentage of the ETF "UNG" in the basket might be an option especially when
you buy the ETF when NG is selling below $2.00/Mcf.

My specific company play on that is XCO. Within the "pure" NG play in XCO, you
also own 52% interest in TTLG MLP that I value at perhaps $2.50/share. There is
no one "correct" way to invest in this sector.

As far as entry and exit into the sector, ETF's provide excellent liquidity. My
style of investing is usually based upon a long term theme where there will be
disruptive changes in the industry. This allows for a slow accumulation of many
different companies that will benefit from this change in the industry. Many
time if you are early, you can pick up some nice under valued companies that
fit with your theme.

I believe that HPQ and DELL as investments are pretty much comparable at this

divisions, like the consumer side of the Personal Systems Group and the whole
Imaging and Printing Group.

DELL's balance sheet is still much better, but there is a risk that they spend
cash on bad acquisitions.

I agree that HPQ may have some enterprise advantages, but a lot of their

I think DELL has a chance to regain market shares (against tablet) with
Ultrabooks. Ultrabooks could gain significant popularity when Windows 8 (which
supports touch screens) comes out and turns out to work well and get's strong
adoption.

If they can bring out Ultrabooks for let's say 700$ that combine touch screen
support for simple task and the standard keyboard input for real work, i can
see that tablet's may get squeezed, at least at the high end.

My suspicion is that Windows 8 will fall flat in terms of touchscreen support
but again success is not really build in DELL's price, so i think we have some
potential for upside towards the end of 2012/early 2013 from the Windows 8
launch.

SU-

Here is update on my SU numbers, i continue to be a cash flow/fcf/fcf yield guy
using pretty conservative numbers, i want to continue to stress the disclaimer
that i use these to paint part of the picture, not the entire picture also if
there is any questions feel free to message me, i will do my best to explain my

To concur with EKS, my belief (though not sure how strong) is that there is a
misconception on what the oil sands could potentially be. My belief is that
companies holding assets there are not properly valued.

I like stocks to go down, not up. So hopefully i get my wish here. Would love
to continue to buy SU, CNQ, maybe a few others over next few months.

Also looking at encana, any thoughts?

Hi Bocor. Yes, I am planning on holding ABT through the spin-off. Van Knapp's
concerns about spin offs don't hold up. He does not offer concrete evidence for
his conclusions. If you look historically, spin-offs have outperformed the
general stock market as well as their peer group.

Barron's had a cover issue a few years ago ....."Spinoffs historically have
generated far better returns than the overall stock market, and they continue
to shine. "

NY Times article with same opinion:

http://www.spinoffadvisors.com/rl1106-NY%20Times.pdf

Did you see this article in Seeking Alpha about ABT that argues that the spin
off will be in a better position to increase the dividend.

<Abbvie's drivers will be the sales of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Humira,
which accounted for one-fifth of the company's sales. After the spin-off this
will account for 40% of Abbvie's sales. It is expected to earn $8 billion in
net income this year. It still faces competition from cheaper biosimilar
versions of the drug by 2016. However, management said that Abbott will
diversify its revenue sources for the new company to drive better future
profitability. Over the long run, this will yield to more stability in free
cash flow and dividend payments.

Given the immediate sell-off from the spin-off, Abbvie's stock price will trade
at single multiple valuations with a higher dividend payment compared to its

LEY.PA @ 35.7Euro - i bought some shares of this European mid-cap industrial.
This company manufactures components and systems for the railroad industry and
is family controlled. They have a good track record but hit a earning pothole
due to problems with the business in China, I assume it is due to railroad
accidents there that temporarily (imo) stopped new rail investments.

Faiveley's order book is very strong though, so I am hoping that this is a
temporary setback. The stock has suffered quite a bit already and seems very
cheap.

LEY.PA has a pretty good LT track record, if you look at the money.com link I
provided.. Revenues are up 3x, EBIT up 5x since 2003 while share count has
increased less than 10%. my guess is that the 3/2012 ( Actually 2011) numbers
will show earnings in the 4.5 Euro range. The stock has sunk quite a bit but if
you assume that this is a one time slip, it is very very cheap.

I think it is more than a one time slip and the European austerity moves will
have some impact on their business but on the other hand they are expanding in
the US and have a strong emerging market business, plus they seem to be able to
gain market shares with new products according to the annual reports.

Their order book is greater than ever and that let's me hope that the company
is strong competitor and will put together strong results in the future. If
they come even close to continuing their past track record, this stock is more
than 50% undervalued, imo.

What do you think about MRK? (just based on peer group comps)

I've been buying a few shares today based on its low valuation relative to its
peer group. It pays a high div. as well and has several late stage developments
in its pipeline.

Due to the high heat, I am doing lazy dd. I see where one drug will create two

Argentina is trying to lower its imports to help balance of payments. I don't
see anything wrong with that. This is the main reason of renationalising YPF.
Argentina's oil production has falling and is not keeping up with demand, so
they are importing more oil, which is screwing up trade deficit.

The key to TEO is will they be renationalised also? The current price seems to
think so(undervalued). I will keep my eye on this one.

TEO has a great balance sheet. growing revenue, growing earnings vs current p/e

Positives for MRK are:

+obviously the dividend and the low payout ratio of around 40%.
+Januvia and Janumet diabetes drugs seem to be boosting the bottom line, and
diabetes is only going to be a bigger market as the population continues to
gorge on Big Macs and Fries.
+Revenue has increased for four consecutive quarters and they have beaten
estimates for 3 quarters {for whatever game that is worth}
+long-term debt to equity ratio of 0.28
+beta is 0.62

negatives:

-R%D pipeline is not impressive. High expense and huge risk of failure has
caused Merck {and to be fair others as well} to shift their strategy from R&D
toward acquiring the rights to drugs from other companies.
Some seem to feel they are overpaying. Time will tell.
-LLY's Jentadueto will be in competition with Merck's Janumet; I think they are
fairly similar, thus marketing will be expensive and key to revenues.
-Vorapaxar last year was a bust.
-Singulair is going off patent this summer, and having a child with asthma, I
know how effective that is. Singulair was/is a $5 billion drug.
-Zetia and Vytorian expire in 2017, so for a LTBH investor, that is a 4 billion
hit, with a potential market value hit.
-Its acquisitions have not seemed to make a splash in their bottom line.

Neutral:

They have a potential winner in Anacetrapib, but it's efficacy has yet to be
proven, and Dalcetrapib by Roche was recently withdrawn as the company
announced late-stage trial showed it wasn’t working. Granted Anacetrapib may be
more potent, but the overall mechanism of both medications remains to be seen.
Until then there is a big question mark about the future of their pipeline.

I have looked at it closely as a substitute for ABT, but haven't yet been
persuaded.

Good review. Thank you.

I was looking at a recent Credit Suisse report and this is their view on MRK's
pipeline.

Singulair is expected to drain up to 2% off revenues. Januvia , Suvourexant and
Tredaptive have 45% upside potential over and above estimates of $13 billion in
sales for 2015 and higher for 2020. Same report gives upside potential of 75%
above current estimates going out to 2020 with Setia, Odanasatib and
Anacetrapib kicking in.

Bolivia nationalized their electric co. citing the same reasons that Argentina
gave for its action on YPF, however there does not seem to be that much
interest in that story. Repsol has a large precense in Bolivia and does not
seem to be concerned.

YPF is sitting on potentially valuable assets. I don't think that is the same
story for Bolivian electric.

<u>What happens now with YPF?</u> YPF needs a partner with money in order to
develop its shale deposits and no one will step up unless the deck is cleared.
Argentina is going to have to settle with Repsol in order for YPF to move
ahead.

I think the depressed prices in Argentinian stocks will improve once there is a
settlement and even YPF is worth consideration.

It is discounted because it had preferred shares that had accumulated unpaid
dividends. If TEO had paid a dividend, NTL would have cleared the outstanding
preferred payments (I think) but of course that did not happen.

I do think that NTL trades at a decent discount to TEO (20%+) but I have not

re BNP - I think that industrials in Europe (LEY.PA just being one example) are
a better risk reward.Within European financials, I own AV too and I believe it
(and other insurers) will survive any financial market calamity better than
banks. AV trades at a large discount to book, they have booted their management
(via vote on pay) and based on their current dividend (which may or may not be
safe), the shares yield 10% (no witholding with GB shares is another
advantage).

I think BNP is one of the safer banks in Europe but given the current
situation, that does not mean much. The problem that I see is that the last
liquidity two injections in the trillion Euro range (total) were used to a
large extend by PIG banks (Spain and Italy) to buy their own sovereign debt,
while the French and German banks allegedly have been selling. That seemed to
have stabilized the banks and the sovereign alike but now with both in doubt
again, it just means that the risk is even greater that both the PIG banks and
their debt go poof, and if that happens, owning everything close to it will not
be a great idea. I am not saying that is will (in fact I am betting otherwise)
but if it does, the financial system in Europe will go through a major
dislocation.

FWIW, some relevant information regarding AV.

hmmm. i guess i need to take a peek, because i thought TEO did declare a
dividend and that it would be enough to approximately pay off the preferred
that needs to be paid off before NTL starts getting its cut. OTOH, i saw a
comment recently suggesting that TEO has been selling off more than NTL, and
thus the discount for NTL has diminished. i have only a small position in the

Are you concern that Argentina has grown so much that they are due to a

From 2002-2011 I see substantial growth in GDP and it seems they have done this
with little foreign investment. They are renationalizing YPF to protect and
increase their trade surplus since they are not able to get favorable borrowing
from international markets. Oil and gas imports have doubled in the past few
years.

Associated Press
May 31, 2012

HINGHAM, Mass. (AP) -- The struggling women's clothing chain Talbots is being
acquired by Sycamore Partners for about $193.3 million in cash, an abrupt
turnaround after buyout talks appeared to stall last week. Talbots said
Thursday that its stockholders will receive $2.75 per share, which is less than
the $3.05 per share previously offered by the private equity firm, but more
than double Wednesday's closing price of $1.29. It's also a 76 percent premium
to the closing price on December 6, when Sycamore made its first offer of $3
per share. The Hingham, Mass. retailer has approximately 70.3 million
outstanding shares. Including debt, the deal is valued at close to $369
million. Shares of The Talbots Inc. doubled to $2.58 in premarket trading.
Talbots said Friday that exclusive talks with Sycamore had ended.

I guess at this time you look back at last year, and the horrors we faced
domestically in August/September, the credit downgrade, etc., and the
inevitable recovery we had. Buying then was a smart move.

Europe was not in the wind as much though. Interestingly I heard Mark Mobius on
Bloomberg yesterday, and he indicated in a fairly sanguine way that Europe was
NOT a worry of his; it was a lot of political posturing and there was going to
be an ultimate resolution to keep Greece in the Euro. Not sure how Europe
continues on it's current track, but we shall see.

Greenspan says we have two economies in this country.....DUH....

I think we are seeing the mother of all demonstrations that there is NO
decoupling or diversification by investing in international markets. The world
markets will rise or sink in unity.

re ITRI -
yes we had some discussion on this stock last year. I agree it is cheap. They
have a lot of business in Europe, which was a concern at this time and maybe
now too (haven't checked). They do seem to have somewhat lumpy results with
lot's of one time writeoffs (wrote down a good chunk of Goodwill last year).
Their cash flow generation seems good.

I think your CAGR may be a bit high, they have done a lot of acquisitions in
the past to achieve growth and I would not want to rely on that model going
forward.

Dumping my NEM (flat overall) at 49.8$ on today's fear trade reversal. I think
there are better opportunities elsewhere and I want to free up some cash.
Adding a bit more SI at 80.2$ to my collection of looser stocks.

If you can take the pain, you'll have a gain. At least if you're selective and
patient...

I actually did quite a bit of research on this one about a year ago. All your
numbers are fine, but when I spoke with consultants in the field they spoke of
out dated technology, unable to compete with the new entrants of the smart
meter industry. Most of their new products were cludgy and hap hazard. The
upside was that most of the utilities wanted to deal with them as they were the
"IBM" of the field ie. no one gets fired buying them.

Since then a few IPO's were supposed to happen and didnt and those upstarts
never gained much traction. So I know this is a value thread but I would
investigate thier win/loss on new RFP's and chat with someone in the industry,
if you can find one. If they now actually have a mainstream, competitive
product I think they would be a great find.

Good luck.

Or maybe Argentina realize that wealth acquisition is a zero-sum game. Taking
back their oil/gas company helps them keep wealth in the country. They are also
going after agriculture( main export) that is owned by foreign investors. Spain
is having problems and Argentina has a Oil Field(Vaca Muerta) that needs
development. I suspect Argentina will partner up with a financially strong
country(China possibly) to develop the 22Billion barrels in Vaca Muerta.

I find TEO interesting no debt, high ROE, earnings, rev growth
Mobile(3g/4g)&Broadband is in high demand in argentina. From what I have read
the fix line business is regulated but the growth is in mobile&broadband. TEO
controls northern part of argentina fix line business with non expiring
license. They are upgrading their network to provide triple play services. By
the way, Mark Mobius was investing in Argentina at the beginning of this year.
He is betting on the consumers in argentina.

DRAGF: Iraqi bid is presented in quite negative light here:

here:

ploration-rights.html )

I wonder if they know more than the companies who were absent from the auction
or if they are throwing good money into bad place...

Disclosure: I own large position in DRAGF.

TLB- made some money off of this one, but it was not without some nail biting.
When the deal the sycamore expired and the stock shrunk to 1.30 it was hard to
sleep but I held on hoping a deal would get done. It got done and I will never
do that again.

I sold all my shares yesterday and bought more of svu, btu and gm
