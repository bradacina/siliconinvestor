UST. It was Mike B., I believe. I came to it several years later. As you likely

focused on tobacco, might consider UST as a takeover. For me, this possibility,

thanks everybody. Its been a long time. St. Joe was 12 years ago! I still
remember the night I researched St. Joe my second year at Columbia Business
School. That was my first really good one. And I think i held onto it for a
micropercent of its move over the next decade (and OF COURSE if I had I would
have sold the peak in 2005...of course)

the second rate bookstore was BAMM, which last I looked was about an 8 bagger -
I think I took that from 2 to 3 or something like that, but it took less than a
week. I think it had come out of an index or something and was trading
momentarily at a really stupid price. Five years later its at 18, making the
sell at 3 look pretty dumb!

Anybody remember Saucony? I think that got taken out and I can't remember if it
was Mike's or mine, but you know we kind of tag-teamed a lot of names. That one
buy at 4 sell at 6 - I think that worked 3 times before it went to 20.

Those were fun markets - I don't know where the easy ones are today. If they're
there I'm not finding them. Although one might be the one I mentioned last
night. Don't dismiss that one out of hand - it takes some work to really see
the valuation and understand the business. There was a press release this
morning (which I didn't know about when I mentioned it last night) which I
think you'll find helpful.

BDN and CLI -

I bought some BDN. Attracted to the decent yield (6.2%, and low market cap/FFO
ratio: 11.5). upon further looks however, i believe the close peer CLI may be
better buy:
Although dividend yield is lower and FFO/market cap is higher, the REIT is
cheaper when you take into account the much lower leverage of CLI. Both have
almost exactly the same rent income but BDN has about 3.2B$ in debt while CLI
has only 2B$. Based on EV value CLI is by about 300M$ cheaper and CLI also has
the better LT track record. If opportunity arises, i am going to switch from
BDN to CLI.Differences aside I like both since they have a lot of properties in
NJ,e adjacent to the red hot Manhattan property market. If there is a spillover
into NJ, those REIT's should be doing very well. Both should be good candidates
for a private equity takeout - the valuation is much better than what
Blackstone paid for EOP.

Let's take a closer look at RUSS's balance sheet. it is true that it has about
$2.50 net cash per share. But have you noticed that its book value is a -$3.893
per share.

pcyhuang, if you actually look at the balance sheet and the notes, instead of
cut and pasting from Yahoo, you'll see that the bulk of the liabilities is
deferred revenue - in this case money the company has received in advance of
students attending courses. Once the student attends the course, the deferred
revenue account is reduced and the money goes to cash. At the end of 2006,
deferred revenue was about 127M and recorded as a liability. Deferred course
expenses, consisting of payments to the speakers who conduct the courses, were
about 15M. I'd say that this 127M is a wee bit different than 127M in, say,
Accounts Payable.

There is the not so small issue of whether the financial statements can be
trusted. There is certainly room in there for a dishonest management to play
games with the numbers. Uncovering financial fraud is not really in my circle
of competence, so my rule is to stick with companies that have management I can
trust. However, this is a case where I might be willing to make an exception.

Welcome back James, it's always a pleasure.

CBF. Yes, with this one, having self-doubts is a condition of going into, and
staying in, the stock, imo. :>)

I mean even skipping over the sub-prime issues elsewhere and media reports of
possible spreading loan defaults (now perhaps to some mezzanine loans I've
read), what normal outside investor/analyst can even understand what this
company actually does let alone the risks with its various operations?

"The company's investment portfolio comprises investments in various asset
classes, including whole loans; subordinated interests in first mortgage real
estate loans; mezzanine loans related to commercial real estate; commercial
mortgage-backed securities; and joint venture investments, including joint
venture interests in entities that own real estate, preferred equity, and other
structured debt and equity products. It also invests in various commercial real
estate assets that include acquisitions of real property, net leased property,
distressed and stressed debt securities, RMBS, and CDOs, as well as equity and
debt issued by REITs or other real estate companies. "

Cree--ripes!

And it's a newly trading company, so I don't see a lot of history with it.

It certainly is not a warm and comforting business or stock to me!

I'm in because we can buy at prices comparable to what insiders have recently
bought at. One of those insider directors, as I said previously, I believe is
the same Douglas C. Eby who co-manages the ltb&h Torray fund. And there are
(according to Yahoo) several value players who have positions (Baron, Weitz,
Dreman, etc.)--- one or more of whom I am hoping HAS been able to study and
understand this company, and glean enough to make a proper value judgement.
Evidenced by the establishing of a position in the stock.

Meanwhile, those like me who are tagging along, wait for some positive news
while we collect our 6.8% current div. yield.
Still, it is a situation where FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) can easily
override patience.

Homebuilders. Spekulatius, yes, I'm still following. Have a stub DHI remaining
from 2003 purchase; recently bought SPF and MTH, which now are sharply in
negative territory for me. I have liked PHM for its Del Webb operation and its
possible prospects. PHM is among my favorites and next on my list for a buy.

Just as I played homebuilders back in the '90's up through 2006, I'm looking
again to build up small positions among a diverse selection of companies.

As with previous go-round, I'm buying below book value and hoping somewhat near
bottom, and looking for an eventual turn up in stock prices. I'll speculate
homebuilder stock prices will bottom within 10-12 months (just a guess), and if
they then turn up, I might be in for a possible gain and if so, it could be at
favorable long-term capital gain tax rate (12month+1day holding for USA
taxpayers).

Agreed. I let that one go. First, it isn't worth getting too involved in a
discussion of balance sheets with a person who can't read them - as evidenced
by the response I did get, followed by that ridiculous chart that's wasting
valuable space on SI's servers. Second, even though I'm using $3.56 as my cash
number, when all is said and done, I'm only willing to credit them with about
$2.71 once I net out debt and operating leases. Then there's enough other stuff
that I'm not sure I understand to make $2.50 close enough for gubmint work.

this one is creepy and at least some of the people running it are creepy. So
how big a discount do you want?

That's the question. There's no question that management has treated this as
their personal piggy bank. I don't believe I've ever seen a cash flow statement
before that listed "Stock Gift" as one of the operating items. So, I'd want a
really big discount for sure. One plus is that as an investor I would have some
deep pockets, who have presumably hired some good lawyers, fighting for my
interests. They are claiming it's worth $10. It's hard to know how much of that
is posturing, but you have to assume they think it's significantly undervalued,
otherwise why would they be bothering? Without those people in the fight, I
don't think I could touch it because there would be too much chance of being
swindled out of my money. Given where we are now, I think the current price
does offer an adequate margin of safety. I wouldn't be willing to go much
higher though - certainly not over $5.

Little pop in Pol in asset sale to OXY.

PolyOne sells Oxy Vinyls stake to Occidental for $261 mln
By Gabriel Madway
Last Update: 12:29 PM ET Jul 6, 2007

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- PolyOne Corp. (POL :
polyone corp com

POL8.37, +1.02, +13.9% ) said Friday it has sold its 24% stake in Oxy Vinyls LP
to Occidental Chemical Corp., a unit of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY :
Occidental Petroleum Corporation

OXY59.60, +0.14, +0.2% ) , for $261 million. PolyOne said it will retain the
existing polyvinyl chloride resin and vinyl chloride monomer supply agreements
that it entered into when Oxy Vinyls was formed. In a related deal, PolyOne
also said it will acquire OxyChem's 10% stake in PVC Powder Blends LP for $11
million, bringing PolyOne's ownership to 100%. The company expects the
transactions to result in an overall net book gain. Cleveland-based PolyOne
said it will use the $261 million in proceeds to reduce debt, and as a result,
the company expects interest costs in 2008 to be $25 million lower than in
2006. PolyOne shares rose 1.4% to $7.45 in Friday afternoon trade. End of Story

These guys make a heckuva case for RUSS.

IF they can force Whitney out the stock MAY have upside.

I have a very negative feeling toward Russ Whitney and their primary business
of selling overpriced learning and that will probably keep me out of the stock.

It will be interesting to watch however. I hope they remove Whitney and
rationalize this company.

Good luck to those who wish to play it. I hope you make a bundle and Whitney
ends up thrown out.

There is anything but smooth sailing ahead however. With SEC investigations &
class action suits its going to take a while to sort it all out. And, given the
Chairman, you cant totally trust the balance sheet/income statement.

Hudson Street Capital and Kingstown Capital Deliver Letter to Whitney
Information Network's Independent Board Members
Tuesday July 3, 10:20 am ET
Call for Removal of Russell A. Whitney from Board and CEO Position and Request
Board Representation to Unlock Significant Intrinsic Value

NEW YORK, July 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Hudson Street Capital and Kingstown Capital
Partners announced today that they sent a letter dated July 2, 2007 to the
independent Board members of Whitney Information Network, Inc. (Pink Sheets:
RUSS - News).

The full text of the letter follows:

July 2, 2007

Independent Members of the Board of Directors
Whitney Information Network, Inc.
1612 Cape Coral Parkway East
Cape Coral, FL 33904

Attention: Frederick A. Cardin, Director
Chester R. Schwartz, Director

cc: Russell A. Whitney, Chairman & CEO
Ronald A. Simon, Director & COO
Stephen A. Cootey, Prides Capital

VIA FACSIMILE AND OVERNIGHT DELIVERY

Gentlemen:

Hudson Street Capital Management LLC and Kingstown Capital Partners LLC,
respectively, manage funds that have an aggregate economic interest equivalent
to approximately 4.5% of the outstanding shares of Whitney Information Network
("RUSS" or "the Company"). We are writing to the independent directors to
express our concern that the RUSS Board of Directors, as currently configured,
lacks independence from Russell Whitney, Chairman of the Board, CEO, and the
Company's largest shareholder. We believe that other shareholders' interests
have been surrendered to the self-interests and personal enrichment of Mr.
Whitney, while shareholder value in general has precipitously eroded.

As such, we strongly urge the independent directors to:

First, remove Russell Whitney from the Board of Directors and CEO position for
cause based on a pattern of blatant self-dealing that has enriched him at the
expense of Company shareholders as well as his refusal to cooperate with the
Special Committee's investigation (a detailed account of these self- dealings
and the obstruction is provided in Exhibit I).

Second, immediately elect two outside directors who are representatives of
significant shareholders of the Company to create true independence on the
Board and adequately protect shareholder interests.

To the extent that the current independent directors do not act quickly and
decisively on these suggestions, we intend to take action in two parts. First,
we will take action to remove Russell Whitney from his above-stated positions
at the Company's next annual meeting of shareholders. As an aside, we note that
a definitive proxy has not been filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") and as such we do not believe that the
currently-scheduled meeting can go forward on this date. We would view any
attempt by the Company to proceed with the annual meeting as scheduled as an
attempt to disenfranchise its shareholders.

Second, we intend to request that Prides Capital (cc'd on this letter)
immediately add either a Prides Capital representative or a Hudson
Street/Kingstown representative to the Board of Directors as per Prides
Capital's contractual right. As documented herein, the previous Prides Capital
board seat was occupied by Stephen A. Cootey, who resigned along with another
outside director, Anthony Petrelli, in March 2007, thereby making the Prides
Capital designee director position available. It is our view, based on an
informal polling of the Company's largest institutional investors and certain
Directors, that any such action to increase independent representation on the
Board of Directors would be ardently supported.

It is our belief that, once free of Russell Whitney's self-dealing and
unchecked influence, the Special Committee could more expeditiously resolve the
government investigations that hang over the Company and hamper its operating
performance on many levels. In fact, the Company's Form 8-K dated May 29, 2007
discloses that "The Department of Justice and/or the SEC may view [Mr.
Whitney's refusal to submit to an interview by the Special Committee's
consultant WilmerHale] as lack of cooperation towards the Special Committee's
efforts to determine the facts in its internal investigation and prolong the
SEC's investigation and broaden the Department of Justice's investigation."

Mr. Whitney's removal from the Company along with moving to resolve these legal
matters and investigations would pave the way for the Company to explore a host
of value-maximizing strategic alternatives. We believe any of these
alternatives would result in the creation of shareholder value in excess of $10
per share. As such, we would encourage the newly constituted Board to engage a
qualified investment bank to review all strategic alternatives that would
include, in our opinion, the following possibilities at a minimum:

-- An immediate sale of non-core assets that could result in net cash
proceeds in excess of $6.00 per share as detailed in Exhibit II. This
process could be undertaken before the government investigations are
resolved and proceeds could be immediately distributed to shareholders
in the form of a dividend.

-- A restructuring of the Company under new leadership that facilitates
market-comparable operating margins. We believe that the Company
should at least be able to return to its previously achieved 2005 level
of 12% cash flow margins (approximately half those of its competitors)
once expenses are reduced. Applying the midpoint of the historic free
cash flow multiple range of Investools during 2005-2006 when it was
solely an investor education company (7.5x) implies a value of $16.50
per RUSS share, excluding the value of non-core asset sales.

-- A sale or separation of the real estate and financial markets education
business units that yields net cash proceeds in excess of $10 per
share, excluding the value of non-core asset sales.

A more detailed description of these alternatives and related valuation
calculations is provided in Exhibit III.

It has also come to our attention that Mr. Whitney had previous plans for a
take-private transaction during the second half of 2006, though he did not
immediately inform the Board of Directors of his intent. If Mr. Whitney wants
to continue to run the Company as a personal enterprise, then we would suggest
that he make an offer to take the Company private at a price which reflects the
intrinsic value of the Company. Mr. Whitney could use the proceeds from the
sale of the Company's non-core assets to fund such a transaction.

In light of the steep decline of the stock price to $3.65, the closing price of
the shares on June 29, 2007, from over $10.00 as recently as November 2006, we
believe that all of RUSS' shareholders-including Russell Whitney- would
ultimately welcome progress towards any of the above possible outcomes as
opposed to the continued deterioration of market value related to the current
circumstances. We believe the Company has tremendous business prospects and our
aim is to allow the Company's stockholders to benefit from these prospects
while enabling all of the Company's talented employees and students to prosper.
To this end, we look forward to a prompt reply from the Board of Directors.

Sincerely,

Guy Shanon Michael Blitzer

EXHIBIT I - Current Board Lacks Independence from Russell Whitney and is Unduly
Coerced by Mr. Whitney

The current Board is comprised of the following four individuals: Russell A.
Whitney, chairman and CEO; Ronald A. Simon, Co-President, COO, and director;
Frederick A. Cardin, director; and Chester P. Schwartz, director. Per the 2007
Preliminary Proxy, Messrs. Cardin and Schwartz have no material relationships
with the Company and are therefore deemed to be independent. It is our view
that the current Board is unduly coerced by the interests and demands of Mr.
Whitney. Specific examples include:

2006 Compensation. The compensation committee is currently comprised of the
Board's two remaining outside directors: Fred Cardin and Chester Schwartz. The
Company's 2007 Preliminary Proxy filed April 27, 2007 details a base salary of
$600K for Mr. Whitney and an incentive award of $562K for total compensation of
$1.16M, or approximately 2.7% of the Company's stock market capitalization, in
a year in which the Company's stock declined nearly 50% from a height of $10 to
approximately $5 (the stock has since fallen approximately another 40% to as
low as $3.39 in 2007). The Preliminary Proxy also disclosed that in setting
2006 compensation, the Compensation Committee had reviewed data from and met
with its outside consultant, Mercer Human Resources, and concurred with its
recommendations. But the Proxy goes on to state that:

"In discussions with the Management at a Board meeting in March 2007, and
taking into consideration the extra workload and stressful environment
resulting from parallel investigations in 2007, coupled with individual
performance and retention considerations, the Board and Management
compromised on an annual incentive payout which was substantially higher
than previously contemplated by the Compensation Committee."

Such a "compromise" seems unusual for a board of directors of a public company
since the entire purpose of having compensation reviewed and set by outside
board members is to prevent inside directors from enriching themselves with
corporate assets at the expense of other shareholders. The Board's decision
here seems even more unusual when one considers that the supposed reason for
the compromise - the stressful environment related to parallel investigations -
was brought on, in our belief, by the activities of Russell Whitney and the
management team in the first place. It is not often in corporate America that a
manager is awarded additional compensation for stresses incurred through
government investigations relating to corporate activities that took place
directly under that manager's watch. We also find it noteworthy that these
decisions by the Board seem to coincide with the resignation of the Chairman of
the Compensation Committee, Mr. Cootey, and of an additional independent board
member, Mr. Anthony B. Petrelli, both in March 2007.

Corporate Aircraft. In its 2006 Form 10-K, the Company disclosed that it had
purchased a corporate aircraft for $6.9M in early 2007. Our research indicates
that this aircraft is a Cessna Citation jet; it has received approximately
$300K of upgrades subsequent to purchase; and is used almost entirely by
Russell Whitney, often for what we believe are non-business related trips. The
value of this aircraft represents approximately 18% of RUSS's capitalization
around the time that it was purchased and nearly 50% of the Company's 2006 free
cash flow as measured by adjusted EBITDA. Given the significant size of this
capital investment and that it has little to do with and is unnecessary for the
Company's business, it is hard to understand how a Board that is acting in the
best interests of its shareholders could approve it. In fact, our conversations
with former Company executives indicate that the aircraft may have been
purchased without the prior knowledge of the Board. If this is in fact the
case, it highlights an even more alarming state of affairs concerning the
corporate governance of the Company.

Government Investigations & Special Committee. As previously disclosed in
public filings, the Company is being investigated by both the SEC and the
Department of Justice's United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern
District of Virginia. The Company has provided its shareholders with little
information about these investigations, but has stated that it has been
subpoenaed, a grand jury has been convened, documents have been supplied by the
Company, investigations are ongoing and that such investigations generally
concern the Company's marketing practices and its acquisition of other
companies. These investigations clearly hamper the Company's operations through
(1) substantial legal expense and management distraction, (2) uncertainty
regarding the future of the Company that makes it difficult to recruit and
retain key personnel, and (3) a legal taint that makes potential customers
skeptical of the value of the Company's products-this last factor is well
documented by numerous recent articles in local newspapers highlighting the
Company's legal woes.

The Company appointed a Special Committee comprised of independent directors to
conduct its own internal review of both the SEC and DOJ investigations. In a
Form 8-K filed May 29, 2007 the Company disclosed that on May 14, 2007 it had
received a copy of a letter from the legal counsel of Mr. Whitney, addressed to
WilmerHale, counsel to the Special Committee, indicating that Mr. Whitney, upon
advice of his counsel, would not be submitting to an interview at this time
with WilmerHale. As of the date of this letter, the Board has not taken any
action related to Mr. Whitney's obstruction of the Special Committee's
investigation. The May 29th 8-K states that "The Department of Justice and/or
the SEC may view [Mr. Whitney's refusal to submit to an interview with
WilmerHale] as lack of cooperation towards the Special Committee's efforts to
determine the facts in its internal investigation and prolong the SEC's
investigation and broaden the Department of Justice's investigation." We
believe Mr. Whitney should be removed from his management and Board positions
for his obstruction of the investigations that will likely lead to increased
legal expenses and increased exposure for the Company. What is abundantly clear
is that Mr. Whitney's interests and the Company's interests are not only
misaligned, but are directly antithetical. Our only conclusion is that the
current Board as structured is unable to take actions contrary to the wishes of
Mr. Whitney.

In addition to the ongoing SEC and Department of Justice investigations and
other lawsuits against the Company and its subsidiaries, the Company was served
with yet another complaint on March 22, 2007, alleging that a group of
defendants, which includes the Company and Mr. Whitney, breached certain of
their fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs and committed constructive and common
law fraud and other violations. We do not think it a coincidence that Messrs.
Cootey and Petrelli resigned on that day and the following day, respectively.
We presume that their resignations are related to their ever-increasing
exposure to liability as directors of the Company.

Self-dealing and Related Party Transactions. There are other indications that
Mr. Whitney treats the Company more like a personal "piggybank" than an
enterprise that protects and serves the interests of all of its stakeholders.
The Company is rife with related party transactions and conflicts which
illustrate a clear pattern of Mr. Whitney managing the Company for his own
personal gain.

There are three corporate leases whereby the Company pays annual rents of
$267,672 to an entity controlled by Mr. Whitney and his wife. We question
whether there was ever a proper bidding process in place at the time these
rents were secured and we have no way of knowing whether these values represent
fair market rents. In any event, this strikes us as a glaring conflict of
interest.

Russell Whitney's two children and wife are also employees of the Company,
earning collectively over $500,000 in salary in fiscal 2006 alone. While it is
entirely possible that Mr. Whitney's children and wife are high-value
employees, we find such nepotism to be unusually extensive for a publicly-held
company. We have also learned through discussions with former employees that
they believe that significant expenses which appear to be unnecessary for the
Company's business and therefore personal to Russell Whitney are consistently
run through the P&L of the Company without reimbursement. In fact, one
senior-level former employee has indicated that the operating margin of the
business would be 2-3%+ higher without these expenses. Could this explain why
operating margins of a very similar public competitor have been consistently
higher at similar revenue levels on a historical basis?

There are also a number of instances where Mr. Whitney has commingled corporate
and personal investments. Specifically, Mr. Whitney and Mr. Simon own financial
interests, including the Company's Costa Rica real estate assets detailed in
Exhibit II, in which the Company has invested in excess of $3M. We believe the
Company has no business purpose for owning real estate in Costa Rica and also
incurs significant expenses supporting Mr. Whitney's travel to Central America.
Additionally, we question Mr. Whitney's marketing of real estate and time-share
units in which he has personal financial interests to paid real estate
education students. The Company has no such financial interests in these real
estate assets and this once again shows Mr. Whitney's preoccupation with his
own enrichment at the expense of the Company and its customers. In sum, we can
only wonder if the energies of management and the Board are focused on
maximizing value for all shareholders or whether the vast majority of the
Company's activities and investments are focused on enriching Mr. Whitney and
his family.

EXHIBIT II - Non-Core Asset Sales - Detail

Company assets have been wastefully diverted into a number of unrelated and
non-core assets and investments, many with ties to personal interests of Mr.
Whitney. We believe the sale of these assets combined with existing cash on the
balance sheet would provide shareholders over $70M of net cash equaling more
than $6 per share, nearly twice the current share price. A summary of the fair
value of these assets, which we believe have been conservatively estimated
after all selling/transaction costs, include:

Table I - Non-Core Assets
Asset $M $ Per Share
Excess cash 38.9 3.32
Note receivable 7.0 0.60
Florida land under contract 4.2 0.36
Assets held for sale 4.7 0.40
Corporate HQ 13.0 - 16.0 1.11 - 1.37
Costa Rica real estate 3.6 - 5.0 0.31 - 0.43
Aircraft 5.5 0.47
Debt (6.1) (0.52)
Total 70.8 - 75.2 6.05 - 6.43

Sources: Form 8-K filed March 29, 2007, Form 10-K filed April 4, 2007
(1) Share count: 11.7M shares

Asset sales in total would provide between $6.05 - $6.43 per share as of March
31, 2007 per the Company's Form 8-K, which listed 11.7M shares outstanding.
Since 70% of the total proceeds comprise cash or receivable equivalents (assets
held for sale or under contract), the proceeds of these sales would be
available to be disbursed to shareholders. Total capital gains on asset sales
will likely have offsetting capital losses but note that the Company's $29M net
operating loss carryforward would offset additional gains should certain assets
sell for more than we have estimated.

Asset-By-Asset Detail.

-- $38.9M of excess cash provided by $43.9M of cash and equivalents
(including restricted cash related to credit card receivables) reported
as of March 31, 2007 less $5M for working capital and/or funding of
future losses. The Company's working capital has historically been a
source of cash so it is possible that more than $38.9M could be used in
the special dividend.

-- $7.0M note receivable relating to the sale of an office building in
Orlando, Florida in 2005 which was unrelated to core operations.

-- $4.7M book value of assets held for sale including European
headquarters and first corporate aircraft based on actual proceeds as
follows: European headquarters was sold in April, 2007 for net proceeds
of $3.5M after selling costs, first corporate aircraft was sold in May,
2007 for net proceeds of $1.2M after selling costs and repairs.

-- $4.2M Florida land investment currently under contract with Gulf
Gateway Enterprises, representing The Company's 50% ownership interest
in Tranquility Bay of Southwest Florida, a joint venture established in
2004 which owns 74 acres of land zoned for residential development in
Southwest Florida.

-- $13-$16M for Company owned headquarters based on guidance from the
Company's CFO and independent real estate appraisals, after selling
commissions. The Company owns the land and building of its executive
offices in Cape Coral, Florida which includes 40,000 square feet of
office space and 4.5 acres of land with water access to the Gulf of
Mexico via the west coast of Florida. We assume the Company would
lease back space in the building, or find alternative space to lease at
a cost of less than $800K per year (say $20 PSF), which would be
absorbed by reduced legal fees and other cost-cutting measures going
forward.

-- $3.6M - $5M market value of various Costa Rica real estate investments
based on estimated book value of $3.6M and capital appreciation since
2002. Investments include a 30% interest in a Panamanian entity with
ownership of 394 acres of undeveloped land on the Pacific coast of
Costa Rica and an interest in a beachfront land concession adjacent to
a hotel property; an 8% interest in a second Panamanian entity with
ownership of approximately 445 acres of Costa Rican undeveloped land
and an interest in a beachfront land concession; a 51% interest in a
third Panamanian entity that owns a beach front land concession and
owns a hotel; and a fourth entity which holds a 100% interest in a
7,200 square foot conference center in Monterey, Costa Rica built in
2002 and the land on which it is situated. We believe this estimate
could prove conservative as independent local appraisals and management
comments in past conference calls indicate these assets have
appreciated in value since purchase. We note though that the Company
has never had any operations in Costa Rica or Central America and that
the CEO is personally invested in at least two of these properties.

-- $5.5M market value of newly-purchased Cessna Citation corporate
aircraft estimated at 80% of book value at March 31, 2007. We note that
his aircraft has had $300K of custom upgrade that is not included in
our valuation. Also, we have not included any potentially reimbursable
expenses related to use of the first corporate aircraft for personal
travel prior to March 2007 when, per the 2007 Preliminary Proxy filed
April 27, 2007, Russell Whitney began reimbursing the Company for such
use.

-- ($6.1M) of net debt including $3.0M related to the Orlando note
receivable, $2.1M related to mortgage on the European headquarters
which was paid off in April, 2007, $1M related to financing on the
original corporate plane which was paid off in May, 2007.

EXHIBIT III - Strategic Alternatives and Valuations - Detail

Alternative #1: Restructuring of business under new leadership.

We believe the Company's core education business has significant value which
could be restored in a restructuring led by new management. This value has been
overshadowed by spending on legal representation and wasteful overhead.
Adjusted EBITDA for the Company as a percentage of sales transaction revenue
has averaged just 7.2% over the last 5 years and has declined to 1.6% or
$835,000 from 15.0% in the first quarter of 2006. Despite deterioration in
margins and a reduction in sales transaction volume, the Company continues to
maintain a bloated cost structure.

Table II - RUSS Historic Margins
($M) 1Q07 1Q06 FY06 FY05 FY04 FY03 FY02
Sales 51.5 57.3 223.0 196.4 164.1 109.3 62.7
Adjusted EBITDA 0.8 8.6 15.6 23.4 (6.9) 9.6 7.9
Margin % 1.6 15.0 7.0 11.9 (4.2) 8.8 12.6

Sources: Form 8-K filed March 29, 2007, RUSS Form 10-K's.

(1) Adjusted EBITDA equals cash sales minus direct costs, selling, G&A, and
other adjustments including changes in deferred revenues and other non-cash
items.

We contrast this with the Company's closest public competitor, Investools, Inc
which has a similar level of sales transactions revenue but has achieved
adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.9% in 2006 and 15.8% in 2005 despite similar
levels of sales. We compare 2006 spending levels at Whitney and Investools and
note the difference in efficiency between the two businesses, which we believe
to be largely due to a lack of focus on expense management at the Company.

Table III - RUSS vs Investools - 2005 & 2006 Margins
Investools RUSS Difference (%)
($M) 2006 % 2005 % 2006 % 2005 % 2006 2005
Cash
sales 252.9 176.1 223.1 163.1
Direct
costs 121.3 48.0 92.2 52.4 111.9 50.2 94.8 58.1
Selling
costs 52.9 20.9 37.3 21.2 64.1 28.7 49.8 30.5
G&A 32.7 12.9 24.2 13.8 34.8 15.6 27.7 17.0
Adjusted
EBITDA 52.9 20.9 27.8 15.8 15.6 7.0 23.4 11.9 13.90 3.90

Sources: RUSS and SWIM 2005, 2006 Form 10-K's

We believe adjusted EBITDA to be a relevant proxy of free cash flow at the
Company for a number of reasons, specifically:

-- Timing differences between GAAP expense and revenue recognition whereby
expenses are recognized upfront while revenues are not recognized for
several months or years after cash has been received. Since the
Company's deferred revenue account requires very little, if any cash
expenditures to be fully realized, adjusted EBITDA is a more
appropriate proxy of the Company's cash flows.

-- The Company has no interest expense other than on debt related to its
non-core investments.

-- The Company has very little capital investment requirements. The
Company has spent only $700K per year in 2005 and 2006 on capital
investment not including a $6.9M purchase of a corporate aircraft which
we do not believe to be core to operations.

-- The Company has paid virtually no cash taxes due to its significant NOL
valued at $29M as of its Form 10-K filed on April 2, 2007.

In total, we estimate that over 95% of adjusted EBITDA is available for free
cash flow and believe that the Company should at least be able to return to its
previously achieved 2005 level of 12% cash flow margins (approximately half
those of its competitors) once expenses are reduced. Using trailing twelve
months cash sales of $217M, this would represent $26M of free cash flow or more
than $2.20 per share. Applying the midpoint of the historic free cash flow
multiple range of Investools during 2005-2006 when it was solely an investor
education company (7.5x) implies a value of $16.50 per RUSS share, excluding
the value of non-core assets.

Alternative #2: Sale or Separation of Business Units.

The Company operates in two primary business segments, financial markets
education and real estate education. The profitability of these segments
differs significantly. Real estate education has been operated by the Company
since 1992, when it was founded by Mr. Whitney. This business reported 2006
revenues of $95M, down approximately 9% from 2005. While operating earnings are
not disclosed for this business, our research indicates that this business has
struggled to earn any cash flow and likely constitutes a use of cash
predominately due to its bloated cost structure. This is supported by financial
disclosures in the Company's Form 10-K which indicate the business achieved
gross margins of just 12% in 2005, less than the operating margins of many of
its peers. Still, we believe this business would be of value to a larger
education business operator that would be able to manage the business with more
appropriate financial discipline. Informal queries of potential strategic
buyers have shown interest at approximately 50% of reported sales or $50M, or
$4+ per share.

We believe the value of the Company's financial markets education business is
significant and has largely been obscured by the underperforming real estate
business. The financial markets education business, which was managed under
separate leadership until the end of 2006, reported revenues of $112M in 2006,
an increase of 138% over 2005. While the Company does not report cash flow by
segment, an S-1 filed on May 22, 2006 related to a proposed IPO of this
business (see below) indicated that it generated $13.5M of adjusted EBITDA in
2005 and $76.5M of transaction sales for a margin of 17.6%. Our belief is that
margins and cash flow in 2006 were significantly higher and that the financial
business achieved peak margins in 2006 and constituted a significant portion of
the Company's total cash flow during that year.

We believe management's recognition of the value of the financial markets
education business was the motivation behind its 2006 planned IPO of this
segment under the EduTrades, Inc. brand. Prior to canceling the registration,
the Company's financial advisors, Kaufman Bros., L.P. and Noble International
Investments, Inc. valued EduTrades, Inc. at a post-IPO value of $116M, valuing
the Company's stake at $84M or $7.15 per RUSS share. We have since learned that
later in the year, Craig Hallum, another investment bank, and Kaufman Bros.
raised the estimated valuation of the Company's stake to $114M or $9.74 per
RUSS share as the business continued to grow its cash flows.

The profitability of the financial markets education business has recently
declined coinciding with some key executive departures and its increased
oversight by Mr. Whitney. However, we do not see any reason why it would not be
able to return to past levels of profitability under more focused management.
The mid-point of valuation projections related to the business' IPO was
approximately $8.50 per RUSS share using 2006 figures. Combined with a
potential sale of the real estate business ($4 per share) and the sale of
non-core assets ($6 per share), we believe the entire Company's assets may be
worth in excess of $18 per share in an auction process.

EXHIBIT IV - Prides Capital Director Designee

The Board seat that was vacated by Stephen Cootey was granted to Prides Capital
in connection with the Company's 2006 equity offering and Prides Capital has
the right to designate a successor to serve on the Board. The Company's
Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed Jan 11, 2006 and the Stockholders
Agreement dated December 12, 2005 by and among the Company, Prides Capital,
EduTrades, Inc. and Mr. Whitney details this Board arrangement:

"If at any time any Purchaser Designee ceases to serve on the Company Board or
the EduTrades Board, as the case may be (whether by reason of death,
resignation, removal or otherwise), Purchaser shall be entitled to designate a
successor director to fill the vacancy created thereby, the Company and
EduTrades shall use its best efforts without any undue delay to cause such
successor to become a director of the Company and EduTrades, respectively, and
Whitney shall vote all of the Voting Stock owned or held of record by Whitney
so as to elect any such director."

We will be furnishing Prides Capital with a copy of this letter. In the event
that our request for a seat on the Board is denied by the Company, we intend to
follow up with Prides Capital to offer to fill its vacancy on the Board.

Pabrai’s Perfect Portfolio

*The price and date might not be the actual time and price at which the
transactions were made. In the case of institutional owners, the date is stated
as the last day of their fiscal quarter. The prices are estimates if no
accurate information available.
Mohnish Pabrai’s portfolio is not perfect because of what is inside, but rather
because of how the fund is assembled. Pabrai is the managing partner of the
Pabrai Investment Funds, a partnership with $500 million under management.
Besides the 29% returned annually to partners, Pabrai has designed brilliant
portfolio concepts.

Incalculable amounts of time are spent studying which investments to buy, but
very little time is spent thinking about how much. The decision is usually left
up to the investor’s confidence in the investment, something that has been
shown to be unstable. The truth is, deciding how much to buy can have a large
impact on a portfolio, occasionally just as much as what is bought. There are
copious amounts of information on what to buy, but very little on how much.

To combat his untrustworthy feelings of self-confidence, Pabrai developed a new
“portfolio theory.” I will call it the ten by ten portfolio. Ten investments
that each make up ten percent of the portfolio. Pabrai holds between seven and
fifteen different investments, but appears to stay close to the ten by ten
benchmark. The fund is difficult to proportion perfectly, because a stock can
run up before a full lot has been purchased or because a previous position has
already advanced.

The proportioned ten by ten portfolio has other, less obvious effects. The
benchmark percentage ensures the investor is confident enough to place 10% of
their holdings in the investment. If they aren’t, then they should not invest
at all. Simply put, the portfolio attempts to ensure only the best ideas get
in.

As Buffett says repeatedly:

“ When making investments, pretend in life you have a punch-card with only 20
boxes, and every time you make an investment you punch a slot. It will
discipline you to only make investments you have extreme confidence in.”

Additionally, a portfolio with ten stocks is focused enough to be able to beat
the market, but not so focused that one wrong pick means the death of the whole
fund. Pabrai admits he knows he is not as good a judge as Warren Buffett, who
put nearly his entire wealth into GEICO stock at a young age. Therefore, if
Pabrai is wrong, his fund can still do quite well. He has been wrong in the
past ten years, while still returning nearly thirty percent per year after
expenses.

Pabrai gave the following portfolio as an example at his 2005 annual meeting.
He provided the following information to demonstrate how the ten by ten
portfolio will do well even with some bad investment decisions.

He went on to explain that if the above returns took three years to achieve;
the fund would have an annual return of 14.5%. If the returns took two years to
achieve, the fund would have returned 22.5% per year and if only one year
passed, the return would be 50%.

Another Pabrai concept is the “placeholder.” He contends that money sitting in
the bank is actually risky because of the potentially declining dollar.
Economically speaking, this is true. To combat the risk, Pabrai believes one
should invest the cash in something safe, yielding enough return value.
Currently, he is using Berkshire Hathaway as a placeholder until he finds other
cheaper investments. Putting the money in the hands of the world’s greatest
investor seems like a better idea than leaving dollars in the bank.

A past placeholder returned an annualized rate of about 116%. In mid October of
2004, Pabrai began buying Canadian Oil Sands, a company that owns 35% of
Syncrude, when oil was forty dollars a barrel. The stock price was still
undervalued by over 25% in comparison to the price of oil at the time, and
appeared to value the company as if oil was never going to rise. In essence,
Pabrai decided to take his cash and buy crude oil reserves at thirty dollars
instead. He believed this to be a “productive commodity hedge against a
declining dollar.”

He began buying the stock at forty-eight dollars and eighty one cents. Over an
average of fourteen months, Pabrai had realized a gain of 145%.

His rational was stunningly simple. If oil prices did not rise, Pabrai did well
from the dividend he was collecting. If prices rose to forty or fifty dollars a
barrel, then he won big. Oil as it turned out climbed around sixty dollars and
Pabrai began selling. He had invested in a stock that appeared to have little
risk, was already selling at a decent discount, and had a catalyst to rise a
great deal in the future.

Pabrai knows the dollar over time will likely decrease in value, and he has
developed a concept to protect his portfolio from the risk. He has chosen to
buy commodities or other safe companies that will be a better steward of his
cash.

The last part to Pabrai’s portfolio is actually the first concept he addresses
when researching an investment and is unique to the Pabrai Investment Funds.

In an article published on February ninth, 2004, Pabrai explains what he calls
the “Yellowstone Factor”. He explained that Yellowstone national park is
actually one large volcano that statistically speaking erupts every six hundred
thousand years, with enough force to kill everyone within 700 miles. An
eruption has not occurred in six hundred and thirty thousand years.

Therefore Pabrai explains, no matter how small the probability an event might
occur, the risk must be taken into consideration. He goes on to point out that
no business on earth is totally risk free. There is always a Yellowstone.

Before Pabrai makes any investment, he will “first fixate on what factors can
cause the investment to result in a significant permanent loss of capital”. He
believes simple estimations or “back of the envelope accounting” is all that is
required. Similar probabilities can be assigned to other kinds of risk such as
accounting fraud.

While the analogy of Yellowstone erupting is interesting, the message is
paramount. Consider all possible risks of loss and ascribe a probability of the
event occurring.

To reduce risk as much as possible, Pabrai ensures his holdings have little
overlap. For instance, he will usually only hold one investment in the oil
industry. He can minimize industry specific risk effectively by isolating his
holdings.

Pabrai has simplified portfolio design with straightforward concepts. He has
whittled Buffett’s ideas into easily followed rules. By limiting holdings,
hedging against the declining dollar, and estimating risk, Pabrai has developed
a portfolio that will certainly improve any investor’s performance.

I know you have had some considerable success in MA. I'm trying to get a grasp

The thought process here has gone no further than "if MA can do what it has

I suspect most DFS holders are waiting to see if Discovery stock will perform
even partially as well as Mastercard did when it came public.

I'm keeping for now the few DFS shares I received from my small MS holding. I
guess though that DFS might be a dufus -- the positive expectation/hope mostly
already built into the stock. But who knows?

My interest now is in MS. I've recently added to my small position.

Still remember here the discussion couple years back when one or more posters
was down on Morgan because of poor/dishonest management. That management may
still be intact, and they may not be as trustworthy or shareholder friendly as
we would like. Still, at the current stock price (and p/e) I'm willing to
chance a few more MS shares.

Investment companies seem to be a risky investment at this stage of a bull
market. Although I am in no way a market timer and I won't call for imminent
correction or bear market, I still think that the time to buy investment
companies is when we are in deep red and everyone hates Wall Street. Now, IMHO
is not the time.

I have not run any DD on MS or other investment bankers recently though. I also

Yes, I agree.

I am hoping these companies (MER, LEH, MS, JPM, BSC) have better strength now
and are more diversified (with varied businesses and broader geographical
exposure), than during previous recessions. Still, if there's a correction in
the market, these types of financial stocks (tied to Wall Street) will most
likely fall, and maybe very sharply.

OUSTON (AP) -- Oil and gas company Rosetta Resources Inc. said Monday Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Bill Berilgen has resigned, effective
immediately.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission the company said the
resignation "followed discussions with Mr. Berilgen and the board of directors
about a need for new leadership in the chief executive officer position.
Berilgen had been chairman, president and CEO since the company's formation in
June 2005, according to the company's March proxy statement, which listed him
as 58 years-old.

Rosetta Resources named D. Henry Houston, chair of the board's audit committee,
as chairman, and he will lead the board's search for a permanent CEO.

In the interim, Executive Vice President Charles Chambers will serve as acting
president and CEO. He and Chief Financial Officer Michael J. Rosinski will form
the executive team to manage the company's activities during the interim
period.

Shares of Rosetta Resources dropped $1.88, or 8.6 percent, to $20.03 in morning
trading. The stock has ranged between $16.42 and $25.40 over the past year.

Stock closed down around 12 %. I have never seen a pr release like this before.

UBS Upgrades Brazil's VCP Paper And Pulp To Buy From Neutral
12:13 PM EDT July 10, 2007

SAO PAULO (Dow Jones)--UBS AG (UBS) upgraded its rating of Brazilian pulp and
paper company Votorantim Celulose e Papel SA (VCP), or VCP, to buy from
neutral, UBS said Tuesday in a research report for its clients.

UBS also raised its price target for VCP's shares to 60.00 Brazilian reals
($31.57). The bank, however, didn't unveil its previous forecast. As of 1600
GMT, VCP's preferred shares were up 4.7% to BRL47.85, on the local stock
exchange, the Bovespa. "We see VCP as an attractive medium to long-term story.
The company is significantly expanding in pulp, and we believe it opens room
for further consolidation in the Brazilian pulp universe," said UBS.

Recently, VCP sold its local paper units to Multiformas Ltda, as it turns its
focus to pulp production.

Hi Jurgis - VCP has been a good performer YTD w/ my first purchase in February
too. I did add a few shares in May but my total position is still quite small.

My biggest concern at this point in the cycle is the continued weakness of the
U.S. dollar and rise in commodity prices. VCP is one small play that is in my
portfolio that would benefit from a lower dollar. I also own quite a bit of
shares in natural resource stocks which should do well if the dollar falls too.

Am I the only one that does not agree with the recently "reported" CPI data?
The core inflation rate only rose a modest 0.1%. Mr. Market is telling us
differently with the price of raw materials up over 30% YTD. In fact, the CRB
index of natural resource and commodities confirms this rise and is up over 30%
YTD.

Here is an excellent article (a bit dated 11/06) but provides a check list of
things to watch which (through 7/2007) confirm my fears for the dollar.
http://www.moneyandmarkets.com/press.asp?rls_id=603&cat_id=25

The only real indicator that has not signaled a red flag is the continued huge
rise in the price of gold. YTD gold has been in a trading range but this may be
due to heavy dumping of the U.S . gold reserves through foreign "swap"
agreements.

One of the goals of a "value investor" is to maintain your purchasing power of
the U.S. dollars you own or hold other assets (both domestic and foreign
assets) that accomplish this. Equities provides the means to do this but part
of my selection criteria now is focused on how well they will perform with a
falling U.S. dollar, higher U.S. inters rates and high domestic inflation.

I think VCP is one way to play this theme. I am sure there are others.

Oh well, I rode that batch of leaps up to an 80% gain in a week and failed to

Hard for me to figure fair value for LEH.

On the one hand, I'd say maybe 10-11x p/e. Stock has often sold at lower p/e
though (in the higher interest rate environment). Forward p/e is 8.5. Perhaps
p/e will be raised by the subprime debacle (lower earnings would give higher
p/e). Right now though, this metric says (to me) buy.

Otoh, paying 2x book for these types of financial companies (LEH= 2.12 per
Yahoo), seems to me to be almost paying too much. I'd be looking closer to 1x
book for a good/great buy in. We haven't seen such 1x opportunities for several
years though.

For me, fwiw, I continue to hold my few LEH shares. There's opportunity for
stock appreciation imo, but I'm not so sure or so knowledgeable as to want to
increase my bet.

BDN, CLI, NYT - real estate
I sold my position in BDN around breakeven and bought a larger position in CLI.
today seemed like ma tactically good time to do so, since CLI was weak and BDN
down only a little.

As i mentioned before, i like both but i think that when accounting for debt
/leverage CLI is a bit cheaper, after all they just recently sold stock at
around 54$.

I cam to the conclusion that NYT has hidden assets in real estate. They own
about 800K sqft in their headquarter building. Manhatten office building have
been trading around 1200-1500 S/sqft recently, so that alone could be worth 1B$
alone (cost was around 600M$). NYT also owns office buildings in Boston (700k
sqft) and MA,a grand total of 3M sqft ,probably enough to start a REIT. Besides
the RE I think that About.com is worth 30x operating earnings, which is in the
area of 700-1000M$

The other angle is that Dow Jones apparently get's sold at a very nice premium.
This should give the Sulzbacher family (who owns the majority in NYT B shares)
something tom think about as well. So while I am not fond about the newspaper
business I believe that based on a sum of part analysis NYT is worth far more
than the current stock price of 24.25$. At this point I am not that sure about
NYT, so I only bought a small starter position.

Speaking of real estate, I just bought some Cheung Holdings, CHEUY.PK, a Hong
Kong and south China real estate company. The company was founded and is
chaired by Li Ka-Shing. Say that name 3 times fast.

My Li, was a plastic flower maker until the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the
1967. Some of us are old enough to remember Chairman Mao closed up the schools
and commenced spreading the revolution to every of China, which caused many
Britons living in Hong Kong to sell ( to Mr. Li ) and leave town. After selling
some of his real estate and other businesses, Mr. Li bought control of
Hutchinson Whampoa, the import export conglomerate. BTW CHEUY is a major holder
of Hutchinson Whampoa stock.

Fast forward 30 years. When the British lease of Hong Kong was expiring in
1999, many residents believed Chairman Deng would expropriate their properties
sold out and left town. Mr. Li was buying again. This guy's 1) timing of
purchases in genius, and 2) quite old, approaching 80 years old. Which is OK
because he raised his sons in the businesses (starting back with the plastic
flowers).

There may be another way to hold CHEUY, perhaps via a mutual fund or and
exchange traded fund. CHEUY does not trade much in this country, so to buy it I
had to place a limit order.

For comparative Hong Kong real estate values I will what Disney paid for its
China Disneyworld and get back with the board.

Chinese stuff (real estate): My idea is to buy a package of these real estate
companies. Trying to buy not all at once, but rather if/as individual stocks
retreat or look attractive. Too tough for me to figure value of underlying real
estate (or real estate opportunities) vs. value of the stock. Want to have some
money in the sector though.

I have CHEUY. And small positions in the others too that were mentioned here

I still have Hutchinson Whampoa (HUWHY) bought late '03 and early '04.
As I view it, the positive for the company is their ownership/ management of so
many key port facilities. And Mr. Li's astute business sense. The negative is
HUWHY's telecommunications 3G problems (They are not profitable.), and possibly
Mr. Li's interests not aligned with small shareholders'.

I've periodically been considering adding to position in mid/high $40's (but
have not); now I see the stock has suddenly popped a little to new high. A
surprise to me after its such long sleep, and I've no idea why now.

Well, I dont have a whole lot of experience with REITs, but is CBF really
overleveraged ?

Yahoo shows a debt/equity ratio of 3.218.

Put another way, for every share, debt is approx $41.52 while equity is
$12.903.

This equates to about 24% "down".

Many people buy their first house with 3-10% down.

I dont think CBFs debt is too alarming. Remember, debt works both ways. That
is, it enhances returns assuming they know what they are doing.

I think that insiders buying over 548,000 shares for over $7 million in recent
months backs up my thinking.

Wall Street Transcript has a June interview with Brian Boyle of Boyle Capital
Management (ed: They run a concentrated portfolio of only 5-15 stocks) wherein
he describes his reasons for buying KDE:

Sum of parts:

$8+ cash/sh. and no ltd. (This aspect has been a positive for the stock for
many years.)

Licensing business. Declining business because of expiration of some deals, but
still worth $40M to a private buyer, he says.

A website that he values $60M.

Potential of Chaotic Games, which is a combination of online and trading cards.
Here's the company's latest p.r. about it:
http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/070619/20070619005778.html?.v=1

His thesis is that the downside to the stock is limited by his estimate of the

successful in its USA roll out as he saw in its debut in Denmark.

reasons to be a buyer of any shares now at these stocks' current high (imo)
prices.

Interesting Barron's write-up imo of Bridgeway Funds, which use proprietary
black box quantitative models apparently exclusively to find/buy/sell. Has
terrific track record over several/many years.
Checking Bridgeway's top holdings, I see a few stocks that might fall into my
parameters for a buy: IVAC, DDS, NGPS, EZPW and EGY. I'll look closer at these.
(Already have a position in EGY. May add.)

edv.to posted its nav for 6/30/07 It was $us 10.86. $can11.57.
In US dollars it was a 47% increase in NAV from the prior fiscal year end. I
think this is a spectacular result. I know I keep pounding the table on this
one but Its just astonishing to me that it keeps posting these returns and
still sells at a discount -closed $C10.34. Surely must have outperformed almost
all the precious metal funds in existence.

"The findings suggest that, far from being temporary, high energy prices are
likely for decades to come."

Didn't we know this years ago? The peak oil story hit the front page of the new
york times in 2005. And that was after a few years of coverage in second tier
and internet publications.

Houston investment banker Matthew Simmons... believes the world should be
preparing for sharply lower oil production... "We should be preparing for a
time when, in 10, 15 or 20 years, oil production is likely to be 40 million
barrels a day to 60 million barrels a day, not 120 million," he said.

I own it and am worried about some imminent announcement, but it keeps dropping
on no news. Hopefully it's just stupid panic. I can't believe it has dropped so
much so fast.

"Not major" was only public comment from the company about their sub-prime
risk.

As for myself, I bought in at $15 or so, again at $12, and again at $10. I've
stopped for now, as I do not want this to become too large a part of my
portfolio.

I should clarify: "not major" is my interpretation of their public disclosures.

Assuming Whitman's "safe and cheap" mantra is correct, it's certainly a buying
opportunity. With the way the price is dropping, you have to think the market
knows something. Or is it just some sort of "guilt by association" thing? Who
knows......

I'm watching it closely and have yet to take a position. From what I could find
out over the weekend, it looked like 3rd Ave. Funds owned 12% of the
outstanding shares. Part of my problem is how to value the stock....

CATY. Decided I don't want to have so much exposure to the banking industry
now, and that CATY is relatively less attractive to me when I look at my other
banking positions.

Exited exploratory position today for a small loss. (in 12/06 @34.51;out @
33.37)

ACA's drop is getting ridiculous. I bought some at 6.85. Might be a mistake,
but at that price it's like an option.
