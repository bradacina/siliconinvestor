I hope you are right, but there was an article recently showing that at least
new SUVs are still selling fine. Might be just the luxury category for people
who don't care about car and gas price. I believe the article confirmed your
observations for the used cars and high demand for new cheap small cars.

Partially OT: I recently sold our second car and may buy one in the future. I
am still torn between new Prius or used regular (Accord/Camry or similar) car.
The gas would still have to rise a lot to cover the price difference between
new Prius and old Accord ... :/ I also hate to be tied to the dealer mechanic
for hybrid care = expensive. Somebody suggested buying diesel, but VW is I
believe the only mass-available diesel in US and I just don't trust VW quality
anymore.

Just when you think you know everything about financials....From mr. fitzgerald
5/29/08:

Three major U.S. banks - including Fifth Third Bancorp. (FITB) and Wachovia
Corp. (WB) - got clobbered in recent days on the news that they’ve lost another
$1.6 billion by making investments in the Citigroup Inc. (C) Falcon hedge fund
that lost 75% of its value earlier this year.

It’s just the latest chapter in a continuing credit-crisis saga that’s gone on
for so long that many investors have become numb to the news: They regard all
new developments with a kind of "so what" attitude, or just ignore the news
completely.

Believe me when I say that such a response is easy to understand. But hear me
out as I underscore why investors must continue to watch this
financial-services-sector saga closely. It’ll keep you out of trouble.

Let me explain …

The funds were invested the premiums from so-called "Bank Owned Life Insurance
Vehicles," or BOLIs, which are designed to pay off when key employees die.

BOLIs, in case you are not familiar with them, are specialized policies
typically purchased as an employee benefit. Banks use them to fund such
expected costs as employee compensation and the accompanying benefits. Like
most life-insurance-type policies, BOLI policies contain both an investment
feature and a death benefit.

And that’s why banks like them.

Not only does the bank accrue investment earnings revenue because they own the
policies (bank-owned is the "BO" component of "BOLI"), the financial
institution also receives the death benefit.

And since neither the death benefit nor the increase in the value of the
investment vehicle is taxed, BOLIs became the mother of all tax shelters for
banks.

And that brings us to the core problem.

You see, by taking the investment portion of the life insurance policies and
moving them from traditional portfolio choices into more risky hedge funds, a
bank, or in some cases the insurance company that sold the bank the BOLI
policy, could increase its investment return with an almost-instantaneous,
performance-enhancing boost that looked good to regulators and shareholders
alike.

Of course, if you’re a baseball fan - as well as an investor - you know very
well that there’s a downside to "performance-enhancing" boosts, even though the
dramatic performance gains make that dark side very tough to resist.

That’s clearly why Fifth Third, Wachovia and a still-unnamed regional bank
risked a reported $1.6 billion of their respective BOLI programs, an anonymous
source close to the matter told MarketWatch.com. Many banks, presumably
including these three, use BOLIs to offset the costs of their employee benefit
programs.

And they’re not the only ones….

BOLIs have proven to be so popular that banks - always looking for additional
ways to "rev up returns," according to one news report - had more than $120
billion invested in them as of the end of last year.

But now the chickens are coming home to roost.

Fifth Third is suing Transamerica Life Insurance Co. - which sold it the
policies - on the grounds that these investments in the Falcon fund were much
more risky than the bank allegedly thought. Fifth Third also named Clark
Consulting Corp. as a party in the lawsuit. Both Transamerica and Clark are
subsidiaries of the Netherlands-based Aegon NV (AEG).

"As with many other credit-based investment products, the Falcon’s returns have
been hurt by one of the most volatile periods for fixed income in recent
memory,” said Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos, Bloomberg News
reported.

Filing a lawsuit is the Corporate America’s version of a high-school kid
telling his teacher "the dog ate my homework."

It seems to me that if you weren’t so greedy in the first place - and had
simply stuck to your knitting with prudent, risk-averse choices that didn’t
require all this creative accounting - you wouldn’t have had a care in the
world when Citi’s Falcon Fund lost three-quarters of its value.

The bottom line: There could be an entirely new wave of write-downs encroaching
onto financial-services firms’ corporate earnings reports in the next few
quarters to come. And, as was the case with the initial part of the
subprime-mortgage debacle, some investors are likely to be very surprised at
the identities of the early casualties.

But other investors will continue to say "so what?"

Investors who continue to follow these developments will do so with the
understanding that this, too, shall pass - and some pretty profit plays will
ultimately start to show themselves.

We’ll be there to tell you when that happens.

And it’s likely to begin well before you’d expect it.

After all, as the old Wall Street adage says: "Buy when there’s blood in the
streets."

And if you’ve been paying attention, you’ll be able to say with confidence that
none of that blood is yours.

GE: From this week's Barron's:

"GENERAL ELECTRIC, AT 30.76, closed Friday with a dividend yield of 4.03%. The
10-year Treasury yield was 4.05%. General Electric (ticker: GE) is rated
triple-A, rightly. The U.S. government implicitly is rated triple-A, and
retains this halo strictly for its taxing authority. GE's yield will grow; your
bonds' won't.

Until the past few months, GE's yield has been equal to or above the Treasury
yield only once, in early 2003, right before GE's shares and the stock market
took off. Maybe this isn't enough to make GE a ripping Buy (identifiable
catalysts are few), but it suggests the downside is limited and the shares
finally are out of favor enough, after the company's clanging earnings miss
last quarter, to improve their risk/reward equation.

At below 14 times expected earnings, GE -- composed of roughly 45%
infrastructure/industrial profits, 35% financial, 11% media and 9% health care
-- trades in line with a like blend of industry-comparable multiples, based on
a back-of-the-envelope reckoning. In other words, an investor at long last need
not assume that GE's businesses are above-average -- as, in most cases, they
certainly are -- to justify buying the stock.

CEO Jeffrey Immelt admirably turned the other cheek to his predecessor's recent
public chiding, when he could have pointed out that former CEO Jack Welch's
reputation and personal wealth were swollen beyond calculation by the stock
market's general valuation inflation during his tenure. More important, Immelt
continues to buy GE shares in the open market, $3.5 million just last week."

I am in agreement on GE, I own some as a result of the "inevitable."

I have had, over the years, my best trading results with LUV, and I am thinking
about acquiring again, this time more long term, both for myself and the wife.
Rationale:
Trading at the lower end of its range.
Overwhelmingly best in breed, by far the most sound financially of virtually
all air carriers.
IMHO tremendous management which has created a category killer.

I also believe that SWA will be a beneficiary of the turmoil and capacity cuts
in this industry. They will be able to expand route structure from other
airline's castoffs, and pricing power is likely to benefit.
The new boarding process is much more user friendly than earlier versions, and
the "Business Select" initiative has performed well.
The new commercials are clever and effective, differentiating LUV's strategy
from the other airlines' strategy of nickel and diming (and that's a survival
tool). LUV, once the king of discounters, has almost become, in its own way,
the only full service airline in this new era of air travel.

Of course LUV is hurt by higher oil, but they are probably the best hedged in
the industry, most likely by a long shot. Few of the other airlines can even
afford to buy hedges.

As a contrarian play, I think LUV is worth a look at these levels. If oil
continues to head north, LUV probably remains dead money at best. I think oil
has reached an inflection point, and don't think it has too much more, if any,
upside.

It's the third time the two companies have partnered.

But this time, the Stamford, Conn.-based unit of GE (NYSE: GE) and GeoResources
(NASDAQ: GEOI) have formally formed a new company called OKLA Energy Partners
LP to acquire 82 percent of the assets from a group of unnamed sellers.

A wholly owned subsidiary of GeoResources, a Houston-based exploration and
production company, will buy the remaining 18 percent.

They are buying the reserves for $60.5 million and plan to invest up to $30
million to develop additional proven reserves.

The GE unit is investing 98 percent as limited partner in OKLA Energy Partners

Hotel Reit's _ i don't own any right now. I suspected a while ago that in
between the week economy and the higher fuel prices travel may come under
pressure.

My income play are pipeline MLP's right now.the regulated pipes have build in
inflation protection (pricing adjustment is) and b CPI+1.4%) and many
unregulated ones benefit from strong NG pricing. This plays in my theme to
invest in companies with pricing power which i think becomes increasingly
important in an more inflationary environment that I suspect will last for a
couple of years. I do not think that hotel REIT's fit that bill near term.

I'd say these pipeline mlp's have some issues too. For regulated ones, I'll
guess the roe or some other number is watched for some max. level, and if it
goes beyond that, the regulators investigate or prohibit price increases. (Just
my guess. I defer to those who know more about regulation/regulators.)

For unregulated pipelines, the oil/gas shippers are well aware they can be held
hostage if they have only one pipeline in which to ship product. So in that
case they try to encourage a second source pipeline operator to come in and
provide an alternative. The lucrative business that the monopolist has,
encourages that, I believe. Which means, profits for some sole-source mlp's
which are high now, might not be so high in future.

It's just my opinion too, that because pipelines charge by the volumes going
through their pipes, the inflationary aspect of increased oil/gas prices isn't
significant to profits of the mlp's. If demand for oil/gas drops because of
high oil/gas prices, the volume shipped through the pipes and maybe the revenue
to the mlp from that, might go down.

That said, I agree with you, Spekulatius, that when comparing hotel reits and
pipeline mlp's - their prospects, dividend yields, and possibilities for either
div. increases or div. cuts -- it doesn't seem much of a contest. MLP's seem to
be the clear choice - regarding both risk and return. That's my preference
anyway, and I'm buying a couple mlp's. I still am leery of the K-1 partnership
stuff for federal and for state taxes (each state that the pipeline passes
through), so I am concentrating positions in order to avoid having to file
several K-1 forms. I've also acquired shares in a few funds that specialize in
mlp's (some benefits gone with this structure, but no K-1 forms to complete).

This is a profitable penny stock with 36% margins on the wholesale

Now they're entering the retail market, and with their lean manufacturing

income to increase dramatically as they enter retail space.

Unknown/thinly traded/volatile penny stock...but has as good shot of making it

Hell, Crox lost .05 last q, and tiny CHSH made almost a penny/share.

I think bankruptcy is a possibility, currently remote, IMO. If Bear Stearns can
go bankrupt, they certainly can. About 15% of their capital is short term
loans. In a severe credit crunch, accompanied by a severe market downturn, the
banks can cut their credit off, forcing them to dispose of their positions at a
severe discount. Some of their positions are senior debt, but more than 50% are
junior, junk-like debt and equity.

If you buy MCGC, you are buying small and mid-size American business, with some
emphasis on CLECs. Theoretically, MCGC should be very sensitive to overall US
stock market fluctuations. Recent behavior, I think, reflects some loss of
confidence in management's veracity, plus the specter of their largest position
(14% or so of equity), Broadview, being dead money for a year or so, and
perhaps longer if we get into a long term recessionary environment. Management
said the dividend is safe (under safe harbor rules), then did a rights
offering, and shortly after that cut the dividend. My hunch is that
institutions are dumping MCGC because of this.

The June 5 presentation on their web site summarizes their status, if you want
to avoid wading through the 10Qs.

Deutsche Boerse DB1.DE is another one i am keeping an eye on. At 85 Euros the
PE (Y2008 is about 15 and Y2009 about 13) but they are much slower growing.

The way i see it those exchanges are the inevitable gatekeepers. Even though

ive decided to stick just with adding energy for the time being. increased my
position in se.v by 1/3. rounded out my position in BSIC by adding a few
shares. I want to overweight my portfolio in these guys who will be generating
lots of cash flow in the next couple of years. Oil and Gas will be great over
the forseeable future, and the bargains seem to be out there. Currently have

I'll take more shares of Enervest Diversified Income Trust at current price.

http://www.enervest.com/main/page.php?page_id=2

As mentioned previously, dividend is .07 Canadian per month (less 15% Canadian
tax witholding). That's about a 12% yield on EVDVF.pk.

I like Enervest's diversification and emphasis on Canadian
oil/gas/infrastructure. Some companies held are in oil sands or other "hot"
areas. EVDVF also holds companies I'm not familiar with supplying
pipelines/storage to some of these areas, e.g. Keyera Facilities (no. 2
holding). Of course with Enervest's diversity, I'm going to get stocks in there
that are not so attractive to me too.

Anyway, imo, seems like an okay way to play energy in a "mom" account. (Person
managing the account would have to be aware of changing of the trust tax in
couple of years. Otherwise, could be a buy-and-forget stock (fund) --- if such
a thing were even possible.

SOYO a possibility. I'll pass though.

1. Lot of companies assembling LCDs. A crowded field. I don't see any
competitive advantage that Honeywell units will bring forth. Without something
unique (which I don't see here other than the "Honeywell" name), it's pretty
hard to compete on price when you have so many competitors at every
price/feature point.

2. "...CEO Chok purchased 1.5M shares last month at $1.25/share when the stock
was trading at $1.25. He did so to help improve the company balance sheet." I
can't exactly determine, but it looks like that was an open market purchase
(??). If so, it wouldn't help the balance sheet. Of course, the buying of about
$1M shares of stock by the ceo, is a very positive sign.

3. While the company is diversified, it seems like its big bet is on lcd and
plasma tv's/monitors. Which reminds me of Syntax-Brillian and what could happen
to small entrants in a highly competitive market.

I have previously posted my positions in waste stocks. The group has done well
in this environment and AW is up over 30 percent since I mentioned it here.
This morning GS added AW to their conviction buy list. Below is the write-up.

Allied Waste Industries, Inc. (AW) Buy: Adding shares of Allied Waste to
Americas Conviction Buy List June 12, 2008

Source of opportunity

In conjunction with our upgrade of the Waste coverage view to Attractive from
Neutral, we believe shares of Allied Waste (AW) represent the most appealing
combination of financial and operating leverage to ongoing municipal solid
waste (MSW) pricing growth and volume decline deceleration. With shares of AW
trading 1 standard deviation below their average historic enterprise
value-to-EBITDA (NTM) multiples, we believe the market is discounting
uncertainty about future volume and/or pricing growth – something we do not
expect. Our $18 price target implies 36% upside potential.

Catalyst

2Q08 MSW results – Waste Management (WMI) 1Q08 comments, our channel checks,
and recent commentary indicate volume declines may have hit the bottom. We
expect an update from every MSW company on volume declines (and pricing growth)
on 2Q08 earnings conference calls. Share overhang – Blackstone Private Equity
owns 11% of shares. We have no indication of timing of if/when they look to
exit their position.

Valuation

We are slightly raising our 2008 and 2009 EPS estimates to $0.94 and $1.05 from
$0.92 and $0.99, respectively, to reflect our views of volume growth
acceleration, tempered by concerns surrounding a 2009 non-residential
construction slowdown. Our $18 (from $13), 6-month target price is based on
7.9x EV-to-EBITDA (NTM), a 1% premium to the historic industry multiple and 1
standard deviation above AW’s historical mean since 2004.

Key risks

(1) A looming commercial construction slowdown and/or a US recession leads to
further deterioration in volumes; (2) heightened credit concerns surrounding
highly levered companies; (3) and rising fuel costs could negatively impact
quarterly results – although most fuel is recoverable.

Seth Klarman Comments on Money Management and Baupost's Approach
by: Alex Bossert posted on: June 12, 2008

http://seekingalpha.com/article/81024-seth-klarman-comments-on-money-management
and-baupost-s-approach?source=d_email

A friend sent me a video of a speech given by Seth Klarman at the Columbia
Business School in 2006. Klarman’s hedge fund the Baupost Group has done over
20% a year since he founded the firm in 1983, with only one down year. Also,
Seth Klarman’s book Margin of Safety: Risk-Averse Value Investing Strategies
for the Thoughtful Investor is one of the best books I’ve read on value
investing. It’s currently out of print and selling for about $1,600, but I got
a copy through my library’s intra-library loan program.

Of all the articles/speeches/interviews of value investment managers this is
one of the best speeches I’ve ever watched. Klarman discusses how he made over
5 times his money investing in Enron debt, what his investment principles are,
his thoughts on the investment manegment industry, why he doesn't go short and
why he uses derivitives.

This speech is not posted anywhere else on the internet. Here is my summary:

Thoughts on the Investment Management Industry

The investment management industry is not set up to achieve market beating
returns. Instead they are incentivized to get big and act like asset gatherers.
At the same time there is little incentive to take risk and deviate from the
mean because if they strike out and underperform for even a short period
clients will be lost quickly. It’s an enforced mediocrity (if you want to get
big just do what everyone else is doing and settle for average results).
Klarman said he would rather hold treasury bills then invest in many of the
hedge funds out there. If stocks do 10% going forward and a hedge fund that
charges 2 and 20 takes 3% of your money in fees you’ve only got 7% left, plus
it’s leveraged, holds illiquid securities, etc. He would much rather get 4.5%
risk free.
Tweedy Brown is today’s manifestation of Benjamin Graham
Value investing is risk aversion
Baupost charges a 1 percent management fee plus 20 percent of profits.
How Baupost Invests

Rule #1: Don’t lose money. Rule #2: Never forgot Rule #1.

Baupost always looks for catalysts in its investments. If you find a stock
trading for 50% of what you think it’s worth you want there to be something
that will trigger it to reach fair value.
Baupost will always sell an investment as soon as it near their estimate of
fair value. Baupost has analysts focused around the type of opportunity;
Baupost has a spinoff analyst, index fund deletion analyst, post bankruptcy
analyst, distressed debt analyst and an analyst looking at companies that are
depressed because of a bad earnings announcement).
Baupost invest in: Both public and private distressed debt, Real estate
(Baupost has done over 200 real estate deals including biding on RTC auctions),
U.S. and foreign equities, LBO’s and Derivatives.
The portfolio at the time of the talk was 45% cash, 20% equities, around 17%
distressed debt, 11% real estate, 7% private investments (distressed debt,
small LBO’s, financial restructurings), 6% in South Korean equities and a small
% in hedges.
Baupost looks at every merger, rights offering, privatization of government
business, spin off, major share repurchase, dutch auction tender, thrift
conversions or anything else that could cause mispricings.
Post bankruptcy situations are a good place to look for bargains because people
avoid them and don’t understand them. A lot of good things can happen in
bankruptcy such as terminate overpriced contracts or leases, shed extraneous
business units or, deal with union problems or settle contingent liabilities;
all under the protection of bankruptcy court. Then all the debt holders have
equity and they will want to sell.
Baupost opened over 1,000 savings accounts across the country to take advantage
of thrift conversions.
Baupost doesn’t go short because, unlike going long when you can take advantage
of a drop in the value of an undervalued security by just buying more, if
you're short even though you may be right that it’s worth less then the trading
price you can still go broke. It’s way more risky and you can lose to infinity.
Think tech stocks - if you shorted them in '97, '98 or even '99 you would have
been killed. It works for a while, and then the market goes berserk and you get
killed.
Baupost uses hedges to reduce risk. For example, they use derivatives to hedge
the interest rate risk in their real estate holdings. They hold credit default
swaps on the government debt of countries they have investments in (S. Korea).
They also hold credit default swaps in a bunch of European countries not
necessarily because they have holdings there but because it reduces risk and
they were very cheap ($60, 000 a year for $100 million in insurance).
Baupost does best when there is high uncertainty and little information. When
they research a company they do what ever they can to find information; they
talk to every one to get information including management, industry people,
former executives, customers, suppliers, they sometimes hire consultants and
talk to analysts on buy and sell side.
They constantly reassess to find new information, if they’ve overlooked
something or if something has changed.
Employees own the second largest position in Baupost.
Baupost’s 3 investment principles:

1. Focus on risk before return. This is why Baupost has so much cash, currently
45% of the fund is in cash. If they could find undervalued investments they
would put all their money to work tomorrow. If they had to they would have no
problem holding 100% cash. People fail to have sell discipline because they
can’t hold cash.

2. Focus on absolute returns. Institutions focus on relative returns but
Baupost doesn’t because Klarman can’t imagine writing a letter to clients
saying "we performed well during the year, the market was down 25% and we were
down only 20%" also clients will pull money out at the wrong time and it has a
strong psychological effect.

3. Only focus on bottom up investing. He has views on the macro but doesn’t
think he has an edge in that type of investing. Klarman said that it’s really
hard to turn a macro idea into an investment.

Klarman's 5 fold investment in Enron debt

Baupost invested in Enron’s senior debt and he said that would be an example of
his favorite type of investment. The situation had a lot of complexity, hard to
analyze, a lot of litigation, uncertainty and no one wanted to be associated
with anything Enron creating a huge mispricing. Baupost bought the debt for
10-15 cents on the dollar. It comes down to assessing assets minus liabilities.
After a few years most of Enron’s assets were cash $16-18 billion but the
liabilities were extremely complicated, with over 1,000 subsidiaries. Baupost
had one analyst focus solely on Enron for over 4 years and try to figure out
its liabilities and how much they would get back on the bonds. Baupost believed
that the people liquidating Enron were low balling what they would get back on
the bonds. The people liquidating Enron were very pessimistic and they
originally estimated that the bonds would get back 17 cents on the dollar at
the same time the debt traded for 14-15 cents, Baupost estimated that the debt
would recover 30-40 cents and as of now they believe it will be more then 50
cents.
Investments like Enron debt are possible because the market doesn’t assess risk
correctly by relying on volatility (beta).

I'll follow you into http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CNI now for a few shares.
Numbers look very good on some measures - profit margins expanding every year
for past several. OTOH, the pace of that cannot continue or those high margins
maybe even be sustained. P/sales ratio compared to past years is high. OTOH, as
oil prices continue to increase, rail transport becomes that much more
attractive compared to transport by truck. Good times for this company
apparently with decent roe. OTOH, with railroads being such a capital intensive
business (imo), RR companies need those high roe numbers to make continual
investments in their business. (That is, that good roe may not translate to
excess money being available to shareholders.)

That was my one concern on my recent buy of GE. Here is the article you

http://biz.yahoo.com/rb/080613/ge.html?.v=1
"... Shares of the second-largest U.S. company by market capitalization fell
for a second straight day on Friday after speculation about coming write-offs
at its financial arm spooked investors.

A GE spokesman rebutted the market talk.

"Our UK mortgage portfolio is stable and we do not anticipate any material
increase in write-offs and provisions," said spokesman Russell Wilkerson....".
===========================================================
FWIW I noticed two 15,000 June $29 Put contracts opened last Tuesday and
Wednesday. There was however, a lot of July call options opened at the $33
strike price.

I do think GE will get a good price for their appliance unit as they have two
foreign bidders that will up their price using cheap $US dollars.

I started my GE position this week with a 1/2 position and plan to complete the
position buys in the next six months.

=========================================================

MPW is one to watch. I think I will wait to see if it trades lower to it's
$9.87 BV. I currently have positions in BDN and HRP. One strategy that has
worked good for me is to sell a 1/2 position in out of the money naked Puts
three months out when I buy my starter position. This allows me to trade around
the position by selling covered calls as the stock rises and/or covering the
Puts while collecting the dividend income. If lows are retested, I add to the
starter position and sell a few more naked Puts.

This same strategy has work well for me with some of the Canadian Energy
Trusts. Just be confident in your entry point and make sure it is at a
significant value to BV and/or " discount to fair value". With the recent
volatility in oil, I have traded both the Puts and calls on PWE and ERF that
has almost doubled my dividend income. Currently, I like to Buy PWE around $25
& sell around $40 and Buy ERF around $35 & sell around $50.

He must be very positive on HD with that kind of scratch on the table. Edward
Lampert also has been buying the stock.

I guess at some point you have so much money that a few million is just noise.
$191 million to me is more than noise. There was some rumor that Buffet was
sniffing at HD.

Last time I did the analysis in 1998, HD's real estate (market value) was worth
about $17/share but they have a lot more debt now and I think they split the

This article you mentioned is very interesting and most helpful for my
understanding how Seth Klarman does it.

For maybe two decades I have been wondering what Mr. Klarman can tell us little
investors, and how he gets his alleged great returns.

I say alleged, because I generally don't believe these superior numbers, none
of which are audited that I see. Klarman, Greenblatt, others.

Here's what I read:

"Klarman’s hedge fund the Baupost Group has done over 20% a year since he
founded the firm in 1983, with only one down year."

Now we throw other stuff on top of that. "Baupost manages $6.2 billion of
assets across nine partnerships." (ref.: BusinessWeek , "The Seven Hundred
Dollar Used Book", 8/'06). Is the percentage figure (20%) the average of all
his partnerships or just the oldest (first)? Is it after his fees or before?
("Baupost charges a 1 percent management fee plus 20 percent of profits.") I
have always wondered how this guy can do so well with his obscure stuff
(obscure to me, anyway) and his willingness to hold cash, and so much of it
("...Focus on risk before return. This is why Baupost has so much cash,
currently 45% of the fund is in cash.", a/o of the video of 2006).

My questions have been 1)how does this guy do it (get those great returns year
after year, if he really does), and 2)can the normal investor learn from him
and use his techniques/methods and do this also?

Now that I see more how he operates, it confirms for me the normal little guy
cannot be expected to do what Klarman does and cannot be expected to get the
good results Klarman does over time using a Klarman approach. First, Klarman is
very diversified going expertly over any area where there might be a
discrepancy between price and value. "Baupost has a spinoff analyst, index fund
deletion analyst, post bankruptcy analyst, distressed debt analyst and an
analyst looking at companies that are depressed..." That ability to both
concentrate and be diverse means that Klarman can reduce his risks of Baupost
making a significantly harmful decision in any particular area while increasing
the possibility of finding a winner somewhere among the many fields in which
his people search.
Secondly, that takes resources and dedication. "Baupost looks at every (ed.
EVERY) merger, rights offering, privatization of government business, spin off,
major share repurchase, dutch auction tender, thrift conversions or anything
else that could cause mispricings."

For me, I am always looking for what works best and what is optimum for the
normal investor. What can the normal person take away from Graham/Buffett and
the other great investors? Imo, regarding Mr. Klarman, it is not possible for
the average investor to emulate the Baupost methodology.

For Klarman, I've never quite understood the lesson. I get the margin of safety
- that's from Graham. Maybe from Klarman I see that there are just some areas -
restructurings, hedging with foreign currencies, bankruptcy stuff - where it
doesn't pay to play. Leave those to people with the time and resources and
skills to be in that game. Maybe also from Klarman - seem's he'll look at
anything with a price/value discrepancy - except one thing - he won't short.
Maybe that's another lesson (Don't short stocks.)

Anyway, although I don't see where his methods can be emulated, and I almost
never understand his buys -- his stocks usually don't look like value picks to
me - I follow up on his buys when I see them, and sometimes I find a couple of
stocks he has that I like too, and I will buy. As I said in an earlier post, I
have some of his here:

http://biz.yahoo.com/indie/080327/1149_id.html?.v=1

------

I guess I might have to say the best theoretical gain I might ever make would
be my purchase of his book. I believe I paid $5 for it at a thrift shop. (I
have been a collector of stock market books relating to value investing for
more than thirty years.) Too bad I have underlined and highlighted passages and
so have diminished the book's apparent value. "...Seth Klarman’s book Margin of
Safety: Risk-Averse Value Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor is
one of the best books I’ve read on value investing. It’s currently out of print
and selling for about $1,600."
Yikes. Imo, the book is nowhere near as good or as helpful as many other books
relating to value investing. The focus on risk and the continual warnings are
so heavy that it becomes discouraging enough to make a person want to forget
about stocks and just put money into treasury bonds.

Paul,

I mostly agree with what you wrote about Klarman. I also wanted to note that he
sounds a bit hypocritical dissing hedge fund fees first and then telling that
"Baupost charges a 1 percent management fee plus 20 percent of profits." O.o
But OK, if he gets over 20% returns per year after fees, then maybe he's
justified to charge that.

Now, can we learn something from him. One thing that I may need to learn from
him and from Buffett is that one needs to continuously learn new things. I am
not sure if it is possible to just stay in the familiar "Buffettology" or
P/Book investing areas and earn great returns. On one hand, Buffett advises to
know your circle of expertise and just wait for fat pitch in that quadrant. On
the other hand, he himself does not practice what he preaches. He learns and
changes all the time. His PTR buy is very different from generic Buffettology
or value investing, his currency and derivatives bets are even farther away. So
should we (I) learn how to invest in financials now that they are dropping into
potentially great bargains? Should we learn how to invest in real estate with
the current bust? It could be that the greatest gains in the next five years
will be made in these two areas. Should we spend week or a month or even half
year concentrating on how to value financials or real estate, picking the best
and then invest into them?

I know this question is mostly rhetorical to you - you will probably never
switch from your 200+ stocks investing, so any suggestion to focus or spend
disproportionate amount of time on some area or investing technique probably
seems anathema to you.

Of course, you are somewhat right about the amount of time: we will never have
10 different full-time analysts that Baupost does. So we cannot look at every
opportunity in 10 areas. On the other hand, some of these areas are too exotic
for small investors: we will not be able to get into bankruptcy proceedings
even if we knew what and how to buy. So maybe it would be enough if we (I)
figured out how to evaluate mergers or spinoffs (Greenblatt)? Even this seems
to be quite arcane and almost no one from SI investors does even a passable job
at spinoffs. I tried but it is tough IMO and feels very foreign to me compared
to Buffettology stuff.

Another thing to learn from Buffett and Klarman: holding cash. Hmm, that's a
toughy for me. Most of the time, I see too many "goodish" ideas to hold cash.
Although I remember times when the pool of "goodish" ideas almost disappeared
and it was usually a good time to hold cash. But I am not sure I would
recognize these times if/when they came again. Maybe that's the time now in
energy stocks - lower positions, hold cash. Maybe.

AIG - the analogy to Citigroups demise were almost painful to watch. Sullivan
was not necessarily a bad guy for normal times- sort of "assemble and keep the
team together, they'll do alright' kind of leader. in times like this a company
like AIG needs somebody who understands the assets the company holds and the
risk associated.. Sullivan clearly was not the guy who was questioning the
numbers his underlings (who probably fabricated the mess as well) came up with
and looked really incompetent when the battle between the independent auditor's
and AIG's accountants became public.

Where will this go from here? Probably a big housecleaning with substantial
further writeoffs. The new chief will have to throw out the old way assumptions
and models and work in the market - market world. I think this will be very
costly for the shareholders and i believe at least in the short term the
downside risk is larger than the upside.

I haven't heard too much about demand shifting to smaller planes, if you lump
regional jets in there. I've heard RJs are not particularly fuel efficient per
seat mile, and these are targets for reduction.
I thought one of the selling points for BA is that airlines may be forced to
retire older gas guzzlers for newer technology which consumes less fuel. I see
the Dreamliner is projected to consume 20% less fuel than a prior generation
jet carrying the same amount of passengers. The workhorse of the industry is
still the 737, and BA is rolling out more fuel efficient versions of that, I
would suspect, without performing any DD on that matter.

BA: Per Barron's 6/3/08, "Stocks to Watch":

HIT TO BIG-PLANE STRATEGY AT BOEING
The determination at Boeing (BA) to execute on its mega-plane introduction has
cost the aerospace concern opportunities to sell airlines the smaller,
workhorse craft that the industry prefers. And it could be years before Boeing
has a chance to recapture the market opportunity. Speaking at an aerospace
conference in Turkey, management of International Lease Finance Company, the
biggest lessor of aircraft to the airline industry - and, not incidentally, the
biggest customer for new planes - said it worried that Boeing wouldn’t resume
production of single-aisle planes, such as the 737 aircraft, until 2020 -
perhaps four years later than the exec said he anticipated just a year ago. The
remarks were echoed by the head of Air France, who also complained about the
focus on big planes over popular models."

GE may be another play on this theme. It looks like GE Aviation does the
retrofit (RNP) on the legacy 737 models that provides operating efficiencies
that save fuel and reduce in air flight delays.

Next-Gen Pace Picks Up
Jan 25, 2008 By Henry Canaday/Overhaul & Maintenance
http://www.aviationnow.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=om&id=news/om10
ADS.xml&headline=Next-Gen%20Pace%20Picks%20Up

From the article:"...Southwest Airlines will be adding the dual flight
management systems (FMS) required for RNP, along with other equipment, to all
of its classic Boeing 737s in a special modification line in 2008 and 2009. The
carrier's 737-700s already are equipped for RNP.

The classic upgrades are being provided by GE Aviation Systems. The market for
these and similar upgrades is "starting to heat up," according to Jack Befus,
acting director of civil flight systems. "We are seeing requests for proposals,
pricing and technical information."

Befus attributes increased interest to both RNP's short-term savings and the
fact that dual FMSs eventually will be necessary to deliver the capabilities
for full next-gen.

RNP already has been bringing significant short-term benefits, in time saved
and timely arrivals, to GE customers in the U.S., Canada and Europe. GE is
involved in next-gen trials in Europe, where Scandinavian Airlines estimates
that its RNP approaches at Stockholm Arlanda could save $12 million a year,
including $6 million in fuel savings, and reduce annual emissions by 23,000
metric tons of carbon dioxide. The same tools have proven the safety and fuel
savings of RNP at Linzhi Airport..."

========================================================

With a forward PE of 10, BA may be a better pure play but GE should also
benefit from this upgrade/retrofit cycle.

I certainly do believe those numbers, Paul. My own numbers have been pretty
good and I am a one man shop! Since I have been trying to follow rule number #1
better my results have improved. Now I am working on having more patience and
sticking with situations. Individual investors can buy spin-offs and rights
offerings. distressed debt I think is a lot harder. Im still holding almost all
of the MFCAF I bought and am waiting for PLG.to to split itself into two
companies. Unfotunately I never held on to ME or that would have worked out
really well too. A good friend of mine worked for pfeizer. He received shares
of Monsanto as a spinoff that initially sold for $5-$6 a share. Now several
years later he sold these shares off for over $100 a share. with plays like
this its not hard to achieve a return of 20% a year.
A friend of mine went all over the country opening up savings account and for a
year or two did quite well. not so well recently that maybe why baupost has so
much cash. Thankfully despite being a one man shop its fairly easy to piggy
back on the efforts of others because of the internet. I still think buying
something like PME and KYCN will work out over time but I may need to hold for
several years.

The main part I think most investors who lack the steel trap mind that you have

Two things need to be considered here, Madharry. Risk and methodology.

Getting results without having a methodology is a terrible thing because it
makes repetition of results so difficult.

If a guy works at PFE and gets PFE stock as a consequence and holds its
Monsanto spinoff, what's the methodology of that kind of investing? Perhaps
it's the idea of "Oh well, I can't really lose because I got the stock 'for
free', so I don't really care about it and that makes it easy or easier for me
to hold on to it." A method ought to be repeatable, and if (I presume here) the
fellow only just received some shares of stock as a consequence of his
employment, I don't see where he shows any prowess for picking stocks. Great
though that he made money and maybe lots of it.

The point that I was trying to make anecdotally is that spinoffs can yield
xtraordinary results over time, that was a major point of JGs first book, and
10 baggers on a small part of your portfolio can boost your return
considerably. at one point on could have purchased mfcaf for a buck now its
$5-6 it reached a high of $9 last year. These represents large roes.

It's the portfolio's return, not the individual stock's that is important to
me, and therein is the difference in investing techniques (concentration vs.
diversification).

If somebody bought Mfcaf for $1 and now or earlier has/had a multibagger --
that's a great individual return and a good help to the portfolio.

Somebody with a 20 stock portfolio... a good return on the portfolio. Somebody
like me... it would've been a good positive although not a significant pop to
the portfolio.

Issue is, how confident can or should or will a person be about MFCAF to make
it a substantial enough buy, whatever "substantial enough" means.

It's a risk/reward thing as I see it. So if somebody has a significant
portfolio increase because MFCAF is/was a substantial holding in their
portfolio, from my perspective - from what little I saw about MFCAF - that
reward had an associated risk. Although of course, if you bought or kept a big
chunk of it, you might have a different viewpoint. Especially looking back now,
since it has done so well.

my point is that if one has 20% of the portfolio in mfcaf type investments and

slightly above average it might be enough to move your portfolio up to 20%
profitablity.

Madharry, if I understand you correctly, that would be my basis for
diversification.

"...if one has 20% of the portfolio in mfcaf type investments and 30% of those
turn out to be multibaggers"

That is, somebody with a 20 stock portfolio would have 4 such investments, and
30% of the 4 or about one investment would be the multibagger.

With the same percentages and a a larger 50 stock portfolio though, that would
be 10 chances (20% of 50) and maybe 3 or 4 winners (30% of 10). A more
diversified portfolio as this gives more chances for more outsize winners to
show up. I like that.

Imo such is important because even though a person could say he/she is going to
try to structure their portfolio so somewhere within 20% of the portfolio
they'll get multibaggers, it's my experience that my huge multibaggers can and
do come from surprising areas - not just the 20% of a portfolio where one
guesses beforehand where they might occur.

SUGAR: Is Sugar-Based Ethanol a Sweet Deal?
By Rich Duprey June 16, 2008 Comments (0)

Sir Richard Branson wants our cars to have a sweet tooth, as the Virgin Group
billionaire entrepreneur has been advocating the use of sugar cane-based
ethanol as opposed to one derived from corn. Considering the impact that rising
corn prices have had on inflation, not to mention food supplies, he may have a
point.

Branson can rattle off his take on the economics of sugar-based ethanol at
will:

It's seven times more efficient to run a car off sugar than corn.
It requires only $100 to alter your existing car's battery to get 85% of your
fuel from sugar.
Unlike with hydrogen fuel, you wouldn't have to eliminate the entire current
fleet of cars on the road to switch to sugar-based ethanol.
Brazil by itself could create enough sugar plantations to supply the U.S. --
without damaging the rain forests.
Those are pretty compelling arguments. With world food prices soaring over the
past couple of years and resulting food riots endangering the stability of
countries around the globe, current U.S. policies seem ludicrous.

I'm always willing to give the maverick Branson the benefit of the doubt. Any
CEO who's willing to appear nude in the middle of Times Square to launch his
Virgin Mobile (NYSE: VM) phone service (OK, Branson was actually in a "nude
suit") is someone worth listening to if not, um, watching.

There are a lot of vested interests working at cross-purposes to Branson. Not
just Big Oil plays like ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX), but
also corn-based ethanol producers like Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE: ADM) and
VeraSun Energy (NYSE: VSE).

So to whom can you look to turn sugar into gold? Perhaps the leading name right
now is Cosan (NYSE: CZZ), the largest sugar and ethanol producer in Brazil. Of
course, Archer Daniels isn't putting all its husks into just one corn silo, and
has itself expressed a desire to diversify into the sugar cane-based ethanol
market.

Now, having seen the damage ethanol demand has done to corn prices, you have to
wonder about the sweet stuff. Sugar prices might be at some of their lowest
levels as supply outstrips demand, but increasing the need for sugar to make
fuel would likely cause them to spike.

Given the potential with sugar-based ethanol, it could be time for you to
embrace $4 a gallon gas, and perhaps profit from the trend, too. And you don't
have to parachute nude into Times Square to do it.

CZZ. The Black Swan, I've looked at CZZ a couple of times and concluded it's
just too tough for me to figure. At least as a value stock. Maybe okay as
speculation. Possibly will grow greatly if US removes tariffs on ethanol. Maybe
even without exports to USA.

I've not ever done well with sugar producer stocks. Failed to extricate myself
from USA producer IPSU's predecessor company, failed to buy IPSU as it came out
of bk, failed to buy IPSU as it rose strongly. There are just some stocks for
some people that they never can do well with -g-.

Still, I have put IPSU on my watch list as the stock again has fallen, have had
a gtc order in for a few shares, and I will take a few shares now at current
price. This would be a bet for sugar as a commodity (food) rather than sugar as
an energy supply. In past it's been very difficult/impossible for sugar
producers to have consistent profits. So it seems to me anyway, based on my
unsatisfactory experience with this subsector. Supply has always exceeded
demand in past - The USA government subsidies to farmers have encouraged
overproduction in USA (imo).

This time for IPSU, I note (per Yahoo) the company has no ltd and about $7 in
cash/cash equivalents. It trades about $13 with a stated book value of about
$14. Not that stated book value itself has stopped this company from going bk
before. This time though, the cash backup is strong and substantial.

If sugar producers who can and will make ethanol will continue to focus on
sugar as energy, and if demand for sugar as food commodity continues to
increase (the pundits are always saying this), then it's possible that IPSU as
producer of sugar as a food, maybe this go 'round will do okay too.

Worth a small bet to me to be in. (instead of CZZ for me)
