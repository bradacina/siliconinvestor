I'd buy IAL. When you consider that their CAPEX is twice their depreciation, it
indicates they are investing for better productivity down the road. If you make
CAPEX equal to depreciation, the flow-through to the bottom line looks more
like just shy of 10% ROE. Getting almost 7% dividend and having no debt, not
bad.

Others on this thread have answered you better than I could. It does seem
unwise to buy stock in a company that earns less on its invested capital that
you would if you bought a bond. In the case of DOV, the return on assets is
pitiful. Even if it doubled, at the top of its cycle it still wouldn't be
satisfactory. I agree with Fitch's downgrade. As for a value stock, I like a
small company called Nedcom which is listed in Amsterdam, sells for 11 times
most recent years earnings and and the earnings and equity are growing at
faster than 20% a year. Like DOV they make machinery; it happens to be
machinery for automating warehouses. Long term I think UCBH is a great value
but it looks overvalued at the minute. It's a NASDAQ stock.

There's a note in yahoo that IAL's earnings were noticeably affected by a
strike. If the strike was of IAL's employees then I'd avoid the stock. There
are many things to buy, why get involved where the employees are not united

Paul,

If I may butt in, if one relies on ROE alone, that might be flawed. For
example, a company that utilizes a high degree of leverage to generate assets
may show an abnormally high ROE since by definition:

ROE = Net Income / Common Shareholder Equity

While ROE should be evaluated, one must also evaluate ROA, Price to Book Value
(preferably tangible) and ROIC in order to obtain the best comparisons of
companies. Additionally, since many companies have various forms of off balance
sheet financing, such as leases and commitments, one needs to adjust the
balance sheet accordingly.

Lastly, when evaluating ROE, one must also take into consideration each
company's Interest Coverage (EBIT/Interest Expense) and Debt to Equity ratio.
Lastly, one should not compare ratios of companies in different industries to
determine whether or not one company is a buy in view of another. Instead, for
example, if one wanted to determine whether NKE is a value play, one should
look and compare the fundamentals of Reebok and Stride Rite.

Dave, I guess I'm just dancing around this ROE thing and am not relating it as
clearly as I would like to value investing.

About the the first ratio I investigate in a screened stock is current ROE. If
it's low, and other metrics are attractive, I'll likely eventually look at past
ROE figures to see if I can ascertain the company's ROE potential based on its
past performance.

That said, it is paradoxical in that I can - and have a few posts ago - shown
that many successful professional value investors do not use ROE in their
stated methodology.
This is the Ben Graham value thread: he has not recommended ROE as a metric for
either his defensive or aggressive investor. So here I need not be apologetic
when I say a stock having a low ROE does not disqualify it as potential
purchase for me.

A general question for me is how does one use ROE in screening for companies
where the price of the stock is 2, 3, maybe 6 times book value. A standard
answer for value investors suggests such stocks - not being low price/book -
ought to be passed-by automatically on a p/book screening. But Buffett
followers (who are users of ROE metrics) might say these high ROE, high
price/book stocks are among the best investments. So is there a general way to
screen for "attractive" high/pb stocks? For discussion purposes I chose to take
on a specific subsection of stocks: Buffett stocks(which are already
preselected by Mr Buffett or surrogate as good businesses and having good and
honest management). Can one look at this subsector of stocks by price, book
value, and ROE and come to some formulaic conclusion as to whether those stocks
might be close to being cheap (buys) or close to being expensive (sells) for a
value investor? I'm saying yes.

I gather you are saying no because other factors have to be considered: ROIC,
ROA, off-balance sheet financing, etc.
And that since the three examples I gave are in diverse business, that has to
be allowed for as well.

You might be right. How about if we then take the discussion from the
theoretical to the applied? Given that Mr. Buffett is the greatest investor in
modern times, and the stocks I referenced are the stocks he owns, then I
suggest it behooves every investor to look at those stocks for themselves too
to see if they meet their criteria for purchase. (Or if Buffett stocks are too
expensive now, at what price would the investor buy those stocks.) Have you
applied your must-do's to these stocks and if so, what have you concluded?

Paul,

>Do you have a way to relate ROE to price to book value for these three
companies?

I don't use p/book so I don't have a way to relate ROE to p/book. I use Mike
Burry's Buffetology spreadsheet which uses ROE to estimate future earnings,
market cap and subsequently expected return.

>DOV. Current price 28 in a range roughly between 26 and 43.
>I'll superficially guess ROE is about 20-23%.
>Sells about 2.45x its approx. $11 book value.

It's a buy with expected ~17% annualized return if the ROE remains at 20% for
the next X years. However, note that 2001 ROE dropped to 9.9% and equity has
been dropping for last couple of quarters. I did not investigate more closely
yet. If you assume 15% ROE going forward, it is not a buy.
I may investigate it further.

>HRB. Current price about 48 in a range roughly between
>32-51. Maybe 20-25% ROE. Selling at 6x book value of $7.56.

It's not a buy with expected ~9% annualized return if the ROE remains at 21%
for the next X years.

>NKE. Current price about 44 in a range about 41-64.
> Past few years' ROE roughly 12-18%. Selling at 3x book
> value of 14.

It's not quite a buy with expected ~12% annualized return even if the ROE is
expected to be 18% for the next X years.

So it looks we mostly agree with our opinions on these three stocks.

Agreed by definition, but since I usually do not buy companies with high
leverage, I don't really care about this problem. As you say, if debt/equity is
high, then good-bye. :-)))

>one should not compare ratios of companies in different
>industries to determine whether or not one company is

I totally disagree with this. If a company earns only 4% ROE, I don't care
whether it is in the money printing industry. I will instead buy a company from
manure industry that earns 25% ROE. Tell me why I should buy the 4% money
printing company? Because it has higher ROE than another money printing company
that earns only 1% ROE? I don't see logic there.

And if the whole industry earns high ROE - e.g. pharmaceuticals - I would buy
the whole industry and don't buy anything from e.g. paper industry.

Yeah, I know, I should diversify. I do that in my 401(k).

Cash Flow Analysis---Intel
Page 1.

Before I start with the numbers crunching on Intel, I want to review with
everyone my approach to some of the items contained on the Statement of Cash
Flows. First, so we are all on the same page let’s go over the reason for and
the basic format of this required financial statement.

The Statement of Cash Flows (which from here on I’ll refer to as SCF) is the
financial document that reconciles the Income Statement with how the cash moved
through the company for the period involved. The Income statement isn’t good
for understanding cash flow because there are many “accrual” type accounting
entries and non-cash events (like depreciation, reserve accounts, amortization,
etc) which make following the cash flow virtually impossible to do. The purpose
of the SCF is to remove (back-out) those non-cash items so a clearer
understanding of the cash flow from operations can be seen. This function is
accomplished in the first (of three) sections of the SCF. The broad heading of
this first section often makes it pretty clear what it’s mission is. For
example, on INTC’s SCF the heading is: “Adjustments to reconcile net income
provided by (used for) operating activities.” Pretty straightforward to here!

Some writer’s I’ve read have suggested going into assessing the amounts of each
and every entry in this first section and, I suppose, there might be some merit
to doing so. However, for me, for what I have gained versus the time it took, I
didn’t find that my understanding of the value of the company was significantly
better off, so I only usually go into the Depreciation number a bit (explained
later) and only those other areas if something contained elsewhere in the
filing draws my attention. In the case of INTC, something did draw my attention
to the “Amortization of Goodwill” entry and I’ll refer to this again later as
well.

So, moving along, the first line of the SCF is the bottom line from the Income
Statement (Net Income) and the first section reconciles the accounting net
income with the net cash picture.

Most analysts that I’m aware of only go into the SCF far enough to get two
numbers: The bottom line number from section one, Cash From Operations (CFO);
and the CAPEX number which is one of the line items in the second section. They
perform a simple calculation with those numbers and believe they have the bulk
of the information they need from the SCF. That calculation is: CFO – CAPEX =
FCF (Free Cash Flow).

I have shown with my previous analysis of DELL that more than this simple
calculation is needed to get the clear picture of true cash flow. It will be
demonstrated again with the INTC analysis.

But before I get too far ahead of myself, I want to finish the outline of the
SCF.

So we have three sections: the first which leads to CFO; the second: “Cash
flows provided by (used for) investing activities; and the final section: “Cash
flows provided by (used for) financing activities. The totals of each of these
three sections are added together to give a final number: “Net Increase
(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents”. It is this number that I usually
start with for my cash flow analysis. I then work my way back up through the
financing and investing sections backing out the non-operational items to get
the true cash flow of the business. This may sound like a daunting task, but it
is really not that difficult once I got past the “newness” of it.

A sane person at this point might ask: “Why?” “Why would you (or I) want to go
through all this effort?”

Assuming some that are reading this have some sanity left (although….to be
reading this…..), the answer is: "So I can get to an earnings amount that I can
believe in!" It is the number I derive here from the statement of cash flows
that I plug into any metric or ratio using “earnings”

EPS has been shown for many years to be easily manipulated, professional
analysts appear to be “on the take” so to speak, Stock-brokers appear to only
have annuities for sale. In the final analysis, we have ourselves and the
product of our efforts in which we can rely.

My cash flow analysis is only that. It is not a recommendation for or against
any investment. It is not a suggestion of what to do with the analysis. I will
share some ideas of how I use it, but one of the things I like about this
thread is the ability to work with the information in different ways that has
been displayed here over the years. Regardless of how it may seem, I have no
position in INTC (long or short), nor do I have any positions in the options of
their stock.

Starting with the next post, I will outline my findings regarding INTC.

I'll address this one to myself since maybe it's beating a dead horse to
everybody else -g-

I'm looking at AFC now because it shows up on the new lows list.

Book value: approx. $45/sh
current price: $23.36

http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/invsub/results/compare.asp?Page=TenYearSum
ary&Symbol=afc

Lehman says about it, "Our $38 price target (ed. '03) reflects our belief that
Allmerica's sustained return on equity is probably in the 5-7% range, excluding
the recent exceptionally weak stock market's affect on Allmerica's variable
annuity earnings."

It looks like Lehman expects AFC to earn $2.70 and trade at a p/e somewhat
higher than Lehman's calculation of AFC's five year avg. p/e of 12.5. On a book
value basis, AFC has traded about 125% of book (5yr avg., per Lehman), so
Lehman would have a target of seeing AFC sell for 38/45 or roughly 80% of book
value. (I'm assuming any book value growth to and through '03 doesn't
materially affect the conclusions.)

In my opinion, this is a typical regression-to-mean kind of stock analysis
where one assumes there will be earnings (here $2.70 which is 6% ROE on $45
book value), and one assumes that investors will bid up the stock to a higher
"investor ROE" than the company's ROE. 2.70/38 being a 7.1% return (equivalent
to a p/e of 14). Lot of iffs here, but possibly achievable. The current price
to stated book value (23 vs. 45) is uncommonly low for an insurance company.

I'll add AFC to my watch list.

For this analysis I used the most recent 10K. Although there are 2 quarterly

to look further.

That 10K can be found here:

This is directly copied from their SCF and is the "Change in Cash" and the
"Cash Flows provided by (used for) financing activities" section. I have had to
edit it a bit to get it to fit properly and I place the years at the top of
this section when, on the 10K, they are only at the top of the form, not each
section.

<pre>
Cash flows provided by (used for) financing activities:

 2001 2000 1999

Additions to long-term debt 306 77 118

financing activities (3,465) (3,511) (4,228)

----------------------------------------------------------

Net increase (decrease) in cash
and cash equivalents 4,994 (719 ) 1,657 
</pre>

So far, this area tells us that INTC appears to have had $4.994B flow to the
bottom line in 2001; $719M taken out of the coffers in 2000; and $1.657B into
the bank in 1999.

However, let's look at the entries in the financing section. (I will list the
amounts for 2001 only in parenthesis after the item, but the reasoning applies
equally to each of the three years presented.) The payments of dividends (538),
and repayment and retirement of long term debt(10) are optional uses of cash.
That means they didn't have to spend the money that way, they could have had
many choices, and they chose to give the investor back a small return and pay
off debt. therefore, these amounts are considered by me to be part of the FCF
and I will add them back into the bottom line numbers. The money received,
however, from Increasing short term debt(23), Increasing long term debt(306),
and the sale of stock(762) are not money from operations, so I am going to
subtract these amounts. Which brings us to the consistantly $4B+ entries for
"Repurchase and retirement of common stock".

While it does, indeed appear as though INTC has separated the functions of
purchase and issuance, the net impact on the bottom line is still pretty clear
when we know where to look.

From the 10K:
Stock repurchase program > The company has an ongoing authorization, as
amended, from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 1.8 billion shares of
Intel's common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. During 2001,
the company repurchased 133 million shares of common stock at a cost of $4
billion. As of December 29, 2001, the company had repurchased and retired
approximately 1.5 billion shares at a cost of $26 billion since the program
began in 1990. As of December 29, 2001, 293 million shares remained available
under the repurchase authorization.

Which tells us that 133 million shares were purchased for $4.008B which divided
out means they paid $30.14/share. I will use this amount as the fair market
value of the exercised stock options for the period.

From elsewhere in the 10K:

<pre>Options granted by Intel currently expire no later than 10 years from the
grant date and generally vest within 5 years. Additional information with
respect to stock option plan activity is as follows:

12/30/00 195.6 $7.07
12/29/01 230.9 $11.27
</pre>

So we see that at least 68 million shares were exercised between 12/00 and
12/01. At our above referenced cost per share of $30.14, that amounts to 2.05
BILLION Dollars that got paid to employees via stock options. What did INTC
record? You'll love this:

. Under all of the plans, the option exercise price is equal to the fair market
value of Intel common stock at the date of grant. and later
Under APB No. 25, because the exercise price of the company's employee stock
options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant,
no compensation expense is recognized in the company's financial statements.

So, no expense recorded against income, even though we know they are buying
back stock to replace the exercised options to the tune of over 2 BILLION
dollars.

Anyway, enough of the rant! So, of the 4.008B listed under Stock Repurchases we
are only going to add back the difference between the total and that issued in
options (4.008 - 2.05 = 1.958)

So our calculations for this section are: Start with 4994 and add 538 + 10 +
1958 and subtract 23 - 306- 762 for a subtotal cash flow of $6.409B before
accounting for the investing stuff.

I hate trying to read those wide-screen posts, so in the interest of making
this a bit easier on folks, I'll rely on you to refer to the 10K when
appropriate.

OK, so our calculations have taken us to 6.409 Billion in FCF before the rest
of the adjustments.

In the investing section the entries are: Additions to PPE(which, from here on
I'll refer to as CAPEX) of (7309): Acquisitions of (883); Purchases of
Investments of (7141); Sales of investments of 15,398; and Other activities of
(260). With the exception of the CAPEX, the simple thing to remember in this
section is that what was subtracted you add back and what was added you
subtract out because with the exception of CAPEX, none of this stuff is from
operations, so we want to back out their impact on the bottom line.

However, depreciation was only 4131 for this period so it looks like INTC is
excess spending on CAPEX. As a rule of thumb, I like to make the two items of
equal value and back out the difference. It is a short-cut way that I take
which says: "If you maintain your equipment, you'll maintain your profits." I
know that this is simplistic, but it works to help me standardize how to
evaluate these numbers when I don't know squat about what the real needs might
be.

So, the calculations here are: 6409 + (7309-4131) + 883 + 7141 - 15398 + 260 =
$2,473 Millions or $2.473Billion in Free Cash Flow. Sounds like a lot of money
doesn't it? I know I'd like to have that much after a years business! However,
is it? Let's break it down into terms that might be a little more real for us.
Let's look at what the per share amount is.

The income statement says that there were 6.879 Billion shares outstanding
assuming dilution. So...(2.473/6.879)=$.36/share cash flow.

Is this a good amount of cash flow per share? I don't know. Let's compare it to
something I can understand, like a CD or an Investment-grade Bond yielding 5%.
Let's say INTC is selling for $20/share. Then a 5% CD or Bond would return
$20.00 X .05 = $1.00 or almost 3 times as much as what INTC returns.

Shouldn't that be the other way around? When I assume market risk, shouldn't I
get 2 or 3 times the return I can safely get? Not 1/3? Food for thought.

Some other interesting tidbits from INTC's 10K:

Stock option plans > The company has a stock option plan under which officers,
key employees and non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase
shares of the company's authorized but unissued common stock. The company also
has a broad-based stock option plan under which stock options may be granted to
all employees other than officers and directors. During 2001, the Board of
Directors approved an increase to the authorized shares under this plan, which
made an additional 900 million shares available for grant to employees other
than officers and directors.

900 MILLION more shares just waiting to be given out to insiders, doesn't that
just warm the cockles of your heart?

There are 768.5 MILLION shares worth of options outstanding that have already
been issued (although ONLY 230.9 MILLION appear to be currently exercisable
with the average exercise price of $11.27/share so at today's prices, insiders
can make a cool 50% profit and none of it will be viewed by INTC as
compensation.)

They did take a sensible position on Black-Scholes:
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the opinion
of management, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of employee stock options.

I liked some of this statement:
 In April 2001, the company acquired Cognet, Inc. in exchange for cash and 3.6
million unregistered shares of Intel common stock, of which approximately 1.4
million shares are contingent upon the continued employment of the founding
stockholders. An additional 900,000 registered shares are issuable to certain
employees contingent upon meeting certain performance criteria and are not
included in purchase consideration. In addition to the total common stock and
cash consideration of $156 million, payment of approximately $60 million in
cash compensation is contingent upon continued employment of certain employees
and meeting certain performance criteria. 

especially when combined with this one:
In addition to the transactions described above, Intel purchased other
businesses in seven smaller transactions in 2001 (thirteen in 2000 and seven in
1999). The 2001 transactions were in exchange for total consideration of $228
million, $73 million in cash and $147 million representing 3.2 million
unregistered shares of Intel common stock. Of these shares, 1.9 million shares
are contingent upon the continued employment of certain employees. The
remaining consideration of $8 million related to the value of assumed options.
A total of $153 million was allocated to goodwill for these transactions in
2001, while $71 million was allocated to deferred stock compensation and $22
million to purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D). Consideration
for the smaller transactions in 2000 was $513 million, with $477 million
allocated to goodwill, $5 million to intangibles and $10 million to IPR&D. In
1999, consideration for these transactions was $468 million, with $363 million
allocated to goodwill, $44 million to intangibles and $9 million to IPR&D.

Does that last bolded statement mean it gets added back into cash flow at some
point since amortization of Goodwill is a "non-cash" event? Makes me suspicious
of the $2.338 Billion in amortized goodwill added back in the top portion of
the SCF for 2001. If the investment decision was a close one, I'd have to try
to re-assure myself that this whole amount of Amortized Goodwill was eligible
to be added back instead of some of it being expensed. But it's not worth the
effort for me in light of the results so far.

Cash Flow Analysis---Intel
Page 5 (and final).

So, what's mt take on INTC as a company and as an investment?

Well, believe it or not, I thought they were more straightforward in their
accounting than DELL. I'm not out to nominate them for sainthood or anything,
but the "smell" wasn't as bad.

I think both INTC and DELL are great businesses and profitable at what they do.
They'd be great to work for, with all those options!

But as an investor, both appear to me to yield less than I could safely get in
a CD, so why would I risk my money?

But, in what I see as a sign that the Bear isn't done clawing yet, wherever I
have expressed my opinions, I have gotten amazing resistance to both the notion
of fully accounting for options and the notion that it's not OK that insiders
take all the profits. Amazing resistance. Until that goes away, the speculators
are still too active for me to have any confidence that capitulation has
occurred.

Hope I haven't been too confusing with this analysis.

Well, the arguments you bring up are good points, but that said, the problem is
that while one industry might have a low ROE, it might be a better value.

Additionally, ROE can be manipulated by various forms of off balance sheet
financing. Therefore, one should be "careful" buying companies with high ROEs.

Remember, Graham in his book "The Intelligent Investor" looks for companies
that have:

- D/E <.7
- Current Ratio > 2.0
- Profitable for the past 5 to 10 years.
- Consistently paid a dividend for the past 5 to 10 years.

Now is not the time to "bastardize" the definition of "value investing" by

OK, Grahamites: Dave and Paul,

I have a serious question for you. I am still struggling with what to do with
my 401(k). I can buy S&P500 index fund or I can buy value funds: KDHAX and
NBGEX as the large cap value and small cap value. I assume that since the funds
are handled through 401(k), I am not paying any load.

I don't like the index fund, since it may contain WCOMs and Enrons. I assume
the value guys do their homework and buy the Graham or Graham/Buffett or
Graham/their-own companies and avoid the risks of WCOMs and Enrons. However,
indexing was/is propagated as THE WAY by almost everyone. Even Buffett says
that market will return only 6% in the next five years and then turns around
and recommends buying index fund for average investor... :-(((

Now, regarding fund picking, what I would do is go to your local library and

Jurgis Bekepuris, re: 401. Both funds are rated highly by Morningstar. One has
a "small-blend" focus, and the other is Dreman's large cap. which is also more
concentrated.

I assume you're limited to these two "value stocks" by your administrator.

I'm familiar with Dreman's work; I know Neuberger is supposed to have a good
reputation, but I know nothing of this particular fund or its manager.

Making the choice really requires having some knowledge of your goals, how long
you plan to be in the 401K, your risk tolerance etc.

Without having this, I rely on my own preferences. Since I like diversification
and sticking with funds for long periods, I would put money in both funds above
as well as the index fund. But if I could only select one of the three, for
myself, I'd pick Dreman.

I'm not a fan of indexes. I'd like to risk more to make more. And I like to
spend the time to study and reflect on stocks and investing. I suspect I
should've been an indexer though, based on the results I've gotten for myself
over the past decades. Looking back, I would like to believe that had I a 401k
plan that allowed me to buy this index fund, I would be at least making some
allocation to it.

For you I'll guess maybe the S&P Index fund would work. Here you have a
set-and-forget fund (Who succeeds Dreman when he leaves?) that you might be
able to stick with (low transaction costs, some peace of mind, etc.) for 10 or
15 or more years. You have money outside of the 401 that you invest in other
ways, so you can use the S&P Index as a bogey to see how well you're doing with
your picks. If you're not a fan of Dreman or Neuberger's D'Alelio or their
picks, then I'd say don't invest in their funds. Or else if you find some
stocks they own that you'd like, you can buy those outside the fund (i.e.
outside the IRA.)

TB: Good analysis. I hope you have read my posts on Dell board which covered
the subject extensively.
The first mistake is for GAPP to allow the company to play with SE(shareholders
equity).
Employee compensation should go into three categories under expenses:
1. Short term: wages
2. Annual: bonuses.
3. multi-year: stock option trust.
4. Retirement: Pension trust.
We have some guidelines for everything except stock options.
Management should not touch SE, except a 2/3 majority vote by shareholders.
shareholders can allow % of retained earnings to be moved to option trust.
Shareholders need to vote on formulae for determining the distribution of
options among employees, so that senior management is not a lopsided
beneficiary.
Treasury stock was misused by modern management. Treasury stock should be used
only to retire stock for reverse dilution. Actually I don't like a company
buying back its stock, unless there is an improved investment strategy. To me a
management buying its stock indicates either foul play or incapability use
their cash properly.
Finally risk management and actuarial calculations should be used in managing
option trust.
I will go one step further. The board should be completely independent and
handle the allocation and even management of employees trusts and bonus
distribution. CFO should be an employee of the board. Comptroller can handle
the money management for operations.
It is amazing how these professionals claim ignorance in understanding
fiduciary responsibilities.
Unfortunately Dell shareholders will keep this stock in the 50 p/e ratio, even
without counting the losses due to option plans.
Good Luck.

When the market turned against them, they are showing a loss of $2.83B. They
are keeping this loss in treasury hoping that the market will turn around from
them. If the option exercise price is close to $25, they can recover the cash
by cash from option exercise and move the cash into stockholders equity.

Timba Bear, your analyses of DELL and INTC are masterpieces and everyone that
invests should read them. But I don't see the conclusion that the bear market
will continue to claw, i.e. the general market will drop lots further. Why
should your conclusions about stocks which were prominent players in the tech
bubble apply to, just for example, Wells Fargo Bank? It certainly looks like
the tech stocks should drop much much further. But even there, the CEOs can
save the situation if most of the stockholders are getting to understand
matters. They can simply take cognizance of the fact that engineers nowadays
are quite happy to stay with companies like DELL and INTC without any stock
options, just with their good salaries. So the granting of stock options, even
to management, could simply cease for a long while until the public goes back
to sleep. This would have the effect of multiplying the true earnings by a big
factor. Instantly Dell and Intc would become much more reasonable investments.
Another point. Stock options are just one of the ways to deceive. Basically I
think we have to look at the whole society to see to what extent honesty is
insisted upon. Of course no country is perfect but I personally would give the
Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands the highest marks in that regard.
After that I would place the U.S. and slightly under the U.S. comes Canada. I'm
not sure where to place the UK but I'm certain that Japan should be at the
bottom of the industrialized countries because democracy there is still
nascent. Stock options in Japan are still rare; outright deceit is common. A
company there can report good earnings and at the same time have a subsidiary
to which it is secretly lending huge sums for speculations. When the
speculations collapse so does the main company, very suddenly. It's a common
pattern. We've been talking about numbers; there is also attitude. When reading
the annual report do you get the sense that the company is incomparably great,
well nigh perfect --- is it a paean of self praise? If so then you don't have
to bother analyzing the numbers. Sober honesty and the surrounding regulatory
and societal attitudes are as important as the numbers, which is saying a lot.

price is it fairly valued, at what price is it over valued and given the
current environment it competes in..what are its long term prospects as an
investment within that envelope of possibilities?

This seems to be as much a commentary on speculators and insiders taking

Yes, I have read some of your recent posts on the DELL thread. Interesting
concepts! I'm thinking about your proposals, but haven't really come to any
conclusions because I'm not clear enough in my understanding of the
ramifications to be certain we wouldn't be creating just as many problems as we
might solve.

For instance: The board should be completely independent and handle the
allocation and even management of employees trusts and bonus distribution. CFO
should be an employee of the board.

I believe that part of the function of a Board of Directors (BOD) is to conduct
their oversight in an manner which accomplishes their function while promoting
the smooth and efficient conducting of business by the company whose operations
they oversee. In our horror over the abuses of the current system, we must be
careful that what we implement as corrective measures don't have the hidden
result of making it impossible for American businesses to do business
aggressively and nimbly, too much power on the BOD could turn that nimbly part
off. If great managers see opportunity and can't seize the moment, the
aggressive part may wither away as well.

The problem appears to be loopholes in the current system that make it legal to
both transfer an immense percentage of the profits of public companies to
insiders on the one hand and to take corporate expenses and transfer them to
the shareholder and thus not count them as expenses against income on the
other. These kind of problems are corrected most effectively (IMO) by
regulation which protects the investor's profits and require corporations to
fully expense all costs of doing business, and such regulation must have strict
enforcement and stiff penalties.

Thank you for your kind words.

But I don't see the conclusion that the bear market will continue to claw, i.e.
the general market will drop lots further. Why should your conclusions about
stocks which were prominent players in the tech bubble apply to, just for
example, Wells Fargo Bank?

The conclusion that this Bear market still has a lot of strength remaining,
came not from the analysis of the companies, but from the reaction of folks
over on the DELL threads here and at the Motley Fool. It appears that the
resistance to the method of expensing stock options at exercise rather than at
issuance comes mainly from accountant types who believe that some kind of
liability is incurred at issuance and thus should be expensed then and prorated
over the life of the option. While this may be correct according to the
currently accepted paradigm, it fails to address the real issue of improper
amounts being expensed and improper allocation of those cost as other than
income. [I'll tie this together in a moment]

The other main category of resistance seems to come from fans of DELL products
who also appear to be shareholders. They apparently focus on the "kick-butt"
manner in which DELL is effectively doing business. While it is certainly true
that DELL is a great business, that's not the issue.

[Attempting to tie it together now]
So the resistance from the accountant types combined with the refusal to
address the real issues concerning investment by shareholders combine to form a
picture of an investing population that is anything but depressed and wanting
nothing to do with the market or investing. My brief study of the history of
popped bubbles indicates to me that this isn't the general attitude at the
bottom of the troughs. Ergo, we have more room to the downside.

If this assessment is correct, then the addage on Wall Street: "A lowering tide
lowers all boats" will likely apply to the good companies as well as the bad.
Good companies may not go down as much percentage wise and may recover faster,
but they will likely participate in the main direction of the market.

Timba, enjoyed your Intel analysis.. although I was surprized to find terms
like "smell" and sainthood in the summary.

For me, there is a part of any analysis that is an "impression" of the overall
presentation by the company under scrutiny. This "impression" doesn't always
lend itself to accurate description by objective terminology. Or, if it does,
the length of time it would take to convey that accuracy may be not worth the
effort when a simple word like "smell" can convey the idea with a richness I
could not match with any number of words. "Sainthood" is another such word,
evocative of an idealized pristine image of goodness and rightness.

I deliberated whether to include any subjectivity in the analysis and decided
that it was appropriate in limited doses.

As far as price evaluation? I'm sorry, I must have conveyed that less clearly
than I wished. Per the financial results of the fiscal year 2001, at a price of
$4.37/share or under it would just marginally represent a level of investor
return of about 2 times the going risk-free rate of return which is the minimum
multiple I find offers sufficient enticement for me to move capital from safer
employment, anything over this price means that this investor is not adequately
being compensated for the level of risk being assumed.

This seems to be as much a commentary on speculators and insiders taking
profits? If that's so I'd suggest you construct two columns of numbers to
support that thesis.. the first column current valuations and the second
identical column with stock option payouts plowed back into the company (or
never taken out, or lets just say left as cash at CD rates).. what would be the
stock price be? To make the stock options argument this would be a better
course of reasoning.

The analysis is an attempt to discern the true level of cash flowing through
operations activity. I really don't concern myself with speculator activity in
the framework of these analyses.(Perhaps you were referring to my commentary on
the feedback I got from posters to other sites that caused me to conclude that
speculation was still running too rampant for this to have been a market
bottom?) However, insiders taking more than 20% of the profits and hiding that
fact through cleverly applied accounting, does appear to have a major impact on
the cash that is remaining after the depredations and that impact has been
revealed to me more clearly as a result of the SCF analysis. I believe I have
shown via the company's own statements on the 10K, numbers it has given in
footnotes, and an analysis of the Statement of Cash Flows, a close
approximation of the true profitability of the company and a close
approximation of the cost of exercised stock options.

If someone wanted to extropolate that information into other ways of looking at
the numbers, I'd be interested to see the results.

Real Estate industry did a thorough overhaul on how fiduciary responsibilities
need to be handled.

I have had a real estate license for many years(now inactive) and a mortgage
broker's license (still active). The impact of the overhauls have been eroded.
The intent was honest disclosure, the reality is that the real estate agent
doesn't accept responsibility for being on either side of the fence, instead
they often represent neither the buyer nor the seller. The result has been
poorer service, in general, to both buyers and sellers. Another result has been
higher incidence of owners selling directly and a general lowering of the
commissions being commanded by realtors. Is the industry today any more or less
honest than when the regulations were put in place? I don't think so. Is the
end result quite what the reformers envisioned? I suspect it is somewhat
different.

Some overhauls were in the mortgage area. RESPA was an act intended to separate
services like insurance, title, appraisal, financing, etc. so that areas of
potential conflict of interest could be eliminated. RESPA has no teeth. Great
Act, but very little enforcement action. The offshoot? Controlled business
arrangements have mortgage companies within real estate offices paying the
brokers to direct business to them (in a legally acceptable manner, of
course)...that is...usually, referral fees for title work, etc., etc. Has
anything gotten more "arms length" throughout this process? Doesn't appear that
way to me.

It is not fair to the CEOs to force them into mixing fiduciary
responsibilities. You are asking too much of these people. And they are taking
the easiest way out.

I'm sorry, but if one chooses to accept a position of responsibility in a
publicly traded corporation, then it is not too much to expect them to act in
an honest, upright, fiduciarily responsible manner as part of their job title.
If it is, no amount regulatory change or BOD set-up will help.

I think we both want to see changes effected that will encourage appropriate
behavior and accurate reporting of results. You are approaching the changes
from a corporate structure standpoint and I from accounting regulation and
enforcement standpoint. I hope that significant, effective changes will be made
to both areas. I just don't want to kill the patient with the cure.

>>Law says that you cannot be fiduciary to dual interests.

This is an interesting problem. If we look at company stocks throughout the
1990's stockholders equity has been deteriorating relative to revenues and
profits as the company management’s have been collecting and selling company
stocks through options. Wonder how things like this can be proven that the
Boards of Directors were not meeting their fiduciary responsibility.

I am sure Lawyers with fight this in the courts during the next 10 years.

TB.. re INTC analysis, here's a conservative quick analysis done by VectorVest
that puts value at $9.48. (fwiw)

"&#160;VectorVest Stock Analysis of Intel
&#160;
Thank you for requesting an analysis of Intel from VectorVest. The ticker
symbol for Intel is INTC. INTC is traded on the NASDAQ and options are
available on this stock.
&#160;
PRICE: INTC closed on 08/16/2002 at $18.75 per share.
&#160;
VALUE: INTC has a Value of $9.48 per share. Value is the foundation of the
VectorVest system. It is a measure of what a stock is currently worth. Value is
based upon earnings, earnings growth rate, dividend payments, dividend growth
rate, and financial performance. Current interest and inflation rates also play
an important role in the computation of Value. When interest and/or inflation
rates decrease, Value goes up. When interest rates and inflation increase,
Value goes down. Sooner or later a stock's Price and Value always converge.
&#160;
RV (Relative Value): INTC has an RV of 0.62. On a scale of 0.00 to 2.00, an RV
of 0.62 is poor. RV reflects the long-term price appreciation potential of the
stock compared to an alternative investment in AAA Corporate Bonds. Stocks with
RV ratings above 1.00 have attractive upside potential. A stock will have an RV
greater than 1.00 when its Value is greater than Price, and its Relative Safety
(see below) and forecasted earnings growth rate are above average. In some
cases, however, a stock's RV will be above 1.00 even though its Value is well
below Price. This happens when a stock has an exemplary record of financial
performance and an above average earnings growth rate. In this case, the stock
is currently selling at a premium, and the investor is banking on future
earnings growth to drive the stock's price higher. This information is very
useful not only in knowing whether or not a stock has favorable price
appreciation potential, but it also solves the riddle of whether to buy high
growth, high P/E, or low growth, low P/E stocks. We believe that RV ratings
above 1.00 are required to consistently achieve above average capital gains in
the stock market.
&#160;
RS (Relative Safety): INTC has an RS rating of 1. On a scale of 0.00 to 2.00,
an RS of 1 is fair. VectorVest looks at safety from the viewpoint of an equity
investor (one who is buying stock of a company) rather than that of a purchaser
of debt (one who is lending money to the company). From this perspective,
consistency of financial and operating performance, stock price appreciation
history, and price volatility are the key factors used in the evaluation of
Relative Safety (RS). Debt to equity ratio, capitalization, sales volume,
business longevity and other factors are also considered, but to a lesser
degree.

VectorVest favors steady, predictable performers. All stocks are rated on a
scale of 0.00 to 2.00. A stock with an RS greater than 1.00 is safer and more
predictable than the average of all stocks. A stock with an RS less than 1.00
is less predictable and riskier than the average stock.
&#160;
RT (Relative Timing): INTC has an RT rating of 0.6. On a scale of 0.00 to 2.00,
an RT of 0.6 is poor. RT is a fast, responsive, short-term price trend
indicator. It analyzes the direction, magnitude, and dynamics of a stock's
price behavior over the last 13 weeks; then reflects and projects the
short-term price performance of the stock. Once a stock's Price has established
a strong trend, it is expected to continue that trend for the short-term. If
the trend dissipates, RT will gravitate towards 1.00. Should the price change
dramatically, RT will notice the crucial turning point. When warranted, it will
explode from a Price low and dive from a Price high.

All stocks are rated on a scale of 0.00 to 2.00. If RT is above 1.00,the
stock's Price is in an uptrend. Below 1.00, the stock's Price is in a
downtrend.
&#160;
VST-Vector (VST): INTC has a VST-Vector rating of 0.76. On a scale of 0.00 to
2.00, an VST of 0.76 is poor. VST-Vector solves the dilemma of balancing Value,
Safety and Timing. Stocks with high RV values often have low RS values, or
stocks with low RV and RS values have high RT's. How can we find the stocks
with the best combinations of Value, Safety, and Timing?

The classic vector formula (square root of the sum of the squares) handles this
problem. It combines a set of forces into a single indicator for ranking every
stock in the VectorVest database. Stocks with the highest VST-Vector have the
best combinations of Value, Safety and Timing. These are the ones to own for
above average capital application.
&#160;
GRT (Growth Rate): INTC has a GRT of -2 % per year. This is very poor. GRT
stands for forecasted Earnings Growth Rate in percent per year. GRT is updated
each week for every stock. Watch GRT trends very carefully. If the GRT trend is
up, the stock's Price will likely rise. If the GRT trend is down, the stock's
Price will increase more slowly, cease to increase, or subsequently fall.
&#160;
Recommendation (REC): INTC has a Hold recommendation. REC reflects the
cumulative effect of all the VectorVest parameters working together. These
parameters are designed to help investors buy safe, undervalued stocks which
are rising in price, and to avoid or sell risky, overvalued stocks which are
falling in price.

VectorVest is tuned to give an "H" or "B" signal when a stock's price is
approximately 10% above a recent low, and an "S" signal when the stock's price
is approximately 10% below a recent high. High RV, RS stocks are favored toward
receiving "B" REC's, and sheltered from receiving "S" RECs.
&#160;
STOP-PRICE: INTC has a Stop-Price of 18.38 per share. This is 0.37 or 2.0 %
below its current closing Price. VectorVest analyzes over 7,400 stocks each day
for Value, Safety and Timing, and calculates a Stop-Price for each stock. These
Stop-Prices are based upon 13 week moving averages of closing prices, and are
fine-tuned according to each stock's fundamentals.

In the VectorVest system, a stock gets a "B" or an "H" recommendation if its
price is above its Stop-Price, and an "S" recommendation if its price is below
its Stop-Price.
&#160;
DIV (Dividend): INTC pays an annual dividend of 0.08 per share. VectorVest
focuses on annual, regular, cash dividends indicated by the most recent
disbursement. Special distributions, one-time payments, stock dividends, etc.,
generally are not included in Dividend (DIV).
&#160;
DY (Dividend Yield): INTC has a DY of 0.4 percent. This is below the current
market average of 1.1 %. DY equals 100 x (DIV/PRICE), and is expressed as a
percentage.
&#160;
EY (Earnings Yield): INTC has an EY of 3.81%. This is below the current market
average of 3.83%. EY equals 100 x (EARNINGS PER SHARE/PRICE), and is expressed
as a percentage.
&#160;
EPS (Earnings Per Share): INTC has an EPS of $0.71 per share. EPS stands for
leading 12 months Earnings Per Share. VectorVest determines this forecast from
a combination of recent earnings performance and traditional fiscal and/or
calendar year earnings forecasts.
&#160;
P/E (Price to Earnings Ratio): INTC has a P/E ratio of 26.41. This ratio is
computed daily based upon Price and EPS. P/E = Price/EPS.
&#160;
GPE (Growth to P/E Ratio): INTC has a GPE of -0.08. This ratio suggests that
INTC is overvalued. Growth to P/E ratio is a popular measure of stock valuation
which compares Earnings Growth Rate (GRT) to Price Earnings ratio (P/E). A
stock is considered to be undervalued when GPE is greater than 1.00, and
vice-versa. VectorVest believes that RV is a much better indicator of long-term
value. The RV of 0.62 for INTC is poor.
&#160;
DS (Dividend Safety): INTC has a DS of 68. On a scale of 0 to 99, a DS of 68 is
good. DS is defined as the assurance that regular cash dividends will be
declared and paid at current or at higher rates for the foreseeable future.
Stocks with DS values above 50 on a scale of 0 to 99 are above average in
safety.
&#160;
RISK (Dividend Risk): INTC has a Dividend Risk of Med. All stocks in the
VectorVest system that pay dividends are classified as having Low, Medium or
High Dividend Risk (RISK). Stocks with DS values above 50 are above average in
safety. These stocks are classified as having LOW or MEDIUM RISK. Stocks with
DS values below 50 are below average in safety and are classified as having
HIGH Risk.
&#160;
DG (Dividend Growth): INTC has a DG of 8 percent per year. Dividend Growth is a
subtle yet important indicator of a company's historical financial performance
and the board's current outlook on the future use of funds.
&#160;
YSG-VECTOR (Yield-Safety-Growth Vector): INTC has a YSG-Vector of 0.91. On a
scale of 0.00 to 2.00, a YSG-Vector rating of 0.91 is fair. VectorVest combines
Dividend YIELD, SAFETY and GROWTH into a single parameter. YSG-Vector allows
direct comparison of all dividend paying stocks. Stocks with the highest
YSG-Vector values have the best combinations of Dividend Yield, Safety and
Growth. These are the stocks to buy for above average current income and
long-term growth.
&#160;
VOL(100)s: INTC traded 54599500 shares on 08/16/2002.
&#160;
AVG VOL(100)s: INTC has an Average Volume of 65546300. Average Volume is 50 day
moving average of daily volume as computed by VectorVest.
&#160;
% VOL: INTC had a Volume change of -16.7% from its 50 day moving average
volume.
&#160;
OPEN: INTC opened trading at $18.06 per share on 08/16/2002.
&#160;
HIGH: INTC traded at a high of $19.02 per share on 08/16/2002.
&#160;
LOW: INTC traded at a low of $17.98 per share on 08/16/2002.
&#160;
CLOSE: INTC Closed trading at $18.75 per share on 08/16/2002.
&#160;
% PRC: INTC showed a Price change of 0.8% from the prior day's closing price.
&#160;
INDUSTRY: INTC has been assigned to the Electronic (Semicndtr Mfg) Group.
VectorVest classifies stocks into over 190 Industry Groups and 50 Business
Sectors.
&#160;
INTC has about average safety with well below average upside potential. It
reflects a stock which is likely to give well below average, relatively
consistent returns over the long term.
&#160;
The basic strategy of VectorVest is to buy low risk, high reward stocks. We
suggest that Prudent investors buy enough high Relative Value, high Relative
Safety stocks to keep the overall RV and RS ratings of their portfolios above
1.00. As you do this, you'll find that your risk will go down and your
investment performance will improve. Not a bad combination. Thank you for your
interest in VectorVest.

Steve, re eln. Just discovered that eln has a putable convertible. My
understanding is that eln has to provide 61.65 in cash or stock on 12/14/03.
Since the convert sells for about 26 the street seems to be betting that the

Joan:It is an interesting concept you brought out.
Here is another analysis using Dell as an example.

From the time Dell went public to 2001 Dell bought stock at an average price og
$10 (officially). But actually their average price has to be higher more like
$30. The remainder is profits from buying calls and selling puts. That is
$20/shr on the 900M shares was swept under the rug. Of course that profit would
have been wiped out because selling these shares to employees (mostly
management) at an average cost of $10. So the $20 handout was hidden from
shareholders. Now that Dell has to take the loss on the puts, they are
conveniently taking $2.8B from shareholder equity.

I don't think independent boards are going to be a problem and the system will
force this in the end.

Companies like Dell and Intel would have a hard time showing profits if they
would expense options and the public would not own the stocks when it is
crystal clear that they are not generating wealth for the stockholder - then
management could not have the salaries they have been making. These companies
are going to fight this to the end since the balance sheets can not handle the
salaries including options that these boys and girls have been making.

Provo, Utah-based Novell said it finished the SilverStream acquisition on
Friday by merging a wholly owned subsidiary of Novell into SilverStream.

On Wednesday, Novell completed its cash tender offer, purchasing 23.4 million

Paul,

Re NOVL. I had a position in NOVL several years back and spent a fair amount of
time researching the company. By all rights it should be a good company but
their marketing is pathetic. They have some top quality programmers and their
software will run circles around anything Microsoft offers.

I went to one of their sales seminars, mainly to hear their pitch, and left
shaking my head in pure wonder. Their sales people looked like unmade beds and
a video of the seminar could have been used in a class on salesmanship on what
not to do. The software has to be good enough to sell itself or it wouldn't
sell at all. I think there are a lot of good things about Novell, but they've
proven themselves to be totally helpless with curing their marketing problems
year after dreary year. NOVL used to be a pretty good little trading stock if
you bought the dips and didn't get too greedy on the bounces, but until they
overcome their marketing problems it probably isn't a stock to fall in love
with long term. There used to be around $4 per share in cash until the company
did a massive buy back in the $10-$30 per share range to get insider's stock
and options deep in the money. It's been all downhill since.

There used to be some fairly savvy regulars on the NOVL thread. It might be
worthwhile to go through some posts to get a feel for what the current thinking
is on the company.

I've STILL not got it right regarding NOVL's cash/sh amount.

If I'm going to subtract the cash that SilverStream stockholders were paid by
NOVL, then I should add back the cash that NOVL gets that's in SilverStream
coffers when NOVL takes over the company.

Maybe I can get a little closer to the true number from a 6/10 press release:
"Assuming a closing of the acquisition in July 2002, with approximately 23.6
million shares projected to be outstanding, which includes estimated option
exercises prior to the closing date, the total cash acquisition price before
acquisition fees will be approximately $212 million. In that event, cash on
SilverStream's balance sheet is expected to total approximately $100 million,
which would yield a net cash outlay by Novell of approximately $112 million."

So using current Yahoo Profile figures, $683.3M cash - $112M cash outlay =
$571.3M. And that is $1.57/sh., based on 364.3M shares outstanding. NOVL stock
closed Monday @$1.85. Close to cash, but not below cash.
I also need to find out if SilverStream has appreciable ltd that goes on NOVL's
books. If so, my statement about no ltd for NOVL is wrong also.

TALES OF THE TAPE:Sector Suffers,JDS Uniphase Gets Bigger

By JOHNATHAN BURNS

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
(This report was first published Friday afternoon.)
NEW YORK -- When Agere Systems Inc. (AGRA) announced earlier this week it would
exit the optoelectronics business via a sale or unit shutdown, investors sent
the stock higher - an acknowledgment that the optical component business is in
shambles.

But Agere's stock movement was dwarfed by a surge at peer JDS Uniphase Corp.
(JDSU). On Wednesday, the day of the announcement, Agere rose 8% but JDS
Uniphase gained 17%.

Why the jump for JDS Uniphase shares, especially considering Agere Chief
Executive John Dickson's comments following the company's decision?

"We believe the optoelectronics business has changed fundamentally and for the
long term," he said. "With the excess capacity in the core (of the) network, we
do not believe there will be significant levels of buying for some years to
come."

Simply put, the worse the market for optical components gets, the more dominant
JDS Uniphase becomes.

And Agere held as much as 12% market share in the once red-hot optical
components market, Dickson said in a Wednesday conference call.

What is happening - and has been with increasing frequency since the slowdown
in telecom equipment spending began two years ago - is a kind of "component
Darwinism," says CIBC World Markets analyst Jim Jungjohann.

"The Telecom Bubble is no different than all the other boom and bust cycles,
including Dutch Tulipmania, the English South Sea bubble, the Mississippi
Company bubble in France, the great crash of 1929, Japanese real estate in the
late 1980s and the more recent Internet crash," said Jungjohann. "It's a
textbook case of what happens when an unsustainable glut of new, easily funded
entrants are attracted to a market at a rate that overshoots the industry's
long-term carrying capacity."

And, despite its acquisition streak (it has written down more than $50 billion
in goodwill related to mergers), JDS Uniphase is expected to have enough cash
to last well into a sector recovery, as elusive as that now seems to be. The
company had $1.45 billion in cash equivalents and short-term investments at the
end of the June quarter and no long-term debt.

"JDS Uniphase looks like 'the' survivor, with its strong balance sheet and
product breadth," said Jungjohann, who does not own any JDS Uniphase stock.
CIBC has provided investment banking services for JDS Uniphase, Nortel Networks
Corp. (NT) and Agere.

Indeed, the carnage in the sector will continue to mount.

Agere joins an already lengthy list of companies, including Nortel, Corning
Inc. (GLW), New Focus Inc. (NUFO), ADC Telecommunications (ADCT) and Finisar
Corp. (FNSR), who have shuttered or announced plans to close or sell part or
all of their optical components business.

Mark Langley, analyst with Needham & Co., said there are about 1,100 private
optical component suppliers, mostly in the U.S.

"There are a lot of companies that will not survive until a market recovery,"
he said.

Langley said he expects only 5% to 10% of those companies to survive if the
depressed levels of equipment buying continues until late 2004.

Needham currently makes a market in shares of JDS Uniphase and Finisar. In the
case of Agere and Corning, he and his associate have received compensation upon
various factors, including quality of research, investor client feedback and
Needham's overall revenue, which may include investment banking revenues.
"(Agere's decision to exit optoelectronics) is a good move for Agere," said
Langley. "I think it's a positive indication for JDS Uniphase, but a dark day
for the industry, and the reason I say that is Agere really was the poster
child for automation in optoelectronics."

"In a more robust business environment, this was Agere's crown jewel," he
added. "They had $1.2 billion in optoelectronics revenue in 2001, and $431
million in operating income, according to our estimates."

By comparison, Agere said optoelectronics accounted for only about $56 million
of sales in the most recent quarter.

So one would assume JDS Uniphase would be a safe haven for investors playing
the component market, right?

It depends on how long investors are willing to wait.

Langley still sees the threat of further bankruptcies in the carrier space and
a constrained capital market, which is causing carriers to conserve cash by
reducing equipment purchases.

"In January 2001, we (developed) a bankruptcy predictor," Langley said, adding
that the model was based on the Altman Z-Score developed in 1968 by Edward
Altman. "Only nine of the 38 leading wireline service providers were considered
to be in a safe zone. In November, only nine of the 38 were. Now, we are down
to 20 companies. Only one service provider is clearly not a candidate for
bankruptcy. Two were in the gray zone. The rest were candidates for
bankruptcy."

In other words, the industry has deteriorated, not improved, in 2002. And even
though there are some signs of bandwidth pricing stabilization, the state of
the carriers and credit markets indicates spending on equipment may not see
growth for some time.

Langley estimates by the end of JDS Uniphase's fiscal year 2003 next June, the
company will have roughly $1.1 billion in cash equivalents and short-term
investments and about the same at the end of calendar 2003.

And that cash will likely came in handy, since getting bigger is not being
accompanied by better sales as the steepest downtown in telecom equipment
spending continues.

Bob Rudd, re. SGR, could you direct me to a site where the components of SGR's
backlog are discussed? I'd like to know how valuable those government contracts
might be as compared to contracts from the power industry. Also, if any of
SGR's contracts are renewable in the sense that they're maintenance related,
I'd like to understand that too. I assume environmental (site cleanups) and
power (plant buildout) are projects. I'll guess that if there are renewable
contracts, that's a more steady but maybe lower-profit business than
project-completion business, which I see as more cyclical.

Paul SGR's backlog: I wish I could tell you I dug it out of the filings by
scrutinizing minutia with squinty eyes, but, in fact, I took the lazy way and
read in brokerage reports from Merrill and Lehman that aren't publicly
available. I suspect the info is in the filings and/or on their site, but
that's not how I got it. They recently [4/30] acquired bankrupt IT Group, and
environmental and infrastructure company [Like 2000 acquisition of bankrupt
Stone & Webster]. This added $2billion to their backlog. There are probably
filings that discuss in depth the pro-forma before and after related to that
acquisition. As to the portion of renewable, annuity-like contracts as opposed
to project driven...I'm not sure, but I suspect size, diversification, and
forward booking of contracts help smooth the revenue stream more than annuity
like service revenues

Fwiw, I've started a very small position in CSPI. Sells below cash value with

Some portion of their sales are sometimes to the defense department. (i.e. they

Any thoughts on TWTC? They look like a CLEC survivor with positive cash flow
before capex, most of their debt in bonds not due until 2008 and later and
solid tangible book value.

TWTC may well be one of the few survivor CLECs. Most people have so much hatred
for the sector after so many have gone bk and burnt investors, that it is hard
to put more money into sector ( yes, i am talking about myself). thanks for
idea. I think the IPP (Independent Power Producers) aka Merchant power
companies - MIR, CPN, RRI, REI, DYN etc are more attractive investments if you
like totally beaten down crapped out stocks with potential. larry

Much of TWTC's appeal is their manageable debt load and healthy balance sheet
(not to mention $750m in undrawn credit lines if they need them). ALGX is an
example of a debt bomb likely to implode by next year.

The IPP's have too many debt bombs going off right and left. Some will come out
fine and others will wither and die. I would rather focus on companies that
have made it through the gauntlet intact.

I also have OCPI and RSTN in the "beaten down and crapped out" category based
mostly on their cash on hand. COGI is another sad puppy, a profitable business
that grew too quickly and needs to sort out its dilution situation. But I see
very little downside for COGI from the 1.68 level.

TimbaBear, if I could find a profitable or at-breakeven company selling below
cash value and with no ltd, I'd likely buy the stock. I don't recall seeing any
that meet all these criteria. Might you have come across any that fit? (aside:
I have seen a couple that look odd to me, eg. a finance stock with ltd shown as
n/a selling well below cash/sh, yet also selling above book value.)

As far as relating these stocks that sell below cash value to my portfolio...
combined, they make up maybe 5% of my portfolio. So far in total, they are not
working out. Although some of the companies seem to be making progress to
reduce cash burn, most are seeing continuing declines in sales and further
declines in their stock price. Some of the $1-2 stocks that were below cash
value are now selling for under $1 and below a now also lessened cash/sh value.
Further, it seems to me those stocks that appear to be holding on to their cash
are being ignored in this market, and their stock prices have also come down.

I'll guess the best % performer in my basket so far is MCsweet's and the the
thread's 2001 3-pick of SOFN.

Paul, no I don't know of any profitable enterprises selling currently for less
than cash. However, when Graham was writing after the end of the depression,
there apparently were enough so that he was talking about 100 or so in a
portfolio of such companies. If this Bear market is of similar historical
proportions, we may still have the opportunity.

Companies that were not profitable during the boom times, in a boom industry do
not seem to offer much hope to me for anything other than a loss of my
investment, regardless of how small the exposure. Since they haven't found a
profitable way to conduct business and haven't seen fit to recognize that and
sell the business or its assets and return the rest to shareholders, I can only
contemplate that the trend will continue until the cash burn forces bankruptcy.

I can sometimes consider "unloved", but when it comes to "unprofitable" it must
be for some other reason than "We haven't figured out how to give it away and
make money"

But, like you, I have been wrong too many times to count and could be wrong in
this as well.

Doug Nadworny: Medimals update: Looks like they are all doing lousy business
with claims exceeding their expectations. I've looked now at ACAP again. It's a
good continuation of what you liked last year: insider buys and stock buybacks.
They've been raising rates, lowering policy limits, etc. trying to stay ahead
of claims expense.

I may start an exploratory position. It seems like it might be an "almost
reasonable" bet for an "eventual recovery". All in quotes because insurance
business is so arcane: nearly impossible to analyze and understand, plus the
ramifications of ACAP's being in both physicians insurance and workers comp.

About ACAP, they are in a bad business. Juries are always finding for the
patient even when the doctor is a true expert. Do you think they have a handle
on pricing? The record doesn't show it. Hence the stock sells for 17+ when the
book value is 29+. The buyers want several years insulation against big losses.
If they in fact do make 50 cents a share in 2003 then they are selling at 35
times the earnings to be reported in January 2004, which is a long way off.
With a stock like that in your portfolio you'd have to keep analyzing and
reanalyzing. Do you have all that spare time?
Lots of luck.

re. TWTC. Looks like it could work. Short term, as stock continues its recovery
from the depths because of belief that it'll be one of the few survivors. Long
term bet too as they execute their business plan. Seems like with their loans
under control, and their focused management, they could be a viable competitor.

Hard to see when/if they'll make money. Doesn't seem to me to be a classic

SGR: I'll take a very small amount. Company is dominant or strong in several
areas. In past, seems like stock has cratered when piping business declined.
This time, fall likely won't be so severe because of company diversification.
(maybe)

Glancing at Yahoo profile, there's cash cushion so debt doesn't seem
particularly onerous.

If stock is near lows, it should eventually recover. The company is expected to
be profitable this year and next.
If stock does drop to new lows - and those lows have been really low in the
past - I want to own few enough shares that I'm willing to add more as stock
drops.
