TimbaBear,

SYBB, a Canadian biotech is terminating its research program and liquidating
its assets. Cash and current assets are similar to liabilities and the
remaining property and "capital assets" just about cover the current market cap
of $10 million, if you are conservative and assume they get a little less than
the stated value.

However, it also owns 6.3 million shares of ONCY, worth at today's price, $14.5
million, though these may be locked up for a while.

Any opinion?

Regarding SYBB.....

Since current assets (sans the ONCY holdings) seem to be on a par with
liabilities (I say: "seem" because I haven't dug into the numbers), I guess
what you're looking into here is whether buying SYBB at today's prices will
yield you a profit when the company is fully liquidated.

I don't know.

My guesses are: 1) It depends on how long it takes until final distribution to
shareholders, and what other expenses are incurred during the interim and what
the performance of ONCY will be until the shares are liquidated. 2) The method
of liquidation may serve to drive down the price of ONCY.

On point number 1, it seems to me that expenses are always underestimated, the
value of assets seem to be always overestimated, and the timing is always
longer than anticipated.

Considering these issues, I would want a very lucrative final settlement
possibility in order to assume the risks.

Which brings me to point 2. A quick look at the chart and the headlines for
ONCY raise more doubts and concerns than they ease. The chart looks like a
falling knife, and the headlines indicate that a major product/partner haven't
panned out as hoped for.

If ONCY maintained a valuation of the current market cap of $14.5 million, and
if this amount was the amount to be distributed to shareholders(an eventuality
I consider very remote), then with 39.7 million shares outstanding, this would
amount to $.365/share. The going price is $.23/share. So the upside appears to
be a 50% gain.

The downside is 100% loss. So I just don't see the edge here.

I don't like those numbers for my own investing/speculating.

TimbaBear,

Thanks for your input and your concerns are shared by me. However one can
consider buying SYBB as buying ONCY at a 33% discount and also having the
liquidation payout as a floor. The assets are stated at $12 million US so even
at only 50c on the dollar that would support 2/3 of the current share price.

As you said, the payoff really depends on the future of ONCY, a stock that has
been halved the the last few days.What is it's future? I don't know but I
believe stocks that have gone thru selling climaxes are potentially excellent
trades and particularly when we have the above situation.

I took a small position in SYBB today.

My target on this stock is in the high single digits. The thing that is holding
this stock down is the management. I think they tend to send business from BAMM
to other companies they own. Doesnt seem quite right to me if that is truy

Seems to me the big question is what is ONCY worth. Or better yet, what will it
be worth in 6-12 months or whenever.

If they adopt liquidation based accounting then they will have to go ahead and
charge off all reasonably estimatible costs and perhaps write UP the ONCY
shares if they own them at a gain. Of course, they would still have to be
booked at a discount probably.

I like liquidation plays. But what if ONCY trades down to its book value ?

No insider buying in either company to look at for clues.

I think high single digits is very possible for BAMM as the street piles on in
the same way they got out a few years ago, but I would probably scale out as it
goes up. Right now, I am not finding a whole lot of opportunities so I should
probably consider adding to my position. But I have a hard time averaging up
like that.

I mean, $4.50 or so in the next few months and I would lock in some gains and
hold the rest for higher prices. I feel pretty good about $6 anyway within 2
years.

If the insiders stepped in and bought shares at these levels, I might add more.

I am just about desparate to find stocks that meet my buying criteria. (Below
book, NCA and/or low PE ratio with significant insider buying at prices no
higher than the insiders paid)

I still am comfortable with DIYH as I feel in the worst case scenario it will
increase at LEAST 20% over the next 18-24 months. I believe there is a chance
for more significant prices but at current prices (99 cents) I see almost NO
longterm downside risk. In a market like this, 20% with little if any downside
and perhaps 30-50% more upside possible (on top of the 20%) in 18-24 months is
acceptable for me.

A lot depends on the real estate market in Cleveland.

Lengthy report on WM:

I follow WM for my investment club and bought more shares shortly after I filed
this report.

- Kris

Cover Sheet

Date: January 8, 2002
Company/Symbol: Washington Mutual / WM

1. What do they do and how do they make money? (Crayon Test) Financial services
company (thrift) serving consumers and small to mid-sized businesses. It does:
mortgage banking, consumer banking, commercial banking, financial services and
consumer finance.

2. Anticipated source of future growth? WM is gaining new customers as it
expands in the east, NYC, and the south. Recent acquisitions were Dime Corp.
and the U.S.-based mortgage-lending unit of National Australia Bank Ltd.
(called “very low risk” and meaning they are less reliant on tech-heavy
California.)

Because WAMU is both a lender and a mortgage banker, they can generate income
throughout different interest rate environments with products and services like
commercial banking, consumer finance, securities brokerage, mutual fund
management and property/casualty/life insurance, and CDs. They attract new
checking account customers with no-fee checking, and then can cross-sell other
products.

3. If stock price has dropped, why? Jim Jubak 11/6/01: Lower interest rates
have raised fears on Wall Street that Washington Mutual could see a drop in
business as homebuyers switch from the adjustable-rate mortgage where the
thrift is strongest to fixed-rate mortgages. The picture I believe is a little
more complicated -- and much more positive -- than those worries suggest.
First, drops in interest rates also have a positive effect on Washington
Mutual, increasing the thrift's margins in its mortgage business. And second,
management has done an effective job hedging the effects of shifts in the
mortgage market by using such tactics as selling part of the existing portfolio
when asset prices climb due to falling rates. In my opinion, the drop in
Washington Mutual is overdone.

Kris: A few years ago when Greenspan was raising fed rates we saw a contraction
of WAMU's stock price because of the resultant squeeze on their margins. Most
thrifts suffered then. The recent fed cuts, which make it cheaper to borrow
money, have fueled a surge of mortgage business as buyers move to take
advantage of lower rates through both refinancing and new loans. Savings and
loans stocks are generally viewed as defensive plays. They perform best when
the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates and the stocks of more
fast-growing companies, like technology firms, are falling. If you're convinced
the economy has bottomed out and tech companies are ready to get back on track,
then you might not want to buy WAMU. Bottom line: This is a company growing
earnings at a compound rate over 20% and it is selling for around 8 times
earnings!

ValueLine: They boosted their loan loss provision substantially, and the market
sold off. Wamu set aside far more reserves than needed to stay ahead of the
curve.

Concern: weakening economy, rising job losses and consumer debt. The number of
residential mortgage holders who were 30 days or more delinquent on their loans
rose to 4.87% in the third quarter, up 0.24% from the second quarter, the
Mortgage Bankers Association said. “The weakening GDP and job losses in the
technology and manufacturing sectors have affected homeowners’ ability to keep
their mortgage payments current,” said a chief economist of MBA.

4. What is the Fair Value?
Kris’ Graham Calculation (using only 8% EPS growth and maximum PE of 8.5):
Graham Fair Value: $67.27
Current Price: $32.47
Percent Growth to Fair Value: 107.17%

VectorVest:
PRICE: WM closed on 01/04/2002 at $33.73 per share.

VALUE: WM has a Value of $51.12 per share.

5. Does the company have a sustainable advantage gained through business
momentum, patents, a quasi-monopoly, visionary leadership, a proprietary
product, new technology, great management and/or inept competition?

Yes, they have a seasoned management team that's been together for many years.
They know how to grow. They are innovative risk-takers with a conservative,
careful bent, in my opinion.

They have a strong and growing brand. It test well, perhaps because of the
connotation of George Washington, or perhaps because people associate
"Washington" with the word "trust," D.C., or whatever. The brand has
successfully crossed the chasm from local thrift ("The friend of the family")
to national player. The Occasio retail concept pioneered in Las Vegas has
broken all internal expectations. It's innovative. It's low cost. Customers
like it. It tests well.

Size counts, and so does geographic coverage. WAMU is now the largest thrift in
the country. As they grow and integrate, they Increase efficiency, lowering
relative costs while increasing scale. Washington Mutual has a history of
successfully integrating acquisitions.

They know how to treat customers. In May, WAMU was the winner of the Satmetrix
Best Customer Satisfaction Award for the financial services category.
"Washington Mutual distinguished itself further by being one of only a few
national banks to score higher than its regional competitors." WAMU uses
comprehensive feedback systems and a number of incentive programs to assess and
reward high levels of customer satisfaction.

6. Are the Net Profit Margins 10% or greater? Yes: 14.9% (SmartMoney)

7. Is the future PE less than 30? Yes: 8.5 Is the PEG ratio below 1.0? Yes: .68

8. Is the 200-day average on an upward trend? No; turned down November 1.

9. If the stock has dropped suddenly on bad news, have I waited 5-7 weeks for a
base to form? Yes Am I sure this is the only bad news? Should I wait till the
next quarter’s announcement? If not, what’s the urgency to buy now? WM’s price
started to fall in September and reached a bottom on November 1. It is starting
to climb again. The reason to buy again is that it is a compelling value for
its growth.

*****************************

November 23, 2001
…..Sanford C. Bernstein's Strategic Value fund includes a lot of these
bargain-priced issues, which Bernstein calls "deep-value stocks." Washington
Mutual is one stock that Bernstein has favored this year. The nation's largest
thrift with offices in 42 states, Washington Mutual has traditionally been
strong in adjustable-rate mortgages. Those ARMs have recently lost share to
fixed-rate loans because long-term interest rates have been so low. As a
result, the share price is now undervalued relative to other financial
companies. Earnings could grow percent 13 annually over the next five years,
and the yield is 2.9 percent. At $33.10, the stock trades at nine times next
year's earnings.

****************************

Wednesday December 5, 2001
Forbes.com The Overachievers
By Lisa DiCarlo

….these five overachieving companies stood against the tide and didn't get
knocked over:

Washington Mutual

It's tough to get excited over a thrift bank that specializes in savings and
loans for middle-income people, but that's exactly what has driven the success
of Washington Mutual. The Seattle-based bank has more than doubled its assets
over five years to about $250 billion. Growth this year has come from
acquisitions, namely the mortgage businesses of Fleet Mortgage and PNC
Financial Services Group. Through the first nine months of this year,
Washington Mutual has already surpassed the earnings per share it recorded in
all of 2000. At an estimated $3.51 per share, 2001 earnings will be up 51%.
Growth will slow in 2002, with earnings expected to grow 10% to about $3.96 per
share. Still, Washington Mutual will continue to benefit from low interest
rates, which have already had a positive impact on net interest margin. While
other large companies cut or eliminated dividend payments this year, Washington
Mutual actually increased its dividend payment by a penny, to 24 cents a share.

************************************

Interview snippet with Chicago-based Harris Associates are value managers who
buy shares of a company only when it's trading at 60% or less than what they
think it's really worth…..its 28% annualized gain over the past five years tops
all mid-cap value funds and ranks third in the entire fund universe.

What are a couple of companies that stand out to you as solid bargains at
today's prices, and what's your rationale in each case?

First, I'd choose Washington Mutual. It's a $32 stock that we think should earn
about $4 a share next year. It's grown above 15% per year historically going
back over the last 15 years. Looking forward, we think it should continue to
grow at a faster rate than the S&P 500, something into the teens per year. It
pays a 3% yield right now, which is pretty competitive with short-term interest
rates.

If you compare it to leaders in other commodity businesses, where a company's
cost advantages is helping it build market share, then you see similarities
with a Wal-Mart. If I'm wrong, eight times next year's earnings is a fair price
anyway. If I'm right, you've got the potential of a doubling or a tripling of
the P/E multiple while earnings go up 10% to 15% per year. To get upside like
that with as little risk as this seems to look like an incredible opportunity.

The reason that we have the weighting we do in Washington Mutual is that we
believe that it is significantly undervalued and the range of potential values
of the company is quite predictable and quite narrow. We believe that the
management is the best in the industry, and they have most of their net worth
invested in the company.

Doug K-mart bonds: In stocks little guys like us can often do better than the
big boys because we're not doing size. In bonds, buying them right requires
size and knowhow. That said, I think Marty's right on this. If KM doesn't
chapter he gets a better than 20 ytm. If it does, they get to walk away from
700 leases on underperforming stores and that helps the rest survive. They'd
still be big enough to buy right...So they should reemerge. OTOH in bankruptcy,
the bond interest is at least delayed and often never paid (It's in a different
priority than the bond principle]. Personally, I'd rather buy Marty's fund than
the bonds. A fund can own enough to get a seat at the table. And Marty's a lot
better figuring which bonds, in terms of seniority, offer the best deal.

Regarding a stock that ISOPATCH suggested, EPEX, we are starting to see some

Buys and Sells.

I've been decreasing my cash and increasing REITs (HCP, PPS, BXP). This despite
REIT indexes approaching their 52 week highs. I'd rather take a 7% yield with
risk of capital loss than receiving 2% on cash. I'm concerned that many REITs
are forecasting flattish 2002 FFO over 2001... for example, Equity Residential
(EQR). However, I also think the markets don't seem to be putting enough of a
premium on yield. Approximately 1/3 of the S&P500 companies have dividend
yields in excess of cash. 27 S&P500 companies yield in excess of the 10 year
bond. I figure another year like the last two and the high dividend REITs
should get more attention from income-seekers.

I bought a starter position in Washington Mutual (WM). Both Bill Nygren and
Wally Weitz touted it in the 12/24 issue of Outstanding Investor Digest. It's
hard to believe a $29 billion thrift is a bargain, but I consider this less a
bargain than a cash alternative. I again passed on Wells Fargo (WFC). I looked
at it on 10/29/2001 when it was available below $40.

I'm looking at energy, but I haven't done anything. It seems likely that
another energy merchant will go bankrupt due to investor lack-of-confidence,
and that would seem to be a better entry point. Mirant does look interesting at
6.5x 2002 earnings.

I sold (tax-free) Dun and Bradstreet (DNB) after Buffett exited. I wasn't
tempted to sell before because earnings growth of 9% seemed plausible on a 2002
PE of 17. However, if WEB is willing to take a taxable gain, I better not tempt
the market gods to punish me for lack of humility. I had a 63% annualized
return since 5/2000.

I also sold tax-free Harte Hanks (HHS) at $28.52, bought last January at $22.
2001 earnings were 7% less than expected and I had a 29% annualized gain.

I sold tax-free Servicemaster (SVM) at $13.84, bought at $10.13 in July 2000.
Again, disappointing earnings in the face of 23% annualized gain. The CEO seems
to be making the right moves but the results have not followed.

Ditto for Newell Rubbermaid (NWL). Sold at $27.28, bought at $19 and $26.
Disappointing earnings results with annualized gains in the 20% range.

Sold the last of long-term taxable Pep Boys at $15.49, bought at $3.69 in
12/2000. 1/2003 eps of 77c is too lean for me.

Pared down my losing Kroger (KR) holdings (bought at $22-25) down to my only
profitable lot (bought at $14.50 in 2/2000). I have a full position in Safeway
(SWY). I feel I'm being contrarian enough taking the position that Safeway can
prosper despite the continued entry by Walmart and Target grocery hypermarts.

I may trade KMart (KM) but I haven't bought it since my $6 to $9.75 trade last
year.

re: FRT, BTH

I bought Federal Realty Trust ("FRT") and upon finding the CEO's compensation
(per Yahoo) to be $2.6m in 2000 promptly sold it.

I read the "Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett" last week. In it he
profiles a value investor whose name escapes me (his company is "Chieftain").
This guy focuses on very few names (like 7). Two of the seven per the last SEC
report were Blyth and Yankee Candle. I still have a small position in BTH and
will likely increase it when the price gets back to $20.

The book mentioned above also touts Joel Greenblatt's, "You Can Be a Stock
Market Genius". Without that credit, I can't imagine reading a book with that
title, but I am reading it. I find it also interesting.

Specifically:
o the insight provided by American Express spinning Lehman Brothers. As an
investment bank, Lehman Brothers has very uneven earnings. AXP traded higher
the day of the spinoff (i.e., DESPITE the spinoff) because the street so
penalized AXP for the unpredicability of Lehman's value/earnings contribution
prior to the spin. I feel ignorant but I did not know that level of
inefficiency existed.

o John Malone designed a complex spin of Liberty from TCI to discourage fellow
investors in TCI from opting for the spinoff so that he could maximize his
ownership of the spinoff. The insight for me is that insiders might design an
apparently ugly offering for their own benefit because they know the ugliness
is superficial.

Whitman contrasts TAVF approach with those in Greenwald's book. I found this
assertion interesting:
>>>>
Free cash flow from operations available for the security holder: Very few
companies ever actually achieve such free cash flows on a reasonably regular
basis. While for any individual project to make sense it has to return a cash
positive net profit over its life, this is not true for most companies (as
distinct from stand-alone projects), especially expanding companies. Most
businesses consume cash....Earnings: Most prosperous going concerns create
earnings, not free cash flows. Earnings exist where a company creates intrinsic
wealth from operations while consuming cash. Since most going concerns consume
cash, their earnings streams may be of limited value unless such flows are also
combined with access to capital markets, either credit markets or equity
markets or both.

First, let me say that I congratulate you on the performance of the stocks you
listed for us the other day. Good Job!!

Second, as to the cash flow post....I just flat out don't agree with it.

If a company is using revenues to buy other businesses or to increase their
capex to expand their own operations, that can be viewed as a discretionary use
of cash flows, and I add the excess expenditures back in, therefore cash flow
remains a true picture.

Investing cash flow for wealth enhancement is not the same as never having the
cash flow to start with.

Just my two cents.

Allen, I have attempted to learn as much about the Calpine situation as I can.
I have listened to the below Williams conference call a few times. The call is
about 2-hours in length.

Previously, I had listened to Calpine's update conference call on operations --
caused by the Enron concern -- and had thought the call went well and
management had credibility. Then I listened to the Williams call. There are a
few questions pertaining to what Calpine & industry does vs. what Williams does
-- and I decided Calpine had way to many risks for my tastes.

In my opinion, the Williams call is a must listen when assessing the Calpines,
Dynegys, etc. Especially since you indicated that this would be a "conservative
play".

I'm not convinced anybody at Third Avenue Value read Greenwald's book. 90% of

half of the first chapter you would know he is arguing against. To assert (as
TAV did in Barrons and in the letter) that Greenwald's valuation technique is
based on forecasting free cash flow is shamefully wrong. Greenwald himself
ridicules free cash flow forecasting - he makes no bones about it. I've read

I would be surprised if Calpine bought much power from Enron, since Calpine is
a net seller due to its huge amount of generation assets. But I agree ---
trades with Enron wouldn't take Calpine down. However, its huge debt and
exposure to power prices just might.

In other words, I'd still be somewhat cautious about Calpine --- power prices
are in the tank, and my impression is that Calpine may not have hedged enough
and may not be earning enough off of its plants to support its sizable debt
load and credit requirements.

Market Timing/Seasonality issues...

I just read an article where Jeffrey Hirsch whose company publishes the Stock
Traders Almanac. He makes a helluva case for only being invested 6 months of
the year !

"After crunching the numbers for years, the best 3 months of the year are
November,December & January. You have solid gains in april as well. Add in
Feburary & March and behold, you've got the best 6 months.

The hypothetical we run is if you took $10,000 and invested in,say, the dow,
from 1950 to 2000 from Nov 1 through April 30 versus May 1 though Oct 31, you
gained $415,890 during the best 6 months versus a punk $1,743 in May through
Oct. Thats compounded."

CDX, mentioned here several times over the past couple of years, looks only

CDX may be one of those stocks that goes nowhere for years, then abruptly gets
re-valued higher by the market. Mr. Whitman's CTO and ALCO seem to have been
like that.

As regards PNX, I'm leaning more to his FBL which has a little longer history
as public company, is profitable, and pays an increasing dividend. It's selling
close to book value now, so that's a caution though, imo.

Bought STT, VLO, PFG.

I don't consider any of these traditional value investments. I am swinging at
balls.

I have wanted State Street (STT) to be a core holding for me for several years,
but nobody gives it away (ditto for Coke). I'm stepping up again and paying a
high price for STT (mid $50s), i.e. a mid 20s PE with expected earnings growth
in low teens. I still don't own Coke. STT has delivered outstanding earnings
growth.

Bought Valero Energy at $40.XX. VLO is an S&P400 refiner. Last January I bought
Ultramar Diamond Shamrock and Tosco on a low PE/low book/supply-constraint
basis. These investments turned out great (64% and 40% annualized
respectively). VLO's valuation now might approach these. Trailing earnings are
around $8.56, forward earnings are expected around $5.39, book is around $33,
sales per share around $254. VLO has $1.3 billion in LTD. Moody's upgraded its
senior debt in December to baa2.

Bought Principal Financial (PFG) at $24.XX. I had a 401k through them and
admired their moat, service, etc. I looked at the IPO and thought I would wait
for a below book price. After reading this from this week's Barron's, I decided
to take a starter position:

>>>
Schafer: Principal Financial Group is the ninth largest life insurance company
in the U.S. It is based in Des Moines, Iowa, and came public in October 2001 at
18.50 a share. The company has an asset management subsidiary, a mortgage
banking subsidiary, and writes life and health insurance. This stock is now at
24. Principal is the largest provider of 401(k)s to small and medium-sized
businesses in the U.S. It's a terrific business, with high barriers to entry
and attractive returns. Most life insurance stocks sell for only 11 to 14 times
earnings since only about half to three-fourths of their GAAP [generally
accepted accounting principles] earnings are cash.
Principal's GAAP earnings, on the other hand, are approximately equal to its
statutory or cash earnings. When the market begins to appreciate this fact,
Principal will be accorded a higher multiple than other life insurance stocks.
The company has been targeting 11%-12% earnings growth over the next few years,
but they are being conservative. Once management begins to redeploy the
company's $1 billion-$1.5 billion, or $3-$4 a share in excess capital through
share repurchases, the growth rate will start to look like 13% to 14%. Since a
10% change in the S&P 500 impacts Principal's earnings per share by 4%, the
stock is a low-risk play on any recovery we may have in the stock market. I
estimate the company will earn $2.20 in '02 and $2.50 in '03. I can see the
stock at 35 to 40 in a year.

Q: Oscar, isn't the growth of 401(k)s a product of the bull market and the
general economic development of the 1990s? You act as if nothing has changed.
Schafer: Congress is going to start looking at 401(k)s and the amount of assets
put in the shares of any one company. But I don't think 401(k)s are a thing of
the past.
Cohen: A lot of the growth in 401(k)s is coming from the fact that companies
would rather their employees have defined contribution programs instead of
defined benefit programs. That is something that is likely to stay in place
because defined contribution programs are to the companies' best interest. They
don't have to worry about returns.

Good post. The only problem is a company that constantly needs to issue debt or
stock to stay in business is not a going concern. The Enrons and K-Marts are a
dime a dozen. Everyone is hap, hap, happy with the wonderful revenue and PE
right up until it's time to pay the bills. If a company is free cash flow
negative while reporting great earnings, it means they are depreciating their
costs at a much slower rate than those costs are incurred. Any company with a
debt to equity ratio over .5 to 1, and a low PE, is a time bomb waiting to
explode.

That doesn't mean those stocks won't go up. On any given day there are enough
of them trading at levels high enough to make YHOO at $250 look like a bargain.
If the SEC were to make one rule to cure Enron type reporting, it would be to
require companies to report free flow cash from operations at the bottom line.
At least it would give investors an easy way to see if a company is making
money or just reporting earnings. When a company has to leverage shareholder
equity to obtain operating cash, there is no shareholder value. The creditors
own the company.

I agree with the principal your supporting, but I think I am a bit more cynical
than you. If cash flow was the highly publicized number, then cash flow
accounting conventions would be more highly abused to make those numbers appear
to be better or "more acceptable"

I don't think there is any substitute for an individual investor/speculator
doing their own due diligence, because no matter how stringent the enforcement,
GAAP abuses will occur.

I would strongly support those actions whose intent and foreseeable outcomes
are the accurate and transparent, public recording of the financial pictures of
a company on a regular basis. This is what our 10Q and 10K filings are supposed
to achieve. I also strongly support heavy penalties for those in the accounting
profession who seriously violate these principals of accuracy and transparency,
because these are the principals that help free enterprise to work efficiently
and progressively. Without this openness and clarity our capitalistic system
here in America would be seriously jeopardized and that, to me, is a crime that
should have nasty penalties.

Just about every company out there pro formas the heck out of the numbers
anyhow. My view is that free flow cash from operations should be reported along
side GAAP EPS in the interest of full disclosure. There are plenty of sound
reasons to invest cash in a business, and if a company wants to add commentary
on why they used cash, I don't see any problem with that. The market needs some
kind of "apples to apples" numbers which apply equally to every company and
sector. I don't think it would be that hard to make one rule which is the same
for everyone, especially since cash is sure to be something every company keeps
track of anyhow.

Actually, I'm as cynical as you are. I don't think we'll ever see such a
requirement. No one wants to admit how few publicly held companies are capable
of producing profits in the form of cash.

KM lessons. Many. Although the lessons perhaps are not so general as to apply
to all value investors in all situations. More like the KM situation confirms
each person's own beliefs as to it having been a good opportunity or a bad
opportunity wisely passed over.

For me, reviewing reasons for buying and holding KM, I keep contemplating this
quote (author unknown), "Most people who think they are investing are
speculating. And most people who think they are speculating are gambling." I
need to make sure I better understand which camp I'm in, in each situation.

Since I maintain a large number of diversified but downtrodden stocks, I seem
to get a few every year that go BK. Painful experiences certainly, but not
utterly disastrous to the portfolio. The worst part for me is my diminished
morale and confidence, and the shame factor: "What? You were idiot enough to
buy and hold on to KM?? Obviously, Senior, any further investing ideas you
might have, have got to be discounted given that stock selection!"

Perhaps for each of us there's an inflection point where we realize, if we're
alert, that the stock might not be for us. That might be in visiting the
company or its stores, reading the financials, calculating the projected cash
flows, seeing the first analyst sell rating, seeing the stock drop to new lows
or seeing a breakdown in a chart pattern. I've had stocks recover from all that
though, so I don't see one or more of these factors as a sufficient condition
for avoiding or selling the stock.

What I want to be more alert to - based on Enron and KM - is the breakdown in
communications from top management. An Enron 'signal' may have occurred when
the media reported an analyst was cursed at by the CFO (?) during a conference
call (for asking for an updated balance sheet). Reminds me of Al Dunlop's
behavior before Sunbeam collapsed. For KM, an important 'signal' I might have
given more weight to was management's total silence after one analyst's
suggesting KM might go bankrupt - and mangement's STILL maintaining their
silence even after the media mentioned their curious failure to issue any
announcements/clarifications/updates/etc.

Kmart was fundamentally noncompetitive in its core business and had a poor
balance sheet. Those facts were well known. If their 3Q conference call is
still available on their website I would recommend it as a case study of an
optimistic turnaround story that just didn't make any sense. I met with
management once about three years ago and caught them playing accounting games
with the numbers they were showing investors about the success of their
turnaround. That made me skeptical, but the fact that I just hate shopping
there was another data point. They are just terrible at what they do. I looked
at it many times but the only reason I would invest in it would have been the
real estate portfolio which was never enough given the debt. Maybe I could have
made money shorting it, but my process is just to avoid these situations.

I'm looking at another company now that is hated by analysts but is #1 in what
they do by far in terms of customer satisfaction. That is the kind of
situtation I want to be in.

Cash flow from operations IS reported. Many companies put it in their earnings
release. The ones that don't you have to ask why, but its right there in the
10-Q. This number to me is FAR more important than EPS. If you're a no-growth
retailer and you don't produce free cash flow, its only a matter of time if you
have debt.

KM and Enron might be a positive thing if you believe as I do that a lot of
valuations need to bleed hard before this market is a buy (and of course as
long as you didn't own them). Complacent investors need to be scared, and now
that "too big to fail" is being challenged as a risk strategy, we may see some
long overdue fear. Kmart wasn't the last bankruptcy we're going to see of a
large brand name company.

Basically, I'm not real confident that SOFN will be able to exploit its loss

<<lessons to be learned from the kmart bankruptcy? seems like enron to have
snowballed very quickly from a bad quarter to bankruptcy.>>Look for ratings
triggers &/or a debt or operating structure that is highly exposed or
vulnerable to a minor change in conditions. Kmart had exposure to surety bond
market and supplier confidence.
This article discusses these risks:
http://www.standardandpoors.com/Forum/MarketAnalysis/Enron/Articles/121301_clif

Look for all ratings agencies to focus more attention on ratings triggers
hidden in credit terms so they don't face criticism from having gone from
investment grade to near default in the blink of an eye.
BTW: Bankruptcy will help Kmart buy time but I'd rate it's ultimate survival
doubtful. Basically bankrupty works best when a sound business model is
encumbered with too much debt. With Kmart, the problem IS the business model.
Squeezed between low cost producer Walmart and more upscale Target &

Keith,

My comments were directed towards "my ability" to understand WMB, ENE, DYN,
CPN. I'm not the brightest neighbor on the block.

I listened to the WMB call a few times and do not understand the specific risk
issues. Many people -- maybe the majority of investors for all of what I know

"Could you briefly summarize those risks here?"

Hi Bob,

Sorry, I can't. :)

Not that I don't want to, it's just that the industry has a few to many
unanswered issues for me. In other words, I can't sleep at night owning CPN or
DYN.

I understand the terminology, the description, and the goals of the business
model. What I do not understand -- and can not be assured of in my dd -- is
what risks the company is taking in a speculative vs. hedging strategy -- on a
day-to-day basis.

I can say that I have attempted to fully understand the industry and have
previously owned AES, DYN, CPN, ENE, WMB. Ignorance is bliss. If I had to
choose to own one now based upon my understanding, then it would definately be
WMB.

Regarding your question, there were so many separate issues that I wouldn't
know where to begin. If you listen to the WMB conference call, then I can refer
to a specific issue that was addressed in the call. If you haven't listened to
the 159-minute call, I really recommend it.

The business model has specific issues that I do not completely understand. The
conference call explained all of the issues in a very informative way.

Madharry: I definitely agree that there's currently minimal disclosure and I'd
reather get beaten with a hose that scour bond indetures looking for them...The
purpose of my comment was to raise awareness and sensitivity to the potential
for cascade-like death spiral situations and point to what some of these traps
might look like. If a company has minimal net debt [debt-cash] or better yet
plenty of cash and doesn't have a cash sucking sink hole potential then there's
little risk. But if there's a big chunk of debt and operating leverage, then
thinking about the possibility of it turning into a black hole might help avoid
same. Might also help distinquish between oversold value plays where regression
to the mean is likely and spiral into oblivion situations.
Also, while disclosure of these situations as been minimal, the ratings
agencies are much more sensitised and there will be more revelations of such
potential down the road. It probably won't be fun to own something the day a
report comes out about a potential credit cliff situation.

CPN and MIR vs. DYN

You need deep pockets to operate in the energy biz. Without a good credit
rating, you will have to do things like prepay and put up security bonds for
all your hedging activities, which will result in cash drains and carrying
costs that will eventually run you out of business.

Word on the street is that Calpine is short on credit capacity and may have to
quickly unload assets or go bankrupt because it can't handle its credit
problems. Dynegy is obviously a much better capitalized player and thus would
not be as exposed to credit problems.

Hope that helps.

I think MIR, RRI, and NRG are in somewhat a similar spot to CPN (but haven't

affiliated with the utilities Southern Company, Reliant Energy, and Xcel
energy, respectively. I don't think these utilities would let their spin-offs
go down the tubes. However, if CPN blows up, I would guess that these companies
would fall in sympathy.

Also, I do know that NRG is hiring like mad right now.

I keep coming across AMT and CCI and maybe another couple of these tower
companies. Compared to where these stocks have been in the past (and dangerous
comparisons they are), these stocks are selling now below stated book value and
at "relative" low p/sales. Could be plusses for me. But I just focus on the
continual negative EBITDA, negative earnings, increasing debt, and I wonder if
there's a real business in there. Even if there is a business model there that
works, I suspect for me I'll keep passing on these stocks, just as I missed
cable companies and the gains that patient cable-company stock holders
eventually saw (through their years of negative earnings numbers). Perhaps for
these tower companies, one really has to have a knowledge of the technology and
its benefits and how they outweigh satellite or wire transmission competitors.
I have no such knowledge, and so no confidence in the business.

And I don't have technology expertise either with CWP. But here I'll bet the
good balance sheet provides a lot of business options for management.

PCS' business seems to be spinning out of control. I don't know if their
increased revenues/profits of this past quarter will meet revised expectations,
but it appears that they are unable to service their existing base and future
growth will be driven by reputation in a very competitive environment.

Their customer "service" is amongst the worst of a bad lot:

Yup 4 major companies: AMT CCI SBAC SITE. There's BIGT but it's going to be

It may come down to 2 major players and leave the rest out or buy them out. The
business model is pretty simple but requires major capital. Buy/lease land,
build towers, put carrier's equipments on towers, charge carriers for leasing
space and installation and technical support. Most wireless carriers lease
towers from one of these major players.

The drawback is growth in subscribers and expansion to other markets. Market is
jittery about liquidity and economy and that's why they've dumping last 3

MIR is in the same boat than CALP but has a much stronger balance sheet. With
the last secondary, MIR took in 759M$ in equity (rather than CALP 1.0B$ in LTn
debt).
As of Sept. 30, 2001, MIR has 5.7B$ (CPN 9.3B$) in debt outstanding and 1.49B$
(CPN 0.47B$)in cash and 4.8B$ in equity(CPN 2.8B$). Furthermore, MIR will take
in 700M$ in cash from the sale of a German subsidy (Bewag), and its expansion
program is much less aggressive than CPN.

I continue to believe that due to MIR moderate leverage, the company is in a
better position than may of its peers.

Regarding..."...- AOL @ $28 is definitely in the value category..." and
"...they really are raking in a lot of cash that's masked by their huge
goodwill writeoffs..."

AOL's free cash flow (which accounts for stock buybacks, acquisitions, etc) is
only $.557/share through the last nine months. This amount, annualized, would
be $.743/share. 74 cents on a 28 dollar investment would represent a 2.7% yield
on my investing dollar.

If I invest in the market, I want a much higher rate of return than I can get
with a "risk free" investment. I want to be compensated for the risk I am
assuming. Part of my definition of value is a return that justifies the risk.

I'll grant you that there might be some element of a margin of safety in the
fact that AOL is selling below its book value, but there is nothing to say to
me, that it won't be selling even lower against book in the future. I usually
look to the real cash flow for my safety as well as discount to book. AOL
doesn't make the grade yet.

This is not to say that those who invest in it at these levels won't make
money, possibly even a lot of it. Just that I can't justify investing in it as
a value play yet.
