I hear ya Paul. I don't own MRK, haven't in many years. I have 2% of my
portfolio in Pimco Global Healthcare, and no individual health care stocks.
the problem with MRK, (and PFE) is that they are so over-owned that when the
big guys start dumping (as they have/are doing, then there is no ways that
supply can be absorbed.
The news keep getting worser and worserer. a 5% dividend is great except when
the stock keeps going down 10%. At some point, MRK may well be a buy, but not
yet for me. it's doing a CD, TYC, etc swan dive right now. and the liability

I sold some Nov 20 puts after my Octobers expired (fortunately the stock closed
a couple pennies out of the money), but those are underwater now after the
recent drop. I may have to roll them or take the stock in a couple weeks,
though it could also easily regain the 20 level. I also bought a few shares
under 18 last week, and even got a .25 dividend already for a little pizza
money (though the stock is in my IRA so that would be a pizza many years from
now -G-).

Overall I think NYB may have trouble moving significantly higher in the short
run after they withdrew their guidance for 2005, but with a book value around
12 bucks, reasonably good earnings even with the recent strategy adjustments,
and a 1.00 a share dividend which they have repeatedly stated they will
maintain, the stock should be able to at least hold in the general area of 20,
making it a good put play and trading vehicle.

I think the stock will also gain at least modest support from the idea that
they are always a possible takeover target. They had looked for a buyer early
this year but never found a deal they liked, but with their foothold in NY,
they would be attractive to many potential suitors.

re. C. For someone who has no shares but is interested in acquiring a position,
current price is okay to begin lagging in. Imo. And C ought to be considered
for inclusion in many people's portfolio(s). It's a growth stock and at current
price, also a value stock. A forward p/e of 10 for a global giant with good roe
and good profit margins, increasing book value, and increasing dividend.

For those like me who already have shares, we could wait and chance again
seeing mid 43 before adding more. (I've added some at that level.) C's traded
below 40 at some time in '00, '01, '02, and '03, so maybe in near future we
might again get another shot at adding below 40. I figure I'll add a few more
shares next in maybe 40-41 range if we we do drop there again.

Paul do you think C is too big to fail? Can you think of any litigation or
negative announcements that may provide a buying opportunity? I like this
sector in general and any well diversified portfolio should contain one or more
banking stocks.

One of my best investments many years ago(early 80's)was BofA at $5. This was
during a period when the industry was having problems and BofA had some company
specific problems management needed to resolve. They even allowed shareholders
to buy stock each month at a 5% discount to the market during their 18 month
restructuring.

Can you think of any reason a Kerry victory might be negative for the banking
industry (possible new legislation) in the next four years? Also, do you think
Spitzer is finished with his probing into this bank?

I think the market is discounting something and I am waiting for some market
over reaction. Perhaps it's just due to the interest rate cycle and possible
uncertainty of the election.

re NYB - the 12$ book value is mostly goodwill. Tangible book is only 4.24$. 4x
+ tangible book is not cheap for a bank stock. trying another metric, NYB
trades at 2x the core deposits, which also is anything but cheap. I think NYB

while it's true that the tangible book is quite a bit lower, there is
significant value in the foothold and customer base NYB has in new york, and
the likelihood that if they fail to execute for very long, they will probably
be bought out, in which case that value would be realized...certainly whether
this makes up the difference is debatable, but IMHO there is sufficient
downside protection given the various factors that i cited

i owned SOV (formerly SVRN) for many years, but the management has made it
clear that they aren't interested in a buyout, so with the negligible options
premiums and meager dividend, there isn't much advantage to playing it at this
point...as far as a bank stock to just hold, i'd rather find one that is
undervalued compared to its earnings and growth rate and/or has a decent
likelihood of being bought out, and of course it's nice to earn a solid
dividend in the meantime

again JMHO, that's why it's a market of stocks :)

Your link to James Clarke's message brings back a bit of nostalgia. I made
investments in MAXS, LKI, EBSC, FIT and BL and made enormous returns on every
one with the exception of LKI which I continue to hold because it remains so
bargain priced. I anticipate one day, despite the long holding period, I will
achieve a sizable economic return on that investment too.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=12907591

BL has been an exceptional hold and I remain confident holding because of its
strong balance sheet and steadily improving business operations. Recently an
investment group purchased 5%+ interest in the company with the stated
intention of consulting management about increasing shareholder value. BL was a
Ben Graham spectacular. I believe my before tax return on that hold since
December, 1999 is around 49% per annum all awhile enjoying minimal downside
exposure because of the balance sheet safety net and dividend.

It has been a long time since we have uncovered profitable net nets with simple
easy to understand businesses like the companies listed above, the SCNYAs,
PBSCs or BAMMs or General Cigar Holdings, ISDNs, FRDs, JOBs, etc. I am not sure
where to look anymore, or if they have all dried up.

I am also holding FIT (I purchased FIT a second time after they sometime after
they announced their liquidation plan around the time when the stock price
plummeted after management announced its intent to purchase the company for
nearly half the price that the company was trading at). A recent release stated
that the company was out of nasdaq compliance and may be unlisted. I probably
should sell it as the company trades at about net current assets. After the
liquidation payouts I have about a zero basis in the company.

Some recent thoughts rattling around in my noggin lately:

"Well, for a lot of mistakes you've made - and will continue to make? - you're
still doing pretty darn good. It's kinda like a batting average."

"Ya know, numbskull, if you'd just do the OPPOSITE of what your emotions tell
you to do, you'd be a lot better off. Buy more when you get scared and want to
sell. Sell when you think you should add cause you think you're such a genius

nothing to me, it will trade down accordingly. As a talking head said on CNBC

see anything better to do with the money. With MLS, I thought I caught a pretty
good spike when the stock was up $1.50. Unfortunately, it went up another buck

Investment returns are down: Now what ?
Financial advisers say we have to increase our savings for retirement. Some
firms are helping workers to do it.
By Todd Mason
Inquirer Staff Writer

Sam Scuderi had modest expectations for his stock portfolio as he began
preparing for retirement three years ago, in the depths of the bear market.

"You get to thinking that if you can get 8 percent to 10 percent a year again,
it's a great number," he said.

Retirement savers, once wildly optimistic about the stock market, are swinging
to the opposite extreme, researchers and financial advisers say. But most
aren't acting on their new caution by saving more.

In a recent survey by Vanguard Group, most retirement savers said they expect
stocks to generate modest average annual returns of 8 percent over the next
decade.

In previous surveys, investors expected double-digit investment returns. A few
haven't gotten the message. "There is a small group of people who still believe
it is going to be 15 percent," said Stephen Utkus, director of the Vanguard
Center for Retirement Research.

Retirement savers are painfully aware of this lower return after reading their
account statements. As of June 30, the typical saver at Vanguard eked out a
five-year average annual return of 2.7 percent, according to a recent study by
the Malvern fund family.

Reasonable investment expectations are making life easier for financial
planners like Patti Brennan of Westtown, who advises Scuderi and his wife,
Carmel.

Back in the bull market, she recalled, clients were put off when she assumed
their investments would earn an average of 8 percent a year.

"Now they are looking at the same data and asking 'Where are we going to get 8
percent?' " she said.

The law of averages smooths out returns over periods of 20 years or 30 years,
Brennan said, meaning that low returns in recent years are offsetting the big
returns of the 1990s.

Scuderi, 61, of Willistown, who retired this year, said he worries less about
his investments. "You always have a concern. You don't ever think you have
enough money," he said.

White-collar workers tend to be in good shape for retirement, according to a
study last year by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. But many other
workers are not.

"You get huge, huge numbers, particularly older single women, who don't have a
prayer in the world of saving enough money," said Jack VanDerhei, an author,
Temple University professor, and retirement savings expert.

Overall, the institute's study forecast that, in the decade of the 2020s,
retirees will fall about $400 billion short of meeting their basic needs plus
major health-care outlays, such as nursing-home stays.

According to the institute, the average 401(k) account balance held by workers
in their 60s was $127,130 in 2003, down from $139,317 in 1999. But that's not
true for many Americans, because 43.3 percent of workers in 2002 had no
retirement plan at all.

It is one thing for savers to lower their expectations, said Utkus, the
Vanguard retirement researcher. "Part 2 is what you are going to do about it,"
he said. "In a world in which returns are going to be less exuberant than they
have been, the answer is to put more money away."

That is not happening in retirement plans managed by Vanguard, Utkus said. The
typical saver's contribution level of 6 percent of pay hasn't changed in four
years, he said.

Employers are searching for ways to encourage workers to save more. Electronics
Boutique Holdings Corp., of West Chester, for example, asked workers to agree
to an automatic annual increase in contribution rates to their 401(k) plan.

The computer-games retailer offers a generous plan, matching 75 percent of the
first 6 percent of employees' contributions. The plan is popular, but
participants "are staying at 6 percent," benefits director Debra Maher said.

But when the company asked them to bump contribution rates by a percentage
point a year to a maximum of 10 percent, "a lot of people signed up for it,"
Maher said.

Workers spend little time thinking about retirement, said Jim Hageney, a
principal at Sterling Investment Advisors Ltd., the Berwyn manager of
Electronics Boutique's plan.

Participants "will make their choices, and they'll never make another change,"
he said.

A new crop of autopilot 401(k) plans hope to solve this problem by enrolling
new employees in appropriate investments by default, and stepping up their
contributions each year, unless workers object.

T. Rowe Price Group Inc. has incorporated automatic annual increases in plans
for 13 clients, vice president John Doyle said, but employees must agree to the
arrangement.

VanDerhei, the Temple professor, said the autopilot 401(k) plans could make a
difference eventually. "I've only seen limited results so far," he said.

with Far East Energy (FEEQ on the OTCBB).

Its curious how you chose this board to post this; from where I sit this stock
is about as far as you can possibly get from being a "value" investment, at
least in the classic Graham sense.

Good luck with it, I may look at it but I will probably pass on it.

It sounds interesting- but I wonder why you omitted the fact that they just did
a private placement and sold some 900,000 units for can$.80 which included a
share and a warrant on October 18th . Now its less than a month later and we
should be rushing to buy this at can$1.70?. Since you omitted this it makes me
wonder what else you have omitted. Perhaps this will do great but most people
who are active on this thread look for slightly more established companies. I
think we have all seen lots of great concepts that have turned out to be
vehicles for management getting rich, investment bankers making out ok and
investors/speculators becoming bag holders.
Right now I dont see why I should pay more that $can .80 for it. After all I'm
not even getting a warrant out of it.

Madharry, not sure if you missed the most recent unit sale on Nov. 1 2004 that
SME has entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent with Haywood Securities to
sell 1,920,500 units at at a price of $1.25 with warrants. I did not go into
all the details but you get the idea of what is going on. Haywood gets 8% of
the gross sales, plus the purchase of agents warrants, etc.

Also the company will try a non-brokered sale of 800 units themselves.

Most often one has to be very nimble "with story stocks".

The problem with these small companies is that even if they start with a small
number of shares, it does not take long to have major dilution selling share
for around US$1.00. They burn through the money and management is usually
unloading shares they get for nothing by the bushel load. Also it usually is
years before successful drilling, if any, takes place and then the
infrastructure to transport the gas must be built. I speak from experience and
am currently sitting on a couple micro E&Ps and a couple Biotechs that are very
similar in nature. That is not to say that there will not be some spectacular
plays but usually they take so long that one gives up after two to three years
just before the price explosion. Or after sitting on it for so long one is
happy to get their money back or a quick profit. The stories are great but not
for a value investing thread.

I was not omitting anything. It is all on their website. All start-ups go
through initial private placements to raise capital to begin operations. The
reason private placements are discounted to market price is that the shares are
restricted for some period of time. Thus they are not freely tradable. Perhaps
that is your point. These restricted shares are sometime referred to as Rule
144 shares. That's a whole different story...

For example I just participated in the most recent Storm Cat private placement
at $ 1.25 CDN. Why would I do that when last private placement you pointed was
done at $ .80 CDN? I paid 56% more. I've even bought shares in the open market
as high as $ 1.65 CDN. Why? There is twenty reasons. One they hired Evergreen
veteran Zimmerman, two they tied up Mongolia property which has a VALUE in
excess of market cap toady, three can't find cheaper CBM company, etc. etc.

It is a ever changing situation. Today they announced they purchased production
in the best area of the country the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. It is less
risk today than yesterday. Plus I know it costs $ 75,000 to $ 125,000 per hole
to drill in the Powder River Basin. His acquisition price was a fraction of
this (28 production holes X $ 75,000 = $ 2.1 million minimum).

Stock was up 21 % today.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SME.V

Why? Zimmerman is doing exactly what I said he would. Beginning strategy is to
buy production (revenues) and improve on that prodution and its reserves (His
strategy). Zimmerman has the expertise to do this. Read his quote. Why would a
person come from a $ 2.1 BILLION company (the acquisition price) such as
Evergreen to a $ 20 million start-up?

Read real close Zimmerman's quote below:

STORM CAT ENERGY ACQUIRES NATURAL GAS FROM COAL PRODUCTION IN
POWDER RIVER BASIN, WYOMING

TSX-V: SME Nov 15, 2004

November 15, 2004 - Storm Cat Energy Corporation (SME-TSX.V) (the "Company") is
pleased to announce it has acquired 100 % working interest (81.5% net), in
1,481 acres of the Jamison/North Twenty Mile fields, located in Campbell
County, Wyoming, USA. Geologically, these fields are located on the eastern
flank of the Powder River Basin coalbed natural gas region.

Originally placed in production in early 2002, these fields are currently
producing at a rate of approximately 1.0 million cubic feet per day (Mmcfd) of
natural gas from 28 producing wells. The current production derives from the
Anderson and Canyon coal seams with gross and net proven reserves of
1.148/0.842 billion cubic feet (Bcf) respectively and gross and net probable
reserves of 3.231/2.370 Bcf respectively. The reserve estimates were provided
by Sproule Associates in Denver, Colorado.

In consideration of the acquisition, the Company has paid $1.25 million US for
the properties. The effective date of the transaction is December 1, 2004.

A total of six coal seams exist in the area, including the Anderson and Canyon.
The company believes two of the lower coal seams, the Cook and the Wall provide
sufficient thickness to warrant testing and development through the drilling of
new wells. In addition, the Company feels the Smith coal seam is a good
candidate for recompletion of certain existing wells but no reserves were
attributed to it in the Sproule analysis.

Company President, Scott Zimmerman said: "The acquisition of natural gas
production with potential developmental drilling in a renowned coalbed natural
gas region of the United States is a fundamental step in Storm Cat establishing
itself as a company focused on the acquisition, exploration and expansion of
significant natural gas deposits worldwide."

Storm Cat Energy Corp. is a growing exploration company focusing on developing
unconventional natural gas reserves globally. The company's primary objective
is to create value for it's shareholders by applying strong technical expertise
to strategies that will unlock substantial natural gas resources in areas where
production can be achieved quickly and efficiently.

Storm Cat was up 21 % today. Since this is the Value thread I have a Warren
Buffet story below that relates to this stock and the person who first selected
it. Hey I love Graham Net-Net stocks!! Bring back July 2002 where I had a pool
of over 600 of them to pick from.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SME.V

As I mentioned in other post I just participated in that private offering.
Shares are restricted. No intention of selling. Zimmerman is building a real
company. Zimmerman has a 22 year track record Not sure why I would want to sell
this. You do enormous due diligence on an individual who is going to build a
major CBM company. Zimmerman bought production today per news release. The risk
is reduced, will not know to what extent for a while. There was also a news
story in Petroleum News on Sunday that they were successful in bid for some
Alaska property. Great Story. No need to post.

Here take a look at this Wyoming E & P company--why would you sell this out
early? I know people who did.:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=UPL&t=5y

A friend said it best about Storm Cat--better than I did I believe:

"To keep it simple: They have the property; they now have the management talent
to attract more talent; and they have access to money. It will take time for
them to execute and that is always a risk but I like the odds of only 1 risk
(execution) rather than 4 (property, talent, money, execution)."

Since this is the Value thread it is appropriate that I end with what Warren
Buffett advised his neighbor and the person who recommended Storm Cat Mike
Schaefer:

"Mike was a good friend with Warren's son, Howie, and spent a lot of time at
the Buffett house.

Through osmosis and a hunger to learn more about the financial markets, Mike
learned everything he could from Warren Buffett.

The wisest advice Buffett gave to Mike was "to pick a specific part of the
financial market, and study it until you know more about it than 90% of other
investors. When you do that, you can't help but be successful."

That's when Mike decided to enroll in the Colorado School of Mines, and learned
everything he could about the business of precious metal and oil and gas
exploration.

In the early 1980s, Mike moved to Wyoming, where a boom in coalbed methane
exploration was taking place. " End

Lot to cogitate about regarding MLS and its discussion here.

Discussion started maybe late '98. If I remember correctly, Jim Clarke liked
Chelsea (CPG), and my preference was MLS. The stocks really didn't do that well
for quite a while. Meanwhile though, the dividend yield was somewhere between 9
and 11% depending on when you bought (MLS). I looked at CPG several times over
the years, and there never seemed to be a time when CPG was not the better
performer. Chelsea was always the better pick and performer, if I recall.

So I could've switched from MLS to CPG at any time and done better. More
importantly, to my way of looking at stocks - I like to diversify, diversify -
rather than pick one over the other, I could have and should have bought both.
Which I've done with stocks in many subsectors, and so this practice is
consistent with my operating style. But I wrongly failed to do this here.

When a stock does rise after a long basing period, there's nothing like getting
in and going for the ride. Although for me, I never can figure when that time
is. With MLS, if there was a catalyst, I never saw it.

Wallace Rivers captured a lot of the gain, 41-58 in six months, whereas those
who bought (and held) from late '98 saw a rise from under 20 to 60 in about six
years. The dividend's been increased slightly too I note, so the yield on
original purchases of the '98 period is over 11% now. Timing is everything they
say, and this situation doesn't contradict that. Anytime one can get 17 points
on a 41 dollar stock in 1/2 year, that is a good time (assuming we're not in a
superinflationary period). On the other hand, it doesn't negate the positive
situation of tripling one's money over six years, and the addition of receiving
a good dividend yield in each of those six years. So the lesson for me is that
you had to get in the thing - or listen to Jim Clarke about his CPG or other
choices -g- - and you had to hold on six months or six years. And, imo, you had
to overcome the sneer factor of REITs - yeah they're basically dividend payers,
they can be risky (1974-5 debacle?), and since they're not real capital growers
(how can they be when they have to pay out 90% of their money?), so of course
you'll not get much capital gain out of them. (I'm still surprised how they've
performed.) For me, it's about having a propensity to diversify, diversify.
It's a lot easier getting into such a stock and holding on to it - if only for
the 10% dividend - if the stock is not a huge component of one's portfolio such
that one constantly watches over it and frets over it or is bored with it or is
tempted into taking gains and trying something else with the proceeds.

In the same vein, we could have a similar discussion about LHO, a non-dividend
real estate stock Jim Clarke and I both liked back in those same days. Stocks
bought properly - or maybe only somewhat right - where management is given
enough time to bring results to the bottom line - or the market perception
changes ---just a few of those stocks can add value to a portfolio and provide
some balance to otherwise risky or concentrated holdings.

Jmo here, and the fact that some of these stocks are now at five year highs
doesn't really justify my argument, but it sure makes it easier for me to speak
my opinion with some conviction - wrong though I might be -g-.

regarding: "BTW there is only about 20 net-nets now. There are other places on

If you can provide any further info. here, I'd be interested.
-----------
There are several ways to look at net-nets.

I believe - but I cannot verify this - that Dr. Graham's net-nets would all be
of profitable companies. The examples in Intelligent Investor were all of
profitable companies. But this was not explicitly stated as a requirement.

The Jim Clarke approach where the underlying business of the net-net is
evaluated. (including but not limited to profitablity) This may be your method
as well. It's a further screen after the net-net screen.

The, ahem, Paul Senior approach. Just give me a list of net-nets and I'll pick
a mostly random sample. (I learned from SINA that I don't judge very well. I
dismissed that net-net and it subsequently went up - without me - maybe 50x).
I'd be looking to buy roughly 2/3 of net-net price. Violating my preference for
not judging and violating my preference for 2/3 -- because I can't find any
that I don't already own that are like that - I've been slowly accumulating
FAVS, where I estimate net-net for this unprofitable cigar butt to be $4.5/sh.
vs. stock price of $3.65

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=FAVS

All the net-nets I've bought have eventually worked out. Although some took a
LOT longer to move up than I had patience to hold on for. Also, if one
calculates the time value of money on some of my net-nets, then although they
may have moved up above my buy price, some really haven't been "profitable"
because I had to hold them so long.

I'm holding about five below-cash plays now. None has done well this year, and
the managements of several have further frittered away cash which has reduced
my margin of safety.

(Black matrix) but with most of the new TV technologies (Projection TV, Plasma,

Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement

Effective November 15, 2004, the registrant entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Snow King Interests LLC
("SKI"), an entity controlled by Manuel B. Lopez and James M. Peck, two
officers
and directors of the registrant, have agreed to pay $0.32 per share, in cash,
for each share of common stock of the registrant not currently owned by Messrs.
Lopez or Peck or their affiliates and the registrant will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of SKI. Consummation of the transaction is subject to various
conditions, including, among other things, the approval by the registrant's
stockholders and the obtaining of various regulatory approvals. If the
transaction fails to close because of SKI's inability to obtain financing, the
registrant will be entitled to debt forgiveness in the amount of approximately
$100,000. The transaction is expected to be consummated early in the first
quarter of calendar 2005 and the merger agreement provides that the transaction
must be completed by March 31, 2005. If the registrant obtains a superior
proposal, its Board of Directors may accept such proposal although the
registrant must pay a $50,000 break-up fee.

Messrs. Lopez and Peck and their affiliates own beneficially 5,438,212
shares, or approximately 54%, of the registrant's issued and outstanding voting
common stock. Messrs. Lopez and Peck and their affiliates have agreed to vote

I see FJC's near lows. I'll take a few shares. I am guessing that he might've

(imo) since you mentioned it here, schzammm. I see a couple of stocks in the
sector are up sharply today. (Not CGLa though, which was also mentioned here
last month.)

I don't see the d/e ratio as high now on Yahoo GKIS stats as I said it was.
Still high, but not a killer reason for avoiding the stock, imo. If the the
sector is going to do well because the egg/chicken business is going along okay
(for now anyway; it's cyclical we know), then GKIS might be worth a buy still.

I don't like switching buy opinions from negative to positive after a stock's
moved up, because I'm not one who believes a price rise itself means that the
market consensus is now positive or aligned or safer, or that the market is
right. So I hope I'm not letting today's action in the sector influence me too
much.

Paul, I believe we were looking at GKIS at the same time. Interesting you
mention GKIS today, as I sold my position yesterday. I felt that from the IPO
price that there was low risk and a high probability of making 20% over the
next 3-6 months(for reasons we discussed earlier). It just happened sooner.
Value investing is only one of several methods I use to make stock selections.
However, IMHO asset management is the most important thread that runs through
all methods and preferences of stock selection. Stock can go higher as today
confirmed but I find I do best when I execute the game plan.

MF seems to have a interest in chickens:

Is it a race between falling grain and falling chicken prices in the short
term?

Just for informational purposes, I used the proceeds to buy PFE and FRX
yesterday. Huge volume and new low in FRX today, not good.

Brinks thank you very much. I appreciate your due dilligence and bringing this
stock to our attention- I think now that the tone of my initial response was
unduly harsh and critical and I apologize. Although it may not be my cup of tea
it certainly could turn out to be a highly successful investment. I certainly
havent done as much homework as you either on the individual or the industry.
net nets i can understand a lot better!

Understood. I take Warren Buffett's comment to newsletter writer Michael
Schaefer very seriously:

The wisest advice Buffett gave to Mike was "to pick a specific part of the
financial market, and study it until you know more about it than 90% of other
investors. When you do that, you can't help but be successful." END

In case anyone is wondering about the little stock I posted here last week it
has had two news announcement and is up some
35%. Still very early days.

Coalbed methane is this country's future for natural gas. Here you had a CEO
with 20+ years of experience with a $ 2.1 BILLION company that had a annual $
200 million drilling budget start a new company with $ 20 million market cap.
Difficult to go wrong. Plus he acquired production per news release on Monday
so he has revenues. Risk reduced further. Never a dry hole with coalbed
methane!! Therefore little risk. Know more about it than 90% of other
investors!

I'll add a tiny amount to an exploratory position in TJX.

Stock hasn't done much in past couple years although trend over years seems to
be up:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=TJX&t=5y

Some things I like about TJX:

High return on assets since '97

10% 5-year annual avg. sales increase

$3.1B TJX stock (236M sh) retired since '97

Company is "confident in our ability to continue to provide value to our
shareholders through both dividend payments and the share repurchase program".
(from '03 annual)

Capital Research and Management, and Ruane, Cunniff are top institutional
holders. Sequoia Fund and Oakmark Equity and Income are mutual funds with
positions (per Yahoo). So the boys of Graham Doddsville lend some credence.
------------------

I suspect company will continue do okay - get its share of the markets it's in.
It appears to me that investors may have to be somewhat patient (18-24 months,
maybe much longer) to capture any significant gains from this dull stock
though. Jmo.

re AMAT - sold 1/2 of my AMAT position with a small gain (10%). Numbers weren't
good and I am surprised how well the stock recovered today. Overall my strategy
is to sell some positions here and there in my IRA account to raise some more
cash.

Brinks, great memo and net-net list.

Interesting point in the Tweedy, Browne study that those companies operating at
a loss actually resulted higher returns than profitable ones. I had been buying
when companies were still at a loss but a smaller loss sequentially, because
once they break even, the prices usually already doubled. When ALVR was below
$2, several friends did not buy it because of the loss, however when ALVR broke
even, the price was already at $8.

The main reason those stocks are selling below net liquidation values was the
loss and fear of bankruptcy, once investors think the company can survive, the
price is likely doubled from the bottom.
