Pharma's up strongly (so far) today, it seems to me. I'll follow you and sell
some SNY now too. Also some ABT.

CAH, I can't figure. It's a buy based on reversion-to-mean of historical p/e
and psr. I just don't see why, given its usual historically mediocre roe, it's
ever sold at such higher p/e's and psr's in the past. Also, it seems d/e is up
too. If I recall right, positives for CAH are the key guy who started the
company (Bob Walter) and that they are also in several aspects of health care,
not just drug distribution. Drug distribution is where CAH is larger than ABC
or MCK, but profits have been squeezed there over past few years, I believe.
And there's apparently not that many new drugs forthcoming from pharma
manufacturers.

CAH might be a buy; I'll consider. Not the same opportunity now though as when
price dropped sharply in '04 and you and I discussed it here.

Sold KBH and ITB - consolidated into MDC. It seems that MDC is the most solid
builder so far. KBH balance sheet deteriorated a lot, much worse than some
other homies. I may miss on gains - if such ever occur - though.

Sold XLF, bought WFC - another Buffett holding added.

Hi Jurgis - Did you notice that WFC had one of the largest short interest
increases as of December 31
(http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUKN0764579720080107?rpc=44 )

WFC also has a positive Put/Call ratio which reflects speculators bearish
sentiment (typically this is a short term indicator).

I do like the trade as I own both C and XLF and plan to switch C into WFC or
BAC to book my loss. Part of the recent volatility is that several of these
banks report their earnings next week and it is just a question as to how bad
they will be.

C and BAC may have to cut their dividend especially if losses are bigger than
expected. The speculation is that WFC should hit their estimate but their short
interest and Put/Call ratio says different.

I have a small loss in XLF as I bought this last week as a proxy for the
financial sector while I reposition several of my sour financial stocks (both
WM and C).

an. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Countrywide Financial Corp. dropped the most since Black
Monday in October 1987 in New York trading on speculation that it needs cash to
continue operating its mortgage business.

``There's some sort of rumor that they would go under, but it's purely a
rumor,'' said Thomas Garcia, head of trading at Thornburg Investment
Management, which oversees about $50 billion in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Investors drove Countrywide shares down 79 percent last year on concern the
company was suffering from a cash shortage. The company tapped emergency credit
lines and got a bailout from Bank of America Corp. as the worst housing slump
in 16 years fueled bets that Countrywide might seek bankruptcy court
protection.

``There is no substance to the rumor that Countrywide is planning to file for
bankruptcy,'' spokesman Rick Simon said in a statement. Calabasas,
California-based Countrywide has said it has adequate liquidity to run its
business and predicted in October that it will be profitable this year. The
company posted its first loss in 25 years during the third quarter.

Countrywide shares lost $2.17, or 28 percent, to $5.47. They sank to the lowest
price since July 1996. On so-called Black Monday on Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average tumbled 23 percent.

20 Bankruptcies

At least 20 mortgage lenders have declared bankruptcy since December 2006,
according to Bloomberg data. U.S. foreclosures set a third-quarter record as
overdue payments on subprime mortgages rose. That's made investors who buy
mortgages reluctant to bid, and bankers have cut off credit lines to home
lenders.

Bank of America, the nation's second largest bank, invested $2 billion in
Countrywide in August. The preferred shares it acquired can be converted into
common stock at $18 each and pay a 7.25 percent dividend, according to a
regulatory filing at the time. Based on Countrywide's share price today, Bank
of America's investment has lost 70 percent of its value. That excludes a
$36.25 million quarterly dividend the lender was obligated to pay Bank of
America, regulatory filings show.

``They are current on all their payments,'' said Vicky Wagner, an analyst at
Standard & Poor's Corp.

Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri declined comment on the Countrywide
investment. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, slumped 3.7
percent to $38.41, the lowest since December 2003.

Credit-Default Swaps

Credit-default swaps tied to Countrywide's debt soared to a record as investors
demanded as much as 30 percent upfront and 5 percent a year to protect from a
Countrywide default for five years, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group
in New York.

Yesterday, investors were demanding 20 percent upfront and 5 percent a year.
Contracts trade on upfront payments when the market sees a high risk of
default.

Options traders increased bets the stock will slide as much as 67 percent from
yesterday's close before this month's contracts expire on Jan. 18. The number
of puts traded rose to 379,431, almost 10 times the 20-day average, and bearish
bets outnumbered bullish ones, or calls, by 2.77-to-1. The most- active
contracts, January $5 puts, surged ninefold to 90 cents.

``That's panic buying in options,'' said Peter Dunay, who oversees $160 million
including options as chief investment strategist at Leeb Capital Management in
New York. ``People are definitely speculating that Countrywide could be going
much lower.''

83 Cents

Countrywide's $1 billion of 3.25 percent debt due in May tumbled 6.5 cents to
83 cents on the dollar, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt yields about 60 percent,
or 5,759 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Trace data show.
Bonds that trade at a yield spread of 1,000 basis points are considered
``distressed,'' indicating investor concern about a default. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.

Countrywide has enough money to pay its loans, said Fitch Ratings credit
analyst Vincent Arscott in an interview. The company has $14.9 billion in bonds
and bank loans maturing in 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

although i sent an email to barney frank who never replied. apparently somebody
pointed this out to Schumer, but i just saw this today ( it was dated 11/26/07)
I think the ****! is going to hit the fan big time:

The Senator, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Committee
on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs said that FHLB Atlanta had, according to
the most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made
advances to Countrywide of 51.1 billion as of September 30 of this year. The
company, widely regarded as the largest mortgage lender in the U.S., had
pledged 62.4 billion of mortgages as collateral for the advances. These
transactions represent 37 percent of the FHLB's total advances as of the end of
the third quarter and 78 percent of Countrywide's total portfolio of mortgage
loans.

FLHBs (there are several) were created by Congress during the early days of
FDR's administration to shore up failing banks and provide money for housing.
In recent months as the sub-prime crisis has deepened, they have increased
their activity by providing secured advances to keep money flowing to mortgage
lenders.

The Senator said that he found the FHLB lending numbers "alarming as reports
continue to emerge about how Countrywide's reckless and predatory lending
practices were a leading contributor to today's foreclosure crisis. Moreover,
it is my understanding that Countrywide's loans held for investment at the bank
have been far from immune from the credit deterioration that has resulted from
unsound lending."

Schumer stated that Countrywide was reported to hold $27 billion of "pay option
ARMs" as of the end of September, over one-third of all of the loans held for
investment by the bank. Pay option ARMs are those in which borrowers can make a
monthly decision as to whether that month's payment will be enough to pay
principal and interest, interest only, or perhaps only a portion of the
interest for the month. The Senator quoted a Wall Street Journal report that 91
percent of Countrywide's option ARMS issued last year was so-called "low doc"
loans in which borrowers did not have to fully document income. He said that
delinquencies in this part of Countrywide's portfolio are reported to be
skyrocketing - jumping nearly 75 percent in the third quarter.

Schumer asked that the Federal Housing Finance Board conduct a review of the
loans that the FHLB is holding as collateral for Countrywide's loans and that
the Board seek an explanation as to how any junior or second mortgage liens
could, in a time of declining property values, be considered as adequate
collateral for FHLB advances.

According to the on-line edition of The Wall Street Journal neither Countrywide
nor Chairman Rosenfeld was available for comment late Monday.

The CFC situation is very serious. I should have recognized that the financials
and home builders are in terrible shape. It will be very difficult of
countrywide to roll over its current debt given the opaqueness of its assets,
and I expect that the fhlb doors are now closed to more loans. I expect that
there will be some kind of wedding coupled with some
guarantee that whoever acquires CFC isnt gonna lose money on it.
I guess Bank of America is the most likely candidate, the question is who wants
to take on more mortgage debt on to their books. People around here are yapping
about how new york city real estate prices are holding up but that isnt gonna
last forever either. The recession is here . Only question is how bad is it
gonna be.
I believe the best place to be is gold or gold shares and second best is
energy. I think PLG.to is a terrific speculation. I'm going to throw it out
here once again. close to its high at $2.92 but there is a real resource in
canada, an option on discovery in ghana. and its selling at about 25% discount
to its share of detour gold corp. ( owner of the canadian resource). they had
previously determined that the mine was economically feasable at $450 gold. .
PLG.to continues to be my largest position, and will probably be for quite some

interesting comments supposedly from a speech seth klarman gave in october:

....during our parents’ lifetimes and our own, credit has become increasingly
available and standards increasingly lax, to the point where credit cards and
checks backed by credit lines arrive unrequested in the mail. Where your house
can be used as an ATM, where people with dismal credit histories are eagerly
sought after to provide them with loans, where investors flock to buy junk
bonds and shady companies seek to issue them, and where investment funds are
offered the opportunity to enhance their returns through structured products,
derivatives and exotic finances, all of which enable high amounts of leverage.
The moral imperative of repaying the banker, your neighbor, who granted you the
loan across his imposing desk has been replaced by the moral vacuum of
anonymous lenders using credit scoring who quickly resell your loan to someone
you’ll never meet, who are actually comfortable with the actuarially determined
probability that you may in fact default. Credit rating agencies have embraced
the debt or-gy (offensive word detected) with lax standards and na&#239;ve
models, brewing conflicts of interest and accepting healthy fees to label toxic
waste as investment grade. A similar risk exists as a result of the burgeoning
increase in capital allocated to alternative investments – venture capital,
private equity and hedge funds. While returns start to come down as the pension
funds have looked to alternatives to add excess return and diversification,
they are hardly a panacea. Some alternative managers have historically added
considerable value while for others the jury remains out. For alternatives in
their entirety, high performance and management fees truncate upside potential
– increased competition has forced many alternative managers to incur greater
risk to achieve their accustomed returns. For some this means incurring greater
credit risk while for others this means utilizing considerable amounts of
leverage.

The pendulum may be starting to turn as recent developments in the mortgage and
hedge fund markets suggest. Because the scale of today’s leverage so greatly
exceeds historical levels , it seems possible that we are only at the early
stages of the credit contraction. Not surprisingly, it may take time to work
off these excesses. Intervention by the Fed, as it recently has, seems likely
to give license to further speculation, while failing to address and perhaps
even exacerbating the underlying problem of lax lending standards, poor credit
quality and excessive use of leverage. Indeed, many market participants believe
the solution to these problems of over-leverage and bad credit is more debt.
Recently many funds have been formed to make leveraged purchases of loans that
are expected to trade in the mid to high nineties instead of par, with 5x
leverage or more, bringing the yield to a 15% or 20% return. It seems to me
incredibly unlikely that the end to the debt crisis can be near at hand when
the solution offered – more debt – is in fact what caused the problem in the
first place. Many investors lack a strategy that equips them to deal with a
rise in volatility in declining markets. Momentum investors become lost when
the momentum wanes, growth investors who paid a premium for the fastest growing
companies don’t know what to do when expected growth fails to materialize.
Highly leveraged investors, like some quant funds in the headlines, were
recently forced to sell regardless of value when their methodology produced
losses instead of gains. Counting on a government bailout for every crisis
seems a dicey proposition, especially when supposedly impossible events happen
on Wall Street every few years. By the time the market drops and bad news is on
the front pages, it is usually too late for investors to react. It is crucial
to have a strategy in place before the problems hit precisely because no one
can accurately predict the future direction of the stock market or economy."

Hi RWS: Yes I continue to hold NYB. I still like the company even though it has
recently sold off. I think today's close will make a new 52wk low. It seems
that NYB has gotten caught up with the sell off of the other financials and now
is tracking the "ETF XLF" downward
(http://finance.yahoo.com/charts#chart2:symbol=nyb;range=1y;compare=xlf;chartty
e=line;crosshair=on;logscale=on;source=undefined)

Insiders have been acquiring NYB stock in the $17.00 - $18.00 price range.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=NYB

NYB's business is not leveraged to any sub-prime debt but rather to
multi-family loans which continue to perform well. The company has had no loan
losses in their niche for 28 years. Their non performing asset are low at .07%
of their total assets well below the average thrift at 0.75%. Their loan
portfolio statistics as of 9/30/07 were:
- % of total loans = 71.8%
- Average principal balance = $3.5 million
- Average loan-to-value ratio = 63.4%
- Expected weighted average life = 3.5 years

The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25.share and has done so for 16
consecutive quarters.

I have owned the stock for over five years and have built a position that ranks
as one of my top five. $23 is my long term target with an average cost of about
$17.

I think you have to be careful with all banks in this environment. I am
currently not buying any banks at this time but am watching WM, WFC, C, and

You may be right. IMO, right now it is very tough to figure out if BAC is a buy
or not. If they don't buy CFC, it's a buy. If they buy CFC, then a lot will
depend on the price they pay for CFC and any federal guarantees. Plus one still
has to figure out whether the price was good or bad, which is very tough with
CFCs business. So I may just invest in some other bank. Or maybe get back into
BAC if it falls a lot.

Also, if BAC buys CFC, they may have to cut dividend. This may also cause the
stock to drop.

On the yet another hand - value investors finding faults with companies and
deciding to buy later is almost a sure sign of the bottom. ;)

I am going through refi right now. Gonna be interesting. :) Nice rates for the
people who still qualify and/or want to buy something. :)

Bet you're feeling pretty good right now about your ACAS purchases today. I
sure am!

I did an unusual amount of trading today (every time I'd glance at that
monitor, something looked toppy or bottomy) but mostly I picked up some
favorites on sale.

One I traded especially heavily today was http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FMT ,
grabbing 10-20 cents here and there. It was pleasantly easy to get big trades
through today without moving it around. I ended up keeping a small portion, but
never feel compelled to hold much of that one overnight since I've got a
decent-sized batch of Jun5 calls on it at a good price, mostly to play on the
pretty extreme upward swings it's prone to do at the drop of a hat. If I don't
have the stock, I can still benefit from any of its manic spikes. In the long
haul, I intend to have a longer-term position in it as they seem to be getting
their house in order.

Also added some trading shares of http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ELN and added to
my http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WPL in the hope (I hate using that word) that
it's seen the last of the 4's. WPL's still difficult to buy or sell without
moving it, but there ended up being enough volume in it today that it wasn't as
bad. My first buy of it was at $4.81, but when I tried to buy twice as much
more at the same price, I started pushing it around and there never were enough
shares shown on the offer side to give me a good idea what I really could buy
it for. I ended up pushing it to $5 before I could get filled on the second
batch.

That's one thing I really dislike about listed stocks. Level II doesn't give
you the whole story. If you want to buy x amount of stock on the Nasdaq, you
can at least see if there are enough shares available at a price you're willing
to pay. On NYSE, you could put in an order a penny over the ask and have zero
idea if there will be enough offered to get you a fill or if you're just going
to get a partial then push the price above what you want to pay.

one of my concerns personally would be when you refinance that you find out who
your servicer is going to be. If you are escrowing insurance and real estate
taxes, you want to make sure that those are going to be paid in timely fashion.
there are reports out there of people having problems and the finding out that
their servicer failed to pay the insurance on time and that the policy lapsed.
Maybe what BAC will do is on the other hand maybe another scenario is that they
lend them $15 Billion and pick up a preferred controlling stake in the company
as an equity kicker to their secured loan. that way they wont be on the hook
for existing mortages until they work out. I certainly wouldnt count on current
equity holders getting bailed out.

OT: My experience is that concern as to who is the servicer of the loan is, is
an irrelevancy. (As long as it's not some fly-by-night operation nobody ever
heard of) The reason is, over the life of the loan - in my experience anyway -
the loan got bought and sold several times, and so I've had several companies
servicing the loan.

DFS & AXP - i was lucky enough to sell my starter positions in AXP and DFS
today after i saw the writing on the wall with COF. I wish i had done the same
with AB which lowered earnings expectations for 2007 unexpectedly. So much for
the great idea of swapping LM for AB to harvest tax losses in LM. Now i have
got losses in both.

Too early to buy into AXP even after todays haircut. i think this stock could
see a 3 as a first number. After i purchased my AXP position I started to poke
around in the SEC filings and found some reason for concern:
1) over the years AXP has reduced it's reserves for bad debt, due to better
credit performance. Now it looks like they have to reverse that trend and boost
the reserves and write of more loans.

2) It seems that under certain circumstances AXP can be forced to take back
securitized credit card receivables - up to 20B$ if my interpretation is
correct. I bet the stock would not respond well if that were come to pass.

At current prices I like DFS better, since it seems more conservatively
managed. lower loan growth is actually good going into a recession (or
something close to it). but even though i see that DFS has to add 500M$ to
their reserves as well over this cycle.this would boost reserves to 5% of
receivables, which is a reasonable number if annualized losses climb to 5%
(rule of thumb is that reserves are equal to 1x annualized loss rates for
credit card companies).

Who's next. With a fallen star like AXP i think we will see likewise with C,
Chase and BofA credit card business - the next shoe to drop after mortgage
losses (which are going to get worse too).

I see housing prices falling 5-10% this year. Compounding the losses so far i
venture to guess that vintage 2005 & 2006 buyers with 10-20% equity at the time
of purchase are going to be underwater by now. Those "prime" mortgages are
going to show much higher losses as well, I am willing to guess.

DIS - managed to add to DIS below 30$ a few days ago. I think it fits nicely

I think it's a good idea to look at stocks with the following characteristics:

1) Large cap
2) Resilient to economic weakness
3) PE < SP500
4) Strong FCF
5) Profit growth >/= SP500 for the next 3 years
6) Strong balance sheet / low leverage

So far DIS and CAH fit the bill for me and i bought them recently. AIG (which i
own also) looks good except that it's a financial (although I think their debt
is good),GE and CSCO are maybe's and strange enough I think that EBAY almost
works too (except the PE which is at a 20% premium to SP500).

would stretch BAC balance sheet so that they will see a credit downgrade, IMO.

AXP - I do not think that the growing debt is the problem - this is part of AXP
growing business. the transactions business requires float and the lending
business is debt. More business means a larger balance sheet. However what i
take offense in is that AXP has whittled down the reserves during the good
times (in terms of % of receivables) and thus shown higher earnings growth than
they would have otherwise. Also their tangible equity looks somewhat low, a
result of stock buybacks.

Now comes the double whammy - the credit losses are going to increase and the
reserves for same need to be boosted. So for roughly 50B$ in outstanding loan
an increase of 1% in credit losses will translate into 500M$ reserve increase
and 500M$ in additional credit losses or a 1B$ earnings impact. 1% increase in
losses is a very possible number, so i can almost guarantee that this 400M$
writeoff will not be the last.

That being said, AXP is a great franchise but i think we are seeing a 3 as a
first number for the stock price first.

Looks like a great value, but if they do shady things like write-up their

I got rid of my LMC shortly after DB did in the mid 10 area at an overall loss.
Of course I think its a better buy here. One of my most optimistic ideas gone
haywire in a haywire environment. I'll likely buy it back at some point as
experience has taught me the time to buy metals is when no one wants them and
they are down and out. Zinc prices losing 50% of their value in 2007 is
something that really blindsided me, as the scuttlebutt all year pointed to
inventory depletion at all storage points. Lead has a more optimistic looking
price. I suppose its just a normal correction for a metal stock, so I keep one
eye on it all the time. Increased costs and delay's in the Congo haven't helped
it in the short run. My take is the news could get worse before it gets better
on base metals in general but it's mixed. For example OMG hit an all time high
yesterday as Cobalt spot prices rose to $42.50/lb.

On another note, RELL and many others are beginning to crop up as ridiculously

CIT should be going up from here based on press release today.

The writeoff on Student Lending was intangible and means nothing. Student
lending was 13% of managed assets but only 3% of net income. 95% of the loans
are guaranteed by the Government. Home lending is only 4% of net income.

CITs normal credit provisions for reserves was about 70 mill. They are taking a
300 mill credit provision this quarter. I would wager their actual performance
on their loans including the home loans held for investment is much better. So
in the future the better performance will fall into the income statement making
higher profits.

Their regular businesses this quarter did well earning about $1.20 it would
seem without these chargeoffs.

Their main problem as I see it is funding. The securitization windows are
closed which was about 25% of their funding. They claim to be funded for 2008
but this includes using the bank LOC which is 7.5 bill. So they still need
funding of about 1.5 bill in Q1 and 4.5 bill in Q2 if they wish follow their
old means of term loans, CP etc. Most of their funding is now secured.

I am underwater with this stock big time having bought at 34 and 28. But I
expect if I hold, then by end of year I should be back in the black. I always
underestimate Mr. Market especially on the downside. The EMS industry which I

I will try to help you out here. This is pretty basic...

However, after reading about their aggressive accounting,

- it is standard accounting for a BDC.

I have second thoughts. I am most disturbed to learn that markups of investment
values are treated as income.

- It is called "Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments". It
is separate from Net Operating Income and Net realized gain on investments.

I feel that real income comes from operations...interest dividends, fees and
capital gains.

- you accept capital gains as "income". well, the net unrealized gains and
losses are recognizing the capital gains (as best as can be determined) in the
time period they occur. They are expected to be realized when the investment is
eventually sold. ACAS is in the business of buying and selling businesses. It
is their normal course of business. This is different from a company like
Toyota writing up the value of their factories because selling the factories is
not normal course of business. A mutual fund write up the value of its
businesses on a daily basis.

So, I asked the question on the ACAS board at investors Village....does any
expert know if they are required to show the markup as income? No answers!

- sounds like conclusive evidence to me. I will need rethink my investment
here.

I feel that changing values in a potfolio should be shown on the balance
sheet...not income statement....JMHO.

-- They are shown on the balance sheet. You are objecting that they also show
up as unrealized income. But in fact, we want the information. We need to know
the unrealized gains and losses. If we did not have it we would be flying
blind. That is why BDC accounting is this way. And yes, it may seem a little
more subject to opinion than the accounting of other businesses, but that's
life. (But then look at the accounting of Enron or of recent sub prime loan
valuations and tell me that regular accounting is better.)

I agree with Grommit, but would like to emphasize that you have to be
comfortable with BDC management to invest in such companies. Perhaps more than
with other companies. :)

You can also look at the history of the company and see if it had some issues
in the past. Although there is never a guarantee that management did not become
greedy or stupid in the most recent past.

Thank you for your courteous answers re ACAS.
I am not a basher.
Just feel uncomfortable that an investment can be up valued when their is no
public market for that investment, to confirm it's value by the marketplace.
I felt this is a proper forum to discuss issues of this nature.

I expect GEHL might have some coattails from TEX buying ASVI today.

Still holding onto my http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WPL but have slowed my
buying. It keeps gravitating toward $5 but really has a lot of trouble reaching
it and especially holding onto it when it gets above it.

Not optimistic that today's the day it breaks above $5 for good (though I think
it'll be within the next few weeks). Up quite a bit, but when the Ask became
$5, there were 4900 shares offered. When the volume for the day at this point
is just 12k.

I've taken advantage of 10-cent swings sub-5 but not very often and am becoming
less inclined to do so, as I don't want to be too light on it when/if it
establishes $5 as a new floor.

Fwiw, upped my few shares of http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=LPNT a little today.

P/e, p/bk, p/sales seem to indicate a buy, assuming there's no adverse news
forthcoming.

Fwiw, adding today a little to my http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ASFI position as
stock continues to fall.

High roe; low p/e attract. Assuming numbers can be maintained.

"I have confidence that we properly assessed the issues," he said, adding that
barring unexpected developments, Bank of America plans to stick with its $4.1
billion offering for Countrywide."

perhaps that is why CFC seems to be selling at a 16% discount to the .1822 BAC
at present prices.

Morningstar comments about WMI. I also think that they apply to AW. I own both
stocks. I also purchased GU this morning.

A trash hauler might seem like an odd choice for this article, but Waste
Management happens to be the largest gatherer of landfill methane gas in the
country. Methane is an insidious greenhouse gas--in terms of warming potential,
one unit of methane is 23 times more powerful than a unit of carbon dioxide.
Landfills happen to account for a third of methane emissions in the U.S. Waste
Management basically puts tubes into its landfills, gathers up the methane, and
uses the gas to generate electricity, which is sold into the grid. If we
regulate carbon, not only would the company benefit from higher electricity
prices, it may also receive carbon credits for not allowing methane to escape
into the atmosphere. Granted, landfill gas is a relatively small segment of
Waste Management's business, but we think it may provide an additional jolt of
upside for this already-undervalued company.
