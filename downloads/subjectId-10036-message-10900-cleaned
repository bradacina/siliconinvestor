Glad to have you here, please feel free to speak your mind. Although I only
short on the rarest of occasions (although I write covered calls relatively
frequently), if one believes that a company's value is out of whack to the

Craig,

I wouldn't go far as to say shorts are not part of a value investing strategy.
To each his own, but one might argue that with bonds providing a weak
counterweight to stocks over the last few decades, hedging with shorts might be
something Graham would have considered by now had he been alive. He definitely
was into market timing, and it wouldn't surprise me to learn that he felt that
shorts had a place in a rich market as a hedge against a majority long equity
position. And re: Paul's remark about hedging and shorts never coming up, I
submit that Graham's Bonds/Equity 25/50/25 theory was meant to be the
equivalent of a mild hedge strategy. As for me, I've come out ahead on my
shorts over the years, but I much favor longs, and in a fairly priced or evem
overpriced market will still overwhelming favor longs.

BTW, I think it is ridiculous to say that one must lose nearly all one's money
to have gained experience. I don't recall Buffett losing all his money at any
given point. And I don't see where 30 years experience is any better than 5
years; the person matters much more.

Good investing and keep contributing,
Mike

OFF TOPIC

Michael, that was a very gentlemanly post. Thank you.

I can truthfully say that I have enjoyed pretty good success shorting these
last 3 years, although, Amazon did help me hone my technique a bit - lol.

Shorting has provided most of my trading profits - better than longs as I can't
buy into the Momentum thing. Pretty much the only longs I do are ones mentioned
on this thread. By the way, who do I see to be compensated for my losses?

I do see that shorting is a completely different topic from 'Value' Investing.
You guys should capitalize the latter phrase or put a trademark symbol after
it. To this thread, the term means something quite specific, at variance with
general usage.

It is different, because a good short is not just a bad Value Investment. It
will have many other characteristics before being a good short investment.

On the topic of shorts being limited to a 100% ROI, that is certainly true.
However, the % of successful investments is much higher when shorting, at least
for me. What Anthony@Pacific has taught me is how prevalent outright frauds are
in the securities markets, (NTOP not being one of those as he so accused, in my
opinion). A few that are in play currently are COII, CYBR, ZERO and ENC.

In any case, shorting is a seperate topic from Value Investing.

I very much appreciate the civilized tone that has survived here on this
thread, not to mention the intelligence, open-mindedness, and humility.

Mike,
You know, I had never had an interest in short selling until I finished reading
the 1934 edition of Security Analysis last November. It really freaked me out
how much things are alike now and how they compare with the speculation in the
market before the crash. History always repeats itself, I really think the
market is overpriced, figured adding some shorts could protect myself from the
inevitable downturn. I was proven correct when the market dropped from 4,000 to
3,000, and all those high flying overpriced stocks I was short came back to
earth with a vengence.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

On another note, I believe you had mentioned in the past you were watching the
housing stocks. Are you still interested? I have been in and out of DHI and
CROS over the past 6 months, just can't resist getting out after quick 50%
runups several times. CROS looks interesting right now, as does NHCH, but the
low outstanding float bothers me. Some Olymia company bought 80% of the
outstanding shares, and the company seems pretty tight lipped about everything.

While leaving Paul to defend his tone, I will say that I would be richer if I
had listened when he posted the same diatribe to me about a year ago. The
walking forward vs. walking backward thing looks trite until you try both and
realize your brain is geared to one but not the other. I am very good with
valuation and financial details, but I got absolutely killed shorting a series
of stocks. I had most of them right in the end, but got stopped out (or
chickened out) just before they crashed, which made the losses even more
painful. Like Paul said, its something every value investor thinks they can do,
and I know some who can. But I can't. What I learned about myself is that I can
gut out a stock I own until it works, but I get quickly scared out of a short
position. And that basically guarantees losses. So I don't do it anymore.

If it took a few losses to learn that lesson, fine. But it is one you've got to
learn yourself. But saying it can't be done is probably not real productive -
saying its not as easy as it looks is more on the mark. If it works for you,
God bless ya. And if you've never shorted a stock, and want to try it, I
wouldn't discourage some small bets to see if it works for you.

Craig, if you are prepared for a short to double or triple on you, what kind of
strategy is it to take risks of 100-200% against you for the potential of up to
100% if the thing goes bankrupt, and realistically more like 50-75%. How can
that be a risk/reward that is tolerable to you, when you can pick longs by the
hundreds that have better risk/reward. Is this part of some overall market
sensitivity neutralization strategy?

I too watch the housing stocks, although in my case it is the manufactured
housing stocks. I think that eventually a correctly timed purchase will deliver
5 times on your money on the right ones. Which and when is the trick.

To Mike Burry - Ahhh, the exuberance of youth. You do not have a clue what the
1973-74 bear market was like and until you do, you won't know what I mean - and
you won't learn it be watching someone else "dumber than you" lose their shirt.

Well maybe it's also something about "I would rather learn from other peoples
mistakes, then make the same ones."

Pehaps we just see this quite differently. My guess about you is that your
learnings are about technique. Learning from the mistakes of others who sell
short, your response is to study the current successful practitioner, have a
better plan of action than the average guy, and be more disciplined about
sticking to it. (Maybe my descriptions aren't quite right, but the learnings
are attempts to learn/fix/improve technique)

Whereas my learning is, that most people can't get short-selling right, even
hedge funds sometimes seem to blow up, there seem to be more people getting
rich buying stocks than shorting them, ergo the odds would suggest I avoid
spending much time/money at all in short selling. You get to say I am a little
staid in my methods.

On a positive note, I get to admire your opportunistic aggressiveness. From
your profile you seem to be in value stocks, day-trades, swing trades---
everything. Surprised there's no options/leaps action. Meanwhile, in looking
for common ground, some of the value stocks you choose/chose (e.g. ACK) seem
worth a further look to me.

Paul Senior, who says
if you are in the market, then this game isn't over yet.
Eight years playing the market gets you two notches for your belt. (You got
through Fall '98 & 1st half '00 and are still here.) 7-8 months of heavy
short-selling experience gets you a congratulation from me on your success, but
zero notches. While it's of course about money, it's also - for those who
haven't cashed out - about who will be left after the next notch point.

HOLD ON

About this "experience" issue and notches in the belt, what a crutch. The two
are not equivalents.

Buffett did not live through the Depression, but somehow was able to anticipate
and profit from the 1970s. His returns have been steadily the same in the 1990s
as in the 1950s. I don't recall in any of what's written about him that he
claims the 1970s - the market's gyrations - made him a better investor. In
fact, I don't recall this argument being made by any of the value strategists
that I admire.

I will give that experience may be measured in years. But for any person to
claim that he/she is somehow a better investor - or to belittle another
investor - because of this experience is ridiculous, petty, and ignorant.
Evidently age is not certain to confer at least one quality - the ability to
differentiate between population-based generalization and individual outcomes.

This will inevitably become a battle between the young and the old. After all,
how can an older investor not take comfort that his 40-50 years of experience
is somehow better than 10 years of experience? And how can someone with 10
years of experience not think that the 10 years mean something? That would take
an incredible amount of self-invalidation that is generally not humanly
possible. Certainly if one lost a lot of money in the early 70's, then
self-invalidating those dues would be even less humanly possible.

But Paul and Jeffrey, you should be ashamed of your snide and snooty smears on
the ages of contributors here. You two should have more self-control and
self-awareness. Part of that awareness should be that there are indeed people
who can adapt, learn, and apply better than you. Believe it! Time in the market
does not qualify you to stand at the top of the mountain, and pushing others
down exposes yourselves and creates an environment where you too will be pushed
down. It is all extremely unproductive.

And the younger contributors might want to consider not touting their
experience, as it will most surely not measure up to some of the older members'
experience, and will invite ridicule, whether deserved or not. Let the
arguments, ideas, and strategies stand on their own. On those, we will be
rightly open to attack. But at least the personal angle will not have been
introduced.

I've appreciated the insights of Senior and Bash when it comes to analysis and
strategy points. But the overly confrontational and too-personal tone reflects
their surnames too often, is not necessary and is one of the major reasons this
thread has been criticized as too clubby. A newbie gets at most two strikes,
and I'm sure a few have browsed the thread only to not post because of the
personal attack that sometimes greets certain posts.

I will forever remember Paul's welcome message to me - to the thread that I
started:
"You're a doctor, ipso facto a lousy investor."
What a neat but perfectly ignorant and completely unproductive judgement. Can
we keep this stuff to a minimum?

Mike, everyone is entitled to their own opinions , wrong or misguided though
they may be. as a teenage investor I was wiped out in 69-70. It taught me that
nothing goes straight up, and that an overly concentrated portfolio is not a
good thing, and that professional analysts are frequently bamboozled by the
companies that they cover. I hope I have learned from these mistakes. You are
certainly right about Buffett. But how many Buffetts are there? I think Paul
and Jeff are right in warning people that have not been through a prolonged
bear market of the potential devestating experience it can be. Most people do
not have Mr. Buffetts conviction to keep buying as the share price keeps
dropping for years. Nor do they have WB's ability to know the companies that
will be thriving 10 years into the future. Of the 30 companies that I owned
during that period I belive only Disney, ABC , and Chrysler have survived, and
I think that the appreciation on Chrysler was pretty woeful. OTOH had I just
held on to the DIsney stock I would have my own Island now.

ACtually I have never had a short triple on me, and only one double on
me(KREM). I guess what I am saying is, I have seen so many people get greedy,
start a position with way to much of their capital, turn around, come back
three hours later and see that it's tripled in price. I've seen it happen,
margin calls and everything. I am just prepared that temporarily it could
conceivably triple in price. But, if I have researched the short properly, and
allocated properly, I should have the nerve to hold out and wait for it to come
back to earth.

Here is a recent example only three days ago. ZERO. A bunch of questinable
press releases about a questionable product. I started a position short at 8. I
watched it hit over 14 the next day, I shorted a lot more at 14. Today it's in
the 7's. It didn't bother me that it double in one day, they almost always come
back to earth, of course there are those few that don't come back right
away(KREM).

I have actually been watching several of the manufactured housing stocks as
well, but havn't taken a position yet. I agree, I wasn't even born yet when the
bear market of 73-74 was around, so I have no idea.

The ability to learn from history without repeating it travels with the ability
for abstract thinking, and there are varying levels of these abilities
distributed among individuals within the population. For one to judge another
as somehow lacking this ability assumes that one has an unsurpassable ability
in this regard. "If it happened to me, it will happen to you." One of the

Congrats on the ANF. I would like to bring to this thread's attention that GATX
is announcing it will sell its Terminals division. In my web site analysis
justifying my buy, I had said,

"There are a lot of assets ripe for shedding (as indicated by the $115 million
being paid for just two of its tens of terminals) as well as potential for high
returns in certain operating segments (especially Capital). This company needs
capital allocation expertise, and if it didn't have it before, it has it in
spades now."

I was referring to Buffett jumping two-feet-first on board. Terminals includes
many terminals owned outright -at least 15 in the US - and several significant
statkes in international ones that bring its total to at least 34 terminals.
They also own 4 pipelines, and they own, not lease, the significant amount of
land related to all this. Now it's for sale.

The question is what is left? We'll have to see what all this goes for, but
this could drastically reshape the balance sheet and place a load of capital in
the hands of the master allocator. There's even a vehicle already existing
within the company, Capital, that is growing at least 15 years and has
interests in telecommunications.
GATX Rail and the steamship company are both still there too.

My latest purchase is LDP- an offshore insurance company based in the channel

capital company and has many venture capital investments, the largest of which
in terms of market cap is an optical company called NUFO.
I did not evaluate what I think NUFO is worth, but the market is valuing today
at $540MM while the market cap of LDP is about $850MM, I believe this is way
too low, and the thread of LDP which is excellent contains a valuation
indicating that it could be worth as much as $37. I believe there is a lot of
room for profit here as well as a large margin for errors and miscalculations.
I have taken a full position. The way I analyze things my assessment is that
there has been significant institutional buying today and this may be a

As one old geezer to another, I think investing skills start deteriorating at
some point for many people. Without going into detail, I think many of the
things that are evidence of weakened mental performance generally in the
elderly have implications for reduced investment performance. I see it daily in
elderly in-laws that live nearby (in their 70's) - a lot more of their lives is
devoted to healthcare issues, and age, health and medications are clearly
affecting their mental performance versus 10 years ago. I believe, that most

seasoned leaders. There's clearly a plan to maximize shareholder returns afoot,
and the few comments from management that I've seen seem to be Buffettisms.
There's a connection, though it may be indirect.

With all due respect, those are pretty healthy assumptions about Buffet getting
involved considering you don't know for sure if he has even read their annual
report. This easily ( and probably ) is Louis Simpson's company. At the annual
meeting, Buffett was asked about one the companies he "suppossedly" owned x% of
and stated he never read the annual report. It was Simpsons. Simpson's a big
boy. He doesn't need to check Omaha to make a big investment. With all due
respect.

My understanding is that Buffett handles the supercat float, namely National
Indemnity, among others (namely Gen Re), while Simpson handles the GEICO float.
According to the latest filing, GEICO and its subsidiaries own 5.9% of GATX.
Berskhire Hathaway through National Indemnity appears to own 14.9%. There's a
difference there - 9% absolute - that I'm attributing to Buffett. I have never
heard nor read that Lou Simpson stretches outside of GEICO to manage
Berkshire's other float.

Moreover, there is a similar arrangement for Dun & Bradstreet (14.9% for
National Indemnity reported, then 4.9% for GEICO) and I know that there were
comments on DNB at the annual meeting from the chieftans themselves. Pretty
specific too. Why would they pay less attention to a stake in GATX, especially
when the fundamentals of the investments (unlocking value by corporate action)
are so similar?

I could be mistaken, as the ways of Buffett are never entirely clear.
Nevertheless, it appears that GATX has had a fire lit under it since Berkshire
took a stake. Sold off 81% of its Logistics and now will sell off 100% of its
Terminals, both pieces that have great asset and strategic values but generate
little in operating profit. We're getting left with the cash-generating
machines of the company and the investment arm.

Whatever the reason, the investment is panning out for the reasons I bought it.

With all due respect,
Mike

Mr. Bartels. May I politely inquire as to what you are buying these days as
relates to value stocks? From your posting of your performance record (six
consecutive years of 100% gains as I recall), you have (imo, and it's only a
guess) the best record of anyone who's ever posted on the value thread. Could
you say what portion of that superior performance is related to value stocks?

As for me, today I sold some Lehman (LEH) about $111. (I mentioned it here in
the low 30's, but there was no interest.) I added more to my small position in
TRW as it's dropped down to near my buy point. Someone here or on the
Buffettology group mentioned Friedman's (FRDM)- a jewelry store chain which
I've avoided because it's very much trashed by "knowledgeable" people the Yahoo
thread. But FRDM's remained on my watch list, and they recently announced good
sales and earnings. I decided to assume that mgmt isn't cooking the books by
booking unsustainable sales through lowering credit standards, and I've started
a small position. I'm a follower of(but do not have a position in) Michael's
Stores (MIKE). Monitoring its competitors also, I see now that Jo Ann Stores
(JASA) seems to be at a very reasonable price, so I've started a small position
there. (It's not as good as MIKE and not exactly in the same business.)

I follow and own some of the stocks in the computer forms business. For example
I recently posted that I was adding to my position in Reynolds and Reynolds
(REY). I'm now starting a position in Wallace Computer (WCS). It's similar to
others in the industry in that it is struggling, it faces internet challenges,
and its stock is also low compared to previous years, book value, and sales.
Plus there's a decent dividend yield.

As to the discord we're seeing here, this too shall pass IMHO - this thread is

hope.

Regarding your request for SNDK info. I brought SNDK here as a value investment
maybe 18 months ago. A brief discussion ensued whether it was or was not a
value stock. Regardless, the market did carry the stock a little higher. I own
it. I sometimes trade in/out of my core position. Go to the SNDK thread.
Ausdauer's posts are worth reading, especially his 'for newbies' summaries. I'm
also very partial to Art Bechoefer there. Art's a professional money manager
who argues that SNDK IS undervalued based on criteria for evaluating dominant

If anyone has experience buying distressed bonds, please PM me. I need a crash
course in understanding the outlandish spreads being quoted to me and how to
deal with them.

I'm replying here in case any others are interested. PM me if you wish, but
let's try to keep most of the discussion public, OK?

I wouldn't say that I have "experience", but I have done it. Frankly, the area
intrigues me, and I'm a bit surprised that there isn't more interest amongst
value investors in this. The analysis of distressed bonds seems (to me anyhow)
to dovetail neatly with the analysis one does for value stocks,
bankruptcy-candidate shorts, and fraud shorts (hey, one out of three on topic
ain't bad, eh? ;-)

What bonds are you interested in, and what spreads have you been quoted? I
could check with my broker (a major US one that most here ought to have access
to) to see what they can get.

One thing I have found is that, contrary to what most bond columnists seem to
suggest, one does not need to place an order in the hundreds of thousands of
dollars in order to get a decent price (i.e., if your investment idea is good,
and it works, then the spread/commission is quite bearable).

I believe I've mentioned Loewen here before. After following it for years as a
short candidate, I finally shorted the common at $C3 (boy, I sure wasn't
"early" on this short!), and at the same time i bought a much, larger position
in their '02 CAD bonds. I've since covered my short, but will likely short
again, and probably a much bigger position, if the stock does one of those
spastic doubles or triples that bankruptcies often seem to do in their twilight
days.

I bought the bonds at 50 -- at the time I think the spread was 50-52. Since my
intention was to hold the bonds to either maturity (about a 30% YTM) or
restructuring, I found that to be a (more-than) acceptable spread. FWIW, I rode
that position up to the low 70s, down to the low 40s, and back to 54, which is
where they've been quoted for several months. Perhaps I should have been
trading them??? ;-)

My original estimate was that the bonds were worth at least 70, under a
reasonably adverse break-up or re-org, and conceivably worth nearly 100, if
some things went reasonably right). Chief in establishing this margin of safety
was my estimate (to which I would really, really appreciate anyone challenging
or commenting on!) that so long as they did not overpay for their properties by
more than 3X fair value (during their many years debt-and-equity-funded
acquisition binges), then the bonds should be good for 70.

Absolutely. Distressed bonds do seem like they would fit here, and could be a
nice addition to the thread. If there is a whole lot of interest, maybe a new
thread can be spun off just so that people signing in nightly that aren't
interested don't have to wade through tens of bond posts. But a few posts here
and there should be bearable. I personally don't have the experience, but if
someone on the sidelines wants to come in and contribute, please do.

RE: NITE

I've followed NITE closely over the past 10 months and would advise considering
the following:

1) There are a handful of major shareholders (EGRP, AMTD, TWE, etc) that tend
to burn cash at a fast pace, and start liquidating their NITE positions when
the price is right.

2) The stock has found support in the 27-28 range twice this year.

3) With light trading expected in the 2nd quarter, they may be in danger of
either failing to meet expectations or failing to meet the whisper #. In either
case, it would be the first in a long time that they wouldn't exceed estimates
by a sizable margin.

I also think that NITE has the potential to double, but that would be
unsustainable due to heavy insider selling that more than likely would occur.
Based on the above, I am a seller of NITE anywhere in the 30's. I have actively
traded them several times and don't see a burning desire to start loosing
money, so I'd much rather play it safe and wait to see 2nd quarter #'s.

In theory that works, but in theory you can short PALM. Try.

Also, Barrons outlined an absolutely diabolical employee stock options

Allen - I saw your post about option adjustment on 3COM. I have done some work
on this and it is clear that it is great if you are a 3COM employee option
holder. Using today's closing price of COMS and COMSV, the dilution would be
enormous. COMS closed today at $67 and COMSV closed today at $12. The quantity
of options is adjusted by multiplying the existing number of options by the
COMS price and dividing by the COMSV price. Using the roughly 40mn options that
COMS has outstanding, multiplying by "the ratio" of 5.8 (67 divided by 12)
gives new options outstanding of 220 mn (on a base of 350mn primary shares).

To adjust the strike price, take the strike price of each option and divide by
the ratio (5.8). According to the footnotes of last years 10K there were 49mn
options outstanding with an average strike price of $25.60. 3Com has already
told us that due to option exercise, expiration, and new grants the net effect
of all these combined between the 10k and today is to decrease the number of
options by 9mn, I will assume that lower strike priced options were exercised
and higher priced granted, making the new average strike price a few dollars
higher, call it $28. Now divide the old adjusted average strike price of $28 by
the ratio of 5.8 which results in a new average strike price on the stub of
about $4.80 per option. Of course these will all move around with the price of
COMS and COMSV prior to July 27, but these are illustrative of what would
happen were today the distribution day.

I am holding it and probably will hold it for the long haul unless I see

the insiders holding of 50%

BARRA has an index that breaks the S&P 500 down between value and growth based
on price-to-book. You might want to check out the S&P/BARRA Value index.

Also, Frank Russell has several value and growth indices you can use depending
on the capitalization range of the manager. Look at the Russell 1000 Value for
a Large Cap value manager, the Russell 2000 Value for a Small Cap manager and
the Russell 3000 Value for an All Cap Value manager. I also believe Russell has
a Russell Midcap Value index.

Wallace, you have a difficult task. There are no good value benchmarks. There
are benchmarks. S&P Barra. Russell. You could even use the Vanguard or Schwab
Value Index funds for un-managed but more realistic performance. BUT all these
do is take the slowest growing, most depressed big-caps and through them
togetther. I think most value investors would agree that there is not much
reason to call that value investing.

Your best bet is to pick some active managers in the value category and pit
them against your manager. Say Legg Mason Focus Trust. Say Third Avenue Value.
Say Tweedy Browne. Say
Sequoia. There's a bunch of them. Maybe you can take an average of 10 or so of
these over different time periods.

I just use the S&P 500 to benchmark myself. The simple reason is that it is by
far the easiest, cheapest index to invest in, and it has shown its ability to
pound into the ground just about every mutual fund manager out there over time.
And you're just as likely to find a correlation with what true value investors
do as you are by picking a big so-called value index.

To me benchmark means alternative. Any number of active managers, individually
or as a group, could be. But then
of course you get into past performance issues and that
whole mess...Good luck.

This net-net thing still works.

A couple net-nets that were hurting me have bounced back. After taking 25% of
pain in my investment in HBI, all of a sudden it went back up over my $2 cost
in the last week. And EBSC had a nice day today when management caved in to the
disident shareholders. EBSC has been a big disappointment, but I'm only down
about 10% below my cost. Recently sold BL for a nice short-term profit, and SYM
is ticking up quite nicely from my 3 3/4 cost (that one is still a screaming
buy in my opinion). GTSI I got the bottom, and every so often it pops 15% and
gives me a chance to sell some shares. I hold half my position now to sell on a
bigger pop or to take back to a full position at that magic 2 3/4 level where
the stock always seems to bottom.

Of these, I would buy SYM aggressively at the current level if I didn't already
own it, with a price target of $6-10.

If you're still holding BL, I think you really need to think hard about the
news that is destroying Federated Dept. Stores (their Fingerhut sub is killing
them and that is the closest comp to Blair).

GTSI just put in a limit order for 2 3/4 if it starts testing that level again.

EBSC I am looking for an exit, though it has held $4 tenaciously so downside
looks limited in the short-term at least.

I have found HBI requires nerves of steel - I still think this one has a
reasonable probability of a double or triple, but boy is it hard to own.

FWIW, I have started a CCL thread:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=36387
Certainly don't expect it to ever hit the hot subjects list, but there it is.
Finally, SYMC is getting the attention it deserves. A great quarter, and a
rightful reward yesterday. The CC was well handled, and it's always nice to see
earnings guidance going up - in this case, from 23 to 30 percent.

Give the poor guy a break. Mike's put up around 25% return for the year, by far
out pacing all indexes and probably most fund managers.

Anyway, congrats Mike and others that bought into SYMC. Apparently there were a
lot of people impressed with their earnings report. Unfortunately for me, I
chickened out (as I was heavily weighted in SYMC) because of all the other
software industry pre-announcements and sold half my position when it hit 54 a
couple days ago.

I am also looking forward to see what the market thinks of ALSC's profit
report. I don't think it looks half bad, and do feel good about getting the
business for nothing (initially bought on Wednesday, thanks Armin).

My current holdings are: AINN, ALSC, CAT, DHOM, ECIL, FMER, HBAN, MO, OCR, ONE,
SNH, SNPS, SYMC, T. I'm not smart enough to follow 1,000 stocks like Paul, so I
try to keep under 15 holdings at a time.

I'd like to buy: SNH under 8 1/4 (today so I can get that dividend), SYMC
(under 50, yeah right), CD under 13, BTGC under 10, and right now that's about
it.

I would submit that is what all indices do whether its the Wilshire, Russell,
S&P 500, etc. All indices tend to be a random combination of stocks where ANY
investor would agree that there is not much reason to call that investing,
period.
Further, I think you'd be surprised to know some of the names in these value
indices and question whether they are value stocks at all. Example: S&P/BARRA
Value contains 390 stocks including Kla-Tencor, Hewlett Packard, Motorola,
American Express, Novellus Systems, American Intl Group, Disney, and on and on.
Russell 1000 Value contains 758 stocks including GE, Wal Mart, American Intl
Group, Coca Cola, Hewlett Packard, Johnson & Johnson, Qwest, American Express
and on and on.

Short of creating your own index based on your investing style (screening
techniques, similar attributes and fundamentals) there will always be issues
associated with finding an appropriate benchmark to measure portfolio
performance. It is not unique to value investing. I do agree with you that a
comprehensive universe comparison is a better way to go in determining the
relative performance of a manager but those typically come at a cost.

Cheers,
JS

Wallace - a decent value index that other value managers use for comparison is
the Russell 1000 Value (on bloomberg RLV index)

Two others worth investigating are the Philadelphia Value Line index (VLE on

You are probably not thanking me for ALSC right now bob. I don;t understand the
market values today at all. I thought the numbers were great the two analysts
who follow the company both upped their ratings from buys to strong buys and
the stock is down today. Another company I own CMTO is probably the largest
loser on Nasdaq today. I saw the release and could not understand why it was
even down. They reported a 138% increase in revenues. Its not a value stock,
but it at these rates it may soon become one. LDP is down although its portfoio
keeps growing in value.

I have been watching what I would consider a value stock for the past few
years. NHCH. Home builder, P/E 3.61, EPS of 1.80, book value of almost 10 a
share, EPS last quarter was up 167%, revenues up 47%, selling at 6 5/8 a share.
EPS has been growing over 25% for the past few years. I bought some over a year
ago at 5 1/2, but have since sold, but still am looking to get back in. I know
interest rates will effect home sales, but this is dirt cheap! Am I missing
something here?

Something I don't quite understand. One of the beneficial holders sold out all
it's stock to TECHNICAL OLYMPIC USA for over $9 a share late last year. It's
been quite a while since it has even seen close to $9 a share. Anyone else
following this that can shed some light on the stock, or whether this could be
a value play?

I own and have owned a similar home builder in DHOM for several years and would
like to add this perspective because it also seems to apply to NHCH.

I'd say the biggest negative to these stocks and this industry relates to
inventory and operating cash flows. It seems that while we are at a point in
the economy that things are starting to slow down, interest rates are higher,
less new homes are being constructed, but these home builders continue to
invest millions in work in progress homes and land. They seem to take the
assumption that real estate prices will always go up (which very well might
be). As a result as interest rates remain at higher levels they are required to
carry higher interest debt for longer periods of time.

Look at the operating cash flows for NHCH for the past 2 years and you'll
notice they can't generate enough cash to run operations and purchase all the
land they want, so they rely on their idiot bankers to blindly lend them money.
Ask management why "in a period that profits and revenue are growing and
strong, why can they not generate enough cash to provide positive cash from
operations for a single quarter?" The answer I got at the DHOM annual meeting
from the CFO was "Uhh...really...I'm not sure, but I'm sure it will improve in
the future because of increased profits" - These guys are idiots or maybe I
just don't understand.

What would you think of Ford or any other manufacturer that could not afford to
buy the parts to assemble their product without borrowing money? It's
ridiculous, even if it's the industry norm (hence my belief as to why the
industry is so cheap right now).

These companies also have to rely 100% on subcontractors in the local areas
they work. Typically these large homebuilders consist of project
superintendents and sales people. So they take a big risk by relying on certain
subcontractors in current work regions and risk getting involved with less
desirable contractors when they move into new regions. An example I've seen
several times is that one of the companies major subcontractors runs into
financial hardship, so these generous/(arogant) generals will actually pay
higher prices up front to keep these contractors in business. (in one of the
cases I refer to, the business owner of the sub actually used some of the cash
injection to buy a nice new Cadillac). I consider this extremely dangerous to
the industry, because they are condoning poor business practices.

I am a believer that in a strong economy these companies should be idiot proof
and they could return to prosperity. But a recession could also devastate the
industry. I am also a long-term holder in a very small position in DHOM (for
reasons other than financial gain..ie I would not recommend purchasing to
anybody right now). Craig, you be your own judge.

why "in a period that profits and revenue are growing and strong, why can they
not generate enough cash to provide positive cash from operations for a single
quarter?" 

Bob, you hit on the primary reason I'm not in the home builders. Looking at the
cash flows of the few companies I was intereste in led me to the same question.
It wasn't always negative, but it was never big enough for me to think it would
not become so significantly negative during a downturn as to wipe out the small
positive during the boom time. Net zero or net negative over the cycle.

I thought there might be a dynamic that I did not understand. And could not
understand. How comfortable for me to know that DHOM's CFO is in the same boat.
The way some of these companies purchase inflated real estate during the boom
times, I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

Good investing,
Mike

I'm with Mike on the homebuilders. Either there is something about the
accounting I don't understand, or the balance sheets and cash flows in the
industry are systematically horrendous, even in good times. They look cheap,
but that doesn't mean they are cheap. I don't own them and I've never owned
them, though I look at them every so often just wondering if I'm missing
something when I see a $6 stock earn $1.50 in a quarter. There are some
diamonds in the rough here. One is Crossmann (CROS), though they have faltered
and I want to see them get battletested through a downturn and see how they do.
And Toll seems to have something special. Other than that, I pass.

Clayton and the manufactured homebuilding industry has completely different
economics, probably because they don't have to inventory land or build on spec.

No doubt some of these homebuilders are truly very cheap, but be careful with
land valuation. Book value of these highly levered balance sheets can disappear
in a hurry if they own speculative inventory of marginal land. Only an expert
can do this level of analysis. I have heard from an industry insider that the
three best in terms of smart land inventory management (maybe not today - this
is more of a long-term management question I asked an executive a couple years
ago) were Toll, Lennar and Crossmann. But that's the best information I have -
no way to verify that.

Anyone here own SWS (which I've owned off and on several times)? Considering
re-entry.

Evidently, a very large short position (IMHO such buying power is bullish),
plus Bear Stearns is still advising them on a possible (repeat possible)
buyout. Negatively, also IMHO, is that Bear has been advising them since March
with no action.
SWS just made a purchase of its own, this may be the reason the stock has
traded down recently.
It also has all the +/- of a company that deals in many areas of the securities
