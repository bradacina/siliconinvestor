re Income securities. Jurgis has reported some bond purchases here. i sometimes
wonder if income securities are where the real bargains are nowadays. For
example I purchased some JBS @11.5$ (of course I am down on that purchase to
they trade at 10.5%$). This is a JCP preferred yielding 7% on 25$, so it pays
1.75$ annually. So right now it's trading at a 16%+ yield at 42% on the $. Also
JCP is a retailer( yuck) their balance sheet looks relatively healthy and they
are still making money. it does not look as they are going bankrupt anytime
soon. So why would I want to own JCP stock if I can own a 16$ security with
better downside protection trading for 42c on the $?. if JCP's prospect improve
this preferred could trade at a 10% yield=17.5$ without any stretch of
imagination. It seems nuts but JBS is not alone out there - there are many
preferreds and bonds trading at levels that almost seem surreal.

Some if it is the Fannie/Freddie effect where the preferred go wiped out
because the government backstop did not apply to them but with nonfinancials we
have some hard assets backing up the debt so a total wipeout is quite unlikely.

Spekulatius,

Bond purchases were "real bargains" last week. ;) Now, with the crash of
stocks, stocks are becoming better bargains again. :)

Let's put it this way. Last week, you could get a preferred or a bond with
~20-30% yield to maturity with 2-3 year term. This week I see stocks that could
go 100% up in a month... - I mean "in two years" :) - and still be undervalued.

Sure, bonds/preferreds still have a higher security of return - there are only
two possible outcomes: you get your yield and principal or company goes poof
and you get some principal (perhaps). With stocks there is always a risk that
they won't go up 100% if people bunker down in their nuclear shelters.

Maybe the secret is to buy a mix. :)

RE: "I think all regular participants on this board firmly believe they can
exceed that return in the long run."

That's always the belief. The Wilshire 5000 is down 40% for the year, 20% of
that in the past week. The more diversified a portfolio, the more certain it is
to track the market as a whole.

Gold on the other hand is up 10% for the week. Dollar for dollar, it beat the
market by 30%. The only way to beat the market is to limit your exposure to the
market. There might be one or two times per decade that stocks truly represent
a good value. Those are the only times it is anything other than financial
suicide to own stock. There are also maybe one or two times per decade that it
makes sense to short the market. At those times out of the money index puts, a
year or more out, are the best value.

The rest of the time, the stock market is nothing more than a fancy way for
compulsive gamblers to lose money.

Bought a few shares of PBR on the open to add to my current holdings. Here is a
new report regarding PBR's oil and gas reserves. It's very promising long term.
Deep Water Brazil
Summary and Recommendation
http://www.mcdep.com/mr80916.pdf

Trying to buy more DRYs at these levels. They will be spinning off their UDW
business. This business was valued at $30/share. You can get the bulk shipping
business for free. I believe the market is concerned about their large amount
of debt. Their cash flow from their long term contracts should cover their
debt.

I had a low ball offer in on DRYs and will not chase it but will try to buy
more shares at any new low.

Adding to my PWE holdings. It feels good to buy at 1/2 price as I sold my
previous position at $28 last month. Stock trading today around $14.

The president speaks this morning and I believe we will have another chance to
pick up bargains as the market tends to fall when he talks.

I picked up a few shares of GE as the company said their dividend is safe. The
yield is around 6%. I like many of their business operations (other than their
Finance unit). I believe management is working on de-leveraging their Finance
operations and bringing down any portfolio risk they may previously had.

This should be a safe value hold. Buffet holds warrants at $22.5 which should
be a ceiling on the price in the short term.

Did you notice in the McDep report all of the Deep Water Drill sites they plan
to have the UDW rigs placed? I think it is going to be a bonanza for DRYs UDW
Division at over $650K/day lease rates. They are going to have a total of six
rigs available and it's quite possible that the day rates go higher. The nice
thing is the oil companies lease these rigs on multi-year contracts (some up to
10 years!)..

I picked up even more shares of DRYs this last hour and now have increased my
total position by 40%. My original investment (May 2006 -before their UDW
acquisition) was at $10/share which I rode up to $130 only selling enough
shares to cover my seed money costs. Those round trip plays are no fun but the
future looks good for this one.

I do think the market is missing the hidden value Drys have to offer but this

So at the end of the day:

- Added to IR, CX, BCSPRC.
- Sold remaining WFC. Maybe a mistake.

Probable mistakes/omissions: Not buying WSC and BRKB at the open drops. Partial
fault of Fido who were not giving me access to cash. Also missed HRAY at $1.73
which was way below their net cash.

Looking forward:
IR - trading below book, but their net tangible assets are negative. Probably
stock is dropping on this fact.
CX - ditto + foreign reporting, which is a disadvantage in this economy + some
derivative scare.
CHME - below book, but book is mostly made from receivables that may be hard to
collect if Chinese hospitals (especially private ones?) have trouble with
getting credit.
GPOR - below book. Oil price issues. Maybe should have added it or OXY. Next
week. ;)
SLT - below book. A bit unclear what their balance sheet will look in a
quarter. Foreign company.
WSC - below book? (tough to calculate due to investments).

BID, SWCEY, LTUS, ASFI - trading at ridiculous prices, but I am not adding
more, since I am not sure about the future of these companies.

I own a bunch of rather dinky companies that perhaps I should not own, but at
current prices selling them does not make any sense. None of them, except ASFI,
are in any danger of BK, so holding them makes more sense. I was too slow to
get out of some of them. On the other hand, some of them show paper gains over
10% today - although some of this may amount to ridiculous bid/ask spreads.

Tough to make any definite forward plans in this market.

I'm way underwater on it too, but have collected dividends on it for 3 or 4
quarters, so it's somewhat mitigated.

Right now I'm faced with a bit of a tough choice. I could get rid of
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GE and http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=JPM for
profits representing a few years of the dividends I bought them for.

But I'm leaning toward hanging onto those profits and just letting dividends
increase them while (hopefully) the share prices continue to improve.

At least right now the fact that I went pretty deeply into margin in the
trading account isn't adding too much to my anxiety.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ACAS is a tough one to get a read on. That market
keeps vacillating between liking it and hating it. It never has loved it. But
if the dividend stays intact, I don't much care what the market thinks of it.

Madharry, sorry about your troubles with mog.to.

I don't know what is worse, having one of these dink companies with apparently
good numbers and/or apparently good prospects go belly up and wipe out one's
investment - or have something like AAA rated GE that pays a dividend but whose
stock just drops and drops.

I'm one who tries to control risk by position sizing. Much more willing to bet
more on something like GE or other DOW stocks (not GM!) than make a big bet on
a "best idea" unproven mog. So my losses with these better/bigger companies are
much larger when they don't work out, than I have with companies like mog.
Although... even though my bets are smaller with dink microcaps, I've got
positions in many, so overall lots of $ losses.

message #32422 (http://www.mcdep.com/mr80916.pdf )

Here is what they conclude from the article:

"...We believe in the long-term appeal of energy investments. Meanwhile, in a
press release last week, Petrobras estimated recoverable reserves of 3 to 4
billion barrels at Yara (65% PBR, 25% BG) (see map, page 2, from PBR
disclosures). Combined with last year’s estimate of 5 to 8 billion barrels at
nearby Tupi (65% PBR, 25% BG), the range of total recoverable reserves has a
midpoint of 10 billion barrels. That is enough to support a million barrels a
day from the ten platforms PBR has ordered for delivery in 2013 to 2016..."

Spekulatius - The idea of using a portion of the "rescue plan" proceeds to buy
a special class of Preferred bank shares in all US banks (or at least those US
banks that want to participate in the program) is an excellent approach too.
You get an immediate multiplier effect of 10:1 (for each dollar spent) based on
the current bank reserve ratio requirements. If the foreign countries followed
the same approach, I believe Global liquidity would free up. There would have
to be some "back room" understanding by the participating banks that they would
be required to lend this money out immediately (probably to all of the other
participating banks).

Once this is achieved, future lending criteria terms (to meet some minimum
Federal over sight standard) need to be tightened up so ALL new loans meet AAA
rating guidelines.

I believe Paulson in his news conference Friday hinted that this was something
he could do quickly and was within the jurisdiction of his oversight powers.
There are however some congressional representatives saying that Paulson does
not have this authority and any such action may be subject to a Federal Court
injunction.

It could get ugly if some of the Congressional representatives disdain this

MGA was a very nice forced liquidation a week ago. Went lower in the carnage
but the valuation and balance sheet are very favorable for perhaps the best
company in the auto parts industry (I know, yuck). I'm not sure the last time
I've seen a cheaper valuation on a mid-cap stock. Half the market cap is cash
and it is trading at an extremely low enterprise value/sales and last we know
was still making good money.

With the problems in the auto industry, this is the one supplier I know of who
can (and does) build whole cars. And not Yugos. They build the BMW X3 for
example. The industry may go more and more in that direction.

Unlike CHK, this was not the CEO selling, this was a Russian who took a 20%
ownership position in the company last year and got a huge margin call which
took the stock to 38. In my view his ownership was a negative, so ironically,
the stock is MORE attractive to me with him gone.

a ex-colleague told me decades ago that he learned from bitter experience not
to buy stocks on margin. times like this bring that lesson home yet again.
interactive brokers recently announced that on small cap stocks they were
moving from 50% buyin margin and 25% maintenance to 100% margin requirement.
that no doubt contributed to the free fall. It must be a pretty bad feeling for
a billionaire ceo to get margin calls even though he's still got more than
enough to live on. I expect we will see a lot of personal bankruptcies and
credit card defaults now as these margin calls play out in ordinary peoples
lives. People postpone the inevitable by stopping to pay mortgages and taking
out all the credit card debt they possibly can. One can now obtain multiyear
free financing on consumer goods like tv-s and computers. I expect we will see

The market crashed. I never got a margin call, but my portfolio was beaten up
and being saddled with that margin debt was incredibly stressful. It was not
something I could really pay down from my monthly graduate student stipend.

Since then I have only been on margin once, for a few days at most, for less

"the Company intends to repurchase at least $5.3 billion of its shares, subject
to market conditions. This represents an increase of at least $1 billion from
its previously announced intention to spend $4.3 billion in share repurchases
in 2008. As of the end of the second quarter, the Company spent $2.9 billion
repurchasing its shares in 2008"

Speaking of cheap, GU has two dollars in cash and trades at 3.27. EBIDTA to
Enterprise value is 2. The company has no debt and distributes a dividend. The
biodiesel company has a dominant position in China. So who is drinking the
Kool-Aid here?

Just for reference GU NCAV is about $160M, the company is trading at $272M
market cap according to Yahoo. I am not saying that it will drop to NCAV, but
it's not as cheap as some other Chinese companies.

Since I still have no clue how biodiesel will work going forward, I'll probably
skip. I have too many oil stocks that will do great if oil goes up anyway. If
oil goes down, I am not sure biodiesel will be a place to be...

The interesting part is that oil is heavily subsidized in China (sold at ~$45
per barrel, I think?). I wonder if GU was making money at the subsidized prices
or if they are getting some kind of kick back subsidies. No time to check now

Hi Gcrispin - Do you know if they sell and report their earnings in "yuan" and
then convert to $US. My interest is not only in a profitable company that pays
a decent dividend but as a kicker I believe the "yuan" will stay strong vs the
$US.

With all these $US used to stimulate the world economy, I am concerned that
U.S. inflation may begin to rise in three to five years.

A Chinese company that generates their sales and profits in their local
currency and then converts it to $US, would be an excellent currency play
(hedge) against a falling $US.

They do not export biodiesel, so all costs and income are in yuan. They report
in US dollars but have the following explanation in their most recent earnings
release.

Currency Convenience Translation

The conversion of Renminbi into U.S. dollars in this earnings release, made
solely for the purpose of reader's convenience, is based on the noon buying
rate in New York City for cable transfers of Renminbi as certified for customs
purpose by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as of June 30, 2008, which was
RMB 6.8591 to US$1.00. No representation is intended to imply that the Renminbi
amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into U.S.
dollars at such rate, or at any other rate. The percentages stated in this
earnings release are calculated based on Renminbi.

Hope that answers your question.

Let's just say I like their balance sheets.:)

What I look for in a Chinese company is one that has a competitive advantage.
GU is the largest biodiesel company in China that operates with favorable gov.
policies. (Slide 7 and Slide 18 in the PDF file that I previously posted, in
case you are interested.) I'm not crazy about small pharmaceutical companies in
China because of quality control issues and because I don't think the gov.
really has health care as a high priority. (After all, the government runs the
tobacco monopoly.)

ina+tobacco%3A+A+tough+habit+to+break&channelid=4&categoryid=30

The other companies may or may not have competitive advantages that will help
them grow. My quick take is that semiconductor and electronics sectors will be
highly competitive.

CHNG is also a stock that I think will benefit from favorable gov. policies as
described in their latest PR. It is one I own at higher prices.

What market does or does not believe, does not matter. If we do not have our

Expecting that market will agree with you as a value investor is, sorry to say,
a folly. If it did, the stock would not be at value price.

BTW, to be clear, I am not arguing against having 60% or any other percentage
of cash. I am just arguing that if there are values, one buys them. Holding
cash is for times when there are no values. (And BTW one could make the case
that "there are no values now, since companies will report losses for 10 years

Actual earnings could of course drop significantly from estimates. There may

it's stock market losses that will continue, my view is that we're pretty close
to having all who wanted to sell selling, and all who are standing by and
waiting, they are doing that too.

For me, I'd rather put my money into a variety of dividend/distribution paying

I have my eye on several companies but am waiting for oil to hit the

can lock in some good Canadian Oil Trusts.

My fear is that Obama will implement a U.S. windfall oil tax so I want to be
loaded up with non-us oil and gas producers. There is some speculation that the
new conservative Canadian politicians will re-evaluate their position on oil
trust taxes.

Hopefully our previous low will hold but I am seeing this sell off widen to the
tech stocks. Several of these companies are lower today than they were on
Friday.

I will nibble at a bit more PBR if it sees $24 again. Some of the conglomerates
that I am watching could fall more so I will hold off for now. I would like to
pick up DD below $30 but it's tempting at current levels especially with a 4.4%
dividend. One interesting measure I am using to pick value here are those solid
conglomerates that have a history of consistent dividend payments that yield
over 5% seem to be screaming buys. Many of their dividends are now in the 4%
area now.

Option expiration may also be playing into this volatility. Friday is the

I wonder if high yield bonds and preferreds are the way to go. I hold some of
them (preferreds mentioned by you mostly, bonds: GNW, AIG). If these companies
don't go BK, one can get pretty guaranteed 20% yield to maturity. Which is
great return in uncertain times.

The problems with this approach are:
- Stock market at huge discount, which is usually followed by value investor
returns in 30-50% range in a year or two.
- The tough to quantify risk of defaults (or dividend cuts for preferreds) and
what you get if company defaults.

I wonder what you and others think on the following alternative: to buy stocks
now or to buy bonds/preferreds with 20'ish yield now? Just for sake of

Fwiw, as implied earlier today to E_K_S, I am adding more to ULTR. I mention it
now because it is going to have barges/push boats in Brazil to move ag products
like soybeans.

River transport is about 40% of ULTR's revenue.

I'll repeat a blurb from their website:

"UABL is the largest owner and operator of river barges and pushboats that
transport dry bulk and liquid cargos through the Hidrovia Region of South
America, a large area with growing agricultural, forest and mineral related
exports. This region is crossed by navigable rivers that flow through
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay to ports serviced by ocean
export vessels. We believe that this river system offers the most efficient
means of transportation for bulk cargos through the Hidrovia Region. At over
2,200 miles in length, the Hidrovia Region is comparable to 1the Mississippi
River in the United States and produces and exports a significant and growing
amount of agricultural products. For example, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and
Bolivia produced, in the aggregate, 39.9 million tons of soybeans during the
1995 / 1996 season compared to 115.4 million tons during the 2007 / 2008
season, a compound annual growth rate of 9.3%. Production for the 2008 / 2009
for these countries is estimated at 120.9 million tons, which accounts for
approximately 51% of world total soybean production estimates. In addition to
agricultural products, companies in the Hidrovia Region are expanding and
initiating the production of other goods, including forest products, iron ore."

since more people than ever have stocks (retirement plans) and can exit funds

If the fear is well-placed, and we are indeed going to have one heck of

I am looking to add to my Canadian oil Trusts on any significant move lower in
