I think interactive and ameritrade are both good for canadian stocks.
ameritrade is cheaper but way more annoying to deal with, as i find myself
constantly computing figures in different currencies, checking to see why I
dont seem to be on the ask or bid, calling ameritrade to find out why, then a
couple of minutes later i frequently get an execution, and I never know whether
the reports are running late, or the price shifted and I was screwed on the

What I would like to know is whether you have purchased some CFC.
I think that you are wrong in your characterization of these events as being
bullish. The CEO of CFC exhibits all the integrity of a captain preparing his
own personal lifeboat, while acknowledging that the hole in his ship might be
getting bigger.
To be blunt, I think there is a case to be made that CFC management downplayed
the problems facing them in order to enable the ceo to sell stock, while
obtaining more financing from other sources. The stock is heading south again,
the chances are excellent that the CEO will be the target of an SEC
investigation, and when that happens I wonder if accounting irregularities will
be far behind.
Their business has now clearly changed. When I check rates in my area CFC seems
higher than most so I wonder what types of credit they are now underwriting.
For the first time i notice their ads on TV. My guess is now they have to
compete for a different type of business and the jury is out as to how well
they will succeed. anyone can write loans to be sold to the likes of fanniemae.
are they the low cost provider? Anecdotally, my father in law tells me that his
house in Arizona has been on the market for some time and the value has fallen
$100K. However, he says it doesnt really matter to him because everytime he
drops the price on his house, he just drops the price on his offer for the
house he is purchasing contingent upon his house being sold. Sounds like a
vicious cycle which cant be warming the hearts of soon to be
undercollateralized lenders, not to mention owner investors.

Thank God I didn't invest in SUI five years ago! Actually, if you look at the
ten year financial data listed with Morningstar, it shows that the company was
consistently profitable from 1996-2003 earning around 185 million in net income
during that time period. As you correctly pointed out, the company has lost
money starting in 2004 to the tune of 70 million.

Looking at a price to FF0 ratio, SUI appears quite reasonable. My combined
purchases average about 26.70 a share which is around a ten price to FFO ratio
which looks very reasonable in comparison to 17 times for REITs overall,
according to data provided by BMO Capital Markets.

Regardless of what time period you select, I am basing my investment on a turn
in operating performance. Unfortunately, the company doesn't archive CCs, but I
was impressed that Gary Shiffman, the CEO, explained that the company's decline
resulted in sub-prime financing that allowed borrowers to buy a 170,000 dollar
starter house for no money down. In his words, he said the company got its @@@
kicked by sub-prime financing. What SUI is currently offering is a $70,000 MH
with cathedral ceilings, but no basement. I think his suggestion about the
company's troubles being due to sub-prime financing is somewhat corroborated by
looking at the ten year financial record, and I'm willing to collect dividends
that are covered by the FFO while watching to see if the company's financials
improve.

Yes, I have a position on CFC at a cost of $17+ per share.

In my opinion, what you have pointed out are all known factors, and the market
price has discounted these uncertainties. I am a contrarian investor, and I

Trend in US Foreclosures

The Associated Press reports: Foreclosure filings across the U.S. nearly
doubled last month compared with September 2006, as financially strapped
homeowners already behind on mortgage payments defaulted on their loans or came
closer to losing their homes to foreclosure, a real estate information company
said Thursday.

A total of 223,538 foreclosure filings were reported in September, up from
112,210 in the same month a year ago, according to Irvine-based RealtyTrac Inc.

The number of filings in September was down 8 percent from August's 243,947,
the firm said.

Despite the sequential decline, the September figure represents the
second-highest total for filings in a single month since the company began
tracking monthly filings two years ago....

In all, 39 states saw a decline in foreclosure filings, the firm said. 

Sharga noted that there was a spike in the number of bank repossessions in
August that did not occur in September.

The foreclosure rate for the nation in September was one foreclosure filing for
every 557 households, the firm said.

The U.S. housing market has seen sales decline and home prices fall or remain
flat, making it harder for homeowners who can't afford to make mortgage
payments to sell their homes or seek refinancing.

Many of those troubled homeowners were among those who took on adjustable-rate
mortgages that are now adjusting to a higher interest rate, translating into
payments they cannot afford to make.

The rising delinquencies and foreclosures this year have led the mortgage
industry to tighten lending standards, further narrowing options for homeowners
struggling to pay their mortgage.

Nevada, Florida and California had the highest foreclosure rates in the country
last month, the firm said...

Jurgis, re EXPN.L EXPGY how did you come up with ther 20% ROE number?

Experian does not follow US GAAP as far as i can tell,since the subtract
goodwill depreciation and amortization expenses from earnings. US GAAP does not
allow this any more unless goodwill is impaired. if you add above expenses
back, they do roughly 30p or 60c/share, which is a ROE of 30%. I do not do
valuation based on ROE anyways. For me the value proposition is as follow:

Organic growth rate:
High single digits (assume 7%)
Dividend yield 3%
Growth rate via acquisitions (funded from FCF): 3%
=Total return expectation of 13%/ year.

This is far better than market average. The above numbers are achievable, in
the past Experian has shown higher growth rates. The fact that they are a
spinoff is positive (IMO) as most spinoffs tend to energize management.

"How did you come up with ther 20% ROE number?"

Directly from the annual report: 463/2107*100. Sure, you can take their
non-GAAP profit and get your number. But it's not only goodwill subtraction as
you claim. There are other "exceptional items" that are much bigger than
goodwill adjustment. It's your choice whether they should be counted.

In any case, I would not assume that Experian can produce more than 20% ROE
going forward. If they can, it's a nice boost, but conservatively I cannot
assume that.

Alberta Premier Questions Royalty Hike Proposal After Oilsands Firms Threaten
To Leave Province []
http://www.rttnews.com/forex/politicalnews.asp
10/12/2007 11:19:26 AM Canada's National Post reported on Friday that Alberta
Premier Ed Stelmach may reconsider a proposal to increase royalties and taxes
paid by oil sands operators. An Alberta government report released in
mid-September urged a boost in royalties by 20 percent or about C$2 billion a
year.

Oil sands operators have warned that that Alberta's proposed energy royalty
hike will force companies to cut thousands of jobs in the province. Alberta
stands to lose billions if the hike is approved, as Canadian Natural Resources
(CNQ.TO), Talisman Energy (TLM.TO) and EnCana (ECA.TO) have threatened to shift
investment elsewhere.

On Thursday, Builders Energy Services Trust (BET.UN.TO) announced that it will
be cutting its October distribution by 50 percent, citing dreary prospects for
the oilfield services industry should the hikes take effect.

===========================================================

It looks like the Premier may not increase the full royalty tax as earlier
proposed.

lifted from seeking alpha:

n Thursday's globeandmail.com, David Ebner wrote the following:

Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) and Syncrude Canada Ltd. have individual royalty deals
with the government of Alberta, which set the two oil sands giants apart from
the rest of the industry that operates under what's called a generic royalty
regime in the oil sands. Suncor and Syncrude, in fact, will likely pay far
lower royalties starting in 2009, regardless of how much Alberta decides to
hike royalties in general.

...

Regardless, when 2009 arrives, Suncor and likely Syncrude will see their
royalty burden fall as they begin to pay on cheap bitumen rather than synthetic
oil. Suncor had estimated that with oil at $50 (U.S.) a barrel, it would pay
about 8.5 per cent of its gross revenues as royalty in 2007-08, which could
fall as low as 5 per cent in 2009-2012. Syncrude hasn't yet officially decided
to make the switch.

While it is true that both companies can elect to move to a bitumen based
royalty, what is not clear is whether both companies would be required to make
restitution to the Alberta government for the royalty lost, inflated by the
long term bond rate, because past upgrader investments were allowed as part of
the cost base for royalty calculations.

The companies might be required to make a choice: You can choose either to
remain with the royalty based on the synthetic crude oil [SCO] as you currently
are, with all the benefits you derived from having the upgrader costs as part
of the cost base for royalty purposes, or to move to a bitumen based royalty
and pay back the royalty deductions, inflated at the long term bond rate, you
received from having the upgrader costs as part of the cost base for royalty
purposes. This choice, in effect, places the company on a SCO or bitumen based
royalty from day one, with several years to consider the option of bitumen or
SCO based royalty.

Put differently, I suspect the Alberta government might put a clawback
mechanism in place to recapture the earlier benefits of having upgrader costs
deductible. I will comment further on the SCO and bitumen royalty when I
provide my comments on the Alberta Royalty Review.

I had some musings that there has so much monetary inflation in the past couple
of years relative to real resources that it almost has to balance out in some
fashion and i expect natural resources and re stock to continue to move upward.
Some of the derivative numbers out there are scary. I cant see the euro going

http://www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/pdf/index/500factsheet.pdf

it looks like the energy weighting is up about 1% from the past 3 months from
around 10.8% to 11.68%; close to 1/3 of that is xom. I guess if it got over 15%
it might be cause for concern to me.

The problem is that at the current price of oil, many, if not most, energy
stocks look like good values. I have to wonder if there will be some sort of
final parabolic move upward in oil that will finally suck everyone into the
commodity and the commodity stocks. This is outside the realm of value
investing, per se.

The problem is that economists will claim that oil is cyclical and WILL go down
from here. Peak oilers will claim that "this time is different" and oil WILL
NOT go down and rather will go up parabolically. If economists are right, it
does not matter that "at the current price of oil, many, if not most, energy
stocks look like good values". This is always true at the top of the cycle:
companies look cheap, since market expects the earnings to drop drastically on
the down cycle.

Bill Miller, for example, is in the economist camp so far, but he is wavering.
He said something like if oil drops by the end of the year, economists are
right, if it hits new peak, then this time is different. :)

Buffett - who knows - but apparently he sold Petro China - but then Petro China
is hugely expensive now, much more than domestic majors.

I dont think that theres any question but that the costs of looking for oil are
rapidly increasing and that means that the economics of oil are changing. Not
only that but I think the governments of these countries, provinces are
recognizing that these are not unlimited resources so the impetus is on to to
derive as much governmental revenue as possible from each barrel- so I do
believe its different now. It will be interesting to see what the province of
alberta ends up doing. My guess is that they will exempt natural gas for the
time being but not the oil sands from the increased royalty.

I don't know alot about why analysts have a low forecast this quarter of 84
cents. I think that is the reason OSG sells so cheap in relation to its
tangible assets and other shippers. At least that's all I can figure. But they
still look like they should do well over $6 in earnings this year and next. I
held OSG a while back and had sold. I've been a buyer in this general area,
give or take a few points on each buy. Maybe she gets down a bit more and my
gut says 68 not out of the question, but I don't really know. Just seems cheap,
and has a very nice fleet, mostly petroleum product, but a small dry bulk fleet
as well. http://www.osg.com/osgf.asp

I didn't see anything in the last earnings report that really turned me off. A
little dilution with the recent sale of some stock, but nothing dramatic. They
are the 2nd largest publicly traded oil tanker company, and I think it will

The parts of MOT are greater the the whole according to Carl Icahn.

UPDATE 1-Icahn still thinks Motorola should be split up
6:48 PM ET 10/12/07

NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn said on Friday he
still thinks mobile handset maker Motorola Inc should be split up and that the
company's handheld business could be worth about $10 billion.

"We do talk with them periodically," he said in an interview on business news
television channel CNBC. "Motorola has great value. If you really split
Motorola up, which I still think should happen ... you're buying that handheld
business for only $10 billion, which is next to nothing."

Motorola's market capitalization is $43.5 billion based on its closing share
price of $19.13 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday and a share count of
2.29 billion at the end of June.

Its mobile devices generated almost half of its $8.7 billion second-quarter
revenue.

Icahn has made few public comments about Motorola after failing to win a seat
on the company's board in May. He lost his bid after a bitter proxy battle over
his attempts to change what he said were operational problems at Schaumburg,
Illinois- based Motorola.

Motorola has been losing market share to rivals amid criticism of its handset
business, which it said would not be profitable this year.

Earlier on Friday, Icahn said in a CNBC interview that he is glad Oracle Corp
made a $6.7 billion bid for BEA Systems Inc and sees Hewlett-Packard Co and
International Business Machines Corp as potential bidders.

Icahn also reported on Friday that, on Oct. 10, he exercised about 34.5 million
call options for BEA common stock.

Motorola shares rose 2 percent to $19.52 in extended trading on Friday from its
close of $19.13 earlier in the day. (Reporting by Sinead Carew and Robert
MacMillan)

My opinion is that the value proposition for these two companies has never been
explained here well enough to be convincing. Imo, BZP as a value is not
explained (at current price) anywhere else on SI now either, from what I see.
Lots of "I'm in; technicals show such and such; volume is x today; wow price is
y today; I'm cutting back; thanks so-and-so for the tip", etc. Nothing I see
about valuation.

I have a little BZP. I admit to just following the crowd. I've no idea what
fair value for this stock might be. I still have KHD. It's gone past fair
value. Imo, it's a play on design/construction of plants related to
cement/coal/minerals. A popular industry now, with stocks approaching, or at,
highs.

Doesn't bother me much if people are in or out -- or that I'm in (or out). Just
that, if these companies (BZP, KHD, MFCAF) are among somebody's top holdings
(and if that person has a decent size portfolio), it is crazy or gambling imo
to hold such large positions in these, when the value of these is not clear or
not discussed.

BZP -Ill acknowledge that Im no expert on what the value should be. Im in at
much lower prices, and Ive decided to stay in at these levels as there now
seems positive news, that they are finding oil and indications are that the the
field is large, and this is in addition to the gas that they have clearly found
and have deals for. I have also read the recent morgan keegan report, whose new
analyst couldnt wait to put an outperform rating on it.
I have sold a portion at lower levels and taken some profits though.

KHD - I cant tell you whether its ahead of itself or not but it does seem to be
in a growth area. MFCAF- I did do an analysis on it when I bought it and
reviewed the 12/31/06 financial statement provide lately and am very
comfortable with my current holdings, meaning I expect to hold on to this
position for awhile and ride its ups and downs at least until it lists
somewhere. I admit I am riding Michael Smith's coattails here. But he has put
assets into this company at a very reasonable price. Certainly investing in
consumer companies with a long track record is safer, but I cant help but feel
that the returns are smaller. BTW I posted my 8 best ideas on this thread on
4/26/07 included MFCAF among them and no one at the time or since expressed any
interest in it whatso ever. So there was never any discussion about its merits
one way or the other. Fact is people who have followed Mr. Smith over the

Okay, Madharry, I'll adjust my modis operandi. Instead of just passing on your
"best ideas" post because I could not ascertain the reasons why they might have
been a (value) buy for me, I'll just ask you.

Back then in April in, "Right now my best 8 ideas are: EDV.to CHK CNQ MFCAF
SSALF(assuming either buyout is not approved or approved at higher price),
PLG.to, Mog.to, SIL.",

why are dink companies PLG, MOG in that list? They have no earnings, and
historical information (p/bk, p/sales) are not quickly found (by me, anyway). I
find no obvious reason why I ought to consider these stocks as buy from the
post or a brief scan. Why, of all the stocks in the universe, are these two
companies anywhere near "best ideas" and/or appropriate for a value investor?

I presume your "best idea" were stocks that you were actually buying or have
bought. (No insult intended; just want to confirm. We do have some people
around here who sometimes give out stock ideas/recommendations, but don't
always back them up by putting any skin in the game.)

Is there a correlation between your best stock ideas and their subsequent stock
performance? That is, do your best idea stocks do better than stocks that you
have that are not your best ideas? I ask this, because for me, my 'best ideas'
almost never turn out to be my best performers. For me I see not much
relationship between my best ideas and how these stocks will perform compared
to my less enthusiastic choices and their performance.
---------------------------------------
(As of today, I hold CHK, CNQ, SIL, EDVMF.
CHK, CNQ, I can understand (very superficially); EDVMF sorta, although it's
much more a bet on you and that you got the analysis right - which, as of today
anyway, seems to be the case -g-)

ok. first of all I'm not necessarily a value investor as defined by cash flow.
To some extent I accept values that other people are willing to pay for
securities at a given time.
I dont know what wynn and mpel are really worth but I do know that aruze and
melco are selling at good discounts to them and I do like the macao casino
space as a china play. In the case of plg.to, They were investors/speculators
that were willing to fund DGC at a particular price. Hunter-DIckinson wanted to
take on this project, there was a resource estimate. I had been impressed with
the ceo of PLg.to and found her to be creditable. The ceo felt that the dgc
mine would be feasible at $450 gold, since I expect gold to exceed $1000 it was
a case in my opinion of little to lose and more to gain as you had and still
have a company whose stock is selling at a discount to equity that they own and
they have other potentially highly lucrative assets in ghana. Those are
situations i like to invest/speculate in. Mog.to is a flat out speculation. You
are right- there may turn out to be nothing there. but once again I liked the
connections. I like the business which if they can grab market share will turn
out to be a great one to be in. I felt it was a very large return to risk
situation and I still feel that way though it may take years to come to
fruition. These were my best ideas and hence my largest positions at the time.
are my best ideas my most profitable ones? of course not, but if i can make 16%
a year I'm a happy camper. Far and away my best idea has turned out to be AAPL
which i bought at close to book, sold within 3 months for a nice profit, since
I didnt know what it was really worth, and have watched it go up about 12 times
since then.

I Still own all of these ideas except for SSALF which was taken under by KHD
and CNQ, which I sold for technical reasons ( I never know when to sell so im
trying that as a strategy now). EDVMF I am increasingly wary of due as I think
shareholders are getting increasingly taken advantage of by management, I
reduced my position significantly and may continue to do so unless there is
more frequent disclosure. edvmf was a technical sell in july now its a
technical buy, but its a hold for me.

All in all I would describe myself as a lose a little, make a lot
investor/speculator, with more of an interest in management , assets and future
potential positives than existing numbers and current cash flow so my stocks
dont lend themselves to spread sheet analysis very well. For example I own BWEL
even though I have never seen a financial statement.

One of the issues with exploration plays in the oil and gas field IMO is you
can't really explain the value proposition on them like you would with
traditional value stocks. The value is based on hoped for drilling results to
prove up reserves and xxx bopd (which then can be projected to assign a value
to the company). So you can't really look for the traditional value proposition
on these companies that live or die by the drillbit. That said, I believe there
is a spot in everyone's portfolio for some speculative "value" plays like these
because if one gets in early, and the exploration results and flowing bopd are
proved up, the rewards can be great. I use the word "value" here to note that
these companies, while not explained by traditional value propositions can
indeed still be value stocks (albeit speculative ones) measured from a
different perspective. But I wouldn't hang my hat on one company. Rather a
basket is what I prefer because for every so-so performer, if I can find
another Oilexco or Heritage Oil, I am very happy.

As to BZP specifically, Ed A (who is very knowledgeable on micro-cap E&P plays)

Upping my few shares of insurer ORI as it falls.

Very good history of annual dividend increases. (3.3% div. yield now)

Apparently 1999 was a bad year for ORI, and the stock sold for a p/b of .76
average. '02 might not have been a good year either, because the stock sold at
an average p/bk of 1.07. Every other year in the past ten, the stock has sold
at a p/bk about 1.2-1.5. Now the p/bk is again under 1.0. (about .95 according

I'll bet the company/stock will recover and again sell for 1.2x book within the

INTC became one of the ones where, when three people on the thread like it and
say they are buying, that is a signal the stock may really be a value buy.
Possibly because we all seem to approach value investing differently and have
different ideas about value, so when ideas converge, the particular stock is
maybe undervalued on a number of different measures. (I did a small study of
the stock performance results of 2,3,4,5 buyers of the same stock here a few

ORI. As far as I can determine, ORI has not commented yet on their
subprime/alt-a exposure. ORI consciously tries to diversify risk (they say), so
I'm guessing and betting exposure is not significant to the balance sheet.

Although ORI is primarily a p&c insurer,

ORI has a title insurance operation. That's not good given the housing
slowdown.

ORI has a mortgage insurance operation. It "insures loans for the purchase or
refinancing of homes when the amount borrowed exceeds 80% of the property's
value." These days, that sounds pretty dangerous. I don't find info. though
that's clear on the scope of the insurance operation (One chart on their
website seems to indicate about 13 percent of premiums written.), or the terms
and conditions of their insurance. For example, are they insuring the principal
amount; or are they insuring the payments, and if payments - for how long; are
they off-loading anything to reinsurers, etc.?

doubt .60 though, if company made .15 for first half.

With the Chinese market the way it's running now, stock could be a mover too.
An interesting trade on the company's potential. On a current value basis, I'm
not so sure. Jmo.

I looked up ORI's latest results since they sounded familiar from days gone by.
I stopped looking when I read this:

"Greater year-over-year claim costs in the Company's Mortgage Guaranty line,
and an increased operating expense ratio in Title Insurance, however, were
major offsetting factors. As a result of these varying business developments,
net operating earnings per share dropped by 13.5 percent in this year's second
quarter, compared to a year ago, while net income per share declined by a
lesser 9.3 percent due to higher realized investment gains."

Increased losses due to mortgage guaranty losses plus higher title insurance
expenses is not a good combination in the current housing market.

ORI. Okay, I'll expect another dismal quarterly report then next week. I'll
keep my position very small, and space my small adds further apart, assuming
the stock might drop another few points.

12-18 months this will be behind the company, and the company will again sell
at historical bv numbers. Or so I am hoping and betting.

The company does not provide the news release through the common channels, but
it has a very informative release on the web site http://www.vcp.com.br . It's
a plus to the company. :)

I like what I see on the release except for cash flows. Operating cash flows
are really low.

I am also unsure about the macro outlook for pulp/paper. This may be neutral to
negative.

I think I will hold my shares, since I have only a small position and I still
think the company is somewhat cheap. But I would not suggest buying at this
price.

OSG looks really cheap on P/Book and even on ROE or P/E. Unfortunately it has
been always valued at very low PEs. And the negative thesis in all research
reports is that the shipping does not depend on oil price, but rather on the
volume of oil. Which - if you agree with peak oil - will not rise, while the
overall tanker fleet is expected to grow at least for the next year.

In all, unlike oil industry where I think "this time is different", in oil
shipping industry I think "this time is not different" and we are on the top of
the cycle. Unless someone suggests how and where OSG can profitably deploy its
overcapacity of ships, I would be reluctant to buy it here. It does look
interesting and cheap though. ;)

Pulled the plug on TMA today. Too much pain, plus there will be no dividend for
at least the next quarter, and I owned it in income oriented accounts. It
is/was a very good company with a sound business model, but got caught up in a
perfect storm, a lot of which was not of its making.

On a positive note, I think the action in MOT is encouraging.

Water stocks. Sometimes referred to as the next commodity play.
Who knows?

Stocks mostly look expensive to me.

Cutting back a little now of CWT:

Been out of CWCO. Expensive, but could still be a buy though given its good
results (better than CWT now) and monopoly position.

Fwiw, holding shares in these:

Thanks for looking at it Paul.
I was looking at ttm eps on Yahoo and Investor Village (which lists .77/share
for ttm). I think those numbers aren't taking dilution into account.

However, the SEC filing shows .15 (fully diluted) for first half of 2007...so
it's got a PE closer to 10 here, assuming they remain their recent growth
curve.

But what I also noticed in last Qs filing is their current ratio.

It looks to be about 40 (not 4.0, but 40).

Total current assets 21,444,729

Total liabilities 533,246

http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/fetchFilingFrameset.aspx?dcn=0001144204-07-
42616&Type=HTML

Not sure if their numbers in the filing are accurate- if they are, wouldn't
that make this a very healthy company financially?

Ahh these Chinese medicine companies. It's really difficult to separate wheat
from chaff there. IMO, most of Chinese traditional medicines are not proven,
possibly not effective, and obviously not certified. Which does not mean that
people won't buy them, especially in China or the rest of the Asian countries.
People even buy them here in USA, I know, I did. ;) If they have connections,
the government agencies will not close them either. So it's like the "dietary
supplement" companies in USA minus the lawsuits and liabilities... until they
forget to pay the bribe somewhere. ;) There are also tons of them, most not
publicly listed. How big and competitive they are? Who knows. You have to get
into China to know.

AOB is one of the celebrated Bruwin picks. CHME may be as successful. Or not.
If AOB or someone else has bigger and better connections, they can shut off
CHME.

IMHO you really have to know the situation in China to invest in this one. Or
in AOB. :/

Agreed- a lot of China Pharmas popping up out there.

But CHME.OB appears to be worth a look due to the government's support of their
new product development:

"These selected six projects will receive financial and other support from the
provincial and local government in order to assist in the rapid
commercialization of the technologies."

Mr. Shenshan Yang, CEO of China Medicine stated, "Our ADTZ project has made
tremendous progress and we believe that the financial and political support of
the government will expedite commercialization of the product. We look forward
to working closely with the government and a successful product launch."

I have a small position in it that I started today. I appreciate pros and cons
on what others see as I'm considering adding significantly to what I bought
today.

I hope I'm not taken as a pumper! I do get a bit enthusiastic when i post about
what I believe is an undervalued stock.

The probe into Mr Mozilo is part of a broader look by the SEC at stock sales

OT/Congrats Paul.

I only recently stumbled across this thread and have already gotten some good
ideas and info from it.

I wish I had found it sooner- looks like a good number of smart investors
posting here.

Thank you for moderating!
