Maybe it is time again for CAH. I bought once as part of a package, CAH, ABC,
MCK. (Have no shares currently.) Now though CAH looks the better bet of the
three based on p/sales ratio, which I have used to determine buy points for
these businesses. However, there's been a change to some or all of them with
their business models --- something about not being so able to use the tactic
of buying phama drugs in large quantities when big pharma had price reductions,
and then stockpiling the drugs for later disbursement to hospitals. Big pharma
apparently has stopped this tactic of managing earnings, and hospitals have got
bigger and have been or are, trying to deal direct with pharma co's. Meanwhile
the distributors have set up or are strengthening their other businesses or
selling them. Result is I'm not so sure using p/sales as a clue for a buy point
is still a good bet. Still, CAH with a psr of .23 now, that is unusually low.

I will look to re-enter.

My issue with an ETF like Vanguard's VTV is that it might work out okay, but my
already being in some -- many -- of the stocks it has, I have purchased many of
them at lower prices than currently, and I really prefer to add more shares or
pick more selections when the individual stocks drop. For example, XOM, which
is 6.5% of VTV, I am buying now. (Sold position past couple of weeks, and have
begun to slowly re-enter, if stock will continue to fall.) I just feel that
with something like VTF, if somebody buys, they have to take the good with the
bad at the time they buy VTV shares. You may say, "I am pretty glad i don't own
C any more." Yet you may STILL own it with VTV.
Of course -g-, it's not so clear exactly what will be good and what will be bad
going forward. C a winner maybe. XOM a loser. Who knows? That's why there's
diversification.

you are correct with VTV. I bought my initial position in IVE simply because I
had buying paralysis in August (stocks were dropping so fast that i found it
impossible to buy, so i used IVE as a proxy). VTV is just an equivalent vehicle
)to IVE) and i did the exchange simpoly for tax loss purposes. Eventually i
will sell pieces of VTV to buy individual stocks. you are correct that VTV also
contains stocks that i decided to sell, but of course my exposure is fairly
small relative to owning the individual stock.

Looks like you were correct on your assessment of HTE and after alot of debate
with myself, I decided to take an 11% hit on my position. Dividends are fine
and dandy, but when they continue to come at the expense of capital they do us
absolutely no good. The market doesn't appear to be in the mood for gambling
that this latest round of dividend cuts won't be followed by more bad news,
particularly with the rumblings from the canadian Government demanding higher

Asset managers: It's been a disappointing year for me with almost all the asset
managers shares I'm holding. Still, my intent is to hold my shares --- WPL, LM,
DHIL, GROW, CNS, others.

As I see it, on the one hand, as people exit the stock market if/as their
stocks drop, then the assets under management and consequent fees and earnings
of the asset companies drop. And if people turn from equity funds to bond funds
or just stay with bond funds, bond funds are far less profitable for the fund
companies. OTOH, I presume contributions to IRAs are increasing, lots of people
are still working, and more people are retiring... these may be positives. If
stock prices of these aum companies get low enough, I suspect we will see more
consolidation in the industry. This has been an industry where growth through
acquisitions has been prevalent.

All jmo. I could be wrong.

On an up day, I'll mention some of my cigar-butt losers. Somewhat surprised
I've only held a very few that this year have slipped into bankruptcy. Either
I've given up when they hit the dollar mark or so, or else there just haven't
been that many entering bk this year. Which is unusual for me.

In penny stocks, I have given up on POGI (about a nickel to less than a penny)
and GSHF (about .34 down to about .03). I had hopes for this conglomeration
(GSHF)that deals with "biocorn oil extraction systems, the sales of biodiesel
equipment, the financing, construction and operation of our co-located corn oil
biodiesel production facilities". I am considering re-entering.

CWCO. This one is somewhat easier to evaluate than PICO. Pretty normal balance
sheet, normal operations. The problem though is that the company is earning
pretty low ROE. And this does not seem to be changing. Also the growth has been
big in 2005-to-2006, but that was the only year big growth occurred. This year
Q2Q growth is pretty non-existent. Returns are still low too, while P/E and P/S
are pretty high both in absolute and in historical terms. So even if I want to
like this company, I think buying right now would be totally macro buy on the
water problem/future, so I will skip.

PICO. I looked at it again. And I really don't want to dig into this company...
The sales and earnings are irregular. You really have to look into its land and
water holdings and assign prices onto them. It might have been an easy buy when
Clyde bought it at $150M market cap. Now it is at $740M market cap, which
changes things dramatically. On one hand, PICO has increased net tangible
assets (= equity) by 30% since 2006 with similar increases in 2006 and 2005. On
the other hand, most of the gain comes from selling its own stock at 2.6M
shares per year. The company is doing yet another stock placement that seems to
indicate that the management does not consider its own stock undervalued. I
wonder if they are planning to rebuy the Arizona or Nevada land that they sold
to developers at much lower prices than what they received for it. :) To finish
this rant, I think that PICO might be a value, but it is a very unconventional
company and I am not sure I want to be in it, since I am not sure its
management is shareholder friendly at all.

Jurgis -re seekingalpha. I am not sure i fully agree with the commentators
logic. For me the case is fairly simple. Citigroup needed a large chunk of
cash, quickly and 11% was the interest rate that they got somebody who had the
cash was interested.

Why did they need the money quick? I assume the ratings agency were grilling
them about the latest losses and threatening a credit rating downgrade. They
are AA now and don't deserve it - so i assume the rating agency told them to
come up with a 7B$ cash infusion to avoid an immediate downgrade.

Credit rating downgrades are toxic for financials because they raise the cost
of capital which goes directly toward the bottom line. And worse everyone will
assume that the first downgrade is not the last one. So C decided that paying
850M$ interest/year is cheaper than a credit downgrade.

I think the C's dividend will fall as well. The new management that is going to
be installed is not going to be worried about the promise to keep the dividend.
My best guess is that the dividend will fall to below 1$/share (0.8$/share
annually would be my guess) so they leave themselves upside once the worst of
the storm is over.

Have not picked a broker yet. Am considering Thinkorswim.

https://www.thinkorswim.com/tos/suiteFreedom/landing.tos

I haven't found any of the brokerage accounts I'm looking at to be exactly what
I'm looking for. Some are for the inexperienced or occasional stock buyer. With
these, for their "active traders", overall rates/fees/commissions are more than
what I pay now. I.e. for Schwab/Ameritrade,overall it's going to cost me more
than what I pay now. I can get overall costs to drop, but then again, I've got
to get myself up into their premium class, and I'm not so willing to just plop
that much money into an account. And since I buy a lot, but small amounts, I
figure it will take me some time to put cash to work.

These brokers that deal with the allegedly "experienced trader" -- like
Thinkorswim -- they are tailored to encourage and capture ACTION. Whether it's
buying or selling options, or turning and churning stock positions. I don't
like that, and it's not how I work.
I buy a lot -- stocks, but I don't have many sell orders. For example, I see
with XOM, I made about 15 buys as the stock moved up over over the past few
years, but only made three sells to close the position recently. With
Thinkorswim, they may be flexible in how they tailor their rates to what I'd
like. I've still got to contact them.

Have three active brokerage accounts currently, including my still substantial
account at Etrade. I have been satisfied with the support from Etrade's premium
service group, and intend to stick with them, but with not such a big account
as before.
----------------------
Fwiw, here are a couple of things I noticed in moving a relatively big chunk of
money out of stocks:

1. My large commercial bank put a hold on the check I rec'd from E-trade. They
say it's an out-of-state check, and they will release the funds in two stages:
A relative pittance so far released within a week or so of deposit ; the
majority being released this Monday. That's more than 10 business days after my
deposit. What happened to banking law changes when the holding was supposed to
be reduced? Seems like a ploy for the bank to get my money interest free. I may
visit them today to update my understanding of this.

2. Geez. I am going to be VERY surprised at what my 2007 USA tax bill is going
to be. Already I'm planning to use a lot of the cash I'm getting to bump up my
Jan. '07 payment by a lot of thousands. And this AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax)
thing. The complexity of it seems impossible to understand. My accountant and I
had some discussions about it in March for '06 amounts, and now ('07 income),
it's going to be worse and worrisome. A surprise.

Selling down and taking out cash is a good thing in the sense I will actually
get a little closer to finding out what my net worth actually is. I understand
I have had paper gains in this account over the past few years (lots of oil
stocks), and now have realized gains that incur tax consequences. So always,
when I look at my portfolio bottom line, I ought to mentally subtract something
to account for this event. It's just that it's hit me that when portfolios grow
over time, the tax consequences for this event are severe - the dollar amount
is very high-- it is an absolute large amount (to me/my lifestyle), and if I
was believing since gains are long-term, the tax rates would be maybe 15%, that
is very possibly incorrect. With AMT that rate shoots up. A likelihood for me,
given my other income and deductions (that are disallowed under AMT
calculations).

I'm apparently a lot less wealthy than I have believed. -g-

I count my blessings nonetheless. To have taxable gains is better than to have
losses.

A Wide Moat Gem - Fidelity National Finance

Another piece on FNF

Regardless of market conditions research continues. In times like these we are
ever updating our list of interesting stocks and preparing when the proverbial
“Fat Pitch” crosses our path. One stock of particular interest is Fidelity
National Finance (FNF). Fidelity is at the pinnacle of companies in the title
reinsurance field. It is one of top 5 with approximately a 28% share of the US
market. Title insurance is a very interesting type of insurance that is used in
almost all real estate transactions. I mean every, not just including
residential real estate, commercial estate but even including refinancing of
mortgages. Title insurance is the proverbial “Gatekeeper” or “Toll Collector”.
Fidelity National has fallen from its all time high of $28.62 to $14.61 as of
Friday with a P/E of 13.65 and yield of 8.21%. Many top value investors have
owned FNF in the past from David Einhorn of Greenlight, George Soros, Monish
Pabrai and Richard Pzena.

Title insurance is not the sexy Apple or Google but a mundane cash producing
cow. Title insurance guarantees the property owner as well as mortgage company
against liens and encumbrances to the title that are not known at the time of
closing. Most title defects are found before closing and resolved. However
sometimes these liens or encumbrances can fall into a short period of time
between title work and closing called a gap period. Most times if there is a
claim, it can be adjusted by a correction of the title. Large claims are very
rare and more further the risk is mitigated by reinsurance. On average
throughout the years approximately only 8% of the all premiums have incurred
losses for title insurance companies.

Fidelity further enhances its business by maintaining various pillars of
profit. They maintain a flood insurance processing division, home warranty
division, as well as a personal lines insurance company. In conjunction to this
Fidelity has partial ownership in several other entities.
1. 40% of Sedgwick which is a third party administrator for workmen’s
compensation claims. Fidelity owns approx
2. 70% of a timber company called Cascade.
3. 60% of FNRES an Internet real estate portal

There are numerous ways to come to come to a valuation. A tool we use is
comparing the earnings per share ($1.12) to the current rate of return for US
government bonds (4.52%). According to many analysts this gives the intrinsic
value. This showed the stock almost 50% undervalued. However this is not close
to exact and shows what the company is relative to the return of govt bonds.
This is another confirming idea, but Warren Buffet uses the formula of
discounting future earning discounted to present value. This too has
limitations but we confident that FNF is extremely undervalued. Even though
Fidelity is undervalued… the market is going through at a minimum a correction
and prudence is warranted.

Well I am not Paul, but I give high marks to Fidelity. I consolidated all my
accounts there about 20 months ago when Etrade was acquiring a couple of my
Harrisdirect (which had gone thru a series of aquisitions since I started the
accounts with Lombard) as well as my Waterhouse accounts (before they were due
to merge with Ameritrade), plus a couple smaller Etrade accounts I had.

Life has been much simpler with everything consolidated, and being able to look
at rollover IRA, taxable, 529, a non-qualifeid retirement account at my former
employer, even the corporate account at my current employer that I manage all
at once.

And their commissions I find to be competitive. Of course I do qualify for the
$8 commissions - which you can qualify for with either 120 trades or $1 million
in combined assets.

That said, you can get decent commission rates ($10.95) with either $50K in
assets, or $25k in assets and 36 annual trades. So you don't need to be a real
active trader to get lower rates.

Plus their customer service has been excellent - better than any broker I have
dealth with. And they provide some decent extras to (lots of independent
research available, invites to local seminars, conference calls with some of
their managers, etc if you are into that).

Dealing with pain of a few declining stocks, I'll trim some positions.

Cut losing position in LM just a little. LM - their business results - are a
big disappointment to me. And to others too, as reflected in LM's continuing

How or why Moody's with their Buffett-wonderful franchise could screw up their
business and reputation with these subprime/collateralized debts obligations or
whatever, may be a textbook case of greed/stupidity in action. I'll cut back my
MCO shares a little now -- too late maybe.

My few shares of clothing retailer ZQK - Quicksilver - are now again about
where they were when I bought them two years ago. That's enough of a hold and
wait for me. I've sold my shares today.

Gave up on one of my favorite truckers, HTLD, and sold stub position today.
Also sold stub ELRN; trimmed DOW a little; cut back on SYY because the stock
seems to have stalled; reduced CWT which even as a water stock seems expensive
to me at current price; closed recent pipeline purchase of SE; ended DCT. (I
may reassess this one. The div. on this reit is okay, not exceptional, and I'm
not sure how attractive this reit is.) I will take some ROG of the table at
this point.

I'm not happy with STZ. Doesn't seem like the business is doing that great.
It's got good brands, and the company is profitable in all the past years I
see. The roe isn't that great though. In my two-year holding of the stock, it's
about where I made my initial purchases. I'll cut back about 1/2 on this one
and deploy funds elsewhere.

The problem with any kind of deal-maker companies is that you really have to
trust the people making the deals. And whenever I compare them against the gold
standard: BRK and WSC, I am never quite sure why I should select them vs.
Warren and Charlie.

Sure, FNF is trading at book value right now, but if I got rid of goodwill and
intangibles, it is trading at 1.57 net tangibles (WSC is trading at 1.27 net
tangibles, BRKa is trading at 2.47 of net tangibles though). It might be cheap
if you really believe they are good investors. It also might be cheap if you
believe that their main business will recover soon.

It's funny how the guys in your article do not mention FNFs co-acquisition of
CEN that is quite big for FNF. Also, there is no explanation of the whole
co-acquisition structure that strikes me as a bit weird. Do I really want to

I could not understand what they were saying. Which struck me odd, because I
would've believed by now, I would've at least been exposed to how most analysis
is done. I've no clue how or why US government bonds can be compared to a
company's eps to come up with the company's intrinsic value. (Now if it were
the company's cost-of-capital that was in there somehow too, well maybe. I
don't know.) I've never heard of the "many analysts" who use US gov't bonds to
calculate intrinsic values of specific stocks. I know that there've been people
who compare bond rates to overall S&P earnings yield (and/or maybe S&P dividend
yields) to determine if the stock market (or specifically the particular S&P
index) is under or over valued. But US bonds used for specific stocks??

Got to be careful about Buffett using discounted cash flow analysis. I read
that Charlie Munger said he never saw Buffett actually calculating discounted
cash flow for a stock. It's possible, I am guessing, it's a more talking point
than an actual action (calculation) that these guys do when coming to a buy
decision on a particular stock.

Regardless, FNF could be a buy opportunity at current price. I don't know.

Yeah, I also buy country and sector funds. The positive side is that you don't

undervaluation or overvaluation, but with funds it's IMO pretty impossible. So
really with funds you can just go with macro decisions: is this a good fund? is
it in the good place macro-wise? And hold for long time...

I currently hold: IGE, IIF, ITB, one of the SP500 funds, TDF, XLF + OAKLX and
TAVFX (I don't really distinguish closed-end and open-end funds too much here.
:)). IMHO, ITB and perhaps XLF are in the buy area. IGE, IIF, SP500, TDF - I
have no clue. Same with the open end funds. Although TAVFX is IMO a buy all the
time. :)

Other interesting ones that I am looking at:
FXI - overpriced?, EWC - not sure if I want Canada or not, EWZ - overpriced? So
again, the problem really is to figure out when they are over/underpriced... :(

I'm leery of buying income funds though. I am very unsure how they get their
income and if it is sustainable at all. IMO, any income over 10% is not
sustainable - or there is a huge undiscovered opportunity that somehow other
managers have missed and I don't believe that. Let's look at it another way:
Marty Whitman would be happy if he got 10% annual return guaranteed for his
fund. So why doesn't he buy these >10% yielders if they are sustainable?
There's a counterpoint there though: Buffett has once bought treasuries (and
other bonds?) since he believed that they yielded too much, but then he
believed that yields will drop while bonds will go up and he believed that he
was getting the best deal in the market considering risk/reward. I doubt this
is the case with these guys, but there is a slim possibility that they are
"unjustly" too low.

I'm hoping the sustainability of the yields if they were to cease, would be
caused by people coming in to bid up the price of the funds, thus reducing
yields. I'm hoping for no drastic reductions in the div. yields from the
underlying stocks themselves or from the machinations of the fund managers with
their derivatives/other stuff.

Even with a package of these things, if there's a blowup of one though, it may
negate buying all of them. That is, consider having a package of 10, with 100K
invested in each and a 10% yield after fund fees on each. If the CEF stocks
didn't move and yield were sustainable, that's 10x10k = $100K paid on $1M. But
if even one blew up - say the distribution were cut in half, then that CEF
stock would likely -- imo -- be halved (or more) too. So the bettor would
getting $95K in yield (i.e. 100K minus $5k cut from the one CEF) and would also
have $50k in capital loss from that one CEF stock dropping. That results in an
overall $45K gain over the $1M bet. Which is only 4.5%. Not good.

NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Second Curve Capital LLC, the financial stocks
investment firm run by Thomas Brown, has lost nearly 50 percent of its value
this year as top holdings like First Marblehead (FMD.N: Quote, Profile,
Research) and CompuCredit (CCRT.O: Quote, Profile, Research) have slumped,
Brown said on Thursday.

But he said he is expecting a rebound in financial stocks in the next year or
so as companies write off losses from the subprime lending debacle and
investors pile back into the once-robust sector.

"I think we're really close, if not at the bottom, for the financial services
industry," Brown told hundreds of investors at the Value Investing Congress in
New York. "There are many opportunities in the most battered sectors."

Brown, who said he manages about $400 million in three funds, has seen his
fortunes rise and fall in recent years. His Second Curve Opportunity Fund
International, for instance, was up over 50 percent last year, according to
investors.

Despite this year's losses, he said that his investors appear to be mostly
sticking by him. He declined to give exact performance figures in an interview
after his speech.

Brown told Reuters that only 7 percent of his investors chose to put in
redemption requests for year-end 2007. He said his investor base does not
include hedge fund-of-funds, which are more likely to bail out of loss-making
hedge funds.

Brown, who maintains a Web site called Bankstocks.com, said his top stock picks
include First Marblehead Corp, which securitizes student loans for banks
including JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America, and CompuCredit, which
provides credit and related financial services. (Reporting by Dane Hamilton;

re LM - their headlines are much worse than their business results. Their last
earnings were up 24% YoY. While I agree that they could loose 200-300M$ with
their money market funds exposure to bad commercial paper it should not impact
the financial stability. LM does generate about 6$ in cash earnings, which is
an 8% earnings yield. No other asset manager is valued as attractively.

"No other asset manager is valued as attractively."

Ah, as they say of women, beauty --attractiveness-- is in the eye of the
beholder.

I don't know what your criteria are for valuing asset managers or how many
you've compared LM to. I have several in this sector, and I consider HBRF.ob as
one that's more attractive based on aum and maybe other criteria. More
attractive, but maybe not so desirable though because of its recent entrance
into this business, and its current obscurity (small size).

Repeating what I've said earlier, I generally value asset managers based on
market cap to aum. My bogey is 2%. Other people are currently using a higher
percentage (or were until the September stock market drop). I'm still going
with 2%. Some difficulty arises in that aum consists of both bonds and equity
funds, and equity funds are much more profitable and valuable to an asset
manager. Given that LM apparently has about $1 trillion or more aum, some
discounting factor has to be applied between the bond and equity portions (I'm
not going to attempt to actually separate out the totals of each LM fund)--
I'll just arbitrarily use about the aum figure I used when I made my first buy
-- about $.7 trillion, so that'd make fair value - imo the way I look at it,
about $14B (market cap) for the company. As of now, the market cap is $10.25B
(per Yahoo). So I'm looking for fair value of LM to be about (14/10.25) x
$76/sh. = $115-116/sh., very roughly.

The company has problems -- those facts and rumors about its difficulties with
its money market funds that use Structured Investment Vehicles. I've no idea if
losses are now contained, but I'll guess the fud (fear/uncertainty/doubt)
factor will at least for a while, stop LM from moving up closer to what I
consider its fair value. Bill Miller's problems and the media complaint that LM
is weak in foreign stocks (an area that's attracted investors' monies) are also
both negatives. As a result of all this, I'm comfortable with taking losses now
in selling a small portion of the shares I have, freeing up some cash, and
maybe upping the position again later.

ACAS -- This article (below) appears prominently in today's wall street
journal. Greenberg (the author) was notoriously involved in criticizing the
company in 2002 when some hedge funds shorted the stock and then bashed it in
the press. Jim Cramer (MSNBC now) was also involved. I don't remember the
particulars, but I remember that Cramer had a financial short interest in ACAS
through his or other hedge funds, and Greenberg was the mouthpiece. The stock
dropped from the low $30s to under $20 for awhile, while the company defended
itself and announced large insider purchases of shares. It was a great time to
buy the stock.

> "A lot of times when I was short, I would create a level of activity
beforehand that would drive the futures. . . . It's a fun game," Cramer said in
the Webcast, which was moderated by TheStreet.com Executive Editor Aaron Task.
A remarkably successful money manager when he ran the $450 million Cramer
Berkowitz hedge fund, Cramer in the Webcast shared his "tips" on how to drive a
stock price down so that a short-position - a bet that a stock price would drop
- remains profitable. He added that the strategy - while illegal - was safe
enough because, "the Securities and Exchange Commission never understands
this."

But today's criticism, which has been circulating for a few weeks, is more
rational than past illogical rantings and innuendo. There may be something not
quite right here, but with managements' track record, that is difficult for me
to believe. And ACAS has always surpassed the dividend guidance they gave at
the start of each year. The present dividend yield is 11% ($4.19/$37.60). Here
are clippings from the company, then the article:

> American Capital also announced a change to its dividend policy for net
long-term capital gains. Previously, the Company retained these gains
permanently by paying a 35% tax on behalf of its shareholders and treating the
gains as a deemed distribution to shareholders. American Capital will now treat
net long-term capital gains similarly to ordinary taxable income, making them
available for the payment of dividends to shareholders... As a result of this
policy change, American Capital will likely be required to distribute more cash
dividends than under the previous policy.
> "We have had an 11% compound annual growth rate of our annual dividend over
the past ten years, using our ordinary taxable income to fund this growth but
not our net long-term capital gains..." said Malon Wilkus, Chairman, President
and Chief Executive Officer of American Capital. "Our change in dividend policy
should allow us to increase the growth rate of our dividends and, equally
important, increase the amount of taxable income we retain for future
dividends... We are currently trading at a 10% yield of our annualized fourth
quarter 2007 declared dividend. If we were to trade at this same 10% annualized
dividend yield at the end of 2008, based on our fourth quarter 2008 dividend
guidance, we would produce a 23% total return for our shareholders, in line
with our 21% annual return over the past ten years."
> American Capital is forecasting total 2008 dividends of $4.19 per share to be
paid from ordinary taxable income and net long-term capital gains earned in
taxable years ending in 2007 and 2008. American Capital anticipates that its
2008 ordinary taxable income and net long-term capital gains will exceed its
dividends and it will retain the excess for future dividends... This represents
a 13% growth over the total 2007 dividends of $3.72 per share.

Dividend Darling American Capital
Changes Formula But Keeps Bravado
By HERB GREENBERG
December 1, 2007

When I think of the companies that have made me look the silliest, American
Capital Strategies Ltd. is high on the list.

The Maryland-based business-development company invests in and lends to mostly
small and midsize private companies that need cash or a partner in a buyout. It
likes to compare itself with a growth-and-income mutual fund. In 2002, when it
first hit my radar, its dividend yield, exceeding 10%, looked too good to be
true. Higher rewards, after all, are supposed to equal higher risks, as many
investors in the high-yielding subprime-mortgage space recently learned the
hard way.

The bearish argument, which I tended to favor at the time, claimed that
American Capital didn't really earn its dividend. It further suggested that
once Wall Street figured this out, it would stop refilling the company's cash
tank by readily buying its frequent secondary offerings.

American Capital said its critics were wrong, and started spotlighting its
history of rising dividends with the slogan, "You can't restate a dividend."
Investors agreed, flocking to American Capital's regular offerings as its
shares outstanding more than quadrupled on a stock price that since late 2002
has more than doubled. Its dividends have jumped 49% in the same time. (In
other words, I got it wrong.)

Why worry now? This time it isn't about whether the company earns its dividend,
which still yields more than 10%, but possible viability and volatility of that
dividend. And while not highlighting this as a possible problem -- not that any
company would -- American Capital unintentionally was first to draw attention
to it with an announcement several weeks ago of a changed "dividend policy."

A yellow flag pops up anytime a company makes any kind of change in something
it has always done. The color turns red if the company is viewed largely as a
dividend play and then changes the way the dividend is derived.

To understand the significance, you first need some background: Much like a
real-estate investment trust, business-development companies like American
Capital are required to pay out 90% of their taxable income in the form of a
dividend. The income comes from a variety of sources, including interest and
dividends from portfolio companies as well as the management fees they charge
those companies.

American Capital traditionally has paid dividends exclusively from income,
which in recent years has exceeded the amount of the payout. In the past, when
it sold a company at a gain, American Capital booked a profit but didn't use
the proceeds to pay the dividend. That makes sense because capital gains are
unpredictable and dividends need to be paid out every quarter. Now, the company
is adding these profits to the pool of money it uses to pay the dividend. Any
excess is banked, almost as a cookie jar, in case of a dividend-related
shortfall in the future.

More than the policy change itself, "it's the timing of the switch" that
concerns analyst Scott Valentin of Friedman Billings Ramsey, one of a number of
former American Capital fans who have grown increasingly cautious. According to
Mr. Valentin, who has a history of not pulling punches, the change "reflects
mounting pressure to maintain dividend growth" in the face of possibly slowing
net-operating-income growth.

Wachovia analyst Jim Shanahan goes so far as to say he is "skeptical as to the
sustainability of the dividend policy," especially if the company is expecting
to count more on capital gains when the market for selling companies mightn't
be as great as it had been.

But according to Chief Executive Malon Wilkus, his company's critics simply
don't get it. He felt the same way when I first talked to him several years
ago, except now he is far more emphatic. Not only does he believe the company's
dividend is safe, but he says it will be far easier for American Capital to
increase dividends, especially with the company able to charge more for loans
in the credit crunch's wake.

He adds that critics "are completely wasting their time" on
business-development companies "because by definition they are some of the
strongest publicly traded financials because by law they are limited to a
debt-to-equity ratio of 1 to 1." American Capital's, he points out, is even
lower than that. "We have...one of the strongest balance sheets anywhere in the
world of finance. As long as the balance sheet isn't levered," Mr. Wilkus says,
"it isn't hard to pay the dividend."

I can't stress how confident he is about how right he is. Critics say he is
overconfident. This is for sure: Both can't be right.

I increased my position in mcgc substantially after listening to their latest
presentation. Thanks Paul for bringing this one up. I am very impressed with
the speaker and the the presentation. they are giving guidance of dividends of
$1.76 for fiscal 2008, which equates to a yield of 16% at current mv. So this
looks like a no brainer for me. they mark their portfolio to market on a
quarterly basis, they have 3rd party review of their investments, as well as
audited statements. Currently i believe they sell at a discount to their
porfolio valuation of 9/30/07 of at least 20%.
They have very little housing exposure, and one recently poorly performing

According to etfconnect (a wonderful source of info for closed-ends, btw), NCV
uses 34% leverage and NCZ 37%. My guess is that a major reason for the high
yield (low price) of these ETFs is that they obtain this leverage via the carry

among investors, and maybe even signals a coming end to that form of leverage.

Hey Paul, do you still own CIT. Time to average down.

CIT in its last 10Q lists all its mortgages, with loan to value, docs , prime,
alt A , subprime etc. As the originator it knows it mortgages. CIT does not
expect huge defaults and has kept 9.5 bill of its mortgages which are good
loans primarily. The subprime stuff it sold. CIT's default rate in subprime is
10% and less then industry average which is about double that. At this point
keeping the mortgage loans was the smart move. It put them in a trust and is
servicing them. The beneficiary of the trust is Freddie Mac up to the 5 bill
loan Freddie Mac made to CIT with interest. Thus CIT liquified the portfolio
and as the mortgages pay off, Freddie Mac gets repaid and CIT gets the
remainder. A very smart workout. Don't expect anymore chargoffs in this area.

ROE is just incredible. Of course, sales are declining and so are income for
the 4th straight year. On the other hand, they are trading at low multiple and
they are still maintaining high ROE. I am not sure if it's a buy or not. :)

Agree with you, gcrispin, about the bottoming. Several of the reits I'm
following, and/or have shares of, that were yielding a decent 6%, dropped to
yield a good 8%, and have fallen further to yield a very attractive 10-11%. The
stocks continue their decent though, so perhaps we may soon expect a 11-12%
yield. Yikes. That will be some drop in stock prices. Some of these stocks HRP,
AHT, others are already at multi-year lows.

I don't have HRP. I intend to add to AHT if it drops a little bit lower (below
my latest purchase price).

Doubled my starter position in RAS. They seem to have stabilized at current
prices. The Trust yields 21.3% at current prices which is a good risk/reward at
current levels. The dividend will either be cut or the stock will move higher
as this yield probably can not be sustained. This is in my IRA account so I am
looking for a steady dividend payer. My position is still very small less than
1% of the portfolio.

The stock goes x-dividend on 12/19 so it will be interesting to see what the
announced payout will be.

Hi Grommit - Re. RAS - There were 21 insider buys totaling 315K shares since
August 1, 2007 at prices between $6-$8.90/share. Their 3rd quarter 2007
financial report highlighted these results:
http://www.raitft.com/invrel/index.asp?newsitem=5118759
<pre>Financial Summary

-- Economic book value of $13.27 per share at September 30, 2007

-- Tangible book value of $11.63 per share at September 30, 2007

-- Adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 for the quarter ended
September 30, 2007

-- GAAP total loss per share of $4.02 for the quarter ended
September 30, 2007
</pre>

My thought is when the Paulson recovery plan is announced Friday (Five-Year
Mortgage Rate Freeze Looms http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/071205/mortgage_crisis.html
Bush Mortgage Plan Will Freeze Certain Subprime Interest Rates for 5 Years) it
will reduce the fear (of defaults) on the street for these Subprime loans. In
fact it might allow the market to better value and price all SIVs products.

Most of RAS's paper is loaded on the commercial side not subject to possible
subprime defaults. However the market still has a problem valuing all SIVs,
many of those that RAS owns in their REIT. It is my opinion that this stock has
a significant discount built into the current price which represents (1)
overall portfolio mortgage "quality" and (2) "investor fear" of default.

My WAG to economic value is based on their most recent report (above) dated
11/05/07 at $13.00/share. I expect the dividend to be reduced to $0.20/share to
$0.30/share per quarter or yield between 6%-9% with a $13.00/share price
target.

Based on the current price level, the market seems to have built in a 30%
discount to fair economic value. This large discount shows that the market has
a different value perspective. So you may be right as to what their "real"
portfolio value is worth (or if it is even known).

Their dividend announcement for the fourth quarter comes up in two weeks
(12/19/07) so it should provide a bit more clarity as to what the true yield
is. No doubt a risk, but if their revenue streams continue from their basket of
mortgage backed securities AND the fear premium diminishes, this stock could go
back to $13 and yield 6%-9% for many years.

read the bloomberg release of the paulson plan. I guess if Im a subprime
borrower I would devote all my energy into getting my credit score below 660 so
look for mortgage delinquencies to really soar now. I suppose anyone with an
arm might want to try this strategy too, especially if they have little or no
money down. im guessing this is not good news for insurance companies. I also
wonder how legal it is for a government to come in and change the terms of a
legally binding contract years after it has been signed, and then qualify by an
arbitrary credit score. This should be a bonanza for the legal profession.

I have stated numerous times that I don't invest in financials because I don't
understand them. However, this might be a good time to get some of them. So can
you guys tell me:

- How do you value financial stocks? ROE seems to be rather useless in their
situation. Do you use ROA? ROIC? P/E? Any other metrics?
- How do you avoid blowups? Is it possible at all to figure out what toxic
stuff banks/financials hold? Or do you have to trust the management 100%? I
still remember Argentina crisis in 2002 (?) when a bunch of banks suffered. Now
we have subprime and CDOs. There will be something else in the future. Are they
avoidable and if so, how? If there is a list of "good" managers and banks, what
is it? Wells Fargo? Buy what Buffett buys?

I would be interested in any comments or explanations in this area. I am still
unsure if I want to get into it, but learning never hurts. :)

I suggest you separate the category "financial stocks" into components. For me,
I use different metrics for making evaluations about bank stocks, about
brokerage stocks, insurance stocks, asset managers, business development
companies, "financial reits", and so on.

For example, for insurance stocks I like p/bk and growth in bk. For banks I key
on roa vs p/e and p/bk. (There's something called "efficiency ratio" that pro
analysts like for comparing banks, but I generally don't use that one.) For
asset managers I like assets-under-management to market cap. For reits,
relative dividend yield and p/bk and d/e.
I just want to show here some of the differences and choices that I use. I
don't just use these measures exclusively. It's a combination of several
quantitative and sometimes judgmental guesses.

---
As I look through my holdings, at this time it seems I'm not able to avoid
blowups: I certainly have them with some of these financial stocks. I am hoping
and betting that time and diversification will mitigate how much they
ultimately affect the portfolios.

---
Yes, I have found it satisfactory to buy (financial) stocks that Warren Buffett
or surrogate have bought when their buys have been first reported by the media.
Especially if some of the stocks were then able to be bought at prices below
what Mr. Buffett/surrogate paid for them.

Jmo, and from my experience. Others will vary.

Just saw this on DFC- Not a good thing. Can't say I saw it coming either.
Managed to dodge a bullet on this one.

AN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Delta Financial Corp. said on Thursday that it
plans to file for bankruptcy protection, becoming the latest mortgage lender to
succumb to the subprime crisis that's swept the industry this year.
Delta shares slumped 89% to close at 19 cents. The stock changed hands for $10
at the beginning of 2007, before delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime
mortgages surged, triggering a global credit crisis.

hedge fund firm Angelo Gordon & Co., but that agreement depended on the company
selling roughly $500 million of loans on to other investors in a
securitization, or arranging other financing for the loans. See full story.
On Thursday, Delta said it couldn't complete the securitization. Warehouse
lenders, which provided short-term financing for Delta's loans before they're
securitized, have now told the company it has defaulted.
The deal with Angelo Gordon is now off and Delta said it will stop taking new
mortgage applications and file for bankruptcy protection from its creditors.
Delta offered mortgages to subprime, or less creditworthy, borrowers. However,
the company focused on fixed-rate loans, rather than more exotic
adjustable-rate products that have triggered many of the delinquencies and
foreclosures this year.
However, the company relies a lot on securitization -- packaging up and selling
off the home loans it's offered as mortgage-backed securities. But the
secondary mortgage market has been in turmoil since the summer, making that
process much more difficult.

Current dividend is .84 current price 5.35 (Both in Canadian currency..) hence
yield is 15.7%.

Tax consequence... foreign tax is withheld in your account but when you file
your US taxes are basically given a tax credit.

As for US tax on the yield as I remember it was partially treated as ROC but
mostly treated as qualified dividend income (ie 15% tax rate..)

SGTL. Not sure of the definition of net cash that's being used.

I see SGTL having cash and short-term investments of $74M or $2.06/sh. Yahoo
shows no long term debt. $32M in accounts payable, somewhat offset by $22M in
accounts receivable and $17M in inventory.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=SGTL

With stock at $2.04/sh., by my reckoning, with those cash and balance sheet
numbers, a buyer pays for the cash in the till and gets the business for free.
The issue is, is there a business there to be got? If they are losing money,
apparently not, or not yet.

SGTL did very okay when they were a supplier to Apple for Ipod or another
product. But in subsequent iterations of the product, they didn't get Apple's
business, which was significant business loss to SGTL. Hence the decline in
stock price.

I say SGTL's a buy if one buys these cash-rich cigar butts in a package of
these things. My opinion same for GNSS. Although -uh - I had the same opinion
too when both these were at higher prices than currently.

Foreign Tax Credit
A tax credit reduces your US tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and so
is generally more valuable than a deduction which reduces your taxable income.

Maximum Allowable Foreign Tax Credit

Your foreign tax credit cannot exceed your US tax liability multiplied by a
percentage. The percentage is your total foreign-source income divided by your
total worldwide income. You must figure the allowable amount by various
categories of income. Examples of income categories include investment income
and wages.
