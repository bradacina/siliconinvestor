BKH. Thanks. I appreciate your sharing your thorough dissection and analysis of
the company. I have held all my shares. They have only been few though.

Your post indicates a quandary some of us may have who've bought utility stocks
in early '09. And that is, that the stock prices have come up on most, if not
all of these stocks, and with that, the dividend yields have come down (even on
those that have raised their distribution). So what do we do now? While with
BKH the dividend yield was 8% at the time, with the stock price rise it's now
4.6%. The stock may (or may not)be an okay or good holding, but it's not so
attractive (imo) that if we go into another, second recession, the stock won't
drop down from levels that are now still near the high of the year. (BKH
trading roughly at $32 now, is closer to $34 hoy, than to $23, loy.) So I see
more risk to the stock now at its current price and current dividend yield.

I'm one who would consider harvesting BKH to fund new investments elsewhere.
Except as I said in an earlier post, I've just raised my cash holdings.

I'm using BKH as a general example. I face the same decision with several other
utility stocks. If I sell, the issues are: which to sell, how much to sell, and
what do I have as suitable replacements for these utility stocks.

Anyway, if/when BKH breaks to a new high on no positive news, I will consider
selling at least some shares.

Re: ROE on COV and MHS. Both have OK ROE recently. COV just does not have
enough history for me (and I assume loss in 2007 is just spinoff costs). MHS
had low ROE for most of its history only showing high ROE last two years

That is similar to a quandary I find myself in regarding my investment in
Vanguard GNMA fund. The price has appreciated so much that the yield has now
come down to 2.93%, far below the typical yield for this fund. While I
recognize that utility stocks are equities and GNMAs are bonds, the investment
purpose is not that far apart.

What do we do now, when the interest rates have dropped to very low levels? Do
you invest a percentage of your portfolio in fixed income investments?

My opinion is different. I am a BIG fan of ROE. For companies that show a
profit, ROE is usually the first metric I look at. Of course, I make
adjustments for the business (e.g. intellectual property companies with
relatively little hard assets might be expected to have high roe), and for debt
levels (which pump up the returns on equity).

I believe you prefer EV/ebitda or something with those metrics?
They of course are used by many professional value investors. (As is ROE by
some). To compare a company's history to itself, these numbers aren't generally
available, to my knowledge. Which either would mean some effort must be done to
dig out the historical EV and ebitda numbers -- and I'm not into extra effort
-- or else, perhaps it's not important to get and look at these numbers. If I
were to compare one company to a different company in a different business, or
one company to its industry averages, then EV/ebitda likely is the better
metric, I would say.

Reiterating my opinion, for readers of these posts, it's not about resolving
which method is better or best, it's that if we have people using different
methods and yet they still come to the same conclusion that a stock is a buy,
then that is a signal to the reader that he or she might want look closer at
the stock for a buy too.
============================================
One of the things I like about roe, is that for companies with a history, it's
easy to see how average yearly roe changes from year to year. So I can easily
see if a company has sustained its roe over many years. And since I can also
see if stated equity/sh (i.e. book value) is growing, I can make some
conclusions as to whether I proceed further with an analysis. If I find a
company that has high returns on its book value over many years, and if book
value increases over time (yearly increases are nice), then that is a company
and stock I want to look at.

Quest Diagnostics is a company that's increased book value every year for at
least the past ten. Returns on that bv have decreased from the 20%+ area in
'04-'06 time, to 16%-19% in more recent years. Meanwhile d/e has gone up a bit.
These are not trends I like to see. OTOH, the stock price has fallen too, and
the company does provide an important service -- possibly to see more demand as
population ages and seeks more medical procedures.

MHS sports an ROE at least as good as DGX's. MHS's book value has been moving
up over the past decade. However, in the past three years, it's really risen --
more than doubled -- and so has d/e. (Maybe there's an acquisition or or
business model change that accounts for this?). It comes down again to what the
investor is willing to pay for this kind of performance.

Here's where I am:
MHS: pass. Too expensive for me.
COV: hold (I have a stub position from '05). Too expensive. Maybe an add though
a few points lower.
BAX: pass. Nice numbers, but as discussed here earlier, I'm one who does not
like the company's recent history with product quality.
BEC: hold. Possible add if it drops few more points.
DGX: Good for a small buy at current price, imo. I'll follow Jurgis Bekepuris
and will place an order for Monday for a small tracking buy.
LH: Alternative to DGX, and discussed here over many years. I'll pass- a little
to expensive for me. Numbers (ROE) consistently high. As with DGX, p/e is now
historically low, and on that, both DGX and LH could be reversion-to-mean
plays.

Hi Investor2 -

This is exactly the situation I am trying to figure out too. My largest holding
is in the Vanguard GNMA fund (currently about 10% of the portfolio) which I
have tagged as my fixed income component of the portfolio. I use the income
that it generates to live on and I like the safety the fund provides.

About a year ago (post crash) I pulled out 25% and bought utility stocks at a
very good bargain and yield. I have recently been selling more GNMA (about
another 10%)harvesting my LT capital gains and trying to invest these proceeds
in bond like equivalent securities.

The best I can come up with are some selected preferred stocks, some which I
have been able to buy at a deep discount. However, I am taking more risk so I
have diversified these positions into a basket of stocks that I call "high
yield" hybrid bond like equities.

The group consist of REIT preferreds, utility stocks, MLP NG companies and
other midstream NG pipeline, gathering & storage companies. These companies
have good cash flows that generate excellent income (stable income & growing
revenues especially in the NG sector). I am able to achieve a combine yield of
about 6.5% compared to under 3% for the GNMA.

One of my favorites which I plan to add to on any significant sell off is
Tortoise Power and Energy Infra (TPZ) which has been discussed on this board.
The nice part is they pay their distributions monthly which is similar to what
the Vanguard GNMA does. Their managed portfolio currently yields around 6.7%
and sells at a 6% discount to its NAV (this discount spread can vary as high as
9% to as low as 4%). If you buy on large market volatility swings it's possible
to lock in at a higher spread. Liquidity is pretty good as the fund trades over
69K shares a day compared to a similar ETF (MLPG) that trades on average only
7K shares/day.

I have also put some of the GNMA proceeds into Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred
Income Fund Inc. (PFD). This is one that Paul Senior alerted me to. The fund is
trading near it's high, you can generally buy shares at a discount to its NAV
on extreme market volatility days (ie 200pt down days). The Fund yields 8.5%
but has almost 2x the management fee (1.96% vs .85%) as TPZ. It pays it's
distributions monthly and you can elect to have your dividends automatically
reinvested. It's difficult to buy individual preferred securities (spreads are
large, not too liquid, fees can be large), so I think the higher management fee
is worth it.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TPZ,PFD&d=s

The Strategy:

My strategy is to book most of my LT capital gains (some of my shares have 15%
gains) from my Vanguard GNMA and invest the proceeds into my "bond like" basket
of utility & preferred stocks. When the yields on my utilities fall below 5%
and/or PE rises over 14 and/or I have a significant capital gain, I plan to
move the funds into (1) other new "bond like" candidates or (2) add to TPZ or
PFD Funds. Eventually as rates begin to rise, I will build up treasury ladders
and/or work these monies back into the Vanguard GNMA or other equivalent bond
funds.

I need both the safety that these investments provide and the monthly income it
generates. The key to this strategy is to understand the extra risk associated
with the equities in my "high yield" hybrid bond like equities and manage the
risk accordingly. I try to do this with diversification, buying quality large
cap equities and allocating some of the money into closed end funds.

I2, It's a dilemma I don't know how to resolve.

I don't keep a fixed percentage of my portfolio in fixed income funds. Very
possible, given my age and lifestyle, that I'd be best served if I did reduce
my exposure to stocks by having and keeping more fixed income investments. It's
a difficult conclusion or realization for me to come to.

I have more in fixed income now than I've had in any of the past 30 years
(except for '09). Opportunistically and with hope, I've recently taken chunks
of money from some of my fixed income funds (bond funds&convertible bond
funds&bank accounts) and made purchases of individual stocks that I'm attracted
to. There are a lot of companies out there that look good to me on a valuation
basis. Even something like XOM which is trading now at very attractive levels
for a conservative investor with a long term view. For a conservative investor,
Chevron gives you almost a 4% yield. (I've been a recent buyer of both.)
I may take some of the monies from utility stock sales and put them back into
high-yield bond funds. That has its drawbacks too...chasing yields has been
very dangerous for me.

Small Defense Contractor With Interesting Potential
Today's addition to the Barchart Van Meerten New High portfolio is a small
defense contractor. We are looking at this as a short term price momentum play
not a long term investment.

CPI Aerostructures, Inc. (CVU) is comprised of two distinct entities: CPI
Aerostructures, Inc. and Kolar, Inc. CPI Aerostructures, Inc. engages in the
contract production of structural aircraft parts for the United States Air
Force and other branches of the U.S. armed forces as a prime contractor or
subcontractor for other defense prime contractors primarily in the United
States. The company, as a prime contractor, offers skin panels, leading edges,
flight control surfaces, engine components, wing tips, cowl doors, nacelle
assemblies, and inlet assemblies for military aircraft. As a subcontractor, it
offers various pods, and modular and structural assemblies for military
aircraft; and various kits and assemblies for the S-92 civilian helicopter, as
well as operates as a subcontractor to prime contractors in the production of
commercial aircraft parts. The company was formerly known as Consortium of
Precision Industries, Inc. and changed its name to CPI Aerostructures.

The stock came up on my daily Barchart screening for stocks hitting the most
frequent new highs. This one hit 15 new highs in the last 20 trading sessions
including 5 in the last 5. Last month's price appreciation of 17.58% has given
the stock a 96% Barchart technical buy and a Trend Spotter buy. The stock
trades around 10.79 with a 50 day moving average of 9.43.

Wall Street hasn't discovered this stock yet and only 1 analyst follows it but
he thinks the stock will have a 25% 5 year annual compounded EPS growth rate.

Investors also haven't found it either. On Motley Fool the 2 investors that
have given opinions think it will beat the market.

I'm adding CPI Aerostructures (CVU) to the Barchart Van Meerten New High
portfolio but will keep a very close eye on it. Points to consider:

15 new highs in the last 20 sessions
17.28% price appreciation last month
96% Barchart technical buy signal
Trend Spotter buy signal
Wall Street analyst prediction of a 25% EPS growth
Extremely small but positive investor sentiment
Get in early but be prepared to get out early too
Disclosure: No positions in CVU at the time of publication.

The problem with RoE (or RoA) is that the denominator e (Equity) or A (assets)
is "path dependent". This means that in particular the intangible part of
assets can have different values depending on what happened in the past
(mergers, good will writedowns, accounting treatment of goodwill etc.) if you
leave goodwill out entirely, you will get very high ROA/ROE values because the
medical companies in questions (COV, BEC, BAX, MHS, DGX) need little hard
assets to operate their business.

Of the two metrics ROE and ROA I always prefer ROA because it accounts for Debt
orleverage. You may not care truly from a shareholder perspective and only say
that owners earnings count, but I think debt is important because it a)
increases the risk for the shareholder and b) and acquirer would only care
about the EV (which includes debt).

So ROA only makes sense with a few disclaimers as to what is counted for as
assets and how management has treated the intangibles in the past (how do you
account for good will writedowns if they have occurred in the past ?).

I like EV/EBITDA because it is a number that is harder to manipulate then
earnings and it's easy to calculate knowing that looking at this ratio alone
will penalize a well run business that makes effective use of their cash
flow,relative to mediocre or bad ones. No ratio is perfect and each of the
approaches (ROA, EV/EBITDA) makes sense, imo.

As to medical companies, I consider BEC and COV with PE's of around 11.5 as
attractive. on an EV/EBITDA basis COV looks a little more expensive (even
thought he PE is similar to BEC) because it is domiciled in a tax efficient
location, so it pays a lower tax rates which leaves more for the owners.

I pay a higher multiple for a manufacturing business like COV or BEC than a
service business DGX because the latter has higher risk, imo. I think the whole
bunch is starting to look increasingly attractive assuming that the
fundamentals stabilize.

However it is now a momentum play and is hardly undiscovered when it trades in
this fashion lately. I still view this as a cyclical stock and would look to a
pullback to 9 or so before reconsidering getting into it. It may not get there

Hi Paul-

Re: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ); Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)

Lots of people on these boards are taking positions in JNJ. I am holding off
for a little bit as there has been some rumors that JNJ may make a bid for
Genzyme. I noticed that I started my position in JNJ (04/2006) at around this
level ($57/share) which I subsequently sold (1/3 position) in 09/2008 at
$70.00/share and the rest in Jan-May 2010 around $64/share. The stock looks
cheap but is trading funny (selling off on the most recent market rallies). If
they do some type of Genzyme deal (or JV with SNY), they could sell off to new
52 wk lows.

Even today's gain was on AVG volume. LLY traded higher on heavy volume (30%
above avg daily). I sold some October covered calls on LLY today and would like
to switch my shares into JNJ. I suspect any JNJ acquisition would be announced
by then (Oct 2010) and if they acquired a company, the stock may initially sell
down providing an excellent entry point. Long term I like JNJ's product
portfolio much more than LLY, PFE, SNY, BMY or GSK which are my other pharma

RE: SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU)

SVU announced earnings which had low street expectations. The stock traded a
bit higher on twice their average volume. This trading activity was a net
positive for the stock and I think we hit our low for the year. The surprise
was the resignation of their CFO. Not too clear of what to make of that. The
company (CEO) stated they still plan to make their earnings projections for
2011 and it looks like its going to be from more cost cutting and/or store/real
estate sales. It's not coming from growth and/or higher margins.

Company still in value "buy" territory. I may add but most likely will hold
what I have and start a position in WMT. This stock should begin to build a
base and I am looking at a price target of $18.00/share-$24.00/share in 12
months IF the perceived (or actual) WallMart and Target market share loss is
much less than expected. SVU's efficient distribution & logistic systems will
allow them to hit their stated earnings targets. A new CFO will make the harder
decisions on which stores and/or real estate they must sell. Proceeds from any
large sale(s) will go to reduce debt.

Industry BV ranges from 1.5 (SWY), TGT (2.65), 2.65 (KR),2.85(WMT), 3.5 (WFMI).
SVU is 0.85! At 1.5 BV stock should trade around $18.00/share. I will begin to
peel off some shares when we get back to this share price (ie. $18.00/share).

For value investors with limited downside risk, SVU might be a good speculative
buy. My last buys were 6/30/2010 at $10.95/share and 06/07/2010 at
$12.33/share.

RE: EI DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD)

Excellent earnings 25% upside surprise. Sales growth came from the rebound in
the auto sector (paints) which I had not even factored into my view. Will begin
to peel off shares at the $42.75/share level and may need to re-evaluate if
indeed economy growth prospects are perceived higher.

I expected this:"...The company's electronics and communications unit saw the
biggest leap in quarterly sales -- 53% to $657 million. The company credited
rising demand across all regions and market segments, especially photovoltaics,
for the top-line growth....". Out to 2012-2013 this division is estimated to
have double digit growth maybe with sales as high as $1.5 Billion (see my other
posts on DD).

I expect analysts will be upping their out year estimates which should move the
stock higher. With a forwad PE of 14 and higher estimates, one could argue that
DD is still within value buy range but the easy money has already been made. If
a double dip occurs, these "easy" earnings disapear.

DuPont lifted its 2010 earnings projection to a range of $2.90 to $3.05 a
share, excluding significant items. That compares with a prior forecast of
$2.50 to $2.70 a share. This was the level analysts were at for 2011!

I suspect we are closer to the time to sell than the time to buy.

KSW,

I am not particularly worried about cash flow. They have ample cash and if you
look back to 2005-2008, they have a good record of generating cash flow. A few
quarters doesn't get me in a tizzy.

Side note: One of the quarters of negative cash flow was for paying an annual
dividend, something I am in favor of.

I am worried about backlog holding up. If you do a historical analysis, the
current level of backlog should support strong earnings. However, the backlog
has been revised down in recent quarters. Fundamentals are not great in a city
like New York, and it could be a long time before earnings recover.

That being said, I think the upside outweighs the current downside.

Call volume has popped on Pfizer Inc. (PFE) today, with the pharmaceutical
concern seeing 59,000 of these bullish bets traded by midday, well above the
equity's expected single-session call volume of around 39,000 contracts.

The September 16 call takes the title for the day's most active strike, with
16,377 contracts traded -- 60% at the ask price, suggesting they were likely
purchased. With some 168,000 contracts currently open at this strike -- site of
peak call open interest for the back-month series -- it's difficult to
determine whether these calls were, in fact, bought to open. However, with PFE
trading around $15.00, these 16-strike calls are just one point out of the
money..."

-------------------------------------------------------------------

PFE has been a value trap for the past decade slowly leaking oil similar to
LLY. Analysts have 2010-2011 easrnings at $2.10-$2.25 and the same for
2011-2012. That makes the PE around 6.5. If PFE can stabilize earnings at
current levels and show the market some prospects on how they plan to replace
some of those future revenues from off patent drugs, then we may have seen the
LT bottom in 2009 and retested again in June 2010 (a higher low on 30% lower
weekly volume).

The market seems to think so w/ 50% the normal Call volume activity for the
September 16 calls. Open Interest expanded by 30% indicating some pretty large
call bets that the stock will be 5% higher in 60 days. With a 4.7% dividend,
that would make close to a 6.2% return in 60 days.

I increased my position by 25% in June 2010 at $15.00/share. I did sell an
equal amount of December 2010 $18 covered calls to "juice" my trade. I would be
satisfied to peel off some shares at $18.00 in December.

================================================================

RE: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) - Large Put volume on the October $50.00 Put.

Somebody sold 1000 contracts to open, betting that JNJ will trade at
$50.00/share or below in the third week of October 2010. Open Interest should
expand by 30% when this trade settles indicating that it is quite substantial.

It's still relatively small compared to the Open Interest for the October
$62.50 calls at 3:1. Typically the Call/Put ratio is 2:1 so there is still no
market conviction that the downside break down is imminent. It is building
though.

Disclosure: I have no position in JNJ and hold shares in PFE in both the IRA
and taxable account.

I assume you mean Covidien (COV) . Efficiency was not the problem, their
earnings were great, but topline was lacking. i think management is doing a
decent job since they were spun of from Tyco. Back then, they were generating
decent profits but sales growth was anemic and the product line was stale due
to years of skimping on R&D. Over the years, they bumped up R&D, restructured
the company and improved the balance sheet. Operating earnings are about 40%
higher than after the spinoff, but the stock is lower than it was back then.

I bought some around 32$ last year and peeled of shares at around 42$ and 50$.
unfortunately I rode some remaining shares down to 37$. Now I am buying again.

As for GFRE,the mixed shelf is bad news. 120M$ is quite a bit of capital for a
300M$ market cap company. it sounds like they are hellbent on expansion. that
is not good for shareholders. Maybe I fish for some shares in the 7.XX$ range.

it sounds like they are hellbent on expansion. that is not good for

My view is that GFRE has historically been hellbent on expansion and it has
been good for shareholders.

GFRE is the classic GARP stock. In 2006 revenues were 31 million. Projections
for 2010 are 148 million. Earnings per share in 2006 were .18. Projections for
2010 are 1.25. All of this has been accomplished through organic growth in
their chemical division and through acquisition of bromine and crude salt
assets. Annual production capacity of bromine has grown from 12000 metric tons
in 2007 to 43000 metic tons by the end of 2009. For crude salt grown from
100000 metric tons in 2007 to 450000 in 2009.

Such a large shelf registration should give investors pause. But I feel this is
one of the few Chinese companies that has increased returns to shareholders.
The company sits in a rather enviable position as demand for bromine exceeds
production in China.

http://www.slideshare.net/CCGIR/gulf-resources-inc-presentation-march-2009

GFRE used to be my largest position. I sold half and have an average price of
2.20 on my remaining shares. So "hellbent expansion" has been good for me :) I
still like the company, and the second quarter CC should provide some color to
the shelf registration.

re GFRE - i don't doubt that you made money on GFRE but taking into account the
1:4 reverse split the 2.2$ becomes 8.8$ which is just about where the stock is
now.

The question with all these capital raises is if they can outrun the effects of
dilution. The way I see it, GFRE is becoming a rollup in bromide resources with
little organic production growth (if any). As all rollups, they will have to do
larger and larger acquisitions to keep growing which in many cases causes
rollups to fail if they do a major mistake. FWIW I do like the large profit
margins in the bromide business but I would prefer to see some organic growth
as well with their existing assets. So far i am not seeing that, unless I am

A couple of points:

Actually my 2.2 basis takes into account the 1:4 reverse split. My original
shares were purchased in the .40-.50 range. One of the reasons I halved my
position was because it getting to be a significant part of my portfolio.

"The question with all these capital raises is if they can outrun the effects
of dilution."

So far they have. My view is that the dilution, hasn't hurt the earnings to
date. There have been a number of roll-ups in the last two or three years.
Slide 10 in the presentation posted points out that they can purchase
"non-operating production assets" because they have a bromine production
license. The following quote is from the 10-K:

Each of the asset acquisitions described above was not in operation when the
Company acquired the asset. The owners of each of the assets did not hold the
proper license for the exploration and production of bromine, and production at
each of the assets acquired had been previously halted by the government. With
respect to the Factory No. 2, the assets had not been operational for nine
months; with respect to Factory No. 3, the assets had not been operational for
eleven months; with respect to Factory No. 4 and 5 , the assets had not been
operational for fifteen months; with respect to Factory No. 6, the assets had
not been operational for eighteen months; and with respect to Factory No. 7,
the assets had not been operational for twelve months; and with respect to
Factory No. 8, the assets had not been operational for thirteen months

Certainly this isn't organic growth, but there is a "value-added" boost to
purchasing non-operational assets and bringing them into operation with their
license.

"I would prefer to see some organic growth as well with their existing assets."

Furthermore, there is organic growth in the chemical division of their company.
Slide GFRE 11 indicates that chemicals is becoming an increasing share of their
total revenues as they climb higher on the value-chain. Slide 15 shows that
they are increasing their lines of production in the chemical division. Of
particular note is the fourth line of production for wastewater treatment
chemicals.
Below is the PR when they announced the line in January.

http://www.faqs.org/sec-filings/100106/GULF-RESOURCES-INC_8-K/e606286_ex99-1.ht

If the numbers in the PR pan out--and the revenue numbers from this line could
be significant-- there will be plenty of organic growth in the chemical
division.

GFRE I dont understand your quibbling over organic growth. It seems to me that
they will easily get to $1.50 earnings with what they have,and they operate as

growth in the chemical and pharmeceutical units. So to me on a worst case basis
you are looking at less than 6x earnings and I see the risks as fraud of some
kind, and the chinese pulls their license to do business.
I believe a stock like this could easily sell for 15 times earnings as I belive
that company can increase its per share earnings for the next decade. After all
the company's product is used in clothing, Oil and gas drillling, water

GFRE,

I think organic growth versus acquisitions requiring capital raises is an
important point to discuss. You have addressed it with some very well thought
out arguments, but I'd like to chip in as to why I think the discussion is
important.

In general, I don't trust companies with seemingly cheap valuations raising
capital. It begs the question - if the managers think the stock is so cheap why
are the selling more of it at bargain-basement prices? Maybe the stock isn't as
good a value as it appears. Unless there is a huge business opportunity
requiring the capital, I think investors are usually better off if undervalued
companies bought back stock or just keep things as is, rather than issuing new
stock.

I can agree that for certain companies the opportunities are so great that
raising money is worth the cost of dilution. That appears to be the case here.
However, I will also point that most times the benefits of acquisitions never
meet expectations. And just because a company has been successful with
acquisitions in the past, doesn't mean it will continue to do so in the future.
I believe most of us, both in investing and in business, are at our most
susceptible point after a period of successes.

That being said, I of course would rather be on board with a company with a
history of successful acquisitions than a company with a spotty track record.

Hi Paul -

I am having a hard time calculating the value of these e&p companies based on
their assets, earnings, productive wells drilled or any other typical value
metric.

So, I am scanning blogs ( http://bakkenshale.blogspot.com/ ) that discuss
recent sucessfull drilled wells, industry chatter and new permits filed; and
discover a potential e&p candidate AEZ but find out that HES is acquiring the
company.

From my initial review of AES, it seemed like a good potential e&p candidate
but certainly not a value play. Perhaps a good speculation.

Hess Backs Up the Truck
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2010/07/28/hess-backs-up-the-truck.aspx

From the article:"...This week, Hess filled out its considerable Bakken acreage
with the acquisition of American Oil & Gas (AMEX: AEZ) in an all-stock deal.
The transaction will add around 85,000 net acres to Hess' land position, which
weighs in at more than half a million acres. Prior to this acquisition, Hess
had set a production target of 80,000 barrels per day by 2015..."

Companies mentioned in this article: CLR,HES,BEXP,AES,NOG,OAS
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CLR,HES,BEXP,AES,NOG,OAS&d=s

I have come to the conclusion that the "value play" is to buy shares in the
companies that are acquiring these small e&p companies. Even those with
earnings typically sell for a high PE but as new production wells come online,
their forward PE falls near value territory.

Have you looked at any of those companies mentioned in the article above?
Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG) looks interesting as it is close to a pure
play w/ next years earnings estimated around $1.00/share making their 2011 PE
around 15.

It would seem to me that an acquiring company has better information that you
or I might have regarding a specific small e&p company. They should be able to
buy the assets on the cheap and through scale bring out the highest value of
their production wells.

I do like your thought of tracking similar foreign buyers because they are
probably doing the same thing. The sovereign funds are another source of funds.
They are just way too big and have limited knowledge in making such specific
investments. It would make more sense for them to buy a large interest in some
of these acquiring companies and take advantage of their expertise.

Bakken/oil. EKS, here's how I see it. Anything you (or anybody else here) can
add or correct or clarify, please chime in.

Yes, these oil companies are valued by things other than earnings per shares or
dividends. More on cash flows. I'm still working on how I am valuing these
companies. As I said in an earlier post, one metric I like is enterprise value
to net asset value. I want something that I can screen for and/or determine
quickly, and something that's "good enough". That is, something or somethings
that provide conclusions not too far from what professional analysts or
businessmen would find.

I can get an approximation to enterprise value that generally works for me
(market cap less net debt). Sometimes, some of the companies provide their
enterprise value calculations. Net asset value is the issue. Sometimes
companies provide it, sometimes not. When I can get it, I use proved and
probable reserves and ignore possible. Sometimes companies use strip pricing,
sometimes SEC pricing. Some companies provide "after everything", sometimes
pretax, sometimes per well(before the companies wi amount), and so on. In other
words, no consistency from company to company. Some companies provide reserves
only in terms of mmboe. This (mmboe vs. mmbo) usually means they have both oil
and gas (and nat gas liquid). I don't like this "barrels of equivalent oil"
thing, because when management converts gas to oil by energy equivalent for
reserve numbers, they then tend to value that in a ratio of the old -- and in
my opinion now obsolete -- 6:1 price ratio. Anyway, I struggle along.

I hold a few shares of CLR for tracking. I'm not planning to add more. I
believe I may be too late for BEXP. OAS is new- I looked at it when it first
came out, didn't see enough info.--I'll look again now. I have shares in NOG.

Possibly OT.

I read through about half of "Fooled by Randomness" at a bookstore.

IMHO Taleb is a pompous ass. He spends at least third of the book lashing out
at people he does not like although he is not often brave enough to give
concrete names. Another third is his pseudointelectual hogwash where he tries
to tie the "randomness" insight to literature and science, through a bunch of
anecdotes. Unfortunately, scientist (or even journalist) he isn't, so the
examples are paper thin and rambling. Doesn't stop Taleb though. I really loved
his claim that his anecdote (on Solon) is worth more than hundreds of real
stories or studies by other people, just because he says so. Of course, he once
in a while throws in false pretenses of humbleness.

Now for his theories. Actually there's not much more than what we discussed on
this thread. Most things that happen in life are random and difficult to
predict. You might be better off through talent and hard work, but there's no
guarantee for that. (Here he goes into the ramblings how most people he hates
were lucky idiots that were punished by fate at the end - go Taleb, you'r da
fate!!! :))). Some professions (and actions) are more predictable than others.
Taking his example, a dentist will have more predictable career than a trader.
However, even a dentist may be affected by randomness. Extending his example, a
jewish dentist in Nazi Germany would have very different life from dentist in
USA; even US dentist's patient might randomly die and he could be financially
devastated by a lawsuit. Still, considering his thought experiment of running
through thousands of possible lifetimes, the dentist's life would be less
varied than a trader's life. This insight is not bad in itself, actually there
are investors who claim to follow this pattern of considering (imagining) all
possible bad outcomes and trying to avoid loss of capital in almost any case. I
am not sure this works very well, but it can bring some useful approaches, e.g.
not to buy leveraged companies.

A related thought is that people cannot recognize a historical event as it
occurs. Only hindsight is 20/20. This is again pretty useful - I am reading
Buffett's biography now and it's amazing to read about Americans being
isolationist on WWII - great example of people thinking very differently at the
time than what we think post-factum about the war and victory against Nazi
Germany. To take example closer to our topic, we cannot clearly see how
2007-2009 recession will play out - as a big event or just a whimper in
history. That also makes it more clear why people would sell out in the bottom
- it is hard or almost impossible to know whether the crash will continue. In
some sense, Buffett buying WFC in March 2009 WAS betting on lucky guess that
the crash won't spread.

So overall, IMHO, the book has some useful insights, but it is horridly
written. Of course, Taleb deflects any chance of criticism by claiming in the
foreword that the book is not a scientific treatise and is pretty much a
collection of his musings. It would have been great that randomness would have
found a better author to present the ideas, but we'll have to live in this
particular version of reality... ;)

OKS is an MLP, so I don't think its metrics would be comparable to EP and ENB.
It would be more comparable to EPD and EEP.

re Taleb - i did not find him pompous in this book - maybe a little bit too
scholarly at times. i also thought that his buddy Victor Niederhoeffer comes
off very easily in his book (the fact that he recommended Taleb's book
certainly helped) but the weaknesses matter not as much as hist strength.

I thought the claim that the track record (in particular one that is short and
does not include different market conditions) does not prove superior skill per
say and methodology is more important is very valuable. The strong impact of
survivorship bias on result is another one.

One very valuable insight is that most money managers and Wall Street have
incentive to bet on the most likely outcome, not the most profitable one. If
this weren't so, the financial crises may never happened. I found a lot of
connections with Michael Lewiss book "The big short", which clearly shows the
connection between incentives and the root cause of the financial crises. in
addition one of the hedge funds that made it big (Cornwall) was specialized on
betting on unlikely events (in this case that AA CDO tranches could default).

Taleb also wrote the "Black Swan", very timely this was published in 2007. Like
him or not, i don't think he is an idiot.

Hi MCsweet -

MLP vs common stock valuation

You make a very good point to evaluate MLP's against equivalent MLP's. What if
one is looking at a MLP vs a common stock in the same industry?

I would think that the first look might be to compare the PE of each company to
determine which earnings stream is cheapest at the current price? Using the
YAHOO Finance "Competitor" selection for OKS, they show EP, ENB, KMP & Industry
as comparisons. I was just looking at Market Cap and PE vs industry to
determine size and value.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=OKS,EP,ENB,EPD,EEP&d=s

When looking at the MLP's you listed, they seem to have a similar PE (around
20) to OKS. The common stock PE for EP and ENB are almost half that of the
equivalent MLPs.

Are earnings calculated differently for MLPs than for the common stock
companies? What do you need to adjust in the MLP income statement to be
equivalent to the common stock (do you add back in a % of the depreciation
expense)? Maybe it would be better just to look at enterprise Free Cash Flows.

Any suggestion for other metric(s) I should consider when looking to value
equivalent MLP's vs common stocks?

re MLP's
You should really look here:
http://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=5028

Most investors in MLP's look at distributable cash (cash flow - maintenance
expenses/Capex) as a metric instead of earnings yield. Most MLP's will
distribute the majority of their distributable cash (90%+) but some will keep
some especially in good years.

Maintenance expenses are a somewhat iffy number and one should keep in mind
that some assets have a finite life (NG gathering systems for example) while
pipelines can last for decades.

I also recommend to look at EV/EBITDA since you can compare taxable
cooperations with MLP's using this metric. You will find that most MLP trades
at substantial premiums to taxable equivalents right now. During the crisis
some MLP traded at no premium at all and sometimes even at a discount. MLP's
tend to be very sensitive to the condition of the credit markets.

SNY. I have the same concerns. I'll follow you this morning with a sale of
about 50% of my shares. I show I have shares from 5/'07 with several subsequent
buys as the stock has come down. While the company has continued to produce
results, prospects seem to have diminished as reflected in the declining p/e.
(And I view SNY going after GENZ as now being SNY's affirmation that SNY's
prospects by itself might not be so good.) Whereas I'd hoped the stock would
revert to mean values, after three years this has not happened. So I'll sell
some, take losses, and move funds elsewhere.

EKS,

I think Spekulatius provides a good answer for evaluating MLPs, so basically I
would go with that. Here are a few more comments, though.

I'd say distributable cash flow (Price versus disbtributable cash flow or
distributable cash flow yield) is the primary factor most analysts use for
evaluating MLPs. To the extent this is correctly reflected in dividend yield
(which I don't think it necessarily is), then dividend yield is an approximate
measure when comparing across MLPs.

EV/EBIDTA seems reasonable for comparison of MLPs versus regular companies. I
would think MLPs in general should trade at a premium because of their tax
advantage. That is why it is economic for companies to spin-off assets to MLPs
and both sides seem to do ok.

You probably also want to factor in the potential growth in cash flow (organic
growth good) and volatility of underlying assets (pipelines lower volatility
and hence better than production unless you are a big energy bull).

re SNY - i have no problems with acquisition per say but GENZ does not seem
like a good fit for SNY
First of all GENZ specialty biologics do not fit into SNY existing portfolio as
I see it. Furthermore I do not think that GENZ incredible expensive orphan
drugs (for Gaucher and such) are unassailable either if political powers decide
otherwise and open the door for biological drug generics for example. I think
this would be much easier to do if a company offering such expensive offering
(we are talking about 100k/ patient and year!) is owned by a foreign company.
Headline " French company charges 100k$/ year for single drug -medicare
pays..."

I could see if SNY would acquire a emerging market generics company or a
vaccine upstart, but GENZ? I probably sell the remainder of my shares as well,
selling half is not really a solution if you don't have confidence.

The FR preferred K & J shares are up to $17.40/share

The stock is still within value territory but most of the easy money has been
made. The company is still struggling to generate FFO and needs to increase
occupancy, sell vacant properties and/or sell their exiting JV's (this saves
cash). It's possible that they hit bottom last quarter but their success is
dependant on how the U.S. economy recovers.

Hi Walter - New recovery high for EI DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD). I agree with
some of your views on their valuation in May 2010. Peeled off 30% of my shares
today bought in Nov 2008 and January 2009 at prices between
$23.80/share-$26.80/share.

I will let the remaining shares run based on their pretty good report last
quarter. The key is if their "new" revenue sources are sustaining or do they
fall back to the stagnant 5 year revenues trend you pointed out in your post.
World economy must continue to grow too which is not necessarily on the table.

Will look at peeling off more shares if the stock breaks above $50. I got most
of my seed money back and will deploy else where.

The Government could take away or reduce substantially the tax benefits of MLPs
(to raise needed revenues) thus making these investments less attractive over

Limited Partnerships Let Wealthy Play Oil Tycoons in Yield Hunt
http://noir.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aHwQvayTqH9A&pos=7

From the article:"...Investors are pouring into energy-related MLPs, increasing
their market capitalization 20 percent as of July to $183 billion from $152
billion in 2009, said Michael Blum, a managing director at Wells Fargo
Securities, a unit of San-Francisco- based Wells Fargo & Co. <u> About 90
percent of new equity in the partnerships last year came from retail investors,
he said. </u>..."

<snip>

"...Typically 75 percent to 80 percent of the cash distributions are
tax-deferred until units of the MLP are sold, which is appealing to high-income
earners worried about taxes, said Lyman. In 2011, federal income tax rates are
expected to rise to as high as 39.6 percent from 35 percent, unless Congress
acts.

advantages of MLPs to raise revenue..."
