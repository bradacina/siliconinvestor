Hi Elmatador. The PBR $70B stock sale is completed, so maybe now PBR stock will
stop falling.

As PBR lets out contracts, the SBillions will flow to oil service companies all
over the world. Of course, Brazil, which seems to have an oil policy, will give
top priority, maybe exclusive priority, to Brazilian companies that provide
products and services to PBR. I still follow several Brazilian companies that
may benefit.

One company that I'm sure (although I could be wrong) will receive at least
several $Billions is the lead bank in the stock sale, Banco Bradesco. The money
may not stay there, but it is going there. And as Brazilian companies get
orders from PBR, and more workers get jobs and income, this bank should be able
to finance some of these people's purchases and also provide a way for them to
save.

BBD has not been a great investment for me during the three years I've held the
stock. I believe business prospects for BBD are good now, and with the stock
price where it is, I'll again add a few more shares to my position, (I also
hold just a few shares of ITUB, which some analysts in the past have said is
the better opportunity. I'm staying with BBD for now.)

My take on it is that gold and silver are hardwired into the human psyche.
Governments are coming to their senses again and realizing the folly of relying
on some other government to be prudent in the issuance of their own currency.
IM surprised that no one in uk is calling for Gordon Brown's head on a platter.
What we are left with then is gold silver oil or some sort of commodity basket.
The value case for gold is based on whether its underowned or not. so far not
one person that i know has asked me about investing or gold or silver or their
stocks, most closed end gold funds are selling at liberal discounts. I have
been discussing pelangio and its successor DGC.to as well as SLW on this board
for a couple of years now and I have only heard from one thread participant who
bought some. My own two cents are that gold and silver will continue to be
volatile but the opportunity cost of own some is very low right now and I dont
see a reason to pull the plug on owning until short term interst start rising
sharply. I expect that when banks start offering money market interest rate of
6% there will be a significant shift. but that seems far away.

Hi Paul - COV only 2.38 years of Net Income to cover LT Debt. An Interesting
Value Play.

Re: Covidien plc. Ordinary Shares ((NYSE: COV)
vs Becton, Dickinson and Company C(NYSE: BDX)

This one looks like a good value bet. I like that they can cover their LT debt
w/ net income in 2.38 years. Forward PE is expected to come down to 11 and the
stock is still below it's 200 day MA.

I will look for an entry point on any test back to it's 50 day MA at $37.85. A
higher dividend would be nice but that could happen in 2011.

Yahoo Finance shows BDX as a competitor. BDX is selling slightly above it's 200
Day MA. It's has a better LT Debt to Net Income profile at 0.5 years! It's
forward PE is little improved from it's trailing PE (around 14) and does not
show as much improvement (in profitability) as COV. Dividend yield is slightly
better for BDX.

COV looks like its expected to be more profitable next year and as a result
could be fixed to gain more than BDX.

I recently sold my SNY and am looking for another Drug/Health Care related
investment. JNJ was one on my list but COV or BDX look like better value
propositions.

Good find by Spekulatius and follow up by you. Too many of these companies fall
off my radar.

I will add COV to my watch list and hope for a slight check back to the $37.85
area.

EKS

FWIW I too am looking to book some gains in SFL but am waiting for
$19.25/share. It's hard to give up that 7.5% yield w/ the expectation that
there will also be another dividend raise this year. Rumor has it that they
have been raising funds to lock in another Ultra Deep drilling Rig contract.
There is some speculation there is an order from Petrobras.

I don't have a set method for calculating free cash flow, but I define it
simply as corporate discretionary spending, as measured in available dollars.

Every company needs free cash flow to pay for things like shareholder
dividends, or research/development of new products or new ideas, interest
payments on potential future loans or bonds, and potential expansion of
existing payroll (whether in the form of increased compensation or additional
staffing).

When examining the numbers of a third party company as a possible acquisition,
the free cash flow of the about to be purchased firm is one measure of that
firm's ability to enhance the bottom line of the acquiring company.

Free cash flow is also used by potential bond purchasers to determine any
likely/unlikely possibility of future default.

The actual calculation of free cash flow can (and in my opinion, should) vary
from company to company and industry to industry. It just doesn't make sense
(to me) to try to calculate the free cash flow for a regional bank using the
exact same formula as one might use in calculating the free cash flow of a
multinational manufacturer.

Just one man's opinion though...

when i looked into this a while back i didnt think mgmt and shareholder

also not impressed that they raised their share equity now with the price in

guess is that this will be more about option enrichment for management than any
benefit to shareholders. right now i will probably wait for the actual spinoff
to occur and then assess.

Interesting development on TTT/mass financial. they want to merge the two which
i think is great but the price for mass financial. mfcaf is too low. they say
both have a book value of about $9 but i dont see that. i think the bv of mass
financial is at least $10. so I will probably vote unless either they raise the
exchange terms or the price of ttt soars prior to the vote. I know there are
some funds like tweedy brown that at some point owned boat loads of MFCAF stock
so Im guessing they might already have those votes in the bag. at least it will
provide more liquidity for mfcaf shareholders and better visibility. I would
assume then that the chinese and other foreign operations would then have to be
spun off. right now they have some issues with and oilfield in india for
example. that doesnt exactly fit with a base metals royalty scheme. So I guess
we can see more spinoffs in the pipeline.

Free cash flow - FCF. My current take is that FCF is less important for
investment success then I thought a few years ago.

My observation is that companies with a high FCF ( meaning they generate more
funds than they can reinvest in their business) often tend to put this money at
work where it does not seem to benefit shareholders. Examples are HPQ (which i
own) with their skimpy dividend and their bidding wars with 3PAR.

There are sectors that would fail and FCF screen and still do well - utilities
being one example (they outperformed the SP500 for many years). Utilities
mostly pay dividends and reinvest in their own business, sometime incurring
debt to do so. This is a very straightforward business. Mergers do happen but
they are typically fully paid in stock and only pay modest premiums. Utilities
only got into trouble when they followed Enron into their "asset light"
business model and energy trading.

Other sectors that have been doing well are mining and energy. In both
business, the companies tend to reinvest most cash flow in their business and
into hard assets. However if you compare companies within the same industry
group, those that generate FCF are preferable to those that do not, everything
else being equal (which is mostly not case).

Whitney Tilson on LIA,

Jurgis, thanks for pointing this out. It is always useful to get the take of
professional investors on these.

I think Tilson is understating the case for the LIA common because the Class B
convertible shares convert into $2 Euro worth of Prisa stock if Prisa is below
$2 Euros on the conversion date (up to a maximum of 1.33 class A shares per
class B share, with Prisa common around 1.69 euro we are not at that limit
yet). That is why I have such a higher value estimate. Also note that the class
B shares get a nice divvie of up to 0.175 Euro per year (assuming the company
makes enough money) until the conversion takes place.

There is much more juice in the LIA warrants, but I think the common has better
downside protection. That being said, I'm not buying any more after the small
run-up here. I am content to stick with the slug of stock I already bought.

GFRE,

Money talks.

The GFRE buyback is more about proving the legitimacy of the company than about
the pure economics IMO. That would improve the sentiment and quickly get the
stock up IMO.

If investors see the company spending real cash on a stock buyback, it is a
very reassuring sign, first that the company has real cash to employ on the
buyback and second that the company management actually believes in the
company.

A couple of sham Chinese companies I once followed did the opposite: stock
offerings (or paid other companies in stock) at or near 52 week lows despite
ostensibly high earnings and cash.

That being said if GFRE is going to need to raise money in the future, they
obviously have to be prudent in their buyback levels.

Re: Golar LNG Limited (NasdaqGS: GLNG)

I own StealthGas, Inc. (GASS) which I followed you on in 2/2010 at around the
current level.

Perhaps I should also add a bit of GLNG to my basket. GLNG pays a pretty good
dividend at 4.8% but I noticed it was suspended in 2009 and cut by 50% in 2008.
I would not count on the dividend as steady income w/ their previous history.
GASS suspended its dividend in 2009. Perhaps it is the nature of the business &
times.

GLNG carries a lot of debt and their dividend payout ratio is still pretty
high.

I will put this one on my watch list as Fredrinksen is a smart operator/owner.
This is a sector I eventually want to own along with all my other NG plays.

I generally like to buy below the 200Day MA which is 8% lower for GLNG from the
current price.

I have been building up my cash position waiting for the inevitable market pull
back. One percent yield from my local Credit Union is not very attractive but
as long as the FED continues with their QE, it's probably as good as it gets.

by my calculation of the nav per share on 12/31/90 was $9.72 and they earned
.48 for the 6 months ending 6/30 then the nav should be at least $10.20. now
one thing he said on the conference call was that after the merger each
shareholder would get .85 cents worth of khd stock as a dividend which is
coming out of ttt pockets. i have not verified it but assuming those numbers

revenue growth going forward depends on growth in apartment/housing units and
general inflation.

For holding for the good distribution yield, I'll guess this small, sedate
company with its niche business might work out okay. I'll pass though. For me,
I just don't believe I have the patience now to stay in this just for the
yield. (Yield being the attraction, I presume.)

I continue to hold ENDTF.pk. Less yield, broader diversification, maybe just as
dull.

(Aside: Small, sedate, niche, dull can be very good. My lack of patience and/or
my lack of insight into the company could be the problem here.)

I'd say your analysis is pretty messed up.

You cannot consider "long term investments" to be cash equivalents. They are
not. They could devalue significantly if the equities they own drop a lot. For
example, their TSTR stake can be (is?) a toast.

And IMHO it makes no sense to add "business value" to "liquidation value of
assets". What does that mean in real world at all? Is that like adding sales to
equity and calling it market cap? Either evaluate the company based on earnings
or evaluate it based on balance sheet, you can't just arbitrarily mix the two.

On the philosophical side, investment in Echostar can only be made as a faith
investment in its majority-control holder. If you believe Charles W. Ergen is a
great manager and his goals are aligned with minority shareholders, you buy. If
you don't believe it, you don't buy. In this situation if he wants to screw
you, he has total control to do it in 10 different ways before Sunday.

Echostar. If I remember right, what soured me on Echostar was that these
satellites they own or lease, they fall out of orbit eventually. More quickly
than management - or stockholders anyway -- were led to believe. So when
management announced a sat would unexpectedly have to be replaced, the stock
fell too.

Not sure how this is in Ecostar's depreciation account these days. Maybe too
there's new or better prepared management and company balance sheet. Regardless
though, given my past experience, and my lack of knowledge about satellite
replacement costs, I'll not invest in the company regardless of how much
cash/investments seem to be on the balance sheet.

Re: Consumers' Waterheater Income Fund (CWIF)
http://www.cwif.ca/index_2.html
This is an interesting business. The company trades on the Toronto stock
exchange under the symbol CWI-UN.TO
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CWI-UN.TO

The company makes monthly distribution which reflect 97% income (& 3% return
capital for 2009) generated from the fund. 2010 monthly distributions are
$0.054/month vs $0.10750/month paid in 2009. (NOTE: The Payout Ratio, after
capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions and Sub-metering capital
investment) was approximately 52% for the second quarter of 2010 compared to
117% for the same period in 2009.)

Enbridge Services Inc. (The waterheater rental division) was spun off of
Enbridge Inc. (ENB) and sold to Centrica Canada Limited in 2002.

Long Term debt has been sold by The Consumer Waterheater Operating Trust w/
rates that range from 6%-7% to finance the operation of the waterheater rental
business. The Consumer Waterheater Income Fund (CWIF) owns 100% of the Trust on
behalf of fund unit holders.

This structure appears to be a private venture (no guarantee by any
governmental entity) but closely managed by an independent board of Trustees
that overseas the investments and distributions made by CWIF.

The stock is trading near it's lows at $5.00/share down from a high of
$17.00/share in 2005.

In September 2010 The Trust purchased the "smart metering" business Enbridge
Electric Connection for $23.7 million .

The Consumers' Waterheater Income Fund Announces Agreement to Acquire Enbridge
Electric Connections Inc.
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/The-Consumers-Waterheater-ccn-1091928033.html?x=0
.v=2

The new subsidiary will provision equipment and services under long-term
contracts with customers to allow "smart" "sub-metering and remote measurement
of electricity and water in multi-unit condominium complexes and apartment
buildings in Ontario. The Fund expects the acquisition to be accretive to
EBITDA(1) in 2011. They make a margin on services billed for "smart meters"
installed (and as allowed by the utility regulators). The transaction
approximately doubles the Fund's sub-metering business by combining the two
largest non-utility sub-metering businesses in Canada.
=======================================================================

The one big problem I have with this fund is that for foreign unit holders (ie
U.S. owners) will have a 15% withholding placed on their distributions.

Here is their most recent quarterly financials (Q2 2010):

http://www.cwif.ca/assets/pdfs/Fund%20-%20MDA%20Q2%202010%20Final.pdf

My back of envelope calculations shows a PE of 25x, 20% of expenses are
interest expense and amortization of equipment reflect 55% of revenues. I
assume that the meters and waterheaters have a short depreciation period maybe
7-10 years.

Therefore EBITDA is actually pretty good at 80% of total revenues.

This is still a debt intensive business with large notes due in 2013 and 2014
that will have to be rolled over.

Not too sure how to value the company but they should be able to maintain their
lower 2010 income distribution amounts of $0.054/month ($0.64/year) which
reflects a yield of just under 13% at a market price of $5.01/share.

There is growth potential in their new metering business which in 2011 will
have regulations requiring "sub metering" for apartment buildings and
condominium complexes in Ontario.

Finally, a convertible debenture was funded in June 2010 providing more capital
to the business. Debenture holders have the option to covert to units at a
price of $6.48/share which is 30% higher from the current market price of
$5.01/share. This conversion price would reflect a 10% yield for the income
fund.

It does not make sense to do that because either you sell off the assets -
liquidate - and then you have no business left. Or you run a business and then
the assets are producing and you cannot just dispose of them to give them to
shareholders (or yourself as an owner). Yes, you could return part of cash to
shareholders, but usually you can return maybe less than 50% of the total cash,
since part of it is needed for your business. And obviously you can't just get
rid of payables and receivables that would be liquidated in liquidation.

I guess you could argue that EV = market cap + debt - cash and you are just
substituting market cap with your "expected market cap = 10P/E * some earnings"
in this formula to get RainmakerEV :) This is different from what you did
though, since you did SomethingNotClearWhat = expected market cap + cash -
debt...

Not sure even if you calculated RainmakerEV what this would tell you. Maybe you
could argue that someone could be interested to acquire a company for
RainmakerEV. Not applicable to Echostar that cannot be sold unless its
controlling shareholder says so. Which brings us back to it being a faith

Hi Ken -

Re: CONSUMERS WATERHT UT (CSUWF.PK)
Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Income Fund Inc. (PFD)

CSUWF.PK is the U.S. pink sheet for the Toronto exchange listed company. It is
thinly traded on the pink sheets but does trade some volume on the Toronto
Exchange.

The stock went ex-dividend today at $0.054.

I started a small position today in the company basically looking for the stock
to trade eventually up to the $6.48/share debenture conversion price. I am
looking strictly for the monthly yield.

I sold my Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Income Fund Inc. (PFD) booking my 9%
profit which I originally acquired May 2010.

At the current dividend rate of $0.054/month their payout ratio is 52% which
make their dividend safe until they roll over their LT debt in 2013 (27
months). Their smart meter acquisition s/b accretive to earnings next year and
if they can book some new growth in this area it may help the stock price get
closer to the $6.48/share number.

This is a small bet which I plan to hold for at least 24 months.

IOC has announced well results and as you know, they are disputed. I do not see

My interest in IOC is deep out of the money put's because there is a good

InterOil Corp. - Outperform 2;
Companies Mentioned - IOC
IOC: Agreement for Midsize LNG Plant In Hand and Ample Room for 2nd
Project [IOC092810b_133201]
Analyst(s): Pavel Molchanov
[Industry Classification: Energy/Exploration and Production]

* InterOil has announced the signing of a binding agreement with Energy
World Corp. to build an onshore LNG facility - InterOil's first LNG deal
ever. The plant will be a 2 million ton per year facility (with
potential to expand to 3 million), processing ~1.5 Tcf of gas over a
15-year period. At just ~18% of Elk/Antelope's estimated gas resource
(as of year-end 2009), this isn't the "strategic" LNG project that we've
been expecting by year-end but, rather, an offtake agreement for a
modest portion of InterOil's resource base.

* Hong Kong-based Energy World is an Australian-traded integrated energy
company with core operations in Indonesia and Australia and an emerging
LNG business. Early-stage cap ex is expected to total $910 million. A
key point is that the cap ex will be fully funded by Energy World, and
in return, it will be entitled to a 14.5% "royalty" on the proceeds from
LNG sales. A definitive agreement is set to be finalized this year, with
plant startup targeted for late 2013 - coinciding with the startup of
the condensate stripping JV with Mitsui.

* All-in, InterOil has clearly delivered on its pledge to sign an LNG
deal in 2010. That said, this agreement does not include asset
monetization, e.g., a selldown of the gas resource for upfront cash.
Thus, this is not the strategic partnership that we (and the market) had
been looking for but, rather, an offtake agreement (with InterOil
capturing the vast majority of the resource value) similar to the
proposed floating LNG facility. InterOil remains in talks with the six
different consortiums studying that option, though the Energy World
agreement makes the floating route less necessary.

* Finally, with this deal, the timing of the larger LNG partnership is
now somewhat muddled. We had been expecting an announcement for a 5- to
7-million ton (two-train) facility by year-end, consistent with
management comments. While we would not be at all surprised by such an
agreement this year, a push-out into 2011 is possible. Note, however,
that management reiterated that strategic partnership negotiations
remain on track for an announcement in the near future.

Hi Madharry -

Re.GMX Resources Inc. (GMXR)

Upgrade by MKM Partners w/ $7.00 price target. Jefferies had a downgrade today
to $4.00 from $7.00. Stock was/is a heavy short candidate.

A lot of the analysis is based on what NG prices will be in the future. GMXR
has sufficient hedges in place for the next two years where this is not too
important.

What caught my eye was what they are doing to cut costs and all the CAPEX money
they plan to save by delaying some current spending.

They are going with one rig that they have lease commitments for rather than
two (in a drilling JV area) assigning their other lease to another partner
(possibly XCO) saving $22 million over 24 months. They receive the benefit in
transporting the NG from any wells at this location.

They will cut their CAPEX $25 million to $175 million for 2011.

All in all, they basically should save $50 million next year (or about
$1.00/share) and basically still achieve their previous 28% growth targets. The
stock was/is incredibly cheap.

What's really interesting is that none of the so called analysts discussed
these savings in their reports (at least the ones I read this AM). I posted the
company's three previous press announcements that highlighted these cost
savings items. Management has been involving XCO (who owns contiguous land
parcels) in more of their exploratory drilling deals. They announced one JV w/
them and I expect many more especially something in their NG gathering
business. My guess is that GMXR will be the main NG gather and
transporter/processor for XCO production on all contiguous land parcels.

It will probably be just a hand shake type deal w/ no major announcement. GMXR
has a lot of spare NG gathering capacity which when sold (usually sold by
multi-year contract commitments) will improve their operating profitability.

Basically, things are not as bad for GMXR as the market had priced their stock
last week.

With today's move, my total cost basis is now around break even. That's why you
buy a position over time.

Hi Lazarus -

Re: Armanino Foods of Distinction Inc. (AMNF.PK)

This is an interesting and profitable micro cap company (EV $18 million). They
are probably too small for Kroger to be interested in unless their
manufacturing & distribution systems could be scaled up to cover a much larger
geographical foot print.

The company leases most if not all of their hard assets including buildings and
some of their large processing machinery. One customer accounts for 62% of
their business (could this be Kroger?). I see the value of their company is in
their people, operation(s) and high quality product(s). The company produces
high margin, healthy food products that continue to show good Q-to-Q growth.

Their product(s) carry a high margin so it would be something that a Kroger
could make good money on if integrated into their operations as a private label
line.

That said, they are just way too small to make any significant contribution to
Kroger's bottom line.

This company could be folded into a larger private label "value added" food
business (one of several product lines). The key for Armanino Foods is to
maintain their quality controls as they grow.

I suspect that Kroger has many vendors where they represent the largest
customer. Kroger could simply look at their vendor list, cherry pick the best
(high margin) product lines and build their own private label business. Maybe
this is the approach they will eventually take.

This indeed is an unusual Penny stock selling at a 10 PE and paying a 7%
dividend (including their "annual" special dividends).

The company carries no debt and in fact has CD's worth $500K ($0.02/share)
sitting in the bank (as reported in their Q2 2010 report). Stock issued in 2009
at $0.27/share has already more than doubled based on today's market price.

This is one worth watching. I may even start a preliminary buy once I have had
a chance to try some of their products.

For a penny stock, this one seems to have a lot of value in it. It's like a
Warren Buffet company. Just leave it alone and let the current owners grow the
business.

E K S -- thanks for the feedback.

I recall listening to a guy in 1987 who said he looked for stocks he could buy
and just forget about.

one of them was Franklin Electric

indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=un
efined

the other was Hughes Supply which I think got bought out or taken private - but
had a similar chart.

of course I dont really forget about them - but i generally dont worry about
them too much.

I have two other penny stocks that I am trading/accumulating:

OPCO

and

HSKA

.... and always looking for other great candidates.

CYD - pretty interesting. The problem is they do not show cash flows in their
quarterly press releases. Even the balance sheet is not broken down. And they
don't file SEC 10Qs.

You are right that they are probably not fraudulent: net margins are pretty
low, growth low to nonexistent. The valuation is very low too, so the price
might be attractive, but this is one company that might have future earnings
problems even if its books are totally fair and square. I'll have to think
about it. ;)

CYD has been around for a long time and during most of it's subsistence it has
been a value stock. I agree that it appears to be in a very low margin business
but I don't think it's fraudulent.

re MON not only were they very dependent on the now generic Roundup herbicide
profits but even worse they priced their 2nd generation roundup resistant seeds
too high and are now loosing market share to competitors.

They have to backpaddle on pricing and gain back lost customers (who are pretty
upset about Monsanto now), which won't be easy. Now from a value perspective,
that outfit trades for 20X earnings which is a whole lot to pay for a damaged
franchise nowadays. Now for 30$, I would take a chunk, but 48$/share, i'll
pass.

there is lots of scary research regarding genetically modified products out
there now- enough even for a price conscious consumer like me to avoid them
save for some sugar containing products.

It wouldnt shock me to find that Monsanto becomes the subject of lawsuits like
the tobacco industry regarding what they did or didnt know regarding their
product and what studies they failed to disclose to the public.

GFRE...I thought I'd posted my 9/15 buy, but I don't see it. I took a half

Comparing CYD numbers to TXIC and HRBN, TXIC's recent non-GAAP margins and
growth seem to be consistent with CYD's. Which may mean that TXIC's coming
restatements are not material and they are not cooking the books.

HRBN's margins and growth are way higher, which might be suspicious, although
they serve different market.

Just couple observations.

Re: Magnum Hunter Resources Corpora (AMEX: MHR)
DCP Midstream Partners LP (DPM)

From MHR 8K released 9/27/2010:

On September 16, 2010, Magnum Hunter Resources Corporation (the “Company”)
issued a Press Release announcing that it had entered into a letter of intent
with DCP Midstream Partners, LP, and its sponsor DCP Midstream, LLC, to create
a natural gas gathering joint venture for the gathering of natural gas in West
Virginia and Ohio.

Planned Appalachian Gathering Joint Venture Between Eureka Hunter Pipeline and
DCP Midstream in West Virginia and Ohio
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Planned-Appalachian-Gathering-iw-1940098695.html?
=0&.v=1

From the article:"...Once the initial facility is constructed, the two JV
partners plan to fund the Gathering JV's future capital requirements for
expansion facilities on a 50/50 cost basis. Closing of the proposed joint
venture, which is expected to occur during the fourth quarter of 2010..."

----------------------------------------------------

I like the reoccurring revenues generated from the NG gathering business. One
way to own an interest is to buy either the beaten down E&P companies that have
already built out their gathering lines and/or buy the E&P developer(s) that
have a mainstream JV partner that will help build and operate the gathering
system.

FWIW - Hedged a portion of my recently purchased MHR stock selling the May
$5.00 calls once this news was disclosed. Will lock in a 37% return in 8 months
if called away and allow me to lower my overall cost basis if not.

Hi Paul -

Congratulations SSN's Gary #1-24H is producing oil & gas!

Re: Samson Oil & Gas Limited Sponso (AMEX: SSN)

Press Release Source: Samson Oil & Gas Limited On Wednesday September 29, 2010,
8:30 pm EDT

Gary #1-24H (37% working interest)

The 20-stage frac job on the Gary #1-24H well has been successfully completed.
A total of 2.1 million pounds of proppant was pumped. The isolation plugs that
were set between each of the individual frac stages have all been drilled out
and production tubing is being run in the hole. During the course of drilling
out the plugs, the maximum daily rate, averaged over a 6 hour period, was 2,463
barrels per day. Over this same period, the average gas rate of 1.9 MMCFPD was
measured. This equates to 2,780 BOEPD. Based on our experience with other
Bakken wells, these rates will fluctuate over the next few weeks and then
decline. Over the last 24 hours the well produced 1,636 BOEPD. The Gary #1-24H
well is located in Township 154N, Range 99W, Section 24 in Williams County,
North Dakota.

Can you recommend any other books (or articles) on the subject?
