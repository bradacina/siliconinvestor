Agree that the price or MSFT is not quite cheap (low 20's would look good to
me). I just picked some up too, swapping some ORCL shares, for pretty much the
same reason as everybody else.

Having said that, with a company like MSFT 15% seems like a modest goal. I'm
expecting (and even hoping) that it will go down further, and I'll buy more if
it does. But if it goes up, I'll hang on for the long term ride. IMO, this is
too good a company to let go of lightly when you do get a decent price.

when i made my previous post here about buying the stock i was picking up
shares as low as .015

well it turns out that shortly thereafter the vice-president bought out the
presidents shares in a private transaction for 29 cents per share and filed a

obviously insiders thought the stock was worth considerably more than a penny

Mark: <<MSFT 15% seems like a modest goal>>If the market continues as it has,
you're certainly right. A shift in preference to large cap, high quality
companies could carry quite aways if the runs low-quality stuff have had are
any indication. My targets on a lot of stuff have been way too modest...several
have gone up 50+% after I sold for 50+% profit. Nevertheless, I'll likely stick
with the target since Microsoft's size, a generally longer PC upgrade cycle and
competitive threats from open source [Linux] will likely constrain secular
growth to high-single, low double digit levels if that [YAHOO shows 5yr growth
@10% and that's usually optimistic]. With MCD, we saw what happens when the
market comes to grips with the shift from high-growth to low-growth. A similar
thing is going on with MSFT but the transition is much smoother [so far] which
is why MSFT hasn't really participated in the rally. There's already a 'quality
premium' built into the shares. My 15% upside target would be 25X 05Est and ~34
times S&P core earnings which have been running about 25% below the analyst
version. While the market has shown the capacity to take 'em a lot higher, I
see nearterm gains above that as stretching it from a value perspective.

MSFT's ROE has in the last years slid down to 15% and is very unlikely to
recover. The company is huge and it is quite difficult to find high-ROE areas
for expansion. Assuming the ROE remains at 15% level, the estimated annual
return is ~5%, which is not a buy. For me it is really a sell.

Your mileage may vary, since IMHO techs are on a way to yet another bubble. Who

Spekulatius, I've had XOM on my watch list for several months.

Almost always, I am looking for relatively low entry a points. That is, I want
to buy stocks when they are closer to yearly lows than to their 52-week high.
XOM has been an exception, in that I have watched this stock with a view to
establishing a small position ONLY after a breakout to new HIGH. My idea was
that if this behemoth stock could move in such a fashion, then a large
contingent of institutional investors must have come to the belief (rightly or
wrongly)that oil is going higher or will stay high, and that these institutions
must believe that conservative, boring XOM has a good possibility of being a
beneficiary of that. I will bet then that this move in XOM will continue for a
while, since if I'm right in why the stock might be at new highs, I might be
right that this positive forward view of XOM's prospects will prevail for a
while, drawing more big investors into the stock.

XOM seems, if I am correct, to be replacing its depleting assets. If so, then
XOM is growing its assets (book value) and its financial resources. So seeing
how XOM has traded the past few years might be a reasonable way to see where
XOM might again trade in good times. I'll guess if the current upswing in the
stock continues, there might not be that much capital gain to extract - maybe
five or six points. OTOH, if things go awry, there's also not much the stock
would drop (maybe).

Here's a five-year chart:

Jurgis: I'm not really an ROE investor but I decided to break it down and see
why MSFT's ROE is declining. ROE breaks down into NetIncome/Revenues X
Rev/assets X Assets/Equity. The most important part of that to me is the 1st
componant, NetIncome/Revenues, since deteriorating margins are definitely a
sign of problems. Looking out over 10 years I found margins have actually
improved with net margin up from 24.5% 10 years ago to 31% last year. The steps
along the way like gross margin, operating margin & EBT margin are also stable
to improving. The main culprit to the decline in ROE appears to be the growth
in assets since there's no net debt....and the asset that's really grown is
cash from $3.6B in 94 to $49B in 03. So the problem is they're generating and
retaining too much cash. The solution appears to be to gradually give it back
by increasing dividends. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see too much
cash as a deal killer.

You may want to consider "altering" the calculation of ROE a bit from Net
Income/Shareholders' Equity to Operating Income/Shareholders' Equity.

By evaluating "Operating Income" you exclude for the most part the effects of a
company's capital structure and you get a "truer" picture of how the company is
operating.

Also, since MSFT has a cash hoarde, when comparing MSFT to other SW companies,
it gives you a better number for comparison purposes.

Jurgis, I don't think unadjusted ROE is a good way of looking at MSFT, unless
you think the current high levels of cash are essential to their business. IMO,
the cash has been kept as a cushion for the worst case scenarios in the anti
trust actions. As that winds down, I think you'll see MSFT start to put that
cash to work, either in dividends or in acquisitions (or both). Once the cash
is distributed or put to work, ROE shoots up - assuming that MSFT isn't foolish
enough to invest it in low ROE businesses.

Meanwhile, as Bob point out, their enviable margins have remained pretty firm.
Not to mention that the stock is currently trading at about 21 times 2002 free
cash flow and 19 times 2002 operating cash flow. That certainly leaves some
room to go down, but it's hardly what I would consider a bubble level.

FWIW, I do agree that most techs are well into bubble land at this point.

Mark and all,

Thanks for responses.

Though you are right that the cash hoard distorts MSFTs ROE, I don't agree that
there is any guarantee that this hoard will be successfully employed. So far
MSFTs new ventures (MSN, Xbox, etc.) were all money losers and there has not
been any indication that things will improve in near future. The most positive
development for MSFT would be large penetration of cellphone market. I have not
idea whether this will happen.

The best thing for MSFT now would probably be to increase the dividend.

OK, I played with numbers a bit. If we subtract 40B cash from equity, we have
~27B adjusted equity. Then ROadjustedE is ~35%. If you assume that MSFT can
continue ROadjustedE of 35% on the 27B adjusted equity, then you would have a
good annual 20% annual return. I would be more conservative and assume only 25%
adjusted ROE going forward. Which still puts MSFT in the "hold" area with ~9%
expected annual return.

ROE, margin discussion regarding MSFT:

I'll broaden the general discussion a bit here. So far (past few days), it
seems to be about whether ROE or profit margins are the better way to analyze
MSFT. Each way of analysis seems to have a problem, and for it, a possible
adjunct. So for ROE, to get around debt or cash, ROA might be an alternative,
and for profit margins, operating margins might work as good or better, someone
has suggested.

These ratios though can't really be applied, imo, out of context. That is, to
actually make a screening decision (ignore the stock/do further research) or a
buy/sell decision using these ratios, the margin analysis and/or the return
analysis have to be placed in a time continuum and/or in a price continuum. And
the analyst has to establish a standard: just what is a "good" ROE or a "good"
or "good enough" margin for the company being analyzed?

It's easy enough to place the margins and the returns in a time continuum. For
MSFT, in the past ten years it's never been below 24% (yearly average), it's
been as high as 41%, and Yahoo shows it now as 30%. (I don't have access to
historical operating margins, so I use net profit margins.) In my opinion, by
my criteria, MSFT has outstanding margins - both relatively (historically) and
absolutely (compared to any other company). But is the company a buy at current
price? I use a model that relates margins to current price. (In some past
picks, I have mentioned I'm buying a certain stock because of its high margins
in relation to its current price, or because its margins are only okay/good,
but very good when looked at in the context of its low price, according to the
model.) Using this model, MSFT is grossly undervalued at its current price.
However...

As I've mentioned a few times before over the past few years,I have a
mathematical model that relates current ROE to stock price. I use it
frequently, especially with companies that have hard assets. (Some art is
involved here though, because I don't have a quantitative way to adjust for
companies that have lots of debt or fluctuating debt.) On an absolute basis,
MSFT's current ROE, about 16.5%, per Yahoo, is shrug-your-shoulders okay. When
I put that number into my formula, it says I would be paying too much for this
kind of return for a stock priced around $27/sh. (Sometimes this happens when I
check ROE for software companies). One big alert for me though is when I look
at relative ROE here: there's been a sharp decline in ROE that started about
three years ago. Where in early-mid '90's ROE was above 25.8%, it dropped below
20% in '01 to about 16% where it's remained.

Regarding MSFT, since I'd strongly be tempted to buy it based on my margin
analysis but almost strongly avoid on ROE analysis, I'm conflicted and
paralyzed about the decision (-g-). I'd have to weigh other factors-- MSFT's
cash hoard, dominance, and aggressive expansion possibilities into any market
they want, or perhaps base a decision on where the current stock price is
compared to where it might trade (technical analysis), or something else.

Anyway, jmo.

DECEMBER 29, 2003

Energy Stocks Are Finally Showing Some Get-Up-And-Go

During the 1970s energy boom, Los Angeles money manager Robert L. Rodriguez had
nearly half of his portfolio in oil and gas stocks. He sold the last of them in
1981 and didn't buy another for nearly two decades. Now, the chief executive of
$5.2 billion money-management firm First Pacific Advisors Inc. is back to
studying rig rates and natural-gas-price forecasts. "It's the [only] stock
sector [where] we're deploying capital," he says.

Rodriguez is one of a growing number of investors who believe that [energy
prices] -- especially those of [natural gas] -- may be in for a [sustained
upswing]. Demand for natural gas from new power plants and residential
customers has grown by about 1% a year for the past four years and should climb
higher with the rebounding economy. But while natural-gas production in the
U.S. is expected to rise slightly, to 20 trillion cubic feet in 2004, that will
still fall about 16% short of demand, according to the U.S. Energy Dept.
Natural gas now sells for nearly $7 per million BTUs, more than twice its level
for much of the 1990s.

Spekulatius, I'm looking now at HMC. Too late now perhaps? Stock's moved up
roughly from your April post of around $16 to almost $22, so that's a nice
percentage gain! I shoulda checked GM when it was closer to lows, and I was
certainly wrong not to buy TM (Toyota) when I considered it after it showed on
new lows list. I was scared off from Ford because of its very high debt load
and to me, tired product line. But what you said about HMC in April might still
apply: "A PE of less than 10 is reasonable, given the stellar LT
performance,attrctive products and the low leverage."

Regarding HMC: In past years it has often sold for higher p/e's, higher
p/sales, and higher p/book values that it is now. When I crank HMC's numbers
into my ROE and margin models, it shows up as borderline buys in both models.
So I'm considering making a small buy.

Toyota's my favorite company because of their manufacturing prowess: It's
simply spectacular, imo.
I like Honda because of their expertise in motors, which has allowed them
extensions from motorcycles to cars to boats and grass cutters. Both companies
have the same profit margins and operating margins, according to Yahoo.

$4 dividend would be one time event, so it does not change the 10 year annual
returns by much. If you got it right now, it would be equivalent to buying MSFT
with ~15% discount. Which makes the 10 year annual expected return only 10% vs.
8.4%. But thanks for pointing out this omission.

Yes, I am aware of at least couple of battles that Microsoft is fighting right
now and winning some of them would lead to additional revenues and income.
However, it is not obvious that Microsoft will win and furthermore Microsoft is
so large that some of the wins will have only a marginal effect on Microsoft's
earnings. MSFT has the same problem as BRK - size. They need huge wins to have
any significant effect on earnings.

Overall, I would not bet that MSFT can grow earnings in any significant way. I
am pretty much looking at the company as a cash cow. If a cow grows - fine,
that's a bonus. :)

below book value (unusual with insurance companies that aren't going bankrupt-
but I could see why for GFR with the aforementioned negatives) - and because
Mr. Lindner keeps buying and buying shares in the open market. It's a bet that
Mr. Lindner will enrich himself eventually somehow, and MAYBE the stockholders
who are along for the ride.

Asides:

Still holding XPRESA and BOYD in trucking business. BOYD might finally turn
around if it can capitalize on the boom in steel that seems to be occurring.

Fwiw, cutting back exploratory position in MMS by half. I should close the
position entirely - I don't know the business, and the stock no longer looks
like a value to me.

I've taken on just a little EPIQ. High p/e, high p/bk, high p/sales,
not-so-great ROE. Offsetting this has been high profit margins, record earnings
and revenue. The company prospers from bankruptcies, so some folks consider it
a play on a falling economy or the ramifications of increasing business and
consumer debt.

re Honda HMC -
I agree that HMC is one of the better buys right now in the car sector. I
missed also on the upside since I got shaken out as the stock hit my stop loss
after I bought.

HMC seems to have very good products in the car market - the Honda Civic is

Marc Fortier, yes nice turnaround in Nissan. Seems to be throughout the product
line(s). Consolidated engines, platforms, etc. for cost savings. Product design
is strong (Altima, Z car, truck). I'll guess at current p/e, that's all built
into the price though.

On one level level, I have a problem with all the car manufacturer stocks -
I've looked at them at lower levels and didn't bite, and now at higher prices I
am considering buying? It's a barrier for me. For NSANY it's exacerbated
because it's one I bought, it rose, and I concluded it was a sale at $11, which
is less than half of it's now $23.22 price. There's no shortage of cars or car
companies, so it's hard for me to see NSANY as a great bargain at $23.+ , and
that view is colored by my sale.

Spekulatius. Nothing really stands out among the car companies that I see. The
stocks have all moved up, and each company and each stock has advantages and
disadvantages compared to their competitors.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=tm+nsany+hmc+gm+f+vc

I'm less partial to GM and F because of their strong moves already and the
large debt they have. I like GM's low p/e and improving product line up.

I'm a fan of TM's manufacturing and cost controls. Honda has a lower p/sales
and p/e. OTOH, I have a feeling (unsupported by facts) that HMC is the
perennial underdog in its home market.

Still HMC is a fierce competitor. I recall when Honda was primarily a
motorcycle company and Yamaha or Suzuki decided to challenge Honda's motorcycle
supremacy by turning out more models. Once Honda got wind of this they upped
THEIR model introductions and the frequency of introductions 'til the
impertinent upstart cried ouch. HMC were not about to lose market share.

As China goes from bicycles to motorcycles, Honda will be there. And then for
these people as they upgrade to cars, trucks, vans, etc. Of course, in those
markets all the carmakers will compete.

For a future battleground, I am again seeing (reading about) the next market
Toyota and Honda might attack. That is airplane manufacturing. I've read where
TM might be able to make available small inexpensive commuter planes in such
quality and quantity that they could dramatically change the way people
consider flying. HMC Yahoo thread describes results of Honda's efforts. Here
then is something possibly exciting, something that perhaps goes beyond the
normal disdain one might have for buying a car company stock. (Not that
investing in Boeing or airline companies has provided long-term winners -g-)

Wallace Rivers, sold most of my DRD today. I don't hold much hope of a price
increase by the buyers. Chairman Cutie can argue the takeout price is the same
as what he was selling his shares for last year, and he could say the business
hasn't much improved since then. (His $17/sh. sales were of option exercises of
0.58/sh., so easy enough for him to sell gobs at $17.)

In my opinion though, it's a take-under. DRD's ubiquitousness in NYC gives it a
lock in that market. (In past, that's been reflected in DRD's good margins
compared to national chains.) Very difficult for national competitors or
mom-n-pops to challenge DRD in NYC given the real estate aspects - the costs
and DRD's locations and DRD's size and focus. If one believes that NYC will
come back economically, then DRD must (maybe) be a beneficiary of that.

Sorry I didn't consider the linkage of DRD as regards the strong flu season.
(Seems simple and maybe obvious enough now, but with my diverse stocks, focus
for me is a problem -g-). Had I been aware of your idea and interest in DRD, I
would like to believe I would have upped my position further. Ah well, we move

LOL, Grommit! I got a laugh at those "automobile" comparisons - my joke's been

Aside: For those who don't know, RCRC, among other things, makes collectable
toy cars. I still don't see in this year's annual report the volume numbers,
but I'll guess again that RCRC is the largest "car" seller in the USA in terms
of volume - beating Toyota, Ford and GM -gg-.

I took an exploratory position in RCRC somewhat later (read at higher
prices)than you guys after it was discussed here. I'm still holding it. P/e is
reasonable, there's positive news in last quarter's press release. They are
trying to broaden and further diversify their business; I'm hoping the
integration of Learning Curve, acquired this year, will add value to RCRC
stockholders.

Grommit, I sold 1/2 of very small position in LDL recently. The stock

About clothes retailers: I've given up on GADZ, have taken my lumps, and closed
the position for losses in all purchased lots. Company is still in search of a
workable business model, but now they're saying bankruptcy might be an option.
Gamblers could enter here and maybe do okay if there's a January effect this
year. I suspect much of selling now is coming from people like me who will just
call it a day and take the tax loss write-off.

In the past few years I have owned and followed many companies right into their
bankruptcy - I have had more companies go belly-up on me I daresay than anyone
else on the thread. But now with '03 looking to be a good year for stocks, I'm
just not interested in the pain and suffering that goes along with following

Canon: Up From Y30 Dividend Last Year; Cites Earnings Hopes
Thursday December 25, 1:34 am ET

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Canon Inc. said Thursday it plans to pay an annual dividend
of Y50 a share for the fiscal year
ending Dec. 31, up from a payout of Y30 in the previous year.
The move comes as Canon now expects record earnings on both a parent and group
basis this fiscal year, the Japanese maker of cameras and printers said.
This is also an upgrade from its earlier plan announced in July to pay an
annual dividend of Y30 this year, Canon said. The increased dividend was
expected after Canon forecast record group earnings in October.
Canon expects its group net profit to jump 38% to Y263 billion in 2003, which
would mark a record for the fourth year running.

A Canon spokesman said earlier this month the company is on track to meet its
net profit target.

Canon is benefiting from its focus on a limited number of high-margin products,
such as digital multifunction copiers
and high-performance digital cameras. Cost-cutting at its manufacturing
operations has also helped shore up its
bottom line.

Suppose the tax loss = book loss and is fully usable to offset $33M of future

I see that small-bank stocks have mostly continued to do well in the market
since I looked at them here a few months ago.

I erred in selling too quickly my pick of Korean-American bank PUBB. It's moved
up, and now has received a buyout offer from its local neighbor, and Korean-Am.
bank too, HAFC.

I'll bet again with HAFC, that among the many Korean
immigrants/Korean-Americans in Southern California, there's a decent propensity
for many to do business with a bank focused on their specific needs.

HAFC isn't really inexpensive based on some numbers I see such as ROA, p/book,
and p/sales. However, HAFC will now dominate its niche, and it's easy for me to
entertain an expectation that HAFC will continue to prosper over the next few
years.

Although so many bank stocks have done so well this year, it's my opinion that
for me, I feel I have got my best results with banks by trying to have a long
term view of their business prospects and by holding the the stocks for the

I've started a very small buy of HAFC; I expect to average into the position,

profitable next year, according to Yahoo. Management has announced a small

I remember four, five years ago we used to go through the ritual at the end of
the year reviewing old picks, previewing the new year. I am sure I'm not the
only one really starved for ideas in this market, and kind of at a loss for
what to do. I am holding a lot of cash, part by design, part due to lack of
ideas that I'm willing to put a lot of money into.

Could we structure this this way? Two questions. Whats the stock in your
portfolio most likely to be a major winner in the next 12 months (though it may
have the kind of risk where you wouldn't make it a big position), and second
what is the stock you'd put 25% of your portfolio into if you had to pick one?

My swing for the fences pick would be UAIR (yeah, it makes me want to throw up
too, which is part of the appeal - that and that 90% of Wall Street doesn't
even know it exists - start by just looking at the market cap and then look at
the market cap of other airline majors - I think it really may be that simple,
though obviously I've done more work than that - there are obviously big
negatives) and my favorite holding is (still) ANF - would have said the same
last year on that one, and probably 3 years ago too... I will admit I am not as
confident in it as I was at this time a year ago, but the valuation vs. quality
is very appealing if the wheels aren't falling off, which is the big question
and maybe getting bigger.

Last year at this time I had four the caliber of ANF, and many many speculative
potential doubles and triples, many of which worked out quite nicely. I was
more than fully invested then. This year the pickings feel really thin. Made a
lot of money in '03, and I see this as a time to be really cautious looking
6-12 months ahead.

Would love to hear how others respond to this with their own ideas. Maybe there
are more ideas out there than we think there are if we each put just our best
ones on the table. If you can't find ANYTHING that is a potential double or a
sensible and safe big position say so - that would be good for us all to know
too. (To fully disclose I don't have anything near 25% of my money in ANF and
UAIR is not a big position - thats the kind of market this is, even my two
picks I don't have that kind of confidence in). I don't see a thing undesirable
about holding a lot of cash right now.

Happy holidays all.

James -

Interesting question. I agree with you on the difficulty in finding stocks in
this market. I also agree on ANF - Hollister especially worries me. I'm
starting to think that there are problems there that management is unwilling or
unable to face up to.

Re your question, here are a couple of stocks that I think will be long term
(3-5 years) winners but don't expect to double in the next year:

DGX (Quest Diagnostics): The leading provider of lab services and diagnostic
testing, and the leader in the industry. They are an exceptionally well run
company and they have a nice razor and blade type of business. I've dealt with
them in the past (both at work and as a patient) and was very favorably
impressed. Strong cash flow, decent balance sheet, options are an issue.
They've been hurt a little by the bad economy over the last couple of years,
and if employment improves their results should benefit.

FDS (Factset Research): Provides integrated financial information services to
investment banks, brokerages, etc. Based on the numbers, I think this is one of
the most exciting companies out there but unfortunately, unlike Quest
Diagnostics, I have had no direct dealings with them. I would be interested in
hearing from anyone who has. Gross margin runs in the mid 60's, ROIC is in the
mid 20's, the balance sheet is pristine, options are a problem. They are not
quite as good as vintage Oracle or Microsoft - growth rates in the 20's or
30's, depending on what you're looking at - but the profitability, cash flow
and balance sheet are in the same league.

The closest I can come to a "swing for the fences" is LNCR (Lincare Holdings) a
provider of home respiratory therapy. This company has been putting up Coca
Cola-like numbers, but they are going to be hit hard by the new Medicare
pricing rules, and the stock is down over 25% as a result. I'm not so concerned
about that, LNCR provides a service that saves money overall and I'm reasonably
confident that things will work themselves out by 2005 when the rules take
effect. My problem with LNCR is that, quite frankly, I don't completely trust
management. Don't have the time to go into great detail, but a condensed
version is; they have (IMO) practiced selective disclosure in the past, and
they are structured as a holding company with hundreds of independent units
whose results are rolled up into theirs. They are quite probably a completely
legitimate operation, but I don't have the confidence to buy a lot. If they are
legit, I believe they are a tremendous bargain right now.

As for what stock I'd put 25% of my portfolio in, for me that would require not
only safety, but a "back up the truck" depressed price. I don't see the latter
anywhere, but if I had to do it I'd consider MCD, JNJ, or BRK, all of which I
consider to be very safe and reasonably priced.

Swing for the fences in HLSH and bet the farm on BRKB, both for obvious reasons
to thread readers here, I think. BRKB is my largest current position but only
mid-single digits in a very diversified portfolio.

I am fully invested, but mostly in stocks that had big runups already this

Which stock is likely to be a major winner over the next 12 months?

I don't see any major winners. I hope that I have a number of potential 20% to
30% gainers. Picks in my top tier prospects are ANF, KBH, KWD, BEC, WM, HELE,
RCRC. The next level are BEL, YELL, TOY, and two which I may purchase next week
- JCI, TTC. Nothing great here, times are very much tougher.

....................................................

What is the stock you'd put 25% of your portfolio into if you had to pick one?

My largest holding right now is ACAS, as it has been for the past year or two.
Last year, at $23, it had great potential, and I posted about it here a few
times. When it was at $18 a little earlier, it was the fattest pitch I ever
saw. (I managed to reduce my average basis to $20.50.) At $23, the dividend
yield was 12%. Add the 26% cap gain over the past year, and it's still under
the NASDAQ gain for the year. Jeez. It ain't fair, I say!

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=ACAS&t=2y&l=on&z=m&q=b&c=

The short attack has come and gone, with the shares short dropping every qtr
now. The issue, if any, is still the valuation of its portfolio investments.
ACAS hired a respected outside valuation firm to audit 25% of the valuations
per quarter, and the insider buying continues (even at today's prices). The
dividend growth is unbelievable:

http://www.american-capital.com/investor_relations/dividends/dividends.cfm
http://www.american-capital.com/investor_relations/dividends/dividend_yield.cfm
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=ACAS

I think it's a safe "hold" at today's price, meaning that I think the stock
price will not likely drop. The dividend yield at next year's $2.93 dividend
(forecast by Wachovia Securities) at today's $29, is 10%. If the yield drops to
a more likely 9%, the price would rise to around $32.50. That's a 10% dividend
yield, and a 10% cap gain, for a 20% return. No home-run anymore, but a restful
place to park my money, until I find something better. As I reduce my holdings
of it...

Disclosure - I bought way, way, way too much and have been selling some
recently, trying to reduce my holdings to only "too much". Sorry about the
cheerleading.

PS And look at REIT performance as compared to the NYSE. This graph ignores the
REIT dividends of 8% or so.

For years people have been saying that interest rates would rise, and to get

there's no place to reinvest safely. :o( Help. I hate holding cash.

I haven't tallied the results for the year yet, but barring a cataclysmic
event, it will turn out to have been a phenomenal year.

As far as selections for 2004: TRCI, CCL, MRO, APFC, RTWI, IOM (yes, a former
high-flyer, blast from the past), PMSI, WSCI, have all made my cut and are in
my portfolios.

I don't really see much difference in the number of opportunities, although I
agree the market is pricing in far more perfection than I'm comfortable with.

As far as potential doubles for 2004: TRCI, APFC, IOM, PMSI, WSCI could qualify
as far as I'm concerned.

CCL and MRO could return 50%.

But, then again, I could be hallucinating about all of them!

James and all, My largest holdings are ALVR and EONC, both over 25%.

EONC has a better chance of doubling in 2004, it is a small software company
that had 6 quarters sequential revenue growth, and 3 quarters of profit.
Chairman/CEO David Lee bought a lot of shares couple months ago, he is a smart
successful businessman. At just above $3 and profitable, It is almost like a
non-expiring option, just time value alone is good enough to justify the buy.
They are successful in US FAA, military and Korean market, opened an office in
Beijing couple months ago and now working on some big deals with large telecom
providers in China. If they successfully get one big Chinese carrier to sign
up, a double is feasible.

Now comes my daring point - even ALVR still has a small chance to double again,
if the business continue to do well and no big players jump in to the
competition. Many know that I recommended here in Feb 2003 and bought big at
$1.86, it is $10.50 now and I am holding majority of the shares. This could be
the "next big thing" stock. Never buy after my post, do you own homework and
decide.

Happy New Year to all!

Jim Clarke. Been reflecting on your post. On the surface, very simple question,
"What's your best idea(s)?" Framing that question by % gain possibility
(double) and time frame (year 2004) has got me really spinning and stymied
though.

Once again I report that I don't see much correlation between what I might
consider my "good" stock ideas and my results as measured by % gain in those
stocks. Often what I consider my best ideas at the time turn out to be not so
good. The ones that actually turn out to be high percentage gainers seem to
surprise me by coming out over time (And that's more than 12 months) from
nowhere. This is not an unusual occurrence to Ben Graham followers of course.

One non-tech, non-fad/non-momementum example would be cigar-butt CNGR discussed
here May & Nov 2001:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/msg_multireplies.gsp?msgid=15852538

Who'da thunk this at the time:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=CRMT&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=

(Same company, CNGR=CPRT. Name and ticker changed. I am still in.)

If I try to look at how my good or best ideas correlate to weighting (i.e.
large holding) in my portfolio, it still doesn't work for me. Since I have many
stock ideas, and I'm wrong many, many times, I don't say to myself, "This
is/are my best idea/ideas, I'll overweight here". Rather, my larger weightings
are built up over time as the stock of an improving business just compounds. Or
else if I make a large purchase, I do it in stages over time - sometimes over
more than one year. Sometimes I'll trim an outsize position- so in just looking
at the portfolio now (instantaneous view), I can't quantitatively relate large
holding to my best or good ideas.

If I understand the Bill Miller speech, he would suggest that stocks already
reflect what's going to happen in '04; we need to be considering now how
stockholders in late '04 will be considering what will happen to their stocks
in '05. It just seems to me that 12-month-to-a- double window is too short. On
the one hand, I could see that that's a good criterion though - you want
people's best ideas, and that considerably narrows the field of choices and
makes people carefully and deeply consider their suggestions (as compared to
asking what stocks might double in two or maybe in three years). But back on
the other hand, as I said about SINA,et. al., it's very difficult to recognize
really good opportunities a-priori. There are many suggestions put forward by
good posters here for stocks that might double. (And some of the suggested
stocks will double or more imo.) It just will be very hard though, imo, to
convince somebody else here to buy in - no matter what stock is mentioned or
how few are recommended. Of course, otof (on the other foot - I've run out of
hands -gg-) all that's needed is ONE purchase of one stock that works, and the
exercise will have been worthwhile.

"Whats the stock in your portfolio most likely to be a major winner in the next
12 months (though it may have the kind of risk where you wouldn't make it a big
position), and second what is the stock you'd put 25% of your portfolio into if
you had to pick one?"

Interesting questions, Jim. I note that neither requires the pick to be a
"value" stock; the first one requires the stock to be already owned; the second
has no time frame, or performance spec.

The stock I own that I think most likely to double in the next year is IMGG.
The stock I have 25% in is FARO. I recommended it here at $2+ nine months ago.
I consider it the "gorilla" in its growing niche. However, I couldn't recommend
buying it above $20, although there is a reasonable shot at near $40 next year,
and $50-100 in 3 years.

My outlook is colored by the CAPEX comment in the following link:

http://biz.yahoo.com/smart/031223/dec2003yardenipundwatc_6.html

I am taking that comment at face value. If there is a major 2004 CAPEX tax
break applying to all purchases from the smallest to the largest company, any
company run with half a brain (and profitable, I presume) will be planning now
to push a load of 2005 CAPEX into 2004 - and related stocks should have great
years. Therefore, you should expect a "hole" in 2005 CAPEX no matter who gets
elected.

This could end up being like Y2K in 1999. stealing from future periods. If so,
you want to get out of any CAPEX sensitive stocks in 2004, and probably the
whole market as well - as 2005 might be rather unpleasant.

Timba,
As we all know, this board is well-stocked with investors who do great stock
research and freely share the best values (as defined for themselves) they find
with us. Starting with James and continuing with all who have responded to his
questions and others who haven't yet responded.

I, for one, don't wait for anything resembling consensus before buying many of
these stocks and they make up a sizable portion of both my current portfolio
(including James' ANF, Dale's MAXF and HLSH, Paul's FTS, your RGR, etc.) and my
best trades of the year(???'s AAPL, Steve168's PCYC, ??'s DYN, Tomato's KDUS,
???'s BEAV, Dale's FBR, Spekulatius' TVIN, ET, and more). I apologize for any
attributions that I botched or don't remember - some likely were picked by more
than one of you. Those are all just this year - past years have been similar
although with fewer big winners in a single year. Anyway, its obvious that I
owe a lot to all of you - THANKS!

As for my picks in response to the questions:

- a potential big winner in 2004: WBR - they own, operate, license Wyndham
hotels and have been refinancing, asset-selling, cost-cutting, etc. to stay a
step away from BK since the post-9/11 (& poor economy) travel bust. They trade
at less than 0.1 PS, still have a lot of debt but have gotten some breathing
space until further maturities. If travel continues to rebound, their stock
could also or they could be a buy-out for a bigger hotel company.

- my biggest position (though not 25 %) - CAKE Cheesecake Factory has been my
biggest consistent holding for at least 5 years. It's a growth stock but I like
the way they do it. All growth funded from cash flow, all restaurants busy
always and they never need to advertise. I don't know anyone who doesn't like
the place and wouldn't go more often if it wasn't so damn busy. It's not cheap
and would take a hit if they stumble but management seems to execute their plan
year after year. I think the flagship chain can still double or more in size
(there are only 73).

I'd say investing now would be a two-step process. The first is deciding to
invest. As opposed to making a market call that the market is too expensive, or
that it's time to batten down the hatches, go short, raise cash, etc. If
somebody does have funds to invest and decides to invest, there seems to have
been many stocks mentioned here (by me and by others), at least one or two of
which ought to fit within every particular style and most people's circles of
competence. That would be my opinion, but of course, I don't know anyone's
particular circumstances or proclivities, or experience, so I could be quite
wrong. Maybe other people's risk profile or style box is/are too circumscribed
for them to be buying now. Time will tell whether there are good buys now still
left in the market. Most stocks have moved up so I can understand anyone's
reluctance to commit funds to specific stocks, especially if the person keeps a
very concentrated portfolio.

As for me, so far this month, I have made purchases in 41 different companies,
and sales in 19. And the month's not over -g-.

Five buys were made in a dividend reinvestment program:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ATO,ALD,ANAT,CDX,CAG&d=s

Another 24 stock purchases were of stocks mentioned on this thread. (I might be
off by one or two that I might've mentioned on other SI threads.)

p+aig+huwhy.pk++hyc+hmc+brlc+ovnt+cl+epiq+gfr+tsic+mton+pco+bli&d=v4

I've made buys and sells of two stocks. I mentioned I sold some ANF, and I also
recently said I bought back most shares. I purchased more SHRP, and then sold
those shares on the company's positive news announcement.

The remaining ten stock buys I've not mentioned because they are either
thinly-traded and I'm still building a position, or they're just outright
speculations that I don't see any appropriate place to discuss and/or they're
stocks I'm not sure how long I'm willing to make a commitment to. Two examples
of the latter are ONT (speculation on enhanced versatile disk video compression
that China will use) and speculation SRDX. (It makes the coating used on J&J's
apparently problem stents.)

I closed OMX and RHT (received buyout offers); also for most shares of DRD. I
took my lumps in GADZ, and closed that position. I gave up on ALO after the
announcement of a lawsuit filing. (I might re-enter as I come to understand the
situation.) I trimmed positions (just a little) in the following stocks (no
particular order):

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?s=CSG,MMS,OTL,NTE,FAF,AIR,PPE,AAII,TYC,MAXS,LDL&d
v4

There was one sale made when I tried a short-term swing trade. Profitable for
pizza money, but I'm embarrassed that I succumbed to temptation to try such a
thing.

-----------------------
I hope I never get the temptation or opportunity to invest 25% of my monies in
one stock. I can't imagine why I'd want to do such a thing, other than greed.

I haven't a clue which stock in the universe of stocks is likely to be a double
in 2004. My guess would be colored by my enthusiasm, and my enthusiasm is a
function of my latest stock buys. I'll guess TSIC because it's among my latest
buys, it's come down quickly to be a two-dollar stock (cigar butt?); it could
pop in a January Effect; and it seems (but I have no facts to support this
rubric) that it is sometimes "easier" for a $2 stock to go to $4, than for a
$20 stock to get to $40. PERY (another marketer/manager of clothing brands)
turned themselves around - maybe TSIC can too. Also, since we're not talking
risk-adjusted return in this game, I can blithely skip over the possibility
that the current stock valuation indicates TSIC might have a serious chance at
self-destruction.

Steven Emmerich, Good to know that you used my PCYC pick and it is one of your
best trades in 2003. That surely encourage me to continue posting my best ideas
here. You all know I don't just come up with a stock every week. Usually I give
out one idea every 3 months - since I would do a lot of research and wait for
the fundamental and technical(chart) both indicating the best time to buy.

My once every 3 months buy is EONC now at $3.4. It is a small undiscovered
software company with 6 quarters sequential revenue growth, 3 profitable
quarters with positive cash flow, 40% insider ownership, Chairman/CEO bought
about 230K shares early 2003 on top of his large holdings, Opened office in
China and working on deals with the largest Chinese telecom providers (telecom
is the fastest growing, most profitable industry in China). Any deal to get
EONC associated with a giant Chinese telecom would trigger some "China effect
buying". I think it is coming, sooner or later. A turnaround profitable
software company selling at just above $3? It is like buying a non-expiring
options, just time value is worth the buy. People may say that it already went
up so much, but the fact is nobody had a chance to buy big amount of shares
under $1, people (myself included) questioned EONC's survival just a year ago.
The business turned around (luck and effort) and they are now on the growth
path. I don't think $3 is expensive.

Deeply undervalued stocks are all gone. But many people still have cash on the
sidelines, growth at reasonable price is the way to make money in this market
and I think EONC is a good "growth at reasonable price" play. Of course do you
own homework before buying. I don't recommend any one to buy because you may
have a different criteria, I am "burning this idea with time stamp on SI" for
myself so I can review in the future.

The market is a little bit like the beginning of the "Exuberant run" in
1999/2000. NASDAQ actually went from already slightly overvalued 3000 to 5200
in couple months. The investing public really have a short memory. I am not
sure how high this run will be but I do have a proprietary model (developed
over 10 years) that has a good chance of catching the "top". I am hoping to
really seize the opportunity this time and go net short or fully hedged. It is
the hardest thing to do in the market but I will give it a try. Time will
tell...

James, a stock that has been discussed on this thread, SCR.A has the
credentials to be a big winner in 2004. The stock sells at low valuations,
particularly p/b and p/s. In brief; the debt burden is heavy but steps to
improve the balance sheet have had some success. Shipping rates are at all time
highs. SCRA has a large position in OEH which some also be consider a value
play.

My swing for the fences play has been PAL. The company's main product is
Palladium, which used mainly for catalyctic converters. Other uses include
jewelry and fuel cell applications. It is almost interchangeable with Platinum.
Platinum is currently trading at historic highs while Palladium prices are at
the other end of the spectrum.

My favorites for 2004:
MEDI, the biotech stock with the flu vaccine Flumist. Flumist still may take
off and become a 500M$ product. If so, MEDI would be considerable undervalued.
PE currently about 25.

Low risk: MCK - the drug distributor trades at 12x forward earnings. I still
see MCK to achieve a LT growth rate in the low teens percentagewise per year.

There is a pretty active MEDI thread. my sense was that they misunderstood the
market for their product and horribly mispriced it. Not sure what they will do
with it next year.

1. I always appreciate it when someone posts their selectons and rationales for
doing so. I am kicking myself for not investing in some of the stocks discussed
here- I think one of them was yours-MOVI.
2. I am not sure what your point is about the originator of this thread. I dont
see how anyone who runs a hedge fund can talk about their investments- It would
be silly to talk about them before they invest and afterwards if they tout the
stock and then sell they could liable for a lawsuit. Re Vinik and Micron
Technology.
