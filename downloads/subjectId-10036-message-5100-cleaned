Wow, it's a bloodbath out there. Worst that I can remember. (But my memory
isn't that good -g-.) Not too many posts here either. Everybody around here
must be in shock. Probably the most sensible thing anybody can do is to lighten
positions, maybe start (if not already) some short positions. Certainly just
step aside until we hit bottom. After all, every day it seems to get worse no
matter what value stocks we own or are looking at. Yeah, that makes the most
sense to me.

So of course I will ignore that and continue, as I have today, to add to
positions I am uncomfortable owning. It's the only way IMO -g-.
Added today to CNC, LHO, LEH some others. FWIW. Paul Senior

Paul,

isn't that good -g-.) Not too many posts here either.

Yep, Enthusiasm wanes when you're down 30+% in only a few months. I've been
tempted to try a short like you mention, but I've never done one and besides
shorting the stocks I've been buying I haven't the slightest clue what kind of
companies would be best to short.

I lightened up on my position in DSWLF today. Japan is looking like it's going
to blow up in our faces. Saw a NY Times article that Japan banks are in worse
shape than we thought. It is amazing to me that they can have all that capital,
a highly educated and loyal workforce, and can still not make the economy work.

Fundamentally, I've become a short term bear on this market and am looking to
raise a little more cash should we get another rally, but I'm looking to jump
back in with both feet into small caps when it seems market sentiment turns.
Psychologically the current trend is extremely draining and I just don't feel
like fighting it anymore. I'm at the point where I expect my holding to
decrease in value each day, and am surprised when the market makes a move up. I
guess that makes me a bear, huh?

Does anyone have comments on Danka Business Systems, DANKY?

Reason for recent drop: They continue to have problems with the Kodak
acquisition, and per a recent press release are likely going to violate some of
their loan agreements and post loss this quarter. Revenues are down. On plus
side: recently brought in well regarded new manager to turn things around.
Sales force seems to have been really torn up by the merger w/ Kodak. Lots of
turnover in sales force. Per some reading at Yahoo where some employees post,
it seems the attitude at the company has changed to be more positive .

Sales of around $3.3 bil, and market cap of $195 mil. If they can turn it
around this stock should be able to earn over $1/share if it returns to a 2%
margin, which is doable by historical standards. Currently selling at around
0.40 of book, and around 0.06 of sales.

I'm not buying yet given my newfound bearish outlook, but this is way up there
on my list of interesting possibilities. Then again with my recent history
maybe I should short this one <g>

I do not understand your rationale for lightening up on dswlf- this is a
company with no debt and lots of cash, profitable to date and well managed. If

It's volatile, but I heard from a radio on my way home that this kind of thing
happened before, and every time, when market this volatile, it's the indication
of hitting a major BOTTOM.

Also, there is an article in the newspaper saying that in this market, the best
strategy is value investing. of course it is, otherwise, what's this thread
for? CSCO is the first big name victim, and there are many small name vitims

Armin,

My reasoning behind reducing DSWLF holdings (I still have some).

1. Mita, their top customer, is having troubles and has already announced a
halving of the orders. Mita says they expect to go back to normal order volume
at some point in the future but I no longer hold my breath. In fact, I find it
likely that other customers might be having problems and may also cut orders.

2. When entering the investment I had expected the visibility to have improved
somewhat in Asia by now. It's gotten worse w/ Japan seemingly paralyzed.

3. DSWLF recently expanded. This on top of flat or reduced revenues indicates
lower utilization rates which I think could dig into earning quite a bit given
the fixed costs of the new machines.

4. Given lowered expected EPS and the low PE multiple given to stocks over
there leads me to think if DSWLF earnings get halved, which wouldn't surprise
me, we could see the stock move considerably lower. The risk/uncertainty on
this one has risen IMO, despite the lower stock prices.

5. Psychology: What is the compelling reason to buy now? If there's no
compelling reason to buy, I don't see the stock running back up anytime soon.
I've become a short term bear on the market, and have not ruled out buying more
DSWLF when visibility in Asia/world improves.

6. Alternative intestments: Alot of other good stuff is getting really, really
cheap.

7. I was overweighted in this stock anyhow, and could use the tax deduction.

At least that's what my brain was telling me when I was looking at my portfolio
trying to figure out what to sell to raise cash. I probably was a little bit
tired of losing money. I've tried to start making myself respect mental stop
losses once I've established a full position in a stock, and this was my first
real test. The market's telling me I was wrong to buy this one, and I've
decided to stop arguing with Mr. Market for now.

Good luck,

Shane

Yeah, its a bloodbath. Today the knives came down on financial stocks.
Tomorrow, who knows? But the trend is pretty clear right now. This idiotic
notion that we are not in a bear market until the Dow drops 20% has been
laughable for two months now. The knives came down on Dell today, but that's
just the start.

LaSalle Hotels - I pitched this idea a couple times on this thread, and am
embarrassed to say that. I only hoped today when the bottom fell out that I was
the only one who bought it. (When I liquidated my portfolio in July I held onto
only 5 stocks. Why this one??? $%!) But unfortunately, that's not so. I have
never lost big money on a real estate stock until this one. All I can say is
this. I talked to the CEO today. He bought shares at 12 - he's not a bad guy, I
find him completely trustworthy. The stock is not going down because of
anything the company has done. So far the company has done nothing wrong - they
are just in the worst place at the worst time. Their hotels are worth $16-20 a
share by my estimate. They pay a dividend which now yields 17%. 17%! Could it
get cut? Sure. Are we at all certain it is going to get cut tomorrow? No. Their
earnings are not falling, and they are not seeing the warning signs they are
looking for. Will they if we go into a recession? Yes. The stock is in a panic
sell. I am a buyer, not a seller. This is one of those real tests for a value
investor in a bear market. I have not been through one of these before like
Paul. But when I saw the stock at 8 1/2 this afternoon, I felt like I had been
punched in the stomach. I told my boss about how I felt, and he told me that is
the best buy signal you are ever going to get, though it is the most difficult
buy signal to act on. He was absolutely right - the stock closed 10% up from
that level, and I never pulled the trigger.

PMA is another one you want to get to know. So is BT. Both have major problems
(PMA's became known today, BT's are still unknown, which may be even worse. But
you can get the same yield on Bankers Trust as you get from RJ Reynolds
Tobacco. Are derivatives carcinogenic?) For Buffett type value investors, take
a long look at Ambac (ABK), one of my core holdings which may be about to get
annihilated. Ambac's earnings are absolutely untouchable for three years -
you've got to know accounting to appreciate this beauty.

I haven't been posting much lately. Part shellshock, part busy, part - I'm just
not interested in buying anything until the market indices are at least close
to what I think they are worth. I posted this near the peak. Dow 6000, S&P 650.
There are clearly a lot of cheap stocks out there, many very cheap. But they
are going to get cheaper until Dell goes to 30, GE goes to 40-50 and MSFT goes
to 60-75. This market is fighting and fighting, but it breaks a little more
each day - today the Dow looked OK, but the carnage in individual names was one
of the worst days I have ever seen. And its still early October. The best is
yet to come.

FWIW, still buying today, but it really seems a lost cause. I don't see any
stock I've bought in the past few months that's profitable for me. (Oops
there's at least one. X. Steel--How could that ever be?)

The down trend doesn't look like it will ever stop. (But it always has --
although sometimes, after killing me -g-).

LHO touched 8 1/2 today. That surprised even me. For a stock with a $1.50
indicated dividend, for that to happen we had better go into a recession.
Investors must be assuming the div. must be cut (a 17.6% div. is not
sustainable.) Since there's no news out on the stock, I am assuming that the
market is anticipating a recession, higher vacancy rates in upscale hotels, and
maybe lower revenue per available hotel room (although there's some indication
that REVPAR didn't much decrease in the last recession). Or else investors are
just tossing in the towel on a lot of these stocks no matter what. Crimini! (Or
other words to that effect -g-.)

Well, we shall see. I probably will add to my position in a larger upscale
hotel REIT --FCH- tomorrow or next day. Paul Senior

Paul, you mention buying some more Conseco (CNC).

What do you know about the sell(short?) recommendation that Ray Dirks had on

some sort of understanding. But I recall he was alleging that there was very
serious accounting shenanigans going on. I found his detailed description to be

Today I loaded up. Mostly, I just added to Midway, Deswell, Asyst, and
Tidewater at ridiculous prices. And I started my first new position in a while
buying LHO at 8 5/8 and then again at 8 1/2. Thanks to the thread for the
discussion. Looked good in the teens. Looks a lot better now. I've been an
absentee value investor of late because I like everything I got and didn't
think it necessary to go looking for even more stocks with PE's of less than 10
and outrageous dividend yields.

FWIW, I'm now postponing purchases of real goods to invest in the stock market.
I find it ironic and sad that some here are just now starting to throw in the
towel, with a lot of US stocks down 60-80%.

Paul - you've criticized my holding periods in the past. Well, looks like I'm
gonna become a long-term holder of quite a few stocks here (not what I planned
or wanted ;-)).

I did recently rotate out of my Case at 21 1/2 and into NH again at 9 3/4.
Other than that, I'm just taking a peek every week or so. There's a serenity in
the turmoil from that distance. The last few months have been the least
research-intensive months in my investing career - it takes less than five
minutes to find a bargain, and just another five minutes to see it get cheaper.

On LHO, I was a day too late in reading your post and doing some review, or I
might have bought some today. Too bad.

But I did note a heavy debt load. Buying upscale hotels on 50% margin (or
whatever) is not a very conservative strategy, and possibly a
more significant issue in valuation than the large dividend. We could take a
vote and ask some investors in upscale stocks bought on 50% margin :-)

With some of my tech holding down, I some how find myself bought some more
today: DELL and CSCO at 42 and NOKIA at 62. These are the names I have been
looking for a while. they may go down again near term, but in 1 year, they are
good buy to me.

Also, my previous pick TRV and MER down another 20% after I bought them(I

Paul,

An opinion. The market corrected because it was overvalued. It corrected more
than the hedge funds and margin players anticipated and they are now being
forced to cover their positions. This is adding to the freefall, particularly
on NASDAQ issues. Add some investors wanting to lock in profits by selling or
withdrawing from funds and you end up with equities selling under value.

I would not buy any company with debt. IMO Banks will be tightening loan
policies and note renewals will be hard to get. They will be pressuring
borrowers to reduce loans because of declining asset values. Look for well
managed companies with strong cash positions. Avoid companies that have been
expanding thru acquisition because they now have paid too much.

Ron: my opinion re. loans is opposite from yours. Any company with old debt is
in good shape if they can refi. Everybody who can (whose covenants permit) is,
or should be, refinancing their loans. We are seeing the lowest rates in a
generation. Banks make loans. I am getting calls or letters every day to refi.
my mortgage. And I see no reason why companies are not also being visited by
bankers also for the same reason (refi). To say you will not buy any company
with debt, IMO needlessly limits very good investing choices. (For me, I am
placing tomorrow an order to buy more DTG - now there's a company with some
debt -g-. But so what? All the companies in its industry also have high debt
levels. So they there's no competitive advantage to have/not have debt. And as
long as companies can service that debt and profit from having such debt, I say
more power to them -g-.) Paul

Paul, you are only partly right, in my opinion.

"All the companies in its industry also have high debt levels" is an inadequate
justification to consider a company. A company may have no relative
disadvantage, but does it have a sound strategy? However, having debt per se is
not inherently bad. What is bad is mixing a high debt load with a volatile
business.

I spent a career as an actuary with one of the largest life insurance
companies, but have a distaste for investing in financial companies
most of the time. Banks and insurance companies have net worth which is
typically 5% or so of their liabilities. It takes an awfully conservative
investment/loan strategy not to risk losing all of net worth every 10-20 years
or so. Mutual Benefit Life was in business for over 100 years and went under
because they put too much money in more speculative real estate; as did a
number of name banks. Debt ridden companies in the cyclical steel industry is
an industrial example; or
try the airline industry as another. However, I have little issue with a Coke
or a Merck having debt.

Paul,

To expand my comment.

When I say I would avoid companies with debt, I'm referring to those companies
that might be forced to borrow working capital should we enter a recessionary
period. I want to see substantial working capital, the debt structured to long
term, and a respectable debt ratio. If this is the case, the low interest rates
would be preferable to a company issuing stock to finance activities.

As to the banks calling wanting people to refinance home mortgages - IMO this
will cease. With an economic slowdown, the banks will be tightening loan policy
and there will be a wider spread on deposit/loan rates.

My reasoning - The non-secured consumer loans (credit cards), highly leveraged
mortgages on over valued real estate, highly leveraged corporate debt,
International loans to emerging countries, and loans to hedge funds and
brokerages. All of these depend on a robust economy.

The first domino has fallen and the rest are teetering -g-

I looked up LHO, because I'm always interested in those insane div yields, but
it seems a very new issue, and the data was scarce. Usually those
super-dividend situations only last a day or two until the panic subsides.
Yesterday shares of Allied Capital Corp dipped to 12 3/8 because a company in a
somewhat similar business made a negative announcement. OK, maybe they went
bankrupt. So ALLC's yield was about 12.5% for a minute, but today the stock is
back up to 15ish, still too low of course. The year high was about 29. I think
RN held up better than most this week, partly because of the yield. Hope you
still own that. And Olsten? Still hanging on? That company seems like a black
hole of information, but sometimes that just means they are busy doing their

Hi Ron. Well my opinion is that the Fed will loosen rates and allow easier
credit. So the banks will continue to loan money. It is a great time to be a
borrower or to refinance. I just don't see the excesses that were so apparent
in the 70's and 80's. On the other hand, with freaky hedge funds, Soros
wannabees and clever wheeler-dealers all over the place, maybe these clowns
have learned better to bury and hide these excesses -- and these problems are
just waiting within a minefield to hit and hurt us.

The problem with dominos is there's no end to the chain. If we go into a
terrible recession and companies are failing left and right, why not just carry
it out further and say there's going to be panicky people, scared people,
hungry people, rioting people, anarchy, total destruction of our way of life,

Jeffrey B. (and Ron B) Yep, seems like my life story. "Only partly right"
Senior. And sometimes it's on the least important stuff -g-.
So I am not happy with my steel investments and my airline stocks. Steel stocks
are getting hurt from Asia/Latin America. Or so some reports are saying. At
some point, as I wear my value hat, there's a good price point for every stock,
risky as it could be. I think around this level for steel. That's just IMO of
course.
But as regards airline stocks, we are talking here about companies - maybe way
overleveraged, maybe not -- but companies that provide a service that people
want and are willing to pay for --- and since you guys probably travel too, you
will understand when I say also, a service that people are willing to endure
(-g-). Maybe somebody will go bankrupt in a recession, but I bet it won't be
UAL, AMR, BAB, KLM, etc. Again, there's a price/value point where it's worth a
bet by the value investor. And again, that's IMO.

Jeffrey, you remind me of the guy who works in the sausage factory and sees
what really goes on, and so has enough knowledge to know he doesn't ever want
to eat sausages. Maybe these banks and insurance companies really are built on
sand (not saying you have said that) or are really very risky to the
unsuspecting, but again, if the industry or companies can manage to convince
people they will overcome any issues they face (or hide the real issues from
the public), at some point, for me, there is an investment opportunity. On the
other hand -g-, I've not sold any of my bank or insurance stocks, they've all
been heading lower, so perhaps you are right if you are implying the chickens
are coming home to roost. But my bet here too is that bank/insurance stocks
will be higher next year. (maybe -g-).

gonna mention this again <g>) O'Shaugnessy's "What works on Wall Street" finds
current price trends to be somewhat predictive of future price trends.

Hi Robert: Yes, they are all companies I own.

I still own every share of OLS. I usually plan to average down, and that's what
I do, but for some stocks, at some point (the wrong point -g-) I realize I've
got too much of a particular company and I step aside. I still own every share
of OLS that I've bought at much higher prices. It surely does not look good.
Okay, lowering my outlook for the company - its outsourcing and health care
businesses are terrible, and maybe the management is not as forthcoming or
competent as I expected, but I still do think the company at some point will be
selling at least for book value, so I see the stock doubling from here. That
would still make it an unprofitable investment for me.
The salient point is that I believe the stock price will double from about 5 to
10. So I want to hold. That's my plan.

I also hold a small amount of RJR as I posted on it here. James Clarke said MO
was the better bet, get out of RNR. He was right (MO has done pretty darn good
since his post). I did not take his advice. That was a mistake. Dollarwise and
percentagewise-- a big mistake.

LHO is an enigma to me -- or maybe the word is enema. Only way to find out is
to give it some time. If there's a recession, and if hotel occupancies decline,
and if this comes out of the hide of LHO earnings-- the stock is already
presupposing a dividend cut (or else there's some knowledge of mananagement
shennanegans/incompetence or balance sheet folderol going on -- but James
Clarke would've caught those things I figure), so we would presume the stock
would decline even further. But that's not necessarily true. They do have those
Class A hotels and in '99 in a recession, we'll be looking forward to better
times (I hope) in '00 and '01.

Shane: His relative strength then would be in conjunction with "outstanding
price performance" (O'Shaughnessey), plus high earnings in current year as well
as in 1 year projected. Examples: BBY, DY and AVID (per his 9/98 fund
holdings).

I read your initial post to mean that you would not buy a value stock that was
declining until you saw a surcease (which would be indicated by the fact it's
starting to go up.) In other words, I figured you were saying, "I ain't going
to buy the thing until I see that it's not going down any more." If that is so,
I am responding that that such a buy criterion has no academic/empirical basis
to support it. Although it does seem make a heck of a lot of sense in this kind
of market =g=.

Wow,do I have losses! Pretty bad out there now according to my portfolios.

It's hard for me to sell a stock as it goes to new lows. I believe, most times
there is EVENTUALLY a reversion back to the mean - but it can be a long,
painful wait.

Unfortunately, it becomes easier to think that with very deep drops in a
particular stock position and/or perhaps years of waiting, it is not 'most
times' but instead, the market is smarter and the stock will not ever come back
or achieve the ruling reason why it was bought in the first place. And
sometimes - too many times -g-, this is true. For example I own UC and it looks
like these subprime lenders are all very possibly going out of business. (Per
article in WSJ). At least 2 have just filed for bankruptcy. With these
businesses (subprime lending) it is very likely the market was right
---investors like me coming in to buy under book (at 16 and averaging down at
9)--we're very, very wrong and we're going to pay for it (stock about 5 now,
bounce from 3).

In some of these cases -- like here - UC - where the business has just stopped
so abruptly or been so disastrously affected by interest rate declines and
securitization issues, I'm not even sure the insiders were able to protect
themselves by selling their own positions.

My point is that it must be the portfolio that counts, not individual stocks.
That is why I own a large and well-diversified selection of stocks. Value
stocks as well as growth-type. And since value stocks have something against
them (or they wouldn't be priced to be a value), I want to be invested in a
VERY broad spectrum of such value-types. To me it's a very statistical game --
everybody in the world - except Warren B and maybe his partner Charlie -
everybody has losses. It's got to be expected. And we've got to move through it
and onward with our financial plans.

But even with all that, large losses are terribly painful, they stick in one's
craw for years- maybe decades (I've got one from from a PVC pipe manufacturer
in '73 that will be in my memory forever apparently), they are embarrassing to
talk and think about, and worse --they put doubt in our minds about our
abilities, our sanity, and the wisdom of even being in stocks at all. So weeks
like last week do indeed remind me that this volatility also challenges our
mental game.

Paul,

"Well my opinion is that the Fed will loosen rates and allow easier credit. So
the banks will continue to loan money."

Lower Fed rates do not necessarily mean easier credit and the banks will always
continue to loan money, but under what conditions?

Banks must continue to profit. If they have an increase in NPLs, they must
offset these with solid loans and loans at higher spreads between deposit and
loan interest rates. Japan has had low rates for years and recently lowered
rates from 1.5% to 1/2% to stimulate their economy. The banks have so many NPLs
and losses that they cannot make new loans and the new loans must be at higher
rates. And Japan's banking restrictions are the loosest in the World.

US consumer debt on credit cards is higher than ever. So is the amount of
default. That's why credit card debt is so high, offsetting the defaulting card
users. If we enter even a weak recessionary period, the defaults will be even
higher.

Real estate values have increased substantially over the last few years due to
the economy and low interest rates. Banks have been loaning as high as 90%,
even 100% of the sale price. With a mild recession property values will decline
and in may cases it will go below the mortgage loan amount. (Mortage limits in
Hong Kong were and are 70% and the banks have gotten hurt)

Banks have been loaning huge amounts to hedge funds and suffering losses.
International banks are having major loan defaults on loans. These losses must
be recovered.

It doesn't take much of a fall off in the economy for banks to be forced into
much tighter loan policies. Because of US banking restrictions, a small number
of NPLs can cause a bank to lose a substantial portion of it's ability to lend.
Most banks have currently pushed these limits to the edge and are not in a very
good position should the economy go weaker.

I know I'm not telling you anything you don't already know, just explaining how
I derive my comments. I am not one that thinks we are entering a recession, but
I do feel we will see a weakening, similar, but a little worse than the 90-92
period. Something to make us realize that the economy is cyclical and economic
growth can't be a continuous thing. We are having a Schumpeter period that
weeds out the weak and rewards the strong.

JMHO,

Hi Paul: Well, I believe I'll take the other side of the argument -g-. I don't
think DSWLF is such a great bargain. Nor do I think selling in the shares is
due to some convoluted unwinding of trading positions by hedge funds. I think:
First, you've got some company where people have to work to find information
about it, and can't easily get information on it. That means anybody buying it
takes a risk that when they go to sell it, that the pool of potential buyers is
very limited because there's no real understanding of the company, its
management, its business, its customers or its suppliers. No sponsorship. I
look at Yahoo, and the first thing I see is that DSWLF sell injection molding
parts. Right. A 40% ROE for injection molding. Not very likely, or if true, not
sustainable. Obviously something else must be going on. A Chinese company. They
play by our rules do they? Maybe more like some of those shrewd Indonesian
companies who we are now reading about that allegedly had dough to pay their
debts, but found it more convenient to default, panicking bondholders into
selling, whereupon said Indonesian companies scooped up those bonds. I like it!
I say there's still much risk in DSWLF. Just as there is with NTAIF (which I do
own). Especially when we've go so many choices among domestic co's or large-cap
Euro. companies that are selling at distressed prices. JMO. Paul Senior

The public record is very new for LHO - yes that's true. That does add
additional concern, perhaps also additional risk. Very hard at this point to
tell if the drop in LHO stock is due to LHO itself or due to the more general
condition of it being in the out-of-favor category of Hotel-REIT or just maybe
because it's a small cap stock. For me, I think it's worth taking a risk on the
stock. Although I can understand how someone could say the company's public

I recall Dr. Graham saying he looked at the 10 year history. So LHO would not

Paul, two comments.

My comments on banks and insurance companies were meant to say that I believe
that most people do not understand the risks inherent in the capital structures
of these companies. What that means to me is that most of the time, but not all
of the time, I believe the pricing of the stocks does not carry a high enough
risk factor.

On LHO, I would have bought it under $8 if I had been paying attention.
However, I think the price decline has occurred for all the reasons you stated,
plus one other. I assume they purchased all or most of their properties at the
peak of a "feel good" financial environment. There may also be a factor in the
pricing to reflect increased risk that because of the leverage the market value
of the properties might decline to a point where the real book value was
materially reduced.

FSACF - JBash It appears to me that they showed a substantial decline in
operating earnings but not a net loss after securities gains. It appears a big
chunk of that loss was attributable to depreciation in the SA Rand which took a
big hit in June. I wish I could say I completely understand this whole thing,
but I don't. My take on it is that most of these businesses are mundane middle
market companies that have seen some slowdown due to concern over global
finance, confidence erosion, etc. This and the currency hit probably gets worse
in the current quarter..actually the currency was down 16.7% from June 30th
levels as of 10/9. Tax loss selling, funds wanting out, liquidation of stock
used to purchase subsidiaries..have combined to push these shares below
intrinsic value ..but due to complexity I would have a hard time proving this.
I'm optimistic that 2 - 5 years the global crisis is resolved, currencies come
to reflect purchasing power parity more closely and the fundamental described
in the analyst report linked to in the original message come back into play
..providing a return that more than justifies the substantial risk.
If you take this years .69 earnings grow them 10% for 5 years and apply a 10x
multiple you get over 60% annual return based on buying at todays roughly $1
share. The risk - global depression with no recovery or normalization of
exchange rates

spin off minority interests in other subsidiary groups which will result in the

While I'm sure SA holdings is now carrying a lower market value due to

I've been interested in OfficeMax OMX for quite a while, and the stock has
fallen into the $6/shr range now. They recently reported that earnings are
going to be below analyst expectations, but this still should be $0.25/shr or
so for the quarter.

http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/story/?story=/news/stories/pr/199810
6/hstu018.htm&symbol=OMX

Primary competitors, Staples SPLS and Office Depot ODP. The main difference in
the numbers I can see between OMX and the two above is that OMX has a
considerably lower ROE, but I think that may be due to OMX's not carrying the
debt load that SPLS and ODP have elected to carry. Margins are comparable for
all, and Sales/shr at OMX are growing at around 19% a yr.

I can't figure out why the market is pricing OMX at such a discount to SPLS and
ODP. I haven't been to a Staples store, but have been to both ODP and OMX and
really don't see much of a difference at all.

Does this one interest you, and do you have any insight. I think I'm going to
open a small position tommorrow and see what happens.

Eqnx - a serious "value play"? Here's why (I believe)...

-Trading at low PE of 10.
-Trading close to 52 week low of $6.75 (presently $8.375), 52 week high was
$18.
-Has been inching up in anticipation of earnings over past two weeks.
-Was hammered down last Q due to a small shortfall because a major order from
one OEM slipped from Q2 to Q3.
-$14M in cash, no debt.
-Heavy Institution ownership and insider ownership.
-CEO still holds most of his stock - has sold very little into the market even
though stock price has climbed.
-Dgii (Digi International) is closest competitor and is trading at a PE of 16 -
Eqnx is was ahead of them in management, focus, product and technology.
-A great Q3 is expected, with rumors of another major OEM deal already signed.
-No exposure to Asia, very little to L.A. or Europe
-New products being released which puts them into a new market altogether with
much higher average PEs (Remote Access, NT Networking, Terminal Servers, etc -
ASND, LU, XYLN, etc)
-Ripe for possible takeover, or logically may expand through acquistions

Re: ag equips, USU

Barron's has a feature story on cyclicals, mentioning New Holland and Deere by
name along with Agco as particularly undervalued, and citing the buybacks.
Honestly, if there's a big pop in the stocks Monday - especially NH, then I'd
consider selling, since the "Barron's effect" rarely holds up long (see TRC) in
the face of a continued lackadaisical story. This bear market ain't over yet,
and the ag equips companies are now saying that there will be a bigger falloff
in 1999 even than in 1998. So if there's a pop, chances are you'll be able to
buy them back cheaper at a later date. Not that I'm knocking the businsesses,
see http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/980930/z5.html . But yes I'm trying to time it a
bit.

Re: USU, this is oh so typical of Wall Street. Didn't it get down to 13 again?
I didn't see it. The dividend should be safe, and you're buying it because the
dividend is safe - cash flow is still tremendous, and the higher electricity
costs are transient. The AVLIS expense will be capitalized in a few years, and
in a few more years, electricity costs will be cut to a fraction of what they
are now. So you can buy it for the dividend, and sit on it, since once the
dividend is paid consistently, the stock will likely hit $18-20 or so simply on
that. The rest of the story may take longer to work out, but reported earnings
will jump once they capitalize AVLIS. No doubt AVLIS is a big deal, but as I
understand it now they're past the research stage (courtesy of $billions and
years of work from the gov't) and already for practical purposes entering the
commercialization stage.

That said, USU is not the world's greatest business, and truly last week there
were other stocks that you should have been buying, even if it meant selling
USU. If Deswell hits 6 again, or if New Holland hits 9 1/2 , or if Midway hits
9 1/4, well I won't be holding onto my USU at 16 or even 14 - it's not for
margined accounts, and if stocks get down that cheap again then I'll go on
margin to buy them up just like I did last week. I'm back off margin now, but
when you have companies trading at 1.5X earnings net of cash and debt with 15%
dividends, well I'm not gonna feel like I'm risking money by borrowing at 7-8%
to buy them. Heck, I'd LBO them if could.

I was not pleased at all with USEC's announcement in its first conference call
that it will fall short by 40 cents a share its first year. But they reiterated
that the dividend will still be $1.10 and that much of the shortfall is of a
one-time nature. I think more important than the financial loss was the loss of
credibility. Management really annoyed institutional investors and sellside
analysts by waiting until the quarterly announcement to admit to a signficant
problem that they have known about for three months.

You should take comfort in the fact that the stock held at a level around the
offering price. You won't find many IPOs that blow their first quarter and only
drop 10%. I think many investors already understand there is something special
here.

That said, the economics are virtually the same as they were before. What
changed is investor psychology. I bought a good story that nobody understands
and figured that one by one investors would jump aboard. Now the first thing a
new investor is going to see is a major earnings disappointment and a lot of
excuses. I have no intention of selling my shares, but the chance of a quick
payoff is virtually shot. The dividend allows me to live with that and wait for
the 2-3 year payoff while collecting a big premium to a bond return.

And Mike, that Deswell thing looks unbelievably cheap. I was just doing the
"what's wrong with this picture" analysis. All I can find is that they are HQed
in Hong Kong. I guess an Asian company now is about as popular as Hillary
Clinton at a Fallwell rally. Is there some other big issue out there that
should concern me? Does it really matter that they are in Asia - except of
course, their costs have fallen. The company has no debt, so its not like they
are some Korean conglomerate or Japanese bank tottering on the edge of
bankruptcy. And their product does not seem particularly high-tech. So you tell
me, what's wrong with this picture? I see the bull case - if you really want to
convince me, tell me what people are so scared of.

the last few years - and I feel I fit your description above.

They are in a very niche market, but with great OEMs, and a leader in the
Remote Access market, as well as Point-of-Sale products. They make boards that
plug into systems to allow those little POS card readers and such to be
distributed around stores. They also make remote access servers allowing a
company to manage their own dial-in modem groups.

They've made money since 1985 - every year. Management is quite conservative,
lots of cash on hand, and have unique in-house technology. They are continously
racking up new OEMs (another major one is rumored to have been closed already).
They are already sucessful in their niche, but with the new products just
starting to ship, they may break out of this niche...

DGII - the closest competitor, is trading at 16 to 20 PE, EQNX should at least
be in that range. Given their new products and targeted market, there is
tremendous growth potential.

True - they are a micro cap, but so are many others, with negative earnings to
boot. And this one is yet to be discovered. Earnings our today - stay tuned....

What has killed Deswell price?

That's easy. One of their largest customers(23%), Mita declared bankruptcy
reorganization for their Japanese unit. Just check out the latest Deswell press
releases to see the confusion this has caused. The ex-CEO, Mr. Mita himself, is
charged for illegal payouts from Mita. Some of the stock was held by Japanese,
who couldn't put up with the front page headlines in Japan, and dumped their
stock. Since the stock is very lightly traded, it got crushed.

But the two Mita units that Deswell sells to are solidly profitable. Kyocera,
the huge Japanese electronics component producer, is taking over Mita (2nd
largest copier seller in the USA). As part of the transition, Mita is reducing
inventory levels this quarter, which are expected to be replenished after the
takeover is completed.

So Deswell stock is now trading about book of 8.30 or so, and has 3.50 a share
cash, and will earn at least $2.00 this year (down from last year). The company
has said they will buy back up to 500,000 shares (if it trades around book) in
the latest press release. Over the last five years this company has grown
almost 50% per year, although the company expects that the growth from here may
be somewhat less. And the dividend is expected to be at least 8-9% of the
current stock price, and is about 35% of earnings.

Deswell(DSWLF) is the unusual case of a foreign micro-cap growth stock ($50M
market cap) trading like a value stock would trade.

You said "Trying to convince myself to add to ELAMF at current price"

As you know, I too follow ELAMF. A comparison since they IPO'd:

Hi Ron. Well, it's hard to argue with those figures. Your comparison makes a
good point. Or maybe many good points.

On my behalf I want to bring out these figures:

p/bv: .53 (ELAMF) vs. 1.1 (DSWLF)

psr: .25 (ELAMF) vs. .73 (DSWLF)

I also think that DSWLF having a book value of $8.00/sh and reporting earnings
of $2.40 for a ROE of 40%+ is utterly suspicious. Chinese smoke and mirrors to
me. I'll have to defer to you experts on the company and its industry, but to
me, they are a manufacturer or assembler with the same equipment and same low
paid people as any of their competitors. No competitive advantage (other than
some good business connections). I just don't see how they can sustain, let
alone have, this kind of ROE. I think with DSWLF, the bet now would be a dead
cat bounce from these low stock price levels.
Whereas for ELAMF, I can see the ROE at least improving to maybe 10-12% and the
stock going up to at least book value. (They've just announced an alliance with
GE, as you know, and this may accelerate the improvement.) But as I say, these
are my opinions, and I've been wrong many,many times before.

Additionally, these are both small cap foreign companies. No one (who is not
intimately familiar with the culture, the business, and the management of such
companies) should ever make such companies a core holding in their portfolios.
To do otherwise is very, very risky. That again is IMO. And that is what is
stopping me from adding even more (ELAMF) to my own account. Paul.

Paul,

I agree with you on 'not putting eggs all in one basket' and continually make
this statement regarding DSWLF. This definitely applies when equities/bonds are
your only form of investment. I have put a concentrated amount in Deswell, but
it is only a small portion of my total as most of my investments are not market
related.

One might suspicion 'cooking the books' except the $8.00 BV of Deswell is
primarily cash in bank. The auditors are Deloitte Touche and there's nothing
easier for an auditor to check than bank deposits. There are many reasons the
BV is so low. One is the high dividend payout. Another is a very fast
depreciation schedule of 3-5 years on their only fixed asset of machinery (they
own no property). Dividends are not taxed in HK/China and it's the primary
source of income for management creating a low overhead. They also have a very
low tax rate around 8%. All of this contributes to a high margin return.

I'm not arguing with you about the merits of ELAMF as I feel it to be well
under value, but IMO that DSWLF presents a much better buy. We have an $8.00
stock selling at $4.25 against a $30.00 stock selling at $8.59.

The bias you show against HK/China stocks is one of the major reasons for the
low price, not the fundamentals of the company. It is also down because there
apparently was a fund forced to sell off it's position. Deswell had about 200K
shares 'dumped' last week.

My best,
Ron

Well I hope all you value investors are enjoying this. On backs of today's
heroes Asyst and General Cigar (each of which I also bought more of when the
market was down a bit over a week ago), the market's given me a 25% gain in 8
days, and I trust it's done the same or better for many on this thread. Small
cap value stocks are just exploding, which is nice because it may get the
tax-loss selling off our backs as the month comes to a close. The January
effect this year could be potentially huge, as all the institutions that
pressed our stocks down with tax-loss selling thus far get back in (at prices
50% greater than where they sold). This is the type of can-do-no-wrong phase
that most of us value investors missed out on while the market screamed higher
the last few years. It's nice to be participating finally, and to see some
rationality in small cap value for the first time in the two years since the
thread started.

Good investing,

I've been seeing the same thing with my small cap issues and in the past two
days the large caps have followed suit. But I am asking myself what is so
different from three months ago? Valuations are more reasonable but is that
enough to kick off another bull run? Two major things have happened so far: a)
the Fed lowered rates and b) earnings have not been as bad as the analysts
thought. Of course, earnings are nowhere near the levels needed to support the
stock prices of June and July. My problem is that every other problem that
brought down the market in late summer is still there (foreign financial
crises, domestic political crises, enormous consumer debt levels, etc). What
could be driving this rally?

I guess I'm grumbling because I hadn't finished taking positions in beaten down
sectors (oil, steel, agriculture machinery). I'm wondering whether to chase
them or wait for another sell-off.

Read that last post twice, because it is pure common sense. I don't buy this

stated in the previous post. But I did get a screen of small cap value stocks
today and just started off at the beginning and found that the first seven
looked interesting. It wasn't like that before. Finally it seems the market is
acting rationally and realizing that one group of stocks is very cheap and
another isn't. It is very unusual for a small cap rally to occur during what
should be tax loss selling time, but that's what we're seeing. One thing is
clear to me - this is probably the best week for true value investors in the
last several years. Can't remember the last time Mike has been this happy.
Let's hope it lasts.

I agree with you completely. I suspect that there was some options related
buying going on during last week. There have been a number of very suspicious
rallies during options weeks over the last 2 years. I call them suspicious
because they often occur completely counter to fundamantal developments.

I think the Fed rate cut then added fuel to the rally and provoked a lot of
short covering and momentum guys to join the party.

Problem is that earnings (REPORTED not Operating) have been declining for about
a year now and they will be down again this quarter. There is no way to justify
current aggregate stock prices if you have a historical perspective.

Also, Brazil is having significant problems that have yet to be resolved. All
in all I believe this is a DEAD BALD EAGLE BOUNCE...albeit a big one.

That said, I really don't care where the market is going. The prices in
aggregate are still high for large, high quality blue chip companies. That's
what matters.

John,

Exactly what I'm thinking. Still semi-bearish. One difference, however, is that
the small caps are at much reduced valuations from earlier in the year. The Dow
stocks have not showed the same weakness, and this dichotomy still causes
caution IMO.

Can the small caps rise while the big caps tread water or even fall?

I agree with you on the valuation front. I think what matters if you are a long
term value investor is that if you choose the right companies, and they are
undervalued, they will outperform the market. I would be less concerned about
the general market level and its possible direction. That good advice

And in keeping with that spirit, Jeffrey, now I've sold off every stock except
Midway. I really found myself resonating with Levy's reasoning. I'm figuring
guaranteed 5% nominal rates on my money (which approximates the real rate) is a
very attractive option relative to stocks. Even the small caps that look cheap
have had a recent double, and could easily get cut in half as the year ends
/1999 progresses and/or pessimism resurfaces. Recognizing my own emotions
(elation as my stocks soared, lending a rosy view to everything) was the key to
my conclusion this rally won't last. Capital preservation seems indeed key
