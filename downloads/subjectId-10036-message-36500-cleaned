Don't know why I sold AHL, anializer, but I did. Yahoo still shows a number of
well-known value investors still in it, and it may still be a buy at current
price. I'm holding a bunch of various insurers (p&c, reinsurance, specialty),
so I'm somewhat reluctant to add yet another.

NUHC still undervalued as I view these distributors. Although...I am suffering
with NUHC. Have shares purchased in '07, '08, '09 and overall, am underwater in
the small position I have. Fwiw, ARW & AVT, the giants in the field, keep
advancing. I have been out of these two for a while. Goofed with small RELL: it
was - imo - undervalued a week or so ago, but not now (again, imo, by the way I
buy these). Had I put it on my watch list again, I might have reentered in
prior weeks or months.

Apparently demand for computers and such will be up this year (Intel is
supposed to have a good year, I've read), and there may even be some pricing
power somewhere, because supply of components is down (I've read). That might
give electronic component distributors some pricing power (assuming they
themselves have or have access to the componentry).

I see HRP cut the dividend in Jan 09 in the middle of the financial crisis. I
see they also cut in July 2000 after they paid out a large special dividend in
1.688, which seems reasonable after depleting the capital base. Is there
something else you are talking about?

If you issue stock that forces you to cut your dividend, then your top holders
will not be happy campers. They can live with incompetence, but not outright
thievery. I just don't see any rational management doing that unless a
company's survival is at stake.

Moreover, when you access capital via a stock offering, you have to sell to
underwriters and institutions and pitch them on your company. A pitch going,
hey we are going to issue x million shares so we can cut our dividend isn't
going to fly. And if you lie about it and then do cut your dividend, you will
have great difficulty coming to the capital markets ever again. That's a bridge
management does not want to burn.

Hi Grommit -

The covered call for me is a method to protect my gain, continue to collect the
dividend until the stock is called away and book a call premium now rather than
later. To do this, I elected to give the short term upside away and protect me
from any unexpected short term down side risk. I still am not convinced that
the stock is w/o any possible downside surprise.

I tried to set up the trade for a worst case where the benefit is in my favor
if there is a sell off back down to the secondary IPO price offer of
$21.50/share.

I read the prospectus for the secondary that was filed with the SEC and did not
like all the upfront fees that will be "front loaded" in Q1 2010. This was
based on an offering of 6.5 million shares and now with a 30% increase in
shares, these fees are higher with no new additional properties (other than
those originally included in the offering) or associated increase in rental
revenues. In the original prospectus they stated that $28 million will go to
pay down long term debt (reducing interest expenses). It was not clear where
the additional proceeds from the over subscription would go (about $43
million). I believe the majority of these "extra" funds are to be used to
replenish their on going credit facility and not immediately applied to new
properties that add new rental revenue streams. The prospectus and the proforma
revenue estimates were based on 6.5 million shares offered. The properties
identified and those in escrow are added to the 28 other facilities already in
the REIT GOV portfolio.

I am betting that there will be no increase in the "per share" dividend and it
could even fall by $0.05/share (about 13%) depending on how they deploy the
proceeds from the over-subscription of the secondary offering (2 million x
$21.5/share) or $43 million. The upfront "loaded fees" could be 30% more than
originally disclosed in the prospectus.

Maybe they use the extra proceeds to pay down additional long term debt or is
used to reduce the cost of carrying their credit facility thus GOV's operating
expenses are lower. The money saved is distributed back to shareholders.
However, the prospectus detailed none of these savings due to an over
subscription of shares ONLY THE EXPENSES!

It will be more clear to me after two dividend cycles. The final front loaded
fees from the secondary will have been disclosed and management should have
also update their 2010 proforma for any new properties added to their
portfolio.

================================================================

It is interesting to see the First Industrial Preferred shares up 14% over the
last few days to new recovery highs. This signals to me that secured debt
yields are falling and the implied risk premiums are less. This trend should
bode well for the common shares of many of these REITs.

Therefore, HRP, BDN, FR & GOV common should participate in the rising value of
their real estate holdings. The only issue with GOV is that they paid full
market value for their properties with HRP being the beneficiary of receiving
the long term capital gain.

FR preferred surprised me the way it has improved 10% in price lately. I
lightened up considerably due to concern after that mention in the press
release after close of business on a Friday (1/8) that they might suspend the
preferred dividends for a quarter or two. I believe the first suggestion of
possible upcoming bad news is seldom the last.

I was thinking it could be people just going after the juicy dividend, but the
move seems oversized for that. Hard to say. I may sell the last bit, and just
buy FR. If they get through this FR will move up much more than a preferred,
and if they do not get through this, I question whether the preferred will do
that well on bankruptcy distribution.

At least I reinvested the proceeds with GOV, so the relative loss is only about

GDL,

I'd probably stay away from GDL because they have a preferred paying 8.5%. That
is too high of a borrowing cost for a closed-end fund in my view. To be honest,
I think the $50 preferred is the better deal than the common, even at $53.
However, they could call the preferred at any time, so you would be rolling the
dice for a few quarters (until you earned the premium in dividend).

I know for myself, I wouldn't borrow at 8.5% to invest. In fact, in my new
risk-averse state of mind I'd be happy with a risk free 8.5% on a chunk of my
portfolio. Of course, their strategy should be much less risky than mine, so it
is more justifiable.

Comment on PAG secondary,

Unless the market has been short anticipating a deal, or there is some great
transformative event for a company, a stock will almost always trade down on
the secondary announcement, and for a valid reason.

It is the law of supply and demand. Supply has increased and the price has to
drop to absorb the new supply. IMO, this dynamic tends to outweigh fundamentals
in the short term. As the supply gets absorbed by the market, fundamentals take
hold again.

Just a thought. I feel like ATPG is so forthcoming with their NPV analysis that
it seems very compelling. But, other companies don't seem to give us that much

Afaik cwillyg, there may be a few microcap e&p's below nav, but none trading at
such a discount as ATPG.

Where I find e&p's below nav (pv-10 reserves, discounted), I am a buyer. Not
anywhere near the extent though as with my position in ATPG, a company which
seems like it is going to garner large revenue increases fairly soon (I hope)
when their fields are hooked up.

I hold also GEOI now. Nav is about $19/sh (per p.8 of presentation) vs. stock
about $13.

I'm adding to my oil/gas stocks again today. More of the stocks I've mentioned
in recent posts---XOM, ATPG, etc.

XOM only a few points off its March low. Dividend yield 2.5% with dividend
yield increasing every year. Large cash position. Not that I like management or
company's politics or some other aspects of the company. Just looks like
downside from here seems somewhat limited. Possible though that the all stock
deal for XTO could drop XOM price to new lows if XTO people sell shares they
are given. And of course, dropping stock market can take XOM to new lows too.

Also adding to some utilities.

re XOM - I agree it's looking cheap relative to recent history but not relative
to other oil stocks though. I compare XOM PE of around 11 and the 2.5% dividend
yield with TOT (just to name one example) 8 PE and 5.3% yield, I am having a
hard time paying for such excellence.

I was somewhat disappointed with the XTO takeover too and the fact that they
paid full price. I thought it's a good time to acquire assets for cheap. So I
think I'll take a pass on XOM. Besides TOT, MRO looks good to me and I bought
some shares recently. Nice production growth over the years and assets in
Westafrica, Bakken and Canadian oil sands. Refining is hurting but 75% of MRO's
value is in the upstream segment according to MCDEP.

XOM is the class act among the integrateds and historically has had a higher
multiple than competitors, afaik. After your post, I checked my assumption that
XOM is deserving of such multiple because it has outperformed them (by market
appreciation) as well. Surprise to me, TOT generally has done better than XOM:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ta?t=my&s=TOT&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=xom

When you couple Total's over 5% div. yield vs. XOM's only 2.6%, it would seem
that TOT might indeed be the better play based on that and TOT's historical
performance (the above chart). XOM, otoh, might be safer in that it has a cash
cushion and total debt to equity of .09 vs. Total's .51 Total Debt/Equity (per
SI financials). And XOM, even with all its cash, has a roe of almost 20% vs.
TOT's roughly 11%.

I'll have to keep TOT in mind, because if, for long periods of time, TOT has
outperformed XOM, then maybe instead of XOM, I'll want to add to the few shares
of TOT I have tucked away. For that matter I'm still holding also Pargesa, the
Belgian holding company that always (apparently) will trade under its nav. It
holds a bit of Total:

re: SOA

what you say may be true, but I'd have two concerns:

no dividend.

It dropped to $1.04 recently. Now it is at $14. It is not a financial, REIT, or
a mining company where I have followed some and seen that large moves occurred
(but even with these classes of companies, that would be quite a move up). Did
its competitors share that sort of ride? Maybe there is a good explanation, but

Hi Paul

Here is the latest McDep report.
Titled: Natural Gas and Oil for the Twenty-Tens
http://www.mcdep.com/mr100105.pdf

XOM and MRO were all rated buys at the time the article was written 1/5/2010.
The McDep NPV estimates has XOM at 80% and MRO at 70%. COP represents my most
resent buys has a McDep NPV ratio of 63%.

I like your thinking on the possible dumping of shares from the recent XTO
merger which might result in a depressed XOM price (short term). XOM also
reports their earnings on Monday.

One of my themes this year is to focus on companies that participate in the
domestic NG sector including exploration, collecting & transportation,
pipelines inter & intra state, storage, infrastructure build out and electrical
generation. My thinking is with XOM's entry into the mix with XTO, WMB
restructuring their partnership debt so they can buy more NG assets, the
Canadian Trusts reverting to corporations and buying U.S. assets, there seems
to be enough disruptive forces to see some consolidation in this sector.

Did you find any shippers that have LNG vessels? I wonder if FRO's next big
purchase will be in this category of ships? If so, the financing will go
through SFL.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I am focusing on stocks making recovery lows that are still trading above their
50 week MA but have fallen sharply reflected by them breaking down below their
50 Day MA. The one caveat is I am selecting those stocks that have fallen on
low volume (as measured against their average daily & weekly volume).

Their are some pundits claiming this correction is due to some very large fund
managers selling their winners from last quarter. I see it as simple profit
taking. I am trying to nibble at those companies that continue to show longer
term strong relative strength but are participating in the sell off on lower
than average selling volume.

I find that you have to be patient, pick your entry level and selectively work
your way into a position. With the higher VIX, there may be opportunities for
swing trades but for now, I am trying to build up the foundation of the
portfolio which includes harvesting losses and re-entering positions with lower
cost basis.

I am well aware of XOM's qualities. in late 2008 and early 2009, XOM benefited
from a flight to quality (AAA balance sheet, huge size, lowest cost in
industry, , balance sheet with net cash, management reputation) and that IMO
was the reason the shares held up so well.

of course for the very same reason the stock recovered less. So far that is
understandable. A lot of watches expected XOM to make an smart acquisition,
since XOM is known to have good timing and strong execution with acquisitions
(Mobil Oil was the last major one). Then they decided to take on XTO and paying
full price at that. despite a substantial cash component, this acquisition is
not accreditive to earnings immediately. I think it's an unexciting acquisition
just like BRK's BNI takeover. I don't like a pay a premium for a company that
is making these kind of acquisitions.

I think both TOT and MRO will outperform except if the world is going to end
and in that case XOM won't do well either just less worse than it's
competitors. In a reasonable environment MRO in particular will give XOM a run
for it's money as they have been doing since Y2002 and might even become
takeover fodder with an extra juicy payday.

Following you into NAVG, Spekulatius, with a small starting buy.

I'm holding now several of these p&c insurers, and they're all about the
same--- p/e below their historical averages; trading under bv; annual growth in
book value; earnings every year or almost every year for the past ten years.
Some of these companies seem to me to have niches that they operate in: Very
roughly I'd say NAVG for ocean marine/Lloyd's of London business; HCC in
professional indemnity (director's insurance)and aviation; AXS reinsurance and
political risk and marine/aviation,etc.; EIG workers comp.

We'll see if the insurance business reverts to its historical p/e and p/bv
numbers. I'll hold a package and assume if there's a rising tide all will be
positively affected. There's some reduction in business risk with any one
company in holding a package of several. Otoh, these companies may all hold
relatively large amounts of municipal bonds, and I keep reflecting on W.
Buffett's admonishment that these bonds may be much more risky than even
professionals believe. He's said that in the old days the bonds were held by
goodly number of people the community in which they were issued, so that
elected officials were very reluctant to consider defaulting which would
certainly inflame these people, their constituents. Now with so much packaging
up of the bonds and having them distributed so widely outside the community,
the municipal managers aren't so much concerned that people like him (Mr.
Buffett) might be burned if the municipalities decide to default. Thus
decreased safety perhaps with the bonds, apparently not compensated for with
their low yields.

Hi Paul -

I have been studying the emerging companies in the E&P, storage & distribution,
infrastructure development all relating to NG (and LNG) from the Marcellus (and
surrounding area) NG Shale deposits to the major Ports for distribution.

(From LNG Facts: http://www.aessparrowspointlng.com/aboutlng.asp#anchor6 )
History of the U.S. LNG ports.

# Four marine receiving terminals were built in the United States between
1971-1980 -Lake Charles Louisiana, Everett, Massachusetts, Elba Island Georgia
and Cove Point, Maryland
# As production techniques improved in North America, Elba Island and Cove
Point receiving terminals were mothballed in 1980. The Cove Point facility
continued to operate as a "peakshaving" facility that was used in periods of
high natural gas demand.
# First exports of LNG from U.S. to Asia in 1969 when Alaskan LNG sent to
Japan.
# The LNG market in both Europe and Asia continued to grow rapidly from that
point forward.
# In 1999, first Atlantic Basin LNG liquefaction plant in the western
hemisphere began production in Trinidad.
# Growing demand for natural gas in the U.S., particularly for power
generation, results in renewed interest in LNG in U.S.
# The two mothballed LNG receiving terminals are reactivated - Elba Island,
2001; Cove Point 2003. The Cove Point facility is in the process of expansion.

I believe that the AES Sparrow Point LNG Terminal now under expansion will
really benefit from the increased volume of NG from all of the new wells
drilled.

Companies that I have identified so far that should benefit from the increased
U.S. NG activity include: (1) AES CORPORATION (NYSE: AES), (2) CHGO BRIDGE &
IRON (NYSE: CBI) and (3) WILLBROS GRP INC DE (NYSE: WG).

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AES,CBI,WG&d=s

Unfortunately none really provide a good "value" bet except for perhaps CHGO
BRIDGE & IRON (http://www.cbi.com/about/history.aspx ) (NYSE: CBI) since it's
PE is around 10.5. However, the analysts see next year's earnings not growing
as much and have their forward PE at around 12. The company is similar in size
to SHAW and 1/5 the size of FLR. Neither SHAW or FLR provide pure plays in the
LNG terminal design and construction business.

AES (http://www.aes.com/aes/index?page=global_presence ) has a lot of projects
in the hopper (in particular the Sparrow Point LNG Terminal & 84 mile
connecting pipeline) but are burdened w/ a lot of debt and potential delays in
their LNG terminal. Analysts do show their forward PE around 11 but they
stopped paying a dividend in 1993 and split their stock several times
('94,-97,&'00). Maybe now in 2010 revenues have caught up with their huge
number of shares (668M shares) and it might just be a good time to test the
waters.

There are a lot of small NG "collectors" in this area that I am still
researching. Many are MLP and LLP but could also be candidates for
consolidation by larger companies (ie. like WMB).

EKS

P.S. I did see that StealthGas, Inc. (GASS) has a fleet of 39 LPG vessels (some
were recently sold to Chinese buyers) which according to the AES Sparrows LNG
article represented 39 vessels/140 vessels world wide 28% of the world's fleet
(at least at the time the article was written). So GASS is the major pure play
in the LPG ocean transportation.

I did discover that NOBLE GROUP LTD (NOBGF.PK) has a Fleet management shipping
subsidiary (http://www.fleetship.com/profile/index.html ). Essentially
companies w/ vessels outsource the management to Fleet. They are known for
their top notch expert crews (many from India). I expect the Nobel Group to get
into LPG distribution in a big way in the future.

In late 2009 the China sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, Inc.
(CIC) made investments in BOTH AES and NOBEL Group in excess of $1Billion each.

Paul,

I liked the ATPG report at first glance. It looks like they keep giving up a
bit long-term to make sure their debt covenants are ok, and now it looks like
2010 is going to be fine on that front. That should give them time to ramp up
their oil production and crank out the cash we've all been waiting for.

I will add more this week also. They were too close to a covenant issue for me
to add before year-end, but I'm feeling better after the report today.

Thanks,

Looks like this may dent Ameritrade/ Etrade and similar online brokerage with
limited product debt. The likes of Schwab/Fidelity with their product debt on
one end and the likes of Optionhouse/MBtrade/interactive with their low
commission are going to kill the folks in the middle, imo.

The above statistic would imply that banks profitability may be somewhat
exagerated. Sounds to me like there are more shoes to drop on the residential
mortgage front.

My guess is that ameritrade will have to match the fidelity offer and quickly.
otherwise they might as well close up.

Hi Grommit -

Peeled off a few shares of SHAW and added CHGO BRIDGE & IRON
(NYSE: CBI). CBI is a better play in the LNG construction and technology (
http://www.cbi.com/services/ ).

CBI is under contract with AES to design and complete the Dominon Cove Point
LNG Terminal Expansion located near Lusby, Maryland.
Check out all the LNG projects under development and/or completed by CBI.

CBI has under performed both FLR and SHAW and sells at a slightly lower PE.

I basically re-balanced my infrastructure holdings to represent 3% of the
portfolio (weighted according to company market cap.).
