re Coal - Coal is not going away but regulators or the government can make it
more expensive. Many coal plan will require expensive upgrades (For example MIR
plants) if they are outdated and even then they are going to be hit by Carbon
caps. it's hard to say what these carbon cost are going to do. part of them are
going to be paid be the consumer but in some cases (espcially when spare
generating capacity is available) coal is going to be substituted by cheap NG.

Besides that LT problem we have the short term problem that NG prices are low
and the wholesale electric power prices tend to correlate with NG prices (Since
NG plants are the swing producers). This is going to pressure margins for all
generators including coal plants. Besides that we also have the "cost of
capital" problem which will hit the IPP and small cap utilities hardest.

I don't see a compelling valuation case for BKH either. BKH trades at 6.7x
EV/EBITDA while large cap utilities like ETR with nice nukes <g> trades at 7x
EV/EBITDA. Why go with dinky BKH? Chasing yields?

Re SHS. number are horrible alright but it is an interesting situation: Danfoss
(who brought them public a while ago) owns not only 80% of their common but
they also took over their debt. it seems to me that this should ensure survival
until the losses truly wipe out the value of the company.
While they could screw the shareholders, wiping out 20% of the common only
"saves" them 25M$ at this point. That does not seem worthwhile. I think if
things go bad we may see a takeunder worst case, the probability for bankruptcy
is almost zero, IMO. if they can muddle through 10$+ should be easy. Maybe if

re "REITS. 50% off sale for the Boston Hancock Tower."

What seems astonishing and a feat of brilliance to me is that the partners
seemingly had only to put up $20M dollars. For this they were able to acquire
THE primo building 85% leased. (Apparently in total they spent more than that
because they bought up the mezzanine debt which apparently allowed them to
control the foreclosure bidding.) If this property appreciates even 10 percent
over the next three years (from the $600M purchase price), these guys will get
maybe a triple just in capital appreciation alone on their very small

This sounds to me like a 6.7% cap rate on John Hancock Tower. $380 per square
foot.

"In a foreclosure auction today, the John Hancock Tower - a marquee building in
Boston - traded at $660MM to Normandy Real Estate Partners. That same property
was appraised for $1.3BN in 2006 and traded for $935MM in 2003. This is VERY
negative for commercial real estate. At face, it looks like even top quality
assets are down 50% from their peak, but that forgets the value of the
financing that Normandy now gets to assume. There will still be a $640.5MM
mortgage on the property at a rate of 5.6%. What is the value of being able to
get a 97% LTV loan at 5.6% these days? Let’s say you can get a 60% LTV mortgage
($400MM) at 8%, and the other $240MM in mezz financing (which has no chance of
getting done in this market) could hypothetically get done at 15.

That combination produces a weighted average financing cost of almost 11%. A
5.6% mortgage at 11% yield is about a 70 $px, which means the value of assuming
the existing financing on the Hancock Tower is close to $190MM. The real
clearing level for the top commercial property in Boston was only $470MM - down
65% from 2006 levels and down 50% from 2003 levels. If we assume 2008 NOI
numbers are still accurate, this would be a 9.5% cap rate adjusted for the
financing. Without adjusting for the value of financing, the purchase price of
$660MM looks like a 6.7% cap rate and $383/sqft - rich, relative to 1540
Broadway (NY office vs Boston office) recently clearing at ~$400/sqft.

Sorry, Madharry, I'm not sure what you mean.

The new owner has put down $20mm and has a $640mm mortgage at 5.6%. On its
face, that is said to be a 6.7% cap rate and $380 psf.

For reference, I guess that implies it is a 1.7mm square foot building earning
$44mm NOI.

Unless my calculations are wrong, that implies an annual NOI of $38 psf (on
100% of the area) - which would mean rents are in the $50 range. Can that be
right! No wonder no one else bid on it. Those are sky-high rents which are
bound to decline. There must be a lot of tenants wanting to get to cheaper

BDN. They just secured most of the funding that was maturing in 2009.

from the Q4 conf call on 2/19

...we have about a $70 million principle mortgage maturing in July. We’ve got a
refinancing lined up that will actually slightly increase the proceeds
reflective of a reasonable loaned value. And we hope to close that some time in
the second quarter. That would leave us with about $90 million of additional
mortgage financing. We’re going to market with a particular situation we think
could raise as much as 50. And that would leave as yet unspecified $40 million
in one to two other situations. And we may exceed that, but that’s what we’ve
built in right now.

Today they announced this mortgage, which seems to be the $70 million+
mentioned above:

April 1 -- Brandywine Realty Trust announced today that it has closed an $89.8
million first mortgage financing on Two Logan Square, a 702,006 square foot,
99.1% leased, class A, office tower in Philadelphia, PA. The new loan features
a 7.57% rate and a seven-year term with three years of interest only payments
followed by a thirty-year amortization schedule. $68.6 million of the proceeds
was used to repay without penalty the balance of the former Two Logan first
mortgage loan and $21.2 million was used for general corporate purposes
including the repayment of existing indebtedness. "We are very pleased to close
this $89.8 million mortgage loan," stated Howard M. Sipzner, Executive Vice

Jurgis Bekepuris. So you believe the more time spent on dd for a potential

There's no academic research to support such a view, that I know of.

These are days of low-hanging fruit. Anybody who spends a lot of time analyzing
something trashy like TRID imo has a poor method for focusing his/her time or
has no good method for screening stocks.

The stock is either a buy because it sells below cash and may eventually sell
above cash, or it will continue to sell below a declining cash hoard as that
cash is decimated by management. This is the critical dilemma, and there is no
way an outsider can determine what management will do by spending a lot of time
analyzing the company.

For me, I bet on a package of these companies that sell below cash. Some will
decline much more, and some will see their shares rise quite a bit -- such has
been history, anyway. I am betting there will be gainers and the gains will
outdo the losses on the others.

A decision for me regarding TRID that takes not more than two minutes.

Whether I was wrong to have bought TRID and whether the person analyzing was
right to not buy, that is an outcome we do not yet know.

No, I do not believe that spending infinite time on a DD will result in
infinitely better results. However, I believe most purchases that "take not
more than two minutes" will result in losses.

There were quite a few areas which could have improved your results in TRID.
For example, understanding the business and TRIDs position in it, talking to
management about their current situation and plans, talking to activist
shareholders about their situation and plans. Or even delving more into the
financials and understanding what is exactly there as well as the trends. TRID
is a microcap and most of these avenues are available even for small
shareholders.

You have said more than once that you are not interested and not willing to do
such DD, since you own a lot of stocks and you "bet on a package of these
companies". Fine. It does not mean that you can run around the board dissing
someone who does more in depth DD. I said already more than once that there is

I find this ludicrous. Nice for scoring debate points; totally useless

purchases. Best to avoid the stock -- as your friend did. That is not what I

their main business (NPCC), I like how they bought back convertibles at $.50 on
a dollar resulting in gains for shareholders. I am neutral on the announced and
then canceled purchase of fertilizer business. On the other hand, the loss of
coal-based chemicals business is significant blow to the sales. Even 40% NPCC
growth replaces only 50% of coal chemical revenues. So all lost revenues are

re Hancock Tower - the 6.7% cap rate does not include the financing subsidy.
Zero hedge put's these at a 190M$ value.

http://zerohedge.blogspot.com/2009/04/what-john-hancock-tower-sale-implies.html

So if net cost of purchase is indeed 470M$ and rents are 44M$ the cap rate is
9.5%. one problem I see with this is that it does not account for the cost of
junior mezzanine debt acquired. The fact that the seller owned the mezzanine
debt was the reason why he was the only bidder, IMO. We do not know how much
they paid for the mezzanine debt. If we assume they paid 60M$ (approx. 10c/$)
to pay off all the debt the Cap rate would be closer to 8.8%.

From my very limited understanding, Hancock Tower at 9.5% is great deal. Which
means, either it is a great deal, or the rents are going to come down (a lot?)
or there are intrinsic issues with the building, which is unlikely but
possible. Of course, 9.5% is a bit of an accounting gimmick - it's not as if
their cheap financing is a liquid asset that can be sold or transferred. It's
just an opportunity number that can be valued using a model, but that's pretty
much it. So realistically, the number is somewhere between 6.7 and 9.5%. 6.7%
is not that great, IMO. But then I am no real estate expert. :)

This is a portfolio structural issue for me. One that I've just started working

Strange and disconcerting that we both seem to come to it at the same time.
That is, if I understand correctly, we both want to diversify our assets

if possible or prudent or maybe advisable, have that hedged or offset or
balanced with something else. DBA being a commodity play for corn, wheat,
soybeans and sugar.

Well we're all going to want different things from our portfolios. For me, at
my age and station in life, I'll go for a structured portfolio that's a little
better balanced with a mixture of presumably uncorrelated assets. If there are
such assets. This past year has been a difficult year - either an anomaly or
something surprisingly new and maybe longer with us than we want -- namely,
that so many asset classes, maybe all of them, were correlated. Foreign stocks,
domestic, growth, value, reits, commodities (?), bonds --- they are ALL down,
and down substantially.

I'm still reviewing what some financial advisers and writers are saying about
having commodities in a portfolio. It seems that the general opinion is that
it's been an anomalous situation and that it is good for somebody like me to
have a commodity component in their portfolio. Within a couple/three years we
can expect varying asset classes to outperform. Sometimes maybe common stocks,
sometimes maybe real estate, sometimes commodities. And successfully predicting
which will be the winner a-priori is not going to be realistic for most
investors.

I'm pretty much lost regarding which commodity funds or commodity etf's should
be considered. I've got plenty of oil and gas stocks; I hold only a few AUY
(gold producer); ADM, SFD (for pork), IPSU (sugar), ULTR (soybean
transporter),but I'm looking for something more direct with the actual corn,
wheat, soybeans and sugar commodities.

Anybody else here with any suggestions relating to commodity funds or etfs, or
how they are using commodities in their portfolio, please come in.

Maybe the reason there was lack of response is that they don't fit the value
metrics many on this thread look at. CMG and PNRA aren't low PE, P/B, etc.
stocks. They are growth stocks with relatively high betas.
However, as reversion to the mean stocks, you are correct that they are
excellent trading vehicles.
Anecdotally, I frequent both CMG and PNRA (going there tomorrow on my every
other week trip to COST!), and both have excellent offerings. PNRA always seems
jam packed at lunch time....I've noticed a fall off in traffic at CMG, but that
could be a function of the time I'm there, whether college is in session, etc.
I've heard raw material costs have become more favorable for both, especially
PNRA.

I eat at both restaurants and CMG is a fast food.. stand in line choose your
meal ... all Mexican and all Natural Organic meat... chicken,pork or beef. Then
fill your tortilla or bowl.. I prefer the latter as it is less messy for me. I
get the black beans, rice, lettuce , natural tomato.. and
sour cream. There are a myriad of other choices such as hot salsa and
guacamole...and then one either sits down or leaves.

There is little overhead. The kitchen stays busy as the line for food are
usually long.

Panera on the other hand is a choose your menu and sit down with a gadget until
it goes off and you go pick up your food. All food is in plastic and not much
expense. They make their own breads and their selections are numerous. They
always have hot soups... homemade. The one here in Sarasota and in Boone are
always busy. Never a let up. Even afternoons when most restaurants slow down.
They have numerous exotic drinks like Chai Tea...

Anyway do appreciate your reply..

I love restaurants as I am retired and eat out a lot.
Both these restaurants are on my list as top drawer...

Ruby Tuesday has an excellent salad bar... and I love salad.

Applebees is not so great. Small portions..

A good meal can always be had at Cracker Barrel...

First Watch which is not a chain is my pick for great breakfasts.

I should write a food column but started all this to show that

SUMA. I look every time you mention them. They are always way too expensive. I
never understand why they might be value buys (even when they were at lows of
late last year).

You provide no rationale why these stocks might be value stocks or "great
stocks for appreciation". (other than the restaurants you see are busy, or that
the stock had come down from highs (in Dec) or that the stock prices are moving
up (now)

My impression is that you repeat yourself:

1. No one replies to me.
2. Take a look at CMG and PNRA.
3. I could kick myself for not buying them.
=================
"I had no encouragement from those of you who are value investors to even
consider buying these stocks and often kick myself for not being more
courageous. Has anyone here actually invested in either stock ?"

If you were looking for encouragement to buy here, you are on the wrong thread.
Imo. What kind of value investor here would recommend these stocks as a value?
None should. None did. As I recall, you are a retired person on a fixed income?
If so, and knowing that, who would sensibly encourage you to buy these two

Well my daughter in law bought CMG at it's initial opening and it was then 45 a

I think in my post I never tried to pass either of them off as value plays. I
just have watched tremendous appreciation in both stocks. I think they are over
valued but they keep on a metromeric rise.. When the market has a up day CMG
can do four points.

I rather wanted to know whether in the my posts in the past had anyone took a
look at them from my obsession in posting about them (SIC.) and bought them.
They would have done well.

There are other VALUE stocks here that go nowhere and in fact sometimes VALUE
is in the eyes of the beholder and not
in valuation. Would you not agree ?

No one ever encouraged me to buy them. I had hoped that
possibly someone here might to it.. BUT as you say, they do not fit the

"VALUE is in the eyes of the beholder and not

Sure, but for me to have any meaningful understanding of the person's view
about a stock, I'd say there are two requirements:

1. The person has to have some method or criteria for determining value.

2. Somehow that person has to communicate what that method or criteria is.

Anybody could say Chipotle is a value at any price. The people buying the stock
today, right now, must have some belief they are getting a value. But if they
won't/can't provide some rationale for that opinion, then I am left to rely
only on my own method/criteria for an evaluation, because I can't see the other
person's perspective.

Kind of like when somebody only says they rely on their gut to tell them the
stock is a buy. I always want to ask them then to send me a picture of their

KR is much better value but the public is enamored with Wholefoods. My sister

Re-Entry into COV @32$, MCLK @33.5$. COV is a fairly inexpensive medical stock.

PE around is 10-10.5. Balance sheet looks good (A- rating). management did a
good job after the Spinoff from Tyco, IMO. They grew the business, increased
gross margins and boosted the skimpy R&D spending. Their products are mostly
considered non-Capex or consumables so my guess is that they should be fairly
recession resistant unless hospitals start to re-use needles and such <ng>.
There is a very transparent and straightforward looking compensation structure
for management. The chart looks like I may be able to average down though.

it seems crazy to buy NILE for 30x earnings. i think it's a decent company (I
bought my wife engagement ring there) but it's hardly unique any more and a
blue chip jewelery company like TIF trades with a PE of 13. Maybe they think of
NILE as the Amazon of the Jewelery business. My guess is though that it's a
theme based trading that pushes these kind of stocks up. TPX is in some ways
even worse since they balance sheet looks ugly. Many industries with ugly
funnymentals have done well recently - Restaurant stocks, retailers. There are
some examples where stocks in these sectors have gone really down to much but
others are floating in a parallel valuation universe as if there has not been a
bear market at all.

This irrationality as well as the crazy fluctuations make me think that we have
not seen the last bear raid yet. The same folks that are trading these hot
lottery tickets are going to run for the exit quicker as soon as somebody
screams "fire".

MVC mentioned favorably in Barron's today, fwiw:

John E. Deysher,manager of the $53 million Pinnacle Value Fund (ticker: PVFIX)
said, "MVC...has a pristine balance sheet, and most of its investments are
holding up fairly well. Second, there is some question as to what the values of
these private companies are. Clearly, valuation multiples are coming down, but
MVC is very conservative in its valuations. It has a net asset value of $17 a
share right now and is trading for 9. They have taken markdowns on a couple of
portfolio companies. But we think most of the 40 or so companies they have in
the portfolio are still doing OK. Their ability to access capital is not much
of an issue since MVC is not dependent on a lot of debt.

Where is it getting its money?

They have a big equity cushion, and their loans are maturing so they are
getting back principal, which has to be reinvested. Eventually, they will sell
some of their equity investments, hopefully at a nice profit. So right now they
are not doing a lot of buying, because they are being conservative and hoarding
the cash that they do have. But they are going to be well positioned going
forward, because the current low multiples will make merchandise available at
good prices.

Any big worries?

Yes. If the stimulus package doesn't work and we continue on this vigorous
cycle of negative news that further drives down confidence...that's not good."

Thanks for your DD - I haven't really made up my mind on LAD. I'm more worried

On another note, I like the pattern on SBLK, which did $2.55 a share in 08 and
89 cents in Q4. The idea came from 50% gains board, and I like what I see so
far. Book value indicates a large discount in the current stock price, selling
at some 75% discount. The trading activity indicates a stock destined to go

Re: small caps may be the place to be coming out of a recession. 

Friday I cancelled maybe nearly a dozen gtc buy orders for stocks, mostly small
caps: The stocks seem to have gone up so much that I'm guessing the lows have
been seen and the stocks won't drop back down to my order price. So on that
action I'm now wondering if small caps "were" the place to be, that the market
now anticipates that we're coming out of the recession, and that maybe it's too
late for focusing on buying small caps.

Otoh of course, large-caps have moved up too. For me, not as much as the small

Let's say, yes, bank ceo's are "not honest" and don't have integrity.

It's possible the banking system by its nature caused these otherwise decent
people to become dishonest and lose their integrity. Or perhaps these people
were dishonest and had no integrity before they went into banking and that they
went into the banking business because they believed they could do well there
with their dishonest approach and lack of integrity.

My opinion is that the entire ceo/executive ranks of our public companies are
riddled with 'A' types, driven to succeed at almost all costs. It's not just
bankers who don't know honesty and integrity.

That is one reason why when mutual fund managers say they visit companies to
see and speak with management and evaluate management, I am very suspicious.
These top managers are salespeople on one level. Very difficult to ascertain
honesty and integrity with any of them. Jmo.

this article summarizes what i have been saying for months way back when tarp I
was first being considered/ and through the appointment of Geithner. As I told
my incumbent congressman who is now going on his 8th or 9th term, I have
decided that the current make-up of congress is so bad that the only sensible
thing is to throw everybody out and start fresh.

as an aside, it seems curious that a stong possiblity of inability to deliver
gold at month end by the commoditiy exchanges was averted by the IMF decision
to sell some of its gold. Many Banks have been quietly involved in shorting
gold and silver through derivatives.

what is interesting is that in the same barrons a couple of pages later is an
artice about one of blacks private equity funds and how its selling at huge
discount to the reported bookvalue. and the article goes on to point out that
the debt related to these investments is going or 10-20 cents on the dollar.
This of course makes me wonder what sort of due dilligence the fund guy did
when he recommended mvc as there is no discussion as to what the debt of the
companies mvc has invested in is gong for. so how do we know whether the mvc
valuaton is conservative or not. All in all one has to question whether
sarbanes oxley has been worth anything at all for investors. I read that that
kpmg is being sued big time in connecton with their preparation of the
financial statements of new century and Im sure we will see lots of lawsuits by
investors against the rating agencies in connection with their work on mortgage
products. Sometimes the only recourse against dishonesty is legal redress.

You are right, Madharry. I have unintentionally and conveniently overlooked
considering questioning those company valuations that MVC has interests in.

This is wrong on a number of levels if I'm one who believes most, if not all,
high level executives are people who put their positions in the most favorable
light (with many execs being downright liars and maybe a goodly number being
crooks.)
=============================
Some small insider buys with MVC recently, so I am hoping that key players have
faith in the company. At least I don't see management hyping the stock and
simultaneously exiting their MVC shares.

==========
I get like this every once in a while where I come to believe the whole system
is crooked and it's not safe at all to be a small investor in the US market.
With that attitude, there's no hope and not much of a viable alternative.
Somehow I persevere, and in past, stocks bought when they looked like values
have rewarded.

no disrespect intended but having been burned so far on mcgc and others, im a
tad mistrustful of company and auditor approved valuations at this point. SInce
you are so well diversified you are more protected than I when it comes to
fraud mismanagement etc. I just find the disconnect between the bond valuations
of the the lbos and managment valuation of the equities to be curious to say
the least. My guess is that management might be saying if there were a market
for this equity this is what it would price at in normal times. while the bond
guys are looking at an existing market. this is all speculation on my part of

small insider buys is right. those are smaller buys than I usually make as a
small investor with no inside info. The sell signal put out by Mayo on the
banks is very curious to me too. Interesting how it was picked up by the wsj
and bloomberg. Is there an option expiry coming up soon? It doesnt seem to be a
great stretch to predict that banks will continue to have large losses from
charge off on consumer loans, credit card debt, and commercial real estate. But
He doesnt seem to counterbalance that with any projections from how much the
banks will make from foisting off bad loan indirectly to taxpayers and how much
the banks will make in the next cylce when inflation grows interest rates are
higher and we will still be earning nothing on our checking accounts.

Utilities: I've decided I like EIX, and although a couple of weeks late, have
stepped up and begun accumulating shares today. I like EIX for its hybrid
nature (esp. big in solar) and its geographical area, especially Southern
California. The company trades at about stated book value (which SI says is
also its tangible bv); book value in past few years has increased; in good
times company has traded over 1.5x book value; EIX pays a 4.2% dividend yield.

Stock passes my screen as a value stock based on roe and profit margins.

Utilities. In researching EIX, I've come across EONGY which in some ways, may
be a better bet than EIX. Speculatius, you and Oblomov have mentioned it here
several times and I may have been too quick to pass it by.

Although this stock too has moved up from recent lows, it still has some
attraction for me -- good dividend yield, geographical diversity. And
German-based and managed, that might be a plus.

I've latched on to a few shares of EONGY today with a view to adding a little
more if stock falls back down again.

SBLK looks okay to me for a speculative buy. I'll follow you guys in with a
small purchase.

It's not my favorite in the sector, so that encouraged me to concurrently add
to some of my other losing positions - NM, ONAV, SSW. And GNK. GNK being a new
position for me. GNK (and SSW) stock may not have the multiple improvement
possibilities of the others, but it could be the safer, given the amount and
length of its time charters (which 'should' assure its income in '09 through
'10. After that, who knows?)

re SBLK - looks OK to me as well. In for a few lottery tickets @2.51$. 560M$ in
stockholder equity with a 900M$ balance sheet is a fairly low leverage, lower
than peers. All capex is discretionary (unless they buy new ships) so they
should be able to generate strong FCF for a while. Fleet age is decent and they
have quite a few LT charters too. So there is the fact that current assets do
not cover current liabilities - in other words a liquidity squeeze. But why
would the lender not extend credit to a company with a solid looking balance
sheet and plenty of cash flow to handle interest payments?

Am I missing something?

What is your favorite in this sector?

NM my favorite now in the sector. It's a similar lottery ticket as with SBLK.
SBLK reports 93% chartered on available days in '09 and 63% in '10. Navios
reports that for them in '09 it's 89%, and in '10 it's 68%. (54% in '11) So
both companies similar in this way.

Why I tip the balance toward NM:
1. It's being recommended at around current levels by Seth Glickenhaus, the
octogenarian investor mentioned here before. I'm a fan: his public
recommendations often seem to work out okay. His value proposition for NM seems
straight-forward enough.

2. NM claims some sort of credit default insurance coverage where their
contracts with customers are insured somehow/somewhat by a third party
(government entity).

3. I have heard the ceo and 'chairman', Angeliki Frangou interviewed a couple
of times on Bloomberg, and she is very impressive. (Of course, as discussed
today, I view her role also as chief salesperson for the firm: I don't
necessarily know that she is honest or has integrity. And further, I admit to
being easily impressed.)

I take everything I see about NM as a package, and for me, NM gets the nod as
the best bulk shipper bet. Not that I'm looking closely at all the other
competitors, or that I'm any expert in the sector.

Here's a link to a recent company presentation which gives some details of
their strategy and operations:

of the ones you mentioned the only one i could consider buying right now from a
technical point of view would be sblk, but i would take my chances that it
might drop a little more and then buy it. nm would be a sell.

there is yet another blogfest about questionable motives and recommendations,
origianlly from zerohedge.com:

Let's walk through the sequence of events:
1) First Merrill Lynch/BofA gets clients to subscribe to a massively diluting
equity offering (105 million new shares out of 271 million pre-offering shares,
or 39% dilution). The offering prices at $7.10/share, a 6% discount to the
previous day closing price of $7.49. In the process Merrill pockets an
underwriting fee likely equal to 3% of the offering or around $20 million.
2) Minutes after the offering Merrill REIT analyst Schmidt comes out with a
report, changing the recommendation on the stock from a Sell to a Buy, thereby
getting the vanilla money which makes critical fiduciary decisions merely based
on what some sell-side analyst will recommend. As a result Kimco stock rises
throughout the day and closes at $9.40, a 25% premium to the closing price, and
a 30% premium to offering price of $7.10, which closed that very same day.
3) Notable here is that Schmidt had come out with a Sell (aka Underperform)
report on the company less than two months ago, on February 5, titled
"Write-downs drove the miss." Among Schmidt's concerns were the following very
salient points:
Write downs, not Q4 operating metrics, are the issue

KIM’s Q4 operating metrics took a back seat to write downs in the quarter as
the company reported a sharp drop in FFO as it booked $111.8mn in non-cash
impairment charges. These write-downs included $83.1mn for securities
investments, $22.2mn for the equity investment in JVs with Prudential and
$6.5mn for development projects in addition to $4mn of severance charges due to
a reduction in headcount. While Kimco’s shopping center operations held up
reasonably well in Q4 (rent spreads remained positive and same-store NOI was
+1.4%), the company expects far weaker results in 2009 which is common theme
running through the REIT industry.

Transaction income non-existent; lowering estimates

With the extensive write-downs, KIM’s reported 4Q08 FFO of $0.04 was $0.21
below our estimate. Looking to ’09, we expect NOI to decline 3% which includes
a 300bp decline in vacancy by YE09. Given the impact of deteriorating operating
metrics combined with a sharp reduction in transaction activity, we are
reducing our ’09 FFO estimate from $2.15 to $1.74 while our ’10 estimate drops
from $2.14 to $1.60.

Lowering PO to $12.50

Due to lower projected NOI growth for ‘09, we reduced our forward NAV for KIM
from $17.04 to $14.13 and as a result our PO falls from $15.50 to $12.50 which
is roughly a 10% discount to forward NAV. Given the weakness in retail spending
and cautious leasing environment combined with a sharp erosion in Kimco’s
noncore business segments we are maintaining our Underperform rating until we
gain better visibility on the retail landscape.4) Even assuming Merrill's
Chinese Wall is fully operational, it would be curious to see how the company
managed to "sell" to its clients a stock offering in which its very own analyst
had a Sell rating: the cynics among us would presume these very clients would
have no problem buying into the offering if they knew or anticipated a change
in recommendation (especially one from a Sell to a Buy), and knew they could
flip the stock they bought through the offering for a 30% gain in one day!
5) And now for the piece de resistance. The company said in its prospectus it
would use the offering proceeds to pay down its revolver. "We intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering for debt repayment and for general corporate
purposes. Our U.S. revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature in October
2011 and accrues interest at LIBOR plus 0.425% per annum. Affiliates of certain
of the underwriters are lenders under our U.S. revolving credit facility and
will receive their pro rata share of repayments thereunder from the net
proceeds of this offering." That last bit is critical. The company's $1.5
billion credit facility, on which it had $707 million outstanding as of
December 31, will be the direct beneficiary of the offering as the entire $707
million amount would be paid down with the proceeds. And what entity benefits
from this paydown: none other than Bank Of America, otherwise known as Merrill
Lynch!
Ah, good old circular conflicts of interest. To summarize: i) Merrill, which is
probably not too happy with having lent out Kimco $707 million on its credit
facility, underwrites a $720 (including a 15% overallotment) stock offering for
which it gets $20 million, ii) Merrill's analyst changes the stock from a Sell
to a Buy, causing it to pop 30% in one day, and allegedly allowing participants
in the offering to sell their shares at a 30% gain in a day, a mindblowing
annualized return, iii) Kimco uses to proceeds to repay Merrill's credit
facility, cleaning out any credit risk exposure Merrill might have with respect
to Kimco's underperforming properties and operations...

In conclusion - to those that managed to get in on the stock offering:
congratulations. The 30% return in one day is nothing to sneeze at. To all
those other retail and institutional accounts, who piggybacked, and all day
were buying the shares sold by the follow-on participants (likely using
Merrill's brokerage desk as an intermediary, thereby generating even more
profits for the company), hopefully you see something about the dreary mall
REIT space that Zero Hedge is missing. Then again, as these purchasers are
likely the very same people who are convinced that all the bad news in this
market are lagging indicators, with all the seasonally adjusted "good" news are
leading, the fair price of KIM to them is likely much, much higher. We hope
they are right: in the meantime it never hurts to look at a cash flow or FFO
model, and determine just how much cash a 38% equity-diluted KIM will be
generating in the future as the bulk of its mall tenants either go bankrupt or
decide they simply can not afford the rising rents that retail REIT operators
hope to charge.
