Looks like the sample write up (2002-2003) had some good performers:

Even now TONS might work: steel companies are popular again. MDTH with its low

from lows.

Paul and all, Agree it is very difficult to have several people agree on one
stock idea and buy them. I guess this is what Warren Buffett said about value
investing - people either take it on the first encounter or never. I think it
is even more complex than that - people also have different way of seeing the
"value". Warren Buffett changed Ben Graham's original way and made a huge
success. Ben's method is so tough to implement - a value investor would
probably have to wait a long time (couple years) to buy some stock.

I have developed my own way of seeing the value too, ALVR and PCYC were simple
below-cash debt-free picks. EONC is more like a "growth at reasonable price".
Warren Buffett bought many great stocks far above book value, and appreciated
many times after.

Back to people sharing ideas here - I wonder how many people bought ALVR, PCYC
and EONC after reading my (and others) recommendation here?

I don't disagree with looking to energy for investment ideas.

re the Party's Over- look to clean coal conversion technologies (GTL), hydrogen
derived from nuke cogen, and tapping of hydrates to supplement future energy
supplies.

Why, we even have things like biodiesel (created from recycled fryer fat or
various sorts of edible oils ala Palm oil) and companies developing commercial

Brinks, I've come to the conclusion that if I make detailed analyses, they are
not that helpful to me in making a buy decision, or a hold or sell decision
either.

I like to have what I call a "ruling reason" for buying a particular stock.
It's generally categorical such as low p/e and low p/bk; perhaps revision to
mean; maybe price below cash; maybe GAARP, maybe something else. When I buy, I
usually can state the ruling reason within a couple of sentences.

I haven't figured out if the ruling reason logic has been a factor in allowing
me to move to such a diverse number of holdings, or if my proclivity for
holding many shares has led me to try to justify 'ruling reason' in lieu of
detailed analyses. -g-

this business cycle at reaching 1.5x, maybe 2x its stated book value (i.e.

OT - investment philosopies
Paul, I am rereading Malkiels "Random Walk down Wall Street" and think more
highly of this book than I did 3 years ago.I do believe in the efficient market
theory to some extend so don't think there will ever be a simple system that
allows an investor to outperform the market. If it were as easy as finding
stocks with low P/E or high dividend yields a lot of investors will figure it
out, drive the stocks up and reduce the forward returns for these types of
stocks.

But I also do believe that anomalies do exist and can be exploited. I think one
of the main advantages of value investing is that an investor will avoid what
Malkiel calls "Castle in the sky"; investment fads like the internet bubble and
possibly right now the small cap or the natural gas bubble. I see this as a
main virtues of value investing, and because a value investor is more likely to
avoid these fads that occur due to mass frenzies, he should be able to
outperform the broad market.

With respect to the current market psychology I feel we have come full circle
since the Mo-Mo days in 2000, especially after reading your comment regarding
"betting on the jockey rather than the horse". There seems to be an abundance
of stockpickers with a hot hand posting their findings on message boards and
plenty of people willing to bet on the "Jockey" as is apparent from the
performance of the stockpicks after they are posted.My gut feeling is that if
it indeed is so easy to make money, the party is propably almost over.

On another topic Malkiels has a chart in his book on P.291 which I overlooked
the first time I read this book. This chart shows the forward 10 year annual
return for stocks as a function of stock market P/E. The chart evidently shows
that the forward annual return for stocks falls as the P/E increases. Based on
that correlation the current market current market P/E of about 20 suggest that
the
forward annual stock market return for the next 10 years would in the order of
5%. This is not much different than Warren E Buffet's estimate of a 6% stock
market return which was given when the market was some 20% lower. Now of course
the real returns for the next 10 years out
could be much higher or lower but this number does reasonable for me and sets
my expectation.

My own goal is to get 8% + annual returns without excessive risk so I guess I
need to outperform the market by 3% annualy to get there.
Just a rant and food for thought.

Spekulatius and Paul, I agree that the market is entering the stage of "self
propelling rally" and there will be an ugly retreat. While I don't claim I
would be able to catch the top and get out in time, I don't believe in the
theory that nobody can do that either. There are usually a lot of signs of the
top - such as the shoeshine guys buying YHOO/QCOM and outperforming Warren
Buffett in a month or two. There are also technical indicators that help to
identify the top. My 200% return in 2003 (no margin) could be just a lucky year
and it is possible that I may give the gain back, but I do try to stay cool and
not being carried away. I am actually very cautious now and ready to short more
stocks to hedge the gain.

From talking to my individual investors friends, I found a lot of people still
holding cash, hesitate to get back into the market. It is definitely not the
early 2000 time that in every party you hear people bragging about stock gains.
That's the main reason I am not pulling the trigger to get out yet. The last
leg of the rally is usually the crazest, I am still holding onto ALVR now at 13
(I recommended multiple times here at 1.86, 3.5, 5), I know the risk is higher
but my model tells me there is still a chance to get couple bucks out of it.
ALVR is a dream stock for value investors - I bought it at 45% discount to cash
value while debt-free, it now turned into a growth star, it may turn into a
"next big thing" stock in a year. I am hoping it be acquired by CSCO or QCOM.
Anyway my target is 30% annually and I have done that in past 5 years. Maybe my
target is too high and it may cause a big problem in the future, but I am just
not satisfied with 10% annual return.

Steve, 200% is an awesome return but it's not easy to do. I doubt one can do
30%/year without taking a very high risk and over the course of the years a
high risk sooner or later very likely will lead to a devastating decline. If
the market were indeed to return 5%/year for the next 10 years, 8% return would
be a very nice result and 30% would almost be a 6 sigma event. That fact is
that if I want to get returns higher than the market,I must take it from
somebody else. I try to to set my own expectation too high, i know that I am
the most vulnerable when I am greedy or overconfident.

Most people I know have a high percentage of their liquid assets in stocks
already and very few have large hoard of cash laying around despite drawing
from home equity over the last few years. Apparently this does not match your
experience.

It's amazing to me that the stock ran up as much as it did without becoming
profitable. I do realize that the topline has improved. It's trading a 4x
tangible book value, 50x forward earnings, currently is loosing money. Why do
think it still has legs to go up? i can see that the chart looks good but

However several of the biotech stocks are still at least 50% below where I

prices below their 50day moving averages. Now only 2 out of 27 are under their

In US dollars -- base is $1.87 in 2005, best case is $5.12 in 2007. Other
analysts had the same in 2005 ($1.75 or so) so I think the company is leading
and helping them closely. I think there may be some upside to the 2005 numbers
based on the tone of the latest earnings announcement and the solid backlog. I
agree with the analyst who writes "the market opportunities are enormous, while
barriers to entry are huge..."

Hoyasaxa, I don't have a good definition for "good company". Here are a few
companies whose stocks I own whose prices are not at highs. Most of these
companies have been mentioned previously here or on Buffettology thread. They
might still be buys; they might not be: (in no particular order)

IACI: Barry Diller's internet conglomeration. I recently added to my position.

STRD: Discussed here recently. Cigar butt with cash somewhat under current
price. Margin of safety. I hope a turn-around situation for patient holders.
Very thinly traded. My opinion is that it's not a stock for casual value
players.

STNR: Has been very profitable running salons in cruise ships. Big issue is
that at least one line has decided they can do as well, and to test that,
they've kicked STNR off a couple of new ships and put their own people/products
in. (Summary from memory. May have specific facts wrong, but the issue is
correct.) STNR may be able to cope, may not. I bet small that they can.

ANF: Have they lost their marketing touch? Are they out of touch with their
customers? Strong brand, low p/e (if earnings are there)--- still worth a small
bet at current price, imo.

TZA: Crooked or sleazy management perhaps. But to me, business looks intact and
going forward, the company seems like a pretty good play on growing Hispanic tv
market.

SGR: Wins another government construction order. (PCR on my watch list. Oops
and dang. Missed it!) Okay psr, p/bk. These construction companies - I don't
know if it's the % completion accounting they use (?), but they seem to
suddenly and occasionally restate earnings DOWN. Small commitment in SGR only.

I like home building stocks as well, and they've come off from highs. But if
anyone wasn't interested in them in the past few years, they likely wouldn't be
looking to buy them now either, I would guess.

By the way, don't be in a hurry to sell your SEMI, despite today's big move. I

Jeff you are absolutely right and Malkiel states that a large part of the P/E
ratio changes are due to changes in LT interest rates. This does mean pricing
stocks such that a forward return of 5%/p.A can be expected when LT interest

re ALVR

Spekulatius, on surface it is hard to believe that ALVR went from $1.86 to $13
in 11 months while it is still losing money. But I found it normal from my past
experience. The market always look ahead 6-12 months regarding a company. The
current $13 price tag pretty much anticipate that ALVR will make about $0.25 in
2004, and I think it is possible to make $0.5-0.8 in 2005. That's why I think
more upside is possible.

Enron was on the cover page of Fortune as the number 1 best performing SP500
stock in 1999(or another year). The profit number and estimates were very good.
The point is current earnings and analyst estimates are not reliable. I believe
the earnings are unpredictable in most cases, especially the analyst estimates.
One has to make a call on if the earning will beat the estimates 6-12 months
ahead. One should never look back the earnings and current earnings. I am
making the call that ALVR will beat estimates so I think it still have chance
to go up. As for why I made that call - it is hard work DD, including flying to
China and talk to the telecom administration, ALVR customers, integrators and
management, talk to their competitors, know the industry and company, use my 20
years IT industry insight including successfully found and grew a company, ...

When you hear someone was able to have his number 1 largest holding grow 6x or
20x while still holding the position, it is usually not pure luck. ALVR is
close to my third home-run (I define it as 10x) after PHTN and SINA, both 20
baggers. I think it is likely a 10 bagger for me, and even a potential 20
bagger again if everything goes smoothly as it is now.

>> If only I could find a good company not trading at or close to their 52-week
high!

FWIW, I am trying to let go of my natural inclination to bottom fish and be
willing to pay up in price, if all the other stars line up. I am now more
willing to buy strength. Of course fundamentals and valuations matter, but I
try not to wait for the big dip if everything else looks good. Yet I admit it's
a struggle sometimes.

Hey, I'm a frugal guy. And I missed some great runs because I wasn't willing to
pay up for quality or growth or consistency.

Take a look at these beautiful 1 yr. charts. All are near their 52 week high.
Yet notice the reasonable PEs (except TYC). Look at their EPS line at
BigCharts.com and you'll see most of them have been growing earnings steadily.

wrld+

The point? If you were afraid to buy anytime in the last year because the stock
was at its 52 week high you would've missed a nice gain.

So how did STHLY go from $7 to $14 in one year? One penny at a time, my friend,
with each increment potentially being a new 52 week high.

Contrast those charts with this one, a company that kept showing "great buying
opportunities" when you compared the current price to its 52 week high:

Caution: rambling post with not much of a point:

Very difficult and troubling for me in dealing with the stock picks of
successful investors who seem to be really comfortable and confident of their
selections.

We see a number of such people on SI who through superior intellect, or
superior dd, or creative research, or industry or personal contacts, or
excellent common sense, or some good luck - or some combination of factors
-have put together some winning stocks. And these people are acknowledged here
and elsewhere for their good record.

When one of these people recommends or re-recommends a particular stock, the
rest of us should pay attention. I believe that these people are generally
right. Because they have been. (Of course, they could be right until they're
not, until the market favors a different type of stock, the market corrects, or
whatever.) I am one who will look at the jockey though - maybe I shouldn't, but
I do.

I'd like to pick a specific stock to illustrate, but I don't want to
personalize it here, so I'll mention a stock not discussed on this thread:
TMXN. If you search for it on SI you will find at least a couple of very good
stock pickers (that's imo, based on my casual observation and what other people
seem to say) who've recommended this stock, who own it and still believe it has
a good future. I don't know the future of the stock, but I believe these good
stock pickers to be right (as they often have been), and the stock will rise
(maybe after some correction, maybe just keep increasing as it has been).

IF the purpose of investing is to make money and IF TMXN is believed to be a
good speculation (I hesitate to say 'investment' here on a Ben Graham thread),
I suppose I ought to be a buyer because today I believe the stock will continue
to move higher. (I am influenced by the guys who are sure and have good size
bets that it will.)

OTOH, I can't understand much about TMXN. It's a dinky company with not much
history. And if the attraction of TMXN at current price isn't clear to me, then
it also seems to me many on SI who are buying it are making a leap of faith
that the people recommending it will come through for them as they have in the
past. And that people buying now or recently will be able to make money from
their buying TMXN, and that is the whole purpose. Or is it?

I try to look at investing as a process. To me it's not just a matter of making
money in one stock or a lot of money in a couple of stocks this year or making
a big score and retiring. I see investing as a long-term process where, if I
can get the process right (or at least right for me), then the results will
inevitably (hopefully) flow. And so I look for repeatable things that I can do.
If I don't understand a company and yet I purchase a stock because I believe in
the jockey, then I've trapped myself. I've made that part of my process, and
I'm dependent on a particular jockey or several of them. And if he or she or
they go away, the good results stop too. So even though I get teased about
never seeing a stock I don't like, if I don't find some ruling reason about the
company prospects or I can't put the stock into one of the many categories I
use, stocks like TMXN will be moving up without me.

I do have some of the stocks that have been strongly recommended on SI. Where
that's a problem for me is the sell decision. I have a tendency to listen to
the strong believers and hold too long. Given my lack of detailed knowledge
about any particular company, that sometimes means I'm among the last to know
to sell a stock.

Ah cripes, these may just be my issues. -g-
We know how difficult it is to get three people here to buy the same stock. So
maybe there are just a lot of curmudgeons on the thread. Lol! Guys not easily
swayed by anybody else's opinions, no matter how good the jockey looks.

That's probably all to the good. :>)

Paul, you are not alone with your gripes. And I say that even though I did some
plays myself, like TVIN.OB and currently CHAR.OB. There are a few players with
a very similar style who are successful with a blend of more of less thorough
fundamental analysis and momentum based speculation.
Weather that approach works for an extended time I do not really know - at know
at least one of the players from the telecom heydays, so he has not retired
since then. I also think that for the followers, the returns are more likely
much less, as the thin market leads to sharply rising prices. I also can say
that when their analysis covers an area where i have technical expertise i have
been usually not all that much impressed, which cautions me to be very careful.
That aside, i think they clearly are doing something right, so I try to learn
and play this game with a small part of my trading portfolio when the
risk/reward ratio seems favorable.

Paul, I feel your pain on tracking the jockey and agree that the problem is not
so much the buy (albeit difficult to buy enough to track ALL the good jockeys)
but the sell. If you don't understand why you bought, you cannot very well
understand why you should sell.

The answer for me, and probably for most of us, has been to pay most attention
to jockeys that select stocks that appeal to my personal sense of value. That
is pretty obvious but gets tricky in a market like this one. To my sense of
value, there are few stocks that appeal right now, which is crystalized for me
when Jim Clarke (a favorite jockey) comes to the board looking for ideas. I'm
just not attracted to most suggested stocks (including those on the safe and
double lists) and the fight is to, as Sergio Leone once told Clint Eastwood,
"[not] just do something but stand there". The temptation is to start chasing
that which I do not understand (despite the excellent record of the various
jockeys) and that's dangerous. A good pitch for one batter is not necessarily a
good pitch for me and I'd rather be patient with my cash than chase.

All that said, it's maddening to sit, bat on shoulder as the market rocks
along.

Very interesting Morningstar column today. Snip:

Stocks with Earnings vs. No Earnings
Charles Royce of Royce & Associates said in a recent Wall Street Journal
interview, "There has been a tremendous benefit [in 2003] in owning speculative
stocks." I hereby declare this to be the understatement of the century.

Out of 5,999 stocks in our database, 2,496 had negative earnings last year.
These 2,496 stocks gained 117%, on average. They have a trailing three-year
standard deviation of 102%. (Standard deviation is a measure of volatility--the
higher the standard deviation, the more volatile the stock.) By contrast,
stocks with positive earnings gained 68% last year and have a standard
deviation of just 44.6%.

Financial Health
Morningstar assigns Financial Health grades to all the stocks in our database
(A is the best grade, and F the worst). These grades are based on
interest-coverage ratios and debt levels. Here's the breakdown of 2003 stock
returns by Financial Health grade:

Grade Average Return
A 55.6%
B 68.9%
C 94.9%
D 115.8%
F 110.7%

So it really does appear true that the riskier the stock, the better its return
last year. This is why many of the same mutual funds and investment newsletter
portfolios that were at the bottom of the performance rankings in 2002 came out
near the top in 2003.

Tech Stocks vs. Nontech Stocks
I can confidently say that we're in a second bubble for technology stocks.

There are 1,150 technology stocks in our database (with technology stocks
defined as those in the hardware, software, and telecom sectors). On average,
these stocks gained 137% last year, with a median return of 74%. The median
trailing P/E ratio of these stocks was 31.2 as of Dec. 31, and the forward P/E
was 34.6. (The latter two statistics exclude stocks with no trailing earnings,
or with no analyst estimates for next year's earnings, so they're skewed low.)
The median price/book, price/sales, and dividend yields on these are 2.3, 2.0,
and 0.2%, respectively.

Nontech stocks returned 77% on average last year, with a median return of 40%.
The trailing and forward P/E ratios on these are 19.8 and 18.2, respectively.
In addition to lower P/E ratios, these stocks have lower price/sales and
price/book ratios and a higher average dividend yield (1.1%). They're not cheap
by historical standards but probably aren't in a bubble, either.

It seems to me that 2003 closely resembled 1999--a bifurcated go-go market.
There's one big difference, though: In 1999 you could find some really cheap
stocks if you turned over just a few conspicuously hidden rocks. Old economy
and small-cap stocks were dramatically undervalued, especially those with
healthy dividend payouts, such as REITS, insurance companies, and small
regional banks.

Today, that's not the case. We've already seen data showing that small-cap
stocks are no longer very attractive after running up dramatically in 2003.

EK - FWIW, I spent a fair amount of time sniffing around their CES extravaganza
last week. Their current ploy is to sell 'connectivity'; whatever that is? They
believe that their brand name will overcome pricing differentials.

It seems to me that a couple of kids in a garage can hook together various
electronic gadgets to share images, etc. wired via USB ports, or wirelessly via
standard interfaces.

I was brushed off by someone in R+D who mysteriously alluded to unannounced
bottled magic in their labs.

At the Sanyo area, I saw the EK/Sanyo OLED panel that big K is using in their
cameras. Very pretty. Blue still lasts only 5000 hours, which means that
without RGB correction, which they don't incorporate, colors get really weird.
The larger, general use OLED panel ~3X4 in. had a lighted static display. It
will (hopefully) reach production by yearend 2004 - which means "maybe next
year" for you Brooklyn Dodger fans.

(Needless to say the 6 oz. Sanyo pocket camcorder with a spectacular LCOS
display next to the OLED's was getting all the attention.)

In other words, EK appears to be a tech start-up with debt serviced by a buggy
whip business trying to avoid being the next K-Mart. (Oh, the Xerox guys at
their tiny booth next to EK didn't seem worried by Kodak's purchase of Scitex's
graphics business....May I express my sincere gratitude to EK for sending me
cash for my fractional interest in SCIX.)

Rock, we all have to live with the results of our own investments. I think it

That said, I think it is beholden on someone who sees something strongly

eliminated by more information.

I can't emphasize this last point enough. With my extensive financial

lot of homework on, and my view won't change 95% of the time. However, laziness

I am not impressed at all with that analysis you quote!

At the beginning of last year, the kind of money-losing stocks that performed
as described in 2003 were priced as if they were going out of business, at the
end of a bear market that was particularly vicious for technology companies.
Since most will not go out of business, a major rebound occurred. A more
credible analysis might have pointed out that these companies recovered from
15% of their 2000 highs to 30% of such highs (numbers hypothetical but
reasonable).

How else was I able to buy FARO at $2+ last March, down from a 1997 high of
$18, and losing money in 2002. It did quite a bit better than lose money in
2003, which is why it is now $32.

I will try again. At the end of the bear market, those companies were priced
for bankruptcy exactly because of the absence of good characteristics. The
better quality companies were not. It was totally expectable that when almost
all survived the average performance was far superior in 2003, because the
large bankruptcy risk discount was removed.

The most notable example is SONS which went from 18 cents in 10/02 (on death's

JB, I concur on your analysis, as I work for a company that went through your
"bankrupsy discount" cycle and came flying out the other side. There were many
like mine and most benefited from the combination of the discount and
investor's memory of their big runs prior to 2001.

However, I'd also add that many (most?) of these comeback plays, despite
improved cost structures, have caught and then overrun their fundamentals
during the year and are now pretty richly valued. Heck, INTC, though perhaps
not the best example, just reported record numbers and got hit after hours b/c
expectations weren't realistic. As you say in your cautionary statement, this
overrun may not bode well going forward. In fact, it calls up Bill Miller's
thoughts on new leadership for a new bull (debatable that we have a new bull
but Miller says yes). The first to rally are the leaders from the last bull
(human tendency of overweighting recent experience), they then consolidate and
new leading sectors take over.

Real debate may be around the strong sectors going forward as so many are
richly valued right now. I happen to find pharms and energy to be interesting,
as both are reasonably valued (i.e. reasonable folk can disagree) and both have
good demographics going forward. The thing I don't like about pharms is that
they are so well covered that you don't tend to see the short-term dislocations
in value that are somewhat common amongst small-cap cigar butts. Naturally,
energy has those dislocations but many are real wildcatter businesses (pun
intended) that are hard to trust.

Completed my buying of KTEC for my "swing for the fences" stock and can finally
post my notes. Key Technology is a small ($83 mil revenue; 483 employees)
company that makes food- and material-processing automation equipment. Using
some rather impressive optical and process technology, their systems are used
to evaluate fresh fruits and vegetables, beans, potato chips, snacks, and wood
products. Items can be sorted by color, size, and shape to identify defective
or inconsistent products for removal by a blast of air while processing huge
volumes. The company also makes conveyor and sorting systems for the
pharmaceutical, tobacco, and coffee industries. Key Technology has plants in
Washington, Oregon, and overseas in the Netherlands.

As I was thinking about James' challenge, I was thinking successful picks need
to have the following characteristics: under the radar or misunderstood, some
inefficiency built into the current stock price, growing if not outstanding
fundamentals, and a strong chart. I think KTEC is such a company, but it took
some time to complete my DD and build a position. My research led to the
pleasant surprise that I had a college buddy who is now a CEO living out of
state and sits on the KTEC board. He's a high integrity guy and I trust him;
took awhile to get a hold of him but we had a nice conversation about KTEC.

KTEC needed some time to digest recent acquisitions and wring out some costs;
this plus the downturn in the economy led to a loss in 2001. KTEC's revenues
and earnings growth are 21.0% and 200.0%, respectively, in the company's most
recent published filing. Q1 results will be announced Jan. 29. The company told
me the seasonality of their business has led in the past to strong orders in
Q2.

They've reduced debt to $6.2 mil in 2003 from $40mil in 2000. Have excess cash
now and strong cash flow.

The company did $1.15 last year and $.47 in 2002. KTEC does not give EPS
guidance, but Needham came out this week with a 2004 estimate of $1.40.
(Forward PE of 11.82) When I talked to the company they pointed out that they
have a goal to double their revenue in 5 years. Using that 15% growth rate for
EPS, I show a nice upside:

Company: KTEC
Date: 1/12/04
Next year's expected earnings: $1.40
Estimated EPS growth rate: 15
P/E maximum used for estimate: 15
Graham Fair Value: $44.35
Current Price: $16.55
$ difference: $27.80
Percent Growth to Fair Value: 167.9%

Per MarketGuide, KTEC's ratios looks good compared to others in the
miscellaneous capital goods sector (vs. industry average):

P/Cash Flow 11.6 (16.6)
P/Free Cash Flow 6.0 (28.7)
P/Sales 1.0 (1.8)
P/Book 2.6 (4.0)
P/Tangible Book 4.3 (6.8)
P/E 14.3 (25.1)
EPS 5 yr. growth rate 42.6% (3.7%)
Total Debt/Equity .1 (.7)
ROA 11.4% (6.8%)
ROI 17.6% (8.7%)
ROE 21.8% (12.5%)
Gross Margin 41.1% (31.4%)
Profit Margin 7.0% (6.3%)

They are #1 in the food and tobacco market (inspection products, 35-40% of
revenue) and #1 in fruit, vegetables, and fries (process products, 35-40%). The
remaining revenue comes from parts and service. They have 53 US patents and 21
non-US.

Even though it is thinly traded, 32% of KTEC stock is held by institutional
holders. 4.85mil shares outstanding; 3.9mil float.

can be accessed on the Investor Relations page of the Company's web site

Last Q headline:

Key Technology Sales Rise 18% for FY2003 and 21% for Q4

Full Year Diluted EPS hits $1.15, Backlog up 33%

Snip:

New orders received during the fourth quarter were $23.2 million, compared to
$13.6 million in the same period last year. The Company's $20.1 million backlog
at September 30, 2003 reflects a 33% increase compared with the $15.1 million
backlog at the close of fiscal 2002.

CEO comment: "The order volume in the fourth quarter was the highest recorded
in the Company's history for that period and reflects what we believe is an
improving capital investment environment among our customers. We are
particularly pleased that we are winning orders for multiple systems from our
larger customers, as this bodes well for future business. While we anticipate
some normal seasonal effects during the first quarter of the new fiscal year,
we are encouraged with our healthy year-end backlog and are optimistic about
our prospects in fiscal year 2004."

Yes, the KTEC CEO sold some stock. I asked the company and my director friend
about that and was comfortable with the answer (a very small portion of his
holding and part of his regular routine.)

I did get my first buy in around $15, and it's been moving steadily since.
(Edit: tried to get some orders filled around $14 but was unsuccessful.) Needed
to build my position before I posted my write up.

Funny thing about the Needham rec and estimate - the KTEC contact I was talking
to hadn't seen it yet. I took it as a positive sign that they had their heads
down, working hard, focused on business and a big product show in Portland next
week, rather than hyping the stock and checking to see what's being written
about them.

Thanks for the comment.

Paul, feeling a little better about where you added more to your SEMI position
:-)

Quite a long time ago, when the stock market was not so rosy, I said that it
would get to $8-10 and possibly $10-15. If you look at a long term chart, it
exceeded $10 in every upswing in the last dozen years. The stunning
semiconductor industry forecasts that I have seen recently are calling for 33%
or even 40% sales growth next year; and the stock market is much stronger. It
is conceivable the stock could see the all-time high of $24+, but I am not
predicting that now.

So many stocks mentioned here in past are up now. I could mention a bunch that
I followed posters into that they were right about (the rising market makes
many heroes), but I guess I'd rather just let these posters comment. Instead,
I'll just mention a few stocks (they are mostly not value stocks) that I have
that aren't working so well for me now - i.e. that've dropped in price recently
- and what I'm doing about it:
(in no particular order and not an all-inclusive list)

PTR. Lot going on with the company. Stock's come down sharply recently. Several
negative stories - downgrades, refinery closure, etc. I've been adding small
amounts recently, including today.

FCN. Down a bit from recent prices. No news out that I see. I'll continue to
hold.

GCI. Stock seems unable to hold its high, and has drifted down. I'll hold.

TSB. Stock seems in a down channel since October. I see nothing that would be a
catalyst to propel the stock higher. There could be business issues or the
economy that further negatively affect the stock. I continue to hold a very
small exploratory position.

BNHN. On my part, the shame/pride ratio is large. Embarrassed to admit I still
have a small exploratory position. Not much price improvement since 9/02. I sit
with a loss; will try to wait another couple of quarters to see if company
performance improves.

LENS. Ouch. Ouch. Larger than expected losses. Negative media articles,
downgrades. I will try to hold on for a recovery maybe by next year. Drat.
If stock drops from current $6.60 to about $5.60, I might add more. That'd be
about 2x cash for a company with no ltd.

ACAI. I was hoping the merger would go through. Company has a good history, but
planning on revamping itself into a point-to-point carrier like Jet Blue.
Analysts are not encouraging. I'll hold for a while, hoping there's a base
around current price. If no good news is forthcoming, I may sell for short-term
capital gains loss.

AAPL. Off from recent highs. Stock has been discussed here in some depth, and
at least one poster has said he's now taken profits. I'm still holding (only
have had a very small exploratory position); haven't made a decision on what
I'll do.

UTSI. Down from summer peak. Now at $38, it can't seem to stick above $40. Hard
company to figure; business subject to many strong outside influences
(gov't/technology). Not a value stock. I continue to hold.

ABT. Good earnings but lousy forecast apparently. Stock down from highs. Imo,
the stock's in that area where it's not a buy and it's not a sell either.

CULS. Down a bit from my recent purchase. I call it random fluctuation. If
stock continues to drop on no bad news, I'll consider adding to my exploratory
position.

TSIC. Huge loss announced. I'll continue to hold, but extent and surprise of
the loss discourages me from adding to the position.

EFX. Stock hasn't done much since Aug '02. Executive changes, writeoffs. This
company can be very profitable, with high profit margins. I expect that to
resume. I'll hold on.

Homebuilders. Sigh. I've added to positions (DHI, SPF)

re ACAI (Atlantic Airlines)
The stock seems very cheap on the surface. Good balance sheet. Stock seams to
be trading at a large discount to some better known peers. Is this just due to
the issues with the UAL contract?

Travelling by air is an awful experience right now. Double lines for checkin,
strip searches - it takes at least 1h if not more to get through on a flight.
Fingerprints for foreign visitors to the US is an insult. In Europe you don't
have to put down your fingerprint for anything except if you are an convict.
This cannot be good for the industry. But that is a problem for the industry in

ACAI: It's more than just contract issues with UAL. ACAI profited from its
feeder relationship with UAL. Now that that relationship is changing and very
likely ending, there's uncertainty as to what ACAI's business model will be or

Shoe stocks. Anybody see any now as buys? I might consider adding to my
downtrodden position in SKX.

If shoes are fashion, then my view is shoe companies come in and go out of
fashion too.

SKX has a relatively low psr compared to other shoe companies I'm looking at.
That's a function of its now missing popular trends, and also possibly of
investors distaste for the family that runs the company. SKX has been able to
quickly introduce many styles. Eventually they might find one or two that
really click again with consumers.

Other shoe stocks seem to be at highs. Old thread favorite SCNYB (or SCNYA)
jumped on Friday. Occasionally-mentioned MAXS is near highs.
I don't follow NKE or RBK anymore; NKE at p/e about 23 seems toppy to me.

Jim, I am glad to see someone saw the merits. SEMI is a mediocre company I have
been in and out of for nearly 15 years, with management I do not much care for
(arrogant, family-run, self-serving and not shareholder friendly). However,
every few years it is a cigar butt that is well positioned, with high
visibility and predictability, to make a buyer a lot of money without a lot of
risk. You just have to remember not to "marry" the stock.

Note that the insiders saw it coming, granting themselves a lot of options at
$2, earlier this year. The Goldbergs own 10% of the stock though, so they have
to be somewhat on our side of the table - although you would not know it.

Disclosure: I personally have bought the stock this time from the low $2's to
$5.00, and have been publicly recommending it from time to time since about
$3.25. Since I bought a fair amount near $5, my publicity probably cost me some
money. However, I learned on FARO that getting some people with money involved
early really paid off down the road - having low cost positions from which to
add on pullbacks.

I am sticking with SCNYA from a 13.75 cost basis. The valuation ratios are
still very attractive with all their cash:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=SCNYA . Revenue growth is the only missing
ingredient to make them a major gainer.

In the meantime, net EV at 5x cash flow (total market cap/cash flow around 7)
is a tasty, cheap value play. The sector norm is market cap at 20x cash flow
and 23x FCF.

Order backlog was up at their last report. It will be interesting to see if
that translates into top-line growth for Q4. The company expects $30m sales
compared to $28m in 2002.

A good steady player to bet on, IMHO.

SKX has the low PS but no cash flow (except from inventory reduction) or
profits to speak of now. Looks like they are still in turnaround mode. I would
be interested in buying if the chart ever breaks 9.26 resistance from last
July.

Here's the 'double' portfolio with KTEC added:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/portfolio/detail.gsp?pid=9338971

I'm hoping to hear more opinions on the issue of whether the portfolios should
be left alone or whether modifications should be made. I'm open to making
changes as long as they are not frequent as I'm sure none of us is interested
in turning them into a trading game. However, if someone feels a safe stock is
no longer so (either because the valuation is too rich or the fundamentals have
changed) or that a 'doubler' has gone as far as possible and they have a new
candidate or someone new wants to add their best pick, such changes would be
reasonable. It depends on whether we'd rather have a portfolio with a definite
start and end dates whose performance we'd like to track and compare to indices
or a living representation of our individual best ideas (which obviously change
over time). Any opinions?

"Strong loan demand contributed to our record revenues and net income in the
third fiscal quarter," stated Doug Jones, President and CEO. "Our third quarter
is traditionally our busiest for loan demand and we added $51.0 million in
gross loans during the quarter. Of this amount, an acquisition completed in
early December added $6.5 million to gross loans outstanding. Additionally, we
added $7.6 million more in early January with the closing of two more
acquisitions."

Net income for the third quarter rose 37.3% to $4.6 million, or $0.23 per

Kris, any opinion on BEL's recent financing?

<Tuesday January 13, 3:45 pm ET

OAKVILLE, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 13, 2004--Bennett Environmental Inc.
(TSX:BEV and AMEX:BEL), announced today that it has entered into a bought deal
financing agreement with an underwriter, pursuant to which the underwriter has
agreed to purchase 600,000 Units, each consisting of one Common Share and
one-half common share purchase warrant ("Warrant") at a price of $26.00 per
Unit, for gross proceeds of $15,600,000, for resale on a private placement
basis. Each whole Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one Common Share
at a price of $30.00 for a period of 18 months from Closing. In addition, the
underwriter has the option, exercisable until one day prior to the closing
date, to purchase up to an additional 400,000 Units that, if exercised, would
increase the aggregate gross proceeds of the offering to $26,000,000. The
offering is scheduled to close on or about February 3, 2004. The transaction is
subject to regulatory approval. All currency is in Canadian Dollars. >

The dollar amounts mentioned are Canadian, as I am sure you know, but if I am
interpreting the deal correctly, the exercise price is at a modest premium to
the current market price.

While I don't have a high comfort level in calculating the future value of
warrants, I think any dilution can be a cause for concern, but they only have
16mil shares outstanding. Overall I'm not concerned about the announcement and
think the additional cash and liquidity could be positive. BEL remains my
largest position.

What's curious to me is the reasoning behind this and if there is anything to
the suggestion this could be tied somehow to expansion in the US with the
addition of the board member who is the former governor from Michigan?
Interesting...

I had not looked at the Yahoo board until now, and was happy to see many
intelligent posts re: this matter. Here's some snips from that are germane and
reasonable in their analysis, IMO. (Note they are from several posters since
the news came out.)

- Kris

Yahoo board snips:

Yet it becomes good news to investors as one reads further about the sweetheart
deal that TD is willing to make with Bennett. TD would not be willing to spend
that kind of money now, if they were not very sure about the payoff (as
described), being there at the end of the deal. This in turn, tells every
investor that TD Securities Inc. has an awful lot of faith in Bennett's ability
to do great and make the payoff (as described).

Now going a little further out. Wasn't it just a few weeks ago, that every one
of us (that does such things), calculated that Bennett had enough Cash on hand,
plus income from their Cash Flow, to pay for the Belledune facility? If that is
still true and I believe it is, then Bennett is preparing for a push in another
direction and one that they must feel pretty sure about. So sure that they are
willing to set up a sweetheart deal, just to make sure that they have the cash
on hand.

I actually think it was a good deal, that could potentially put another $41
million Can. in cash on the balance sheet (over $2 a share). This added to
their current cash will put them in a position to do many things. I even took a
small position this morning. The one thing I don't like is management going
back on previous statements that no new shares would have to be issued....

Stay calm. This is a no-brainer to CDN $30.00 and beyond. The folks like TD and
the other eventual Institutional holders of the warrants will want their free
candy from the warrants which are only fruitful at $30.00+. Mark my
words...they will get it there.

Savvy management usually issues stock when it believes it's good for the
company and long-term investors, i.e. when the share price is high and there's
not much dilution necessary for a lot of new cash, and/or when other financing
options are unavailable or unattractive, due to bad credit rating or high
interest rates. Bennett sold equity at a forward P/E of around 10 (2005
estimates) at the same time interest rates are at multi-decade-lows, and thus
debt is much cheaper. So either management is very savvy and knows the stock
price is not going to appreciate and may even fall in the future, or they are
just clueless regarding the effect of different financing options on
shareholder value. Actually, i think they are "just" clueless.

I think it was Warren Buffett who once recommended buying stock in companies
that can be led by idiots (as the companie's business is either so simple or
its position so invincibly strong), because "sooner or later that's exactly
what happens". Bennett is such a company. The stock is going to rise due to its
strong standing, however the rise will be slower and lower with these type of
bad deals.

My previous 1-year price target on BEL was US$40 (provided interest rates
remain low). Now, i "just" expect US$35.

Now Bennett is going to issue 1.5 million shares (or there abouts) and that
will help to achieve toward the same conditions. There will be more
outstanding. The float will be larger, and these shares will not be turning
over at every cough that Bennett makes. So for Bennett, it actually helps to
stabilize their investment conditions. Our gain, as investors is going to have
to come from the sweetheart deal between Bennett and TD Securities and the hope
that there is some 'you scratch our back and we'll scratch your back' going on,
to make the deal palatable for us investors.
At this time, I am left with the conclusion that the money derived from this
deal is going to be used (in some manner) toward expansion in the United
States.

If the decision to restart the Kirkland Lake project is declared, the
preliminary procedures will definitly suck up so much time, that Belledune will
be online, right along with St Ambroise. Then once again, when the time comes,
there should be enough profit stored to build the Kirkland Lake facility. It's
going to be all, a matter of timing and Danny Ponz along with the rest of
Bennett's management have shown that they are quite capable of that.

From Bennett's perspective - it is good to have a few extra bucks in the bank
to work with. Whether that means another plant - Kirkland Lake, US expansion,
Belledunne etc. hopefully the earnings announcement/conference call will
explain some of that. They have not turned over control of the company to TD,
they have gained a high powered backer in my eyes. Granted Bennett can seek
financing from a variety of sources - issue some debt, issue some more shares
off the shelf, credit lines etc. My thought is that they had a reason to begin
a relationship with TD.

From TD's perspective - They have shown a degree of confidence in Bennett.
Particularly with regards to the warrants - they can only exercise those if the
stock price is at $30cdn within 18months of 2/3/04. For TD to really make money
on that piece of the deal - an the other piece for that matter - the stock
price needs to be north of $30cdn. I like the stock price north of $30cdn. Big
players like TD don't typically make deals like this unless they feel like they
can make money doing it. So to me this is a vote of confidence.

Yes earnings are diluted somewhat. Yes there is a question about what happens
to those shares inside TD Waterhouse - does the trading desk get to sit on them
and unload at their discretion? Do the investment bankers get them to resell to
corporate/pension/insurance clients? Is TD viewing this as the beginning of a
long term relationship with Bennett? Does TD just like the companies prospects
and feel like they can make some good money on their new position? All good
questions... I still like the mechanics of Bennett's business and the prospects
of another plant cranking up late in 04.

Belledune is coming online. Kirkland Lake is restarted and St Ambroise is doing
what St Ambroise does best (make a lot of money for Bennett). The newly
appointed Director, a US citizen, a former governor of the State of Michigan, a
former Congressman and a former Ambassador. Now in my mind, they just don’t
come, any more powerful nor any more influential than that. Then I start asking
my self ‘Why’. Why did Bennett want this man specifically? Why would this man
want to take on being part of Bennett’s Board of Directors? You soon realize
that there must have been several discussions that took place before this
appointment. The appointment shows that everyone was satisfied with the
arrangements that were made and which are still privy to the individuals
concerned (as it should be).

It all makes great sense if I look at a map and note that a Bennett facility
could be built anywhere along the southern border of the State of Michigan.
This would benefit Blanchard’s home state, also if a second facility were to be
built toward the western end of the Upper Peninsula, that would really be
benefiting his home state. Two facilities in the same state. So, that satisfies
the ‘why’ of the Blanchard appointment in my mind. Also, please note how close
these facilities would be to Oakville, closer than the one located in
Belledune, New Brunswick.

If I accept the foregoing, regarding the facilities in Michigan, then the next
question is Bennett. What could Bennett do with two such facilities and what
areas would they service? The one established at the southern Michigan border
would open up four states and parts of some others. Those being Michigan, Ohio,
Indiana & Illinois and possibly going into some of the adjoining states. Then
there is the facility to be built on the Upper Peninsula. It would open up the
Upper Peninsula, Wisconsin, Minnesota, the western part of the Province of
Ontario and possibly a part of the Province of Manitoba. Both of these areas
are huge areas to be serviced and with a lot of business to be had.
Now to get really hypothetical; suppose Bennett finds that the Eco Logic
process works and works very well or can be made to work very well with some of
the Bennett innovation. It would also have to be economical enough, or be made
economical enough, for Bennett’s sales force to be capable of selling the
higher priced process.

The Eco Logic process uses equipment, which can be mounted on semi trailers and
taken to the contaminated site. Also we should not forget that Bennett
maintains their own manufacturing division, which produces their present
equipment.

Just the thought of such trailerized equipment at each one of the facilities,
would then allow Bennett to service much larger areas, because they could take
the curing plant to the contaminated site. One would still have to get permits
at each of those contaminated sites, but I would have a tendency to dump that
load on the owner of the contaminated site.
All in all, these trailerized facilities could equal to another Bennett
facility. Now take another look, in just one move into the State of Michigan,
Bennett has been able to literally ‘double their business’, and it all starts
from the appointment of Jim Blanchard to the Bennett Board of Directors.
I KNOW! IT’S ALL A DREAM! But, it sure made me smile.

Found this BEL story; not sure of the date. I like the tone and directness the
CEO appears to have. I remember the impressions I had when I listened to him
speak on last Q's con call.....steady, impressive, confident, level-headed.

"What upsets me is that nobody wants a solution...

"They’ve been saying things which they know to be totally untrue. We are going
to take them to task on that.

"When you’re right, you’re right, and I know this is not a problem."

Firm’s CEO defends toxic soil incinerator in Bathurst
John Bennett delivers hard-hitting speech to Chamber of Commerce

BATHURST - For someone whose name is spoken with such venom in northern New
Brunswick, John Bennett comes across as a pretty level-headed man.

The chairman and CEO of Bennett Environmental Inc., the company building a soil
treatment plant in Belledune’s Renviro Park, delivered an address yesterday at
the Greater Bathurst Chamber of Commerce luncheon.

His speech, entitled "The Other Side of The Story," was well-received by an
audience comprising about 150 business and community leaders.

Bennett revealed the results of a report by Quebec’s Ministry of the
Environment which took its own soil samples from the area around the
Saint-Ambroise plant in November 2002. It found that the level of dioxins and
furans in the samples were all below or well below nine parts per trillion.

"Environment Canada considers nine parts per trillion to be background and we
are consistently below that, so what we are measuring is background noise,"
says Danny Ponn, vice-president and chief operations officer at Bennett
Environmental. "From that, the Department of Health concluded we are not adding
to the background levels with our facility," he said.

"I think, if there is any opposition left after this news is out, it’s because
they don’t want to listen," Bennett says. "This is quite significant because it
confirms what we’ve been saying for a long time, that we’re no threat to public
health."

Bennett answered many questions people have been asking, including why the
company chose to build its plant in Belledune. "We didn’t," Bennett says. "We
were invited to come here. I received a letter from the Port Authority to come
and see if this was suitable. They sold me on coming to Belledune and New
Brunswick, and I haven’t regretted it yet," he said, considering how much
opposition there has been to the plant.

Bennett also explained why the company chose to build the plant in New
Brunswick when the soil they will treat comes from New Jersey. "Another
question that comes up is if most of your business seems to be in the U.S. why
don’t you build your plant in the U.S. where the problem is? Well, that’s not
quite true," he says. "We’ll probably be running this year 50-50 on Canadian
and U.S. business. There are other facilities similar to ours in the States,
except we are very competitive. We are proud of the fact that we are Canadian
and we don’t see why we would want to give jobs to Americans."

Several expressed their support for the project, but some in the audience
remained unconvinced. Reg Killoran, a science teacher at Bathurst High School,
said he was worried about his health and asked whether the amount of dioxins
being emitted would be continually measured. Ponn told him there is no
equipment in existence that could perform such testing.

Bennett addressed opposition to the plant, saying that is why he decided to
speak in Bathurst yesterday. "This uprising was rather surprising to us, and I
felt I should come here and address people myself," he said.

Environmental groups like the Conservation Council of New Brunswick, one of the
main opponents to the plant, have repeatedly refused to meet with them or to
visit the Quebec facility, but they do have a meeting scheduled for 2 p.m.
today in Fredericton.

"I want to discuss their problems and I just hope they’re going to listen. I
hope they will be receptive, and I won’t just be talking to a wall," Bennett
says. "They don’t have an argument. They just say all our reports are trash,
Jacques Whitford are useless, the government don’t know what they are doing,
nobody else knows what they are doing but them. They’ve only got one biologist
amongst them and she’s hardly qualified to criticize the work of PhDs in
toxicology."

He says he doubts anything he says will convince the group that the project is
safe. "They are in a serious mess. They’ve been saying things which they know
to be totally untrue. We are going to take them to task on that. They have to
give a retraction or else we’ll take them to court and they’ll be paying heavy
fines. If we can quiet them, the rest will go away. We went through this in
Saint-Ambroise several years ago, and nobody there has anything bad to say
about us now."

Bennett says a review currently being carried out by the federal government
should satisfy the Conservation Council. "They don’t trust us, they don’t trust
your government, they don’t trust Jacques Whitford (the company that carried
out the Human Health Risk Assessment), so they are getting their review. And we
are co-operating with the federal government because we’re not afraid of
anybody reviewing the data. They are all going to come to the same conclusion:
we are clean, we are the solution, not the problem," he says.

Acadie-Bathurst MP Yvon Godin asked Bennett about conducting a full
environmental impact assessment. "Why not, if you are so sure . . . let’s do it
once and for all, and then go ahead with it?"

"We are not a large project," Bennett replied. "They have rules of what
requires a full EIA and we don’t fall into that category. We’ve studied. I
don’t understand what else you will find out doing a full EIA for one thing. We
have been through this now in Quebec, and . . . have seven years of history (at
the plant in St. Ambroise). Even the people who wrote that report that came out
last night and said there was no risk to health, they were against this three
or four years ago."

He says a full EIA would delay the project by at least two years.

"What upsets me is that nobody wants a solution, they just want to keep
studying. Further studies wouldn’t add anything. That’s what we’ve already
done. I just think it would be a total waste of everybody’s money and time," he
said.

The plant is 50 per cent complete. It expects to start doing test burns in May
and June and plans are to have it up and running by the end of the summer.

Bennett says all the opposition to the project hasn’t discouraged him from
settling in the village.

"When you’re right, you’re right, and I know this is not a problem. So I knew
as long as New Brunswick stuck behind their word, we would build the plant," he
says.

While calculating the future value of the warrants is tricky,calculating the
value of this deal from BEL's side of the equation is simple. We'll see what it
means from the shareholder's perpective.

Thanks for your opinion as well as taking the time to highlight the Yahoo
board.

you throw out some statements that i take issue of- the key to investment
success is different for each person. I know that I will pick some losers and
some winners- but if i get rid of my losers soon enough before they turn into
disasters i will make money overall and that is my goal. In fact I personally
made money with all of my purchases of inap but i find that if i stick with a
stock when i have lost all confidence in management it really grates on me and
i am better off moving on and investing in companies where i still have some
faith in the management.
that is why i never invest in management when they reprice their options after
a severe decline or when they concoct schemes to reward themselves what i
consider to be a bigger piece of the pie than they deserve. the only way i can
voice my displeasure of such practices is not to invest in such companies.

KTEC up 7.5% to new 52-week high on over 6 times average volume. FWIW, my
response to a recent PM:

I haven't seen KTEC's products in action but sure did get an indication of
their impressiveness by listening to the Needham presentation. The ability to
pick and eliminate a product with a defect while sustaining such high volume is
indeed impressive.

Regarding the depressed stock price in the past, I would guess it was the same
concerns I had: low volume/small float, it took some time to digest and benefit
from the acquisition and the cyclical nature of their business. But I have to
agree with you as far as big customers going with the #1 vendor, not unlike the
70's joke about not being fired for choosing IBM.

A rise in capex spending will benefit KTEC, as I see numerous references in
past press releases and other documents about deferred spending and customer
schedule changes.

I'm encouraged there is a new, younger CEO who appears to have some vision for
new markets and good energy. (Their CEO of 21 years retired in August.) New CEO
Kirk Morton had been President and COO since 2001 and came from Stein, a unit
of FMC Corp., of which I know nothing.

I was impressed with their sales gains in poultry, pet food, and snack food, so
market diversity seems to have helped. Annual report: "Sales growth was notable
for the breadth and depth across our product lines, geographic areas, and
market segments."

They seem pleased with the market reception of the new, smaller footprint
inspection system they call "Optyx." Snip from their 10-K:

In fiscal 2001, the company developed and introduced its new automated
inspection system named Optyx. The sorter has the power and sorting
capabilities of a large sorter in an economical and compact machine. Optyx
employs the advanced camera, lighting, image processing, and ejection
technologies used in the Tegra and Prism products. The lower cost Optyx system
is ideal for smaller processors and lower volume processing lines which were
previously unable to justify the expense of a larger sorter. Present and
potential applications include the Company’s traditional potato, fruit,
vegetable and tobacco markets. The Company is pleased with the market
acceptance of this product.

In a 10/2/03 press release they mention selling multiple unit of Tegra and
Optyx to two customers for $6mil. Tegra appears to be positioned as a solution
for the "challenging" sorting applications.

I was stunned to read in their 10-K that they have 52 employees doing R&D and
"sustained engineering." That's what, 11% of their total employees? Besides all
the patents, maybe that's what it takes to be number one in so many markets!

About the time the stock took off, a Yahoo message post from April 24, 2003
mentioned the "huge numbers" of .23 a share and a record backlog. That seems to
have been the catalyst to move it about $4. Then on June 27, 2003 I found this
post:

"Provident Equity Research initiated coverage with Strong Buy. .... If the
company meets our revenue estimates, EPS could reach $0.92 and $1.15
respectively. Given the above scenario, we believe the company can trade at 17X
the $1.15/share estimate. ....Management believes that demand for its optical
inspection systems from overseas processors will serve as a catalyst for
growth. Foreign-based processors need to produce export quality goods to
compete in the marketplace. The acquisitions made in FY 2000 resulted in a
pro-forma revenue rate of $90 million on a full-year basis. However, the
economic downturn hid these benefits. Now, KTEC appears poised to grow
significantly from the acquisitions. Industry growth appears to be rebounding
after tough years in 2000 and 2001. At least one other competitor has seen
strong growth year-to-date."

Thanks again for your note.

Confirming here: Bought a little MHCO today.

Close enough for me in this market at these times to a Ben Graham net-net that
I'm willing to step up for some shares.

Imo though, not a suitable stock for most value players:

Dinky company.
Roach motel stock. (VERY thinly traded on pink sheets)
Expectation has to be for a 2-3 year hold. (imo)

I bought BEL after reading your initial post.. Nobody likes dilution, but I was
very impressed with the last conference call. Tough to find a company with four
years of backlog, and basically no competition at the volumes they do. Thanks

Chris Pedicini: my opinions regarding stocks you mentioned, fwiw:

Medq: What was your reason for buying the stock now? I don't see anything
compelling. Perhaps I'm overlooking something in my casual look-over?

NTZ: I've trimmed my position a while ago, just a bit. My intent is to hold
remaining shares to see if NTZ can trade again (as it has several times in
past) at 1.5x book value. Then I'll re-evaluate.

I'm still holding most of my ELN shares. Still underwater on the position. As
you say, they have some potential opportunities on which they maybe might be
able to capitalize.

I bought GTSI after I last mentioned it here. Still holding. Not sure what I
will do now. I liked the Forbes write-up on the CEO; his apparent
strength/skills are an intangible that I need to try to weigh.

CSG. Have gradually reduced position. Now holding about 2/3 of my position.
-----------------
ABM. Nice call. Good company at a good price; sorry I didn't go for it when you
mentioned it here.
