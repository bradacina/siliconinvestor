Steve, based on this idea that Spek talks about (the majority of the returns
come from a few stocks), you might want to also consider screening your set of
net-nets through the Piotroski screen.

The basic idea is to separate the low priced stocks that are about to collapse
from those that are turning around.

Muwis123, you asked about my favorite investing ideas.

Hard question for me.

Stocks that I'm enamoured with when I buy them - favorite stocks at the time I
buy them - often seem to be just the ones that don't work out so great. (GTI
and ABS being only two examples.) And the stocks that I'm iffy about when I buy
them, well those sometimes just are the ones that eventually have the biggest
upside moves. After they've moved up, I'm happy of course, and they become my
favorites in that sense. Possibly not much interest for a value hunter then
though, because the stock(s) would've already made a move.
I guess I could also say my favorite stocks are the ones I'm buying now - my
attention's focused on them, and I'm somewhat more clear about why I'm buying
them vs. my lesser interest in some boring stocks that've been in my portfolio
for months or years.

I would say my favorite stock ideas now are oil related. I mentioned a few such
stocks here again recently. I continue to make small adds now to my oil
positions almost every day.

Not necessarily favorite ideas, but I'm willing to make some small speculative
bets on some non-value stocks that might do okay over the next few years. I've
added to CZR (diverse gambling interests), DTV (I like the service), ATK
(bullets and other military projectiles), and I recently started a position in
SYK. (Perhaps I am also trying to reduce some seller's remorse - I sold BMY
spinoff ZMH too soon (and have held BMY too long). Still, I bet the high p/e
orthopedic stocks will hold on to those high p/e's somewhat even as earnings
continue to increase (I hope.))

Muwis123, what might be some stocks that you are buying now or that you might
characterize as your favorites?

COMS: The company just cannot get it together. Been waiting for the stock to
drop to cash value ($3.35, no ltd, per Yahoo). Lost patience, and have decided
$3.54 is close enough to add.

A losing position for me, my buys being @$6+ in '01 and $5+ in '03&'04. Didn't
take the opportunity to sell when stock was in positive territory last year.
I'll try to wait another year to see if stock might retrace again. If stock
does drop further though to below cash value on no additional adverse news
(they warned last month about the upcoming quarter), I'll increase my bet.

Stock tracking:

Unfortunately my system is not very efficient, but I don't see a good way to
improve it. :(

I track my portfolio financials in Quicken together with other finances.

I have my brokerage data on the web, but don't use it much except to buy/sell.
Interface is not that good for DD.

I use Yahoo portfolios to track all ideas with upper and lower limits for
buy/sell. 150 stocks there, so it's clear I don't spend enough time to watch
each of them unless something big happens and they drop to the buy point. Don't
have time to update buy points often either, so may miss the opportunities
there. Use Yahoo news, Quicken.com data and SEC filings for research.

I have a Buffettology spreadsheet for each one of these 150 stocks (and couple
more) updated about couple times a year depending on the stock. That's what
adjusts buy/sell points. I try to put short notes into these spreadsheets about
my decisions to buy/sell, etc.

I don't track performance more often than once a year and only for IRA, since
it's rather simple with only one deposit per year. Too tough to do accurately
for open account with frequent cash inflows/outflows (I use my brokerage as
checking/bill pay too). Quicken does not do it, don't kid yourself. If you have
frequent cash inflows/outflows almost no software tracks performance correctly.

From:Stewart Whitman
With regard to your question on how people maintain their portfolio information
and with the caveat that I've done a lot of software programming:

I maintain all my stock information in a database. I maintain 4 different
categories of situations: Spin-off, Bankruptcy, Arbitrage, and Other. And I
further classify the situations within each category (e.g. for the Other
category there is Value, Growth, GARP, Turnaround, Restructuring, etc.). All
information is presented via a web interface on my local web server. My
spin-off information goes back to 1998. My bankruptcy information goes back to
around 2002.

For each situation, I store general descriptive data for each company typically
taken from various sources on the web. For each situation, I can attach links
to news items (for example, links to messages on Silicon Investor). And I
provide ready access to links to services like Edgar, Yahoo, Quicken, etc..

I also suck down information from various web sources to present derived
information - for example, for an arbitrage situation, I show things like
calculated merger value, spread, annualized returns, annualized returns based
on standard position size and including commissions, even money probability,
risk-adjusted return, spread history for last 60 days, relative liquidity. Some
information is updated nightly and some things are based on delayed quote
information.

For each stock in each situation, I can mark the stock as held, bid, or
actively watched, and I can present an overall picture of all holdings in my
portfolio as well as looking into the individual categories.

I also have a big area to enter notes. No more worrying about that skimpy
single line of text that some internet sites provide.

I also maintain my own buy/sell targets, and periodically during the day,
e-mail myself a report of which stocks exceed their trigger points. Some nice
thing about this vs. Yahoo alerts: 1) I can tell when a quote fails - like when
a ticker has been changed or deleted which yahoo does not, 2) it's not just a
once a day notice like yahoo at least sometimes seems, 3) it is much more
immediate than being sent e-mail thru a ton of external servers, 4) I can check
the list of my held stocks to see whether I've set buy/sell targets for each
one, 5) generally, since I'm lazy about selling or buying stock and I often let
stocks sit above/below my triggers, I don't have to worry about sifting thru 20
or 30 recurring e-mails a day from yahoo.

I subjectively rank stocks from 1 to 5 based on how good a situation appears to
be. For arbitrage, the ranking is based on how likely a situation is to close.
For uncompleted spin-offs and bankruptcies, it's based on how interesting the
opportunity looks. If a stock is trading, the ranking is based on information
including conference calls and financials. Ranking stocks helps to remind me
which stocks I wish to retain and which I probably want to liquidate if better
opportunities present themselves.

Right now, I don't track portfolio transactions so there's no portfolio
allocation tracking, position sizes, cost basis, or individual position return.
I do remember the $ value of my account at the beginning of the year and how
much money was added or removed, so I can tell my return in a rough manner. I
download and run a program on the history of my account for tax purposes, from
which I could probably accurately calculate return.

One of these days I plan to add a general calendar that can track things like
expected merger closings, conference calls, spin-off dates, dividends, etc.

A lot of this is probably overkill (unless you do arbitrage). But if you want
to graduate beyond spreadsheets, one direction might be to create your own
personal database. I use Unix with a MySQL database and Perl scripts to do
mine, but there's always Microsoft Access that includes a lot of tools to build
interfaces with little work.

Stew

Paul - That's the way it works for me, too. Some stocks where I have high

work. I take a portfolio approach to investing and have at least about 20
stocks. Most of them are cheap on FCF and/or BV.

I'm still overweight in energy but not as much as I had last year. My two
energy names are WMB, HP, and NOI. Despite the run-up in WMB, it is still my
favorite in that space.

Otherwise, my holdings are fairly diverse. I have a mix of industrial related
names like
1) COLL (makes school buses, light trucks and ambulances),
2) GNRL (makes bearings),
3) HDNG (makes metal-cutting turning machines) and
4) CVR (makes rivets)

Technology names like
1) MRM (makes RF and microwave components),

3) ENPT (IT co.) and
4) RELM (makes wireless equipt)

As far as what I own. A couple mentioned recently on this board (had some small
run ups) are GTSI and PLPC. OCA mentioned previously, as well.

WEFC --- this one is basically a guaranteed $2 + divvy if u buy now for 99
shares or less (odd lot), because there will be an upcoming reverse split that
will take you out odd lots at 31.50. This also has some acquisition interest @
35.00 (competing tender) that could possibly drive the price higher.

I'll throw a few more random names out there AIH, SCVL, MAXF (a former Dale
Baker success story that has come onto some rough times, trading near book
value, seems like reasonable risk/reward at these levels). I am not saying
these are awesome buys (do your own homework), but I am comfortable owning them
as part of a larger portfolio.

The stocks that Paul Senior recommends are usually good examples of traditional
value stocks imo. Most of the stocks on the board fit the description,
actually. However, from time to time people through out stocks that I don't
think fit the description --- a few seem like speculative growth stories.

Hope this helps.

hi Brinks,

Considering TPE with some discretionary dough.

And I've always puzzled over this: why would the owner of potentially valuable
land sell that land? Is it just a question of resources? i.e. the owners are so
strapped for cash that they can't afford the necessary tests to determine what
sits below? And/or further, they don't have the resources to develop the

Is that it?

Paul, I don't have a dog in this fight, but the Yahoo #'s seem to indicate that
VSH's book value is dominated by goodwill and intangibles. I don't know what

terribly valuable in that business.

VSH: Right. I believe part of VSH strategy is to grow by acquisitions. Their
major American competitor (Kemet)at least once rebuffed an offer by them.

Branding is probably irrelevant to the business. Competing on cost (against
strongly capitalized Asian competitors) is likely #1, followed by
time-to-delivery. (Sometimes customers experience spot shortages when times are
good, so managing customer relationships is important.) Product innovation by
VSH sometimes helps in creating added value in an otherwise (imo) commodity
business.
---------------

No patience now to read the entire Grantham article. Not too thrilled with this
guy from what I can read of him lately. He's very bearish - very public about
it - and consequently in his advice. He says he is net short in his own
account. But for the funds he manages he says (it is reported) that he loses
too many customers by being so extreme in his bearish views when he acts on
this in his funds. So he goes ahead and buys stocks for the fund to keep
customers. A criticism I read of this is that here we have a long-time,
high-level, successful big fund(s) manager - so likely he is now worth zillions
of dollars - and yet at this point in his life he STILL is not willing to
walk-the-walk; he is just not willing to do what he believes is right. In
article you referenced, he seems to justify all this. However, his divergence
between beliefs and actions is a valid criticism of the man, and perhaps a
microcosm of how some fund managers go against their beliefs in their quest for
personal profits. Perhaps also, another confirming sign of why individuals have
to be wary of fund managers.

Paul, The problem with the Passive Electrical companies is in one word--
SUPPLY. Growth in overall demand has returned but it is easy to supply this
growth. Same with the chip companies. And now the Chinese are coming. Margins
keep coming down with about 5% reduction in pricing each year. Since PSR= Net
margins x PE, the PSRs are coming down for all the suppliers IMO both from
lower margins and lower PEs.

The EMS industry is a good example of these problems also IMO.
Old PSRs used of 1- 1.2 are no longer applicable. PSRs of .4 to .6 are being
used. Growth in EMS has slowed considerably causing a lower PE in the 20 range
and Net margins are generally less then 2%.

But with VSH, I think you have chosen the best of the lot as to component
suppliers. They have a lot of diversity of products. They are number one in
resistors and inductors. The power management chip business is supposed to be
the best area for the active chip business. Their debt is all converts.
They tried to do a billion dollar deal last year and failed. But are still
looking. Their chip margins help the low 10% gross margin passives. I
personally would stay away from KEM. They are running their plants as cheaply
as possible. But no matter what the demand, their profits will be limited by
the unlimited supply in capacitors and low margins. And the Asian competitors
will keep the margins low and supply high.

In fact when I look back to the good old days, before the bust in 2001, I think
the mistake was to forget about supply and just focus on demand and expect
growth to continue in EMS since penetration in the electronic market was only
about 20%. I was wrong. Here we are several years later, growth is much less ,
margins are low and capacity utilization is still below 70% and in the PCB
area, SANM just said they are at about 55-60%.

CLE is a retailer with zero debt. And the ratios are a bit more forgiving than

Economist Magazine has an article in Jan 8 edition concerning Steel Prices and

Nippon Steel agreed on new prices with BHP $55 per ton old price, $125 per ton
new price. "This week, POSCO, from South Korea, made similar deals with BHP,
and Rio Tinto, number two in the trade."

China just signed 25 year deal with BHP. JFE Steel (japan) agreed to 20% stake
in a venture led by BHP... etc etc etc

The steel makers haven't been worried about price, "The Steelmakers' real worry
recently, however, has been getting the stuff."

"The price of these raw materials (coke for the steel makers) rose fast in
2004. They are likely to continue that way in 2005."

K-Swiss Reports Record Fourth Quarter and Year-End Results
Thursday February 3, 7:00 am ET

snip

K-Swiss also issued guidance for the first quarter of 2005 and for 2005. The
Company expects revenues for the first quarter of 2005 to be approximately $138
to $143 million and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.52 to
$0.57. The Company expects full year revenues to be approximately $480 to $500
million and expects to report full year earnings per diluted share of
approximately $1.70 to $1.80.

The Company's estimates for the first quarter of 2005 and full year 2005
reflect the continued investments in marketing, sales and product development
for the Royal Elastics brand as well as the expansion of European operations.
They are based upon the following assumptions: gross margins will be between
44% and 45%; SG&A will not rise above $32 million for the quarter and $127
million for the year; cancellations will be moderate; and the Company's growth
initiatives with respect to Royal Elastics will not exceed a net loss of $0.07
to $0.08 per share for the year.

Steven Nichols, Chairman of the Board and President, stated, "In a year filled
with many notable accomplishments, the fourth quarter lived up to our
expectations. We noted with pleasure the recent improvement in sales to our
largest customer, yet another quarter of company-leading sales from our Classic
shoe and the increasingly significant contribution from our international
business. We also successfully executed a fourth quarter television campaign -
our largest in that time period - that resulted in a sizable increase in
at-once business and improvement in margin.

Nice analysis on the ABS preferred, E_K_S. I'm not much of a preferred investor
though, and I know nothing about hybrids.

I have a very small ABS (common stock) position which I'll possibly add to if
stock drops below $20 on no adverse news. I'm not willing to buy the common at
current price, and given my inexperience with preferreds, I'll avoid the ABS
preferred also.

Hi Paul - Thanks for your opinion. I have been slowly converting my common
share purchase of ABS over to the preferred assets. My cost basis for my common
shares is around $20 and I have sold half of my position in the common at
$24.50 and bought the preferred at around the same price. This way I receive
the higher "qualified" dividend while I wait for the company turn around. It's
a matter of making a fair investment into a better investment (7.5% yield plus
possible capital gain return.).

The point of my post was that if the waiting period for the turn around will
now be 24 months (and it's turns out to be a positive event), then the
preferred shares are the best "hold" and "wait" strategy. My strategy was to
exchange my common position to the preferred position. I still have 1/2 of my
common position which I will continue to sell Jan'06 $25 calls.

=========================================================
Did you notice that the ALD dividend in a "non-qualified" dividend? The SFL
dividend (about the same rate as ALD) is "qualified" and taxed at the lower
rate.

I am also following your JPM pick as I need to add to my bank stocks. Your Citi
Corp. call (a few month's back) @ $44.50 (C) was excellent and I wish I had
picked up more shares (it's a "qualified" dividend too!). I continue to load up
on NYB and have up my position twice at prices in the $17 range. NYB now ranks
number 2 in my taxable portfolio and I believe the long term holder will
achieve a good return and will collect a safe %5.25 dividend while they wait.

Finally, my new MRO position has done quite well moving above $40 near new
highs. I covered my naked April $32.5 Put today and continue to let my April
$40 covered call ride. These oil stocks continue to do quite well.

Congratulations on your picks in the home builder stocks. New highs again! I
missed this sector but this is the nature of the market.

Your observations are always helpful.

KKD: Thanks, hoyasaxa and E_K_S for replies.

Seems to me I've invested in doughnut company stocks at least a couple of times
and have lost money. Can't remember the stock, maybe not Dunkin' Donuts -
that's now part of Allied Domecq (The ADR is AED.)

Point is that doughnut stocks can be dangerous, and KKD might be very much so.
It's somewhat about saturation -

- the health issues with saturated fats

-the diet issues with people getting saturated on empty calories

-the saturated distribution channels (with KKD losing its cachet as a special
niche product - i.e. the product being distributed by many 3rd parties now,
e.g. Albertson's grocery stores)

- the oversaturation of stores. Media is saying KKD may not have enough cash it
needs to close underperforming stores and cannot borrow any more money under
their latest loan agreements. A solution may be bankruptcy or stock dilution,
it is being reported.
--------
Goldman Sachs Asset Management filled today that they hold 5.3% of the common.
I take that as a vote of confidence in the new KKD management team. May turn
out to be a misguided vote though -g-.
OTOH, with their backs against the wall, maybe KKD can work through these
difficult times.

I've taken just a VERY few shares @$7.15 today.

then I added more in a regular account. I've got investment expenses that I can
offset the dividend income I receive there.

Watching the quick rise breaking $55.00 per share I keep diluding myself into
believing ANF has sustainable advantage and is therefore a (dicey) long term
hold.

I sold leaps ('07 $50s)on 1/3 of my position when the company broke $50.00 a
couple of weeks ago, thinking if the stock price plumeted sometime, even down
to $30.00 per share, I could buy 'em back and continue holding as the company
fundementals continued to grow, or if I was called out I would receive a total
$60+ per share. I understand there is a big assumption here, but Jeffries and
co. created nearly a ten year history of hugely profitable growth using little
or no debt.

I am not happy about the present valuation here, but if you can depend upon the
growth prospects of 10%-15% per year over the next 10 years or so and 5% growth
thereafter the today's price may be justied. Of course, these assumptions
require nearly perfect execution and at todays price there is little, if any,
margin of safety.

Bought some GMAI -

(72%) with Afinsa. While revenue with related parties is always a concern, so
far this seems to work out great for GMAI and Afinsa does pay their bills, as
is evident from GMAI's cash flow.

Thread from Ebay is overrated, coils and stamps are difficult to value and easy

historically it looks like CHIC has been a great buy when it reaches the 10
area, and then wait for their results to improve and the market to like them
again

it appears their inventory is under good control, so the underlying book value
is probably of fairly decent quality, diminishing the overall risk

the significantly negative same store sales are a definite concern
however...offsetting this would be the insider buying and the tone of their
recent earnings release, which is quite matter of fact and shows they are
working to correct their errors, rather than glossing them over

all in all CHIC appears to be a decent risk/reward, especially if it were to
dip back near 10, though i would feel more comfortable if i had any idea at all
about women's fashion, and where CHIC fits into the overall picture <g>

i owned it then, and still own it now, along with YELL, with the idea that the
strong economy will drive both higher

to me the drop was more due to the market than the company's report and
outlook, but time will tell...for now it will take a while to overcome the
negative reaction and overhead resistance, but long term it should again make
new highs as long as the company executes

Well BUD continues to hit new annual low, and I continue to buy small amounts.

Very possibly the p/e is undergoing a slow and long-term downward revision by
the market. The beer business just isn't growing revenues very much. And no
matter if BUD buys back stock, introduces new beers, maintains/improves its
great distribution network and dominant postion, there may be no long-term way
around slow market growth.

OTOH, they were talking about how beer was a slow-growth (product sales)

Ah, you are right, Madharry... and I am not.

I always look at p/bk, p/sales, but here - as with other gambling stocks, I
forgot now that I often look at other ways that I have to evaluate them.

I don't use profit, profit growth, or cash flow. I use profit margins - which I
often like to use when the standard Graham measures don't seem relevant. And
for gambling stocks - you are also correct when you allude that there are none
to be seen that look good on p/bk, p/sales.

There's no academic research that I know that would support me, but sometimes
relative profit margins provide a tip-off to me that a stock is in buy range.
And sometimes this works out. Basically, I have a multiple I'm willing to pay
for the profit margin I see. So I'm willing to pay a lot more for a company
with a profit margin of 21.8% (per Yahoo), than I am for a company like lottery
company SGMS (which I own) with a profit margin of 10.6%. And by "pay a lot
more" I can quantify that for any stock by combining profit margin metric with
a price to value metric - that is, I try to evaluate how much each 1% profit
margin is worth.

The big issue for me is can profit margins (I try to use average over the past
few years) be sustained? As an example, Scientific Games (SGMS) gets its share
of new contracts, and contracts run for several years. To me, these give more
confidence that the lower SGMS margins can be sustained than higher-margin
CRYP, a small company in the competitive internet gaming business, a company
about which I'm not so confident or knowledgeable.

In addition, at least a couple of the gambling stocks I am holding also have
special interest for me: CZR being bought out, WMS being controlled by Sumner
Redstone, IGT the dominant slot maker. So you would be correct that Graham
value criteria don't apply here.

Not saying it is a great stock, but it is in the same general vicinity

like BUD) its lows. Reported OK results yesterday. Even though I own the stock

Both BUD and KO are the biggest players in their respective industries, and two
of the most recognisable brands in the world. IMHO I think KO has more total
return potential than BUD.

Speaking of beaten down stocks, I ended up purchasing NYT last week at a

The idea of margins is very interesting. I dont recall seeing any literature on
it. but I still think you have to couple it with some kind of growth projection
to make it meaningful. Although you are right in that we dont know how certain
the continued growth prospects are for CRYP, It seems to me to be a small but
fairly dominant company in its field, in a sharply growing area. I believe that
the returns to the casino operators far exceed their costs of doing business
with CRYP, and safety and security is paramount, so it seems to me the longer
the main player with the good track has the harder it becomes to dislodge. So
unless some huge player steps into the fray I think that CRYP has the
wherewithal to maintain and increase its leading position. Others believe that
the casinos will switch to the lowest cost provider but if I were a casino
executive- and I switched to a different provider and then ended up with either
a fraud or a system shutdown I would have some difficult explaining to do.

I took a glance at this one. The size of the company, my lack of knowledge of

to keep me from going further, though that's my problem, not the company's.
However, I would caution you IRT thinking of this as a software stock. I think
a better comparison might be a company like Keane, EDS, CSC, etc.. To be a
software company, or at least a software company that deserves the high P/B
ratio you were discussing, the majority of revenues needs to come from
licensing or other forms of software sales. This company appears to have a
heavy services component, and the higher the ratio of services to revenues, the
less desirable the company, at least when viewed through that lens. I also
notice that from 2001 - 2003, operating costs have risen sharply as a
percentage of revenues. That is exactly the opposite of what you would expect
from a growing software company.

This is all from a five minute look at their Annual Report, so take it FWIW.

If you consider setting fire to the cash hoard building value, it's possible.
That's what AVCI's 5-year track record suggests.

;<)

2000 minus 19.80 per share
2001 minus 7.75
2002 minus 5.20
2003 minus 3.02
2004 minus 2.81
2005 est. minus 2.29

AVCI: I'm hoping mgmt. will improve as their backs are pushed against the wall.
They've had a lot of glamour ($800 stock in '00 and even $100 in '01). Now
though, there's not much cash left or room left for mistakes and frittering.

As I say, I'm taking on "a most little AVCI" now. A $5 1/2 dollar stock, maybe
it'll drop to $2 or $3 before I maybe give up. OTOH, somebody saw potential in
the company last year (stock was over $10 for a while and even over $20), so
maybe there's still potential to be discovered by the market.

Re: MSFT.

Just another perspective here: I'm slowly selling MSFT now, not buying. I would
be ecstatic to be wrong since I will continue to hold a large position, mostly
for tax reasons. But my own feeling is that while MSFT is not a poor
investment, it's no longer a really good one either. I believe the current
stock price isn't a bargain - a long, slow selloff over the next couple years
seems as likely to me as a slow rally - and in any case I've found more
promising new investments. In general the company seems to have grown too
complacent and reactionary, and has always been far too inward-looking. There
still _many_ talented people there to be sure, and there are bright spots such
as Xbox, MS Research and a few other groups.

Like I said, I'd love to be proven wrong. I may suffer from too close a
perspective since I worked there for almost a decade, starting in the late
1980s.

Cheers,
Kevyn

re: MSFT

Disclaimer: I'm a developer sort who is forced, by the size of our customer
base, to program exclusively in the MS world and I've spent many weeks
"dealing" with MSFT from a developer's perspective. So maybe I'm a little
frustrated <G>.

My problem with MSFT at this point is that I can't answer "how can they
continue to produce revenues?". I mean, what other bell, light or whistle can
they add to MS Office to compel people to pony up more cash for the next
version? I don't know about you, but I use, maybe, 10% of the features in Word
and that takes care of my needs. I sure can't justify paying for the next
version that has features that I'll never use.

They've tried alternate revenue models. They were trying to rent Office to all
of us and force us to pay an annual renewal fee. That didn't work out. It's not
at all clear to me that they can do anything to force me to pay for office
again. Some of our customers are still working on windows 98 for crying out
loud. So they, at least, see no real reason to upgrade.

A while ago, I investigated Linux and Open Office. I can set up all the
software on my computer that I need for $100. And that's only if I buy the
"supported" version of Linux and do the right thing and contribute to the open
office folks and the Mozilla folks.

And Longhorn (the next op system they're developing) is already 2 years late.
And getting later.

I guess the point of this tirade is that I have no faith that MSFT can continue
to produce growth the way they have over the last (Dear God) 2 decades or so.

Of course, I've said that about MSFT for some years, so you may want to be real
cautious about agreeing <G>.

A recent development in Brazil is interesting. The government there has decreed
that no government computers can run non open-source software. And while they
claim that "this policy is not directed at any particular company", I interpret
that with a wink and a nod. So I guess that if I were considering MSFT, I'd
keep a sharp eye on how that works out since I suspect that the success or
failure of the experiment in Brazil may have things to say about the future of
MSFT continuing to dominate the PC market outside the US and Europe.

Anyway, all of this IMHO, so take it for what it's worth.

Best
Erick
