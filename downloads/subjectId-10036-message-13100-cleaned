The Madden arrest has been old news for over a year and has never affected the
operations of the company though that might change when he's in prison as he is
still one of their designers.

I'm more concerned with the insider selling but as I say that was at twice
today's price and it's still 32% insider owned.

Bought FRO (tanker) today and may buy SKYW (regional airline) Monday. Also

More buys.
Bought Reebok at 19.20 (RBK). Previously, I had bought this at $8, $12 and $20s
and sold this year at $30. Trailing PE is around 13x, 2001 PE is 11.5, 2002
10ish. It seems their competitive position has been restored from 1999. Over
the last five years they have brought their debt down from $850m to $350m.

Bought Black & Decker at $30 (BDK). The company is priced approaching a 5 year
low. In the past five years the company has bought back 15 percent of its
shares, and brought down its debt from $1.6B to $1.1B.

Marty Whitman interviewed by Gretchen Morganstern
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/23/business/yourmoney/23WATC.html Excerpt: <<His
macro view is simple and dark. "I don't think we ought to be worried about the
recession," he said.
A far greater concern is what he calls permanent impairment, an accounting term
that refers to an asset that has been so damaged that it will never return to
its previous value. He argues that some industries have been permanently
impaired by the events of Sept. 11.>>

Differentiating between indiscriminate overselling and permanent impairment
will be central to my evaluations in the coming period. The following working
assumptions play into this:
• There will be more terrorist attacks on the US & US related interests. Only
question is when and what impacts.
• There may be significant infrastructure impacts from this [Attack on power or
telecom facilities]
• Risk premiums will come to reflect this.
• Behavior of customers and businesses will *change* in ways we can only guess
at [uncertainty - risk premium impacts]
• The Cost of fighting this war thru greater security [profit impacts -
numerator] and government spending [Rate impacts - denominator] will affect
valuation of all equities.
That said, I went to an Olive Garden on Fri...there was a line outside the
door: Full restaurants are an indication of optimism. Looking for more
anecdotal indications...

very good post. I agree.

But, olive garden on a friday night is not a good indicator by itself. Many of
these type have waiting lists every weekend.

I saw a thing on CNBC where they said Rest.s were down 5-20% the week of the
attacks. I spoke with one company, MAIN, and they said they were down, but not
that much and since there is only a few days left in this quarter, they will
report their 18th consecutive quarter of same store sales increases.
Since MAIN has pulled back from nearly $6 to $3.25, I have reloaded some of the
shares I sold on strength.

Using a 5 x EBITDA multiple gives the shares a value of about $5, using 6 X it
would be about $6.67 .

And their future is a fairly new concept called Bamboo Club.
With 2 new stores opening soon. Fantastic economics for this concept.

My biggest fear for the market is payback. Payback, not for the tech bubble,
but for the many,many year bull market prior to that with only 87 in the way.

I fear valuations could stay down and we could do nothing for several years.
Look at 1929, it bottomed 3 years later in 1932 and for folks that paid the
high in 1929, it took 20 years to break even.

We have fear in the market, just not THAT kind of fear !

Hi Everyone:

In light of the recent market declines I'm returning to this thread to take
advantage of all the great ideas.

rjm, I looked at MAIN, and have a concern.

I see that depreciation is about half of EBITDA. My concern is that in the
restaurant business you really do have to replenish your depreciating assets -
which consist of restaurant equipment and decor. The buildings themselves are
leased in MAIN's case, I believe.

Therefore I would personally not use EBITDA as the measure of the profit of the
business, but rather EBIT.

2000 EBIT was $7.5 million, 1999 only $3.8 million. Six month comparison is
$4.3 in 2001 vs. $3.2 in 2000.

My eyes see MAIN as a company with a market value at $3.50 per share of $100
million including $50 million of debt, and an EBIT of perhaps $8, for a
multiple of 12x or so.

Part of reason for my comment is to elicit other anecdotal observations from
thread participants on how things are looking from this point forward. Not just
restaurants, but shopping and entertainment venues generally. Have things
changed? The week of the event would clearly be anomalous. Some activities like
air travel are gonna be hurting. But the hypothesis that the consumer goes into
hybernation needs some real testing before I buy it. Sometimes direct

Most of the buyouts & stuff use EBITDA rather than EBIT.

And you would be hard pressed to find another stock with the insider buying
that MAIN has had for many years. Combine that with a really hot new concept
and its a stock I am comfortable owning.
Will they make it 19 quarters of SSS growth ? Maybe not. But I have confidence

Alan SALD Quicktake: Cheap and flat. EV/EBITDA a bit over 2 is really cheap.
Revenues haven't shown any growth over the last five years. You'd think a
company that cheap would get an offer just for accretion. Maybe the 69%
concentration with insiders deters buyers...or perhaps there's another reason.
I've always been fond of the concept of healthy dining...thought that a
restaurant chain built on it would do great. But the current wisdom in the
restaurant biz appears to be that people talk about healthy eating, but when
they make choices and spend money, it's a different story. I suspect the
terrorist threat may exacerbate this...If I think I'm about to be immolated, am
I going for the 'fresh choice' healthy meal...nope, make that a steak, rare and
extra butter on that tater, please.
I'll put this on my watch list. It's kind of like STRZ cheap, close held, and

Peter: Good to see you back. Good point on DA. I use EV/EBITDA because it's
better than PE [figures debt], is commonly used as a buyout measure, and the
EBITDA is right on the yahoo profile, so it's quick & convenient. That said,
EBITDA has many shortcomings and you've correctly focused on an important one
in this biz, IMO. Restaurants that aren't remodeled on a fairly regular basis
tend to get stale. If the restaurant leases facilities then the depreciation
probably nails or even understates this regular expense. OTOH, if the
restaurant owns the building, in a decent location, then depreciation is
somewhat offset by property appreciation [sort of analagous to FFO with REITS].

MW, besides the value price, is that tough times increase demand for

Hello everyone!

Does anyone have any input as to how this will affect the net value of GVHR?
http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/010921/flf003_1.html

My initial reaction was to deduct the 22.2M directly from CASH as the sole
transaction involved. But in thinking about it further, it seems to me that
this amount would have to show up on the asset side somewhere (prepaid items,
or reserves, etc)until the claims against those assets materialized and were
paid out.

Therefore, this item would have no immediate impact on NetNet valuation.

Since this added reserve requirement seems to be mandated by rapidly falling
interest rates, it seems to me that it could just as rapidly be pulled out of
reserves if rates suddenly reversed direction and started going back up to the
5.5% rate initially used by the company for present value calculations.

Any input on clarifying my thinking would be appreciated.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=nbr+tdw&d=c&k=c1&t=5y&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

I like NBR because they're dominant in land drilling. And twice as big (market
cap) as TDW. TDW is off-shore drilling. Stock prices look correlated:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=tdw&k=c1&t=5y&s=nbr&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

Price/sales better (lower) for NBR. NBR has grown sales, but has increased debt
and shares outstanding in doing it. TDW revenues fluctuate, and to me, don't
look like they've really grown much. Company has been profitable though. BIG
PLUS for me is that TDW has no long term debt. TDW looks safer to me (and I am
guessing) but has less upside potential than NBR (I am guessing).

Maybe both stocks ought to be bought as a package. Get on-shore and off-shore
combined. Maybe neither stock should be bought since the oil bidness seems to
be out of favor and the stock trend for both companies is down.

I'll likely start a small position in TDW tomorrow though. I'll go with less
potential (I am guessing) % recovery to highs, but for more safety (of no ltd)
and the assumption that if business is cyclical, somewhere around here will be
the cyclical low. Or if not, that I can hold on until the business and stock
recover (assuming they do).

AACE I'm not sure what to make of this and have no position. Selling a bit over
8 with announced expectations of earnings 1.30 to 1.36 in 02. PE of 6.2 on
'market leader' in a biz that might actually improve in tough times.
BUT several states are going after this check cashing outfit for short term
loans that the states claim violate usury laws [loan shark]. AACE claims loans
were made by National bank [Subject to national, not state, regulation thus
dodging the local usury bullet] and co acted as agent not principal. Price is
low because they took a charge in April to close unprofitable locations and
some loan losses.
I like the PE if the projection is to be beleived [But beleiving a loan shark
is a stretch...especially one that just blew up in the face of expectations],
but the lawsuits and regulatory issues are substantial turnoff.

SAN DIEGO, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Fast food chain Jack in the Box Inc. (NYSE:JBX -
news) on Monday lowered its earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and for
fiscal 2002, citing economic uncertainty and a decline in sales following the
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

The company said it now expects fourth quarter earnings of 49 cents a share,
down from previous guidance of 53 cents to 57 cents. Sales at stores open at
least a year are expected to grow 3.3 percent in the quarter, it said.

For all of 2001, the company said it expects earnings of $2.10 per share, down
from previous guidance of $2.16.

The company said it expects a 5 percent earnings growth rate in 2002, and
earnings of $2.18 a share.

Analysts on average have forecast 2002 earnings of $2.46 a share, according to

The Limited.

Bought The Limited (LTD).

The LTD story is somewhat involved and I will describe it in shorthand. PM me
any questions about the shorthand. In order to follow the story you need to
know what LTD owns. In other words, this post needs to be read in conjunction
with an understanding of LTD. Also, my assumptions are intended to be
conservative. If errors are found, please advise.

FYI, LTD yields 3% on a 30 cent dividend. LTD’s debt is rated baa2 by Moodys.

My investment rationale (contrary to the Motley Fool post here:
http://www.fool.com/Specials/2001/sp010925sixa.htm?source=eheyhopop001101&ref=y
oolnk) is that when buying LTD one is buying Intimate Brands (IBI) at a 33%
discount, not buying Express/The Limited/Lerner/Structure. IBI is Victoria’s
Secret and Bath & Bodyworks and is valued by the market as LTD’s mainstay. The
33% discount puts approximately a 9 PE on LTD’s IBI stake. IBI has not had a
good year and the events of 9/11 are not going to make it better. IBI has a PE
of approximately 13 on 1/2002 earnings but the earnings must be suspect.

My accounting for the 33% discount is as follows:
LTD market cap 4072
less: surplus cash -300
less: value of non-IBI revs -1000
less: publicly traded stock -323

Cost of LTD's IBI stake 2448
Market price of LTD'S IBI stake 3638
% discount 33%

The market cap’s I calculated as follows:
Shares/ price/value
ltd 428.6 9.50 4072
ltd's ibi shares 404.235 9.00 3638

ads 14.7 16.25 239
chrs 8.7 4.91 43
glyn 3.9 10.67 42
total publicly traded stock 323

The surplus cash was calculated as follows:
Current Assets 1900
Current Liabilities -1000
Long Term Debt -250
Long Term Liabilities -223

Good move by KSL today to new high. With the recent dividend increase however
the yield is no lower than when it was at 14. I remember you had a target of
20. Even at 25 the yield would be 5.8%, great value in a low interest rate
environment.

JBX.

Well, they cited economic uncertainty AND sept 11. The key is that they said...
"For all of 2001, the company said it expects earnings of $2.10 per share, down
from previous guidance of $2.16.
The company said it expects a 5 percent earnings growth rate in 2002, and
earnings of $2.18 a share."
So the're probably worth $20-$30 per share. I sold a few shares Aug 28, but
kept a good amount also.

My strategy, for anyone who cares --
I have ambled to safety since Sept 11. Selling every day until this week. I
bought more Reits and Cash, and sold technology. I had a nice start because
since August 1, I have been moving to dividend paying stocks. I think I
mentioned it here. I think they were hammered less than others, but maybe not.

My best recent buy has been HPT at the bottom. They are a REIT in hotel
industry. They lease out the properties to Marriot and such. They have a clause
in the contract where they get added rent based on hotel revenue, but it was a
very small added bonus in past years. If it goes to zero, not a problem, in my
view. The hotels have 10+ year contracts or so. They have 1 year security
deposits. The stock is paying 12%. I recommend them, but what do I know?

Another fresh purchase is REG. Commercial REIT, focused on neighborhood
shopping centers anchored with grocery stores. Sounds solid to me. Remember --
food is cool. The 4 largest tennants (Kroger, Safeway, Publix, Albertsons) have
around 30% of the lease area and average least term is 15 years. 8% yield now.
(8.4% when I bought them.) Also bought more apartment REITS -- I like MAA, PPS,
AML, AIV, SMT, GBP. Bought more ALD -- check their website and browse through
their investments -- wow!. Another grocery REIT is NXL, which I own -- 9.6%
yield, but I do not like their management or EPS as much.

I also bought SWY as others posted. I had 'em before and posted here. I
quadrupled my stake on their announcement of earnings. I still like CAG and
SVU, but have enough. Food is cool.

Also bought more BOBE, and a fresh position in IHP. I like IHP's business model
and history. The build the franchises and then sell them to franchisees when up
and running.

My bad sales have been - S (I sold 2/3, and I did not want to, nice dividend,
damn, why did I do it?), APPC and ROST. My best bail out was DTG at 16.77. And
CGO.

Looking at KWR, but even after reading their annual report, I cannot figure out
what they do. Any thoughts?

REITS, Cash and Fixed income moved from 36% of my investment portfolio, to 56%
now. I sleep better.

I've looked at LTD too. As an off-shoot of Mike Burry's IBI.

I will just give that LTD is undervalued compared to its publicly traded
holdings. The bottom line is that when one adds all the holdings one gets
such-and-such aspects of LTD for free. All well and good for a value investor.

On the other hand, prime retailers are down too. And they and LTD can still
fall further. Or maybe some might recover better and quicker than LTD.

I've kind of lost my logic on these retailers. Whereas in the past I'd say
there's a margin of safety with LTD, now though, with prices on so many
retailers so low (imo), I've just lost my focus and understanding.

I'd almost say that a bet on JWN (Nordstrom - hovering near lows) has an equal
- and maybe better - chance to recover to higher levels than does the
conglomerate LTD. Although some of these retailers are high-end carriage-trade
purveyors, JWN continues to have some terrific customer loyalty and is likely
to be a survivor and thriver (maybe). Perhaps SAKS too, (but their stores I've
visited look devoid of customers) might recover from its multiyear lows at some
point. I was once willing to bet on SKS, but not now.

In addition to JWN, I've got GOT on my watch list. GOT looks risky to me, yet
some savvy business people have been taking large positions at higher prices.

Brendan Watt: Held off from UNM today - trying to get in closer to lows.

I started a position in TLAB though. There is a surprising (to me) number of
value-style mutual funds who have (or had!) positions in this stock. In the
unpopular and out-of-favor telecom business, TLAB still seems to be making and
selling products that customers use. Billion in cash, negligible ltd, still
profitable, selling at lows - so also at relatively low p/sales, p/earnings and
p/book. Outlook per analyst isn't that great for next year or so.

It's one of those stocks I'd rather be in for a little bit now than out of
entirely.

I'll guess the stock will fall further similar to Corning.
TLAB price now about 9.77, and I'll guess it might soon sell about book or
maybe 1.2x book -- say between 6.27 and 7.50. Maybe at twice cash at low.
(That'd be about $5/sh.)
I'll add more as stock drops. (I say that now, but with the state of the

I don't know of a situation which is as clear for me as the likelihood of the
move to between 20 and 24 for KSL. The business is pipeline services, they are
and have been running at capacity for years, it's predictable with strong
positive cash flow.

It has been a bright spot in my investing lately.

An update on my thinking about MFW is.... shortly after I bought it, I had a
nice enough run that I sold three quarters of my position and own the rest at
an extremely low per share price. I believe in the fundamentals, but am not
foolish enough to pit myself against the collective wisdom of this board
regarding Perlman's involvement and potential for overwhelmingly negative
impact. I want to watch this unfold, so I kept a small ownership interest.

I am now looking at employment services firms as a contrarian (who me?) play.
Nobody likes them, but there is some nice value to be had. I'm looking at HAKI

fall)

stocks since before 9/11.

In a writeup of his fund in "Money: Special Report" (Fall,2001, p. 56), the
reporter states, "...with a strong global brand, virtually no debt, and $1.60
in cash flow per share, Interpublic looks good to Torray..."

Hi everyone, it is good to return to this board after 1 year absence. I think
the market is bottoming and come back to check some value stocks. I found you
guys are discussing a lot of manufacturing, clothing, and other traditional

While in the past year's high-tech crash, many high-tech stocks with good
income/revenue and bright future have been down dramatically to close in to
book/cash value. CIEN is trading at book value 12, with $5 cash, and is an
optical networking leader. AWRE is trading a little above book $4. It has key
patents in DSL technology and license its technology to Internet Service
providers, actually it is one of the two ways to get high speed internet
access. There are 20% short position on it now and I think it will move the
stock up faster once the uptrend is established.

re: CIEN.

Ciena is an interesting company with well-regarded products. However, the $5 a
share in cash dwindles to under $2 if one subtracts the $867m in notes and
includes diluted shares in the divisor (299m). The PSR is around 2.3 and the PE
is around 25 on this year's and next year's earnings for a capital equipment
manufacturer selling products with high risk of obsolescence into an industry
saturated with overcapacity. One might make money but there's plenty of

Also, a licensing deal was announced with SBUX tonight
which can't hurt...

Recent transactions.

Started a position in Paul's Quiksilver (ZQK) at $12.87. This is a retailer of
clothing, wetsuits, sunglasses, etc. related to the skateboarding, snowboarding
and surfing sports. Revenues and earnings have compounded in the mid 20s over
the last five years. Debt is modest. The PE is in the 10-13 area depending on
what eps numbers you want to put faith in.

Started a position at $25.06 in GATX (GMT). It is "...a holding company whose
subsidiaries engage in the leasing and management of railroad tank cars and
other specialized railcars; arrange and service the financing of equipment and
other capital assets; and provide logistics and supply chain services." It is
selling around its 1998 lows. Berkshire Hathaway owns 15% and I think it's
Buffett's pick. Earnings are supposed to be in the $2 to $3 range this year and
next. Moody's rates their senior debt baa2.

Sold BEA Systems (BEAS) for a tiny profit. This bounced 55% from its lows on no
news. I think there's still too much froth in the techs (I say in disbelief)
and I'm looking for a lower entry point.

Added to American Management at $11.25.

SALD: They put on quite a 'spread'...not the one at the salad bar, the one
between bid and ask...15% as I post this.

15% is the "light" spread for SALD. I've seen worse...

Although, there really aren't that many shares out there,
so I guess it is to be expected a bit.

I thought today's results weren't too bad considering
everything that is happening. Management seems to
be cautious and interested in keeping costs down,
which is always nice to see...

Yes, nice going with GMT, imo, Brendan. I've been closely watching its recent
downtrend and had planned on adding to my position (I've been in and buying and
posting on it since '97.) if the stock got to 25, but was asleep at the switch
today.

Brendan, I'll add to my airline holdings by starting a position today in Mike
Burry's pick of MAIR. ($6.20/sh.)

If it can hold its cash (about $4.72/sh. and no ltd, per Yahoo), I'd guess the
lows have been seen already ($4.95/sh.). Good possibility, I am willing to bet,
that the stock can sell at least 1x book ($8.35) even as revenues are cut back
very substantially.

jmo,
and like many airline investors,
I've been mostly wrong many, many times in this sector

(aside to thread readers: I don't mean to imply that Mike Burry is favoring
MAIR currently. His analysis was published before events of 9/11. From his CNBC
page, he is not in the stock now.)

Today's activity.

Added to JP Morgan Chase (JPM). It yields over 4%. The PE on next year's
earnings are about 10.5 if you want to believe the estimate.

Sold most of my E*Trade at $7.75. My average cost is $5.51. Three weeks ago it
bottomed at $4.07. They have eroded book value down to below $5 from over $6
when I started buying. I still think it's probably worth $4 billion to someone
over the next five years. I will look to add in the $4s.

Added to Plum Creek Timber (PCL) at $27. I believe it is the largest timber
company in the world. It yields 8.4 percent. I paid a 10 percent stupidity
commission on this investment... I didn't like the bid/ask spread at $24.25 a
couple days ago, so I paid $27 today.

Added to McGrawHill (MHP) at $50. It is close to a 52 week low. It is pretty
expensive at over 18x next year's eps of $2.71.

Sold Wind River Systems (WIND) at $13.75. This represents a 42% bounce off this
month's bottom. I made a 5% return. The company's revenues and earnings have
declined more precipitously than I expected. I will start a position again in
the $10s.

Added to Equity Office Properties (EOP) at $30.50. This is the largest office
REIT. It yields 6.5 percent compared to the 10 year bond at 4.7%. Moodys rates
its debt at baa2. The company was added to the S&P500 index this week.

Brendan, I've relooked at JPM thanks to your post. (I've been in this stock
since mid 1990's, and I've posted it on it here occasionally since the thread
began.) Sold most at higher levels after Chase merger announcement.) Stock
still fits my relative-dividend yield model, and I've been reinvesting JPM
dividends into JPM stock. Current price does seem to be a good entry point and
a good point for me to jump up my position. So I bought today.

PCL. I'm still holding PCL. I got it in a recent arbitrage play (TPG stock for
PCL). PCL looked good enough that I decided to keep it. (The arbitrage business
may have contributed to the spread and/or recent trading pattern of PCL.)

MHP: I saw it hit new lows. Looked too expensive for me still though.

Oops. Looks like I was a little early on that JPM add.
---------
Today I've done the following:

EK: added to my position after today's announcement of a dividend increase.

SCRA: added to my long-time and losing position after today's upbeat news
release.

PVN: Stock collapsed on news of loan losses and writeoffs. Dangerous business,
imo - credit card loans to high risk individuals. And seems to me like these
businesses have accounting 'tricks' which puff up non-existent
assets/reserves/book value. (just my impression, unsupported by facts). Still,
company is a big player, has had excellent reported (if I am to believe the
numbers) returns on equity, the stock is selling at a multi-year low, people
will still be wanting credit (not that they should be getting it though), so
I've made a small bet here that the business and stock can improve within 12-18
months.

Took small profits in ATMI. Not a value stock. I just do not have the courage
to hold on to it or the patience to ride it down and up again.

Sold Doubleclick (DCLK) at $7.94.

I'm now even on my "clicks" having offset Valueclick loss. I bought the DCLK at
$6.07 on 9/24. I'm disappointed how the revenue continues to decline and that
overall internet usage declined for the first time in September.

Added to USBank (USB) at $17.03. This is an S&P100 bank thought of as a
low-cost, efficient bank. The downward price stems I think from recently
increased loan loss reserves ($1 billion). The dividend yield is 4.4% on 75c.
Next year's PE is 9.4 on $1.81. Price to book is about 2.1 on $8.10 per yahoo.
Moody's rates their senior debt at "a1" as of this month.

Trimmed just a bit of RYL here. Added more CHEZ to my losing position.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ryl+chez&d=t

Ryland: From my analytical perspective there's little logic in this sell
decision. (Stock is still undervalued, imo.) I am just getting a bit nervous
and jumpy riding these homebuilder stocks - I have a bunch of them - so I will
arbitrarily pick my long-term RYL holding and sell just a tad of it to take
some profit, relieve some tension, and free up some cash.

Suprema Specialties: regarding Marty Whitman's preference for safe and cheap,
the business of selling mozzarella, ricotta and provolone cheeses ought to be
safe enough (I guess)if CHEZ can continue to get its share of business. I don't
know if the stock is cheap enough for Mr. Whitman, but I'll bet on it now.
(Anybody looking at this stock though would be aware that there's a 3.5M sh.
secondary coming out, so, imo, it's possible, maybe likely, that that is
depressing and may continue to depress, the stock price.)

Hello Paul!

I apologize for not getting back to you sooner. It has been a very hectic
several weeks for me, both professionally and personally. Not nearly enough
hours in the days in which to accomplish all that needs to be done.

Regarding EMR and CR. I have not studied these companies in detail. A quick
look at the cash flow indicates to me that EMR is still a bit rich for my
tastes. CR is right on the edge of what is minimally acceptable.

Admittedly, this analysis is based on the YTD cash flow numbers from their most
recent 10Q filings and therefore represent only 9 months for EMR and 6 months
for CR. This could be an extremely unfair way for me to evaluate them as the
periods involved are so short. However, as unfair as it may be, I am
constrained by time pressures that allow me to only pursue the more detailed
investigation of those opportunities which are even apparent in the short term.

I have about another month of this extreme time pressure confluence of events
and then I can devote more time to deeper review of a broader list of potential
values.

Again. I apologize for the delay in response to you.

CVS interesting again?
Do you have an opinion on CVS? This looks like a recession proof quality
business with a few problems selling for a reasonable prices (PE about 16).

Yes, CVS maybe could be a buy. I've got it on my watch list, but I'm still
having trouble figuring out how to assess the risk/reward or valuation of this
company.

If I go by earnings and sales growth, the earnings have been marching up over
the past few years and sales have doubled in the past 6 years. But so have
shares outstanding. And ltd has moved up steadily too.

OTOH, p/sales is at a multiyear low and d/e is relatively (imo) low at about
.2. They are a big and strong company: "1 out of every 9 prescriptions in this
country is filled at a CVS/pharmacy! CVS has the #1 market share in 34 of the
top 100 U.S. drugstore markets, more than any other chain. We are #1 in store
count, operating approximately 4,100 stores." (quote from their web site)

If they can be expected to continue their dominance, if the population is aging
and numbers of prescriptions will be increasing, and if this all means that
that CVS stock will once again be seen to be attractive (more attractive than
it is now), then imho, CVS is now a buy. The play for me being that the stock
will regress to higher levels (now about 32-33 & it has traded over 50 at some
point in years '98,'99,'00, and '01)
I say there's a good chance that $50/sh or higher will recur - guessing maybe
within 2 years.

OTOH, the p/e, although relatively low, is absolutely high(imo) for a value
stock in today's market. Are we or are we not over-stored with these
pharmacies? Is the shortage of pharmacists (as reported in the media if I
recall) a positive or a negative? These chains seem to be on every block
already, each trying to expand even further. And pharmacy sales are an
opportunity target for the large grocery chains too. Plus, more and more people
(I am guessing here) are tied into HMO's with their own associated pharmacies.
(I am assuming the bulk of CVS's sales/earnings are related to
pharmacy/prescription services.) So imo, there is a chance that the overall
growth (CVS sales/sh) will not translate to management/investor earnings
expectations and can not justify the current p/e multiple. Especially if we are
going deeper into bear territory where all growth expectations (p/e multiples)
are lowered. In other words, I have trouble seeing a margin-of-safety with CVS
stock price.

If I could resolve these differences in my mind I might be able to come to
either a buy or avoid conclusion. -g-

For now, I continue the easy path of just watching.

Grommit, you reported that you were buying. Can you (or any other thread
reader) weigh in now with an opinion on CVS?
