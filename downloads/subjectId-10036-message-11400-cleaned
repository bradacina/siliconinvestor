Agree with you on Movi, had picked some up earlier and have been trying
everytime it gets near three to pick up more.
Discounted cash flow would seem to support a value of ~7 assuming no growth.
Book about 5 & they are aggessive in their stock repurchases. I have kids and
would agree with their assessment that the playstation 2 is going to drive
rentals up winter quarter.

Dont know if you like reits or not, but one that I have been interested in off
an on is SNH. Only drawback is the management structure. I am encouraged that
management doesnt appear to be taking advantage of it, but unfortunately, the
structure is geared towards maximizing management income not shareholder value.

CAIR & LTBG, tethered to wireless growth as payment enablers, are headed
towards a merger that the market doesn't appear to like. I think the merger
makes good strategic sense, but didn't like the take out price/ratio [I'm long
CAIR near current levels] as it undervalues CAIR based on EV/EBITDA. If you
look at this, note the cash levels and consider the earning capacity on the
balance. Four possibilities: They get together as planned [the second link is a
post describing this scenario], they deepen joint venture activity to show
market what they can do, then re-float the merger at closer EV/EBITDA parity
[My personal fav], they go their own ways [CAIR looks way way undervalued at
EV/EBITDA <4 and hot growth assets, or BCGI wakes up, smells the coffee, and
buys one or both at substantial premium to both cover their rear in prepay and
realize international and phone fuel growth.

I've been looking at CSL (as a value stock)for the past six months or so. Two
things have given me pause: 1. I don't see how the components fit together; 2.
the price has been swinging between $30 to $50/share for the past three years
and it its not been close enough to the $30 figure since I've been watching it.

And on the other hand... I could make an argument to buy CSL at current price.
Valuations (price-sales, PE, yield, debt, etc) make for an attractive purchase.
Management appears to be solid, and their small interest in fiber optics adds a
little sizzle to the steak.

"Nasdaq has advised the Company that the trading

proposed to de-list the Company's securities from trading on the Nasdaq

Having just finished reading the SPORE 10K they do look like a bunch of
"bumblefucks":
-incompetent accounting, that you can't just blame on outside auditors.
-The loss of sales at the end of FY 2000 looks to be partly due to poor control
and mgmt of business.
-Senior mgmt with no background in this industry.
-Compare this company with a principal competitor ASHW and it looks like night
and day. Rather than hire competent mgmt to do a good job and get the price of
the stock up, it looks like they just sit on their asses, perform poorly and
buy back stock at a deserved discount.

The key question in my mind is whether this company gets its lunch eaten by
competitors and just withers away before its poor management sells out to
someone competent. Of course, they will also have to deal with shareholder
lawsuits now. In my opinion, the stock will easily see a 52 week low when it

Grommit, Wallace, others looking at transportation stocks-- fwiw, you might
want to look at HUBG. Going through today's new lows list I've found it among
three that I like and am buying today:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=fdy+tt+hubg&d=t

All of these stocks have problems.

All are also trading under stated book value (FDY's stated bv might be highly
overstated as they may've overpaid for many recent acquisitions.), and all have
seen better times in the past. All have low price/sales and/or low price to
ebitda. FDY and HUBG show recent insider buying.

While I like HUBG the best among the three, I'm playing these as a package --
looking for reversion to the mean. Maybe only one of the three will work out,
but looking in that rear view mirror - the one that does work could be a double
or triple. And if so, and if the other two would just hold their ground - the
package would work out profitably for me (assuming I can be patient enough to

OROA is far superior than MAJ. I am very familiar with the brothers P and was a
shareholder at timeof the most recent highly accretive unsolicited bid. (BTW-
the previous bid was MAJ bidding for OROA). Big difference is that OROA is
putting more products into customers and expanding distribution base to create
unit growth oppty (masked by gold price declines) while MAJ stagnates. OROA has
been aggressively buying back stock at prices that have greatly accellerated
return on equity. I don't mind holding a company as long as its book value is
growing at an increasing rate.

Guy at OROA still wants to acquire MAJ. If only shareholders could revolt and
force it.

Unlike OROA where Guy actually owns more than majority, the brothers P
exercised control and blew off the huge premium bid while owning maybe 1/3 of
the stock. Large institutional shareholders sat idly by and some (goldman sachs
in particular) didn't even support shareholder proposal to mandate independence
on board. This was MAJ's shareholder's last hope as brothers P then went in
market and bought shares and had co buy back shares effectively raising their
ownership to tighter control.

Its only a matter of time before MAJ succumbs to deal that makes imminent
sense.

Tomato, re: SKO. Sorry I ever heard of SKO or mentioned it here.

Normally, I'd be inclined to see if averaging down would be appropriate. Now
I'm not so sure. The stock's decimated, dropping below 5, we're facing tax loss
selling, there's really no evidence of insider buying, and there's no
indication that SKO can still compete profitably in the difficult discount
segment.

OTOH, the retailing sector is generally down (but not necessarily for all
retailers), SKO has had profitable years before, and they "should" (my quotes)
eventually return to profitability. IF they do, the stock imo, being so
undervalued, could (maybe) double or triple or more from here. I'll assume the
business model which SKO's chairman says "remains fundamentally sound", is
indeed viable, and I'll hold on to my position. At least to see if the stock
stabilizes. For this one though, if people keep voting on it the way they have
and the stock drops another point or so, I just may admit defeat.

What's your take now on SKO?

The GTSI formula was very simple. Buy at 2 3/4, and sell on any spike.

BUT...This time I didn't sell. Almost did at 4, but didn't. That earnings
report was a very big change. There is no way I sell a net-net whose operating
profit margin just went up 200 basis points. There is a strong statement in the
earnings release that business is getting better - much better. And you still
have a government decision on a huge contract to be announced (when it was
announced they had the contract, the stock spiked to 6 - SELL, when it was
contested by a competitor the stock fell back to the magic 2 3/4 level - BUY).
That contract could still come through, but the improvement in the business has
nothing to do with that contract. I'm thinking I'll always have the chance to
sell this stock at 3 1/4 - that's my downside. But the upside is 8-15. I'll
narrow that down when I have to, but for now it doesn't matter. Pick your
price, but the stock is a buy.

DIYH is looking more & more like a REAL ESTATE play.
FACT..they sold the land & building of 2 previously closed stores for $8.6
million. I am told its reasonable to expect the others are worth similar
amounts. I was going to discount it, but considering its been a year I think
the increase in valuation means no discounting is needed.
So $4.3 million x 4.75 stores (sold 1/4 of one)= $20.42 million, less about 2
million for the land on 2 of the stores they dont own = $18.42 million in real
estate= $2.53 PER SHARE !
Going ahead and figuring 64% on inventory and adding other assets and cash =
$17.171 million, deduct ALL liabilities of $16.375 and the excess is $796,500
or 11 cents a share.
So, I just demonstrated how, upon liquidation, there could be $2.64 a share
left over.
The thing is, its not going to happen all at once. Instead, I expect more
closures as time goes by. But, they should have dept paid off soon and while
profitability is not likely, I do believe they can run at cash flow neutral at
the very least.
Then there is always the possibility that they could get down to 4-5 stores,
and tweak their mix further and make them moderately profitable.
My argument is with the stock at 66 cents, the worst case scenario would yield
shareholders a nice return...EVENTUALLY.

The fact that the insiders seem to load up everytime shares become available is
also a plus.
Its always possible that they try to take it private at a lowball $1.25 offer
or something... in which case we would still make a good return. I would think
it would be very difficult to get a fairness opinion anywhere below $2 however.

Second what rjm said about GTSI. That contract is bonus points. Maybe a lot of
bonus points.

And Jeff, with all due respect, when a guy I consider smart says he would not
buy X at any price when a lot of X's are 70% off their highs it really sparks
my contrarian instinct. I have been very aggressive on retailers recently and
have been making a lot of money off them (ANF, SYM, a couple others). In my
personal account I shorted Kohls at 60 times earnings against my retailer
holdings. I think that I'll be OK with large positions in SYM and ANF against a
large KSS short. But even without the long-short, I am still finding retailers
that look EXTREMELY attractive. It has become my one of my favorite hunting
grounds. I think I might have just found another one with a "duh" valuation.

Reminds me of when Bill Gross of Pimco recently said he wouldn't buy corporate
bonds at any price. That's what you hear at a bottom. This guy is the biggest
bond manager in the country - nobody's questioning his intelligence, but a
contrarian's got to at least think about buying when the biggest guy in the
business says he's already sold. And high yield corporates are yielding 14%. I
don't buy bonds, but I play this through what I judge to be a diversified
basket of lay-up LBOs if the high yield market shows any sign of life. I won't

OK, but I've gotta ask what it is you are saying.

Are you saying that you have bought (or have prepared a list, and will buy) a

Christmas season and thereafter will be very iffy. I have no objection to
investment in retailers whose survival is not an issue.

By the way, anyone have any idea how much of operating costs of a retailer are
heating costs?

Brendan Watt, Grommit, others? Nice call on YUM. You're joined by Mr. Buffett
now (as you may know), who's taken a 1% position.

I looked at YUM about every time it's been discussed here and could not see the
value and passed on it. And I still don't see the value one more time. Guess
it's size (clout) of company and low price/ebitda or enterprise value stuff??
Lot of inside buying though since June '99, from 50 down to 28 range. (Stock is
now about 33-34.)

More sorry I missed Darden (DRI). I am more comfortable with their restaurants
(Olive Garden) and historical performance than I am with YUM (which is
inexplicable to me). (aside: not that being comfortable with a restaurant is in
any way, imo, a determinant of investment success with the parent's stock.) DRI
I have been monitoring and just watching it move away from me. And today also
ILFO (Il Forniao), which I've been watching closely for an opportunity to
reenter, has just popped today on a buyout offer. Nuts!
Another miss has been CAKE (Cheesecake Factory) which I shoulda/coulda/dint buy
a couple of times when it's been under 20. I'm still monitoring DAB --on that
one I took losses in '99, and based on their past surprise earnings misses, I'm
not so sure I'm willing to reenter. Meanwhile, I hold APPB (Applebee's) and
BOBE (Bob Evans), both of which I've been taking profits on as they've moved up
since posts on them here. I also have a small position in Landry's (LNY).

Paul- any opinion on the asbestos victims. I own a little CCK which got creamed
today catching up with other victims like ACK and USG. From what I understand,
CCKs exposure to asbestos is minimal and involves a business they were in 40
years ago. My instincts tell me this is an opportunity. They have a 21% yield.
Even with their onerous dividend, heavy debt load and the poor current business
conditions they should be cash flow positive this quarter. At some point I
would think there must be value. Certainly there has been an up trade in the
tobacco stocks this year. I know the technicalities of the asbestos liability
are different. The street analysts I have spoken to seem to think that the only
way to stop the bankruptcy bandwagon is through legislation.

Sears has been discussed here before. There is an article in the latest Forbes

interesting parts I found was on page 287 where they showed Sears leasing 50
million square feet for $10 / square foot -- when mall property is going for
about $108 / square foot. Some of these leases are as long as 20 years out.

Other discussion was on them getting rid of apparel and also their focus on
their "Great Indoors" business (which seems risky to me from the standpoint of
macro economic risk). Not a lot of people purchase $18,000 kitchens when the

HBI is likely going convert their failing Homebase stores to their new concept
called "House 2 Home" based on test results from 5 stores.
Margins are much better. With a book value over $10 per share and the shares at
$1.50, I believe its a decent bet.
Sure, they will eat up a lot of that book value in the conversion but they
should end up with a good chunk left.
The big thing is they have to do SOMETHING with their locations.
I bought more last week. I speculate that its possible they sell some of their
better locations to Lowes or someone in conjunction with this new plan.
Its likely that some stores will be closed and not converted too.

like its a real estate play now. I figure at least $2.50+ per share in real

"Internet" has been a dirty word to value players over the past several years,
but a lot has changed since last January. It's not too hard to find stocks

Another tough day for investors. I'm making the following adds today: Buying
more Dana, TRW, and Adaptec.

I'm also buying Valassis. The positives with this company for value investors
might be: company's main business - those much beloved (-g-) Sunday newspaper
advertising inserts - "may" be recession proof, the company apparently (from
what I read) has "substantial" (my quotes) free cash flow (Stock outstanding
and debt are coming down.), earnings have increased every year for at least
past 6 years, there's a pe of about 11. Negatives to be considered include
sales growth rate, a still high (imo)price/sales, and negative book value
(something about when the company ipo'd in '92 they had to offer up stock and
debt to their owner). Also, the stock today is in the 28 range - while that's
down from highs, it is up from lows seen in October, so coming into the stock
now is joining the party a little late maybe.

Also today I'm starting to buy URS Corporation which is a rapidly growing
construction engineering firm. Some of the value measures for it are the mirror
image of those for Valassis.
URS growth - earnings increases every year for past 6 - are accompanied by
growth in number of shares outstanding and a very large increase in debt. After
an acquisition, ltd/eq = 1.8 -- that'll be a reason for its dismissal by a lot
of people here -g-. It looks like URS has positive free cash flow though, and
the p/sales is low (imo) at .1 with a pe under 6. The company is broad in its
geographic reach and the types of business it undertakes. (They have about
15,700 employees, according to Yahoo.) They reported an increase in backlog in
their latest (9/00) report. URS might pop up for those who are screening for a
play on infrastructure ugrades -roads/bridges/airports - that might occur here
(in the USA).
I've not checked URS accounting methods, but if they have fixed pricing and use
percentage of completion or a variant, then there may be a risk that they could
restate current and past earnings when key jobs going many years are finally
completed and all actual expenses are then recognized. (For now, I'll assume
that that is a small possibility affecting the stock, given the diversity of
contracts and already low price (imo) of URS.)

Taking some profits today in Merck.

Technology --

Well, as was said here before, not even the CEO's of these companies know if
there will be a semiconductor equipment slowdown or not. So, I'm betting on the
natural cycle. The cycle of equipment and the cycle of investor infatuation.

I figure that investors will settle down in a few months once they see that the
next US administration will not change things very much one way or another.

Also, mutual funds have more cash now then they have had in a long time. It
will eventually reenter the market.

So over the past month or so, I have picked up a few semi equip stocks. ATMI
yesterday. Others include -- AMAT, KLIC, ASYT, EGLS, ASTX/MKSI.

(And I still like NSM, KEM, VSH, APCC, CA,...)

I do not expect a bubbly increase in the stock prices, like last summer's. But
you never know...

Any thoughts or other's that we should consider?

Another tough day in the market. Grommit, for some other tech ideas I offer:
ECIL, IDTC (cash in search of a business) and TRID. I'm holding positions in
some of the stocks you mentioned also - KEM, NSM, CA, EGLS.

I continue to monitor several electronic component distributor stocks - Avnet
(AVT) and Arrow (ARW - I have a tiny position), for example. Somewhere around
the current $10 level for distributor All American Semiconductor (SEMI) it
might be a buy (imo), and I may add to my position. (Although I was pretty
wrong now to have last added when the stock was at $18.)

Like you, I have also recently begun to buy ATMI. To me ATMI looks like a very
good Gaarp stock. Good history of rev increases, price at yearly low with
accompanying low relative price/sale, price/earnings and price/book figures.
Not much LTD.
Very good (imo) latest quarterly report-- They say they are expanding capacity
due to increased demand for their products/services. For a small company they
are involved in several aspects of the semiconductor business (maybe too many
aspects??), and I can't figure out all that they do and the individual
prospects. The part that I do like is that they make consumables for semi's, so
unlike KLIC and others which sell capital equipment (primarily), I "assume"
ATMI has an on-going stream of orders for their consumables which are
correlated to the amount of production of their customers.

-------I'm selling some stocks today before their time.

Some of us have to deal with the pain of our declining stocks as we cope with a
broad market decline. -g- Except for a few(??) ---guys like Twister
(newspapers, cable, Buffett stuff) or J. Clarke/rjm (net-nets), who I am
guessing might be- so far- unaffected. For the rest of us, I see our options
now as sell, buy, do nothing. There's another option which would be: befriend
the trend - sell short. I dismiss this with my usual "ridiculous" -- a
dangerous option now to sell low and try to buy back lower- an option which
goes against the value investor's BUY low to sell higher.
Anyway, for me, to DO SOMETHING about my pain - I'm just taking some profits
here and then I'll go out for a walk:

THX (trimming position). Thanks again, Archimedes for this stock idea.
BPOP (partial sale). I'll reenter if this bank stock drops in sympathy with
many other banks stocks that've already come down to lows.
CCL (close out). I'll attempt to reenter if Carnival drops to 19-20. (My thanks
to the person who first mentioned it here or on Buffetology thread)
FAF( close out). The Chicago Title buyer of couple of years ago. Stock off its
highs but still surprisingly high imo considering recent announcement of
earnings decline.
PH (close out). Was an exploratory position when stock hit new low-- moved up
too quickly for me to add more. Stock could be stuck unless there's a catalyst.
OTOH, I could just be too impatient.

Regards all. Happy Thanksgiving USA people!

too pricey in my opinion and writing calls at 2/1 ratio has no meaningful
upside risk and 20% downside protection. Lots of room for stock to move up in

Re: Brendan Watt, Grommit, others? 

Paul, my recent activity can be summarized as stepping up on retail and energy,
trimming real estate.

RETAIL

I added to Shopko (SKO) at around $5 and $4 dropping my average cost to $4.50.
Moody's signalled a possible downgrade from BAA3, but no action yet.

I've added to Sears (S) at around $31. A3 rated debt, forward PE around 6, 3%
yield. The Great Indoors concept looks attractive, but mainly I think it is
underappreciated how tightly woven this company is in the lives of American
consumers.

I've added to Penneys (JCP) at $11. Price to sales is approaching .08, but
there's some rocks in operations.

I've added to Wild Oats (OATS) at $5. This is a natural foods retailer with a
market cap of $111 million, 111 stores, and a forward PE of around 12. The
company has been hurt in head to head competition with Whole Foods (WFMI), but
there seems to be lots of room for secular growth for both companies, and OATS
would make a small snack for a SWY, KR, or a European grocer.

ASBESTOS

I looked at Bemis, but ended up buying Sealed Air (SEE) at around $39. SEE is
around 15x cash earnings (adding back amortization). They seem to have been
hurt this week by a possible link to the asbestos litigation… they bought some
lines of business from Grace. I threw in the towel on Armstrong World at $3.
Basically, I lost faith because of management's inaction. No insider buys and
no effective communication to the investor community about what is going on.
Plus I don't know why they paid last quarter's dividend if the threat of
bankruptcy is as real as evidenced by the stock price decline. I haven't taken
any other action on any other asbestos plays. I was disappointed to see USG
remove its own stock as a retirement investment option for its employees.

ENERGY

I had almost no exposure to energy since I disposed the drillers after a 100%
runup 18 months ago. My only position coming into November was XEL bought about
one year ago at $20. This month I added Conoco (COC.A) at $26 and American
Power Conversion (APCC) at $13. Conoco is around 10x earnings. I'm labeling
APCC an energy play… my thesis here is that around 11x earnings that is an
attractive speculation on the future energy shortages and unreliability of the
American power supply. APCC seems to be the leader in power protection for PCs
and low-end servers.

REAL ESTATE

I sold Winston Hotels (WXH) at around $8. My total return was around 4 percent
annualized. I sold Associated Estates (AEC). I had a total return loss of over
50 percent and gave up on management. I sold Engle Homes (ENGL) at $19… 6 month
holding period, 110 percent absolute gain.

OTHER

I threw in the towel on Worldcom (WCOM) at $15 for a 33 percent loss.
Management halved the earnings expectations for 2001. Also, they confirmed
plans for tracking stocks which generally make me uncomfortable.

I began a position in Bankamerica (BAC) at $39. Forward PE around 7, yield of
5.9 percent, AA2 rated credit.

I started a position in Newell Rubbermaid (NWL) at $19. The forward PE is
around 10 and it yields around 4.4 percent.

I added to International Flavors (IFF) at $18. The forward PE is around 14. It
yields 8.2 percent. I'm investing on the expectation that this company has a
globally recognized competency in flavors and fragrances but so far I've been
wrong.

I began a position in Pitney Bowes (PBI) at $28. Forward PE is around 10 and I
think the internet's threat to the mail metering business is comparable to the
"dot-coms" threat to the major retailers.

I threw in the towel on Case New Holland (CNH) at $10 for a 0 percent loss. I
was just cleaning up a lack of discipline on my part. I don't buy into minority
interests.

That's all for now.

Thanks John,

From a quick look at the profiles, those are the kind of things I had in mind.
Leapnet (LEAP) is one I've been accumulating for a few months. It's basically a
turnaround play. Cash burn is running around $5 million per quarter, with $50
million in cash and short term investments. Very clean balance sheet and some
recent management changes which I think can return the company to
profitability. Currently trading below cash per share, but it's probably more
of a rolling stock until it turns the corner.

I noticed from the charts on both TRID and ALSC, which you mentioned, that they
were both trading around $2-$3 about a year ago. I've pretty much come to the
conclusion that a lot of the best values are in that price range. Once a stock
drops below $5, it starts getting hammered on margin calls. It also limits the
stock to cash buyers until it comes back into margin range. When the market is
half way stable, I can usually expect to sift through at least 50 companies in
that price range to find one or two that aren't pure dogs. The last screen I
ran, the clean balance sheets were hitting closer to one or two out of 10.

A few things I'm watching from the sidelines are EONC and RHAT, although I'm
not convinced Linux is going to be the next MSFT. RHAT looks like it's on its
way to going below book. Cheap and value aren't the same thing. Book on MRCH is
mostly goodwill, but it is trading below tangible assets and the revenue
numbers are pretty remarkable for a $2 stock. Unfortunately, the current cash
burn is also pretty remarkable. I'm mostly waiting to see if some of their
restructuring efforts will slow the burn rate.

DIRI is kind of a strange little company. I had a small position just for
grins, but got chicken on the last run and took the profits. Cash per share is
being held in an escrow account from an asset sale last year. The cash is due
to be released in January, but they sold some debentures to raise short term
operating capital which I didn't like the looks of. A delisting notice from
NASDAQ causes a default on the debentures. My guess is they will default, pay
off the debentures, and do a 1 for 10 reverse split to meet the NASDAQ $1
requirement. I wouldn't touch it before the potential bad news is out of the
way, but if I see $2 after a reverse split, I might throw some fun money at it.
The business itself strikes me as having some interesting potential. Reading
the filings is sort of like reading a cheap detective novel. You know it's
junk, but it's still hard to put down.

VCLK and NETP both look like what I was talking about in my last post. They
should be worth the time it'll take me to read the filings. MCOM just broke
below the neck line on a text book perfect head and shoulders pattern. I may
have to read the filings just to see if I can figure out how a company can have
that much cash and still have a chart that looks like a train wreck about to
happen. The last time I saw a that much cash per share in a Yahoo profile,
there was a ton of convertible preferred outstanding. It might make an
interesting straddle play with options a few months out.

Thanks for the ideas. LEAP is my only e-commerce holding right now, but I'd
like to add a few more things in the sector before tax loss season runs down.
Anything dependant on consumer spending makes me very nervous right now with
energy prices and interest rates as high as they are. I also suspect the melt
down in dot coms left a lot of optimists with margin calls and a ton of debt.
No more free money to buy luxury items. Other than the idea of shorting bank
stocks in case the world comes to an end, I'm thinking B2B's with lots of cash
have the best chance of a sharp rebound in a more stable market. Like the man
said, "There can't be too much more downside risk, we're almost out of chart."

MTP <<<Any input?>>>

Definately not a value play. You want to be super careful when analyzing any
company with oil assets. They use full cost accounting methods which in most
cases amount to a huge overhead in unrealized loses. The old saw about an oil
well is a hole in the ground with a liar standing next to it, applies to just
about every company in the sector. GAAP allows so much leeway in the use of
estimates and the treatment of expenses, that book value and earnings become
almost meaningless. The only way to analyze energy companies is to focus on
cash and debt levels. Companies with real assets and earnings don't need to
issue junk bonds or preferred stock, carry high levels of accounts receivable,
or max out their lines of credit. And they don't capitalize interest expenses
and wages as assets. They also don't need to spin off their unrealized losses
as IPO's every few years to suck more cash out of the public. There are no
value plays in energy these days. The sector has been hyped to the point that
it would take $100 a barrel oil for 10 years for most of them to become
solvent. You can't compare tech balance sheets to oil balance sheets. The rules
are completely different. If there is preferred stock, note holders, and/or
secured creditors ahead of common, treat book value as less than zero.

Brendan Watt, some interesting ideas you've listed. Thanks for taking the time.

Regarding your pick of BAC, I'm considering adding to my very small losing
position in Bankamerica (BAC). Stock may be down because of potential increases
in loan losses and/or perhaps analysts' fears that BAC has not taken sufficient
loan loss reserves.

I monitor COC.A. I had considered buying when it was about 20, but I missed it,
and I'm reluctant to step in now that Conoco is at 26 level -- although it
might very well still be a decent buy. I bought OXY (not as a value stock)
recently when it was at lower prices. Now I'm considering buying REP (Repsol)
because this oil co. is near its lows.

I gave up on my long term and losing position in Penney, and sold last month
for the tax loss.

Somehow I passed up OATS to buy Whole Foods. Recently, I've been taking profits
there (WFMI) as it's moved up from lows. My other grocery position is a losing
one in Albertson's (ABS). On the assumption that the tough but oh-so-arrogant
ABS will eventually actually be able to figure out how to profitably integrate
their recent Lucky Stores acquisition, I will continue to hold ABS and add if
the stock drops to lows. I monitor IMKTA (Ingles)which I like because of the
decent dividend and their real estate. (They are often the anchor tenant in
their owned shopping centers.) Although the price is near lows -- I'm not
buying yet. I am looking at GAP (Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co). It is a
cheap stock. But, their smallish and outdated(?) stores, plus other problems
(poor management(?), poor execution(?) or poor business model(?)
may make the stock still too high priced. Aside: Anyone here have an opinion on
GAP?

Asbestos: These companies with well-publicized potential or actual legal
troubles - USG, etc. are too tough for me. News articles repeatedly hinting,
suggesting, positing, that these companies will or could go out of business --
the effect is just to make me give up, get out, and redeploy funds somewhere
"safer".

That is just painful to read. It tells you that at least in the short run luck
is a part of this game. But you're right about the way the news came out. When
I heard about it I would have had a good deal of time to buy before the stock
really popped, but since it was up a point I figured that was it. Should this
make investors reevaluated asbestos stocks? It is very hard to find one though
where asbestos is the only problem. ACK probably files regardless due to the
debt maturity. Likewise FMO looks shaky asbestos or no asbestos. CCK too.

Could we be looking here at a major secular peak in the power of trial
attorneys? Buffett has just bought two "liability stocks" Benjamin Moore and
USG, just as the news is filled with a story that just seems beyond absurd -
trial lawyers attempting to decide a presidential election. And it looks as if
they are going to fail. Tobaccos and HMOs have already rallied quite a bit, but
can anybody think of another creative play on this?

USG

I recall reading an article in the last year or so that Buffet had received
permission to not file reports on his positions for one year after they were
acquired or sold due to the volatility his interests tended to cause. It also
might be worth noting that corporate raider Carl Ichan took a large stake in
FMO at an average price of $17 a share earlier this year. The USG 8K filed
11/17/00 should be required reading for anyone feeling bullish on the company.
If anyone can think of a reason why a company would refuse to allow their
employees to invest in the Company's stock for their retirement accounts, which
is good news to private investors, I'd like to hear it. With interest rates sky
high and the usual winter slow down in construction added to a shaky economy, I
find it a little hard to imagine this as being a good time to start a position
in building materials. My guess is anyone buying USG right now is just helping
Warren to keep a lid on his tax loss selling.

From form 10Q filed 11/8/00:

<<<The U.S. market for gypsum wallboard transitioned from short supply, as
experienced in 1999, to excess supply in 2000. Also, new industry capacity is
being added in 2000 and 2001. As a result, management anticipates continued
softness in its gypsum wallboard results for the remainder of 2000 and into
2001.>>>

and:

<<<One of the Corporation's subsidiaries, U.S. Gypsum, is a defendant in
asbestos lawsuits alleging both property damage and personal injury. In the
third quarter of 2000, U.S. Gypsum recorded a charge of $27.0 million,
reflecting new filings during the quarter. This compares to a $20.0 million
charge taken in the third quarter of 1999. Accrued asbestos charges for the
first nine months of 2000 total $77.0 million compared with $62.5 million for
the same period in 1999. Asbestos charges to results of operations were higher
in 1999 and 2000 than 1998 because the estimated cost of resolving cases
pending during 1998 will, when expended, consume all of U.S. Gypsum's remaining
insurance; as a result, the estimated liability from new case filings is
currently being charged against reported earnings.>>>

From form 8K filed 11/17/00:

<<<In view of these external factors, and the resulting potential for further
uncertainty in the price of USG Stock, participants in the USG Investment Plan
will not be allowed to make future contributions to the USG Stock fund until
further notice. If you have invested in the USG Stock fund, you should evaluate
the appropriateness of USG Stock in your investment portfolio given current
market conditions and your own personal risk tolerance.>>>

<<Could we be looking here at a major secular peak in the power of trial

reflex towards lawyers with all this slimy election posturing. After the courts
coronate the next pres, a rallying cry that would help unify the country would
be 'Kill the lawyers' tort reform. Nearly everything we buy has a litigation
risk insurance premium, especially health related...If this is highlighted and
combined with recent revulsion towards the lawyerization of the political
process, we may have the makings of a major shift.

USG: I suspect Buffett viewed the valuation discount as the 'premium' on
asbestos litigation insurance risk. Since the risk is limited to the price of
the shares, there isn't the open-ended downside that actually insuring the risk
might entail. He and AJ cranked the probabilities and decided the discount
represented a very profitable premium at his cost of the shares. This may no
longer be the case now that the Buffett premium is built into the shares. While
USG has a very different risk profile than asbestos insulation makers [USG's is
about joint compound - for less likely to be implicated in lung diosrders] and
average settlement costs are far lower, it nevertheless is very difficult to
reasonably quantify.

I was looking at USG and LAF, and decided that LAF is the better stock. Both
companies are lamenting the price drop in drywall. However, gypsum is only 10%
of LAF revenue. LAF is primarily selling Construction Materials & Cement. They
are the largest supplier in North America.

3% dividend yield.
ROE 15%.
PE of around 5. With profits steady for a year or so, then hopefully going up.
The PE over the past 5 years has varried from 4.8 to 16+.
Sales growth over past 5 years is over 11%.
They have been able to pass on only some fuel costs thru surcharges. So price
drop in oil prices would clearly help LAF.

Buffet caused me to pull the trigger this AM, instead of a week or two from
now.

OT
All right--I've had enough of attorney bashing here! To all you trial attorney
haters...besides the topic being OT to begin with, I find it offensive to hear
your constant bitching and moaning. Were it not for trial attorneys, people who
have been injured by negligence and/or defective products would be SOL, or be
forced to accept a pittance after so-called tort reform drastically reduced
their ability to be made as close to whole as possible.

If you think Bridgestone/Firestone is bad, imagine how many other bean counters
would have their way in creating dangerous products if they didn't have to
worry about punitive damage awards lurking?

The country is a much safer place to live today due to the efforts of trial
lawyers and our current tort system. Since many of the people who post here are
conservative in their economic and political views, I find it ironic that a
system that rewards greed, i.e. the contingent fee system, should be
criticized. Or perhaps it's only ok to cheer corporate greed but not any
perceived greed by individuals who have had their lives ruined by the corporate
greed. Greed, say, of a Ford who decided to design their Pinto gas tanks to
save a couple bucks per car, calculating that any possible personal injury
lawsuit verdicts by heirs of people who were turned into toast by any explosion
in a rear-end collision would be offset by the savings to the bottom line?

And critics also must assume that 12 (or less) people on a jury are somehow
hypnotized and turned into idiots by Svengali-like plaintiff's lawyers. I
suggest that any tort critic who, say, had experienced the tragedy of a family
member killed in a roll-over in an Explorer with Firestone tires will have had
their minds changed and would be thankful for our current tort system and for
p.i. lawyers.

Tomato: Sorry if you found my post offensive. It was not meant to be a personal
attack on attorneys. I do believe, however, my response to Jim's comment that
the tide may be turning on tort activity to be on topic and relevant to
investment decisions. I've probably got 10 megs of research on litigation risk
on my HD in an attempt to find a way to quantify this risk, but I'm as far from
that goal as when I started. Tort reform that would at least put some
manageable limits on the extent of the risk would lower the cost of capital and
improve investment returns in many industries. I would agree with your comments
that I'm not coming at this from the perspective of a victim and that
attorney's perform a valuable service by penalizing corporate wrongdoers. I
would also agree that the country is a safer place because of the efforts of PI
attorneys. But I must admit having a hard time seeing how bankrupting an
industry for making a legal product they stopped producing 30 years ago when
it's harmful effects came to light is going to do anything constructive to
correct corporate behavior. I'm not suggesting elimination of tort activity,
just limiting and moderating the impacts.

KEM is now a value priced stock. The numbers:

KEM's book value (hard numbers, no mythical 'goodwill') is $8.36. Merill
lynch's very negative new earnings projections are $4.05 and $3.60 for the next
two years. Total = $16.01
At today's under $19 close, KEM's entire future from 2002 to infinity, is
valued, at most, at under $3.

Note the above forecasts are far lower than any other analyst's prediction. KEM
itself announced a few weeks ago that it forecasts growth for the next two
years, not declines.

KEM has one year backlog of orders.

KEM's current PE is under 9, implied PE for this fiscal year is under 5, while
it's historical average PE is around 15.

Last August, the CEO of KEM said the stock was greatly undervalued, and
announced a 4 million share buyback program. The share price then was over $26.
The price is now down 25% from that greatly undervalued level.

we're looking at a PE under 6 (using the 2001 earnings projection).
