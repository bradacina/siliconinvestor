What Did Buffett Do? Looking at Berkshire's Q1 Portfolio Moves
Monday May 19, 10:08 am ET
http://biz.yahoo.com/indie/080519/1217_id.html?.v=1
From the article:"... looking deeper into Buffett's holdings at the end of Q1,
there are some spots where he was willing to add shares. During the quarter,
Buffett added to stakes in three healthcare firms, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:
UNH - News), WellPoint (NYSE: WLP - News), and, to a lesser extent,
Sanofi-Aventis (NYSE: SNY - News). He also added to his stake in used-car
retailer CarMax (NYSE: KMX - News).

Meanwhile, Buffett trimmed his stake in information storage and management firm
Iron Mountain (NYSE: IRM - News) and exited his stake in financial-services
company Ameriprise Financial (NYSE: AMP - News). He also held steady with his
positions in Nike (NYSE: NKE - News), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC - News), and
Costco (Nasdaq: COST - News)...."

========================================

Started a new position in the IRA with UNH shares. The dividend yield is very
small, so most of the gain should come from capital gains. I prefer high
yielding dividend paying securities in the IRA but with a PE of 9 it is quite a
bargain at the current level.

I now own UNH shares in both the IRA and my taxable account.

Yes, there will be dilution. In the past, the company killed the stock by
selling shares significantly below market value. Fortunately, they didn't do
that with their latest deal with Abax Lotus Ltd. But it definitely is a
concern.

A bit off topic but still addressing the growth potential, I am currently
reading a book written by James Kynge, the former China bureau chief of the
Financial Times in Beijing. In one chapter he discusses how China is building
an interstate system patterned after the US. The roads are numbered as in the
US and even have signs with white letters and green backgrounds. "Although
18,500 miles have thus far been completed, Beijing plans by 2030 to have laid
53000 miles, about ten thousand miles more than the existing US system."

As we have learned in the US, if you build those roads more cars and trucks
will come. Natural gas will be part of their solution to fueling their
transportation needs. Below is an excerpt from an article in NGV Global:

Rosita Liang, Cornerstone’s Managing Director states that the Chinese
government has already been promoting NGVs as the optimal public transportation
choice in many cities. Most large cities, especially those along gas
distribution routes, currently use natural gas powered public buses and taxis.
She estimates that within 5 years all such public vehicles in large and medium
sized cities will be NGVs.

The Chinese NGV market as a whole is expected to increase dramatically in the
coming years, with a targeted goal of NGVs making up 20% of the total vehicle
population in China by 2020 (currently 50,000 NGVs). There are also
approximately 200 commercial filling stations currently in operation increasing
at a rate of 9% per year.

Paul, I really liked nuclear energy as a counter to peak oil. However, I am
less convinced about the need and ways to invest into it NOW. I will repeat
some of your caveats as reasons: "NIMBY problem in US; very slow permitting
process in democratic countries. Nuclear reactors VERY expensive to build." and
"building itself is slow and long". It just seems that investments will be very
very slooooow. Also, I am not an expert, but I think that most new reactors are
going to be breeder reactors that produce their own fuel (more or less).

I have a very tiny position in NLR for tracking of the field, but I really
don't see a very good way to invest into the field. And I am not sure we will
see explosive growth in any of the companies soon (or ever).

I am late to the solar party and I will not invest there, since it is unclear
which companies and approaches will win in the long term, but there is one HUGE
advantage in that area: there are small-scale solutions that can be adopted
without multimillion capital and time commitments. And such commitments are the

"This year is difficult," Charif Souki said. "But as you get further into the

The event followed the recently announced layoffs of 180 of the company's 367

"It's not a happy occasion," Souki said of job cuts, but he added that
outsourcing gas marketing and completing construction made layoffs necessary.

Souki said, however, that the company has financial staying power at least into
2009, when contracts with Chevron (CVX.N: Quote, Profile, Research) and Total
(TOTF.PA: Quote, Profile, Research) to ship gas through the terminal take

"Raising funds is not an issue for us," Souki said.

I assume it's patent expirations, and fear there are no replacement drugs to
sustain revenue.

If I understand Warren Buffett's recent interview comments correctly, he
doesn't understand the drug pipeline of SNY (stock he recently added to). Just
that there IS a pipeline (research will be brought to market), and if that
takes five years to happen and he has to hold that long for the perception of
the stock to improve, that is okay with him. Since he is buying as ltb&h.

So I figure I might try the same with PFE. I don't see div. being cut -
although it very well could be - it would be a drastic move though by
management, I'd say. So I am buying with a view to hold also for several years
for the better times, and meanwhile I collect a 6% div. yield.

I hold several of these giant pharma companies as a package. I have a few
shares of SNY (am underwater with it), and I may add more SNY to follow Mr.
Buffett.

Started a small position in Ultrapetrol (Bahamas) Ltd. (ULTR. The company
released their Q1 2008 earnings last week and reported a record 48% increase in
revenues. The increase in revenues was due primarily to higher shipping rates
from their Ocean Fleet business (revenues up 144% YOY) but after drilling down
the company also showed good growth in their River Fleet Business (up 26% YOY).
Analysts have estimates of $1.35/share for 2008 which is equivalent to a 9.5
PE.

The stock has doubled in value from its low in March($7.75/share) .

Here is the composition of their current fleet
(http://www.ultrapetrol.net/fleetlist.asp). The company is investing in their
River Business and will be increasing the fleet size by 12% with 56 new barges
and three new push boats to be deployed by 3Qtr 2008. They are building a new
terminal port but still can not meet the growing demand from soybean and iron
ore shipments. They currently obtain margins in the high 20% and it appears
they will have excellent pricing power and operating efficiencies to achieve
margins in the low 30%.

The River Business generates 35% of the company's revenues and is growing at a
14% annual rate. With a company 9.5PE this business segment is undervalued by
36% or about $1.50/share.

Their Offshore Supply Fleet business has multi-year locked in service contracts
and is their most profitable business segment. They have seven new vessels
under construction which will eventually be added to their current fleet of
five, more than doubling their revenues in the next 24-36 months. Current cash
flow from their fixed service contracts more than covers their debt obligation
once the new ships are delivered.

Finally, there was a $0.12 share adjustment to earnings due to currency
exchange gains from $US/$Real conversion. That's a hidden gain of a 23% pop to
earnings from a falling $US. A bonus that adds diversification to ones
portfolio from a falling $US.

-----------------------------------------------------------

The take away for me is that this was a good find Paul. The company has a lot
of very profitable and growing business segments that should grow faster than a
PE of 9.5 imputes.

There are very few analysts that cover the company and their 2009 estimates are
all over the board. If the company earns $2.00/share in 2009 and is priced at a
14PE to reflect their high margin service businesses (River and Offshore
Fleet), the stock would be fairly valued at $28/share. I plan to build my small
position over time since the stock has already had a huge run higher and may
move lower in any market correction.

OT: I have been mulling Mr. Buffett's buying more shares of Kraft. I just don't
get it. Stock does not seem undervalued to me. OTOH, I missed following him
into KFT in the '70's (or maybe it was '80's?) when he took a substantial
position with Kraft at about a p/e of 10. (Interests rates were higher and
p/e's lower then.) I didn't understand his buy then either. Position worked out
very well for him though.) Maybe KFT now for somebody for a cyclical play: buy
now about $32+, sell if/when it hits highs at $36+ again. I've no interest in
KFT though for a ltb&h.

OTOH, I have a few shares of Brazil's SDA. Now there's a food stock in a
growing economy where I can assume people's standard of living is going to
rise, where there's plenty of access to farm products, where there's a
propensity to export (SDA exports). I am coming to believe that that means if I
want to consider a food processor stock that I might be able to live with as a
ltb&h, I can - for me - pick SDA over KFT. Which I have decided to try to do.
I've punched up my exploratory SDA shares now to a 3/4 position.

If I were to buy a major food stock /consumer stable stock i would probably
choose UL, PG and NSRGY over KFT. None of those stocks is cheap currently
however.

SDA has very impressive growth - after a correction it might be very attractive
but much of it is due to raising prices rather than increased volume so those
growth rates are not sustainable.

FWIW I also added to GE today at around 31$. I also sold Pargesa yesterday for
no other reason than the fact that the European markets have done well. I plan
to buy back into either PARG, NAT.BR or GBL.BR (whatever is cheapest in terms
of NAV discount) since they are similar and mostly represent the same assets.

I also bought some ETE the General partner of ETP. ETE has a couple of years of
15-20% distribution growth in front of them. This is part of my macro play on
NG and pipelines/MLP. I own EPE, MGG, NGLS and WMZ besides ETE in this space.

Paul's pick of AHD 9the GP of APL) is also interesting. lot's of gearing in
this one relative to APL distribution growth but APL management is below
average within the MLP space so there is a much larger degree of risk compared
to EPE and ETE.

Moody’s awarded incorrect triple A ratings to billions of dollars worth of a
type of complex debt product due to a bug in its computer models, an Financial
Times investigation has discovered.

Internal Moody’s documents seen by the FT show that some senior staff within
the credit agency knew early in 2007 that products rated the previous year had
received top-notch triple A ratings and that, after a computer coding error was
corrected, their ratings should have been up to four notches lower.

News of the coding error comes as ratings agencies are under pressure from
regulators and governments, who see failings in the rating of complex
structured debt as an integral part of the financial crisis. While coding
errors do occur there is no record of one being so significant.

Moody’s said it was “conducting a thorough review” of the rating of the
constant proportion debt obligations - derivative instruments conceived at the
height of the credit bubble that appeared to promise investors very high
returns with little risk. Moody’s is also reviewing what disclosure of the
error was made.

The products were designed for institutional investors. In the recent credit
market turmoil, those who still hold the products will have suffered some paper
losses while others who have bailed out have lost up to 60 per cent of their
investment.

On discovering the error early in 2007, Moody’s corrected the coding glitch and
instituted methodology changes. One document seen by the FT says “the impact of
our code issue after those improvements in the model is then reduced”. The
products remained triple A until January this year when, amid general market
declines, they were downgraded several notches.

In a statement to the FT, Moody’s said: “Moody’s regularly changes its
analytical models and enhances its methodologies for a variety of reasons,
including to reflect changing credit conditions and outlooks. In addition,
Moody’s has adjusted its analytical models on the infrequent occasions that
errors have been detected.

“However, it would be inconsistent with Moody’s analytical standards and
company policies to change methodologies in an effort to mask errors. The
integrity of our ratings and rating methodologies is extremely important to us,
and we take seriously the questions raised about European CPDOs. We are
therefore conducting a thorough review of this matter.”

Credit ratings are hugely important within the financial system because many
investors - such as pension funds, insurance companies and banks - use them as
a yardstick either to restrict the kinds of products they buy, or to decide how
much capital they need to hold against them.

The world’s other major credit agency, Standard and Poor’s, was the first to
award triple A status to CPDOs but many investors require ratings from two
agencies before they invest so the Moody’s involvement supplied that crucial
second rating.

S&P stood by its ratings, saying: “Our model for rating CPDOs was developed
independently and, like our other ratings models, was made widely available to
the market. We continue to closely monitor the performance of these securities
in light of the extreme volatility in CDS prices and may make further
adjustments to our assumptions and rating opinions if we think that is
appropriate.”

( I heard about this on NPR today. The commentator implied that that Moodys
knew about the error for about a year before they adjusted their ratings. )

LTUS - The quarterly report was not that good, so the stock tanked. It has the
lowest margins out of three Chinese pharma producers and distributors I own
(AOB, CHME, LTUS). Income before unrealized currency translation gain is not
impressive. As all Chinese pharma distributors, they have tremendous accounts
receivable + inventory that compose pretty much all their equity. There was a
reduction of some revenue from the third parties which can be viewed negatively
(since its a reduction) or positively (since it's non core revenue and part of
it was leasing parts of company property, which is now possibly used for core
operations). Also cash flow was negative. On the other hand, this was Q1, which
is seasonally weak for Chinese companies. I think LTUS has much brighter

itself of its oil assets, does a reverse merger and becomes a dotcome of sorts.
Crazy market that it was they pumped that stock up to around 13 bucks but I
sold 8k at around $8.50 and held on to 2k shares and watched it continue to
rocket up to $13.00.

Then it turned and began to come back down. Well, one morning when I was
looking over my accounts I found 7500 shares of the stock I purchased in a
small cash trading account and 2500 shares in one of my IRAs ....THAT I FORGOT
I HAD PURCHASED (@ .22 2 with the other shares) The stock just happened to be
around $8.50 that morning so I unloaded those 10k shares and held onto the 2k
shares for awhile longer. When the stock hit $7.37 I dumped the last 2k shares.

This all happend over the course of maybe 5 or 6 weeks.

Hope I didnt already tell this story here when babbling about penny stocks.

Lazarus. Penny stocks. From my limited experience (losses), I have the feeling
that the occasional outsize gain (such as your current 20-50 bagger with
HNTM.ob) is necessary to make up for the wipeouts of so many of the others. And
of course, it's just the possibility and infrequency of such an outsize gain
that make the fishing in this pond so interesting.

GM at new 12-mo. low today. Actually, at a 26 year low.

Supplier strike ended, but it'll be costly for GM (lost production). In this
recession-environment, it will continue to be very difficult to sell new cars
of course. GM burning through cash, according to WSJ article.

I can afford a small bet that GM might not go bk and might actually stabilize
(the stock price) if management can rationalize the business and/or continue
getting good reviews (and sales) from some of their new cars/trucks.

I added just a little to my few shares today.

Royal Cruise Lines at 12-mo. low.

Possibly a combination of people postponing discretionary purchases, and the
higher cost of fuel adding to http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=RCL 's costs.

I say demand will still be there. Maybe many USA citizens won't be able or
willing to travel now. Eventually though, there will be enough - retired USA
people, emerging brix middle classes.

As for fuel, assuming there's some sort of adequate supply at some equilibrium
price, then imo, people will get used to "expensive" oil/gas. For now,
RCL/CCL's idea of adding a daily fuel surcharge per person doesn't seem to be
so onerous when one considers the total $ cost of the cruise vs. the benefit
one gets. (Now getting to/from the ships -- airline travel and its costs --
that may be an issue.)

Anyway, at RCL's current p/bk and p/sales --- those numbers are relatively low.
I added a few more shares to my position today, and continue to bet on the
stock's eventual reversion-to-mean.

NS - bought yet another MLP. NS is a spinoff from VLO and owns refined products
and crude pipelines as well as terminals. Most revenue is fee based (80%)
income without commodity sensitivity. Recently they purchased some Asphalt
refineries from Citgo as well as terminal assets but those are only 20% of the
assets. Last earnings seemed looked good with plenty of coverage for the
distribution.

Generally speaking I like the pipelines for their distribution yield and
growth. Oil pipelines and terminals are generating fee income that is indexed
to inflation (the real inflation not the core inflation) which is approx. 5%.
That guarantees moderately higher revenues and income even without
acquisitions.

I'm with you on RCL Paul, although I've only "rented" the shares a few times
this year for some ST trades which, fortunately, were positive. Don't own or
"rent" currently.

A couple things about oil/gas: the surcharges only make up for a small portion
of the additional costs to the cruise lines, so there still will be margin
pressure there. I'm sure all the lines are trying to find ways to conserve. For
instance, I noticed for our cruise later this year, we will have one less hour
in one port than in our original itinerary...my take on this is that the line
(RCL) will have one more hour of sailing time, meaning the ship can sail at a
slower speed and consume less fuel.
The overall economic malaise can't help the cruise lines as they compete for
discretionary vacation $$$$$. The dollar's weakness may be helpful, in that
cruises become more attractive for the non-US population, and US based lines
can market European destinations to US passengers as denominated in USD (of
course, pax still have to get over there, and pay in foreign currency when over
there).
IMO, RCL is the most innovative in the industry. The immense (5400 pax!)
Genesis class ships have some incredible features. However, if the economic
problems continue in the US, RCL may have problems filling up its ships at a
desirable price point, especially with this new capacity coming on line.

NSRGY. Nestle has been a very good "mom" stock since Spekulatus first started
talking about it here (July '03).

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=19110144&srchtxt=nsrgy

I bought a few shares; in retrospect shoulda bought more and for my "mom
account"

---
An ideal "mom stock". as I see it, is something you or your parents buy for
their account where, when you are recommending/suggesting it, you don't have to
explain what the company does or its product; the possibility is small that you
will have to have to apologize to your parents if you screw up - the biggest
screwup maybe being you/she/they paid a little too high for the stock (which is
forgotten about as the company grows and stock price increases over several
years); your mom has heard of the business or product or used the product and
likely knows the name of the company that provides the service or makes the
item. The company likely provides a dividend (that grows), so there's some cash
coming into the account. It's a stock that one buys and puts away, doesn't have
to review frequently, doesn't much worry about if it fluctuates. (Your parent
doesn't keep calling you to explain what the heck happened to their stock (in
market decline) and what should they - you- do now about it.)

Some stocks in my mom account are http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=IBM (Please
recognize the generation of my mom and me -- IBM being the well-known stock of
the 1940's, esp. 1950's and 1960's), Albertson's (became SuperValue

The Brothers have done quite well with their grocery stores (Mom's

Trader Joe's was founded by Joe Coulombe and is currently owned by a family
trust set up by German billionaire Theo Albrecht, one of the two brothers

privately held.

I have long term positions in SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU) and Tesco.

Maybe Warren Buffet is talking to the Albrecht brothers about acquiring their

be a good way for them to sell off their ownership and keep their same

Madherry,

Interesting strategy. Can I ask which bond fund does that?

I took a hit with Citi this year but got out before it went to its current
price. However, I doubled my position which is now reasonable size in WFC.
Apparently a mistake as it has declined from just over $30 buy price
reasonably. I'm thinking it may be prudent to pare that position back now.

Financials are tough. I wonder why Buffett or his surrogate trust WFC as
opposed to others; is it based on some insight we don't have publicly? I know
in So Cal they are not free from being in the position of other banks -- though
I suppose to lesser extent, with the repos.

Positions in stocks like APA and XOM, CAT have held the port together but I"m
also thinking that a fair amount of the $130+ price /bbl of crude is due to
speculation rather than real fundamentals - not to mention other commodities.
But when does that bubble burst?

I think its a tough environment as I see stagflation coming on stronger. As you
mention, rates may have to start going up, growth more sanguine worldwide, and
global inflation perhaps in the 5% range. Tough environment to eek out any real
returns...costs for items such as power plants increasing near double digits
over the past five years! *

I continue to find Gross and his counterparts writing of the monthly investment
outlooks to be insightful.

The WSJ front page article from today on Bear's collapse amazing. More pain to
be endured as there are still reasonable disconnects out there. i.e. Chinese
currency.

thanks for posting those informative links. of course this is just reinforcing
my own beliefs. its evident that part of the rush toward commodity investing is
to protect investors from the debasement of the US dollar.
Investors/speculators should be free to maintain their wealth in any asset they
choose. It has prompted me to invest/speculate in oil/natural gas , mining, and
real estate companies. Why should anyone keep their money in treasuries and
earn negative real interest rate returns?

The inverse bond fund I have chosen is TBT a fairly new etf, but there are
others out there. I just dont have names at my fingertips. Let me know which
one you decide on, just check the expense ratios before you buy in as some of
them were surprisingly high. I currently have about 4% of my portfolio in it.

I am wary of financials unless there is a solid moat and you have a good handle
on the likely future charge offs. I dont see why WFC would be immune to the
problemes facing other large banks. But then again I dont have the same access
to senior management that Buffett has, perhaps they are unusually smart
bankers.

There will be endless debate on how much speculation is priced into 130 dollar
oil. The latest report from US Energy Dept. adds some twists to the story,
including the suggestion that tremendous demand for oil in the Middle East is
cutting the amount they are exporting. Below is an excerpt.

Fresh data from the U.S. Department of Energy show the amount of petroleum
products shipped by the world's top oil exporters fell 2.5% last year, despite
a 57% increase in prices, a trend that appears to be holding true this year as
well.

There are several reasons behind the net-export decline. Soaring profits from
high-price crude have fueled a boom in oil demand in Saudi Arabia and across
the Middle East, leaving less oil for export. At the same time, aging fields
and sluggish investments have caused exports to drop significantly in Mexico,
Norway and, most recently, Russia. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries also cut production early last year and didn't move to boost supplies
again until last fall.

In all, according to the Energy Department figures, net exports by the world's
top 15 suppliers, which account for 45% of all production, fell by nearly a
million barrels to 38.7 million barrels a day last year. The drop would have
been steeper if not for heightened output in less-developed countries such as
Angola and Libya, whose economies have yet to become big energy consumers.

good links. but i do not understand it when (in the masters link) he says
"speculators have stockpiled (via the futures market)the equivalent of 1.1
billion barrels of oil."

i have always thought that buyers of futures commodities could have little
effect because they never take delivery. (except for the airlines and others
when hedging fuel costs, in a sense.) so i always thought that i did not
understand something. they may hold a contract for awhile, but they eventually
close the position (and open another).

but then, recently... i cannot find the link or quote, but even warren buffet
agreed with me recently by saying that the hedge funds(?) have little effect on
corn or other commodity prices because they do not stockpile commodities, as
far as he knows.

why in the world should we fill the strategic oil reserve when all the country

Hi gcrispin - I did not realize there were such large dollar oil subsidies
provided by the governments of both China and India that continue to fuel
domestic demand. Until they let their domestic oil price rise with demand,
prices will probably stay at the current levels or even move higher.

Despite expense, oil-producing countries keep subsidies in place
http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/15/business/oil.php
From the article:..."That is bad news for oil consumers in the rest of the
world, who face record crude costs partly as a result of demand growing
unchecked in countries where pump prices have barely risen since mid-2006 -
when crude was about $70 a barrel...." .

=================================================================

I guess these countries figure it is worth using their extra (devalued) $US
reserves to pay for these oil subsidies. This policy allows them to continue to
grow their GDP and keep their population happy.

I totally agree that the only way for oil demand (and price) to drop is for the
oil producing countries to stop their subsidies. Most likely not going to
happen though.

I am firmly in Peak Oil camp and I don't think oil price is high due to
speculation. I am not sure about other commodities, so I mostly avoid them.
Even with oil, I have sold some of my positions that I believe to be fairly
valued to overvalued. I still remain strongly weighed towards oil/gas though.
IMHO, any oil price pullback to <$100 should be used to accumulate.

Eventually, we should survive peak oil and diminish its need. I don't see that
happening in 5 years. 10-15 years - maybe, 20-25 years - pretty certain (that's
why Buffett or Munger said something like that oil will not be very important
in 25 years). But I think there is a lot of oil money still on the table until
then.

Looks like I picked the wrong day for my SIL purchase:

This yahoo post doesn't have any validity does it? (the 10Q showed 1.6 million
cash flow from operations last quarter which probably justifies an EV of less
than 60 million whereas the actual EV was about $1 billion). Oh well: That's
what I get for assuming a yahoo post might be valid.

SIL made 50 million real cash income last quarter if you exclude the non-cash
mark-to-market derivative loss. The current market cap is only around 500
million. San Cristobal has at least 16 years of mine life. Roughly speaking,
you only need 500 million to buy a piece of asset that gives you 200 million
per year for 16 years. Is this the deal of the century or what? >>>

Thank you so very much for the kind words Paul Senior! I'm just honored to be
able to throw my two cents in on some things via a high quality thread such as
the Value Investing board....and of course my other source of quality info the
Crossy thread.

CLR was one of those situations where it was in the high 20's low 30's and kept
popping up on IBD's stocks on the move screen. It's funny b/c usually the ones
with 3 handles end up with 5 handles before folks catch on. And this was just
the case as Cramer had a segment on one of his screw-ups and it was CLR. The
screw up? Not recommending it. He's an IBD subscriber and he saw it day in and
day out, but he balked on it because he knows the momentum type that uses IBD
and I guess he truly doesn't want to burn his viewers. He went on to highlight
the Bakken portion of this one and the rest is history.

My question for you and those here looking at this situation is this: Who makes
the frac sleeves used in the horizontal drilling? Would seem to me that it
would be some small service company that was overlooked. Perhaps not. Don't
know enough to comment. I guess I need to call CLR to see where they get there
frac sleeves from.

** Got into a conversation with the owner of some private ag equipment
manufacturer (Klusmeier) on the docks in Palm Beach. He was tipsy so I didn't
get to pick his brain on the sector very much, but he sure as hell asked me a
million questions. When I told him about the move in little Art's Way he said
"what do you know of ARTW?" He proceded to tell me about their one big holder
(which I know about)...and then he asked me "do you know why it ran like that?"
To which I said, "yes. the quants piled into it because it was the laggard that
hadn't run yet in a hot sector." He blinked and said, "yes you are right (in a
southern croatian accent.)" He said to sell it...for what that's worth....i
guess we'll see another huge candle down at some point....it does look like
it's topped out. Volume is paper thin on that one.

After that all he wanted to talk about was wind. Cramer did a wind show the
other day which was the day after my conversation with this guy about it. Good
timing I guess. All the big money is talking about and doing the wind
investment. One of my favorite Jeff Gendell holdings was TWRT.ob....now
BWEN.ob......but it has run substantially. However, to hear Cramer talk as soon
as they uplist to the nasdaq it could double again. My other Gendell play that
was not mentioned by Cramer in his "wind-ex" is Miscor MIGL.ob ( a service
company for scrap,rail,and now wind.) It did a 1 for 20 reverse split months
back and finally is moving with furry. Just checked the settlement as I'm
typing this and it was up almost 10% today. So the mention of BWEN.ob by Cramer
probably got folks digging in on Gendell's holdings seeing as he owns a boat
load of TRN as well.

Anyway, curious to hear your thoughts on and some holdings of yours in this
sector.

Best Regards - JT

** When I originally wrote about the solar sector and ag sectors over at
Crossy's they gave me the same gut feeling wind is giving me now. The chatter
is starting to get very loud about it now and while it makes me feel that it's
getting toppy......it's probably just getting ready to go parabolic.

RE SIL This is a brand new mine and they are still working out the kinks in it.
I believe the price continues to be surpressed because Bolivia's current leader
is tied to Chavez, he is continuing to advocate reforms detrimental to private
business, and there is the threat of secession of various provinces bringing
with it the likelihood of headline grabbing violence at some point. The last
time I ran my numbers based on the companies projections and current metal
prices I came up with a target price of $26, the previous time I did it I came
up with $40. these numbers dont take into account country risk. I just dont
want to put any more money into Bolivia, and Im sure that is a sentiment shared
by many investors. Im holding what I got which is plenty unfortunately.

I also agree that energy market looks like a good place to be for quite a few
years, even if the US has a prolonged recession.

Peak oil has been well documented for the supply side. But the demand side
looks equally explosive when looking at the chart of per cap energy consumption
by country.

US energy consumption per barrels of oil equivalent per country shows US at
68.81, near the top. China at 4.96; India at 2.18.
See chart more than half way down this article
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum

Considering those two countries represent more than a third of the world's
population and their economic development is in high gear, that's a huge shift
in the demand curve!

Oil, coal, gas, nuclear, alternative energy -- would like to know the very best
choices in each. Spek may be on the right track going after pipes.

Hi Paul - I have been researching different emerging energy technologies that
may provide the disruptive change needed to extend the peek oil time line. One
company located here in Silicon Valley is Solazyme. They are developing a
process to produce bio-diesel from a genetically modified algae. Their
prototype algae has a super efficient and fast metabolic rate that produce huge
amounts of lipids in both the light and dark.

http://www.solazyme.com/about.shtml

Here is a recent article on Solazyme
http://www.siliconvalley.com/ci_8479963?nclick_check=1

From the article:"... Microscopic, single-celled algae have been around for
billions of years. The simplest of plants, they are quite efficient at
converting light, water and carbon into oily compounds called lipids that can
be extracted and processed into diesel fuel, gasoline, crude oil, even salad
dressings and skin creams...."

==============================================================

The value proposition is to spread some seed money into a few of these new
emerging technologies that become very profitable with diesel at over
$5.00/gallon. The article states that they are working on a system that
produces diesel for less than $2.00/gallon. These companies could eventually
become buy out candidates from several of the older legacy companies (oil and
AG) when they are able to deliver such a system.

The take away for me with using a genetically engineered algae that produces
biofuel is that it can be done locally w/o high tech equipment and at the
margin could supply much of the local demand for diesel in many of the
developing countries (like China and India). Local production facilities
provides local jobs and is environmentally friendly with a neutral carbon foot
print. Solazyme (and many other start ups) could be the Monsanto of algae bio
fuel production.

Lazarus, here's an update on some of my penny stocks:

SHMT. Supplier to oil/gas industry. They have a new valve type they have hopes
for. Imo, it's a mom/pop machine shop that should never have gone public.
...And whose stock I never should have bought -g-.

SUTM. A newspaper chain, Chicago centered. Community newspapers -- there still
might be readers and advertisers for these.

BMD. (This one was once popular on the Big Dog oil/gas stock thread.) They have
"a planned quarry expansion and quicklime and cement plant located within the
Athabasca mineral property, approximately 60 km north of the city of Fort
McMurray." Apparently there is or will be a demand for BMD's minerals by the
oil/gas exploration companies as these companies build their infrastructures.
Meanwhile however, BMD might not have enough cash or financial wherewithal to
last as a going concern.

HORT. Once a well-known, maybe respected, wholesale supplier of plants. I bet
on the stock reverting-to-mean, and I've lost.

CMNZF. A gold miner if they can use their new financing properly. Don't know
why I bought this in 2006, but I've kept it. Just a few shares though. Whew!
Down about 87%. Doesn't pay to sell it for the few dollars I have in it. At
about 18-20 cents a share, I'm adding a few shares for a few dollars only.
http://www.centurymining.com/index.aspx

YBTVA. TV stations. This one a big loser for me.

LENX, HDLM. Other losers I am holding.

DAGM. Has cash. Announced stock buy-back. Company has been mentioned here
before. This one might be okay at current price. (or not)

Thanks EKS. I'll try again later, but was not able to access the article on
Solazyme. I was interested in reading how the technology might supply much of
the local demand in developing countries.

At times I feel a bit overwhelmed trying to evaluate the energy alternatives.
Solar power has had a good run, but I'm kind of late to the party and I've read
somewhere that the number of photovoltaic cells are going to be in huge
oversupply in the next 18 months or so.

In wind energy, I really don't know the biggest players, but understand that GE
has a large backlog of orders for wind turbines.

Corn-based ethanol appears to be a politically motivated con because several
studies suggest there is a net loss in energy in producing the stuff. Brazil's
sugar-cane based ethanol may have more favorable economic payoff.

Thermal energy that taps the earth's core sounds interesting too.

And harnessing the tides is also underway. Saw an article the other day about
Irving Oil in Canada's maritime provinces ready to pilot a project tapping into
the Minas Basin in New Brunswick (world's highest tides).

I cant help but feel that the alternative energy/solar space is a little bit

I looked at vestas and others 3 years ago and they were unprofitable or
private, and not a value play at all. Of course, the stock of vestas has gone
up 10x since then.

Yep. I went thru all this 3 years ago, and bought mainly oil sands, railroads,
and a few others (BNI before WB).
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=21362913
(PS - I ended up with energy 45% of my total stock portfolio, or 75% of
portfolio if dividend stocks excluded. A very overweight but lucky move.)
Sector picking is more important than stock picking.

>Solar power has had a good run, but I'm kind of late to the party
I recently started positions with 2 solar companies STP and TSL. I think that a
few from this list have reasonable forward PEs. There are many others that I
have not listed, I am sure.

I think you bring up a good point. I've stayed away from the solar space for
that reason. But "alternative energy" is a term for a big tent and I think some
of the best plays are international because countries that need resources and
have yet to have an established infrastructure will be willing to try something
new. I bought GU a couple of months after the IPO and don't think it is
unreasonably priced based on its growth rate.

Boone Pickens has made a strong case for the use of natural gas in
transportation, but I'm not sure if anybody is listening in the US.

NGV Global is a good site to get a feel for what is going on internationally.

Overseas, that is a different matter. Chang has been mentioned here before and
I own a large position. I also bought SNEN this week. These are speculative
companies that currently profitable with reasonable PEs and are positioned for
future growth.

In my opinion, AXP and HOG are one of the greatest value (and Buffett) stories

I have pretty large positions of both and will continue accumulating if they

The only problem with this editorial is that adding gas taxes to discourage
people from driving gas-guzzlers makes the government addicted to the "free"
money they get. And then you end up in a situation like Europe, where people
pay $8-10 dollars per gallon, there is no way for them to "save" as much as USA
could by switching to economy cars cause they already switched and the
government cannot ween itself of the oil taxes cause the budgets would
collapse.

Sure, energy policy is needed. But it's not as easy as some journalist schmuck

Certainly it is a complicated subject, but I don't view Friedman as just a

books and have come to that conclusion.

Unfortunately, as a country we're addicted to foreign capital to cover our
deficits. So, perhaps, owning up to the "cost" of oil would be beneficial.

Personally IMO, solar area is way too momentum driven right now. The only
positive I see in solar is that perhaps it does not require multibillion build
outs like nuclear or even new gas/coal/tar sands/etc. initiatives (both E&P,
refining/CTL and power plants). If solar can become economic on small scale
where homeowners/farmers/whoever can install panels and get off the grid, then
it will be huge. Especially if it gets to developing countries price point. I
was in Cambodia last year and a lot of electricity for poor people is based on
guys charging car batteries and then using them for light/TV/radio, etc. If
this can be replaced by cheap solar, it would be huge and also remove some need
of diesel/oil.

So solar could be viable. Still not much to invest into without high risk.
Unless one wants to buy CRDN. ;) (I still have a large position in that).

I may need to buy GE. It really has hands in a lot of pots. The only problem is
that it's also so very big.

Agreed on natural gas - Eastern Europe and Lat America have quite a lot of nat
gas powered cars. Like the article says, the problem in USA is the
chicken-and-egg situation with infrastructure and car availability. A lot of
Eastern European and Lat American cars are actually used-car post-factory
remodels to use nat gas, which would not be allowed in a country like USA
(safety and quality issues). Infrastructure varies, but in some places people
go 10 miles out of their routes to fill up. But then the savings are worth it
perhaps. :)

But then with all the gas-guzzling in USA, there are still much simpler ways to
save and conserve. Much harder in Europe where most cars are already small and
efficient.

The market is already providing the results that Friedman wants the gov't to

for Priuses. Price controls via a "floor price" for gas? Come on, comrade Tom,
