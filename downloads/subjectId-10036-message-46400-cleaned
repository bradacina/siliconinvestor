Paul - I was not born in the early 70ies, so cannot comment on articles back
then:) However, if you are looking at value plays, its imp. to look at cash
flow of the firm. Sometimes its a great indicator of where the company might
end up trading down the line. An FCF in addtion to few other things can also be
an indicator of impending M&A, buybacks, special divs.

However, I do agree that I don;t always believe in yahoo numbers. I calculate
them myself and it is only "one part" of my analysis.

>>Are you telling me, its hard to stand up, when you have an investment
philosophy which is believes in " value investments with catalysts"?<<

I believe this is what most hedge fund managers are doing, so it's hard to
stand out with that headline on the resume. Some hedge fund managers like
Einhorn and Ackman provide their own catalysts, others are betting on certain
events. Most of them have some momo- component in their magic soup (trend
following).

I am not saying that what you are doing is not good, you track record seems OK,
although i would more emphasize the methodology than your track record because
it's easy to fudge the latter and much of it can be luck or omission of
mistakes (survivor Bias).

I personally found the emphasis on catalysts too restricting. For one thing a
catalyst is often implicit a bet on a certain even. If widely know, the
catalyst may already build in the stock price, so if you are wrong, the bet
could get expensive.

My best investment have been those where i found stocks to be neglected rather
than controversial. This is stuff like 5018.T, NWLI, 5988.T, CMB.MI or tiny
little community banks in the US. With these stocks, there are no hedge fund
involved (or they are selling NWLI-3rd Ave), no research or institutional
coverage like with the Japanese stocks I hold. They don't have any catalyst but
they still work on aggregate because they are just too darn cheap.

"...if you are looking at value plays, its imp. to look at cash flow of the

As I say, for me, I've only been rarely impressed with cash flows when I've
looked at value plays. Cash flow hasn't been a significant factor for me in my
determination of whether I'll make a buy or sell of a value stock. But that is
me and the way I operate.

What exactly is it that you are looking at, and comparing/calculating when you
"look at cash flow of the firm? Is it DCF? Free cash flow as a percent of
something? Are you commenting on cash flows for the stocks you write-up? (I
can't remember.)

Clown - I am sorry - but " all fund managers" are not doing that. And I happen
to personally know one of the two names you just mentioned. I cannot say which.
I don;t want to throw names and sound cocky, however, i met a one on one with a
certain fund manager few weeks ago( not one of the two you mentioned here) who
manages north of USD 30B. And even he is using the same valuation methods and
philosophy that i follow. There is always lot of learn for me, however for you,
i would suggest not don't discount something when it seems that you don;t
completely have an understanding about it. I am also not looking to put my
philosophy on my resume. My ideas will speak for themselves.

Your comments are only focused on the "catalyst" part, which is all event and
not the "value" part that i talk about. Even buffett had the same philosophy as
mine in the early years and i can tell you number of successful fund managers
who do the same. Although there are lot of morons running money out there, so i
can completely understand what you are saying.

I agree that neglected investments are great plays, however, they need to be
"value" names. Just bcs they are neglected does not mean they have value.
Moreover, " Cheap" is a very relative term, so u don;t want to throw it around.

And for my "OK" record - I appreciate your comments, however, the best managers
have done annual 15% - 20% over a 10-15yr period. So you can judge my record on
your own which is on my blog. However, you are correct that there is always
some bias in it and i will be careful about that going forward. I still have a
lot to prove..

Don;t take what I have written personally. I always appreciate a good
discussion and being proven wrong. Thank you.

Paul - don;t get me wrong. I don;t look at FCF to make buy/sell decisions. When
i look at Cash flows, they are in addition to lot of other things.

CF tells me the health of the company, their liquidity position and then i put
that in context of the business model the firm has and how much it burns. This
is one of the few things I will use to cross check comments management makes in
their calls to figure out, if they are honest or bullshitting....

CF position is a good indicator of a firm's health, health of their business
and as a shareholder gives me an added comfort in investing in the stock.

Clownbuck -

You stated:"...My best investment have been those where i found stocks to be
neglected rather than controversial. ...".

I might also add, my best ones were also those where other investors threw in
the towel, were at or near multi year lows and the trading volume dried up
after some previous event (like earnings warnings or company specific issue).

Halliburton comes to mind where I bought a bunch of shares after their asbestos
lawsuit issues. A lot of investors declared them dead and/or bankrupt but the
company still had a lot of value, especially some of their subsidiary companies
outside the reach of the circling lawyers.

So yes, neglected and boring stocks sometimes make the best value buys.

On the flip side, those "story" stocks always seem to lose money for me. I stay
in them too long, or the story never develops as originally told.

P.S. still holding MGDDY? I am looking to a $16.00/share target price. The

Nik, I also look for possible catalysts that will drive the stock, just as I
look for potential pitfalls. Why look for one and not the other? I think
Clownbuck is correct in stating that it could be that a catalyst is already
priced into the stock and it is also possible that if the catalyst comes into
fruition, it might not drive up the price at all. But perhaps he is not aware
that he too is looking at catalysts.

It's important to define what a catalyst is. There have been several ideas
discussed on this thread that I think are catalysts. Examples include pending
litigation, price of components or agricultural products, change in competitive
landscape or change in financial moat or even regression to mean, to name a
few.

Keeping it brief.....We all look at catalysts just like you do.

 Heresay is that Sony has the best camera sensors on the market, at least for

way. .... Based on what I know, OVTI is not necessarily a riskless buy, imo

Absolutely. The point is in trying to figure it out ahead of time. its not that
simple to define. As for "potential pitfalls. ", thats also a catalyst.
Catalysts are not something that will only drive the stock up. For example -
leverage can be a potential catalyst for a company to file for chap 11 or be
short at. It of course should be looked at in addition to the fundamentals.

For example - TYL -->I wrote about their JV with MSFT in Oct-2010 in addition
to some other fundamental drivers and valuation. Stock was around $19. Things
came together they way I saw it and they announced the JV in a conference in
Feb/March of 2011.

" It was in their SEC filings" - Should have been priced in? Look where the
stock trades now - its almost around $ 34. On ofthe other hand, you can invest
in MSFT and its been flat for almost 11yrs, give and take, except the
dividends.

Therefore i spoke about " value with catalysts". Its very important to
understand that i am not just talking about catalysts.

And as i said, please , no one should take what I write personally. I love
these discussions and I get really great reads on this threads and learn a lot
in the process. HOWEVER, no one should discount something without having a
complete understanding of it.

I think that one could easily make the case that this is an excellent time to
buy certain stocks. Whether or not greek defaults it seems to me that the
european powers that be as well as the fed reserve and treasury have no choice
but to support the euro and the european banks who have big investments in
other euro debt like spain portugal and italy. frankly i am more worried about
spain that greece. If my thesis is correct this is very bullish for dollar
denominated domestic assets, and hard asset plays.

for those of you who think dollar t bonds at 1.8% are a great investment, I
just read or heard that american airlines is walking away from ite pension
obligations, which will leave the Pension Guaranty Corp with another $10
billion to fund. That Government insititution is already underfunded by some
$26 Billion. On the other hand there megacaps with free cash flow in the 8-14 %
range according to some fund managers. One would think that money has to flow
back shareholders eventually in one form or another. You can buy MPW now and
get a payout of just under 8% after their announcement that they were issuing
more shares. They have nothing to do with Greece or Euros. and domestic
mortgage reits like CIM and NLY have much higher returns.

The concern that I have is that the United States is really in a big decline in
terms of employment opportunities. Yes the creativity and design capability is
is there but if we look at the Apple model, they employ a heck of a lot more
people in china than they do in the United States. What are all those kids in
college and graduating from college going to do? It seems like so much more of
a winner take all game now. which to me means is less and less likely that the
US will ever be able to get their own finances under control.

Jim Clarke. Just to recap and inject my opinion. Some people believe Jim Clarke
was among the best who ever posted here. If not the best. He was a Columbia MBA
grad with the Graham influence of that school He was a professional analyst
(the only such person to admit that on this thread at the time) who later
(after he left the thread) became a value fund manager and then for a while ran
his own money management firm. I suspect he had a great influence on the now
more well-known Mike Burry, who was starting out at the time (imo).

At one point, when RSH was about $12 or so, Jim was recommending it on his
money management firm's website in a video. And of course, not just saying buy
the thing-- it's cheap (like some posters here do), but giving his reasoning.
Well, the stock soon went to $18 or more ($20-$22?).

For me, I may have been stuck in my memory of past things, and years later I've
bought the stock as it fell -- it still looked okay to me on its numbers that I
look at. I don't know what Jim Clarke would say now--- he'd never publicly call
me an idiot (I hope he wouldn't) -- maybe he'd just say his analysis has or had
changed and it's not been a stock of interest for him now. ... Or maybe now at
current price it might be. ha.

=====================
Long as we're talking about the old days -- and there are several of us from
those days still here posting regularly -- people have had time to make up
their minds about the "worth" of the poster --- IF they're the types who rely
on the poster as much or more than the stock being talked about. (Maybe they
should NOT rely on any poster though.) Couple other guys from those days here
don't post much, and sometimes I feel people here don't give them the
acknowledgement or consideration they deserve for their past and/or current
picks when they do post. Grommit comes to my mind in this category as perhaps
being among the best "quiet" investors we have on the thread.

And not to slight anybody or boost anybody's ego, my opinion is that sometimes
we all invest where we seem to be able to do no wrong, and sometimes we're in a
slump where no matter what we do, it doesn't work, or works less well than what
somebody else is doing. (Just my opinion based on my experience.) In any case,
each stock ought to be evaluated on its merits to the buyer, not just bought
because someone who is considered "good" says he or she is buying it. Again,
all jmo.

I do miss Jim Clarke though.

MPW -- "You can buy MPW now and get a payout of just under 8% after their
announcement that they were issuing more shares."

I never did like their enigmatic statements in the past, when they said
something like "when fully invested we will earn $1 per share" or whatever. So
this time, they announced "Based solely on the portfolio as of December 31,
2011... the Company estimates that annualized Normalized FFO per share would
approximate $0.72 to $0.76 per diluted share." which is lower then the "fully
invested" amount that was always invested.

Then they announced an additional 19 cents from the acquisition. I cannot fine
the press release now, but it is mentioned in the cc: "we expect that
completion of the Ernest transactions will add approximately $0.19 per
share..." So we are back up to the $1 per share of FFO. Confusing.

Anyway. I also bought some extra MPW today to take advantage of a probable
short term price drop, and if not -- 8.2% yield. Sold more COR and DLR, which
have had a nice run.

AGL is selling above it's GN but it's difficult to calculate after their recent
merger. PE is at the high end so I sold my highest priced shares booking my
gain. Will keep this one on my BUY list after I have a few quarters of the
combined financials from the merger so I can evaluate the GN, PE and combined
BV.

MRK & PFE are selling near their 3 year highs. These are difficult to value
based on a GN approach since both companies have a lot of intangible assets
(primarily expiring patents and goodwill). MRK reported less revenues than
expected and is probably the most overvalued of the two. Both companies pay
solid dividends which are important to me but I think for now, to peel off 15%
positions, I can allocate the proceeds to better capital gain plays.

Took a speculative Buy yesterday in GMXRp since after the close their end of
year report was due w/ a presentation today. Both the common stock and
preferred shares were trading like there may be a liquidity issue or worse a
BK. They issued the preferred (about $50M) and sold common shares last year to
raise capital to buy more "oily" acreage and move their company from a NG based
company to more Oil producing company. Based on their presentation today, ALL
is still good. The common stock was up 64% and the preferred was up 53%.

Based on my metrics (P/S, EV/ EBITDA) BBY looks only about 30% more expensive
but is in a better competitive position. For one thing, I believe that BBY
wireless kiosks in malls and such are much better run and busier than RSH
stand-alone shops.

If I were to bet on a turnaround in the electronics sector, i would bet on BBY.
However, I wonder how you compete against a competitor like AMZN with lower
fixed cost who is also willing to sacrifice margins , plus has the advantage
that their customers for the most part don't pay VAT (adding 8.5% to BBY/RSH
sales prices in my case).

I think BBY may get a lift when AMZN has to pay VAT in CA,starting in 2013 (I
believe) but that is still a while todays fast money world. Even with that, the
other advantages that AMZN has may still allow them to beat BBY and then there
are of course other online electronics retailers like tigerdirect that may

more

New positions: SLT
Positions increased: PWRD, ADVC, MSFT, MOS, FRFHF

Flip-flop: GAME

New year so far started with risk-on stock movement up. It's not clear if
Greece and Europe will manage to ruin the party soon. I might start selling
some of the positions and raising some cash. However, so far I probably bought
more than I sold.

The big position change was GAME purchase to capture special $1.02 dividend. I
decided to keep most of my position after the dividend. I believe that after
SNDA goes private it's only a matter of time until GAME is taken private too.
With divvie cash gone into its parents coffers, the buyout is pretty likely.

I sold ENTR - lack of conviction, LTUS - one of the last crumbling Chinese
RTOs, PETS - not attractive valuation anymore and DLB - generous repricing of
management options. I practically sold IDCC keeping just a stub as they
announced termination of company sale auction. Overall I did well, selling most
of my IDCC at higher "buyout-on" prices.

I bought more PWRD during the Chinese blog scare. Added some ADVC, MOS, FRFHF
as well as MSFT at rising prices. IMHO, MSFT is still quite undervalued even at
$30.

I reentered SLT position. I sold my last position in SLT in late 2009 in $17-19
area. I missed the current sale at $6, but bought a starter position here.

Biggest error so far? Selling some PMGLF for tax losses in December. The stock

re Longleaf funds and Chesapeak. For every buyer there is a seller. These guys
have a 7.7% position as of 12/31/12, which is going to hurt. Concentrated funds
owning a loosing position may at some point sell out and then you get your CHK
really cheap.

CHK valuation metrics in terms of proved reserves are similar to BBG and UPL
which have none of the conflict of interest issues that CHK has, and are low
cost operators. The latter both have negative cash flows as well, but I think
their management will come to their senses much quicker than CHK's where Audrey
get's a cut of the cash flow for every well that CHK drills. Why would he stop?
It will work for him, NG prices and shares prices be dammed. Incentives rule

Canadian Tax & Foreign Taxes withheld generally

I try to buy all my Canadian companies in the IRA to avoid that withholding
tax. I have sort of given up on that in the taxable account and now consider
the overall position: the assets the company owns (some very nice Canadian Oil
assets), the relative dividend post 15% with holding, the long term capital
gain potential and the benefit of holding foreign assets (in non $US dollar
terms). The last item is an important consideration (for me) especially in
terms of how much debt the company has and on how their LT loans are paid pack
(paid back in U.S. dollars and/or some other basket of currency). Also, I look
at where their revenues are generated and what countries they are derived from
and in what currency.

Finally, I now find a larger benefit (for me) to itemize the tax with held
rather than filing the foreign tax credit forms. It's different every year but
seems to be a bigger benefit for me especially w/ my State (ie CA) tax forms.

I find having the foreign company mix in the taxable portfolio a bigger overall
benefit than having the foreign tax withholding. Some of my good Foreign
dividend payers that withhold include: AAUK, BHP, AGGPY, PVX, VALE, NSRGY,
COSWF, CSUWF, MGDDY, GGB,& MNHVF. Also since ERF & PWE are now corporations (w/
assets owned in the U.S.), they are still subject to the foreign tax with
holding.

Therefore, I give it some consideration but try to keep the IRA diversified w/o
having too many Canadian companies in that account.

ot: I'll have to ask my accountant this year about what you are saying:

"Finally, I now find a larger benefit (for me) to itemize the tax with held
rather than filing the foreign tax credit forms. It's different every year but
seems to be a bigger benefit for me especially w/ my State (ie CA) tax forms."

I have assumed a credit to taxes is always more favorable to me than to itemize
that withholding amount. However, I see that in my case where I have have had
more than $1000 in Canadian taxes withheld each year, I've not been able to
deduct the full amount each year. Given my income (gross or taxable or adjusted
or something), the computer program lets me offset some withholding against
taxes, and the rest is carried over to the following year or years. Result is
I'm always showing a carryover. Whereas if I just itemized the entire withheld
amount, I might do better. I'll have to check.

With the Canadian tax law change, I've moved all my Canadian stocks in taxable
accounts to ira account. I still have monies withheld from other foreign stocks
which I keep my taxable accounts. For example French stocks. My broker says a
25% tax rate is correct for my French shares that are held in ira. OTOH, 15%
would be the rate the rate for French shares that are held in a taxable
account. So I moved stocks like TOT to a taxable account.

OT - It's the high California income & sales tax rates that get me going. It's
now 10% income (minimum rate) and 10% sales tax in my area. However, I guess
that is pretty good when you look at Italy and their 25% VAT.

So, I continually ask myself, am I getting my full "Value" staying in CA w/ all
of these taxes or might I be better off in the snow and/or rain in a low tax
State? I always come around to the answer being "Yes" because of the nice
weather here (Silicon Valley).

Had a wonderful walk in the mountains near the ocean yesterday w/ my dog. It

According to Turbo Tax, my State taxes (including sales taxes) are now more

Hi all, been a while since I posted but I've moved a large % of cash back into
the market over the past month or so and just wanted to drop some symbols for
those who are interested. These are positions I find interesting primarily from
a modified Greenblatt approach that ranks based on various Returns on Capital
measures and Valuation measures (standard Greenblatt magic formula approach),
as well as growth and some price momentum components. Anyhow, here' some of my
larger positions now.

NEU Newmarket (just dropped quite a bit due to earnings miss but positive conf.
call from mgmt looking forward). I think I may have mentioned on thread back
when I purchased it. It was a pretty bad earnings miss though.
LHCG LHC Group - home health - back into this one and another (AFAM) - the
sector was very depressed due to some questionable billing practices ,
congressional hearings, fines. In the end I think its still a low cost way to
treat people and I'm back in to both names now.
SNDK Sandisk - stepped in after recent pullback on earnings, but raised forward
guidance.
TEO - Argentine telecom with big dividend. Have had this one a while. probably
mentioned here a few times.
CLF - Cliff's natural resources. - cyclical iron ore / coal
TEF - Telefonica SA - Spanish telecom w/ latin america exposure also, large
dividend. just looked cheap.
CHL - China Mobile - still in this one. Nice dividend. It keeps hitting it's
head in the 51-53 range - hoping it'll finally move a bit higher.
AFAM - Almost Family - home health like mentioned above w/ LHC Grp.
EBAY -
DAR - Darling Int'l - grease recycling, biofuel
ASML - semi-equip - I probably mentioned this one here before also.
HITK - Hi-Tech Pharmacal - generics
BBL - BHP Billiton - diversified mining
and some smaller positions in a few small cap names in semi-equip, solar, ....

As I've probably mentioned my selections tend to come from stocks based
primarily on a screening and quantitative approach - but one I think produces
some companies likely of interest on this thread.

my biggest regret over past several months has been selling AAPL too soon. I
just can't stay in sync w/ it. On AAPL I should just be like many here and just
buy it and tuck it away.

To all,

Reading the WSJ today, I was struck by a new financial metric, which is used by
private equity and a favorite of Blackstone - economic net income, which
includes unrealized gains and employee compensation. For example, Blackstone
posted a net accounting loss of $269 million for 2011, but it's economic net
income was $1.39 billion. It seems that economic net income has become a
popular metric since the New Jersey Division of Investment invested $1.8
billion with the company.

Under FAS 157, private equity investments are mostly level 3, thus it's up to
management's discretion to come up with fair value for them and the auditors to
sign off as reasonable.

If this metric were to become even more popular, how long would it take for us
to hear about economic net loss?

HI Madharry,

FWIW (and the typical disclaimer of being wrong many times likely applies) I
think ATPG is more risky to (naked) short then it is to (naked) long. If they
can complete there current project by early 2Q (I believe their recent release
was estimating a q1 completion) at 7000 BOE/d which would get their total
production to around 31,000 BOE/d I think the current stock-holders will do
very well. If they can't I think they may still have some options
(restructure-debt and maintain shareholder interest). I have bought a little
ATPGP recently (and paid for a significant portion by taking a loss in atpg) so
I can't say I am not scared (but sometimes it pays to embrace the fear, and
keep positions to a manageable size). We shall see! Probably either short or
long is not a bad idea here, just watch the news closely and cover your
position if the news is unfavorable for your position.

Big if. They have not completed anything since I am watching the stock, if

Thanks for the thoughts. I'm not so much interested in finding a risk free way

possible) although when all is said and done I might very well wish that this

long or short ATPG, or ATPGP as I think the ultimate outcome is too uncertain.
If someone has an opinion that ATPG will or will not successfully complete this
MC well, I think it makes for an interesting speculation (either long or short
depending on how you think it plays out), but certainly not without significant
risk. Best Regards, A51

Sorry I don't have good sources about ship supply right now. I studied this
more about 2 years ago and it was clear to me that even if trade growth by
moderate amounts, the supply of new ships will be larger than what is needed to
negate ships being scrapped and the capacity needed for move increased trade
(unless you assumed that trade volume would explode). Permabears often use the
Baltic index to point out that global trade falters, but like all free markets,
the freight prices are a function of supply and demand, so low prices mean that
supply meets demand at the current low prices and nothing else.

It is really a similar situation that the current NG glut and the low NG prices
that come with it; which is not a sign of demand faltering, but caused by
increased supply from shale gas.

Hi Madharry,

There is some information on atpgp here including a link to the prospectus
http://www.quantumonline.com/search.cfm?tickersymbol=ATPGP&sopt=symbol
I think it is a high risk/ high reward proposition and I am not highly
confident that I will get a positive return on my investment. Seems a typical
preferred issue to me (senior to the common, but junior to the bonds).

If things turn from bad to worse for ATPG and they can't make the May bond
payments, I may look to pick up some bonds on the cheap,
http://www.whopperinvestments.com/opened-a-position-in-atpg-bonds-analysis .
For now I will keep my ATPG investment on the small side. But if news comes out
on the new well and I can still buy the preferred at a reasonable price I
likely shall; If bad news comes out and I can buy some bonds on the cheap I
will likely consider such).

Robohogs, okay, but you guys please remember this is a value thread, mostly in
the Ben Graham tradition. So as moderator I get to assume and say, discussion
of specific shorts and options plays are off-topic here.

Can you give us some of your value picks, if there are any available now in
your view?

(Not so obvious to others perhaps, but I'm interested-- having bought PCP based
somewhat on your analysis on SI at the time. The stock's more than doubled; I'm
still holding most shares.)

OK here is a value play - ksws. I was going to post about this one last week
but had some personal laptop problems. this one is selling less than ncav.
Sales have falling sharply in the past couple of years but gross profit margins
have remained healthy which is good if revenue start to increase. Sales have
picked up in the last few quarters which could be a sign of a turn around.
Another issue I have them is that the CEO owns a bunch of shares and has not
brought stability to sales. Warren Buffett tried to buy this company in the
90's but this same ceo refused because he did not like the offer.

I wanted to buy when it was in the range of 3.52-3.64 last week. Since it
trades on low volume I will wait for a pull back because any big buys/sells
will increase/decrease the price dramatically.

Hi Rob,

You can used the BMAP function in Bloomberg if you have access to it. We use it
at work and it is pretty awesome. You can get the size of the tanker,
destination and origin with their current location on the map.

Let me know if you need help with it.

Hi Area,

I spoke to a friend of mine who works in shipping operations for a larger
tanker company and he explained to me that rates on most are high enough to
cover operating expenses. Where interest is concerned, most banks give shippers
a holiday on payments since it is better to allow the ship to run than take
possession and try to sell it in a depressed market which gives me hope there
is some support for continuing operating of ships.

As to your points about the dire supply situation, I think there might be glut
for a year or two but you're probably buying at the bottom. Companies' main aim
will be to conserve cash even if this means delaying or cancelling their orders
with the shipyards and paying a one off penalty.
