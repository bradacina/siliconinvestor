re:(PETD) "they do not materially benefit DIRECTLY from an increase in energy
prices".

That is the typical polemical trick of responding as if none of PETD revenues
come directly from ng prices when in fact, around 1/3 of their revenue is
currently from ng sales, and this figure is increasing.

Although, truth be told, they don't benefit at all from an increase in prices
because they have hedged at 2.95/MMbtu until March (ng closed at 2.57 today).

However, if long-lasting higher prices were in store...
If you really knew if higher prices were in store (and you never will), you
would buy a driller. At some point the drillers margin goes up and stays up
(because of sustained increased rig demand) and the explorers margin begins to
go down, although they'll still do well. The optimal time to buy the type of
company you are referring to is in the initial leg of an energy cycle, when the
cost of exploration is still very cheap.

"Even if "backwardization" reduces the benefits of hedging over time, the
benefits are usually still positive."

Even if a co. miraculously hedges 90% of production at the peak of oil prices,
market sentiment will turn against an E&P if oil corrects. Those hedges won't
last more than a few months - the market anticipates that and the share price
will correct right along with oil.

Cyclicals - look to buy Caterpillar tomorrow below 45 if they scare investors
on the conference call.

For those not scared of cyclicals, I would point out that Trinity Industries
(TRN) is one of my favorite companies (they're not the greatest company in the
world, but I just like them. Their executives are very good businessmen and
nice people). Railcars and barges mainly, along with a couple of other smaller
but pretty good businesses.

The railcar backlog is what the stock trades on, and that backlog is definitely
falling. Orders are soft, and probably getting softer. But the "backlog
falling" story is of the "no duh" variety. I don't think there is much downside
here. The company is by far the low cost producer in the industry - they will
be the last ones making money if things really get bad. The stock is trading at
book value, and at about 7 times earnings. They have a near perfect balance
sheet and free cash flow of about 11 or 12% of the share price. What people are
scared of is that earnings are likely to decline, and don't kid yourself - they
WILL decline. By how much is the question - they're earning about $4 now and
the stock trades at 25. The company bought back 10% of its shares in the last
year. There is absolutely no reason other than valuation for the stock to go
up, which is why nobody is buying it. Cyclical with declining earnings and no
near term catalyst - there is no price too low with today's "one day P&L"
mindset even among those who call themselves value investors. There are very
good reasons not to buy TRN if you have a 6 month time horizon, but I think its
something to take a good look at for a longer term portfolio at around 25.

If you want to make a real bet on the railcar industry, Greenbriar's (GBX)
railcar business is almost free. With this one you've got to dig into the
balance sheet. Backing out the cash is easy. Then look at the leasing business.
I would back that out too, leaving the railcar business trading for virtually
nothing.

I was listening to a conversation among some friends at the office today.
Bandwidth this, network that. I just said, "I've got to listen to my railcar
conference call" and they laughed at me. That gives me comfort in being short
the Nasdaq and long TRN. Yeah, I can spend 5 billion dollars laying a network
of cable around the world, not knowing whether or not somebody else is going to
have a better mousetrap in six months, or I could buy the low cost producer in
a depressed industry. For the first I pay 17 times book, for the second I pay
book. That's not among life's tough decisions in my opinion.

On another note, then I'll stop, any thoughts on Equifax (EFX)? I'm just
starting to do my homework, but a few things look good. Free cash flow is
enormous, and the company grows. They seem to have done some poor acquisitions
and growth in one of their core businesses has slowed to a halt. I know zippo
about the industry, and I wonder if there is somebody here who can help me out.

James - I must confess that I just got back from the library where I was
specifically looking at EFX. I agree with all you say. Note a lot of debt (not
sure that I totally understand their credit facility - at least that's what it
appears to be although in 1998 they filed an S-3 for some type of debt
securities). In any case, VL indicated that they covered interest 6-7X. They
spun off their insurance info biz CPS in 1997. Then took on all that debt to
buy up credit bureaus. VL noted that things don't work in other countries the
way they do here - viz. problems in UK and write off of 34% in Brazilian
entity.

I was trivially viewing them as a sort of toll booth companion to FIC in
consumer credit. I've only seen the things you mentioned. I'm looking for
weevils.

To All,

I took a small position in Scottish & Newcastle. It's part of the beaten down
beverage group in Great Britain.

The symbol is SCTN.L

http://finance.uk.yahoo.com/quotes/ukie/quote?s=SCTN.L

http://www.scottish-newcastle.com/

It's trading around 7-8 times forward earnings with a dividend yield of over
6%. It owns pubs, lodging, distributes beer for other companies and owns
Newcastle Brown Ale. (I am very fond of this beer - burp!)

Overall growth is in the mid single digits but Brown Ale is showing great
promise in the US. The stock is down well over 50% from its recent high and is
trading at a level not seen for many years.

I took a very small position because I was unfamiliar with it until very
recently. As I learn more I may add to the position.

Great way for a value investor to celebrate the Millennium... without the

(We really liked "Food Lover's Guide to Paris"-- great choices therein.)

Our expensive (imo) first class airfare (which is an improvement over business
class) pales compared to the losses I see I'm taking with my airline stocks in
the past week. UAL, DAL, ALK all down.

Going through my incoming 1099's, now I see that not only did the growth and
income funds not do well, but that I've got more income than growth. Not being
tax sheltered, I'll be paying full tax on this income.

As you said last week, the question is where should the freed up money now be
reinvested. I'll be calling for prospectuses for some funds on Monday. I
personally would rather buy my own kind of stocks with all family monies, but
for diversification and "some" "alleged" "safety" I'll have some mutual funds.
If market crashes, I tell myself that I can explain to family members, that
see, it wasn't just me--the top guys got hit and hurt too. Realistically
though, if I'm involved in selecting a fund, I believe my family will still
beat on me for ANY losses they might experience (temporary or permanent,
regardless of fund or fund manager).

Two funds that might be intriguing - but I know nothing about-are TCW Galileo

Anyone buying or adding to their position in Sara Lee?

It's long been on my short list of companies that I would like to own for the

Paul, I have not looked at them in years, but the Dodge & Cox funds used to be
a good group. It is a small (low expense ratio) fund family out of San
Francisco dating back to the early part of the LAST century <ggg>, that relies
on a committee style of management, as opposed to a "superstar". It used to
exhibit stable, solid performance, focusing on larger companies offering good
traditional investment value. For example when IBM was dropping to $40 a few
years ago they were increasing exposure rather than reducing it. I like that
kind of style. (I have never bought stock mutual funds but that is the one I
picked when I did a review some years ago, probably at some time when I was

Security/Surveillance biz: I don't know SILV or ULTK, but I occasionally follow
a couple of the other publicly traded companies. Sensormatic (SRM), which has
had its full share of troubles (management/owner control) and Vicon (VII). I no
longer own SRM. (Sorry I missed the last great run up. Got scared off by a
potential technology shift in source tagging developed by Eastman Chemical.)

I do have a small position in Vicon. At 6 1/4, it's selling below it's tangible
book value ($6.86/sh), at 3.3x ebitd, and with a 16% ROE. P/e is about 6+.
Although linked closely to US Post Office business, they did get contracts for
a couple of "prestigious" installations - Motor City Casinos and Harrah's (New
Orleans). Earnings may suffer in the short run as they (too)increase
expenditures for product development caused by the "convergence of digital
video, computer technology and traditional CCTV platforms".

Given what I perceive as the competitive nature of the business, the small size
of VII and SILV, the resources of larger companies (SRM), the potential arrival
of new entrants (perhaps LOGIY- Logitech with its digicams?), my opinion is
that
at this point, it's not such a great industry to be investing a large portion
of one's portfolio.

re: Trinity. Yes, I like TRN and I've doubled my position since my 10/22 post
on TRN. And I am considering adding more. The perception is that TRN is rail
cars. And they are. But they are in 6 different "business segments" and making
acquisitions out of rail. I'm expecting earnings to be supported by their
Highway Construction Group which will prosper (I am betting) with the Highway
Construction Bill. They have also been pretty good about adopting new
technology and manufacturing processes (from what I read. Developed new highway
guard rail for example.)

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=trn
Trying to figure the trough for TRN is tough (of course). Stock hasn't traded
this close to book value in a long time. That might be one indication. Nor at
such a low psr. (Of course if sales decline, then looking at "low" psr is
risky.) D/E is low. If they earn 12% on equity (the low in recent years),
that'd be about $2.88 and just affixing a 7 pe to it--maybe about $20 might be
a "reasonable" low???

Alternatively, I'd rather consider where the stock might be 18-24 mo.
out. I bet more up than down.

Sara Lee is one of the first stocks I would buy if I were creating a portfolio
from scratch today. Under $20 is an absolute steal for a growth company of this
quality in my opinion. The entire food group is way out of favor, and I believe
this is not only the largest, but also the lowest P/E stock in the group (I
adjust the P/E for goodwill amortization, which is very significant). But it is
also a much better company in my opinion than the companies trading at higher
multiples like Heinz or Kellogg.

I also like General Mills, which just surpassed Kellogg for the first time in
market share for cereal. Its valuation is not as attractive as Sara Lee's
though.

SNH - The tenants who filed for bankruptcy were expected to file for bankruptcy
by anybody with a brain who owned the stock. Not to say there isn't selling
based on that "news" - one knew going in that this was going to take a year or
so to work out, with a lot of bad news in front of you. Thats why the dividend
is so important.

One of the tenants who filed for bankruptcy has a year or more security deposit
supporting rent payments. That is important. One of the IHS leases is trouble,
but I believe is more than fully discounted in the valuation. I've done all
kinds of stress tests figuring that all the bad leases default and retenant at
market value, and I find that my downside risk is 12-16. The stock trades at 11
and change. When I say risk I mean what is it worth, not where will it trade. A
big distinction, but that's what value investing is all about. If my downside
risk is at worst 12 based on analysis of the leases, and the stock trades at 11
1/2 and pays a 15%+ dividend once its cut (it will be), I figure I'm going to
do alright if I hold this for a year or so.

I am still expecting a drop in the stock when the dividend is cut. I am waiting

I would like to share with the participants of this board an interesting
opportunity I came up with while browsing today.

I found it by reading a story written last week in the USA Today. Here is the
link:

http://www.usatoday.com/news/comment/colhenr.htm

Florida East Coast a hidden treasure? was titled the article. Well, IMO FLA may
well be a treasure, but the reporter omitted to talk about a more compelling
value: St. Joe Co. (JOE).

Besides holding sizeable acres (1,1 million to be more specific) of lands
throughout Florida, JOE controls 54% of FLA and has already announces the
spin-off of all its shares to shareholders. This means that sooner or later,
JOE will send to shareholders of record .225 shares of FLA for each share of
JOE.

In other words, if you hold 100 shares of JOE you will end up with 22.5 shares
of FLA. At current market price, these new shares would be worth $1091,25. One
hundred shares of JOE are worth close to $2500 right now, which would mean that
you have JOE's remaining holdings for $14.20 per share.

If you consider that JOE is repurchasing shares aggressively, and that there is
over $3 net of cash per share, this would make it a very cheap stock to own in
itself. What's more is that JOE's management is devoted to unlock hidden value.
And so far, it has delivered, even though the market has not taken notice yet.

You'll notice that insiders control 61% of this company. Not surprisingly, in
the last months they have been active buyers of the stock at prices above or
very close to the current price.

Based on trailing earnings, FLA's added about 24 cents to JOE's bottom line of
$1.25. If you still apply a p/e of 18 to JOE post spin-off, this would give us
a price of $18 based on trailing earning. Don't forget that you would still
have your shares of FLA. Considering that FLA is investing in the telecom
industry, I think that these shares still have some upside built-in -- besides
valuable holdings which make it a very profitable outfit already.

Well, this a quickly written resum‚ of my findings. I'd like very much to hear
from you guys about your opinion.

Regards,

MF

P.S.: I don't hold a position on JOE or FLA, but I am very tempted to make a
move as soon as tomorrow morning.

I appreciate the info on VII and its value status in comparison to SILW.

It so happens that I own a very small position in VII (purchased late last year
at 5 3/8), along with several other small caps. These were specifically
purchased to play a hoped for "year-end rally in depressed small caps."

However, these securities were purchased only for a trade of several months
(although human nature being what it is, and depending on circumstances, I
might re-evaluate my position and even double up, sell as planned, or maintain
a status quo long term investment posture).

Yes VII is perhaps "cheap," but when you compare the heavy debt load, poor and
hopefully improving financial ratios of VII, with the pristine financial
statements and ratios of SILW, I can only answer that I am very comfortable
paying somewhat more for a great management with the financial flexibility of
no debt, high margins and high ROE. Let alone (in my opinion, a far superior
product line). Cameras that can withstand temperatures of -50C (Arctic Hawk),
visibility of 40 feet in complete darkness (Night Hawk) and, perhaps my
favorite , the cameras that are armour plated and bullet resistant.

But as you said, there is still the risk of being small and competing with
giants. Can't argue here except to say that is one of the reasons why top
management is so important in my investment equation.

For what it is worth, took a small position in CMH at 8 7/16 and 8 5/16 this
past week (thank you James Clarke). Also in DHI at 11 1/2 because I think the
company is cheap and I expected John Neff to speak positively about the company
in this week's Barrons. Read Neff's recent book as to further detail as to why
he really liked DHI, although I am probably a little early on DHI, I will
definitely average down should DHI decline another point and one-quarter or so.

Airlines also appear cheap, but am only looking still, especially at ALK and
DAL... any specific insight as to how to best time this industry would be much
appreciated. I am not comfortably holding this industry long term, but short
term... perhaps when oil prices begin to decline, and fuel hedges are properly
evaluated, a trade?

Thanks, Marc. JOE's frequently been one of the stocks cited by value investors
as having hidden or undeveloped assets. Over the long haul, JOE's worked out
well for Mutual Shares. I recall reading that their cost basis was in the
pennies. M. Price just kept the shares he got from his mentor, Heine.

I once did a brief and superficial study of stocks mentioned here that seemed
to have gone on to perform "well" or "profitably" for value investors. I found
that if three people posted here that they bought a particular stock, that
stock would "invariably" (my judgment/opinion word) rise. And there just
weren't that many 3 way agreements. (Because, imo, we all see value differently
and have different goals.) JOE is one stock that at least 3 people agree on.
(Some of this may be due to one particular poster, James Clarke, who is a
professional analyst who, I recall, had looked at JOE for his investment firm.)

I'm long JOE. I appreciate your analysis and report, especially as there's some
new information for me.

There are a number of other publicly traded land holding/land developing
companies that may be undervalued also. Fwiw, I mention two developers that I
own: CDX and CCS (mentioned here to show diversification, not to tout as being
undervalued. And other people here have posted on different land holding
companies that they own.) My preference is to diversify among different
geographical regions. This for safety and for serendipity (I know of two
instances where such stocks have been suddenly reevaluated upward.)

The U.S. heating and cooling giant from Richardson, Tex., went public in July,
just as the market was falling off its record peak. It is now trading below its
offering price but reported record earnings for the third quarter. Management
believes the stock is undervalued and will be buying back up to five million
shares. Meanwhile, the stock?s P/E ratio is a low six and it is trading below
book value. Warburg Dillon Read, the New York brokerage, thinks it will hit $25
(U.S.) during the next 12 months

---------------------
ATI Technologies TSE:ATY (or NASDAQ:ATYT)
*numbers are based on TSE listing*
http://www.atitech.com
Recent Price = $18.15 (CAN$)
EPS = $0.80
P.E. = 22
Yorkton Securities 12mo target = $37 (CAN$)
*analyst targets range from $24 to $37*

Market leader, graphics cards, HDTV cards, set-top boxes, chips, etc. yet the
P.E. is around 23 and they've got GREAT revenue and earnings history. They've
got several "design wins" (CEO's words) that can't yet be announced until they
have the customer's approval. There has been some speculation about these wins
and it is generally thought that Microsoft will choose either ATI or Nvidia for
it's new "Black-box" set top unit.

I think USEC just bottomed. Please.

I've been watching and waiting for the orderly selling to break down into a
rout. Today somebody said "no mas" and dumped a million share block at 5 3/8 or
so, gapping the stock down nearly 20%. I just added to my position for the
first time since the IPO.

The company had $1.75 or so of free cash flow last year, and still pays a
dividend of $1.10 (which could of course be cut). At this extreme, after a big

Jim Oravetz: I'd say though, that there weren't any surprise stocks for thread
readers with the Neff picks in Barron's. All his picks have been discussed here
before. Some very recently - Horton & Toll, Delta, Wash. Mu., Owens Corning.
One thing I like about Mr. Neff is that he seems to be consistent in his
discussion with the business press. For example, in an interview in IBD,
12/31/99 he also discussed his choices of OWC, DAL, and HIW. (He also mentioned
Brandywine Realty Trust -BDN in that article.)

I was surprised to see an old favorite of mine, UHAL, discussed, and for more
than a few lines. (Oscar Schafer portion of Roundtable). UHAL was discussed
here a couple of years ago in much detail. Thread consensus seemed to be that
problems regarding the controlling family (incompetence/self-serving side
businesses, family fights) were just too significant. These are issues which
still exist and were glossed over by Mr. Schafer, imo. Nevertheless, I maintain
a postion in UHAL which I ocassionally trade into/out of.

Smacs: LII, ATYT. thanks for the info. on LII. I'm somewhere in the midst of it
since I bought SVE as an arbitrage play. (And as you know, LII is just
completing its acquisition of SVE.) And I'm still considering whether to hold
LII shares.

ATYT. I only find two year's of data for "GREAT earnings and revenue history"
http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=atyt
(I suspect it may be my problem in finding information on Canadian companies.)
My guess would be that most value investors here could not consider, ATYT to be
a value stock now with its current p/e, p/bk, p/sales and short(?) history. But
even if so, this of course does not mean that ATYT could not be a very

Yeah, I was a bit hesitant to put ATYT up for just those reasons. Comparing its
PE with other picks on the thread, it doesn't look very cheap. Compared to its
industry and its competitors though, I think it could be fairly undervalued.

Financial for ATI can be a bit confusing as well since they started reporting
in US$ only last year and all previous statements were in CDN$. Here's a PDF
document with their figures (last four years) converted to US$:

http://www.ati.com/na/pages/corporate/investor_relations/finance_history.PDF

I believe your chart is referencing the NASDAQ listing which is relatively new.

This year they only MET (rather than exceeding) estimates and were punished for
it. And earning weren't as impressive as they have been due to an increase in
R&D and marketing.

I think you're right Paul. It's not quite a true value stock, but I'm counting
on it being re-evaluated soon by the market.

Jim, Glad to see it working for you. Me, look at what I just did today (because
it would seem that I have lost the 'net net' faith, though I don't believe so):

Sold Disney, PECO.

Bought Washington Mutual, Ross Stores, Ethan Allen, more Clayton Homes, more
Tricon Global. Two days ago, I bought Philip Morris.

I feel like a kid in a candy store. There are quite a few values in the market,
IMO, and I don't feel the need to play net nets. The stuff I'm buying passes
EVA muster at the same time it passes various other value criteria IMO. This of
course raises the question whether I would ever play net nets at a true market
bottom. My strategy with net nets is the opposite of what Tweedy Browne found
(they having found that it was the money-losing crappy businesses that were the
money makers for net net investors). Rather, since I am not playing the
tried-and-true diversified approach to net nets, I'm only buying net nets when
I see "corroborating value" in the story/cash flow/earnings/potential/insider
activity/whatever. EBSC I own now, but for different reasons than you might
think. After buying, I realized it is not really a net net when you consider
the operating leases. There is corroborating value though, so I held. With LKI,
an updated 10Q revealed it wasn't a net net, and I couldn't find corroborating
value, so I sold. With General Cigar, I was up to my ears in corroborating
value no matter what the inventory really was worth.

However, CPU always seems to be more crowded than the others, perhaps because

Interesting point on EBSC. In one sense, an operating lease is a future
obligation which might be subtracted if you are considering liquidation value.
But on the other hand, ask yourself what happens to an operating lease on a
department store in liquidation. Lets say a department store operator has a
lease for $20 a foot and market rents are $20. The landlord will break that
lease and retenant the property, without a big concession. If market rents are
$30, the landlord would probably pay you to break the lease, especially if you
are an underperforming department store. What you have to worry about is if you
are leasing space for $20 in a $10 market. I don't think that is what we are
dealing with here.

Think of it as if you have a five year lease on an apartment. Depending on the
relationship between the contract rent and the market rent, that lease could be
either an asset or a liability.

corroborating value in other aspects of the business.

Market rents are what market rents are - you might think they're going to fall,
but they haven't yet. That is a forecast. I don't know for a fact, but I would
guess EBSC's leases are at or more likely below market. Are you agreeing with
my underlying point on the economics?

Let me illustrate it again this way. There is a BIG difference between a lease
obligation and a debt obligation.

If I owe a lender money, thats the extent of the obligation - I have to repay
him with interest.

If I sign a lease, I owe money, but the lessor owes me the use of something of
value. So with what you rightly call an off-balance sheet liability also comes
an off-balance sheet asset. That is why I consider it way overly conservative
to worry too much about operating leases except in extreme circumstances.

Think again about the lease on an apartment. Lets say I have an apartment lease
for $1000 a month going out one year. And I have a $12,000 car loan. There is
clearly a difference between the two, no?

Thank you, James, for helping with this issue on EBSC. If I understand you

or may not have any value, and could conceivably be an asset -- and that you do

decision.

Jim, yes I am agreeing with your underlying point. There's an off-balance sheet
asset that offsets the off-balance sheet liability to some degree or to all 360
degrees. So one must estimate them both and come to some conclusion. I'm just
saying that Graham's net net calc is pretty simple. If he could be pressed on
different types of off-balance sheet liabilities today as regards his net net
strategy, how do you think he'd treat operating leases? Maybe he'd assume it's
a wash, but I think it's a bit much to assume he would make it an asset.
Especially with such a conservative style as net net investing.

before when we have these debates and other times we've agreed on my side of
the question - but in hashing it out, we all learn something. I take his
thinking very seriously, and this question on operating leases is not closed

we're on hallowed ground here. My Graham text is sitting on my desk at work,

You agree with me - the net net calculation does not ask one to make an

offsets the liability part of it one to one. That may be a good assumption or
it might not.

When I read The Money Master's, Train's feeling was that you didn't even need
to go into this kind of extensive financial analysis when investing in
net-nets. It was overkill. He said it was sufficient to just buy a large basket
of them and watch two out of three of them work out. Even Graham, later in
life, came to the conclusion that extensive analysis of securities didn't add
much value to the investment process. That was when he boiled his ideas down to
a small number of "bullet points."

I think the you hit it twister. When looking at net nets as individual picks in
a concentrated portfolio in a frothy market, we're not following Graham's
method very well anyway. So I insist on extra corroborating value
analysis/evidence to help me when I add my one or two or three net nets to a
portfolio. Tweedy Browne has done some proprietary research on this which which
is mentioned here and there in various investing texts. Their feeling is that
the net nets that actually did well when purchased as part of a broad
diversified portfolio of them were the ones that had horribly negative earnings
rather than positive earnings, and that had business models that didn't seem
viable. This makes sense, because net net is really a proxy for a form of
liquidating value, and becomes least relevant in an operating company that is
expected to continue to run forever. Nevertheless, Jim and I and others here
have had success picking up operating companies with decent futures and decent
stories at less than 2/3 net net. Hence, inevitably we will each just have to
reach our own conclusions given the available personal anecdote and evidence.

On the question of how selective to be with net-nets, lets consider what Graham
said on the subject.

"on the whole these stocks [net-nets] afford profitable opportunities for
purchase. Nevertheless, the securities analyst should exercise as much
discrimination as possible in the choice of issues falling within this
category. He will lean toward those for which he sees a fairly imminent
prospect of some one of the favorable developments listed above. Or else he
will be partial to such as reveal other atractive statistical features, e.g
satisfactory current earnings and dividends, or a high average earning power in
the past. The analyst will avoid issues which have been losing their quick
assets at a rapid rate and show no definite signs of ceasing to do so."

was the other kind as suggested by Tweedy Browne's studies. How to find out, I

than 2/3 net net in quantity, he would only be buying them at market bottoms.

I'd subtract these leases in getting to net-nets for retail companies like
EBSC. My reasoning is that I figure the retailers can muddle through when the
economy is good, people are working and confident, and therefore buying. But
with downturn in economy, retail sales are curtailed and imo, so is demand by
businesses for office/retail space. Therefore market value of leases is down.
So just at the point when the investor might look at a retail business as an
investment (when retail stocks are cheap and the economy is bad), those lease
obligations are a severe burden on the
retailer. In good or normal times it doesn't matter, as you say, and maybe now
for EBSC it doesn't matter either. But imo, subtracting the lease obligations
is the more conservative way to go. Especially, I'd say, if someone were trying
to value the business as an ongoing entity or otherwise trying to pick the
"best" net-nets. Maybe Prof. Graham, who would take a basket approach and maybe
advise the amateur "defensive" investors to keep it simple, would say it's not
practical for the average investor to do this evaluation - so just ignore it
unless it can be seen that the lease obligations are overly onerous? Or maybe
just skip on by such companies.

4. Adding to Equifax (EFX). A growth value pick, imo. Many Buffett

5. Adding to Quintiles (QTRN). Stock now may be influenced by HLTH share price
(a plus and a minus, imo). Deal with HLTH may be a "value" when numbers are

resume its growth and focus.

I just bought some ABERF (ABZ.To), Aber Resources. It's a diamond stock. I
think it fits as a value stock.

Bad part: They've got problems with the Canadian govt. and Provincial
regulatory agencies and native groups about getting the necessary permits for
building the 2nd (or maybe 3rd) diamond mine in Canada's NWT. They say if
things aren't resolved in the next few days that they will be delayed by one
year in their plans to build a mine with a start-up in 2002 or 2003.

Good parts: JV partner: Rio Tinto PLC. Aber owns 40% of the Diavik project that
has an in situ value of $4.3 billion US. 56 mil shares fully diluted. Share
price is about C 8 or US 5 9/16. Of this I think they have C$4 in cash [got
that number from a discussion site so I can't vouch for it and can't find the
number in Aber's web-site} and a 16-32% interest (they're litigating whether
they own 16% or 32% now) in another diamond project (Snap Lake) worth $4.2 bil.

For comparison, the Ekati mine, Canada's first diamond mine, owned by Dia Met
and Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary, has an in situ value of $7.2 bil and
Dia Met had a $2.1 bil interest in it. Diamet's in situ value to mkt. cap ratio
was 4.4 when Canaccord Capital did a comparison in Nov. At that time, Aber was
trading at C$8.65 and its in-situ value to market cap ration was 13.6 to one
and that number didn't include Aber's 16-32% interest in the Snap Lake, $4.2
bil property.

Assumptions:

Cash $4/sh

Interest in Snap Lake: 16% (lowest figure) of US $4.2 bil= $672 mil . Assume
current value is 10% of that number, or $67 mil. Divide by 56 mil sh and you
have another $1.19/sh that would be double that if they succeed in the lawsuit
( I think they'll win).

So, at around C$8/sh, the market is assigning around $3/sh to Aber's interest
in the Diavik project, or C$168 mil worth of a $C6.18 bil in situ (US $4.3 bil)
value.

Other things to consider:

Tiffany bought about 14% of Aber at C$13. They have a marketing agreement with
Aber that frees Aber in large part from the monopoly of DeBeers and the Central
Selling Organization.

Franco Nevada, an historically shrewd company that mainly loans money to mining
companies in return for a royalty percentage, owns about 13% of Aber.

Worst case scenario...the govt. up there screws Aber and they can't build a
mine. Margin of safety then.....not so good. Consequence: the govt. screws
itself in that it won't get the taxes flowing from the mine and the
economically poor area stays poor.

I like the conservative way which they are financing the mydiscountbroker.com

on, rather the company sells a partial position of its NITE holdings (still
owns a ton).
There always is the sniff of merger/takeover around this company (virtually any

Well, according to when you looked at it. At 16, I said yes. And I believe that
there were at least two other buys on this board that confirmed it, if I'm not

Going back to the net/net Jackpot. Today they announce that the hidden news is
that they've settled their litigation with their largest client (Albertsons).
They get a roll back in the rent deal that caused them to be a break-even
business. Should get some sort of lump sum payment for the last few months.
Going forward their costs will be reduced as much as $18 million. (I'm not sure
about the length of time of the contract they signed last summer.) Problem is
that next week they lose the old Lucky stores that Albertsons had to divest. As
I recall, this was a significant portion of their business.

Next week, Jackpot appears to have a smaller business that is profitable with
assets that include $8/share cash. At what price do you buy?

Marc F. re USU. Yes, I agree with your comments. I'm not able to see how
they're going to grow the bus. And I suspect - since the div. yield is so high,
that it's unsustainable. It's not relevant in this case though (imo of course).
Here's why I'm buying (in a VERY diversified portfolio):

1. Faith in Jim Clarke. Foolish reason perhaps -g- but there you have it. I
trust he's looked over the financials many times, pretty closely, and has
talked with management too. Plus thought about the business and its prospects.

2. I'm buying a business - I mean Yahoo says they do have 70% of their market
in the US and 40% world-wide (whatever all that means -g-). Stock near it's
2-year low.

3. with a tangible book value of $11.44, selling under 6 bucks a
share, insider buys at higher prices, p/ebitd of 3.1. Pays a div.

There's no catalyst out there that I know of that will jump the price up
either. You just have to put your hand over nose on this stinker and reach for
a little (and you should have a number of these kinds of stocks, if you have
1). All jmo.

I'm smarter than James Clarke, I essentially free-rode on his analysis of USU,
but bought my shares at $13.25 instead of paying $14 ($14.25?) like he did ;-)

Then, when the shares *really* went on sale, I bought a bunch more at
$12.5-ish.

I sure outsmarted him, eh?

I'm not able to see how they're going to grow the bus.

But, so what if they can't grow the business? And, so what if the business
wastes away to nothing in twenty years? If you get enough cash out of it soon
enough, you can still come out just fine. At a good enough price, growth is not
necessary.

The one thing I've discovered that I admit bothers me a bit is that Yahoo! says
that their head honcho is paid $2.5M. Perhaps I'm a bit Grinchy, but that
sounds overly generous to me. I'm not 100% convinced that management is truly
100% on the side of shareholders. This is my chief worry, that management will
be slow or ineffective in properly delivering value to shareholders.

I have "figure out USU" on my weekend to-do list. Provided that there's no
fatal flaw, it simply looks too good to be true. Perhaps "home runs" always
look this scary? Then again, I'll bet strikeouts do too..

I am recomending Alliance Semiconductor as a value stock at these levels I just
purchased shares at 15 1/8. The value of their public shareholdings some of
which are subject to lockups is $33-34 (inclusive of taxes) on top of that they
have started two venture funds in which they have invested some $20MM and on
top of that they have a business which I believe is just starting to turn
profitable. Most of their net worth right now is concentrated in the value of
their shares in UMC one of the larger Taiwanese foundries. The stock has not
moved much in the past few months perhaps because it has no pizazz but I think
I am buying at least $1.50 of good assets for $1 and maybe more than that.

Armin, re asset allocations. I am putting some money into convertible bonds
with superior yields to maturity. Last purchase was Alterra Health (ali.a) at
61 with 5.25 coupon and maturing Dec 2002. Yield to maturity is over 25% if
company does not go belly up. The debt to equity is about 4/1 making this very
risky. However I believe the company will stay solvent and that the return is
worth the risk. Convertible bonds quite often reach very high levels relative
to face value because of the convertibility factor and the arbitrage players
buy the bonds and sell the stock. When the stock collapses, a la ali and may
reits and health care companies, the bonds get dumped so that the short stock
positions can be closed.
This is one reason that convertibles can trade lower prices than comparable
junk bonds. If others on the thread are familiar with other reasons for "cheap"
convertibles I would be interested in learning more. In any case there are many
opportunities to earn a good return while waiting for this market to shake out.
Another way to hedge your bets is to play the arbitrage games. I wish that some
of the other excellent posters on this thread would visit Mikes arbitrage
thread. We could use some more expert opinions. Right now I think ctz might
offer the best opportunity.
P.S. Madgf is now my biggest holding but unfortunately I have been selling
leaps along the way(5,10 and 15 strike) I am nervous now that madge may
collapse if the momentum bubble finally breaks.

Not such a good day to be owning stocks, but maybe a good day to be buying

Happy to be adding to my position in Aviation Sales - AVS. Good price/sales,
price/book, price/earnings - when they have earnings. (Stock cratered today.)
Also buying Federal Mogul (FMO). As it hits new lows, I buy more. EBITD is now
near 1. That is too cheap, imho. And ECIL, my tech play mentioned here
recently---problems with sales mix and sales recognition hit the stock. I say
it's temporary, and I'm buying more, as stock @$27 is 10 points under what
"smart" controlling stockholder has paid.

Starting new positions in AK Steel (AKS) after earnings disappointment and
stock plummet. Co. says lot of it is merger related expense. Also IBP. Sales
don't grow but they are wringing profits out of the business. I say stock will
recover from 14 level to at least 21 in 1 yr to 18 mo. Also a very small start
in Goodyear (GT). Stock now under 24 was over 66 in past 12 months. No real
sales growth and it's accumulating debt, but price/book and 5% div. yield are
attractive. (to me. Reply #9156, from Mike Burry, presents negative. Plus not
in S&P)I'll make a small bet that the new management and controlling
stockholder at Rite Aid can do something to propel RAD's $6 1/2 stock up over
11 (again) in year 2000. And I've taken an exploratory position in Wallace's
SWS. Downside might be 18 (book value) from current $26 price. I'd guess upside
potential might be 2x book - more if NITE, internet associated businesses get
hot.

I don't know how to figure MO, but it's either not a buy at any price (because
of govt/lawsuits) or it's a buy around 21. I need a little more time to
consider Mike B's MO pick. And I'll relook at Alliance Semiconductor (ALSC).

All my predictions assume the market doesn't crash. And assume I know of what I

We both know IDTC, which never got any respect for its apparently huge asset
value in NTOP - because we felt that asset value could never be delivered. Why
isn't ALSC a similar situation? UMC is not only a foreign company but also one
whose value when the lockup periods end may be (?) in this volatile industry.
My guess is that the discount
stays until they start delivering some of this value directly to shareholders -
sort of like a huge discount closed end fund holding illiquid investments.

There is a big difference between NTOP which has no profits and may or may not
be around in five years and UMC which is the second largest semi foundry in the
world. I do not believe that UMC value is inflated now and that when the
lock-up period ends on ALSC shares it will have much of an impact. There is a
likelihood that the value of UMC will increase over time as the Asia economies
continue to improve and the need for semiconductors grow. You are right however
-buying into ALSC is like buying into a closed end fund at a huge discount and
if the operating unit turns around or the venture capital investments take off
its a bonus. Now I also think that IDTC is a value play but not nearly as safe
a one as ALSC.

My response is that the man is a shill for the short-sellers . You may find
this article of interest: written by the shill about ROcker and Chianos.
http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9409F03.html I believe the shorts originally
went into this stock when THQI lost the WCF rights to wrestling video games
which at the time constituted 70% of their revenues. Who would have believed
that they could have made such wonderful lemonade after getting handed that
lemon! After THQI developed such new fine products, had forged a 10 year
licensing deal with WWF wrestling and came out with the wrestling hit of the
year, toy story 2 , rugrats, and deals with MTV, then were added to the S&P
midcap index the shorts were in a bind. So they have mounted a spectacular
publicity campaign and have done really well.
There is nothing wrong with capitalizing software expense over the life of an
existing product. Accounting 101 says that you strive to match the timing of
your expenses and your revenues. What the rest of industry does I do not know.
There have been lots of channel checks done by the participants on the various
threads and if the channel has been stuffed it is well hidden because the
overwhelming number of checks indicate shortages of the most popular games.
The comments he quotes about the reserves are ridiculous. You can review the
actual numbers on the THQI thread #12869. He is very careful to state in his
article that he is merely reporting comments of a short seller. I assume this
lets him of the hook legally.
I almost wish someone steps up and offers $60 bucks a share for this company so
that the bad guys get what they deserve.

Re: USU--Company has output contracts and prearranged prices for the next 5
years that should earn enough to pay down all debt (if they wanted, although
all interest expense is fixed for the next 7 to 9 years at well under 7%) and
to have cash equal to the current stock price. After that, you will own the
company for free. The only questions are: What will be the earnings power of
the business when these contracts roll off and what will they do with all of
this cash flow.

At least, dividends should result in shareholders receiving a huge share of
this money. If management is smart enough to buy back more stock at these
prices, this could be a home run if the business has any earning power in five
years. Certainly, worldwide nuclear power plants will still be around.

Risks are that management is not well incented and may possibly be dumb. But
looks like a good value bet at these prices. Clearly, many people who loved it

I understand your reasons, and was tempted to take a position for very similar
ones, but I already hold a few "special situations", namely: MAT, MO, MSFT,
ATYT, PTIX, DCI, TGO and even GBT.a (TSE).

I even had CRW (TSE) or CNRM (NASDAQ) lately, but closed that position to
switch to BCE. As you can see, all these stocks are depressed right now, except
TGO and DCI which are closing to my entry price.

On a value basis, MAT and MO don't have to be presented (they sure can be
discussed however...). I know that neither MSFT, ATYT, TGO or PTIX would
qualify as value stocks, but given the current valuations in high tech, I
figure that they are undervalued in relation to the underlying business,
compared to the competitors' stock valuations anyway...

As for DCI and GBT.a, I really like the former even though it hasn't tested
it's high of 1997 yet. I don't doubt that the stock price will move North
eventually, given the strong economics of the company. IMHO, it is a great
stock to hold for the long-term. If you're interested, have a look at Yahoo!'s
forum. Not very active, but the discussion is good.

GBT.a is an other story well worth a look. I am quite sure Warren Buffett would
love it if he could lay his hand on their annual report. Do you know many
furniture companies that have revenues well over 500 million $ (CDN) per year
with only 20 stores, in a small market of 8 million people? The comparable in
Canada, Leon's Furniture, is far from those numbers with two or three times as
many stores, mainly located in a much bigger - and wealthier - region, the
province of Ontario.

What's more, GBT.a raises its dividend regularly and repurchases shares at a
quick pace. Profit margins are improving and ROE too. There is no debt to speak
of and about 20 million $ in treasury. P/E ratio is 7.2 on trailing earnings of
$2.43. Net profit will probably be around $2.60 for the year (ending December
1999). The numbers were $2.08 for 1998 and $1.67 for 1997.

The only draw back besides the very small float: sales growth is slowing
somewhat, even though Quebec's economy is doing good. Well, Groupe BMTC will
still be very profitable, but the growth will probably slow down until the next
recession, which should be good for a company with such a strong balance sheet
against weaker competitors. I plan to add to my position along the road.

MF

P.S.: BTW, Fidelity Investments is a big shareholder (10% I believe) of Groupe
BMTC. Oh! I forgot, insiders were regular buyers of the stock in 1999, at
prices well above the current valuation.

I missed one big thing. Perhaps the biggest thing one could miss. The fact that
the product is a commodity whose price could fall - and it did, and that their
costs are fixed.

I sold about 75% of my USEC holdings today. Maybe that means I capitulated and
this is the bottom, or maybe it doesn't. The stock is cheap, but so are a lot
of other stocks with a future. Big mistake - this was my Waste Management,

Today was brutal on stocks, but still orderly which tells me this is far from

about hedge funds and banks might have some problems, which might lead to more
selling. Whether buyers emerge Monday morning is going to be interesting - we
