Hi guys,

It's a rare event that one of the stocks that I monitor
turns into a value play. :-) So here it is: BYDS.

See http://biz.yahoo.com/p/b/byds.html for details.
There's also an SI thread at
http://www.exchange2000.com/~wsapi/investor/Subject-14904

The downside is that they did not have a greatest
balance sheet. To get the cash they have to borrow.
A secondary at this price would be horrible. If they
cannot return to profitability, they could bleed to death.

If they can turn around, there's a potential for
high returns.

Comments?

Hello all,
I'm new to this board, and it is too large to go through all of the messages to
see if my question has been answered already. If it has, please point me in the
right direction.

I've been interested in value investing for some time now, but I've always been
intimidated by it, not because I don't know how to interpret financial
statements - I'm actually pretty good with a balance sheet & income and cash
flow statements - but rather it has seemed such a huge task to collect and
analyze the required information for a large number of companies in order to
find the few gems that are out there. In these days of easy computing, it seems
to me that this initial screening task can be made much easier by accessing a
database and letting the computer weed through all of the statistics in order
to narrow down to a list that is worthy of further investigation.

Is anyone aware of a database that contains key company data such as current &
historic earnings, historic stock prices, balance sheet info, historic
dividends, etc. and can be used to screen companies using various value related
criteria that I might choose?

I've got to believe there is something like this out there somewhere. I just
don't know where to look. I would appreciate any comments or suggestions.

Thanks,

Jim

Clayleas,
Prodigy (yup) has a function called Strategic Investor which makes up to 50
companies a week downloadable in a format that can be imported into a database
or spreadsheet. It also has some [rudimentary] criteria filters so you can
limit yourself somewhat. It costs $15/mo over the regular Prodigy subscription.
The very bad downside is that you don't know the date of the latest 10-k or
10-q until AFTER you make the download.

I have been getting weekly advice from Market Guide, the supplier of the info
to Prodigy, as to what the latest dates are, so I no longer have to do the
guessing game. Market Guide also makes their info available on CD ROM for a
weekly, monthly or quarterly subscription rate. It's far more expensive, but
the actual ratio to one's portfolio can make its cost insignificant. BUT, their
software can't export data in the .CSV format (suitable for database or
spreadsheet importation) as can Prodigy! I don't know why, and even THEY don't
know why. They're looking into it, however, and when they figure it out, I'll
probably drop Progidy and use them directly. Hope this helps.

Three packages (data downloaded to my PC or on CD's that I use all the time:
1) Value Line Cd - Most trustworthy number's i've found - very easy to use.
Contains not only numbers but text on the 'story' of the stock and value line
ratings). Negatives it's expensive (595 for 1 year monthly updates), limited
universe (1700) stocks and info not timely, but i always check current figures.
2) Zacks Research Marvel - contains not only historical numbers but earnings
estimates. With monthly updates, fairly timely information (i use to drive my
batch extracts and update my own data base). I have found it relatively
difficult to use. I am not sure what it costs, as i got it as part of package
deal with online access.
3) American Assn Individual Investors Stock Investor. Very complete like maybe
7000+ companies and has mucho data on each - neat comparisons to industry and
sector. This is the least expensive of the three. I find it moderately
difficult to use, but you can compute fields fairly easily and write about any
query you like. They do provide some real good prototype queries that might
interest you as you are just starting out (like Peter Lynch, value, growth,
etc). Major negative is that data only updated quarterly, so it's somewhat out
of date. I recently saw they have a monthly update version, but i believe it's
on Win95 and i have not pursued.

Rick Storm: re. your past post asking for competitors to DRKN:

In bedliners (pickup truck accessories), DRKN has #1 marketshare - according to
DRKN. No. 2 is Penda (privately held).
In towing and vehicle recovery, the big crowbar is Miller Industries hq'd in
Ooltewah (TN -g- of course -g-); they are aggressively buying small
competitors, and they are going heavily into emergency towing sevices. A very
tough competitor. No. 2 in mkt sh. according to DRKN is ... DRKN (which as we

Vulcan (both privately held) and there are others also of course as we can

Advanced Deposition Technologies (NASDAQ:ADTC) is a technology
development company which appears to be on the brink of a period of
rapid growth in revenues and profits.

The Company has been focusing its development efforts on "standard
and proprietary metallized films for energy management applications".
Until recently, ADTC's primary customers have been manufacturers of
electronic capacitors.

However, a search for "higher value-added products utilizing its
proprietary technology." has opened up a variety of applications, one of
which is rapidly becoming more fully commercialized - the "Brown &
Crisp" microwave cooking bag. In addition, the Company has also
identified a number of other promising applications which could become
commercially successful in the relative near term.

ADTC has a strong position in the technologies which underly these
applications, through patents, industry recognition, proprietary
manufacturing facilities and marketing relationships.

Since the Company experiences significantly higher gross margins from
sales of this proprietary product, its sales growth should translate into
significantly improved earnings.

A complete, in-depth Analysis of ADTC can be found on the Napeague
Web Site at http://www.napeague.com . The Napeague Letter will
continue to follow ADTC and will update this Analysis whenever new
information becomes available.

thanks for your help. i was drawn to drkn. because of its value, but being a

Jerr-Danns on the highway and felt this business was stable; but since I have
little time for due diligence; I havent read their ten K etc and honestly,
plead sloth; sounds like part of their business is cylclical, and the growth of
trucks?? and the the towing part is under attack,causing growth to be a
concern--so I ve done nothing! What I have been trying to follow given limited
time is columbia healthcare-- they are certainly the largest for profit
hospital chain in the country with revs up to 20 Bill, but, they are accused of
over billing medicare; and the justice dept has been gathering records; there
have been 3 indictments so far; but top
management

has so far not been implicated; the ceo scott,resigned last
week. What makes this interesting to me is that , while the stock price has
suffered and the tale of woe is far from over, that this company is in the
forefront of healthcare consolidation and cost cutting, while I leave out the
questions of ethics and the larger issue of quality patient care(which is a
major social issue). I see the govt and private insurers wanting cheaper care,
and I cant see them crippling this giant, so fines, ?prison, but in the end
consolidation will move forward and alto growth may slow and margins may
suffer; growth will continue; if more scare stories come out and damage control
is poor, then the weak holders will flee and perhaps I can buy this stock
cheaply; I realize bottom fishing is filled with danger; and have not addressed
the larger question of how badly damaged the quality of our medical system,
will be by this general trend------thanks, for listening

Rick: let's talk about some ideas to think about re investing strategy:

First of all we all have to do what works for us, what we are comfortable with
- and we all seem to have different ways of achieving our goals (if we've been
smart enough to even have thought about establishing investing goals).

I purchased DRKN under this premise: "Superior stock selection does not lead to
superior portfolio results". (Possibly a counterintuitive idea for those who've
been successful in other facets of their lives -g-) It is not necessary to
completely understand the business or the competitive environment. It is enough
to know that the stock is undervalued (fundamentally) based on it's history,
and that the company is viable (growing). The managers should be able to
recover (pun-g-) the price of the stock. My tactic is to give it 3 yrs. (and
try not to lose patience - which is hard for me to keep), and to select a
number of these downtrodden-type companies. So I am playing a percentage,
statistical game. That is, as you might surmise from reading my posts, I own
more than just 8 or 9 stocks. (Unlike W.Buffett who knows everything about his
few companies and can talk with senior managers at any time). There are some
downsides to this approach of course: it can degenerate into sloth, into not
knowing what is generally known and should be known about the direction of the
co. or industry, and if DRKN goes to $30/sh (which I am not at all expecting of
course) - it's not going to be enough to make a difference in my
life/lifestyle.

I think it's germane to talk about this now because my ideas here are directly
counter to ideas I think Bob Davis of Napeague Letter might espouse. Here you
have someone who believes in superior research and obtaining in-depth knowledge
and gathering and focusing information to make conclusions about just a few
stocks.

For me, I try to figure out what could work for me. Reading summaries of
O'Shaugnessy's work (the SI thread is "What Works on Wall Street"), my
interpretation of one money manager's ideas (see my post #1406 here), other
info. I've come across ("Keys to Picking Stocks: sense, alertness, a plan" -
'selecting individual stocks is less important than properly allocating your
portfolio - Glassman interview in Wash. Post 6/1/97) -- these are recent
articles that support the strategy which I keep returning to and refining over
many years. (The articles support it- don't prove its validity--- but at least
there are some apparently successful managers out there who say they invest
somewhat in the way I've described for DRKN)

Not trying to convince you of my methods - just trying to explain how DRKN
could work for me. We all have our ways and our own path to follow.

5) In todays market a company that still has true value to it.

Jim,

Just hope you can avoid more. I worry constantly about skin cancer as I'm fair
skinned and have spent my life working and playing outside. Now, every mole
that looks wrong or any suspicious skin rash gets attention.

I didn't get hurt too badly today, down a little across the board with only one
+ sign. Just Luck I didn't get burnt worse. I had been playing it pretty hard
the last few months and decided to take some profits. I'm finding nothing I
want to buy so I'm down to my long term holds and a little cash left over. If
this drop had happened a week ago, ouch.

It didn't appeal to me (not much is), but I believe you have a winner in the
VUPDA/MOOV. When they combine buying power and quit competing it should make
for major profit improvement. Only down now because no decent movies and
another case of market over-reaction to lower earnings announcement. I looked
at it a long time and decided to pass. Doing a lot of that lately.

From the tone of this thread and
the e-mail my web site has generated,
I get the feeling that a lot of value
investors are now or have been frustrated
at the lack of quality stocks meeting
traditional value criteria. I know I'm spending
a lot of time looking at smaller and smaller
market caps with questionable management. I worry
about the large caps that are falling or
underperforming -- after all, if they can't
do well in this market with mutual funds
stuffing money into anything that's liquid
and has propspects, how will they do in
a bear or sideways market? That liquidity
cuts both ways.

At what level would value investors re-enter
this market? I would buy Coke at 30-35 and
Gilette at 50ish. That leaves a lot of room
for a fall once the momentum turns down --
who will be the buyers to give the 10-15%
growers valued at 40-50 X earnings and 10-15
X sales some support?

One would expect that at these market heights,
this thread would be dead. It's a tribute
to the contributors that they are still
finding solid values here and there. I can't
wait to see what this thread is like when
the market has corrected 25-30%.

Read your post with interest because I'm noticing the same thing.
I look at the thread and see it reduced to arguments about the qualities of the
few stocks that are introduced. Far different from even 2-3 weeks ago when
there were many interesting stocks being touted. I've been doing the same as
you. I've looked at and rejected what seems like hundreds of stocks in the last
2 weeks and am finding nothing I feel good about. I am usually pushed out on
margin and now it's covered and some cash left over. I'm holding stocks that I
normally would have taken profits on because they have some left in them.

Does the inability of a few value investors to find decent buys indicate we are
in for a correction? I hope so.

Michael; You realize that in the last year we already had "two"
corrections, "about 20% if added together" and the market came
roaring back..at the worst now I see 7000 as a support level,
the chances of it going below that are very very slim.
If it were to go below that and any bears started showing glee
they would be taking their life in their own hands. I can't
remember reading about any one who rejoiced over a big market crash
and lived very long to brag about.
The ones who so called predicted the last few should be wealthy as
all get out..but they are sucking hind tit.
The kind of 25% to 30% crash you are talking about if it happened
all at one time, the markets would close, and you would not get
to buy fraz on the bottom. The mutual funds would pick up all
the bargains before your bid was even looked at.
Shorts would get bought in before it was half way down, ( stock
available for borrowing gets called in a crash, it's a pipe dream
for thoes who think they can short and ride the market down )
As stocks are sold off, ( what is out on loan has to come in,
and brokers don't need your OK to buy you in, when stock is called
that happens hand in hand with it.
If your frozen because you belive a big crash is comeing, what you
might save has already been made, heck the bulls can ride a 30%
down turn and still be ahead. The bears have lost their shirt
in the last two years..way worse than in any market crash on
record.
I'm cautious and not running with the momentum buyers, but I'm
fully invested, at my age 60% is in bonds, only 15% in stocks
the rest is cash and hard assets such as local real estate.
BTW local real estate "IF" you look good for bargans , is one of
the best investments you can make. Doing the leg work and getting a release on
a confused deed, can pay off very good.
You don't want real-estate that's over valued just like you don't
want stocks that are over valued, find neglected real estate in a "growing"
area, and track down the owners. More often than not it's not up for sale
because they don't know how to sell it.
Stocks are not the only way to make a little money. I'm working on
one now that if I get it, it will be about 3 bagger in 6 months,
or at least a double.
For me Value investing is just buying something for less than it's
book value, it's assets and or cash on hand add up to more than the
price.
Jim
PS. not long ago this thread was looking like a "growth" thread
and not a value one. BTW look at IPT..don't worry if it goes
down some more..keep enough back to buy more of it, were else
you going to make 18% dividend even if the stock don't go up,
it's now selling just a tad above book value.

James,

In no way do I expect a 25-30% crash
in one session. My thoughts are
outlined at
http://www.exchange2000.com/~wsapi/investor/Subject-16381

It's just interesting that value ideas
have become excruciatingly hard to find --
the ones that are found seem to run up
within a few months, if not days. None
of this slow steady movement up. Geez,
look at what Berkshire Hathaway has done
just in the last 6-7 mos. You buy a severely
undervalued stock like WHX at 5 and set
a 2-3 year target of 10-15. It hits 10
in 2 mos. Others have doubled or run up
>50% in days.

Certainly an interesting situation. I
must admit I shorted Spiders last week.

I'm glad I found this thread; for I am a value investor. I'm mostly short in
this market, but I do have two longs, which I consider to be cheap and
attractive to value investors: Seagate Technology and C- Cube Microsystems (
CUBE ). I've bought both considerably cheaper than where they are today. But I
still love both of them. SEG is trading at about 1.15 price to sales ratio,
which I think is extremely reasonable, from a value point of view. I specialize
in stocks that have been crushed and are ready for a turnaround. In the case of
SEG and CUBE, the turnaround has already taken place and, in my humble opinion,
further dramatic gains are ahead, in the short term! I welcome your thoughts (
including criticism ) on the prospects of SEG and CUBE. If there is a
correction, I am almost certain that SEG ( if not CUBE ) will outperform, then
rally dramatically. Be good.

Hi Maurice - If you are looking for a value tech stock, consider SGI (Silicon
Graphics). I posted my BUY report here when it was around $13 about 3 months
ago and it's now sitting solidly around $25-$27. The growth numbers the company
is giving are very conservative. About 80% of everything they shipped last
quarter was their new product line. They are moving from graphics systems to
database and internet servers. Servers went from about 15-20% of revenues last
year to about 50% this FY and they only shipped the new products for 2
quarters. There is still lots of upside from here. I just bought more last
week. I will be posting my lit review for the year on the SGI thread as soon as
I finish this post. There should be enough excitement here to keep your blood

Value Line shows book of about 10 -- far diff. from what I saw using 2 on-line

Don't ever trust the market caps or # of shares outstanding.

A lot of the on-line sources routinely give wrong or mistaken numbers for the
number of outstanding shares and therfore wrong market caps. I've found the
error rate is between 5-10% of small cap stocks have these numbers reported
wrong, mostly because of recent offerings, acquistitions, warrant and preferred
conversions etc.

Also I've found that in order to get a decent estimate of market cap, you
really have to read the SEC docs and adjust for all the options outstanding,
preferred etc. I think the way the number of outstanding shares are reported is
disgusting. It really takes a lot of work to find out how many shares will
exist if the stock climbs 20-50% from current value, and as investors, that's
what we really want to know.

I really think the FASB was on to something with their concerns about how
incentive options are reported. I don't think their proposed rule was the right
answer, but I wish the companies were required to report clearly how many
shares will likely exist at various price points in each 10Q and 10K.

One of the early stocks mentioned on this thread was BHE, a contract
electronics manufacturer, and the outstanding shares were improperly reported
by almost all the standard services, because of a secondary offering. (BTW- the
stock has almost doubled from when it was mentioned here.)

Paul: re numbers on NWS.
This is an ADR and IMO the chances of any consistency are nill. The following
are some of the variables:
1 ADR vs total company. Some services just report on the entire company and vl
reports only on that part specific to ADR's
2 US dollars vs Australian dollars. Value line reports in us dollars,
converting at .75.
3 US-GAPP vs A-GAAP, the accounting rules are apparently different.
4 New debt issued - vl has suspended rating since NWS issued limited voting
perferred. Impact unknown on #shares.
5 Non-recurring items - unknown, but could very well impact the computations -
vl backs out and excludes non-recurring, which, IMO, most other reporting
services do not.
6 As someone else mentioned, there can be errors in the reporting of the eps
and the number of shares are not as constant as most people think
7 Some services report trailing (last 12 months) and other future (estimated
next 12 months). These can easily get mixed up when there is no way to check
them on an ADR.

Since they are a ADR, their SEC filings are non-existent, so you cant check the
source. I own NVTSY (Novartis) and BTI (BAT Industries) ADRs and have the same
problems trying to get data - it just doesn't exist in the usual timely manner.
And if it does, you still have to figure out what basis it's on.

Based on my experience, I'd trust value line. On the report dated may 30, 1997,
with price at 18 trailing pe of 20.7 and their own pe (prior 6 mo + future 6
mo) of 17.6. Book value per adr for 1996 is 7.53 and estimated 1997 is 9.70.

Vl also indicates that NWS is completing a great year and next year will make
for tough comparisons. Long term as satellite-televison kicks in they are
positive on the stock, with worthwile appreciation potential, although risky -
conservative investors should look elsewhere.

Using the same source (value line) on the same basis (see 1-5 above), NWS does
have a low, but not the lowest pe. Using latest prices, in pe sequence for
industry nwspaper:
Tic Company Trailing PE
1) MEGA Media General 16.93
2) PTZ Pulitzer Publishing 17.26
3) NWS News Corp 18.88
4) WPO Washington Post 19.30
--------
NWS has the lowest safety rating (4) and the lowest 3-5 year estimate eps
growth (6.5), according to value line estimates.

All data is from Value Line CD i just received and installed on Friday.

My approach to these kinds of stocks is that I have to really like it to put up
with this nonsense - there are too many other stocks that dont have this
problem. I wont buy based on numbers when I cant check those numbers. I'll pass
on this one.

My opinion only.

Re: your NEWS CORP. post. I would do a little more research than looking at a 3
month old VL.

1) Most analysts are predicting $1.40 for fy98,,that gives you 12eps. However
many analysts feel it will be much higher.

2) You are looking at an outdated VL where the stock price was $21, wheras the
stock has since declined to the BARGAIN BASEMENT PRICE of $17.5.

3) You don't evaluate a company that has just done several acquisitions on
current earnings projections, since the acqirer has not had the oppurtunity in
bringing out the value thru cost reductions restructuring etc etc , and the
future potentials are much higher.

4) The breakup value is much higher than the 17.5 ticker price. (maybe double
or triple

5) You have no other stock in the industry that is trading at this
eps multiple and at almost an all time low, when the doubled. What we are now
seeing is the runup in those undervalued oldtime bluechips. (Chrysler, GM, RJR
Nabisco, Westinghouse, etc etc.).

6) The analysts have started there upgrades. Jp Morgan upgraded last friday
with a 23 target price soon. Watch for the rest to follow.

7) The risk is minimul with a $10 book value good earnings 500 mil share (with
1/3 by Murdoch), there is no big downside risk at 17.5 however the upside is
huge.

I have spotted several of these undervalued stocks in the last few months (ie
Chrysler at 28, Best Buy at 8, RJR at 29, British steel at 23, and many more
and have posted these same thoughts then) the rest is history.

Appreciate your taking the time to solidify the numbers and explain the

I think you've summed it up for me pretty well. I can't understand the numbers
on NWS (but I do like the low stock price for this behemoth company); I don't
think master entrepreneurs like Murdoch are necessarily positives for the
individual investors in their stocks (these guys build empires... not
necessarily great stocks); I've been around too long to succumb to the belief
that there is no further downside (in spite of new buy recommendations by
prestigious investment bankers), and so I have nothing to hang my hat on if NWS
turns against me... nor can I figure what a good upside price is if it rises.
Have to pass on it. (Had same problem (data info) with NVTSY - but at least
there I could see possibilities. Ultimately passed on it as I'm overweighted in

I am talking about the print image of the page downloaded from the cd i

service (Value Line For Windows i think it's called) that once a month sends a

<Secondly, have you checked the analysts est. on first call lately which give

the server was down. Later i checked and i think that you have the estimate
right - i am not sure i believe it (my opinion) and are you sure it's in US$
and not $Australian? See what i mean? When i see a wide variance between vl and
consensus i doubt them both. The sticking point is how good next year will be,
when compared to a really good this year. That's where i think vl and others
part company. Me also.

Also, while i was there (zacks online subscriber service) I noticed that Zacks
earnings/momentum model rates it a 4 (mild sell) and that NWS missed the last
quarter zacks consensus by -12%. Neither are good.

I also checked it out with Marty Zweig's Performance Rating Report (paper) and
he rates it a 4 on scale of 1-9 with 1 best, so a bit better than a hold
(average).

<Thirdly, I don't understand why your personal bad experience with adr's should

my bad experience with adrs - i love em (at least the ones i've got) - bought
NVTSY @60 a few months ago and it's now around 80 and i bought BTI for overseas
diversity. Checkout paul's message. On neither one could i do my normal number
crunching.

<Fourthly, what do you do with the JP MORGAN UPGRADE on Friday?> Come on - is
ATTRACTIVE it's highest rating? I doubt it. That's what zacks on-line has from
them. IMO, their job is to move stocks, so i prefer to checkout with other

There is a potential value play in Station Casinos (STN). Closed at 7 1/4
Friday. I would like to see further analysis from anyone who'd care to look at
it.

on 35.3 M common shares, they have
assets of 1.304 Billion vs liabilities of 1.015 Billion (from 10-Q)
Book value is somewhere between 5.53 (at least 6 mos. out of date from Zacks)to
8.89 [Smart Money gave a P/B of .9 at share price of 8]
$49 M in cash (from 10-Q)
$86 M in total current assets (from 10-Q)
Sales of $173 M (from 10-Q)
P/S of .55 (last four quarters)
P/cash flow of 4.9 (from Aug. Smart Money...)

They posted a loss this past quarter; I think mostly due to their expansion
over the past year from 3 casinos to 5. Revenues are growing healthily. It is
trading at 13.9x next year's earnings, average for the industry is 18.2x (from
www.Stocksmart.com). 1997 earnings were .18/sh, expectation is .52/sh in 98
[has come down steadily from high of .91], .84/sh in 99.

One thing I have not figured out how to take in to account is the effect of the
outstanding preferred stock (STNp) which carries a quarterly dividend of .875
and is trading around 41.

Hi Paul - I am accumulating EN long-term. I plan to hold for 5-10 years. I
doubled my position after the price dropped due to the drop in gold prices.
Here are the biggest reasons I like the stock:

1. Central banks continue to dump gold but can only do this for so long. This
is keeping gold prices down but there continues to be pretty significant
disparity between gold mined and demand.

2. EN decided to contract out development of the Ken Snyder mine in Nevada
which is one of the richest deposits in the world. Usually they sell the stake
to one of the big mining companies and get a royalty. When it comes on line
next year, mining costs are estimated to be around $80/oz. Their other mines
average probably in the $150-$200 range which is still very low. Overall, some
gold mines (particular S. African) have production costs in excess of $300/oz.
When this mine starts producing, EPS is estimated to increase significantly
(like a factor of 5-10!).

3. The company remains undiscovered since it's only traded in Toronto. There is
talk it might be traded on the NYSE soon.

Entertainment section on Film Financing entitled "Movie Crazy on Wall Street -
Investors are line up to pay first and get paid last."

Long story short, somebody (i think citibank) has came up with idea that the
studios sell their next three year production of movies to outside investors
and banks. Then the studios get reimbursed for their (maybe somewhat creatively
large) expenses and most of the profits, paying back the original financers
after they have their cut.
Their evaluation: 'a sweetheart deal' for the studios, particularly Fox with
two megaflops in Volcano and Speed 2 and Titanic (budget $300M) being delayed
until xmas. No sweat, it's not their money, and most important, off balance
sheet - great use of OPM (other people's money) from the companies standpoint.

James,

It appears from watching the financial shows this weekend that you aren't alone
in your thinking. Every fund manager and analyst interviewed is expecting a
brief market pull back lasting 2 weeks to as long as 2 months, then strong with
another weakening in Dec. It's rare that you see so much agreement, even from
the strong bulls. If they are all saying this, then it's likely to happen.

It would probably hit the high fliers but have little impact on the mid and
small cap markets and there won't be that many buy opportunities as there were
in the last 'correction'.

I think its a common problem we are all having with the ADR's, the nbrs
available are unreliable since there is no need for the company to file
quarterly reports in the US, therefore the nbrs are difficult if not impossible
to convert (depending on the country HQ). I bet there are some real bargins out
there, but at least for me its a bit of a guessing game...
How about Hollinger(HLGRF), a related play to News Corp, some good value that I
believe Conrad Black will bring out?

I am holding a small position in C-Cube, but I do not think it is a value play
at the moment (although I would love to have someone convince me it was). I
would call it an out of favor growth stock. The best value stock I held was SGI
until they blew out earnings ;-). Now they look like an in-favor growth stock
(yes I am still holding).

Seagate I have not had a chance to analyze. But it looks like it may be
undervalued.

For consideration of thread.

Am not touting, but I feel SWST and AMTD to be good growth investments as their
price has fallen off last few days and are at a good buy-in levels. Each are
financially sound and showing excellent growth. SWST is definitely undervalued
to sector, AMTD selling at a high trailing PE until one looks at the growth and
reads 10Q. IMO - SWST will gain about 25% to $28-30 and AMTD 30% to $25-26
after next Q reports.

For what it's worth,

To anyone interested,

I'd like an opinion.
I've found myself in the curious position of
being nearly 100% invested in value stocks,
but so bearish on the market that I am
30% short S&P depository receipts (on
margin). This seems incredibly speculative --
not a place I want to be. Nevertheless,
I can't bring myself to sell my longs
given the value. Any comments/opinions
on this strategy? My own criticism is
that it seems to rely on me calling the
next bottom.

1. If you're very sure the market will tank SHORT TERM, only rational response
is to sell the value stuff now, which is primarly chosen to appreciate LONG
TERM and can be purchased cheaper later.

2. If you're very sure the market will appreciate you should cover your short.

3. If you're not so sure (which apparently you're not) some form of heding is
appropriate. The form of hedging you chose makes perfect sense because of the
reseacrh you presumably put inot the stocks you bought. Hopefully your research
means that your stocks will ourpferm the overall market, in good times or bad,
so why sell them unless category 1 applies?

I don't see much else here.

Thanks for the feedback. I was just
trying to bring out different strategies
for value investors to play a significant
market downturn.

Other options for the value investor
at these market heights:

1) stay 100% long and raise cash
at target prices; moratorium
on buying -- for how long?

2) continue on business-as-usual
despite the market -- will likely
raise cash due to scarce new
buys -- the "natural" value-based
bear market strategy

3) Buy portfolio insurance in
the form of S&P index puts --
worsened the 1987 crash

4) Sell short SPDR's --
high capital requirements

5) Short the overpriced leaders
like Coke, Gilette -- problem
is they're good companies

6) Short tech stocks with
astronomical PSR's/PE's

7) Selling current true
values -- just doesn't
make sense to do this
on a hunch.

Other ideas welcome.

Anyone follow Telular (WRLS)? The stock trades about 2.5. The CEO said next
qtr's revs will be between 11-18 million. Revenue is about double from last
year. MOT owns 15% of WRLS & is on the board of directors. WRLS just signed a
licensing agreement with a major Telcom equip co. and have negociations ongoing
with eight others. (Already have one with MOT) MOT has committed 100 million in
sales to WRLS by 1/99.
The potential market for fixed wireless is in the billions. It is small at
present and WRLS has about 60% share.
The only negatives I see is that last qtr was bad. Not widely followed.

2.5. Any opinions

Michael,

I use the strategy 2, but then I am not totally
"value" investor. I like to buy companies with < 1.5 PSR,
and I try to select them using quasi-Buffett criteria
(understandable business, strong franchise, low competition,
high expected growth, good management, market leadership,
high margins, low debt, non-commodity).

My current portfolio is: ASYT GGNS PEP
QKTN UTEK WFR. As you see, I am very partial to the
semi-equipment companies and I hold PEP as a blue chip hedge
and a spin-off play.

Good luck

Network Imaging Corporation Announces $2.25 Million In Software Sales to
Telecommunications Market

HERNDON, Va., Aug. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Network Imaging Corporation
(Nasdaq:IMGX) today announced that two of its largest customers, both
telecommunication industry leaders, signed significant upgrade contracts in Q1
and Q2
for a combined total of $2.25 million in software sales. The contracts are a
result of Network Imaging's aggressive focus on vertical markets, of which
telecommunications is considered an important strategic target. One of the
customers is
a $23 billion corporation which designs, develops and manufactures
communications
systems. The company uses Network Imaging's 1View suite of imaging,
workflow, and engineering document management software products to automate its
manual and semi-automatic legacy information systems. These systems,
controlled by the 1View technology, are critical to the engineering and
maintenance of
the telephone switching centers the company serves.

Another customer, a major local exchange carrier with 1996 revenues of over $19
billion, has employed the 1View products for automatic routing and approval
of engineering work orders to outside plant engineering centers. The
implementation of
Network Imaging's technology has enabled the company to reduce costs
and job completion time in serving customers. Subsequently, the company's
customer
service performance has been recognized by J.D. Power & Associates and
the American Society for Quality Control for surpassing all other local
telephone services
on the American Consumer Satisfaction Index.

``We are excited by the benefits these telecommunications customers have
derived from
our technology. The scalability of our 1View products allows us to easily
support their desired expansion,'' said Jim Leto, president and chief executive
officer of
Network Imaging. ``Our 1View technology is uniquely capable of
managing high volumes of large scale engineering documents, which are central
to
telecommunications businesses. These customers have told us that the 1View
suite has made their daily engineering operations more efficient. They are able
to conduct
business in a more cost-effective manner, while completing projects in
shorter periods of time.''

About 1View

The 1View suite, which is comprised of 1View:Object Manager(TM),
1View:Workflow(TM), 1View:COLD(TM) (Computer Output to Laser Disk),

Hi Mike - I share with all !

>Are any of you willing to reveal your portfolios,
>or at least the stocks you're holding, buying,
>selling, and considering in this market.

Fisher method stocks:
SGI - Accumulating. Still not too late.
Turned around, still reviled by funds. Average cost $20
COHU - Holding. Average cost $24
AMAT - Holding but running scared. Average cost $35

An experiment but not quite a fisher stock:
KMAG - Accumulating, Excellent management, hyper cyclical industry.

Long term buy and hold growth stocks. held most >3 years already, plan to hold
5-10 years. I don't know average costs of the top of my head.
TXI - Accumulating. Flat last year. Next year should be much better.
EN - Accumulating. Bought a bunch after the reverse gold panic from Bre-X and
the drop in gold price. Not your typical gold company. Undiscovered. Ignore the
high PE.
OLS - Accumulating. Taking lower margins temporarily to gain market share.
Bought a bunch at $16.
ROG - Accumulating. Company got on track a few years ago and never looked back.
Undiscovered.
RGC - Accumulating. Undiscovered.
NUE - Accumulating. Unions and excellent management have virtually guaranteed
they will be #1 in the next 2 years. Analysts haven't figured out US borders
won't contain them.
HCCC - Accumulating. Misclassified with the HMO's.

"Accumulating" means I'd buy if my portfolio is not out of balance buying more
and the price is right.

The only sales this year were:
APCC - Fisher stock that got hit it's PSR top. Bought last July for $9, sold in
January for $27 (thanks again Paul!).
CEMX - My experiment with microcaps that are controlled by MMs. Small loss.
TNH - Sold after holding for several years for more than a double. Worried
about remaining shares being bought by parent company at a prenegotiated price.

The first group is where the excitement is. I will hold these until PSR gets
too high AND the stock exhibits volitility. The second group is rather boring
and often ignored stuff that just keeps going up long-term.

Across the entire portfolio, I believe in the Peter Lynchism "Don't buy what
you don't understand" which explains the weird mix. I work in high-tech but
anybody can understand steel, paper and cement!

Jeff

I'll take you up on that

Ambac (ABK) - municipal bond insurance - long term hold, probably a bit ahead
of itself now, but I don't want to pay capital gains tax. Phenomenal long term
story, but it will take some research to understand the accounting. Look for
12x earnings (its now 15x)

Clayton Homes (CMH) - manufactured housing - broke out on the upside today. Not
a buy now, but not a sell either.

General Mills (GIS) - I bought it well. The P/E looks high, but understand the
business. Long term hold, and I still consider it reasonably priced.

Nu-Kote (NKOT) - printer cartridges - an absolute disaster, but too cheap to
sell. I thought I was a genius when I got in at 6. It fell below $1 a week ago,
but I was too scared to buy more. Now its 2. (just to show that I'm not just
putting up my winners just to look good)

Jenny Craig (JC) - another dog. I'd buy this one at 7 if I didn't already own
it at 8.

Red Roof Inns (RRI) - hotels - trading at the value of the real estate, but
there had been a lot of construction in their market. Be careful, but it has
seriously underperformed in the last year. Pretty good business.

St. Joe Corp. (SJP) - Florida real estate - quite simply, the best value play I
have ever seen. But that was at 65, before a $10 dividend (now its 83, 9 months
later) Its still a buy, but not a steal.

Silicon Valley Group (SVGI) - semicon manufacturing equipment - a double in the
last year. you're two months late.

Tejon Valley Ranch - (TRC) - California land. this one ran from 19 to 27 in a
week two weeks ago and has come all the way back to 22. Its worth 30-35. Very
similar to St. Joe. Study the news releases on this company over the last six
months and the story should jump right out at you. This one's a buy if you're
patient.

WHX Corp. - steel - courtesy of Mike Burry, except I understand he sold it too
soon. Its still cheap. Trades at 10 with a 25+ book value. Its probably worth
15 and will get there in the next six months.

There you have it. I'd love to see some of the other respected friends I've
made on this site do the same.

OBVIOUSLY, I HAVE NO INSIDE INFORMATION ON ANY OF THESE. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT
IF YOU LOSE MONEY ON THEM I DO TOO. DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT IT OTHERWISE.

Mike,

I almost forgot why I visited your Forum. Some time ago I posted some
information about Marlton Technologies (AMEX:MTY) and one of your regulars
"rebutted" my points.

Tonight, I thought it might be worthwhile to tell you all that for the tenth
consecutive quarter (excluding extraordinary items), MTY has once again
announced revenue and earnings increases.

Today's Press Release announced;

- A 40% increase in EPS for the quarter, to $.07 from a prior year
$.05, which beat the TNL projection of $.06 for the quarter.
Revenues increased 18%.

- A 60% increase in backlog versus the prior year - and backlog is a
pretty good indicator of upcoming revenues for MTY.

- For the six months YTD, the Company also reported a 40% increase in
EPS after factoring out tax adjustments and a non-recurring gain in
1996, on a 27% increase in revenues.

The complete press release can be found at

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/97/08/13/mty_1.html

In spite of this growth, MTY is very undervalued. MTY closed today at
4 7/16, giving it a price-earnings ratio of 13 - the Business Services
sector trades at a multiple of 35. If MTY was selling at that multiple, its
market price would be around $12.00.

Marlton is currently relatively unknown within the investment community, but
there are reasons to believe that this is about to change:

- Legg Mason, a well respected regional investment banking and brokerage
firm is working with The Company on its current acquisition of DMS.
This could lead to stronger analyst and retail support for the stock
in the very near future.

- MTY has just begun working with a small but reputable investor
relations firm, to generate the first real institutional interest
in the stock. I have personally received feedback from the investment
community that this effort is beginning to generate institutional
interest.

- The acquisition of DMS, which will be finalized shortly, should bring
Marlton close to the $100 million revenues level, which will create
much more visibility for the Company.

The price of Marlton's stock has already begun to rise. Since the
beginning of June, which is about when I posted about the Company on this
Forum, MTY has risen from $3.37 to its close today at $4.44,
a 32% increase in less than three months.

And there is no sign that this move is about to come to a halt. Technically,
momentum-based indicators are signaling that this move continues to build
strength and that the stock is not "overbought". Volume-based indicators
continue to indicate that MTY is being "accumulated".

The Company just received a major, and very positive, write-up in the
Philadelphia Inquirer's Business Section, which stated that "Marlton's
revenues are growing at a double-digit rate in part because the Company
has a reputation for being able to create one-of-a-kind displays that
grab attention". This entire article can be found at

http://www.phillynews.com/inquirer/97/Aug/04/business/MARL04.htm

Hi Mike: I've put out my ideas (stocks I've been buying and selling)- for most
of what I've been doing - Doesn't seem that the choices have been very popular
or profitable for others. :>( Nevertheless, even though I am an expert stock
picker -g-, the thread is indeed very fortunate to have a group of very
superbly talented (or lucky -g-) people who have been willing to share and who
have really helped all of us increase both our prowess and our profits.
I still own all the stocks which I've said on the thread that I bought. My
intention has been and is, to discuss my stock buys only once then move on -
unless someone picks up on the stock (like DRKN, which you all are probably
sick of by now -g-); In total, I have more than 40 different issues distributed
over several portfolios. If someone has read the thread and read my posts,
they've seen my ideas, so I'm reluctant to go over each stock again.
Selectively though, here is some info. which I have not posted:

I've added to a long-term position in BMY this week, as the stock has dropped
from a very lofty multiple to just lofty. Also I have added a little last month
to my position in BLOCA which I've owned for several years also. I've sold half
of my short-term stake in GBOT which I thought could be a value stock, but now
I'm not sure is. At current prices, I've recently added just a very little to
my position in SRM. (original stake purchased at much higher prices.) I hold
KLM and several regional bank stocks (yield plays). In the contract
manufacturing sector -followed by many on this thread also, I too have been
adding to my positions in SFLX below 11 and ELAMF when it bottomed out a few
months ago. (I've provided this thread with my write-up of ELAMF last year).
I'm selling scale-up out of long-term positions in WNC and averaging down into
BNO (bought more BNO this week). I took profits in some ABT @ 63 level last
month.

You can see I have mix of well-known large caps as well as some that are not so
"popular"... or large .

I'm in all these stocks for a bunch of reasons -- some of which I'm not sure I
can explain clearly even to myself. (In other words, I too make no
recommendations here. It's my attempt at a disclaimer...although I like James'
disclaimer better ... )

Somewhere in the last 10 posts there is some very good information. All we got
to do is find it and act on it! regards all, Paul

James S.: I like your TGH. Having some difficulties in analyzing.
Per Yahoo, it looks like the greatest thing since sliced bread. Reading Aug 6
co report, 1.28B in cash on 42M sh. outstanding gives $30/sh in cash with only
$90M ($2.)long term debt. And this debt has increased from almost nothing last
year... why ...with all the cash... and why so much cash at all? Book value
about $20. Zacks says earnings this year and next under $2.00 so ROE is not
going to be 20% unless we use Yahoo figures, which include some gains on sales,
special items?? Co seems to have a lot going for it... biggest, or one of the
biggest, health providers in Virginia; and Blue Shield "brand" francise. That
$30sh/cash on a $23 stock sure looks like a margin of safety. Any info or

Paul,

A quick look at TGH shows that quarterly premium and premium equivalent is
$684,097. The premiums are collected in advance. I do not know the % of
premiums collected quarterly, semi annually and annually. In any event cash
does not seem to be a free give away.

Analysts are rating the Company as buy. In demutualization and IPO
policyholders purchased the shares. These people (insiders?) may not be very
knowledgeable. Formerly Blue Shields were non profit organizations and were
operating inefficiently. As commercial organization TGH will have to compete
against other well run outfits.

I would rate this as failrly valued.

Regards.

Re: Trigon Health (TGH)

The company is an insurer. Yahoo is counting its
float as cash and investments on its balance sheet,
which is true, but misleading because
there are liabilities beyond simple debt against
that float.

Do we look at the float when we look at insurance
companies? Yes, but not to compare the per share
float to the per share price. The float relative
to certain measures is a proxy for the company's
stability in hard times. Berkshire Hathaway keeps
a huge float which allows it to market itself as safer
than other insurers.

The company needs to be valued as an insurance
company -- keeping in mind it provides
a type of insurance that is becoming
more and more competitive. Further,
the industry itself is a shrinking pie.

The latest 10K was just filed today:

Total enrollment is shrinking, and premium
growth is in the single digits.

I'm not an insurance analyst. Can anyone
else familiar with insurers offer his/her
opinion? The company looks fairly valued
to me.

Good Investing,
Michael Burry

All,

Just bought a book called Investment Valuation
by a well-known finance professor at NYU named
Aswath Damodaran. I'm working my way through
it slowly, trying to understand it. Published
by Wiley, 1996. $65, 519 pages.

Just want to recommend it to other value
investors. It addresses just about every
model and valuation topic I've heard about.
Even how to value brand names. Helped
me get rid of one of my holdings, Fortune
Brands.

Good Investing,
Mike

Paul,

The insurance companies are really complicated. HOMS had lots of cash, very
little debt, and big borrowing power when the Guvment shut them down due to
insufficient reserves. Too much exposure.

Lot a people took a bath, almost me. I now leave them to the Pros.

James,

I get $993/acre for Tejon Ranch, in addition to its
recent positive management moves. Cheap enough for
me. I should've bought it when you first mentioned
it at 17. Now at 22-23, it's still a great deal, and
could easily be worth 2-4X this if the real estate
venture along I-5 goes well. IMO, time to buy/add
to position on this pullback. Thanks again.

Good Investing,
Mike
