Hi Madharry -

Re: Carl Icahn = Motorola Inc. (MOT); Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMLN)

Icahn owns large positions in both of these companies. I followed him into both
of them. I am now out of Amylin w/ a good profit (bought at $9.00 and sold at
$14.00). If I held a few more month's. I would have had a double. Amlyn is now
trading around $18.

I am still holding MOT. I got my average cost down to $8.50/share on MOT after
starting my initial buys at $17.50/share (starting in 2007). The ideas is the
company is worth more by breaking it up than as a whole. The last analysis I
read on MOT value was $13-$15 per share. It's probably a bit lower now.

You should do fine with your entry point of $7.08/share. The key is not to sell
too soon like me w/ Amlyn. You did not have to ride the stock down from
$17.00/share to $3.10 and now back to $7.11 like me either. With a run like
that, it can change one's perspective of what fair value really is. I still
think $15.00/share is closer to the "true" fair value than $3.10/share.

WNMLA. Recently I sent the company a nasty-gram complaining about the lack of
financial information, although it was more likely the effect of the 13D
filer's complaints.

In making my purchases, I was betting the stock would trade up when financial
information was released. It has rallied already, so who knows from here, but
it is almost always better to have some information about what you own. Stocks
with no information tend to trade at large discounts. With that in mind, I am
still hoping for a further rally from here.

By the way LOAN is working out and I am taking a few profits. Recently at
1.00/1.01 and now at 1.42, it was one of my best ideas for this year. I still
think it has room to grow, but I bought enough shares that I was almost at 5%
of the company and was worried about filing a 13D if I bought more. It was only
prudent to sell some here.

I reduced Jack as well, luckily before earnings. i did not have that much luck
with IPHS , closed this after earnings. it appears to me that their business is
commodity like than I assumed (the continued pricing pressure is hard evidence
of this). I am also not that convinced that the pricing for their product will
not return to pre Y2008 levels.

Sold HALL as well flat. More intangibles than I assumed. HALL basically trades
around tangible book which is not a good enough value for me currently.

I am watching SRE, the stock is weak after the trading venture with RBS is now
partly dissolved. Apparently SRE will get some funds back (around 900M$) which
is nice but is also means that they will not receive any profits from the metal
trading business either. The US energy trading business is closer but it's not
clear to me what happens - will it get dissolved or will SRE try to own it
outright? it seems that this business has high capital demands, a 2B$ number is
mentioned which means that the unit itself was not standing on it's own but had
standing line of credit from their owners. I think this trading business
generated about 30% of SRE profit and much of this will be gone, I suspect.
Management presentation regarding the JPM sale does not discuss the earning
impact for SRE. very poor disclosure. I bet some analysts figured it out
already and made their bets (short?). I stand on the sideline scratching my

Behind JPMorgan’s Deal With RBS Sempra
February 16, 2010, 8:00 pm

http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/behind-jpmorgans-deal-with-rbs-sem
ra/?partner=yahoofinance

From the article:"...Sempra Energy is a power company that uses its trading arm
to hedge the huge risks involved with selling power to utilities. JPMorgan
offered to give Sempra a small portion of the North American gas and power
trading business, but Sempra refused to go along, according to a person
familiar with the negotiations...."

Like you pointed out Sempra receives a capital infusion from the sale but will
lose the profits from their trading business.

Actually, I like the idea that the company looks like it will exit the energy
trading business so it can better focus on its core businesses. The company
could decide to deploy their refunded capital on a new electric generation
property or plant expansion. Energy demand for Southern CA continues to grow. I
think at some point in the past, Sempra was exploring expanding into Arizona
and or Mexico to build a NG power plant that would service their long term
electric power demands for the company.

Maybe this is the start for this transition. If so, the company could become a
"value" buy on further weakness and the forward profit uncertainty w/o their
energy trading business.

I suppose that's one way to look at it. Another simple analysis might be that
it sells at less than 50% of book value and fairly consistently makes money
every quarter. Based on 2009 there were some segments that seemed
disappointing, while others seemed OK. However a PE ratio of 9X is about the
norm. Gross premiums written were down so one might make the case for "Where is
the growth going to come from?" and one might also say that they were smart to
bite the bullet on certain operations and take the investment loss, but they
always have a loss on discontinued operations and one wonders why? The nature
of their business is a bit different from say and HMN, but HMN has a lower PE,
a lower but good discount to book, and the stock does at least participate in
market advance. PMACA for some reason just does not peak investor interest for
more than a day or two and then sellers seem to knock it right back down. If
anything I may reduce further and hold a token position. Not to sure yet. I
have pretty good positions in AHL and HMN also, so how much insurance exposure
does one really want. If anything I would take off the under performer. I
didn't buy PMACA when it was real low so I'm near flat on my position

PMACA. "Another simple analysis might be that it sells at less than 50% of book
value and fairly consistently makes money every quarter."

Three reasons to buy PMACA seem to be:

1. The thing is selling for way under book value. 50% under is very unusual for
a profitable insurance company.

2. The company is in transition. (Sold its run-off business.)

3. Dale Baker continually recommends it on the 50% Gains thread. His
recommendation is good enough reason for some.

The company earned .66 on its $12.46 of book value. That's 5.3%. Company's been
unprofitable three of past ten years. In the seven years it's had profits, 5.3%
seems to be the highest roe of any year. If earning 5.3% on their equity is the
best & highest figure in a decade, what's going on? The stock deserves to sell
at 50% of book if that's all management can deliver to shareholders.
A counterargument would be, the company IS in transition, roe is improving
(this year anyway), and earnings and bv should/could/might/will continue to
improve.

Too speculative an assumption for me - I can't get past management's ten year
very poor roe and very poor bv history, so I have and will continue to avoid
the stock.

CVU,

I own some CVU after reviewing your prior mention. The stock seems very cheap
from an earnings perspective, and I pondered loading up on it.

However, I put on only a modest position, since stocks with earnings >> cash
flows tend to underperform the market, and this one has had consistently
negative historical cash flows (along with negative cash flows for the
foreseeable future).

I understand that negative cash flows are likely part and parcel of the
business they are in, but still I like to be in situations where historically
the odds are clearly in my favor. That being said, the earnings and story
seemed strong enough to buy some.

Net-net, if you care to continue to post any updates on the stock, that would

Hi Spekulatius - It looks like SRE has decided where to deploy part of that
$850 million capital from their trading division. $300 million to EP for their
Mexican Pipeline Assets.

Sempra Pipelines & Storage Agrees to Acquire Mexican Pipeline Assets
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Sempra-Pipelines-Storage-iw-2430293086.html?x=0

From the article:"..."This acquisition expands our scale and geographic
footprint in one of the strongest growth regions in Mexico, while providing
entry into the emerging propane pipeline business," said George S. Liparidis,
president and chief executive officer of Sempra Pipelines & Storage. "These
pipeline assets are backed almost entirely by long-term contracts and have a
history of delivering solid, predictable revenue streams; allowing us to build
a stronger platform for growth in the country."

The pipeline and natural gas infrastructure assets being acquired are supported
by customer contracts with an average duration of 13 years. The acquisition is
expected to be accretive to Sempra Energy's earnings by $0.05 in 2010 and $0.10
in 2011....".

business to the SRE shareholders? This might make up for the lost revenues from

RE: Sempra Energy (SRE)

Anyone still like SRE on this move?

If Spekulatius is right about a heavy short interest, the stock could go a bit
lower (perhaps in the $45 range) which would really set up as both a swing
trade and excellent LT entry point. Based on valuation, SRE at a 10.4 PE is a
good value but again could change if future earning drop significantly from the
termination of their energy trading division.

If the company announces a dividend increase this may help support the stock
price at current levels. My last buy was 20 years ago when the company was San
Diego Gas & Electric. I would like to add more shares as the potential growth
prospects for NG in Mexico are huge.

FWIW I started a position in Ameren Corporation (AEE) today. It is selling off
after a good run. At prices below $25/share is a good entry point. Dividend
yield 6.1% w/ only a 55% payout ratio, forward PE around 11 and some exposure
to nuclear. There was some discussion about tough regulatory reviews combined
with a dividend cut last March 2009 has impacted the relative strength. I do
look for an eventual reversion to the mean to the $33-$35 price range. If the
company announces a "fast track" schedule for the expansion of their nuclear
capacity and some type of clean coal and/or coal conversion to NG may provide
the LT investor a better outlook on AEE's future.

re AEE. AEE looks cheap (below tangible book) but earnings are pointing lower
for the foreseeable future. You could regard it as a dividend stocks with an
option for a recovery when the economy points up and/or regulates in Missouri
are more friendly towards utilities. This could be a long wait though. In a
similar venue, i like AYE more, because of the merger optionality (with FE) and
friendlier regulators (PA utility arm is doing very well).

SRE earnings may be too high, Barclays revised them down by 10% after about 1/2
the trading business is sold. Another downward revision is likely depending on
what happens to the domestic power trading. Replacing a business with a 20%+
IRR with <10%IRR (if they buy it outright, a little bit higher if they build it
themselves over time) dictates lower earnings. I would like to see some more
color on this, or a higher discount to fair value. I think the utility
operation by itself will only earn 3.5-4$ this year so SRE is not cheap by that
measure.

to the dealer to have it checked on monday morning. i drove for awhile longer
no more problems. later in the afternoon im returning home i make another left
turn and this time instead of turning the car drifts as i lose control of the
car briefly. after that the steering became difficult as i drove slowly to an
area from which i could call a tow truck to get my car and have it towed to the
dealer. it turned out that my control lever had rusted through, and the tow
truck guy said that its possible that had i continued on much furthur that the
wheel could have fallen off.
Anyway it turned out that hyundai was aware of this problem but never thought
it worth issuing a recall. they fixed my car for free but i wrote them a nasty
letter telling them they should have had a recall. a year later they issued a
recall. I guess if enough people die and sue they do it. My nephew had a
similar accelerator problem with a truck shortly after he got his permit or
license. I think it was either ford or gm. the accelerator stuck and he hit
another car. he was severely penalized as a new driver, the insurance company
settled, the car company came out and took the vehicle and according to his mom
the records were sealed. There wasnt a recall on that one either.

UPDATE 1-Fluor Q4 profit falls, cuts 2010 view; shares drop
Thu Feb 25, 2010 4:30pm EST
* Q4 EPS 82 cents vs 88 cents expected by Wall Street
http://www.reuters.com/article/idCNN2512495420100225?rpc=44
From the article:"... Fluor said in a statement that front-end activity
indicated a recovery was on the way and expected capital investment to rebound
"gradually" along with the global economy.

"However, relatively lower new orders in recent quarters and continuing delays
in the full release of major projects is expected to put pressure on 2010
earnings targets," it added.

The company cut its 2010 earnings per share range by 40 cents at both ends to
$2.80 to $3.20. Backlog continued to decline, down to $26.8 billion at the end
of 2009 from $28 billion three months before...."

==============================================================

With their 2010 revision at $3.00/share would make their forward PE at 14 vs
12.5 before the statement. Stock could sell down to $37.5 but I will probable
nibble at some more shares if it drops below $40. The Industry PE is 14 so the
after market sell off to $42.36/share reflects the current Industry PE "fair
value".

Anybody else looking to add shares?

Ultimate Trader. Yes, Value Line. That might work. You get sector analyses and
comparable metrics for individual stocks in a sector on adjacent pages. I can't
suggest anything better. (I don't claim though to be either an expert or
knowledgeable person esp regarding software packages.)

I don't know what data you would be expecting and screening for in a
"fundamental value analysis" package when you dig down into a particular
company and how a software program would compare those metrics and numbers to
another company in the same sector. I know of no program whose software
compares one company to another, metric-by-metric. I have to believe those
programs are out there; I'm just saying I don't know of any.

You also mention comparing sector-to-sector. The research section of at least a
couple of brokerage firms I know of does give sector performance (% up or down
of various sectors for different time periods (e.g. 1 day, ytd, one year) and
for different populations (e.g. how various sectors compare based on Russell
3000, S&P 500, Nasdaq.) How helpful this is regarding your wanting to see "if a
particular sector...is inflated/deflated", I do not know. For example I see
that "telecommunication services" sector in the Russell 3000 is the worst
performing sector based both on ytd and 1 yr. "Consumer Discretionary" the
best. Does that mean "telecommunication services", being the worst sector with
stock performance, is "deflated" and therefore a buy now? Or is the sector
something to be avoided? The broker I am looking at says Standard & Poor's and
Ned Davis Research both recommend "underweight" (as of 2/24/10)for
"telecommunication services". For "consumer discretionary" the recommendations
by these two firms are "market weight" and "overweight", respectively. Of
course for us value investors, without looking at company specific details and
just speaking philosophically, we might be considering doing something opposite
from these two firms' recommendations: i.e. we'd be wanting to buy something
that's undervalued (maybe beat up the most, like "telecom services", and maybe
at the same time be a little more reluctant to buy or hold on to stocks that
have already moved up as in the best performing "consumer discretionary"
sector.

WATG doesn't look that great to me from numbers I'm looking at from the
quarterly report.

$9.11/.82 = p/e of 11.1

Book value: $198.5/33.9M shares = $5.8/sh.

roe: .82/5.8 = 14%

Company is growing or has been growing 50% per year. Company could very well be
"a screaming buy". Given how I look at USA companies (which this is not of
course), suppliers to the auto industry, if they showed the numbers and
percentages above, I'd call their stocks more fair-valued, than underrated.

====
Argh, I really feel incompetent when I come across a simple accounting metric,
and I am surprised how or why it affects my simple calculations the way it can.
To wit: "Year-end (12/31) 2009 weighted average number of shares outstanding
fully-diluted" is (as reported) 27.84M. This number is used to calculate the
per share figure (.82). However, the "issued and outstanding" number of shares
at 12/31/09 is 33,86M. That's on the balance sheet statement, and that balance
sheet number is what I use to calculate book value. The discrepancy between
share counts is because "On November 2009, Wonder Auto closed a follow-on
offering of 6.9 million shares of common stock at a public offering price of
$10.75 per share." So with my use of both outstanding share numbers at the same
time to come up with .82/5.8, that is maybe somewhat screwy. Echh. I'm just
wondering now if I need to be much more careful in general with how I go about
cavalierly calculating book values from balance sheets and eps numbers. Ugh.

Note the stock at $9.11 today is below that $10.75 offering price, so buyers
coming in may feel they are getting a bargain. (They may be.). Otoh, buyers at
$10.75 may be wishing to get out of a losing position.

However anybody views the company, I hope they do okay. I'm going to pass on
this one.

re NAVG - i doubled my position at around 38.4$ today as well. you are correct,
losses do add up but that comes with the territory of buying on the dip.

NAVG book value is around 47.5$, so we get a nice discount of that. the company
has been profitable for many years except in (or about) 2002, and the balance
sheet has moderate leverage (short tail insurance). The negative reserve
revision could be regarded as a one off item but we won't know until next
quarter. i checked NAVG LT track record and it's above average, imo.

Based on what I see, it's a clear cut buy but of course there could be things
that are not evident.

I am surprised that FLR did not get punished more, i have a buy order in below
40$ and I don't think it is worth much more. it feels like analysts are more
forgiving towards FLR earnings miss then they are to many peers, probably
because it's a must have stock in this sector. I am looking at FWLT right now
which seems a cheaper play in the same place (although more volatile).

FLR. The only thing I can tell is that FLWT's expected margins for 2010 will be

CACC. Fwiw, these long-time followers of the company provide a pretty decent
description of CACC's business model:

"Wanted: "Great Business Models, Smart People""
Bradley Purcell and Randall Heck, General Partners, Goodnow Investment Group

" What's to recommend them? Most investors head for the hills when the word
subprime is mentioned.

Heck: Unlike most other lenders in the auto market and certainly in the
subprime arena, Credit Acceptance has a truly unique and successful business
model. They partner with used-car dealerships. Under this partnership, the
dealer is willing to accept an advance payment from Credit Acceptance that is
less than 50 cents on the dollar of the total loan. So Credit Acceptance gets
the advance paid back in its entirety from the car buyer, at which point both
the dealer and Credit Acceptance share the remaining payments on an 80/20
split. The model gives Credit Acceptance a large margin of error. But it also
gives the dealer an opportunity to profitably sell a car that they would not
otherwise sell."...

"The company generates exceptional returns; right now, the return on invested
capital is about 16%, which gives them a return on equity of over 30%.

Add to that an extremely conservative balance sheet for a finance company;
their debt-to-equity ratio is only one-to-one. Finally, Credit Acceptance is
working with just over 2,000 independent used-car dealers, out of an
addressable market of 35,000. So there is plenty of room to grow and, based on
all the field work we've done, the dealer partners think very highly of the
company. We've been involved with this stock for over 10 years. The management
team has delivered phenomenal returns, and yet [the stock] trades at just over
eight times our estimated earnings of $4.80 a share for this year."

"What's the potential downside for the company?

Heck: The critical issues are collections, competition and funding. With
collections they have demonstrated over the last couple of years that their
model really works. As for competition, it's faded or gone away over the last
two years. That won't always be the case because competition will return, to
some extent. But there is no way, in the foreseeable future, that it is going
to get anywhere close to where it was before the crisis. Funding is a risk, but
all of their bank lines have been renewed, and they recently raised over $350
million in additional funding."

http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-02-27/berkshire-discloses-increased-stake
-in-sanofi-aventis-tesco.html

That's an increase maybe. Since public info is delayed, I'm assuming that at
current time, with the stock having moved up from March lows to $41 in Jan.,
that he wasn't actually cutting back his position in past few weeks. Stock's
dropped now to $36.60 (so somebody's sold). Forward p/e 8; div yield 4.3%; roe
not so good at 8-11 percent last few years; decent profit margins though. I'll
hold my shares, and consider adding more. (That p/e seems attractive & one gets
the dividend for waiting.)

I could call SNY a value stock; I can't see it though as a Buffett stock. For a
pharma, how could he understand the pipeline, whether it's good and growing or
not? The public history of the company isn't very long. Perhaps that's not
important: SNY exists and it's a big player. It's had to have had good products
and a good pipeline of drugs to have gotten where it is now.

Hi Paul - Thank's for the Buffet update. I was glad to see Buffet's interest in
Tesco. I knew he upped his ownership in Walmart but did not know he held a 3%
interest in Tesco. I have buys in Tesco on 12/21/2007 and 2/13/2008. It might
be a good time to add a few more shares at current levels as it is 23% lower
from my last buy at $23.70 in 2008.

SNY is 13% lower from my previous sell target level where I neglected to peel
off some shares. I think I closed out my JNJ instead. My SNY gain is now only
up 14% but continues to be a good hold since it pays a 4.5% dividend and sells
at a very low PE vs it's peers. The stock is below it's long term MA and both
in 2006 & 2007 the stock has traded above $47/share. At $36.60/share, SNY
continues to be a good hold for me and I will consider selling some shares once
it approaches the $43/share - $44/share area.

It's hard to peel off a few shares when you do not have very many shares to
start with. Tesco & SNY rank #33 and #37 in my portfolio of 81 securities in my
taxable account. I have been thinking of doubling up my holdings in a fewer
number of positions but I like the diversification of holding several companies
in the same sector.

For example, by owning FLR, SHAW, CBI and ABB my basket of construction
companies continue to do well even though FLR was down over 5% Friday on poor
earnings.

My top 10 holdings represent 45% of the total portfolio value. Over the last
year, I have added to my under valued top 10 positions where I was able to
lower my average cost. This has been a good strategy as many of these buys have
outperformed but has left the portfolio much more concentrated than I would
like.

I wonder if Buffet has experienced the same thing and has established new
positions like in Republic Services Inc. (RSG) that allows him to re-balance
his "outperforming" core positions into brand new holdings.

My top 10-ish positions in no particular order: GTE, GFRE, TIP, GLW, GPOR,
FR-J/K, IACAF, HOG, EMB, IGK/IND, NXY, OXY, PKX, SDTH, JNJ.

New positions: EMB, CELM, NEWN, DYP.
Positions increased: CPBY, NXY, TXIC, FUQI, GEOI, RIG.
Positions reduced: PBEGF, IGK, SPPRO, CHBT.
Positions eliminated: DDR-G, TLM, NBG-A.

Purchases were concentrated in undervalued Chinese companies (CELM, NEWN, DYP,
CPBY, TXIC, FUQI) and cheap oil related companies (RIG, NXY, GEOI).

I reorganized the income part of the portfolio a bit, not necessarily in a
positive direction by buying a position in EMB and selling some IGK, SPPRO,
DDR-G, NBG-A. This move probably should be called di-worse-fication. :)
Unfortunately, currently there are no good long positions to play the income
side of market. Assuming the coming rise in interest rates and unclear
direction of US$, almost nothing looks good. Few convertibles offer high enough
interest and possible capital appreciation. Funds like TIP or EMB may suffer as
rates rise, since TIP only protects from inflation but not rate risk and EMB
may become less attractive compared to higher US rates. One could short
long-term treasuries perhaps, but I don't advocate or take short positions.

On the sell side, PBEGF is rather expensive although very well executing
company. I sold TLM to switch to more oily companies. CHBT is somewhat
expensive if we go with GAAP results and don't discount their derivative
losses.
