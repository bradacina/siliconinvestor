Hi Steven,

"Can the market possibly take a major hit if everyone is planning on it?"

More likely it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I see a few possible
sccenarios. The majority of people either sell at the first sign of weakness or
in a pre-emptive strike of that weakness and trigger the selling. Or the
majority of people simply delay any purchases while they wait for the coming
sell-off. Either way I do not think that the underlying "buy-on-dips" mentality
has evaporated as people try to duplicate what happened last fall.

Fingers crossed,
Terrapin

I think it's one of those ideas that are unassailable logically, but in
actuality, do not work.
I see the idea often mentioned by value fund managers. I've come to the
conclusion it's something they say as a marketing ploy to tout their ability to
pick stocks. It's a story they give about how there are so many cheap stocks
out there, that the art of the thing is to be able to tell which ones are
temporarily mispriced from the ones that truly deserve to be cheap. I put it in
the same category of pig-at-trough investing. (eg.pick and own your 40 best
stocks; another stock for consideration has to displace one of the 40 to make
it onto the buy list.)
The thing that shoots it all down for me is that these managers can not pick, a
priori, which of their stocks are actually going to be the big winners, and
which are (actually) going to languish. And they will have many stocks that do
nothing for long periods of time. This, in spite of apparently having some
"extra" catalyst criteria.

Contra indicator however: On the other hand, I'm trying to keep track of my
net-net choices which are selected solely based on financial numbers vs. the
net-net choices picked by Jim Clarke. Jim's are winnowed to a select few by
considering fundamental factors such as the business model (i.e. there's a
defined catalyst or margin of safety). So far, on a small sample and only over
a year or so, Jim's picks are far outdistancing the few net-nets that I've
picked.

In some reports of academic studies I've read, the only catalyst would seem to
be the presence of insider buying. On stocks that are discussed here, usually
that factor is mentioned. (I believe Mike Burry, et. al. are fans of insider
buying. I like it too.)

Re: Value stock catalyst.

I think we tend to define catalyst as some key fundamental thing we can see
coming for a company. As you say this is very hard to see beforehand. I look at
it differently. I would define catalyst more generally, as something that will
prove the prevailing Street view wrong.

That would include a key fundamental development we expect that the Street does
not or more general things like faulty Street analysis
(in our opinion). Two examples. New Holland was priced by the Street
as if the current tough period would be the same as the last (with huge
losses), despite there being fewer competitors, company statements that they
were being more careful with inventories, early production cuts, etc. Buying it
at $8+ was a no-brainer.

Second, the manufactured housing industry. It is no surprise news that a lot of
dealers have been added. What this amounts to is channel stuffing (of unneeded
channels) by the manufacturers, which is not a short term problem to correct. I
have been publicly bearish on the idea of buying these stocks since CHB was 20
and CAV 8, long before the Street took them out and shot them.

I also think that where you can identify faulty Street analysis you are likely
to make larger gains faster than if you are right on some fundamental
development. The latter often takes time to emerge in results; the former, when
recognized can result in a rapid change in valuation, as with NH, CHB and CAV.

Par for the course, Armin, on market orders with fast moving stocks. That's why
a lot of firms no longer accept market orders on these fast movers.

If you like, you can check the Time and Sales to see that your order did fall
into the appropriate range. I'd be happy to help you on that if you like.

The market orders get presented to the market at either a random point in time

Peter, 2 minutes to execute any kind of order is ridiculous. I would check time

and demand either cancellation or execution at the first price. Why weren't
five 100 share orders entered on "auto-exec", if it was going to take 2 minutes
to place a trade some other way.
I'd also get rid of that broker.

I too do not use market orders. I pay an extra $5 per trade but regard that as
cheap insurance against paying more than I want to. Besides most of the time I
buy at the bid and sell at the offer, where limit orders are required.

It is ridiculous, jeffrey, but commonplace nonetheless on particularly fast

I'm still not 100% up to speed on all these execution details, but I think
that's about right.

Once when trading AMZN at Schwab the price had moved $8 in my favor by the time
the market order executed - something like 7 minutes later! There were other
instances not so favorable of course.

CTO- the "latest" Buffett stock- should be a very interesting story when the
details come out (if ever they do). I see that Mr. Buffett now admits to owning
about 5.7% (about 363,000 sh). Couple of other interesting points (interesting
to me anyway): I've come across CTO in reading about Baker Fentress (BKF) which
is an investment management company which is now in the process of distributing
its equity investments to stockholders. One of those investments is CTO. That
is, 5.0M shares of CTO are being distributed to BKF shareholders. But there are
only 6.4M shares of CTO outstanding in total. So I just wonder how and when Mr.
Buffett acquired his 363,000 (if the float were only 6.4-5.0=1.4M shares); and
I just wonder if Mr. Buffett acquired those CTO shares as a result of the BKF
distribution. Which could mean that Mr. Buffett has or had a position in BKF
(or he could have purchased after the CTO shares were distributed).

In either case, since I (and you, I believe) still have a general interest in
Florida real estate companies, and the CTO board has indicated it might use its
available cash to buy up to 25% of CTO stock, I am interested in how this all
plays out.

My understanding is that Buffett acquired his CTO shares through the
liquidation of Baker Fentress. CTO was down a dollar yesterday and I figured it
would be up three today on the "news", but it wasn't. The real question is can
we come to any educated guess of what price Buffett paid, given that he bought
the shares through Baker.

Even better, do a little work on CTO and see if you can see what Buffett may or
may not see (if thats a sentence...at least it rhymes). I agree with Buffett
(if he really is doing this) that real estate looks VERY VERY attractive now
relative to the stock market. But putting your money under the mattress...hell,
leaving it in a bag in the middle of Central Park...looks more attractive to me
than the stock market today. I looked at CTO a couple years ago, but they were
basically an orange grove with a little real estate development on the side.
That seems to have changed. Its probably worth another look, but if I were
going for real estate I'd probably just buy a high quality REIT with an 8 or 9%
yield.

And if we're Buffett-watching, just keep in mind the ultimate Buffett stock
broke through its 52 week low today. A little insurance company in Omaha.

questions on EBSC - you're going to be disappointed.

This is a liquid stock (i.e. institutions can buy it...they have already proven
they can sell it) trading below its net working capital. And it is profitable.
I believe there are about five companies on the entire U.S. stock market that
fit that description. I own two of them. And it has a couple catalysts.

<<The following chart shows that they have the worst performance of their
peers. Do you know why?>>
I am not surprised the stock has underperformed its peers. Last I checked,
Walmart was not a net-net. EBSC came public in 1997 out of bankruptcy with a
bit of hype. Nobody who bought the shares in the offering, or in the secondary
made a dime. There are a lot of disgruntled shareholders out there who have
dumped the stock. Hopefully they're done. A couple institutions have stepped up
to buy whatever is dumped, even if it means they own 10 or 20% of the company -
that's what makes a bottom.

<<Why mightn't this be a situation that stays cheap (for a long time) until
they have bought back so much stock that a potential acquirer finds the cost he
has to pay reduced to where it is irresistible?>> I think I'm looking at a 6-12
month story here. You could ask this about any of the net-nets that have gone
up in the past.

<<How badly will Internet shopping hurt them fundamentally in the longer term
(or their valuation - this ain't no Amazon)?>> You've got a quibble there with
the entire retail sector. I'm not even going to start on that.

<<We don't know whether the shoe store chain will be sold at a loss or not, do
we?>> No we don't. But EBSC has book value of about $15 a share and trades at 6
1/2. And a loss on a sale may actually solidify the net-net valuation if they
sold it for cash (something like what MAXS just did).

My point here is not to dodge your questions, but only to point out that the
margin of safety may be so big here that you could be 100% right and I still
make 50% in six months. Those are the kinds of questions I ask when a company
trades at two times book value. For a net-net, all I am asking is 1) is the
company in a death spiral? 2) are the assets real? 3) is there a catalyst to
realize the value in a reasonable time frame? 4) is the business something I
kind of understand? Very few net-nets pass this basic test. And the ones that
do are generally big winners in a short time.

We were talking about catalysts the other day and I mentioned a couple on EBSC
(two large shareholders pushing for change, share repurchase) but I forgot the
most obvious one. The company gets taken over. I think thats my exit.

Thanks for your response, Jim. I find EBSC tempting. However, it reminds me a
great deal of Strawbridge Clothier, an old line, family run Philadelphia chain,
whose stock I owned for quite a while many years ago.

Strawbridge also attracted value investors, but never quite could get it right.
It was eventually sold at a not particularly attractive price to another chain.

If this follows a similar scenario, you will probably see 50% on your price but
not 100%. An acquirer probably wants his own "margin of error" to cover costs
of closing some stores and sprucing up others to his style and format.

I do not see any downside risk here. However, since the market is rapidly
creating better values elsewhere, EBSC is becoming relatively less interesting
by comparison.

accounting numbers all of which aren't created equal. Growth rates have a funny
way of changing - basing a valuation on peak growth rates will not yield a good
value estimate if the growth rate sags, particularly if it sags quickly. The
basic concept of valuation is divide the present value of future earnings by a
discount rate. Either the earnings estimates or the discount rate should
reflect the uncertainty that the earnings will come thru as forecasted. Future
earnings guesstimates are often wildly wrong, especially in technology areas
where today's successful launch is tomorrow's stale lunch.
Other approaches to valuing stocks include: Comparing to similar companies to
see if ratios differ, using option based methods to value potentials, and just
accepting the market's estimate.
If you wish to explore valuation further look at "Investment Valuation" by
Damodoran or similar available at most libraries and book stores.

&#209;: Lack of insider buying in the group would indicate those closest to the
situation see little room for enthusiasm...and they're usually early.
One factor could also be having impact could be recently rising yield spreads.
Many of these guys have significant financing activity. Borrowing costs may be
rising more than treasury rates indicate. Thus they either have lower profits
on lending to purchasers while keeping buyers rates low or they miss sales as
rates impact affordability. I haven't seen anyone talking about this, but there
have been articles in the journal about rising credit spreads.
Downward pressure from tax-loss selling and concerns in analyst community about
retail supply in MH sector also weighing em down.

Another key issue still in death industry's corner now is state legislation
which requires a funeral parlor's services; "self service" such as buying your
own casket from a wholesaler is banned in most places. But AFAIK this is
beginning to change. This may be an overly sweeping statement, but IMO as
boomers get older, they will not be as willing as previous generations to
accept the status quo wrt the cost of dying. Long standing legislation designed
to preserve the death industry IMO will not last. Again apologies for not

1)SPAB Two major acquisitions in two years going from 62 to 745 employees.
Company is very strong in satellite preparation and NASA support. Only 2 space
missions this year, but should have crack at return to last years performance
if scheduled 8 missions are funded and spab receives contract. Selling
preferred shares to Daimler at 9(converts at 1/1 to common. Mitsubishi also
holds shares. Overall float is approximately 3 million giving stock excellent
upside potential should these probable events materialize. Catalyst, probable
events to return stock to prior levels.
2) AVL. Three 13Ds filed in last two months. On Feb 23 hired Merrill Lynch to
explore means of enhancing value. Offer to buy at 15.5 by minority holders who
are now filing 13D to get company to hold annual meeting and to not sell a
valuable asset(Inventory Location Service,ILS) Offer lapsed but minority
shareholders making noises about investing in the ILS. Catalyst, something is
likely to happen to shake up management and most likely to benefit of stock
price.

We have some excellent opportunities now to buy stocks in some very

talking about mobile home manufacturers, stick home builders, fertilizer

The long knives came out on Mattel today (16 7/8). We are now well over 50%
down from the high, with recent insider buying. Today we saw an extreme price
move on pure speculation about the third quarter. There are a lot of scary
rumors flying around. The company has said nothing, and the top analyst on the
stock is digging in, saying if the company misses the third quarter it won't be
by a significant amount and that U.S. business is pretty good. Big volume
today, and it looks to me like a panic sell. Not that it can't go lower, as
panic selling begets more panic selling in a market like this. But Mattel is a
name that many investors of all stripes watch. This stock is way too
conspicuous to drift down indefinitely like other stocks are doing. Yesterday
when I added I did not have the "punch in the gut" feeling. Today I did. Mattel
is a buy.

I added to Mattel too early, but will add more. Also adding to Ambac and
Clayton. I agree completely with Paul Senior's statement that there are some
entire sectors out there (insurance, housing to name two) which have been
absolutely flogged by investors. If you buy quality names in these sectors, I
agree with Paul that you will be quite happy two years from now.

safety due to a long history of management misinvestments still holds.
Management still has a long history of misusing shareholer capital, and that

Yes. And it will add greatly to one's returns if they all get just 20% cheaper.
At the recent rates of decline, the wait may only be a few weeks, or even days.
Still say it's safer to wait for some stability. Even the oil sector and the
commodities bounced twice off their bottoms.

I'm still rich in REITs. Trying to buy more HRP - it crashed on a misperception
of its dividend after the split - so much so that they issued a PR saying "hey

This is an office REIT for crying out loud.

Re: death industry,

The one thing I'd suggest to anyone considering an investment in this industry
is to keep an eye on the debt. Since this is a stable and predictable sort of
industry, a sound argument can be made for using a certain amount of debt. But
since this industry has recently been through a consolidation phase, it is my
contention that many in the industry may have overdone it w.r.t. the
acquisition prices paid. To the extent that debt was involved in these
acquisitions (and it was!), there exists the very real possibility that as
animal passions cool and more sensible values prevail, there may be *NOTHING*
left for common equity. (If the amount of real economic value they acquired
with each of their overpaid-for acquisitions was less than the amount of debt
used to finance the acquisitions, then in hindsight we can look at each of
these overpaid-for acquisitions and say that they were a net *minus* to
shareholder equity!)

There may very well be good values to be had in buying up beaten-down common
stock, just be aware that you must consider the possibility that some of the
equity out there may be worthless in the long run. In spite of the stocks being
at their lowest point in several years, do not ignore the fact that if the
common is worthless (you must determine if this is true or not), then any price
is too much!

Alternately, you can look at the bonds that these companies have issued -- you
might find that they are cheap enough to offer a value investor an equity-like
return, if he has a superior idea of the stability and backing of value that
the bonds have. In the very little that I have seen of the junk bond market,
the market does in many cases over- and under- react to the good and bad
prospects that happen to companies. It seems that there is just as much
opportunity to find undervalued junk bonds as there is to find undervalued
stocks.

(FWIW I shorted Loewen common stock at $C3 and bought Loewen bonds at 50 cents
based on what I have written above. My analysis was that the equity was
worthless and the bonds were definitely worth 70-75 cents. I've been too lazy
to see if similar ideas might work for others in the death industry).

What really appealed to me in analyzing Loewen bonds was that it was really the
first time I felt like I was in fact doing "real" Graham-type value analysis.
The very factors that the hypesters of a few years back were using to hype the
common stock during the go-go days of aggressive acquisitions and stock and
debt financed rollups (stable steady growth, etc) worked very much in favor of
establishing a tangible value and margin of safety for the bonds, once a
reasonable price was established. I guess what I am saying here is that in
spite of horribly huge overpayments for funeral homes having happened in the
very recent past, these homes do in fact have a very real and stable value to
them -- if we are now presented with the opportunity of buying these good sound
stable businesses *AT THE RIGHT PRICE*, we can actually make a sensible
investment in them.

Analyze the business, the balance sheet and the stock market valuation. If you
like what you see, be sure to take one last glance at the capital structure
before you buy the common stock(!). Just because the company is down and will
recover and prosper in the future does not mean that today's shareholders will
still be around!

Mike, what do you do when you buy a stock for a double in 1-2 years and you get
"30% and 40% moves in some holdings in just a matter of weeks"? Do you sell
some or all or wait to realize your expectation?
If you sell some, why, if the expected additional return at that
point is still competitive?

A real life example: CAV could have been bought last week for 3 3/4
with a reasonable expectation of 7 1/2 in 1-2 years. Within a week it was up a
third. At 5 it still has a good expected percentage return
to 7 1/2.

My general rule is to hold for 50%, then reduce my position back to its
original size if it is still worth holding, or sell all if the position is no
longer competitive with other potential positions.

But what I do with quick 30-40% gains is an art, not a science. I take into
account the technical characteristics of the run-up as well as potential
fundamental reasons to get a picture of the durability and quality.

I'm perfectly willing to buy and hold, but if there is a 30-40% run in a short
time that I consider a trading gain, I'll take it. If I just bought a stock,
chances are it was competing with other stocks for entry into the portfolio
just two weeks ago. If it has now run 40% in two weeks, and the other
potentials haven't, well then I definitely will take into account the new
relative value disparity.

And if a stock hits new lows, I'll usually sell it unless the dividend is
particularly outsized or the valuation particularly outrageous.

I own FLO, and like it even more at these levels FWIW. My take on it, is that
the 55% interest in Keebler equates to about the current FLO stock price; thus,
you get Mrs. Smith's and Flowers Bakeries free of charge (obviously one needs
to factor in debt issues in these calculations).
Mrs. Smith (darn her) is dragging down the whole boat, with, as I understand
it, state of the art facilities being brought on, which have glitches, causing
product being thrown out due to quality problems, etc. It is not a demand
problem, rather a supply problem. The flip side of the coin, if and when these
problems are ironed out, is that the Mrs. Smith's division (Mrs. Smith's still
being one of the top names, if not the top name, in frozen desserts) will be a
significant contributor to FLO's bottom line.
A caution is that Mrs. Smith's has also some issues with sales contracts and
marketing promotions.
I'll quote to you from FLO's Q2 report, which I received yesterday (with the
caveat that management is not always right):
"The current disappointing level of performance at Mrs. Smith's is not a
reflection of its long term potential. When this realignment project is
completed, it will improve Mrs. Smith's service and quality as well as reduce
its production, distribution, and inventory costs. This will give Mrs. Smith's
a competitive advantage in the $31-billion frozen baked foods category."

I've been looking real hard at Washington Mutual. Between my REITs and my Old
Republic, I'm already exposed to real estate. WM would be additional exposure
for me, as would any re-buy of a homebuiler. So since I expect tax-loss selling
to hit the financial sector pretty hard, as well as the potential for
deteriorating fundamentals, I'm willing to be patient. With equity/assets of
under 5%, WM is not in the strongest shape should its fundamentals deteriorate,
i.e. real estate deflate. Out here in Silicon Valley, everyday life feels like

disruptions in earnings. These disruptions may yield significant benefits in
the future. This is not a case of battling OS for computers, this is the frozen
dessert business, and, if I go to my local grocer, I honestly don't see too
many competitors nipping at Mrs. Smith's heels. They have tons of shelf space,
the packaging is attractive, and the product is excellent.
One could argue that, in the present circumstance, management is doing the
proper thing, not sending out an inferior product, thus risking losing current
customers. The other side of the argument is that management should have done a
better job in overseeing the ramp-up of the new production facilities.

Thanks for the feedback on FLO guys. One last thought...after a running
discussion on Mike Burke's thread(where I saw the news on FLO originally), it
seems that SAP software installation is an ongoing problem w/SAP and all of its
customers, not just FLO. However, once installed it is apparently worth it for
the upgrade...

Looks like impatient investors to me. Is it just me or does it seem like funds
are developing a "daytrader" mentality? Why not just hedge the position and
hold on rather than sell?

The Apple/Wintel comment was just an off-hand reference, not meant in any way
to be a direct comparison. I feel FLO is a value stock, that the arb
opportunity is very attractive, and that FLO management is suspect. These three
are not mutually exclusive. I just don't buy it when management claims the
problem is on the supply side, not the demand side, and all else is well.
Management flubbed something, and they've lost credibility with Wall Street for
restating earnings and issuing multiple warnings of increasing significance.
This doesn't change my opinion that FLO's non-Keebler equity is worth something
north of zero.

Wouldn't shorting Keebler and buying FLO be an arbitrage worth looking at?

As a matter of fact, I have thought about FTL. Here's a letter I wrote to a
friend a couple of weeks ago. I haven't actually done any work or digging on
it, though (I am such a lazy b****ard!)

Hi xxxx,

Real Soon Now (TM) I hope to dig into two ideas that appear to be
promising enough to be worthy of some serious investigation.

The first is to short Sunbeam common (theory: they got so loaded up with
debt that they are so impossibly behind the power curve that there is no
way, no how that their common equity can possibly survive).

The second one is to investigate Fruit of the Loom. A nice non-Rocket
Science company and industry, the thing that caught my attention here is
that their common still has a decent capitalization (ca. $275M) yet they
have lots of debt and their ten year bonds (7%'11) trade in the 40s.
Not sure if there is necessarily a bond-buying or stock-shorting
opportunity here, but it does look like there is enough of a disconnect
somewhere that it is probably worthwhile to spend some time analyzing
the company.
