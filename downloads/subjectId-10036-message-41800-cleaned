If EXC was indeed in freefall I would probably buy some as they are the premier
US nuclear operator in my opinion (but looks to me like it is down 10%). Yes
they have some reactors similar to the japanese plants but it is all about
location, location, location. STM.TO and EFR.TO (uranium miners) are down 50%
in 5 trading days, are that is more of what I think of as freefall. If I didn't
have any exposure to uranium I might be tempted, but valuation is still not
overly compelling in my opinion (especially the nuclear buildout is delayed
significantly as seems a possibility). Besides which the Uranium stocks are
notoriously volatile, and prone to emotional buying and selling, and I can't
see a lot of emotional buying in the short term.

Exc is not a regulated utility for the most part - 80% of their earnings are
wholesale energy sales (a volatile business) that they cleverly patched up as a
stable business with hedges. They could hedge well because they own constant
baseload generators with constant fixed costs (nuclear plants). Speaking of
those, about 1/2 of their plants are build in the 70's, so they are well
seasoned, to put it in kind terms. EXC has been counting on license extensions
to keep them going which may not be forthcoming any more.

Even more important, EXC earnings estimates are down next year, down to
3$/share. This is due to wholesale prices for electricity being much
lower,which is starting to hurt since their hedges are running off. For me at
least, buying a stock at 13x FWD earnings is not really much of a bargain. I
find quite a few cheaper utilities around that don't have the added risk of
nuclear wholesale power in a non-regulated framework.

Just read an analysis of the nuclear industry in the FT. Good coverage on the
future of this industry, but as always, many uncertainties linger until a
conclusive study can be produced from what has occurred in Fukushima.

The number of reactors under construction, planned and proposed reactors they
gave was 538 worldwide, of which 187 from China and 63 from India. Even these
countries have put a halt to construction of new reactors pending investigation
on the safety of nuclear power. They're predicting that coal and gas would
increase in usage in China in the short term.

Somehow I don't see China backing 100% away from nuclear power, so there is
still hope for players in the nuclear industry, but what do I know?

Interesting fact is that Nikkei went up by 5.68% yesterday, do they know
something that we don't? This has been echoed by stock markets in South East

Yet another sale in GPOR. I am almost out of the stock even with its good
earnings this year. Shoulda held more for higher gains, but one never knows.

NE is not really overpriced, but I sold a bit to raise cash.
UEPS has horrible results, but even with these results it's pretty cheap here.
Again sale to raise cash.
XCO - sale to raise cash as it's not clear if there's much upside from possible

Not really. Technically it's a "dead cat bounce". Fundamentally, people who

re 2501.T Sapporo Holdings.

It is in fact a 3rd Ave Value discard. They initiated a position in Y2007 and
according to this chart, they paid at least 600Yen/share. I paid 258Yen and
it's now going for ~290Yen/share.
see P9:
http://www.thirdavenuefunds.com/ta/documents/sl/shareholderletters-07Q2.pdf

3rd Avwe value proposition was about the real estate, which brings in ~1/2 the
operating earnings and was supposedly not reflected in the stock price.
http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/2501?countrycode=JP

Ironically Sapporo's operating earnings and RE revenues have increased since
then (beer is recession resistant after all), yet the stock goes for less than
1/2 what a supposedly smart value investor paid.

This is just to demonstrate some of the carnage that occurred in Japan with
some small caps. I am not claiming that Japan's ordeal is over and I have no
idea what is going to happen with those damn reactors but frothy prices we pay

Spekulatius,

You may get terrific results with Japanese stock purchases, especially since
you bought <1/2 of the price Third Avenue paid.

However, I looked at Sapporo financials and I see why people don't like
Japanese companies. The structure is complex (Itochu has the same issue). They
are in a number of different businesses. Real estate component is tough to
analyze although you could argue that Third Avenue did this for us. ROE is low.
D/E is somewhat high. P/E for the price you paid was below 10, but at
290Y/share it's not outstanding (~11 P/E). And you can only buy it in Japan
going through currency conversion and highish brokerage fees. Not available in
IRAs either at least on Fido. So unless I really love the company for long
hold, any short term gains would be taxed. So personally I will skip.

On the positive side, I love the financial result presentation by Japanese
companies. Even considering complex structures, their reports are very clear
and easy to read.

the question is what did KPMG sign off. CBEH does not really own anything,
except a "series of contractual agreements" within the jurisdiction of the PRC.

We do not own any equity interest in Xi’an Baorun Industrial. In order to meet
domestic ownership requirements under PRC law, which restricts foreign
companies from operating in the finished oil and biodiesel industry, our
wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into a series of contractual agreements with
Xi’an Baorun Industrial, which allow us, among other things, to secure
significant rights to control Xi’an Baorun Industrial’s business operations,
policies and management, to approve all matters requiring stockholder
approvals, and give us the right to receive service fee on a monthly basis from
Xi’an Baorun Industrial equal to 100% of the monthly net income of Xi’an Baorun
Industrial .

You'd be surprised at how lax the review process is at some of the Big Four
firms, especially if the fees are small and the company is 'not worth' the
partner's time. I agree that they may not be party to fraud like AA was, but
errors do occur quite frequently.

Besides, since the demise of AA, IMO there has been a lot of leeway given to
the Big Four as regulators don't want another big audit firm to fail, thus
concentrating audits into fewer firms and exacerbating the monopoly of audits
the Big Four currently enjoy. So regulators like the SEC like to go down the
road of settlements rather than bringing a civil/criminal case against the
firm.

Some links to selected cases below. Again, none of them IMO are as strong as
the case made against AA, but it is quite eye opening.

I spent some more time on BYDDF. The big question about the BYDDF is the market
cap. IMHO, Yahoo and Google are both wrong. Assuming the US$3.98 BYDDF price or
HK$30.95 1211.HK price and multiplying by 2,275,100,000 shares, yields US$9B
market cap. I am not sure what Yahoo and Google use, but their numbers are 4.5B
and 3B respectively. IMHO they only count H shares or domestic shares and do
not count the share total:

---------------
As at 31 December 2010, the share capital of the Company was as follows:
Number of shares issued, Percentage(%)
Domestic shares 1,482,000,000 65.14
H shares 793,100,000 34.86
Total 2,275,100,000 100.00
---------------

Reuters confirms the US$9B market cap:
http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=1211.HK by corresponding
HK$72B market cap.

If we assume US$9B market cap, the P/E is pretty high and expected return is
pretty low.

In 2010 company's mobile division grew more than auto division. It's not clear
that either business is sustainable and will have great margins long term.

Second guessing his decisions is also not very useful, since we don't really

much cash he has, what kind of businesses he is looking to buy, but none of us

I still think BYD was a person sale to Warren and Charlie and I think they have

re 2501 Sapporo is more a "sum of parts valuation" than an earnings play. Based

Sapporo website a page that valued their RE at 2x stated book. Their brewery
operation is certainly worth something too, even though their trail Kirin and
Asahi in market share and profitability.

With Japanese stocks, the stated earning do not tell the whole story, imo. For
one thing, I believe that Japanese numbers are more conservative (they in fact
do depreciate goodwill and intangibles and take a hit for it in earnings) and
they also tend to have higher depreciation (I believe there is more incentive
to hide earnings in Japan, because tax rates are higher etc.). if you compare
EBITDA valuations, then Japanese companies look in fact cheap. For example
Kirin and Asahi appear to trade at 6x EBITDA/EV or roughly 11-12x cash
earnings. This is lower than BUD ever traded as far as I remember and both
business are fairly comparable. FWIW , the latter two look like decent values
for an income investor, because they generate strong FCF and have been
increasing their dividends at a nice clip.

In any case, the Japanese run typically lower with lower ROA but one of the
reasons is that they run asset heavy (own their equipment, land and buildings)
while US companies tend to be asset light. Over the last 10 years however the
Japanese have been catching up slowly and a restructuring. What takes 1-2 years
in the US will take 5-10 years in Japan, so this type of restructuring is a
slow motion activity.

TGT breaking below 50$ today, looks like it's on the way to 52 week lows at
~48$. Earning estimate is ~4.2$/share, so PE is around 12. Growth has stalled
and they are selling their credit card business (10%+ o their earnings) which I
think is going to reduce their earnings but also free's up some resources from
the balance sheet. I suspect those are going into buybacks. They also own their
RE, and were pushed by a hedge fund (Ackman?) to spin of their RE into a REIT
(would have been a a horrible timing anyways).

Hi Spekulatius:

TGT recently beat Wall Mart on a price survey done in January 2011. It looks
like it is as a result of increasing their grocery lines and bringing in a more
efficient company owned Supply Chain operation. It's pretty incredible they are
able to move their business operations so fast (w/i last 12 months) being such
a large company (Market Cap $35 Billion).

Low, low prices: Target beats Wal-Mart
http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/07/news/companies/walmart_target_better_price/inde
.htm

From the article:"...Two recent price comparisons of grocery and household
goods revealed that Target's prices are lower than at No. 1 retailer Wal-Mart.

<clip>

"Target stepped up its game during the recession," he said. <u>"The company
caught up with Wal-Mart on making its supply chain more efficient so it could
bring down prices on items people frequently buy."</u>

Groceries are big traffic generators, and Wal-Mart still dominates Target
there. About half the items that Wal-Mart sells are groceries.

Johnson estimates that 15% to 20% of Target's merchandise are groceries. Koenst
declined to confirm those numbers but said 16% of Target's sales in 2009 were
food and pet supply purchases...."
---------------------------------------------------

I remember the REIT proposal and think management made the right long term move
to hold onto their company owned real estate.

It is very interesting that Target is improving their Supply Chain at SVU's
expense. TGT also plans to move into Canada as they recently entered into some
long term real estate leases in Canada.

My reason for holding it and adding more if it drops is actually pretty lame.

First, this is NOT a Buffett investment; it is a Charlie Munger and Li Lu

bullish. I believe they are expecting it to be the Microsoft of the battery

of your platform.

The funny thing is...those examples were just the tip of the iceberg! IMHO the
way the auditing model works now is flawed, as the auditors are supposed to be
critical on the companies that pay them the fees. But short of a central body
that can co-ordinate the paying of fees to auditors (which I'm sure will be
exposed to abuse as well), I'm afraid we'll have to make the best of what we
have.

Madharry, I'm no expert on the legal system, but I do know that auditors do not
have responsibility to spot a fraud (they have a responsibility to report the
fraud if they encounter it, but are not responsible to actively look for it).
If you look at the audit opinion:

"We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion."

Tried to take a look at a couple of healthcare companies - namely ones that
outsource patient care such as EMS, and I must say I'm not impressed. Some
numbers for EMS:

P/E = 21.43
L/T debt to Net earnings = 3x
Liabilities to SE = 1.06
5yr capex = 225m (Net earnings have been 431m for the same period)

Though it is decent in other areas:
EBITDA/Revenue = 10.21%
Interest expense = 10.13% of Operating Income
Current ratio = 2.65
ROE = 15.58%

I would have thought a company in the healthcare sector would be more
attractive...or is that just a common misconception?

Thanks for the Byd reply. I decided the stock's not for me. I closed out my

I don't understand Byd well enough to know that this Chinese company could be a
leader, ahead of the Japanese, in batteries.

Depending on how I look at it -- my luck, timing, or something else, I've had
okay results following Mr. Buffett into some of his picks. With Mr. Munger -
Wesco, his legal journal company (can't recall name of this public company) --
my results have not been good. I guess that experience will remain consistent
here too for me with Munger's BYDDF.
=================
Positive for Byd could be that it's beat down to a low, and might stabilize or
recover from here. Among the Chinese stocks I am watching, they all seem to
have been dropping lately, so maybe Byd's fall here is not due to a
company-specific issue. Down is down, but in this case, I'd rather have a
company down because it's caught in a general market decline, rather than
because of some difficult issue relating specifically to the company's business
prospects. For now though, I leave this stock to others.

RE: Penn Virginia Resource Partners(NYSE: PVR )

PVR is the new PVG after all the share conversion. I bought this to produce
income for my IRA but have no idea what the UBTI will be in 2011. I have two
MLP's in the IRA (DPM & PVR). Coal is seen as a value fuel and I have noticed
that CONSOL Energy Inc. (CNX) also was moving higher (they own coal & NG).

I own an equivalent amount of PVR in the taxable account so there is no UBTI
issue.

Long term I think coal is a legacy dirty fuel. I do like PVR's midstream
business and this was the main reason for my initial buy.

So what's your view on coal and do you think it is still seen as an undervalued
fuel or could this be seen as a windfall move for coal and NG will end up as
the fuel of choice?

I started to explore coal about 8 months ago as my BHP holding had all sorts of
commodity mineral assets but lacked any significant amount of coal reserves.
There is a rumor that BHP is ready to buy some energy assets and has been
looking at U.S. shale and/or coal reserves.

Do you think coal is now a "value" energy resource and longer term could move
higher?

re TGE, do you realize that TGT still has their credit card business on their

They made about 500M$ in earnings with their credit card business, which is 11$
of their 4.5B$ in pretax earnings. So i suppose that earnings/share will be
around 3.6$ (Y2010) after the sale of the credit card business whole debt will
fall by ~ 6.2B$. the earning model for analyst do not take the sale of the
credit card buiz in account even though it has been announced in the 10k. At
around 3.8$/share in Y2011 earnings and a 50$ share price TGT still does not
look cheap.

this perhaps explains better my thoughts:

this was about ccme:

Here are two statements Beancounter from YMB wrote about the Deloitte cash
issue:

1) I am having a problem with D&T's statement about the bank confirmation
process. As a big four auditor for over thirty years I would say that
confirmation of cash is the most basic part of the audit. You get independent
verification from the banks involved at the audit date. You can also do a
"proof of cash" by analyzing all of the sources of increases to the cash
accounts, and the sources of distributions of cash from the cash accounts.
While auditors do request representations from management as to certain things,
I would hope that D&T wasn't just asking management to represent that the cash
existed. The proof of cash would also send up a red flag if the company was
borrowing funds off the books just to window dress the balance sheet. Why D&T
couldn't do the forensic work on cash that they may have considered necessary
just makes no sense. If you ever suspect fraud in a company, verification of
the sources and uses of cash should be the primary focus of the audit! If D&T
did insufficient work in 2009 to verify cash and the accuracy of the F/S, you
would think they would step up and do the forensic work on their "own nickel"!!
The conduct of D&T is a real mystery to me. I should think they have real
liability on this issue. Even if there is massive fraud, there are plenty of
examples where this has not sheltered the auditors from legal verdicts.

2) Cash confirmation is usually the first thing done in an audit. In fact the
cash work is usually done at an interim date(ie. Oct-Nov.) and then again at
year end. During interim you test the systems that support cash receipts and
disbursements to determine if they can be relied upon. Assuming that cash is
independently verified at year end, the auditors may have done additional work
to review bank statements for the year to ascertain that there were not any
large unusual increases in cash balances that didn't flow from accounts
receivable or other normal operating transactions. In light of the allegations,
such additional work should have been expanded beyond testing to a higher level
of verification. To me this seems like basic audit work as opposed to hiring a
forensic accountant. Frankly I would be embarassed as the primary auditor to
admit that I couldn't verify cash to my satisfaction!

while with Enron, the auditor helped to facilitate fraud.

As mentioned before and audit is not necessarily designed to uncover fraud.

From the article"... Investors are overlooking several existing strengths in
Supervalu's portfolio of operations that should prevent it from becoming
another industry death star like A&P, which filed for bankruptcy last December.

One is Supervalu's wholesale-grocery business—which supplies the company's
1,140 traditional grocery stores, 1,230 deep-discount Save-A-Lots and 1,900
small, independent stores. This steady-eddy concern, the largest grocery
wholesaler in the U.S., will chip in about a third of Supervalu's operating
earnings, or some $300 million a year, and is largely impervious to price
competition from the discounters.

Supervalu is investing heavily in the Save-A-Lot chain of small, no-frills
discount stores that are increasingly set up in densely populated metropolitan
areas largely beyond the reach of big discounters like Wal-Mart. Their
competition is mainly from dollar stores and small, high-priced ma-and-pa
establishments. "These stores keep prices down by offering lots of
private-label goods and limited brand selection while at the same time
providing low-income customers with an assortment of fresh items like produce,
meat and dairy that the neighborhood establishments may not carry," an insider
at Supervalu, now in its earnings quiet period, tells Barron's. "The chain
caters to the fastest-growing cohort in the U.S. population—the households
making $45,000 or less, and frequently on food stamps." ..."

valuation is somewhere close to WMT. Not that attractive IMHO although a
consideration if one is looking at TGT/WMT space.

I am adding more to CHL @ 45$. Somewhat disappointing earning report, even
though that was more or less expected.

Earnings/share 5.96rmb (+5%), revenues up 11.8$ (so margins went down a bit).
The competition has caught up with them somewhat because they use a chinese
grown 3G system (government mandated) that is not quite competitive. but still
they have by far the largest network, the most subscribers and the highest
profitability.

Also, for the next generation data network, they are going to deploy LTE, which
is considered the best in class technology for 4G.

PE is about 11.5 and they have substantial net cash on the balance sheet. My
investment thesis is that this is a utility with a wide moat (largest network)
in a country with appreciating currency (I expect 5%+ headwind from RMB
appreciation annually), high single digit growth with a potential boost from
higher data penetration (smartphones) and a 3.4% dividend yield currently. I
think with 3.4% (dividend yield) + 5% RMB appreciation +8% growth ~15% annually
is quite possible, even if the currently depressed multiple does not expand.

CHL. Okay, I looked, and I see it falls in my style box as a value at current
price. I'll start a small tracking position. (Taking a small first buy; will
add more if stock drops further with no adverse news)

All good points and have to agree with all of them.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that just because we expect an auditor to do
his job, does not mean that he is doing his job, especially in 'basic' areas
such as bank and cash or PPE.

Just because someone says the market is efficient, does not mean that the
market is efficient. Same thing with auditors. Most financial statements with
an unqualified opinion deserves that tag (I mean, what else would we rely on
right?), but once in a while you will get things missed (either by error or
deliberate), especially if they are not deemed material or if the auditor has a
really 'good' relationship with his client.

It's that time of the year...

filling proxy statements.

Executive compensations continues to be egregious in most of the companies.
It's amazing how JNJ BOD finds great reasons to pay CEO $29M while the company
continues to fumble through quality issues and recalls destroying its brand
cachet. What would it take for them to reduce the bonuses? CEO announcing that
the company would reduce drug prices for the poor? Yeah, probably that's the
ticket.

Anyway I voted against executive compensation so far for every company not
counting BRK and FRFHF. Hmm, I'm not sure FRFHF asked to vote on executive
compensation, but I would have voted for it. Fairfax chairman's letter is worth
reading ( http://www.fairfax.ca/financial.htm ) even if he channels Buffett a
bit.

So vote early and vote often.

ATT paid ~7x EBITDA for T-mobile USA. it's not cheap but also not terrible
expensive given that the technology is compatible (Both have GSM) and there are
a lot of redundant assets and costs that can be taken out.

The big question is if the merger goes through and what strings will be
attached because ATT post TMO merger will be the biggest company on the block,
even beating Verizon Wireless.

I have a small S (Sprint) position which allegedly was in merger discussion
with TMO too - maybe they get swallowed by VZW (both run a compatible CDMA
technology network).

OT? - As a consumer and T-mobile customer I weep at the merger. T-mobile was a
good company in various respects. I doubt AT&T will be such. And the choice of
a globally compatible US carrier - which means GSM - just went down to 1. (I
will never use CDMA carrier that means no roaming or huge roaming pains
internationally).

re T-mobile -
 As a consumer and T-mobile customer I weep at the merger .

Agreed, one less choice is bad for the wireless consumer> I like T-mobile too
(still have a prepaid backup account). Sprint appears to be in a dead end now,
if this merger get's approved by the FCC. I do assume that the FCC will put
quite a few strings on ATT before approving the merger.

FWIW, S stock is down almost 20% (down .71$) as we speak. it's clear they need
to do something. if FCC allow TMO/ATT, maybe they will have to allow S/VZW too,
or a merger of the regionals like Metro or US Cellular.

I think some equipment/network manufacturers will be hit too - the Capex
savings will come out of somebodies business.

i think you are battling windmills. us small fry dont count for diddly squat as
far as board representation or executive compensation unless there is a proxy
battle. i look at my proxy statements now and then throw them away. what I do
do is send furious emails to the ceo's office when i am pissed off enough and
complain on these boards. that rarely works but it makes me feel better. i
believe the media reads these boards sometimes will pick up on some particular
theft of shareholder resources like when the board gave the ceo something like
$100 million to compensate him for his losses on purchases of chesapeake stock,
or when those ****!!! boards repriced options when the shares fell.

shareholder abuse is a fact of life and its hard to do anything about unless
you are big enough to be an activist or hire attorneys to protect your
interests. actually much worst than the executive compensation issue is when
they sell the company out from under you at a ridiculously cheap price, Seagate
for example, or sometimes they just sell significant assets for a low ball
price and the senior management leaves and takes over those assets. I wish i
could see this stuff coming but its difficult because as a value investor you
always hope to buy something cheaply but of course management is even better
equiped to determine value than outside investors. and even the
bigger investors tend to vote for ridiculous items sometimes like when
endeavour convinced shareholder to vote for the acquision of their investment
bank which they overpaid up the wazoo for.

While voting may not change things, apathy will definitely get you nowhere. And
you're wrong - even with no proxy battle, the votes have gone pretty close on
various things that matter in last couple years. In big companies too.

Perhaps things would be different if shareholders acted as business owners
instead of throwing proxies into garbage.

Edit: some info of how funds vote on compensation and other shareholder
proposals:
http://www.ici.org/pdf/per16-01.pdf
http://www.afscme.org/docs/AFSCME-2009-Report_Compensation-Complicity.pdf

Although funds trot managemen/BOD line a lot, sometimes they are supportive on
compensation and other issues. IMHO, adding your vote is at least a possibility
to influence the policy either at company level or at mutual fund voting level
or at political level.

fear but i have also reached the point of no maas where i am not willing to put
any more money into chinese equities, until management gets their house more in
order and have a better understanding about what what is needed to communicate
to invesstors and how often. given all the accounting issues and questionable
business practices surfacing I would expect the chinese governement will become
involved because my guess is that it is now impossible for a chinese small or
midcap to raise any more money in the united states. we may lose some money but
i expect some chinese managers will be losing their heads.

I just love how the article starts with talking about "top holdings at Dodge &
Cox". Then they switch to "their latest buys from the period ending
12/31/2010". And finally they end up giving five names that are
$218,000-$367000 positions of the $45B fund. Yeah, each of these positions is
less than 1/100000 (0.00001) of the total holdings of the fund. It's like if
you had $1M portfolio and the journalist started to gab about you purchasing
$10 position. Ain't Seeking Alpha reporting wonderful?

Disclosure: I respect Dodge & Cox guys. However, I have sold my shares in the
fund last year, since I thought I will do better by investing myself. No
holdings in securities mentioned by Seeking Alpha article.
