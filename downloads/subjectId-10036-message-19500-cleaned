Pacificare Health Systems (PHS now, was PHSY), discussed here many times, has
come down in price (from high of $42.72) to where (~$30.) I'll add just a
little to my position.

I've not played this stock well. I trimmed the position before a large up-leg,
and when the stock was discussed here & I agreed that it was a good buy (also
before the nice run up), I failed to add to my position. And I did not sell
while the stock was peaking this year. Still, I'm grateful for what I have from
a ltb&h position.

In past, this stock has occasionally been very volatile. I believe there were
some days of 5 or 8 point gains or losses. Maybe one doesn't equate volatility
with risk, but that kind of volatility can be heart-stoppingly scary,
nonetheless.

Jmo, I could be wrong in buying now - either I might be adding too late or
maybe adding too early.

Psr about .6 and forward p/e under 10 (It seems). Relatively low. P/book has

Watson's 2Q Profit Drops 31 Percent

Watson's 2Q Profit Drops 31 Percent on Declining Sales of Branded Drugs,
Charges

CORONA, Calif. (AP) -- Generic drugmaker Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. posted a
31 percent drop in second-quarter profit, hurt by declining sales of branded
drugs and higher research and development charges during the period, the
company said Tuesday.
ADVERTISEMENT

Quarterly income fell to $34.9 million, or 32 cents per share, from $50.7
million, or 47 cents, in the year-ago period. Excluding a milestone payment of
$6.4 million, or 6 cents, to Kissei Pharmaceutical Co. and a charge of $2.4
million, or 2 cents per share, from paying down debt, Watson's earnings would
have come in on target with analyst estimates for earnings of 40 cents,
according to Thomson First Call.

Total revenue climbed 12 percent to $399.4 million from $355.9 million, lifted
by new products introduced in its generic division, which grew 39 percent to
$224.3 million, Watson said. Generic drug growth was offset by an 11 percent
drop in brand division sales, falling to $165.8 million from lower wholesale
and declining sales of Watson's pain products.

The company increased its research and development costs by 65 percent to $42.5
million from $25.7 million during the quarter, from greater investment in its
product pipeline, which includes the $6.4 million payment to Kissei, Watson
said. Watson added that it currently has 80 drugs under development and 29
generic drug applications on file with the Food and Drug Administration.

Watson said it expects third-quarter revenue of $390 million and earnings of 44
cents to 46 cents per share, excluding a projected after-tax charge of $6.4
million, or 6 cents per share, from previously disclosed organizational
changes. Analysts put the company's income at 45 cents on revenue of $390
million, compared with last year's earnings of 47 cents on revenue of $359
million.

Full-year earnings are anticipated in the range of $1.85 to $1.90, excluding
one-time charges, on revenue of $1.6 billion. That compares with analyst
estimates of $1.83 per share, and last year's earnings of $1.86 on revenue of
$1.46 billion.

Shares of Watson rose 1.3 percent, or 31 cents, to $25.01 during pre-market
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Now, 'double' is down 3.0 (a 10 % drop since end of March) and 'safe' is up 0.8
% or less than a 2 % drop. Safe passed double some time in the last week or so
(actually, more like double passed safe in reverse).

ps My portfolio is mostly 'value' stocks discussed on either this or Dale's

most over that time period. In fact, those who made nice gains by buying bios
the last time they were near or below cash value (or thought about it but
passed) may wish to take a close look at a strategy of buying a basket of cheap
bios again. There aren't as many as cheap as then but many are priced as if
there will never be another drug successfully brought to market so they might

The overall portfolio value is down during the second quarter and up quite
nicely year to date.

Of the items I either sold since 3/31/04 or round-tripped since then: I've got
9 transactions that qualify: 7 were gains and 2 losers. Of the gains, 5 were
companies whose fundamentals I liked and whose technicals looked like a big up
move might be imminent, so I bought calls, which leveraged the gains nicely. Of
the speculative stuff, Dan River lost 75% of my money in them and IPIX made
150% return. The calls were in AAPL, AHC, and APC.

Overall, YTD through 7/31/04 the combined portfolios were up 18.8%. The action
in August has lessened the performance, for sure, but I haven't quantified it
and now won't really do an overall return valuation again until year end.

another test. When the dust settled down, today's market action gave a "Perfect
Confirmation" of the sell-off. July 1, 2004 is the first day of this sell-off
according to my technical model. The market indices will very likely test 2004

Thanks for the kind words! As far as a board is concerned, I have nothing new
to say and not much to add. Why would I do it? Seems to me that there are
plenty of boards and plenty of folks espousing value selection, they don't need
another redneck with a brainstorm! <GGGGG>

As far as a fund.....well I have the TimbaBear funds! <GGGGG> They keep the
wife happy because she is a cruise-aholic and we can cruise three or four times
a year. They are providing nicely for the rest of my lifestyle and the
retirement accounts are growing nicely, what else do I need? House is paid for,
cars are paid for, could be debt free elsewise if it were convenient, but at
these low rates, I'm making more than it costs, so I'm using the money for a
while yet.

If somebody wanted me to run a fund, I'd probably have to show up regularly and
in a tie and punch a clock and move and ....this dog's gettin' too old for all
of that.

Wouldn't mind running a fund if I could do it 100% my way and 100% from my
house! Don't suspect there are too many of those opportunities around! <GGGGG>

Guess I'll just have to struggle through without the headaches!

Really, though, who knows maybe this is all just a short term phenomenon for
me. After all, I got burned pretty badly in 2000. Although I like to think I've
really wizened up, maybe there are other great lessons just waiting their
opportunity to educate me?

As far as WSCI....yep, still holding on. If it breaks below $2.00, I'll add.
Good fundamentals, dividend now over 6%, only debt is for the building they
just bought. What's not to like? Of course, they got snookered by the rise in
commodity prices, but that's a short term deal. I'm sure the contracts, as they
come up for renewal will have that issue adequately addressed. Meanwhile, they
have no problem in affording the dividend and I have no problem in collecting
it.

Interesting excerpt from Greenwald "Fool" article:
 Of the 25% return, about 22% of it came from purchases at lower prices than
the initial purchase. We've got Walter Schloss's archives, and it looks like --
we haven't got the numbers yet -- a large percentage of Walter Schloss's
returns have come also over time from knowing that you're buying something
worth buying. And then when it goes down, not getting frightened and dumping
it, but continuing to buy.

down (if given the opportunity) is one that is deployed by successful value

So many people would rather take a short-term loss than go for a long-term
gain, it seems.

I'm no fan of Investor's Business Daily with its No 5 rule:

"Cut every loss when it’s 8% below your cost. Make no exceptions so you can
always avoid huge, damaging losses. Never average down in price."

It has been hard for me to accept that there are a number of equally valid ways
to investment success. I am one who looks for a normative approach -- what is
THE best way for the average investor? (Or even is there a one best way?) If
there are equally valid approaches though, then it is my opinion that each
investor must determine if he/she is by nature or temperament an "average up"
investor or an "average down" investor. Or maybe one just chooses the much
rarer (I presume) case of plunking it all down at once and making no adds or
subtracts. One could also avoid the issue of what to do with fluctuations by
making time dependent buys (ala DRIP investing).
------------------
It seems to me that many people who put so much credence in doing good DD
before investing seem to blow it by scaring themselves out of positions
afterword - they let Mr. Market's low price determine their exit point.

-------------------
OTOH, I could be very wrong in my opinion. Plus, I'm not totally consistent.
I'm still holding - but not adding to - IACI, UTSI, maybe others that've had
severe drops recently. And I'm trimming, not adding to, my very small ABT
position when it's down here at lows. Each stock situation is different, but
for me, my general proclivity is to add when stocks are down (assuming I have
funds to do so, and I'm not so beat up or scared to act). For me this has
generally worked out satisfactorily. OTOH, there HAVE been instances when I've
continued to add to a position and the stock has just fallen into bankruptcy.
Ignorance and/or stubbornness can be dangerous!

More on concrete innovations from NYT:

Concrete Is Learning New Tricks, Like Letting in the Light
By MARK GLASSMAN

WASHINGTON, Aug. 9 — The giant drum on Robert Brown's idling cement truck
rolled and rolled as he sat sweating in the driver's seat. If there was novelty
here, it was lost on Mr. Brown, but three blocks away from his construction
site, in an air-conditioned exhibition at the National Building Museum,
spectators stared at concrete as they might at a marble sculpture. There
concrete has been put on a pedestal — also made of, well, concrete.

For Mr. Brown concrete is more a blunt tool for basic walls and foundations
than an architect's nuanced palette. At the construction site, not to mention
in popular fiction, it is more often seen as a cheap and ugly way to get the
job done: the stuff of parking garages, driveways, heavy shoes. The province of
men called Mac, not Libeskind.

But concrete has a rich history in aesthetics. Though it has been responsible
for much that was dreary and utilitarian, it was also the glop that built the
Pantheon in Rome. And now architects have returned to it as an aesthetic
device.

The National Building exhibition, running through Jan. 23, showcases how these
designers are using it to develop innovative structures and forms, challenging
the drab tradition of one of the world's most common construction materials.
"People think of concrete as being this one kind of thing," said Martin
Moeller, the curator of the show. "In fact it can be almost anything."

The exhibition, "Liquid Stone: New Architecture in Concrete," explores how
architects are using concrete with greater efficiency and panache than ever
before. It has four sections: structure, surface, sculptural form and new
technologies and formulas.

The 7,000-square-foot show smells vaguely industrial. The eight-room display is
a collection of colorful pictures that hang on gray walls, which underscores
the divide between the dull, rectangular conceptions of concrete and the new
methods architects are using to twist and turn it.

The first of 29 new designs, the White Temple, is a simple Zen sanctuary built
outside Kyoto, Japan, in 2000, and in some ways it is the piece most indicative
of Mr. Moeller's point. It is a plain, white monolithic chamber, but unlike
most rectangular buildings it is seamless, a goal achievable only in concrete.
"The idea was to create an absolute solid whole," Mr. Moeller said, explaining
that the symbolism held religious significance.

The designs in "Liquid Stone" show a keen awareness of their environments. Many
play with natural light in unexpected ways. In the White Temple, small slits at
the edges of the ceiling allow sunlight to enter the chamber. In Cambridge,
Mass., a new dormitory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was built
as a concrete exoskeleton with perforations for light. With its gridded
windows, the exterior of the dormitory, Simmons Hall, invokes a sheet of graph
paper or an overgrown Univac punch card.

Other structures in the exhibition let concrete flex its muscle. In the south
of France, the Millau Viaduct is strung together on concrete spires, some
taller than the 984 feet of the Eiffel Tower, but they were made so thin that
they hardly block the town's view of the high Pyrenees.

Technological advances to strenghten concrete are also changing the interiors
of new high-rise buildings in New York. "You can make the columns that are
holding up the building thinner, which gives you more rentable space," said
Carl Adler, vice president for sales at Quadrozzi Concrete in Queens. Mr.
Adler's company provided the concrete for the new Time Warner Center on
Columbus Circle.

Other buildings in the exhibition illustrate how architects use concrete to
create new kinds of surfaces for their structures, often embedding exotic
materials. At the Awaji Yumebutai International Conference Center on an island
in the Inland Sea near Kobe in Japan, a shallow pool has a honeycombed concrete
floor, and a seashell is set in each of more than a million of these concrete
cells, creating a distinctive and colorful surface just beneath the water.

In California the sea-foam green walls of the planned San Jose State University
Museum of Art and Design are to be made of concrete panels that get their color
from embedded shards of recycled glass.

But concrete can also be smoothed and made into an elegant, even surface, as
the exhibition shows. "You have to treat it like the icing on the cake, because
that's what it will become," said Deborah Berke, an architecture professor at
Yale University.

The recipe for concrete has evolved a great deal since it was first used in
ancient Rome. The ingredients then included lime, volcanic ash and in some
cases milk. By the 1700's they included an aggregate of small pebbles and a
substance called hydraulic lime, which hardened when water was added. In the
19th century Portland cement, a fine artificial powder, was the main binding
agent in concrete.

Later builders inserted metal rods into wet concrete walls, thereby reinforcing
the structures they support. Today steel-reinforced concrete is a staple of
modern architecture.

"Concrete is virtually always reinforced, but people don't tend to see the
reinforcement," Mr. Moeller said. Visitors to the show walk through fields of
hundreds of metal rods that appear to be growing uniformly out of a concrete
base like reeds. It is these rods that absorb the thousands of pounds of
pressure that might otherwise collapse a building.

The most confounding display in "Liquid Stone" is a translucent concrete wall
at the end of the exhibition. A light shines onto the face of an apparently
solid concrete wall but also permeates through small slits in the opposite
surface. The wall is made of a new material called LiTraCon that is embedded
with fiberoptics, which allow light to be transmitted through the solid without
compromising the strength of the material.

Mr. Moeller said "Liquid Stone" was part of a loosely knit series at the
National Building Museum on construction materials. He did not say what would
be next, saying only, "There are unusual things going on with plastics right
now."

Quick update on UTMD. (Related to sell/buy on loss? :)))

Stock plunged 33% today on FDA lawsuit to stop company selling its devices
because of "ignored repeated warnings from FDA regarding company's

FDA refuses to talk with the company, etc. Much more detailed account of both
sides of the argument are in articles and press releases.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=utmd

IMHO, there is some personal fight between UTMD and FDA. Unfortunately, it led
to this lawsuit. It is impossible to tell how this lawsuit will be resolved.

Although I think that UTMD is well managed good company, the current price is a

regarding: "Cut every loss when it’s 8% below your cost..."

I may have seen an article a few years ago in Individual Investor or NAIC which
summarized and discussed the percentages advocated by some published
professional investors who used these figures as part of their sell strategy. I
don't recall ever seeing any statistical testing for a justification for doing
such types of selling.

I checked Dr. Graham's Intelligent Investor, and I don't see any discussion of
it by him. Nothing in Martin Whitman's Value Investing book either that I spot.

Just pulling a couple more books off a shelf, Seth Klarman ("Margin of Safety")
says, (pp. 218-219):

"Some investors place stop-loss orders to sell securities at specific prices,
usually marginally below their cost...Although this strategy may seem an
effective way to limit downside risk, it is, in fact, crazy. Instead of taking
advantage of market dips to increase one's holdings, a user of the technique
acts as if the market knows the merits of a particular investment better than
he or she does."

and:

"If selling still seems difficult for investors who follow a value-investment
philosophy, I offer the following rhetorical questions: If you haven't bought
based upon underlying value, how do you decide when to sell? If you are
speculating in securities trading above underlying value, when do you take a
profit or cut your losses? Do you have any guide other than 'how they are
acting,' which is really no guide at all?"

John Spooner ("Do You Want to Make Money or Would You Rather Fool Around"
(aside: an informative and interesting read- as you might suspect from the
humorous title)) writes (pp.55-57),

"The key to good stocks that go bad is, do not be frozen at the switch. React
to problems; develop a plan."

In interviewing an investment pro with more than 40 years experience, this
person told Mr. Spooner (himself a money manager), "First of all, you have to

One strategy he might use ("if your disaster is basically a good company"): "I
accumulate more of the stock at desperate prices to try to cut my average cost
per share, and I employ patience, the true investor's greatest asset." Another
strategy: "I double up on my disaster stock, and 31 days later, sell the
original shares to establish a tax loss."

Cutting losses rule

A cutting loss rule seems to me to be in opposition to the basic principles of
value investing. However, it might make some sense for growth and momentum
stocks, which are much more dependent on investor sentiment and earnings
trends.

So I could see where it would make sense for some investors , but not for
others. I, of course, don't follow this rule.

Here's Michael Burry's thoughts on the subject, taken from his value stocks web
site ( found on the Internet Archive :
http://web.archive.org/web/20000229032335/www.valuestocks.net/howtovalue.html )
:

" 7. Don't be too afraid to be afraid of commitment.

Once a stock has been found to be a fundamental value, it often pays to buy a
half-position initially if the stock has been falling. Then, if the stock
continues to fall significantly you can average down into a full position. At
the same time, you have minimized the impact of a single stock-timing decision
and likely removed emotion from the equation. If the stock moves up as
expected, then you can increase your position -- there should be a sufficient
margin of safety to allow this.

Be wary, however, of using half-position strategies to substitute for
knowledge. The strategy is meant to help mitigate the effects of falling
knives, not to allow sub-par stocks into your portfolio."

The issue for investors here might be -given all that's now known about ANF and
current price, does one see ANF as a cheap growth stock (therefore, a buy), or
is ANF just a retailer subject to fashion whims and therefore cyclical in
revenue and earnings, and thus deserving of a low or lower p/e multiple (and
lower stock price)? I have no answer, but I hope ANF might eventually deliver
the right amount and kind of inventory to their target customers. So I'll hold
my very few shares.

"Cut every loss when it is 8% below your cost. Make no exceptions so you can
always avoid huge, damaging losses. Never average down in price."

I could not disagree more IF YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR COMPANY. That requires a
concentrated investment strategy (to know each company well), which is not
possible for many people.

The reason for my view is very simple. Ask yourself (1) do stock prices vary
wildly around a much less volatile fundamental trend line, (2) do fundamentals
vary wildly around a much less volatile stock price line, (3) are both
relatively stable, and (4) are both quite volatile. Those are the only choices.

I have no difficulty choosing (1). That means that if you have a very good
understanding of the fundamentals you are in position to make a good assessment
of when a stock has become "mispriced". That is when you can make real money.
The opposite conclusion, that when the price has dropped a bunch it means the
fundamentals have as well (and you sell) is in my opinion a much poorer odds
strategy.

(long)Interesting article in today's NY Times investing column
("Why the Sidelines Are Looking Good to Managers") about how "Some of the most
successful value stock fund managers" have moved a large portion of their
assets to cash.

Robert Rodriquez: 39% cash
Mason Hawkins: 29% cash
James Gipson: 27.5% cash
Wallace Weitz: 30%
a couple others: 20%, 15%
(aside: Warren Buffett's cash hoard wasn't mentioned)

I looked cursorily at the funds of these four managers. (aside: These guys
apparently manage several funds each: I only looked at the one's the article's
author, Carla Fried, mentioned.)

There were only four stocks that were duplicated among each manager's top 25
holdings. Longleaf and Weitz both own Telephone and Data Systems, and Weitz and
Clipper both have Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Weitz and Hawkins have Hilton
Hotels.

We here and others have talked about style investing - (the importance of
having a style(!)) - Many studies or many pundits believe that being consistent
within one's style generally has produced better returns over the longer period
than changing investment styles to try to capture what's in while avoiding
what's out. So I will concede that the four people above have a defined style
and they're apparently sticking to it. One could assume no or little overlap
among styles, and therefore, little or no overlap among stocks they selected as
values.

Still, it seems odd to me. Perhaps these guys are just making a bet that the
market's going down, there'll be better bargains ahead, therefore hold cash.

OTOH, within each of their portfolios there are stocks that are near annual
lows. I would guess that even for fund managers that might be constrained by
their bylaws (e.g. if one of these guys must have only large caps), among the
roughly 73 other issues that each manager might see if he looked at the other
three guys' holdings, he might find SOMETHING that would pique his interest and
would be trading near its lows or away from its highs - and maybe low enough to
buy now.

For example, Longleaf has AON and a Japanese traded insurance company. So
they're at least willing to consider the insurance biz. How about they look at
Marsh & McLennan, a Clipper holding, near its lows of the past few years? As a
small buy perhaps, a commitment of cash anyway. Rodriguez has made a bet on
three oil drillers/suppliers. Gibson a commitment to three large pharma's (PFE,
WYE, and apparently JNJ most recently). Neither of these areas appeal to the
other guys though.

I am concerned that the market might decline further, so I understand the need
for cash. But with all the investing resources these fund managers have, it
seems to me their circle of competence would encompass at least a couple more
stocks the others have.

In any case, several stocks of these top value players are available to others
at near annual lows now. Some, if not most, have been mentioned here before. On
a continuum, they can't all be in that "hold" space for these managers; some of
the stocks ought to have slipped back to "buy" for them and for us.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BLI,ROST,AVT,SWY,THC,ORI,KFT,WM,PKS,DIS,LVLT&d=s

In any case, I already have at least a couple of the stocks held by each
manager, and I'm willing to consider adding to positions as well as starting
new positions in others that they have: I've been looking at PTEN, and I might
re-look at MMC.

Just my observations and opinions.

Apparently a strong franchise:

http://www.fool.com/News/mft/2004/mft04072216.htm?logvisit=y&source=eptyholnk40
200

Compared to past several years, the stock is selling at a low psr and low p/bk.
Stated (but not tangible) book value has increased every year since at least
'95. The stock trades near an annual low and at the lower end of its historical
p/e. Profit margin per Yahoo is 2.6%. Margins have fluctuated in past: 2.6% is
below the 3.4% average of the past eight years (excluding a loss year in '97).
So I'm guessing they might be able to have a good year again in future if they
can hit their average. (Of course, -g-, they could have a bad year or years
again too.)

I'll bet on a revision to mean. According to S&P, the stock's high annual
prices from '95 through '04 have been $26.25 ('95), $28.50 ('99), $32.06 ('00),
$33.37 ('98), and $39.12 or higher every other year.

If people will want stocks in future, and if SCHL does have a franchise, then
I'll bet at some point I ought to see 10 or more points higher on SCHL than
today's current $27.45 price.

A little nervous from the market's recent fall, I will commence with a very
small purchase today and lag into a position if I can.

Fwiw, I've bought a few shares of Par Pharmaceutical (PRX) today. The stock was
written up in a Morningstar article on high rev. growers. And revenue growth is
strong. At current price, that makes the p/sales ratio relatively low.

In the past few years profit margins have been high, although they do seem to
be coming down: 19.9%, 20.8%, 18.5%, and now Yahoo shows about 16%. Prior to
those years the company showed losses.
As might be expected the stock price in recent years has reflected the good
performance, and maybe also the recent drop in roe.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=PRX&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=

It just seems to me, that PRX - with a current p/e of 10, a forward p/e of 13,
strong revenue growth apparently continuing, and still very good profit margins
- ought to sell at a higher price and multiple in future - IF current
performance can be sustained. OTOH, I'm not knowledgeable about the generic
drug business, and I wonder if it might be so that these companies come to
market with a knock-off of a popular drug (e.g. PRX's Paxil "eqivalent" saw
$77.3M last quarter, vs $0.9M the previous year.) to skim good profits only for
a while. Then soon enough, sales ($) decrease while volume (pill quantity)
stays high, and nobody makes any money on a now very inexpensive drug. Which
means it's a race to develop & get approval for a continuing stream of
going-off-patent drugs, else no sustainable sales or profits. Which, if so,
means to me, generic drug companies maybe ought to be selling at quite low
p/e's.

I'll take a few shares of oil construction service company GLBL at current
price.

Apparently business is too competitive in the company's Gulf of Mexico arena,
so they are moving the business to areas where they believe profit
opportunities are better.

Company is losing money now (as it often does, i.e. in 5 of the past 11 years).
The stock, now at $4.27/sh. dropped to maybe about $3.5/sh last year, and
that's been the historical low for about the last seven or eight years. Mr.
Market has wanted the stock occasionally and has been willing to pay over $15
for it in better times.

In May, Mr. Dore, Chairman, bought $1.4M shares worth, paying between $5.09 and
$5.24/sh. I'll tag along after him now.

Ah, GLBL, a flash from my past. Checked the records, in at 5.67, out at 11.19
in '99. I won't mention this was a result of a swap from another oil services
company, Hvide Marine, which had been a disaster for me.

For a contrarian play, GLBL looks interesting. There are some questions as to
its ability to maintain compliance with its loan covenants, however, which
merits questioning. The fact that Mr. Dore purchased at higher levels can be
taken as a positive sign.

FWIW I like MMC even more at these levels, factoring in how Mr. Market is
treating JNS today, with settlement news.

Russ Berrie: Long ago I used to follow this stock when it was a sawbuck ($10
bill) at best. Sad to say, in the past decade I've not watched it. Margins
improved and stayed very good (from maybe 3% to maybe 12-15% over the past nine
years).

This year is not a good year for RUS. Apparently Mr. Berrie has died, and the
insiders (Mrs. Berrie) brought in a supposed terrific manager. He's now
restructuring, refocusing, and disposing of non-core assets. This has shot
earnings and dropped the stock. So far, the price has fallen to near it's March
'00 low.

Imo, it's worth making a bet now on Mr. Gatto, the new CEO.

In the innards of RUS there are still the teams of designers and marketers
who've been very successful in past in creating, marketing, and distributing
the gifts, etc. that are RUS's core business that have brought the good revenue
and profits RUS has enjoyed. I look for these folks to continue delivering on
their good ideas.

The company has increased book value every year since at least '95. This year,
probably not. But I will bet the performance can right itself once a transition
period passes. (So I am hoping).

The current dividend yield on the stock is 6.46%, so a stock buyer is paid for
waiting.

The stock, at $18.74 has no ltd and about $185M ($9 in cash/cash equivalents)
behind it. That gives Mr. Gatto plenty of options. (I hope he picks wisely and
well.) The dividend depletes cash at about $25M per year, so I don't see the
dividend in jeopardy now. Net current assets are about $16 per share. With a
stock price of $18.74 now, that ratio of NCA:price is pretty usual these days
for a non cigar-butt company.

(I'm using 3/04 data; with losses reported recently, cash and NCA numbers would
be lower I believe.)

In for a small bite today. Assuming no unexpectedly adverse news, I'll likely
add more if stock continues to drop. I'm envisioning maybe a 12-18 month
holding before some of the restructuring results are reflected positively (I
hope) in the stock price.

Jmo and I've been wrong many, many times.

Regarding "different value investing" approaches, where the leading value

I like the RUS idea, although I think the stock will continue to make new lows
after ex date. I also think the company would be better served by cutting the
div., but with about 25% of shares out held by insiders, the pressure to hold
the div. is there.
It looks like Marty Whitman is a holder FWIW.

Ratio of Price to BV is favorable, as is the current ratio, and lack of LT
debt.

The big question remains can Mr. Gatto jump start this company? Will the Spider

Gatto's background.

TimbaBear. Feels just like the dot-com mania on a small scale. Only this time
I'm in, and with buys all over the place. And I continue to add.

While I suspect that many manias may be viewed with a similarly jaundiced eye,
I wonder whether oil has yet reached that vaulted genre. The P/Es of the oils
sector don't seem to have gotten exorbitant for the quality of profits and
operating margins in the business model.

There has been real progress made in the Chinese economy moving into successful
capitalism, at least that's how I read the events of the last few years. Like
most, I think this will ultimately translate into increased demand for energy
resources. Since nuclear power takes a lot of time to "come on line", I think
the demand will play itself out primarily in the oil arena.

Other big population centers seem to be similarly successful in moving more
into the mainstream of capitalism (India, etc), with correspondingly increasing
demands for the energy reserves.

While the situations in Russia, Venezuela, and the exploding mid-east all serve
to bring into question the consistency of supply. Additionally, these areas do
not seem to have the ability to significantly overproduce the current demand
which does not seem to bode well for accommodating a growing demand curve.

Good chance I'm gonna get my head handed to me if there's a bubble that bursts
and prices come down enough that I and others suddenly come to realize it's all
just been speculation.

The current geo-political situation does have a risk premium added into current
per barrel pricing, but I would be quite reluctant to assume that stability in
all supply regions would permanently result in lower prices.

Having followed your "buy and infrequently sell" postings over the years, I
don't think you'll get hurt too badly as long as you keep doing what you've
been doing: Not buying indiscriminately.....and having a preference for
dividends.

I'm pretty optimistic on the independent refiners and have continued to add to
my positions.

Times are good for the refiners, and my premise is that that will continue,
although maybe with lots of earnings volatility.

I suspect it will continue to be difficult for new refineries to be built. That
limits entrants, but also, I hope, diminishes the options that current refiners
have with their new-found profits. Already we are seeing monies used to pay
down debt, in some cases substantially so. If these companies can stick to
their business and not try to diversify into non-core stuff, maybe we'll see
some good share buy-backs or dividend increases as well.

Insider trading in this sector is interesting. I notice plenty of sales of
which a majority seems (as I glance at Yahoo) to be cashing in of options.
Which I would expect given that stock prices have come up quite a bit from a
year ago to highs not seen in twenty years (TSO). Tesoro's CEO apparently
bought about $1.1M worth of stock though at about $22.5 in an open market
purchase on Aug. 11 (Stock closed @23.52 on Fri); the CEO of PCO bought about
$1M of his stock on Apr. 11 at $34/sh. (stock closed @33.29 Friday). So those
million dollar purchases reinforce my idea that maybe these execs will be, if
not astute, at least careful, how they go about increasing shareholder value
about which they have million dollar reasons for doing.

Hi Paul - What's your opinion on SFL or their parent company FRO. Both
companies are in the shipping business. SFL was spun off from FRO last year and
generates it's main revenues from a fixed (long term) service contract from
it's parent.

It appears that both companies generate significant free flow cash flows from
their operation, have an investment strategy to upgrade their fleets and have a
history of paying excess earnings to share holders in the form of (1) a good
quarterly dividend and (2) special (stock & cash) dividends from time to time.

I suppose I see it as both a "value" play and growth opportunity as their fleet
of ships transport both oil and commodity goods around the world (including
to/from China and India huge growth markets for the future).

Any opinion?

Added to SFL after I received shares. Bought more FRO in March and May. I like
the sector for the next 18 months.
To spread business and geographical risk (different types of ships depending on
destinations)and my lack of understanding of implications of hedges that some
companies use, I have a package of these companies - e.g. OMM and TNP as well.
The stocks seem almost always to sell at low multiples; now they've moved up to
higher lows (compared to other sector p/e's). Maybe that's as good as it'll
get. OTOH, more oil demand means more shipping demand and higher rates and
profits. Back on that other hand, a terrorist attack on a port (or ship) might
smack these companies stocks.

Regarding FRO and looking back when it was discussed here (FRONY) in '01 (from
my records; SI search doesn't seem to be working now): that was the time to buy
to garner very good results, if the buyer held on. Regarding FRO and looking
forward: prospects seem much brighter, but the price is so much higher now too.
I'll bet there's more in FRO and SFL, and I'm holding on. I started with FRO,
and so I just have more shares of FRO than SFL. I don't have enough knowledge
to offer an opinion on which is the better bet, SFL or FRO. I'll have both and
take my chances. (You might check the Yahoo thread to see what the latest
opinions are on SFL vs. FRO.)

Thank you for your observation. I may be late to the party on this one but it

a few shares of SFL as this gives me a vested interest to follow the company
more closely.

Another sector I have been eyeing are the regional banks. I have been
accumulating NYB below $20. Are there any other regionals that contain hidden
value that you might be watching?

Finally, on the retailing side I like ABS, JCP and S because of the hidden
value in their real estate holdings. However I sold both my S and JCP as they
have doubled in the last 18 months. I also have hedged my gains in ABS as I
believe management was way off track with their recent acquisition of the Shaws
stores ($2.5 billion). They were making pretty good progress with their prior
three year restructuring program but this recent Shaws purchase may have
delayed their potential recovery by 24 months. I am a buyer of any one of these
companies below $20.

I'll ask a question that may have been asked before. What would you buy if you
believed that the oil prices were going to go up slowly + in jumps in the
foreseeable future? Don't answer: oil cos. It is quite likely that the cost of
exploration will increase and the revenues may not grow much, so oil companies
will not gain much from the price increase. Or am I wrong?

Oil futures would be best, but they are bad for 5-10 year horizon with slow
increases in oil price, since you cannot buy 10 year contracts and the time

Eric Strohmeyer. Well, I have NYB and ABS also, and I'd also consider adding

I'm not aware of any hidden values with any of the bank stocks I'm watching. My
favorite "regional" now on a straight price/value basis (i.e. ignoring
geographic specific risk) is Dale Baker's pick of CIB. I've added to a position
in BFCF at higher prices; it's a holding company where I hope the parts held
are worth more than BFCF stock. (A big holding of BFCF is Florida regional
bank, BankAtlantic (BBX), another stock discussed here when its price was much
lower. BBX is expensive now imo, and if BBX price should come down that might
also change (worsen) the value proposition for BFCF.)

Grommit,

Thanks for the pointers. A few random thoughts:

- Tankers. I don't like it, since if production stabilizes/drops, then their
profits will drop even as energy prices rise. Same for pipelines and service
companies.

- Alternative energy - I agree with you: pretty much no interesting companies.

- Someone recommended Toyota as a leader in hybrid car field. Tough to say if
the lead is large and autos would suffer anyway as profitable SUV sales drop.

- Tough decision in oil sector is: I can't rely on previous profitability of
companies, since resource overcounting/exhaustion may kill old favorites. OTOH,
valuing and buying companies that previously had poor track record is tough.
How to know that they will do better when prices rise?

- Maybe I should just buy a sector fund. Any ideas?

Oil futures,

Futures are not options, so there is no time premium. In fact, since the crude
oil curve is backwardated, you would make a lot of money if the oil prices in
the future were flat from current spot levels.

I see December 2010 NYMEX crude oil contracts quoted at 34.83, so you can buy
futures at least 6 years out at a significant discount to the current spot
price, although the bid-ask spread will be wide in the back end of the curve.

 It is quite likely that the cost of exploration will increase and the revenues

I would chip in that this logic does not apply to oil sand reserves. Most oil
sand project have reserves that will last for 25+ years, it is just a matter of
getting them out cost effectively. These projects require very high capital
expenditures and have high execution risk. With oil prices consitently high the
owner of those high cost long l;ife reserves should be able to make a bundle.

Generics and big pharmas. Madharry, it seems to me all these companies are
dismissed or approved based on somebody's analysis of whether the pipeline is
full or empty. Over the past decade, I've heard from one analyst or another
that the pipeline is empty for about every pharma company, only to have another
analyst be quoted in the media a year or so later saying that very company's
pipeline is strong; it's another company's pipeline that has a dearth of
product. Isaly and the media like LLY. Seems like media pundits were
questioning LLY's product lineup just a couple years ago. And now I'm reading
that somebody believes ABT has a strong pipeline - I had not seen that in a
while. I understand that pipelines could get filled or emptied, but how
analysts say strong or weak in just a year or two period, when these are big
companies always with many irons in the fire, well, it seems to me these guys
themselves often don't really know. (Mr Isaly's opinion is not to be ignored
though, given his good track record.)

If generics only have a six month window for profitability, then I assume the
generic companies must know this and so they know they must continually
scramble to get new product out the door.

As regards PRX, it's so that there have been many profitless years. OTOH, PRX
has been profitable since '01, and analysts are expecting profits for '04 and
'05.
Nevertheless, your (and Mr. Isaly's) concern has validity
for me and that translates into my taking on only an exploratory position. Low
relative p/sales, insider buys, attract.
