Whether out of cowardice, fear, lack of money...I'm willing to wager on some
stocks only a few shares at a time as they fall. But when you intend to buy a
couple of shares of Cisco ("two shares of CSCO") that is REALLY a few.
I hadn't considered going that few. -g-

Although...with the continual losses I'm seeing, maybe if I'm buying, buying
only two shares at a time of any of these stocks IS the better way to go.

TNL & TEX - scary how low those stocks have fallen. Really scary. TEX @ 50$
looked like a great value pick just a year ago, now in the teens and a day more
like this in the single digits with the company trying to preserve cash.

I have never seen the economy breaking that hard before. Single sectors yes but
the whole economy seems to be hitting a concrete wall at 60mph.

I think stocks related to infrastructure are really dangerous right now.

FWIW I was aiming to purchase more Nestle but the limit order never hit. Aiming
too low I guess. Sold TSM with a very small loss after seeing "limit down"
futures and the mess in Asia. Accidentally sold FMX this morning. Realized my
mistake and bought it back cheaper. I guess I should do this more often. Also
bought some DLR.PRB stocks and some PM today at the close for good measure.

I figure that folks are still going to smoke in a recession, although there is
currency risk now with PM since the US$ is rising against almost anything but s
few Asian currencies. Still 1/3 in cash after todays close.

Jurgis, my comment to a couple of large moat/ tech stocks. i think those stocks
will outperform because the have key products that people/companies will not do
without, IMO

CSCO should do OK. Maybe it's not cheap enough but i think it will come out of
this downturn even stronger. I think they will see spending coming back first
as well and they generally have excellent balance sheets.

INTC - similar situation - pays you a little (3.8%) while you wait.AMD is
greatly weakened, they have the playground for themselves again.

TSM - also a powerhouse - I was stepping in yesterdays but was too chicken and
sold (and consider myself luck with a very small loss). Next month numbers
should be horrible since many of their foundry customers will put the feet on
the brakes. but this will pass and if they get clobbered their competition will
get even more so. TSM is the world wide leader, has a cash rich balance sheet
and should do OK. I will wait a little to get back in - maybe after their
earnings announcement ina few days. TSM also pays a nice dividend (although
there is not guarantee that they will hold the dividend)

MSFT. I like it and I own it.

EMC - under consideration. Looks cheap but moat is the weakest of this group,
IMO.

EBAY. trades with the valuation of a retailer but still shows grows due to
Paypal and Skype. Excellent balance sheet but they do need to reinvent their
main product (EBAY marketplaces). High FCF yield and good balance sheet. I own
it as well and recently bought more.

This is one that I'll admit to totally miscalculating. If this is the mother of
all meltdowns, then we're probably in a period where we stumble around, and may
be lucky to tread water for a number of years.
OTOH, there are tons of stocks trading at ridiculously low valuations either on
a cash on hand/book value basis, or percentage of dividend yield.
On the latter, a company like VZ is paying out at the 7% level after having
just increased the payout last Q.

Bill Gross of Pimco has said that he does not believe this to be caused by
panic selling, rather it has, and continues to be, a result of forced
liquidations.
I guess the ominous question one needs to ask, if you buy into this, is what
happens when and if the panic selling does happen?

Spek, do you use Morningstar reports for your DD? :) Your thoughts sound a lot
like their reports. :)

CSCO - I went to a talk by their CEO couple weeks ago. Of course, he claims
that CSCO will gain market share and grow during the slowdown.

However, CSCOs big push now is teleconferencing and collaborative work.
Teleconferencing is definitely getting more use with business travel budgets
cut. It is just not clear that CSCO will get great revenues and margins from
teleconferencing. Companies try to get cheapest solutions although there is
some barrier of entry for high end videoconferencing. Even there I am not sure
CSCO is the leader.

Collaborative work is even more questionable. IMHO this is strictly software
domain where CSCO is not an expert in any way. MSFT is probably the company
best positioned to benefit from any collaborative work improvements, since they
control the OS and they can use that knowledge and expertise to enable
document/work sharing. Even then I have not seen a lot of successful examples
of collaborative work. Most people still just send around documents as files
and collaborate through email, phone, IM. Screen sharing solutions are used
sometimes, but that's mostly MSFT and IBM and perhaps Interwise by AT&T. So
color me a sceptic on any breakthroughs in collaborative work and that CSCO
will be a leader there. BTW, I regularly attend research presentations in this
area and again IBM + MSFT are clear leaders. And IMHO even their research is
mostly not convincing.

Anyway, I still think that CSCO will do well, but not necessarily spectacularly
well. :) I own a small position.

I have not looked at INTC in depth recently. I did not like their situation of
pretty much competing with AMD on price. Their ROE is not that great and they
are not very cheap here.

MSFT - I love its cash cow aspect. I am not sure if they will be able to
transform the company into something like IBM: with more focus on services for
long term. They are doing some good things. I own a small position.

I think that GOOG is coming to buy range. It could be a good buy in terms of
moat, valuation is the key question though. There is also a risk that their
income is concentrated in a single area, while their attempts to diversify so
far have been more of attempts to diworsesify. There is no clarity that the new
products bring a lot of revenue, earnings or leadership. They may strike gold
somewhere though.

ORCL and ADBE may be another couple to follow. Not cheap though.

Jurgis, it seems that you are working in the Hi-tech field.

Anyways, i used to have access to Morningstar but don't have and don't desire
them any more. I think their reports are worthless. For one I found that their
research is too shallow and sometimes misses key issues that other brokerage
reports sometimes do point out. I attribute this to the fact that their analyst
are spread too thin and cover many companies.

CSCO collaborative push makes sense but i could well envision a cheaper and
more open solution than the Cisco system. For example Sony almost has all the
tools already there- the amazingly capable PS3 as a media serves with build in
networking (collaboration does already happen in online games), HD cameras, LCD
screens. If they can all that make work with each other seamlessly in a secure
and easy to use package we are almost there.

None of the companies will be an extraordinary performer but each will survive
whatever the market throws at them. That's worth something these days.

I just bought some additional shares of Old Republic International. ORI is a
consistently profitable, and very boring diversified insurance company
headquartered in Chicago. ORI's two main divisions are general insurance and
mortgage guaranty insurance. General insurance lines are consumer credit
indemnity, commercial multi-peril, and general aviation coverages. I cover
mortgage guaranty insurance below.

http://www.oldrepublic.com

Oophs, I mean it was boring until it was discovered the ORI mortgage guaranty
insurance division insures unpopular mortgages. Subprime, ALT-A, 2-28, ARM, 0
down, negative amortizing, etc. mortgages. And you know what, ORI is booking
losses and its stock is getting hammered. As reflected in the current quarterly
results.

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/081023/aqth517.html?.v=27

Yet, I am not distressed because ORI has been in business over 80 years and
prides itself in maintaining its dividend (of 0.68) that now is yielding over
8%. Another perk is ORI periodically issues special cash dividends and stock
splits.

This is a 2 fold operation.

1) to buy consistently well managed financial under book value - ORI current
book value is 16.91 while its market value is 8.05 - because in due course the
market value catches up with the book value.

2) to buy in a bear market, specifically finance stocks are in the toilet, so
now is a favorable time to buy well managed, proven stocks and wait until the
financial panic subsides. I will report to the thread on ORI from time to time.

Off the subject, did anyone get the name of that train that rolled over my

Carey,

I've come to the conclusion that investing in insurance and reinsurance
companies is a faith based investing. It is impossible to know if they wrote
insurance (and re) at good price points. It is tough to know what they are
exposed to. And it is tough to learn what they have invested the proceeds into.
Any of these parts of the chain can blow up into huge mess as we know from AIG
and you are seeing with ORI.

I faith invest in BRK and WSC. I tried to buy some SWCEY on Buffett's
investment that is now very under water. I am thinking of buying MKL and Y that
are often called mini-Berkshires, but I am not committed. A friend suggested
AFL, you recommend ORI. I am not sure I will buy them at all.

I also have some GNW and AIG bonds and I am probably more sanguine about them.
I missed an opportunity to get rid of GNW bonds last week for significant gain
though, so I may have to bear the risk for a while longer.

Hi Spekulatius

ANGLO AM PLC ADR (AAUK) is a good one I have held for many years (back to the
DeBeers days). My last sale was around $29! The company pays a good dividend
(twice a year now yielding over 5%). AAUK makes my top five holdings list. I
think my over all cost basis is around $3.00/share.

It seems like any rally we achieve ends in an end of day sell off. The theory
is that these sell offs reflect redemptions from the previous days close. Many
of the stocks I have purchased in the last two weeks are now trading at lower
lows.

I am holding off on new buys until November and have allocated a set amount of
dollars to work back into the market at that time. Buying at these levels will
certainly result in getting some good values, but by waiting you may be able to
pick them up a few dollars cheaper.

Well done with your new buys.

Well, I got some buying done, though not as much as I really wanted, although
that also means not as much as I'd feared (margin). My orders remain, as this

be some tax loss selling.

Hi Paul Senior. Hope you've been well.

I see my old standby RPM is now paying a 5.6% yield at current levels. But then
I suppose that yield is not unusual in times like these.

Best wishes,

P.S. - Another "high" yielder in my portfolio is MXIM, at 6.1%. And then
there's MCD at 3.5%. We live in interesting times.

Hello, I2. Yes, RPM. In "normal" times, it'd be a buy at current price. Maybe
now too. Just that there are so many attractive opportunities that relatively,
RPM might not be so attractive.

Hi Paul - What's your strategy for selling your higher priced shares and
booking losses? Are you accumulating more lower priced shares first and then
plan to periodically sell the higher priced shares next year? I want to
maintain my sector weightings but do not want to get caught short waiting the
31 days to avoid a wash sale.

I have been buying more than selling but wanted to develop a short and long
term selling strategy. Any suggestions for optimizing the portfolio for these
types of transactions?

From:Paul Senior
EKS, my tactic is to sell higher cost shares that are now losses. Generally
those higher-cost shares are recent buys (less than 1 year). I've got enough
losers where with some, to keep the position size, I can sell now and buy back
in 31 days, and some where I figure stock is so low I'm better buying more now
and maybe selling some 31 days later. Just a guess which way to go.

Right now I have net long-term capital gains which exceed my net short-term
capital losses.

My intent is to continue selling short-term losers to the point where net
short-term losses exceed net long-term gains by a goodly amount. Selling to the
extent this will give me a $3000 off-set to income and where I'm sure I'll have
a substantially net short-term loss carryover into 2009 (to use against any
capital gains I might have in 2009).

Last year I had huge amounts of capital gains (compared to my previous taxable
income) that I had to pay taxes & AMT stuff on. This year, because I've so many
stocks in a losing position, I'll minimize my overall tax bill while trying to
position myself for some capital gains maybe in 2010/2011 -- if capital gains
would even be possible in the market then.

holding. However, if these are Chinese securities, then perhaps they do not
contain toxic mortgage pools. ;) I continue to hold, and may add if it falls

My friends say that there is some moat for MXIM and LLTC. I also looked at MXIM
and LLTC Morningstar reports that give them "wide moat" rating. However, they
also say that MXIM is getting into consumer analog chips where they compete
with TXN and National Semi. Morningstar does not expect price war though. They
also have some qualms about LLTC. For me, the issue with LLTC is their negative
equity. Yes, they produce enough cash to cover the debt, but I still don't like
owning companies with negative equity.

I will have to think more if I want to buy MXIM or LLTC.

Seems to fit Ben Graham criterion for a net-net buy. Namely, stock price is 2/3
of net current assets. Also for you, Jim Clarke, perhaps others here, and maybe
for Ben Graham (It's not clearly mentioned as a criterion in "Intelligent
Investor"), the company is profitable.

Of course, it's a dink company, marginally profitable in a competitive tech
business. Key issue as you say relates to those large marketable securities -
what exactly they are - and what the company might do with them.

Paul,

I do not consider it "a losing position" while company is not squandering cash
and not losing money (i.e. it is having positive income and/or cash flow). :)
It becomes "a losing position" to me only if there is a permanent destruction
of capital through bad investments, loses or something similar. :)

Not that I always wait for good valuation to return. I sold KONG this week,
since I found another opportunities more compelling. I bought some CRDN -
another one that reported positive but low earnings and went down to book value
- and GTE.

I still hold HRAY, LTUS, CHME, CPHI, BID - wow, it's below book now!, CLLZF,
PRC stub, CX, GPOR, GU, IR, PKX, PRXI, SLT. I don't consider any of them
impaired although I may have to look at BID and PRXI. :) I also hold ASFI,

A few days ago I said it feels like the economy hit a concrete wall while

the sharpest slowdowns in the world economy on record. I expect we could see
several (2-3%) % of GDP contraction in Q1&Q2 2009. Hopefully I am wrong on that

CX - I don't see CX facing a default. They are paying down debt, they have 4.8
interest coverage ratio. However, they may have problems getting cheap debt
next year. Also selling assets currently is very difficult plus they will get
very poor prices even if they sell. They may have derivatives and currency
fluctuation issues since almost all their debt is denominated in US$ and Euro.
IMHO, they will survive intact as a company and may be a leading company for
another cycle. However, CX would not be my first choice to buy at this time. I
will hold my position if the stock remains at current levels, but I doubt I
will add to it.

Have you read their Q3 report? I think that it is very informative of where the
company is, what are the good things happening and what are the challenges. I
have also looked at Morningstar report which mentions the same issues but is
also positive overall about company.

One of the question marks with CX is the derivative positions that they hold.
Morningstar lists it as one of the bearish factors concerning the company.

"CEMEX has a number of complicated debt-related derivative financial
instruments that are difficult to evaluate. These may become liabilities amid
the turmoil in the global economy."

The WSJ highlighted some of the complicated financial arrangements that they
have used in building their debt structure. Here is a link to a post I made
earlier in August.

HIG - was briefly discussed here a few month ago. i think i pointed out a CS
report indicating problematic assets on balance sheet. Now all major life
insurers have problems on their balance sheet. I think MET's book value
including unrealized losses went down 10$/share YOY. Life insurers have LT
contracts so they do not have to show unrealized losses on investments unless
considered impaired, but still this is a scary number. I would guess that MET
should be OK and in case there is a run on life insurers the treasury would put
them under their TARP. PRU should be similar.

I don't own any of those, though. I do have a position in HMO UNH and recently
WLP. I consider adding to AET as well. Those HMO have fairly little balance
sheet risk but it's a low margin business where small errors can have a
significant impact on operating margins as we have seen the last year <ng>.
Potentially we have some political risk as well - still I take that over the
imponderables for the life insurers at this point.

OT but head scratcher: oh wasnt this Paulsons old institution?

From the Daily Mail (hat tip Jesse):

Goldman Sachs is on course to pay its top City bankers multimillion-pound
bonuses - despite asking the U.S. government for an emergency bail-out.

The struggling Wall Street bank has set aside &#163;7billion for salaries and
2008 year-end bonuses, it emerged yesterday.

Each of the firm's 443 partners is on course to pocket an average Christmas
bonus of more than &#163;3million.

The size of the pay pool comfortably dwarfs the &#163;6.1billion lifeline which
the U.S. government is throwing to Goldman as part of its &#163;430billion
bail-out.

As Washington pours money into the bank, the cash will immediately be
channelled to Goldman's already well-heeled employees.

News of the firm's largesse will revive the anger over the 'rewards for
failure' culture endemic in the world of high finance.

The same bankers who have brought the global economy to its knees seem to
pocketing the same kind of rewards they got during the boom years.

Gordon Brown has vowed to crack down on the culture of greed in the City as
part of his &#163;500billion bail-out of the UK banking industry.

But that won't affect the estimated 100 London partners working at Goldman
Sachs's London headquarters.

The firm - known as Golden Sacks for the bumper bonuses it pay its top bankers
- is expected to cut the payouts by a third this year. However, profits are
falling much faster. Earnings have plunged 47 per cent so far this year amid
the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.

Readers are welcome to correct me, but M&A professionals (and I mean MDs,
partner equivalents) saw their total comp fall to 25%-33% of what it had been
in the boom in the dot-bomb bust (as in people who had gotten $1.5-$2 million
were getting $400,000). But now that we have bailouts, the reductions are
nowhere as deep as in the past, it seems. Of course, Goldman is special...or so
we are often told.

And in the old days when the firms were partnerships, in bad times the partners
would often take deeper cuts than senior non-partners. Bt the whole point of
being a public firm is getting to use, and occasionally abuse, other people's
money.

Several of the Brazilian companies hedged their currency transactions with
$US/$Real future contracts and got caught with huge losses with the recent rise
in the $US.

ARACRUZ CELULOSE SA(NYSE: ARA) is one that hit a land mine. Their original loss
estimate was $500 million but after an internal audit their loss ballooned to
$1.7 Billion. Finally, they reported this today.

UPDATE 1-Aracruz unwinds derivatives at $2.13 bln loss
http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINN0444177320081104?rpc=44

That loss represent $20/share. Yahoo reports book value at $18.00/share. Once
this loss is booked their new BV is negative! The company is discussing a
workout with their banks for a long term loan but this will double their
current debt load. The sad part about it is that the company is quite
profitable but now with this new debt load, it will impact their earnings many
years out as they pay down this new debt.
