re: Buy & Sell.
My biggest mistake during the past year was to sell too early. I agree with
Timbabear that to be really successful, one has to let winner run. All too
often i had the right stocks at the right time, but missed out on the big
moves, because i was happy to cash in. The other mistake i did was to
concentrate too much on the entry points but overall I didn't really scrunitize
my sell decisions too much.

I don't know what the right answer is. I found that swingtrading with volatile
stocks can be quite profitable even in a bear market, simply because the
volatility can work in one's favor. I did very well with biotech's in Y2000 and
Y2001, even though the stocks I owned went down, i was able to rack up very
good gains. With buy and hold, i would have lost a lot of money. However I
missed out on large gains once it was clear that the market was going up
consistently.
Part of the answer to the buy and sell question is to own stocks that one is
comfortable with, buying small entry positions and average down when the stock
heads down without obvious fundamental reasons. Likewise, i would tend to sell
in chunk's when the stock goes up. The other part of the answer is to never let
one position to become too big. I do have a limit for the maximum amount of
capital i am willing to deploy in a stock idea before i buy the first position.
This sum depends on how safe I perceive a stock, not on it's valuation. For a
safe stock like Nestle, i would be comfortable to invest a much bigger sum than
for example a small company like TRGL. This helps with respect to the "Sleep
well" aspect of investing and prevent's me from trying to dig out of an
investment idea going bad by averaging down and deploying more and more
capital.
Last not least i try not to restrict myself to buying stocks at low's once i am
convinced that the valuation is OK. Many times i have tried to time my entries
and never got in a stock that was going nothing but up. My solution is buy a
starter position immediately and try to time subsequent entries (averaging
down). That is what I intend to do with STHLY and BDK it is very very difficult
for me since i just love to buy at 52weeks lows and such.

Portfolio update - bought ABT, DHB sold TRGL
ABT@42.25. Stock has come done to very reasonable valuation metrics, despite
good news recently:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=ABT
+ PE about 16.5
+ Humira product launch successful
+ Compliance issues with Diagnostic division fixed
+ Stock has support in 38-40$ range

DHB @ 5.3$, Producer of bulletproof vests and body armor. Very controversial
stock and may just be a trading position. SEC investigation for related party
transaction. Huge growth, but management absolutely screws shareholders. I say,
get rid of them.

TRGL@5.36$. Interesting stock with huge following on SI. Undervalued on Net

When to sell,

Here's an idea about selling. Ask yourself if you didn't have a position would
you be comfortable buying the security at these levels? If not, then you should
think about selling at least some of your position (say perhaps 1/2).

Obviously the holding on strategy has worked better in the recent market, which
has been basically going straight up until the past couple of weeks. However, I
think risk levels increase quite a bit when your stock goes past a fair value.

Being risk averse, I tend to keep yet another Wall Street phrase in mind: pigs
get fat, hogs get slaughtered

I disagree with this approach for the following reason. There is a rather large
"hold" zone in between "buy" and "sell" zones. So there is no implication that
if I would not buy something, I should sell it.

For example, I buy at >15% expected annual return, sell at <6-7% expected
annual return and hoooooold in between.

If I used your suggestion, I should either sell or buy when I see expected
10-13% annual return - I don't think either of these are attractive to me.
Buying in the hold zone implies too much risk for too little return. Selling
implies too much left on the table, commissions, taxes, costs of searching for
alternative investments, etc.

Also your suggestion implies that if you buy just below X and sell immediately
above X (whatever X is: PE, growth, 75%of book value, etc.) then you get very
very little gain because you bought just under X and sold just over X.

It seems to me that there are potentially lots of strategies that work. and if
someone is really good at quantifying the risks and expected rate of returns
well and good. Unfortunately the information available to most outside
investors is pretty imperfect. I have lost money in the past on frauds- channel
stuffing, unanticipated massive cancelling of orders, fraud, etc. Most of my
losses could have been avoided had i followed arbitrary technical signals to
reduce my position. The other area of large losses was to buy into relative
valuations as opposed to absolute valuations. This worked in early 2000 but not
after that. Right now I am in the camp of buying low, selling some if the stock
no long looks like a bargain and holding the rest until techincals indicate its
time to sell.
Unfortunately its not easy to sell a stock after it has dropped 25%, when there
is no available reason to justify such a decline.
The other area of error is was not to pick up low lying fruit when available.
Sometimes prices get so low on stocks that my gut tells me its time to buy
some, no matter what the fundamentals look like- and probably I am right 80% of
the time-but i dont often enough pull the trigger because of some other
investment that i can take a more logical stand on-examples of this were
Phillip Morris at 18 , TransOcean at 18, American Airlines at about $1.50.

Maybe you might consider taking even small exploratory positions in a package
of these stocks that are based on your gut instincts. That'd reduce the cost
exposure of any individual selection pooping out, yet still give you a good
shot at overall gains. Especially if overall you have more winners than losers,
and especially if your winners show outsize gains.

In any case, if you suspect others like "Phillip Morris at 18 , TransOcean at

Madharry, great post and I had very similar experience and feelings.

I also think there should be a long "hold period" between buy and sell. Ideally
the stocks should be picked up under cash, and hold when the fundamental
improves and stock go up, until the expectation is well ahead of fundamentals.

It is very hard sell a stock after it dropped 15-25% with no reason. ALVR is at
such moment for me now. I believe the business is growing fast, more media
coverage is coming, but still the price went up too fast. Sell or hold? very
tough call. Maybe I am too greedy? Without that greedy I would have sold at a
double $3.7, triple 5.5, or whatever price below.

-with a K: It's been my feeling that I could be and should be more helpful here
by emphasizing much more the stocks that that I and others say they are buying.
Often, I want to say, "BUY THIS STOCK - it's dirt-cheap and a GOOD VALUE. Wake
up!!!!"

The problem with my wanting to say all this though, is that I've had GLBL (cut
in half just within a few days) CEGE going nowhere, AQQ drifting down, BAY
going nowhere, MSFT dropping, etc. etc. In past years, I've had many picks
crash into bankruptcy. I sometimes suspect I might pick more losing stocks than
anybody else on the thread. Anyway, I AM wrong many, many times. So I'm real
reluctant to pound the table on any particular stock pick - mine or anyone
else's - and say, "buy, buy, BUY!" I look through my list of recent purchases -
there are some that I'm real okay with - MCGC, MAT, VLO, BLI, OXY, DRD - I
expect for most all, that I might have to hold for a while to see higher
prices- but with my record of mistakes, I just cannot see the future clearly
enough to try to get anyone else excited about these.

The way I post, I normally don't mention particular stocks over and over again
that I am just holding, unless I am buying more, or maybe I'll just make an
aside comment when somebody else mentions the stock. So, many stocks that were
mentioned here a couple years or more ago, that engendered controversial
discussions here or were ignored here, and that haven't been mentioned here for
quite a while, these are the stocks I have or am about to take profits in now -
GD, BKS, INVN(!), ZQK, GET, FRE, etc., etc.

It's just that, when I look at this side of it, I start to believe I know what
I'm talking about.

An example (that seems to happen with some regularity): I have a choice of
seizing a perceived opportunity in a new-to-my-portfolio company that is
clearly underpriced currently or, alternatively, adding to my position in a
company that has moved up out of my definition of being underpriced, but the
price is still increasing and all other barometers are still positive (still
executing on plan, still as profitable, etc.)

In the above dilemma, I may be able to quantify how underpriced the first
choice appears to be, but have no reliable manner of determining how high the
price of the existing position might be taken.

I would take on the new position and continue to hold and watch the existing
one.

Hi Paul!

Our timing seems to be a bit out of sync. I have sold both RTWI and VC. VC I
just sold this week. I was up about 60% (after giving back some from being up
about 80%) and felt that the discount to the book value and the timing of the
cycle had changed enough when viewed from the protection-of-profits perspective
that VC no longer offered the same degree of margin of safety.

My recent purchases include MRO and TUG. Both are selling at a price which I
believe is a nice discount to their current cash flow. By my calculations,
MRO's current free cash flow is about 16% of their price, and TUG's about 14%.
They both pay dividends.

I follow the same policy as long as the stock being held isn't exceeding

Adding the new position diversifies the portfolio and lowers overall risk too.

Jurgis,

Your point is well taken, but perhaps you take the statement somewhat too
literally in the context of your strategy, particularly since I didn't say sell
all of your position but consider selling some of your position. However, even
with your strategy you could hold a core position and then trade in and out of
a portion of your position based on the stock's relative richness or cheapness.
I do this on occasion, and it seems to lower the risk of my portfolio.

In addition, I personally don't have the aptitude or foresight to estimate the
expected annual return of a stock except in very special liquidation
situations. I more have a feel for whether a stock is rich or cheap relative to
the market, and hence my suggestion makes more for those kind of investors. If
you are precise enough to estimate annual returns for your stocks, you probably
don't need a buy/sell signal such as this one.

Thanks for your comments (Jurgis as well --- you raised a good point).

I'd almost never sell if a stock dropped 25% without a change in fundamentals.
Exceptions might be (1) if I were too greedy holding on the stock in the first
place --- the stock was above fair value and I wanted to escape with some
profits intact or (2) the drop was an indication of insider
information/potentially bad news. Much of the time the illiquid stocks I trade
they move around for no reason, so I have trouble going with option (2).

I once heard Jim Cramer talk about this on his radio show. He would be in a
losing position, agonizing over it as it crept down, losing sleep and full of
doubt. His wife was the trader in his hedge fund and apparently much less
emotional, a TA type. She would sell off his losing position when he went to
the bathroom and when he would go ballistic would cooly say, "If you like it so
much, buy it back." He said he never would, glad to be out of it. In effect she
was asking the question for him by taking action.

He also talks about the emotional reaction to a falling stock and compares it
to buying a sweater on sale. He asks why do we think we've found a bargain when
we see the sweater on sale and snap it up while conversely when we see a stock
"on sale" we think it's damaged goods and don't buy? This kind of thinking
applies to me sometimes when a stock drops after lots of DD and I'm reluctant
to add to it because I conclude something must be wrong.

25% over a few days and stocks in downtrends that drop 25% over a few days. to
me looking at a couple of stocks Faro and kvhi both of which have dropped
rather sharply. if you owned them do you buy sell or hold?
I dont understand the weakness in faro, i did not understand the weakness in
kvhi until delphi announced they had developed a competing product. NRGN a
company that i have a full position ran up briefly when they annouced a sizable
partnership with Merck- the stock got as high as 11 and then dropped into the
8s, 7s, and briefly the 6s. I added to my position because i felt the stock was
below fair value. today they announced a private placement of $100MM at $7 a
share. I believe the information that they were looking to sell more shares
contributed to the weakness in the shares but there was no public release prior
to today. Now that the deal has been announced I fully expect the stock to
rally over time, and if I did not have a full position i would have added after
the announcement at these levels. the equity infusion to me makes the company
much more solid than before- cash will increase from 60 to 160MM and equity
will increase from 122 to $222MM or so, plus of course there is the comfort
that the equity firm has presumably done its due dilligence and is satisfied

the new competitor has not affected BDK's sales (that is a a "not affected YET"

Madharry, re: THC.

A good buy at current price imo for patient holders willing to bet on
management's success in restructuring the business.

On the one hand there's the decent asset base. THC operates the "strongest"
hospital in many of its locations, I am led to believe. OTOH, there are those
multiple investigations that dog the company. In addition, there are
sector-related problems - private insurers reluctant to pony up for increased
hospital expenses; ditto for the government's reimbursements. Additionally, the
unemployment picture means that uninsured and fail-to-pays are increasing.

I'm hoping 18 months from now, the situation will be improved. I have a decent
(for me) position in THC, as well as several other hospital/healthcare stocks.

I was too slow when THC recently touched new lows, but if I see the stock again
drop with no surprisingly adverse news, I expect that I will add more shares.

Pat, thank you for the info. I recorded that show and watched it last night. I
anticipated the mentioning since Tobin Smith recommended ALVR about two weeks
ago in his newsletter. He is the host on Fox Bulls vs. Bears show and normally
he recommends stock (if he still like it) after newsletter. There is also a
Forbes article about ALVR. Again nobody say ALVR is an undervalued stock, but a
market leader in a fast growing industry with huge potential (broadband
wireless, WiMax) usually sell at a premium.
http://www.forbes.com/technology/2004/03/19/cz_bb_0319inlchartroom.html

I brought up ALVR many times after it got out of the undervalued zone ($4.5,
book value) here on the value thread mainly to ignite discussions on selling
strategy of value investing. I don't believe in just sell all of them at "fair
value" (some define it as book value, others differ). I don't like the
statistician type of approach which totally ignore the business. We are buying
a company and it is very important to understand the product, market,
potential, competition, etc. For a great stock like this, it is very rewarding
to hold as long as the business continue to improve, gaining market share, and
market potential is gradually realized by analysts and main street media. I am
holding on to the core long position and may get in/out with a smaller trading
position.

Isn't it grand to see your deeply undervalued stock (ALVR at $1.86 with $3.3

Checking some of the filings it looks likes management own not too many shares
but have options for hundreds of thousands. the ceo who does own over 100,000
shares has some deal where he gets 2 shares of restricted shares for each share
that he actually purchases vesting over 3 years.
Looks like another heads we win tails we reprice our options deal for senior
management. It may turn out ok in the end but I have decided to put my money
elsewhere for now. I also have all sorts of concerns about Medicaid. I can see
the fed and state wrangling over medicaid payments and hospitals having to wait

portfolios --

My ACAS pick in the safe portfolio has had 2 dividends since you "bought it" at
$29.70.

A $0.06 on 12/31, and a $0.70 ex div date 2/24/04. So maybe it's time to adjust
the chart to reflect those dividends. If you change the purchase price to
$28.94, that might be the easiest way to recognize the dividends declared.

OT: Breaking form, I will try a short sale: MAXS

My record for shorting has been abysmal. Of the very few times in the past few
years that I've put on a short, I've not done well at all.

MAXS Recap: Management has rejected a cash buyout for $20. On the buyout offer
the stock had scooted up to $22+ where it now remains.

1. If a new or better offer does materialize, I don't see where or why it'd be
much higher than current price ($22). (I could be wrong; I don't know what an
aggressive buyer would be willing to pay to get this company.)

2. Imo, enough time has passed since the first offer that I would've expected a
higher offer, if it were there, to be forthcoming.

3. Prospects for the company remain very good (imo), but it is my opinion that
the stock price is high reflecting expectations of a new buyout offer. Absent
another offer or an increased offer, I have to expect the stock to drift down
below $20.

I'm betting the upside to the stock from $22 is limited, and that in this
market with the stock where it is, there's a reasonable chance the stock will
drift down if there's no further bid for the company.

Another consideration though is that even if it works out the way I hope, it
might take longer than I expect or have patience for. For example, MNY has been
above it's buyout offer for a relatively long time imo.

re ACRFY and HUWHY -
I looked at the last earnings report from ACRFY and the numbers looked quite
dull to me: earnings 50% down,rooom rates down etc. Also the valuation does not
look all that compelling. I never liked the capital intense hotel business with
its' low ROE too much.

HUWHY - intriguing company imo ,but a dangerous investment at this point. Last
earnings didn't sound good due to staggering 3G losses. The company is
realizing gains on its investments, so the real situation is probably worse
that the operating numbers presented by the company. The other business
(harbors, Oil, trading) seem to be doing well, so i guess they will be able to
dig themselves out of this hole but the NT outlook is not that great. I'll pass

Yes, I follow the drug stocks that've been mentioned here.

Among the big pharma I have shares in ABT, PFE, MRK, BMY, NVS, and JNJ. I'll
take more ABT if it hits new lows (drops a few more points)on no adverse news.

For a while I was interested in chemical companies that have a drug component:
I gave up on BAY and recently sold my shares at a loss. I've cut back my
position in AKZOY.

Of the smaller drug manufacturers, I, like some others here, have ELN, a stock
on this thread's FY2004 Double list. This stock has performed very well
recently. It's one of those stocks that one might have made huge percentage
gains on or taken huge percentage losses on, depending on what year in the past
five one bought, and if one sold out or added more at lows. (which I
unfortunately, did not)

It's my guess that on this thread, it's been the big pharma that's looked at
most when folks are considering drug stocks, and so these are the stocks that
are posted on most often here. However, imo, the real story and profits
(doubles, triples, etc.) have been in the smaller drug stocks that have been
brought forth here, but only occasionally - and with little or no follow-up
discussion. Particularly noteworthy are the several drug stocks that sold below
cash value (albeit with a burn rate). I am not sure, but it seems that every
one of these companies moved up substantially in price in the months or so
after they were mentioned here. I am still following some of these stocks.

I also still have stocks ancillary to the drug business. That would be, for
example, LH in drug testing (patient diagnosis), KNDL (contract research), a
couple medical insurance companies, some medical device companies, and the
medical supply companies which we've discussed here.

given that there is no FDA approved drug for POI or OBD available and Adolor

In addition, the new medications is a much needed treatment for chronic pain

Paul: I sort of 'shorted' MAXS by selling my entire position a bit below 22

line with value, I won't be actively shorting this despite agreeing with your

Interesting to note JNY's tender is below market price. Am I the only one that
finds that an odd tactic? I've previously only seen that done by scam operators
trying to skim a quick buck off the uninformed...looks odd, but maybe there's a
rationale....such as using the lowball to persuade holders that MAXS is not
worth much more than current levels...followed by gradual raising of the tender
till they get the shares they need to toss out the BOD & thus kill the pill.
This scenario could lead to modestly higher prices...which perhaps the market

Bought some more BMW preferred (non voting shares) for 22.5 Euro this am. The

being the voting right and the slightly higher dividend for the preferred. Last

better than that, with the new 5,6,7 series out. They are about to launch a
compact car in Europe - the 1 series. The US$ has recovered some compared to
the Euro so the pressure from exchange rates will diminish. They should be able
to make 3.5 Euro's this year.

I suppose the institutions holding large illiquid amounts of stock might find

I made (continue to make) good money in DUSA. Skin cancer/lesions is definitely
a super growth market. Another one I really like is IMX.

They have a "blockbuster" bomb detector in the "Quantum Sniffer" (demo'd on Fox
News last week!) and all indications are that the Navy is delighted with the
testing they performed. The qs uses a laser and gas chromatograph to"sniff'
explosive vapors virtually instantaneously. No swabs or lengthy analysis, just
instant detection in a handheld device. They already have a deal with Invision
(now part of GE!) and the publicity machine is really beginning to ramp up.
Check out next Monday's IBD where they are featured in "where the big money's
flowing", At the top of the list with an "A" accumulation rating.

The market potential for the qs is stupendous. At $25,000 apiece this item will
be a mandatory piece of equipment for every military unit, police agency, port
facility, sports stadium, border crossing, etc. The market is enormous even
without the military apps which is in itself is incredibly huge. Plus, the qs
can be "tuned" to detect a myriad of narcotics, if so desired. Anyway, you get
the idea. The qs is a serious detector of all kinds of contraband and IMX has
all the necessary patents and no genuine competition.

Every terror threat and bombing simply reinforces the need for widespread
deployment of this device. Remember, the qs is not a theory, it is a real
working device that is currently on a "road show" and showing off it's
capabilities on a daily basis. Very likely to end up as a part of InVisions
airport baggage screeners. Don't take my word for it. Go to yahoo and read the
pr's. They will make a believer out of you.

Now, the best part. IMX has a tiny float of only 4.6 mil. Market cap is right
at $100 mil. And they have warrants out that are currently priced at $5.09 that
will track with the common ($13.64) dollar for dollar. Terrific leverage
available with the warrants. Also, IMX is an extremely viable medical equipment
company even without the qs and have a number of exciting opportunities in the
cancer area. They don't need qs to make a buck. But their CEO has recognized
the potential of the qs and is moving heaven and earth to get this lifesaving
device into the mainstream and his success is beginning to become very
apparent.

The stock began to move Thursday and Friday but the "TASR-like" move is yet to
come. I think we stand a good chance of seeing that move begin Monday.

Paul, My expectations with HETC are growing sales with breakeven by mid 2005
assuming they execute plan which is growing sales while controlling expenses.
Part of the expense control involves no investor relations - therefore do not
expect many press releases aside from earnings reports; also there's currently
no conference calls. Do not use the general e-mail address on their website to
contact them - I tried. However, as a serious investor, my phone inquiries to
the company generated a response from top management. Right now I'd rate HETC
as high risk, high potential reward.

HETC. Oh it's high risk, I'd say. MAYBE high reward.

The question is, should the stock be bought, and if so, at current price?

My answer is yes, if this stock is bought as part of a package of such stocks.
(The same line I used 18 months ago. Shoulda bought DUSA as part of my package
tho' -g-.)

I say this because, over the past year, the totality of such below-cash stock
purchases has paid off quite handsomely (overall percentage gains) for buyers.
We may be in a different market now though. And this stock might burn through
all its cash. Time will tell.

I guess I need to dust off my Graham book or notes: If I recall correctly his
patience level for net-nets (which this co. may not be, imo, because it's not
profitable) was two years. In any case, for me, holding on to see breakeven (I
hope it occurs, and I hope it would affect the stock price positively)to mid
'05, is a quite reasonable time frame expectation.
-----
Aside: There MIGHT be something to say for others to follow closely your picks.
I'm not sure, I don't keep records and I've not researched this, but it seems
that of the few stocks you've mentioned here, there have been mostly (all?)
winners, some spectacularly so.

Friday. All told, got out with a 4% loss and will look at BEL again this

The Company has just been advised by two of its larger customers of the
likelihood of significant delays in shipments of soil from their sites. The
delays are due to site preparation activities on the customers' sites that are
not yet completed and are holding up the excavation and shipment of
contaminated soil. These delays were unforeseen by the customers and were
expected to be completed in late March and early April. As a result, the
Company will incur an unscheduled shutdown that could last for several weeks,
possibly until May or until shipments resume from these or other sites.
Depending on the duration of the shutdown, this is expected to negatively
impact the achievability of the full year earnings estimate.

The Company still expects to receive the same volume of contaminated soil from
these sites, however shipments will now commence at a later date than was
originally expected.

Cashed in on STHLY @ 20.89$. Wild move due to renewed IBD interest apparently.
The stock is still not overvalued by any means but i can't resist taking easy
profits here.

BEL blew up today on reduced forecast. I had only an starting position but it
still hurts. Either the fundamentals follow the chart of the chart follows the
fundamentals. :-) This time the chart was telling the story before the word got
out officially. My third blowup this year after ADG and MEDI. It looks like
this year will be tougher than 2003. Narrowly avoided blowups in TRGL and
CHAR.OB from the guru thread over there. I made some money trading both stocks
and now they don't look good any more.

With that many grenades going off close by I better wear my crash helmet :-).

XOCM does not look much better than your other pick in the telecom space GLBC.
XOCM has about 500m$ in cash and 500M$ in debt with long maturities, so there
is no apparent cash crunch. However they overpaid tremendously (IMO) for
Allegiance telecom assets paying 1x revenue while most ILEC's can be had for
.5x annual revenues.

However most importantly the recent FCC judgment will increase access chargers
for all ILEC's making a miserable business worse. Revenues are shrinking yet
all ILEC's are adding sales staff, this can't be good!

In hindsight seems like a classic case where the chart was screaming sell for
several days before the news was announced.

Re: BEL. It looks pretty cheap to me now. However, the one thing that bothers
me a bit is their options grants. Looking at the 40-F from 2002, it seems like
they're granting roughly 800K/year. For a company with roughly 16M shares
outstanding, that seems like pile. Potentially 5% dilution every year? If you
look at their pro-forma earnings if options were expensed, their basic 2002 EPS
would have been reduced from $0.79 to $0.69.

Does anyone have any comments on this? Am I reading this right? If so, how did
you get around it? Reason that the growth rate was high enough that the
dilution wasn't a big deal? Just hold your nose and buy?

This is totally unscientific, but I know of so many blow-ups in the
"environmental" field from southern Ontario, that's why I avoided BEL. Others
that I know of are Phillips Environmental and Laidlaw.

My disaster in the environmental field (a while back) was even further north,
HQ'd in Alaska - Martech USA. Didn't go merely Chapter 11, went all the way to
Chap. 7!:>(

re Allegiance - I didn't follow the company closely but my understanding is
that it was a straight bankrupty and the money went to the debtors plain and
simple.

Another stock that trades suspicious is UTSI, IMO. The latest announcement
regarding "Slight margin" pressure may be an indicator of more bad news. 2%
loss in gross margin (from 30 to 28%) in a short time is anything but small,
IMO.

There was a bizarre mania on the ALGX Yahoo thread that the common holders
would be taken care of by the wonderful management even in BK.

It was pretty obvious they were just blowing smoke up their own backsides.

Thanks.

The "wonderful management " is typically busy taking care of themselves or
trying to avoid jail time. Look at GLBC nowand the option grants, some of the
guys have been in place before bankrupty and continue to manage the company.
Just amazing! I wish I had a job where i could blow up so big and still come
out far ahead <ng>.

Another good value insurance play is UNGL. They do some unusual niche work; the
roster of investors in them is top-notch. I started a position at 16.35 and
plan to add a couple of bucks higher or lower, whichever way it goes.

UNGL
Yahoo numbers - p/e and book value --differ significantly from company year-end
statement figures. Based on the co's 2/18 numbers, it seems to me that there
may be several insurance companies out there that might be comparably valued to
UNGL.

A couple of positives:

Looks like current price is now better (below) ipo price.

I do see Liberty Wanger and Dreman Value as shareholders - a favorable sign.

The selling in UNGL has stopped - now if some new buyers just step in, it can
start a nice, steady move up to fair value.

That's the plan, at any rate.

I agree. It looks like a wonderful growth stock at a reasonable price, but the
chart didn't agree with my thesis! I decided something was known or believed
that I didn't know. I got out recently, and although I did OK, I kicked myself
for not selling above $40.

Sigh.

Headline alert - AMPH out with sparkling, sterling, kickass earnings, .31 EPS
for Q4 2003:

http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/040330/065149.html

One of the best value stocks I have come across in the past year, no doubt.

Was some margin of safety when AMPH was trading below stated book and closer to
cash. Very difficult to ascertain the business risk. Dink company, not even
clear from the link exactly what they do - "provide services"; they're in med.
mal. business -- and that is one risky area. It's taken out many companies. (A
couple I owned.)

It may be "one of the best value stocks I have come across in the past year"
for you, but it's not been one of the best mentioned on this thread (if it was
mentioned here.) If you are saying it's now, or still, a good value stock (a
buy), I suggest the risk/reward profile ought to be considered quite carefully
now by any potential buyers.

I just counsel caution for new purchases. Jmo, I could be wrong, the stock
could be a good performer from growing earnings. (Which would be very okay with
me since I still hold my few initial shares.)

The records indicate I didn't mention it here. I heaped praise on AMPH because
it has doubled for me and still trades at a low PE, even lower when you back
out their cash on hand.

Read their 10-K when it comes out and see how they work primarily in insurance
brokering and financial services rather than underwriting, you may find it
interesting.

I think it's a $15-20 stock based on last year's results, but JMHO as always. I
am holding all my shares from $5 as earnest money.
