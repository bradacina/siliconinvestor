OT I applaud the decision by the House to defeat the proposed bailout bill. It
was a stupid idea, drafted by a bunch of slimeballs IMHO. we need action that
will help homeowners stay in their houses, despite their decline in value. I
dont see how this bill will stop home prices from declining or reduce
foreclosures. not only that but there was nothing in the bill that determines
the order in which assets are purchased or the price to be paid for them. its
all left in the hands of the omnipotent paulson who's had 12 months easy to
deal with this problem and stop it from spreading. all of a sudden a bill has
to be passed within a week.

RE: "Well, you have no fricking clue what you are talking about."

Have you even read the half baked farce of a bill that almost passed? My guess
is you're the uninformed one, lacking in clues.

One of the worst provisions, aside from it being a blank check to cover losses
and manipulate markets at will, is it would eliminate "mark to market"
accounting, not just for banks, but for virtually all publicly traded
companies.

I assume that as you are posting on a thread where the subject involves real
value, you like to know just exactly what you are buying when you call your
broker. When you look at share holder equity, do you want to see junk bonds
carried at face value? Or would you like to know the true current market value
of those assets?

Unless you are totally brain dead, you want transparency in making your
investment decisions.

Why not try reading the actual text of this joke of a bill before spouting off
opinions that are based on hopeless ignorance?

If you had half a brain, you would be insisting those responsible for driving
our economy into the dirt be indicted, rather than bailed out.

There isn't enough money in the world to fix the mess that has been created by
these criminals. The only thing the bailout would do is put those responsible
in a position to take everything you have left that hasn't already been taken.

Not to be unkind, but I doubt any disinterested observer would have called that

After banking with Washington Mutual for over twenty years, I moved my money
out a week before it went under. At that, I feel like an idiot for waiting that

RE: "We need something passed and soon or my friend you will see a great
Depression"

I hate to be the one to break this to you, but we have been in a depression for
at least a year now. Home values have dropped more than during the depression
and will continue to fall. Unemployment rates are nearly that high and are
skyrocketing. The dollar has lost half its value. The cost of basic necessities
has climbed by 400%.

There is a saying, "When an elephant falls, don't stand under it trying to hold
it up.".

At this late date, the disease is the cure. "Too big to fail.", is a myth. The
reality is, "Too stupid to survive.". The only possible cure is to let the
diseased entities die off, so stronger and healthier entities may move in to
fill the void.

The system needs to be purged. Until that happens, no recovery is possible.
It's going to be bad either way. How long it stays bad will depend on saving
those that can be saved vs. throwing good money after bad in trying to support
the carriers of the disease.

You are wrong. You don't understand what the bill was trying to do. You cannot
mark to market in the middle of a panic when everyone is forced to sell. Would
you want to sell your business now? How about your house? How about if EVERY
ONE of your neighbors and local businesses had to mark their houses and
business to non-existing market? Would you get any kind of credit if you were
forced to mark your business to panic market? Would you get a mortgage if you
needed to mark your house to panic market? No way.

You are talking about some punishment, but that's not what's going on. No bank
can survive if there is no market for the stuff they hold. It does not matter
whether they made good or bad decisions. It's a snow crash, it's a wholesale
panic. Every time an asset drops in price, everyone has to mark it down. Then
the assets are even cheaper and you don't have enough capital to cover the
liabilities and you have to sell again. Vicious cycle.

Government is the only party which has enough money to provide the market. No,
free markets don't work in panics. If they did, bank runs would not happen.
Look, Buffett would buy these assets if he could, they are so cheap, but even
he does not have enough money. I would too, but it would make no difference if
I bought.

It's ridiculous to focus on revenge and retribution when house is on fire.
Sure, go ahead, kick "the clowns" instead of trying to get the fire
extinguished.

Good luck with your business. We'll see for how long you will get credit if the
trust is not restored. Perhaps the market will find a way out without
government intervention. I believe it will be much harder and much more painful
for all.

It is getting purged a we speak. MER,WB,WM,LEH, BSC are gone and many others

onth changed my opinion. During that week, both he money market and the
commercial paper market almost melted down. Both are connected - the CP is the
main source of short term credit for business, mostly those with higher credit
rating. If this happens all bet's are off. If large business can't get
liquidity smaller business credit inevitable will freeze and then we have an
economic meltdown. Paulson prevented that from happening by guaranteeing money
market funds. Is this fair compared to banks that have to pay FDIC insurance?
No it is not, but the alternative to being somewhat unfair is that the whole
financial system comes down and we will have the worst recession since 1980/82.

Now with the failed bill we are worse of as if it never had been introduced,

Im sorry you lost money in WB, I lost money in WM. I dont think either of these
banks had to fail. I agree that changes are needed but I dont think the
proposed bill was any good at achieving what needs to be achieved. For example:
it would have been a lot simpler had the feds increased the amount of fdic
insurance provided to $1 million six months earlier and had not permitted 100%
financing on mortgages to begin with, if the sec had enforced the ban on naked
short selling years ago, and if the government had flat out said we will not
let these institutions fail. Instead they just confiscated the banks and sold
off the assets to "friends" at the expense of investor and debt holders.
Now they have created a two tiered system- There are a select group of too big
to fail "friends of ---" financial institutions and then there are thousands of
others who are potential roadkill. How would the proposed bill have undone any
of this damage? To me this bill was and is akin to invading Iraq as a solution
to al-queda. rah rah rah but no connection. For example I think that it would
be much cheaper to increase the fdic insurance on banks to $1 million and spend
more money on regulating them properly, not letting them do stupid things that
nobody understands. Then banks could raise money in the open market, and the
fdic rather than rating agencies would be responsible for the soundness of the
institutions. Over time confidence would be restored. This is a plan under
which we would not be promoting the few at the expense of the many. We could
set up a
federal office in each state, who would have the power to modify mortgages
where the owner/resident can make a mortgage payment that would cover the
current 30 year rate of interest on what the house is currently worth. The
government could then subsidize part of the loss to the mortgage holder. In
return, the governement would get its money back, if the property were sold for
a profit at some future date. I believe that such a plan could keep a large
number of properties from being foreclosed upon and add to the current glut.
While I am not happy about authorizing the government to modify legal
contracts, clearly we are in a situation that call for drastic means, but they
should be means directed at solving the problems that we have, not creating new
ones without solving the old ones. On a corporate level, we could establish a
federal institution that would purchase real assets from financial institutions
at appraised values if need be. I strongly object to the purchase of multiple
asset backed securities. These are investment banking products that should
never have been purchased by financial institutions to begin with. If they were
stupid enough to buy them then they are stuck with them.

Don, so what do you think happens if the commercial paper market melts down
(meaning it become illiquid). I am honestly interested in your opinions about
that case.

My opinion is that it would be armageddon. Banks would become illiquid,
virtually all of them (at least the large ones, some S&L and credit unions may
be OK first until they get over by collateral damage). Also many industrials
would have to hit the market for hundred of billions in longer maturity debt to
replace the commercial paper, some would get it others don't. The ones that do
not would have to file for bankruptcy protection. You would probably wipe out
10% of the economic activity in the US, that's my uneducated guess.

I challenge you to come up with a scenario where how we could survive such an
event without dire consequences.

FWIW this is an on-topic discussion, IMO.

Hi Spekulatius - One area that concerns me is the potential "run" on the
mid-size banks (ie regional banks & local credit unions) that is not reported
in the media. I have read that there have been a huge number of "electronic
transfers" out of these institutions to treasury backed money funds or larger
institutions that have sizable capital reserves.

As over night paper becomes more illiquid large investors, businesses and hedge
funds are moving their funds out of these banks and credit unions. The capital
reserves for these institutions shrink (quite substantially in some cases)
which makes them vulnerable for failure. This becomes a never ending spiral
downward.

The Fed must increase the FDIC insurance amount for each account to stop the
outflow of capital from these smaller institutions.

I believe the FED can increase the FDIC limits w/o congressional approval and
should do so immediately. Lots of consumer loans are originated by local banks
and credit unions. Money would stay in the local region thus helping local
small business and consumer customers.

OT?

RE: "I challenge you to come up with a scenario where how we could survive such
an event without dire consequences."

We already have dire consequences and bailing out those responsible will not
change that. It simply is not possible to build a sustainable economy on
borrowed money.

I'm not sure how old you are, but I'm sure at least some of us recall a time
when if you wanted to buy a home, you put 20% down. If you wanted to buy
groceries, you paid cash. If you expected to get a department store credit
card, you jolly well had better have had a good job and excellent credit. There
wasn't such a thing as bank cards. "Sub prime" lending didn't exist. You were
either credit worthy or you weren't. If you weren't, you didn't get credit.
Banks were tightly regulated and just plain weren't allowed to get into
trouble.

There were occasional boom bust cycles, but they were isolated localized
events. There were occasional economic wobbles, but something the vast majority
of the population could ride out because they weren't excessively leveraged and
had money in the bank, just in case.

It was virtually impossible to get a falling domino effect because none of the
dominos were close enough together to tip anything else over.

Simply stated, the ONLY route to a stable economy is fiscal responsibility at
all levels: personal, corporate and governmental.

Is a return to fiscal responsibility likely to be painful to those used to
voting for bread and circuses? No doubt.

The bottom line is you get "dire consequences" either way. The question is
whether or not you want dire consequences to be a way of life, with no hope for
sustainable recovery.

Would you buy stock in a poorly managed company, with fiat assets, and
outrageous debt to equity ratios? If not, then why would you want your entire
economy to run that way?

Wouldn't it make more sense to invest your money in a financially sound start
up venture?

The FDIC has $45 billion to insure $4 trillion in deposits.

I don't think that's going to go very far, especially considering the FDIC
offered to guarantee over a third trillion dollars worth of potentially bad
loans as part of the latest bank take over.

I guess that's okay for fans of the bimonthly trillion dollar bailout packages,
but somewhere along the line you're going to have to pay for it with a massive
devaluation of the dollar. On the bright side, there should be plenty of banks

Hi Don - One idea is to only raise the FDIC limits for the smaller regional
banks and local credit unions. These institutions have the stronger balance
sheets and have the reserves (as long as the Fed can stop the outflows) to
support a significant amount of the local customer and business lending needs.
If these smaller banks begin to fail as a result of the current "run on the
bank", then the banking system will fail (FDIC goes bankrupt).

Remember that the FDIC is insurance and not a liability unless it is used.
Banks must meet minimum capital and asset requirements to be an FDIC member
bank. Any new limits might require a new internal audit by the FED of their
assets before they are granted to offer the increased insurance (say $250K per
account).

Have a two tier FDIC insurance class. Eventually money would flow to those
institutions with the best balance sheets. Banks with sour loans on their books
would lose deposits and the FED could do more of the WaMu forced mergers
leaving the "Bad" bank to wilt and die (shareholders equity vanish). These
transfers of deposits have no impact on the FDIC reserves while reducing the
sour loan liabilities.

The bottom line is that the deposits eventually flow to the strong small
regional banks, credit unions and a few large big banks. The total loan pool
(both good & bad loans) is now covered by sufficient capital reserves from the
remaining banks.

=============================================================

The $US dollar will eventually take the brunt of the hit long term but this has
been the standard policy for the past five years. It's easier to slowly grow
the economy and build the value of the dollar over time than to allow the
freezing up of capital flows.

Banks that keep their sour loans or have too many of these on their books will
be allowed to fail or must work them out over a long period of time by writing
them down against current earnings.

I think if the Fed implements such a tool (two tier class of FDIC insurance w/
current member asset audit compliance), all banks will be motivated to
liquidate their sour loans, merge with stronger banks or else be forced to
loose all equity (ala WaMu).

Maybe the "value opportunity" is to identify the very strong regional banks and
credit unions as these companies may the the final survivors once the sour
loans are flushed out of the system.

Adding a little to my few BRS shares as stock drops to new lows.

Kind of funny. BRS is a helicopter company flying material/people around Gulf
Coast rigs and such. One could bet that BRS would be a big beneficiary of the
hurricane-caused damage to the rigs, as companies rush to repair damage -- and
there is a lot of damage from Ike. The thing is though, that this time, BRS
facilities themselves in the Gulf got damaged, perhaps severely, and instead of
the stock being a beneficiary, it's dropped, perhaps because of the hurricane.

http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080917/bristow_storm_report.html?.v=1

These damage problems eventually get fixed, and I expect the stock, now about
$33 to be back over $50 within a year.

It looks like in 2004 a two tier FDIC insurance program was discussed.

Maybe it is time to re-exam the proposal.

TWO-TIER DEPOSIT INSURANCE SYSTEM DESERVES THOUGHT, SAYS FDIC'S POWELL
Publication: Directors & Trustees Digest
Date: Tuesday, June 1 2004
http://www.allbusiness.com/business-planning-structures/business-structures/110
697-1.html
From the article..."Our risk is increasingly concentrated in the largest
banks," Powell said, stating that specialized market instruments, such as
reinsurance contracts or catastrophe bonds, might come into play, along with a
separate premium structure to help cover this risk. Existing law, he said,
permits a two-tiered system for pricing deposit insurance..."

==============================================================

It looks like the smaller regional banks rallied today as their exposure to
these sour loans are not as large as previously thought.

There is lots of discussion to promote new regulations that make lenders
originate local loans, service and maintain these mortgages w/i the bank and
keep these loans as "portfolio" assets (ie not securitize and sell these loans
to other institutions).

This strategy would stimulate "local" borrowing and any new originations would
not be subject to other derivative hedges.

RE: "What do you think will happen when the commercial paper market melts down?
You think it will only affect some debt ridden companies that would go out of
business anyways?"

I don't think you understand the size and scope of the problem and what has
already happened. With or without a bailout, we're in heap big trouble.

Do you think a construction worker who has just lost his job and his home is
going to be buying widgets from XYZ, Inc.? Do you think the factory worker who
has lost his job and his home, because the construction worker can't afford
XYZ, Inc. widgets, is going to be buying widgets from ABC Inc.?

Do you think banks are going to keep loaning money to ABC, Inc. and XYZ, Inc.,
when their credit lines are maxed out and their assets are fully leveraged?

Do you think banks are going to be any more stable when ABC, Inc. and XYZ, Inc.
file for Chapter 11 and construction workers and factory workers can't afford
to make payments on their bank and department store cards?

Do you think banks are going to extend unlimited amounts of unsecured credit,
at reasonable rates, to unemployed workers that are in bankruptcy and
foreclosure? Or will they jack up the cost of credit so high no one can afford
it?

The mistake you're making is the assumption economic collapse is avoidable. The
economy has already collapsed and we're a long way from the bottom whether
credit is unavailable today or two months from now.

For every dollar that is thrown into the burst credit bubble today, it will
increase the length and duration of the depression we entered over a year ago.

Anything that could have been done to avoid further collapse needed to be done
two decades ago. The reason I can't answer your question is because it is based
on the false premise that collapse is avoidable. Businesses are going to go
broke and people are going to go hungry.

What I am against is making my survival less likely by paying to ensure the

Well, about all I can say is I hope I'm wrong. I don't see how covering
investment losses on real estate bonds is going to take a single foreclosed
home off the market, put a single construction worker back on the job, raise
real estate values, stop the half million a week flood of new unemployment
claims, lower the price of energy and food, or increase consumer spending on
durable goods.

So far, we had the Merril bailout for $40 billion. Several medium size banks
took out another $15 billion. Fannie and Freddie resulted in a blank check for
$800 billion and room to ask for more. AIG was good for $85 billion. Wachovia
resulted in an FDIC commitment for up to $350 billion. The Fed just passed out
half a trillion to foreign banks and another $700 billion will likely be voted
in before the end of the week.

That's $2.5 trillion so far, which is about half of what will be needed just to
cover the actual loans. The bill per household so far is over $30,000.

The last article I saw on the topic, globally, there is over $60 trillion in
derivative instruments currently floating around.

Do you know how much money you would have made if you'd invested in the Dow in

With cost still exploding and cost of equity and debt way up and crude down

OT. Adding a bit to my SLB position. Here's what SLB pres. says regarding
falling oil prices:

"Gould said although high oil prices have curbed demand in some developing
countries, energy supplies remain tight and a sharp drop in growth would be
needed to slow exploration and production.
But if that happened and crude oil prices collapsed, Gould said he saw very
little risk of that affecting demand for drilling for traditional oil reserves.
'I think there is an oil price level which firstly is going to kill all the
non-conventional projects: tar sands, shale oil, heavy oil. All this stuff will
go down first,' he said.
'Conventional oil would have to go very low for that to happen, and I don't
think there's much chance of that, even in a recession.'"

Buffett on terms slightly better (or maybe not) than they would have gotten
from Vito the loan shark. Part of the value to them is the implied Good
Housekeeping Seal of Approval from Buffett, since he presumably would not be

a great deal with their upcoming stock offering.

I have not been a fan of GE stock (both on the grounds of valuation and the

It very well might. Stock is still too expensive. Their EBITDA was about 40M$
last quarter, annualized that is 160M$. Same "store" EBITDA is down YOY. 1.5B$
debt. 60% of their EBITDA is consumed serving debt. This is not the sort of
stock you want to own right now.

Yahoo numbers seem about right:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=MIC

My verdict is that it's overpriced at 12x EBITDA. If you value it more
realistically at 10x EBITDA, the equity is worth zero.

Plenty of MLP's with less leverage can be had for <10x EBTIDA. Airport
companies can be purchased for 7-8x EBITDA. once they refinance their debt
(have not looked at their debt maturity schedule), the debt service easily can
eat up their EBITDA completely and then the equity is toast.

I think the whole Macquarie model ( buy stable infrastructure assets , lever
them up, package and sell them, rinse and repeat) is unworkable in the current

GE - yes unlucky first and incompetent second. Things are changing. they have
been rolling over huge amounts of commercial paper to finance GE financial at
very low (almost treasury like) interest rates. That does not work any more,
their credit spreads are up and they also need to finance more Long term with
higher rates. Both together will kill GE financial's profits.

The quip about offense is BS (IMO)> I suspect that the ratings agencies are
breathing down their neck (or maybe not they have been asleep at the wheel) or
even worse their creditors. So now they do this stockoffering what I call the
Buffet/Goldman 10/10 deal (1st 10 for 10% interest, 2nd 10 for 10% warrant
discount) and piggyback a larger offering for the public (of course without the
Buffet/Goldman terms).

It's bad but could have been worse. The Buffet bribe is worth the money if they
can pull this off at around 24$, they do not have to deal with shorts that
would hedge the heck out of this offering and kill the stock and it will the
credit downgrade demons at bay.

The big question for me now is why owning GE? I can buy industrial and
infrastructure and Media plays now for 10x earnings with growth rates equal or
better than GE and good balance sheets. Then I do not have to deal with the
financial baggage.I think a package of those will outperform GE. Sooner or
later GE will split GE finance from GE industrial. With a blended PE of 12 now
neither part is going to be a great deal, compared to peers.

http://xml.10kwizard.com/filing_raw.php?repo=tenk&ipage=5908277
Since Ultrapetrol began repurchasing its shares under the program on March 19,
2008, the Company has acquired 671,171 of its shares at an average cost of
$9.63 per share for a total cost of about $6.5 million. Approximately $43.5
million remains available under the program.

======================================================

Stock hit an all time low (again) today! The company has only 32 million shares
out. At current prices ($6.00/share), their $43.5 million could buy 22% of the
outstanding shares. Maybe the bottom is in. If I get chance at some shares
below $6.00, then I will add to my position.

I am also looking to add a few more shares of PBR but maybe oil will fall

that it traded for before any of its tremendous deepwater finds were announced.

RE: "I wonder what why you are posting on this board."

I was lurking to get a feel for less bearish views of the economy and responded
to a totally ludicrous comment about how wonderful a thing the bailout was
going to be.

RE: "I would be more interested if you would talk about investments you are
holding or buying right now"

I'm assuming the worst and that we have a long way to go before we reach the
bottom. Soup lines, labor camps, tent cities; all those wonderful images from
the 30s that everyone seems to have forgotten in 8 decades of blowing up a
bigger and better credit bubble.

Did you know that in 1929 if you owned 1 share of stock, you could buy 10 more
on margin, aka credit? What a surprise. It doesn't work any better on real
estate than it does on stocks. A 10% dip in the market results in cascading
margin calls, aka foreclosures.

Hmm, so when Paul Senior is buying high and selling low, he does not get such a
damning critique as does GE management when they do the same... ;)

Don Earl. Thanks for your contributing comments. We're not really about "views
on the economy" though, either bearish or bullish. You might find a more
involved and relevant discussion on other SI boards that are focused more to
your interests.

Paul,

Fair enough. The question has been raised as to whether or not the economy is
on or off topic as far as value investing is concerned. I agree it's more on
topic elsewhere.

I do lean toward the idea assets denominated in a currency that could
potentially be facing massive devaluation raises a legitimate question of
value. I also lean toward the idea future market conditions raise questions of
value.

For example, is General Motors a good value at a historically low price if no
one can afford a car? Or, is a low price on a stock a good value if the dollars
it is purchased with are going to be worth half as much in a year's time? And,
in terms of the bill that looks poised to become law, is there any meaningful
way to analyze the current value of a company's assets if they are not marked
to market?

I won't belabor the point further. Good luck and may the stock gods bless your
portfolio.

It's interesting that you mentioned the word incompetent as I believe we had
this discussion before.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=24773815

That said, I bought some GE yesterday. Why?

Greater financial stability, for one.
The Buffet halo effect, number two.
GE is a greater value play today than six months ago, number three
The dividend, number, number four, and five.
I have never been crazy about Immelt. But I believe this was a move he had to
make. Despite the numbers, as a percentage of stock, it's not a great deal of
dilution. It also could hasten GE being broken up.

While I wait, I'll be collecting the dividend.

First Industrial Realty Trust Inc. (FR) - First Industrial Realty cuts 2008
guidance
Friday October 3, 9:50 am ET
First Industrial Realty lowers 2008 guidance as tough capital markets hurt
asset sales

http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081003/first_industrial_realty_outlook.html?.v=1

From the article:"...First Industrial now expects funds from operations, or FFO
in the range of $3.45 to $3.75 per share, down from its previous range of $4.70
to $5 per share...."

===============================================================

Stock off 20%. The FFO reduction represents a 27% decrease which is pretty
substantial.

I continue to watch the REIT stocks but will wait a bit to nibble at some
shares. My favorites continue to be BDN and HRP.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BDN,HRP&d=s

It looks like there has been some forced sales in some of these preferred
shares too. I am looking at the HRPT PPTYS TR PFD D (HRP-PD) which now yields
about 12.5%. This series trades the most volume.
Series D Preferred Dividends

A distribution of $0.4063 per Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Share
will be paid on or about August 15, 2008, to holders of record of Series D
Preferred Shares at the close of business on August 1, 2008. ).

I am going to watch the FFO for both BDN and HRP to see if the problem with FR
is company specific. I suspect it is industry wide. HRP ows a lot of property
in Hawaii where rents can actually be raised. This is a pretty good option in
this environment,

EKS

Peeled off 40% of my NYB bank shares for a small gain. 3% of the portfolio is
still in this stock as this company has little or no exposure to non-performing
loans. My concern is that any future growth may be small to zero if the economy
moves into a long sustained recession. I plan to peel off additional shares if
the stock move higher as the "good" regional banks rally.

EKS. Yep, just getting ready to post to you regarding FR.
--------------------------------------

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=fr

All my paper profits are now losses on this one. Drat.
------------------
I see dividend at $2.88/sh.

Management expects 2008 FFO at $3.45-$3.75. (Quite a haircut from previous
$4.70-$5.00.)

For 2009 expectation for FFO is $3.25-$3.75.

I have no estimate for AFFO. Dividend seems like it maybe could be safe through
2009, if company FFO estimates are proven correct.

For now my bet is to hold on.

GNW - I bought some GENWORTH FINL INC SR NT 5.23100% 05/16/2009 bonds with
about 43% yield to maturity. Well, they mature in May 2009, one is getting only
8 months of such yield, but this is possibly still a good deal if they don't go
BK. Even then, bonds may not lose all value.
