I saw lots of profit-taking across the board; I was equally guilty as I sold or

2006.

If the selling continues today, that will be more convincing. JMHO.

OTOH, these dips usually prove to be buying opps in quality value stocks. And

Madharry, I have only limited experience with combined ratios for medmal

to be put through.

I've had ACAP since '03, and its combined ratio was 156% on 10/03 and 106% a
year later. The company says this improvement is due to rate increases (prime
reason, I am guessing), exiting a market, stricter underwriting standards, etc.
So I am hoping improvements can be got as well by NCRI management for their
company.

Social Security - Hasta la vista, baby:

(sorry for the long post, but this memo indicates the beginning of the end of
SS as we know it):
Memo on Social Security
January 5, 2005 7:24 p.m.

This is the full text of the memo from Peter Wehner, President Bush's director
of strategic initiatives, on the White House's plans for Social Security
reform:

From: Wehner, Peter H.

Subject: Some Thoughts on Social Security

I wanted to provide to you our latest thinking (not for attribution) on Social
Security reform.

I don't need to tell you that this will be one of the most important
conservative undertakings of modern times. If we succeed in reforming Social
Security, it will rank as one of the most significant conservative governing
achievements ever. The scope and scale of this endeavor are hard to
overestimate.

Let me tell you first what our plans are in terms of sequencing and political
strategy. We will focus on Social Security immediately in this new year. Our
strategy will probably include speeches early this month to establish an
important premise: the current system is heading for an iceberg. The notion
that younger workers will receive anything like the benefits they have been
promised is fiction, unless significant reforms are undertaken. We need to
establish in the public mind a key fiscal fact: right now we are on an
unsustainable course. That reality needs to be seared into the public
consciousness; it is the pre-condition to authentic reform.

Given that, our aim is to introduce market reforms in Social Security and make
the system permanently solvent and sustainable.

We intend to pursue the first goal by using our will and energy toward the
creation of Personal Retirement Accounts. As you know, our advocacy for
personal accounts is tied to our commitment to an Ownership Society -- one in
which more people will own their health care plans and have the confidence of
owning a piece of their retirement. Our goal is to provide a path to greater
opportunity, more freedom, and more control for individuals over their own
lives. That is what the personal account debate is fundamentally about -- and
it is clearly the crucial new conservative idea in the history of the Social
Security debate.

Second, we're going to take a very close look at changing the way benefits are
calculated. As you probably know, under current law benefits are calculated by
a "wage index" -- but because wages grow faster than inflation, so do Social
Security benefits. If we don't address this aspect of the current system, we'll
face serious economic risks.

It's worth noting that wage indexation was not part of the original design of
Social Security. The current method of wage indexation was created in 1977,
under (you guessed it) the Carter Administration. Wage indexation makes it
impossible to "grow our way" out of the Social Security problem. If the economy
grows faster and wages rise, this produces more tax revenue. But the faster
wage growth also means that we owe more in Social Security benefits. This has
produced a never-ending cycle of higher tax burdens, even during periods of
robust economic growth. It is the classic case of the dog chasing his tail
around the tree; he can run faster and faster, and never make any progress.

You may know that there is a small number of conservatives who prefer to push
only for investment accounts and make no effort to adjust benefits -- therefore
making no effort to address this fundamental structural problem. In my
judgment, that's a bad idea. We simply cannot solve the Social Security problem
with Personal Retirement Accounts alone. If the goal is permanent solvency and
sustainability -- as we believe it should be --then Personal Retirements
Accounts, for all their virtues, are insufficient to that task. And playing
"kick the can" is simply not the credo of this President. He wants to do what
needs to be done for genuine repair of Social Security.

If we duck our duty, it can have serious short-term economic consequences.
Here's why. If we borrow $1-2 trillion to cover transition costs for personal
savings accounts and make no changes to wage indexing, we will have borrowed
trillions and will still confront more than $10 trillion in unfunded
liabilities. This could easily cause an economic chain-reaction: the markets go
south, interest rates go up, and the economy stalls out. To ignore the
structural fiscal issues -- to wholly ignore the matter of the current system's
benefit formula -- would be irresponsible.

Here's a startling fact: under current law, an average retiree in 2050 would be
scheduled to receive close to 40 percent more (in real terms) in benefits than
an average retiree today -- and yet there are no mechanisms in place to produce
the revenue to pay out those benefits. No one on this planet can tell you why a
25-year-old person today is entitled to a 40 percent increase in Social
Security benefits (in real terms) compared to what a person retiring today
receives.

To meet those benefit levels, one option would be to raise the age at which
people receive benefits. If we followed the formula used when Social Security
was first created -- make the age at which you receive Social Security benefits
above the average age of mortality -- we'd be looking at raising the benefit
age to around 80. That ain't gonna happen.

Another way to meet those benefit levels is through the traditional
Democrat/liberal way: higher taxation. According to the latest report of the
Social Security Trustees, the current system's benefit formula would require
some $10 trillion in tax increases over the long term. We'd therefore need to
raise the payroll tax almost 20 percent simply to provide wage-indexed benefit
levels to those born this year.

This will all sound familiar. In the past, the way Congress usually addressed
the built-in funding problem was by raising payroll taxes (from 2 percent in
1937 to 12.4 percent today). In fact, Congress has raised Social Security taxes
more than 30 times -- but it has never addressed the underlying problem.
Avoiding the core issue by raising taxes is not the modus operandi of this
President.

The other key point, as you know, is that personal accounts, through the
miracle of compound interest, will provide workers with higher retirement
benefits than they are currently receiving from Social Security.

At the end of the day, we want to promote both an ownership society and advance
the idea of limited government. It seems to me our plan will do so; the plan of
some others won't.

Let me add one other important point: we consider our Social Security reform
not simply an economic challenge, but a moral goal and a moral good. We have a
responsibility to fulfill the promise of Social Security, not undermine it. And
we have a duty to ensure that we do not create an inter-generational conflict
-- which is precisely what will happen if the Social Security system is not
reformed. We need to retain strong ties between the generations, which is of
course a deeply conservative belief.

The debate about Social Security is going to be a monumental clash of ideas --
and it's important for the conservative movement that we win both the battle of
ideas and the legislation that will give those ideas life. The Democrat Party
leadership, the AARP, and many others will go after Social Security reform
hammer and tongs. See today's silly New York Times editorial (its only one for
the day) as one example. But Democrats and liberals are in a precarious
position; they are attempting to block reform to a system that almost every
serious-minded person concedes needs it. They are in a position of arguing
against modernizing a system created almost four generations ago. Increasingly
the Democrat Party is the party of obstruction and opposition. It is the Party
of the Past.

For the first time in six decades, the Social Security battle is one we can win
-- and in doing so, we can help transform the political and philosophical
landscape of the country. We have it within our grasp to move away from
dependency on government and toward giving greater power and responsibility to
individuals.

There are of course other important issues dealing with Social Security; for
now, though, I've covered quite enough ground. I wanted to let you know where
things stand. If you have any questions, or if we can send you anything to
clarify our plans and respond to critics, just let me know. The President
remains flexible on tactics -- and rock-solid on the principles. But there's
nothing new there.

In one of his last public acts of an extraordinary public life, the late
Democratic Senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, co-chaired the
President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security. In the introduction of
its report, Senator Moynihan (along with Richard Parsons, his co-chair) wrote,
"the time to include personal accounts in such action [reforming Social
Security] has, indeed, arrived. The details of such accounts are negotiable,
but their need is clear.... Carpe diem!"

And so we shall.

OT.

I can't remember which particular stock ideas were yours because I don't know
who mentioned which stocks first (ALVR, PCYC). I have had you peoplemarked for
at least a couple of years because I liked the way you analysed some situations
back then. I can't remember what the situation was, but it was good enough to
land you on my peoplemark list with only a half-dozen others. I ended up
reading most of your posts since then. There are a number of people on this
thread that I would peoplemark if I didn't have the whole thread subjectmarked.

Your style is a bit different than mine, as I look mostly at companies with
consistent revenue growth that I can get to know well. Really well. That often
limits me to local companies in industries I am at least somewhat familiar
with. It also means that I am not well diversified. My style has worked well
for me because I can avoid bad investments. (It doesn't help me avoid bad

Larry,
That smacks to me as being a prime piece of disinformation. There are any
number of points he states as fact that are, IMO. blatantly false.

Example:

"If the economy grows faster and wages rise, this produces more tax revenue.
But the faster wage growth also means that we owe more in Social Security
benefits. This has produced a never-ending cycle of higher tax burdens, even
during periods of robust economic growth. It is the classic case of the dog
chasing his tail around the tree; he can run faster and faster, and never make
any progress."

I personally capped out my SS retirement benefits some years ago. That hasn't
stopped the Fed from taxing me each and every year. I continue to pay the max
in but my benefits are capped. This the the reverse of what he stated.

It will be an interesting political discussion regarding the future of social
security. In the end, it really comes back to the question of determining what
social security is supposed to be: a retirement income program or a welfare
program.

It is also very interesting to see the constant complaints about heavy tax
burdens while we continue to run large deficits (even excluding the Iraq and
terror war costs) and continue to exempt more income from taxation (i.e.,
higher 401k and Roth IRA limits and lower tax rates) while at the same time
expand social benefits (Medicare prescription drug coverage).

will likely add more AA if it drops below 30. Apparently late to the party, I
am underwater in Korean PKX. I'm holding on to recent purchase of MTLM. I have
a decent position (for me) in GTI, which has dropped again. I'll add more if
the stock declines near 8 on no adverse news.

I continue to hold all my biotech, big pharma, medical supply distributors, and
heath management companies that I had going into this year. I'm looking to add
to NVS if it drops a bit.

Brinks, I am impressed you really read my posts and have good memory.

Occasionally I got one or two five baggers and that boosted my overall return

So I guess one could say my approach still depends on luck a lot - if I got a
five or ten bagger in the 15 stock basket during any 3 year period.

re MUSA - sold my position at a small profit. I tried to decipher MUSA's
accounting and it's clear to me that most of the profits are not from operating
the business but rather from steel inventory appreciation. I came to this
conclusion after studying the balance sheet of RT, a competitor of MUSA.
Contrary to MUSA, which does FIFO accounting, RT's accounting is based on LIFO
(which reduces the impact of steel price changes on the income statement):

This is the critical phrase from RT's last 10Q:
 Replacement costs for the LIFO inventories exceeded LIFO values by
approximately $293 million and $61 million on September 30, 2004 and December
31, 2003, respectively. 

http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790528/000119312504191123/d10q.htm

I believe that the accounting differences are responsible for MUSA's higher
gross margins relatively to RT. If so, RT appears to be fundamentally cheaper
as it has a lower P/S ration. I also believe that the cash flow (which is more
important than the earnings statement) favors RT. In any case, RT appears
neglected and quite cheap relatively to MUSA, so I am contemplating buying RT.

I think both RT and MUSA earnings are very dependent on steel prices. Both
carry a little bit less than a quarter worth of revenue on their books. Both
had negative free cash flow during the last year, as the appreciated inventory
sucked up more and more cash. If steel prices ever go down, let's say by 20% in
a quarter, both companies are in for a world of hurt,but MUSA much more so than
RT. MUSA would show a loss of about 50M$ in this case, RT would be more
shielded since they still carry a substantial discount in the value of their
inventory.

I am down a few % myself but the year is young. For me it's mostly a function
of my exposure to international stuff. The dollar may bounce but I see a
continued move south as the year goes on. Regardless, lots of international
stuff is still cheap.

We'll see. The best lesson from the last two years is that patience often
equals profits, eventually. About a quarter of the stocks I sold last year went
up later, some substantially. Fortunately a larger % of the stocks I bought to
replace them also went up.

Any new thoughts on ANF?

More particularly, I am curious about your thoughts on the long term prospects
of ANF say over a 10 year horizon. Also, whether you have any views on
management's integrity.

ANF closed over $50.00 today. Now the price of the company, I believe, is
approaching conservative estimates of intrinsic value. (e.g. assume 10 to 12%
earnings growth over next 10 years and 5% thereafter in perpetuity discounted
at 10% to 15% would indicate an intrinsic value of $55 to $60 per share). I am
considering selling covered calls (leaps) to hedge against short term price
fluctuations. I anticipate ANF will hit a glitch sometime along the way (say
between now and January 2007) and I can buy back the calls. The price of the
company seems somewhat set at near perfection and further appreciation depends
mainly upon the company's growth strategy, new concept stores, Hollister and
Rhuel.

Valuation measures per Yahoo:

VALUATION MEASURES

Market Cap (intraday): 4.37B
Enterprise Value (7-Jan-05)&#179;: 3.92B
Trailing P/E (ttm, intraday): 23.57

Enterprise Value/Revenue (ttm)&#179;: 2.07
Enterprise Value/EBITDA (ttm)&#179;: 9.64

ANF continues trading at around 10 times free cash flow (I am assuming yahoo's
EV/EBITDA calculation is correct). There is now approximately $5.09 per share
in cash (also per yahoo).

Price to Sales Ratio concerns me as does P/B and PEG.

GTSI's been mentioned here many times in the past. I'm guessing a few folks

After the stock corrected, there also were buyers and posts here. For me, I'm
still holding shares bought 9/22/03 @ $10.08/sh and in August '04 at prices
between $8.31 and $9.35.

In addition to the numbers you mention, I also like the very favorable report
from Forbes a couple years back on the business acumen of Mr. Young (Chair. and

Well, it surely is a different animal over there! <GGGG> I can take it for a

I'd be interested in your take on MFIC.OB, they're a profitable nano whose
backlog of orders as of third quarter is record high.

Well, they might be profitable with accrual accounting, but they're cash flow
negative. I'd be more impressed with a surge in orders for an outfit already
making good money on the ones they have.

It's not a micro-cap, but UTMD has great cashflow. They have major problems
with the FDA, but I think that gets worked out somehow.

Also like ABI for being debt free, pays a dividend and is in the biotech space.

My current number one pick for increasing in price over the next few years
though is Lucent (LU). Still has some profitability to prove can be done other
than by pension adjustments, but I think they do it.

Paul, I believe TUT System offered share-for-share for COSN, and TUTS closed at
$4, COSN closed at $2.76.

COSN is burning cash fast, it showed up on my value screen but never reached my
GTC buy order price. It is burning cash faster than other stocks I have. Since
I never bought it - it may go up now on the buyout news Monday.

My other stocks took a beating last week. As they say undervalued stocks can
become even more undervalued. It is not easy to be a value investor. Ben Graham
closed his limited partnership in late 50s for good reasons. I believe in it in
the long run, but should stay cautious at all times.

actually TUTS offered 6M shares of its stock, which equates to a little over
24M at the current TUTS price

however, TUTS appears to have guided below consensus for Q4 revenues and was
down over 4% after hours, so that lowers the amount they are paying to about
23.5M

all that said, COSN looks like a death spiral on its own, with vanishing
revenues and increasing losses, so it's probably best off being bought out even
at this price

COSN: re: "it appears COSN lost 14M in the last reported quarter (ended 9/30),
so it is unlikely that they have anywhere near 28M in tangible assets left at
this point"

You are likely right. TUTS says its going to get net cash of $22.75 from the
deal.

One could guess ---guess wrongly though :>( ---
that as push came to shove, COSN might've at least better husbanded the cash
they had.

They did have more than $28M as recently as 3 1/2 months ago:

"REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Oct. 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- CoSine Communications,
Inc. (Nasdaq: COSN - News), a provider of managed, network-based IP and
Broadband Services Delivery Platforms, today announced revenue for the quarter
ended September 30, 2004 of $1.1 million and a net loss of $14.6 million, or
$1.47 per share, as compared to revenue of $4.0 million and a net loss of $ 8.2
million or $0.84 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2003. The
company ended the quarter with $33.6 million in cash and short-term investments
and no long-term debt."

What sloth or shenanigans kept them from just closing shop then I wonder? I
don't see anything that suggests that they had any reason to assume losses
wouldn't continue and that the company should not fold (with the 33.6M less
closing costs distributed to stockholders).

OT: Have sold off most of my SIRI. I just wonder how much business SIRI/XMSR

re WIRE - interesting pick. I figure that WIRE as a copper manufacturer is
similar to STEEL manufacturers and distributors like MUSA, RT or IIIN. What
bothers me about those stocks is that they have cashless earnings. Despite the
apparently high earnings, the free cash flows are absent or even negative. it
appears that the cash flow get's sucked into inventory as it rises in value due
to appreciation of raw material prices. now with WIRE, the inventory is down,
but receivables are up by a huge amount, i wonder why. Net effect is that they
are FCF negative and of course don't pay a dividend either.

As I said WIRE is interesting but one really needs to understand the balance

Bought a 1/2 position in OIIM - a small analog semiconductor company. Very
sound balance sheet and nice margins in the 60% range. Revenues are stalling
right now but the company has grown rapidly over the last years. EV/ revenue is
2.7 which is low for analog semi's. They are small, hence have high costs (R&D
and sales) which partly negates the high gross margins. However if they can
re-ignite growth earnings should grow explosively. So, while not cheap, the
company is unlikely to fall apart and has a considerable option value, in case
the new products pan out.

WIRE. This one pops up on my screens a bit. I've looked at it a few times
recently. Tempting. I like the insider buying and the fundamentals, but I do
not understand the profitability completely.

Some profitability increase is due to higher margins, they say, but some is
just an inventory write-up based on copper value increases (I think). I have no
idea how much of each. I wonder if they will take an inventory hit if/when
copper prices fall. It seems out of my league and more speculation than
investment. But I keep watching it. Earnings should come out later this month.
Maybe they will become more transparent.

The link at the bottom shows 15 month copper futures a lot lower than present
prices. I dunno what that means. The analysts have EPS for WIRE dropping to 80
cents next year. That's a 15 P/E at $12 per share today. Not a screaming "buy".

"Although everybody expects copper prices to fall this year, nobody wants to go
short because of the low stocks [inventory]," said Andrew Silver, base metals
trader at Natexis Metals. The price of copper has doubled over the past two
years.

sells at a discount to the net asset value as calculated by the company. They
just posted the figure for 12/31/04 on its website. Its a bit of a black box
investment because they dont provide a list of the assets in their portfolio
just provide selected information, However I really like this as a way of
investing in junior mining companies through competent people and buying into
it at a discount. They charge a fee primarily based on the extent to which
their return on equity exceeds 15% per annum. that seems pretty fair to me. If
i am buying into it a 25% discount and it returns 15% per annum that means a
return of 20% on my equity. I would be ecstatic to get that return over 20

Hi Paul - I have been researching more undervalued real estate issues and have
discovered many churches (all across the US) are sitting on property land
holdings that were acquired many years ago at prices way below current market
value.

I have not been able to identify a "pure" play to buy an REIT or publicly
traded company that holds these type of land assets (specifically churches,
schools, colleges or other religious organizations). There are "Church Bond"
offers but they are not liquid and are not diversified enough for this value
theme.

Can you think of any publicly traded organization that might have a component
of these types of land assets on their books?

I have noticed several of our local churches selling a portion of their real
estate for new home developments. They still keep their church with less
parking (or sometimes sell out and build a new church in another location).
These are private transactions and not available to the small investor.

I know that the Mormons are huge land owners so perhaps there is a publicly
traded holding company located in Utah (Salt Lake City area) that may have some
of these undervalued real estate assets on their books.

Any ideas?

Okay, here's my opinion on GMTN.

First though, I'm wrong a lot. Secondly, you don't post much, but when you do,
your picks DO move up. I wouldn't want to be against you, and you might be
right here yet again.
---------

I'll pass on GMTN. Just seems like we're overly
saturated with sports stores. GMTN is a recent IPO; I don't know if there's a
lock up period - insiders control 65% of the stock, according to Yahoo. OTOH, I
see where there's been persistent but small insider buying from $21 all the way
down to $12 (per Yahoo). That makes $9.43 current price, pretty attractive.

I don't know if the companies in the sector differentiate themselves by
products (exclusives, or maybe specializing in a certain aspect of sports) or
by customer service or convenience or price. I'm guessing there's not much
difference, so if I scan the competitors numbers...

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/co?s=GMTN

GMTN doesn't look (to me) like its numbers or outlook is any better or worse
than say, The Sports Authority. I don't see where GMTN stock will do better
than TSA stock going forward.

Briefing.com says, "The company expects comparable store sales for the current
fiscal year to be down 2-3% vs last year's increase of 11.5%. The company cited
the continuing impact of unseasonably warm weather into mid-December."

If I look at the quarter-to-quarter comparisions on inventory, I see big
increases...

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=GMTN

Could be that that is due to having to stock their new stores. OTOH, they
apparently have the wrong merchandise for the time, and they may have to take
markdowns. To me, it seems like inventory is a big component of book value
margin of safety, so I'm not sure book value here is that safe.

Back otoh, your analyses here have always seemed to be very good - and more
importantly -g-, right, so if you say this stock's a buy, people should check
closely for themselves. For me, I can't see it, and not only do I admit my
vision's not that good, I've been wrong many, many times.

Hi mikeslemmer - GMTN is an interesting value proposition but I have a problem
with a few items which appears that current management is not addressing.
First, you will notice that the company had to borrow almost $66 million in
FY04 to finance a charge to inventories as their current year's cash flow could
not carry their expansion. It's not clear if they had to write down some
current inventory and/or finance new inventory for their new stores. In either
case it was huge (around $70 million). This would be OK if receivables remained
constant but it exploded higher 6x's the previous year. This increase in
customer receivables could be due from their catalog division or as a result of
their aggressive "new store" expansion. However, management should have been
better able to manage this big expense hit. Although, GMTN has been and
continues to be aggressive in their new store expansion from 26 to 66 stores, I
am a little skeptical about management's experience specifically relating to
their IT department and the integration of real time inventory control systems.

Second, their catalog business is expensive to run and they should complement
this with a very aggressive Online Internet Web site. In fact, they could
easily put their catalog online at a very small marginal expense. They need to
develop a Web presence (just open a few less new stores) and integrate this
with an efficient shipping and warehouse operations (or just drop ship orders
to their customers). So far, I see none of this being developed.

One of my best stock picks was Land's End who impressed me with their catalogs
and Internet site. They had unique products (not cheap but excellent quality).
Their catalog sales division (which morphed into an excellent Internet On Line
site) was efficient, had very good customer service and a liberal return
policy. They were acquired by Sear's a few years ago and Sear's carries their
lines of products in their stores and has learned a lot about how to run an
efficient and customer friendly Internet shopping site.

My point in this is GMTN could be an excellent candidate for migrating their
catalog division to an On Line shopping site but it appears that management has
decided to take the traditional "new store" route. The chairman and largest
shareholder (holds 30% of the stock) may see things in the old traditional
format. That's fine, but it is a very competitive business (look at Sharper
Image) and you have to run a very efficient operation just to make industry
margins.

If GMTN could follow what REI has done (http://www.rei.com/) or at least show
investors going forward that their goal was to integrate their regional store
presence with some Internet marketing program and then focus their expansion to
other similar regional "affluent" markets (California, Montana etc.), I would
be more apt to invest. With the evolution of the Internet, GMTN could take many
of their high quality products, unique branded items and better target them to
these affluent buyers. The traditional mail order catalog is just too expensive
or not as an effective method when complemented with online ordering systems.

Many of these things can be easily fixed with money and good management. In
fact GMTN has many unique branded items which differentiate itself from other's
in the same business. I guess I would watch for (1) new IT and marketing
management announcements, (2) release of an online Internet catalog or (3) a
partnership with a major online distributor.

I will pass for now but at a low enough levels, you may see a specialized
retailer make an offer for this company but at a "value" price (no more that
BV).

GMTN's IPO was at a much higher price. Management bought significant amounts of
shares at that time at $16/share.

I agree that there's no firm reason to see GMTN's business as better positioned
than TSA or another such company. The key drivers here are the low (price /
tangible book ratio) of about 0.8 and the low (price / sales) ratio of about
0.2.

The company is growing quickly, which explains some of the inventory build.
Also, the business is extremely cyclical, with most of the sales and profits in
Q3 and Q4. This explains the remainder of the inventory build. Q1's results
will be terrible, as they were last year due to this cyclicality.

You're right to say that the inventory is a key driver of the book value. There
is some risk here. A mitigating factor is the fact that, at $641M this year,
revenue was nearly twice the Q3 inventory amount of $329M. While two turns of
peak inventory per year is not all that impressive, it does mean that the
company is doing a decent job in its cash cycle. It also renders less likely
the prospect that the company has lots of old inventory lying around that will
need to be discounted.

I wouldn't characterize GMTN as a clear buy. Not much is these days. In
particular, I'm concerned about the company's floating-rate debt in a rising
rate environment, its debt-financed expansion and the fact that its products
are discretionary expenditures.

The buy case on the stock revolves around reversion to the mean. If you believe
management isn't completely lying/wrong about 2004 being hurt by unseasonable
weather, the company could generate net margins in the 3% range (a typical
number in this industry), which at current revenue levels would be about $19M
or $1.25 per diluted share, for a P/E of 7.5 at a stock price of $9.40. The
case gets even better if you believe the CEO knows how to grow a retailer from
his experience at Home Depot. There are other hidden pluses too, like Net
Operating Loss Carryforwards in the $40M range which are currently written down
to zero but don't actually expire until 2021.

Briefly, on the issue of catalogs and the internet, raised by another poster,
GMTN's catalog business shut down in 1996. The company's store strategy seems
smart to me - like Home Depot they focus on functionality rather than cute
displays. Also, the company sells a lot of guns, and I believe you have to have
a physical presence for that (can you buy a rifle from a catalog?)

I'd be very interested if anyone on this board actually lives near a GMTN store
(in the midwest region, some in the east coast too). Some firsthand research
might be helpful.

Paul, I appreciate your comments about my past posts. If you'd like to discuss
ideas off the board (via email and/or phone), I'd be happy to. Frequently I
limit my posts because I want to avoid competition for purchasing small
undervalued stocks.

re BPT Timbabear, i would be interested to hear why you bought into BPT. I
think BPT is one of the most overvalued royalty plays out there. i was short
this stock as hedge against my energy longs but closed out the position
fortunately. Still i believe the fair value of BPT is at most 30$, based on my
NPV model. There is a pretty good discussion in the yahoo BPT board about by
the likes of valueprofessors and diogenes1234, both are shorts. the issues with
BPT is that production is falling by about 8%/yearly and the trust agreement
provides for increased compensation for the operator (BP). The combination of
both makes buying BPT a very bad bet on oil prices at the current valuation. I
am tempted to get short again in BPT.

...i would be interested to hear why you bought into BPT

Primarily for the yield....12%. I like a certain (about 5%) baseline level of
dividend/interest/royalty income in my portfolio and this helps that goal.

...the issues with BPT is that production is falling by about 8%/yearly and the
trust agreement provides for increased compensation for the operator (BP).

Production out of their 1100ish producing wells is in excess of 300,000BPD, the
royalty is paid based on the first 90,000BPD. I'm not too concerned about
dropping production just yet. If an when production declines below 200,000BPD,
I'll likely have to consider how soon it will become an issue. Until then, I'm
not concerned.

As far as increased compensation to the operator, why wouldn't it have clauses
for automatic increases? For me, the way to measure this "opportunity" is by
the return on the dollar spent to acquire it. At today's prices, that's about
12%, I'm OK with that.

The combination of both makes buying BPT a very bad bet on oil prices at the
current valuation

Well, I'm in the camp that believes peak oil production for the world has
already passed. I'm in the camp that believes oil demand will continue to rise
even in the face of a world economic slowdown. I'm also in the camp that
believes the US dollar still has quite a ways to drop. The combination of those
beliefs has an offshoot that leads me to believe that oil prices probably won't
go below $40/BBL on any sustained basis. Since this royalty is paid based on
the price of a barrel of oil, I feel it an adequate buy for the reasons I'm
using it for.

...I am tempted to get short again in BPT.

Well, that's what makes a market, no? But shorting based on the belief that
something is overpriced without insisting on a margin of safety sounds
dangerous to one's wealth. What is that saying? Oh yeah! "Markets can stay
irrational longer than one can stay solvent."

I wish you well.

Cleveland-Cliffs says Portman bid is "full" price
Fri Jan 14, 2005 02:36 PM ET
By Belinda Goldsmith

NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (CLF.N: Quote, Profile,
Research) said on Friday its $465 million bid for Australian miner Portman Ltd.
(PMM.AX: Quote, Profile, Research) was a "full" price, but it refused to say if
this meant it would not sweeten the bid if a rival suitor emerged.

Cleveland-Cliffs, the largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America,
this week faced a barrage of complaints from its largest shareholders, who were
not consulted over its plan to buy Portman, Australia's third-largest iron ore
miner.

The shareholders prefer that the funds be used for a share buyback instead.

Chief Executive John Brinzo reassured shareholders on a conference call that if
the deal failed, the company would reinstate its suspended share repurchase
plan. However, the company would not clarify whether this meant it would not
raise its offer.

"Based on the information we have, we believe this is a full and fair price for
the shares and Portman sees it that way as well," company spokesman Dana Byrne
told Reuters.

"We would be surprised if there were any other parties willing to bid more."

Cleveland-Cliffs' offer of A$3.40 a share, unanimously backed by Portman's
board, drove Portman's stock up to close at A$3.48 on Friday, helped partly by
the slim possibility that a higher bid might emerge.

Opponents of the deal include Tontine Management LLC, the largest shareholder
with a stake of about 10 percent, and the second largest shareholder, Third
Point Management Co.

During a conference call this week, Tontine's managing principal, Jeffery
Gendell, a New York investor with a reputation for buying undervalued stock
that become takeover targets, berated the company for its decision.

"If your bid fails, you should spend more time talking to your big
shareholders," he said.

Brinzo said the attraction of buying Portman was to give Cleveland-Cliffs entry
to Southeast Asia's fast-growing steel-making markets, particularly China. The
Cleveland, Ohio-based company now supplies pellets to integrated steel
companies in the United States and Canada.

Byrne said Cleveland-Cliffs was not in any other talks at present to increase
its presence in Asia.

"We are just focused on getting this transaction completed," he said.

Timbabear -re BPT The "yield" is really a return of capital for the most part.
According to the last 10k the trust is supposed to fall below the 90,000k
barrel number in 2013. This would also be the year that an investor at current
stock prices would get is's capital returned (8 year x 12% yield) assuming that
the trust payment stay the same. This would mean that the oil prices have to
rise about 5% annually going forward. Depending on the rate you discount future
cash flows. the future brea even point would be 2015 or 2016, where the output
should be well below 90,000K barrels/year.

looking at the valuation from another perspective the trust economic interest
per 2003 10k is 77M BOE with 21.4 M shares that is about 3.5 barrels/ trust
unit. The royalty income at current oil prices is about 25$/barrel. So best
case scenario is that you would receive 75$ (indiscounted). What are future
cash flows of 75$ worth over many years? Certainly less than 50$. While i agree
that this is not a straightforward short I think BPT is very richly valued. Any
scenario other than increasing oil prices will result in an economic loss for
the holder of BPT trust units at current prices. the same scenario would result
is nice gains for an investor in E&P where you can buy a barrel of oil for less
than 10$, thus my idea to use a short position in BPT as an oil price hedge for
long position in E&P's.

Bought a starter position ISIL. Investment rationale similar to OIIM. High
gross margins, good cash flow, strong balance sheet interesting products but
yet a lack of growth. If growth can be reignited the earnings leverage should
be substantial and stock prices much higher. Downside on the other hand is
fairly limited unless things are really falling apart.

Thoughtful argument well presented. Will review my thinking in light of the
approach you take.

Even if your approach proves to be entirely correct, I suspect I can get the
12% and still be able to sell the shares at or above my purchase price, as long
as I leave a decent amount of time before production is projected to fall below
90,000BPD. With as short-sighted as our market seems to be, I would guess I
could get another year at least.

I agree with your opinion of E&P companies which is why I own XEC.

Thanks again for the cogent presentation and I'll mull it over.

Spek,

I believe there was a recent Barron's article (couple weeks back) talking about
how overvalued the American Energy Trusts are relative to oil companies. Seems
like your analysis is in agreement with this one.

I have not done the evaluation myself, but I would not be surprised --- retail
investors love to get high yield, even if it is just a return of their own
money.

EXTRAORDINARY COALBED METHANE OPPORTUNITY-OVER 1 TRILLION CUBIC FEET POTENTIAL

Ride the coattails of 50 accredited investors purchasing $13 million of stock
on January 13, 2005 and one of the largest multinational resource companies in
the world that signed a letter of intent in December 2004 to JV and who will
commit an additional $ 20 million for development. Company has not been on
anyone's radar screen. There are TEN KEY reasons listed below of why to
consider this Company.

The Company is BPI Industries (TSX-V: BPR U.S. symbol: BPITF).

BPI is an independent natural gas exploration and development company. The
Company's focus is on developing and expanding its Coalbed Methane assets in
the Illinois Basin. The Company represents a unique opportunity to invest in
the development, production and growth of Coalbed Methane in the Illinois
Basin.

BPI is developing one of the largest coalbed methane portfolios in the
potentially rich Illinois Basin, with a total of 423,000 acres of coalbed
methane rights ("CBM acreage") divided into five major properties. The company
has the first producing project in the basin, generating 1.2 MCF per day from
29 operating wells. Wells tapping other seams should be online shortly, while
2005 will see drilling activity of 4 to 8 wells per month (close to 100 total).
Pipeline crosses all projects, enabling cheaper transport and richer sales
margins. High-profile venture partners are coming onboard. Management believes
its properties contain more than 1 TRILLION CUBIC FEET of recoverable gas.
Immediate goals include acquiring additional CBM acreage (800,000 CBM acreage
under negotiation now) and more precisely delineating the existing resource.

Over the last couple years, the Company has grown its CBM acreage almost
ten-fold from 43,000 acres to over 423,000 acres today making this one of the
largest CBM projects in the U.S. The Gas Research Institute estimates that the
Illinois Basin contains gross reserves of approximately 21 trillion cubic feet
("TCF") of natural gas. http://www.bpi-industries.com/coalbed-methane-3.php

*****WHY BPI Industries and WHY NOW?

1) Here is the KEY:
The Company believes the potential exists for recoverable reserves exceeding 1
TCF of natural gas from its existing CBM acreage. Why is this key? I estimate
that a TCF could equate to a market cap value of anywhere from approximately $
750 million to $ 1 billion depending on several factors including the price of
natural gas. The company's current market cap is approximately $ 73 million. In
addition, the Company is in negotiations to acquire an additional 800,000 of
CBM acreage, which will only add to the above potential TCF (KEY). Does the
Company have a competitive advantage to accomplish the acquisition of
additional acreage? Read on.

2) Another KEY:
The Company can acquire additional CBM acreage for as low as $ 1 to $ 2 per
acre (some parts are higher) in the Illinois Basin versus for example CBM
acreage in the Powder River Basin that costs $ 100+ per acre. This is a
substantial competitive advantage operating in the Illinois Basin.

In addition, since the Company is the largest CBM player in the Illinois Basin
they have a competitive advantage (being the only producer in the Basin) with
Illinois landowners who many times negotiate and receive up to 20% in royalty
fees upon production. In addition, differentiating the Company within the
Illinois Basin is the fact that it is currently is the only company
commercially producing in-seam gas (for landowners this is very important).

3) Another KEY:
There are TWO major gas pipelines that cross ALL of the Company's CBM acres,
providing a ready access to markets for future gas production. This is yet
another competitive advantage since the Company is able to get its gas
production to market in a very cost-effective manner.

4) Another KEY:
The location of the Company's CBM acreage puts it in close proximity to the
second highest priced gas market in the US. Therefore the Company's gas
marketing contracts net the Company a premium for its gas sales. I've heard as
high as 12% higher.

5) Another KEY January 13, 2005:
The Company is not being recommended by any major newsletter. Thus the Company
has been under the radar screen. However, because of the January 13, 2005
successful equity offering for $ 13 million among only 50 investors (average
investment $ 260,000 per investor!!) this could change. This is extremely
impressive since these are most likely sophisticated investors who probably did
extensive due diligence. Thus investors can now ride the coattails of such
investors with an investment in the Company. In addition, the largest oil and
gas investment bankers in Texas, Sanders Morris and Harris assisted the Company
in this transaction. Imagine the due diligence this company did on BPI. By the
way, the equity offering at $ 1.25 U.S. per share with half warrant at $ 1.50
U.S. per share was oversubscribed beyond the originally contemplated US$10
million. http://www.bpi-industries.com/news-view.php?id=144 This potential
change was indicated in December 2004 by James G. Azlein, President "BPI's
growth story is still largely unknown within the investment community. We
believe that as we now start to raise awareness of the results and potential
within BPI, we will be able to unlock the exceptional value in the Company."

6) Another KEY December 2004:
"There's no question. BPI is the largest CBM player in the Illinois Basin. The
next 12 months will see the execution of a very aggressive development and
drilling schedule. BPI has just today signed a Letter of Intent to enter into a
Joint Venture with one of the largest multinational resource companies in the
world." James G. Azlein, President of BPI Industries Inc., December 2004 One of
the largest multinational resource companies in the world !!!!! This adds
tremendous creditability to the Company and its CBM acreage.
http://www.wallstreetreporter.com/magazine/05/OilandGas/164_Oil&Gas_online.pdf

Once again investors can ride the coattails of one of the largest multinational
resource companies in the world.
http://www.bpi-industries.com/news-view.php?id=139

In addition it was stated in the press release, "The International Partner has
experience and expertise in coalbed methane development and is currently
utilizing and developing innovative drilling techniques that BPI believes are
at the forefront of the CBM industry. The letter of intent outlines the basic
structure for a 50/50 Joint Venture in all of BPI's Illinois Basin Projects
except for the Delta Project and the Illinois Mine Gas LLC projects. The
structure calls for a staged investment and development program that will be
funded 100% by the International Partner with a total investment of
US$20,000,000 over a maximum period of 24 months. From the date of the letter
of intent through February 28, 2005 the parties have agreed to negotiate in
good faith, complete due diligence, and seek to finalize and sign definitive
joint venture agreements before January 31, 2005." Note that January 31, 2005
is almost here!

IMO the January 13, 2005 successful equity placement enhances the probability
of this transaction being finalized. This was indicated in the January 13, 2005
press release:

"In addition to the an aggressive drilling schedule for the upcoming year,
management is excited and optimistic about successfully completing its current
discussions with its potential joint venture partner as well as opportunities
to further expand its footprint in the basin." IMO the Company's greatest
strength is the terms of the current financing of possibly $ 33 million ($ 13
million equity plus $ 20 million from one of the largest multinational resource
companies in the world), Just brilliant! A couple of other CBM public companies
have recently done "toxic" debt financings. Just crazy!

7) Another KEY:
The Company uses Halliburton Energy (the world's largest oil & gas services
company) and Sproule Associates as part of their management team. There are no
better firms in this country. In addition, they hired a former Halliburton
Energy employee with extensive Illinois basin expertise. See BPI Expands and
Strengthens Its Technical Team
http://www.bpi-industries.com/news-view.php?id=137 in addition the Company has
an excellent advisory board with extensive CBM expertise.

8) Another Key the timing is right:
As stated in the January 13, 2005 press release it is an opportune time since
the Company, with the recent positive events, is on the verge of a
transformation: "The successful completion of this financing marks the
beginning of BPI's transformation into a fully fledged exploration and
production company. We are pleased with the receptivity of investors to our
development strategy for BPI's Illinois Basin CBM assets. The capital raised
will allow us to aggressively pursue the drilling opportunities on our current
projects which have the potential to build meaningful values for our
shareholders," said James Azlein, President and CEO

9) Another KEY:
"We expect to initiate production from 15 in-seam wells at the Delta Project
and 6 mine gas wells at the Illinois Mine Gas Project any time now. The Company
is anticipating both an aggressive testing program and drilling schedule of 4
to 8 wells per month in 2005. Close to 100 wells in 2005. The Jericho Project,
the first producing project in the Illinois Basin, currently has a total of 34
wells, 29 of which are in production. Current production is approximately
1.2MMCF per day from one of three potentially productive coal seams, which
underlie this project. Permeability from Jericho data seems to indicate
commercial viability for the other projects also. The economics on the Jericho
Project look very favorable. The website has a model using 40 mcf/d per well
and a $4/mcf realized gas price, the payback per well of drilling, completion
and infrastructure costs is 1.55 years. This is excellent and since natural gas
is north of $ 6.20 the payback is probably sooner.

10) Final KEY:
IMO the Company has a very conservative balance sheet (no long term debt) and
has been extremely prudent in its overhead incurred to date. The quarterly
financial disclosures are on par with a fully reporting U.S. company. Perhaps
better. They are just excellent. They track project expenditures and disclose
salaries paid to officers. I have heard that they wish to seek a U.S. listing,
either NASDAQ or AMEX. IMO the financials will enhance their chances. See

*****Why coalbed methane? Why now? U.S. Natural Gas Crisis

The investment thesis for investing in a coalbed methane company such as BPI:

"North American natural gas markets face a supply crunch that can be met in the
near term only by increasing production from unconventional deposits.
Production of natural gas from conventional sources in Western Canada and the
lower 48 states has peaked, and faces a gradual decline, even as the growth in
demand continues. AS A RESULT, NORTH AMERICAN COMPANIES WILL NEED TO EXPLOIT
UNCONVENTIONAL SOURCES, SUCH AS COALBED METHANE." Gwyn Morgan, CEO EnCana
Corporation

"First the energy sector in general and the natural gas sector in particular
are likely to remain two of the strongest investment themes for the foreseeable
future. Natural gas prices have been very strong and look to be trending
higher." James G. Azlein, President of BPI Industries Inc

Matt Simmons' investment bank, Simmons and Company International, is considered
the most reputable and reliable energy investment bank in the world.

When asked if there is a solution to the impending natural gas crisis, Simmons
responded:

"I don't think there is one. The solution is to pray. Under the best of
circumstances, if all prayers are answered there will be no crisis for maybe
two years. After that it's a certainty."

Go listen to this interview or read the excellent book---he believes building
multi-billion LGN terminals is absurd because of long term limited supply of
world NG and expense involved in transporting and storing. I guess they also
make great terrorist targets and no one wants them in their backyard.

High Noon for Natural Gas: The New Energy Crisis
Darley, Julian

click on real player
http://www.financialsense.com/Experts/2004/Darley.html

Other Reasons:

1) There is no OPEC to solve the North America natural gas supply problem 2)
Problem will last for Years since LNG supplies only a tiny portion of US supply
and there is no way to ramp up for years. 3) Natural Gas demand by new power
plants coming online is skyrocketing-this was a result of a 1998 government
report that forecasted ample supply of natural gas for years to come 4) all the
reasons listed in the best interview and analysis I've ever seen: An Interview
with Andrew Weissman by Bill Powers, Editor Canadian Energy Viewpoint January
4, 2004

http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/powers/2004/0104.html

2) The government's national natural gas policy is to hope for warm winter
weather and cool summers. This is doomed !

3) Warren Buffett moved on the area in 2001 and now controls approximately 8%
of the US natural gas pipelines

Bottom line is there is no solution to solve the North America natural gas
supply problem. This is the reason to focus on this area for investment.

re BPT :Timbabear - to be fair, the 10k data is a little stale since it is
based on an oil price of 32$ or thereabout. The tailend of the production can
be capped by the adjusted chargeable costs which are subtracted from the oil
revenue. If higher prices continue to exist, the reserve number could be
adjusted upwards, however on the other hand the 5-6M barrel lifted in 2004 will
be subtracted from the reserves as well. This makes the valuation of BPT more
difficult. Yet, so far i have seen analysis using various methods that suggest
that most energy trust are overvalued, at least compared to E&P stocks. Most
investors in these funds appear to be retail "yield chasers" that either live
by the bigger fool theory (that they can magically bail out without incurring
losses once the yield start to drop) and that plainly refuse the fact that
these funds are not bonds as there will be no principle returned after once the
reserves are exploited. I have yet to see a detailed analysis that suggest that
a return on investment can be achieved under reasonable assumptions.

I've owned IGT since 1990, the best buy and hold (with modest sells) I've ever
had. It's gotten walloped since its highs, especially today. Strong cash flow
generator, has increased the div. twice recently, a lot of analysts call for
another one in the near future. The Street hated the forward guidance today. I
still like this financially strong category killer, especially at these prices.

LKO, i never endorsed buying EBAY or QCOM for their respective valuations nor
do I hold a position in either one. I readily admit that ISIL and OIIM are not
straightforward value plays. The reason i like those stocks is because both of
them are in the most attractive market segment,namely analog, which has the
highest gross margins. While recent results and in particular growth for both
of them have been poor, they are solidly profitable and generate sold free cash
flow (about 5% of EV). both of them investor in excess of 20% of revenues in
R&D, which hopefully will lead to attractive new products and renewed growth.
If this happens there is substantial upside, as is evident by valuation of both
top dog analog semis, MXIM and LLTC which are trading at 8x and 10x revenues.
you can do the math what it would mean for ISIL and OIIM if they were similar
valued (which i admit is a stretch)

Hi Spekulatius - I like the E-Bay model and their margins are quite high but
the value play is just not there. Maybe at $40 I will invest. I am a bit
disappointed in E-Bay as they raised their "final value" fee from 3.5% to 8%
effective February 2005. This will drive a lot of the active sellers to other
auction sites. I am looking at Overstock.com's auction site. It currently does
not have the same activity as E-Bay and their overall auction web site is not
as developed as E-Bay but with a bit of IT development and $'s, they just may
be able to capture a huge segment of this market. Their final value fees are
only 2.5%. When you are an active seller, this mean large dollar savings.

What's your take on Overstock.com
(http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=2y&s=OSTK&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=ebay).

My under valued semiconductor play is LSI. They are trading close to book (but
still have quite of bit of goodwill write downs). Two of their product
divisions are doing quite well; storage and VOIP ASIC chips. This is one value
play that IMO has a good risk/reward.

I also have an investment in BRCD (over three years). They have over $3.00 cash
and excellent free flow cash flow. My average cost is around $5.00 but I am
waiting for BRCD to become a teenager. I think fair value is around
$12.00-$14.00 if they can participate in the SAN storage growth.

Rather than investing in QCOLM, I been a buyer of NOKIA at prices around
$12-$13. It was downgraded today which provides an excellent entry point for
new buyers at current levels. They pay an annual dividend in April (almost 3%)
and NOK is a market leader with over 30% of the market. Management has shown
that they can bring out new products in an ever changing market. Also, it's a
foreign currency play if you think the dollar continues to be weak against the
Euro. This is the "value" play stock in this segment as they pay a dividend and
have quite a bit of cash on their balance sheet.

Finally, I like your call on Agiliant. It's not really a value play but for the
many years that I have followed the company any price in this range (even below
$20) is a buy IMO. Agilant has many new emerging technologies in both the Nano
tech and Bio Tech fields that are very interesting.

I am looking to sell the August $20 A PUT for $1.40. My earlier buys in 2003
allowed me to establish a position below $20. I can recall this stock was
trading well above $40 when their semi conductor business was doing well. Their
earnings do jump around so PE is not a very good indicator of potential value.
Book value is around $7 and they have very little debt. It's all in their new
products and emerging technologies. They have proven that they have the "brain"
power to develop new leading technologies and bring them to market. Five years
out, I believe we see a double with the stock trading around $45.
