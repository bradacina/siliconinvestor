Mike (on SYMC):
I PM'd you on this one because it doesn't really fit the criteria for this
thread.
Symantec is what we're talking about. No net-net here for sure, but it appears
that Mike and I concur that one is acquiring GARP (growth at a reasonable
price). It's a well managed company with a good looking balance sheet IMHO. An
excellent product suite, as well. The hysteria caused by the downgrades today
seems way overdone.

Chilly,

Welcome to the thread. I didn't buy EBSC for its growth. It may grow 10%, but
not consistently, and not using its capital efficiently. In fact, investors
have reacted negatively any time the company does something that indicates it
will continue as a going concern, much less grow.

There were investors who bought a big chunk. The company is clearly
undervalued, but it is not a good company in terms of management or use of
assets. As you know, there has been some theorizing that there will be
shareholder maneuver to get the company to create more value for its
shareholders. A Barron's article helped that out.

The fact that it was a net net helped give this argument some bite here on the
Value Investing thread. So I and others here bought. I brought up the issue of
the huge operating lease liability. How it made it not a net net - possibly a
problem for all net net retailers. There was some debate about this. To me,
after some thought, I figured that this issue destroyed my reason for owning
the stock. Others argued that EBSC's operating leases might be considered
assets, for all we know, and hence should be held as a wash.

Of course, I still find that hard to swallow, so I say, well maybe I really
should ignore the operating lease liability, but at any rate I thought "this is
a growing, cash-generating company trading at around net net value." So I held
onto it.

To me, it was a poor decision. I confused the "net net with a catalyst"
strategy with a "cash flow/growth" strategy and ended up violating a rule I try
to remember: to get out when the reason I bought becomes or is realized to be
no longer valid.

Today, I switched my EBSC out at a small loss - even though I agree it does
appear very undervalued. Used the very same cash to buy ANF at 11 1/8 - the
same price Jim got, it turns out. I might have continued to hold, but I really
wanted to buy ANF after it fell today, and one of my retail/apparel stocks had
to go. LIZ ain't going anywhere. Same with Ross Stores. I'd rather have the
better business.

Yeah, but I think the market is right in that you have to look at manufactured
housing separate from the site-built home industry (stock prices of the two
groups don't fluctuate together). Clayton's average home price is about $42,000
- they are really competing, and very competitive with, rental prices for
apartments. It is the low-rent part of the housing industry. The MH industry's
loans have been considered sub-prime since last year, and financing has
tightened up drastically. Demand has already taken a significant hit since
early 99. Of course, there is room for more hits. But then you see that 44% of
Clayton's income is recurring, and that its business of scrubbing loan
portfolios for resale makes up over half of operating income, and at least in
my eyes, they are appropriately positioned to weather any further hits to
demand. In any case, the supply adversity and further potential demand
adversity is already factored into the price. The conference call is published
on their web site and is a must-hear for potential investors.

With CNF, it is a company that never really took off stock-wise throughout this
economic boom. IMO it came from the top.

Good investing,
Mike

A couple companies I think are worth a look. HCM is a REIT with an annual yield
of about 10% at current levels of around $4, and book value is $8.59 which
doesn't include any unusual accounting tricks. Assets are basically cash and
investment instruments which are marked to market each quarter. They seem to be
recovering from some investments that went against them back in October 1998
and took some a one time charge in the 3rd quarter last year to account for it.
The fourth quarter came in at .10 for both earnings and dividends and the
forward looking projections in the last CC pretty much gave the .10 as a
minimum base to grow from. TCW Group recently took a 9% position in the stock.
Chartwise the stock is just creeping up from a double bottom in the low 3's.
Volume tends to be light which would rule it out as a day trading stock but
there's usually enough inventory available to pick up a few shares for
investment purposes. There is currently one analysts covering the stock with a
strong buy rating but no estimates are available at present.

Recent PR:

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/000417/ny_hanover_1.html

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/000420/ny_hanover_1.html

Another stock I think is worth a look is FMO. The $27 book value is mostly
goodwill related to recent acquisitions but the price to earnings ratio is just
plain obscene. The stock is trading around $14 and earnings for this quarter
just came in on target at .86. Corporate raider Carl Ichan recently took a 5%
position in the stock. Debt is on the high side and they are taking some
restructuring charges to consolidate recent acquisitions. There is some
asbestos liability related to brake manufacturing in the past but they have
approximately $500 million in insurance coverage on the liability and an
additional $800 million in reserves to cover claims. Some of their brand names
include Champion spark plugs, Fel Pro gaskets, Borg, Speed Pro, etc. Publicly
held since 1940 it's worth adding to the 'old economy' list of companies that
actually have earnings.

SPRI in one I like to trade when it's cheap. It's currently trading below cash
value, but I've never been able to make up my mind if it's really a value
stock. Their planned merger with LEAP (which I don't consider to be a value
play) might produce some interesting synergies. LEAP has the e-commerce side
and SPRI has the IT support. The combination should give a combined book value
of about $3.50 per share with about $2.50 of that in cash. Earnings have been a
bit on the shaky side but the loses have been small enough not to represent a
significant cash burn. The value is there at current levels but it would
probably be more of a turnaround play than a pure value play as the main risk
would come from a failure to return to profitability. SPRI has most of the cash
and book value but the stock swap will be 1.085 LEAP for 1 SPRI, with the
merged company trading under the LEAP symbol. LEAP is without analyst coverage
but SPRI's coverage should extend to LEAP after the merger. It's probably too
early to call it an investment grade company of the Warren Buffet variety, but
it does tend to make some interesting moves from the highs and lows for shorter
term trades.

GATX (GMT) Corp just sold most of its stake in its Logistics division. This is
another interesting piece in their valuation tale. The stock jumped on the
news, which tells me that someone out there knows something about what was
paid. Logistics is part of the Integrated Solutions group, which had 600M in
revenue and contributed just 6 million to income. The IS group also includes
its terminals business. First comes a sale of two terminals for a seemingly
overpriced 115M. Then comes this sale of most of Logistics. So you have a part
of the business that contributes little in income, so is having its asset value
realized in bits and pieces. I bet Buffett did the calculations about what
those bits and pieces that would be sold were worth before he invested. Plus,
they have their GATX Capital group to invest their cash appropriately. Still
holding my shares. This will be an interesting story to develop.

I bought a little Bristol Myers today (BMY) below 50. $30 billion of market cap

forgiven me for selling her Bristol Myers shares two years ago and then

may turn out to be just a trade, but I've been wanting to own a drug stock for

they will. JNJ was the one I had my eye on, but look at the pop that has gotten
off the bottom while the bat stayed on my shoulder. The group has
underperformed dramatically, and this is not typically a group that
underperforms for long. There is a strong argument to be made that if tech

safety. Hasn't happened yet - to them safety still means "tech stocks with

I think the classification of the lease depends a lot on the terms of the
lease. Answers to questions like, "Is the lease cancellable or transferrable?"
would help to understand the actual liability. Unfortunately, I don't know
where we'd get the information to answer my questions.

I like your rule of sticking with investments only when they still meet your

I think you have to start doing some work on it now. I am. Keeping in mind the
earnings adjusted for options.

Not much a value stock, but I should let those here that might be interested
that there is a biotech stock I am about to buy - and it's not something I do
often despite my knowledge of the area. It's Incyte (INCY). I had bought it
before in the teens and twenties. Then it went to 289 (well after I sold). Now
it's in the 60's. The thing is, they sold 2 million shares to Janus at 210 when
things were high. They were one of the very few genomics concerns to get the
deal done when the things were hot. Their burn rate is 30M this year, a little
less next year, then back to profits after a brief hiatus. They are a real
company with a growing off balance sheet intellectual property asset.

There's over $20 (>$600M) in cash on the balance sheet, and the company just
guaranteed itself it won't run out of cash (at Janus' expense)before their
royalties start flowing. This is not easy to model, but I am getting a feel for
a margin of safety. At 60 I would buy, but at 69 I'm within 15%, and I usually
am ok buying a smaller position within 20% of my target.

Hello TwoBear,

I'm not a teenager, but being a 24 year old means that I still sometimes swing
by the 'trendy' businesses to see if I like anything. In the last year or two,
I've probably purchased something from Abercrombie, Aeropostale, The Gap,
Structure, and American Eagle. From what I can remember, I didn't think there
was really too much of a difference in the clothes offerings between
Abercrombie and Aeropostale. It all just depends on what the teenagers perceive
as a trendy store. I've always thought of Structure and Abercrombie to have
better brand names than the rest, but I'm unsure what the current situation is.
I still do have a few teenager connections, so maybe I'll go snooping around.

Grommit: some nice choices you've got there, imo. I'm with you on CMH, WNC, and
SPF. PLCE looks too expensive. I'm looking at DCX (DaimlerChrysler) which has
come down in price, rather than F, which several auto analysts are recommending
as the better buy, I believe. I still have BD (Budget) instead of AVI (Avis).
Looks like AVI though is the better bet at this point, imo. Holding MAXS--- I
don't see much that's changed recently--It may take a couple of more quarters
to see how the Anne Klein line works out.

I've added to my position in CP Clare (CPCL) today. Here we have a tech stock
selling 2/3 of bv and 2 times cash. No long term debt. At higher prices, Marty
Whitman was a buyer for his fund.

I've bought a very small amount of Express Scripts (ESRX). A 'pharmacy benefits
manager', EXRX is seeing booming revenue and income increases. Selling at twice
book and at relatively low price/sales (imo) considering that long term debt
has increased also.

Also, I've added to ECIL (ECI Telecom), as it has moved back down near its

grommit: re. ECIL. refer to my original post #reply-12393960.

One key for me: I see the Bronfman family as "smart money". They caused their
ECIL-controlling company KOR to purchase more ECIL stock at $37. Therefore, any
purchase of ECIL much under $37 by the small investor is a good bet, imo.

Another: Chinese President Zemen and entourage on their recent trip to Israel,
visited ECIL. Also present at ECIL was Israeli President Weizman. I take this
to mean that ECIL is or could be recognized by both governments as a company
whose products and whose success might be important in the development of
business relationships between both countries.

I reluctantly also attach the following URL from MSN MoneyCentral's Eric Dubin
who so confidently predicts a very high stock price ahead for for ECIL. (I'm
saving a copy because if ECIL tanks, I'll at least get a laugh (through my

of course, I'm hoping he is right, even if I don't understand how.

thank you for ECIL. new topic - F.

Ford --
maybe we should kick it around here.

I wonder what the implications of their recently announce $20 per share special
dividend are?

Stock at $55. EPS around $6. Dividend $2. Div yield 3.6%.
after the $20 dividend --

(a) Stock drops to $35 theoretically perhaps.

(b) EPS drops a bit due to less interest earned -- let's say 10% of $20 = $2
per share lower. But after tax, that reduction might be $1.50 or so. EPS now at
$4.00-$4.50.

(c) Regular Dividend remains at $2. Yield = $2/$35 = 5.7%

If this occurs, I would think that the yield might attract a crowd. So perhaps
the price does not drop by the same amount of the special dividend.
Opportunity?

Just thinking,

DELIVERING SHAREHOLDER VALUE: On April 14, Ford Motor Company also announced a
Shareholder Value Enhancement Plan that offers Ford shareholders new Ford

Grommit,

What does "or additional new Ford shares equivalent to the cash value" mean? Do
you have any idea of how the equivalent cash value will be determined? If the
stock is at $60 the day before the distribution does that mean you could get
$20 or 1/3 share (20/60) or would it be 1/2 share (20/(60-20))? Also, if a
large number of shareholders take additional shares might this reduce the
dividend per share? It might be hard to maintain the $2.00 per share dividend
if the number of shares increases by 1/3 to 1/2. Just some thoughts.

I am still not convinced it's the right time to enter ANF. A friend of mine in
the same industry as ANF has said that Charles & Michelle Martin were a big
part of ANF's success. It is my understanding that they are no longer employed
at ANF (although I can't provide any proof other than word of mouth and memory
of a local news article). This may already be reflected in the stock price, but
it may not if earnings decrease.

Other conflicting info from the same person has said that ANF is really run by
it's buyers, and if the buyers remain at ANF, they should perform the same. To
their advantage, ANF is small enough to respond to changes in trend (as
compared to the Gap), if they retain the people they need.

Personally, I would rather miss a little bit of the boat upward, and jump on
after the May 9th earnings report.

I'd like to buy ANF because of the low valuation, I'm just not convinced that
it will be that low of a valuation if their earnings for 2000 are revised
downward (to say less than $1.00/shr).

I am not a current holder or buyer of ANF,(but my mind changes every minute or
so).

Other transactions today:
Sold CCG at 31 3/4
Bought ECIL at 26 7/16 and 26 1/2

I think I missed the boat on HLR. I hadn't mentioned hear yet, but was

F says that they will adjust the dividend so that if you take the shares your
annual dividend will remain the same. They are also spinning off visteon corp

Lisa, <<FILM It sports a 1.81 P/E and a book value of $3...selling at $2.25>> I
think that 1.81 P/E comes from non-recurring asset sales in QE 12/31/98 & QE
03/31/99
Look at 'other income' on IS and asset sales on the CF statement. Pull this out
and the TTM EPS as of 09/30/99 are more like -1.17
Often when small caps show super low PE's, they've stuffed asset sales and

Ouch, I just briefly looked at ANF's 10K and noticed their days COS in
inventory increased significantly over 1998. I hate when it takes the full 3
months to get balance sheet information. I believe this inventory turnover is
faster than GPS, but it may be perceived as bad because they have never had
this level of inventory at year end.

I know it's not that significant, but does anyone know what they have booked as
Accounts Receivable? I don't seem to understand, I thought all their sales were
by cash, credit card, etc.

On EBSC, there are two key events.

The first is the suspension of a huge authorized stock buyback, where mgmt
refused to comment of the reasons for suspension. It is plain as the nose on
your face that this is because they have been advised they can't buy stock from
shareholders when they are working on a deal of some sort.

The second is the recent postponement of the annual meeting from May to August.
If it had been held in May they would have lost some Board seats to an outside
slate and would have barely retained control if they controlled all remaining
outside directors, in office before the 2 added by dissidents last year.

In my opinion, there will be a sale of the company or a leveraged buyout by
mgmt before August. I have always thought in terms of a price of $8 to 10, not
more. Obviously if the stock price is lower, the offered price might be lower.

If there is no sale at all, I believe that the buyback will resume and get the
stock back to $5.

EBSC - You want to probability weight four outcomes:
1) The stock continues to putter along in the 4-6 range until we all give up in
disgust.
2) There is some real problem (credit sub?) that we're all missing, and we're
looking at a $2 stock when the big holders pull the rip-cord and there's nobody
to buy.
3) Management LBOs the company for $6-7.
4) A buyer is found in the $8-10 range.

Unless you assign a big probability to #2, I really like the odds at a price
below $5, especially given the pressure already on management to do #3 or #4.
The new 10-K should be available to the masses tomorrow (I haven't seen it yet,
but others did today - if the whole retail sector weren't getting crushed today
I would not have bought because I would have concluded there was something in
that 10-K that caused a big holder to dump. Maybe there was. But more likely,
we were looking at "its an illiquid retailer, sell it" dump.) A close read of
the 10-K may give a clearer idea of what the weight of #2 should be.

I think my takeout values are conservative - remember, book value is $16, it
trades way below net current assets, the company is profitable and there are
several large shareholders to negotiate on our behalf to get a fair price out
of the buyer. But with the price at 4 and change, no sensible bidder is going
to pay his full price unless there is somebody else bidding against him (and
right now I'd be thrilled to see one bidder).

When I saw the price drop to 4 1/4 today I had the "punch in the gut" feeling
that is usually a great buy signal. But if I see it at 3 1/2 tomorrow, that
will be the "knife in the gut" feeling and I'm not sure what that means.

Surprised to read that "During Fiscal 1999, approximately 42% of
Elder-Beerman's total sales were private label credit card sales. Cash sales
and third party credit cards accounted for 33% and 25% of sales, respectively.
"

and

"All phases of the credit card operation are handled by Chargit except the
processing of customer mail payments, which is performed pursuant to a retail
lockbox agreement with a bank. Decisions whether to issue a credit card to an
applicant are made on the basis of a credit scoring system."

Allowance for doubtful accounts of $2048 on a total of 140,536 does seem tiny
off-hand. I might worry only that sales are based on easy credit, and that
without it, comp sales actually would have declined, along with lower gross
margins.

Nonetheless, no question the price is very attractive.

and you conveniently ignore all the companies losing money, and you assign a
terminal EBITDA multiple of 31x, you can make the Nasdaq worth whatever you
want it to be worth. This guy's assumptions just made me laugh, considering
that I am buying stocks now assuming no growth, margin contraction, and EBITDA
exit multiples of 6x. How cavalierly this "analyst" makes these assumptions,

31, 1998 to close on March 2, 2000 at a price of $5- 11/16 per share, PPM has

Okay, I'll take the other side of SLE argument. Just how long can this company
continue to do it to the duck? I mean when sales growth is 14%, 5%, 6%, 1%, and
0% (1995-1999 year over year)and the last 9 months (ended 4/1/00) a measly
2.4%, how long can reported earnings keep growing "8-10%" (per J. Clarke)?

Looks like they reduced shares out. by over 100M sh since '94. That might have
been a good move. But debt's gone up quite a bit too. D/e ratio is 1.5, higher
than in most past years. How about ringing manufacturing efficiencies out of
their operations? Here I defer to the 10K readers. I recall a couple of years
ago that SLE decided to (and did?) outsource as much of their operations as
possible. Created quite a stir in the media as the scope/extent of it was
unique. But if they don't own their production how can they competently improve
it? I see SLE as an absentee owner and so I'm not surprised even when quality
problems (SLE's food recall) show up.

Maybe SLE is a screaming buy for somebody who knows the businesses, but for
anybody else - they don't get book value back up, they don't get a great
price/sales, and they don't get a great dividend (although on a relative basis
it looks good). They do get a company holding diversified brand names - the
stock of which could revert to its mean value of the last few years (which
would be a good gain, imo). But they could also hold a company where(like P&G),
the disjoint between sales and earnings will suddenly show up to crater their
$15/sh investment.

re: RPM, LANC, ARG, BOBE:

Sold RPM. Just lost confidence in it even though it has a superb sales and
dividend record and low p/sales. Increasing debt, slipping roe, negative Yahoo
posts - got to me.

Proceeds into Lancaster Colony. Mentioned here briefly last year (by J.
Clarke??) Stock rose quickly and now has dropped down into my upper range for
an exploratory position. For a conglomerate that makes mundane "stuff" they are
surprisingly (well, I'm surprised anyway) profitable. Consistently high ROE,
stock buybacks, elimination of long term debt, increasing dividends (37
consecutive years), stock at 3 year low. A lot to like with the financial
performance this company has delivered in the past. (This stock would be
suitable for inclusion in a "mom's portfolio", imo -g-)

Starting a position in Airgas as it fails to meet earnings expectation and
drops to a 7 year low today. Not greatly profitable (ROE), but now selling
below stated book value and only 2x EBITD. ARG is "the largest distributor of
industrial, medical and specialty gases in North America". There's been insider
buying at higher levels.

Adding to my small position in Bob Evans Farms. Stock's attractive to me based
on its relatively low p/sales, price/book, lack of long term debt, established
businesses. ROE is mediocre, sales growth is not stellar. Family controlled,
they've made errors (Mexican restaurants), but have recovered, and core
businesses seem stolid and solid (to me). Looks like in the past 8 years,
$12-13 has been a bottom for the stock. (BOBE closed today @ 13 1/16.) I'm
betting the stock will regress to the 20 level, given some time.

Khalil Ayoub: re OICO. I don't see that there's anything wrong with OICO. I
find OICO interesting for a number of reasons. As you point out, a very clean
balance sheet, plus some ratios - roe, roa, ltd (which is 0) seem to be in a
narrow range. Revenue went from $20M (1996) to $25M by 1999. So to me, this all
means that it should be easy (not necessarily for me though -g-) to put a fair
value on the company. And if an analyst also knew something about OICO's
position vis-a-vis the competition in their gas chromatography business, that
could result in a very excellent valuation.

For me, for a company so very small, not growing too much (imo), in a
competitive business, whose ROE looks to be about 8-9%, maybe 12% in a good
year, I wouldn't ever pay as much as book value- $5/sh - to own this stock or
to acquire the company. And at $4, it is unattractive (to me), given that it's
selling at 6.4x EBITD.

These small companies - I often wonder why they went public or why they remain
so. OICO - I haven't looked at the major ownership - looks like it could be
better served being privately held. Maybe that's the direction they're moving
by reducing shares out.

Took a 20 minute look at ARG- I see little positive in the company, Paul. My
first thought is that it is a poorly managed commodity company-see USU. Next I
examined cash flow relative to enterprise value which is equity +debt/cash flow
and that ration based upon my preliminary calculation is more like 5-6. However
this is an industrial company so there is a necessity for capital expenditures
which last year was $47MM. Since the quality of management by my reckoning is
poor- I have no idea what the true costs of maintaining their infrastructure on
an annual basis should be but we would have to reduce the cash flow by that
amount.
Now I look at what the CFO owns in terms of shares and he owned a whopping
$12,000 worth or so- not exactly a vote of confidence here. It might work out
but I think there are tons of better opportunities out there. Only way I would
consider this if CFO started to buy massive amounts of shares. I also note that
book value included $400MM of goodwill. What is this company trying to do? I
can't tell.

Allen, I bought ALU on the IPO, have not owned it in a long while, but am still
on the mailing list. The stock never has carried any kind of valuation,
probably for the reason you mention, except for a brief Internet spike period,
which is not relevant to its current business. Nobody much likes distribution
companies, so if I am going to buy a small one there I would rather stick with
something with strong
industry growth trends, like SEMI which I mentioned here at lower prices.

Thanks for your opinion on ARG, Armin. I'm focused on their distribution
business, not their manufacturing segment. Which may be a mistake, as I see now
from your post. And so maybe I better go back see what all is involved with
their capital expenditures.

Increasing debt and increasing shares outstanding are negatives. Some of that
(and maybe some of the intangible book value) is possibly due to buying sales.
(Revenues have tripled in past 5 years.) Low roe, roa, profit margins I expect
from a distribution company.

Regarding insider buys: --- (aside: I'm not trying to refute your analyses or
go at you point-by-point. If potential investors don't see value with ARG (and
they may very well be right - 4 analysts DO have this stock as a hold), then
people should move on to where they do see value.) Your post helps me to review
and study more about ARG, so I'll share what I now see. Which, about Mr.
Millay, the CFO who's only bought very little stock in the open market - he may
be new to the company (and be well incented with options). Yahoo identifies a
Mr. Melman as CFO in May 10,'99. With ARG, one basically rides the coattails of
Mr. McCausland, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Director, and
10% Owner. Last year he bought about $3M additional shares between $11-12. (ARG
is now under $6/sh) Also, he, like several other insiders, has exercised his
stock options; but because none has sold the stock he got therefrom, I take it
as a positive sign.

I believe that at current price, a five year low, where price/sales is at a
five year low and maybe about 1/3 where it's traded in the past (albeit when
there was 4x less debt on the balance sheet)- for a distributor company,
dominant in its business (a business not likely to disappear, but subject to
economic cycles) - now's an okay buy-in point for this company.

We shall see!
Paul.

Allen, re. ALU. Yes, that would be another distributor that fits my model, and
I would consider buying. But not now, as it's just been recommended in Business
Week - and possibly why the stock's popped up. It's also been recommended a
couple of times in the past year by newsletter writers in Dick Davis Digest. Al
Frank, for one.

Although ALU might be a net-net, its main business - distributing - is
unexciting to most (me included) - and its main product - beauty/fragrance
stuff - is very competitive and fickle. In other words - a scary stock.
Furthermore - in my most humble opinion - a positive Business Week
recommendation often indicates a top for the stock. And CERTAINLY and WHENEVER,
the word "poised" is used (which BW did) as in "poised for growth" - that is
THE KISS OF DEATH, and indicates a stock that should NEVER be bought on the
arguments used by the author. "Poised for growth" is code for "run from it like
the devil's chasing you"!

Neverthess, in spite of BW's writeup,
I believe ALU, maybe ARG, will be another one of the stocks of distributor
companies that get posted here occasionally, that get dismissed by almost all
readers, but that in time, turn out profitably for those who would have bought.

Bob, re: RPM. I got into a conversation with somebody about it who was

profit margins coupled with Yahoo posts indicating continuation of same because
of industry conditions and poor leadership/management.

Imo, the stock does meet many criteria for a value investment, but I want to
step aside to reassess nonetheless. Something odd about the company (or my
reaction to it)-- don't know what it is. Perhaps about the dividend: too much
pressure on them to continue the fabulous record of increases every year? Too
many acquisitions just to keep the numbers up?

Paul: <<RPM do you have an opinion on it you can share?>>
Been watching it for awhile, but no position yet. Some observations and
concerns:
**At current prices, **IF** long term earnings and growth trends were to
continue, it would be a bargain
**There's merit to strategy of consolidating mature brands in consumer and
industrial areas to acheive cost savings and selling synergies
**They paid a full price for Dap - I'm weary of how acquisitions shake out
**I've seen posts expressing concerns about RPM's Wisconsin Specialty coatings
business - sales declines
**Sherwin Williams has recently acquired two specialty coatings businesses:
Could they impact RPM's industrial or floor coatings business?
**Several Plant & warehouse closings coming up may produce unexpected charges
Bottom line: I'd like to own it, but am in 'hide-N-watch' mode for issues to be
resolved or price that provides clear margin of safety [I'll know it when I see
it, I hope]

Nothing substantive, Bob. A contributing factor to me selling though is that
I've had a very small exploratory position in Lilly Industries (LI) -which like
RPM, is in industrial coatings (specialty chemicals) - going on two years. It
has not worked out for me and I'm losing patience (as well as some money). With
LI, I'm at one of those odd decision-tree forks where - if I am going to make a
decision other than just continue watching and holding it - I will consider
either exiting the position entirely or go the other way and at least double up
on it.
(And dealing with RPM now puts too much into the pot for me to consider.)

re: LANC, CIT, COMS.

Adding to Lancaster Colony today as it continues to make new lows.

Putting CIT Group (CIT)on watch list by starting an initial exploratory
position. Earnings are down- they will be, and have been, affected by rising
interest rates. Question is how will stock respond if upcoming quarterly
earnings are also down. Stock (about 17) hit about 13 1/2 recently. It may very
well get back down there again. At current price though, one gets a large,
well-established and diversified financial company, pe under 8 (so far -g-),
p/EBITD of 1.8, p/cash of 3.8, tons of debt (it's a finance company!) ltd/eq =
6.4. One value fund which (per Yahoo)is a CIT holder is Mutual Shares. I see a
report also that Bill Miller may have bought recently (for Legg Mason
Opportunity Holdings).

Three Com (COMS), market cap 15.3B, owns 95% of PALM (market cap 16.8B)which it
plans to distribute to shareholders in Aug. Something is either too cheap here
- or too expensive -g-. If PALM craters a huge amount - which could happen -
then COMS holders lose out. Given people's interest in PALM handhelds, and from
what I can tell the very large large interest in the these stocks, I'd guess
PALM stock will not halve itself from here. I'd rather be in COMS now than
watch from the sidelines. Be in for a very small amount that is.

OT I hear they finally convinced Ms. Barad to step down at Mattel. What do you
think appropriate severence is for a CEO who takes over when the stock is $29
and leaves when the stock is $12? Heard on moneyline that it is over $100MM. Oh
and she gets to keep her 6MM options just in case. Good to know those directors
really know how to look out for shareholder interests. The guy at Conseco is
only getting $74MM but then again I guess his stock dropped even more. Wonder
what the severence package would have been had Ms. Barad left when the stock

The Mattel severence package was the most obscene I have ever seen. In my
estimation, she owed the company money.

$125,000 a month for ten years, plus they wrote off the mortgage for her house,
gave her a full bonus for 1999 (!) and gave her cash to pay the taxes on all
these goodies. And she got to keep her options to make money off a turnaround.
Obscene.

OT. Armin. My dismay and rage directed to the BODs of these companies and/or
the system that permits this gets the better of my judgment regarding the
overall societal impact of options. Options permit employee 'enslavement'
because they offer the dream of riches that salaries do not. Oftentimes though,
employee success/failure with options is unrelated to 'pay for performance' or
even 'pay for knowledge' that I'm a believer in. Notwithstanding the benefits
of options that could/might/should cause improvement in company performance and
stock performance, I as a stockholder, generally vote against all options
packages.

I gave up in disgust on MAT, and I've sold my position.

<Shareholder Abuse and Defences against>

Until shareholders actually start reading the proxy material and voting no for
these compensation packages and the BOD's who implement them, then they will
continue to be abused.

And then you have the problem of the mutual funds voting in line with
management. So you have to have some type of mutual fund shareholder activism
there also.

So who is to blame? Those who mindlessly mark and send the proxy in accordance
with management recommendation.

Throw the bums out. And their BOD's with them. Its your company after all.

Paul,

OOOT (Very off topic and potentially emotional subject).

Options. For the better or worse, there is NO WAY
for a tech company to operate without options and
option repricing. As shareholders, we can bitch
as much as we want, but the reality is this: for tech
companies the most valuable capital is people, and
people won't go to the companies where they don't get
options. The expectations have become ridiculous,
but don't try to explain that to an engineer whose
friends have just made millions. I've witnessed the
mass exodus from good/great companies with collapsing
stock prices and/or "inadequate" option plans.
Until overall environment of tech changes, there's
nothing to be done.

Executive option packages (ala Mattel) are more
controversial. I am not a huge believer in "superman"
CEOs who turn companies on a dime and are worth
XYZ million options. Best management (think Buffett)
may not be very expensive, but then they only
work for companies they like.

Short note on MAT - see my comparison with OAT
and "selling in disgust". Been there, done that,
and sold at the bottom.

Take care

Jurgis - who sometimes bitches that he did not receive
*his* option package at 80% lower stock prices.

MAT Shareholder activist Ralph Whitworth was elected to the Mattel board to
head off a potential proxy fight he planned to wage at Mattel's June 7 annual
meeting. Backed by the giant California Public Employees' Retirement System,
which has invested $500 million with Relational Investors [a fund run by
activists], Whitworth also represented the interests of immense state-pension
funds in Florida, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin.
I don't expect him to work miracles, but hopefully he delivers some
well-deserved arse-kicks from the inside.
I sold shares awhile back due to OBVIOUS lack of leadership and credability and

Jurgis -Options: <<NO WAY for a tech company to operate without options and
option repricing>>Perhaps, but if options were accounted for same as other
compensation, that'd change. Seems to me options are very blunt instrument for
motivating employees that don't have enterprise level responsibility - most of
em. If the employees efforts don't really effect the share price directly, then
the option is not nearly as effective a motivator as cash based on performance.
And some high tech employees are probably turned off by the lottery ticked
aspect [Hard to buy cereal with underwater options from dud startup]. The only
reason this sub-optimal method of compensation is popular is that it gets a
free ride by not being shown as expense.
Of course, this is an issue for SEC and accounting guys to rule on - if
individual company unilaterally pays with cash instead of options they will
look worse than competitors and be disadvantaged.

OT options. Executive options where the top people take 3% or more of a company
(and maybe where their tenure is short too) MAY be excessive. As I say, I don't
understand all the ramifications of options, but I do understand that execs are
competitive and often stack BODs with their pals. Options are a pendulum that
seems to have gone too far in one direction.

Regarding options and engineers: If options can't be eliminated they can be
reduced. Some ways might be transfer more tech work offshore (ref: 3/00
"Wired", p.152ff, "Bangalore") or at least out of the highly competitive
(mobile) and expensive Silicon Valley; increase jv with Euro. or Japanese
companies; limit ability of engineers to transfer to other companies by
pigeonholing them into very proprietary technology.

employees bear some of the burden of poor performance? If the employee has no
