Boyd Hines, what those charts seem to show is that if you're in the market,
you'd better plan to be in for 20-25 years or more if you want to assure
yourself that you can beat inflation with stocks. And according to that
research, regardless if it is by a one-time buy of either category, or by
annual investments in either category.

These studies and media reports of whether it's large-cap or small-cap stocks
that the better investment are on-going, year after year. To my mind, the
long-term investor is better served by selecting from both categories rather
than choosing one over the other.

OPMR: I like the concept of the business a lot. Retail productivity has lagged
dramatically and ATM's provide somewhat of a glimpse of the future. I'm not
concerned about a sales pause in the light of what, until very recently looked
like a disasterous retail season. Capex budgets tend to be driven by profits
and the outlook for profit has been pretty poor for most retailers. Of greater
concern would be the competitive threat by NCR [Which I've owned but don't
currently]. NCR's Retail Store Automation [RSA] biz is around $1.3 Billion,
where OPMR's ttm is <$0.1Billion. This is NCR's sandbox. They have position in
the mind of many customers as THE trusted vendor for this type of stuff. They
can use package selling approaches to muscle out rivals the size of OPMR. In
short, OPMR must beat them strongly in the performance/technology department to
survive and thrive. I'm not sure they're up to it. But if they are, the payoff
could be large. One possibility is that NCR chooses to coexist in order not to
have gov't issues on monopolistic competition. A duopoly where the 'partners'
dance well together can be a good thing.
Here's what recent units look like:

Insider selling has been consistant and aggressive, but mostly at higher
levels. There's considerable shorting, too. Negative cash flows are to be
expected at this early lifecycle stage. They have $5.70/share in cash and no
debt, so survival isn't a near term concern.
All and all a mixed bag that deserves a closer look.

I wouldn't bet the farm on that study. Using indexes such as the S&P 500 is
pretty much useless. The only thing you can be sure of is the 500 stocks in the
index in 1926 is NOT the same 500 stocks in the index today. A more interesting
study would be to go back 20-30 years and see how many of the companies in the
small vs. large are still in business. My guess is the portfolio would consist
of Dow 30 stocks because all the rest of the stocks had been canceled. Delete
ENE & KM from the index and move up the two highest market caps from the mid
cap index.

IMO, any portfolio intended to be held for that length of time has to be based
on the potential of the company to still be in business after that length of
time. The indexes don't take a loss when one stock is dropped and another
added, individual investors do. Assuming a 30 year time frame is targeting
retirement, the only possible strategy I can think of that would make sense is
to put the money in a mutual fund based on the Dow. The chances of IBM being
around in 30 years strikes me as being a lot better than the chances of Brand X
still being able to carve out their $100 million a year niche market.

Personally, I'm rather fond of small caps, but I wouldn't dream of owning one

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- ESG Re Ltd. (ESREF) director Steven H. Debrovner
resigned Jan. 4, according to a Form 8-K filed Monday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

ESG Re said it received notification from Debrovner of his resignation on
Friday.

Debrovner's term would have expired at the company's 2003 annual meeting,
according to the company's proxy statement filed April 2001.

ESG Re, Hamilton, Bermuda, provides accident, health, life and special risk
reinsurance to insurers and reinsurers worldwide.

In theory the dropping of one stock and addition of another should be seamless,
as you substitute an equal value of the dropped stock with an equal value of
new stock.

The stock that was dropped could outperform or underperform the market from
there. I believe I read once that dropped stocks tend to underperform the
market, but who knows for sure.

The problems with getting long term results from indexes as I understand them:

1. Survivor bias. The US has been successful in wars and diplomacy. But like
the Roman Empire, it will not always be so. One atomic bomb from a rogue nation
or group could really ruin investment results.

2. When it comes to evaluations of micro-cap stocks, I wonder about spreads. If
a stock is 1.0 x 1.25 today and you buy at 1.0, and ten years later it is 2.25
x 2.50, and you sell, you have made 80%. But bid to bid it has moved up 100% in
those four years. There could be some bias to overrepresent profit for such
companies.

3. The rates of return will be lower if you hold in a mutual fund (fund costs)
or if you hold yourself (commission cost).

4. There is a certain fallacy about long term rates. If some Roman had $1,
invested at an annual 5% profit, saved 2 points of that profit (leaving 3% for
consumption and taxes), and left the rest for the family and the family kept it
going for 2000 years, that family would be worth $1.5861 x 10 to the 17th
power. A trillion is 1 x 10 to the 12th power. In other words, there is a limit
on long term investment success due to lack of discipline or war or taxes or
something. The great returns enjoyed in the US in the last century must be
aberational. But who knows, maybe they will continue. It's pretty much the only
game in town to play, anyway.

Indexes such as the S&P and Russel constantly change. The main consideration
for being included in the various indexes is market capitalization. Russel
makes the adjustments once a year and S&P can make changes anytime. The result
is it's almost impossible for the market cap of the indexes NOT to go up. It's
about like cheating at solitaire, if you're loosing, just go through the down
cards until you find a winner. It's the main reason fund managers almost never
beat the performance of the index even if they match the index stock for stock.
When a fund manager sells a looser and adds another issue at the top of the
chart, the fund takes a loss. The index doesn't take a loss since all it really
amounts to is a list of the currently best performing stocks and their prices.

You should be able to find more information on how stocks are added and dropped
at these sites:

While on the topic of indexes, does anyone have a handy link to charts for the

Yeoh! Thanks for mentioning that site!!! Totally slipped my mind.

More on WSRN:

In my opinion, in eliminating annual p/sales and book value/sh, they are saying
these figures are not as important to their readers as other metrics which they
substituted. There are now four eps figures which give primary and diluted and
incl. and excluding (extraordinary charges). Seems like overkill, but with
accounting scandals upon us, maybe not.

More on PSR: There've been many discussions here over the years on the
importance of price/sales in determining value. There was a Ken Fisher thread
for a while on SI, but it died - imo, because the price to sales ratio must
usually be used with other metrics in analyzing a stock. It isn't helpful that
Ken Fisher himself rarely if ever mentions his work on the subject ("Super
Stocks") in his Forbes column. I'm of the opinion he has concluded psr is not
significant to him in his stock selections.

In the media reports in which low p/sales is mentioned as a desirable
criterion, "low" is rarely defined. We know that grocery stores, which overall
have small margins but high volume dollar sales, will have "low" psrs.
Similarly, in industries where profit margins are high (e.g. municipal bond
insurers), those psr tend to be "high". It's my inference that most analysts
and business journalists compare a company's psr to its sector's psr in order
to gauge whether the psr is low or high.

I like to compare a company's psr with its past psr numbers though. Only
recently have I seen this also stated by other investors. In last week's
Barron's, Peter Larson, of the Galaxy Small-Cap Value Fund, was described as
using psrs in the following way, "Unlike many fund managers, Larson doesn't set
price targets for his stocks. Instead, he and the fund's analysts compare a
company's current price-to-sales ratio against historic trends, and against its
market value. Without firm price targets, Galaxy often allows its winners to
ride past the point at which other managers might take profits, another factor
which has helped its performance."
It isn't quite clear to me what is meant by some of this, but I read into it
that he compares current psr to past psrs for the same company when he makes
his sales decision. I use the metric this way also, but find that when it's
helpful, it's more helpful for me in the buy decision.

I've been a fan of p/s ever since reading O'Shaughnessy's books. Of course, he
favored combining low p/s with price momentum. This combination eliminates
eternally low p/s businesses unless the price has been moving up. (As we've
learned over time here, most value investors can't buy stocks with price
momentum even while holding their nose.)

I like p/s because revenues are less fudged than earnings. Also, as your
comment below indicates, far fewer investors are looking at p/s.

<<concluded psr is not significant to him in his stock selections>>Maybe
Fisher's become more aware of PSR's shortcomings in not factoring in debt
structure. That's why I moved away from it. If comparing companies whose debt
structure differs or the same company over time where they've substantially
changed the debt/equity ratio, your going to get misleading comparisons. A
company with very low PSR may be using mostly debt...with just a stub of
equity. So what looks like a bargain may just be treading on thin ice. The main
attraction of using PSR's was that sales are tougher to fudge than net income.
Two aways to get around PSR's limitations would be: 1) to combine PSR screening
with Debt/equity range; 2)Use enterprise multiples like EV/Sales which factor
in debt.

More sources than uses.

Starting to sell Owens Illinois (OI) in the $12-13 range in a non-taxable
account. Average cost is $5+. Discussed this fall
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=16551293 . Applying proceeds
to existing positions in Safeway ($40.xx), Sealed Air($40.xx), Cadbury
Schweppes ($25.xx) and Boston Properties ($36.xx). OI is supposed to earn
almost $2 a share this year, but it looks like their existing asbestos reserve
of approximately $300m is not enough given the quarterly $59m quarterly
run-rate on claims and their insurance is almost tapped out.

Sold Moody's ("MCO") at $39.60 in a non-taxable account bought in 5/2000 for
$23. So far the company seems to be deploying teflon in their role in Enron. In
my view they deserve a minimum $100m judgment for giving Enron the investment
grade rating, and then $300 million for keeping it as long as they did. I am
going to the sidelines because I hold in a non-taxable account. I consider this
a core holding, but hold nothing now. I replaced it with Monsanto at $31, the
global leader in agbiotech. Monsanto is supposed to earn $2... we will see. I
was encouraged to read that third world farmers are using the technology
(mostly illicitly).

Sold American Management at $19.96 in a non-taxable account... average cost
$13. Discussed http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=16481370 in
October. It was just a little too expensive for a non-taxable account. Replaced
this with First American Financial ("FAF") at $18.40. FAF is a title insurance
company with a leading 30% national share. Trailing earnings are $2.04,
forecasted around $1.74. These may represent peak earnings because of the
national level of refinance and real estate sales. Book value is in the $15s. I
listened to their conference call today and like the story. Title insurance
seems like the lowest risk insurance business out there if you do it well. (A
real estate attorney friend says FAF is perceived the quality leader among
title companies in Colorado.) I believe Marty Whitman started a 3 million share
position last year in his "3rd Avenue Trust". Debt is rated baa2 by Moodys.

The public title companies do 85+ percent of the national title insurance.
There are cheaper companies than FAF on a P/B basis, such as LFG. LFG has an
unfortunate event in their history (Commonwealth acquisition) however where
they diluted existing shareholders by a gigantic amount.
http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=faf+fnf+lfg+stc+itic+ctgi&d=t

I also added to Paul's Jakks Pacific at $18.70. Flat organic growth but the
Toymax acquisition looks good to me. I'm not touting JAKK at these levels
because there may be a tsunami of odd lot sales after the TMAX acquisition
closes. I am still taking the position that cash s**ks.

I also started a position in School Specialty ("SCHS") at $26. The company
"...is a direct marketing company for supplemental educational supplies to
schools and teachers for pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade....". They are
a consolidator that is the schools alternative to ODP, OMX, SPLS. This is a
growth by acquisition story where management is aggressive with the amount of
debt on the balance sheet. However, credit quality of their customers is not
much of an issue. The company forecasts earnings of a $1.91 for FY 3/2003, and
the CFO (who sounds credible on yesterday's call) says they expect free cash
flow to approach earnings on an ongoing basis.

I'd like to mention TUG again to the board. I got in about 6 months ago at just
under $9.00, I think.

In the last 12 months they have paid off $33 million of 9.25% debt (around half
of their debt) and have bought back over 2 million shares(about 20%+ of
shares). They are projecting income of between $1.50 and $2.00 for next year.
They have almost completed refurbishing their fleet to double-hull and have
grown revenues and income while doing so.

Between the savings from the paid off debt and the cash flow from operations, I
would not be surprised to see them significantly increase their dividend in the
coming year from the current 40 cents/share to closer to $1.00/share.

My target for them in the next year is to $20.00+ They are currently selling at
around $13.00

I have a position in TUG and will be adding more.

Hi, Brendan Watt. Nice near tripling there on OI!

I keep re-evaluating FAF, which I also hold. It's safe enough imo, if one
assumes fairly competent and honest management - the business looks like it
won't be obsoleted.
Still, in past, the stock has sold for lower prices and at lower ratios of
p/book, p/sales, p/earnings. I don't see what might propel the stock because
title is such a big portion, and that venue of growth won't continue - as you
noted with next year expected to have lower eps.

I like that they are trying to expand from their title insurance business and
become known for an expertise in handling business records. Acquiring American
Driving Records, if they didn't overpay for it, was a good move in that
direction, for example. I once worked for an auto insurance company: before a
prospective policy could be approved (and maybe even with some renewals), the
underwriters would get (buy) the department of motor vehicles history on the
policyholder. This info. often came from 3rd parties (like Am. Driving's
records, I am guessing.) My point: each inquiry is small bucks, but the number
of inquiries to Am Driving's links/databases can be steady, if not large.
(aside: And the possible or actual big-brother, Orwellian, aspect to this
business is possibly a subject for another thread.)

FAF also has a trust operation where they manage over $2Billion. Not much said
about it in the annual report or that I can find in my references.

Unfortunately for me, I haven't been out of merchant bank JPM for many years.
-g-

I added some shares to build up my position in Oct.; right now I'm just waiting
to see what's next after JPM's Enron losses. Figure I'll be trying to hold what
I have another couple of years.

I too like to buy these bank stocks when they're below book value. Not the
standard way to evaluate bank stocks - most analysts have their 'effectiveness'
measures or return on assets - but book value has often worked for me. I can't
find any bank stocks now that look decent to me that are under book value.

(I've bought JPM based on a relative dividend model which has worked for me -
sometimes.)

I'll start a position in BTU.

Peabody Coal is the world's largest publicly-held coal company. Company has
been around for more than 100 years, and has gone through many ownership
changes.

Here are some negatives (excluding coal itself, not a "fun" product or
discussion topic -g-)

1. Latest corporate restructuring in '98 means it's hard to get a good handle
on company's long-term performance.

2. Most (?) new generating plants are being designed for natural gas, not coal.

3. Company is VERY diversified in energy-related businesses, including (ugh)
trading.

4. Company is intending to build generating plants at some of its coal sites
(to avoid shipping coal to distant plants). May be a profitable opportunity,
but surely a large company capital investment.

5. Earnings estimates for this year look like they've been lowered.

OTOH, for some reason, 8 of 8 analysts rate this thing as buy or strong buy,
according to Yahoo.

Selling near it's annual low, at 1.2X book value, being dominant in its
industry, with the possibility that political/social views might favor USA's
coal as a strong part of "energy-independence", I'll take some BTU now and will
try to hold for 12 months to see if there's a turnaround in the stock.

And then there are the Dale Baker types who purposefully monitor those upward
prices and use them as a signal to get in. Sometimes that works (food stocks,
home mortgage co's, recently). 

FWIW, I use price breakouts as a shopping list, then apply value criteria
before I buy. Often I see stocks on the new high list day after day but I can't
jump in because I don't like paying 5x sales or 4x book or a PE over 50 or
whatever.

My consternation comes when those "overvalued" stocks keep going up.

Certainly some great opportunities with that method, Dale. Gambling machines

those stocks. Still, my preference is to seek out and to buy low rather than to
buy high and sell higher. Because if a relatively expensive stock (i.e one that
I've entered after a big move has already occurred) corrects on me, my
inclination is to say I shoulda known better, take my lumps, and move on.
Whereas, if a value stock that's not had a big move craters, I'm in a position
to reassess and maybe add more to the position. OTOH, some of those stocks have
kept going down to zero too. No system or tactic is foolproof,

Blankmind,

I'm looking forward to the 3/31/02 date for SOFN. What's your opinion of the
company's breakup and/or liquidation value?

I differ from your perspective, in that I assume a $0 value for the tax credit.
But I would appreciate to hear a brief valuation breakdownon SOFN (i.e., cash,
intangible factors, etc.) -- and your prediction for final breakup value.

I personally see a liquidation in the $2.75 - $3.00 range, but would like to
hear from you why this is a lowball number -- if that is still the way you
feel.

Did management state that 3/31/02 is a cutoff or liquidation would occur? Or
could this "sale or liquidation" process continue indefinately?

Thanks.

mrcj, "3/31/02" is just the date Softnet (SOFN) plans on making the
announcement on a buyer - but as far as valuations - i'd like to say $13 - but
i'll be happy with half that amount

total curr assets: $79.5 mill
- restricted cash & other non-curr assets: $8 mill
- total liabil: $11 mill
- shs o/s: 25.2 mill
- therefore: $76.5 mill/25.2 = $3.04/share

- then there's the $400 mill in loss carry-forwards; which at 40% federeal is
equivalent to $160 mill; divided by 25.2 mill shs is $6.35/share

- then you have the broadband satellite segment which appears to be doing very
well & can hopefully fetch $100 mill; which is $4 share

- then you have certain intangibles, like the fact that SOFN is NASDAQ listed
company

- if you add up each of these, you get $3+6+4=$13+ intangibles

From:Don Earl
I took a look at BTU and believe a certain amount of caution is warranted. Debt
to equity is .97, which strikes me as absurdly high for any company reporting
enough profits to rate a low PE, especially right after taking in close to half
a billion dollars in an IPO.

I've never owned Apple Computer, but I do tend to think of their balance sheet
as the ultimate benchmark for what a profitable company's balance sheet should
look like. Very low debt to equity (just enough credit to run the business),
and high cash balances with cash making up a large percentage of book value.
That SHOULD be the pattern for ANY company that is honestly profitable,
although probably not to the extreme of Apple.

By now there should be at least some awareness that GAAP, though perfectly
legal, doesn't reflect a company's true financial condition in all cases. Abuse
of GAAP shows up as high book values, low PEs, high debt levels, negative cash
flow and low levels of cash. What it basically comes down to is very large
operating expenses are not being expensed at the rate they are incurred. The
result is earnings are artificially inflated, causing a low PE and a large
accumulation of unrealized losses showing up as book value.

In a bull market the analysts love these kind of companies. They can hype the
"earnings" to anyone who will listen, and no matter what the consensus is, they
always come in on target. It's also a safe bet that the underwriters of a
recent stock offering will carry "buy" ratings on the company. In a bear
market, at the beginning of a witch hunt for accounting abuse, my view is these
type of issues would be fantastically dangerous to own. At least it seems to me
it would be somewhat unpleasant to wake up and find a favorite stock the
subject of headline news in the Wall Street Journal for questionable accounting
practices.

Out of curiousity I recently ran a screen for companies with a debt to equity
ratio over .9 and a PE of less than 100, the result was 897 matches, or roughly
1 out of every 10 stocks in the database. The scary part is those are likely to
be some of the most widely held and widely covered of Wall Street's darlings.

IMO, the sole cause of the current recession was the implementation of SAB 101.
SAB 101 eliminated the practice of shipping inventory to channel partners and
counting it as revenue before it was sold through the value added resellers to
end users. Over a year has passed since SAB 101 went into effect and
manufactures are still trying to work off the past accumulated inventory build
up caused by over supplying channel partners. As I see it, SAB 101 was a walk
in the park compared to what will be required to reform the abuse currently
allowed by GAAP. It will take years to correct and I believe before everything
is said and done that virtually every public company will be affected by the
fall out, even those that don't deserve it. Somewhere down the line I suspect
there will be some wonderful bargains, but in the mean time cash is probably
the best value play out there.

I only see two choices: 1. Try to sweep Enron under the rug and accept a market
no one will ever fully trust, or 2. bite the bullet, accept the damage, and
make the changes necessary to pave an eventual recovery from a lower level. My
guess is a somewhat compromised version of number two will be the outcome, with
a bear market that will last for at least 2 to 4 more years. If I were feeling
even a little bit less bearish, I'd probably be screening for value plays with
debt to equity under .2, but I don't think we're anywhere near the bottom and I
don't want to loose a bunch of fingers trying to catch a falling knife.

All this talk about accounting and its easy to forget that the biggest change
in the current year is one that increases earnings, dramatically in a lot of
cases (IUSA for example), and is completely legitimate. Its an adjustment I've
always made routinely. Goodwill amortization. I'm no big fan of this accounting
change only because it eliminates one of my favorite games.

If the market is going to blow up I think it comes from one of two places - JP
Morgan/Chase blowing up, or a major macro shock from Japan. I am not short JP
Morgan, though I probably should be. Forget P/E or P/B. If what I think is

Interesting comments. I'm not sure if I understood the reference to goodwill
amortization. I recall seeing something (not sure where) that companies would
be allowed to write off all their goodwill as a one time charge. If I'm not
mistaken, for tax purposes it's a 15 year straight line deal, but I've seen
GAAP at anywhere from 5 to 40 years on different companies I've followed in the
past. Since I've always tended to discount goodwill as an asset anyhow, I've
also tended to discount it as a charge against earnings. If we're talking about
the same thing, I think it more or less evens out. I'd be interested in your
views if I'm missing something since I haven't looked at it in any detail.

To be honest, I didn't really expect to flush any other bears out of the woods
with my last post. I don't follow Japan much beyond keeping casual track of the
Nikkei, the yen, and current news on the NASDAQ site. My impression is things
are in worse shape than they were during the "crisis" in late 1998- early 1999.
But I'm never quite sure if I'm looking at sensationalist style reporting or
impending doom. The Nikkei is trading well below the 1999 lows and the yen is
close to that point. It sounds like their banks are in heap big trouble, but
that's the part I don't have any way to evaluate with any kind of confidence
level.

I suppose I'm picturing more in the way of a long steep down trend rather than
a sharp drop. Something like the dot com meltdown where the smart money closed
their positions over a period of time before anyone fully realized the bubble
had burst, but more broad based. On the flip side, the market has reacted so
completely different from my expectations enough times that I no longer believe
in a "sure thing". I hope we're both wrong, but I don't think it hurts anything
to lean toward a more defensive position in the way of cash. There's always
another trade, but there's not always more money.

If the smear & fear campaign being waged against Tyco (TYC) is found to be
meritless, the stock can easily go back in the 60's in no time.

- Here’s why I don’t think Tyco is a total sham about to go under:

- In Tyco’s Statement of Cash Flows for yr ending 9/30/01 -

- under “Investing Activities,” it shows that Tyco used $9.7 bill of cash to
buy other companies

- under “Financing Activities,” it shows that Tyco issued only $6.3 bill of
debt & common shares

- my point is that at a minimum, $3.4 bill of free cash flow was used to make
acquisitions. If Tyco were really strapped for cash; & in such a liquidity
crunch, Tyco would have to of issued more than $9.7 bill in debt & such for the
acquisitions

- Put another way . . . the debt that’s growing on Tyco’s bal sheet is “normal
& rational,” as it’s a function of the debt on the balance sheets of the
companies they’re buying; along with the debt issued to come up with the
purchase price

All of the above may be a bit confusing. But for me, as a CPA, I haven’t been
able to quite get my hands around Tyco’s financials - as they’re a bit
complicated given all the acquisitions. But the above snippet of info shows
that at a minimum, Tyco truly is what they say they are - that is a
conglomerate which is making a ton of $$’s; & using some of it to buy up others
- (note: I'm assuming Tyco isn't cooking its books & all of the 10K numbers are
legite)

I think our main difference of opinion lies in your assumption its not cooking

Of course if it is earning $2.8 a share (70cents times 4) this year then it is
a value. I just question the $2.8.

How much of a charge does it have to take when it sells CIT ($3 Billion pre
tax, I read the book value is $11B) and what is the impact on the loan

has to wonder if its so cash positive why did it need so much commercial paper.

You are a cpa and admit you have difficulty understanding the financials. I am

having a heck of a lot of information- there are all types of leases and all
types of assumptions made regarding residual values. Therefore the cash flow
may or may not be real and accurate. It is impossible to tell. Of course that

TYC comes out a winner:

At least $30Billion Debt gone from consoladated Statements

About $4 billion will go to pay down Commercial Paper.

$3.5B into a share buyback, perhaps as high as $40

They felt [were convinced by IB's] that separate focused entities of sufficient
size, financial and market strength [#1, 2, or 3 in respective sectors] but
with simpler more transparent financials would garner more respect in the
market. I agree. GE is an anomaly. Most conglomerates have eventually failed to
add value. One reason the market gives them sub-par multiples is that the
holder that will pay top $ for the finance unit won't pay top $ for the
electronics unit and so forth. OTOH with focused units the top bidders for each
set the price. The concept of a 'mini-GE' went over for awhile, but what
investors demand now is transparency, simplicity...something investors and
analysts can get their arms around.
With so many managements sticking their heads in the sand and ignoring
opportunities to realize shareholder value, I applaud Tyco management for
agressively persuing it. I also admire their willingness to change strategy
when the market changed and what they were doing wasn't working.

IMO, SAB 101 was a VERY important rule change. The thing I find amazing is a
total lack of any articles on the subject. The whole thing happened almost
completely in stealth mode. I suppose you could call my hypothesis a pet
theory, of the opinion variety, but it's virtually the only theory I've been
able to come up to explain what happened.

Up until SAB 101, the number of companies that would report wonderful revenue
for 18-24 months, then take a massive inventory write down charge, were almost
the rule rather than the exception. Channel stuffing was a common topic on
message boards. I suspect there were a lot of frustrated class action lawyers
who were unable to do anything when a stock lost half its value overnight on
the periodic inventory corrections. It's also a safe bet the SEC got plenty of
complaints.

There's no reason SAB 101 couldn't have gone into effect immediately, but from
the looks of SAB 101A and SAB 101B, there was a fair amount of opposition to
the change. The effect of delaying implementation of SAB 101 for a year gave
money managers plenty of time to close out their positions on the companies
most likely to be affected. The timing coincides nicely with the beginning of
the tech meltdown starting around March of 2000.

For most affected companies, SAB 101 went into effect in Q4 of 2000, that also
happens to coincide with a rash of profit warnings which occurred at the same
time. All available economic data at the time was not only favorable, but rock
solid. Unemployment was low, productivity was high, consumer confidence was at
record levels, etc. In other words, there was absolutely NOTHING to suggest
economic weakness in the US, EXCEPT the sudden rash of profit and revenue
warnings.

With the incentive to over produce in order to pad the numbers eliminated,
there was no reason to justify the overhead of over production. In early 2001
you couldn't go much more than a day without seeing "restructuring" articles
involving massive layoffs. That was the general pattern throughout most of 2001
as companies worked to match capacity to sell through. With the lower amount of
revenue which was allowed to be reported, companies also worked to cut back
other expenses including capital spending.

My opinion is a lot of the damage could have been mitigated if the SEC would
have made some kind of effort to inform the general public of the impact of the
rule change, but the entire situation was allowed to be spun as a meltdown in
the US economy. The spin factor did far more damage than the rule change could
have possibly done alone. While most CEOs knew the reason for their own revenue
shortfalls was SAB 101, the economy was used as a scapegoat and I suspect most
of them talked themselves into believing there was something else going on. The
cutbacks to allow for previous over production were exaggerated out of panic
attacks over the economy. So many US companies are interdependent on mutual
capital spending projects, that the cutbacks had a ripple effect that kept
increasing every time the tide went out.

That's my theory anyhow. I can't link to any articles because to the best of my
knowledge there aren't any. And I doubt you will see one for at least another
10 years. At the same time you won't find a single article on the economy with
an analysis on WHY it took a instant nosedive from top to bottom almost
overnight. The only catalyst during that period of time was the change is the
way revenue was booked.

Feel free to poke holes in my reasoning as I'm sure I don't have all the
answers and the above is the best I've been able to come up with that seems to
cover available information. Since my theory is the main cause of my current
bearishness, I'm more than open to discussion. My argument pretty much comes
down to: If SAB 101 did cause the current mess, what is the likely impact of
enough accounting reform to prevent future Enrons? A lot of companies aren't
going to be reporting the same kind of numbers they have in the past and the
market will react to the change.

UST.

I have a position in UST acquired in 1/2001 at $25.44 that I'm thinking about
adding to. UST is a return on asset (high 20s, low 30s) and gross margin (79%)
powerhouse. My interest is based partly on two WAGs ... that there litigation
profile is improving and that the Conwood Antitrust verdict will be reversed.
There are other "inflections" as well... (a) Revel, their smokeless, spitless
poach will be released nationally this year... it would seem to have the
potential of a mega-brand like Skoal, Copenhagen (b) cost of cigarette pack is
now greater than a smokeless can, (c) smokeless will increasingly benefit from
restrictions on smoking (d) the view among public health professionals that
smokeless is less harmful than cigarettes may gain traction (as apparently it
has in Sweden).

My concern is that should UST fail to reverse the Conwood antitrust verdict
that other antitrust claimants may use the Conwood verdict as precedent and
successfully pursue other antitrust claims. I am an amateur on legal matters.
Does anyone have any comment on this?

I wouldn't be so bothered by the $1.1B judgment and $200,000 interest if I knew
that closed the matter.

Don: There were some other issues contributing to the inventory correction.
When the internet and other high-fying techs suddenly lost access to 0 cost
capital, when the CLEC's imploded, when this spread to equipment providers and
they imploded, when the Fed raised rates a bunch of times...all these were
factors as energy prices imposed a sort of fiscal drag [think multiplier
effect]. There are theories that no one has really disproved that the market
looks thru accounting changes. SAB 101 impacts didn't hit overnight so there
were adjustments.
In short, I agree that SAB 101 has had an impact, perhaps not quite to the
extent you hypothesize [Lack of articles indicates that], but substantial
nonetheless. Also agree that there's more to come.
Here's an interesting research item [looks interesting, haven't read it yet] I

If we are talking transparency I would like to see a lot more transparency with
respect to insider trading. I believe that any insider transaction should be
reported by the company on its website within 10 days. any transaction
involving shares should be reported these includes put call collars, putting up
shares as collateral for loans, sales or purchases directly to or from the
company, investments in company partnerships etc. RE TYCO split IMHO there must
be some which benefits to management that have not been disclosed- have they

Re Tyco split and benefits to management.

Tyco management is very well compensated in stock and options such that they
have a great interest in increasing shareholder value. Although I am unaware of
any additional benefits the two main people (CEO Dennis Kozlowski and CFO Mark
Swartz) stand to receive shares in the spin-off companies. Also, I am not sure
the term golden parachute applies since they have both committed to staying on
to manage the main 'stub' after the break-up.

FWIW I agree with your recommendations for increased disclosure of insider
activities. I heard talk about the SEC decreasing the amount of time for
reporting insider trades (and that is a good step) but the other activities you
mentioned, while not damning evidence of illegal activities, would still be
very good to know.

Benchmark Investing is a method of deriving a downside and upside target price
based on 5 to 10 years of historical Price, Book Value and ROE data. Benchmark
Investing (BI) was introduced in Ken Lee's book "Trouncing The Dow". BI buys
stocks under their downside price with strong earnings (>10%). BI has been
backtested to 1973 on the Dow with an average return of 26% per year.

I've started recently tracking members of the MidCap S&P 400. I have about half
the companies in my spreadsheet. I use ValueLine (VL) as my source data. Here
is the table with the companies that are under their 10 Yr downside target
price.

Ticker, Industry & Name are pretty self explanatory.

Update is the date of the last data update from Valueline. Fresher data is
always better.

Price (date) is the 4:00PM closing price of the stock on the date indicated.

10 Yr Down is the 10 year downside price. The company must have at least 7
years of non-negative ROE data to qualify.

10 Yr Upside is the 10 year upside price. Both upside and downside are
calculated using method outlined in Trouncing The Dow book and BI website.

Price/10YDwn is the price divided by the 10 Yr downside expressed as a
percentage.

5Yr Down is the 5 year downside price. The company must have at least 4 years
of non-negative ROE data to qualify.

5Yr Up is the 5 year upside price. Based on Ken Lee's findings that the 5 year
method works as well as the 10 yr method and also tends to pick more stocks
during long bull markets.

Price/5Y Dwn is the price divided by the 5 Yr downside expressed as a
percentage.

04-06 Down is the 2004-2006 downside price which is calculated using the
projections of Book Value and ROE for 2004-2006.

04-06 Up is the 2004-2006 upside price. If a stock's current price reaches this
level, then that is considered a sell signal.

EPS Growth is the projected growth in EPS for the next 4 quarters versus the
last four reported quarters. I depart from the normal TTD method which is to
use the VL sheet figures. I use the latest EPS data from the VL spreadsheet
which is updated as soon as new earnings are reported.

Buffett Int Val is the "discounted cashflow valuation" that Buffett uses as a
quick and dirty intrinsic value calculation. This is discussed on pages 77-78
of Trouncing the Dow. Basically (Cash Flow/Share - Cap Spending/Share)/long
term interest rate. I use the 30 Yr rate.

Using BI as a starting point, I recently bought BRL. BRL looks strong as both a
BI pick as well as a cash flow play plus they have gained FDA approval for a
series of new generics. Any thoughts...

After raising their dividend every year for 20 years, PLL recently and suddenly

odd and unsettling. Since the primary reason I bought this stock over others

I note the danger of buying primarily for dividend over growth. As you've
suggested, DCI is the better company on many measures, and that is reflected in
its stock price increase since our discussions. Whereas PLL's stock price now
reflects investors like me who are reassessing new info. about PLL and deciding

Bob,

Appreciate the article. It's rather long but well worth the time to read. For
anyone who's eyes aren't already open, it should be a serious wake up call.

A few years ago I held a large stock position in a company which went bankrupt.
At the time I was totally astounded that a company with such an absurd amount
of assets on the books would be completely worthless to shareholders. It was a
spinoff IPO from another company and there was absolutely nothing in the SEC
filings which would suggest the assets had no value. As a result, I became
motivated to take apart the parent company's reports with a fine tooth comb.
Nearly every point mentioned in the article you posted were things I discovered
in the course of researching the company (along with a whole herd of tricks the
article didn't touch).

I like this board and enjoy the comments from everyone who participates on it.
I often feel a certain amount of guilt when I fail to bite my tongue and jump
bearish on someone's favorite stock after taking a look at the filings, but
it's hard not to for anyone who knows where to dig up the bodies.

Sometimes I sort of skim the messages looking for ideas and then pull up some
profiles. On hind sight, Timba's picks are the ones I've found to have the
least skeletons in the closet. I've tended to reject most of them as potential
investments due to the lack of volume on a lot of them, but I'm starting to
wonder if maybe those high quality, low profile companies are going to be the
most likely to weather a bear market targeting accounting abuse. As I remember,
free cash flow from operations was one of his key criteria and it seems to me
if a company has good free flow cash, there's a lot better chance earnings are
straight.

Anyhow thanks for the link. It's been awhile since I've run across one worthy
of a bookmark.

As I read somewhere once, all stocks that go bankrupt at some point in their

secondary "junk" filters like debt/equity, cash flow (Buffett value) and moving

what's most interesting about IVX is that they have greatly expanded their
proprietary program. The prospects for more generic opportunities are dimmed by
lower profitability...even if they they're the first generic, they only get a 6
month window of exclusivity. Then competitors come in and compete away a chunk
of the profit. It's really a specialty chemical business...not bad business but
nowhere near the long margins of the proprietary. Currently Ivx is valued at
the low end of the generic group, yet they have a substantial and growing
proprietary business. The chairman owns a big chunk of the stock so interests
are aligned.

Don: Along the lines of the article, I ran across this quote which I found
astounding [They are talking about a somewhat different and unspecified group
which might account of the difference]: "As reported in The Economist on Jan.
27, 2001, Smithers and Co. examined the true profits of America's biggest
companies and found that--adjusted for stock options--profits were only 37% of
those reported in 1998.".
<<I often feel a certain amount of guilt when I fail to bite my tongue and jump
bearish on someone's favorite stock after taking a look at the filings, but
it's hard not to for anyone who knows where to dig up the bodies.>>I sometimes
feel the same about making negative comments about someones new pride and joy,
but I would personally rather someone here point out the warts on my pick than
have the market do so. I often buy stocks with visible warts yet sometimes fail
to recognize how ugly the situation can get. The comment in Llackey's post "all
stocks that go bankrupt at some point in their collapse show up on a quant
value screen" rings true. I recall mentioning a purchase of Safety Kleen, an
old Peter Lynch fav. Jim Clarke said it looked like a candidate for BK, I
looked closer and sold with a tiny loss. Sure enough, it sailed into
bankruptcy. So one of the reasons I post stuff is to get the negative takes of
others looking from different perspectives. They are doing me a big favor. And
when I jump on someone elses pick...that's the spirit behind it. On so many
boards, if you offer a negative take on something, you're the enemy...they look
for approval and praise rather than understanding what sellers and shorts might
know. A costly mistake, methinks.

Doug Nadworny: re: medmals update. Looks like we both might have (or had)
capital gains in this sector (healthcare medical insurance).

Somebody had warned me not to focus so strongly on book value in this specialty
insurance business because there was no indication that the companies were
through taking large loss reserve charges. I now see that to be so.

The one stock I own in the sector, SKP, announced yesterday they're going to
have a "substantial" underwriting loss. That should drop stated book value more
than I like or would have expected: I'll take my profits now... I've closed my
position early this am.

Looks like it's been a difficult environment for all the malpractice insurers.
ACAP is reporting losses, and I see MIIX Group(MHU), another one that I've been
looking at, said yesterday that they will report "unexpected and significant
increases in loss development" and increases in loss reserves. That makes me
want to wait until I can understand better how the lousy business conditions
will affect the assets of these insurers. (I see as I write this MHU has
dropped 40%+ this morning.)

Anyone buying EBSC lately. Recently traded as low as $1.54 per share on low

Net current assets per share as of November 3, 2001 was $5.69 per share. (At
$2.00 per share its trading at 1/3 of net current assets)

2000 Operating earnings before extraordinary items were $.52 per share. (There
was a $15.9 million charge taken in August, 2000 for the costs of
implementation of their 'strategic' plan and for layoffs of 137 salaried and

2000 EBITDA and extraordinary items was $35 million or $3.10 per share (or
$1.72 after extraordinary item) (am I reading these tea leaves correctly?)

Recent bad news was 16.7% decline in January SSS.

my basis to $3.68). Can't figure out what I am missing here except that general
sentiment is strongly against this form of retailing (also maybe some KMart
backlash, I am guessing).

I am hoping that the steep discount to net current assets will save me here,
but there seems to be no floor.

I know there was discussion of Lease obligations here before, and I did not
factor those obligations into my net net calculation, nor did I figure in any
receivables or inventory impairments.

I compared EBSC to BONT and they seem like virtually the same companies.

Any thoughts?

Elder Beerman sees fiscal 2001 net loss

DAYTON, Ohio, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Regional department store chain Elder-Beerman
Stores Corp. (NasdaqNM:EBSC - news)
on Thursday said it expects a net loss of 8 cents to 11 cents per share for
fiscal 2001, citing substantial charges.

The Dayton, Ohio-based company said it expects its net loss for the year ended
Feb. 2 to be between $900,000 and $1.3 million.
The loss includes $3.2 million in expenses related to the retirement of the
company's former chief executive and $4.5 million in pre-tax charges related to
the default
and bankruptcy filing of Shoebilee Inc., which bought Elder-Beerman's Bee Gee
Shoe Corp. in 2000.

Excluding these charges, the company expects income for the year to be between
$3.6 million and $4.0 million, or 33 cents to 36 cents per share.

Bob,

While I found some of the arguments in the study related to options persuasive,
I'm not 100% sure they were convincing, or necessarily an accounting issue. I
won't say some companies option grants aren't abusive to the point of being
shameful, but I have trouble seeing it as a hit to the bottom line.

The common situation I see with options is where they are, for example, issued
with a $10 strike and exercised at $15. The company issues new stock at $10,
which the company keeps, and the "employee" gets the extra $5. Unless book
value is above $10, the transaction is anti-dilutive to shareholder equity, and
in any case, adds cash to the balance sheet. As far as being dilutive to
earnings; for most companies they would have to issue one heck of a lot of
stock before it would show up as a fraction of a penny. In this type of
transaction I have a hard time following the reasoning that the options should
be marked to market at the time of issue and result in a hit to earnings.

I do see the reasoning behind a situation where the company has to go into the
open market to purchase stock at a higher price than the strike. In that
example it is a cash cost for compensation and should be deducted from
earnings.

As far as excessive issuing of options, or repricing of options, while I
totally agree it's a bad policy, I don't quite see it as an accounting issue.
The practice is usually disclosed to a point where investors can avoid the
company if it's overly obnoxious.

My mind is more or less open on the subject, but I think in general I consider
options less of a major issue than the type of abuse that artificially inflates
earnings by failing to properly account for operating costs, or recognizes
revenues that aren't really there.

Timba,

A few things I feel I should clarify before I express any more investment
opinions (not the same thing as investment advice). First, I think every
private investor needs to find an investment style that fits their own personal
financial situation, investment goals, and tolerance for risk. For myself, I
could probably more properly be called a value trader rather than a value
investor. A long term investment usually means I screwed up a trade so badly
that I let myself get buried in it. At present I'm probably spending more time
screening for the next Enron, and looking for bargains on put options, than I
am looking for the next Microsoft on a stock position. As a result, I'm
probably just about the worst person in the world to ask about buying stock
right now.

I honestly don't recall any remarks I might have made concerning MFW. I did
pull up the profile to try to refresh my memory, and while I didn't like what I
saw, it still didn't ring any bells. On the other hand, I do remember being
super bearish on MOVI and the damn thing went up close to 1000%. I still think
their accounting makes Enron look respectable, but fundamentals don't always
translate to predictable stock movement. Whatever.

I took a quick look at FRD and XNR. I didn't do anything resembling DD, so I'll
just give my first impressions and you can do whatever follow up that seems
appropriate.

XNR has a higher debt to equity ratio than what I like to see, but it isn't so
far out of line as to be unacceptable if everything else looks okay. Cash looks
to be adequate. The part where it says, "Net income from continuing operations"
is something I tend to look at as a red flag. The implication is that there are
"discontinued operations" hiding in the woodpile. Double check the SEC filings
to see what the deal is and go from there.

FRD has a much better debt to equity ratio, but they don't have much in the way
of cash. It appears the stock pays dividends, which might account for the lower
cash balance, but you might want to target some research into following the
money. I don't follow the sector at all, so I don't have any idea what their
market conditions are like. I'll take a stab in the dark and guess that things
are kind of slow and that any upside potential will be controlled by improving
market conditions. Maybe someone with more background in steel manufacturing
can give you better input on what market conditions are like.

Anyhow, I'll just offer some suggestions on where some extra DD might be well
spent, rather than thumbs up or down. I'd like FRD better if they had more cash
and XNR better if they had less debt, but that's more personal prejudice
talking than anything else. I tend to be willing to give up something in the
way of earnings for a clean balance sheet, where another investor might be
willing to give up something in the balance sheet in exchange for earnings. In
the under $3 price range, it usually means picking your favorite 2 out of 3
when it comes to cash, debt and earnings, at least that seems to be the usual
pattern in any issue trading at a discount to book.

Options are a very real economic expense. Whether they belong on the income
statement or just in an analysis is somebody else's question, but you can't
just ignore them. The abuse of options is so extreme that for about a year I
have been voting against virtually all options programs on proxy ballots. I
read last week that Bill Miller of Legg Mason is doing the same. Thats the only
thing that will end this disguised theft from shareholders.

Bill Miller's year end letter is great - look on www.Leggmason.com. Here's an
institutional investor saying quite plainly that he's disgusted with what
passes for investment analysis and management stewardship today. Count me as
another. Just vote against these things.

Bob,

<<<Warren Buffett wrote, "If options aren't a form of compensation, what are
they? If compensation isn't an expense, what is it? And, if expenses shouldn't
go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world should they go?">>>

I know there are a lot of Buffett fans out there, but the logic train is faulty
on this particular statement with false to fact relationships.

The answer to question number 1 is that options are a form of compensation.

Question number 2 can't properly be answered as not all "forms of compensation"
can be treated as an expense. There are plenty of persons who would prefer to
work for lower wages in a happy work environment, than they would for higher
wages in an unhappy environment. In other words, the compensation is pleasant
working conditions, which while it has a real value to the employee, it is not
an expense. The company is able to provide compensation, at no expense to the
company, while adding real value to the employee, and actually cut real
operating expenses in the process.

Stock and options are free money to the company. All they have to do is print
up a few more shares and pay a negligible registration fee. Microsoft employs
47,000 people. Over a 20 year period, the 400 million shares issued works out
to an average of 425 shares per person per year. Issuing the options in lieu of
an average of $20K per year per person in cash, saves the company close to $1
billion per year in wages.

I'd be willing to bet that Warren, like most institutional investors, always
votes his stock in favor of whatever the Board of Directors propose. If there's
anyone in the world in a position to shade the odds in a proxy fight against
increasing outstanding shares or increasing option grants, I would think it
would be Warren. Maybe if folks such as Warren spent less time crying the blues
about compensation, and more time exercising his rights as a shareholder, he
might have less to cry about.

Some years back I held stock in what used to be S3. About every 4 years the
directors would propose to just about double the outstanding shares and issue
most of it to themselves as compensation. When the proposal came up while I
held the stock, I voted my shares against it. When it passed anyhow, I sold the
stock. I never considered it an accounting issue, although it still seriously
annoys me if I stop to think about it.

I notice in the DEF14A that Warren owns 35% of BRK. Did he buy all of his
shares on the open market? Or did he decide somewhere along the line that that
was his share of the company? His compensation so to speak.

Bob,

I looked at MM briefly before things started falling apart. I was getting very
interested and then the "fit hit the shan" before I took a position. As I
started to delve into the issues a little more, I realized I didn't have a full
grasp of the situation. So I backed off. I still don't understand it all.

I'm not sure about everyone else's experience, but it's getting more obvious to
me every day that it is difficult for me to actually evaluate how much I know
about a company.

All my mistakes (losses) have come from situations that I was relatively new
to, but for some strange reason felt confident about after just a few weeks of
looking at the numbers, issues, etc…. I invariably understand way more after a
year or so. Usually, I can tell where I went wrong in my analysis.

I am beginning to contemplate making a rule for myself that I make no
investments at all - no matter lucrative it looks - unless I have been
following the story for at least one year.

James and all,

Another issue is that even with continuing bear
market, the option compensation is still one of
the "most wanted" benefits of the high-tech
company employees. Unless this changes, it will be
VERY difficult to make management discontinue
the option grants and lose the employees to
competitors.

As an investor I may be "anti-option", as an
employee I am pro-option and pro-option-repricing.
So call me a person with no integrity if you want...

Wayne: <<didn't have a full grasp of the situation.>>I just started looking at
it and I just can't get a feel for how likely it is to completely slide down
the tubes. Merrill has it a neutral with a low confidence [no confidence]
estimate of 02 .80; 03 1.00 they just brought down. The AM Best downgrades
affect their prospects going forward and there are debt covenents to be
renegotiated. My interest is peaked since being kicked out of an Index often
drives stuff way below fair value. I'm willing to bet on these situations, but
only if I have at least some sort of feel for the business. I can't even come
to that with this. The insurance business is so squishy, with estimates all
over the place for losses, reserves and so forth, unless you really trust
management, it's like trying to nail jello to the wall to figure what it's
worth...especially with a lot of credit uncertainty and a weak balance sheet.
<<I'm not sure about everyone else's experience, but it's getting more obvious
to me every day that it is difficult for me to actually evaluate how much I
know about a company.>> I hear you, man...and I feel your pain, literally. Been
there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Awhile back I ran across an interview with Marc Perkins that used to do the
Barrons Round Tables on how tough it is know what's going on [He bought Gunther
from Harold Geneen, supposedly a management icon]: <<Marc Perkins: The most
important thing I've learned here as CEO of Gunther International (SORT:Nasdaq
- news) is that anybody who thinks you can figure out to any reasonable degree
what's going on inside a company from the outside is crazy. I mean, it's a
useless exercise.>>
The inverview is a great read from a money manager that transitioned to CEO and
it'll make you feel a bit better about the ugly surprises that seem to crop up
after careful analysis:

Crawford,

- i get more optimistic about Tyco by the day

- Look at the 5 yr chart on Tyco

- In ’99, stock went from $52 to $28; then back up to $60 within about 8 months
-
- reason was that the results were too good to be trued; therefore, there must
be accounting gimmicks, cooked books, SEC inquiries, etc...

- It's going to be dejavu all over again - only this time when they realize the
results are for real - i say stock price goes from current $27.50 to $80+ -
especially when they're tracking to do $4+/share in earnings - but over the
course of a year or so
