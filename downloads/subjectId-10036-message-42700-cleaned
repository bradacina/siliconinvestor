HPQ - I bought more. I don't really know if I should skew my purchases to MSFT,
INTC or DELL more. MSFT and arguably INTC have much bigger moats than HPQ and
DELL, so perhaps I should concentrate on them. I wonder if there is a scenario
where HPQ and DELL hugely outperform INTC and MSFT. I guess the only such
scenario is where HPQ and DELL get a lot of money from services and infra
buildout that don't benefit INTC and MSFT. Not clear if such scenario is very
feasible.

IMHO all of them are cheap. However, if we get a recession, all of them will
tank. But then almost all other stocks will tank too. :)

Oh, sure it's the government regulations that make life miserable for these
great companies. If only there was no 90/10 rule, they would never hire sleazy
car salesmen to persuade low income students take out ginormous loans to pay
for worthless crap degrees. Yeah, they need less regulation, not more! Let's
all write the congressmen so they would improve the conditions for for-profit
education industry. 30-100% ROE and 30% growth rates are not high enough, they
are clearly suffering.

Don't you know that in 2008 - long before the poor guys were tarred with
"Subprime Goes to College" - the CEOs of for-profits gathered for a march to
Washington. They went to Education Department and begged to change 90/10 rule
so that they could lower tuitions and get less profits. They said "we don't
need more money, we are getting too big profits, we want to do civic duty and
give students more affordable education, let us cut tuitions 50%!". But evil
bureaucrats just laughed at them and said: "You have to keep tuition high,
that's the American Way, let the poor suckers suffer".

Jurgis, Delta is mostly life insurance which is a different sort of risk than
re-insurance business. For diverification purposes, I like to own some of both.
I am in fact coat-tailing Einhorn but I came to my own conclusions why I like
it.

1) Good track record with risk management (note the miniscule exposure to PIG
debt)
2) Spinoff situation
3) Large discount to embedded value (~32Euro/share)
4) High dividend yield with a chance for further increases
5) High market share in Benelux
6) Hidden value in asset management operation and niche banking.

I sure can buy a dinky life insurance company like KCLI and NWLI but in both
cases, the companies are very small, dividend yields are miniscule and
management is entrenched, so change is not very likely. I believe Delta Lloyd
should perform better because of above factors. My target would be 80% of
Embedded value, which would be 26 Euro. I believe that Einhorn has done his
homework, he is very good at analyzing financial companies.

re HPQ - I believe the new CEO is an incredible poor choice. This is based on
what I hear from some of my buddy's working at SAP (his last stint). It is rare
that a CEO in a German company (where leadership is much more a team effort)
generates such a negative reaction. Based on that, I considered him
unemployable and I shook my head in disbelieve when the HP board choose him.

I believe he was choosen for his "expertise" in software. I think we will make
a very big and overpriced acquisition in the software field that will put more
pressure on the stock. I could eat my words he if he turns out to be a great
CEO turning HPQ around. But I doubt it, I believe he will runs this company in

Looking at SAP performance 2008-2010 - during the financial crisis, I have to

The shareholder funds of life insurance are sensitive to spreads, as well as
changes in absolute interest rate levels. If those change, book equity will
change. unless it goes to extremes, affects, the solvency as determined by
regulators, or real losses occur in the credit portfolio, it should not be a
major concern. At least that is my understanding.

Also note that Embedded value (the discounted cash flow value of the insurance
book) has gone up 10% during the quarter.

Personally, I have seen very few CEOs who are motivating to employees. IMO
almost all of them are used car salesmen. And we can cover the best of them:

Everyone I know who worked for Apple hated Steve Jobs. Of course, these were
pre-"Apple renaissance billionaire" employees. Lou Gerstner? Maybe you should
ask what Lotus folks thought about him. ;) Gates? His strong side wasn't
employee motivation either.

On the other hand, I've met one CEO, who was kinda nice and personable. He was
fired recently for "destroying" the company he led. While I don't think
"destruction" was his fault, IMHO being personable won't help you if company
sinks, and being an asshole does not matter if company grows/excels.

Of course Apotheker will be hosed if HP continues to shrink when Dell prospers.
;)

You are misrepresenting his memo though. It wasn't addressed "to his grunts".
And IMHO it's pretty OK as internal crap memos go. Even at a company with IMHO
great CEO, I've seen him sending crap HR memos to "grunts": "Travel restricted,
don't sneeze, don't print, save the pennies, blah blah blah". I would not judge
the company by its memos. ;)

I am wondering why everyone is so down on HP PC sector slowdown. I looked that
10Q and PCs are ~30% revenues but they have been only ~15% of earnings for last
year or longer. What's the deal to throw a fit about this now?

BTW, I was wrong in my previous writing where I said that MSFT and INTC are
better proxies for HP and DELL. At least for HP, MSFT and INTC are not proxies
since HP has majority of revenues and earnings from non-Wintel sources.

Jurgis, yes I know crap memo's too but per my own experience, a good CEO with
communication skills can make a huge difference. My believe is that Leo A. is a
very poor choice for HPQ, that HPQ has problems anyways (printer franchise is
running out of ink , Palm staying rather calm <g>), that the new CEO has no
other choice but to make huge acquisition. I initially bought some HPQ directly
after the Hurd disaster but sold as quick as I could find the sell button when
I head the news about the new CEO. Now I could be wrong if course but I'd
rather follow my gut instinct in this case rather than buy based on some
metrics (which indeed look cheap).

I see a lot of blood sweat and tears for shareholders in the next 12 month, for
me the potential gains are much smaller than the huge (imo) risk. High tech

Funny you mentioned RIMM. I am back into it based on my thesis that NOK's
decline this year will be fast enough to lift all boats including RIMM. ;)

I disagree with your comparison of HPQ to RIMM/NOK. As I said in previous
message, most of their sales and profits are enterprise/services, which are
very different from mobile phones driven by fashion. I think Apotheker is
trying to goose up the enterprise even more, which is not a bad idea.
Enterprise only goes down if we hit recession or if the technology is not
competitive.

On the customer side, I agree that printers are less of a business nowadays.
Palm acquisition was a mistake, but we can't blame Apotheker for that (or can
we? ;)). Personally I and most of my family have HP laptops and love them.
However, they are niche product - heavy but with excellent graphics cards - in
essence desktop replacements for heavy duty gamers - or Alienware at half the
price. :) I don't buy HP based on my laptop preferences though - my tastes are
niche and most of the companies whose products I use don't fare well. ;)

I agree that all of these companies will go down in a recession, but my view

Jurgis, it is true that HPQ does not face rapid obsolescence of it's product -
I do think though that the printer business may get there in a couple of years.
Palm was not Leo's mistake either but he still has to deal with it. I also type
this from a HP desktop PC (value class but relatively well equipped and
purchased with EPP discount). Goosing Enterprise is good but there are no cheap
targets around, which is a different situation compared to a few years ago. It
is also a very crowded field with IBM, Oracle and others sitting pretty.

As for RIMM, I have heard the argument before that NOK downfall may lift all

KCLI is crap. NWLI - hmm. It had 9% book growth for the last 10 years and I
assume they can continue on that clip. This is somewhat OK but not stellar.
Other insurance companies have higher book growth rates, though mostly
book-per-share growth due to share repurchases. Compared to something like ENH
who had huge losses on cats, NWLI looks pretty good. ;)

One big issue about insurance book growth is that they hold mostly bonds as
investments. Bonds had higher yield for most of last 10 years and they
appreciated when yields dropped (assuming some holdings in long bonds + no
stupid CDOs or MBSes), helping the book growth rate. OTOH, current situation
will hamper the book growth in the next couple years - bonds are returning
almost nothing and rising interest rates would drop prices of any long bonds
held. Although I assume most insurance companies are trading at discount
exactly because of this reason. :)

But then if you look at their 10 year results, they all look fine. And if you

GFRE-The article raises some interesting questions as do the comments.
It will be interesting to see the timing and amount of shares bought back by
the company. I have nothing against Kerrisdale, they made a good score shorting
gfre. My guess is that they published this in order to buy back their short
position. It was interesting to me that they recently put out their quarterly
letter and they did not note in that letter that they were short GFRE so it
seems strange that they would disclose something publicly that they did not
disclose to their investors so my guess is that they listened to the conference
call and decided to buy back their shares. Its also interesting to me that none
of the short sellers are saying anything one way or another about the cash
position which was confirmed by auditors at year end. On top of that cash and
account receivable are over $3.00 a share as of 3/31/11. If I were a short

PNSN has a significant "yuck" factor associated with it. The hit from the

customers don't flee in droves (I don't think they have reason to), PNSN should
be alright at these depressed levels.

the interesting thing about PNSN is that it would benefit enormously from
higher interest due to the large float that i inherent in their business. It is

Actually, I think it's more due to the retailer rotation at least with ARO. ARO
did great 2-3 years while ANF was in the dumps. Now ANF is back and ARO is out
of the (fashion?) loop.

I will have to evaluate whether specialty retailers like one of the Yahoo
Breakout yahoos said "are for trading only, you never invest in them long
term". I don't quite agree with him, but he has a point somewhat. It's almost
never good to buy the specialty retailers when they are on the wave. Cause the
fashion is fickle and the crashes are deep. ;)

re ARO, GAP - with this inflation in clothing, I wonder if we should invest in
the producers of such. It seems that a lot of closing is made in Vietnam
nowdays, so maybe the VNM is a contrarian buy.

the VNM is down because if double digit inflation but if those companies can
raise their US$ prices by 20% (based on GAP report) they should be just fine.

Maybe you can find a play in coffee. Vietnam is the world’s biggest grower of
robusta beans, used in instant coffee and espresso.

Thai Hoa Coffee Production Plant, Thailand
http://www.foodprocessing-technology.com/projects/thai-hoa-coffee/

From the article:"...Thai Hoa Production and Trading Co is one of the foremost
coffee producers in Vietnam, responsible for the export of over 50,000t per
year of Arabica and Robusta beans. Established in 1996, the company has around
1,000 employees and sales approaching $100m per year. The company is currently
in the process of constructing a new instant coffee processing plant in Dinh
Van, Lam Ha, Lam Dong province...."

This is the only Private Coffee Producer I found in Vietnam:
Highlands - VTI Foods Group.
http://www.highlandscoffee.com.vn/aboutus_whoweare_vti.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The other largest producer of Coffee is Brazil.

Coffee production in Vietnam
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_Vietnam

Vietnam is the second largest producer after Brazil, accounting for 14.3 per
cent of the world market share.[3] The quality of the beans, however, has
typically limited their marketability. Robusta coffee accounts for 97 per cent
of Vietnam's total output, with 1.17 million tonnes exported in 2009, a value
of USD 1.7 billion. Arabica production is expected to rise owing to the
expansion of growing areas.[4] Other types of coffee grown in Vietnam include
Chari (Excelsa) and Catimor.

re Jurgis, I kind of guessed that closing would not be a large component of the

rise in price, it would be good for economies like Vietnam that are build on
low labor costs. The banks and financials are just derivative plays on the
overall health of the economy. Oil is OK too, although I don't see TLM really
belonging in there.

The inflation and the high interest rates are an obvious issue, but it seems
that the companies should be able to prosper even in that environment if they
can pass on the increased cost.

For a Vietnam fund, i would prefer a composition heavier on consumer plays and
industrials rather than the 37% allocation of financials.

The forecast of 41.42Yen/share is hidden in the Japanese part of the IR

http://www.nippon-soda.co.jp/financial_fact/pdf/20110513.pdf

I simply deduct this from the structure since the Japanese earning releases as
they are all formatted the same.

From the difference between the company and the consolidated numbers for Y2011,
I deduct that at least 50% of the operating earnings are from foreign subsidies
. These a "look through" earnings, using the equity earnings method, as is
customary in Japan. In terms of net profit, the contribution of foreign
earnings is even higher, if you assume they don't have to pay for the company
overhead since they pretty much appear to be self sufficient, in fact I believe
the Japanese leave the management of this company (which appears to be local
talent) pretty much alone (probably for the better).

The way I see it, if you buy Nippon Soda, you get worldwide AG operations with
an approx. earnings power of ~25Yen, so the Japanese business is pretty much
for free if you assign a 12x earnings multiple to the foreign operations.

Aberdeen International (AAB.TO AABVF),

I just listened to the portfolio update call. The portfolio value was down a
bit for Q1, as I guesstimated, and my guesstimate is that so far for Q2 it is
down a bit more. Still the the portfolio is valued at 1.37 CAD plus there are
their royalties, which were valued at around 0.14 CAD last quarter. The stock
is trading at only 0.78 CAD.

Thus, the stock is still trading a big discount to NAV with lots of potential
upside (privates going IPO, incentive warrants marked at 0, etc), and I like
the management team. The Q1 quarterly call update was upbeat and to me they are
doing all the right things, including a normal course issuer bid.

I have a decent-sized position and am looking to build an overweight position.

That being said, the results of this Peruvian election could impact their major
holding in Sulliden. Management is confident in the value regardless of the
election, but the election could lead to significant volatility in this highly
overweighted holding and thus volatility in Aberdeen itself.

Also, my mining investor friend talks about the seasonality of precious metals
and miners, mentioning that the weak period runs through August and that it
might be better to hold off buying to get a better entry opportunity.

Anyway, I have seen a seasonality chart, and it looks pretty impressive with
noticeable summer doldrums and a big spike up in Sep-Oct. However, certain
seasonal factors (such as Indian gold buying) seem to be less and less
important nowadays. Do any of you subscribe to this seasonality and believe it
will continue going forward?

Did anyone actually read this far??? :)

I know AROW and FRAF.OB. I agree that AROW is a tight ship but it is a little

upside to earnings, unless they can make an accreditive acquisition.

I have FRAF on my watch list and owned it for a little bit. I sold, because I

I bought AAB shares as a value bet, and stock still seems to be as good or

who is to say that the sharp decline weve already seen is all those people

Gold, silver coins to be legal currency in Utah
http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iVwtsZHKs7A_uQEDwUlnH2P1jJ3Q?
ocId=fdc78f4b243f4e1facc5982a1fc02836

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah legislators want to see the dollar regain its former
glory, back to the days when one could literally bank on it being "as good as
gold."

To make that point, they've turned it around, and made gold as good as cash.
Utah became the first state in the country this month to legalize gold and
silver coins as currency. The law also will exempt the sale of the coins from
state capital gains taxes.

Craig Franco hopes to cash in on it with his Utah Gold and Silver Depository,
and he thinks others will soon follow.

The idea is simple: Store your gold and silver coins in a vault, and Franco
issues a debit-like card to make purchases backed by your holdings.

He plans to open for business June 1, likely the first of its kind in the
country.

"Because we're dealing with something so forward thinking, I expect a
wait-and-see attitude," Franco said. "Once the depository is executed and
transactions can occur, then I think people will move into the marketplace."

The idea was spawned by Republican state Rep. Brad Galvez, who sponsored the
bill largely to serve as a protest against Federal Reserve monetary policy.
Galvez says Americans are losing faith in the dollar. If you're mad about
government debt, ditch the cash. Spend your gold and silver, he says.

His idea isn't to return to the gold standard, when the dollar was backed by
gold instead of government goodwill. Instead, he just wanted to create options
for consumers.

"We're too far down the road to go back to the gold standard," Galvez said.
"This will move us toward an alternative currency."

Earlier this month, Minnesota took a step closer to joining Utah in making gold
and silver legal tender. A Republican lawmaker there introduced a bill that
sets up a special committee to explore the option. North Carolina, Idaho and at
least nine other states also have similar bills drafted.

At the moment, Franco's idea would generally be the only practical use of the
law in Utah, given the legislation doesn't require merchants to accept the
coins, either at face value — $50 for a 1-ounce gold coin — or market value,
currently almost $1,500 per ounce. And no one expects people will be walking
around town with pockets full of gold and silver.

Matt Zeman, market strategist for Kingsview Financial in Chicago, expects more
people will start investing in gold as America's growing debt and bankruptcies
in other countries continue to decrease the value of government-backed money.

"You've seen gold replacing these currencies as safety instruments," Zeman
said. "If I don't feel good about the dollar or other currencies, I'm putting
my money in precious metals."

Some supporters, including the law's sponsor, seek to push Congress toward
removing the tax burdens that discourage use of the coins, such as a federal
capital gains tax.

"Making gold and silver coins legal tender sends a strong signal to Congress
and the Federal Reserve that their monetary policy is failing," said Ralph
Danker, project director for economics at the Washington, D.C.-based American
Principles in Action, which helped shape Utah's law. "The dollar should be
backed by gold and silver, so we have hard money."

The U.S. and many other countries largely abandoned gold-backed money during
World War I because they needed to print more cash to pay for the war. Later,
during the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt took steps that
essentially prohibited gold and silver as legal currency to prevent hoarding.

In 1971, President Nixon formally abandoned the gold standard.

Fifteen years later, the U.S. Mint began producing the gold and silver American
Eagle coins, primarily aimed at investment portfolios and allowing people to
trade them at market value but with capital gains taxes on profits.

Utah is now allowing the coins to be used as legal tender while levying no
taxes.

Opponents of the law warn such a policy shift nationwide could increase the
prospect of inflation and could destabilize international markets by removing
the government's flexibility to quickly adjust currency prices.

"We'd be going backward in financial development," said Carlos Sanchez,
director of Commodities Management for The CPM Group in New York. "What backs
currency is confidence in a government's ability to pay debt, its government
system and its economy."

Larry Hilton, a Utah attorney who helped draft the law, disagrees and says the
gold standard would restore faith in American money at a time when spiraling
debt is weakening confidence.

"We view this as a dollar-friendly measure," Hilton said. "It will strengthen
the dollar by refocusing policy matters in Washington on what led to the
phrase, 'the dollar is as good as gold.'"
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Such a bank would make it easier for the Gov to seize coins if/when they make
owning them unlawful. Not for me. E-Bay continues to provide a good source of
liquidity.

Here is the listing of their Historical Annual Cash Distributions:
http://www.algonquinpower.com/unitholder/distributions.asp

0.24 CAD/year 2010 (Note: 1$US = 1.02 CAD)

The "true net dividend payout to U S residents" will depend on the value of the
$US as each quarter US residents get their dividends converted to $US.

There is also a 15% Foreign Tax witholding if not held in an IRA account.

The actual dividend received after $US conversion over the last year might be
as much as $0.01/share more making the yield around 4.5%.

The big impact of a falling $US for this company is the valuation of Both their
$US debt and value of their $ denominated U.S. assets.

You can read what I wrote on the Dividend Investing for Retirement thread
regarding the large one time gain/loss.
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27380135&srchtxt=aqunf

For me this company pays an ok dividend, is growing their revenues through
acquisition (revenues s/d double next year) and provides a hedge against a
falling $US. Next year's PE is still high around 15 but reasonable given that
50% of their earnings come from their regulated Water business. That's a little
below what other water companies are priced at.

Algonquin Power is much smaller w/ large growth possibilities. I have a small
order in at $5.55/share to establish a tracking position but anything more is
too expensive for me.

SAH...rllee & technical "analysis"

re 200dma...I don't look at such charts or "statistics" and not sure why you'd
make such a comment on a value investing board.

re bottom feeding...Lots of value investing looks like bottom feeding. I like
to buy at the bottom.

I've made quite a bit on SAH in the far past and think they're underpriced
right now.

If you see issues with their fundamentals, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Williams Companies, Inc. (The)(NYSE: WMB)
El Paso Corporation Common Stoc(NYSE: EP)

It looks like EP is going the way of WMB and spin off its pipeline business
from its E&P division.

El Paso rallies after setting spinoff plans

Shares of El Paso Corp. rallied as much as 7% Tuesday after the company said it
will split into two publicly traded companies by the end of 2011, as it ramps
up efforts to boost domestic oil and gas production.

From the article:"...The company said E&P Co.’s future growth will be fueled by
more than 10 years of low-risk, repeatable drilling inventory, including
positions in the Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp shales in Texas and the Altamont field
in Utah.

These and other properties “are expected to provide a profitable and rapidly
growing oil-production profile,” El Paso said.

El Paso said it expects the E&P Co.’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization to grow by about 20% in 2012. ..."

Disclosure : I own both EP (@ $7.94 7/2003) and WMB (@ $18.25 9/2009). I
already peeled off some EP shares and put proceeds into a few small E&P
companies. Both companies are still value investment holds for me. I am looking
for %35.00/share in WMB before I peel off some shares and around $28.00/share
in EP after their announced spin off.

Canadian withholding (tax). I find EKS to be correct: In my <u>taxable</u> USA
accounts, there is a withholding with dividend-paying Canadian corporations. I
don't know about in USA retirement accounts (ira's)--- I don't see any Canadian
corporate dividend-paying companies among my holdings there.

Hi Paul -

Re: Triangle Petroleum Corporation (AMEX: TPLM )

Triangle Petroleum Announces Acquisition in Williston Basin, Provides
Operational and Acreage Inventory Update
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Triangle-Petroleum-Announces-iw-3211817588.html?x
0&.v=1

From the article:"...announced acquisitions totaling approximately 42,000 net
acres prospective for the Bakken and Three Forks formations in the Williston
Basin...."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is really positive for the long term as the Williston Basin is an
excellent production area.

I am holding off on buying more shares for now as I believe there is another
10% correction to go in this sector (ie small cap E&P companies).

I was encouraged by EP's announcement today that they plan to spin off their
E&P Division to shareholders. They have had positive drilling results in the
Eagle Ford and Wolfcamp shales in Texas and the Altamont field in Utah. The
company forecasts at least a 20% increase in earnings from this division for
2012. I expect similar results for other E & P companies that have rigs located
in this area.

As long as these E&P companies can operate like EP, those that can book
positive earnings (or are very close to break even) could in fact begin to
record positive earnings and shown 20% growth looking forward. This is the
sweet spot for the value investor as the market rewards these profitable growth
companies w/ generous PE's. TPLM fits this category as they should be
profitable this year. The company now has 42K acres in inventory to use for
future growth which should significantly contribute to their future earnings.

Several of us here hold Total (TOT). That stock has slipped a bit recently:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=TOT+Basic+Chart&t=1y

I'm going to begin to add more to my position now. A few shares now, more if/as
stock drops.

I see in April you mentioned McDep opinion on TOT. That reminded me to check
the site, and there is a new report. Wulff says in part, "Oil production counts
for 68% of our (McDep)estimated Net Present Value (NPV) of $111 a share. A
third of the company’s combined oil and gas reserves are in Africa. Only about
2% of global reserves are in Libya where production is halted for now.
Meanwhile, low McDep Ratio is further corroborated by the second lowest
unlevered cash flow multiple (EV/Ebitda) of all large cap buy recommendations.
Beginning later this year, Total will start paying dividends on a quarterly
schedule."
This report, posted a couple days ago, was sent to subscribers in early May
with TOT share price then over $60 (now $55+).

P/e is now very low compared to historical averages. Then too there's the
dividend. (Although hurt by a 25% withholding tax if in ira/15% if in taxable
accounts.)

In summary, at current price, a lot to like for conservative investors.

BAC @13.31$ AGII (add) at 29.02$
re BK - i wished i had trimmed some of my shares too. I am staying put at
current prices, it has been a disappointment.

I did buy a little BAC and added some AGII, the reinsurance company. Both have
some fat tail risk, actually with BAC the risk is not really with the tail, it
is with the body <g>. Still it is cheap enough to take a flyer on it, imo and I
am willing to add more.

I have nothing against using fundamentals to screen for stocks to buy. However
I find technical charts help me determine entry points as well as warning
signals even if it were a value stock. Just my style in investing.
