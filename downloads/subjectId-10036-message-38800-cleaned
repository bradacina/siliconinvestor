UVE. Looks very good on the numbers: High profit margins, continuing growth in
book value, increasing revenue and profits (nice quarterly), terrific dividend
yield.

Same comment as previously: I'm suspicious it's too good.

Wind policies in Florida seem to dominate. I don't know how they limit possible
bunching of policy claims arising from one bad hurricane from wiping them out,
but I assume they must. Insurance industry is so competitive, who else can
afford to pay a distribution like these guys? Maybe they're somehow uniquely
linked into the Florida state insurance operations. Public history of UVE seems
to be five years with info. available for ten. So they've gone through some
weather/insurance cycles, and I guess they understand risks. On the one hand,
it seems that with book value going up almost ten fold in ten years, they are
doing something very right. Otoh, how the heck can they pay shareholders an
annual dividend of .40 from a $2.93 stated book value, and not be doing
something risky? (I might have a bit more confidence if, assuming there is such
risk, that I knew where that risk was, so that I could make some sort of
assessment. Too much assets in equities vs. fixed income in the reserves? Too
under-reserved? Too many under-priced policies? Something somewhere??)

This one's too tough for me, so I pass. Jmo, wrong though I seem to have been.
Anybody else here with an opinion to offer on UVE, please chime in.

FWIW, it looks like GMXR ongoing costs are too high to make a profit at current

Yes, the stock is cheap. Also, receivables are almost non-existent. That's very
unusual for a Chinese company, but typical in the Ed. business in China. First
quarter showed no growth, but in the latest quarter total revenue grew 33% and
net income grew 29.9%. Company is still predicting 30% increase in revenue
growth for 2010, so things will have to accelerate in the second half. It's the
dilution that makes the comps look bad.

JNJ now $58; ten years ago about $48-$49. A 20% gain in ten years.

Who ten years ago bought JNJ just for the dividend? Weren't big pharma supposed
to be growth stocks, and JNJ among the most consistent of that group -- with
sales and earnings to be growing every year? And so I assume one would expect
the stock to appreciate more than an uncompounded average 2% a year.

If you've owned JNJ for ten years and are not disappointed by these numbers,
well, more power to you. I own JNJ and if it only continues to appreciate 2% a
year from my buy price, and its dividend provides -- even after yearly
increases -- a yield of say 4-4.25%, then I expect I might be disappointed and
eventually use JNJ as a source of funds for something that might seem more
attractive to me.

It has returned $12.25, or 25% in dividends over that time too.

Yes. I'm not sure of the subject though. Would investors be disappointed in the
stock performance? Perhaps I presume to much by saying yes. Would you be
disappointed with 25%+ 20% = 4.5% average return if when you first bought JNJ
ten years ago, you knew that's all the return you were to get? Or is it, are
investors now looking back and seeing that every other big pharma did worse, as
did the S&P, so they are not disappointed by JNJ's stock?

If you reinvested dividends, you've picked up more shares at lower prices, so
maybe you've done better than 4.5% average return. So would that be a reason
JNJ's stock price wouldn't be a disappointment to you?

If you believe JNJ's stock performance over the next ten years will be the same
as the past ten, would you be a buyer now? For me, I would not. (I'm buying
because I'm betting JNJ's stock from here will handily beat that 2% annual
appreciation.)

Date:8/13/2010 5:52:34 PM
From:Spekulatius
re JNJ - yes I agree returns should be better going forward. What has happened
is that during the last 10 years, revenues and earnings have doubled, and the
PE has contracted by 1/2 (from ~20 to a PE of 11 now). In effect that has
caused the stock price to stagnate.

Of course that could happen again in 2020, JNJ revenues could double again and
the PE could compress from PE=11 to a PE=6.5. Don't laugh this is not
impossible. For example LLY (another ex- growth stock) briefly traded at a PE
of around 5-6 and for a good reason - it is currently shrinking and it's future
does not look that bright due to patent expiration.

I think a PE of 5 is unlikely with JNJ because they have multiple business
lines and a pretty good LT track record to adjust to changing conditions. On
the other hand, their growth going forward may be less than during the recent
decade because their pharma sector may not grow much at all and the rest cannot
pull the company enough forward to make up for lost momentum. However even if
JNJ were to trade at a PE of 9 in 10 years, i think the returns for JNJ will be
better.

The question is are they going to be good enough? I am shooting for double
digit total returns and I am not sure i will get this with JNJ. That's why i
don't own the stock right now.

Based on my comments here, and by you/others on Div. for Retire. thread, it
could very well be a low bar if it's the S&P that has to be beat. Let's see if
our stocks can just beat the S&P Utility Index or the DJ Utility Index going
forward. As we've noted, the utilities have beat the "best" 500 US growth
stocks ("apparent growth stocks"), the S&P -g-. over ten years and over shorter
periods too.
And those utilities provide us with dividends that increase as well.

* Recorded total adjusted net income and adjusted EPS of $1.7 million and

a net gain on FFAs of $1.3 million corresponding to the second quarter of 2010

Pretty good report.

They continue to expand their River Business.

From the report: "...In our River Business, we began operations at our new yard
which has already launched five jumbo tank barges which will commence service
in the third quarter and will continue to deliver new barges into our fleet on
a regular basis. We are pleased that our new 8,300BHP heavy fuel powered
pushboat Zonda I started service in May and that her operational performance
has exceeded expectations. Before year's-end, we expect three additional
re-engined pushboats to commence service and anticipate completing eleven units
by the end of 2011...".

Their offshore business should get traction when their new boats get placed in
service ( their offshore fleet is expected to double in size in the next two
years).

The next 24 months should see them growing earnings. Not too sure we will test
the highs from 2007 ($16.00/share-$25.00/share) but we should test the
$10.00/share - $15.00/share range if management can deliver on their multi-year
growth strategy. That's a 1-2 bagger from current levels.

listening to GFRE call. demand for bromine continues to be robust. 2nd quarter
they operated at 100% of capacity. normal capacity is 80% and that is what they
are at now. they renegotiated some contracts. they have seen some increase in
raw materials but they expect to transfer those costs to end users over time.
pesticide use increasing and so it for oil and gas industry. commercial
production of wastewater products is ahead of schedule and getting good
feedback. expect to contribute $10 million a year to revenues. So far I
continue to like what management is saying they dont seem to be overpromising
anything.
its real difficult to understand when the chinese guy is speaking english. ( i
suppose .47 will be the peak earnings quarter this year. but if they do even
.8* .47 or .38 for the next two quarters it still shapes up as a pretty good
year about
$1.46.) now it sounds like bla bla bla about additional acquisitions and
financing.

Q&A: Oppenheimer-
guidance-in light of strong second quarter why is full year guidance unchanged?
are you overly conservative or are you concerned about something?

expectation from future bromine pricing?

capacity of recent acquisition in current year?

we are always conservative. we think price will stabilize but there is
likelihood may increase higher. 75% capacity for rest of year. new acquisiton
will be on board end of august so capacity over 4 months will only be 18%.

what are market dynamics that caused stablizing at 19,000?

a little more supply, prices dont go up non stop they go up and then correct.

potential for increase in 2nd half?

increasing demand, 2nd quarter if usually peak season for production so there
is more supply in 2nd quarter than rest of year.

govt restrictions on bromine pricing. chance that govt will issue more licenses
to increase supply?

always possible govt will change policy. but most likely to issue to existing
players. so they continue their m& a policy.

flooding impact? not affected.

chemical production? how much bromine used internally?

8%.

STRENGTHENING RD EFFORT?

very low right now. target goal is 1.5-2% of revenues.

big market for pollution control? mercury? nothing specific though.

breen murray-

80% utilizaton rate not much more than that is possible. to raise margin they
need cost control.

rengotiation of contracts? what changed?

avg. 19,000 a ton.
is that secure for the remainder of the year?

2pv10 = US$7.73 or US$476M. ("NiMin reserves are from Huddleston & Co., Inc. NI

These dinky e&p companies always seem to be updating their balance sheet for
shares or debt. As of July, I believe there are 83M fully-diluted shares,
current cash of C$19M and debt of C36M.

NNN.To stock price is C$1.02, so enterprise value might conservatively be
viewed as $1.02x83M, -19M + 36M = $102M

So as I view it, the gas/oil asset (apparently 96% oil) to enterprise value is
476/102 or over 4:1. That's a pretty tough ratio to beat given the several
other e&p stocks I am looking at and buying.

Nimin Energy: I see I'll need to learn quite a bit to understand this
business/industry. Yes, great ratio of reserves to market cap, but negative
earnings and cashflow, lots of new stock and debt, short corporate history. Not

Hi Dan -

I too am learning how to value these companies. I am starting a few very small
tracking positions in a few of these companies specifically GMXR and MHR.

MHR had a conference call today explaining the state of their business. They
also have loads of new financing to carry them through until they can get their
cash flow from operations (wells & pipe lines) to cover their on going
expenses.

Here is another more conservative way to value these marginal earners:
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26759467

My thought is to buy a basket of these companies that have proven reserves "in
the ground" and/or own land where other drillers have shown proven reserves.

The bulk of my investing dollars in this sector are with the larger
integrators, pipeline gathering & distribution MLPs and shippers (tankers & LNG
ships).

I am looking for dividends and monthly income (MLPs provide good income)and
capital appreciation. The integrators have had good capital appreciation over
the years but I believe my small basket of e&p companies can eventually provide
a better capital appreciation kicker to my portfolio.

You asked for the highest reserves to market cap. Now I infer you also want
these high reserve to market cap companies to also show positive cash flow and
earnings, have no or not too much new stock or debt, and not have too short a
corporate history. Yes! I want all that too.
You only left out that the company should also pay a dividend and have insider
buying. Frosting on the cake would be a rumor that Buffett was buying in the
area. Where are all these companies? -g-

NimIn.TO - what makes me a bit suspicious about the NPV calculations is that
they value probable reserves almost the same way than probable.
For example in the Cooperate summary, they value the 11.9M BOE at 215M$
(18.1$/BOE) and the 27.9M$ proved+ probable reserves as 476M$ (17.1$/BOE). So i
wonder if they include the Capex that is surely needed to develop probable
reserves into proved ones. Last time I checked, oil does not bubble out of the
ground when you put a stick in the ground <g>.
http://www.niminenergy.com/i/pdf/NiminPresentation.pdf

Just for a comparison, TOT is valued at 12.5$/ BOE proved reserves and about
1/2 that for proved plus probable. Both are as different as companies can be,
of course, so it is not a valid comparison. Even though this sort of tells me
that if I apply the same logic that E&P apply to value their reserve base, TOT
would be worth 80$/share, which i would gladly take.

Oh yes, have to be suspicious of all these companies' npv calculations. As
stated previously. Some are done before tax, some are done without excluding
working interest of partners, and some weight oil vs gas.

With NNN, they say in their recent fact sheet,they have:

1.9 MMB oil proved developed producing, 9.1 MMB oil total proved

14.8 MMB oil proved + probable

For discussion, let's ignore "probable" and also the other category of
"possible" which the company doesn't mention.

From my prior post, I figured NNN.to is a $102M enterprise value company.

I know there are lifting costs, royalty or other taxes, and a time value of
money (npv stuff). Roughly though, I ask myself, if I could buy the whole
company and get 9 million barrels of proved oil for sure, forgetting possible
and probable, what would I be willing to pay for the whole company, given that
I might be able to sell each barrel of the proven oil that I pull up, for maybe
the going-rate, say $75? Okay, each person might have his/her own price per
barrel they might be willing to pay. For me, If I paid $25/bbl for 9.1 million
barrels of oil, or $227M (which is more than double the current enterprise
value) for the company, I figure--
that somewhere between $25 per barrel bought and $75/bbl per barrel sold, there
"ought"* to be enough money left after paying the lifting costs per barrel,
paying the taxes, and after allowing for the time value of money that it'll
take to extract that oil, to leave me with some profit. And icing on the cake,
there's still money maybe that could be made from developing the "probable" and
"possible" reserves. And they don't have to be "developed" to be valuable: If
further exploratory drilling can allow the evaluators to shift some "possible
reserves" to "probable", that increases 2pnpv values (if that were of
importance to potential stock buyers).

*I say "ought", but I don't really know. I'll bet I'm right, but for my typical
very small-size position. I'm not so confident that I'd buy the whole company
at current price, even if I could afford to.

Anyway, this is another way I'm looking at the company -- Perhaps though, I'm
just trying a bit too hard to justify my position and my posts. Stock does look
good to me though --- one of many I'm buying. And I could be very wrong. Easily
if oil prices drop back to lows we've seen in past couple years.

Added GLW after couple months pause. CEU, HRBN and NEWN reported tolerable but

You are 100% correct. TIP does not fully protect from interest rate risk, since
the interest rates are not fully correlated with inflation. In other words,
interest rate could rise to 6-7% with almost no inflation.

On the other hand TIP maturity distribution is pretty even on the maturity
scale. So it's not like buying 15 or 30 year bonds flat. :) Short term
maturities is a protection against interest rate risk. Again, this is only
partial protection and you pay for it with lower yields.

What I like best about NNN is the long life reserves, i.e. 30 years, in WY. If
NNN is right, their WY P&P wells have a payback period of only 9 to 14 months.
So the well capex is fully paid back in first year and NNN then has average of
30+ bpd for the next 10+ years per review of their decline chart.

If these NNN projections are accurate, then NNN share price is a bargain if you
believe price of oil will average over $75 for the next 10 years.

But NNN will have to meet its $950K per well capex budget and these wells need
to hit their initial production targets of 80-95 bpd.

My understanding is NNN will have press release within next 3 weeks to announce
the initial production rates on their first 2 to 3 wells and the related capex
$ of these wells. The first 2 wells are being fraced this week and possibly the
third when its drilling is complete.

Thus, we will know soon whether NNN is meeting its projections. And NNN will be
completing 2 new WY wells each month per their projections (these are shallow
wells that can be completed within 11 days if everything goes perfectly). NNN
will be cash flow and EPS positive in the near future if it meets these
projections.

Place your bets and take your chances at your own risk..., but investors will
know one way or the other within 3 weeks.

I think inflation protection will help a little but overall TIPs could get very
hurt in a rising rate environment. To me the risk/reward is not compelling. You
are getting paid next to nothing right now, while still taking a fair amount of
interest rate risk. If inflation is a worry, I'd rather own commodity-sensitive
stocks than TIPs.

If you think 6-7% interest rates are possible (especially on the short rates),
I'd recommend a floating rate security like GYB (Goldman trust preferred)
trading at 17.92 with 4.69% current yield and 5.60% yield to maturity (the
later assuming libor stays below the floor rate, the yield would increase if
short rates rise).

As for me, I'm not ready to pull the trigger back into floating rate. I'd
rather wait until it looks like short-term rates might start turning up.

Their gas gathering business Endeavor Gathering an undiscovered gem with value
close to $2.00/share.

Re: GMX Resources Inc. (GMXR)

Doubled my position in GMXR. In reviewing their annual report and their most
recent 8K. I discovered that they have a Gas Gathering subsidiary called
<u>Endeavor Gathering </u>. I calculate their ownership interests in this
subsidiary company to be worth $54 Million or $1.91/share (based on what KME
pais in 12/2009). Their Gas Gathering assets subject to depreciation is valued
at $60 Million or $1.28/share BV. This subsidiary is also spinning off income
(40% they share with Kinder Morgan Energy - KME) equivalent to $0.21/Mcfe. It
still has capacity to grow which will help the company reduce their operating
lease expenses.

From their most recent 8K report: - lease operating expenses are down 21% to
$0.71/Mcfe Avg.

( Lease operating expenses of $0.52 per Mcfe and $0.71 per Mcfe for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2010, respectively, compared to $0.82 and $0.90
per Mcfe for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, respectively.

These monies went to Kinder Morgan Energy for their 40% interest in the Gas
Gathering Business.

"...Decreases in 2010 LOE offset by $0.14 per Mcfe and $0.12 per Mcfe for the
three and six months ended 2010, respectively, attributable to net income of
the noncontrolling owner in our gathering assets...."

"...In controlling operating expenses, we reduced our lease operating expense
on a per Mcfe basis. Lease operating expense per Mcfe for the first six months
of 2010 was $0.71 compared to $0.90 in the first six months of 2009, a decrease
of 21%...."

Gas Gathering Business valued at $90 Million (Dec 2009).
Kinder Morgan Energy bought a 40% interest in the new company Endeavor
Gathering for $36 Million (equity sale).

Gas Gathering
We have, through our majority-owned subsidiary, Endeavor Gathering, gas
gathering lines and compression equipment for gathering and delivery of natural
gas from our core area that we operate. <u> As of December 31, 2009, we had
invested approximately $60 million in this gathering system, including the
purchase of compressors and pipe inventory, which consisted of approximately
120 miles of gathering lines and
compressors that collect and compress gas from approximately 99% of our
operated gas production from wells in our core area. At year end 2009, this gas
gathering system had takeaway capacity of 115 MMcf per day compared to our year
end gross production volumes of 37.3 MMcfe per day.</u> This system enables us
to improve the control over our production and enhances our ability to obtain
access to pipelines for ultimate
sale of our gas.

================================================================

This stock has a very large short interest so buy with care and set your price
limits. MHR is also establishing a gas gathering business subsidiary. I believe
they are also talking with Kinder Morgan Energy to structure the same type of
deal that GMXR did in December 2009.

If someone expects rates to go up to 6-7%, there is really no good play IMO.
Stocks might be a partial play, but it's not given they will go up or down as
rates go to 6-7. Bonds will go down. Commodities - who knows. Cash would not go

re INTC -
>>What was Intel thinking? do tech companies just get bored?<<
They don't get bored - they come up with "strategic visions" or something like
that.

Here is how it could work: management goes to a summer retreat to discuss
cooperate strategy. They come up with "3 Themes" which they give a fancy name.
I took this out of the press release about the acquisition:

 Inside Intel, the company has elevated the priority of security to be on par
with its strategic focus areas in energy-efficient performance and Internet
connectivity.

To top it off, top management set's an incentive goal to achieve a certain % of
revenues to business lines related to the business line "Internet connectivity"
and "security" that they decided are important. let's say get 10% in 5 years.
Tall order without acquisitions if you have no clue about security at all. So
let's buy something....

I'll continue to hold GMX to see what they do with their assets.

MHR. Yeah, this one gets a lot of attention on SI, esp. 50% gains thread where
many people seem to have made a lot of substantial money on it already.
Continual posting on it on SI seems to reinforce its attractiveness and bring
in more people. Very little discussion on price vs. value by numbers though.
One guy on SI who made a decent effort to analyze the financials got it wrong,
imo, by focusing on the earnings statement rather than the balance sheet. (It
seems to me acquirers, managements, or analysts generally don't value these
dink e&p companies on earnings -- generally because there are no earnings.)
I've looked at MHR's presentation numbers, and here again, it seems to me again
a case of no consistency in how e&p's report nav. Perhaps I've missed
something, but I read that the company reports only proved reserves and in a
very conservative way. Kudos to them, but solely on the numbers it shows, the
company isn't undervalued as I see it. However, there are proved AND probable
(and possible) reserves, and it seems to me if probable reserves were included
(which numbers I do include in my valuation when I see them), the company is
undervalued.
Two other aspects: where the company is now, and where it's going. One standard
metric for evaluating a producing company is on flowing barrels of oil. (That
might include oil equivalents. I'm just going to ignore gas production though,
because I haven't yet figured out how to price it. And with the gas glut, all
these companies seem to be focusing on oil production.) It seems the number
varies that people will have for valuing a "flowing barrel"; I've got my number
which I use across all these companies. By that, MHR is overvalued on current
production.
Which brings the second aspect: where the company is going. MHR is going to
increase, substantially, its production. (more barrels flowing) It has the land
and the financing to do this. Management might be capable. Perhaps more
significant, the top guy has a history of creating value AND monetizing it to
the benefit of all his stockholders (previous company).

I want to say that for me, the land holdings are most significant. Not finding
the words now to articulate reasons why...I can't put numbers up to justify any
reasons. I'm buying some stuff on valuation (as I view valuation), and I'm also
buying more stocks just based on a bet on the land that they have -- that the
land contains lots of oil. There are some shales I particularly like that I
don't see discussed at all on SI. Some are mentioned very little (Bakken/Three
Forks) This "non-discussion" is very positive imo. (If the oil guys on oil
threads or people on value threads don't talk about such shales, I assume it's
just generally of little interest or generally not yet known, and so early
enough to get in and build positions.) Anyway, MHR is in several of the areas I
am buying into. So that's a big positive for me about MHR. Otoh, for me, I see
other e&p companies that are in the same areas as MHR, which seem to me to be
at a cheaper valuation than MHR. Jmo, of course. I'm accumulating a small
position in GEOI as one. (Added a little today.)

Hi Paul - How's your turnover rate going this year? I did a quick calculation
and I need to harvest more of my profits and work on turning the portfolio %
over. I am only at 12% for the year and have a target of a minimum of 33%.

The one big problem I have is that with many of my buys over the last 18-24
months, I was able to acquire some good value buys at a low cost basis that pay
good dividends. I need the dividend income and hate to sell as it will be
difficult to find equivalent dividend payers.

The positive of having a set turnover target is it makes you book a portion of
your profits and get the money working in new sectors. If you do not do this,
the portfolio eventually gets concentrated in one or more specific sectors.

Therefore, this quarter I am going to try to be aggressive on selling a good
percentage of my winners. Many of them are close to fair value but I could make
an argument on holding them longer too. I do continue to harvest my losses so
that will help bring my average cost down too.

My strategy is to move the money into the new sectors I have on my watch list
(a lot of MLP's, E&P and natural resource companies) and book a good portion of
my REIT preferred stock and utility profits that paid off in spades during the
2008-20099 melt down.

I guess it is a good problem to have. Since I have so many stocks, after my
planned sales, it should not impact my core positions that much and I will
still have pretty much the same sectors covered but in a slightly different
percentage.

re MDU, WMB @18.55$ - if you like MDU you may like WMB too. I bought some
shares today. WMB is a Midstream NG E&P hybrid and it's better run than EP
(closest peer). I do admit of liking the Midstream part (which pays the bills
right now) much more so than the E&P. Anyways, they spent big bucks in the
Marcellus share (100,000 Acres) in both their E&P and Midstream arm.

Their earnings forecast reaching to 2012 shows a huge range for their earnings
- 1.4-3.35$. Well at least they are honest - much of the outcome will depend on
NG prices, I assume.

From an asset point of view, they control 4.8 TCF of NG proved and 14.8 TCF
potential. Current EV is 18B$. Their Midstream operation generates 1.5B$ in
operating profit, so I think it's worth more than 10B$ (very conservative) - if
you subtract that, the E&P part of the operation looks fairly cheap.
