Gizwick like you I took advantage of the peanut shortage with JBSS last year. I
sold half on a double and let go of the rest when the stock's price matched its
all time historical high P/S level at $19 1/2.

I researched MGPI really in depth to see if the company had favorable hedges in
place and to my knowledge MGPI has been on a JIT inventory system for some time
with no forward contracts and had no operating advantages. Historically, the
company's pricing follows the commodity price but the company has a much
different look. Honestly, I am unsure of its future pricing power of its liquor
operation once commodity prices fall. If you believe liquor prices can hold up
under an anticipated lower cost structure on next year's harvest MGPI should do
very well but I think you would gain much more operating leverage with CEDC if
you believe in a higher pricing environment can be maintained under a future
lower cost structure.

The 2 stocks I really think are good values right now with decent earnings
momentum behind them are COBR and CALVF. CALVF has an exteremely high ROE and
low BV and believe has goods to be the next Mart Resources if you can convince
the investing public to put pressure on management to pay a recurring high
yielding dividend in the 20% range which they can easily able to afford .
Unfortunately, there is absolutely no consensus on the message boards over this
issue and the stock is stuck. COBR is now in its strongest seasonal period and
currently the stock is a Piotroski 9.

The Private Equity is included in the common stock (BX). I haven't done
anything research that would demonstrate the correlation between any of BX's
activity with the stock price. I like their market plan because they can move
into different asset classes depending on the prevailing market conditions.

This is an excerpt from their conference call regarding PE:

<blockquote> I'd like to step back for a moment and remind everybody about our
approach to Private Equity and the power of the model over time, which we've
demonstrated repeatedly over the past 26 years. We approach all of our
investment opportunities as a problem-solver, not a passive investor like
people in the public markets. In Private Equity, this means partnering with a
management team to identify and correct underperforming assets, working with
the team to inject capital and provide expertise in support of growth or hiring
an outstanding manager to build the company from scratch. Depending on the type
of asset, the region and market conditions, this could take 4 to 5 years or
could take longer. Given the long-term nature of our funds with their typical
10-year maturities, sometimes 12, we are in no rush to sell. And when the time
is right, we'll realize the value we've created and built over several years
for both our limited partners and our publisher holders.

A more extreme example of this is Universal Orlando, the giant theme park down
in Orlando, Florida, which we sold to a strategic buyer last year after holding
it for 11 years. We completed this sale at a multiple of original invested
capital of 3.2x our money and at 16% IRR. I remember one point in time after
this investment was made, we had this investment marked at only 10% of original
cost. So from that mark until we sold it, this investment was only up 32x. So,
this is just to counsel you to not get overly focused on any of these marks
from quarter to quarter and recognize that we're in the business of building
this massive value, which, over time, we can pick our moment to exit and
realize on that.

Looking at our historical exits in general, our average exit price is 20% to
25% higher than the prior quarter's mark to market as we cannot factor things
in on our accounting treatment like acquisition premiums into our valuations.
As such, you should expect sharply higher increases in value during periods of
greater realizations generally.

During the second quarter, challenging capital market conditions and ongoing
subdued M&A activity limited our opportunity for exits. One of our peers
announced the partial sale of a European drugstore business to a strategic
partner, which we believe is a good example of a 2007 buyout done at the
absolute top of the cycle that ended with a very favorable result that at other
times, as you were monitoring that investment, the market may have dismissed.
This is how our industry works and you should see more of this across the
sector as markets heal and M&A volumes improve.

For example, late in the quarter, we did sell a portion of our interest in
TeamHealth, which we had initially bought, brought public in late 2009. The
TeamHealth sale generated a multiple of investment capital of 3.1x our money
and a 19% IRR and that's $33 million distributable earnings contribution for
our public investors. Our patient capital and superior returns over time drive
our fundraising success. We have the largest pool of dry powder in the Private
Equity area available at $16 billion and there is a real advantage to this
scale and flexibility, allowing us to move in size and with certainty anywhere
in the world we see opportunities for value creation.

As a last note on our Private Equity business, as we announced yesterday, we've
completed the leadership transaction, transition begun a couple of years ago by
naming Joe Baratta, Head of Private Equity globally. Several of you met Joe at
our European Investor Day last year. We sent him to London a decade ago to help
launch our European business and he will return to New York next month.

<blockquote> so how can one not assign or attempt to assign a value multiple to

company should have positive earnings for the last 10 years. I (EKS$) say at
least 5 years. http://goo.gl/7escT

He likes to use TBV and not BV as BV includes Goodwill. Graham likes to use
last year's annual EPS (to arrive at a very conservative fair value amount). I
(EKS$) like to use the analysts average for next year's EPS to arrive at my
fair value number.

If you do this calculation, you will find several stocks that are selling below
this "fair value" calculation. That's what I have been using for quite
sometime. The difference between Graham's calculation and mine, is Graham uses
"historical" figures and the EKS $ uses a forward annual EPS estimate.

http://goo.gl/EFOIU
http://goo.gl/8dzqA

Check out http://goo.gl/PZu34 This is one I have recently added to my BUY list
on any move below $14.00/share. The EKS$ value is close to $22.00/share. In
this case I (EKS$) use the avg EPS estimate for 2013. Graham would use the
annual EPS for 2012 (or maybe an average EPS for the prior 2-3 years). The fair
value results range from $22.00/share - $26.00/share depending on the EPS
figure you use in the GN equation.

Regarding the "potential" you talk about, Graham really only looks at the past
for determining "fair value". He assumes that if the company has been in
business a long time (over 10 years), then it is well established, has constant
sales and margins and continues to build it's TBV organically (not by
acquisition). He also constrains his value model by no PE above 15 and only a
positive TBV. This number applies only to certain types of stocks in
combination with a number of other criteria. The complete Graham selection
procedure is much more elaborate.

I offer a yes, but.
The Graham formula (p. 185, Intelligent Investor) uses "book value". No
distinction being made between BV and TBV. Also, I've read that in some
instances Dr. Graham believed intangible bv should be valued more than tangible
because the tangible were assets that could easily be replicated by
competitors, but the intangible assets were not. (I assume like the value of a

Re CSX. - well, relative to UNP, CSX earnings look rather poor. CSX earnings
and revenues are stagnating, while UNP had 5% revenue and 15% earnings growth,
which is quite impressive. it might well be that UNP is worth the premium
valuation relative to CSX. The difference in growth rates is quite large but it
remains to be seen if, UNP can keep up the 15% earning growth that the analyst
consensus suggest. I think they will need to accelerate their revenue growth,
because 15% earnings growth and 5% revenue growth aren't likely in the longer
run.

Paul -

You make a good point on BV vs TBV but I have noticed that many of these
companies that grow by acquisition tend to accumulate too much goodwill. To me,
that goodwill is worth at most 50 cents on the dollar.

What's your opinion on a company's value where they have grown through
"organic" growth vs one that grows by acquisitions? I tend to favor those that
have grown organically and are still a small to medium size company as measured
by their market cap. I am not sure if Graham considered this in his valuation
criteria.

That's why I have developed a modified GN when I evaluate different value buys.
For me, Graham provides a good starting point but it is not perfect.

Regarding the "potential" of a company, I think Templeton appreciated this. He
always looked to companies to reinvet themselves. I am not sure how he
quantified this. Maybe he looked at the amount of their R&D investment. I do
know he valued a good management and that was measured by the company's past
performance. This is an important criteria I look at after I determine if the
stock is undervalued. I think INTC, GLW and MMM fit into this category.

If it comes down to equivalent value buys, I always try to select the one that
shows good innovation, coming out w/ new products and out-of-the-box ideas.

I'd prefer growing organically vs. through acquisitions. Otoh, if we're
opportunistic value buyers ourselves, then when value buys present themselves
to well-funded opportunistic managements, I can't fault them for being
acquirers of the entire company that's in their sights. I'm always a bit
apprehensive though when it seems like the acquiring company is buying because
they believe they can manage the business better than the insider management
who are already there.

<blockquote>If it comes down to equivalent value buys, I always try to select

I'll have to consider that. I believe I'm the opposite. Perhaps the geezer in
me. I prefer organic -- companies just growing by doing their own thing over
and over -- loan companies making more loans by opening branch offices; drug
companies continuing on their paths -- whether it's a generic road or a
specific disease or type of disease; aerospace companies continuing their
commerical/government design/manufacturing; fertilizer companies making their
product more convenient/cheaper; etc. Not to say I won't buy innovative
companies with their new products -- e.g. GLW. Just that my preference is not
to bet -- or only to bet a very little -- on some company's continued success
with new products or out-of-box ideas.

<blockquote>I understand attempting to predict the future based on past
results, yet the future is ever changing.</blockquote>Good point and here's how
Graham and Buffett differ at how they look at the ever changing future.

Graham's methods target that there is a market mispricing based on past ratios.
He was not a long term buyer. He set a price target based on this is what a co.
did and this is what it should be priced at and sold it when it met his price
target or if it did not meet his target, sold it after two years. I don't
understand Paul Senior's/thread moderator's method of selling based on instinct
if he is a true Graham investor. Graham had a specific target price and time
limit.

Buffett's methods differ because he said let's find a company that has done
well based on certain metrics and you know what, there's no way that anybody
can interfere with what this co. is doing and as long as they keep doing what
they are doing they will be successful because the product will alway be in
demand and because its too difficult for a competitor to enter the picture and
as long as they do what they are doing and the metrics that I look at don't
change, it's a hold.

And on another note, Ditch as you pointed out to me, we have exchanged thoughts
and ideas here for a very long time and I think you go under the radar as an
independent thinker. Thanks for this exchange and let's hear more about where

ABT price change today. I see it as profit taking based on the recent run up.

ABT has a fantastic new product pipeline and should recover from this setback.

I also look at the chart and see almost a gap fill that will likely fill
tomorrow. Short term is stable.

There's a lower gap that will also be filled because ABT is selling at a
premium to historic ratios. Short term, ABT will recover from today's drop, but
there's weakness going further out.

When everything is going up, let's look for what is not substainable. When
everything is going down, let's look at what should not have followed the

2. If the business improved substantially over some year or two time period,
and it wasn't just that the market recovered or the stock got viewed more
favorably, I can't believe Dr. Graham would be so fixated he'd just
mechanically sell because it reached a specific target price and time limit he

Your own words for selling decision have been posted many times. Here's an
example:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=28464661

On Graham's strategy to sell after two years, there are many references. Here's
one that's easy to post and verify, from THE GRAHAM INVESTOR website:

<blockquote>http://www.grahaminvestor.com/2010/03/05/on-selling-some-thoughts-o
-when-to-fold-em/

"Ben Graham variously suggests keeping stocks for 2 years, and/or selling 50%
of a holding."</blockquote>(Please don't get hung up on the and/or)

Graham bought stocks that were undevalued based on his metrics. Logically if
the stock gained in price, or as you put it, the P catches up to the E, then
why would Graham hold on?

<blockquote>Buying and Selling is strictly based on what the stock is selling
for below or above fair value

Here's another link on Graham/When to sell:

<blockquote> When to Sell? In general, Ben Graham didn’t like to take any
chances holding stocks that were valued at or above intrinsic value. Therefore
he recommended selling a stock after about 1 year or when it appreciates 50%,
whichever comes first.

This quote comes from an interview with Graham published in the Financial
Analyses Journal:
 <blockquote>The investor should have a definite selling policy for all his
common stock commitments, corresponding to his buying techniques. Typically, he
should set a reasonable profit objective on each purchase--say 50 to 100 per
cent--and a maximum holding period for this objective to be realized--say, two
to three years. Purchases not realizing the gain objective at the end of the
holding period should be sold out at the market.

http://www.bylo.org/bgraham76.html </blockquote>
This quote comes from an interview with Graham published in the September 20,
1976 edition of Medical Economics.
<blockquote>"Max holding period of 2 years"
"http://blog.empiricalfinancellc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/postdata1.pdf

from the time of purchase, sell it regardless of price.”
http://www.frankvoisin.com/2011/04/28/backtesting-ben-grahams-strategy/
</blockquote>

I think this is a website you use:

<blockquote>Graham further recommended building a portfolio of 30 diversified
stocks meeting such criteria. His study employed strict sale rules that
required selling the stocks after a 50% gain or after a two year holding
period, whichever came first.
http://www.gurufocus.com/news/8758/benjamin-grahams-lost-magic-formula-in-1976
</blockquote> This is from the American Association of Individual Investors
website:

<blockquote>Sell DisciplineGraham suggested that investors set a profit
objective when buying stocks, and he thought that a 50% profit goal should
provide good results. Under this rule, a stock is sold once it is up 50%.
Furthermore, a time limit must be set for a stocks maximum holding period in
advance. Graham’s research indicated that a holding period of two to three
years worked out best. If you establish a maximum two-year holding period, you
would sell a stock after two years if it did not meet its profit objective.

Well I do sell after a time of no stock or business improvement. Generally I'll
try to hold 2-3 years. I believe one thing Buffett learned from Graham was not
to just sell because some arbitrary % gain was achieved. Dr. Graham benefited

on 50% gain, he wouldn't have.

My sells aren't based on any metric? This which I posted earlier, might be

<blockquote>Looking at a sample of my 50 past gain sales, it looks like I sold
3 (6%) because I primarily just got tired of holding shares; there were 2 (4%)
takeovers; I made 16 (32%) sales for a combo of reasons -- FEAR of losing a
profit played a part; and 29 (54%) primarily because my expectations were met
(revert-to-mean; stock price made metrics unattractive). </blockquote>
<blockquote>how do you defend using instinct as a reason to sell and call it

characterized some of my selling behavior as fear. When my fear gets the better
of me, I'll sometimes sell or sell down, regardless. Good for others if they
are not influenced by this emotion and have the confidence/conviction of their
ideas. How do I defend fear as a reason to sell? Sometimes as the cliche goes,
your first sale is your best sale. Just because something appears to be a value
investment and I call it a value investment, doesn't mean it is or if it is,
that I have to own it. I'm comfortable being uncomfortable with many of my

Heads up on HDDs....

Marvell cuts sales target on weak PC market

Dylan McGrath10/19/2012 2:10 PM EDT

SAN FRANCISCO—Several analysts downgraded Marvell Technology Group Ltd.'s stock
Friday (Oct. 19) after the chip firm cut its third quarter sales outlook and
announced the departure of its chief financial officer.

http://www.marvell.com/ (Santa Clara, Calif.) is the latest chip vendor to
announce lower than expected quarterly sales amid macroeconomic sluggishness
and weak PC demand. Marvell has heavy exposure to the PC market as a leading
supplier of chips for hard disk drives (HDDs).

Marvell said it now expects net revenue for its fiscal third quarter, which
closes Oct. 27, to be between $765 million and $785 million, down from a
previous forecast of $800 million to $850 million. The midpoint of the new
sales target would represent a decline of 5 percent compared to the previous
quarter and 18 percent compared with the year ago quarter.

"The continued slowdown in the global economy during the third quarter is
resulting in a weaker PC market than previously anticipated and thus lower
demand from our storage HDD customers," Sehat Sutardja, Marvell's chairman and
CEO, said in a statement.

Sutardja said Marvell's revenue from the solid-state drive, networking and
mobile markets are tracking in line with prior expectations. But he added that
business visibility remains low headed into the fourth quarter, which is
traditionally softer.

Craig Berger, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets, said in a report circulated
Friday that he believes HDD shipments will fall by more than 10 percent in the
third quarter and fall again in the fourth quarter. Berger also cited an
expected poor reception to Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system in coming
months.

"Clearly weak global demand, the Win8 production/purchasing 'air pocket,' and
smartphone tablet cannibalization are affecting PC shipments, with any 2013
recovery seeming of questionable magnitude for now," Berger wrote. He said 40
to 45 percent of Marvell's business is exposed to the PC market.

I did add to MN today, which is trading a bit above the 2% AUM metric you
stated. My notes state ~90M effective shares outstanding (yahoo states a 13.5M
shares but those represent only a minority stake in the operating sub); revenue
~0.75% of AUM with a 45% operating margin. AUM has expanded rapidly but, has
stalled this year, which I assume has been putting pressure on the stock. Since
asset manager don't really need capital to expand their business (contrary to
banks or insurance companies), the business can have fantastic economics.

Compared to MN, WHG has 0.55% of AUM as revenue and a lower operating margin,
but I do give you that they have been expanding their AUM YOY. The PE is about
15-17x, which is a little bit stretched imo, and not in the buy range for me.
Might be a nice buyout candidate, if they are willing to sell out, but that is
not something, I'd base my investment on.

I regard MN as a nice dividend stock, that has a good chance of growing the
business as well over time.

The problem with JNS is that they continue to loose assets and that also

this is just a deteriorating business. I think they are getting killed by the
move to ETF and/or low cost providers like Vanguard. Unless you can demonstrate
performance, have a niche (like TRowePrice with 401k's), or well performing
funds like MN or American Fund, i feel that many asset managers will loose a
lot of business due to these secular trends. Certainly JNS and LM come to my

MOG-A @37.13$ - upon further study, I decided to take a small position in
MOG-A. I like the consistent growth pattern they have shown over the years
(10%+ with a mix of self financed acquisitions and organic growth) and the fact
that this company has a really low profile in the investment world apparently -
very little analyst research and very little recognition in investment
newpapers or blogs. i believe one of the reasons is that the company is
essentially controlled by employees:

Hi Rick. ISSI has made a couple of more recent purchases than the one you

Xin.

Anyone still tracking this one? The stock keeps rallying. The recent property
buys in the US and Beijing make it more likely IMO the stock is legitimate, but
I think the recent move is on the heels of the ALN and YONG going-private
transactions. Some other dodgier Chinese stocks are up as well on the news.

I sold a little more today as the stock is in the mid 3's. It seems like hype
and momentum are starting to pick up in the stock (not my favorite price
movers), but I still own a core position as I still believe the stock is cheap.

At this point, I believe operational risk outweights fraud risk for Xin, as
they are moving outside their wheelhouse. By the way, several were warning me
about China when I invested in this one. I appreciated the warnings, but since
the slowdown in China is news basically only to people hiding under a rock, I
thought those problems were already amply priced into the stock.

Of course I'd prefer to buy an American stock this cheap, but none were

Re WDC - 10% tax rate on profits per their own earnings report. They must be
really good at moving their economic profits to tax havens. All industrial
countries that consume drives (USA, Japan, Europe, China) and countries that
produce drives (China, Thailand) have higher tax rates. So I am guessing they
have some offshore mailbox office in a tax haven and owns all the IP and
patents and hence is the "source"of their profits. How else is it possible to
have an overall tax rate that low if you produce and sell your products in
countries with much higher tax rates?

Folks get haunted by tax authorities if they move to another state from let's
say california to Nevada. Who is haunting these companies? The tax authorities
should have a look at where the real economic profits are made. My
understanding is that it is simply tax evasion, if I design a legal construct
just for the matter of tax evasion (example would be to have a mailbox adress
in Nevada, while I work in California). Why is this possible on a grand scale,
while the little guy is haunted for doing the same? This looks like tax fraud
in plain sight to me.

before taxes was 8.3% in 2012 compared to 6.9% for 2011. The differences
between the effective tax rate and the U.S. Federal statutory rate are
primarily due to tax holidays in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand that expire at various dates through 2025 and the current year
generation of income tax credits. As of June 29, 2012, we had a recorded

Hi Jurgis -

I continue to hold a large position in GSTpA (No. 4 in the portfolio) w/ an avg
cost around $19.00/share. I am not adding to the shares just to keep my
exposure low. The company did say the las suit was w/o merit (what do you
expect them to say). From what I have read, there was another company w/ first
right of refusal to do the JV deal with GST rather than CHK. Worst case would
be some sort of payoff to other company to go away.

No way is the potential claim at $100M as the deal is collateralized by the
valuable land that GST owns.

A very large soverign funds owns shares of GST common (a main reason I bought
the preferred) and I believe they also hold some Notes so they have a vested
interest to see that GST is defended in this suit. The Asian Soverign Fund has
in the past gobbled up other similar E&P companies so there is always a chance
they take the company private too.

These preferreds are thinly traded so there has been sellers but w/ much less
of the volume from when the initial suit was announced. 211K shares vs 27K
shares today. I am watching the news and volume and may add shares and then
sell in 31 days so as to reduce my cost basis. For now, just watching.

The positive is these shale properties are large NG producers and NG prices are
30% higher than last year. The historical trend is that prices will probably
move higher back to historical levels. If so, GST properties become more
valuable.

Let me know what you decide.

For the EKS$ value I used the analyst 2013 avg estimate of $1.59/year (which is
their best consensus guess for 2013 EPS). Using that number yields an EKS$ fair
value of $21.81/share.

I would not think that the analysts would include one time tax gains and/or any
other one time gains in their estimates. The thing that attracted me to this
investment are their high margins form the (1) leases and (2) the technicians
that provide the professional services. I am still researching the company to
see if they can sustain these annual revenues and/or have "organic" growth
opportunities in (1) the sector and (2) perhaps other markets. If so, their
business model is sound and BV should grow accordingly.

GLW@12.12$. joined you in GLW and bought a starter in GLW. I see signing up a
new customer for LCD glass and the growing revenues for the Gorilla glass
(specialty materials) as positives, that seemed to get drowned out. Certainly
the stock is cheap but it will take a while to realize the value here.
Also bought a starter in APA at 82.25$ and CSX again (forgot to close a GTC
order actually) at 20.7$.

I have looked at NSC, which is a close peer to CSX. Both face the same
headwinds from the shrinking coal transport business, but CSX had their cost
under control, while NSC had not. Looking back, NSC was a way better managed
railroad compared to CSX but CSX has been catching up and now is performing
better. I think that NSC has a management problem and unless something changes,
they will continue to underperform most likely. They certainly have
underperformed since the great recession (since i have been watching the stock)
when they failed to benefit as much from the economic recovery as they could
have. Right now, it seems that CSX trades at a very similar valuation to NSC
(P/S, EV/EBITDA P/E), so it's just that the traditional premium to CSX is gone.
With CSX showing better momentum and execution, I think this stock is the
better buy, even after NSC's drop today.

APA is probably pressured over uncertainty over their assets in Egypt. So far
however, In have not heard anything that let's me believe that the new
government has done anything, that would impair APA operations there.

OT? - OK, double bottom is in. I capitulate. There are tons of people around me
who suddenly are buying tablets or are interested in them. Maybe this is the
last wave of laggards and PCs will rebound, but perhaps this is the Main street
(using Gorilla Gaming terminology) and PCs are done/dead. It's still not clear
to me why people do it (since for me personally tablets are not useful) and
whether they use the purchased tablets much or at all, but currently there's a
clear (faddish?) wave.

I'm not going to sell my PC stocks right now. MSFT and INTC still have a chance
for the post-PC markets although I am less convinced about INTC and I may
consider selling the stock. DELL and WDC are smallish positions. Both are still
very cheap, so I won't sell now. But I don't plan to add to any of these
either.

Disclaimer: Might change my mind at any time. :)

Yeah, I thought on playing SSD theme, but I got whipsawed from SNDK. I am
concerned that this will be the new HDD-like battleground: tons of companies

Samsung is highly recommended, so clearly there are heavyweights in the space.

Wow, I haven't looked at OSG in a while. Took a little January pop off the
table earlier in the year around 14 for a couple bucks on a trade, but never
expected it would get so bad. It was a questionable hold and a quick trade at
best for me. Too much debt.

They have a huge operation and a big fleet like they have costs to much to run
in bad times for shipping industry. They must have massive Overhead.

It will be interesting to see what happens with the Co.

PS: Haven't posted in a good while. Had some medical issues and have not been
very active in the market this year. But I still hold a few and MHRD is the
largest holding of the lot. When you aren't that active, at least divs help.

I also hold some SIMO - recently clocked and not good, but I'll stay for some
kinda bounce I hope. Seemingly way overdone on the downside based on earnings,
but maybe I just don't have the foresight into the developing slowdown in
growth there. But I don't like selling into panic dumping. What a range today.
TRN, ZEUS, RELL, are others among a very limited portfolio right now. I'm down
a few pennies on RELL, but the others hang on for thin gains as of now.

Coal from the powder river in Wyoming can be produced for ~10$per short ton of
thermal coal. It is mined in an open pit. Coal from Virginia is mined used
underground mining and costs many times more. It is of higher quality (less
volatile, higher BTU per ton). I think you could get a good reference of east
coal thermal coal in ANR's 10k or so, but i know for sure that they will never
be able to mine a short ton for 10$/ton, it will be more like 30$ or
thereabouts.

What you have to consider is the total of mining and transportation cost
however, so it is not as simple as just looking at mining cost. If I move a
short ton of coal over several thousand mines to the point of consumption, the
transportation cost will be many times the mining costs.

Jurgis,

PCs are not going anywhere IMO. I am buying a tablet but for pleasure and
reading. I like to read in bed and the laptop is not convenient for this.
Whenever you need a lot of processing power you need a PC, or lots of typing.
Half of Dell's revenue comes from services. I am going to start selling put
options on Dell and IBM very soon. I think IBM is a company with a very strong
moat (companies with AS400 servers that are not even thinking to convert )
I think that soon the tablet will become an interface to the PC, something like
a display that you can use for the less processing intensive tasks.
Of course, being wrong so many times before, I will be very careful :)

Good Investing

Thanks for your response. I'm not questioning the difference in mining costs
for east coast vs west coast.

How does this difference in cost have any effect on NSC? NSC moves stuff and is
not a miner.

LAZ' conference call worth reading. They captured a good share of the reduced M
& A activity while displaying good management at increasing margins, reducing
costs and improving shareholder value.

I think that AAPL results confirm the theme. Their Mac shipments were so so.
Tablet/phone shipments were good, but there is expectation of slowdown or price
war in these areas too. So it may be prudent thing to sit out until situation
clears. However, with all three big contenders (MSFT, GOOG, AAPL) flush with
cash and FCF, I doubt that situation will clear quickly. IMHO there is going to
be a long drawn out war with a lot of casualties among smaller cos with weaker
business models and/or balance sheets.

NSC, is like all rails and they depend heavily on coal transportation for
revenues. So as coal mining moves west Paul S. & Clownbuck are saying that NSC
revenue will take a hit, since NSC rails are in the east.

But one think Clownbuck left out was that western coal mines are mostly on
federal land and it is being leased at favorable prices to mining companies
which is also lowering their costs.

Dennis. I understand and thank you.

Looking at issues that will impact coal demand besides the cost of mining are
http://www2.tricities.com/news/2012/oct/22/5/debate-over-coal-continues-rage-ar
2301298/ , http://www.zacks.com/stock/news/72498/railroads-hit-by-coal-concerns
, and http://www.eia.gov/coal/

My conclusion is that the future of U.S. coal production is dependent on
worldwide demand for coal. The
http://www.eia.gov/coal/production/quarterly/pdf/t13p01p1.pdf in meeting that
demand.

I am not a buyer here, but man, it's close to a buy for me. What's hurting NSC
is that demand for coal overseas is down due to slowing economies in Asia and
Europe. NSC is well positioned to gain from increased global demand when it
occurs and meanwhile has very limited downside. If it goes under 60 its a buy
for a short term trade and going forward the stock should be higher a year from
now than it is now.

I bought some NSH units today at 29.3$. The low distribution coverage for NS is
scary and can end badly for the General Partner NSH but I think the management
(which owns way more NSH than NS units) is pretty much stating that they want
to grow out of the whole by expanding, and that means issuing more NS units,
which benefits NSH (since NSH get's a share of NS cash flow). While NS cost of
capital is high, I think the lower GP cut of 25% of incremental cash flow
(compared to 50% for many other MLP's) makes the plan more manageable. Based on
recent experience, I think NS will increase unit count by 10% annually, which
will create a nice windfall for NSH. Somewhat risky, but there is a 7.3% yield,
with a good chance of 10%distribution growth, due to NS unit # increases from
secondaries.
