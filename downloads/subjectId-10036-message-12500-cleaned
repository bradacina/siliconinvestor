You summed up the VOIP situation pretty well. My only comment would be that
with the future of VOIP still so uncertain (who will win) CLRN is not a value
play. Value investing takes good visibility for earnings. You noted yourself
that it's a cloudy picture.

If you had posted that on the New Economy thread it would fit in perfectly.

Spekulatius, Roche could work out very well. I've occasionally looked at it,
and yet I always give up on the stock. I'm going to say it's totally my issue.

For a large multinational company they are, to me, just so
small-USA-stockholder unfriendly. I can't get quotes or background or charts
out of Yahoo, and I can't get any background info or trading history from my
other on-line sources including my broker. So I just say 'ridiculous' and pass.
You're the only source of info. on this stock in all of SI, from what I can
tell.

So I admire your perseverance. On the one hand, the difficulty that I and
others must have getting information could very likely mean that if there are
some price-to-value discrepancies, the people who do follow this company can
exploit them with less competition. (I note the stock is up about 10% since one
of your posts on SI in April.) On the other hand, I've got domestic small cap
stocks that trade infrequently, and yet I seem to be able to readily get all
the info. I need about each one of them.

I'm just too irritated that Roche makes my investigative process so difficult.

Grommit, I give up on trying to figure out NLY. Too tough for me.

I read where the CEO said, "We buy mortgage-backed securities issued by the
government, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and they're backed by
residential properties. We lever them up, and as a result we can make great
earnings for our shareholders."

They earn 12-15% on their equity. Apparently they have no long term debt (for
the lever), but they have issued more stock recently. (Issuing stock is, as you
likely know, common with REITS if they want to expand- since they have to pay
out almost all their earnings which deplete funds in their pot.) It's just not
comprehensible to me how NLY does so well. They seem to be a middleman so I'm
surprised they can earn so much - seems to be more than the people who front
the loans in the first place.

Dividend near 10%, stock at its highest level since company went public (4-5
years). Very good performance.

There's a ton of home mortgage refinancing going on now. The Marketwatch
article I see about NLY is titled "REIT Thrives in Low-Rate Environment." And
NLY does seem to be benefiting: since January, the stock regularly has been
making new highs.

For me, looking for an opportunity to capitalize on the boom, I choose the
title companies. Here I can more easily convince myself I might believe how
these businesses work and how they might benefit from these refinancings.

Regarding CNGR. LOL! That is one - or is it ten - heck(s) of a company. You buy
this stock, you go partners with used car dealers. And from Texas no less. They
and that are waaay scary to me. I'll always wonder if anything written by these
guys and their lawyers regarding the company or stock is anything like the way
their car/finance contracts reflect what their salespeople told their
customers. And a start up casino in El Salvador. What is that all about?

Rather than me dig deeper, I'll just defer to Timba's analysis or anyone else's
for that matter. And say that it's likely a reasonable thing to do for
you/others to put the stock on a watch list to see if a breakout occurs and if
it does, then spend some time to look again at the stock.

I do believe the pride/shame ratio is very low here. This stock - those people
- those businesses .... none of it is anything anyone would want to be
discussing at cocktail parties. I gotta chuckle/laugh/shake my head/ at anybody
who'd actually go ahead and buy this thing (assuming the person wasn't an
employee or relative).
========================================
OTOH, calming down a bit and looking just a tad closer at this ugly story...

MAYBE these Car Execs are doing what they know how to do. Buy something, tweak
it and hold it, and sell it. If it (a business) isn't working satisfactorily,
sell it. Wheel and Deal. Do what works. They know they are in a bunch of
disparate businesses that nobody can figure, so they've said they will work to
improve communications and work to improve stockholder value (by buying
shares).

This is a company (or companies -g-) selling at 3.75, 50c away from its low,
with a tangible book over $6. Price/sales about .1. P/e under 5: From their
March 9 report, "The overall performance of the Company during the first nine
months of fiscal 2001 suggests that this will be another record year in sales
and earnings." Well, they earned over $1.5/sh in each of the past two years.
The company looks (??) like it's showing positive free cash flow (I'm not sure
if I see this correctly.)

They've taken on a heap of debt: debt/eq - 3.1. Who knows how many bad loans
they've made to maybe goose earnings or how understated their allowance for
doubtful accounts is, or what will happen to overextended, marginal people who
will default as or if the economy worsens? The market certainly doesn't value
this business (CNGR) very highly.

Still, the company's core (90%) sales and financing activities are distributed
within multiple dealerships among several states, so that might balance some
default risks that are geographic specific.

I say the stock's a value buy. (Subject to my reading up further on their
businesses.) It would be suitable for someone with an 18-24 month perspective,
someone who would hold this stock in a diversified portfolio (i.e. who isn't
trying to make a fortune off this one stock), and someone, who, if he or she
goes to cocktail parties, doesn't talk about his/her specific stocks.

Spek, I don't follow the company but read the WSJ reference. I had a negative
reaction to the deal, as a possible sign of dumb management. P&G which is not a
stranger to the drug business chose to spend $4.95B for Clairol. BMY chose to
sell a business for $3B after taxes which an intelligent buyer (P&G) thought
would give a decent return on $4.95B. That means that BMY will have to earn one
hell of a return on the $3B to exceed the return it was (or in P&G's thinking
should have been) making on Clairol, in order to both make doing the deal
worthwhile and to make up over time the $2B just thrown away to Uncle Sam. I
doubt it can be done, or if it can, without taking more risk than retaining
Clairol represented. I am not impressed at all with this transaction based
solely on the info in that WSJ article.

Jeffrey, you're reaction to the WSJ BMY article is reasonable, but for BMY
followers, that sale has been long awaited. BMY's beauty-care operations which
include the hair-care line accounted for just 12% of BMY's sales and 5% of
pretax earnings (in '99, from the '00 Barron's report I am re-reading now). In
skimming the '00 BMY Annual report, I can't even find a reference to Clairol.
Only prescription drugs are discussed it seems. Clairol has stayed a part of
BMY for years because the father of a previous BMY Chairman/CEO (Richard Gelb)
founded the Clairol business.

I'll guess next up for sale (for maybe $5Billion) would be the medical device
business - another peripheral operation that according to analysts, has growth
rates and operating margins lower than pharmaceuticals.

BMY is slimming down and concentrating on its core business. The money they
receive from PG will likely be used for coventures or acquisitions (gotta keep
pushing product into that large BMY pharmaceutical salesforce). That cash
infusion lets BMY expand its possibilities and assuage investors' fears that
upcoming drugs sales/profits won't be enough to overcome those drugs coming off
patent. (That's "assuage" imo - those fears might still come true)

Maybe there'll be some stock buyback. (Debt's already at a low level, so I'll
guess they won't pay it down more.) The result should eventually make it easier
to compare BMY to other pharmaceutical companies and maybe improve BMY's
relative p/e.

I'd say the deal's good for PG too. They get an opportunity to bring fresh
perspective to Clairol - and they're already in the beauty business, get to use
their marketing and promotional expertise, and get to add sales to their top
line. PG sales have been relatively flat - relative, imo, to the earnings
increases they've reported in recent years. Increasing sales, even if they have
to buy those sales, is important - imo - if PG wants to be considered anywheres
near a 'growth' stock.

Company has essentially given up on 2001, but has high expectations for 2002.
With its new products and marketing effort, coupled with their opinion that,
"...2002 should be an excellent year for game controller companies since
supplies of all four new platforms should be plentiful by then" (5/14 PR), the
stock should do well in '02. I'll start a position now, because it's possible
that these stocks will move up as we get into the Christmas retailers' buying
season or the '01 Christmas season itself. I suspect it's possible that RADA
will move up in anticipation of good times to come. (Both RADA and RCOT have a
business in game controllers. RADA is big in hand held games; RCOT is not in
that business. RCOT is different from RADA in that RCOT is a

cgw1948:

Regarding CNGR....this company is the poster child for why I don't use Book
Value or Shareholder Equity for anything more than a chuckle!

I just did my analysis of the numbers for 1999, 2000, and the most recent 9
months. The Book Value went from $5.10 to $6.12 to $8.17 respectively. Nice
progression, no?

My NetNet valuation for that period, in the same order went from $1.19 to -$.81
to -$.61. That paints quite a different picture for me.

Although I am showing CNGR as wildly free cash flow positive, all of the
positive comes after adding back the money invested in the loan originations.
With a sub-prime lender, I don't feel comfortable doing that. Some lenders idea
of qualifying is to pass a mirror under the applicants nose to see if they're
breathing, if the mirror fogs, it's a done deal, if not, they might need a
co-signer. I suspect CNGR's underwriting standards may not be even this
stringent.

Easy to build up huge sales and originations and apparent profits when no one
gets turned down. You just write everybody who shows up. But GreenTree and
Flagship are testimony to the aftermath when the paper can't be sold and the
notes can't be collected upon.

No margin of safety for me in this one. I'll pass.

hi, rjm... i didn't check all your figures on BONT, but, yes it is priced
around 6x trailing earnings (50c), 4x forward earnings (75c). Given those
earnings and book value ($200m) the market has priced it at $1.69 to $4 for the
last 18 months. My inference is that the market does not think he is
able/willing to improve the valuation. Surely the business is worth far more
than $3, but there is no reliable way to get him out and improve the valuation
(if my inference is correct).

To his credit, his compensation is modest. Also, the book value is comprised

finance entities. According to one analyst, while accounting convention and
appearances indicate that originations sold to institutions thru packagers are
no longer a risk exposure for the originator, in reality, if there's a default,
the originator better step in and make it good if he wants to continue to sell
paper. If so, there could be a large unspoken off-balance-sheet liability for
future loan losses. Fast growth in subprime paper, that way exceeds industry
growth [car sales], is almost always a tipoff of relaxed credit standards. If

Starting a position in PHSY.

To understand these managed care companies really takes detailed investigation
and careful consideration of many external aspects which affect these
companies. Lawsuits, government reimbursement policies, internal accounting
policies for reimbursing physicians, and so on. For me though, understanding
the business is not a necessary condition before I might undertake an
exploratory position.

From what I can tell PHSY is not among the better managed or innovative
healthcare service companies. (That might be Trigon or Wellpoint). PHSY also
seems to be the subject of several negative analysts' comments.

Still price/sales is relatively low, expected p/e is low, there's a little
insider buying (not enough to give investors a buy signal though, imo), and
management seems to me to be trying to put its hands around the many problems
the company faces. For example, by turning away unprofitable business.

PHSY stock is very volatile. IF trading in future is similar to what we've seen
in the past six months, there might be opportunities to buy this stock at much
lower prices - as well as chances to sell profitably from today's level. Absent
news on the stock, my intent will be to try to add more if the stock drops
further. I'm also looking now at AET in this sector.

re: PHSY
I started a position at the open today. I would have been well served to wait,
but...

Management's EPS guidance (4/5/2001) is still 2.94 for FY12/2001. My
understanding is that this does not include approximately $2.50 in goodwill
amortization expense. If you add that back PHSY closed at a multiple of 3.5
times forward cash earnings.

If I am wrong about this, please let me know.... this is hard to believe for a
company with over $11 billion in revenue.

In exchange for that valuation, you have to accept the following "cons":
- large exposure to California
- large national exposure to medicare
- medical cost ratio has risen to 90%
- large amount of short-term debt due I believe in 1/2002
- the senior debt rating has decreased to ba3 from investment grade over the
last two years
- company is changing provider contracting from capitation to
risk-based/fee-for-service. This entails different capabilities, greater
capital expenditures, and also changes the timing of
revenues/expenses/liabilities making financial statements less comparable to
prior PHSY statements

I also bought Midas (MDS) at around 10x earnings. It was touted in Barron's two
editions ago by a value manager. I like the idea of nationally branded auto
service. I also own Pep Boys which has worked out well for me.

BMY - Clairol sale
Jeffrey, Pauls answer was pretty good, but here is my take. BMY decided to sell
Clairol instead of spinning it off tax free to shareholders, because the
company is worth more for a PG than as a standalone entity. The reason for this
is that Clairol was losing market share and needed and overhaul. In addition,
cost saving of about 100M$ for PG add value for the seller as well as for the
buyer.
BMY does not need the money desperately and decides about spinoff or outright
sale on a case by case basis. For example, the orthopedics devision Zimmer will
be spun of tax free because it is vailable as a standalone company.

re: CNGR and loans/loan originations. If I recall correctly the used car/truck
businesses have been in operation for 16 years, and they were bought by CNGR
within the last two. So there may indeed be some temptation at least for CNGR
to "enhance" these operations' earnings now and in future so CNGR can show a
good profit and subsequently sell these businesses. Which is what CNGR seems to
be in the business of doing (buying and selling businesses).

You folks are implying that since it's not possible or easy for an outsider to
ascertain the amount and/or provisions of these possible loans, they could, and
maybe even likely might, come back to drastically harm current and past
earnings. So the stock is not suitable to buy because the risks associated with
it are not understandable, is that right? And you are also saying that the
market knows or suspects this, and that is why the stock is down to what seems
like a superficially low price. Is that also correct?

In other words, because the risks are likely to exist large but are unknowable
and/or not able to be scoped, there is no price at which you guys would be a
buyer of this company?

Upping my position in ESR. I've changed my view of it from being a value stock
to now being a good speculation.

On a value basis the numbers look all right to me. Not a compelling buy now -
the stock seems to have made part of its move, but still, I'd say there's room
for the stock price to see further gains as a value stock. The price/book is
still relatively low, as is the p/sales. Based on Yahoo's coverage, the
consensus estimate of the three analysts who follow the stock is for $1.13 this
year. That's an estimated p/e of 8-9 given ESR's stock price now of 8-9.

http://biz.yahoo.com/p/e/esr.html

From the Yahoo board on the stock, some posters believe that institutional
money has come into the stock recently, and that big buying has caused the run
up in the stock. The volume of trading does seem to have increased recently.

The speculation:

We know/believe/suspect/guess that Caterpillar has moved up at least in part
because it is strong in building generators/power plant equipment that are/will
be in big demand. Am I remembering correctly the recent Business Week picture
of these large generators being assembled by workers at a CAT manufacturing
facility? Emerson too was previously mentioned here or on Buffettology thread
as having a presence in manufacturing power generation equipment.

Moving to the next level: Who will install, integrate, and test all this
equipment at the customer's site?
ESR, for one.

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/010529/datu031_2.html

This announcement says they have contracts for 3 plants/facilities representing
465 megawatts and valued at a total of $42M. I will guess it's the start of
many such contracts if this part of the press release is correct: "The United
States Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration reports that
190,000 megawatts of new generating capacity will be built by 2004."
Although ESR is a $4.3B revenue company, these future contracts should be
substantial and very lucrative. (if I understand how contractors who already
have jobs continue to bid high on upcoming jobs, knowing if they get their high
bid accepted they move on it, and if they don't they have fallback work. That's
how they treat me at the micro level anyway -g-)

It's really not a matter of how much of this pie ESR will get and how much will
fall to the bottom line or what happens after 2004. It's about the speculative
aspect. People are looking to see what companies benefit from the energy
problem. They've not found ESR yet (imo). I've searched SI and there's no
mention of this company by the daytrader/swingtrader/mo-mo trader/breakout boys
or at the energy sites But, imo, a couple of more deal announcements by ESR,
another 1+ jump to a new high if more institutions come into the stock, and ESR
COULD/MAYBE/MIGHT attract attention and move up soon and quickly to 12 or 15.
Or at least to newer highs. That's the bet I'm making now.

has been very, very wrong in previous speculative plays like this by too

Subprime lending has not done well with Wall street. And public companies in
the subprime car business have proven to be big losers for many investors. See
UGLY now and years ago a company called Urcarco which failed miserably, prior
to that management kicked & screamed that their reserves were sufficient while
the shorts were laughing & selling all they could, there was some insider
buying by one of the directors for a pretty large amount too.

I have not looked at this company specifically, but I know that Urcarco & later
many subprime lenders underreserved bigtime which has the effect of showing
nice earnings now and then later the problems come home to roost with a
vengence as the $3500 wholesale piece, which they sold for $7995 with $1000
down is later repoed and torn to hell and they end up selling it for $500-1000.

All that being said, subprime auto lending works all over the country for
family owned dealers. But usually its done on a smaller scale with less out of
pocket risk. (ie; a $1000 wholesale piece is sold for $800 down)

As for CNGR, the good news is they are buying back stock. The bad news is so
did Urcarco, UGLY & a lot of the subprime lenders of years past.

My guess is without direct knowledge of their lending & operations practices,
It is difficult to guess if their reserves are sufficient.

So...I would wait for significant insider buying to show the way. Even then,
its no guarantee.

David Stern: I agree with your comments about the marketing plan. The thing
about McDonald's is its consistency - in food - menu and taste, preparation
style, cleanliness of restaurant, and so on. (In the USA. In Europe menu varies
with nationality as you mention.) McD's plays the Ronald McDonald clown ads to
get kids to whine to their folks, "I want McDonald's!". Also when it seems that
teenagers are hanging out or loitering too much at their local McD's, McD's
then re-emphasizes Ronald, clown, and children, and for teenagers this makes
being seen hanging around a McD's as very uncool. Which is what store managers
want. (Eat and scram teenagers!)

In my local area, I will guess that the fast food hamburger of choice (by
critics and out-of-towners as well as a devoted following) is the In-and-Out
Burger chain. If I get back to Atlanta, I'll try The Varsity, which this
month's Forbes says is the best fast food (hamburger) restaurant chain in the
USA.

I find your comments on JBX very ironic. I review JBX stock occasionally, but
I've always passed on it. Never could get it near its lows. And I almost never
eat in any of their places, even though there's one close to where I live.
OTOH, I'm a fan of the Australian-themed Outback Steakhouse - the stock. And

With HBI rising to $3.50 or so it becomes a question of if the concept is
sustainable. I have my doubts. Seems to me that Homeplace (formerly Waccamaw)
is very similar and they are in liquidation.
Only one store anywhere near HBIs "House to Home" is Reno.
Not sure how similar they are.

I have concerns that the honeymoon period will wear off and shoppers will not
go as much and sales will fall short of their expectations. (which are growing
about 2 million per year for the first few years).

Now for the department stores, BONT & EBSC. I just noticed that a department
store in the NY/NJ area is in liquidation.
Sterns department stores. Not sure how similar they are to BONT/EBSC but I
wonder since they have over a dozen stores in the area where many money
managers live if that doesnt have an effect in them buying shares in a
department store.

The contrarion in me suspects that after those stores are gone and forgotten,
the guys in that area of the country may pay more attention to BONT trading at
a 4 P/E based on this years expected EPS.

Thread, take a look at NasdaqNM: PARL - seems to fit the "VALUE STOCK"
category...

A consumer related company, manufacturing, taking franchises on the fragrance
interests of many respected Hi-touch brands and distributing fragrances.

Why ? Because CONSUMER NON-CYCLICAL stocks are screaming ahead and this looks
like a good catch-up play to me: Parlux Fragrances, NasdaqNM: PARL, around
$2.50.

Histortically the company topped in 1996 at $15. It's biggest customer (PARL
shares the CEO with it, Mr. Lekach), then called Perfumania posed the biggest
problem to PARL back then, with an open A/R debt of $22m. Motley Fool had an
article in 1997 ("daily trouble") commenting on this theme. Accordingly the
company had to restructure, improving its product mix and trying to get its
feet into other distribution entities than Perfumanie.

Well those times of trouble are gone now and PARL emerged strengthened from its
restructuring efforts. The E-Biz boom of 99/2000 also helped Perfumania to pay
off half of the open A/R to PARL, now down to around $12m. Plus PARL
de-emphasized the reliance on Perfumania.

Anyway, PARL is quite profitable by now, after having turned around. Last
quarter's profit was 7 cents. However a simple completed refinancing (company
is currently running on shortterm borrowing) could turn this into 10 cents. I
calculated a P&L "potential" model and arrived at a high-end quarerly EPS 0,20
that could be achieved by just a 10% increase in revenues. With consumer
spending strong, this seems to be outright possible for the total year. Last
quarter's EPS was $0,07.but with a refinancing that appears to be very close
(with GREATLY REDUCED INTEREST RATES, PARL currently paid above 12% annually
acc. to SEC filings!) they could easily do $0,10 per quarter even with all
other parameters unchanged from last quarter.

Unlike 1997, it is no longer considering itself "for sale" but the funds seemed
to have noticed. Recently Dimensional fund advisors (see:
www.insidertrader.com) raked up their holding from 9% to an 18% stake. Guess
the CEO & major stake owner, Mr. Lekach didn't like this entirely, so he
negotiated a STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT with another holder of a 10% chunk ("North
Shore "), giving him access to those shares in CASE OF A TAKOVER for $4 a piece
(until August, 20th 2001) (see: EDGAR filings on PARL - "stock option agreemt")

To me this looks like a prelude to a battle for the CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.
Valuations are very low, PSR around 0,35, revenues growing above 10% per year
and PARL de-leveraged considerably over the past years. External borrowings are
down to $5m, they should be debt free by next year if they just continued their
course. Implicit earnings per share are around 0,30-0,40, more to the higher
end because any completed refinancing should decrease their interest payment
requirements materially. If my P&L model calculation turns out to be ok, they
might earn 0,80 a year on just 10% of revenue growth. An implicit PE of 8 and a
PE with 10% sales growth implication near 4 do not look shabbily either IMHO.
As sales are growing, gross margin is growing too, surpassing the 60% level

Finally they just nailed another franchise deal, this time for a truly
respected national brand: JOCKEY.

The only bad news about PARL might be the mere fact that it's a thinly traded
stock. Anyway this didn't discourage me from taking a long position.

best wishes

Your question implies that insider-buying is a sign of astuteness on the part
of the insider. I'm not sure I agree with that implication at all. There are
I'm sure, many cases where insiders bought and the company tanked not too long
afterward. There are also cases where they bought and the company did very
well.

I can't speak for anyone else, but insider buying or selling isn't very high on
my list of things that I take into consideration when making a decision to own
or avoid a particular company.

If I get into an investment/speculation because of the actions of others (be
they insiders, analysts, or neighbors), rather than as a result of my own
research, I won't know what to do in time of crisis. "Should I continue to hold
while it's going down? Should I buy more at the lower levels? Should I sell now
that it's up 20%? Should I buy more?" These questions and more are very
difficult to answer if I don't know why I'm in the stock in the first place.

Does that mean that stocks that I don't like always go down? Of course not! Do
I second-guess myself if they move opposite of what I expect? Of course not!
But I will sometimes look again to see if there is some crucial element of
evaluation I have either overlooked or haven't yet discovered. But, usually, I
only look a second time if I can see a pattern emerging with a group of stocks,
not just one.

CNGR may make a lot of money for a lot of folks, or it might end up differently
than that. Insider buying may be confirming what I already think of management!

I don't know what to think of the USG situation. On the one hand I believe that
all corporations should be accountable for their actions, on the other, I think
a sense of proportionality should also apply. How that could be determined or
enforced I don't know.

As far as companies, in general, that have large potential liabilities, since I
don't know how to quantify those liabilities, I stay away from the company
until the situation becomes clearer. I know that sometimes I'll miss getting in
when nobody wants the stock and it's price is dirt cheap, but that is one of
the prices I'm willing to pay for feeling secure in my analysis of the assets,
liabilities and "going business concern" values.

SCNT: NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Cast away and left for dead, Internet consulting
companies are suddenly in vogue again - at least among vulture investors and
M&A speculators.

The wooing of Proxicom Inc. (PXCM) by two large buyers caught Wall Street by
surprise last week and reignited speculation that the battered industry is ripe
for further consolidation. Many of these stocks have fallen more than 90% in
the past 12 months and now hover near single-digit lows.

"I expect to see lots of mergers in the next four or five months," says
Stephanie Moore, director of information technology services for GIGA
Information Group Inc., a market research firm.

"Most of the e-services or Internet integrators are up for sale and would
entertain offers from more stable traditional consulting or hardware
companies," Moore adds.

That was evident in two moves announced late Monday: the proposed buyout of
Agency.com Ltd. (ACOM) and the sale of Rare Medium Group Inc. (RRRR).

Fund managers, investment bankers and analysts who follow the out-of-favor
industry say some more deals are in the offering. But most expect any deal to
offer limited premiums and only involve the higher caliber companies. That's
why most of these stocks continue to languish.

"I think there's a handful of attractive" acquisition targets, says Deborah
Koch, co-manager of the Strong Advisor Technology Fund. She noted that several
of these companies are trading for less than their cash on hand, including
Scient Corp. (SCNT), Viant Corp. (VIAN) and Lante Corp. (LNTE).

There's no shortage of struggling Web professional services firms looking for a
white knight or, conversely, deep-pocketed, high-tech manufacturers and
overseas players looking to beef up their services offerings on the cheap.

Does anyone have any insights into USG and the possibility that only US Gypsum
is liable for asbestos?

Is there some possibility that USG will be able to protect the other
subsidiaries?

It seems to me that the other subs should be worth two or three times as much
USG's current stock price of $5.00 even if the parent gets stuck with all the
debt. I know Mary Whitman has discussed this one a few times and Warren held
15% of the company, but it's outside my range.

Any opinions?

Re Bond symbols : try Yahoo, symbol lookup, type in "us gypsum". That should

I did a "google" search ( www.google.com ) for the words whitman and USG to get
this link ( interview with Whitman where he discusses his investment in USG ):

http://news.morningstar.com/doc/article/0,1,4263,00.html

Whitman's Third Avenue Fnds site ( http://www.mjwhitman.com/index.html ) has a
Q&A section that discusses his investments in USG. Also, the sharholders letter
itemizes his bond investments.

Hope you have better luck than I did with USG!

Dale - or anybody else here - can you offer some words about BLX?

Context: Dale (to Paul): "lots of folks hate buying stocks that have already
moved up, but the ideal 45-degree upslope chart just keeps going and going if
the value is there. Have to climb aboard when you think the underlying
fundamentals are right."

I got scared out of BLX at a loss under 20 maybe a couple years back. Now I'm
looking to reenter. But now at a new high of 35. And I'm going to be very upset
with myself if I lose AGAIN on this stock, and from an even higher entry point
than my first losing purchase.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BLX&d=c&k=c1&a=v&p=s&t=2y&l=on&z=m&q=l

I can see that 45-upslope. And disregarding that I am once again LATE to the
party, and I have even missed the recent dividend to boot, the value still
seems there.

At debt/eq = 2, I say a 14% ROE (which seems to be a very rough average over
the past few years) suggests to me this stock ought to/might/could be selling
at some point maybe 1.5x book (which level it's sold at before). And given the
stock's selling now about 35 with book also about 35 (and that bv is growing),
that'd mean at least a 50% gain in the stock.

We're looking here at a special (niche) banking company (They make short term
loans to finance trade from Latin America primarily) selling at a p/e of 6 or 7
now, but which in past, has sold for p/e 's as low as 5 (yearly avg) and as
high as 12-13.

If anyone here is interested in this company, please let me know. I'll need a
bit of a push to start a position on this one. -g-.

TimbaBear,

I agree with you, and certainly can't claim any special insight into the
liabilities of a company such as USG. IMHO, the pendulum has swung far enough.
Accountability needs to start moving towards the center, between individuals
and corporations, at least wrt asbestos liability.

My USG position is relatively small and isn't a disaster for my portfolio. So
now, I've been wrong many, many, many, many times. I was hoping to catch up to
Paul Senior, who's only been wrong "...many, many time before....." LOL!

Having said that, I'm considering to bid on USG at $4 tomorrow, just to make it
interesting....

WSJ article on asbestos liability ( looks like there's no hope ):

June 4, 2001

Court, Congress, Leave Asbestos-Taint Cos. To `Vultures'
By MICHAEL C. BARR

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
NEW YORK -- Some companies tainted by asbestos-related lawsuits are looking for
Congress to bail them out, but the outlook for help is dim.

At least that's the opinion of distressed debt investors, or vultures, who
specialize in finding overlooked value in seriously troubled companies. For
them, though, the bad news is good news, as the prospect of more bankruptcies
among companies exposed to asbestos-related litigation could leave vulture
funds in a prime position to pick up some value among the pieces of broken-up
entities.

A number of viable companies, most recently W.R. Grace & Co. (GRA), have had to
file for bankruptcy protection in the past year, as their options ran out in
defending themselves from asbestos liability lawsuits. And USG Corp (USG)
announced Monday that it was contemplating filing for Chapter 11 protection in
response to rising costs related to asbestos litigation.

Still other companies have been seriously wounded by their asbestos exposure.
Crown Cork & Seal Inc. (CCK), Owens Illinois Inc. (OI) and Federal-Mogul Corp.
(FMO) all have been hurt to varying degrees by asbestos litigation.

Spokesmen for Crown Cork & Seal, Owens Illinois, Federal-Mogul and USG did not
return telephone calls seeking comment for this article.

The main dilemma for these companies is that mandatory class-action lawsuits
can't be brought in asbestos matters. Such suits bring finality to potential
legal exposure since all parties with a claim must sign onto the class action.

To have a mandatory class action, according to one bankruptcy lawyer, it's
necessary to have common facts. In the tobacco suits, for example, it was
possible to point to enough common elements that a class could be put together.
But with asbestos, there are different minerals involved and such a variety of
products that it's not possible to unite claimants into a single class.

In previous cases before it, the Supreme Court wouldn't grant mandatory
class-action status for asbestos litigants, allowing those who wished to opt
out and sue separately. So asbestos lawsuits are brought serially, as groups of
plaintiffs are assembled. This results in there never being any finality to
liability, because it is always possible to cobble together a new group of
litigants.

"Trial lawyers are becoming more aggressive in finding claimants," says Omar
Jama, associate director at Fitch. In fact, "lawyers are the real driver of the
trend, putting ads in papers looking for asbestos claims," he says.

No Way Out
Currently, the only way for a company to achieve finality with respect to its
asbestos liability is to file for bankruptcy protection. This is because, as a
general principle, any claims not presented to the court before the company
reorganizes and reemerges are extinguished.

In short, the bankruptcy court says: Speak now or forever hold your peace.

Further, the bankruptcy code has a special provision, 524(g), that allows a
trust to be set up against which all present and future asbestos claims must be
made. But to take advantage of this provision, the plaintiffs must be given a
51% ownership interest, or control of the reorganized company.

Some companies are pinning their hopes on legislative relief given the Supreme
Court's stance.

The court "has signaled the need for Congress to step in," says Jama.

Legislation has been introduced in the past, but it has not advanced.

"Tort reform is going to be real tough," says Evan Flaschen, co-head of the
financial restructuring group at the Hartford, Ct. law firm of Bingham Dana.

This view is echoed by Stuart Hirshfield, chairman of the bankruptcy group at
New York-based Dewey Ballantine. The issue "has been out there for 20 years,
ever since the Johns Manville asbestos-induced filing, but Congress has failed
to act," he said.

With the recent defection of Vermont's Sen. Jim Jeffords from the Republican
Party, giving the Democrats a Senate majority, such reform becomes even less
likely for the near term. Analysts cite the strong ties that exist between
trial attorneys, who oppose such reform, and the Democratic Party.

Meanwhile, due to the declining number of solvent asbestos-tainted companies
that lawsuits can target, attorneys are "rushing to get claims in, because as
more companies file for bankruptcy protection, the fewer there are to sue,"
said Jama.

In its 10-K annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Armstrong Holdings Inc. (ACK) said that one of the factors that led to the
bankruptcy petition of its unit Armstrong World Industries was the filing by a
separate, unrelated asbestos-tainted company, Owens Corning (OWC).

According to the 10-K, "this hurt AWI's ability to obtain ongoing financing on
acceptable terms."

For those asbestos-tainted companies that have resisted the bankruptcy option,
it becomes more difficult to meet their own financing requirements, as
liquidity concerns become paramount. Banks and investors become even more
cautious and expect greater compensation for the perceived risks.

Still, as the asbestos-tainted run out of options, the distressed investment
community is closing in, sensing new opportunities.

Distressed debt investors look at assets and seek value not otherwise
recognized in companies that are either in default or near-default on their
debt obligations. The debt can take the form of bank loans, bonds or trade
claims. These investors typically look for a return of greater than 20% on
their investments.

Companies with asbestos problems appeal to those investors that are looking to
outside factors tripping up what are otherwise solid companies. Other examples
would include companies plagued by changing government healthcare reimbursement
standards or flawed utility deregulation.

BLX - I don't know anything about this business niche, but a few impressions:

--BLX trading at book value is good, depending on what makes up that book value

--Earnings growth seems to be excellent. What is driving it?

--Share price gain YTD is minimal. I would probably pass based on that. A net
2-3 point gain since January is not the 45 degrees that really turns me on.

--Economic turmoil in Latin America would make me very wary of anything related
to the region.
