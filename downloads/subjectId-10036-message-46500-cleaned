<< Where interest is concerned, most banks give shippers a holiday on payments
since it is better to allow the ship to run than take possession and try to
sell it in a depressed market which gives me hope there is some support for
continuing operating of ships>>.

That's kind of a mixed blessing it seems to me. To improve the fundamentals of
the business, capacity needs to be reduced to be in line with demand. That way
low rates will cure themselves eventually. I think now many older ships will be
running at a loss for many years (probably just operating expense minus rates,
but certainly if you also include the capital and financing costs), so once
operators realize that they can't just ride out this period of time they will
retire the least economic ships, take salvage value and the industry
fundamentals will eventually recover. (You may be primarily interested in the
oil shippers/ OSG? - I think the situation there is not quite as dire as the
dry shippers)

Denbury Resources, Inc. ( Holdi (DNR) - Closed out position @ $19.71/share

Article below has a fair value for DNR of $19.00/share. According to my GN
calculation it's a bit higher at $19.10 (if you use tangible BV it's $16.52).
Company sold some wells and land recently for a very good price when viewed
based on Barrels of Daily Production. Proceeds were used to reduce debt. I
thought the stock would have moved higher on that news.

https://ir.citi.com/2WM8sx3OXdj%2F1LfWPS3BhCiWONZE296iKCjVS5q59m4%3D

As a result, I took my profits and will look for a reentry back at the
$15.00/share level. Earnings are to be released later this month (Feb 23,
2012). The Citi report is actually positive regarding their producing assets.
So, I was surprised to see their $19.00/share valuation figure.

I will be watching this one as I also like their pipeline assets as that part

Yes that would have been prescient, however then was then and now is now. I was
following HIG somewhat and decided to take a position based on what I think
it's worth under current circumstances. I also read though their last investors
meeting transcripts (Dec 2011) and reconsidered my position that HIG is a dog.
For one thing, they placed a significant part of their low ROA business which
consumers 30% of their equity into runoff.
This should free up capital sooner or later. They also own a wealth management
business (mutual funds etc) that consumes very little capital. All this can be
bought for 40% of book. There is going to be a DAC hit to book of ~3$/share and
maybe a little more, but still. Unless capital markets become unglued this
stock should go higher.

Today, the stock actually follows my directions <g>.

Paul -

Do these Bdc ever sell at their NAV? It seems like the "pure" value buy, would
be to pick shares up below the NAV. I do like to buy in below the price of the
secondary so anything below $19.00 (the offering price) might be a bargain.

With the new inflow of capital, it should raise the NAV to $15.50/share, so
maybe the "Value" buying range would be between $16.00/share - $18.00/share.

FWIW, sold out of my NYB as I captured the dividend and really want to park the
funds (probably at Credit Union) waiting for the inevitable market correction.

Bdc's: Yes, they sometimes sell at or below their NAV.

Re: "It seems like the "pure" value buy, would be to pick shares up below the
NAV". Yes, it seems that way, and that's the operative way we might consider
most businesses. However, in my view, I'm not sure it's relevant for bdc's. The
bdc's I'm familiar with all grow by issuing shares-- that seems to be the
nature of the bdc setup. Bdc managers afaik get larger pay the larger the
assets they manage and the more deals they do. So there can be an incentive to
issue more shares -- whether or not the bdc trades above NAV or below. Below,
that would be dilution for the current stockholders. Management might argue
that their deployment of the proceeds from the stock issuance (coupled with now
larger borrowing ability), will enable the company to invest more and grow
distributions to all shareholders. And it's the distributions (high yield, or
maybe high yield and growing distributions) which keep investors in these
stocks. I don't know. With bdc's I'm more cautious about buying in when they
sell below NAV than when they trade above NAV. I've only run across one bdc (I
can't remember which), where the ceo said they decided they would not issue
shares while their stock traded below its nav.

NYB: I previously sold most shares held to park funds. I have an order in for
more shares at lower prices.

The rumor I heard was that the audit was instigated by a fund (possibly a hedge
fund w/ special interests). This fund also took a very large short position and
as the company responded to the allegations, things blew up. From my following
of the time line, the company made advance payments to their growers based on
long term "fixed" priced grower contracts. The price of walnuts soared as the
recent harvest was only 30% of normal. Growers did not receive any higher
prices so left the co-op arrangement and many sold their harvest in the private
market.

Some growers stayed but wanted higher prices, so the company offered to
"advance" future payments now, renegotiate their future contracts at a higher
rate to "recapture" their advances. The key to the new deal was to maintain
their grower base and stop them leaving the co-op.

The creative bookkeeping is now catching up with the company which basically
will result in lower reported earnings to the amount of these "advanced"
payments. They will not net out but WILL result in lower earnings per share.

The questions are:

1) Was there fraud?
2) How much will earnings be restated? (Probably only effects the current year
but earnings could be overstated by 3x).
3) What is their grower base AFTER they fix this problem? The company is
nothing w/o their growers.
4) Can the company enforce their grower contracts if "Fraud" was involved and
would they want to force this on their growers for future production?

My take is that it will eventually work out. The stock is broken and I see a
possible play at a price of $12.00/share or lower. The growers got screwed
because of the bad weather but were locked into low prices. I doubt they would
want to look at a similar model for the future. Therefore, the stock will have
a much more fluctuating earnings stream so PE will compress (Note the company
was able to show a long history of growth).

Even if you can pick shares up on the cheap, I would wait until the hedge fund
that started all the allegations, covered their shorts and has moved on to
another sandbox. This could be 6 months or more at least.

EKS

Be advised that a similar situation could blow up Green Mountain Coffee
Roasters, (GMCR). The same source of the Diamond rumor says that GMCR has been
stuffing their supply channels booking the product as sales (but not really
sold). A hedge fund has established a large short position and is pushing for
an SEC audit of the company for the alleged channel stuffing. This was a common
practice in the 90's with disk drives. I even remember where a company shipped
boxes with bricks enclosed and booked these shipments as sales. The new twist
20 years later is hedge funds are magnifying the company's problems by taking
huge short interests in the company and throwing around allegations and
threatening SEC action. Sometimes the SEC responds w/ specific company audits
like in the Diamond walnut case.

The higher dividend should support a higher price. A $0.90/share price would

Mr. Gogo -

From today's AAII update email
"...Buffett argued that bonds fail to protect investors’ purchasing power. He
calculates that when taxes and inflation are subtracted from bond returns,
investors fail to gain wealth. Given declines in the value of the U.S. dollar,
bonds have ultimately hurt investors’ purchasing power. (Purchasing power is a
measure of how much goods an amount of currency buys. As the cost of goods and
services rises, purchasing power is diminished if wealth is not increased at an
even faster pace. In non-economic terms, a dollar ain’t what it used to be.)

Buffett is right. If you hold your entire portfolio in cash or bonds, you run
the risk of losing out to inflation. This is particularly a threat in today’s
low-interest-rate environment. Worse yet, as I explained to the AAII member who
recently called, there aren’t any fixed-income investments that don’t expose
you to low yields, potentially falling bond prices in the future, credit risk
or currency risk. Any option in the bond market right now has identifiable
faults...."

------------------------------------------

My quandary is I have been raising cash (from selling stocks) but really do not
have a safe & secure place to park the funds w/o generating a negative yield
(after inflation). My best bet is my Credit Union that pays 0.7% annual. I have
been selling securities that I believe are fairly valued but have generated a
minimum return of 4% or less.

My other alternative, is to pay down a Home Equity Line of credit that I used
to buy some very depressed real estate. The rate is 2.125% annual, a historical
low rate to borrow money. Moving the money here I can yield 2.125%, The
property generates a returns cash on cash of 7% so it's a marginal positive
return to pay down my debt and book the positive return generated from the
property.

My thesis is to stay very liquid so when the "Correction" happens, and we get a
quick 20% sell off, I will be able to gobble up all the value bargains.

You can not fight the FED but w/ these very low interest rates it presents a
unique investment option of "Value" vs "negative return" for holding cash. Even
Buffet agrees we are at the extreme level on Bonds and Cash . . . does this
mean that the current stock market rally continues much higher?

I have decided to pay off the Home Equity Line of Credit and even buy more
depressed real estate as long as the cash on cash returns are 8% or higher.
It's a once in a life time buying opportunity.

Still waiting for a market correction but have my back door Real Estate
investment option that should provide me a excellent long term ROI, well above
the historical average. We do live in interesting times.

EKS,

Maybe I'm not following your logic very well, but it seems to me that you want
to “have your cake and eat it too”.

“My thesis is to stay very liquid so when the "Correction" happens, and we get
a quick 20% sell off, I will be able to gobble up all the value bargains. . . .

I have decided to pay off the Home Equity Line of Credit and even buy more
depressed real estate “

I guess the question is, how long do you think it will take for this 20% sell
off and how likely do you believe in your sell off thesis? If you have
certainty in the correction and you believe the correction will happen within
six months to a year, I'd say don't sweat the low returns. Keep your gun locked
and loaded.

If you pay off your HELOC and buy more real estate, will you have the cash to
“gobble up all the value bargains”? If you pay off your HELOC and don't buy
additional properties, you save the 2.125% and preserve your liquidity for the
20% sell off. (I'm not sure what state you live in, but in Texas you can not
use a HELOC for stocks. At least that's what I've been lead to believe about my
HELOC.)

With mortgage rates at their lowest level, I would try and convert these

Started a very small tracking position. My strategy is to accumulate shares w/
the idea that I am buying the actual asset (w/ a dividend), hoping that in 18
months NG will be at higher prices.

Wilbur Ross continues to Buy w/ large buys at $7.00/share and $6.95/share as
recently as February 3.

Got my tracking buy at $6.95/share. I noticed that the stock did trade around
$4.50/share at the depth of the "crash" in 11/2008.

Still really lucky I sold my previous lots at $20.00/share and now have the
opportunity to pick up those same shares at $7.00.

AWRE. Yes, interesting write-up. I'll pass on the stock.

Company success is dependent on "monetization of patents" and/or ability to
secure/grow business from biometrics?
It's somebody's opinion that they will be successful in doing that. I've no
reason to assume success.

Company has plenty of cash, no debt. Apparently also a real estate asset.
Somebody has calculated the building's comp value. I don't know enough to
confirm that building's value.

Meanwhile among all the company's prospects, its roe over the past five years
has been lousy, its stated book value seems to be increasing by pennies. Its
profit margins right now have increased over past years (a positive)

In this kind of stock market where there still seem to be many opportunities to
dig among downtrodden good/profitable companies, I've no interest in this dink
cigar-butt. Somebody else who knows the company, would make a commitment (time
& dollar) to be in AWRE might do very well. Just on the numbers I like, it's
not an obvious buy. And for me, my situation now, the few shares I might commit
to a buy would just appear as a distraction. So I pass.

while mr buffett is very intelligent and a much better investor than I am
sometimes he makes mistakes. I dont think that the comparison of gold to tulips
is appropriate. gold and silver for that matter have been considered stores of
value by the world population for thousands of years. Over the few centuries
that governments have issued their own paper money, we have seen many
situations where the printing presses rolled to the point where people would
not hold the currency at all. We have never seen that with gold or silver.
because there are limits as to how much can be produced. Mr Buffett also does
not address mention that in the past few years despite the rise in price
contrary to what you would expect from conventional economics very little
additional production has come on the market. so like some other resources gold
is getting harder and more expensive to pull out of the ground. On the other
hand there seems to be no shortage of bills being printed.

Do i think farmland is a better long term investment than gold? yes i do , if I
knew that I could manage it properly at a low enough cost. unfortunately i have
only lost money on my ag investments so far. Also most farmland is taxable too.
so one has to figure out how to make it advantagious. I know people have
purchased farmettes and different parts of the country and profited handsomely
from that. I remember seeing a story about how this guy in texas was getting
some great rice subsidy from the government because even though he had never
grown rice he was getting paid not to grow it because it was possible for him
to do so. so they figured out how much he could potentially grow and
compensated him not to grow it. Im sure there are thousands of programs like
that one in the united states. If I had to it all over again I would have
gotten a law degree and figured out to how to get the government to pay me not
to do things on top of paying me to do them.

Madharry, I was looking at some farmland sales prices where my Dad lives
(Kentucky), and for the life of me I can't see how anyone can afford to justify
going into farming unless you've had the land in your family for a long time
and it's already paid off. It seems to me the price of farmland is as high as
it is because it's being sold off in lots for housing and other purposes, not
ag or livestock use. Obviously that's my relatively limited view, but after
running numbers based on land auction and asking prices I asked my Dad about it
(a farmer for many years and regularly speaks with other farmers), and he
confirmed what it seemed to me. You just can't pay 5-10K per acre for prime
farmland and justify it based on the cashflow generated by farming - at least
not where he's at in KY.

I use valuation: buy when things are cheap, sell when they are expensive. And
stocks are becoming less cheap day by day. Since undervaluation in some places
was very deep, a lot of stocks are still undervalued, so you might be right to
buy. But quite a few stocks are reaching fairly valued to overvalued levels.

Overall, it's not a market for indiscriminate buying and not a market for
indiscriminate selling. If Euro-crisis was not hanging on our heads, I'd say we
are in the early rounds of bull market. With the current situation, I am not so
optimistic. I am still hanging around 20-22% cash level. Obviously, I

Hi Mad.

My mother lives on 40 acres in Wisconsin.

There is some land being lost to development no doubt.

The real changes however are farmers paying up to land owners who have their
land enrolled in government CRP programs. "Conservation Restoration Programs".

These pay a pittance which barely covers the real estate taxes and has
associated with the plan expensive maintenance requirements - removal of
invasive plant species and every 5 years a discing of the grasses.

Local Dairy farmers seek out people on these plans and pay a 10 times per acre
rental fee to grow corn and alfalfa which is exclusively used by their Dairy
operation.

Upon expiration of the CRP plan (a 10 year commitment) my Mother will not only
be able to cover her taxes,she will actually have some revenue each year.

Dairy farmers are of such huge scale now a days that they have a hard time
competing with the corn demand for ethynol utilization.

When I went to high school in Wisconsin a large dairy farmer would have 100
head to milk.Now the dairy farmer wanting to rent my mothers property milks
1700 cows.

This particular farmer is very well capitalized and not only runs a large herd
but also has the equipment equivalent to a crop farmer and instead leases
thousands of acres to justify the cost of modern day ag equipment.

He leases an area within 30 miles of his farm.He tries to cluster parcels of
acreage so they can be tilled /planted with out moving the equipment more than
once.He leases to the north and south east and west of his farm as an insurance
policy to guard against lach of or excessive rain/wind.

In combination, these two forces have driven up the value of farm land as it is
defined by the rental value it can generate.

These are all excellent benefits IMO.

It is quite an evolution in market forces and efficiency technology in both
dairy farming and the growth of ag products.

Net result is more land going to ag products and less land being paid for by
the government to leave the land for native grasses and/or bird habitat CRP
programs.

I own 35 acres of land in Wisconsin that is right next to developed areas. The
beauty is that the taxes on the land are about 600 dollars a year. Why? Because
it is used for agriculture. Development land is in the tank. No one is buying.
That is not true of ag land. The price of ag land here is driven by the massive
dairy operations which buy land to raise their feed but also to spread their
manure. Prices are around 4500 an acre. Anyone around here would jump to buy at
that price. Everybody in farming is making money. We rent out our land for 150
an acre which is a low price but it pays taxes insurance and leaves about 4500
left at the end of the year. If you are a farmer and not making money now you
have a brown thumb.

I purchased some Taiyo Nippon Sanso 4091.t last night at 511Yen. The stock
appears cheap based on PE (~11) and EV/EBITDA. This position is currency
hedged.

I like the industrial gas business in general, because based on my personal
work related observations, customers are pretty much locked in and new
production processes often demand more expensive gases. Taiyo Nippon Sanso is
the leading gas supplier in Japan and they are strong in semiconductor gases
used for CVD (MOCVD gases etc.) 30% of their business is now overseas (US and
strong bridgeheads in Vietnam and Phillipines). They are weak in China still
but investing there too.

ROA is very low but they have a lot of depreciation and their balance sheet has
improved the last 2 years. I am betting that they ROA will improve over time
(they stated this goal in Y2011 annual report) but we have to see. The stock is
near a multi year low, partly because the valuation was reset and because their
operating earnings were somewhat below forecast (per 2/8/2012 announcement).
Still, I think 4091.T is the only cheap way to buy a industrial gas company
right now, as others are deservedly valued at least at mid teens PE's. Based on
my observation, the closes US peer would be Praxair, or in Europe Air Liquide.
(Air products and Linde are more on the industrial and less on the
semiconductor side).

I guess it depends on how confident you feel the bet will work in your favor or
how much margin of safety built in.

If you look at portfolios such as Mohnish Pabrai or Seth Klarman they are using
a form of the kelly criterion. Micheal Price uses this too but he places more

"My single best investment has always surpassed my expectations."

As I say, that's not been so for me.

How have your investments which were not among your single best ideas worked
out for you?

If not as good as the single best idea (or two or three best), then I presume
you would want to concentrate your investments and put more money into your
best idea/ideas. Or maybe alternatively less money or no money into lesser
ideas. I assume based on your history, because your best idea(s) have surpassed
your expectations, that your have more conviction with your best ideas. That's
mostly different from my experience with stocks I've chosen.

As some people say though, all you need is a few good ideas, conviction, money
to buy, and fortitude to hold on. I have a friend whose friend owns only one
stock ---AAPL. His best (and only) idea.

Generally though I'll argue there are a lot of people and several mutual funds
who only invest in their best ideas, and I'm not so sure their results surpass
their expectations. Or in the case of concentrated funds, that they
consistently outperform diversified portfolios of similar style.

Ah well, we're all different with different goals/skill sets/ risk profiles.
Although I may not be willing to bet heavily on my best ideas, I may be like
several (many?) others on SI: I'm willing to bet on YOUR best idea(s) -g-.
Maybe not so much $$ though. Am certainly willing to look at your recent picks.

VKSC,

I saw you liked this because of the high ROE, low PE, and the high Icahn
ownership. At first glance, this looks like an interesting buy. Growing sales,
low PE, expanding into Asia with a new plant expected in 2012, smart lead
investor.

However, there is substantial risk to this and a comparison to cash looks
inappropriate given the high risk in the stock.

Issues
They have a high ROE because book value is minimal, 0.47 per share.

They have over $200 million in debt on which they are paying at 9.875%. They
are paying more yearly on their debt than their book value. Debt-to-equity is
more than 10x, talk about leverage.

Icahn is not only a shareholder, but a lender. As a lender, he could negotiate
favorable investment terms for himself that could leave other shareholders in
the lurch.

Large negative free cash flows due to investment in their Asia business. Given
their leveraged balance sheet, this is somewhat worrisome. 2012 is probably
going to be another negative free cash flow, as they expect to spend $20
million on new plants.

Exposure to commodity price risk of increased raw materials such as pulp, which
they say has a 20% inflation rate.

They have a lawsuit against that looks like it will wrap up favorably (only
appeals rulings now), but still an uncertainty.

They have pension obligations and assume a 8% return on their pension (a bit
high for my taste).

The stock is a "roach motel" pink sheet stock -- you can check in, but if
things go bad you might not be able to sell decent volume at anywhere near a
fair price.

Is there any concern with their very capital intensive business (capex seems

If china slows down any, my feeling would be you are left with an over invested
company who cant cover their cost of capital (if that even matters).

Also what is your take on the increasing debt load of the Japanese Govt and
forever decreasing interest rates on the JGBs? This is also a relationship that
i do not think can hold... i think its actually very toxic.... the effects on a
large industrial would be not so good, if all of a sudden there cost of capital
is say 8% or 10% and turns into 15%.... Personally i believe they could be the

My best ideas certainly did not work out well in 2011 as far as Mr. Market is
concerned. Selling too soon is anecdotally true for me. I dont know if its true
if you look at the hundreds of trades ive made over the years but some of them
really hurt. going alll the way back to disney when i was a kid, apple not that
long ago and in 2008 LVS which i bough the day before The Street came out with
a sell on it in the $2-3 range I thought I was astute selling it in the teens
but now that is over $50 and I have not owned anything that has come close to
tripling since I dont feel so smart. It is difficult as a value investor to
hold onto something after you think its fairly valued and you see something
that looks like a screaming bargain. I dont have an answer to selling too soon.
The thing about some of these companies that are successful is they develop a
model that works and then they have other things in the pipeline that a value
investor cant gauge.
One has to just accept that good management can be worth a lot more than value
investors believe I guess.
So I conclude that sometimes even good managers can stumble and then value
investors can pick up the stock really cheap and then they should just hold on
to some of it overpriced or not. I think that some of these mining/royalty
companies are in that situation now. I was listening to some guy talking about
silver today and he made the comment that there is very little silver around
right now to be a safe haven investment relative to the amount of paper money
and other investments out there like stocks and real estate. As people realize
that they may not want to put all their eggs in dollar denominated assets he
expects physical silver to be harder and harder to come by. Makes sense to me.

Certainly it is a more speculative investment but the company has a niche and
it can grow earnings when they are not spending $10 million dollars on legal
bills defending their patent from bogus lawsuits. Their product is superior to
others and is marketable world wide. The PPS has dropped substantially and I
feel a good entry point, and it is a Peter Lynch like stock. The company also
anticipates re entering the packaging market as well which they sold off

re 4091.T

>>Is there any concern with their very capital intensive business (capex seems

I believe this to be well reflected in the share price. My bet is based on my
assumption (based on my personal experience and watching other players in the
same field) that industrial gas is a fundamentally good business, TNSC has the
leading market share in Japan and some other countries and it is quite possible
for TNSC to do better in terms of financial results going forward. I see a
double if they do, and stagnating shares if they don't; a bet I am willing to
take.

I agree their debt load is substantial but their assets are like infrastructure
assets, with fairly secure cash flows. This is the reason why they have a
pretty good credit rating in Japan. I do not think that a sovereign debt crisis
in Japan would raise TNSC cost of debt to the 8-10% range. For one thing, the
market distinguishes corporate debt from sovereign debt and the other aspects
is that it would probably lead to a dramatically weaker yen, which is a good
thing for a company that is attached to export industries. And since I am short
the yen for the amount of the stock purchase, that should work just fine in my
portfolio.

>>Jva and SWSH have gone belly up for me as I bought much high than you I
suppose. Do you still have them ?<<

You held them? They are trading Sardines, not investments.

A story from WW2 aftermath in Germany, told by Andre Kostolany: During the WW2
aftermath, when black market trading was rampant, a dealer offered another
black market guy a truck load of tuna cans. The black market guy opened a few
cans to check the goods, noticed that the tuna has gone bad and confronted the
dealer.

The dealer said: "Who cares if they are bad or not, they are for trading, not
for eating!"

Interesting parable, might even be true <g>.

No, I sold them at $26 and $8 respectfully. I think that is what successful
investing has come to buy ahead of the crowd and sell at the fever pitch.
Repurchased a small lot of swsh just to track it. It will take some time to
digest all of the buyouts. The operation of their own chemical plants will move
to the bottom line at some point.

I believe that both companies are viable businesses,(not sardines) but
buypoints are important as well, now more than ever. I have a GTC order in for
JVA at $6.50 as I still feel they will be taken out by Green Mountain Coffee.
My time frame and having so much invested and up substantially in one stock
caused me to sell both stocks. Over time both companies will probably come out
OK at some point. However, I feel that you have to balance Risk/Reward always
or you will be hanging on to a bunch of losing positions for a long time. I
have some dividend stocks that are down 3% to 4% but are paying 8%. If I hold
them long term I can still come out OK.

Bought shares of RITPF (Lord Rothchild) due to their involvement with the
ongoing expansion of Brazil farming acreage, more hectors of prime farming land
than anywhere. Brazilian government has restricted the Chinese from owning
property outright. They are trying to buy up farm land to feed their billions
of people, soybeans being primary.

By way of example, we decided a few years ago to increase our exposure to some
of the BRIC

countries. On the unquoted side, our founder investment in Xander Real Estate
in India continues to

perform well. In Brazil we have a close relationship with the money manager
Sagarmatha, we were

cornerstone investors in BR Properties, and we have invested (alongside a
number of the world’s leading

sovereign wealth funds) in Brazil’s premier investment bank, Pactual.

In February we announced the creation of a new alternative asset management and
advisory company,

Renshaw Bay. Bill Winters, formerly Co-Chief Executive of JP Morgan Investment
Bank, is Chairman and

Chief Executive and a major shareholder in the new venture. Our co-investor is
Reinet Investments SCA,

a private investment company connected with Compagnie Financi&#232;re
Richemont, which is chaired by

Johann Rupert.

In March we announced our landmark joint venture with the CREAT Group of China,
who aim, with help

from us, to raise a fund of up to $750 million to invest in private equity
opportunities outside China. I

believe that this is the first vehicle that will enable Chinese private sector
investors to invest overseas

through a private equity fund.

Berkshire Has 7.7% Stake in Wells Fargo
By Noah Buhayar - Feb 14, 2012 1:17 PM PT
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-14/berkshire-has-7-7-stake-in-wells-fargo
html

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) accumulated a 7.7 percent stake in Wells Fargo
& Co. (WFC), the largest U.S. bank by market value, as Chairman Warren Buffett
wagers that stocks will outperform bonds.
Buffett’s firm held more than 400 million shares of the lender, according to a
regulatory filing today listing holdings as of Dec. 31

-----------------------------------------------------

Any idea what the fair value is? It's still hard for me to tell how they value
their sour loans since none of the companies are marking them to market.

Monsanto.

Shame on me for investing in this company a while ago. They should be closed
down and genetic modifications should be forbidden until proven safe.

Hi Mr. Gogo -

Re: Monsanto

Yes that company has taken their business model to the extreme which I feel is
not necessary. Maybe DOW and their genetic seed division can capitalize on
Monsanto's lawyer greed.

I believe there is a place for genetic seeds and the efficiency they bring to
AG production especially when used w/ their Round-Up product (now off patent).
That combination has increased farmer's harvest yields significantly. However,
the contracts that Monsanto make the farmers sign for using their seeds are
almost usurious (especially in foreign countries like Brazil). Small farmers
that elect to use conventional seeds and/or grow Certified Organic are now
being impacted by Monsanto's business model. It's having the biggest effect in
the third world where many of the small farms can't afford to use Monsanto's
seeds. These farmers are excluded (by Monsanto's contracts) to freely sell
their harvest to the large processors. They essentially get shut out of the
market (they can not sell into many of the distribution channels) because
Monsanto's lawyers own the processors via the large grower seed contracts
Monsanto controls.

Every year Monsanto gains more control over the farmer's production. Is the
increased yield worth it? Maybe if the business model is changed that
eliminates the "reach" of their seed patents limiting their litigation rewards.

FWIW, there is some very good work being done at the AG Universities developing
genetic strains of plants (like rice & specialty grasses) that can grow in
saline water that makes unproductive land productive.

If I had to short either FB or AAPL, I'd definitely short FB. If I had to go
long FB or AAPL, I'd go long AAPL. Even at current price.

It's possible that my sale was wrong and AAPL will retain its mojo for 5+
years. I'd be surprised though.

WFC - It might work out OK, but I have no clue what their fair value is. If
they don't hit any rocks and they can return to earning 15% on the book, the
stock has good upside. Both are rather big if's though.
