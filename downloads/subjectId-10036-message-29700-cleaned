Out of my water stock SWWC and moved the funds into PCL (Plum Creek REIT). This
is a timber REIT that yields just over 4% that provides a good hedge against
inflation and typically outperforms other growth companies in times of
recession.

Investing In Timber
http://www.investmentu.com/research/timber-investing.html
The Only Money That Grows On Treesâ€¦ And How to Invest in the Two "Redwoods" of
Wall Street

The company has achieved a CAGR of over 12% since it's inception which is
better than my long term target of 10% for this IRA account.

PCL should provide good long term growth returns as the company generates long
term capital gains from the sale of land parcels that they rezone. Cash flow is
achieved from timber sales, natural gas leases (w/ royalty payments) and the
sales of other sustainable resources including wood pulp, wood chips for
biofuels and aggregate (sand, gravel and crushed stone).

Had just a few shares of SWWC. Sold last year for a tax loss. A bad trade (for
me) that turned into a worse investment. The classic error.

PCL. For me, for it being a reit, and regardless of how profitable timber
companies have been - in this market, I want to see a better div. yield before
I step in for any shares. Jmo.

A positive for PCL (for me) is that at least it's not an l.p. I much prefer the
reit structure. (I don't like those K-1 tax forms.)

Grommit,

As far as income and unrealized gains and losses, I agree ACAS does what BDCs
normally do --- no scandal there.

However, is artficially marking up an investment that is publicly traded way
above its traded market price standard BDC accounting? Control premium doesn't
mean much to me unless they intend to use the control premium to disadvantage
the ECAS shareholders for the benefit of the ACAS shareholders. Otherwise, the
same cash flows accrue to minority shareholders as the majority shareholders.

That marking methodology is about as aggressive as you can get IMO,
particularly when you convince new investors to invest and buy in public
offerings and such based off of those numbers.

The management is smart, but can you trust them and their extremely credit
sensitive portfolio? ACAS is cheap here. I just would rather go with a
management that I trust in this kind of environment. I think the stock could
make a lot of money or it could implode --- don't know which.

I don't think they explained it, or justified it well either. And with this
press release on Jan 7, it looks like they are not going to write it down in Q4
either. They are going to be questioned/challenged at the conf call.

American Capital continues to forecast 14% to 20% growth in net asset value
(NAV) from December 31, 2006, totaling $4.08 to $6.00 growth, to a value in the
range of $33.50 to $35.42 per share at December 31, 2007.

But I still think the stock is a good bet. Even with a write down, they are
trading at NAV. More inside purchases.

Well CIT did not go up as anticipated. They are issuing about 1.4mill shares to
cover the fixed charge ratio of 1.1 which is required under their covenants.

The Financial Accounting rules require Goodwill to be evaluated one a year in
Q4 usually. Therefore CIT writedown of their Student Lending Goodwill was
required since their ROIC was less then their WACC. So I don't think this was
trying to increase losses. They get no tax benefits from writing off Goodwill.

As to their huge credit provisions of $300mill, they get a tax benefit from
that. It was large to take a bath at year end. Proof of this is that the CEO
said they would increase their credit loss reserves at his presentation and
slide show. Second, they arranged to sell stock to cover a deficient fixed
charge coverage which since they have to cover fixed charges-interest and lease
payments- by a 1.1 ratio. Last quarter they only did 1.05 according to 10Q and
had to sell stock-8 mill. This quarter is the same. I don't think they needed
to take these charges beyond their normal 70mill a quarter or so. Their
provision for loss was .36% of finacial revenues last quarter. The CEO said he
wanted to raise their reserves to .8% of financial revs which is historically
more normal. This would be 144 mill not 300mill using the Q3 figures of
1800mill for financial revenues. So they took extra 160mill. The losses in
their home mortgages are the extra probably but this is taking a bath that is
not necessary probably. Their previous 6% reserves should have been enough
since their losses have only been 10% total including the bad mortgages. The 6
% was used for only the good mortgages held for investment.. But we will get
the benefits down the line from this overreserving.

The charges against the mortgages held for sale are based on their results from
their sale so they are accurate. The remained held for sale is basically
manufactured housing paper and should be OK with the latest chargeoffs.

CIT is taking a bath in their provision for loss and 2008 should now be clean
and clear.

seem to be there.

I not aware of more emphasis on shorting, but that could be me, because I'm
also not paying much attention to media pundits who advocate this.

I am attuned to what - if anything - people - especially self-described value
investors - are willing to step up and buy now. Not options, but stocks. That
buying is important to me.

I don't see much buying, except by a few of us. I tend to believe I see more
selling or just holding back. I notice especially the out on stops. Or out
trying to raise cash. Which, because I may want to be a buyer of what others
are selling, I view as a positive. Of course, if I hold those same stocks, it
isn't now so much fun to have seen the person exit the stock two days earlier
and say 10 points higher.

I am guessing we will see more and more people say that the whole market is
going down, that an astute person can always find something to buy or sell, and
so why not go short? Those profits come so quickly in a down market. I have a
couple people around SI I use as contrary indicators, and when I start seeing
that is what they are doing (switching to active shorting) I will want to up my
buys. (On the assumption the market is near a bottom of some sort.)

I'm reducing my Mexico positions, upping my Brazilian.

I've followed CX for several years. Imo, it is very well managed, smart in
incorporating technology too in their factories and management control
structures (inventory,i.t., etc.) And their marketing is good also. For
example, in Mexico, they advertise and sell one bag at a time because
construction for many homes proceeds slowly as owners get funds for purchases.

I am guessing and betting that Mexico's largest oil field is in decline (for a
couple of reasons). This will reduce the government's revenues, and make life
tougher for the average Mexican. I add too that my guess that food prices will
increase as commodity prices increase for the average Mexican family. As a
consequence, I am outlooking a decline in CX revenues and/or in investor
interest in CX stock. (Aside. My corollary prediction is that Mexican influx
into the USA will increase as more and more Mexicans are forced to seek jobs
here.)

I've dropped CX to only a very small stub, and have today closed out remaining

PENN. As a value investor, I assume if a value stock decreases on no adverse
news, that would increase the margin of safety a new buyer has in coming into
the stock.

However it is very scary with buyouts. If the stock declines on no adverse
news, it becomes more of a concern that the deal won't be consummated, and the
insiders and big money well know this and are exiting. So to me, it's just the
opposite of value stocks: if the stock of the acquired firm declines
substantially before the buyout is completed, it is a signal that the margin of
safety has decreased (imo). As implied by Bart Hoenes' post here.

Anyway, thanks for posting info. on PENN, rllee. The key issue apparently is
"the unknown financing climate over the next five months (which) presents an
inherent risk."

As posted, I have a few shares, betting that the merger will proceed. I upped
my position a little today. The financing may or may not kill the deal, but
imo, the stock has dropped recently - from what I see - because it's in the
gaming sector, and all these stocks in this sector that I am following were

Possibly no riskier now than shorting at $40's. Different risk maybe. ABK could

At $40, seemed - to me - it was very hard to see the stock suffering too badly
-- lots of assurances by the sector that things weren't as bad as the
short-sellers were saying. Now we know things are very, very bad and it might
not take much to drop ABK from $5 to $2. That is a good percentage gain for the
shorter.

The thing for me though is why short at all? I understand one places one's
money in what one knows or is following or is interested in. Just that to me,
it seems there are so many attractive buys available now, I don't see the
attractiveness in taking a short position in ABK. (Talking about risks I mean.

I guess that the fear is now for a global recession. If - and I only say "if" -
BRIC gets dragged into recession with USA, the commodities and oil bull will
collapse. Since these companies were valued for "no more cycles", the possible
drop can be very steep. And don't look at the past P/Es, they would be
"top-of-cycle-does-not-mean-anything" P/Es in that scenario. In this scenario
oil may go to 50s and most investors - including us? - will not have cash to
buy the falling material/oil stocks.

Note that this is a gloomy scenario, but it is quite possible. There are some
indicators to it, like the shipping rate collapse mentioned on Dale's thread.
Right now, I would not bank on it happening, but that's just me. :)

Thanks for mentioning recent value buys here. Whether they arguably are value
stocks or not, whether they are buys now or not, it helps me to know that there
are respected people on the thread (aside: well, some of you all are respected
-g-)who are buying something in this down market. To me, this is about the best
time in several years to be buying value stocks, so I am buying, buying. Of
course, it's scary because the stocks are getting cheaper and cheaper, and
business and stock downturns seem like they're falling off a cliff. So stocks
are getting cheaper and cheaper, and IF - IF - they even recover,it could take
quite a while. Nobody knows.

Still, at least a few of us -- I'm guessing that even though over 1000 people
are reported to have this site bookmarked -- maybe there are only about 30 or
40 of us - at least a few of us have some capital and cojones (or the

Evercore Asset Management, LLC (EAM) is a registered investment adviser with
over $500 million in assets under management. We are long-term oriented,
contrarian investors, with a typical holding period measured in years. We
advise on more than 700,000 shares of Ambac on behalf of our clients. We wrote
to you last month to express our opinion, as a co-owner of the company, on the
undesirability of raising costly capital to preserve Ambac's triple-A rating.

We were extremely disappointed to hear yesterday's announcement that Ambac
plans to raise additional equity capital. When we first wrote to you about this
on December 21st, the company's stock was at $27 per share and we urged you not
to contemplate the issuance of additional equity in order to preserve Ambac's
triple-A rating. The notion of issuing equity with the stock now at a small
fraction of that late December price is simply absurd. It is impossible for the
value of future business to even come close to offsetting the dilution that
will occur. Municipalities are wrapping their bonds at the lowest rates in
years, and Berkshire Hathaway is entering the business. Even if these things
were not happening, it would still be impossible for new business to be
sufficiently profitable to justify raising new capital.

Furthermore, as we warned in our previous letter, there is no assurance that
further capital increases will not be required by the rating agencies even if
capital is raised now. Indeed, statements made by the agencies since we sent
our first letter, including announcements yesterday from Moody's and S&P,
suggest that further capital requirements are more likely than not. Ambac's
market value has now shriveled to a few hundred million dollars. The sale of $1
billion or more of new equity amounts not so much to raising capital as it does
to a sale of the company at an extremely depressed price.

It is time for Ambac to recognize that, in entering the structured finance
business, the company gambled its triple-A rating and has now lost that bet.
Attempting to buy back the triple-A rating by giving away most of the company
makes no sense. The business of triple-A guarantees must now be left to those
whose previous actions have not saddled them with both a need to raise capital
and a perception of potential losses of the magnitude that now causes Ambac to
be priced at a small fraction of its book value. All that can be done now is to
maximize the value of the existing book of business for the benefit of Ambac's
shareholders.

The value ultimately realized from the existing book of business will depend on
whether Ambac's historically strong underwriting skills have insulated
shareholders' capital from further losses. Unless Ambac is still massively
under-reserved for eventual claims, there is substantial economic value to be
captured even in a runoff scenario. Adding back the mark-to- market losses that
the company still claims do not predict future losses, adjusted book value
(which fully recognizes net unearned premiums and the present value of future
installment premiums) stands at roughly $86 per share. Against that
alternative, a proposal to sell a significant amount of stock at the current
price is unconscionable.

Even if claims ultimately amount to a multiple of Ambac's current reserves, the
value realized in runoff will far exceed the current stock price. If, on the
other hand, Ambac is massively under-reserved for eventual claims, then raising
additional capital amounts to simply throwing good money after bad.

From the standpoint of Ambac's current shareholders, the owners of the company,
there is absolutely nothing to be gained from continuing to attempt to maintain
a triple-A rating. It would be far preferable to go either into a period of
"hibernation" during which time the company would not actively pursue any new
business where a triple-A rating from all three agencies is required or into
outright runoff. Under either scenario, current shareholders could expect to
receive considerably more value for their shares than they would if they are
massively diluted by an attempt to maintain triple-A status.

We implore you to not raise equity or any other form of capital, and we believe
that other major shareholders agree with us. We are encouraged to see an
announcement this morning that you are reconsidering, and we hope that this
means you intend to accept the rating agency downgrades and the consequences
that follow. However, since you have not responded to our previous letter, and
your announcement this morning did not rule out raising capital, we feel that
our fiduciary obligations to our clients leave us no choice but to make public
our views on this in the hope of ensuring a stop to the destruction of
shareholder value.

We remain willing to engage in discussions with you at your convenience.

hedge on VCP is working quite well as I was able to lock in a sizable long term

Sold 1/3 position in ABB for a small profit. Company could be impacted on any
Global slow down and at current prices the PE is still high. Therefore there is
not much safety if sales soften and with such a small dividend, the price could
fall below $20 on any further sell off. I will look to add more shares around
the $18 price range.

Capital preservation is important in this market environment. I have 25% cash
reserves that I am ready to deploy on further market sell offs. I am looking
for another 5%-8% decline as the market trys to find a bottom.

What's frustrating is as the market corrects, my cash reserves (as a % of the
portfolio) increases but I see my paper gains disappear. Therefore, my strategy
is to add to several of my current holdings at lower prices and even add new
picks when the value opportunities present themselves. Holding good paying
dividend companies allows one to wait, collect the dividends and let the
price/value come to you.

I thought I'd really nailed it ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ACAS ) for a
position-growing trade by buying some at 29.34 yesterday and more at 29.44 this
morning and putting in a limit order to sell most of those shares at 29.94,
which it hit and just barely, making for a nice trade.

But I really screwed up the next one. Bought again at 29.54, expecting support
and a bounce at 29.50. Currently trading in the mid 28's, wiping out the
earlier gain.

Oh, well. This is one I really don't mind holding when I have (IMO) cheap

Thanks Paul, I will look at it...

its on my watch now.

my favorite penny bio (PPMD) - has moved down to lower range of its long-time
base. I would think if someone bought a few shares of this stock - even only
500 or 1000 and just forgot about them they could be well rewarded.

To me it represents the quintessential penny stock.

*New Frontier
*Low outstanding shares ( a tad over 4 million as of last report )
*Decent financials (as of last report - but me thinks even better these days)
*NO HYPE - in fact, you probably wont get any info from this company if you
call them - they are not shareholder friendly.
*IPO price of $5.00 back in the day with an all time low of around 8 cents.

What is really important to note is that the company has been around since the
80's and if you look at the reports they did file (under Celox Labs) you will
see that there was minimal dilution in the many years that they did report.
Mostly it was private placements at prices much higher than the stock is
currently trading at.

website is here: http://www.protidepharma.com

Does the company have what it takes to grow or attract a larger company for a
buyout? I'm not sure, but I could see being a buyout target from a larger
biotech company. Of course I'm chronic speculator and I'm probably wrong more
than right - its just that the right calls have been so rewarding!

Hi Jurgis - Not good for ABK or the Muni market.

RE:ABK - Insurer Of Bonds Loses Top Rating
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/18/AR2008011803592
html
From the article:"...NEW YORK, Jan. 18 -- Ambac Financial Group, the nation's
second largest insurer of bonds, lost its precious AAA rating from Fitch
Ratings on Friday over concerns that the company no longer had enough capital
to guarantee billions of dollars in debt now imperiled by the subprime mortgage
crisis...."

It look's like management was spinning out of control and had no exit plan in
place . . .

"...Ambac had said Wednesday it would strengthen its capital base by issuing at
least $1 billion in securities. A day later, however, the company said it
expected to report a loss of $5.4 billion on its portfolio of credit
derivatives and losses of another $1.1 billion on subprime mortgage securities.
Ambac also announced its chief executive, Robert J. Genader, had resigned. That
same day, Moody's Investor Service signaled it was also considering whether to
downgrade Ambac's ratings. Ambac stock plunged 52 percent.

On Friday, the company did an about-face, announcing that "market conditions
and other factors" had made raising capital "not an attractive option at this
time." ..."

=========================================================

This is going to trickle down to the municipal bond market that provides
financing to the state and city municipalities. Cities will have a hard time
refinancing their current debt or issuing any kind of new debt unless they can
get "quality" insurance coverage on their debt. To further compound their
financial problems, many of these municipalities are set up to fail as their
current tax revenues are falling due to a much lower tax base from decreased
property values.

Therefore, it is possible we may begin to see some defaults in many of the
municipalities. This could lead to a round of significant government layoffs
and deferred infrastructure and support service spending, that will ultimately
accelerate and deepen any recession we may already be in.

It does not look too promising unless somehow the spiral down in the "debt
quality" issue is nipped in the bud...quickly! The only possible bright side I
see is that we should see quite a few "value" bargains in stocks as more blood
hits the streets.

EKS

P.S. This Moody's statement last week does not help the problem either.

Moody's says overspending threatens U.S. debt rating
http://www.gata.org/node/5919
The United States is at risk of losing its top-notch triple-A credit rating
within a decade unless it takes radical action to curb soaring healthcare and
Social Security spending, Moody's, the credit rating agency, said on Thursday.

The warning over the future of the triple-A rating -- granted to US government
debt since it was first assessed in 1917 -- reflects growing concerns over the
country's ability to retain its financial and economic supremacy. ...

I dont agree with the article nor do I agree with your conclusions. Buffett is
entering the business and I imagine aig will expand. Certainly a
berkshire-hathaway aaa rating is worth something. My own sensibility is that I
would not want to own the rating agencies anymore. why should anyone trust
them? their models have now been proven false. I dont think anyone is ever
going to soley rely on a AAA rating by an agency anymore. This will mean more
employment for financial analysts.
However with respect to ABK I dont know why they would not attempt a rights
offering unless they feel that they are so tainted now that no one will accept
their gty anyway so they should lay off most of their staff and go into runoff
mode and that that is the best outcome for shareholders. Perhaps they could
sell their business without the existing portfolio to Berkshire Hathaway. As a
shareholder I could certainly live with that. I ll take some BRKB and the
portfolio runoff.

First of all, I have not looked at the financials of ABK, so take the rest with
a grain of salt. Actually, I am not sure even if looking at the financials will
help, since they probably don't disclose and don't yet know how much they will
need to pay out on their insurance.

IMHO, the announcement was somewhat positive to ABK if they don't have to go
BK. I.e. with the downgrade they will probably not issue new business and just
wind down the existing one as was mentioned in the investors letter to the
management. If their book is not complete crap and they manage to wind it down
while remaining in the positive territory on the balance sheet, they may come
out even better than if they raised $1b now.

I would not short or go long here though, since it's all a crap shoot from
here, depending how their insurance book winds down.

Regarding municipalities, it's not as bad as you would think, since BRKA is
going to start the insurance business. Yes, they will charge more and possibly
take only certain business, but the municipalities are not left with no way to
issue and insure debt. There were also articles that some places decide not to
insure their debt anymore - I don't have a clue how viable this is.

Now for the rest, we'll have to wait and see. USA is not in the best place
right now due to housing, credit, mortgage and budget deficit issues. On the
other hand though, the low dollar is making US more and more competitive
worldwide and overall economy is not that bad yet. I would not bet on a deep
protracted recession and bear market... but then I would not bet on deep
protracted recession and bear market in any case. ;)

You even see that in the ABK downgrade to AA. If it did not matter as you say,
ABK would not have made attempts to retain AAA rating. Ratings still matter and
they will matter in the future. As another example, try to start a muni bond
insurance company with a lower rating than AAA and you will see that ratings
still matter. ;)

I think that the rating agencies have consistently blown it:

Written by Reggie Middleton
Saturday, 15 December 2007
Okay folks, now its official! According to Moody's, you can now rest asured
that your retirement portfolio insured by Ambac is just as safe as those
insured by Berkshire Hathaway, et. al., - AAA safe! Moody's has spoken...

From WSJ.com:
"Moody's gave a tentative pass to the biggest bond insurer, MBIA Inc., by
affirming its rating late Friday but changing the outlook to "negative," in a
move sure to cause howls from bearish investors and sighs of relief from Wall
Street. Moody's also affirmed the triple-A rating of Ambac Financial Group
Inc., another major bond insurer.

Moody's update of its view of the bond insurers had been awaited because of
concern about the impact of troubles in the mortgage market on securities that
bond insurers cover. Bond insurers guarantee the principal and interest
payments on more than $2 trillion in debt, including securities that are backed
up by mortgages.

Both MBIA and Ambac are top-rated insurers, and both have announced moves this
month to boost their capital, which could help protect those ratings. This
month, a private equity firm agreed to provide up to $1 billion to MBIA, which
said at the time that it was also considering additional capital options. And
Ambac struck a deal under which it bought reinsurance for a $29 billion
portfolio."

Hmmm.
MBIA takes nearly a billion dollars in value losses on its portfolio in one
month, gets a 500 million dollar equity investment below current market price,
and an offer for another $500 million through a discounted right's offering,
which brings it back to where it was before it lost the $1 billion last month
(which was in trouble) and it gets its AAA rating confirmed??? Ambac buys
reinsurance from Assured Guarantee, a company in the same business as Ambac
taking very similar losses, and it gets to retain its AAA rating??? Doesn't
anyone see concentration risk and an uncomfortable amount of correlation here,
or is it just me?

Assured Guaranty reported a net loss of $115.0 million, or $1.70 per diluted
share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 compared to net income of $37.9
million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2006. The decline
in net income was primarily due to an after-tax unrealized mark-to-market loss
on derivatives (hey, isn't that what Ambac and MBIA said as well?) that was
announced by the Company on October 22, 2007 of $162.9 million, or $2.40 per
diluted share, on financial guaranties written in credit default swap ("CDS")
contract form. As of November 30th (38 days later), it reported that it has
after tax mark to market losses of $220 million. They are averaging one and a
half million dollars per day in value loss, with this rate bound to accelerate
in the very near future (they only had $1.6 million in 9/06 - that's a 200x
increase). The macro conditions that brought upon the CDS (paper) loss are
getting much worse, not better as the trend clearly indicates. About 70% of the
unrealized CDS loss stems from RMBS and CMBS swaps. Well, you know how I feel
about the residential market. Here is how I feel about the commercial market.
Things are about to get much worse. Despite all of this, AGO now accepts $29
billion of additional ceded risk from one of the most dangerous monoline
portfolios in the business. I am appalled!

I hear a lot of people crooning about this being only paper losses, and not
actual claims until payment is defaulted or missed or principal is actually and
materially impaired before maturity. Well, it is happening now, and in droves.
AGO's management laments on how they have minimal exposure and losses to direct
subprime liabilities, which appears to be true with a casual glance at their
reporting, but the devil is again, in the details. Aside from 75% of AGO's
mortgage portfolio being in the most toxic vintages of 2006 and 2007 (which
most likely will lead to problems down the line), they have a strong
correlation in product mix with Ambac, the company they just reinsured $29
billion of exposure. Ambac's loss exposure is stemming primarily from their
structure product and consumer finance guarantees, not their residential
mortgages, per se. Structured finance in particular is what got them in
trouble. There is no real loss history on this stuff, because it is brand new
and the losses that are being witnessed now are tremendous. Well, hazard a
guess as to where the majority of Assured's earned premium comes from? That's
right, structured finance. As of 9/30/07, it was 58%. Now, with the acquisition
of Ambac's risk, and of course depending on exactly what it was that was
actually reinsured (we don't really know yet, do we?) it will/can definitely
shoot upwards, significantly upwards. No matter which way you look at it, there
is a VERY high concentration of risk, especially in an area with no real
discernible loss history and the only real discernible losses being
significant. Compare and contrast to the actuarial loss histories used in life,
vanilla P&C, and health lines - we're talking multiples of decades (like 50 -
60 years+), not just a few years as in CDOs. That is REAL insurance. This new
fangled, financially (not so)engineered, structured product guarantee business
is gambling with shareholders capital, pure and simple - slot machines - Vegas
style!

I'm not trying to make it seem like AGO foolishly reinsured ABK's book. On the
contrary, AGO probably just took the best stuff from Ambac (they apparently
refused to insure CDOs), which really leaves the ABK shareholders worse off.
They also only insured $29 billion out of a much, much larger portfolio of
exposure. I am trying to point out the reduced value of reinsurance when there
is a high correlation of risk between the two parties. If I am sick and you
have the same disease, it may not be prudent for me to give you a blood
transfusion! Some risk will be retained through counterparty credit risk, or
put in simpler terms - two sick people sharing the same blood and calling it a
cure. Thus, in my opinion, the number $29 billion is misleading as to the
actual amount of risk transferred. Another example of this correlation is MBIA,
who actually owns 17% of their main reinsurer. Now, how is that truly
transferring risk? They are only transferring 83 cents on the dollar, and that
83% is further reduced by the amount of correlation in the insured portfolios
and losses - and there definitely is correlation, for their reinsurer took
losses for derivative mark downs the same quarter that MBIA did, and passed
them on to its parent companies, of which MBIA is one, along with General Re.
This monoline business model stinks, pure and simple.

AGO used capital to buy back shares in lieu of reserving for future losses
through '06 and announced a new buy back program going forward last month in
November to buy back more shares. Hey, why provision for losses when we can buy
back shares. That's what MBIA & Ambac did and look where it got them (this is
how I feel about buybacks). If you get a chance, look at these two cos. charts
at about the time they borrowed money to buy back stock. Look out below!!! But
wait!!! Just a few weeks ago, Assured then announces its intention to sell $300
million in shares to shore up its capital in its reinsurance division to go
huntin' for new business. Like Moody's, these guys are a fickle bunch. So, my
astute readers should ask, why didn't they just take the money that they used
to buy back the stock and simply reinvest it in their business to begin with???
Hmmm! Good question. Could it be that management did not have the foresight to
see this opportunity coming just last month. If so, what else did they "not
see"? I would suggest you look into the risk profile of their newest addition
to their portfolio.

Thanks to Moody's, the AAA rating moniker is now close to worthless. Either US
treasuries (the AAA moniker benchmark) just got a whole lot riskier, or Moody's
is full of it in assigning this rating so capriciously. Tell me, Boom Bust Blog
readers, which one is it? If I was a foreign investor or an investor that did
not have the wherewithal to perform my own credit analysis, I would absolutely
ignore the credit ratings agencies. If I have the time, I will actually
calculate the redundant risks and high concentration/correlation that did not
seem to deter Moody's from viewing Ambac as safe as US Treasury. Okay, folks,
now its official. According to Moody's, you can now put your retirement
portfolio in Ambac debt AS well as Treasuries, because it is just as safe - AAA
safe!

PS, the CDS market considers Ambac debt near junk to junk, but what the hell
would the collective knowledge of the market know.

(to Mr. Middleton's credit on 12/17/07 both MBI and ABK traded over $25)

(Unfortunately, I dont think its only the rating agencies that blew it. I
wonder how many people in government actually understand the reinsurance
industry I certainly lack expertise in that area but it seems clear that the
rating agencies did not do their due dilligence in their area. If you think
that they will get sued on their ratings on subprime, wait til some of muni's
start to default due to lower tax receipts and inability to obtain new
financing, as people no longer give credence to those AAA ratings. If I were
the Feds and the Treasury Id be having crisis meetings every weekend to try to
figure out what to do.)

TRMD presumably paid out one time dividend. Others definitely booked gains
through ship sales. You'd have to look at each company to see how much.

Regarding FRO, the answer is in the table you posted. Look at 2002 and you'll
see the answer how sustainable are their dividends. Last couple of years have
been total boom for shippers due to commodities/materials boom and growth of
BRIC. The jury is very much out if this will continue. Take a look at Dale's

shows the wisdom of being debt free - It is easy to get caught up with using
OPM, but it is clearly obvious now on how foolish it can be to do so. Grow
slower with little or no debt and survive or grow faster using a lot of debt
and potentially lose most if not all.

I pick debt free and growing slower. Now is the time to be buying

My parents..... never bought anything that they could not pay cash for.
Literally. Houses, cars..... anything..

That is how I was reared and I own two homes debt free... two cars... debt free
and owe no one one cent.

This is how I have lived.

Great..

Only thing.. I have a lot that is owed to me..by the market now...

Even after the '29 crash the market eventually paid back investors- depending
upon which average you look at- of course it took 25 years. If you bought July
1st 1929, at the peak, you would get back your money April 1st 1954 (I've done
no inflation adjustment). And you'd really get your money back sooner because
of dividends.

gosh its 10:00 am and I'm just reading about the market meltdown. I had a
pretty fun day (kind of like a day off) and then I read bad economic news. I
dont want the news to alter my good feelings :)
