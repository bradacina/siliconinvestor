Terry Maynard, re. EK? Too many negatives. (-gg- sorry.) Terry, what would be
your reason to buy it now?

----------------------

Stock is relatively cheap and perception is 'old economy' - that seems to be
for sure. Maybe the perceptions's wrong though. Therein lies a possible
opportunity.

I calculate fair value for EK at about $48 based on a quick scan of its numbers
and a formula I sometimes use (a formula that only sometimes works). So at 56,
off from recent lows at 53, it looks a little too expensive yet.

If it hits its low again I might be interested. Or if you can provide further
information.

Paul.

Asides:
My family has owned EK since George Eastman, the founder, gave stock to
employees (my grandfather). Almost all of it has been sold off, the last sales
mid '70's I believe, when my mom caught the top for a few years. I don't know
how mom's do that, but sometimes they can.

Nobody here seemed to like my pick of Polaroid on 12/19/99 as a possible
cyclical low ---(and after they announced they had the best selling camera in
the US (analyst negatives were: maybe a fad and sales yes, but profits only
maybe),--- but that pick and subsequent sale worked out profitably for me. Now
that PRD is moving back down again to those lows, I am considering it once
more. EK may also be nearing a cyclical low. Nobody knows, but I would not be
surprised.

From the last quarterly earnings release:

``From an earnings perspective, we continue to make significant strides in
reducing our costs and improving profitability,'' said Daniel A. Carp,
president and chief executive officer. ``We continued to reduce SG&A expenses,
while at the same time driving manufacturing productivity improvements which
more than offset increasing raw materials costs. Our competitive advantage is
the ability to leverage the increasingly efficient cost structure in our
traditional business to fund investments in our rapidly growing digital
business.

``While reported sales were flat, they were up 5% when adjusted for portfolio
changes and an adverse currency impact. We remain confident in our ability to
deliver on our top line growth objective of 6% to 7%, before exchange, for the
full year,'' Carp affirmed. ``However, if full year exchange rates remain close
to the spot rates at the end of March, we could see full year revenue growth
reduced by about a percentage point.

``Worldwide film volumes were up 8% for the quarter and photofinishing growth
continues to mirror film volumes, which says that people are taking and using
more pictures. At the same time, we gained significant market share in consumer
digital cameras during the quarter and Consumer Digital Services experienced
incremental growth as the volume of rolls scanned by our Qualex subsidiary
continued to show good growth. For the quarter, digital products and services
represented 23% of Kodak's sales, compared with 21% a year ago.

``With regard to future earnings, we remain comfortable with the First Call
consensus earnings estimates and expect to report earnings in the range of
$1.60 to $1.70 per share for the second quarter and $5.50 to $5.80 per share
for the full year."

And the forecast earnings for '01 are $6.23 which translates to a PE of 9 at
the current EK price of $556.13. I also see EK as gaining from the digital
camera/products business. Currently it is a loser, although losses declined in
the last quarter to $4m from $12m last year. The technology will only grow and
EK is going to be a leading player IMO.

JMHO.

months later negative info comes up about the stock and it immediately drops
75% and the convertible debt drops to 40. Is there anything that would preclude
the company from making open market purchases of the convertible debt at 40 and

More on the "new-low" thing. This is an issue every institutional value
investor debates every day. Where I come down is generally when a stock is at a
compelling valuation I buy it. I kind of try to practice what Buffett says -
pretend the stock market doesn't exist - treat an investment as buying shares
in a business. I don't think the guy buying the corner grocery store spends
much time looking at charts.

Though watching Mike for the last year make day to day decisions tells me
timing is not only important (duh!), but that there are ways to do it.

Something to think about: By definition, if you get the bottom on a stock, you
probably bought a new low. But the name of the game is not getting the bottom.
An experienced portfolio manager tells me over and over again - just get within
10-15% of the bottom consistently and you will be fine. Not that I have done
that, but thats the goal.

I tend to buy a full position once. If I don't have the conviction to commit to
a full position, I probably shouldn't be buying any. Occasionally I will start
a position intending to average down, as I did with SNH because I had no idea
how the stock would trade after the spinoff. Averaging down in stocks where
that was not the intention when I invested the first time tends to be a mistake
for me and I don't do it anymore, though it has worked on occasion.

Take Crane. I thought it was an attractive opportunity last August at 26,
though it was clearly in free-fall. I bought a position in one account I manage
at 24. Then I bought in another account at 18 a few months later. The stock was
still in free fall at 18 (it leveled off there after I purchased it). So the
decision was the same, but one I nailed the bottom and have a 60% gain in 5
months. But for this stock, the first buy wasn't bad either. I'm up 15% there.
That's fine.

Some of my best buys have been stocks in free fall (SLE at 14, BRKB at
1400-1500, Blair at 13), and some of my worst buys have been stocks in free
fall. Stocks I bought at support levels, some have worked, others haven't.

We all do this our own way, and the method that works for one person doesn't
necessarily work for another. I'm still not sure whether or not looking at
technicals helps me or hinders me. Part of me says just avoid technical
analysis altogether, the other part says "Like Mike...if I could be like Mike".

The silver price issue comes up every once in a while. But EK got through the
Hunt squeeze and other price rises. They'll come through the Buffett position
too. They better-EK's been been using silver for 100+ years, so they have - or
should have - a good handle on what their needs are and how to protect
themselves here. Also, I'm seeing a prediction that very soon digital pictures
will outnumber film (silver halide), so maybe EK Ag demand will be decreasing.

It's really just that EK is a metaphor for the "old economy" - paternalistic,
old, out-of-touch, isolated management with old technology and failed
diversification (chemicals, pharma, copiers). A high-tech company for earlier
generations, now maybe relegated to a niche market.

The stock reflects a lot of that though, and at some price point EK could be a

The reason I am not interested in Kodak is the reason many others are - digital

believe this is much more a threat than an opportunity. I am not at all
convinced that the new business model has the profit opportunities of the old
one, nor the competitive advantages. In fact, I am convinced of precisely the
opposite. Think about this for the moment. Digital photography is in its
infancy. Who is the leading producer of digital cameras so far? Kodak? no.
Fuji? No. Minolta, Nikon? no.

Scott, my global strategy is not changing. I try to buy near support and sell
when support is broken (i.e. new lows), so that lends itself to high turnover,
which I defended in an article on my site.

Recently I ventured a buy of INCY at 69 and the next day or so it was 82. I
sold it figuring there were other values, or I would buy INCY back. It fell to
73 where I bought again.When it hit 66 I bought some more. Now I intend to hold
it. That is one volatile stock, and it is hard not to take money off the table
when given to you, since chances are if it is given quickly it will be taken
back quickly. It is hard to shake the "I should be holding on like a good value
investor" mentality though. After buying at 73 it shot to 90 in a few days and
I held on for this very reason. Now it's at 71.

Fossil was a fundamental decision - my reason for buying was muddied by their
latest report, which I had trouble reconciling. Abercrombie broke what nascent
support it had developed. So when it went under 10 I was out. We'll see where
it stops. My strategy is simply not to wed myself to a stock, and to always be
open to new information. This is an art, independent of steadfast rules other
than my own, and contributes to high turnover. It doensn't change the type of
fundamental analysis I do before buying.

Re: INCY's business model, there is a salon article under my INCY description
at VSN that details it very well. It's an interview with the CEO. There is just
tremendous misunderstanding here. I don't see the NIH deal as anything close to
INCY giving away the farm. The database subscriptions are not going to be big
money makers. They provide some steady cash flow - enough to keep the company
actually cash flow positive last quarter despite negative GAAP income.
Management has shown itself to be pretty savvy in both finances and operations,
and that salon interview really clarifies a lot of points.

ALSC: I consider ALSC a value stock because the stock market value of its
underlying holdings exceeds ALSC's market cap. I bought ALSC when I looked at
it after you first mentioned it here.

ALSC is what I call a 'hidden value' stock. I've got a number of 'em like ALSC,
some have worked out well, but some have done very poorly.

1. Of course, as the market drops, the value of these companies' holdings also
drops, and so the holding company stock price tanks also.

2. In spite of the ease of multiplying the publicly known number of underlying
shares and the share prices and making the numerical comparisons to the holding
co. cap., the actual realizable value of the underlying stuff is difficult (for
me anyway) to figure. There's the likelihood or un-likelihood of a sale or
distribution actually occurring, the effect that dropping a large number of
shares of the often-illiquid underlying stock back on the market, and the tax
consequence of the chosen route - sale/distribution/spin off.

3. And not only might some of the underlying stocks of these companies be
illiquid, they may very well be of a nature that the market now finds
unpopular. For example underlying holdings in recent ipos, internet-related, or
companies with no revs/no earnings or of startups w/no history.

4. Sometimes, the underlying stock(s) show more power and movement (thus
relevance) than the holding company/its stock, so one may have to consider and
study the business model of more than just the one (holding) company.

In summary, here's an area of investing where (again -g-) I believe if one is
to play the game, it's better to be diversified among a number of such issues.
While I can point to several successes, I also am very aware that in the
mini-disaster-for-me department, I have Seagate (SEG) and Counsel Corp. (CXSN).
I'm adding to CXSN today.
About ALSC: ALSC might (and should) have room to rise further from its current
price ($22). But it's recently danced in the high teens several times; an
interested and patient investor might be able get a chance to purchase it there
once again.

I2, yes, interest rates play a part in how I value some companies. I don't use
discounted cash flow, but I do evaluate some, if not most companies that have
book value, using a generalized cost-of-capitlal figure (one size fits all,
which of course is wrong, but seems to be okay for my purposes). I up it when I
guess the overall cost-of-capital figure goes up (which it will if interest
rates rise). I've upped my figure about 100 basis points in the last six
months. Which means that some investments that I might have made six months ago
with the financial numbers they are showing now, I won't so readily buy.

Where increasing interest rates are more of a problem to me is when they offer
competition to stocks. This happens when my wife says we ought to consider
CD's, etc, and enough with the stocks already. I don't mind allocating/moving
funds to CDs at that point and I do it, but always, somewhere down the
holding-period road, I find what I consider absolutely great stock buys, and I
get frustrated when I can't buy them using funds which I've agreed to tie up in
CDs. At that point CDs or other 'bond' type investments suddenly look totally
inappropriate to/for me.

HBI has a market cap of about $70MM, net-net of $110 give or take.

They own 18 of their stores. Even a just $40 per square foot, and say $3
million a piece for land, you're talking about another $125 million in real
estate. Book value of the real estate is about $150MM, which the company says
does not greatly overstate nor understate the market value of the real estate.

So we've got a mediocre net-net at $2. That alone I probably would not buy. The
margin of safety (as well as the upside) looks a lot more attractive when you
think about another $4 per share in real estate value. At least that's the way

BONT, HBI, others

Funny, BONT's also been on my watch list for a couple of months. I don't see it
now as a net-net (i.e. selling much below NCA). But it does have some
attractive financials. I keep passing on it (lucky me -g- so far) because their
business - selling fashionable stuff in "secondary" markets-- to me means lots
of markdowns and inventory adjustments. So I'm shaky on trusting the value of
current assets. Although I believe the stock is undervalued and could turn
around from here.

Somebody mentioned HBI at 5 couple of years ago maybe. There wasn't much
enthusiasm for it and no takers that I recall (lucky us -g-). I've been
monitoring HBI since. The two HBI stores I have shopped in are in areas where
there didn't seem to be (or I just wasn't aware of) HD competition. I
considered that a positive. The stock bounces around 2 now. Anything under that
might be a trading buy entry point. Given the comments about the recent conf.
call (I've not listened to it), their strategy to change their business, and
the cost that will possibly entail, I'd not make any significant investment in
this stock (or any net-net stock for that matter.)

One stock I have as a net-net is IDG. It's a company with problems (of course),
but with IDG I can fool myself into believing it might work out okay. I
mentioned the stock here when I first bought (at $3). It's going now for about
$2 1/2. I'll want to add more if it drops another 1/4 point or so.

Another stock I've mentioned here and still have as a net-net is AWX which is
also selling below its cash value. I consider this one very much in the 'ugly'
category.

Good article in Barrons on MBIA and the muni insurance business. I own Ambac,
but it might as well be MBIA. Ambac stock was down 13% last year even though
they grew earnings over 20% and continue to beat numbers every quarter.
Insurance stocks are down for good reason in most cases - because earnings are
down and pricing is lousy. That is most definitely not the case in this sector
of the industry. Pricing was actually up last year.

Ambac is earning 15% on equity, with over 80% of its earnings etched in stone
(if they wrote no new business this year, they would still have those annuity
earnings), but it trades at about 11 times this year's earnings and 1.3 times
book value.

The valuation of FSA in a takeover last year underscores the undervaluation of
these stocks. The valuation of FSA, a smaller player in the industry, would
imply a value of about $75 a share for Ambac I believe.

Ambac I invested with no thought of selling for two years 1996-1998 and the
stock doubled. Since then I've been trading it. I buy below 50, double down
below 45, then sell above 55 and exit above 60. That has worked several round
trips. I am changing that strategy now - I've got my position now average cost
below 50 and will sell half between 55 and 60 and hold the rest for a run to
80. This one is long overdue to break to new highs given the way earnings have
been growing. There's always the chance of a takeover at 75 to make the
decisions much easier.

Adding today to position in Cleveland Cliffs (CLF).

Supplier of iron ore pellets to domestic steel producers. If not a great
business, it is nevertheless a business likely to exist - which can't be said
for some tech companies.

I like: stock at 8 year low and selling below book value, not too much debt,
relatively low price/sales.

I don't like: at this point dividend may not be sustainable, insider buying is
very small.

Are you buying anymore ANF at these levels. Either this company is completely
oversold or I am missing something (probably the latter). I had the same
thoughts when BRKB was hitting $1390.00. Of course ANF is no Berkshire, but
wouldn't you think there will be a strong come back at some point?

What are your thoughts?

Also bought more EBSC yesterday. Picked up 1500 shares at $4.25. Today there

David,

I looked at the Yahoo posts referenced by you. Both
bull and bear analysis is very amateur, but I won't say
mine is any better. ;-)

Regarding bull case:
you can't do 10 year discounting on a cyclical fashion
driven business. Especially with twenty tweaked
variables. I know one spreadsheet that croaks over
if you input current ANF ROE, market cap and
shareholder's equity (nudge, nudge Mike :-)))).
It's telling that at this ROE, the annualized rate
of return will be more than 40%. Forget about it - it's
a starry eyed scenario. For much better
bull case look at Mike's writeup at valuestocks.net

Regarding bear case: Stock making new lows is not
bearish. I cannot comment on management, though
James Clarke here mentioned that they are trustworthy.
Slipping same store sales and inventory buildup
is bad, but is it bad enough? There was quite
reasonable Fool writeup recently.

Now we come to the crux of the matter: fashion.
Are they have beens? Difficult to tell. It has
happened both ways. Look at Gap. In 1995-6, I was
looking at them. Everybody was saying that there is
no growth, that they are losing it, etc. They have
survived and flourished. But then, some other
stores were not so lucky. One more thing about
Gap: compare their recent report to ANF's. I may be
wrong, but I don't see where ANF is worse. So I think
that ANFs stock is down too much.

If I was an ANF bull, I would watch two things:
SSS and inventory. Plus the breakdown of their
successes/losses. Only close your eyes and wait for
September/October. June and July won't give any
clear indications. From what I see right now, they
have consistent trouble with women's line.
However, the men's line and kids stores are
very successful. If you have access, read sell-side
analyst reports. They are better than 99% of the
Yahoo drivel. This is retail, not .com and the
analysts are pretty knowledgeable. Forget their
ratings though.

If I was patient, I would also buy
it in July-August, before the back-to-school season
and 4th quarter. Most likely the stock won't recover
before then, though there may be some trading
opportunities.

Good luck

I also like T, Mike makes some good points on his web site analysis, although
I'm not sure if I can follow valuing AT&T wireless at 53 billion (yeah I
understand the market math, but honestly AT&T wireless doesn't seem to have
that much market hold compared to Nextel & Vodaphone). But in any case I traded
in my shares of UMG since I now realized that it's actually a better deal to
have T than UMG (unless I missed a revaluation, last I heard it was $30 cash
plus .95 shares of T).

Actually, I really don't care much about T's fundamentals, technicals or
anything except that AT&T has the best chance at making a run at local service
and broadband over cable. I'd also consider T a core holding for long-term
(that's why I don't care much about their other fundamentals). I had been a
holder of UMG and TWX since 98 and 97 respectively after being a Roadrunner
subscriber (and since sold TWX when I heard I'd have to get AOL instead, damn I
hate them).

Also, I was just curious how everybody's portfolio is performing so far this

It might be productive for one to spend some time getting to know Nacco
Industries (NC) very soon. The stock got dropped from the S&P (leaving next
week) and the stock sold off on the announcement.

Make sure you read the footnotes carefully regarding the debt on the balance
sheet. It is not nearly as high as it appears to be. The way I adjust the
accounting, the stock is trading below 3 times EV/EBITDA and less than five
times earnings adjusted for goodwill with the company saying recently that they
expect earnings to begin to recover in the third quarter.

I would be very careful with FMO because of the balance sheet. I have looked at
this many times, and just can't understand the earnings power because of all
the deals. It could be a double, but there is no margin of safety with so much
debt, so it could also be a zero. I wouldn't short it, but I also wouldn't buy
it.

Trinity (TRN), on the other hand, is also a cyclical with earnings on the way
down but with a stellar balance sheet. I think this will be a double for a
patient holder with limited downside from here. If you look at the stock chart,
would you ever guess that railcar orders have been UP sequentially in each of
the last three quarters? I think trough earnings for the stock are in the
$2.50-$3.10 range. With the stock trading at 23 and this balance sheet, they
don't get much better than that.

it may already be reflected in its share price. KSWS, perhaps facing lower
earnings this year than last year, has been buying back its shares, has no long

$5.68 cash behind every share (shares trading now about $13.) Also, I notice

Papaya King: re. your question: "Do you have any favorites among the steels?"
That's an interesting and more complex question than I first supposed. My
reactive answer is all the steel stocks are ugly. There are no favorites. They
mostly are all near lows (the ones I look at or own anyway) and when (if) one
rises (assuming it's not for a buyout) they may (imo) all be rising in tandem,
so choosing a favorite "best" might not be necessary.

I see that your STLD is a mini mill operator. I'd guess most people would
consider NUE the mini mill leader. It's trading at lows only seen once before
in the past six years. A competitor to STLD is BS. I like BS at its current
price. It's under 4-- That looks like a 30 year low. In the past, people who've
bought BS around 10 and held for a few years have seen a double. Right now
though, it looks like the capital intensive nature of the business has caused
Bessie to increase both number of shares outstanding and amount of long term
debt. That's scary (to me) and the reason I hesitate to start a position.

If you consider steel stocks now because they've been hitting lows, then
there've been a number of possible selections -whx, ltv, rou, et. al -from
which you might choose. I've had SCHN on my watch list waiting for it to drop a
bit more.

Right now, although I own a few steel stocks (e.g. AKS) I'm wondering if the
opportunities aren't better with suppliers to the industry. Their stocks are
down near lows also. Two that I own are UCR and CLF. (Also trucker BOYD, an
intermediary between steel companies and their customers.)

fwiw
and note, since I'm the only one so far responding to your question: If this
post reads like I actually know something about the relative merits of
individual steel stocks or know about the steel industry, well I don't. And
even worse, I have been wrong many, many times before.

away in my lifetime. It would appear that BS is going to turn the corner next
year, but a recession, IMHO, could easily overshadow their plans. Perhaps a
weaker dollar could benefit US steel companies since it would work against
foreign importers. BS really gave a good fight in the $5 range but, as you

Yet another way to look at SNH:

To review, this is a REIT with several high quality tenants and a bunch that
are bankrupt. The dividend was cut from $2.40 to $1.20, the $1.20 being the
cash flow supported by the high quality tenants. They still own the properties
for the rest, and they are being restructured. Within a couple quarters, the
dividend is going to go up to $1.60-1.80 in my estimation. The stock has been
trading around 9.

What if we look at it this way. What if all there was was the Marriott and
Brooksdale leases? $1.20 of high quality dividend income. I'd buy that for a
10% yield. So that's $12 of value, with the half of the company in flux for
free - actually better than free since the stock is trading well below that
$12.

Patience. I'm still buying little by little, as I have been since December. A
lot has happened since December, and I have more conviction though the price is
lower. They don't get much better than that for patient value investors. And
damn is it easy to be patient while you're collecting a dividend like this. My
average cost is down to about 9 3/4. If you're looking for an entry point, I'd
say 9 is where you buy.

Jim, my take on Alico (ALCO) is that it is a Florida business 51% owned by the
Ben Griffen family. It is a farming/ranching operating company in southwest
Florida with about 140,000-150,000 acres of land. These parcels are difficult
to evaluate - impossible for me. Some are near growing communities, some more
distant. Mr. Griffen apparently runs the company his way, so there is the issue
of owner/control vs. the small shareholder.

Several land sales have been announced. Some of the sales do not have
definitive closing dates. (They will go to 2001 or beyond.) It's unknown to me
what Alico will do with the proceeds from those sales.

ALCO is a stock that is chronically undervalued. And imo, very likely to remain
so. To me, it's not a matter of determining the fair value of the underlying
assets. There've been analysts that I recall from the mid '80's on saying the
thing is undervalued (e.g. A Mr. Lily from one of the regional brokerage firms
then who was a specialist in valuing these things, & Marty Whitman within the
past couple of years.)
As an indicator, I'll guess fair value might be about $22-50. (That seems
pretty safe -gg-.) The stock's going for about 15+.

I look at ALCO as limited upside and limited downside. What I see is a stock
which has some support due to the assets of the company. Buying close to 15 to
me means there is a chance to see yet again 18-25, a range of prices that one
has often seen with this company.

Aside. Perhaps it's best to be diversified with these Florida real estate
companies. And so I do own CTO which I purchased after it showed up in the
media and here in Feb. as a possible Warren Buffett holding. I'm also looking
now at Avatar Holdings (AVTR) which is partly in Florida.

compared to 10-12x revenues for most DSL companies. It is also winning business
right and left. The fact that the stock has rebounded so sharply after a recent

James,

I have a value oriented stock broker friend that is constantly touting me on
ALCO. He owns a large position.

I spend a lot of time in Ft Meyers and have actually driven up and down Alico
Road to take a look at the land.

Lots of cows :-)

Seriously, the story was that they owned a lot of land near where a university
was just developed. They had donated the land where the university was built to
the state.

So one would expect a significant appreciation in the value of the land
surrounding it. My friend is constantly throwing out huge values based on his
conversations with management.

I casually looked at the numbers, various land sales the company did etc... a
few years back. I may have even touted Alico as a possible value on this thread
quite awhile back when I was researching it.

I never bought it though because it seemed to me that the controlling
shareholder was not particularly anxious to realize the value if it is in fact
as high as some people believe. He sells a little from time to time and
distributes it as an extra dividend. I suspect there's value there, but I will
remain an observer unless I see some indication that something is going to
happen soon.

The other suggestions I laid out last year, SFY, T.BKP, PETD (I think Bash

most of now, however, are PRZ and PYR. Of the two, PRZ remains significantly
undervalued at around 20.

E still has room as well, as does T.BKP.

I'm beginning to look for the next macro play to rotate into once energy has
run its full course. But for now, energy is still un noticed the retail
investor and there's no need to sell anything while the one year ng strip is
setting records.

My best candidates for a move up this summer is silver.

The best candidates for another big macro move down are the financials and pc
manufacturers. CPQ, DELL should both trade in the teens if fair value was

An interesting way to play steels is the graphite electrode business, which is
dominated by one company that currently seems relatively cheap. They have net
negative equity thanks to a huge charge taken against earnings back in 1997,
and continue to to be affected by lawsuits. But they recently restructured
debt, shaving 200 basis points off previous rates, and have announced price
increases. I like their reason:

We continue to see strong order demand for graphite electrodes. We believe that
graphite electrode manufacturing capacity utilization rates in the free trading
markets are approaching the 95%level. We also believe that these high operating
rates are beginning to cause shipment/scheduling difficulties for some of the
other producers. As a result, we have announced a price increase of $150 per
metric ton for graphite electrodes sold in Western Europe, Middle East, North
Africa and Asia Pacific(excluding Japan), effective for all orders booked on or
after April 3, 2000.

Mario Gabelli has had several of his investment arms buy decent stakes, and
there is a good amount of insider buying. All this occurred at prices above
recent prices. Gabelli has not yet invested his own money. I find that when he
does that, usually a bottom is near. But I'm likely to take a position in UCR
anyway due to their pricing power and misunderstood/hard to understand
financials.

Another interesting one to watch (and one Gabelli also owns) is WHX. An early
favorite here on the Value Investing thread, several of us doubled or tripled
our money. Like a good value investment, it has round-tripped back to the 5's.
New lows recently. Has shown the ability to jump quickly. But extraordinarily
leveraged. As I mentioned on my web site, an interesting one to watch from the
sidelines.

Good investing,

Wow, National Presto. I think all value investors must become acquainted with
it sooner or later, just so they can watch it and see how stale a value stock
can become. It's always on my list. At least they are starting to buy back
stock. But there's no growth. I'm sure Paul or Jim could tell the story of
National Presto better than I.

Re: SYMC, believe it or not, it's in my forget-about-it file right alongside
Clayton Homes and Senior Housing. I don't spend much time worrying about it.

I think you put "AT & T" next to "wireless", and give them the capital power of
AT&T (as evidenced by the Cellular One acquisitions), you get something that
can be every bit as powerful as Nextel or Vodaphone in time. You've hit the
head of the nail - it's a core long-term holding from these prices IMO, and the
reason is that it is AT & T and where it sits at the juxtaposition of the
communications venues.
The conversion opportunity for digital cable is huge. As a personal anecdote,
I've converted, and ASAP I'm going to an AT & T/Excite@home cable modem.

Re: National Presto. I'd point you to the reason National Presto dropped to its
cash value (I think) - Nacco (Proctor Silex) just bounced them out of Walmart.
That is not the reason to be buying Nacco now, but there are plenty of others.
Anybody want to do some work on it and take me up on a discussion I'm game.

National Presto is a stock every Graham value investor looks at once a year. It
usually trades at a small premium to its cash balance, with management that
could care less where the stock trades. Pays a big dividend. I wouldn't buy it
because there is just no significant upside here - there's probably no risk
either. $30 of cash trading for $30 sounds attractive, if there are other
assets worth 15 or so, but in my view the other assets are worth single digits.
So even if management got religion, you don't stand to make a whole lot of
money. If I want to buy $30 of cash for $30 and collect a 6% yield there is a
much easier way to do that - just keep the $30 in cash in my own account.

A few teasers on Nacco (NC).
1) Read the footnotes, and you'll back out about half the debt. Debt is 325
million, not 600 million as it appears.
2) Adjusted for the phantom debt, multiples are 3.1x EBITDA, .3 times sales, .6
times book.
3) There is about $2 of goodwill amortization in the earnings. Add that back
and you're looking at about 4.5 times earnings, and those are absolutely not
peak earnings - they may even be trough if you believe the company's recent
guidance.

No analyst coverage, weird company, and there are plenty of warts.

The stock is over 75% off its (admittedly crazy) high.

Its not a great company, but its not an awful one either.

I started buying a few weeks ago in the mid 40s and am delighted that the stock
dropped 8 points on being bounced from the S&P (tomorrow the stock should trade
about 10 million times its average daily volume). Though I doubt the price goes
significantly lower. My price target is 75-100. The stock trades at 38.

Here's a question for the group.

Assume you bought a stock you believed was undervalued. Let's say subsequently
the business fundamentals confirmed your view.

How long on average did it take for the stock to reach what you considered to
be its "fair value" give or take?

Selling aggressively today into the market rally. Rooted again through my
mother's mutual fund portfolio looking for anything that is moving as if it
owns a lot of technology. I thought I had sprayed for those in March, but I
found one large position that had survived. Bye.

Also threw in the towel on Homestake Mining. It is just slowly dawning on me
that the valuation prices in $325 gold and gold ain't trading at 325. And there
is absolutely no protection on the downside if the stock decides it wants to go
down again. I've made a few bucks in it - its something I never should have
bought. Purely speculative.

Jim Clarke, re NC, Nat'l Presto, AMR, Mrs. Clarke, etc.

I added again today to my position in NC. This was before I saw your comments
about NC in the previous National Presto post.

National Presto is a stock indeed familiar to Ben Graham fans (as in the
National Presto analysis in Intelligent Investor, 1973). And I agree with your
conclusions about the stock now not being such a good value, even though it is
safe with so much cash backup.

Jim, I like your analysis of NC better than mine. Still, from my perspective,
one gets a conglomerate not in great businesses, but nevertheless, a company
that:

raises dividends every year (for the past 6 years anyway),

sells now at 1/2 stated book value, when it mostly has sold for stated book
value or better,

sells for a psr of .12 when it mostly has sold for a psr of .19 or more,

sells for 2.3x ebitd,

saw the chairman buy $1.3M of stock (@$53+ per sh.) last December. (NC trades
under $38 now.)

is made a "legitimate" candidate for value investors because alleged value
investors Ruane, Cunniff, & Co.,Legg Mason and Franklin Resources have
positions in the stock. (Or maybe THEY are the ones now selling to me and
others?? -g-)

I'm going to assume value investors here have already at least scanned this
company and have made their initial decisions whether it is suitable for their
portfolios. And my intent is not to tout this stock. I've been adding from mid
60 on down, my position is very,very small- I just have wanted now to increase
it to very small. I do want to give my opinion though (yet again -g-) that it
seems to me (without having any real facts) that when two alleged value
investors come to the same conclusion about a stock, but come at it from
different perspectives, different analyses, then that stock could very well be
a darn good buy. NC 'maybe' and 'possibly' might be such an instance. My
anecdotal evidence is J. Bash and P. Senior regarding SEMI. Perhaps M. Burry or
J. Clarke et. al. regarding WHX. I separate this from the "Rule of 3" wherein 3
posters buy a particular stock (ANF for an example), but generally focus on the
same attributes/indicators/fundamentals.

------

I've taken more profits today, selling a tiny amount of LHO (just to free up
some cash for other purchases), and a little THX (recommended for purchase by
Archimedes, and which was one of the very few instances which I have considered
as a "can't lose" bet, and which actually has so far worked out that way.
Mostly my "can't lose" buys turn out to be real horrific losers).

With these funds, I'm starting to up my tiny position in American Airlines
(AMR), and I've decided to bet more and follow Mrs. Clarke and add a tiny bit
more to my already relatively large position in Bristol Myers (BMY). (When the
stock is down my position seems totally huge, woe is me, why do I own so much--
and when the stock is up, my position just seems sooo small, I just don't own
anywhere near enough).

all fwiw, I've been wrong many,many times before, but I am hoping you and your
Mom are right.

Paul.

Yeah, Mike, we are positioned very differently. I am holding more cash than I
have held at any time in the last year. I am even selling REITs. I am tempted
to short techs, but I got burned so badly doing that before (even though the
two stocks I was short fell 80 and 90% - of course that was after they hit my
stop loss point for about five minutes, enough for my trades to happen.) No
mas.

You might want to pick up a copy of John Neff On Investing. Nothing profound or
groundbreaking, but a wonderful read.

And Mike, John Neff may be even more contrarian than you. Its close though. He
likes to say he "would argue with a signpost". In that spirit, UCR should work
out quite well for you.

In Neff's contributions to the Barron's roundtable I've found nothing
interesting, and even a couple rather simple-minded statements or two, so I
never thought to buy the book. But with your rec, I might.

I don't believe it. I don't believe there's anyone more rationally contrarian
than me. There's nothing like picking a fight.

Jim, I just don't believe in top-down market-timing anymore. As long as I can
find enough contrarian values to fill my portfolio, I'll be fully invested. A
few times in the last few years they seemed to dry up and my cash levels rose.
But those periods didn't last. If a period like that does last, then I might be
convinced the market is in for something. But I'll let the bottom-up approach
tell me that.

Sorry Mike I'm half way between you and James.

Sold 1/2 positions in INCY, SYMC, NITE yesterday.

Added to my small position in AINN on thursday. I believe that AINN may be a
good tech value play. They are extremely profitable, have had an agreement to
sell products through Lucent. And most important, it's another Ohio company
that I've had a chance to visit. :) Also, I am personally holding off
purchasing more until it pulls back a little. The last 2 days of NASDAQ action
were a little to strong for me to believe profits won't be taken soon.

I'm just curious if anyone has better insight than I on a situation from
Friday. Cendant closed at 4:00 around 13, but at 4:18 an after hours trade came
through for 500 shares at 10 1/2. Was this just some bonehead that put a market
sell order in that somebody took advantage of? Or is there some possible other
explanation? Note: I do hold a position in CD at $13. (how could I possibly
pass it up at a price they haven't seen since the accounting problems, as I see
it, it can't get much worse than that).

About BBR--Generally decent ROE, slight sales growth, dividend increases, low
psr, stock price near its low for the year. Would've liked to have seen some
insider buying here though. Co. has authorized a 750,000 sh. buy back of its
small capitalization (6.64M sh.).

Aside: taking some profits today on some of the stocks I've mentioned here in

I don't think I'd be too concerned about an economic slowdown for CX. Mexico
has been on an economic slowdown for centuries. I am a holder of both CX and
LAF.

I don't think we've seen much of a slow down in commercial construction yet,
and heavy highway construction is on the rise...so I'd have to say an economic
slowdown shouldn't have much of an effect on cement manufacturers as a group.
Also, more importantly I feel that the anticipation of an economic slowdown in
the US has already been factored into the stock prices.

Also, I bought an initial position in SNH yesterday and doubled up today.

Also bought TRN because of 2 really lame reasons 1) with gas prices continuing
to remain high, what better way to ship than by rail? If that's so, rail
spending may increase. 2) for profits on one of their smallest division
(highway construction products) to help offset the cost of guardrail products I
buy from them at insane prices.

Hi Guys,

An old favorite that served me well was New Holland. Currently completing their
merger with Case to become Case-New Holland (CNH). I have recently bought back
in during the latest dip. The annual meeting has brought a dividend and a

offerings in general or this one in particular.

The input from this thread has helped me with this one. Thanks for a great
