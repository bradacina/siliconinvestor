I don't believe you mentioned IR here, Suma, at any of the several times it was
discussed.

I show I have a few IR shares bought in Sept at about $34, a further smaller
add in Oct at $21. I also did not have confidence to buy more at $15 or below,
and I'm not willing to add more shares now either, although I hold hope for a
higher price than current $21.86.

"But if we go into major construction IR pumps compressors are always in play."
I see it that way also. I assume beneficial for other companies'
pumps/compressors/motors too. So I set myself up with buys of BEZ, RBC, RBN and
other diversified industrial manufacturers. Not willing to add more shares at
current prices though.

My top 5-ish positions remain the same: GTE, BRK, OXY, GLW, NOK, CHME, GPOR.

I have spent some time looking more in depth at GLW and discussing it with
other people. The biggest question is long term situation with LCD business. If
LCDs get commoditized and margins significantly drop, GLW could lose a
significant part of sales and income. The likely scenario is that future growth
in LCDs will come from low cost, lowish quality uses in developing countries.
In other words the growth will be from bottom tier that is subject to Chinese
manufacturing competition. GLW will counter with great R&D and perhaps new
product categories. The company has always had great businesses and transitions
to new high-margin products. Its issues were mostly lawsuits and not losses
from bad business decisions. So there is a chance that it will handle future
LCD transition pretty well. Company has a great balance sheet and its joint
ventures are well capitalized as well. That's a huge advantage here.

The stock was an obvious buy at the bottom, but less so here. I should not be
posting my thoughts one day before earnings announcement that is likely to move
the stock up or down by double digit percentage. :) However, I don't think that
last quarter matters a lot. It obviously was bad. The question really is the
long term competitiveness of LCD business and possible future businesses.

In terms of buys and sells recently, I have not bought much. I have trouble
chasing stocks up here and my cash position is still pretty low (about 10% of
assets), so I don't really need to buy here.

I got rid of remaining IR position possibly way too low. I sold my remaining
bit of WSC and I'm holding only BRK now. I decided not to buy LUK, since it is
quite opaque, so it is a faith investment. I am trying not to get into faith
investments that much nowadays. ;) I bought tiny position in UL and added a
tiny bit of JNJ.

Thanks, appreciate the BDX opinion Speculatius. I'm reevaluating my opinion and
preference. Trying to look closer at what the capex is that hospitals cut or
might cut (I assume new purchases of expensive equipment), and what that might
mean for BAX vs. BDX. Versus the consumables that BDX/BAX sell, which I assume
will still see decent demand.

Hospital capex reductions have two roads: If the reductions are deferred that
is one thing. If the reductions are permanent cutbacks, that is something else.
The former just defers the sales that BDX/BAX/ABT etc. will get, and if I have
patience as a stockholder, I can live with that.

re Hospital capex. I believe there will be Capex delays with hospitals. A lot
of hospitals have cash flow problems due to the flood of uninsured people that
go in hospitals and that cannot pay. Having said that, i believe that to be
temporary. The Obama administration will bolster health care spending overall
and i believe preventive care (screening, diagnostics) will be in the sweet
spot because they are cost efficient, IMO. Also there are no excessive margins
in this sector like with drugs (90%+ gross) or orthopedics (80+% gross).

I do some business with companies from this sector in my job and have not
noticed any pullbacks. Also there is a fair amount of well capitalized upstarts
and incredible new science that will translate into new products in this
sector, so i assume some folks think that this a place to be in.

Hi Spekulatis - Any new opinion on CENTERPOINT ENERGY(NYSE: CNP). They missed
on earnings due to some losses on natural gas inventory write downs. Company
has lots of debt but seems to generate sufficient cash flow to service it. They
operate in a regulated business so future cash flows s/b pretty stable. BV
according to Yahoo is around $5/share. The company owns and operates
electricity line, ng pipelines and storage facilities and several miles of
underground transmission lines.

It seems like the company is set up to benefit from the electrical grid
upgrades promoted by the Obama administration.

Stock is trading near a five year low but their debt load is quite large even
for a quasi-utility. CNP's current dividend yield is 7% ($0.76/year). Company
says it will earn $1/05-$1.15 in 2009. It's hard to see this when they reported
$0.19/shares vs $0.36/share.

What's your take?

April 28 (Reuters) - Corn Products International Inc (CPO.N) posted a 74

margin, hurt by higher net corn costs, foreign currency translations and softer

great allocator? If Mr. Gates is on the board, guiding the company but not
making capital allocations, then who will make those allocations when Mr.
Buffett leaves? We don't know. Which makes it difficult for both the long and
the short holder. For the short, because if the new person says he can't really
allocate incoming billions like Buffett so he will change the allocations to
include making a dividend and/or making BRKA stock buy backs-- then that might
signal a buy signal that the stock is undervalued.

Madharry -
any idea how to handicap the bank stress results due next week. the delay until
Thursday can only mean that the results are not to the liking of the bank
chiefs, so they need more time to respond. Though i wonder if the response
matters since Geithner and co. already said that they are going to do what they
want to do.

Bloomberg has an article that said that 6/19 banks did not pass, which ones
might that be: FITB, STI, KEY, RF, C, BAC are the losers but who knows/ I think
only GS, JPM and MS are home free. The banks that won't pass have a few month
to raise capital but how are they going to do that with the government driving
the bus? So I guess the government injection/conversion will have to do which
means that conversion will occur at the share price at 2/9 minus 10% (estimate
of reasonable discount). For BAC that would be 6.3$, C -3.6$, USB 15$, KEY
8.1$. Most of those prices are above todays close.

Another aspect to consider is that the Chrysler deal shows that the government
does not care to much about claim seniority principles either. This means that
the owner of preferreds, Trust preferreds and possibly even debt may have to
bring "sacrifices" as well. It's like those George Orwell novels where nobody

I may be the wrong person to ask. I dont understand this insistence upon
looking at tangible common equity as opposed to projecting the future cash flow
and treating preferred the same as common equity. Its ludicrous to me that
banks are suddenly not given credit for having a stable customer base of
deposits either or business that generate predictable cash flow. for example
mortgage servicers or credit card transaction processors, or even trust
departments. suddenly these operations are worthless? I am concerned that this
arbitrary yardstick is going to cause needless distortions in the economy if
banks are forced to disgorge units that generate stable cash flow simply to
satisfy some foolish incompetent regulator. I would have much rather see them
focus on regulating the types of business banks can be in ie. derivatives and
the whole alphabet nightmare that Mr. Geithner seemingly has failed to have a

Water companies as a Water Works Monopoly square? Ha -g-, yes. Very good.
That's exactly what I am doing. Buying or selling the squares. Mostly holding
my positions in railroad companies, building on Electric Company with electric
utility companies if stock prices will hold steady. For hotel square, I've
mostly sold out. Housing stocks (Ventnor Ave,etc.) only one US builder (two
Brazil); on a few property squares I've got a few reits. On Atlantic Avenue
(gambling), I only have SGMS there now. Income Tax square has been hugely
volatile. Landed there in '08 with enormous '07 taxes paid. This April,
accountant found '08 income tax to be negligible.

Deep Down Receives Deepwater Project Orders
Monday May 4, 2009, 8:00 am EDT
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Deep-Down-Receives-Deepwater-prnews-15116599.html
.v=1
From the article:"...Deep Down received its largest loose-tube steel flying
lead order to-date for a deepwater oil & gas development off the west coast of
Africa. With much of this development in more than 8000 feet of water, Deep
Down's deepwater service team will supply more than 30 of its innovative
loose-tube steel flying leads along with associated subsea components. The
order requires first delivery in mid-July 2009, with completion by October
2009...."
==========================================================
The stock should move higher as long as new orders keep coming in. It's
interesting to see that their orders are not exclusively with PBR off the coast
of Brazil but now their reach is into the west coast of Africa.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Brazil companies are approaching new recovery highs. Hopefully the bottom for
these stocks was made in March.

bloomberg this am had an interesting interview with Dick Bove, a well known
bank analyst. He pretty much said that the US Treasury was running a circus-
they were leaking info to the wall street journal to guage what the response
would be, and adjusting their proccess accordingly. Nobody had heard of
tangible common equity until a year ago, where as there was already an
internationally agreed upon standard signed off on by 95 countries including
the United States called tier one capital. You could see the disdain he felt
for the current US Treasury administration, which is shared by me.

It seem to be trading above the prices recently offered to YA Global
consistently. While there ultimately will be more shares out, the Co. will also
have more capital and the YA Global shares being acquirred are subject to a
pretty long lock up agreement.

With all the shippers up, and everything else and his brother moving up, I
still think there is some value in ONCF.

FWIW, I'be been increasing my stake in OLP and FCH. Some analyst in Baron's
called FCH a zombie and a Bankruptcy candidate , but I doubt zombies would be
opening up new projects like the one below.

Hi Paul - I followed you into a small position in Black Hills Corp. (BKH).
Seems like a good value proposition based on their current PE at 7.25 with a
dividend yield over 7%. This company should do well in an inflationary
environment with their coal, ng and oil interests operated through their
subsidiary companies. Their utility component should provide a steady income
stream with (regulated) price increases allowed to help finance their two new
NG electrical generation plants just approved.

Black Hills. Still holding. Sorry I did not buy EEQ EPD when you guys discussed
them here recently. Missed a couple of good opportunities with these. As I say,
for me, I'm apprehensive about stepping in now after watching recent large

will likely pass again, and maybe again wrongly so. -g-

Gas utility SWX - bought two batches today at 19.8$

While P/E is not that low (they did have some extraordinary items that reduced
profits) normalized profits should be around 1.9$/share. I was attracted to SWX
because of
a) defensive nature of business
b) healthy cash flow Low EV/EBITDA around 5.5
c) P/B <0.9
d) good and improving balance sheet (recently increased credit rating from BBB-
to BBB)
e) Dividend

I suspect earnings really could take off once the housing and growth in Las
Vegas improves. Right now they incur quite a bit of cost to connect houses that
are staying empty and hence not consume any gas. Once those subdivisions fill
with people, profits should improve, even right now they don't look too bad,
considering what I am paying for the shares.

BAC -
This stress testing get's more interesting than many believed. I guess we will
soon find out exactly how TARP3 looks like since BAC is already on TARP2 level.
I'd say lot's of conversion of preferred into common at 6.3$ (the price
Geithner fixed) and a new CEO should be part of the package too.

Looks like it's not as bad as the headlines first implied. BAC is now up on the
news. Among other things, the talking heads on TV are saying that this
"additional" cash can be covered by the ability to convert the gov't preferred
into common down the road - the actual conversion doesn't necessarily have to
happen.

This is not to say that I really understand the logic behind any of this. I'm
still trying to figure out how TCE is somehow a more reliable benchmark than
Tier 1.
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:5/6/2009 10:10:55 AM
From:Spekulatius
re BAC the huge negative is that if indeed the conversion (of government
preferred) were to happen is of course the dilution and the fact that now the
government becomes a huge stakeholder. Also, my understanding is that the
conversion price would be in the 6$ and change range, based on the BAC
shareprice before the Geithner announcement minus 10% discount.

Tier one ratio is based on risk weighted assets. The problem with that is that
as assets on the balance sheet get downgraded, the Tier 1 ratio goes down
rapidly, even when there are no defaults. Since the stress test is assuming
worsening economy which almost certainly will lead to downgrades of assets that
those banks hold, the Tier 1 ratio becomes an questionable grading system. TCE
ratio is not risk weighted so it's an extreme in the other direction. I'd think
that both TCE ratio and Tier 1 should give an assessment of the expected
performance in worsening environment.

Anializer, would there be a reason you prefer AYR over GLS mentioned here
earlier? I've not compared them in detail. Other than AYR being a much bigger

CT. Too tough to figure for me.

I see Sam Zell is/was a director. If he were to buy shares in open market, I
might go for some shares too.

At current price it's a perpetual option that the company survives. If it does,
then a multi-bagger is the reward, I'd guess. The probability of surviving
though, I've no clue.

Hi Spekulatius -

Followed you in on a starter position for Southwest Gas Corporation (Public,
NYSE:SWX). The company is a good addition to my other utility sector portfolio
holdings. SWX also has a preferred (SWXpB
http://www.quantumonline.com/search.cfm?tickersymbol=SWX-B&sopt=symbol rated BB
by S&P) which was a good buy last month but has rallied more than 15%. It still
yields over 8% but has limited up side compared to the common shares.

I also added a few more shares of Black Hills Corporation (Public, NYSE:BKH). I
now have equal weighting in SWX and BKH. These buys raise my sector (utility:
oil & NG, pipeline & distribution) portfolio holdings from 7.4% to 8.9%. My
average dividend yield (based on weighted holdings) for these positions is
around 6.5%. There are 11 positions in the basket. They are generally defensive
in nature but do have an inflation hedge component as some of the companies own
the resources in the ground.

equities. I am still at 25% cash & bonds.

My credit union lowered their savings rate again and is now down to 1.75%. My

yielding 4.4% down from 5.5% at the beginning of the year.
