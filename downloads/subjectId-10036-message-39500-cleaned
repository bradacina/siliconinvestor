Well, of all the big techs I planned to buy, I think I bought the worst two
performers this month, msft and intc, but at least I'm at a small profit. :)

I still am looking at these companies, especially CSCO. Just sold my E, FEZ,
and FXI for different reasons to hopefully roll into these big techs while they
still look to be at good valuations. I will probably buy a decent position in
CSCO tomorrow and hold the rest of my sells for cash until we correct a bit
from this run. I was at 0% cash basically, which is rarity for me.

Yes, what I should have made more clear was that I was mentioning cash (since

Cwillyg,

I am definitely interested.

I hold some MSFT. IMHO, it's cheap but not very cheap. It has good earnings/EV
yield, but its earnings growth has been anemic (10% 3-year annualized, 7%
10-year annualized - obviously a lot of large companies would kill for this
kind of growth, but it's not that big.) and with this growth continuing in the
future, investors won't get a good return. Hold/sell to me.

I hold some GEOI, but I don't like it a lot. A bit too gassy for me and for
some reason I don't have an eye on it. :) Hold for now.

I have GRVY position. Hold now that it's all in tax deferred account and PFIC
is not an issue anymore. I hope they come through with some positive news
though.

I gave up on ACTS and ATPG. CSCO is IMHO not cheap enough for me. Though techs
could climb to rich valuations again.

Glad you're interested. I'm always interested in reading yours. My comments:

MSFT - I bought this slightly lower than it is now. I like this and CSCO
because of their large cash balances, relatively low p/e's, and potential to
use that cash to foster growth in earnings. As a bonus, I think that as oil
gets tigher in the coming 5 years, both of these companies have products that
will help companies still do business with less need for business travel.

GEOI - I'm at a hold with this one also. If it moves another couple of points,
I will be reducing my position. Seems like a decent conservative oil play. Not
a lot to get excited about, but I'm hoping to profit.

GRVY - I still like this one as they still have a lot of cash, and the Yen has
really made a move which should help sales to the Japanese market. They
recently made an acquisition to get a couple more games, and I think RO2 is
still on-line for roll-out this year. I just think that they're at the point of
put up or shut up. Crossing my fingers, but I do think the cash gives us a
valuation base at some level.

ATPG - I used to have a 10% position in this, but I've traded some profits and
reduced my position (which overall is still a loss) due to uncertainty in
future gulf of mexico regulations. But, if regulation isn't so bad and they
keep ramping up production, better late than never, I have high hopes for ATPG.

Hi Madharry-

Re: Magnum Hunter Resources Corpora (AMEX: MHR)
GMX Resources Inc. (GMXR)

Added some more shares of Magnum Hunter Resources Corpora (AMEX: MHR) to my
current holdings. Yesterday I sold some covered calls and plan to do the same
for my GMX Resources Inc. (GMXR). My strategy is to buy shares of each on any
sustained sell off and then sell covered calls on at least one half of the
position 5-6 months out. I will stagger my Buys and covered call option Sells
for several months.

Hopefully, beginning February & May of next year, I should have steady option
income and/or have my original funds (w/ small capital gain) returned to me (ie
stock will be called away). This way I can generate some income every option
cycle and also have a possible source of funds for new buys.

The option premium is huge for both of these companies (37% for an 8 months
covered call ie. MHR May $5.00 calls). I plan to leave 1/2 of the shares
uncovered so on any significant run higher, I can book some capital gains too.

The big looser would be a significant loss in one or both of these names or
even a BK. The biggest risk is a secondary issue done to raise more capital.
This would result in share dilution and possibly a significant hit to the stock
price.

FWIW - Peeled off some shares of my ANGLO AM PLC ADR (Other OTC: AAUKY.PK)
(bought shares in 1/2009 for $10.50/share) to implement my O&G Buy/Write

cnbc fast money had a lot on this last night. i thought there new correspondent

from silicon valley on the board choice. lots of people were scratching their

3% of the business, no experience integrating new acquisitions, and was not a
success at his last ceo position. not sure that he works well with others
either. certainly did not motivate me to start a position in it. really makes
you wonder why they werent in position to promote an internal candidate
considering some of the folks running the bigger operations had been there for

The whole way corporate boards are selected leaves a lot to be desired. some
boards have as many as 18 people I have no idea why. I remember when I was much
younger, I met this older gentleman who had been on the board of a company that
got taken over, he complained that the acquiring company got them for a song. I
didnt say anything but I thought if you guys had done your job as board members
that would not have happened.

Hi rlee -

Sorry for the confusion. I sold the MHR May 2011 $5.00 call for $0.50. It is an
out of the money call. If you assume that the stock is called away at $5.00 on
the 3rd Friday in May 2011, the stock bought at $4.05 would generate a 36%
total return for 8 months (or 54% annualized ROI).

$0.95 capital gain from the stock ($5.00-$4.05 = $0.95)
$0.50 call premium

Total return is $1.45. Cost of investment is $4.05/share. Total return (8
months) 36% = $1.45/$4.05.
(Note: annualized Return=54%)

If the stock is lower than $5.00/share in May 2011, you keep the $0.50/share
call premium.. That equates to a 12% return for 8 months (or 19% return
annualized).

My strategy is to generate some income and looking at the best case (where the
stock price exceeds $5.00/share in May 2011), you <u>CAN</u> earn a total
return of 54% annualized. You also give up the upside which can be huge with
these low cost O&G companies.

That is why, I only sell covered calls on 1/2 of the shares I own. This
strategy is not for everyone but I prefer to book the call premium(s) on part
of my shares as these companies grow and build out their production wells. My
plan is to sell on run ups (like significant news announcements) and buy shares
on sell offs.

As the stock eventually increases in price and can show exceptional profit
potential, I may stop selling covered calls and just peel off shares to
generate the income I require.

Hi Madharry -

I have too much experience from the wrong side not to go in with a set plan for
peeling off profits. As you recall, I rode DRYs up from $9.00/share to
$130.00/share, only to peel off my seed money at $75.00/share and ride the rest
of the deal back underwater to $4.50/share.

I now set an exit plan for every investment I own and use a modified minimum
income return (yield) where I collect dividends, write covered calls, peel off
profitable shares or just exit the investment.

If in my view I feel that the investment is significantly under valued (and the
rest of the market just does not get it), I limit my total portfolio exposure
to 1% or less.

In my DRYs example, everything was on track. I only had 1% of the portfolio
invested in the company. It grew to over 12% of the portfolio value. I took my
1% off the table but should have been more diligent with the 11% I let ride.

I felt good booking my seed money but felt like a jerk letting those profits
disappear.

Money management is so key in any investment strategy. It seems like every 10
years I have an expensive learning event. My previous learning experience was
shorting a stock w/ no exit strategy. That cost me as much as a four year
college education.

Just be sure to take your seed money of the table first and then establish a
strategy to peel off shares that produces an overall rate of return that meets
your minimum acceptable (annual) amount. Then I guess you let the rest ride.

FWIW my biggest winners in the portfolio are natural resource and integrated
oil companies I have owned for years (over 20 years). DRYs never had assets in
the ground and was hugely leveraged w/ lots of debt. Now I know.

And you also wrote here, "I still dont understand why they let hurd go...

Here's why,

"HP's general counsel Michael Holston was more blunt, describing a "systematic
pattern" of submitting falsified financial reports to hide the relationship.
"The facts that drove the decision for the company had to with integrity, had
to do with credibility, had to do with honesty," he said. He added that the
inaccurate financial reports in question related only to Hurd's personal
expenses."
================================
Loathe that I am to continue my investment in ORCL with a person as Hurd almost
in charge -- because he's apparently so egocentrically stupid and insensitive,
and with so little integrity as to have underlings or himself prepare false
expense reports -- I will nevertheless stick with ORCL for a while. I assume
his claim to fame is cost-cutting -- that is, chopping people -- and that might
work for a while at ORCL. I'll wait a bit to see. Ultimately, I see going with

OT: Masters of the Universe should be held to different standards from the

Perhaps sleazy non-sexual affairs, providing subordinates with phony expense

else not a Master, this cannot apply. After all we don't want everyone in our

assuming if they get caught, at worst they'll only have to pay back the $
amount in question.

The USA doesn't have a king or queen or official royalty class. Instead, for
many people, it's celebrities who are our substitute royalty. We read about
them, follow them around, and are in awe of them when we're in their presence.
So these celebs too, in their way, are Masters of the Universe. And thus
perhaps they also should not be held accountable for their actions as might
plain folk. Lindsy Lohan, Paris Hilton -- celebs and wealth creators that they

Credit cards: China, Brazil challenge JP Morgan
October 4, 2010 9:42amby Stefan Wagstyl | Share
While emerging markets are well behind the developed world in overall economic
terms, the gap in specific fast-growth services and products is much smaller.

Take credit cards, for example. As the Financial Times reports, two Chinese and
three Brazilian banks are now among the world’s top 10 card issuers. The
western international banks that have traditionally dominated the market face a
direct challenge from rivals that, 10 years ago, were barely known outside
their own borders.

As Patrick Jenkins writes on ft.com:

China’s ICBC is the highest ranking of the five fast-growing banks, with 54m
cards in issue, and is catching up fast with the world number one, JPMorgan,
with 96m cards, according to data compiled by Lafferty, the research group. The
others are Brazil’s Ita&#250;-Unibanco, Bradesco and Banco do Brasil and also
China Merchants Bank.

Although western issuers continue to dominate the rankings when measured by the
amount of outstanding credit, the cards-in-issue league table provides a hint
of the banks that are set to dominate the market during the next decade.

North America still leads the world in terms of transaction volumes, with
nearly half the global total. But Asia is catching up with around a quarter. JP
Morgan had better watch out.

GTSI - assuming accusations are correct and stick, the company should
liquidate. You'd get something between 1.3x to 1.6x current price in case of
liquidation IF there are no lawsuits from the government/etc.

If accusations stick and they don't liquidate or if they gonna get sued, they
gonna bleed cash (and Eyaktek stake) like hell and you might not get any of
your money back.

Assuming accusations don't stick, GTSI might get the Eyaktek offer again which
would lead to 1.7x-2.0x gain.

IMHO, the risk is still too high, but I might be wrong.

I'd think Eyaktek would have some legal remedy that would let them extricate
themselves from GTSI given the Mentor relationship.

So maybe GTSI shareholders are left with:

+ GTSI's net assets without Eyaktek
+ some cash from Eyaktek buying back GTSI's 37% stake
- costs related to their legal mess
- any prospects going forward.

That doesn't sound too great.

Paul- I noticed you sold the bulk of your UTX shares in Oct 2009 right around
$64.00/share and bought TPZ. UTX up 9% vs TPZ up 28% (plus 3x the dividend w/
TPZ). Excellent trade!

UTX is a case of a pretty good diversified company but IMO still priced too
high. I will wait for a 8%-10% correction to $64.00/share.

Yeah i agree with Spek as always it seems and also from a pure numbers

I still think it is in middle ground and have a feeling especially after i have
been diving in to Salesforce for a potential short, that the likes of HPQ will
try to BUY it probably paying 30 times price to sales.

I start thinking about it more as i am reading through CRM filings and as i
have kept up and read most of the filings in HPQ the past year... new HPQ CEO =
software guy, 3% of HPQ sales is software = buy CRM for +$25 billion. Just

Hi Spekulatius -

 I am guessing that the overall index must go down at least 5%.

I am looking for the same thing especially w/ a short option expiration month
(10/15/2010). It looks like Mr. Market is going to fool us all and continue to
rally much higher.

Several of the stocks I am watching have broke above their 200 Day MA after
rallying from their August lows. We had the largest September rally (up 9%)
since 1939. The S$P 500 could easily rally another 6% just to get back to the
April 2010 post crash highs. Another 9% rally on the S&P would only get us back
to the pre market crash levels.

My account(s) are flush in cash waiting for this 5% correction. I may have to
continue to peel off more shares as we extend this rally another 6% higher.

The market must be pricing in the QE2 which is expected to take place in the
next 30 days.

Oil continues to rally which is puzzling to me. I wonder if the Gulf of Mexico
drilling moratorium is helping to push up the price.

Now is not the time to chase the market but to be patient and stick with only
making new purchases that provide a significant value opportunity.

Although I would not touch a lot of these stocks either, I believe that
Greenblatt's magic formula and Gerstein's adaptation is one of the closest to
my investing approach. At least when I look at screens run using them I see
over 50% stocks that are worth looking at compared to a lot of people and
screens where there's maybe 5-10% stocks that are worth looking at.

Of course, with this particular set of stocks, I have already looked at ~70% of

$400 and had gone up kudlow could not understand why anyone would want to
invest in gold. everytime its gone up pundits have poo pooed the rise and
called for corrections. as it move above $1200 people were calling for it to
correct to $1000 now people are waiting for it to correct back to $1150.
I dont know when its going to correct and if it does correct so be it. fact is
its been trending higher for about 4-5 years now. and if you think that stocks

VSEC - They were mentioned in the "upgraded" magic formulla article, so finally
I took some time to look at them. Nice ROE numbers. Very low net margins - I
guess they keep them that way so government wouldn't feel they are getting
gauged on the contracts (some contracts are cost+fee which naturally is low
margin). As is clear from 2010 the government contracts are not going straight
line up. Furthermore, there might be government cutbacks if budget deficit
reduction get serious traction (a big IF...).

So I guess the question to all VSEC holders is what is the edge for VSEC to get
future contracts and continue good growth + ROE? Is it that margins are so low
and nobody else bids? Is it management schmoozing/knowledge of bidders in
Pentagon? In other words, why the future is going to look like 2004-2008 and
not like something that happened to CRDN (and CRDN actually did have a
technology/material edge, where VSEC to my eye has none)?

Quote from 10K: "While our largest contract, the Rapid Response (“R2”) Program,
is scheduled to expire in January 2011, we expect to continue our work on
existing task orders under such contract through that time, however, specific
task orders under the R2 contract will expire intermittently prior to the
expiration date of the contract. We have submitted a bid for a follow-on to
this contract that is currently under evaluation by our U. S. Army customer.
However, we cannot determine revenue levels precisely even if we are awarded a
follow-on contract." Have they obtained a follow-up contract? If not, how much
this will affect them in 2011?

Thanks for the Gerstein post, Madharry.

I'd say my simplified method using roe and p/e is better than Greenblatt's and
also better than Gerstein's more complicated modified Greenblatt's too. I can't
prove it though.

Two things against what I'm doing are:
1) I don't have the brainpower or flexibility to rigorously experiment,test,
and backtest variables to adapt or adopt or enhance what I'm doing.
2) I don't have access to complex screening tools, so I can't and don't
incorporate them.

One thing against Gerstein is that he does have access to so many screening
tools that not only does he use them, he incorporates them into several models
and even tries to make a business out of screening (newsletters). It's hard to
see a consistency of approach. I also don't understand how his screening posts
jibe with his apparent interest in etf's. Seems to me with etf's there's a
general screen (e.g. small cap Asian stock etf), but a buyer can't screen for
individual stocks (have to rely on what the etf managers include or exclude).

And after all his work of developing this modified Greenblatt approach and
writing the article, what has he come up with for himself? Nada. He owns no
stock his model provided. Not surprising given he may have so many screening
models.

Anyway, for me, I still hold and like VSE (VSEC) mentioned. I often use a ten
year avg roe, not Gerstein's five, and not Greenblatt's one year history. Here
with VSEC you have a company with 16% average roe over the past ten years,
(>20% if using last five years), d/e =0, p/e of 7. The stock's a buy at current
price (imo). (Rising book value and p/e below its mean also help in the
decision.)
http://si.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&symbol=N ^VSEC

Also I'm holding AMSG. Risk and the bet for me as described by Gerstein: price
low enough that with this stock, "you just have to assume the reasonable
valuations give us the luxury of assuming things will work out, even if we
can’t presently say exactly how that will happen." I don't understand how this
one fits Greenblatt's model. The roe has hovered between 10-11%, the company's
d/e is over .5, and the p/e is about 10. These numbers by themselves don't look
so great, and the stock doesn't pop for me when I use my roe model. OTOH, the
current p/e is unusually low for AMSG, as is the price to book value. Given
this, the stock falls into my style box for a value buy. (Helps too that the
psr is relatively low also.)

regarding amsg the numbers looked to me too good to be true. they are reporting
great operating cash flow but yet their revenues and procedures at existing
centers appear to be down. they had to refinance their debt facilities at
higher rates, and they pay no dividends. Without spending a lot of time all
sorts of red flags are popping up for me on this domestic company. How
comfortable are you with the accounting here? Given the uncertainty of the
future health care costs and reimbursements one would think that a company with
cash flow earnings like this if it were really cash could be returning funds to
shareholders in some way or other. Has anyone looked in depth at this company?

VSEC is another company that seems to spend its cash flow on acquistions.
Sounds nice but i dont see much insider buying there either. I understand they
just bought some Hawaiian llc for an undisclosed price that someone reported as
being for $33 million. will have to look at this in more detail and may listen
to a conference call or two. This seems more interesting and perhaps less risky
to me although it look likes they compete with some much bigger companies in
the same space.

Also be nice to know more about the accouting for acquisitions. someone here
intimated that its pretty easy to goose the profits when making regular
acquisitions and some else speculated that HPQ was doing something similar with
its acquisitions. Be interested in comments from others on these two
interesting companies.

SENEa - it appears to me that SENEA is a commodity producer in the food
business. Even their own brands don't ring a bell with me and probably don't
command much of a premium relative to store brands.

I also notice a pretty capital and inventory intensive balance sheet. Their
last earnings/share were down more than 50% YoY and I am not sure that this is
an aberation rather than a trend.

I have some bad experience with DF (milk) which appears to suffer from similar
ailments than Senea (but has an even worse balance sheet). Amongst the stock I
watch is a n European peer that is also in the canned food sector - Bonduelle
(BON.PA) and has imo stronger brands - down 10% today at a 52 weeks low, based
on a really bad sounding outlook.

The food sector get's more and more bifurcated into have's (those with strong
brands) and have not's (those without strong brands) where the latter get
hammered by store brands.

SENEA. I'm one who is familiar with several of the brands. Possibly both
because I'm familiar with the geographic area in which Seneca operates
(processes) and because I am interested in grocery stores and grocery shopping.

We could argue whether its important Libby brand has national (USA) recognition
and what that recognition is. I say it's positive among shoppers for quality of
canned goods. It's really only important to me though that the product gets
shelf space. Farmers farm and harvest, and Seneca is right there to process and
ship. If nature provides favorably, the farmers have a good season and so
should Seneca. In other words, I expect good years and bad years for Seneca,
just as I would for farmers.

I expect SENEA to be profitable this year, and with a current and outlooked p/e
of 7, the stock's a buy for me. Food companies which trade at or under 10x are,
in my view, generally good buys at that level. SENEA no exception. Of course,
that's MY view and jmo.

I reduced my HOG position a bit, since I am not so sure if it can recover to
pre-2008 sales and earnings levels, which would be necessary for another leg
up.

I sold CBEH after going one more time over its Q2 results and not liking the
OCF. The stock is very cheap if the company continues to report good results.

Increased positions in GRVY and UFPT. No news, the valuations were cheap enough
to add.

I decided to reenter ARO as it dropped to the levels where I bought it before.
I decided that GS is cheap enough to get some shares now. Similarly, L is a
great long-term company trading cheaply that is worth holding from here for
expected good performance in the future. Finally, I started an exploratory
position in GXDX a much smaller cousin of DGX as it dropped to yearly lows.

Hi Madharry -

Your silver speculation s/b doing great.

As I understand it the Fed's proposed QE2 (quantitative easing) has the market
concerned about the value of the U.S. dollar, specifically a decline in the
dollar. This results in the debasing of the U.S. dollar over time making many
assets "peg" to the $ U.S. become more valuable.

Many metals (gold, silver, copper, platinum, even tin) have been rallying,
Other commodities such as Oil continue to rise too. Many of my natural resource
stocks are rallying to new 52wk highs.

A relative lower U.S. $ also impacts the exchange rates of foreign currencies.
I am looking at Canadian and Euro denominated equities (ie ADR's) as they seem
to be benefiting from this move to a lower dollar.

I am not too sure how it all unwinds in the long term when the quantitative
easing ends but I would not be surprised to see some extended global price &
asset inflation.

Since most of the "hard" assets are denominated in $U.S. dollars, they seem to
be rising in "value", especially Oil.

10 ETFs That Benefit From Potential "Quantitative Easing"
http://www.fool.com/investing/etf/2010/09/26/10-etfs-that-benefit-from-potentia

From the article"...when the Fed creates money out of thin air, more dollars in
existence dilutes the value of the currency. It may not matter whether
purchasing treasuries or risky mortgage-backed securities with the extra
dollars is successful at keeping rates low; a weaker currency can limit foreign
investment and/or create hyperinflation..."

If anybody has more information on how this policy affects the value of assets
(both foreign & domestic) then chime in.

I am looking at selling some of my U.S. $ denominated integrated oil(s) to buy
some Canadian and/or Euro and/or Australian denominated oils (TOT is one I am

part of the issues if one looked at fillings deep enough, although it wouldn't
have been easy and would have taken tons of time (at least 10 hours work my
guess).
- diversification pays off where the digging is not deep enough or doesn't

Hi Madharry -

Re: Noble Group Ltd. (NOBGF)

This analyst sees the company fully value based on the current market price.
Based on my past year's results, I will continue to hold but will not add to
the position at this time.

Singapore S$1.97/share is equivalent to U.S. $ 1.51/share.

Noble Group (Noble) reaffirmed its commitment to building the business over the
medium to long term. Its strategies of connecting low-cost producers to
high-growth markets, investing in stable revenue-generating assets and building
critical mass in selected commodities remain intact. In addition, the group
plans to leverage on its strong balance sheet to capture investment
opportunities that may arise. We view value accretive investments positively;
however, the group’s ongoing expansion may elevate its operating expenses, and
this could weigh on its near term earnings. Despite its 2Q10 earnings falling
short of expectations, Noble’s shares have appreciated by 20% since its result
release, outperforming the STI’s 6% gain. We are turning cautious on the stock
following its recent run-up. In our view, a strong set of 3Q10 earnings is
required to justify further share price outperformance. We are keeping our
S$1.97 fair value estimate intact.

http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/NOBGF/chart

http://www.ocbcresearch.com/Article.aspx?type=research&id=20100928083501_88961

Recent rally calls for caution. Despite the below expectation 2Q10 earnings,
Noble’s shares have appreciated by 20% since its results release on 12 Aug,
outperforming the STI’s 6% gain over the same period. We are turning cautious
on the stock at current levels. In our view, a strong set of 3Q10 earnings is
required to justify further share price outperformance. Meantime, we see
potential headwinds arising from moderating global economic growth as well as
uncertain soybean and iron ore markets. We are keeping our projections and
S$1.97 fair value estimate intact. In view of the limited upside potential, we
are trimming our rating to HOLD.

2010-09-20

NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Sempra Energy /quotes/comstock/13*!sre/quotes/nls/sre
(SRE 53.91, -0.18, -0.33%) and Royal Bank of Scotland
/quotes/comstock/13*!rbs/quotes/nls/rbs (RBS 15.17, -0.47, -3.03%) said Monday
they would sell the Sempra Energy Solutions unit of their RBS-Sempra
Commodities joint venture to Noble Group Ltd. in a deal valued at $582 million.
The purchase includes $317 million in cash plus the assumption of $265 million
in debt. Sempra Energy and RBS said they're in "advanced talks" to sell their
Connecticut-based North American wholesale power and natural gas business.
Noble Group Ltd. describes itself as a global supply chain manager of
agricultural, metals, minerals and ores and energy products, as well as
logistics services.

FWIW - My initial buy was 9/2009 with two other subsequent buys Dec/2009 &
Jan/2010. On 6/03/2010 there was a 2:1 stock split w/ an equivalent drop in
stock price. A 2% cash dividend was paid 7/2010.

My overall gain to date is sub par at 13.7%. 2% dividend and 10% capital gain.

I like their business(s), their foreign diversification and their global reach.
The analysts fair value estimate of S$1.97/share (U.S. $1.51/share) represents
a 10% increase from the average share price I paid in 2009.

I do not like the stock split/adjustments but I guess this is the way they
raise new capital (along w/ debt). When splits occur, the price seems to over
react to the downside.

you'd have to dig pretty darned deep.
I dug pretty deep on this one, and here were my thoughts:

> GTSI's relationship with Eyaktek seemed very strange. I was suprised that
GTSI was allowed to sell product through Eyaktek, and I was certain that GTSI
was using Eyaktak for their special minority treatment.

> The previous CEO seemed upbeat about GTSI's prospects, and had retired 4 or 5
times previously, so that did set off any alarms. The guy seemed like good ol'
boy who was a decent manager. I did wonder if he knew something that we didn't,
but I had no evidence of that.

I subscribe to Klarman's school on diversifictation. 2%, 5%, 10% if I am
overwhelmingly attracted to a company. I can't imagine why anyone would have
been overwhelmingly attracted to GTSI. I think the 10% ones come up only once
every 5 years or so. For me they were BRK-B and BH, and that's it.

the silver wheaton (SLW) story as presented by their ceo: highlights for me
are: 1/3 of all silver investing is now going into slw, each share represents 5
ounces of silver in the ground for which they would pay $4 per ounce going up
1% a year after 3 years.

So I guess you almost got to the issues, just were not sure if government would
(ever) act. Like we are not sure in the case of for-profit education companies
or the Medicare-bilking managed care facilities.

But I agree, sometimes you have to dig very deep and a lot of times this might
not yield much. That's the thing to balance - time vs. return-on-time.

I agree with your Klarman's approach to diversification. :) Nice way to put it.

Re: Silver Wheaton Corp Common Share(NYSE: SLW)

Are you peeling off any shares of SLW? Looks like an all time high.

I do not own SLW but my two gold stocks are trading at 52wk highs. I may sell
some GFI at $25.00 or higher and AU at $60.00 or higher. I hold these as an
inflation hedge and never bought back shares I sold when the previous highs
were reached.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SLW,GFI,AU&d=s

I do own a few gold coins (Maple leaf & Krugerrands) which were bought in the
$400.00 price range in the early 90's. I even have a few of the Nobel Platinum
coins. These have not done as well as the Kugerands but they are pretty coins.

The best way to invest in platinum is through AGPPY. I have owned this one
since the late 80's. It's a three bagger for me so far. The company has a lot
of "assets-in-the-ground" and they use the platinum in catalytic converters
too. It pays a good semi annual dividend (almost 10%) and provides a good
inflation hedge. I peeled off shares in the $160.00 range in early 2008 but
really hold it for the dividend. The stock is thinly traded but is easier to
buy & sell than the coins.

Platinum Nobles
<img src='http://bullion.nwtmint.com/images/platinum_noble_rev.jpg'</img>

http://bullion.nwtmint.com/platinum_nobles.php
The first platinum investment coin, the one-ounce Noble from the Isle of Man,
was introduced in November 1983. The Isle of Man is an ancient British
protectorate, and well known for producing a variety of high-quality coins with
innovative and unusual designs. From 1983 through 1989, The Pobjoy Mint of
England produced The Platinum Noble in sizes ranging from 10 ounces to 1/10
ounce, with the face value shown in "Nobles," a value equal the platinum
content in troy ounces. The reverse of all coins features an historic Viking
longship, “Thusly,” shown under full sail. The obverse features the young Queen
Elizabeth II with crown.

FSR. Thx for mentioning. It's on my watch list. I'll look closer now.

Lot of these insurers look cheap. On the surface anyway.

I'll take a few more shares of life reinsurer RGA now. It has more public
history than FSR.

Also have a fill today on niche insurer FMR. Seemingly almost typical with
these small cap insurers now: under stated book value, profitable currently.
Just a few shares for me.

I sold some slw at lower prices, and wrote some calls that were exercised but
nothing since is has gone over $15. I sold about 25% of the crk.to that I
bought in the last couple of weeks when the stock jumped after reporting good
drilling results. I also sold some axu at much lower levels around $3.50. I am
sitting with close to 200% profits in taxable accounts with both of those
silver names and probably wont make any decisions on taking profits until i
find out what the the tax situation will be in 2011. I continue to like silver

Got scared out of WRLD after reading this hatchet job:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/228963-world-acceptance-s-lending-business-coul
-implode-as-a-result-of-new-consumer-regulation?source=yahoo

WRLD business model has come under attack many times. Yet the company has
continued to prosper. I am wondering though if this time things may actually be
different under the Administration's Consumer Financial Protection Agency
rules/regs and Elizabeth Warren.

If the company is allowed to continue with its business practices, the stock at
current price is again or still, a buy, imo. Otoh, if the business model is
flawed because of new government (state and/or fed) rules, then the stock is a
sure short candidate at current price (imo).

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=wrld

I guess I just don't need the aggro or uncertainty I'm feeling now. I've added
and subtracted off my core position several times. At this point, I'll take the
double in my core position, and close out the position there and in my trading
shares.

SROE interesting (albeit speculative and high risk not really the poster child
for this thread)

I still see some surprising values avaialble. Why people are happy with 2% on
10 year bonds when there are stocks around with a PE of 6 surprises me. The 6
stocks I listed last month as low PE stocks up an average of more than 20% in
the last 30 days (unfortunately KLIC lowered estimates which wasn't so
unexpected and knocked a little off Friday)

A stock like MASC still looks rather cheap to me ($65 million market cap, $35
million cash, no long term debt so basically for 30 million you can buy a
company that could possibly pay for itself within 2 or 3 years (assuming of
course that you could buy all 13 million shres for $5).

Pretty nice (mostly) large cap portfolio. The amazing thing is that so many
large-cap very well known and high brand value companies are trading at pretty
cheap prices. Not "very cheap" prices, but somewhat cheap - worth considering -
prices. Which means that if economy does not tank again, the stock market, even
the large cap SP500 has a ways to run.
