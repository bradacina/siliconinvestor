I agree totally but I'm not sure if your message was meant as a response to
something I wrote or just a coincidence? I'm not selling anything right now and
am just trying to decide when and what to buy with remaining funds. Lots of

Hi Paul - I added again to my WON position at $7.98 and now have 66% of my core
position built. Another new low so I hope the bottom is reached soon (perhaps
by October). What is interesting is that a 15% institution holder just posted a
13G change in ownership filing on June 6, 2006.

Lord, Abbett & Co. LLC now shows that they now own 6.7% shares outstanding (
5,777,267) and are perhaps done with their selling.

Their previous 13G holding report was December 2005 (filed 2-14-06) which
showed a 14.61% ownership interest (12,824,272 shares). That's over 7 million
shares they sold Jan 1 2006-May 31, 2006.

http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/sec/filing.asp?Symbol=WON

Lazard Asset Management LLC also reduced their position in May 2006 to just
over 3.16% ( 2,985,260 shares owned) too.

So perhaps the big sellers are now done. It is also interesting to note that
Goldman Sachs was in there buying shares according to their 13G reports. Maybe
they are collecting these shares for a customer (CBS?).

I have been wrong many times and this may also be the case this time. I do like
it when I buy when everybody else is selling. It looks like Lord, Abbett & Co.
LLC has thrown in the towel.

Steven, this was just meant to be a general comment and not really related to
you post. So far, the sell offs were not that bad, just erased a few month of
gains, which is not a big deal. Only the wacky stuff (emerging markets,
overheated commodities) got killed, but even so folks in those stocks should
still be sitting on substantial gains.

I have recently repositioned my portfolio, sold CBS at pretty favorable prices
and VIA at unfavorable ones. Started a position in well known CHK and added
some to SNHY. I am also looking forward to deploy some more cash tomorrow.

Hi Spekulatius - Are you looking to get back into CBS at lower prices or do you
think it is over valued and not one for favorable long term returns?

What do you think of Intel at these levels. I have a starter position I
acquired a few months ago at $20 and was looking for another position in the
$15-$16 range. I guess I had a chance a few days ago but I think it may test
it's low around $15 given all their bad news recently.

I love when we get these extended sell offs as many of the good stocks get hit
as well as the over valued ones. You do take a short term hit in the portfolio
but if you have a good money management system and peel off a portion of your
gains when the market is near it's highs and redeploy them as the market
corrects, it provides you the chance to pick up some good cheap assets.

FWIW Doubled up on DRYs today as it nears another all time low. Will consider

Hi Paul - I was looking at my Comcast buys and noticed that I have purchases at
$27.80 on 10/05 and $33.35 on 3/05 and this was before their launch of their
VOIP service. Their last quarterly report shows significant gains in new
subscribers to their VOIP service and marginal revenue gains. They only offer
this service to few of their large markets and will roll out in their other
services area over the next 18 months. Here is Silicon Valley they just
announced this new service last month.

That said, their new VOIP service is adequate but far superior in price and
options offered to their land line competitors. It's their QOS (Quality Of
Service) that beats all the other VOIP service suppliers but they still do not
offer many other features that other smaller VOIP suppliers provide.

I like Comcast better now than over a year ago. The downside is they do not pay
a dividend so I have been thinking of writing covered calls on a portion of my
shares to generate income. I own other companies that share the same space
including AT&T and Bell South (now on track to merge with AT&T). Comcast also
has a subsidiary company that is a media content producer. Their free flow cash
flow is quite large but still Comcast can not be considered a value
proposition.

I guess I would try to own both companies because VZ does lead the wireless
sector, is moving into FITH (fibre-into-the-home) which will allow them to
distribute VOD (Video on Demand). The industry is huge, expanding and new
technologies are emerging. The other company you might want to add to your
sector pot is the new AT&T.

Hi Paul Senior -

I finally sold the last of my JPM today. I held it a few more months than you
but utilized a covered call approach to squeeze out a bit more from the stock.
I sold the June $40 call for $1.50 in February 2006. (Note: If you had perfect
timing you could have sold it for $3.10). I collected one extra dividend and
got the stock called away today at $40. My original purchase was in 3/23/05 for
$35.00. That works out to be 16% annualized return (including dividends).

I continue to hold Citicorp (C), Washington Mutual (WM) and NYB (New York
Commerce Bank). I believe these three banks should outperform once the Fed
finishes w/ their rate cuts.

Proceeds from this sale go into cash reserves which will be deployed on further
market corrections.

I like both C at prices below $45 (The December $45 Put looks interesting if
you sell it naked for $1.50 or more; you also collect the dividend in January
if the stock is Put to you @ $45.00) and NYB (Selling the July $17.50 Put naked
would allow you to collect the 8.5% dividend if the stock is Put to you).

I wouldn't go that far unless you just want to continue to pooh pooh the Bear.

Indeed, if Bernanke continues to raise Fed Funds beyond the next FOMC meeting
(June 28-29), he creates a situation where the US consumer can't afford to
borrow and US bankers will not dare to lend. On the other hand, if Bernanke
stops raising rates, he risks a further dive in the US Dollar. As an
old-fashioned Hegelian who respects the System (in a way), I'd say it's time to
"pause". However, should Bernanke panic and start easing, its lights out for
the USD and new all time highs for Gold.

In 2002, when the word "deflation" began appearing in the business news,

government owns the physical means of creating money, implying that the
government can always avoid deflation by simply issuing more money. (He
referred to a statement made by Milton Friedman about using a "helicopter drop"
of money into the economy to fight deflation.)

Bernanke's critics have since referred to him as "Helicopter Ben" or to his
"helicopter printing press". In a footnote to his speech, Bernanke noted that
"people know that inflation erodes the real value of the government's debt and,
therefore, that it is in the interest of the government to create some

Holding/buying/selling XOM: Perhaps it's about timeframes and goals or
standards. For me and my past twenty years' performance, looking back on the
history of XOM, XOM doesn't look bad at all:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=XOM&t=my

If I had I bought XOM and reinvested back the dividends, for me, that would've
been a very satisfying return compared to a large number of stocks I've owned
(and lost money on) in the past decades.

Looking forward, I'd guess XOM might do similar in future as past too. OTOH,
their ability to profit from investing in oil countries with new-found
confiscatory policies is not so reassuring.

On the one hand, XOM's relative safety (maybe) and increasing dividends are
positives for us old timers. OTOH, going forward another twenty years - who's
got time left to wait so long for a long term investment to pay off? Other
stocks with better dividends and good - quicker - potential and lower p/e's do
attract.

Maybe my standards are lower than others'. Imo, XOM's low p/e, cash hoard,
geographic diversity, broad swath in the oil/gas business are worth a bet. For
me, I missed it a couple days back, but I'm going to add more to XOM if it
drops again to $66+ level.

Hi Suma - XOM is one of my best long term holds. My $2,550.00 XOM investment in
12/31/76 is now worth just over $41,850.00. I also receive annual dividend
income from all of my split shares that totals $960.00 per year. That's 37%
(2006 dollars) dividend return based on my original XOM investment every year.
I figure that my annualized ROI is around 10% (over 30 years!) not including my
dividend income.

I try to maintain 20% of my portfolio in energy stocks which currently include
CVX, XOM, OXY, BP, MRO, EP (natural Gas), SRE, UGI. TRP and HAL. These
companies are all involved in the production or distribution of oil and natural
gas.

My largest integrated oil holding is CVX. It has been since the Texaco Chevron
merger. The benefit of holding long term and adding shares over time is that
you eventually build a very low cost basis on those original shares purchased
and they spin off quarterly dividend income streams now taxed at a maximum 15%
Federal rate. I can also manage my tax hit by peeling off some of the older
shares to off set any losses I might have in the current year.

I have recently sold some XOM and RD (Royal Dutch) so I could further diversify
into natural gas and pipe line distribution companies. Also, because of the big
price gains over the last 18 months, my portfolio had more than my 20% exposure
to these companies.

Finally, my Dad also taught me that these integrated oils were like an
inflation hedge as their assets were in the ground. As long as they were
replacing their reserves, they would always maintain their relative value.

EKS

FWIW my other largest sector holding are natural resource companies including
BHP (diversified minerals), AAUK, AU ( gold), AGPPY (platinum), LPX (lumber).
Each pay excellent dividends and their assets are either under the ground or

Thank you for sharing all that information on your portfolio stocks..

My brother who is very conservative has always maintained a steady portfolio
and all in dividend plays. He has VZ which is why I mentioned it to Paul... He
does not care what the market does as long as he gets his dividends which are
all good yields.. AND then he has the advantage of having the stock appreciate.

You mention 15% Federal Tax on dividends.. I didn't know this.

I have BAC which I am holding for the reasons you cited you hold your energy
stocks. However, I think you rationale better as the banks do fluctuate with
the interest rates and they are so uncertain right now. I think there will
always be energy depletions that will keep the prices high. I don't know about

DOW--- USA's largest chemical company.

I'm not looking so closely at the p/e. These chemical companies can sometimes
sell at low p/e's. S&P though says DOW is undervalued now compared to
competitors based on its (DOW's) low p/e. And the p/e currently is at the low
end of DOW's historic range --- a good sign. (Although the p/e was not
applicable in 2001-2002 when there were losses and not earnings).

I'm also a bit concerned about how dividends might hold up for these companies
if we go into a recession or have more large increases in feedstock prices.
However, I note that DOW's dividend has not been reduced in at least the past
ten years. I don't know what the payout ratio is: it was a very low 29% when
the dividend was $1.34/sh. last year. (Div. is now $1.50/sh).

The psr catches my interest. It hasn't been this low in over ten years.
(current number compared annual average number). I consider this a very good
reason to be interested in the stock now. (Jmo)

If the stock drops another point (to a new 12-mo. low), I'll add a few more
shares. I have a few shares in several other chemical companies, e.g. LYO, SHI,
but imo (fwiw, not much) DOW is the best bet now.

Anyone following the insurance and reinsurance companies. The sector has been

many of the companies are selling at or below book value and sport pe ratios
below 10 on forward earnings. Seems from this vantage point that a lot of the
potential risk is in the stocks all ready. I started a position in a couple

You seem to be under the common but completely bogus impression that a stock

specific to reinsurance, although I have looked at AXS twice recently, and it's
tempting, but not quite enough for me.

I have ALL on my watch list.

I like the auto insurers. As a Motley Fool article stated, auto insurance is a
required thing, and it doesn't seem to have surprises for the companies like
reinsurers see. Otoh, there is lots of competition (and state insurance
regulation). I'm currently looking at PGR. I've bought just a few shares again
of TCHC last week after being out of it for a year or so. I'm not convinced yet
that this company is not a scam - they keep reporting earnings though, and
given current p/e, I'm willing to risk a bet for just a few shares.

I think VZ is the best bet in the phone sector valuation wise. One thing to
consider with VZ is that they have underfunded pension and healthcare
liabilities, which do not appear on the balance sheet. Also in Europe it's
worthwhile to look at DT and FTE. i like about those companies that they do not
have any pension or health care liabilities that their US counterparts do.
Right now FTE looks particular attractive to me.

An article in the WS Journal about the state of the oil supply situation got me
thinking.
The article quoted the Arabians saying that "there is enough oil supply in the
market" and they were offering crude that "nobody wanted". This seemed odd to
me, since crude is still near an all time top. Thinking about this it dawns me
that this means the Saudi's are trying to control the crude supply - since they
apparently would have been able to seel all, the crude they wanted if they had
accepted a slightly lower price.
As an investor in oil stocks (albeit an small percentage of my portfolio only)
I do not find this particulary comforting, since it means that the obvious
shortage is induced by supply restraint, rather than capacity limitations.
At least that is my take. But will it always stay that way? The Saudi's could
decide in one of their crazy moments to turn on their spigots and drive oil to
40 or 30$ maybe. this would do incredible damage to high cost supplies like oil
sands (as banker would be very reluctant to borrow because of increased risk)
even if this were only temporary.

OK I am rambling here, as I am one of the few folks in SI here that believe
that energy prices may be heading down rather than up, but it's at least
something to consider.

Spekulatius,

I believe the issue here is light versus heavy crude, and associated refining
capacity. My impression is that heavy crude is currently oversupplied given
available refining capacity that can process heavy crude, and this heavy crude
is already significantly discounted.

It's probably why the Saudis can't find any takers for this crude.

The Saudis have been ramping up production and have the biggest capital
expansion in its history to assist with the supply. You will need to look
closer at the refiners and traders and asia for its ever increasing consumption
for the reason for the large increase lately.

The Saudis have consistently been a stabilizing force for oil supply and
pricing.

RELATIVE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RANKING

Yahoo's Relaive Corporate Governance Ranking Service. For example, if you had
seen the ranking of Finish Line Inc., you would probably had avoided the stock.

I'm going to add some HD to my position when the market opens today.

This corporate governance number is apparently not so easy to understand. I see
for Home Depot:

"CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Home Depot Inc.'s Corporate Governance Quotient (CGQ&#174;) as of 1-Jun-06 is
better than 99.6% of S&P 500 companies and 100% of Retailing companies."

There surely was a public relations disaster at the shareholders' meeting when
the Board failed to show, and Mr. Nardelli crudely brushed aside shareholders
who wanted to discuss his pay package. And while the corporate governance
report is dated 1-Jun-06, by June 23, the business media were announcing that
HD's options were being probed by the SEC.

Maybe HD does have great corporate governance. To me though, perception means
more than some sophisticated ranking system. And my perception of HD is that
the BOD have not been overseeing management properly, and the checks/balances
on Mr. Nardelli need to be improved.

Perhaps Mr. Nardelli's behavior is one reason people may have given up on HD
--- the stock is approaching a two-year low. Meanwhile though, the stores
exist, they grow in number, people buy stuff there, and the financial metrics
(p/e, dividend growth, roe)look good to me compared to the stock price you have
to pay to get that performance .

Of course, I recognize housing supply and housing sales are issues, and
although HD is trying to focus resources on commercial market (too), it's not
clear as to whether or how much HD will suffer from homeowners reducing their
spending at HD. Perhaps this is the chief culprit why HD stock is down.

an "allowance for doubtful accounts" offset. That percentage would be a

2. They used to provide information as to new investments made on a regular

There was a bullish article in today's Barron's about the DRAM market. The
implications of MSFT's Vista will have a profound effect. I happen to like
IMOS, a cheap testing and assembly company. But I am certain there are other
ways to play the rolling out of Vista. Below is an excerpt from the article.

But there's good reason to be optimistic about the DRAM market. Consider that
at a conference for Microsoft's partners in May, Will Poole, senior vice
president of the Microsoft Market Expansion Group, said: "You should assume
there's going to be on the order of 200 million upgradeable PCs when Windows
Vista ships. And there will be then about 500 million new PCs sold over the two
years following the Windows Vista shipment."

Before Vista, PCs had an average of 512 megabytes of memory. That's likely to
go up to one gigabyte or, more likely, two gigs. Walt Mossberg, the Wall Street
Journal's technology columnist, recently advised doubling the recommended
amounts, to one gig for Vista Basic and two gigs for Vista Premium. XP rations
memory, constantly flushing it out to make it available to launch applications.
Vista is greedier: One feature, called Superfetch, delivers anything you've
ever written.

Pricing Power: Even as capital spending growth falls, demand is strong, as
measured by bit growth, which reflects volume and memory capacity.
THAT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY for upgrades. Here's a back-of-the-envelope
assessment from Samsung's Trill.Consider that a gigabyte of memory might fetch
about $100 on the spot market. Trill figures 20% of the PCs that Microsoft
deems upgradeable are older than three years, and need about $100 of memory
each. Another 30% are about two years old and need about $75. Still another 50%
is just a year old and needs a $50 upgrade, for a graphics- card update or
another 512 megs of memory.

On an installed base of 200 million PCs, memory upgrades could total $17
billion. At least half of that, or $8.5 billion, will be DRAM, Trill figures --
an amount equal to about one-third of last year's industrywide sales.

That's why the stocks of some DRAM makers may be ready to jump. Germany's
Infineon grabbed the No. 2 spot in the global DRAM market with $1.16 billion of
sales in the year's first three months, up nearly 50% from the previous
quarter's level. Analysts figure that the company is worth at least 11.50 euros
a share, over 30% higher than the recent share price. Infineon plans to take
the Qimonda memory unit public by the end of 2006.

The Bottom Line
As pricing improves throughout the DRAM market, stocks of some manufacturers
could climb by 30% to 50%. Infineon and Inotera both look poised for big
gains.Last week, meanwhile, Morgan Stanley boosted its rating on Taiwanese DRAM
manufacturers to Attractive. Among the firm's picks: Inotera Memories (3474
TT), which it says is worth 43 new Taiwanese dollars, versus a recent NT$32.25.
Inotera, a joint venture between Infineon and Nanya Technology, raised NT$13.2
billion in May to help fund a new plant, just two months after its initial
public offering. Morgan Stanley also likes Nanya's shares (2408 TT), which it
values at NT$26, compared with a recent NT$20.40.

hitechstocks .... 4 messages below this one I referred to a stock, HANS, which
gained over 300% in 12 months. I've previously mentioned it on this Board some
time back, so it's not something I'm presenting "after the fact".

Had you invested in an Index related fund, or similar, you would have earned
only a fraction of that figure.
It's only logical common sense that a "multi-stock" portfolio, or the S&P 500,
will be the "average" of all the stocks it contains. Therefore the better
performing stocks will be diluted by the laggards.

What you need to do is to utilise specific, well-tried criteria and financial
ratio targets that any company must meet or exceed. The mere fact that a
company has managed to achieve all of that, already puts it way ahead of the
pack. In this way you will identify QUALITY companies, such as HANS, which will
give you superior returns.

All you need are 4 or 5 of such companies, because you won't have "laggards"
amongst them to dilute your capital gains.
And 10% a year, in my opinion, is really peanuts. If you cannot earn in excess
of 30% to 40% per annum using the above investment methodology, them maybe the
stock market is not the place for you.

And personally, I wouldn't spend too much time trying to identify any
particular sector. What you need to do is to rather concentrate on identifying
INDIVIDUAL QUALITY companies, using sensible and logical criteria. If any of
them happen to be in the Tech sector, then fine. But they could just as easily
be companies selling motor car parts or cosmetics !

If you'd like to discuss this further, you can contact me at

Hi Bruwin - How do you manage your specific stock risk w/ only 4 to 5 stocks in
your portfolio? Do you utilize automatic stop losses or hedge with options?

I have several portfolios that are managed for different purposes. My IRA has a
diversified group of stocks, mutual funds and bonds composing of 23 different
holdings. I try to have each position to be less than 10% of the total value of
the portfolio based on cost. The goal for this portfolio is to generate
dividend income, equity growth and minimize losses. Because it is in an IRA
account there are no tax issues until money is withdrawn which is another 10
years in my case.

I have a personal portfolio which is a taxable account. I have only stocks and
mutual funds that consist of 51 different holdings. My goal is to generate
income (mainly qualified dividends), long term capital gains and minimize
losses. I do manage my individual cost basis by annually selling losers and
buying them back in 31 days if I believe the longer term outlook remains
positive. I match all of my stock trades and manage the equity cost basis
accordingly. No one position consist of more than 10% of the value of the
portfolio and more frequently they average 2% based on cost. My goal is to buy
value and see my 2% positions grow to greater than 5%. Two out of Five starter
positions may be duds (go bankrupt or loose more than 50% of the original cost)
but the other Three positions will eventually grow to multi-baggers. I also
hold for the long term and peel off shares of the large gainers as I need
income. This way I can manage my annual tax bill w/ booked gains and booked
losses. The personal taxable portfolio has a separate bond and fixed income
component that is invested outside and separate from my equity holdings. Here I
manage my equity and bond/cash percentages and try to maintain a 75% equity and
25% bond component but this does vary (80:20 or 70:30) based on my overall view
of the markets and other investment opportunities that may arise (2nd deed of
Trusts, CD's, Treasury Direct TIPs etc.).

Finally I also manage a distribution Trust portfolio that is designed to
distribute the total portfolio assets over time to my siblings. Here I do have
only 5 equity and mutual fund positions that each make up 20% of the portfolio
value. The goal for this portfolio is to generate qualified dividend income and
equity growth. I make monthly cash gift distributions so the purpose is to buy
excellent stocks that generate qualified dividend income and sell inflated
shares to make up the difference. I utilize covered calls to minimize my stock
specific risk as well as help me schedule sales to meet the cash distribution
needs.

In all cases one must be aware of the stock specific risk in their portfolio
and have a hedge plan or some stop loss protection program in place. With
mutual funds (like index funds)or 20 or more individual equities, you can
pretty much diversify away any stock specific risk. Also, if you hold your
winners and limit the losses on your losers (by reducing your average cost
basis), your gains will more than offset your losses. You do however need to
eventually weed out those losses and move to better value propositions.

Finally, I have found that you need to always be adding many new starter
positions each year to replace your losers and help diversify your winning
positions so that your portfolio does not become too top heavy in any one
equity position.

Anyway, that's how I try to do it. Hope some of the ideas help.

Sounds like you have a well thought out strategy but I wonder how you monitor
51 stocks. I may have around that number now and some of the smaller ones I
find difficult to stay on top of.

Management at Boston College scary to take anything seriously that bc puts out
based on the way they treated the sec of state. the professors approach and
reasons for inviting her to speak at graduation says a lot about boston
college.
