Some people here might like FCFC. The company is in the distressed asset
business. It is basically a restructuring play.

The company recently sold their interest in their consumer auto finance
business. It was sold in Nov. for about $87 million so there is a large change
in their balance sheet. The proforma numbers are significantly different that
those on Yahoo and can be found here:

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/828678/000095012904009153/h19992exv99w1.
tm

Anyways, their book value has more than doubled and is around $8. It seems to
be a business that generates a decent ROE - I am guessing around 15% or more.
Assuming they can deploy the new capital quickly enough, I am guessing they
should earn about $1.20 minimum next year.

Stew

Currently looking into BSX as a value stock. Forward PE according to yahoo <16.
The company is just going through a major growth spurt with it's Taxus stents
but attention is now turning to new competition from Medtronic in 2006/2007. I
see that BSX has grown in spurts in the past and then lagged for long periods
lasting many years. BSX is investing lot's of money into emerging medical
startups to catch the next big thing. it's quite a risky stock because profits
are so dependent on just a few products. On the other hand most medical device
companies that I have been looking at (STJ, GDT) were pretty good buys
historically when PE's were in the low/mid teens. It looks to me that BSX could
be worth a small bet at current valuations. All comments welcome.

Spek, Your point well taken. TFS is facing a difficult situation, but that's
pretty much with any company trading 20-30% below net liquidation value with
little or no debt. If TFS manage to have smaller losses in the next two
quarters, and give investors the hint of survival, it should go to $3-4, around
book value.

I realize I have been screening out 20-40% below net liquidation stocks, and
ended up with many cash burning companies. I am balancing those with some less
undervalued and breakeven stocks such as OSTE, they mostly trade at book value.

What does the thread think about OSTE?

Thanks Paul, Dave, Eric and Spek for your thoughts on low Price/Book value
investing. I certainly don't take book at face value, drill into every item and
apply discounts accordingly. I also check cash burn rate and the trend of it,
hope to see management cutting cost and reducing cash burn.

The big question is when to get in? While it is still losing money but lose
less every quarter? or breakeven? My experience is once it breakeven, the price
is already doubled from the bottom, so I tend to start buying a little early.
For people like the latter, you may want to take a look at OSTE, stock
recovered from $3.5 to $5.5(about book value) while returning from loss to
breakeven. Please let me know your thoughts.

jeffrey bash: I agree with you that DCA is highly desirable in a tech
investment. Unfortunately, it's rare and when it occurs the price usually
reflects both the rarity and desirability of that quality. Nobody's going to
take EBAY apart, but it's always looked way overpriced to drug-free value
investors[other than Bill Miller]. Paying up for DCA requires foretelling how
long the D remains durable. Forecasting technology is not something I am good
at [or anyone else - See book, 'The Fortune Sellers']...and I'm under no
illusion that monitoring news flow [or message boards] is going to give me an
insiders insight. In fact the insiders often get it wrong.
OTOH, I can sometimes recognize when something like OVTI is overdone to the
downside, but once it recovers I'm out at the first whiff of bad news. These
are always smallish positions, because hitting an AUO from time to time is

Interesting piece:

12/6/2004
KC Star has interesting article on NFI's innovative approach to credit
management for troubled clients.

Alan Newman's Crosscurrents has decided to do a series of articles on the
shorting of Novastar and how it is likely to play out, including an article on
the greatest short squeeze of all time. For more information, you can email
info@cross-currents.net, but you must place NFI in the subject line. Caveat:
the articles will not be free. Below, from today's issue of Crosscurrents.

"Just a teaser on Novastar Financial (NFI-NYSE), which we covered in the last
issue with the shares at $43.83. Look at the price now. We are already
preparing another article on this developing short squeeze and may be persuaded
to run a third article, since this story is just so darn interesting. Our
November 15th piece brought an astounding response, well over 150 emails
requesting more information (we actually lost count and can't bother to go back
to our abacus, sorry) prompting considerations to make NFI somewhat of a
continuing story until the shorts surrender or prove correct and drive NFI to
zero. [Please note: your Editor owns a small position in NFI]

Another Herb Greenberg pan on CBS Marketwatch on November 11th asked whether
Novastar should have disclosed a lawsuit prior to its recent 1.5 million share
secondary offering. Mr. Greenberg posed that the "NovaStar Financial story now
officially goes from confusing to perplexing." The story can be seen at
http://tinyurl.com/3q2qd . Although the suit claims damages of more than $200
million, one-fifth of NFI's then valuation, the market always knows best. The
stock opened down 26 cents to $42.58 (a 0.6% loss) and then closed up three
cents on the day. If this development had ANY merit for the shorts, the market
should have reacted the way markets are supposed to. What is perplexing is why
Mr. Greenberg continues to cover the stock in such a negative light despite the
company's continued success. Stay tuned, our next installment should turn out
to be an even bigger eye opener than the first.

ironing all the bugs when what they have clearly works well. I am particularly

Suma, oil tanker stocks.

I hold: FRO SFL OMM TNP TOPT ATB

I'm adding to FRO, may also add again to SFL. As I learn more about ATB, I
might up my small exploratory position.

The tanker story of course is out, and the stocks have already made good gains.
Buying any of these stocks now may be no more than a gamble. OTOH, a case can
be made that tanker supply/demand might be favorable for the companies for a
while, and the dividends (div. yields) are attractive.

I'm not an expert in the sector, and I could easily be very wrong in any

I'll admit I absolutely am near addiction to watching hold 'em, but CRYP's
business does not have enough of a "nuts and bolts" component (for my taste) at
these prices.

I hate to admit it, but my taste is drifting to WWE at its relatively low price
and superb balance sheet.

Good luck with CRYP, I hope you continue to draw pocket aces, then slow play to
sucker your opponents in, then put the hammer down when you round out the

This is probably too boring for any board on SI, but it does address the value
component.

I recently purchased FRB at 18.50, over a 5% discount to NAV, yielding 5.6%.
The discount to NAV is the largest in its class (loan participation):
http://www.etfconnect.com/select/fundpages/multifund.asp

I like the fact that these types of funds should perform OK in a rising
interest rate environment.

FRB is a new issue closed end fund (at 20 this year). As so often happens in
fixed income new issues, the stock holds up for a while, then breaks syndicate
bid. It almost has to, as it immediately starts trading at a 5% or so discount
to NAV, what with the underwriters commissions, etc.

For the fixed income component, I think it's a pretty good place to be at this
time.

Relatively conservative, nothing too exciting here.

I had the same thoughts through me.

Many people are talking about "Durable Competitive Advantage" on this value
thread. Although I believe DCA is a very good thing, I think determining a
company's DCA is very hard, if not impossible. Especially in tech industry, new
inventions and things just come to replace existing business every couple
years. Predicting DCA is not too far from predicting future earnings, which is
far from Ben Graham's value investing style.

The Ben Graham "below net current asset value" strategy and ideas should
probably be the main focus of this thread.

In the 1973 edition of The Intelligent Investor, Benjamin Graham commented on
the technique:
”It always seemed, and still seems, ridiculously simple to say that if one can
acquire a diversified group of common stocks at a price less than the
applicable net current assets
alone -- after deducting all prior claims, and counting as zero the fixed and
other assets -- the results should be quite satisfactory.”
In an article in the November-December 1986 issue of Financial Analysts
Journal, "Ben Graham's Net
Current Asset Values: A Performance Update", Henry Oppenheimer, an Associate
Professor of Finance at
the State University of New York at Binghamton, examined the investment results
of stocks selling at or
below 66% of net current asset value during the 13-year period from December
31, 1970 through December 31, 1983.
The study assumed that all stocks meeting the investment criterion were
purchased on December 31 of
each year, held for one year, and replaced on December 31 of the subsequent
year by stocks meeting the
same criterion on that date. To create the annual net current asset portfolios,
Oppenheimer screened the
entire Standard & Poor's Security Owners Guide. The entire 13-year study sample
size was 645 net
current asset selections from the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock
Exchange and the overthe-
counter securities market. The minimum December 31 sample was 18 companies and
the maximum
December 31 sample was 89 companies.
The mean return from net current asset stocks for the 13-year period was 29.4%
per year versus 11.5%
per year for the NYSE-AMEX Index. One million dollars invested in the net
current asset portfolio on
December 31, 1970 would have increased to $25,497,300 by December 31, 1983. By
comparison,
$1,000,000 invested in the NYSE-AMEX Index would have increased to $3,729,600
on December 31,
1983. The net current asset portfolio's exceptional performance over the entire
13 years was not
consistent over smaller subsets of time within the 13-year period. For the
three-year period, December
31, 1970 through December 31, 1973, which represents 23% of the 13-year study
period, the mean annual
return from the net current asset portfolio was .6% per year as compared to
4.6% per year for the NYSEAMEX
Index.
The study also examined the investment results from the net current asset
companies which operated at a
loss (about one-third of the entire sample of firms) as compared to the
investment results of the net
current asset companies which operated profitably. The firms operating at a
loss had slightly higher
investment returns than the firms with positive earnings: 31.3% per year for
the unprofitable companies
versus 28.9% per year for the profitable companies.

re Russian equities: I don't have much interest in russian equities. The VIP
saga just confirms my view that Russia is re-nationalizing the country via
exorbitant taxes. According to hearsay from the TASS, Putin want's to increase
the taxes 9at least for resource related earnings) from 50% to 80%. If true,
this would reduce the after tax NPV of resources by my more than 60%. Put
apparently, Putin does not limit itself to resource related earnings only, as
the Vimpel example shows. So I'd say, subtract 60% from the peak MTMS
valuation, which is about 3600 points and then things start to get interesting.

It's frequently more difficult to get a good handle on the financials for
Canadian equities IMHO.

You are joking of course.. If you are serious, please note that once a canadian
company is cross listed (meaning they trade on Toronto as well as in US) on
Nasdaq or NY, they have to abide by the same disclosure and reporting rules as
any other companies.. Where the company has HO becomes immaterial IMHO.. In
that sense they are no different then a lot of small software companies where
business may be in North America and over seas..

As for CRYP, last I was in it was in mid 2001 and existed the position around
40 CAD (that is CRY.TO).. The reason I never went back was I remember some
attempts by US legislature to regulate morality so I was wearied.. More
importantly there were some issues re. Visa and other credit cards becoming
strict about allowing the use of the card for online gambling.. When they
listed on LSE and when the stock went back to single digit CAD, I thought of
looking into how CRY overcame that particular problem but never got around to
it.. :o(

monthly subscription cost is or isn't going to get to people after a while.
They will have to get more for their money than Howard Stern. And 1.7 Billion

Then again, i don't listen to the radio hardly at all, once in a while while

Now, an exciting idea for satellite radio will be to link up with a cell phone

Paul, good to know you are holding all the "below net liquidation value" stocks
we discussed here before.

The window is usually small to be able to buy tech stocks at those prices. It
happened in Oct2002-Feb2003, and we all know what happened after that. Our
discussions/ideas - ALVR, DUSA, PCYC all worked very well.

After more than a year, those stocks reappear again, INFO, TFS, OSTE just to
name a few. CIEN was not as cheap as others but it was 20-40% below book with
huge potential (fiber optics equipment, broadband specialist). I have a
concentrated portfolio of 10-15 those names, and hope they will work in a year.

Standard & Poor's Announces Semi-Annual Reconstitution of Standard &
Poor's/Barra Growth and Value Indices
Friday December 10, 7:12 pm ET

NEW YORK, Dec. 10 /PRNewswire/ -- Standard & Poor's will make its semi-annual
changes to the S&P 500/Barra Growth, S&P 500/Barra Value, S&P MidCap 400/Barra
Growth, S&P MidCap 400/Barra Value, S&P SmallCap 600/Barra Growth and S&P
SmallCap 600/Barra Value indices after the close of trading on Friday, December
17, 2004. On March 18, 2005, the S&P/Barra Growth and Value indices and their
S&P parent indices will transition in their entirety to a half-float market
capitalization-weighted structure...

A stock's categorization as either "growth" or "value" is determined by its
book-to-price ratio. Using this measure, each U.S. index is split into two
mutually exclusive sets, each of which comprises roughly half of the index's
total market capitalization. Each S&P/Barra Value Index contains stocks with
higher book-to-price ratios, whereas each S&P/Barra Growth Index includes
stocks whose book-to-price ratios are lower. Like the parent indices from which
they are derived, the growth and value indices are market
capitalization-weighted.

Paul, I could not disagree more that "AT LEAST 100 different positions" is
sound strategy UNLESS you are talking about well-known large cap companies
where there is limited monitoring required. But then the question I would have
is whether you materially beat index funds, or a large cap value oriented fund
like DODGX.

I invest in the (volatile) microcap area and my goal is to know my major
position companies better than anyone else outside of the company. For my two
largest holdings, I have probably had 50 phone calls or emails with the CEO of
one and 20 with the other over the last year, and participate on all earnings
conference calls. This takes a lot of work/time, and 10 companies in total is
almost too many.

company is as leveraged as this it has term conditions limiting debt as part of
their borrowing agreement. where does the company get financing? has this been
lined up yet? If this plant that they are buying is in receivership they will
have to get the approval of the bankruptcy court, wont they ? I dont know how

Jeffrey Bash. We just won't ever resolve the concentration vs. diversity
argument. Even as I defer to your successful performance record, as I surmise
it to be over the past years. Beats my performance. (Although it seems to me I
ought to have beaten DODGX with its annualized 12.5% over five years.)

As I often say, I am looking for a normative way to invest. That is, what is
the best way one ought to plunk down money to be a successful investor? To me,
having 10 microcap picks and being so attuned that one makes several phone
calls to the CEO - that is just too specialized and impractical for the average
investor (me). Sufficiently effective for you and others perhaps, but also a
heavy bet on only one sector of the market (microcaps), and apparently on
reports by management. To me, that's risky too, because I do not trust CEOs -
too many are ego-bound, biased salesmen.

My idea of diversity also has its problems for the average Joe. It requires
more money (than if one were accumulating shares in only a few companies), and,
since positions are acquired over time, takes much longer to implement.

That said, anyone who follows my posts and suggestions and yours, would likely
be better served if they gave much more credence to the few recommendations you
mention here. Readers can at least be assured, I believe, that you have indeed
THOROUGHLY considered all aspects of your pick. To compare with me, my DD is
superficial at best.

(OTOH, imo, superior DD is not the necessary and sufficient condition leading
to superior performance. But it helps -g-)

I particularly like your comment on DD. It's kind of like applying any of the
various valuation methods (discounted $-flow, P/B, <$, etc.) when you do your
DD, no one model or combination of models will guarantee performance but they
all help put you on the fish.

As for diversification, I think the best line was from one of the more recent
linked articles. I can't remember the old sage that said it but his base
premise was that you can never know what's going to happen in the future. Given
that premise, his line was that "If you like everything you own, you're not

RIMM Short: Initiated a Ready Fire Aim short 0f RIMM @87.96 based on what looks
like a big up bounce in litigation risk for a stock whose price reflects a
whole lotta love. Morningstar, which uses a Buffettesque approach shows a fair
value $45 per share despite acknowledging substantial competitive advantages
and growth potential. If it weren't for the patent/litigation risk, I wouldn't
dare short this. But if concerns like those expressed in these WSJ excerpts:
"An appeals court dealt a heavy blow to BlackBerry maker Research In Motion
Ltd., as the court substantially upheld a previous patent-infringement ruling
that could block BlackBerry sales in the U.S. or force the company into a
costly settlement." and...
"The appeals-court ruling is "an enormous victory for NTP," and now there is "a
gun hanging over RIM's head," said James Hurst, a patent lawyer and partner
with Winston & Strawn in Chicago."
come to be discounted, they could drive the price below the uptrend line that's
held for the last 2 years confirming todays high volume key reversal..this
could send the technical momo's scurrying and produce quite a drop [Please
forgive the technobabble, but with momentum stocks, it's a factor].
One justification for value investing is it gives you an idea pretty quickly
just how far away the safety net is...With RIMM, despite a great business it

It looks like Cemex is expanding it's empire -

Cemex buying U.K.'s RMC Group
Big News Network
Monday 27th September, 2004

Mexico's Cemex, one of the world's largest makers of concrete will pay $4.1
billion for British rival RMC Group, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday.

In addition Cemex, of Monterey will assume $1.7 billion in debt of Britian's
RMC Group. The deal will create a construction-materials company with $15
billion in annual revenues.

Layoffs may follow soon: the two companies have reportedly targeted about $200
million in cost savings.

Cemex's move accelerates an ongoing consolidation of the global cement
industry, especially outside the United States.

RMC is a leading international producer and supplier of materials, products and
services used primarily in the construction industry. It makes 12 million tons
of cement yearly, employs more than 29,000 people and operates in 22 countries,
including nations in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, South America and the
United States.

Cemex is a leading global producer and marketer of cement and ready-mix
products, with operations primarily concentrated in the world's most dynamic
cement markets across four continents.

==============================================================

Maybe it's worth keeping an eye on any of the smaller operations for possible
further consolidation into Cemex's empire.

FWIW I picked up a few more shares of TRP (TransCanada Corp) dividend was over
4% which goes x Dec 29. They recently acquired some Hydro Electric assets from
bankrupt USGen New England and got a good price too.

acquisition of British Travel site Gullivers at multiples below the growth
rate. They also payed below growth multiple for Orbitz. In both cases you have
market leading properties and a control premium was involved. What appears to
be driving TZOO, and accounting for the tough borrow, is the tiny float. This
makes shorting TZOO very risky since hedgies will often target such situations
for squeezes...especially at the end of the year when running up the price can
run up the score for bonus purposes. At some point the insiders will start
dumping the 87% they own...this will be the time to short, IMO.

PFE - OUCH I'm holding. Unless Celebrex is pulled, lawsuits will not be a big
deal...nothing like Vioxx, IMO. Less than 1% of patients are on a dosage as
high as the 400mg...at the bottom end of the range where problems were seen.
There have been many other studies that did not show any CV risk for Celebrex;
some even showed protective properties. Merrill estimated a worst case EPS hit
of .12 [05 from 2.26 to 2.14] based on a revenue drop from 3.9B to 2.5B
[-36%]...that implies a PE of 12 at 25.85. Just about any drug you pick up has
numerous warnings and risks. Alternative non-specific NSAID's for Arthritis
pain relief are considered to have greater risk of ulcers. For Dr's and
patients it's a matter of weighing risks since there's no risk-free options.
Frankly, I'd add if I didn't already have what I consider a full position[too
full it turns out]. But then my judgement when it comes to drug stocks has been

re PFE - well so far adding to PFE has been the right decision. I typically
sell my position in a stock when an unexpected and non-quantifyable risk
occurs, as i often found that stocks tend to slide more after the initial
haircut. With respect to PFE i did not expect problems with Celebrex, as this
COX-2 inhibitor is the most studied and had the strongest cardiac safety
profile of all drugs in it's class on the market. As such, i did not expect
what was announced in the recent clinical studies. I conclude that the
increased cardiac risk is most likely a class effect, hence all Cox-2
(including PFE Bextra) will show problem. An investment in PFE needs to take
into account that Bextra and Celebrex sales may wither away. My fears are
somewhat alleviated that the increased risk may solely occur in conjunction
with the unusual high 800mg dose in these studies. Still i believe that an
investment in PFE needs to take into account that Bextra and Celebrex revenues
will severely suffer, and lawsuits will result. A lot of risk, even for a large
drug company like PFE and certainly worth a 10% haircut for the stock, IMO.

Speculatius, agree. Only have a few shares. Also processor/distributor RS.

Took on an exploratory few shares of Korean steel producer PKX today. Looks
like there's a 5% div. yield. Maybe that will limit stock's correction, should
it occur.

If steel boom continues, I figure that will be good also for alternate metal
aluminum. Adding to my small AA position on dips.

Also fwiw, I'm still positive (and wrong) on graphite producer GTI. (supplier
of graphite rods to steel minimills).

Paul and All, what do you think about IBPI?

It closed at $3.98 today with $5.7 cash (data from Yahoo finance, and may be a
little less due to cash burn), zero debt. A small biotech stopped a trial of
its main drug. It retained Lazard to evaluate options to max shareholder value,
including merger or liquidation.

The catches are several class action lawsuits. How likely are those lawsuits
prevent a buyout offer or liquidation? like to hear other's opinion before I
buy more.

Merry Christmas!
