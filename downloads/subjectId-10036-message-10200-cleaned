Hello fellow value investors! The times they are a changin'!
This is the first time I will have posted in this manner on this thread, as I'm
not posting about a value stock. It's one I've held for three years now, and
it's been a wild ride, almost thought the company was going to cease to exist
year end '99. Thus, I will give the disclosure that I am long the stock. I am
posting because I feel that the stock will work higher, but also for some
perspective, because I feel this is the best thread on SI to achieve that.
Anyway, the ticker is ICOM:
I feel they have cleaned up the balance sheet while adding working capital
(granted, at the cost of some dilution), they have put on two major new hires
(one in marketing, the other in engineering, the latter being today's
announcement), as well as looking for a lot of other employees, if one believes
the company website. I hope this is a precursor to some contracts, and I also
hope the contracts are significant.
Anyway, the company is slightly beyond development stage (i.e. speculative),
but it is in the right place at the right time, being a cutting edge
telecommunications provider. I hope you will pardon this intrusion, and tell me
what you feel, helping me with my DD which spans 3 years plus now!
Now back to more mundane stuff, like S ALL FLO DVD...

Wallace, re: ICOM. Congrats on another excellent pick and having the
patience/guts to stick with it. I'll just jump right in and say it should be a
very easy decision for anybody here (other than you) to make a buy or pass
decision on this stock. Which, of course, is pass. (Even if I am wrong many,
many times -g-)

But one issue is when or if you should sell. That's not so easy. There was a
ton of insider selling (under $2) in 1998 and until Oct. '99 when it suddenly
dried up. And just when ICOM began its climb to 10+. Now these insider types
never run out of stock (imo), so they must know something, and they are not
selling (yet). Getting some awareness from the financials looks hopeless for
me. Your 3 years of DD might tell you something. Might not. Tough predicament
to be in - and having the stock drop (10+ to 7 1/2) makes it even tougher.

Which brings up another issue. Should one be diversifying one's investment
styles? If so, then maybe we all should at least consider having a ICOM type
stock in our portfolios. One value fund manager who says stick just with value
is Robert Sanborn late of the Oakmark fund. He believes that if you're a
long-term investor, you can have all your assets in value stocks. They replaced
him this week - said they would keep the same value principles though - so
maybe they just didn't like the underperformance of his value choices.

I'm one for diversifying styles. But ICOM is way outside anything in my
universe -g-.

Thanks for tolerating my indulgence, Paul and everyone. I do feel that one

Looking seriously at ALL, I have been trading S pretty successfully for a

Thanks, Jeffrey, for your work on COO.

I've closed my position today.

This is what could be expected from me, given that I don't often try the
in-depth research that you are skillful at. As a consequence, I don't have a
sense of the underlying max. value of stocks like COO when they respond (imo)
to external events (B&L's buyout announcement). I have to guess that I ought to
be taking profits on the correlated COO runnup.

Also fwiw, I'm starting to sell some Lehman, selling more Mass. auto insurer

I couldn't personally give you any useful advice on Tejon Ranch, but I do know
that it's a big holding (about 5%) of the Third Avenue Value Fund, managed by
Martin Whitman. I remember reading his reasons for owning it either in his past
shareholder letters (available on his web site) or in the Q&A on his website.
If you poke around at www.thirdavenuefunds.com, you should be able to find
these. Also, if you don't know much about Whitman's style, you can get some
understanding of that there too, so you can consider the source.

My take on Whitman is that while he says he buys stocks that are "safe and
cheap", his emphasis on safe is sometimes not enough for me. I recall that he
was asked in his Q&A once about a specific stock he had bought and whether he
really thought it met his stated criteria for Safe. His response was something
like, You're right, that one's cheap, but I wouldn't really call it safe.

Hope this helps,

Brendan

Marty's take on value investing is a bit different than most. He clearly
differentiates the passive investors from control investors, and makes little
apologies for his advantages as a control investor when he can wield them.
Interesting guy, but that cheap, not safe comment sounds right up his alley.

FWIW, Tejon is an old straw on this thread. Jim Clarke mentioned and several of
us bought in around 17-21 just before its 1997 Barron's induced spike to the
forties. The Motley Fool published a number that said it was worth
$1000/share.I bailed in the mid-thirties and have watched it and FLA ever
since. FLA really has turned out to be the one to be in.

You are welcome on COO, Paul. I think your action is sound. I like the company
and it is a long term core holding for me, as long as my contacts with mgmt
make me feel comfortable. However, it is probably one of those situations where
in the absence of anything unusual it will have a 10 point yearly trading
range, rising 5 points per year. You likely sold at the top of this year's
range.

By the way, I hope you are not nervous about SEMI's gyrations. I am still VERY
bullish on it. They may book as much as $50M in March. I think you can figure
out what that would mean if continued for any length of time. (A close friend

MOVIE Gallery (MOVI)

MOVI is a video rental store for rural and small-town markets. With the
emergence of the internet and pay-per-view, it appears that the market believes
that video stores are going to go the way of the horse and buggy.

I believe the market is over-reacting. Assuming the video stores last more than
a few years, MOVI looks quite attractive to me right now for several reasons.

1. Sells at PE of only 6.6, with a Price-to-Cash earnings (Earnings before
amortization of intangibles) of less than 4.

2. Appears to be taking all the appropriate measures --- buying back stock,
establishing an internet web site, and renting DVD's in selected markets.

3. In the latest conference call (available on vcall), I heard the company
state something to the effect that if this upcoming quarter isn't there best
quarter that they would be very disappointed.

What do you think?

Jeffrey: re SEMI and (semi-rant) my difficulties with this thread's (and my
own) biases.

Jeff, I'm still holding SEMI at this point based on your analyses, and I expect
to monitor the Yahoo thread for your notes as to where fair value might be. I'm
hoping it's around mid-twenties for 2000-2001 and that that level might
actually be achieved. And that I could hold on for that gain.
======
I'm upset about the discussion here (this thread)on SEMI. It's been just you
and me and maybe one other, and so I assume we were the only buyers of the
stock among thread readers. That says a whole lot about how people pick stocks
or the listening habits of the thread. And also about my own communicating
style. I do not want to post my investment record or repeat mention stocks
unless I am buying or responding to specific discussion points. So I understand
that it's easy for others to overlook SEMI if I mention it as a category pick.
(A 10-minute analysis - tops - suggested (to me, anyway) that it was a good bet
to buy.)

But I have also mentioned here a couple of times your totally opposite value
approach which is to try to know everything possible about a particular company
- its management, its ownership, its business past and prospects, its
competitors, etc. Two people coming from two different approaches yet reaching
the same conclusions on SEMI. You'd have to believe that such a range would've
encompassed the search and analyze modalities of a large number of value
investors. Some of whom would've also bought. Especially as we've mentioned
this stock here several times. But no. It's just you and I.

Ah well, thanks for first posting SEMI here. And congratulations on its being a
5-bagger (so far). I'm happy I bought a ticket and have come along for the
ride.

I doubt most people on this thread own that many. Jeff knew this company much
much better than I could understand and when he first mentioned it it was hard
to see that it would turn out to be such a great investment. Now that the
company has reported excellent results we know how right Jeff was. I sold the

I am interested in at the right price

It does not mean they are "bad" investments. I just
don't expect to agree with others on all of my
decisions.

BTW, instead of spending time on this looong list
of stocks (which is fun), I should be spending time
on a much shorter list of my 401(k) options. That
part of my portfolio may be more significant than
my stock picks. And you would not want to know

Book: Relative Dividend Yield
Author: Anthony E. Spare

I purchased and read the above in 94 and thought it should have came with a
disclaimer such as "This great system is only available if you can get the data

I put it away and continued to purchase trusts of the Dow 5 for the dividend
portion of my portfolio.

About R.D.Y. Yes, I'm a follower. I sometimes calculate my own data. Although I
do agree, it's not so easy getting the trend data for a number of interesting
opportunities. I missed appliance makers Whirlpool and Maytag which may have
been good candidates.

I find I can still use some of the stocks in his book and their charts as
guides. Barron's supplies current S&P Yields.
When Tony Spare is an occasional guest on TV shows he does mention some stocks
he is buying/holding. Generally, imo, the choices are not surprising. (Which
consistency you might expect as he has a multi-year holding period expectation
as he waits for the companies' relative yield to diminish (stock prices to
increase). Forces which tend to keep those relative dividends high (long
timeframe buying opportunity) are the diminishing S&P yield and the increasing
dividends (yields) of many of his companies. Also, Nancy Tengler (as you
probably already know)is an ex. disciple of the method. She's a frequent TV,
media guest, and her picks sometimes offer a starting point for future
investments.

You might also check out the SI dividend thread. I've posted many of my
relative dividend plays on this value thread for a number of years. Never seems
to be much thread interest though. Too bad as it's a method that works for
patient, value investors imo. (I've had one glaring error - JCP - but numerous
successes.)

Hello Paul,

Thanks much for responding.

What I would like to do is construct the actual charts in Excel. If one had the
data it would be a snap. That means that on a weekly (or monthly/quarterly)
basis one would need the stock dividend and S&P dividend yield for
approximately a 30 year period.

When I looked into this subject in 94 the S&P Compustat was the only place this
info was available and the lone person is just not going to get their hands on
it.

I called the firm and got to know one of Spare's employee's on a first name
basis. He was studying for his CFA and was bored stiff with this method. Too
slow and boring for him<g>. I'm sure he's off chasing internet stocks today.

I believe I can improve on Spare's timing system. With just the charts from his
book, and using other tools I have become proficient in, my mousetrap is
better.

Regarding Tengler, I see that she's listed at the bottom of the book. I guess I
didn't pay much attention to her the first time around. Is she with a firm --
or does she have her own now?

I'll check out the mentioned thread. But really, without the actual historical
data, it's not the real deal. Spare is describing a system that, some what like
Birinyi's cash flow analysis, isn't available to the average investor.

Take care,

Yes, that does explain some of it all right.

Jurgis, thank you for your picks and posts. I appreciate the information and
insight you provide.

Sometimes, in some areas, there are just things that are unreachable or
unteachable or unknowable, I guess. Which sometimes throws me off balance when
I come across them. Like a value investor who wouldn't buy a stock at any price
because it's not interesting -g-. Maybe I need to go back to my books. I don't
recall "interesting" being a a value investor's stock selection criterion. Or
"interesting business" being a prerequisite for a successful investment
operation.

I'm seeking an investing method that I might be comfortable with that has some
empirical evidence behind it.
SEMI - it was NOT just a low priced stock. It was a PARTICULAR stock whose
value - price below fair value - could easily be evaluated. In the same
CATEGORY as were others. But if the thread passed by on posts about RELL or
posts on JACO or posts referring to Buffett (or his rep.) purchasing the #2 in
this category - doubles and triples being missed all over the place - then I
shouldn't be surprised that so few 'got' SEMI. Even after after it was almost
blessed by Jeff. Bash- somebody who likes to know everything possible about his
investments. Frustrating for me to see these opportunities just go by the
thread while other stocks get discussed continually because they are in
concentrated portfolios of a few posters.

But as you effectively say... so what? We all have our own method of investing
and that's just how it is.

I would not qualify myself as a value investor. I.e.
I don't buy commodity businesses, not counting REITs.
I just don't like commodities. ;-) (REITs are
different - 12-20% yield in IRA is not bad). I don't do
solid numerical DD to be convinced that a commodity
business is a buy and a hold through fluctuations.
I don't have a problem holding companies like
MAT, even though Mike Burry ran away from it, and
it *did* deteriorate a bit after my purchase, but
I would be running out of EBSC by now.
That's my character.

So what do I buy? My 401(k) is in insane growth
(IGRYX and company stock). My stock portfolio is
Buffett'y (BRK, ECIL, FDC, LHO, MAT, SGP, TSG).
My gambling is satisfied with one-two options positions.
For the "value" part of my portfolio I hold TAVFX.
Marty is good at buying cigar butts and even
persuading managements to get them sold in used
cigar stores. ;-) If I went with total "value"
approach, I would buy TAVFX and Tweedy Browne, and
forget about doing it myself. But I have fun
investing - and *not* superior return. ;-) :-(((

So probably I should post only in Buffetology thread
which is closer to my liking. However, some of my

I post here too.

Health), UNMG (Unimark Gp). And of course, there would be those yet-to-be-
determined losers that are going down and down (into bankruptcy) where their
situation just isn't apparent yet to investors. I'm likely into at least a
couple of those situations too.

As I am telling myself I play a statistical game, my expectation (er, hope) is
that the gains from the winners outweigh the losses from the losers. Sometimes
that happens. Although in getting there the psychological pain from the losers
is far greater than the pleasure from any winners.

Actually, your portfolios/portfolio strategies look pretty reasonable to me,
Jurgis. Not that I know what's what, but still, imo, a nice diversity among
growth/speculation (401k), value (fund), reasonable ('buffetty'/GARP)
individual selection, and cocktail party conversation(speculative/gambling).

Imo, portfolio structures like yours, when given enough time (which you may
have) have worked out well for people of "my generation" and imo are a good bet
to work well in the future as well. (Assuming the stock market remains a decent

REITs - I'd just buy a diversified mutual fund. If you want to pick names for a
potential quickie "momo play" go with the ones institutions will buy first -
EOP, EQR, HMT, PSA, SGP. (i.e. nothing under $2 billion of market cap).

If you want to know what I own myself, I own shares in Fidelity's real estate
fund (no endorsement, its in a retirement account with Fidelity and my options
are limited) and SNH, a small cap REIT which is more of a 12 month workout than
a play on the REIT sector - if there were a REIT rally it may participate or it
may not - I don't consider that a reason to buy SNH, but it is the reason I
bought the Fidelity fund in October. Three other smaller cap names I have
always liked are CLP, CCG and EGP because they are extremely well managed
companies. EGP looks relatively expensive now compared to the other two,
especially CCG which looks like an absolute steal to me below 30.

By the action in these stocks today it appears the type of investor who buys
REITs long ago stopped listening to Abbey Joseph Cohen. She may be coming to
understand that if she just says buy, buy, buy she is going to look like a
genius until it ends, then she will wind up completely discredited and all
anybody will remember will be her last buy call 10% into a 40-70% market
decline (the one out of 20 that was wrong). On the other hand, if she backs off
now just a little bit, it seems she has very little to lose if she's wrong but
if she's right she'll be a legend - very few strategists are able to call both
the bottom and the top. And by just making just a teensy weensy bear call, she
preserves her options for the future. But when you see an analyst say BUY! BUY!
BUY! BUY!, then BUY, BUT SELL A LITTLE BIT that might as well be a short the
market call. Just my read - I am no big fan of AJC, but I've got to admit she's
been very right.

re: SEG. I posted here 3/11 I was buying. I made 10 small buys commencing 3/1.
My first purchase @ 50 5/8. My last two 3/27 @72 1/2 and 3/29 (before the
announcement) @64 1/4. I valued SEG (now @66 1/2) including its holdings, about
$100. Buyout offer is $73. (based on VRTS stock at today's close of $145)

Possibly I am just plain wrong on my valuation guess, but I don't like the
deal. Certainly I'm disappointed if that's the best management can do. Plus, as
one media commentator wrote, it's a trade in of an undervalued stock (SEG) for
an overvalued one (VRTS). And from now on, SEG will trade in tandem with VRTS -
I'm not thrilled about that either.

OTOH, as regards my SEG holdings, I'm looking at very quick paper profits for
just the short time I've been in the stock. So my "complaints" must be tempered
by my fortuitous circumstance here.

The widespread (i.e. not just this thread) discussion of SEG brings up
different investment styles and objectives. For me, I try to buy value when and
where I can see it. When I read posts/articles where people who don't own such
stocks are able to cogently discuss the undervaluation of the particular

Hi All:

Some harmonies from 81 year old Franco Modigilani- the founder of my child's
pre-school.

http://www.nytimes.com/library/financial/columns/033100norris-column.html

Modigliani's Message: It's a Bubble, and Bubbles Will Burst
RANCO MODIGLIANI says that the current mania for Internet and other technology
stocks is not irrational. But it is a bubble, and it will burst.

"I can show, really precisely, that there are two warranted prices for a
share," Dr. Modigliani said in a telephone interview. The one he prefers is
based on such fundamentals as earnings and growth rates. But, he added, "The
bubble is rational in a certain sense." The expectation of growth "produces the
growth, which confirms the expectation; people will buy it because it went up."

The trouble, he said, is that the bubble price is naturally unstable. It can
keep rising only so long as expectations keep growing. "But once you are
convinced it is not growing anymore, nobody wants to hold a stock because it is
overvalued. Everybody wants to get out and it collapses, beyond the
fundamentals."

Dr. Modigliani knows something about the fundamentals. Now 81 years old, he won
the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics in 1985 in part because of his pioneering
work in just what those fundamentals are. One of his insights -- which seemed
odd back in the 1950's when he was first propounding it -- was that the value
of a company's securities, including stocks and bonds, should be based on
expected future profits, discounted by an appropriate interest rate. That also
applies to the stock market as a whole.

By that light, it is not easy to rationalize huge price-earnings ratios. Dr.
Modigliani argues that it is impossible for the economy to grow as fast as the
market seems to be forecasting, even if some companies will do very well. "You
cannot believe that corporate earnings will rise forever at 7 percent," he
said. Eventually, "the entire national income will be taken by profits."

Such calculations can be ignored when investors think they see a bright new era
arriving, as happened in the 1920's with broadcasting and is happening now with
the Internet. President Clinton will be host of the White House Conference on
the New Economy next week.

Dr. Modigliani is not a man given to frequent outbursts on the stock market. I
called him after I heard that he had talked about bubbles in a speech to the
Boston Security Analysts Society. At his only previous address to that group,
in 1976, he mocked Wall Street for undervaluing stocks.

He says he thinks the Dow Jones industrials could fall to 8,000 or 9,000, but
that technology stocks are far more vulnerable. "In the case of the Internet,
it is so hard to establish fundamentals, to understand how much is a bubble,"
he said. "In my view, it is very much a bubble."

And then? "There is no bubble that quietly deflates. A bubble by its nature
will burst. I don't know when." But it will happen, and the pain will be
greater if the bubble has grown. He says the Federal Reserve is right to raise
interest rates, but may be moving too slowly.

It's not hard to find money managers who will privately admit they are
petrified but fully invested. Most of them studied Dr. Modigliani's work in
business school. Most have also seen peers who did not buy the hot new stocks
lose their jobs. Their nervousness increases with the market's volatility. With
yesterday's rout, the Nasdaq composite has suffered back-to-back declines of
more than 3 percent a day for the first time since the 1987 crash.

Dr. Modigliani began selling stocks about a year ago, and has no apologies.
"The only people who did well in 1929 were those who sold too soon," he said.
"The final test will be if the collapse comes. If it doesn't come, I'm wrong."

re: SEG

Here's a quick way of understanding the Seagate deal.

On Wednesday Paul owned .55 shares of VRTS, $5 in cash, Seagate's disk drive
business (worth $10-40 depending on whom you believe), and valuable shares in a
number of public and incubating technology companies (worth $10++?).

Today (if he didn't already sell in disgust) he owns .45 shares of VRTS, $5 in
cash, and that's it. The deal doesn't even give him all the shares of VRTS he
already owned, let alone the other stuff.

As Ben Graham wrote nearly 70 years ago, this is the kind of thing that happens
when everybody forgets that a stock is ownership in a business. Not that you
forgot that, Paul, and not that Seagate was a bad investment at the price you
paid, but it should have been a much better investment for you.

You and all other Seagate shareholders were literally robbed. Management (who
are very direct beneficiaries of this deal) justified it by saying they looked
for other bids and didn't get one, and this is a better deal than where it was
trading in the market.

Well there was a better deal out there. Spin off the VRTS shares directly to
shareholders - give them all of what they own. Dividend the cash to
shareholders. Even with just that shareholders are better off than they are
under this deal. And they would still own Seagate's market leading disk drive
business which could very well be bottoming in earnings and could triple in
value in the next cycle, plus the other tech holdings.

What a disgrace. I hope the company missed a D&O insurance payment so the Board
members can be held personally liable for what they just did. I did not own the
stock, but this is a matter of principle. What do we pay directors for if not
to protect shareholders against a deal like this? Some investment bank is going
to be paid to write a "fairness opinion" on this deal.

I worked for one of the largest Wall Street investment banks' mergers and
acquisitions department in a past life, so I think I know what I'm talking
about here. This is the most shameless transaction I have ever seen.

Peter, interesting comments which I do not entirely agree with. While I agree
that a bursting of the bubble will and has occurred for many NASDAQ tech stocks
(down 50%), I disagree with the implication that once burst that is it - like
conglomerates in the 60's which never recovered. I think that technology use is
growing so rapidly that those stocks will continue to be the leaders in any
bull market we have for the rest of my lifetime. Furthermore, you have old line
companies like AT&T with tons of money which support this area by either buying
companies or investing in these new technologies - NTOP (internet phone use)
being a current example. Any reasonable error in stock pricing is fixed pretty
quickly by 20% or more industry growth rates.

Why on earth would the mutual funds and pension plans approve such obvious

should be a tax free transaction. then each company can be auctioned off to the

Re: Video stores

Thanks for the response. That is exactly the kind of negative investor
sentiment I am trying to capitalize upon, but obviously I could be wrong.

Note that Hollywood Entertainment owns Reel.com, which is planning on testing
its own VOD plan on 2Q of this year. Hence, Hollywood is fairly well hedged
against technology innovations in the video market.

Blockbuster has its own website and partnership with America Online and is
probably working on similar technologies.

At 4 time cash earnings, MOVI need only see the current market situation
maintained for a few years for it to earn back its market cap. Given its rural
locations, I also think MOVI is less exposed to technological innovation in the
near future.

I could be wrong, and perhaps you know of technological innovations that I am
not aware of.

Elam. Yes, here's another disappointing semi-buyout. Two negatives would be:
ELAM will get stock/cash--- it's going to be another case of money in
management hands in search of a business. (Can the ELAM management team invest
the money wisely? -- I am not sure.) Secondly, since they've sold off what I
assume most people consider the attractive part - electronic contract
manufacturing - potential or current stockholders who might have, or will have,
invested because of this -- they will be gone. In other words, there's no more
potential catalyst that I can see.

On the other hand, the balance sheet is considerably strengthened. There is a
business left that ELAM can build on. It's very early, imo, to conclude that
this business is only worth what the market capitalization is - given that all
those who want out are getting out or got out and have driven the stock price
down sharply to its current level.

I subscribe to this latter view and have added back up to a full position
yesterday, buying at prices 5 3/8 and below.

MC-

Thanks for posting about video rental outfits. This isn't a private club and
your posts are clearly value oriented and appreciated.

My opinion: These cigar butts still have a few good puffs left.

I disagree with those who see video rental being displaced by Video-On-Demand
"in the next few years."

Yes, video stores are "an archaic method of distribution of electronic
content." But so are books! Yes, video stores will disappear in about ten
years. But "in the next few"?

In Thursday's Wall St. Journal, Walter Mossberg's "Personal Technology" column
describes the trials and travails he went through to get a DSL line. And what
are the results? "Videos of news events or movie previews, while still not as
quick or smooth as actual TV, are now at least watchable." Hmmm, and that's
DSL, about the best you can get at home today.

Yes, things will improve drastically over the next few years. FTTH (fiber to
the home) will eventually give us the truly fat pipes that all these business
models are counting on. But when will that happen? No time really soon.

And your point, MC, about rural locations of MOVI is quite valid. My home is
"out in the sticks", about fifteen miles outside a small metro area (maybe
300,000 people in the two nearby small cities). I can't get DSL. I have little
hope of getting DSL in next couple years. No cable either (and Video-on-Demand
over cable will take some more technical breakthroughs).

Except for pay-per-view, I don't see our trips to "the movie store" ending any
time soon. They'll make a killing on our late fees for years to come. And the
kids love to "test drive" video games at Blockbuster before buying them over
the internet.

Just my opinion, and always appreciate the views on this board. But I think
you're on to something here. The death notices are being issued a bit
prematurely.

Glad you brought these to our attention.

I'll look forward to getting to that level again before buying. I'd just feel

I take back what I rashly said about ELAM. If we can get it at near the bottom
of Friday's trading range, which hit the $4's, it is a spectacular value.

The Plexus deal represents about $3.50 per share in non-recurring gain, it
seems, having received $51 million cash for Net Assets sold of $24 million.

This leaves cash of $38 million and debt of $14 million. Total shares
outstanding are 6.8 million. Net assets will be about $85 million, and worth
who knows what?

The deal reduces gross income by about $6 million (Plexus paying 10x GP
pretax!), putting future net income in substantial doubt. Nevertheless, they
are not playing with fairy tales down there - the whole business is about as
pragmatic as you can get. I think they'll have a game plan.

To my mind ELAM management has demonstrated that they are dedicated to the
task, understand how to get good money in a deal, and have hidden value lurking
in their operations.

So, ELAM has the full share price in net cash in the company, plus lots of
other book value, plus a history of profitability - that is too good to pass
up.

onto tech stocks they bought at cheap levels years ago, and they held on as
they got fairly valued, then expensive, then in many cases manic.

But who are the ones who have done well over the long haul? Warren Buffett
clearly scoffs at the idea of momentum. Julian Robertson obviously does as well
and it killed him - but don't forget this guy wound up with a 25% return for
his partners since 1980 despite a 50% loss in the last 18 months. I have never
heard Mario Gabelli even mention the concept of momentum. Bill Miller would be
the exception.

What lesson should we learn from that? To emulate the value-momentum strategy
that has worked better than value alone for the last couple years? The answer
is a resounding yes - IF YOU THINK THAT THE FUTURE WILL BE LIKE THE LAST FIVE
YEARS. I do not. (And if you want to incorporate ideas of momentum into a value
strategy, why do value at all - why not just do momentum - after all, that has
worked the best.)

The strategy of buying stocks when they are objectively cheap and selling them
when they are a little north of fairly valued just makes too much sense for me
to abandon it now for a strategy based on metrics that I don't think have any
relationship to investing as I define the term.

I've been wrong for the last two years. We'll see about the next twenty. The
last three weeks, knock on wood, erased an entire quarter of big losses for me,
and then some. That would not have happened if I had given up on my discipline
when it seemed to make so much sense to do so - temporarily of course, as so
many value investors apparently did. There is no other way to explain the crash
in value stocks over the last six months and the simultaneous rise in techs.
Anecdotally, I saw many value investors - even professional money managers (I
might say especially professional money managers) give up and buy tech stocks
at exactly the wrong moment. For about a week they were telling me about 50%
gains. Haven't heard much from them since then.

Regarding video rental stores vs. Video-on-Demand, here's a link to a good
article which outlines the approaches of the various phone companies to getting
fiber close to the home.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=13330861

If we take 50% penetration of super-high-speed access (for VoD) as enough to
kill the video rental store outright, I still think we are about eight or ten
years away, with rural areas last, of course.

Wright, look at your own statement, " Yes, video stores will disappear in about
ten years." If you believe it, then video stores should be valued like oil
wells -- conceptually you have to recover both your capital plus a return out
of the current price over the next ten years. My point is not that they are
going out of business tomorrow but that traditional investment analysis would
value such a business at what seems to be a low price.

You mention DSL but do not mention cable. SFA is selling digital settop boxes
to cable companies like crazy, capable of delivering VOD as soon as the cable
companies choose to move. Time Warner (Oceanic) already has VOD getting going
in Hawaii, and trials in Tampa and Austin. Comcast and others are in trials as
well.

Jeffrey, you're entirely correct that these companies must be looked at
differently, with a finite lifespan of maybe eight to fifteen years (IMO), and
revenues declining in later years.

I misunderstood, thought you were taking the position that they would be gone
in the next 3-4 years, which I don't see happening.

It sounds like our area of disagreement is over the speed we'll see VoD-speed
connections become prevalent. I think that none of the current rollouts (cable
or DSL) are anywhere close to VoD speeds.

The actual VoD adoption time will depend on technology improvements which we
haven't seen yet, or which are just now coming out of the lab and into test
rollouts.

As a technical aside, my take on cable is that it will not dominate because it
is a shared bus architecture, like 10Base2 Ethernet (thinnet). DSL is a star
architecture, analogous to switched 100BaseT ethernet, where each user has
their own non-shared connection to the backbone. Sharing a coax with your
neighbors, even if it is "just" 24 houses per cable, is still sharing,
especially if you all want to download a different movie to watch on Sunday
night.

So, I agree with the poster who said that DSL (with speed improvements) will
likely dominate.

If you've had any reason to analyze the upcoming MetLife IPO, I'd love to hear

I am deep down a value player- and this is a value thread. ALSC had some $40
worth of public secuirities(admittedly under a lock up period) backing each
share plus its own business. Hard to see why it isn't worth buying at $18 1/8 a
share. CEGE based on my estimates has about $250MM in cash, 2.4MM shares of
ABGX worth $130 pershare today, company has at least one strong buy out there-
total is $562MM. CEGE market cap today is $600MM. ABGX is already down about
70% from it's high and CEGE has or is in process of getting around 500 patents
in its realm of biotech expertise. Comparable companies have marketcaps of
300-500MM without the cash and abgx shares. I think its a compelling value at
these levels, and much higher. MRVC has a subsidiary which IMHO is developing
into a serious fiber-optic company. The company has fingers in lots of pies and
the $2 Billion market cap for this company at the moment is relatively speaking
a joke. BVRT is esoteric but extremely cheap at these levels. I started
purchasing it at $16 because I thought it was cheap then. I am not suggesting
that one purchases these on margin but hard to see them not being a lot higher
in the intermediate future. Mr. Market is throwing out some babies with the
bathwater.

Video observations: I see crosscurrents -
Tailwinds helping video stores 3- 5 years:
*Near term price drops in VCR's and emerging DVD's boost rental demand
*Expanding penetration of home theater - likewise
*Negative longer term outlook discourages entrants
Headwinds hurtng video stores:
*Competition for time with internet - more TV viewing is background noise while
surfing
*Digital cable, satellite TV, HDTV [Saw HDTV & HD satellite combination
advertised @ Best Buy for $2500 - way below price point I would have expected
at this stage] each with multiple PPV represent competing alternatives for
video entertainment time & $$$'s
*VoD thru DSL would be way down the list, but could come on strong down the
road.
*Halflife of profitability will be a lot less than halflife of revenue due to
fixed costs - so it's not a question of when the last video store closes, but
how quickly the net fades from black to pink to red....and does the market
price under or overestimate this.

Bob, your final point on half-life of video store profitability is very
perceptive! I am curious why you don't even mention VOD over cable? It is in
trials in a number of markets now and up and running in Hawaii (on a gradual
basis). It also would be the primary source of additional revenue for cable
companies from these millions of digital settop boxes SFA and GIC are putting
out (able to handle it).

Jeffrey <<your final point on half-life of video store profitability is very

tendency of nearly any decline process without getting balled up in 'There's

opens the door for projections using statistical methods - know a good actuary

<<curious why you don't even mention VOD over cable?>> Because I'm not that
well informed of cutting edge developments [The comments I posted were off the
cuff not heavily researched] In the midwest, we get multiple pay-per-view
choices - 20+. With a VCR or the new TIVO recorders considering the
concentrated 'hit-oriented' nature of movies [top 20 releases at any one time
garner 90+% of demand/revenue] you have close equivalent to VOD without the
fancy infrastructure.

Paul, on SEMI, FYI since I know you own it:

http://messages.yahoo.com/bbs?action=m&board=4687915&tid=semi&sid=4687915&mid=4
26

In my opinion, we have wiped out a lot of speculators, and although tech stocks
will do better from some point, because they really are the growth engine of
our economy, the future will be less speculative and more earnings driven than
the past. Therefore, I think it is prudent to play technology only in
reasonably valued stocks with the strongest earnings momentum.

In my opinion, SEMI at a P/E of 5 on what I believe they will make this year,
not that much above liquid book value, growing at 10-15% per quarter, book/bill
of 130% for the March quarter, and without the risk of catastrophic losses in a
semiconductor downcycle that the semiconductor manufacturers have, was a
reward/risk no-brainer near today's low - even if it is "just" a semiconductor
distributor.

Thanks for the post on SEMI. I still own it and still like its prospects.
This market highlights opportunities for those investors who (unlike me)
maintain a fairly concentrated portfolio and who very closely follow and
evaluate their stocks. So that when the market topples like today, such
investors can take advantage of price dips with some confidence (assuming their
portfolios have purchasing power - are not fully margined) because these
investors are attuned to the fundamental value AND business prospects of their
companies. Congratulations for adding to SEMI.

Given my limited understanding of SEMI and its current high price from
my(our)buy price, I am content for now just to hold in expectation of further
gains.
