that:

Hi Clownbuck -

So where is the real Value Investment - What about Cash as a "value" asset?

The material stocks and commodities in particular may have already seen their
highs and could be headed a lot lower IMO. For me, there are better rivers to
fish and my top priority now is capital preservation rather than chasing
screaming value buys.

I believe a long term (7-10 years) deflationary period is possible (maybe now
30% probability) and as a results all prices could very well be a lot lower in
the future except for bare essentials (food and AG related equities). My
strategy is to hold out on any more commodity and natural resource buys until
next year and focus on yield and different safe holding buckets for my
investment capital.

If a worst case (or even a 50% worst case), I should be able to buy some
excellent value plays w/ my cash, perhaps 30% less than the current values. I
put http://www.cumtn.com/s/index.php?id=138 on my watch list today. They own a
75% interest in Copper Mountain (w/ over 5 Billion pounds of copper in the
ground). There are many other resource rich candidate located in Australia,
Canada and the U.S (hopefully avoid political risk staying in these countries).

If the slow Euro implosion continues, the probability of a world wide recession
comes into play that could further cause economies to contract. Even more QE
may not provided the stimulus to keep the U.S. growing. Testing the 2009 lows
now becomes a real possibility.

For me, it's not worth the marginal gain chasing new value candidates at this
time. I am still 80% invested in securities and preferred stocks which I
continue to hold (they generate income and I have low cost basis). Even in the
50% worst case, I expect these stock to lose at least 30% of their value.

For now, I am just trying to find calmer waters to hide in while I wait for the
market to correct to much lower prices. The value case for me, is "Cash if
King" (or cash equivalents) and eventually in 12-18 months I believe I can buy
most equities 30% lower. I continue to build my value watch lists.

There will always be some excellent "Special Situation" opportunities. Aurcana
Corporation (AUNFF) is a silver miner I recently bought at $0.756/share. Their
chart does not look exactly like GNM.AX but it is one I continue to add to even
at current prices (AUNFF last $0.98/share). As many of the large cap stocks
fall in value, many of these smaller cap stocks become exceptionable values
too.

That's my current "value" take. Remember to maintain some cash reserves as many
of the current value buys now, will become better value buys in 12-18 months.

Disclaimer: I have been wrong in the past and will be wrong in the future. My
views constantly change and at this time, that's the way I see things playing
out.

E_K_S, thanks for the color in your post. the deflation scenario is certainly
something to ponder, although it goes extremely against my observations. I see
inflation creep everywhere, at The gas pump (the recent lower prices
notwithstanding), salaries in low cost and resource countries rising rapidly,
medical costs, food inflation. the deflation thesis just does not seem to work
with these observations.

I do think that shorting Australian banks is worth a consideration, since the

IMHO, deflation scenario can only happen if we have US+Euro recession and China

However, in regards of oil, I've been Peak Oiler, but now I'm not so sure.
Shale oil+gas has taken a lot of wind from Peak Oil story for now. I don't want
to seem Monday morning quarterback, but I was thinking of selling my oil stocks
when oil was still over hundred, since I felt that it's quite possible for oil
price to drop quite a bit. We may be there already now or we may see $60's.

But oil is just a part of the picture, so oil price drop still does not

Hi Clownbuck - (Even your alias denotes the worthlessness of the $U.S. "buck",

I was alerted today about this article by Paul Craig Roberts. He paints a

long term effect on the World's economy. Is their an Exit Strategy that
minimizes the pain. Maybe, it's owning undervalued equites but only bought with

<blockquote>However, the $230,000,000,000,000 in derivative bets by US banks
might bring its own surprises. JPMorgan Chase has had to admit that its
recently announced derivative loss of $2 billion is more than that. How much
more remains to be seen. According to the Comptroller of the Currency, the five
largest banks hold 95.7% of all derivatives. <u>The five banks holding $226
trillion in derivative bets are highly leveraged gamblers.</u> For example,
JPMorgan Chase has total assets of $1.8 trillion but holds $70 trillion in
derivative bets, a ratio of $39 in derivative bets for every dollar of assets.
Such a bank doesn't have to lose very many bets before it is busted.Assets, of
course, are not risk-based capital. <u>According to the Comptroller of the
Currency report, as of December 31, 2011, JPMorgan Chase held $70.2 trillion in
derivatives and only $136 billion in risk-based capital</u>.<u> In other words,
the bank's derivative bets are 516 times larger than the capital that covers
the bets.It is difficult to imagine a more reckless and unstable position for a
bank to place itself in, but Goldman Sachs takes the cake. That bank's $44
trillion in derivative bets is covered by only $19 billion in risk-based
capital, resulting in bets 2,295 times larger than the capital that covers
them</u>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bets on interest rates comprise 81% of all derivatives. These are
the derivatives that support high US Treasury bond prices despite massive
increases in US debt and its monetization.US banks' derivative bets of $230
trillion, concentrated in five banks, are 15.3 times larger than the US GDP. A
failed political system that allows unregulated banks to place uncovered bets
15 times larger than the US economy is a system that is headed for catastrophic
failure. As the word spreads of the fantastic lack of judgment in the American
political and financial systems, the catastrophe in waiting will become a
reality.</blockquote>
I really do not want to be around for the end game. I do want to gobble up
those under valued equities with my $US while it still has some purchasing
power. What I want to avoid is buying too early.

It's all speculation but still it's reality. At some time to revert back to
normal, interest rates must increase. However, with trillions in "naked"
interest rate derivative products, it's different this time.

I just do not think it will be a happy ending.

I don't think the interest rate swaps (which are derivatives, but serve a real
business purpose in most cases) have anything to do with where the interest
rates will be in the future.

I don't quite buy in the bleak scenery- form e, the potential danger lies much
more in inflation than in deflation. Part of this is my upbringing in Germany.
Most Germans are hard wired to fear inflation much more so than deflation and
so am I. Also from past inflationary episodes, I know that you can have a
recession and high inflation at the same time, it is certainly not true that
swamping the economy with printed currency will keep it going no matter what;
in fact the risk doing just that is that citizens will loose all the confidence
in the currency, at which point the game is over ad hyperinflation is
unstoppable.

If you believe that your scenario comes to pass, you should short the market
aggressively and the only stocks to hold would be consumer staples with pricing
power, which would probably benefit from lower input costs.

I continue to add to several stocks that I've mentioned here, as their share

this morning. Here's a positive write-up from Seeking Alpha:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/659141-kronos-worldwide-insiders-have-bought-ov
r-1-million-shares-in-this-beaten-down-high-yielder?source=yahoo

Some of the positives could be clarified. "The stock yields 3.7%." This is so,
although going further, the distribution has been erratic, cut even. However
when times are good, the company seems to make payouts. Last year there was a
$1/sh special distribution (dividend), in addition to the "regular" $.15
quarterly.
Although the usual metrics look good (as the author states), the company has
had a couple of loss years too. So investors ought to weigh the importance of
the business cycle on stock price.

As regards, KRA, I have a few shares as I mentioned previously. This stock has
been discussed by richardred on his thread. For those with a Barron's
subscription, here's a link to a positive writeup in January of Kraton:
http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052748703879704577166833403224396.h
ml .
Kraton is a company with past erratic earnings (losses). What is happening is
that since the new CEO took over in 2008 he has directed this chemical
specialty company from commodities to more specialized/growth products or
areas. The low stock price may somewhat reflect that this process is not
complete or not significant or fully played out yet. I notice GMT Capital - a
10% beneficial owner - has added to its KRA position last month
(http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=KRA+Insider+Transactions), so I take that as a
vote of confidence in management. I have been considering if I will add to my

Value idea? Check out RTN: Nice, steady slope of growth.

One class of anti-terrorist weapon that will prevail over the long term,
regardless of budget deficit concerns: unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). For
defense strategists, pilot-less aircraft outfitted with ultra-sophisticated
sensors are a vital tactic in fighting the asymmetrical guerilla wars of the
21st century.

These UAVs are the darlings of reformers in the Pentagon, and Raytheon {RTN} is
the leader in the field by virtue of its unparalleled expertise in sensor
technology.

Raytheon currently supplies the sensors onboard many UAVs, including the
high-altitude RQ-4 Global Hawk.The US Air Force is seeking $1.6 billion in 2013
to buy Global Hawks, making these sensor-intensive machines a big winner in the
latest military budget.

Sensors account for 50 percent of a UAV's cost. Raytheon's sensors also are
prized by the military for their unique ability to penetrate cloud cover.
Raytheon continually develops lighter, high-reliability sensors - exactly what
the military covets most.

RTN currently offers a dividend yield of 3.8 percent. With comparatively little
debt and a strong earnings outlook for the next two years, Raytheon's healthy
dividend should be sustainable.

Raytheon's price-to-earnings ratio of 10.1 is well below the average of 17.2
for the aerospace and defense industry as a whole and pales in comparison to
the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio of 15.8. Also, Raytheon has surpassed
earnings estimates by at least 6 percent in each of the past three quarters.

Seems to be a great LTBH, that will grow dividend and earnings over time.

Yes that equity/share bit I know doesnt make sense, my mistake; it is not
supposed to be part of the valuation.

However, the $9 is the value of the plant, buildings and equipment per share
(PPE/share not the price to earnings ratio) as stated on the balance sheet of
General Dynamics. The value may actually be higher than $9/share. If I am not
mistaken, the value of the plant, buildings and equipment on the balance sheet
is not the real market value of the plant and property right?

But my valuation should be corrected to $57.8/share which includes the current
assets of the business + Earnings + Buildings and equipment. The company also
pays a dividend so this may alter the valuation above a bit too. This is
obviously and most likely not the true valuation of the business, given the
size of the company and stature in the industry, GD has a market cap of 23B,
could $64.86/share be a fairly priced stock that would offer enough of a margin
of safety? What is your opinion, value play? I noticed actually just now that
Berkshire Hathaway is invested in this company. Could there be something here?

What did you think of my NAV idea? Is it a value play-or just a trap?

Re NAV
I don't know what CA/share means. I think cash /share is not relevant unless
you count the liabilities as well. LT debt is 3.5B$ and there are significant
pension and health care liabilities from underfunded plans.

The under-funded status of our pension plans increased by $253 million during
2011 primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine the
present value of the projected benefit obligations. Our actual return on assets
during 2011 was approximately 4% for the U.S. Pension plans. The weighted
average discount rate used to measure the postretirement benefit obligation
("PBO") was 4.2% at October 31, 2011 compared to 4.8% at October 31, 2010.

The under-funded status of our health and life insurance benefits increased by
$884 million primarily due to a court ruling ordering the reinstatement of the
prescription drug benefits which existed prior to July 1, 2010 for participants
who are Medicare eligible, as well as a change in the estimate of the future
rate of increase of reimbursements from Medicare for retiree medical benefits.

We continue to seek opportunities to control our pension and other
postretirement benefits expenses.

You are double counting by adding CA and PPE to equity, since equity is all
assets (including CA and PPE) minus all liabilities. Why would you double add
them again?

In reality, GD has 13.8B book/value and negative tangible book value. So, no,
you cannot value GD based on assets and come out with any "margin of safety".
You have to do some kind of DCF or other earnings/CF based valuation for that.

Yep, I get what your saying; the Equity/share disregard it. See post 48335.
Okay, so I need to
subtract current liabilities from current assets- this is what you are saying?
I thought intrinsic value was
Assets+dividend/share + Earning power ( agreed I need to discount future
earnings too) + a value on definititive prospects as stated in security
analysis? So therefore, I dont need to subtract liabilites from assets? So why
do we subtract liabilities then yes.

With regards to equity that was definitley a mistake- i know the accounting

Rail leasing/rail manufacturing. I'm guessing GMT (GATX) would fare about like
TRN. I picked TRN for my tracking position because it seems more concentrated
in rail cars and trades closer to book value. Additionally, I like its
relatively low forward p/e. (Of course though, reiterating -- it's always a
dangerous thing to do to rely on analysts' estimates.) Also as I scan TRN, it
looks to me that TRN has a somewhat lower relative p/sales number now than it
has generally had than does GMT to its (GMT's) history. Otoh though, GMT has a
somewhat more consistent history (or maybe the word is more persistent history)
of increasing its stated bv. Plus GMT pays a much larger dividend (yield) than
does TRN. GMT wins again on having a better (higher) roe historically. However,
imo each company shows at best a mediocre return on equity on average
historically.

I guess I'll conclude -- from the the superficial way in which I'm looking at
these two -- one's about the same as the other ---and it could be that neither
is attractive enough for a value buy at their current prices (given the
companies' decade's sub-par/mediocre roe's). And so if either is bought now for
the companies' possible favorable business prospects, maybe it should be for a
tracking position only at this time. So I agree with you on position size.

<blockquote>I thought intrinsic value wasAssets+dividend/share + Earning power
( agreed I need to discount future earnings too) + a value on definititive
prospects as stated in security analysis? So therefore, I dont need to subtract
liabilites from assets? So why do we subtract liabilities then
yes.</blockquote> I think this is incorrect too -you can either do a valuation
based on asset value, or you can do it based on earnings power but you cannot
add up both, since you have to have assets (including current assets and some
cash ) to run the business and generate earnings. Now if you have excess assets
that you know are not needed to run the business, you can add this to the
earnings valuation.

NAV does not seem like an asset play, the negative tangible book value
indicates this already.

Hi Ditch -

FreightCar America Inc. (RAIL)
http://www.freightcaramerica.com/
2011 Annual Report:
http://www.freightcaramerica.com/PDFs/FCA_Annual_Report_2011.pdf

You might want to look at RAIL. I have no position but have been tracking the
company for the last 6 months. They are a pure play for U.S. rail car
maintenance and manufacturing but I have not really compared them to GMT.

GMT is huge w/ operations all over the world. I really liked their exposure in
the Natural Gas Compression Equipment Leasing space but it is very small
compared to their other operations.

RAIL's order book is up and produce a wide variety of new rail car and
suspension systems. The company also has a large repair and service business
too. Financially, RAIL's forward PE is under 10, has no long term debt and pays
a dividend that currently yields about 1%. Their PE is 90% of the industry 5yr
rate so their is the possibility for PE expansion. Still, ROE of 2.5% is not
that exciting for me.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=RAIL+Key+Statistics

EPS are heading higher after plunging negative in the 2008/2009 market crash.

<img src='http://www.advfn.com/p.php?pid=us_fin_graph&symbol=RAIL&type=5'>

Tangible BV is $15.45/share.

I prefer those companies that have a larger leasing segment that generate much
larger cash flows. For that cash flow, then you must accept a much larger debt
load. In 2011, RAIL did form a new railcar parts, repair, maintenance and
maintenance management business. As this segment of their service business
grows and they land more annual service contracts that provides their customers
better "life cycle" fixed maintenance stability, maybe they can offer more
customers a "buy" & "annual service" option contract rather than do the
traditional lease back contracts.

I decided to accumulate shares in BOX. I started buying shares 9/2011 at prices
around $11.50/share - $12.50/share. I hold these shares in the IRA and look at
BOX as an REIT for containers & generator equipment. You get exposure to Rail,
Trucking & Shipping.

<blockquote>SeaCube Container Leasing Ltd. operates as a container leasing
company worldwide. It principally engages in the acquisition, leasing,
re-leasing, and subsequent sale of refrigerated and dry containers, and
generator sets. The company?s containers are used to ship products
internationally and facilitate movement of goods via multiple transportation
modes, including ships, rail, and trucks. SeaCube Container Leasing Ltd. leases
its containers primarily under long-term contracts to various shipping lines.
As of December 31, 2011, it owned or managed a fleet of 594,071 units,
representing 933,499 twenty-foot equivalent units of containers and generator
sets. </blockquote> <u>The Good:</u>

PE = 6.76
ROE = 19.3%
EPS Growth (yoy) = 14.8%
Cash Flow/share $4.50/share
$1.12/share annual dividend (6.05%)

<u>The Bad :</u>

At almost 2x book, it's expensive. My cost is around book.
Tangible BV = $10.16
BV = $11.26
<u>The Ugly:</u>

Total LT Debt = $550M ($27.50/share) -
LT Debt/Annual Net Income = 14x (I prefer no more than 4x)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I still think there are a lot of pipeline companies that have yet to be
consolidated and/or built. The smaller pipeline companies control very
strategic long term leases that the big boys need. You might look at some of
the rail roads (ie http://www.cpr.ca/en/Pages/Default.aspx or http://www.cn.ca/
) to see if they own their "right-of-ways", which could be used to build new
pipelines. My favorite is CP. If they ever get back to the $50 price range,
just their land ownership interests would be worth that price.

Hope that helps. I looked at that whole railcar Oil transportation theme about
a year ago, and did own GMT for awhile but sold it. I have and continue to
search for those pipeline company's that own the land leases for their
pipelines. To me, that is where the "real" value lies.

About GD: "could $64.86/share be a fairly priced stock that would offer enough
of a margin of safety? What is your opinion, value play?"

I don't know what the margin of safety is for this company because, I've no
opinion on what its business might be like if the US defense budget shrinks. On
the other hand, we (USA) seem to be in continuous, unending wars in which we
fund well our prime contractors (e.g. GD),GD also has a substantial weapons
business with foreign companies, and GD has a commercial aerospace business. (I
bought my GD shares because I like the prospects for business jet aircraft in
Asia.) On the metrics <u>I</u> look at, GD is a value play at current prices.
Because the stock itself seems to me to be cheap based on its historical
performance -- p/e, p/b, roe, etc. Not because I believe there's a margin of
safety with it at current price. The stock has been falling; I suspect it could
fall further if/as a "guns vs. butter" economic argument is made by one or
another of the USA political parties' representatives. For me, I've recently
sold my GD shares -- maybe if the stock falls further on no adverse news I
might be tempted to reenter.

WPX Energy, Inc. (WPX) -NYSE

Upped my small position in WPX by 50% w/ a small buy last week. That now
includes my WMB spin off shares from 9/2009 and a buy in 8/2010 @ $10.36. No
real reason for WPX other than it builds the position to an even lot, oil & NG
prices are still relatively low and WPX was near a 52wk low.

My overall position in the combined WMB & WPX still only rank the position as
18th in the portfolio.

I am trying to reduce the number of my holdings (still around 87) by closing
smaller positions and putting the proceeds into what I consider undervalued
current positions. WPX has under performed mainly because of the lower oil
prices.

I have tried to force myself to buy more oil & NG companies as Oil trades in
the $80/barrel range and even more if we see $70, $60 or even $50. It will
bounce back. I just have to be as disciplined to sell some of those shares when
oil trades back up to $110/barrel, $120/barrel or at "peek" oil prices of
$170/barrel.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

My only other buys come from different real estate deals I have been working
on. The value proposition is to buy the real estate assets, complete all the
fix up (includes labor & materials) and own the asset at $100/sqft or less. I
am able to rent out the properties generating $10.00/sqft per year cash flow
(or more). Eventually I plan to fine tune the monthly expenses & revenues w/
moderate levels of historically low cost financing (around 3% 15yr fixed
money).

I am trying to buy these assets at 50% (or less) of the commodity value and/or
building costs. I did a lot of this in the 90's w/ the S&L blowup. I am finding
equivalent bargains, higher annual rents and my contractor labor rates are
about 80% of what I paid in 1990. My material costs (depending on what one
buys) are about the same or higher than what I paid in 1990.

As the values present themselves I could see moving 30%-40% of the portfolio
into this sector. Currently it is around 17%.

I appreciate the "rail " discussion, learned a lot this weekend. I never
realized that when a train passes, the bulk of the cars seen are actually
leased through a third party, something like 70%. Interesting stuff. I think
Buffet's company is one of the few that actually owns a number of their own
tanker cars and that is only through a position in another private company (40%
if memory serves).

Anyhow, everyone have a great week ahead,

I like the idea of petroleum products being able to be moved to a location
where they are needed(like in refineries) or where they can bring the highest
price. Can't just up and move a pipeline, gathering lines maybe. But I believe
this will become more common as many of the wells drilled in the shale areas
are of the short life duration type, so transport flexibility will be
important.
(Not to mention profit in 2 directions, fracking sand, pipeline, cement etc.

I continue to buy shares in KSB3.DE. I posted of this stock before in this
board. Currently trading around 36o-370 Euro. Earnings are estimated to be
40-45Euro this year. Stocks are trading around book value (mostly tangible) and
the company has net cash on the balance sheet (~ 30% of the market cap)
EBITDA/EV ~4x. KSB is a large pump manufacturer in Germany with worldwide
activities, controlled by a family. There is a decent LT track record and the
company and their markets have improved over time (due to consolidation I
assume).

Compare this to XYL, trading at ~9x EV/EBITDA. XYL is a better company (by

AAR (AIR): I continue to add to position as stock falls.

Even with lowered expectations, stock would be at a relatively low p/e. Perhaps
though, issue is same as with GD and defense stocks generally. Namely, as
regards past government (military) business, who cares what was: The defense
budget is or will be cut or curtailed, and thus so many of these companies'
stocks might fall further and stay there.

With AIR, it's now trading on what as of now is tangible book value
(http://www.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&btn=s_ok&mode=&symbol=air&s_ok=OK)
--- that might or might not be low enough to provide a floor to the stock drop.
Company has a commercial aircraft component that seems (to me) to be doing at
least okay, and that may offer a small prospect of better times for the

Hi Tapcon -

RE: Penn Virginia Corporation (PVA) -NYSE

I have sold out my position but still have the company on my watch list. I have
noticed increased volume in the stock for the past 90 days which may indicate
that there is renewed interest in the company. PVA has good land holdings and
at the current price would probably be a good one to hold in a basket of
companies.

It's been almost 18 month's since I started accumulating companies in my basket
of E&P stocks. Since then I have tried to narrow the holdings down to 10
companies where drilled wells, land holdings, available cash and overall growth
of the company was criteria I used to buy, sell or hold the candidate company.
PVA did not make my cut.

At the current price PVA might make my initial selection but so far their well
success and management of their land resources has not been that good.

Of the company's you listed in the attached link, SSN is my favorite and I have
recently added shares around $1.60. I have closed out my position in USEG and
GMXR. I do own the preferred shares of GMXR but prefer GSTpA if you are
interested in preferred shares. One NG company I have been building a position
in is XCO and at the current price of $7.00/share may be the safest pure NG gas
(if any NG play is safe). That is XCO owns 51% interest in TLLG Midstream MLP
that is worth about $2.50/share.

From your list, PVA probably ranks No 2 to SSN.

Please post any news on PVA as it develops. From my review last year, there is
a lot of potential for the company to create value but so far the only thing
management has accomplished is to burn cash IMO.

Nik, I have read about China's Five Year Plan for its power grid.

http://www.sgtresearch.com/insights/2012/0416/79.html

There are several large companies that are establishing a foothold involving
this investment theme, IBM, GE to name two, but they are not pure plays.
Probably the closest pure play is ITRI. There are several recent posts on this
thread about ITRI and its leadership in the sector but more negatives than
positives.

ITRI has opened a new manufacturing facility in Suzhou Industrial Park and is
participating in China's five year plan. I think that ITRI's ongoing
restructuring, which includes the Suzhou initiative, will result in lower
margins from increased capital expenditure for at least a year or two.

I am interested in what you come up with.

Here's another web sight for smart grid ideas:

Investor AB is the investment vehicle of the Wallenberg family. It trades at
the discount, but it may trade at that discount forever. There is a dual-class
share structure in Investor AB (as there are in many of the Swedish and Finnish
companies) in which some shares have greater voting rights than others. Since
the Wallenbergs own roughly a quarter of the outstanding shares in Investor,
but control 50% of the voting rights shares, it may trade at a permanent
discount to assets (unless the company is liquidated - which is very unlikely).
Investor has underperformed the EWD Sweden ETF for some time now. I'd also
rather now be bogged down with Ericsson in my portfolio.

EXCO Resources Inc. (XCO) -NYSE

Out of 1/3 of XCO closing out a covered call buy write position. Was able to
average down remaining shares and still book a small profit.

Commodities rising on relief rally IMO so trimming my profitable holds. Still
waiting for another down leg in this sector before I build back positions I
have previously sold.

The value proposition for holding companies that deal with fluctuating
commodity prices is very hard to time (especially the macro cycle). If one
looks at some type "reversion to the mean", it's still a bit early to re-enter
the market (commodity prices still at/near peak levels.

I am looking at a long term play in copper. Copper Mountain Mining Corporation
(CUM.TO) -Toronto controls huge reserves in the metal and if/when world
economies slow, I expect shares in this company can be had at a "value" price
relative to historical copper prices.

I am still researching the company, but plan to start a small tracking position
and build that position if commodity prices continue to fall.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=58741

This could be a 6-18 month accumulation period depending on how long it takes
world commodity prices to return to historical lower levels.

Copper Mountain's main asset is the 75% owned Copper Mountain mine located in
southern British Columbia. <u>The Company has a strategic alliance with
Mitsubishi Materials Corporation who own the remaining 25%</u>. The 18,000 acre
mine site has a resource of approximately 5 billion pounds of copper. The
Copper Mountain Mine commenced production in the summer of 2011 and is Canada's
newest major copper producer with mill throughput of 35,000 TPD. The average
annual production target is approximately 100 million pounds of copper with
gold and silver credits.

Navistar International Corp. on Wednesday put a takeover defense in place,
adopting a plan that would drive up the cost of any hostile bid for control of
the troubled heavy-duty truck maker.

The move, a type of poison-pill strategy, comes in the aftermath of investor
Mark Rachesky's disclosure last week that his investment fund had acquired
nearly 14% of Navistar's stock and activist investor Carl Icahn's raising his
fund's stake in Navistar this month to about 12%. Other large investors also
have been adding to their positions in the company.

WPX is very cheap and has a good balance sheet for a gassy play., trading for
~0.8$mcfe of gas in the ground. They also have somewhat wet gas and a few crude
reserves. The question for me though - why bother with NG companies that want
to transform themselves into wet (NGL) and oily plays, while the more oily
plays like HES, APA, MRO and DVN are already dirt cheap? HES trades for
~10$/BOE (>70% crude and a lot of non US gas) for example. APA just had a very
good looking Investors presentation where they make a credible case for high
single digit reserve growth without stretching their balance sheet. they have
been a very good operator over the years in good and bad times and i would
gladly own some at ~80$/share (my target)

I own already enough HES but APA and to a lesser extend DVN look like good
plays to me. I sold COP because it did not fall as much, due to it's dividend
but trades at a somewhat higher valuation in terms of proved reserves (~20$/brl
proved with quite a bit of North American NG)

pension and health care liabilities are probably about $1.2 - $1.4B from what I
can tell, but they have had pension issues since the 80's.

I don't own it, so I have only done cursory DD. Combined with their
manufacturing debt - NAV seems to have a built-in poison pill, but there are
some sharp characters getting involved who know way more than I do.

Hi Ditch -

When I was looking at rail options to move NG & Oil it did make a lot of sense
even w/ the premium one might pay per barrel of oil (I believe it was as high
as $5/barrel for rail transportation vs pipeline). I discovered that there were
these new NG rail cars that were designed to carry compressed natural gas.
These same cars were being developed to provide the trains fuel too which
almost halved the cost of traditional diesel fuel. So now, using rail to move
NG becomes an economical option so rail is not exclusive to only oil.

I am not too sure what the refinery does to the NG but if it is treated at the
gathering station before it is compressed, the new NG rail cars could be loaded
at the head end of the gathering treatment plants and put alongside the oil
tanker cars for rail transport to the U.S. coast refining hub.

In fact, the CNG rail cars could theoretically be dropped off at different
terminals so compressed NG could then be trucked to land based NG filling
stations. CNG can now be transported by both rail and truck too. So if they do
not want to export this fuel (our Gov is not providing NG export licenses),
then why not use NG as the primary fuel to transport domestic oil in tanker
cars?

The overall value proposition begins to make sense for everybody.

Here is what I posted late last year:

About Statoil: It's one of those Scandinavian companies in which I hold shares.
Looking to add to position if stock will drop a bit more.

I like that STO seems to be aggressive in acquiring assets worldwide for future
years' development. And the company appears to have long-term plans and actions
for the development of those assets.

Annual dividend yield after foreign tax withholding, I show to be about 3.75%.
(The annual dividend amount has fluctuated year-to-year, which is common with
many European stocks.)

I agree with your first two statements.

However:

<blockquote>Even with years of good earnings, net tangible assets are still
negative.</blockquote>This is mostly due to the share buybacks. This may not be
intuitive for some investors, but buying back shares lowers book value. This is
one of the reasons why book value or growth in book value is not necessarily a
very good indicator of value for companies that buy back a lot of shares.

Now TPX bought back some shares at inflated values, which is bad. However, in
general, you can't blame a company for negative tangible assets if they buy
back shares prudently. :)

http://goo.gl/9GKR9

I am concerned that wold economies are in for a sustained slow down and that
commodities will continue their sell off. China has reported slower growth. I
recently read a good case for $40/barrel oil which makes my portfolio
vulnerable. Therefore, I decided to book my profits from my AAUKY buy from
1/13/2009 @ $10.47 taking $16.40/share. I also lightened up on my MHR preferred
shares booking some gains and moving the proceeds into the EXLpB shares.

EXL has exposure to Southern CA real estate (ie mini malls) and has a low debt
profile (for an REIT). As you pointed out insiders have been buying the common
shares so their preferred shares should be a safe place to hide.

To offset gains, I sold equivalent high priced shares in ERF which has recently
sold off due to a recent dividend cut and low oil prices.

I still need to review the portfolio for more commodity exposure and decide
what needs to be sold and what I am willing to hold if these assets become 50%
cheaper. This is a cyclical sector and prices will eventually recover. I have
been through several of these so, I will book some of those profits now and
look to buy into many of these commodity rich companies at much lower levels
next year.

As another hedge for the portfolio and to protect against a sustained sell off
if we do see a world wide slow down, I have doubled up my UVXY shares that I
plan to hold. These should lose 2% of their value every month but do not expire
like a PUT option. I expect market volatility to accelerate if we see Oil sell
off and this hedge should help reduce my paper losses on the oil stocks I plan
to hold long term.

I am taking a more defensive position but still maintaining a position of 80%
equities and 20% cash. My equities consist of 15% preferred and 10% utilities.
I plan to lighten up on non dividend paying high value issues and/or commodity
based equities as I review my holdings.

 If the buys are made at prices above book value/sh. If buy backs (and
