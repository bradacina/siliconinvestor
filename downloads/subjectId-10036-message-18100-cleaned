Buying a little HPC this am. That's Hercules, not the old Hewlett-Packard
Company. whose acronym we old-time calculator users remember. HPC is very
strong in pulp/paper specialty chemical business - not that the pulp/paper
business is an exciting growth industry though. Looks like HPC is beefing up
its other niche businesses too. (Aquistion announced today.)

HPC has okay p/sales number (imo), and its forward p/e (12/2004) is under 10.
In good times (apparently 1999-2001, for example). the stock (now about $10.+)
has sold for $20 or more. HPC's chemicals and expertise will continue to be
used in a variety of industries. I'll bet this stock might trade again at $15
or better, sometime when/if the general economy picks up.

Paul, since I think you own SEMI, I still think this is worth accumulating and
will see a price of $10-15 in 2004. This is a cyclical play on the strong and
getting stronger semiconductor industry recovery, not a great long term
investment.

Anyone interested should read the latest quarterly release, Yahoo posts 11933,
11942, 11943, and note that industry leaders ARW and AVT are at new highs, and
peer NUHC just broke out of a long trading range today. Company has a buyback
program in place and in Q3 bought a bit less than 1% of the stock back at an
average $3.80. Selling below tangible book value of $5.

GMK has some problems - nobody's heard about the stock, it's Mexican basically,
the stock isn't as cheap as it used to be, and they may have lawsuits pending
against them (unfair trade). Insiders control the company through their large
ownership, and the stock is thinly traded. On the positive side, GMK are big in
their business, they are technologically innovative, and they have several

Nov. Insider Stock Sales Hit 2-Year High

Thursday December 4, 12:16 AM EST

By Joseph A. Giannone

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock sales by top U.S. corporate executives reached their
highest level in more than two years in November, a bearish signal at a time
when the stock market has surged amid strong growth in the economy and company
earnings.

Last month corporate executives cashed in $4.5 billion worth of their own
companies' shares, up 43 percent from October and nearly double the five-year
monthly average, according to Thomson Financial's Insider Research, which
tracks insider transactions.

Meanwhile 3,680 executives from 1,592 companies engaged in share sales. Both
measures set five-year highs.

In recent weeks investors have been barraged by positive economic data and
better than expected third-quarter earning reports, sustaining a rally in U.S.
stocks. On Wednesday the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broader
Standard & Poor's 500 Index reached 18-month highs, while the Nasdaq Composite
Index briefly broke the 2,000 barrier for the first time in 22 months before
pulling back.

Yet heavy insider sales could give investors pause, since top executives and
directors are perceived as knowing their company's prospects best and therefore
the figures can serve as a gauge of executive confidence.

Technology company executives sold $1.3 billion of company stock last month,
the sector's highest level of profit-taking activity since early 2001. Finance
sector sales reached $802 million, its highest in five years, while healthcare
executives disposed of $580 million worth of shares.

Insider Research also observed that 56 companies so far in the fourth quarter
have exceeded their highest quarterly volumes in at least five years. Among
these companies were CBRL Group (CBRL), Genzyme General Corp. (GENZ), Nike Inc.
(NKE), Rite Aid Corp. (RAD) and Sears, Roebuck & Co. (S), Insider Research
said.

Stock-buying activity last month also pointed to a waning of confidence.
Insider purchases rose 67 percent to $105 million from October, well below the
historical five-year monthly average of $172 million.

Moreover $42.98 were sold for $1 of stock purchased last month, the seventh
straight month the sell-buy ratio remained in "very bearish" territory -- well
above the $20 mark. Still that represents an improvement from October, when the
ratio hit $59, its highest level in at least a decade.

Among those identified taking advantage of robust prices were executives at
Fortune Brands Inc. (FO), which saw its first insider sales since July and
whose shares recently reached an all-time high.

And six XM Satellite Radio Holdings (XMSR) executives combined for the biggest
quarterly sales volume and their first disposals since late 2000. The company's
shares surged 10-fold in the past year, Insider Research said.

Fourth-quarter activity at credit card issuer Capital One Financial (COF)
reached record levels, continuing a trend of increasing sales. Lee Enterprises
Inc. (LEE) insiders posted the biggest combined sale as its shares trade at
record highs.

Meanwhile retailer Saks Inc. (SKS), hovering near a 52-week high, saw its
highest sales levels since 1999

November up 15% with market neutral status, mostly due to large gains in my top

Godot, I am holding ALVR, PCYC, GSH and EONC. I was buying EONC in the past
couple months, even last week. I did not post here since it is not a VALUE
play. It is a growth play.
I had 35% cash a week ago waiting to short. But my technical indicators are
showing it is not the top yet, so I bought a large liquid stock AMAT at $20, I
can sell it any day without market impact, and turn short. I won't use those
35% cash for any small illiquid stock since I may have market impact when I
sell.

I will not post any move I make in the market, but my 300% gain is real in a

Paul, I was really really lucky lately and thank you for your positive comment.

This is an email I sent out yesterday. I don't recommend you to buy any stock
and this is just for the record on what I am buying/selling.

I sold all VICL and buying into PCYC. They are in the same biotech/cancer drug
business and PCYC is 30% under valued than VICL according to my proprietary
model.

Best,

From: Steve168
Subject: I am buying PCYC near $4.5. 7/8/2003

The biggest gain in stocks was probably already made
in the past 3 months, but the next 10% is surer,
because the big trend is clear: Money is flowing from
fix-income securities (bonds, money market, etc) to
stock market. People are sick of 0.5% money market,
and realizing the risk-free interest of bonds are
becoming interest-free risks.

Deeply undervalued stocks are very hard to find, my
major holdings ALVR, VICL, DUSA, AIRN and EONC all
reached/passed cash value from 30-60% discount to cash
just couple months ago. My portfolio is up 150% in
the past 2 years, no margin, no options, just
long/short US common stocks. The model is built on my
12 years experience in the market, value oriented (big
fan of Graham and Buffet's early years) combined with
technical analysis and my proprietary Internet data
mining tools (I wrote the program).

There is only one buy from my model, and I am buying
it - it is PCYC. It is a beaten down biotech trading
at 30% discount to cash, with no debt and tolerable
burn rate. It has cancer drugs in phase III trial and
early results are positive. I am buying the pipeline
and intellectual property for free. There is
significant risk of buying any stock, and I don't
recommend anyone to buy any stock.

Arghh. Suffering here today with thread fav., ANF. ANF was supposed to be a
growth stock at a low p/e.

http://www.forbes.com/2003/12/04/1204automarketscan07.html?partner=yahoo&referr
r=

I trimmed my position today. I don't like selling into selloffs, but for now
ANF isn't meeting the sales growth expectations I had when I purchased the
stock.

ANF's been successful in past and imo has a unique franchise with clever
management. ANF's subject to whims of teenage fashion, so I guess there're
times when ANF's in style and times when they might not be. I expect the
company and stock to do okay over time. In case I'm wrong though, I'll be more
comfortable holding a smaller (by 30%) position.

I spotted TSIC, another clothing brand company, on the new lows list. I'll use
funds to start a small position in it. High price/book value coupled with many
well-known brands attracts me. D/e is 1.16, I'd prefer less; current ratio
seems a comfortable 5:1. If (IF) company can reverse its seemingly downhill
spiral into oblivion, it's possible this stock could be a very decent
revision-to-mean play.

fwiw, I'm still holding positions in other retailers mentioned here, e.g. BL,
PERY, SCNYB, ZQK, SKX, GADZ (ouch). Today is not a good day to be a holder of
stocks in this sector:

How many stocks do you own paul and how on earth can you keep tabs on all of

followed more closely by others who share their wisdom.
I tried an interesting speculation today purchasing january 05 leaps in BMY. My
thought process being that BMY looks pretty solid, and with erbitux being
approved in switzerland, there will be a ton of pressure to have this approved
in the rest of europe and the us in the near future. standard and poors
currently has fair market value for bmy at 28-30. the stock closed today at
around 26.20 and the 25 calls good till January 05 go for 2.90. seems like a
very small spread to me. although more experienced options traders will put me

I have over 200 positions now. Really not that difficult to monitor when you
have computer access and Yahoo. If you group stocks by sector, you often see
stocks in a particular sector moving together on the same news. Of course if
there's company specific news, and it's positive, you get a sector-beating pop
in that particular stock. Conversely, a drop on bad news.

I want to own stocks at good prices. Whether that's a good company at a fair
price or a cigar butt at a very good price. Then I expect that I will try to
wait until management & employees deliver some positive performance (in the
case of cigar butts),or they continue to deliver decent results (i.e. for those
good companies). It's my belief that following a particular stock or business
too closely is not that helpful. I do like Dale Baker's highlighted quote from
the Al Frank Fund on this:

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=19530556&s=impressive

For illustrative purposes, I'll take a specific sector, and go through some of
my ideas or reasoning. In the insurance/banking/finance areas I have over 35
positions. If we look at one of the better known companies that has been
discussed here several times, Washington Mutual, we would generally see that
the stock's had its ups & downs, but the company has pretty much delivered on
its promises. If somebody only had this one stock in the sector and held it for
the past few years as it was mentioned here, I suspect they'd be doing okay now
percentage-wise. Similarly for most of the other companies discussed here such
as ABK, MBI, C, BBX, MAXF, etc. At several points on the timeline there were
places where the stocks might have been bought or sold. If not bought, it turns
out to have been an opportunity forgone. If sold, it ALSO turns out to have
been an opportunity foregone. Because if the person sold, although they might
say they bought something holding better promise, they nonetheless left money
on the table with a stock they already knew something about.

1) If they owned any of these stocks: To me they could have compromised -
rather than swap out for something else, they could sell only partial amounts
and let the company managers continue to work to deliver more stockholder
results. Or better yet, imo, the stockholder if he/she had funds, could just
hold the position and go find something else to invest in. So, for example, I
have long-time small holdings in C and BAC, and these are stocks I normally pay
scant attention to. (Although the Fleet merger with BAC has been an alert for
me to increase my BAC position.)

2) If potential investors did not buy any of these stocks: Assuming they could,
why did they not? Even for the most tiny amounts the percentage gains would
have been substantial. And even with such few shares, if the portfolio has a
few such small positions, those 20, 50, 100, 200% gains add up. Examples here
would be AACE, WRLD, WES, ACF, etc. etc. that an investor might've made just
small bets on.

Now I see an opportunity in dominant AIG. Selling for an uncharacteristically
low forward p/e. This stock should be bought now to see stock gains in '04
and/or '05 (imo). I am upping my position, and it won't be a problem for me
because I've held small amounts for a few years, and I've learned something
(not that much though) about the company because I'm already in the sector.
However, if I only had 15 or 20 or 25 positions and I believed in
pigs-at-trough investing (only so much room at the trough; something's got to
go to make way for a new buy), I would be reluctant too to make a 6.6% or 5% or
4% commitment to this stock. Especially if in order to buy, I had to give up
something elsewhere that might, in this booming market, still have potential
too.

I don't know what's going on with this company. The balance sheet is fantastic

Dale, the fact that the market has gone up from several months ago while the
heavy insider selling has continued just makes me MORE nervous.

It doesnt invalidate the indicator at all.

Did you pick the exact top of the tech bubble ?

The relentless insider selling and the lack of insider buying combined with the
fact that I cant find stocks I find attractive tells me the RISK is higher than
I am comfortable with.

I am interested in a good RISK-adjusted return.

Anyone can bet everything on red and win, it doesnt make it a good bet.

Im not 100% cash. But I do have the most cash that I have ever had in 20 years.

If you want risk-adjusted returns pick low PE stocks, diversify across sectors

Careful stockpicking and portfolio management is not a "bet" to the extent that

Just an idea, but it seems like you could accomplish your goals by using ETFs,

Once you hold 35 financial stocks, your performance is less likely to vary from
a good fund or CEF.

From:Paul Senior
To D. Baker: (long)You have a point there about ETFs & CEFs. I'm not that
knowledgeable about them - maybe I should become so.

Given that I am holding 35+ financial stocks at this point, my performance
going forward might indeed mimic a basket of such stocks in an ETF. I'd like to
believe though (and I could be quite wrong here) my cost basis for some of the
typical stocks would be lower than the fund's. For example with stocks like C,
BAC, AIG, HBC, ABN, etc., although I'll get the same results now going forward
as any fund that holds them now does, I hope though that I added each of these
shares to my portfolio only at those times when those stocks were at what I
perceived to be bargain prices.

Also - and I could be wrong here again - the funds don't seem to go deep enough
into the sector. For example, in November, I was buying insurance company NWLIA
(post 15793) and adding to it (post 15874)when the stock was at lows. In
another example, I believed I saw value when I followed you into ACGL. I'll
guess that neither of these stocks would be picked up in a CEF or ETF. (I
suspect many of your picks wouldn't be in a brokerage's CEF or ETF.)

In addition to depth issues, I'll guess the funds don't have the breadth issues
with a sector. That is, they just aren't specialized enough. For example, in
Nov '02 through March '03 I posted I was buying the auto retailing sector,
specifically UAG, GPI and SAH. (Aside, you might recall the thread warning 9/03
you posted from an analyst who said the stocks were topping. He/you were right.
The stocks have come down (not yet to those prices of last year though); I'm
still holding most of my shares.)

As regards the almost oxymoron now of a "good fund", sitting here pondering
that, I'd like to keep going doing what I'm doing for the next few years and
after that - or if my circumstances suddenly change - I actually believe -from
what I can see here (SI) and what I suspect - instead of transferring
substantial monies to funds, I believe I'd prefer - and might really be better
off - letting YOU manage a decent portion of my family's assets.

Paul Senior

(Disclaimer to thread: I've never met Dale Baker, never corresponded with Dale
Baker other than publicly on SI, have no personal or business relationship
w/Dale Baker or to my knowledge his wife/family. I don't even know if Dale
Baker is a real person -g-. Also, no disparagement meant to anyone here- there
seem to be several posters here who have good money management skills, decent

Paul, I put my money where my mouth is and also added at the end of the day
yesterday. I see downside risk to $4.00 where I would add more. However there
was an 8,800 share bid at $4.40 all day today (visible on Level II) that no one
touched.

I am comforted that in Q3 "the Company repurchased 34,893 shares [roughly 1%]
of its common stock at an average price of $3.80 per share" (10Q). The company
sees the same value I do, under tangible book value of $5. I also think at this
stage of the cycle receivables are good and inventory may actually be creeping
up in value.

I also loved this from the quarterly report, "The strengthening of market
conditions has continued into the beginning of the fourth quarter with sales
and bookings reaching levels we have not experienced since the first half of
2001." They did $130M and 100M sales the first 2 quarters of 2001, versus $83M
in Q3 2003. Taking the midpoint of $115M, they should be reporting that level
before too long, if not in Q4 because of the holidays. That level should be
worth quarterly EPS of 25-50 cents. Furthermore, with the SIA (Semiconductor
Industry Association) looking for a 19% growth in sales for 2004 over 2003,
peak sales of $125+M seems to be a no-brainer - where SEMI would make maybe 50
cents as a single point estimate for a peak quarter.

Also note this from the quarterly release, "the Company is continuing to
explore avenues to accelerate its presence beyond the boundaries of North
America". The inference from the preceding sentence about growth being
"particularly in Asia" is that they might be considering doing something there.
I have zero knowledge of what they might be "exploring". However, if "low float
SEMI" and "China" were ever to appear in the same sentence, you can imagine
what might happen.

Although the stock hit nearly $25 in the last cycle ending in 2000, I am much
more modest this time, looking for $10-15 sometime in 2004.

(I also don't like the D/E. That is a key reason you don't want to own it in an
industry downturn.)

FDG caught my eye because they are shipping part of their production to China.
China will be a huge net energy importer over the next few decades. The recent
bump in coal is also driven by natural gas prices and the perception that older
power plants may switch back to coal if NG becomes too expensive.

Stocks keep rising, even as insider selling soars

By Bill Rigby

NEW YORK, Dec 5 (Reuters) - One of the surest signs of a stock's long-term
direction is what executives are doing with their own stake in the company.

When insiders dip into their pockets to buy their own company's shares, a rise
in price is often not far behind. When they sell in large quantities, the price
usually falls some time later.

But for the past eight months, insider selling has soared to unprecedented
highs, as company executives have taken advantage of rising prices, with the
main indexes recently setting 18-month highs.

What gives?

"Insiders tend to be right, but they tend to be early," said Michael Burke, who
for 20 years has monitored the stock market for technical analysis firm
Investors Intelligence.

"Starting in April we saw a huge increase in the amount of insider selling, and
it is making records practically every week," he said. "It is not necessarily
bearish for now -- but three months from now."

Insider buying or selling tends to catch up with the market a year down the
road, Burke reckons, after seeing the trend repeated several times.

"(Insiders) tend to buy their stocks when they think they are cheap -- this
usually turns out to be a good idea down the road." he said. "If you go back to
1994, insiders were buying like crazy and investment newsletters were bearish
as anything. The Dow was getting ready to take off from 3,700 to 11,000 in the
next five years."

Now the opposite is happening, as insiders sell and market pundits expect the
Dow to steam through the 10,000 mark again.

BEARISH RATIO

Insider selling has ballooned over the past eight months, while purchases have
remained stubbornly low, according to data from Thomson Financial.

November marked the highest insider selling since May 2001, with corporate
executives unloading $4.5 billion worth of their companies' shares, but buying
only $105 million worth -- or $42.98 worth of stock sold for every $1 bought.

For the past seven months, that ratio has stayed above $20, the level Lon
Gerber, Thomson Financial's director of insider research, considers an
indication of "bearish" sentiment, or the feeling that stocks will eventually
fall.

Gerber calculates that over the past 10 years, in the majority of months where
the sell-buy ratio is above $20, the stock market ends lower six months later.

The current period is testing that hypothesis. The ratio has been above $20
since May, yet the stock market has soared in that time. At Thursday's close,
the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was up 32 percent from closing lows in
mid-March this year.

But Gerber stands by his theory, saying all the classic signs of a likely
downturn are there. Insiders are selling in numbers not seen for five years, he
says, as they take profits from the market's run-up, while buying is staying
extremely low.

"The fact that we are seeing a pick-up in selling does point to us that perhaps
the first quarter of 2004 we might see a little bit of a pull-back," he said.

Short-sellers, who sell stocks in the expectation that they will fall and buy
them back at a profit later, are poised to take advantage of falling stocks.

Company insiders are just not buying their own stocks, said a portfolio manager
at a New Jersey-based hedge fund that specializes in short-selling.

"It's absolutely amazing to me," he said. "They could be wrong, these guys are
not professional investors, but as a short-seller, it certainly is an indicator
for me. The market has been down for two years: they just want some liquidity
-- they want to get out."

perhaps you could shed some light: how does this take into account exercise of
options? where perhaps the insider is paying $2 for a $20 stock but holding
onto it. that would be very bullish for me. what if the same insider converts
at at 2 and then sells at the market price of 20. is that then a ratio of 10 to
1. or 1 to 1?

Paul & Dale, I do see value in Paul's strategy of buying a large number of
individual stocks rather then index funds. One of the reasons why i do not like
index funds that much is because they do follow the market with all its excess.
Index funds always contain a certain percentage of Mo-Mo stocks that can hurt
the performance when the market turns sour. For example if one had bought an
S&P500 "ex" index fund in March 2000 without the 100 most expensive stocks per
P/E ratio, my guess is that this hypothetical fund would have come far far
ahead the regular S&P 500. This is essentially what I see Paul is doing. It's
probably more similar to owning a value fund but with much more flexibility.
One can design a strategy on betting right or on avoiding mistakes - both will
beat the market if done correctly, IMO.

I think the larger number of options in recent years is having an effect on
insider selling...but, it doesnt account for the relative lack of insider
buying.

I would rather an insider BUY shares at $20 than exercise an option at $2 and
hold.

I am of the opinion that the option plans at many,many companies is pretty much
THEFT directly from the pockets of shareholders.

Its a heads they win, tails we lose situation. If the stock doesnt go up, they
either reprice or issue more at lower prices.

They get the best of both worlds. They dont incentivise insiders, they just
enrich them unjustly.

All that being said, I STILL take the excessive insider selling and lack of
insider buying as a negative...or a neutral at very best.

And it worries me.

As far as I am concerned, something that has predictive value a long time down
the road is worthless for managing a stock portfolio. I am reminded of the
mid-1990's when VTSS had gone up 7 times from a major base and insiders were
selling like there would be no tomorrow. The stock subsequently went up many,
many times more before collapsing.

My guess is that many of these sellers have not had a good stock payday in over
3 years and their selling is completely understandable. After all, I am sure
they do not count on only salary for their compensation and as a source of
money to pay for things like college educations for kids, etc.

Paul's strategy is completely beyond my skills. I won't buy stock in a company
unless I believe that I can develop or have a great deal of expertise in the
situation. Otherwise, I can't know whether I should be buying, selling, or
doing nothing at any point in time. The most I can manage is 10+ stocks owned,
and maybe a similar number I know enough about to keep a close eye on for a
buying opportunity.

For example, I probably now know as much about FARO, which I recommended here
at $2+, as anyone in the country, outside of management. For me, anyway, it
took this kind of knowledge to still be holding most of my position, and to
have a view of the long term for the company that supports that action.

Note, however, that I deal exclusively in microcap stocks, which is different
than identifying historically cheap. out of favor, large cap stocks, like a
MRK.

Jeff, I have a similar strategy, believe micro/small cap will outperform out of
a crash. I bought(posted here) ALVR under $2 when it had $3.5 cash, no debt,
and cash burn rate of 10 cents/Q. The deeply undervalued play is becoming a
growth star and market leader in Broadband long-distance high-speed wireless
access - I believe this service will likely be the "next big thing" in 3-5
years. That is the reason I adjusted my sell price target along the way, end up
holding majority of the 120K shares now at $11.40. This sector is becoming
strategically important and I bet the decision makers at CSCO and QCOM are
probably scratching their head on how do deal with this - to buy ALVR or a
competitor? No guarantee ALVR will remain the market share leader but so far
this year it is gaining market share based on my rough calculation.

I will not be surprised if ALVR reaches $20 in a year, or even $40-50 in 3
years, unless being bought at lower price. I will probably hold most of the
shares at that time.

I missed the EMC and CSCO 20x run by sold too early, rode PHTN from 3 to 65,
SINA from 1.5 to 40, I believe my vision is getting sharper and execution skill
is getting better, ALVR could be my third home run - and this time I will make
a kill.

I would agree with you on both counts. however I still consider it very bullish
if an insider exercises his option for $2 on a $20 stock. pays taxes on the
gain and holds all of the stock. I understand that options provide an
incentive, but it can certainly be abused. I believe that it would make sense
to require a lengthy holding period after exercise of options. Repricing of
options should be made illegal it is outright theft and i see no benefit of
doing so either for the company or its shareholders. I try not to buy shares in
companies that have repriced its options in the past. Seprecor and Cendant can
succeed without me. I will not buy shares in Semi because i remember that years
ago they had a very generous plan where management gets some percentage of
revenues as an incentive. seemed like a heads I win tails you lose deal for
shareholders. I dont follow the company anymore and jbash is welcome to correct

TimbaBear: I have the other viewpoint as regards "look at the performance of
those I've selected rather than those I've passed on." Since I'm very
diversified with many positions and my DD must be in far less depth than those
who own and/or follow only a few stocks, I have to believe my standards for
making a purchase are far less stringent than other people's. That is, I don't
have a rigid set of purchase criteria (e.g. compared to some whose portfolio
concentration requires them to be very certain of their purchases and maybe,
for example to only look at value not growth, or no microcaps, or no history of
insider sales or no tech). In other words, somebody has a portfolio of ten
stocks, they want to be very right in their choices-- moreso than I would have
to be with exploratory positions under .5% of the portfolio.

So I'm always very interested in seeing why I wouldn't and didn't decide to
purchase even a starting exploratory position in stocks that subsequently
performed very well. And it concerns me greatly that I would fail to see or
ignore something positive pointed out to me about a stock - something so
relevant apparently that the market would then at some point, price the stock
10 or 20 times higher.

ALVR? I have mentioned it 4 times at $1.86-7, now at $11.40, I still believe it
has upside to go and holding tight. I am sticking my neck out here again, as I
did with PCYC and EONC on this board ;-)

Steve168, regarding ALVR, yes I have small position. I've posted on it a couple
of times, I'd guess since 5/'01 when I started to buy. My shares were bought at
these prices: $7.41,$7.0, $5.9, $5.78, and $1.7.

I find the typical problem with a diversified portfolio is that it's difficult
to really know enough about some companies - especially small, relatively
unknown tech companies - when I first buy them. Without knowledge means less
confidence and less conviction. Thus I am subject to FUD (fear, uncertainty,
doubt), and this sometimes leads me to prematurely sell stock. As regards ALVR
as an example, I've sold some shares as the stock has risen this year at $2.65
and $4 (6/30/03).

You guys with big positions in these small tech companies are too tough for me.
Perhaps you might be right that ALVR will rise to $20 -- it's even been much
higher than that in good times. OTOH, a terrorist bomb in the wrong place in
Tel Aviv, something new introduced by Cisco or other well- capitalized
competitors, a market correction, a change in technology or standards regarding
wireless technology, well imo, any of that could drop the stock far below what
it is selling for in today's bull market.

I'm holding on though, and I'll ride along with you on ALVR. I won't take the
risk of this company doing real harm to my portfolio, so I don't get the reward
possibility either. I will continue to make a small but decent $ profit and
good percent gains if the stock continues its good performance, but I won't get
life-style-changing gains you have with your large number of shares and heavy
weighting.

aside: Interesting article in today's NY Times about an apparently
unsophisticated investor, a rabbi, who turned $50,000 into $7,000,000 and then
lost it all. I remember him being interviewed a couple of years ago as getting
in on the beginning of the company CEO's cable buildup and subsequent baby bell
purchase. And he was confident of the CEO and the stock at those elevated
prices. At that time I figured the guy was either darn lucky and/or a genius. A
guy though who didn't know when to say "enough". OTOH, a person doesn't get to
quickly run $50K to $1M or $2M or $7M on one stock by selling shares.

Yes, but so what? Would you rather they got a similar amount paid as a bonus,
but not explicitly related to profits. I don't mind management having a strong

I obviously sold too early on ALVR and a host of other companies that from my
undiscerning eyes looked unappealing at well above their cash values. I noticed
that the Prudent Speculator has bought many of these same companies, and that
they have been willing to hold a bit longer in order to exploit potential
speculative upside moves.

However, this has been a record year for small and unprofitable or marginally
profitable enterprises, and my sell discipline has kept my risk and overall
exposure to market swings quite low over the years. (I have noticed that these
stocks, when cheap and beaten up, are not well correlated with the market, but
once they start getting rich, they tend to have high betas.) As such, I am not
willing to increase my risk by holding these companies. I'd rather just buy
other, cheaper stocks.

What surprises me is that there is any positive correlation between companies
that at one time sold below cash value and future earth-shattering growth
enterprises. I figure that the market would be smart enough to not let too many
of these future CSCO's sell below cash value. However, I must admit that I do
not understand growth stocks very well, which is the reason I generally avoid
them.

I feel better, and my wallet feels thicker, when I don't make all-in or all-out
decisions. Just keeping even a few shares instead of selling 100% of the
position, gives the psychological boost of being in and riding a winner; of
diminishing the regret one experiences in seeing a sold stock go on to even
greater gains without the investor.

That's if the stock advances further. So many, many have continued upward in
the past few months though. Maybe the market will take these additional paper
gains away, but maybe the retrenchment of those small amount of shares kept
won't significantly diminish portfolio overall gains.

I started a new position in DAR. Very mundane business. They collect and

Paul,

I agree with not making an all-or-none sell decision, but I have been selling
1/2 at increasingly rich levels and can only sell 1/2 so many times before it
is not worth my time to deal with :)

However, this strategy did work pretty well on MOVI, if you recall that
recommendation from a couple of years ago. I bought a ton of shares around 4.0
and promptly watched it drop 10%, but was able to sell my last 1000 shares
around 30.00. The sell 1/2 strategy worked out well because I bought too many
shares to begin with, so I had plenty of shares to keep selling 1/2. (I
remember thinking about where I'd sleep on the couch if my wife saw that first
brokerage statement.) Now I strive for a much more diversified portfolio.

Somewhat off topic: At that time, I remember taking it personally when some
other board members puked on that MOVI recommendation. I've grown up a bit
since then. For me, the main thing is to share ideas and make money, not to
strive for positive recognition. If someone disagrees with my stock
recommendation all the better because it gives me something to think about.

I agree with you that there is probably a negative correlation between
below-cash stocks and future earth-shattering enterprises. That's why I hold
them longer once they start to prove themselves.

I bought 15 below-cash stocks in Feb 2003, now sold most of them after doubling
or tripling, only hold 3-4 stocks that proved growing fast in past 2-3 Quarters
and has big potential. As for why I think they have huge potential, that is
from my 20 years successful business experience in technology industry. I
predicted Flat Panel monitors would replace CRTs in 1998 and bought PHTN at
cash value $3, sold at $65 in 2 years. I thought the number one Internet portal
SINA would have a good chance to come back so bought at cash $1.5, sold at 10,
20, 30, 38. I started a PC assembly shop in a Beijing University dorm (like
Michael Dell)and grew it to an extremely successful enterprise, a major
subsidery of a blue-chip tech company traded in China now. Those business
experience gave me tremendous edge over MBA type investor/managers. That's how

Started very a small exploratory position in eastern coal hauler, NSC, today.

In an interview w/Jeffrey Gendell in Barron's this week, he is VERY positive on
steel and coal. (Also housing, but that's another story) He expects an export
boom driven by commodities. Very interesting to me, because I frequently have
seen his name show up as a HEAVY buyer of dinky, small banks when I've gone
researching them when they show up on my screens. I've never found any of these
banks strike me as especially attractive, so I've wondered why this character
is going around the country establishing large positions in them.
Well, another of his bets - and according to the Barron's tout, he has a VERY
good track record for anticipating these things - is that coal demand
(increasing because of favorable shipping rates from USA ports) will propel the
employment and economies of eastern USA cities where people live who will do
the mining. Thus, the local banks should prosper and thrive in a multiple
number of ways - increased deposits, increased loan demands.

Can't say whether everyone now is too aware of the demand China is placing or
will place on commodities - coal stocks are at highs after all. So is NSC; so
only a most small bet for me now until I understand the situation a little
better. If coal production is going to significantly increase as the
stocks/stock market seems to be saying - metalurgical for China build out,
and/or heating coal for USA people - NSC will haul its share.

ANF and WM:

I sold my ANF position today. Raising cash. Not sure what to do with the WM
news today. I'm feeling like I should've sold at $46, and now it's too late.
With this startling news and big gap down today this could be dead money for a
long, long time. Feeling like a deer in headlights!

Column snip from TSC:

WaMu slashed its earnings outlook for the fourth quarter and next year, and
said 900 of its current workers would join 4,500 others who have been shown the
door since August. Most startling was news that the volume of mortgages it
originated fell by half from the third quarter to the fourth.

...

As early as July, a chill began to settle on the refinancing market, after
long-term interest rates and 30-year mortgage rates both suddenly rose more
than a full percentage point. The Mortgage Bankers Association's index, which
measures total home-lending activity, has fallen from a summer high of 1,635 to
685 in the most recent weekly survey.

In fact, the day before WaMu's warning, Countrywide said it financed $22
billion in home loans in November, down 24% from October and off 31% from a
year earlier.

But financial analysts said investors would be wise to make distinctions
between the different mortgage lenders, and said some of the problems WaMu is
experiencing aren't shared by all firms. Industry experts point out that part
of WaMu's problem is its rapid nationwide expansion and difficulty in merging
its many operating systems.

"The problem with WaMu is it has grown to a huge size too quickly without
pragmatic systems to control risks," said David Hendler, an analyst with
CreditSights, a small ratings agency. "We've been cautious on them for a
while."

Hendler said WaMu's problems also stem from its failure to hedge itself
properly for the upswing in interest rates. By contrast, he said,
California-based Countrywide has done a better job hedging its exposure to
interest rate fluctuations.

Hendler said Countrywide is more adept at managing interest rate risk because
it uses a more modern and sophisticated approach for valuing the derivatives
and other hedging techniques it uses.

A recent CreditSights research report puts Bank of America in the same camp as
Countrywide but finds potential problems with the hedging strategies employed
by WaMu, Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM:NYSE) and National City (NCC:NYSE)
. According to the report: "Some mortgage players are not using the best
hedging tools due to short-term earnings concerns."

In fact, some of CreditSights' concerns about WaMu were borne out in the third
quarter, when the bank blamed the sudden spike in interest rates and hedging
problems for a net loss of $126 million from mortgage loans. The bank said it
responded by setting up an internal "SWAT team" to make sure the problem didn't
recur.

...

WaMu is now telling investors to set their sights lower. For this year, the
bank estimates total earnings of $4.15 to $4.25 a share. That's up from 2002's
earnings of $4.02 a share, but well off the Thomson First Call consensus
estimate of $4.42.

Next year, it sees earnings of $4.30 to $4.80 a share, compared with its
original estimate of $4.70 to $4.80.

In contrast to WaMu's downbeat news, National City and Doral issued statements
Tuesday in which they said the mortgage banking business was doing quite well.
In a regulatory filing, National City said it expects a fourth-quarter
"rebound" in mortgage banking revenue.

Regarding WM, if refinancing goes away, WM should quickly be able to sever the
expenses associated with this aspect of their business. Meanwhile, the company
is a strong national presence in its banking segment. Dead money here doesn't

PLMD has at least a couple of good things about it. It apparently has a good
history of showing high profit margins, and I see a generally improving ROE - a
figure now up to 22%, according to Yahoo. They are proud of their strong cash
flow, and mention in their latest quarterly the benefits of that good cash flow
- "infrastructure improvements, increased liquidity" and increased dividend.

If it's lawsuits against management that have dropped the price of the stock,
eventually they might be resolved satisfactorily I'd guess; meanwhile I'd
expect the company to continue its good sales and earnings performance.

Given PLMD's good margins, good ROE, low d/e and a relatively low p/e (p/e is
under 12, and in many past years it's averaged higher), I'd say the stock could
be a buy at this point for patient investors who maintain a diversified
portfolio.

Of course that's just MY opinion based on a quick look. (And I'm wrong many,
many times.) May I ask what attracted YOU to buy PLMD?

It appeared to me that legal issues with PLMD were already factored into the
stock. It provides products, such as diabetes testing kits, which require
repruchases. I think the direct-to-consumer medical supply business is a
growing market. It's revenues and net income have been consistently increasing:
Revenue: 2000: 156.9m; 2001: 220m; 2002: 279.7m; 2003: 356.2m
NetInc.: 2000: 16.5m; 2001: 29.7m; 2002: 30.4m; 2003: 40.2m
Cash flow: 2000: 29.5m; 2001: 54.5m; 2002: 66.4m; 2003: 82.9m
Similarly ROE has been increasing; low debt. and it appears to me to
undervalued. I would not expect major gains in the stock but I would think it
would have steady upward movement in price consistent with its earnings.

Quasimodo, re.: PLMD. Okay, thanks. I briefly looked at that link you
mentioned. It's not strikingly clear to me how valid the short sellers' claims
are.

To my mind the major negative claim seems to be as follows:

Revenue has artificially been pumped up in the way the company has dealt with
Medicare or Medicaid. This either has been done knowingly and very possibly
fraudulently by management, or if not, it's still nevertheless significant that
the revenue stream will likely be reduced as the government continues to look
closer at PLMD. (I gather that would be products/services/advertising
claims/billing procedure/billing amounts/etc. etc.)

I don't see how the average investor (e.g me)can figure out what the specific
rules or regulations are, and then ascertain if they're being violated. The
government health care morass is just too complicated. This in itself is a
reason to avoid PLMD, or any company perhaps, whose business model depends on
arcane and changing rules of the government health care area.

Paul Senior

(My concluding opinion continues next PLMD post)

Regarding PLMD: Well, I agree, Sepster.

Either the company is peppered with very crooked managers or a flawed business
model - in which case the stock could be cut in half, at least, from here - or
maybe it has problems typical of aggressive businesses (e.g. -g- has only
somewhat-crooked managers - i.e they push the envelope too far in dealing with
the government). With some companies/managements like this, sometimes (it seems
to me) the government takes action but doesn't cause the business to crater.
And some of the issues facing PLMD have been brought up before, so might
already be factored into the stock, as you suggest.

I'm one who often buys after looking in the rear view mirror. In past, and up
through last reports, the numbers and ratios we've talked about here for PLMD
look very good.

I'd guess maybe the upside for PLMD stock price from here is say maybe 20-40%
near term (whatever near term means) However, there lurks the possibility that
the downside could be severe. Given what I see though and how I like to invest,
I'll bet the probability of an eventual upside move is higher for the stock
than it is likely the stock will be chopped as a result of the negative issues
brought forward by the short sellers.

I've started a VERY small exploratory position today.

Jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times.

Re PLMD -
the company has a good balance sheet, so it's not an Enron, however its
earnings are of poor quality. For example S&P's cash flow estimates differ
materially from their companies own statements:

Cash flow: 2001: 54.5m; 2002: 66.4m; 2003: 82.9m
S&P cash flow 2001: 54.5m; 2002: 66.4m; 2003: 46.5m

Just a preliminary glimpse at the balance sheet confirms the suspicion that
earnings & cash flows are overstated by activating what is usually considered a
business expense.
From Yahoo balance sheet data I deduct that:
- current assets have increased by 10 m$ over 9 month
- total liabilities have increased by 7 M$ (why have LT liability charges
almost doubled in 9 month to 20M$ ???)
- Property plant and Equipment has increaed by 12M$, intangible assets have
increased by 12M$ !!
- payed about 10M$ in dividend
- the company does not seem to buy back stock

The earnings quality issues as well as the issues with Medicare, FBI
investigates as well as the fact that quite sophisticated shorts like Asensio
are betting against PLMD are strong red flags to say the very least.

For me, earnings and management quality are more important than valuation. That
is a lesson I learned after investing in EP, ELN, MIR and WCOM.

likely fight with strong competitor PSS (who are suffering also). In an other
area, FTS's Just For Feet competes with Foot Locker which seems to be doing
okay (psr=.65, stock at highs). I don't know, but it seems to me there's not
much difference between these two mall stores. I assume they sell mostly the
same brands. Seems like IF FTS could get it together before they stop spiraling
down, they could be able to get a fair share of the mall shoe sales and see
some earnings and a sharp stock price improvement.

Bennett Environmental Included in S&P/TSX Index
Wednesday December 10, 4:24 pm ET

OAKVILLE, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 10, 2003--Standard & Poor's Canadian
Index Operations announced today that Bennett Environmental will be added to
the S&P/TSX Composite Index as of the close of trading on December 19, 2003.
Bennett Environmental will also be added to the S&P/TSX Small Cap and S&P/TSX
Industrial Indexes.
Benefits of inclusion are increased market demand for the Company's stock from
purchases from Index and some mutual and pension funds as well as increased
attention and greater visibility for the Company's stock.

Bennett Environmental is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (Trading Symbol
"BEV") and the American Stock Exchange (Trading Symbol "BEL").

Other news item:

OAKVILLE, Ontario, Dec 5, 2003 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Bennett Environmental Inc. is
a North American leader in the high temperature treatment of contaminated
soils. As we approach the end of the year, this update is being released in
order to inform shareholders of recent progress made by Bennett on several
fronts. This includes the launching of new remediation services including new
contracts, new acquisitions and the status of construction at our new facility
in Belledune, New Brunswick.

Sales

In most cases, contaminated sites across North America contain varying amounts
of contaminated soil and construction debris requiring offsite removal and
treatment prior to recycling or end-disposal. Bennett operates treatment
facilities and offers these services today. In addition, these sites often
contain large amounts of lightly contaminated soil that can be safely and
legally disposed of in specially engineered secure landfills. Bennett has
recently concluded brokering arrangements with several firms throughout North
America who operate these secure landfills. We can and now offer our customers
a competitive "one stop shop" package for transportation and disposal services
for all their contaminated soil and construction debris waste streams. This
week, Bennett has received its first contract worth $12M US for the
transportation and disposal of lightly contaminated soil destined to a secure
landfill. This new service is now an on-going part of our full line of service
offerings, and Bennett expects this to be a significant new portion of revenues
going forward.

Acquisition of ELI Ecologic International Inc.

In its continuous search for alternative treatment technologies, this week has
been very eventful for Bennett. On December 1st, Bennett closed on its
acquisition of ELI Ecologic International Inc., a subsidiary of ELI Ecologic
Inc. The purchase includes a pilot test facility, operating permits in Ontario,
and the right to use and licence the technology world wide except for Japan.
Bennett intends to improve and carry on all aspects of this business, which is
complementary to Bennett's thermal treatment services. Bennett now has the
ability to offer a complete range of turnkey environmentally safe remediation
services.

Belledune New Brunswick Construction Update

As of this week, we have now completed all the weather sensitive work on our
new facility in New Brunswick. By the end of this month the structural work on
the buildings will be substantially completed. To date the project is one-third
complete. This includes construction of the building, and the manufacture and
any retrofit of the thermal equipment. The project is on schedule with the
commissioning stage anticipated to begin in May and full operation in July
2004.

The community and surrounding region have been very supportive of the project.
All levels of government remain solidly behind the proposal and have never
wavered in their backing, despite strong attempts by certain special interest
groups to misrepresent the long-term environmental effects of the plant. We
would like to thank everyone involved in the project for their co-operation and
the high level of encouragement we have received.

You'd be surprised at how rapidly car is becoming the main mode of

this past October. The road system is definitely not catching up with the
amount of cars that has grown since then. Traffic jam everywhere. As for GSH, I
have not looked into its financial so I can't comment on that, but I found the
buses to and from HK<->Shenzen<->GuangZhou and several other cities are

Building a highway system seems to encompass such a wide variety of industrial
businesses and opportunities that maybe a mutual fund might be a decent vehicle
(-g- sorry) to play this. Here's a Forbes article that mentions some funds and

http://www.forbes.com/2003/11/24/cz_jd_1124watch.html?partner=yahoo&referrer=

So many of these stocks have already moved up quite a bit on the assumption of
the apparently insatiable demand-pull of the Chinese population for an
increased standard of living and for business opportunities that seem to be
available to entrepreneurs and investors.

The above Forbes article slips in a reference to a Brazil fund. I'm looking at

good yields (8%+) in high cash-flow companies, but they won't be AAA rated.
That's how the income security market works.

Portfolio update - TMA
shorted TMA yesterday at 27$. TMA is a mortgage REIT. the company initiates and
invests in Mortgages.

Why short -
- Mortgage business slowing down
- Margin erosion (see WM)
- credit rating downgrade will increase borrowing cost
- 15:1 leverage is very risky
- chart looks toppy

+ dividend

TMA in my opinion is mostly a highly leveraged mortgage bond fund trading at a
premium of 70% to book value. If the spread disappears or interest rates move
in the wrong direction or defaults in the portfolio increase the shareholder
capital could be destroyed quickly.

MSFT: Started today with modest position @26.91. With a forward PE of 22, it
can only be considered cheap compared to itself and other big players in PC's
DELL & INTC. Next month Win 98 will no longer be supported & 20+% of users, at
least home users still have it. PC's bought for the Y2k upgrade cycle are
getting really long in the tooth even considering there's less reason to
upgrade every 2-3 years as in the 90's. Lower $ helps it, as does push to get
Asians to actually pay for software. Technicals look reasonably attractive.
This is neither a true value stock nor a moonshot play...If it gives me 15%
nearterm, I'll take it.

I sold CSCO recently, part of the reason being its valuation in comparison with
MSFT. The majority of valuation parameters say MSFT is much more of a relative
value than CSCO; MSFT has a pristine balance sheet with that huge cash hoard.
While I sold CSCO, I continue to hold MSFT, and agree - and hope;>) - that it
can appreciate another 15%, although there seems to be a lot of resistance just
below that level.

Oil Refiners: I still like VLO, but rather than add more shares, I decided I
would just diversify yet further among the sector with a very small buy of PCO.

From Dec. 4 DJ Business news:

"Bill Greehey, chairman and chief executive of Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE:VLO -
News), and Tom O'Malley, chief executive of Premcor Inc. (NYSE:PCO - News) ,
have said cleaner fuel standards that go into effect next month will limit
imports of refined products and help margins for U.S. refiners. O'Malley
predicted more volatility for margins with higher highs and higher lows.

A consultant for a prominent oil industry consulting firm is also bullish on
refining. 'It looks like we're going to have several years through this
transition period (to cleaner fuels) when margins should be quite good, but
volatile,' said Kenneth Miller, a vice president with Purvin & Gertz Inc. in
Houston."

The stocks in this sector are already up quite a bit. I'll make a small bet
that there's further price appreciation and that PCO will tag along as well.
(Although from the numbers I see, and my unsupported gut feelings, VLO still
remains a better buy.)
