Opposite of your viewpoint:

"With more than half of McDonald’s total revenue coming from outside the United
States it is easy to see how a weaker dollar helps earnings. Revenue generated
in foreign countries gets repatriated at a better rate of exchange. With the
United States Federal Reserve lowering interest rates to add liquidity to the
credit markets and banking system, the dollar is sure to depreciate in value.
This is a great thing for companies like McDonald’s trying to grow globally.
Now when McDonald’s repatriates money out of currencies like the Euro and Yuan
they will get more dollars in return"

Hi Steve - I am looking at PPL too but would like a slightly lower entry point
(at $27.60 it would yield 5%). I am trying to buy these utilities at PEs below
10 and sell them when they are above 12 just using a broad based measure of
value. The same is true for yields. I want to own them with yields of 5% or
higher and consider selling them when the yield drops below 4%.

This is the list I have compiled:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PPL,CNP,AEE,EXC,AYE,BKH,AGL,SE&d=s

I am excluding AEE based on my June 19, 2009 review
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25705905&srchtxt=aee

On July 24, 2009, the company applied for an 18% rate hike which will probably
nor get approved in full. So, AEE is off my list for the time being.

Many of these have rallied 20% or more from their earlier lows only 120 days
ago. PPL seems to be a laggard and has the potential for a double from current
prices.

I agree w/ your observation "... seems like a good place to park a few
bucks..." especially as my credit union only yields 1.6% and these utility
dividends are "qualified" which for now are taxed at a max of 15%.

E_K_S,

<(at $27.60 it would yield 5%).> I thought I was the only guy looking for
arbitrary entry points. lol!

Had first bought PPL back on 7/1 @ $34+. :( Guess next year was baked in at
that price.

I keep dividend stocks on one side, not planning on selling, and traders on the
other. My cut off spot is 3.5%. Why I dipped into MCD this morning.

Money market rate at my wifes credit union is 1.05%. 5 year CDs @ 3%.

Curious what you think of TE, in case we are one hurricane away from $11.

For 2010, we project operating EPS to increase
about 12% from anticipated results in 2009, reflecting
an improvement in the economy and
housing market, as well as a full year of the rate
increases implemented in May 2009, and an additional
rate increase expected in 2010.

While TE's dividend represents 92% of 2008
EPS, it represents only 73% and 66% of our respective
EPS estimates for 2009 and 2010. Our
12-month target price is $14, a slight discountto-
peers P/E of 11.5X our 2010 forecast.

Hi Steve -
Re: TE, PPL & SWX

TE is interesting. Analysts estimate their 2010 earnings at $1.22/share which
translates to a PE around 11 at current prices. The dividend yield is good at
5.9% which reflects a 96% payout ratio which is pretty high. Also, I did notice
some insider selling at $11.00. Don't expect any dividend increase soon.

I do like that they have interests in "mineral rights" and other mining
facilities. From Yahoo: "...TECO Energy owns mineral rights; and owns and
operates surface and underground mines, and coal processing and loading
facilities in eastern Kentucky, Tennessee, and southwestern Virginia. The
company was founded in 1899 and is headquartered in Tampa, Florida....". Their
mineral rights may be a hidden jewel which they could sell or spin off.

PPL is a bit more interesting because of their size, exposure to nuclear and is
diversified with interests in Europe. Their European interests had a positive
contribution to PPL's otherwise disappointing earnings.

I bought SWX three month's ago and it is already up 25% from my purchase price.
I am tempted to sell this and buy PPL and perhaps a starter position in TE.

Southwest Gas Corporation Reports Second Quarter 2009 Results
http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/3394922

SWX's yield is now around 3.8% and analysts estimate 2010 PE at 12, I may
continue to hold through Nov to see if these new rate increases are allowed.

From the article:"... Southwest Gas has two rate cases pending before the state
Public Utilities Commission. The first, a general rate case through which the
company would recoup operating and business costs, would boost residential
rates 6.9 percent, or $5.53 a month, in winter, and 6.7 percent, or $2 a month,
in summer. The second is a deferred-energy filing to account for purchased-fuel
expenses, which the company must pass directly to consumers without taking a
profit. It would cut the typical monthly bill by 1.3 percent a month, or 89
cents, in winter, and 1 percent, or 31 cents a month, in summer.

Company officials also said in July that they would file two more cases in
coming weeks...".

I will add TE to my watch list but it's already had a 23% run in the last
month, I will wait to see if I can buy some shares in the $11-12 price range.

Hi Paul

From an earlier post on CNP and smart meters
http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25658310&srchtxt=meter

It appears that Itron Inc. (ITRI) will supply the meters
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=ITRI and Google may help in providing the
software and networking tools.

Google Makes Utility & Smart METER Friends for Energy Tool PowerMeter
Wed May 20, 2009 2:12am EDT
http://www.reuters.com/article/earth2Tech/idUS420530634520090520

Itron is no bargain even if they were the big winner of such a contract as
these meters are more commodity type products and should sell with a small
gross margin (similar to cable boxes like the deal MOT has w/ Comcast). Their
on going network service fees could be the big winner if they can maintain
exclusive control over the networks they design and build for their utility
partners. Itron develops proprietary meter equipment & networks that work using
their Advaned Metering & Smart Grid design (
http://www.itron.com/pages/solutions_detail.asp?id=itr_016422.xml ). This
provides them some protection from competing "open networks" but I suspect this
is a barrier that Google wants to break . Itron is considered a leader in this
niche market and emerging technology. Check out the list of their "Smart Grid"
partners ( http://www.itron.com/pages/about_smart_grid_partners.asp ). Analysts
has them earning $3.22/share in 2010 which translate into a forward PE of 16.
Google's development of PowerMeter could disrupt several of the proprietary
designs Itron has developed, making Itron's future prospects cloudy at best.

I guess I might be more tempted to buy into Google. Analysts have them earning
$24.65 in 2010 (forward PE of 18). The Google product portfolio is much more
diversified than Itron. The growth for Itron is limited to a niche market while
Google's is boundless.

Too bad I missed the opportunity for Google at $275 in Dec 2008 and now at $450
it's a hard one to out right buy. Because of their Smart Meter involvement,
Google is one I am going to watch and on any sell off will try to force myself
to pick up a few shares.

BDR (one hit wonder?),

This was up 40% or so since I recommended it here, now it is down. I had been
unwinding it as it rose, but still had a decent-sized position.

With the recent bad earnings announcement, I sold my position down to a small
level. It was very, very disappointing in my view. Management had implied a
very good quarter, and it came out very negative. Given the earnings
announcement was in the middle of Q2, how could they be so clueless?

It ruins their credibility in my view, even though the stock is cheap on an
asset value basis and claims sales will rebound in Q3-Q4. What's strange, is
that I was totally wrong about how the company would do, yet I still made money
on the trade, since I had bought below 1.40.

This is where the phrase "better lucky than good" comes to mind. Also, an
instance where trading compensates for a bad stock pick. Not that I am happy
about the money I lost today.

ROIAK has an active share repurchase plan...

In March 2008, the Company's board of directors authorized a repurchase of
shares of the Company's Class A and Class D common stock through December 31,
2009 of up to $150.0 million, the maximum amount allowable under the Credit
Agreement. The amount and timing of such repurchases will be based on pricing,
general economic and market conditions, and the restrictions contained in the
agreements governing the Company's credit facilities and subordinated debt and
certain other factors. While $150.0 million is the maximum amount allowable
under the Credit Agreement, in 2005 under a prior board authorization, the
Company utilized approximately $78.0 million to repurchase common stock leaving
capacity of $72.0 million under the Credit Agreement. During the quarter ended
June 30, 2009, the Company repurchased 12,374 shares of Class A common stock
for $10,834 at an average price of $0.88, and approximately 6.4 million shares
of Class D common stock for approximately $3.0 million at an average price of
$0.47. During the six months ended June 30, 2009, the Company repurchased
34,889 shares of Class A common stock for $23,724 at an average price of $0.68,
and approximately 20.8 million shares of Class D common stock for approximately
$9.9 million at an average price of $0.47. As of June 30, 2009, the Company had

My general rule, from the past anyway, is that asset managers are undervalued
when they sell below 2% of assets under management. An adjustment should
perhaps be made (but I will not) for debt instruments (bond funds/money market
funds) which are less valuable than equity (stock) funds or private managed
accounts. With AMG aum total now of $178.7B and 42M shares out., I calculate
and claim that AMG is still undervalued until AMG is at 2% aum per share at
$84.8/sh. AMG closed today at $68.20.

Hi Grommit -

What's your exit strategy?

As the preferred series move towards $25.00/share (par value when originally
issued), the upside potential becomes very small. My original thought was to
hold onto my shares for a long time and collect the dividends. However, I am
thinking of peeling off some shares and moving the proceeds into dividend
paying companies that have a higher upside potential from current levels. The
qualified dividends are taxed (for now) at a much lower rate than the preferred
dividends.

I will let those shares purchased in the IRA remain but may peel of 1/3 of
those preferred series that trade over $20.00/share in my taxable account.

Exit Strategy? Not sure. I agree that the upside is now limited. OTOH, these

LXP D... 11.8%
CLP D... 10.7%
HRP C... 9.7%
DRE N... 9.3%
FR K... 14.4%
AHT A... 16.7%

Good point on the qualified dividends, but my intent is to hold them longer,
and maybe forever. There is more upside with common, but obviously, more
security with the preferred.

My accounts are up >70% YTD. I am sure that I should be selling something, but
all I have are dividend stocks. I should learn not to be greedy for cap gains,
just accept the dividends and not worry about it. I think that I am pretty much
in that frame of mind now.

I wasn’t seriously suggesting that anyone buy into this British company, as the
shares don’t even trade here in the US. There are enough companies here to keep
me busy trying to keep up with them without having to deal with ADR’s and tax
issues.

However, other than my core holdings in income producing stock (PTY, BKT) and a
few energy stocks (XOM), I’m fairly well invested in the life science area.
Here are some of my holdings with the rational:
1)HRC- Growing demographics of aging population indicates we will need more and
more hospitals and their ability to monitor patients and medical records of
their patients. Currently, the investment environment for HRCs products by
hospitals and out-patient clinics are under pressure, however, you buy stocks
when things are bad, hoping to get a rebound when expansion for their products
come back in vogue. HRC is very profitable and throws off a nice dividend as
you wait. Stock as of late has shown a nice bounce.
2) MITI – my largest biotech holding with news expected next month on data for
solid tumors. Go back and read their PR of June 8 and you will see amazing
results for another of their drug candidates…….80% effectiveness is a stellar
performance for any drug candidate. Also, note they just raised $75 million
with a secondary offering (Concluded this week.). Such dilution normally drives
share price down below offering, however, for MITI the stock traded up by 20%
over the secondary pricing.
3) CMN---if World Health Organization is right, the swine flu is going to come
back stronger this fall. Currently in the southern hemisphere it is spreading
like wild fire and schools will be starting here in the US within the next few
weeks. Hospitals, medical clinics, schools and large gathering places for big
crowds will need an abundant supply of disinfectants to combat the danger of
infections spreading. Plus, with the recent purchase of a west coast based
water purification company, CMN now has coast to coast water purification
operations with an emphasis on dialysis facilities……again that aging population
and growing renal failures needing dialysis. Nice profitable company…….in
growing market.
4) QDEL—as mentioned here yesterday, analyst report that drove the stock down
was based on false assumptions and data that was reported. Even if test
products don’t pick up all flu cases, doctors will continue to test patients
for the flu and since QDEL has as reported by the CDC, the best of show in this
category, one could expect that QDEL is working overtime to have product ready
for shipment BEFORE the flu season gets here. Stock bounce nicely
today……already giving me a nice profit, but I plan to hold.
5) RSDV –the real company that I would like to invest in this product line is—

http://alimerasciences.com/News/2009PressReleases/tabid/106/Default.aspx

The problem is that Alimera is a private company, but deep pocketed investors
behind them. You might check that aspect of their corporate information. So
without being able to invest directly into their company, I’ve taken the only
option to invest in RSDV, who is working with Alimera. Their current drug trial
is fully enrolled and data expected in October. To this point, all data and
safety issues have passed with flying colors. The market for this drug is more
than 1 million patients here in the US…..worldwide it will be huge.
6) SMBL –savvy management team behind this operation…….they know what they are
doing. Only a matter of time before major food company will buy them out. Plus,
I love their products and with Q report out this week…..seems many people like
them, also.
7) MNTA ---If Congress acts on finally approving biologics, MNTA will be at the
head of the class. Only a small position in this stock…….but it could be at the
head of the class, one day! This will give you some background on the company

that is not a bad idea. so who do you like in that area? SD had a sharp move
upward on friday, which hopefully is the beginning of a long uptrend in the

and went to the sidelines after watching their 401ks drop, none have reentered
this market yet. another acquaintance who has a financial advisor was told to
wait a couple of more months before reentering. he is 100% in money market. i
receive emails from one service that tells me that a sharp crash is imminent.
Meanwhile LINTA LVS PKX ZION CHK SD GFRE AYR are looking stellar.

Another Hotel REIT Update as most released earnings this week:

SPPR - To me, actually had the best report of them all, achieving net income
for the quarter. Revpar is down much less than the industry. They are selling
hotels here and there to add liquidity, seemingly without too much issue since
the hotels are individually pretty cheap. I look at this as probably my safest
Hotel REIT Play.

FCH - I had bought a large position with an average price of about $2.25 and
recently sold about 1/4 of that position at $2.80. I still like this company a
lot because most of their hotels were purchased several years ago, giving them
equity cushion as hotel prices fall from their hotels. Still producing FFO in
this tough climate.

BEE - I sold a few shares of TGB (Copper Miner) and FCH to buy some BEE shares.
This is the company with the luxury hotels around the world. I like this
company, but I find this to be more of a speculation that it's not going to go
into bankruptcy as the economy turns around (as it's shares seem to be priced
for a strong bankruptcy risk). Negative FFO this quarter, which is not good,
but I think there are several factors that will turn this company around. No
material debt repayments until 2011 is a big plus.

AHT - I'm not in AHT anymore. Still monitoring it, but I don't like that the
company is writing off it's mezzanine loans to other hotels. In addition, many
of its hotels were purchased in the last few years, making me question the
equity left in these hotels. But, I'm still monitoring this one.

I think overall, a lot of these Hotel Reits are still being priced for a decent
bankruptcy risk, but I feel with the economy seemingly turning around a bit,
this risk should decrease. In addition, these Reits in general tie their
mortgage debt to the hotel only, and when in trouble can deleverage by giving
the hotel to the lender. Yes, this is not the ideal situation, but how many
Hotels does BEE need to justify a market cap under $100 Million? Same with FCH
under $200 Million.

I think it's going to take some strategy, but between the economy turning
around, the credit markets healed a bit, and the ability for these REITS to
jettison Hotels one at a time, that these Reits will hopefully survive and
therefore provide solid returns.

We'll see if I'm right. :)

Spek,
Concerning SPPR, I guess you and me have different ways looking at a company.
(:>) I respectfully disagree on this company, because IMO they are a disaster
in the making. First item is their contention that their ADR was below the
industry average, when in reality they operate low revenue generating motels
and for them to even give up 3.5% on daily rentals rates is going to impact
them because of fixed expenses. Also, they fully admit they have a huge debt
payment coming up next month(Wells Fargo) and it appears they are being forced
into selling properties to meet this obligation. If they can't unload the
motels that they already have on the market....where are they going to get the
money to pay off Wells Fargo.

The summer travel season is over.......who would want to buy a motel
now...unless they can get a huge discount???? My point is simple.......SPPR is
selling off motels to meet debt obligations....that ain't a good sign. (IMO)

TexasDude,

I agree with you that the 9/30 debt payment is a risk, but it's only $9.5M. The
company thinks they have options and because of the size of the loan, I believe
them. I'd rather have $9.5M to deal with than other hotel companies' $200M.
But, I appreciate you bringing up this risk. It is something to consider.

In regards to ADR decline below the industry, they were profitable on a net
income basis this quarter which is rare these days for any hotel company and
shows that they're dealing with their fixed expenses better than other
companies are.

Thanks,

Often, you have to look beyond just the numbers a company put on their Q
reports. Look at what they are telling you as to what is going on with their
business model. This is a REIT, and the fact they have paid no dividend now for
two Q speakers louder than merely saying they are profitable on a net income
basis. Take out the money from the sale of those properties those numbers
‘might’ be a little different for the first two Qs.

This from their Q report:(They also mention they might have to sale more
securities…aka…….stock!)

The Company does not believe it is likely that these adverse economic
conditions, and their effect on the hospitality industry, will improve
significantly in the near term.

The Company's other outstanding near-term debt includes a $9.5 million note
payable to Wells Fargo Bank in September 2009. The Company currently expects to
either refinance the loan or retire the debt with funds from operations or sale
of properties. If the Company's future financial performance fails to meet
these financial covenants, or the Company is unable to repay or refinance its
debt as it becomes due then its lenders have the ability to take control of its
encumbered hotel assets. If this were to happen, the Company's ability to
conduct business could be severely impacted as there can be no assurance that
the adequacy and timeliness of cash flow would be available to the meet the
Company's liquidity requirements.

All just my opinion, and if you want to know if I’ve ever be wrong……..ask my
wife! (:>)

Distressed $1-2M hotels/motels should provide a good opportunity for the Patel
clan and other Indian immigrants.*
(Supertel with enterprise value of $230M owns 120 hotels in 24 states.) For a
recent immigrant or someone already in the business, a hotel/motel purchase is
a good way to buy yourself/family members a job, put family members to work,
and get authorization from Feds to bring over more relatives (since the family
sponsor can guarantee to the gov't that the arrivals have a job).

There will be a market demand for these hotels from this category of buyer.
Although...I wouldn't want to be in a tough situation and have to negotiate a

substantial jobs, so it looks like things are starting to move but at lower
price levels than the bubble prices we have seen. On the other hand the mills
here are closed summer jobs for students are hard to come by and 20-30%

For sure the bargains - the prices anyway - aren't available now that they
generally were a few months ago. For me, that makes it difficult to step in for
bigger commitments.

"OT ive spents a couple of hours this am reading negative posts about how this
market is completely irrational and how its been manipulated by the powers that

From your link, it seems the irrationality is caused by the disconnect between
the economy -- lots of indicators of continuing downtrend -- vs. the stock
market -- which is moving up or has moved up very strongly. It seems to me that
the people who say irrational are the people who can't figure out why this is,
so they have to concluded the market move must be irrational.

I wonder if the people who are saying now that the market is not undervalued or
not worth investing in, were of the same opinion in March and they did not buy
stocks then either when the market was so much lower. If not in March lows,
then at what point would such naysayers invest?

Anyway, I have to have a similar opinion with people who NOW are saying that
it's difficult to find or recognize undervalued stocks. This must be so for me
because I am holding more cash now than I ever have. Large relative amounts in
almost all my portfolios. Not so much because I am scared (which I am), but
because I just cannot find stocks that I want to buy. And if I do buy something
or just with what I already hold, I am not willing to make big $$ commitments.

Have been selling down strongly my oil/gas stocks. OXY - first sales in nine

Although I'm having trouble finding undervalued stocks in which to invest, that
doesn't mean I'm not buying. There are gaarp stocks and some speculative stocks
in which I'm willing to make small purchases.

The Fair Value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
I have no idea how high the stock market can go over the next year. I have the
theory that stocks trade at fair value about once every three years. Having
just come through one of the most destructive bear markets since the Great
Depression, it is unlikely that the market will suddenly become efficient and
sit on top of its statistical fair value in the coming year.

Link to chart: http://risingdividendinvesting.blogspot.com/

Having said that, our Dow Jones Fair Value Model is signaling that stocks have
a long way to go just to reach their statistical fair value. The chart at the
right shows the Dow Jones 30's actual price (red line) versus our Fair Value
Model (blue bars) over the last 50 years.

A quick glance at the chart shows that the fit between the actual prices of the
Dow and the Fair Value model has been reasonably good. The model, indeed, shows
that stock prices were way too high relative to values in the late 1990s.

Currently, the model is saying that stocks are modestly undervalued, as shown
by the price line being buried in the value bar at the far right. The top of
the value bar, or the statistical Fair Value of the Dow Jones 30 is at 10,900.

If stocks were to reach our model's Fair Value over the next twelve months it
would produce a return of over 18%. Thinking of gains when we just went through
a 55% fall in prices is a difficult notion to grab on to. However, we believe
the path of least resistance for stocks is now higher, and we believe our
model's calculation of where stocks might be in a year is as good a guess as we
can make.

The model is a multiple regression of trailing twelve-month Dow Jones 30
earnings, dividends, interest rates, and prices. It has an R2 in excess of .90
over the last 50 years.

The SPY earning estimates for Y2009 are about 50$. At a current value of 1000
points that is a 20x PE. this is not cheap Y2010 estimates are anyones guess -
the highest I have seen is 75$ which implies a strong turn of the economy. I
think a value of 60$/SPY500 is more realistic. Based on that we have 16.7PE -
not cheap either but also not terrible expensive. Given the uncertainties with
respect to the economy and the loss of investors confidence (which could lead
to rapid selloffs, imo) I consider the market as a whole somewhat overvalued.

The more important than the overall market valuation is if I find value stocks
based on absolute not relative criteria. A few weeks ago i was buying into
utilities, as they were trading at <10x earnings 6% dividend yield and in many
cases close to book. they were good values then but now they moved up 20%+ and
valuation is Ok but not great. A sector that right now is under some sort of
stigma is health care (health care reform, reimbursement) but assuming the
world does not come to an end, stocks like SKH, SUNH, BDX, ABT looks like very
good values, relative to how they used to trade (historical PE's), and in
absolute terms (PE<10etc ). True there are risks but in the end I believe there
is a discounted value that compensates. In many other sectors (industrials to
name one) I feel the valuation can only be justified by a very sharp economic
rebound which is not something I want to rely on.

My cash percentage of my portfolio remains stubbornly high because stocks I
have bought gradually reach my exit prices (most recently BRK.B, UL, RF) so i
am letting them go. I would make better returns not doing so now but then again
being consistent and using the volatility in the market to my advantage has
allowed me to avoid the high portfolio drawdown that I would have had to endure
as buy and hold investor, so i am not complaining at all.

I concede that point about Sodexo, however, the fact that they are strictly in
this aspect of the food business is why I suggested one invest in SYY.

Think of it as the literal case of following the 'food chain' when you compare
Sodexo to (SYY). One of the main sources of rev for Sodexo are the sport
venues. Take a look at the attendance numbers of the professional baseball
games...(As I write this, I'm watching the Houston Astros vs Florida
Marlins........and you catch shoot a cannon off and not hit a soul in the
seats) Look at the various offers being made by sport venues..........here in
Houston they literally are giving away tickets and free food just to get people
in the staduim) Look at the data just release by the Cleveland Indians as to
their loss of revenue.......they are literally going broke. Look at the
Pittsburg Pirates....they have traded all their key players trying to cut their
expenses...fans just aren't showing up to eat food at sport arenas. Go back and
study the history of a Canadian company that held the contract at many of the
major sports arenas.....a company that 'went' by the name.....Center Plate,
that had their US operations based in South Carolina.

I should have been clearer in my original post.......IMO if one is going to
invest their money in the food industry......doesn't logic tell you that in the
chain of delivery to the end customer that the supplier is going to benefit
before the seller to the eater of the food? The time to invest in Sodexo, is
when you see the increasing number of trucks being loaded at the SYY
distribution centers.

I hope this clarifies my position on my original post. (:>) I just concluded a
4,500 mile vacation drive in which I attended facilities that utilizes Sodexo
services.......and let me tell you.....the waiting lines were not long!

The problem for MLB is that if they loose one generation of fans, the league
may be done for good, even if they reduce prices.I see it as a uniquely
american middle (and below) class institution. If it looses relevance for this
core fan group, it may be done forever since neither see any emigrants nor
foreign countries developing any interest.

latinos and asian both are interested in the game but they are not gonna pay
the ridiculous prices mlb is asking to see games they can watch on tv for free.
i agree with you about it being history. todays season ticket holders are the
grown up kids of parents who would take their kids to several ball games a
year. when the same players played for the same team and werent hopping around
charging for autographs. Personally i havent watched any games this season I
usually wait till the playoffs and then start watching.

Hi Paul - Followed you on your sells of OXY. Closed out my position. Been
selling this one down over the years and put the proceeds into Siemens AG (SI).

I own several other integrated oils with my largest in CVX. I continue to hold
CVX as they pay a higher dividend and have a lower PE than OXY. Any rally in
oil, I plan to peel off some shares of the CVX.

I like Semens (SI)with their low PE at 9, diversified business units and
exposure to infrastructure business in China.

http://www.wikinvest.com/wiki/Si

From the Wikiinvest Web Site:"...Business lines of Siemens include Information
and Communications, Automation and Control, Power, Transportation, Medical, and
Lighting. Siemens is active in many business areas, and benefits from
globalization and booming economies in Asia, particularly China, and eastern
Europe, where Siemens provides infrastructures in communication, IT,
transportation, and power, including wind turbines. Siemens is also
experiencing an improvement in its productivity, reflected by its decision to
separate its under-performing telecoms handset business into a joint venture
with Nokia. Along with General Electric Company (GE), Siemens dominates the
world market in production of the large turbines, which utilities use to power
cities and large factories. Emerging Markets such as China, Russia, and India
are experiencing strong growth in power consumption and the lack of competition
for product sales in these markets will help to ensure growing sales for years
to come...."

This is BOTH an infrastructure play in China and an Obama stimulus play for
2010-2011. The stock has had a pretty good run but no more than many of the
rest of the market. Company pays a small dividend which yields 1.8%.

This portfolio move allows me to have a bit larger exposure to infrastructure
and stimulus growth contained in my recent buys.

Continuing to unload OXY also. Easier now that I've been doing it, but still
sad. Ha. It's about falling in love with your stocks and why that's good and
bad.

I started trading OXY (a few shares, not often) in the mid 1990's because it
looked to me like the stock just cycled. Can not see this from Yahoo graph, but
it seemed so to me at the time.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=OXY&t=my

Somewhere about 2002, I noticed the stock was above levels it hadn't been at
for maybe 10 or more years. So I stopped selling and began accumulating. OXY's
just been one of those stocks that I kept through all turmoil and negativity,
e.g. the company is run too much for the ceo and management, the ceo is waaay
overpaid, etc.

When the view is to buy and hold, and the stock has performed over the years,
has raised its dividend, has prospects that look okay (Some pundits believe OXY
is THE proxy for an oil stock, replacing the former XOM.), and has moved up so
much (@$70, I've got roughly a ten bagger on most OXY shares)... the on-going
decision seems almost a fixation to just soldier on by continuing to hold.

Except that the trend in oil short term is difficult to predict. If oil falls
again, it will take down OXY again, and so many more oil stocks that I still
hold. That's important to me, because not having sold any OXY shares, OXY had
become one of the top five holdings in my largest portfolio.

So maybe too late, or maybe wrongly, I am gradually cutting back OXY now until
it becomes inconsequential to my portfolio's daily performance. Same with my
relatively large position in CVX. (Like you, I intend to trim this one if it
rallies.)

What I am doing is going through all my oil, nat gas, and oil service
companies, and any stock with a forward p/e (as reported by Yahoo) above 10 and
trading above stated book value, I am considering for reduction. Also, if I see
I've held the stock for roughly three years, and it's now trading below my
cost, I am looking to sell.

I suppose I can buy these stocks back at any time; I tell myself that. In
practice though, buying back at lower prices has been hard for me. I either
move on and forget, or find alternative bets to be more attractive, or get
scared that my original decision to sell was correct, so I don't want to buy
back.

Anyway, fwiw, today I sold shares in these:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NXY,DO,CNQ,SU,TS,and,OXY.&d=s

The cash component of my portfolios continues to be larger than in past years.

Somewhat late, maybe too late, I'm making an add to my shares of bond ETF, HYG
today. I also bought a few more shares of auto loan company, NICK, mentioned
here before. ABT keeps falling again now; I keep adding (sigh). Small though.
Have open orders trying to get fills in a few other stocks.

im still way out on margin in my cash portfolio. but watching very carefully.
market looks to be up this am based on premarket activity. remembering one of
your previous posts sounds like you have a 10 bagger in a significant position,
very nice. i covered my deutche bank short a couple of days ago at a loss. im
out of sny, and maybe out of posco next week if the stock doesnt turn upward.

I was looking at my cost basis for OXY and see that there was a 2 for 1 stock
split in 2006. I have owned this company since the early 80's so it really was
a long term position for me. My basis is around $12.75 per share.

Many of my core positions are based on long term holds where I have not trimmed
as much as I should have. A lot of my CVX shares were purchased by buying
Texaco which at the time I bought because it was a screaming value buy.

I could go on regarding most of my top ten holdings, where almost half are
legacy long term buys. I have peeled off some shares but I consider them still
very good holds. I need to be a bit more proactive in taking more of these
gains to rebalance the portfolio.

Overall I am still overweight in Oil and Natural Resource companies. I probably
need to continue to move more dollars into these utility companies since they
continue to be priced at the lower end of their historical valuation.

I just have to be careful of stepping on any land mines and continue to move
slowly with a few more sales and stepping up my value buys. Holding more cash
may not be too bad either.

"I could go on regarding most of my top ten holdings, where almost half are

Yes, ltb&h. I'm with you there. My impression is that for me, that's where most
of my money has been made. Not sure exactly what timeframe I mean by ltb&h, but
it's certainly closer to ten years than to five or two or the USA gov't's 12
mo+1 day.

From posts on SI, elsewhere, LTB&H very underrated, if not disparaged. To be
expected, but disappointing to me to see it. So many people with less than ten
years even in the market, let alone holding on to a stock for that long.

It seems like ltb&h stocks only get discussed as ltb&h stocks when there's some
unusual news or when people start to make sales of shares.

-g- Of course this is the value thread, where the idea is to buy undervalued
and to sell when stock appreciates to fair/fully valued. So sales could often
be - and maybe are expected to be - within a short timespan, e.g. within a
couple of years or even much less.

======
It's conceptually easy to see that ltb&h has worked in the past for some
people. Maybe most or many of the few people who've been such investors. It's
hard for many people to believe that it will work now for them: to buy
something with the actual intent to hold for years, and then actually stick
with the holding. It's easier to see, do, and understand when you have one or
two of these stocks in your portfolio for the long time it requires for the
company to grow its business and the stock to become a multibagger. Then it's
easier to become a convert.

paul you are a very experienced investor who has been at this a long time. you
are also willing to stay the course and buy stocks as they are plunging and
keep making buys. that is the opposite of the average investor who after their
portfolio has gone down 20-30% cant take the pain anymore and sell. somewhere i
saw and reposted the actual returns investors make from some well known mutual
fund and the disparity from the results posted by the funds are pretty
shocking. My non ira portfolio which had been down over 50% from inception
around june of 08, is having another banner day and is for the moment up
6% overall. However it make take years for my ira portfolio to recover to
previous highs as i have made very few trades in that segment of the portfolio
and it continues to heavily overweight junior mining and oils, and also contain
the mogif and washington mutual preferred losses, as well as the apex silver
bankruptcy.

JST reports tomorrow. I guess with the volatile nature of the stock, its either
a tank job or a big upper. My guess is the upper but of course that could be
very earnings report dependent

Agree on JST, anializer. I am holding on...and hoping for decent news.

(This one another example of a ltb&h multibagger. (Short-term multibagger too,
if one could've been adept, alert, aware, interested in buying at March lows)
That's of this instant anyway, because as you say, with its volatility it could
be sunk if earnings report disappoints.)

Yeah experienced -g-. Not feeling so successful though. If I have enough time,
I might eventually see my portfolios reach last year's highs. I have the
distinct impression though that I may never be paying fed or state capital
gains taxes again. My capital loss carryovers are that large.

Margin. Madharry, this is the best time I've ever seen to be on margin.
Wonderful opportunity for conservative players because brokerage rates are
extremely low and stock dividend yields, bond yields, bond etf's, mlp
distributions, etc., are so much relatively higher.

Of course, you have to be a "good" customer to get the better margin rates, and
as you point out, the market requires that the margin player be attentive,
cautious and prudent.

Paul,

I like NICK also. I bought Nick a year or two ago at 10 and only thought of
adding (not selling) when it was low, but found other opportunities. Definitely
seemed to weather the financial storm without much financial difficulty.

My other main value plays in my eyes are the hotel reits FCH, BEE, and SPPR. In
addition, I own junior miner TGB, which I like a lot and have increased/reduced
positions on throughout the last couple of years.

In addition, I own decent positions in AIXG and CREE, which are less of value
plays, but more of 'Green' plays on the LED lighting revolution. I've held CREE
for years, and I may hold AIXG that long.

I agree with others that there aren't incredible values out there right now,
but I think there are still some values. I just feel like we've returned to
somewhat of a regular market where you have to pick your stocks instead of just
throwing darts and getting gains like when we were at Dow 6500.

I'm not looking to hold on to these Hotel Reits forever. I'd sell all of them
if they doubled (or maybe even before), and probably put the money into larger
company value plays. I tend to rotate into larger company values when markets
are higher and into smaller, more speculative, stocks when markets are down.
That strategy seems to work for me, and I'm finally starting to rotate into
larger plays now.

FCH still meets my criteria for a value stock selling at a huge discount to
tangible book with earnings estimates positive. The loss this last Q wasn't all
that encouraging but I'm sure you are happy to have held a decent % of your
position. BEE also a value but negative estimates going forward give me pause.
I like your SPRR and will consider some.

While not all hotel, OLP selling still at a very decent discount with good
estimates
