I own ARDI. Although the company is known for its GPS vehicle tracking, it is
really transforming itself into a software company that provides end-to-end
services to the mobile representatives of companies. Although software
companies are out of my area of interest, I was initially attracted to the
company's niche and pristine balance sheet. I suspect the PPS has been stagnant
because the company gave ho-hum guidance for the first quarter. However, in my
opinion, the expected merger with Vidus will create major opportunities for the
company. (Although that pristine balance sheet will take a hit.)Anyone who is
interested in the company should listen to the latest CC before it disappears
from the company website.

CRYP. Madharry (and others who might be interested), you might want to check
latest Barron's for cover story on online poker. CRYP, apparently one of the
few US publicly-traded firms in the sector - and one that can report earnings -
is mentioned favorably. Of CRYP, Barron's says, " Given CryptoLogic's strong
growth... and solid balance sheet with over $6 a share in net cash, the company
seems like a reasonable bet on the online-gaming boom."

My opinion: "boom" might be a key word. At 27 x last year's earnings (per
Barron's), and with no 10-year public history, I'd say the stock cannot be a
Graham value. OTOH, IF the company can maintain it's juicy profit margins -
i.e. IF the boom doesn't become bust and/or if new entrants to CRYP's business
don't crimp CRYP's profits (margins), then imo, CRYP would be a value still and
a buy at current p/e.
The 'ifs' scare me though; I'll not add shares, but I will stay a holder for
now.

re MSFT kevin and Eric,
I appreciate your opinion about MSFT. I am well aware that the high growth for
MSFT is over. What i like about MSFT is that they managed the transistion from
a growth to a mature company very well. Their cash flow is terrific, as is
their balance sheet, stock options are reduced and accounted for, they pay a
dividend and venture in new markets (web, video games) where they appear to
gain traction over the long term. They have shown growth over the last 5 years
in the single digits annually yet the stock hasn't appreciated which attracts
me as a value investor. It may be that the elite goes to work at Google but I
am just happy with owning a piece of a well run and transparent company.

Paul,

AVCI is definitely interesting. One value manager (and I forget who it was)
said that they like to buy baskets of stocks, especially technology stocks,
having an EV/Revenue of less than .5. Furthermore, they make sure each has
little to no debt on their balance sheet and plenty of cash.

Trailing revenues are approximately 26.6mm. With $55.5 mm in cash and another
13.5 mm in LT investments (which is bonds and commercial paper), AVCI has cash
& equivalents of nearly 69.0 mm. With 12.8 m shares outstanding and, probably,
another 3m options, AVCI has a diluted market cap of 87.1m. Excluding cash and
adding back their operating leases and other commitments totaling about $5m,
one finds out that their Enterprise Value is about $36.6m. EV/Revenue is about
1.38.

The key cause, most likely, to AVCI's recent decline is SBC's pending
acquisition of AT&T which I bet you know that AT&T is AVCI's largest customer.
Of course, AVCI also has sales partnerships with Huawei and Nortel.

The core router market is dominated by the likes of Cisco and Juniper. The real
question is: will potential customers use AVCI to ensure there will not be a
duopoly in this specific market segment.

The acquisition of AT&T creates uncertainty as to the future viability of AVCI.
And, of course, uncertainty, at times, creates opportunity.

This discussion of MSFT has prompted me to re-visit another large cap tech I
owned at one time - CSCO.

To me, CSCO seems like a better bet at this time. Trades at a smaller multiple,
one that is at the low end of its historical realm. The forecasts for growth
for CSCO are substantially higher than MSFT. MSFT growth forecasts are just
slightly higher than the flat line.

One advantage for MSFT, a small one IMHO, is that it pays a dividend.

Another company that has been hit by the SBC/T deal is LUK - Leucadia National.
LUK is a Buffett like company with schrewd management and secretive ways. They
purchased WilTel, the bankrupt Williams communications and were the fibre
backbone for SBC. Now SBC will use T's system. LUK has falled from 47 to 33 and
it may not be over, or it may be one heck of a bargain. larry:
Why Leucadia's a Laggard

By LESLIE P. NORTON
February 20, 2005

Few executives have won as many kudos as Chairman Ian Cumming and President
Joseph Steinberg of Leucadia National. But halting the stock's current slide
may prove a big challenge.

The executives have racked up a handsome annual return for shareholders over 15
years and are often compared with Warren Buffett. Their formula for success:
Buy cheap assets, often with tax advantages, and nurse them back to health.

So in late 2003, they acquired WilTel, the former bankrupt Williams
Communications, and its nationwide fiber-optic network for $780 million. And in
classic Leucadia fashion, they snapped up $3.4 billion in net operating losses
that could be used to offset taxes on future earnings.
[Leucadia National]

But that purchase could now prove ill-fated. Leucadia shares are trading at
about $34, down from a 52-week high of $47 in December. That's because SBC
Communications, which uses WilTel's fiber-optic network and accounts for 70% of
its revenue, announced plans to buy AT&T Corp. and use AT&T's network instead.

"It's hard to see this as anything but a big negative," says Scott Cleland,
chief executive of Precursor Group, a telecom consulting firm in Washington,
D.C.

SBC may have to pay WilTel as much as $200 million in compensation for backing
out of their contract. Still, there are few obvious big customers to replace
SBC -- and its revenue stream.

Albert Meyer, an analyst at 2nd Opinion Research in Plano, Texas, who wrote the
report that first called attention to Tyco's corporate governance and
accounting problems, sees WilTel with revenues of some $400 million a year
after SBC's departure. In the first half of 2004, WilTel had $717 million in
revenue.

So could Leucadia sell WilTel outright? It isn't likely to be attractive
without an anchor customer like SBC. And the tax benefits can't be used without
profits -- which could be complicated by dropping revenues.

That means Leucadia shares could keep falling.

Mr. Meyer recently published a report suggesting that excluding WilTel,
Leucadia was worth around $17 a share, adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock split.

The stock's future depends on the shrewdness of Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg,
who adroitly sold 1.2 million shares after splitting the stock and boosting its
dividend late last year -- as it happens, just weeks before the SBC
announcement.

Says Robert Willens of Lehman Brothers: "I believe Leucadia is in the position
of having to acquire something."

I'm one who continues to add to positions in oil stocks.

Among the stocks I've bought in the past week are PBR and REP.

These stocks were mentioned Fri. night in BusinessWeek's Barker Portfolio

discerning value among oil stocks. Nor do I have such expertise either, for
that matter.)

http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_09/b3922150_mz026.htm

Also in the most recent Forbes, there's a write up about Wendell Perkins'
(Johnson Family International Value) foreign stock picks. According to Forbes,
Mr. Perkins still sees value in PBR (and CX, a stock several of us here own or
have owned). Of PBR, Forbes says, "...the inherent risk in the Brazilian market
is one reason that its shares sell for just 6 times estimated 2005 earnings,
compared with ExxonMobil at 15." Also, quoting Mr. Perkins, "At some point
we'll make the decision (for Latin America), much like we have in our Chinese
holdings, that we've seen the bulk of the return and it's time to go
elsewhere."

Paul - i have done very well with PENNY OIL...

i purchased BSIC at .03 about 5 years ago and sold the last of it last year
around 40 cents. obviously i should have held longer --- since it has added
about a buck since then.

i bought PYOL around 11 cents at the same time and dumped it for a penny or
three in profit because it looked like they just didnt have their act together.
well they obviously got it together because recently the stock went over 5
bucks and is now 4.25 X 4.30.

another one i started buying at .18 was SPND which i added to as high as .55
and it also has gone over 5 bucks. im still holding SPND because their future
looks bright. i like the idea that they bought a 46,000 sq. ft. commercial bldg
and intend to have an 8,000 sq ft office. i cant imagine having an office that
big and not planning on doing some serious business.

the penny oil i made the most on though was BGOV - Big Giant Oil which was
around 3 cents when i started watching it and 22 cents when i finally bought
it. it was a go-no-where penny oil company so they abandoned the oil business
did a reverse merger with another company ( Broadband Wireless ) and changed
their ticker to BBAN and shot up over 13 dollars within a few months. i made 6
figures off that stock with a measly 10k shares --- oops NO make that 20k
shares...lol

i probably would not have made so much but after the stock had peaked over 13
bucks and was on its way down i discoved 10,000 shares [ in two different
accounts ] that i FORGOT I EVEN PURCHASED!! [ i thought i only had 10k
shares...lol] that was when the stock was about $8.65 -- so i didnt waste
anytime -- I IMMEDIATLEY SOLD THEM ...lol.

i cant help but to love penny oils... these and others have been very good to
me.

recently i have been picking up a few shares of MOAT in the 3 to 4 cent range.
they dont really have anything going for them BUT -- i cant pass it up at these
prices. they could - like PYOL did - eventually get their act together OR EVEN
BETTER - THEY ARE A NICE CLEAN PUBLIC COMPANY - THEY COULD DECIDE TO SELL
ASSETS AND CHANGE THE BUSINESS PLAN INTO THE LATEST FAD COMPANY -- SAY,

Hi Paul - Many of these oil stocks have had double digit returns over the past
24-36 months. It reminds me of how the home building stocks have moved (and
still move higher) so my play has been to look at new investments that service
the oil group. Specifically, I have put more money into the tanker stocks but
am looking for other products or services that sell to this sector. Perhaps,
they will benefit more (on the margin) from a continued run up in the oil
sector.

Any ideas?

I have hedged a small portion of my XOM and MRO with long term Jan'06 options
so I can keep the dividend stream and protect my large capital gains.

===========================================================

I continue to like the banking sector and do feel that there continues to be
special value plays in the regional banks. Both C and JPM may be safer as they
are larger and diversified. Any suggestion on the best allocation of funds to
regional Vs large bank organizations. Currently, I have 80% targeted in the
regional sector and about 20% in the larger conglomerate banks.

=============================================================
Two other stocks that look interesting to me are MMM and GP. GP is more of a
value situation at current levels. I wonder if you or anybody else have
analyzed this company for (1) hidden capital assets and (2) earnings growth
potential given the boom in the housing market.

MMM continues to rocket higher and they have increased their dividend again.
This company is no real value based on their current and forward PE, but they
do have a very profitable drug division that could be spun off at much higher
levels. The company has stated that 2005-2006 will produce double digit growth
and they continue to innovate new products.

How should the value investor quantify some of these very profitable divisions
that as separate companies would demand much higher PE's? They also generate a
lot of patents which currently do not generate a steady income stream but have
potential value (to the right company) which IMO is not factored into the
current price.

Maybe I will have to hold my nose and like you "take a very small position" and
ease into the stock slowly.

Re: oil and oil service stocks

I own tanker stock, specifically TRMD which is an ADR for a very nicely run
Danish company TORM. (The Copenhagen exchange is the other one carrying the
company's stock.) Like many other tanker stocks recently, TRMD has had a
spectacular run in the last two years. (The Yahoo data is wrong: the plunge to
half-price is actually a 2:1 split that Yahoo hasn't registered correctly.)
However, I still think the company is a good deal as they continue to grow
their fleet. Not all their biz is oil tankers, which I like: dry good shipping
also, and pooling services.

For oil, I know almost nothing, so thanks to all the people posting stuff in
that area here. I have been combining speculative high-dividend royalty trusts
like Petrofund Energy Trust (PTF) with various more complex options hedges. But
this is more of an experiment in leverage, and requires too much attention so
I'm looking for more solid ground. The Brazil PBR play sounds reasonable. A
lesser-known possibility may be Indonesia - which I feel more comfortable with
since I've lived there - or Malaysia - if I find anything worthwhile looking
I'll post.

prospects seemed okay enough. Right now, I'm looking at AmSouth (ASO; I like
the dividend being raised every year w/current yield now about 4%) and Dale
Baker's pick of Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial (MTF). Neither appears as a great
bargain to me though; I'll likely pass. May just continue to build tiny JPM

commentary in BusinessWeek recently:

I'll pass on MMM. I'm not capable of quantiying value of MMM divisions; I'd
only be interested in the stock when the company looked cheap based on
historical p/e, p/sales, etc. I suspect if that day comes, with MMM being a
large weighting in the DOW (is that not correct?), the entire market (DOW
certainly (??) would be off quite a bit, and there'd be bargains aplenty in the
market.

I don't follow GP. As regards paper (one aspect of GP's business), I have IP on
my watch list - sorry I didn't take an exploratory position when stock was a
bit lower recently. As regards GP as a materials supplier to homebuilding
industry, I have other stocks there that I'm following.

Nice scary headline for HELE this a.m.: "Helen of Troy lowers expectations,
shares plunge"

Perhaps an inflection point day for HELE holders?: Either time to buy more or
to get out.

I'm adding a little to my position.

Company seems confident enough:
"Helen of Troy said sales in the later part of February have started to return
to prior expected levels and it does not believe the fourth-quarter sales
reductions should have a long-term impact on overall sales.

The company, which is licensed to sell products under names such as Vidal
Sassoon and Revlon, said it has not lost any customers or channels of
distribution.

Helen of Troy did not change its sales and earnings guidance for fiscal year
2006, which was given on Jan. 6. For fiscal 2006, which starts in March, it
forecast earnings of $2.90 to $3 per share on sales of $645 million to $660
million."

OTOH, more than one this thread has indicated they don't trust management.

Given the p/e on management's estimated earnings, I'll bet stock will recover
IF management is close to being right on their estimates - and if the market
doesn't tank.

Hi Paul - I will look at NCC and JPM as I believe the next sector move will be
in the banks. What is your take on the dollar and the announcement today that
South Korea is looking to other currencies than the dollar to peg their
currency to? My hedge is to invest in "value" companies that hold natural
resources like oil, land and other assets that will appreciate even if the
dollar declines over time.

Many of the oil companies that have assets based on their oil reserves continue
to do well, perhaps due to the potential devaluation of the dollar. I think
there is a long term value play if companies that have assets in natural
resources on their balance sheet could do very well in this environment.

Do you have any new "value" investments that may fit with this theme? I am
thinking of land or other natural resources like lumber, oil & natural gas,
minerals, or other assets that are not affect by the dollar decline.

If this is a long term trend, the Fed will be forced to raise interest rates to
protect the value of the dollar.

I plan to continue to look at value companies that hold assets that will
appreciate in a weak dollar environment. If China determines to peg their
currency to some other currency (like the Euro) than the dollar, we may see a
significant move in many of these "value" companies that have a majority of
their assets in these types of natural resources.

GP comes to mind but there are many other companies that fit this theme. I hold
a large position in EP that has significant natural gas reserves and MRO which
has both oil and real estate (w/ their pipe line assets). I am looking to add
more undervalued companies that may benefit from the change in dollar
denominated assets.

Any ideas?

Hi Spekulatius - I do like under valued bank stocks but it is not evident that
an upward move for bank stocks is imminent. Here is the way I see it.

If the dollar does become weak Vs other currencies, real estate assets will
become more valuable. Regional banks which typically have a larger loan to
value ratio in their domestic real estate portfolio should see an increasing
price to loan value as the dollar weakens. Hence their basket of assets (i.e.
loans) should be more valuable and their loan to value is less. Therefore,
their portfolio of loans are less risky.

I expect the longer yield curve to widen Vs short term rates as expectations of
a weaker dollar will result in higher long term interest rates.

If this occurs, a safe place to park money will be in the regional bank stocks.
They should be able to generate increasing returns based on the change in the
spread of short term rates Vs the 10 year long term rate. This would only occur
if the market determines over the longer term that the dollar compared to other
currencies (like the Euro) will be weaker for years to come.

I may be wrong in my view, but if Mr. Market determines that the dollar is not
the currency of choice and pegs returns based on the value of the Euro, then
long term U.S. interest rates must increase faster to attract new monies from
around the world.

I think we are at a transition point with longer term U.S. interest rates. We
have been at a 40 year low and the next cycle is going to be higher. Value
investments will move higher if their assets are based on "real" purchasing
value regardless of what currency you evaluate them on.

That's my thinking but I have been wrong before.

Spekulatius you must be selective in the bank stocks you evaluate for possible
investment. Their portfolio must contain loans of no more than 70% LTV and have
a majority of their loans w/ adjustable terms. If indeed the yield spread
between short and long term rates occur, regional banks that have the most
flexibility to change their rates will be the most profitable.

E_K_S , i think I can follow your logic but I am not sure that is twill play
out the way. First of all, i believe that a weakening US$ would not be good for
bank stocks. The reason is simply that an increasingly weak currency comes with
higher interest rates which is poison for real estate and bank stocks. However
i agree that the spread that banks are earning may increase with higher
interest rates. The question is what happens in between when rates are rising,
loan volume shrinks,hedging costs are rising and the value of the banks loans
decreases. Also, it appears that the credit risk for the GSE's will increase
which means that banks holding GSE paper might suffer.

I would like to know how evaluate a banks loan portfolio and what regional bank
stocks you are considering for investment.

E_K_S: regarding: "investing in "value" companies that hold natural resources
like oil, land and other assets that will appreciate even if the dollar
declines over time...new "value" investments that may fit with this theme."

I'd say you got it right. "value" in quotes. I'd guess most of these companies
were not Ben Graham value investments last year. This year - now that prices of
most (if not all) companies in these businesses are substantially higher,
there's maybe less margin of safety with them - less "value" and more
speculation to them now. If we're having a sustainable demand for hard assets,
maybe they still might be "values", but I'd guess Dr. Graham would be very,
very cautious about assumptions being made now and purchases proposed
therefrom.

Still, I'm a buyer. Oil companies with p/e's under 10 I find attractive still.
And I'm holding on to almost all the many different asset plays I've initiated
positions on last year, and I'm adding to many them still.

As far as new ideas, I've several that I'm interested in not mentioned here
before:

I have Madharry's MNG on my watch list.
I have GRZ on my watch list.
(I've never been much of a buyer of gold stocks though.)

I took an exploratory position in fmikehugo's idea: Scottish Power PLC (SPI).
(Utility with several power generating/distribution businesses including wind
farms. Seems dull, but stock was able to move up 50% in past three years.)

I've started a position in SJW recently. (land and water; small insider
purchases recently). I'm satisfied with the water stocks I've bought and held
before (still have some CWT), so SJW might be another one that might add some
stability to a portfolio while providing a growing dividend and the possibility
for some cap. gains.

I've bought and sold SZE - it's on my watch list currently.

I have IP on my watch list. This Dow component, the largest landholder in the
USA (I believe), might soon become close enough for a buy (imo). Stock's $37.35
-- maybe a nibble for me under $37, more in $35, $34 range.

It's interesting that you mentioned SJW in your list as I had researched this
company extensively a few years ago. It was extremely undervalued back then (a
few years before their 3for1 split) at $55/share. At the time they held a huge
position in American Water Works stock which was acquired by RWE AG in late
2003. My interest was in their land holdings and I found out that a substantial
of their free flow cash flow back then was generated from a parking lot
operation located on land they had for decades and now services the San Jose HP
Pavilion (Ice Hockey Sharks)parking needs.

The company got a buy out offer in the $80's in the late 90's or early 2001
period which they rejected. I noticed that they trade around $35 which would be
the equivalent of $105 pre split.

Since then I moved on and bought SWWC (http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=swwc) a
water treatment contract operator servicing small municipalities. In no way are
they a value play and in fact sell at a quite high PE. I am buying long term
growth with this company.

I think IP is a good candidate if it falls back to the $33 area or lower. SPI
is also interesting but as a foreign company the dividends are not "qualified"
and subject to a higher tax rate.

The most interesting on your list is NCC. I am doing more research on this
company. I like what I see except but Spekulatius got me thinking about how one
should "evaluate" banks, specifically regional or special entity banks. NCC
appears to have an operation that generates and packages loans and then resells
them. This is typical of most operations and they limit their exposure to loans
they carry in their own portfolio (aka as a "portfolio" lender). NCC also has a
servicing operation that is not subject to interest rate risk but a good
generator of free flow cash flow.

You provided a good list of financial ratios you use to initially scan bank
candidates. I want to buy value but I also want to limit my exposure to
specific company risk due to (1) changes in the yield curve, (2)specific
portfolio loan risks (are they a portfolio lender or do they package and sell
their loans) and (3) buying lots of goodwill (book value can be overstated due
to booked goodwill from previous acquisitions).

Sometimes it is easier to dig down in a small bank's operation to see all of
the divisions and revenue streams than with a conglomerate (like C or JPM).

CENDANT (CD ), which started expensing voluntarily in 2003, has gone even
further. An employee who used to receive an option grant worth $1,000 now
receives about $550 worth of stock -- but only if the company hits financial
targets. That, and CEO Henry Silverman's decision to forgo options starting in
2002, has helped CENDANT cut its equity grants from 59 million options in 2001
to just 1 million options and 12 million shares of restricted stock in 2003.

Results at Masco might be more telling. (MAS, a stock in which I have an

maybe should not have been: I had noticed a bunch of insider sales in the past

HD still has some revenue growth, has reasonable profit margin for the current

Guru's Still Drilling For Black Gold
Matt Rand; data provided by Marketocracy, 02.22.05, 6:55 PM ET

NEW YORK - With oil up over $50 per barrel again, gurus are stocking up on the
companies that produce it. One of their biggest buys was Natchez, Miss.-based
oil-and-gas producer and property-owner Callon Petroleum. The top 100 investors
at Marketocracy added a full 515% to their holdings of Callon, which has
properties mostly in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and is trading at 7.5
times expected 2005 earnings. But analysts' profit estimates vary widely. Based
on high and low estimates, the forward price-to-earnings ratio ranges between
5.2 and 11.8.

The average of the estimates puts the stock's price-to-earnings growth ratio at
just 0.35, based on expected annual growth of 32.5% over the next five years.
Callon closed recently at $15.58.

While I agree with Eric about MS Office (have not upgraded since version 2000),
I disagree about MS Windows. Pretty much everyone upgraded to XP and if they
did not, they should, because it is so much better than 98.

Linux may be a challenger in corporate/government setting, though I believe
that support/transition costs are not trivial and getting
fixes/updates/upgrades for open source software is not a solved problem either.
In personal setting Linux is still lacking mostly for ease of use and
installation, home software (Quicken? Money? Adobe Products - not sure if they
have Linux versions? Wide scanner/printer/camera support? Games?).

Those are mostly technical considerations though. Investment considerations may
be quite different.

For oil, I added to CNQ. Oil sands project starts pumping in 2008.

In addition, J.P. Morgan analysts revised higher their 2006 earnings for Rio
Tinto by 17 percent and for BHP Billiton by 13 percent. The revisions reflect
higher prices for iron ore now projected by J.P. Morgan.

Do you know of any estimates of the potential impact of stock options on the
bottom line?

Look at Yahoo's breakdown of cash flow here:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cf?s=CSCO&annual
Under Financing Activities... section, note the amount paid for stock buybacks
(about $7.8B) and then compare the number of shares at the beginning and end of
the period involved. That'll be the true cost as those purchases which didn't
result in a drop in shares outstanding represented purchase of shares to
prevent dilution from stock options.

From Edgar here:
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000119312504158427/dex131.htm

</u>It looks like the shares outstanding dropped from 7,223M to 7,057M which is
a reduction of 166M. Figuring about $30/share average cost of buyback, that
would be about $5B. If they spent $7.8B total to buy back stock, then the cost
of stock options appears to be just shy of $3B for last fiscal year.

Of course, I'm tired and haven't researched it fully....so I could be all wet.

re CSCO and stock options. Timba's calculation of 3B$ is not too far off. The
earnings stock option adjustment due to new regulations overestimate the
economic impact of employee stock options. With Cisco the annual grant dilution
is about 5%/year due to stock options. My rule of thumb to account for stock
option dilution is to subtract half that grant rate (1/2*5%) from the long term
growth rate to adjust for the adjusted growth rate per share (for comparison
reasons). Another way to calculate the dilution is to look at the total number
of stock option granted (about 1.5B$) multiply with the price/share (17$) and
multiply this option base value with an assumed annual return(let's say 10%).
This would yield a value of 2.55B$/year for Cisco's stock option expense. The
problem with all those methods is that they scale with the companies underlying
market value.

Overall, i feel that Cisco 5% run rate of option dilution is about twice what
it should be.

all or a substantial portion of what you invest then penny stocks are NOT for

it also helps to have a cast-iron belly. cuz if your 3 cent stock happens to
run and go to say 9 bucks and you are still holding and the next couple of days
it drops to 3 bucks and you are STILL holding --- you might PUKE YOUR GUTS OUT.

Armored Vehicle Manufacturer's Buffalo Vehicle Used to Detect, Remove IEDs in
Iraq

LADSON, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 25, 2005-- Force Protection Industries
Inc.'s (OTCBB:FRPT - News) mine clearance vehicle, the Buffalo, received
national attention today in a Los Angeles Times article describing the role of
the armored vehicle as part of a combat engineer patrol used to detect and
remove a remote-controlled bomb Wednesday (2/24) from the Sunni Triangle in
Baghdad.
"Today's report is fresh evidence that our vehicles are saving lives in Iraq,"
said Chief Executive Officer R. Scott Ervin. "Force Protection's vehicles are
specifically designed for this type of mission and provide the very best
protection against the effects of IEDs, roadside bombs, and mine blasts. Our
soldiers and marines need these vehicles to accomplish their missions, and they
obviously need them now."
The Buffalo is part of the Pentagon's hunter-killer team concept that protects
convoys against the threat of mines and IEDs. It incorporates blast protection
technology with automotive components made by such companies as Caterpillar
Inc. (NYSE:CAT - News), Allison Transmission, a division a division of General
Motors (NYSE:GM - News) and Mack Trucks, Inc., a division of Volvo Group
(Nasdaq:VOLVY - News). To date, the Buffalo has been used to clear nearly
36,000 kilometers of roads and find more than 220 IEDs in and around the Iraqi
capital.

"IEDs, mine blasts, and similar explosive threats have become a daily aspect of
current combat and the war on terror," said Ervin. "Our troops face a critical
need for vehicles that can withstand these devastating threats, and we are
honored to provide them with this American-made solution."

Fast becoming the hub for defense technology on the East Coast, Ladson,
S.C.-based Force Protection Industries also produces a troop transport vehicle.
The Cougar series is a family of medium-size mine-protected vehicles that can
be supplied in four-wheel or six-wheel models. The vehicles can be configured
for a wide range of tasks including troop transport of up to 10 personnel,
Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), command and control, reconnaissance and lead
convoy vehicle.

Los Angeles Times Article Features Mine Clearance Vehicle Built by Force
Protection Industries, Inc.
Friday February 25, 5:43 pm ET
Armored Vehicle Manufacturer's Buffalo Vehicle Used to Detect, Remove IEDs in
Iraq

LADSON, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 25, 2005-- Force Protection Industries
Inc.'s (OTCBB:FRPT - News) mine clearance vehicle, the Buffalo, received
national attention today in a Los Angeles Times article describing the role of
the armored vehicle as part of a combat engineer patrol used to detect and
remove a remote-controlled bomb Wednesday (2/24) from the Sunni Triangle in
Baghdad.
"Today's report is fresh evidence that our vehicles are saving lives in Iraq,"
said Chief Executive Officer R. Scott Ervin. "Force Protection's vehicles are
specifically designed for this type of mission and provide the very best
protection against the effects of IEDs, roadside bombs, and mine blasts. Our
soldiers and marines need these vehicles to accomplish their missions, and they
obviously need them now."
The Buffalo is part of the Pentagon's hunter-killer team concept that protects
convoys against the threat of mines and IEDs. It incorporates blast protection
technology with automotive components made by such companies as Caterpillar
Inc. (NYSE:CAT - News), Allison Transmission, a division a division of General
Motors (NYSE:GM - News) and Mack Trucks, Inc., a division of Volvo Group
(Nasdaq:VOLVY - News). To date, the Buffalo has been used to clear nearly
36,000 kilometers of roads and find more than 220 IEDs in and around the Iraqi
capital.

"IEDs, mine blasts, and similar explosive threats have become a daily aspect of
current combat and the war on terror," said Ervin. "Our troops face a critical
need for vehicles that can withstand these devastating threats, and we are
honored to provide them with this American-made solution."

Fast becoming the hub for defense technology on the East Coast, Ladson,
S.C.-based Force Protection Industries also produces a troop transport vehicle.
The Cougar series is a family of medium-size mine-protected vehicles that can
be supplied in four-wheel or six-wheel models. The vehicles can be configured
for a wide range of tasks including troop transport of up to 10 personnel,
Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), command and control, reconnaissance and lead
convoy vehicle.

Started BIIB @38.72 with small initial position. Morningstar said the Tysabri
withdrawal would only take 1-2 off their fair value estimate: MORN 02-28-05 "At
first blush, it seems that Tysabri's withdrawal from the market should inflict
minimal damage to our fair value estimate for Biogen IDEC mostly because we'd
built fairly conservative Tysabri sales projections into our financial model.
We expect to knock only a dollar or two off our fair value estimate ($59.00,
Consider Buy $45.50 Moat Wide), assuming that Tysabri will contribute nothing
to company sales going forward. Further, Biogen's current multiple sclerosis
drug, Avonex, remains a strong competitor in the MS market; Biogen might
actually recognize a short-term benefit as a result of the withdrawal of
Tysabri because it holds all rights to Avonex, while it shared Tysabri profits
on a roughly 50/50 basis with Elan The details surrounding the two cases of
serious adverse effects remain fuzzy, and it will take some time for the
scientists to figure out exactly what went wrong and pinpoint Tysabri's role in
the events. However, it's clear that the rare central nervous system disease
one patient developed (after using Tysabri in combination with Avonex) is
extremely severe and frequently fatal. If Tysabri did trigger the development
of that condition, the drug's future, at least for MS, could be very grim.
Biogen and Elan are continuing development of the compound for Crohn's disease
and rheumatoid arthritis in addition to assessing whether the compound can be
relaunched to treat MS."
I believe their impact estimate is optimistic. Merrill did an interesting
probabilistic expected value analysis using 3 scenarios and arrived at a fair
value of $38, but I found their weightings somewhat pessimistic. In any event,
it's tough to buy a large somewhat diversified biotech [Amgen, Genentech,
Biogen-Idec] at near fair value, so decided to place a smallish bet that the
panic is overdone.

re ADGO.OB. Sold half my position today for a roughly 50% gain, simply for the
reason that this position became to large for such a dinky stock.

FWIW without my small and microcap plays, my portfolio would have been roughly
flat for 2004 and 2005. Microcaps and energy have been the places to be during
the last 2 years, but I am betting that some large cap "moat" stocks like BUD,

The company is profitable, but wouldn't qualify as a value play at this point,

Update on CCL Industries (CCDBF)...

CCL Industries is the type of value stock I love most, because it's a "sleeper"
stock in the sense that it puts anyone to sleep who hears about it. It's not a
flashy oil, pharma, or tech stock and attracts very little interest. They make
plastic bottles, tubes, and labels. Growth in the packaging industry is slow.
Nobody has ever heard of the company, and even better it's based outside the
U.S. and trades in tiny amounts on a foreign exchange. Yet it's a solid,
profitable, 50-year-old firm and probably everyone here has bought their
product, and will continue to do so, due to their partnerships with Unilever,
P&G, Johnson&Johnson, Burt's Bees, etc. etc.

After the latest earnings report in Feb, the stock was "discovered" by the
market. I'll probably wait for some details on how some recent acquisitions are
doing in the next quarterly report, but if that looks good, the company could
probably still be considered undervalued, even at the recent pop in price. Just
my opinion - time will tell.. so far, the market has caught up with much of the
"free money factor" that I saw in January.

I'd be surprised if anyone else here bought the stock (Marc?). I backed up the
truck at around 18. If you did buy - well done: since my posting, it's up 40%.

Cheers,
Kevyn

If we can discuss oil stocks in a value thread, have you considered the oil
sands plays in Canada? There is essentially no exploration risk and the
reserves are larger than can be exploited in my lifetime. At anything over $25
oil, the sands are profitable, and production is slated to double every five
years or so for the next 20 years. The sands are already producing more than
all but two of the OPEC countries. A number of projects can be had for less
than $3/barrel in the ground.

Most of these are traded on the Toronto exchange. I own COS.UN, OPC, and a few
oil-sands related service companies.

Nice moves in those stocks, Gulo, esp. OPC today.
I guess I've been wrong to avoid these Canadian oil sands plays. Reasons are:
small companies, some not profitable, lots of hype/boosting on SI scaring me,
my inexperience and reluctance to buy stocks directly in Canadian market, my
suspicions about Canadian asset stocks in general. My stock positions are
generally small, and so I don't want to be bothered tax-time with concerns
about Canroy trust reporting. So I'm not interested in Canroys.
-------------
I just cannot determine values for these stocks - info is more difficult for me
to come by too. (Info. might be out there and available, so it could be just my
lack of education, experience or capability in analyzing.) For me, I have to
see it as a macro call - oil prices are (I am betting) going to stay high, and
oil companies' profits will be increasing, and maybe their stock prices will
move up further as well.

For me, my oil sands play is Suncor (SU). It's relatively big, profitable, and
easily trades with a US symbol. If stock breaks to new high, I plan to add to
my position.

If you have some recommendations for buys at current price in the oil sands
arena (including "related service companies"), I, and I'd guess others here
too, would be interested in reading of them.

CNQ and SU are probably the best bets for U.S. investors that want to avoid the
COS.UN Royalty Trust. The smaller or less developed players will fluctuate more
with sentiment because their income is a couple of years away.

CNQ is an extremely well run company and has been since its inception. There is
little reason to think it won't continue to grow for the next decade as well as
it has in the last. Its recent run may take a few months to consolidate,
though.

Suncor is suffering a bit from a fire it had in January that cut production in
half. Once they report a firm restart date, the stock should climb nicely to
catch up with the rest.

Of the two, I'd buy Suncor Sept 46 calls. Or one could buy CNQ and write
covered calls, as the options are fairly high priced right now.

RI, RIO, BHP, RTP.

RI. Good one to to pass. I sold all my holdings recently.

I did buy RIO recently. I don't recall if I posted on that. The other mining
stocks I picked up awhile ago are RTP and BHP.

Lots of stories around how new contract iron ore prices to Japan, China and
Europe are up 71% for the coming year. These stocks have had nice increases
over the past year, but I think that the valuations are still very reasonable.

A nice article in the wall street journal yesterday:

Rio Tinto Weighs Adding Capacity.

a few quotes:
"the expansion plans come as Rio Tinto has successfully imposed a 71.5% price
increase on iron ore supplied to several major customers, including japan's
nippon steel and china's dominant steelmaker shanghai baosteel group. the
chinese company also agreed to the same price rise with brazil's CVRD....

driven by unprecedented growth in chinese steel consumption rio tinto and it
main rival BHP Billiton are rushing to expand iron ore production..."

I also added to CNQ. good post Gulo.

Grommit, couple sectors like housing and oil/gas seem pricey to me. (stock
prices vs. current balance sheet numbers). So stock prices going forward may
depend heavily on companies seeing increasing or sustained demand for the
product. I'd say for housing, that might be iffy; for me I can't conclude that
exiting stock positions in this sector is early or not. Time will tell though.

--------

Several here apparently like CNQ as an oil sands play. So for me who is
considering upping my bet in this area, I'll now consider starting CNQ rather
than adding more SU. Both stocks should participate similarly (although perhaps
not equally)if the sector grows. Diversifying reduces the business risk of
having shares of just one company.

The Plastic Packaging division in LA apparently had some mgmt problems, but the
company has been taking steps to address those last year with a resulting
improvement in profits (though that division still had a small loss). Overall,
the company has been on an even keel the last few years and pursuing a slow but
steady set of acquisitions in Europe and Asia. The Steinbeis acquisition in
January means that CCL now makes 70% of the world's battery labels.

I don't see CCL as some kind of powerhouse - simply that at the prices earlier
this year, it was a serious bargain even assuming very slow growth (the most
likely scenario). Like many people on this thread I'm a firm believer that the
market always returns a stock price to the "right" valuation eventually. And
this strategy has paid off very well for me over my investment career.

re Broadcasting/TV stocks. Decided to buy some TVL in my search for uncommon
values. TVL is a TV company with presence in the US and Puerto Rico, the latter
i found the most interesting after musing how the demographics favor UVN. Stock
is cheap by some but not all metrics.

Positives are
+ FCF around 70M$ for Y2004
+ TVL has been reducing debt
+ increasing operational efficiency
+ revenue growth bolstered by demographics
+ trading near 52 week low
- major shareholder controls destiny
- 630M$ in debt
- risk of committing capital to unproductive acquisitions
- no dividend
- odd years are weak years

In the end i found that the FCF of 70M$ with a market cap of 900M$ appears like
a good deal. I established a full position today. I also start to research
other broadcasting stocks since many are trading near lows i believe there is
value there. Please note that the yahoo numbers (key statistics) for TVL are

I'm still buying some that're on that list too.

Added a smidge today of IACI and PXD. I'm considering whether to add more JPM
at current price to my very small exploratory position.

My opinion -fwiw (not much)- or my feelings (worth even less) on some of these
stock is/are:

WM - I'm just not comfortable with it at $42+. Not that being comfortable
should comport with decent sell or buy decisions. The stock's not really done
anything since maybe May '03. I've recently trimmed my position. Will consider
adding should stock drop under $40 again.

FNM, FRE -- every time I look at these something scares me off.

I gave up on HON too soon; stock's up near highs now. I'm not a fan though.

DEL with a high Piotroski score of maybe 9 and 3 funds holding it, is too
expensive for me to begin to establish a position now at current price of
$45.80. Bwidk: I passed on it at much lower prices.

Now that I consider it, I suspect all of us who've been value investors for
more than a decade will have a story about every one of the stocks on Stewart's
list: A missed opportunity here when a stock was passed over, a
selling-too-soon there, or maybe something else. I assume though, that at least
a few of the companies were picked up at low enough prices and are being held
profitably (on paper or maybe cashed in). And I assume most of us have a few
that we own that we're still waiting to come around. (For me that'd include
PFE, DTV, et. al.)

chunk of it in 1992. I bought more later when the price dropped - "the falling

everything for a tax loss. Naturally the stock quintupled in the next 4 years

Here's the information for the top scoring stocks reorganized by score. It
includes even stocks held by one or two funds.

DEL - I suspect that it's going up based on prices paid for timberlands, as
well as the improving pulp & paper cycle, and probably due to potential for
higher inflation. There seems to be a move on for timber companies to separate
their timberlands into REIT-like companies and operating companies (e.g. Boise
Cascade - Officemax). So, it's probably more an asset play for most of the
value players.

CMCSA is a recent Buffett buy.

JJZ is really interesting to me. I can see buying close to the current price
based on an improving financial condition and it's historical cash flow as well
as brand presence. It is the result of the reorganization of U.S. Industries
following a lot of restructuring. Lots of debt but it seems manageable.
