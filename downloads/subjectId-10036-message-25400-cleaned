SCMR,

The Price/Sales on SCMR is like 11. From a business owner perspective, that is
paying a dollar for 9 cents in yearly sales. That's too high for me to expect
much stock appreciation unless they can really grow the business or make a good
acquisition.

On the other hand, it is a tech stock, downside is limited with all that cash,
and people can bid up tech stocks to ginormous levels, say maybe it is worthy
of some investment.

Thanks,
MC

Oh come on Brinks no one would ever throw you out *S*. Your ideas are always
very thoroughly researched and presented and many here bought DPTR as a result
of your presentation. I tried to but it got away from me and I wouldnt chase
it. I do think popularity comes with a pricetag though, and the stock is up at
least 50% since you presented it and the market cap is $1.6 Billion. For that
kind of market cap they better have something significant.

I'm not in any hurry to buy and have non productive funds at work. I just keep
in mind that value stocks usually don't look good when they represent value,
and when companies are in trouble the foresight to envision how they will
become good businesses again is a gift I don't have. In fact the last 12 month
earnings were in large part interest on the cash hoard.

Take a stock like TWI which I was buying at $2-3. The Company was in trouble
and looked like bankruptcy was possible. Not having the fundamental foresight
to envision the mining boom and shortage of large wheels that would develop, I
never participated in this move. All I knew was that it looked like a value on
the books but bankruptcy if they continued the losses at that rate. What saved
them was some financial restructuring and the subsequent mining boom.

Maybe another way to look at SCMR p/sales ratio is to separate the company's
value into two parts --- (1)the cash component and (2) the business part that
generates the sales. P/sales number, instead of being 3.70/sales per share,
becomes (3.70-3.20)/sales per share. That is a lot lower number than 11 and
maybe provide a more realistic measure of what p/sales is for the business
aspect of SCMR. (Just a rough number because I assume the business does require
some cash, so not all of the $3.20/sh cash component can be subtracted out.)

Regarding FSP...
Well, like I said before, I am NOT finding the kind of microcap value stocks
that I used to. And or maybe because of that...and the fact that I dont have
"other than stock market & interest" income anymore....I find myself valuing
preservation of capital more than in the past.

Another reason I liked FSP was the company was, in the past, buying back stock.

I think they spent $7 million and change and the highest average price paid
during a quarter was like $20.59.

They did not buy any back in the 3 months contained in the most recent 10q
however.

My concern with FSP is their business model...the way they raise capital with
these private placement deals which they later fold into FSP. I listened to a
presentation months ago and they said a very large percentage of their private
placement partcipants came back and bought another.

So these folks take the bigger risks and make the bigger rewards and then get
FSP stock instead of cash. So when their salesmen are calling them for more
private placement money, it seems to me that it can have the effect of causing
those folks to sell their FSP to buy what they consider more lucerative
investments. (Albiet without the regular income or "safety" that the higher
quality FSP-owned properties have.

I guess Im comparing apples to oranges...risk capital versus steady dividends &
possible capital appreciation.

But, i see private placement sellers as holding the shareprice down somewhat.
Of course, that theory might be flawed in that the folkd investing in these
private placements have so much money they just let it ride and dont take the
gain and add different money to buying the next private placement.

What Im looking for out of FSP is an annualized total return in the 8-15% range
over the next 3-5 years. Anything above that would gravy.

I purchased WSTL yesterday for many of the reasons you mentioned. (Stellar
balance sheet, etc.) I also believe that they have a strong presence in the DSL
market that could be expanded with new applications. The stock is currently
rated an A by Schwab.

As an aside, there was an interesting article in Barrons outlining the
components to how Schwab rates stocks. Below is an excerpt about their track
record.

Since 2003, the model portfolios of Charles Schwab (ticker: SCHW) have
dominated the long-term rankings compiled by Zacks Investment Research, which
compares the focus lists of about a dozen major Wall Street brokerages. Schwab
has been first in either the three- or five-year period in each ranking, except
one, when it finished second over three years.

Greg Forsythe created the system and I agree with many of the principles he has
incorporated. Here is what he says about analysts.

Forsythe points to a study his team did of Wall Street earnings projections and
stock recommendations, as compiled by Zacks. (See chart). From 1995 through
2004, the stocks with the lowest earnings- growth forecasts and worst ratings
beat those with the highest. Street analysts are capable, says Forsythe, but
it's a "perverse" capability. "You are better off doing the opposite of what
they do. I am not saying these aren't smart people. My explanation is a
misplaced research focus," he says.

He rates free cash flow and cash on the balance sheet as very important
elements of his rating system and he considers "short sellers" to be the smart
money. I have found that the odds are usually against you if you are investing
in a stock with high short interest.

Getting back to WSTL, I think it is a good "January effect" candidate. I bought
yesterday because the "January effect" stock run might start in December this
year because of the strong market action. Technically, I also like the strong
on-balance volume ratio that WSTL is showing and the cup and handle formation
it has developed since the last dip.

SCMR,

Paul/analizer, I agree that subtracting out cash is another good way to look at
multiple. Most analysts I see do that.

So you look at earnings/sales multiples on the business minus cash with
interest income subtracted out. The issue then is say the core business is at
Price/Sales of 2. Even if Price/Sales multiple on core business moves to 4, not
a huge move in the overall stock price, since mkt cap >> sales. On the other
hand, doesn't seem like you are going to lose on SCMR unless management really
makes a boneheaded decision, and it has been to 5.25 in the last year. May be
worth a starter position.

MNDO and CSTL are a couple of stocks with less cash (but still ample) and hence
less cushion, but more leverage to improved operating results due to lower
Price/Sales. I'd consider buying more of these in the mid-to-low 2's, but SCMR
is a safer stock.

does overwhelm the business aspect even if that lower psr doubles. If somebody
buys the stock they get the safety of the cash, but the capital appreciation
isn't there unless the crowd happens to move in again to propel the stock again

I spoke to John LeFrere at BHO. Interesting conversation about the large holder
who has already reduced from 1.5 mil shares to .968 mil shares.

The Company's current debt., covenants, and ratios and buyback authorization at
this point would allow them to spend 10 mil to 10.5 mil. within 12 months on a
buyback.

Gandhara Advisors Europe LLP Advisors Europe LLP is the European hedge fund
that has been selling and providing the upside resistance. This Co. got the
shares placed with them by a Division of Duetche Bank in a complicated deal
regarding BHO's 2005 financing. BHO would not have went for the deal had they
known Duetche was placing the shares with Gandhara but they had no control of
it once the shares were out of their hands.

Gandhara Advisors Europe LLP seems to be in trouble. They got killed on Asian
Energy stocks in Q3. 80% of their London Staff has been let go. They have been
firing people involved in the recent Asian stock debacles as well.

Management of BHO has approached them and negotiations were not successful to
buy the block of stock.Gandhara wants 14.50. BHO can not pay that, even if they
feel its undervalued at 14.50. BHO would buy the block only if it increased NAV
to BHO enough to outweigh the longer term benefits of buying ships. They are
limited by debt ratios and covenants as to how much they can spend on buybacks
in 12 month period. Currently $10.5 mil. They would pay 10.50 for the block
such that it would make it more attractive then buying the ships they planned
on. They still think Ghandara might cave in at some point. Ghandara was offered
alot more and said no in the past, only to end up selling at less than they
were offered. They were offered 18 by another party in 06, said no, and began
selling again at 16 in dribs and drabs. Obviously a 2-3 billion dollar hedge
fund with some poor judgment.

So bottom line, while Co. is worth more, a print of 11 bucks on heavy trade,
would entice me. It's a stock gonna be flat a while.

Glad my starter position is small. Sometimes its not the value, but the supply
and demand that matters - even if a temporary situation.

The Co. borrowed to buy ships. Not to buy stock, but at some point the return
on assets becomes so great, that they would buy the stock rather than the ships
they planned.

They are occupied in Asia now with refurbishments which have been taking about
30 days longer than planned. Chinese shipyards do the work 30% below US
shipyards, so that's where the work is being done.

They do not expect any reported losses, and expect stable reported earnings
based on time charter revenue. The wet side has weakened a little (
distillates, jet fuel, etc.) while the dry side remains strong. They expect by
Q3-Q4 they will be peak earnings all things remaining as is, because more ships
will be employed at favorable rates, and $2 mil per quarter of costs will
disappear.

Given the markets anticipatory nature and six month average lead time between
stock price and events I'd say if you see some very high prints over next few
months and price is down, its time.

Thanks MCsweet for your assist.

That Schwab/Forsythe article in Barron's really took me aback. I liked Mr.
Forsythe's ideas and conclusions about brokerages and p/e. This part got to me
though:

"Among other things, SER (ed. the Schwab's model) compares inventories to
sales, that is, a balance-sheet account with an income account. Traditional
analysis loves high profit margins and strong returns on equity, but Forsythe
says the former has zero correlation to stock returns and the latter just 'some
value" In fact, the 'ratio of free cash flow to equity gives you more insight
into future stock returns,' he says."

That's a shock, and it's scary to me. I certainly see where inventory:sales
ratio is important, and of course also free cash flow. My way of looking at
stocks focuses heavily on evaluating profit margins against the stock price and
return on equity to stock price. If Mr. Forsythe's right, I've got it ALL
wrong. Yikes. Perhaps my results are only random. That would hurt, considering
how much effort I put into my models and picking stocks thereby.

In the example given (2 top-rated picks from each of 10 sectors), I see where
the majority have worked out very well, if they were recommend when their stock
prices were lower in the past twelve months. For me, I just don't like to see
so many stocks still being recommended even as their stock prices are at record
highs.

If you look at the charts of the stocks mentioned in the link, you will see
that the majority have share prices that bottomed sometime in 2003. So I
imagine that they are long-term secular plays that continue to outperform in
this environment. The Schwab rating system includes momentum as part of their
formula so they will never be buying stocks that are bottoming.

Something also mentioned in the article is the importance of cash equivalents
on the balance sheet. The following is a quote from the article.

Another important element is cash. "We've found that generally [stocks of]
companies that have a lot of cash, relative to their market value, perform
well." Some argue that a high cash level means that management doesn't know
what to do with it, "but that's not what the data tell us," Forsythe says. Why?
Well, unless it's an IPO, "if you have a lot of cash you've probably been
earning it...and that's a good thing."

This is something that served me well when I bought CKSW which I posted on
Value Investing before.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=22424714&srchtxt=cksw

With micro-caps I like to focus on how they are strengthening their balance
sheet from quarter to quarter. One stock that I have recently purchased is
pbme, another micro-cap which is generating positive cash flow and adding cash
to the coffers. The company currently has .31 per share in cash for a stock
that is selling at 1.08. I like the services they offer and believe it is a
growing trend in health care. I have taken a small position (one-quarter of
what I'm willing to invest) and will wait to see how their revenues increase as
I suspect there could be choppiness due to the initiation schedules of clinical
trials.

I dont know that name but heard and interviw with Winters of Evergreen Fund and
he likes CNQ and also holds PPP, which I dont own (yet). I saw that Duke energy
is written up in barrons spinning off their ng unit. I also saw that ME which i
no longer own is above 20 and reported nice results. Unfortunately being fully
invested most of the time it seems that whatever i sell goes up more than
whatever i buy at least in the short term.
I still think about that question about holding on to something long enough to
make a really big score on it and then I think that unless you think like WEB
meaning buy a growth stock at a value price and then hold on for a long time,
its hard to do that. As value investors thats what we look for so I know I tend
to sell something thats seems fairly priced to buy something that seems
underpriced, when I do that I miss out on something that could then become
tremendously overvalued based on the parameters used for my initial investment.
The extreme case for me of this was buying ICGE at a close to ipo price of $15,
looking at the financials and market cap and liquidating the balance of my
position in 70 range and then watching it soar in a matter of months to $240
before crashing and ultimately becoming a penny stock. I bought apple in the
teens and sold it in the twenties several hundred percent ago. UBB I bought in
the low teens and sold in the higher teens after some investment mgr who had
recommended it for years announced he had liquidated his position and that
there were much better buys on there. Last time I looked it was in the $80s.

There is also an issue of diversification I think its emotionally difficult to
keep more than 10% of ones nest egg in
one security unless its something like BRKB. When ICGE became 20% of my
portfolio I was on pins and needles so that would certainly be my limit.

I will give you the secrets to overcoming problems with "holding on to
something long enough to make a really big score on it"

(Just wanted to jazz up my headline sentence a little here on a quiet Sunday
afternoon.)

Okay, a "big score". We've talked about it before, and from what I gather (with
public and private responses), we almost all say that we have trouble getting
and holding one (or more) of these. The ten-bagger discussion. About which
there are at least two aspects:
1. Can you find them and hold on to them for the 10x rise?
2. Did you put enough money into such an investment to make a lot of money
('big score') at the end?

One of only a couple examples I remember on this thread is the person who made
30x or 50x or more in a couple of years on his very concentrated 'portfolio' of
two investments in Chinese internet stocks, back in the day. I believe he said
he sold most of his holdings near the top for $500k.

My whole investing theme for the past decades has been to discover what works
in investing for the average guy. So, for me, I say, if so many people (esp.
value investors) have such difficulty in achieving the 'big score', then I say
let's forget about it. Let's reframe this into something that's doable,
workable, and has better success possibilities.

Instead of seeking the 'big score', let's look to make good money. What seems
to happen is that some stocks we like go higher longer than what we deem
reasonable (or than we have confidence to hold on). As stock continues higher,
confidence declines (sometimes), and anxiety increases. So to overcome this,
one takes profits on scale up. When one perceives the peak - either in the
stock price or the anxiety level - and one sells out --- KEEP a small amount---
a STUB. The benefits are these:

1. If the stock continues to rise, not only is a little more money made, but
the psychological benefits are positive... one is still a participant.
2. If the stock declines, it's just a small offset to the gains that were
previously taken on that position. Should the stock drop seriously enough, you
can sell the stub: a small loss that confirms your good judgment and good
fortune that the stock was mostly sold at the peak.
3. If enough stubs of different stocks are held, the $ gains -- and there will
be gains -- will add to the portfolio's value.
3a. The dollar gains from stubs are surreptitious. The amounts are cumulative
but small enough individually (by stub) and daily/weekly (by $ change), that
they are not in-your-face noticeable.
This means that over time, one pays less attention to stub holdings and that
the companies can go about their businesses and the stock can rise without the
stub holder investor having to focus on the company's stock price every day.
You go from anxious money working for you, to patient money working for you.

I was going to list some examples I hold; I don't know where to begin - I have
at least 40. Some old stubs I still have would be EK (accumulated from 1930's
mostly sold 1960's and most recent sale in 2004), IBM (from 1995, last sales in
2005), SUNW (from 1995 last sales maybe 2000), AAPL (okay, I won't mention it
-g-), RJR (2002 purchase, sales in 2003), MO, JST, KNDL,PCYC, VVTV, JST, LH,
CAH, etc. etc.

Appreciate your list of high yielding CEFs.

None really meet my "buy" criteria but then several of the ones I hold no
longer do either.
In particular, your COY and DHF have really high expense ratios at 2.39% and
2.98% according to ETFCONNECT.COM.

What Im looking for, but havent been finding lately, is a reasonable yield, low
expenses and one that trades at a DISCOUNT to its NAV. Preferably one that is
trading at an abnormally high discount to NAV.

Im not real high on junk bond funds but would consider one if it met my other
criteria.

My first CEF buy was ZTR as it was recommended by someone I respect as a good
money market alternative. I bought it in late August of 05 and for some time,
it actually UNDERperformed a money market fund. I kept reinvesting divdends and
now it trades at an 11% premium and Its hard for me to hold something that
trades so far above NAV despite its nice monthly distribution.
Im up 28.23% in just over 15 months.

When I bought it, it yielded 10.55% and was trading at a discount to NAV of
5.20%.

My next buy came 12/28/05 and I found it by scanning insider buy reports. The
secretary and portfolio manager bought 7000 shares a few days prior and it was
yielding 9.43% and traded at an 11% discount at the time.

Im up about 23.3% on EVV in just over 11 months. (I didnt do dividend
reinvestment here but just added the dividends & interest to figure my total
return)

Next came JQC 2/6/06. It was trading at a 13% discount to NAV and an 8.08%
yield and had just announced a 10% stock buyback.
They later increased their monthly distribution.
It now trades at a less than 1% discount to NAV and a 7.99% yield. Im up about
22% in 10 months.

The next day, 2/7, I bought UTF, I saw an insider buy and it traded at a 14.45
discount to NAV with a relatively low 5.87% yield. Im up 23.1% in 10 months.

My final CEF buy was RTU on 3/27 when I saw a recent insider buy. It sported a
7.42% yield and traded at a 15.5% discount to NAV. Im up 23.72% in just over 8
months.

The last 2 have performed well, but unlike the others, their discounts to NAV
havent narrowed as I had hoped.

I have been actively looking for more to buy but just havent found them.

Indeed, since the ones I have bought have performed SO much better than I
anticipated, Im wondering if I just got lucky from a timing perspective and
maybe I should be selling some of them. (I bought these looking for perhaps an
8-12% annualized total return)

I an hoping some opportunities present themselves later this month as I have
WAY too much cash sitting idle and have for a long time.

As I said before, I am new to "income investing" as I always used to feel like
I could do a lot better picking value microcap stocks. (And for many, many
years, I did just that.)

I have now got my full position in azecf. (ARUZE) which is japanese maker of
arcade games, ownere of arcade parlors , and maker of slot machines and othere
gaming machines . The arcade game business is not doing well and is in
transition. some of the games are being marketed now as games to be played on
cell phones. But the main reasons why I purchased the stock and made it a large
position in my portfolio are: 1. It owns a large position in Wynn , whose value
is more than the current market cap of the company, so the rest of the business
is free. 2. There is a good likelihood that Japan will permit casinos in the
next few years there fore Aruze/Wynn will be a ground floor opportunity. Aruze
will win two ways by participating in a casino and buy selling gaming machines.
Aruze has an excellent website and all of its financial information is there.
80% of the company is family controlled. This is one example where I am
liquidating stubs to participate in a new position I really like. 3. The
company may benefit from increased consolidation in the gaming industry. 4. The
company trades and derives most of its revenue in foreign currency. 5. I
believe the Japanese are becoming larger investors in their own stock market. A
stock like Aruze might well capture their interest as japan moves through the
casino approval process.
As always do your own dilligence.

About doing value plays on short side here. As moderator I say eeech.

On the one hand, short selling goes against Graham and Buffett, and imo, the
spirit of this thread. My personal belief - stated here several times - gg- is
that for most people the idea sounds right... something is undervalued, ergo
buy it; something owned becomes overvalued, ergo sell it. Something is found
that is fundamentally overvalued (not owned)same conclusion: sell it by
shorting it. Short-selling an overvalued stock being just the reverse (or
converse or something) of buying undervalued. It is not. Short-selling - the
skills required/emotional requirements, etc. - are quite different from value
investing. My analogy is like walking backwards. Walking backwards should be
the reverse of regular walking. Seems easy enough, but it is not.
From my reading and my experience, short selling - although it might seem
appealing - should best be left to professionals.

OTOH, that's MY opinion. Others here will differ. (I only guess; I don't know,
never having surveyed the readers.) I suspect that since people are here
mostly/sometimes to get ideas to make money, if they could get short-sell ideas
that they like, they'd say the heck with my opinion/prejudices against
short-selling.

I say go ahead and post your ideas/suggestions. This is not a busy thread, and
there's room for your opinions. You might make somebody happy.

(Post your important growth-at-a-reasonable price ideas too. We occasionally
see this type on the thread. As moderator I ask that you identify these somehow
as GARP stocks or "not a value stock"; otherwise people may jump off their
chairs when they read the post -- misinterpreting your stock as a value pick,
and posting back telling you that they don't see it in any way as value stock.)

I've held PFE for it's low p/e and dividend yield. Something now about the year
2011. If the main drug, accounting for 1/4 of earnings, comes off patent then,
and if there's no backup forthcoming, then for me, I'd rather place more money
on Canadian oil trusts, where there's a much better dividend (it seems) until
tax changes in 2011, and there's a possibility that oil prices and these trust
stock prices will rise before then.

I sold 1/2 my PFE position this a.m. and am cutting my ABT position by 1/4.

If WYNN stays up, then ARUZE should do okay also. That's a significant IF.

Looks like ARUZE is at an all-time high? Gambling stocks up sharply today; WYNN
up $5.6 to $93, so maybe not such a good day to be buying ARUZE.

I have a little LVS (among other gambling stocks). I'd like to continue to make
a long-term bet on Chinese/Asian gambling, and rather than add to LVS, I'm
willing to diversify by going with WYNN a little through ARUZE. And for me, I'm

A 2-3 year play. I attack it this way:

I really can't assess the value of WYNN. It's so expensive based on standard
value metrics. We presume gambling will be big in the Asian settings. Whether
governments will confiscate profits with onerous taxes, hurtful regulations,
outright confiscations through license expirations, we do not know.

With ARUZE, being in Japan, it has its own problems --- difficult for the
typical American investor to understand or assess.

IF, that's IF, things do work out okay ARUZE (& WYNN), we will know this over
the next year or two. I'm betting we will know it slowly as we get more info.
and more of an understanding of what's going on. This I am betting, will cause
the stock price to move pari passu. (aside: Yippee! I got to use that Latin
thingy!) In other words, there should be plenty of opportunity to profitably
add to positions, if ARUZE begins to do well from here.

you may be right but my experience is that first the stocks move and start to
look pricey and then the information comes out that makes the price not quite
as out there as one might think. When apple started with the itunes i bought
the stock, then i listened to all the naysayers that kept saying how little
apple would make on the sales of itunes. This was of course before the ipod
came out. By the time the ipod was announced the stock had already risen quite
a bit and apple no longer looked like a bargain. When WYNN IPoed I think it
came out at $13.50, I dont recall anyone jumping up and down pounding the table
saying that we should buy it or watch it. Now that its $90 we are seeing
recommendations in Barrons. As far as I know I am the only one mentioning Aruze
now. Sometimes its lonely on the bottom too.

Well for me, I'm buying a little ARUZE which to me is buying WYNN now at an
expensive (by standard value metrics) price. I'm on the same slopey line now as
someone considering the stock back at $13.50. Then it had no earnings or even
had built structures. If one had faith one could certainly have taken a big
position @13.50 or whatever the initial price was. If one wanted to be a
participant and just see how a bet on Mr. Wynn (his successful history) might
turn out, one could have bought at the beginning, added or begun at $25, $50,
$75, etc. There were profits to be made by buying all along the way. Depending
on how much a person went in for and when, and if and when more stock was added
to the position, that could be worse or better than somebody who took an
initial big position at say $13.50 and just held on.

As was said earlier about big scores though, a person with normal emotions who
has a very big portfolio bet on something that goes from $13.50 to $90 has had
a darn difficult time holding on. There's been plenty of negativity in the
media about WYNN along the way.

Madharry, aren't we on the same sloping line now? It's just that we're at $90+,
not sure where WYNN and Mr. Wynn will be going from here. Same issue though:
Buy a lot of WYNN now (through ARUZE, a 25% holder), or buy less now, watch and
wait, maybe buy more later if WYNN stock continues its rise. You prefer the
former, I the latter.

Hi Paul - I continue to hold all my drug companies even with the PFE news. I
still believe that they have excellent long term value prospects and they
provide good diversification to any portfolio. My annual HMO fees increased 20%
for 2007 and I suspect that as the baby boomers age, the most cost effective
choice by doctors will be to just prescribe more drugs.

In order for the drug companies to add new drugs to their future pipe line,
they will need to acquire more of the innovative biotech companies that are
working on these new products. I have recently allocated new dollars to this
area but they are not typical value propositions.

AVI Biopharma Inc. (AVII) is one I bought a starter position in last week. They
are a research company with labs located in Corvallis Oregon and generate most
of their income through Federal research contracts. The company’s lead product
candidate, Resten-NG, is a NEUGENE antisense drug for treating cardiovascular
restenosis, or the renarrowing of a coronary artery following angioplasty. The
idea is to line stints with this drug and it makes the procedure more
effective. This product alone makes the company very attractive at current
prices. They are also working on different types a vaccines that may have some
promise too.

It is hit or miss with many of these biopharmaceutical companies but perhaps
with enough stub positions, I may hit the 10-20 bagger.

1) Any ideas on where to find good cheap value prospects in the health care
industry?
-------------------------------------------------------------

I picked up a few more shares of WON as they hit a new weekly low on lower
volume. I think that the tax loss selling is now over. Their largest
shareholder is CBS radio and WON stated that they have formed a committee to
renegotiate their long term contract with CBS that expires in 2009. I wonder if
this may involve CBS just acquiring the company and folding the different
divisions into CBS. CBS has lots of money as they recently sold some of their
radio assets.

-------------------------------------------------------------

My largest holdings are oil and natural gas stocks but as I continue to scan
low PE and high cash flow companies, many of these conglomerates continue hit
my list. XOM, CVX and COP continue to look like very attractive value
propositions even at their current high prices. I will be adding some more
shares of ConocoPhillips (COP) on any pull back as I like their domestic
holdings. I did not realize that they even mine deposits of oil sands in
Canada! I missed my last chance a few month's back when it touched $55.

--------------------------------------------------------------

I am also concerned about the long term prospects of the U.S. $ and the
potential for it to fall relative to many of the other foreign currencies. I
can only think of one way to protect my buying power (relative to the U.S. $)
and that is to own companies that own hard assets (like oil) and have global
exposure. Again the large oil conglomerates fit this criteria.

Any value propositions that protect ones portfolio with a falling U.S. $?

Metrogas is an Argentinian Gas regulated utility and pipeline company. MGS went
on the brink of bankruptcy in 2002 during hte argentinian crisis but has

stock went down because the government did not yet approve rate increases.
After the deb restructuring the balance sheet appears to be in a decent shape

and according to yahoo profile, MGS has about 2 Million customers and owns
15,800km of pipelines.

Dang. EKS, a cat just walked across my keyboard hitting the shutdown button
before I could send a detailed message to you about the stocks you requested.
Arrgh. I hate when that happens.

Here's a condensed version:

No, I've no cheap prospects in the health care sector. I own a bunch, nothing
cheap that I'd buy or recommend. Maybe, maybe penny stock ALRG.ob or PCYC if it
drops .75 to where some insiders recently bought ($4.75/sh). That is reaching
though.
I'm shuffling among big pharma with adds or buys of SNY and GSK; sells of
higher p/e ABT.

Plays to protect portfolio if the dollar continues falling:

Foreign stocks. Maybe especially ones dealing with hard assets. Some ideas:

RIO. (I have a few shares.)Iron ore to Chinese steel industry. Chinese
infrastructure build-up continues. Renminbi might rise if dollar falls.

NTO. A Madharry pick. Gold and copper producer in Argentina. (I'm in for a few
shares.)

HULCF.pk. A Dale Baker pick. (This stock doesn't seem to get much affirmation
on his thread.) An asset manager of Canadian junior oil/gas companies which
sells apparently quite a bit below net asset value. (I'm a recent buyer of a
few shares.)

Maybe some of these multinationals that derive a lot of their sales overseas.
BAC or C??

You and I could mention a bunch of oil sands plays, integrated oilers which you
mentioned, small USA oil/gas companies, oil suppliers.

Here are several stock though that are not mentioned much on SI:

HUWHY.pk for its many port facilities. Company has problems (3G wireless), and
stock has done not so well past year. Can be played through Hong Kong real
estate company CHEUY. Both controlled by billionaire Li Ka-Shing. Another China
real estate play: CDEVY. (I hold shares in these three.) Perhaps French TKP.
(Technip provides engineering, technologies, and construction services to the
oil, gas, and petrochemical industries worldwide.) Relatively undervalued
(compared to peers), according to 11/27/06 article by M. Curtin (European
Trader columnist) in Barron's. (I hold a few TKP shares.)

Paul, good decision on PFE, IMO. Their business plan is broken. I think there
is a real risk that this stock may see the high teens. I still own all my ABT
and have no intention to sell yet - indeed PFE loss may be ABT win.

Retail IS frothy at the moment, but I think ANF and URBN are way too dangerous
- and too good at what they do. If I was going to look for a retail company to
short, I'd look for companies with high debt (or at least some debt), tough
comparisons vs. last year, and some sort of impediment to future growth or any
other developments that might compress margins.

ETH could work, TGT is another one that might be interesting. I haven't looked
closely at either one though.

FWIW, I do own URBN right now, out of ANF.

And, because I'm in basic agreement with Paul on the long/short issue, I'll
mention that CWTR is a retailer I'm looking at on the long side right now.

I wonder -do you know how they make their money? I ask because Bolivia is a
large supplier of natural gas to south america and the country has nationalized
that industry forcing companies to renegotiate their agreements. Does this have
any effect on MGS?

BTW aruze closed up over 7% in japan.

MGS is an utility - they pass on their cost of NG to their customers. The gas
comes from Argentina itself. I assume the whole industry is somewhat regulated.
That's one of things that is holding back MGS. if Argentine continues to
recover MGS is do well. For 440M$ EV, 15,800 km of pipeline and the
infrastructure to supply 2 million customer should be way below replacement
value.

curious why you are wanting to raise cash now. xec has not done very well so
far. I own a little. I just repurchased spinoff ME, reducing my overweight
exposure to mmg. Seems like that had some pretty good success with their
drilling last quarter. I am hoping they continue to outperform. I continue to
stay fully invested. The news about Iraq just seems awful: I am hearing things
like lets withdraw security from the rest of the country and make sure we
protect bagdad. That doesnt make much sense to me, I think for the us to be
halfway successful in Iraq they are going to have to stop the foreign
intervention and support to the shi-ites, something they have not been able to
do so far. Also its getting cold in the east now. I try to look at my portfolio
performence on a quarter to quarter basis. Q1 was wonderful and I have been in
breakeven/loss mode since. I am hoping for a good q4 to make up for
non-productive previous 2Qs.

mcdep & trusts --

he thinks that the effect of the canadian tax on the trusts might be around
20%. that was my calculation also.

http://www.mcdep.com/rtweek61103.pdf

i think that by the year 2011, energy will be 50% to 100% more expensive. So
the dividends will not be cut to pay the canadian tax bill, they will actually
increase by 30% to 80% by then.

15% yields plus 15% annual appreciation = 30% annual return. here's a few with
high yields, decent reserves and optimistic outlooks.

AAV 16%
HTE 17%
PWI 15%
PWE (has oil sands) 11%
CNE 17%
ERF (has oil sands) 10%

and the stocks prices are already cut by 20% to 30%, while the dividend risk is
years away:

High Yield ETF's
My approach is probably different than many others. I position
a basket of high yield ETF's looking for a yield above 10%. I hold the
performers and sell the underperformers. I have a tollerance for holding issues
that may be down but never hold below 10% loss. My current portfolio has three
small losers with a loss of less than the one year div return. Overall the
group has a gain of more than 17% not counting dividends.
I use the same approach in small stocks with a 9/18/06 portfolio of 10 small
stocks that has been pared to four. The six I sold made a small gain but
underperformed the others. The ones left are as follows: EGHT +58.65, FTEK
+101.64%, GTI +20.93%, SIGM +76.23 I use this approach rather than a lot of
analysis partly because I don't like reading reports and as it turns out they
aren't accurate anyway. I also use P&F charts that give a simple picture of
supply and demand.
Best,
Cosmo

Opos, bad typo in last post. Allen Organ had 62 mil, not 92 mil in 2005

ban. Roughly about 1/2 of the balance sheet is covered by net cash and they
have a processing business that has nothing to do with gambling left (assuming
that internet gambling business is going away). Nicely valued as is with a nice

Dynasil Announces Fiscal Year 2006 Results
Tuesday December 12, 8:30 am ET

WEST BERLIN, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dynasil Corporation of America
(OTCBB:DYSL.OB - News), announced results of operations for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2006. Dynasil is a fabricator of optical blanks from
synthetic fused silica, fused quartz, and other optical materials for the
semi-conductor, laser, space and optical components industries. Through its
subsidiary, Optometrics Corporation, it is a worldwide supplier of optical
components including diffraction gratings, thin film filters, laser optics,
monochromators, and specialized optical systems.

Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 were $1,889,226, an increase
of 19% over revenues of $1,581,096 for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.
Net profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 was $213,260 or $.05 per
share compared with a net profit of $98,134 or $.02 per share for the quarter
ended September 30, 2005.

Revenues for the 12 months ended September 30, 2006 were $6,936,631, an
increase of 37% over revenues of $5,078,436 for the 12 months ended September
30, 2005. Net profit for the 12 months ended September 30, 2006 was $460,156 or
$0.10 per share compared with a net profit of $173,019 or $0.04 per share for
the 12 months ended September 30, 2005. The largest drivers for the 166%
profitability increase were revenue increases in both business units, having
Optometrics as part of Dynasil for the full year and gross margin increases for
optical materials.

On October 2, 2006, Dynasil Corporation acquired 100% of the stock of
Evaporated Metal Films Corporation ("EMF") in Ithaca, NY. EMF provides optical
thin-film coatings for a broad range of application markets including display
systems, optical instruments, satellite communications and lighting. EMF's
results will be included in Dynasil's results starting in the first quarter of
2007. EMF is expected to increase Dynasil revenues by 40-50% in 2007.

"We are pleased with the 37% revenue increase and 166% net income increase for
fiscal year 2006. Optometrics has had a major positive impact on Dynasil and we
continue to implement process improvements which have helped us deliver the
higher revenues and profitability." said Craig T. Dunham, President and CEO.
"The acquisition of EMF is an exciting step in the execution of our strategy of
profitable growth from our optical businesses and by pursuing strategic
acquisitions. EMF is a fit with our markets and customers and has strong people
and capabilities." added Mr. Dunham.
