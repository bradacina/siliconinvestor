Most cheap of the cheap stocks? That's actually difficult for me to answer.
Some stocks I've mentioned here that I am buying are so low compared to their
historical valuations that they just are statistically very cheap. (And they
could get cheaper yet -g-.) Whether one such stock is cheaper now than another
stock that also has a low price to its historical valuations, that is hard for
me to ascertain. Many of the stocks mentioned here by others and by me have
moved up, so I'd have to go through an entire list of stocks to rank them, and
that ranking could change tomorrow if there's another big stock
decline/volatile day.

I also have gtc buy orders for some thinly traded stocks which I've not
mentioned that I might otherwise want to include in such a list of my favorite
cheap stocks.

I don't see my answer or non-answer as being of much importance. My history of
enthusiasm for a stock, it being rated high as a favorite for me, or my any
observation I might have as to its great value compared to most anything else I
have --- well that's never been correlated with the subsequent performance of
the stock. As I say, I'm often surprised by which stocks in my portfolio do
well or do poorly.

I'm buying some stocks as themes. That would be, for example, Brazilian stocks
or Bakkan oil plays. For Ben Graham plays -- (late Ben Graham, where he
suggests buying a package of stocks with good basic metrics (e.g. book value)
that are attractive) -- there are just so many out there now with those
characteristics, that buying a diverse package of ten of any should (or could
or might) be okay.

Some buys today:
CSCO, decent valuation (PE 15) and strong competitive position

DNBK: thrift conversion trading below IPO price. This is full conversion. 17.8M
shares issues and received approx. 170M$+70M$ of equity (pre conversion). So we
have 240M$ equity for 17.8M shares or 13.5$/share. DBNK is currently trading at
9.6US$/share or a 29% discount to tangible book. DNBK decent size (1.3B$

Nicely timed on that TSO buy. Seems that the refiner trade is being put back on
with a vengeance. Was the short interest that high? Seems almost like panic
buying today. Odd seeing as VLO stated they saw weakness in gasoline demand (in
CA.) That's in the past though, and the market is finally looking forward to
spring maintenance/shutdowns along with the summer driving season....running at
86.5% capacity at the moment.

retail exposure? Or just put the trade back on across the board? Your value

TSO. Thanks. It's almost irrelevant though compared to my very big error in not
selling any shares when Mr. Kerkorian made his buyout offer and the stock got
over $64 a couple months ago (vs. about $41 now).

I don't know what the best idea is here. For me, I'm buying on low forward p/e.
And the refiners with the lowest p/e have retail exposure, so that's what I'm
buying. I already have a package of most of these refiners, I'm just adding
occasionally and in a taxable account, so I expect I will hold recently bought
shares for over 12 months.

Cheapest (on forward p/e) which I am following is now
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ALJ .
VLO, TSO, MRO slightly higher and all about the same. HES might turn out to be
a very good buy at current price based on its prospects with PBR in a section

Thanks for the info. On HES : Ken Heebner loaded up on this one after looking
at some geological map targets they had on their books. He thinks they have
some big pockets of oil.....plus he is wildly bullish on PBR...saying that it
could be comparable to a saudi field. He thinks PBR is undervalued 10 fold at
these levels going forward. Both of these picks are reflected in the CGMFX
fund.

** the massive run HES had during the fall was due to this wake up call for
Heebner as he then piled in.

** the Kerkorian greenmail was actually a blessing in disguise as it helped
flush out the remaining weak hands who sold on the poison pill. Now the stock
is "reloaded" and ready to run. Now if crude can bounce back up to $97 and
reverse that will put in the right shoulder of a HST. The neckline is at $87.
If that happens then we'll see that crack spread move back up to 25 again.

sell out in a NY minute. He can be a price seller: If PBR or HES or any other
of his stocks drop sharply (or rise too quickly), or if he senses weakness or
if he finds what he believes to be better stocks/ideas --- he will be 100% gone
instantly from PBR, HES, or anything else, regardless of what the prospects,
media enthusiasm, valuations of these companies (PBR/HES/etc) are.

I looked at the following:

ADS - I am not sure I want to own it if deal unravels and it probably will,
since it's a serious regulatory obstacle.

BCE - the stock is much higher than pre-offer. I don't particularly like the
debt. But overall, it does seem attractive. Positive quarterly results, lowish
P/E.

CCU - I bought some of this one. I think I would be OK to hold the common if
deal does not go through

COMS - stock at where it was pre-offer, but the company is continuously losing
money. I'll skip that one.

HAR - this one has already failed. IMO, it may be a buy at current price, but
it competes with a lot of other cheap stocks right now. I will put it on my
thinking list.

PENN - debt is pretty high for this one. I'll skip.

FRZ - too much debt and spotty earnings. I'll skip.

XMSR - losses, losses, losses. Do I sound like Cramer? :P Skip. :)

VTSI - no arbitrage margin.

Talking heads may say that the leveraged buyout binge was a bubble caused by
cheap credit, but so far I don't see any support for this view. Almost all of
these companies are legitimate buyout targets with pretty good businesses and
future prospects. And they were not bought for very high valuations. Actually,
whatever people say about the past bull market (2003-2007?), it really has not
awarded very rich valuations to US equities. It's quite normal that various
entities would want to buy out companies trading at pretty nice prices.

Although I will not argue with you about MBI ratings, I would suggest that
allowing MARKET - credit spread market or equity offering market - to determine
someone's ratings is foolish. If the market is in its depressive mood and
scared of everything, does that mean that BRKA should lose its AAA rating? It's
an extreme example, but IMO market ratings are as inprecise or even worse than

It's a trade, and our old friend, reversion to the mean play.
Plus, a couple of other things - if oil trends lower (I think it will, at least
in the short to moderately short term), that will obviously be good for the
airline sector. SWA has about 50% of its jet fuel hedged at a bit more than
$50/bbl for '08, to my knowledge. Not the almost fully hedged position of past
years, but still pretty good.
Plus, a couple of kick the tires things....I am a fairly frequent SWA traveler,
and the new boarding process is vastly more user friendly than the old one,
IMHO a big positive.
Plus, I saw CEO Gary Kelly on CNBC today, and my reaction to him and his
presentation was very favorable. He said bookings for the month of February
were actually pretty good, when questioned if the company was experiencing any
softening of demand.
I don't know this first hand, but I have heard from some source, which I can't
remember offhand, that SWA is trading below liquidation value, which provides a
margin of safety.
And, it's hard to argue that SWA is by far the most financially sound of all
the companies in its industry.

A recent article about LUV in Barrons:

AS SHARES OF Southwest Airlines try to take off from their lows, two insiders
at the company have sold $725,000 in the Dallas-based company's stock.

On Monday Chairman of the Board Herbert Kelleher sold 50,000 shares for
$604,500, an average of $12.09 a share. Kelleher, who has served as chairman
since 1978, continues to own three million shares directly, and 300,280 shares
indirectly through a family limited liability company.

Also on Monday President and director Colleen Barrett sold 10,000 shares for
$121,000 or $12.10 a share. Barrett continues to own 43,576 shares directly and
1,474 shares indirectly through the company's profit-sharing plan.

Neither owns more than 1% of the company's stock outstanding.

A spokesman for Southwest declined to comment on the sales other than to say
that they were due to routine diversification purposes.

"The selling isn't as bad as it looks from the headline," says Jonathan
Moreland, adviser to Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management on insider strategies.
"The chairman still owns a lot of shares and the president did have an options
exercise earlier in the month."

"However, given the decline the stock has seen, I'm surprised there isn't more
buying," Moreland says. "Yet this is a pattern you see at airlines over the
years: The stock goes down and instead of buying we see more selling,
[perpetuating] a negative insider profile. Add to that rising fuel costs,
cutthroat competition and a potential decrease in demand…and the macro aspects
of this industry have not been attractive."

Southwest dropped to a 52-week intraday low of $11.02 on Jan. 9, and aside from
a slight postearnings-report bounce, the stock has continued to hover around
that level. Shares slipped 16 cents to $11.72 on Thursday.

While most airlines were reporting fourth-quarter losses, on Jan. 23 Southwest
said income soared 95% to $11 million, or 15 cents a share, as fuel hedges
saved the company $300 million in the period. Analysts polled by Thomson
Financial had predicted the company would earn only 10 cents a share.

Yet the company's greatest advantage over rivals, its fuel hedges, won't last
forever. While 70% of Southwest's 2008 fuel costs are covered by options, by
2010 the company will only be able to buy 30% of its fuel for a discount. The
company has said it plans to offset fuel costs by a possible fare hike and a
reduction in the number of cheap tickets it sells.

Southwest, the leader in domestic airline traffic, hasn't reported a quarterly
loss since 1991. However Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly warned that the
company could dip into the red for the first quarter. An economic downturn is
also expected to hurt airline traffic; the International Air Transport
Association, an industry trade group, has already forecast that international
passenger and freight travel will slow in 2008.

Still analysts remain bullish on the company. Those surveyed by Thomson
Financial on average rated the company a Buy or the equivalent with a 12-month
target price of $14.96.

"The company is in a transitional year," says analyst FTN Midwest Securities
analyst Michael Derchin. "It is becoming a more balanced airline as it shifts
from being 100% focused on price-sensitive leisure travelers. Southwest has a
series of programs, such as in-flight Internet access, designed to attract new
business travelers to Southwest who will pay a premium for those services."

Derchin is unconcerned about the possible first-quarter loss and notes that
Southwest still has one of the best fuel-hedging programs in the industry.

Many investors are bullish on the airline sector in general, due to the
possibility for consolidation.

"I don't see Southwest being involved directly in any mergers until possibly
2009 or 2010," says Derchin. "However, they could benefit by getting slots in
gates at airports that larger airlines have to give up to get approval for
mergers. The continuous downsizing of domestic operations by larger airlines
will also help Southwest."

Derchin has a Buy rating on Southwest and a $20 target price

MXIM. For some companies - companies in a viable (growing) sector that seem big
enough and have resources enough - I'm willing to go with unaudited reporting,

Although I don't like that they go for over a year without producing an audited

That said, your reluctance to buy has been correct. My decision to buy (and
hold) in May and Aug. of '06 has been wrong. And may prove to be wrong again
too with today's buy.

A lot of MXIM's stock's performance has to do with the sector: the stocks of

From "MISH"this story the Erie City School District in Pennsylvania.

In an "offer too good to be true", and was, David DiCarlo, an Erie-based
JPMorgan Chase banker, talked Barker and the school district into a credit
default swap. The swap gave the school district an upfront $750,000 and a huge
nightmare down the road. Let's pick up the rest of the story from Bloomberg.

What New York-based JPMorgan Chase didn't tell them, the transcript shows, was
that the bank would get more in fees than the school district would get in
cash: $1 million. The complex deal, which placed taxpayer money at risk, was
linked to four variables involving interest rates. Three years later, as
interest rate benchmarks went the wrong way for the school district, the Erie
board paid $2.9 million to JPMorgan to get out of the deal, which officials now
say they didn't understand.

JPMorgan's Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon declined to say if he thought
the bank's fee disclosure was proper and whether the bank acted in a fair,
responsible and moral manner in Erie. Banker DiCarlo declined to comment.

My Comment: Declining to comment is a comment. Jamie Dimon has to know the fees
in question are not fair and that JPMorgan dot act in a "moral manner" to the
school districts. However, morals and legality are two different things. At the
heart of the issue will be a legal requirement to disclose fees. This will no
doubt be settled in court.

The Pennsylvania deals show that school districts routinely lose when making
derivative deals. They pay fees to banks that are as much as five times higher
than typical rates and overpay advisers by as much as 10-fold. That means banks
often underpay schools on upfront amounts, as JPMorgan Chase did in Erie,
public records show. And school officials aren't always well served by their
supposedly independent advisers, whose fees are paid by the banks selling the
deals -- only if the sale is made.

My Comment: This opens up still another legal attack. If the so called
independent advisers represented the brokerage houses and/or proper disclosures
were not made, both the brokerage houses and the independent advisers are going
to find themselves in court.

Christopher Cox, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, says
he's concerned that municipalities are taking on more risk than in the past
when they raised money primarily from bond sales.

"It's a serious issue, not only in Pennsylvania but across the country," says
Cox, 55, who has headed the SEC since 2005. "That is what we have seen
repeatedly. More often than not, the municipalities aren't configured to have
financial sophisticates in charge of these offerings -- and the result is that
the firms are the only ones who know what's going on."

The banks that arrange these deals create the swap contracts before pitching
them to schools. Using software programs designed for valuing swaps, they
calculate prices for which they can sell them after a school signs a contract.
That's how the banks make money. For example, if a bank agrees to pay a
district $800,000 in a deal it valued at $2 million, it could reap $1.2 million
for itself and middlemen.

"They load it off instantly," says Taylor, who's now on the advisory board of
Rockwater Municipal Advisors LLC, an Irvine, California-based investment firm.

Banks hedge their risk in derivative deals by making trades to cover possible
losses to school districts. The banks make their money from fees, regardless of
interest rate movements.

The reason Erie and other districts don't know how much the bank makes from a
deal is because banks don't tell them, the records show.

My Comment: These kinds of deals and the fees they generate are now dead in the
water. Regardless of the litigation outcome, such predatory practices will
stop. Together with collapsing leveraged buyouts (LBOs), and with commercial
real estate headed into the sewer, what's obvious is that profits at the
brokerage houses has peaked this cycle.

While the SEC doesn't regulate derivatives, it has authority to oversee how
banks conduct transactions. SEC Chairman Cox says all financial firms should
tell clients what their fees are before signing any deals.

"Brokers and advisers should disclose their compensation and conflicts of
interest to their customers, and to the extent that they are regulated by the
SEC, they must," he says.

Cox also says school district officials have a responsibility to the public and
to bond investors to ensure their advisers are actually independent and acting
in the best interests of taxpayers. "To the extent that municipalities are
participating in transactions they are not qualified for, there is an
obligation to get good independent advice," he says.

My Comment: What Cox seems to be saying is that both parties are at fault.
There is plenty of ground here for future litigation.

In many cases, the banks repeatedly sell more derivatives to replace old ones.
In Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley sold the school
district eight swaps on just two bond issues, records show.

"It sure looks a lot like churning," Yang [head of research at financial
advisory firm Andrew Kalotay Associates Inc.] says. Churning is a term used to
describe how stockbrokers or insurance agents sometimes continually sell and
resell the same or similar products to clients in order to make more in fees.
"Doing more than one swap against a single bond issuance definitely benefited
the swap adviser and bank, but probably not the school district."

Other Pennsylvania school districts are paying banks excessive fees. Bethlehem,
50 miles north of Philadelphia, is also a former steel-making center. With a
population of 72,000, the city has maintained its historic buildings.

So far, the [Bethlehem] district has taken in about $900,000 from the deals,
Bloomberg data show. That compares with $3 million in transaction fees.
Lestrange and Access made $630,000 each for arranging the swaps, according to
school district records. New York-based Morgan Stanley made $840,000 and
JPMorgan received fees totaling $900,000, Bloomberg data show.

Lestrange and Access earned a fee 10 times more than the Easton Area School
District, Bethlehem's neighbor, paid its adviser on a comparable interest-rate
swap in 2004.

The rates the banks charged Bethlehem were twice the average for comparable
swaps deals. In this kind of swap, in which both sides pay floating interest
rates, a bank calculates its fees by subtracting an amount from the rate it
will pay.

"It's obscene," says Peter Shapiro, managing director of South Orange, New
Jersey-based adviser Swap Financial Group, who doesn't advise Pennsylvania
school districts. "What is going on in Pennsylvania?"

Hornet's Nest Recap

* Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, and others clearly sold products not suitable for
retail customers to retail customers. However, these companies are likely to
maintain they did so in "good faith".
* Fees and risks were not properly disclosed. The issue of undisclosed fees may
prove to be extremely fertile ground for litigation.
* Inappropriate relationships by so called "independent advisers" will come
under legal scrutiny.
* There will be grounds for lawsuits for recommendations that amount to
"churning".
* A mammoth wave of lawsuits against Bear Stearns (BSC), Merrill Lync (MER),
Citigroup (C), Lehman (LEH), Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GC), JPMorgan
(JPM) and others is likely on the way.
* By agreeing to reimburse Springfield, Merrill Lynch may have inadvertently
opened the door for more litigation.

Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and other got caught up in their own CDO Ponzi schemes
once the pool of greater fools ran out. A hornet's nest of litigation is now on
the way. Legal bees will be buzzing over this for a long, long time.

Hi Paul - Looking out 18 months, I am concerned about stagflation especially
when the Fed begins to increase interest rates. What's your strategy for types
of value stocks that you would buy that will benefit from such an environment?

Here is one opinion for what to invest in during a stagflation environment.
http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/JubaksJournal/Is70sStyleStagflat
onComing.aspx

Jubak's conclusion is pretty much what we discussed.

* The oil drilling and services area, especially companies with big
international operations. Worldwide exploration and production spending is set
to rise 11% in 2008, according to Lehman Bros.' annual oil-industry
capital-spending survey. Take a look at Schlumberger (SLB, news, msgs),
Weatherford International (WFT, news, msgs) and FMC Technology (FTI, news,
msgs).

* Iron-ore and natural-gas stocks. Iron-ore demand is up, and supply hasn't
kept pace. Natural gas is still near a low, and the stocks are just starting to
move. Iron-ore plays include Fortescue Metals Group (FSUMF, news, msgs) and
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (RIO, news, msgs), both in Jubak's Picks.

* Jubak's Picks Kinross Gold (KGC, news, msgs) and GoldCorp (GG, news, msgs)
will give you good exposure to the classic hedge against rising inflation and a
falling dollar.

==============================================================

I am trying to develop a strategy for shifting my portfolio mix to preserve my
capital in a high inflation and low domestic growth environment (perhaps
several quarters of negative GDP growth).

As you recall in the late 70's the economy was burdened with loads of debt that
needed to be flushed out of the system. Beginning in 1980 Paul Volker increased
interest rates (during the Carter administration) that eventually resulted in
interest rates peaking at 18%. This restored credibility to the dollar, choked
off inflation, and threw the economy into a vicious recession.

I am not sure if this time around it is going to play out the same way, but
when interest rates get so low, that when you add back "real" inflation
(including energy & housing) you actually achieve a "negative" return on your
capital parked in a money market fund. We will be in this position with another
rate cut by the Fed! This raises a red flag to me. The loss in purchasing power
is further magnified when the dollar continues to fall in value compared to
other global currencies.

At some point the Fed must begin to raise rates which will throw our economy
into a protracted recession (12 to 18 months out).

One of my best investments in the 80"s was to purchase a significant amount of
zero coupon bonds when interest rates peaked at 18%. I structured a zero coupon
bond ladder with over 50% of my portfolio which did quite well during this
period. I do not think this strategy will work this time around and believe a
portfolio of natural resource and foreign growth stocks might be the best place
to invest to maintain purchasing power.

Have you given such a scenario some thought?

Erie & school districts: Perhaps this is what happens when you have
administrators responsible for defined-benefit plans who assume taxpayers will
pick up any eventual shortfalls caused by the incompetence or
kick-back-receiving administrators who bought these vehicles. If teachers were
placed on defined-contribution plans (where they then would make their own
investment choices from a menu) like most taxpayers, this derivative problem
might not be a serious community problem.

(I assume the problem is primarily with funds in retirement system. If it's
something else, say bonds for school buildings and/or maintenance that are
being swapped/traded, those funds ought to be either spent or held
conservatively, not twiddled to get the most yield. Imo.)

Going into a stagflation and enduring it: For me, there'd be no hiding, no
avoiding the pain of it. Based on my prior experience with the last one.

Yes, I've got those oil service stocks and mining stocks. And yes, maybe the
business will do okay, even show increasing profits. But these stocks like any
in the market, will drop from current levels. (As people exit the stock market;
as bonds become more attractive; as fud expands; as stagflation becomes more
apparent and as it drags on and on)

I've got some short-term floating-rate bonds. Those would help somebody who
bought them within the stagflation. But buying them now, as interest rates come
down as Fed eases, means a buyer now risks the bonds' values declining (i.e.
taking a maybe temporary capital loss). With high interest rates, after Fed
tightens, they might work (and perform better than stocks in a high interest
environment.) Won't really help me though, since I am broadly diversified in
stocks, and in a stagflation the p/e's will all come down (for those companies
that still will have profits).

Maybe the best alternative is to sell now and keep lots of money in short term
debt instruments. They'll pay below inflation rate, so there's a small loss in
purchasing power. Better that though for some people, than the risk they might
take of large losses in holding fixed income or stocks.

For now I am holding on and trying to hold and buy what look to be undervalued
companies. (The risk being they even if they are undervalued, they'll get more
so - and will stay there - in a stagflation environment.

RF Micro Devices makes chips for cell phones. It's weathering a downturn in MOT

RFMD experienced reduced demand late in the December quarter from customers in
Asia and from its high concentration of top-tier customers that utilize
inventory hubs. Additionally, RFMD experienced demand softness in the
infrastructure and broadband/consumer markets. As a result, RFMD currently
expects combined company earnings per share on a GAAP basis to be approximately
$(0.04) to $(0.05) per share and non-GAAP earnings per share to be
approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share, which excludes share-based compensation
expense, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, start-up
costs and purchase price accounting adjustments.

RFMD believes the reduction in demand is temporary and anticipates a return to
growth in fiscal year 2009, which begins April 1, 2008. In the March 2008
quarter, RFMD currently expects revenues for its Cellular Handset Products
Group (CPG) to be down quarter-over-quarter, offset partially by its
Multi-Market Products Group (MPG), which is expected to be flat to up.

Bob Bruggeworth, president and CEO of RFMD, said, "RFMD entered the December
2007 quarter prepared to meet strong customer backlog that subsequently
weakened late in the quarter. Despite the demand weakness, we made progress on
several fronts to improve our financial performance, and we continue to expect
strong year-over-year growth in fiscal 2009.

that do not need a lot of Capex, the reason being that Capex intensive

This is strange because competitor AVIS recently issued an upbeat report for

These two companies don't exactly cater to the same customers, but the business
is competitive enough from what I see at airports that there shouldn't be such
a disparity between earnings issues. What DTG says-- they "cited weaker
industry demand in the travel market, excess fleet capacity in the industry,
and a weakening used car market for its more bearish outlook", that should hold
true for AVIS also.

CMG, PNRA - Both are highly shorted names (especially CMG). Also Fidelity is a
large holder and probably not selling. Hard to knock these stock down until the
major institutions begin to sell. Just my opinion.

Purchased SWCEY, RYCEY, AIG ( adds) and a starter in GE in addition to SNY,
CHKP mentioned earlier today.

I was lucky to have sold out of ACAS GW, VTV and reduced positions in EXPGY,
SSUMY, AEO and JWN earlier so plenty of cash is available.

It sure looks like a repeat of the late January panic market is pending.

Trying to predict short-term gyrations of market is a waste of time. Nobody got

Some very good opportunities out there now (imo) for someone who is willing to
buy and to not panic or stop themselves out of positions.
--------------

I have open orders all over the place for several stocks if they will drop a
little more no adverse news.

One stock I'm considering dumping is MSFT.

I'm not following the Yahoo deal closely. From what I see though and what
little I understand, I don't see how MSFT stockholders benefit. MSFT's cash
cushion goes away (which makes the stock less of a value proposition), and
Yahoo doesn't to me seem like such a great growth story anyway, especially
given its very high p/e already.

If one assumes the deal goes through, then arbs may be shorting MSFT and buying
YHOO. So downward pressure on MSFT stock will continue. If one believes the
deal won't be completed, then MSFT might rise if there are enough MSFT holders
relieved that buying YHOO was a mistake (and shorts cover).

Anyone else here following MSFT with an opinion to offer?

Paul, there is almost always pressure on a stock that is buying out another
stock. GOOG is down because of the Yahoo deal. They are estimating that
advertising will double over the next 5 years. Yahoo I believe has about 19% of
the market v/s GOOG 66%. The reason GOOG is down around 500 is because of the
threat that Microsoft has the money to push this and take away from GOOG
percentage. GOOG is down about $100 over this. I'm long on GOOG at $519. I'm
sure it will come back to the $570-$590 in the near future. If Microsoft gets
away with this who knows what they may be able to do with their operating
systems and softwares. I know GOOG is trying to get ATT to take a look at this
Yahoo deal for one. GOOG isn't afraid of competition unless it's Microsoft. It
could take awhile for the stock price for Microsoft to see the effects on the
price. Their isn'that much of a decrease in price since the announcement. These
are my opinions on what I've read. Good Luck with your decision................

I am following MSFT. I almost bought it the day before the deal was announced.
Lucky break. ;)

I am very conflicted about the deal.

From one point of view, MSFT would get some very valuable properties: Yahoo
portal is still one of the top Internet sites, I am (and a lot of other people
too I guess) still using Yahoo Finance and Mail, Flickr is a top property (that
I hate, but a lot of people love), Yahoo Asian connections/stakes are
apparently highly valued.

On the other hand, I am not sure how much of these properties would be
destroyed by MSFT ownership. There is no point for MSFT to have two email
platforms, so Yahoo mail has to go or get converted into MSN/Hotmail. Portal
may or may not stay depending on politics. Finance - same. Flickr is the only
one guaranteed to stay if MSFT is not totally idiotic. I don't know much about
the Yahoo "back end" solutions, such as ad sales platform and such and how much
they are valuable and whether they will stay or get canned.

So, IMHO, MSFT gets quite a bit, but the price tag is very high too. My bet is
that they are overpaying. Still that does not answer the question if MSFT stock
is a good value or not. Unfortunately, valuing MSFT recently was a tough
exercise anyway IMO. It seemed undervalued, but market is totally set against
Mr Softie and perhaps they are somewhat right. On the other hand, this MAY be
the historic opportunity to buy MSFT cheap. I missed such opportunities with
ADBE and ORCL and look where they are now... So I think I will hold my tiny
MSFT position and not do anything... Unless the stock falls to $25 or
something.

Nice number grab BTW. ;)

Art Baeckel, Jurgis Bekepuris, re. MSFT. Thanks for opinions.

I decided to cut MSFT to a stub holding (which I've done now).

GOOG looks to me like the better bet. I often use a simple model of valuing
stocks, and GOOG still fits as a "value" for me based on its high profit
margins. At current price, I'll up my few shares a little. (Done today as
well.) (GOOG discussed here in '06)

MSFT fits my model as well. However, at some point when I have neither gains
nor losses (accounting for the time value of money), after a number of years I
just figure time to move on. I can sometimes live with the stock not moving if
the intrinsic value increases, but with MFST's eliminating its cash hoard to
buy YHOO, I don't see the basic value of MSFT being enhanced.

Paul, AAPL dropped to $122 at the close. Seems like a bargain to me. I bought
another 100 shares at the close. IMO

Hi Paul - I added another 1/3 to Companhia Paranaense de Energia (ELP) by
selling a few March $15 naked Puts. My strategy is to have the stock Put to me
in March if the stock closes below $15/share. The stock pays an annual dividend
in April which should be between $0.40 - $0.60 per share. As you know I am
bullish long term on ELP. This strategy allows me to reduce my current cost
basis and/or add to my position and collect the annual dividend.

====================================================

For a few of my larger positions I am employing a modified "strangle" option
strategy to take advantage of the recent market volatility. The strategy is to
write twice the number of out of the money covered calls than out of the money
naked Puts for a settlement date three to six months out. The strike prices are
banded at 15% to 20% above and below the current stock price.

When the options mature I am either forced to sell or buy shares of my hedged
position if the stock price exceeds the banded strike price range (ie +/-
20%... sell if above or buy if below). If the stock price stays w/i this banded
area, the options expire worthless and I collect the option premium. During
this time, you also collect any dividends paid by the company.

It may sound like a complicated strategy but it really is not. It is very
difficult to trade these large swings and be correct both on the Buy and the
Sell. This way I can lock in my long term gain and even buy more if there is a
net 20% decline w/o having to time the market. I have been implementing this
strategy on stocks that I feel are fairly valued at current levels but would
buy more if the stocks trades 20% lower in price.

Finally, using such a strategy you can trade around your position during the
option period (covering Puts on rallies, covering the Calls on dips or adding
or selling new shares). I have put strangles on both NYB and SFL that are good
dividend contributors to my taxable portfolio.

AAPL. Based on my model, it's a value stock at current price. This assumes
though that profit margins continue as good as they are currently.

I have a few shares, and will consider adding a few more.
