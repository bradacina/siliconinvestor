<My guess is that they will issue new NS shares to the amount of 200M$ soon and
NSH will get a free ride on the cash flow generated with expansions project
that get paid from the capital raised. >

It's not that simple as this is not something new. NS has been issuing new
shares for years and they announced in their recent conference call that they
plan to do so in 2012 to the tune of $350 million, stepping up to fund
expansion. Distribution growth from this expansion would be realized in 2013.
Expenses for the growth, $300m annually to expand its crude storage and
transportation operations will continue to lower distributable cash flow,
although NS forecasts a modest increase for 2012.

Also from the conference call, NS plans to go on a buying spree as larger oil
and gas companies strip themselves of pipeline and terminal assets. This would
lower their growth expenses if they are able to continue buying from chapter 11
bankruptcy as they did earlier this year.

>>Expenses for the growth, $300m annually to expand its crude storage and

Huuh? if they build new storage facilties and pipelines, they will generate
more cash flow. Granted they need to make sure that the new Capex earns enough
cash flow to cover the distributions for the new NS units that are issued to
finance them but at 4-6x EBITDA multiples that should not be a problem for
organic growth projects. For outright buy of new facilities that may be
different because most fee based pipelines can fetch EBITDA multiples far above
10x, which makes it tough to be accreditive, given NS high cost of capital (due
to low valuation).

However that is more of a concern for NS than it is for NSH. Growth is almost
always good for the GP, even though it may not be for the limited partner. The
GP get's a free ride on the cash flow from expansion (as long as the wheel come
off and distributions get cut due to credit downgrades etc.), while the limited
partner has to pay for it in new units.

FWIW Seekingalpha has a good CC transcript from a recent analyst meeting.

Re: MDU Resources Group Inc. (MDU)

(Note: Lots of posts on MDU on this thread. Just search "MDU" w/ the SI search
tool.)

I researched the company enough to know that I like the company for the assets
they own especially two of their operating divisions: (1) Exploration &
Production and (2) Regulated - Electric and Natural Gas Distribution; -
Pipeline and Energy Services.

MDU also operates a Construction division which I have not followed and would
rather they just sell it and focus on their other two divisions mentioned
above.

They own some really good Oil & NG assets in their Fidelity Exploration &
Production Company.

In June 2011, MDU announced more Bakken leaseholds which further expands their
exploration footprint in the Bakken shale fields.

<u>Announces Bakken Leaseholds Acquisition - 6/27/2011 Bismarck, ND</u>
http://www.mdu.com/News/Pages/NewsArticle.aspx?article=284

Their Regulated Divisions basically provides them "utility" pricing (for their
two operating divisions) allowing
them steady growing FCF to fund their growth and E&P operation. They have two
Regulated Operating Divisions:

Both operate in the "sweet spot" for delivering their growing NG services.
Their footprint for their pipe lines is located in the heart of the Bakken &
Williston Basin shale fields. They own NG gathering assets through their Bitter
Creek Energy Services company.

From their 2010 Annual Report:: MDU owns some of the largest underground NG
storage assets in the U.S...

For example <u>their Williston Basin’s underground natural gas storage
facilities have a certificated storage capacity of approximately 353 Bcf,
including 193 Bcf of working gas capacity, 85 Bcf of cushion gas and 75 Bcf of
native gas. Williston Basin’s storage facilities enable its customers to
purchase natural gas at more uniform daily volumes throughout the year and meet
winter peak requirements.</u>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------

MDU is a great company that fits my NG theme to a tee. It's just hard to value
their assets because they have some limitations operating in a regulated
environment. I think what they have is a good mix of synergistic operating
businesses that provides for excellent growth over time. I would not split the
company up but rather continue to expand all their NG related services. They
own a small operating company called Total Corrosion Solutions (
http://www.totalcorrosion.com/Pages/default.aspx ) that is developing corrosion
prevention solutions (& testing) critical in building "safe" NG pipeline
systems. Perhaps their construction division can be morphed into a specialized
NG pipeline construction company. There are a lot options they can explore in
developing their specific NG infrastructure services.

==============================================================

Here is a listing of the TOP NG Utilities that I have been using to identify
investment target over the last 18 months, Both AGL and MDU are my largest
holdings. I should really work on loading up on more of these companies but you
have to focus on VALUE Buys. Many of these are excellent companies but no long
VALUE Buys.

Chinese Airlines: I'm not a fan of Ken Fisher. I can't understand his valuation
methodology or his buy/sell activity. I suspect he makes most of his money from
his large money management business, roping in customers from his many media
appearances and books. I do read him though for the many eclectic stocks he
writes about, especially non-USA stocks.

In a Forbes last week, there's an article touting "Ken Fisher's six stock

China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines are two. Looking at these
two, that led me to look at Cathay Pacific. I like the thesis that air travel
among Chinese will increase, and that could mean more growth and profits for
Chinese airlines. As I've mentioned before I'm interested in tapping into the
growth of the Chinese middle/upper class. It may be that Cathay is better
positioned and more focused for the international Chinese business traveler,
vs. the air traveler within China

"Cathay Pacific Airways is proud to have won two coveted titles at the 2011
Business Traveller China Awards held in Beijing on 2 November 2011. The airline
received the “Best Asian Airline Serving China” title for the second
consecutive year and also picked up the “Best Airline First Class” honour."

I can't discern if CPCAY.pk (Cathay) is a better value than the other
publicly-held Chinese airlines. It looks reasonably low-priced to me with a p/e
of 5, and I'm more comfortable with Cathay's longer good history.
I'm in for a few shares now.

CPCAY my only airline stock now: I'm out of both my fav's,ALGT & ALK, which
continue to do well (stock price rise continues). UAL, I decided to exit for

re NS, NSH
>>would you say that the current dividend is safe for the next decade and is

A decade is a long time. I think a distribution cut is only possible if Asphalt
refining margins go from bad to worse (Asphalt is ~20% of their cash flow) or
current expansion project's don't pan out or something else happens that I
can't foresee (rapidly rising interest rates).

I believe the most likely scenario is slowly (<5%/annually) rising
distributions for NS and more rapidiy (5-10%) rising distributions for NSH. NSH
clearly carries higher risk but also has a higher reward. I think there is also
a significant chance that NS and NSH are going to be combined at some point
(Similar to what happened at Magellan or EPD/EPE), which probably results in
windfall for NSH.

Speaking for myself, I hold this view:

The universe of "high quality large caps" is small. The universe of small caps
is far larger.

There seems to me always to be many more opportunities to buy cheap small caps
than there are opportunities to buy cheap or cheaper-than-usual "high quality
large caps".

What makes "high quality large caps" get cheap? A missed earnings report. A
brokerage downgrade. An unforeseen event - building destroyed, government
investigation, legal assault, weather issue. These things though are, imo,
generally viewed as temporary -- after all we're talking about the big and
strong companies --- "high quality large caps". What makes these stocks get
<u>really</u> cheap? Fear. Market panic. The entire market dropping.

Therefore it's my opinion cheap small caps can usually be found and bought. But
to be have an opportunity to buy from among a number of "high quality large
caps" when this latter universe is really cheap --- that is unusual. And to be
taken advantage of by investors, esp. those who are Buffett moat-seeking types.

That is what you are seeing here from some posters. "High quality large caps"
seldom mentioned as value buys, recently now being reported as being purchases.

Martin Midstream Partners LP (MMLP)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=MMLP+Key+Statistics

The Sulfur Services segment processes and distributes sulfur produced by oil
refineries that is used in the production of fertilizers and industrial
chemicals. This segment own and operates six sulfur-based fertilizer production
plants, and one emulsified sulfur blending plant that manufacture sulfur-based
fertilizer products for wholesale distributors and industrial users; and one
sulfuric acid production plant that processes molten sulfur into sulfuric acid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was hoping that the company fit my other "Value" criteria as I like all their
businesses but their PE is still too high at 20. They carry about 2x more LT
debt than I would like based on their annual net income. I will have to go
through their last annual report to see if there might be some hidden
undervalued assets.

It's really interesting that they can take the by product (ie sulfur) of their
energy processing and create a valuable fertilizer input used in AG. Depending
on their production facilities that may be a possible growth area to expand
into (especially nitrogen derived from NG) when all that shale NG is piped
through to Texas ports. If that type of expansion is in the cards, paying a 20
PE now might be worth it especially when 50% margins are obtained selling the
high valued fertilizers.

It's interesting how they produce sulfuric acid (can be quite dangerous). The
molten sulfur is used in a lot of industrial production processes. Food
processing plants also use different types of sulfur based products too.

I will add it to my AG watch list and in the mean time look at their annual
report. Thank's for the lead.

bought XLS @10.45$ - the defense part of ITT (after the spinoff). My rough
notes say earnings/share (pro forma) around 1.6-1.7$/share, EV/EBITDA <5x
including pension obligations. Dividend/share >0.4$. ITT's last earnings report
showed better than expected results and order flow for the defense business.

The defense stub obviously get's sold out from a lot of ITT shareholders, at
least that is my take. While I don't like the prospects of defense too much, I
think XLS is severely mispriced. First of all the valuation is below even the
cheap prime contractors like NOG, LMT and LLL and second their prospects are
better than average, due to focus on smaller programs that provide fairly good
bang for the buck (infrared optics, upgrade programs) and ot field like Drones
and cyber warfare.

I also think that there is a good chance that they get taken out in the longer
run after the 2 years period after the spinoff is expired (which make a merger
more tax efficient).

Hi Ditchdigger-

Re: Martin Midstream Partners LP (MMLP)

The company recently acquired the NG gathering assets from Prism Gas (
http://www.ogj.com/articles/2011/10/martin-midstream-says-east-texas-plants-exp
nsion-complete.html ). The acquisition provides access to the Haynesville Shale
fields a huge NG growth area.

Here is a blog that describes the new wells in the Haynesville shale fields.
Martin Midstream will benefit from the volume of gas processed from many of
these new wells. Their NG gathering plant will process this NG and should see
volumes processed increase over the next several years.

http://www.haynesvilleplay.com/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

Reviewing the 2010 Annual Report (
http://martinmidstream.com/lib/docs/MMLP_2010_Form_10K.pdf ) discloses that
their sulfur division represents only 18% of their revenues but contributes 40%
of their operating income (and 50% after eliminations pg-64- of 2010 annual
report). It's a very profitable business! In fact the company increased their
investment in the sulfur division by 400% in 2000 expanding the capacity at
their Stockton CA plant by 300 % and expanding their Tampa FL facility too.
Therefore, the company recognizes the profitability of this business and has
invested in plant and equipment to increase the company's overall exposure in
suffer production.

In February 2011, the company issued more MLP units selling at $38.00/unit
(raising over $300M) but still have limited capital to expand after
restructuring their credit facility. Monies have been allocated to buying PRISM
GAS which is a really good allocation of new capital.

The bottom line is that the company is hitting the upper end of their credit
facilities and may need to raise more cash. This could put pressure on the
stock price which is selling 12% lower from their earlier unit offering.

I really like their AG fertilizer division that produce ammonia nitrate and
dried surfer pellets which is exported out of their Stockton CA plant by ship
from the port as well as by port from their Tampa Fl plant.

This one is an interesting play on NG shale gathering & processing from the
very productive Haynesville shale fields in Texas and their fertilizer
production assets located in Stockton CA and Tampa FL. The MLP still carries
too much debt but if another round of unit sales is done to reduce their debt
(ie $$100M or more), it would be a good buy.

I found no hidden assets that might be undervalued other than some of their
land assets for their surfer plants were bought in the late 90's and could be
valued at 2x their original cost if priced at the current market value. There
is still a huge potential liability w/ their molten surfer processing plant(s)
as this material is processed and transported at very high temperatures (over
212 degrees).

For me I would start a small tracking position below $30.00/share. I have this
one on my watch list and would sell some of my MLP LINE shares to move into
MMLP.

Upped my small position by 30%. Company a little soft on earnings out this AM
but still trading at 8.5 PE. They still need to finish integrating their recent
fish oil processing plant acquisition before they gain the efficiencies.
Eventually this will translate into higher margins on their fish oil products
and should result in larger *forward) profits from this division.

Will explore selling some of my higher priced shares in 31 days and/or hold
till next reporting period. Stock fairly valued around $12.00/share if earnings
do not grow. Higher if they can establish a steady growth path.

re XLS
I estimated the 1.6-1.7$ earnings based on pre-spinoff earnings from the
ITTdefense operation. Some yahoo posters seem to come up with similar numbers.
There is some uncertainty as far as overhead is concerned and of course how the
business develops. With respect to XLS - look at it this way ITT pre spinoff
was 44$ and you received one share of XLS, one share of XYL (water) and 1/2
share of new ITT (industrial stub).

Defense (XLS) was almost 50% of the old ITT's revenues and now trades for a
sole 20% of pre-spinoffs shareprice. There are some hairs ( some debt went to
XLS and also most of the pension obligations, since I assume they are
associated with the defense business) but still this is very very cheap, unless
you believe the wheels are totally coming off from defense. Based on their last
quarter, earnings in defense where down but better than expected and order flow
was better than expected too. All, imo of course...

Hi Sergio -

Corn Products International Inc. (CPO)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=CPO+Key+Statistics

CPO mentioned today on Bloomberg radio this AM, They do the milling and
processing for their customers and are not too impacted by the commodity price
of corn. They still have a bit too much debt for me (like to see them reduced
their LT debt by $350M). PE is ok at 10 but it would be more in line with the
other AG companies at 7PE.

They produce a lot of corn syrup products (which is probably not that healthy)
but own the milling assets. The company is also impacted by the current ethanol
subsidies that tends to disrupts the true cost of corn which generally impacts
the volume of corn milled (inefficient subsidies have corn sold for ethanol
production rather than for food products).

Eventually, I see all these U.S. subsidies coming to an end which will allow
more corn to be milled (less to be turned into ethanol) increasing overall
plant volumes providing higher company revenues from processed corn.

I would see a "Value" entry point around $35.00/share. On any big sell off this
one could be had at that price or even lower. The PE would be around 7 and the
dividend yield around 2%.

I have added this one to my AG watch list. The one problem is there will be a
lot of other excellent value buys if prices fall across the board 25%.
Therefore, the key is to stay firm with your valuation metrics and do not reach
(on price).

Gorilla Glass, the Dreamliner and America’s best-kept economic secret

http://blogs.marketwatch.com/great-columnist/2011/11/07/gorilla-glass-the-dream
ine-and-americas-best-kept-economic-secret/

From the article:"...Phones have come a long way since 1876. Gorilla Glass, the
thin, lightweight glass that resists scratches and damage and is produced by
Corning (symbol: GLW) for use in smartphones, has a popular allure. The
attention comes not from the technology of photovoltaic glass, but from the
discussion of its use in Apple’s iPhone (Apple does not disclose the identity
of many suppliers). But more interestingly, perhaps, is the story about
<u>potential application of Gorilla Glass technology in generating solar power.
</u> Last year, Apple was granted the first ever patent for solar powered
portable devices. The elimination of the need for different phone chargers
would no doubt be a game-changer. But imagine a house with a roof comprised of
glass sheets less that 1mm thick that can withstand hurricane-force winds and
severe hail, and collect enough energy to run the entire home! <u>These Corning
panels are currently in testing...</u><u>.</u>"

As I see it, revenues are up, balance sheet has expanded. leverage is way up

Interesting enough, another value stock mentioned here NAM.AX which deals with

I think you are generalizing too much and also expecting a general answer. In
reality, things are much more varied. :)

Some "quality" companies do outperform in rebound (usually the bigger growth
ones like maybe GOOG, MA or similar). Some do not (maybe more stable ones like
JNJ or similar that also did not go down much).

Some "low quality" outperform in rebound... if they survive. ;) Some don't
survive. It also depends on what kind of downturn we have and how it affects
different fields or companies.

Also on the value investors side some shift money into quality, some just move
cash into stocks, some actually move money from stocks into cash, some buy "so
so quality" companies that they expect to outperform.

For example, in 2009 downturn, I bought Chinese RTOs (low quality as we know
now) that outperformed for a while, BRKB which did not perform very well, E&Ps
(so so quality) that outperformed, KO/UL (high quality) that performed fine,
but not super-great and so on.

So IMHO you can't generalize. ;)

Noble CEO Quits After First Loss in 14 Years
By Yuriy Humber - Nov 9, 2011 5:11 PM PT

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-09/noble-ceo-leiman-resigns-after-commodi
y-supplier-s-first-loss-in-14-years.html
From the article:"...The loss and Leiman’s resignation follow a drop in global
commodities demand since June on concern that Greece and other euro-zone
members may default on debt and China’s economic growth has slowed. Noble had
reported four straight quarters of year-on-year earnings increases before
yesterday.

“We’re disappointed with the performance, but we believe it is transitory in
nature,” Leiman, 45, said on a conference call before the resignation was
announced. <u>The loss was based on “unrealized mark-to-market losses” created
in “very volatile market conditions,”</u> he said...." .

<snip>

"..<u>.jump in cotton prices in the first half of the year, followed by a
recent drop, led farmers to default on contracts, especially in the U.S., Noble
said in the statement. Noble had to honor its obligations to cotton buyers by
purchasing in the spot market, which eroded profit margins, </u>the company
said.

Earnings were also hurt by Europe’s Certified Emission Reductions, or carbon
credits, dropping in price to as low as 6.35 euros on Nov. 3 from 13.70 euros
on March 16. Noble’s remaining risk of losses on carbon credits is “very
small,” Leiman said...."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It looks like the total gross loss (based on last years reported earnings) from
this "cotton" event was somewhere around $170M. They ended up booking a $17M
loss for the quarter.

I am not too sure how you hedge against this w/o going too long (or short) w/
future commodity contracts. The company is already very leveraged w/ debt and
to be leveraging commodity future contracts can run you into BK very fast.

Several of my Brazil commodity AG plays booked currency losses again because of
the recent recovery of the U.S. dollar. I expect some of my Canadian companies
to experience this too as they spend their strong $CAN's to buy foreign assets
w/ their LT debt denominated in $US. This is a formula for disaster if/when the
$US rises. All of a sudden that LT debit (in $US) becomes more expensive to pay
off.

Fortunately that was not the case (yet) for NOBEL. From what I can tell they
own very little $US denominated LT debt which could blow up from a rising $US.

Gerdau S.A. Announces 3rd Quarter Earnings Results
Published: Thursday, Nov. 10, 2011
http://www.sacbee.com/2011/11/10/4044267/gerdau-sa-announces-3rd-quarter.html

From the article:"...3rd quarter of 2011 Highlights

Shipments reached 4.8 million tonnes in the 3Q11, 10% higher than in the 3Q10,
due to the higher demand in practically all operations in which Gerdau runs.

Net Sales reached R$ 9.0 billion in the 3Q11, 9% more than 3Q10, due to the
higher shipments in all operations.

3Q11 EBITDA reached R$ 1.2 billion, compared to R$ 1.3 billion in the 3Q10.
<u>The EBITDA margin was 14% in the 3Q11.</u>

Net Income was R$ 713 million in the 3Q11, higher than R$ 609 million recorded
in the 3Q10 and R$ 503 million in the 2Q11.

Investments in fixed assets totaled R$ 616 million in the 3Q11 and totaled R$
1,3 billion in the 9 months of 2011....".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The company beat analysts estimates and showed a 17% gain in profits. Not sure
if the Brazilian REAL had any impact on their earnings. I will hold my small
position. I still think the stock is undervalued and could return to it's
historical mean price of $14.00/share. They continue to invest in more fixed
assets (hopefully making them more efficient that leads to higher margins).
Margins are off their lows and now trending higher.

Hi Rainmaker,

When the stock price of a quality company drops, there must be some issues,
either with the company itself or with the overall market/economy. The issues
usually are short-term. Institutional investors have tremendous institutional
imperative and pressure to perform well in short-term. So they quit.

The Street looks at the next 2 quarters. When I look at stable cashflow, I
think the last 10 years. This is the Graham/Buffett tradition.

Actually, I'll be betting on that nicety of private jets. I've started to
accumulate shares of business jet manufacturers GD and TXT, and have open
orders to buy more if/as these two stocks drop.

If you don't read Barron's, you may have missed last month's interview with
defense and aerospace analyst Heidi Wood who got my attention with this:

"We have had this abnormality in the global dispersion of business jets. There
are some 10,000 business jets in the U.S. But there are under 400 in all of
Asia Pacific. Do you believe that business-jet density is correct? We are
witnessing a migration of wealth from the Western world to the Eastern world.
As emerging markets grow, we are going to see business-jet sales change as
well. As you move up the wealth curve, the new premium becomes time, and not
money. That is the one thing humans can never buy enough of, whether you are
the world's most powerful or wealthiest person."

To me it's inevitable that Asian business jet market will eventually increase.
I like betting on the inevitable, especially if it's a couple or more years
away, and no one seems to care about it now. I've found the inevitable in the
stock market once in a while actually turns out to be inevitable.

I'm figuring I'll see the full results in these stocks within 3-5 years. No

Re: Marine Harvest ASA (MNHVF.PK)

Not too happy with the investment either as I am underwater by more than 50%

product at a loss just to gain market share. What ever happened to sustained
farming similar to what is done in the forestry business.

FWIW their glut is also impacting my other fish producers, specifically Omega
Protein Corp. (OME). All the extra salmon fish oil is impacting the price that
OME gets for their (Cod) omega 3 fish oil.

Perhaps one who invests in any type of AG commodity should expect the "boom"

Our dealerships keep a boat in Valdez Alaska -we take our key employees up

years.

I fish it hard and often come in with more than the charters do.

Up there fisherman drive trucks with bumper stickers that say "Friends don't
let friends eat farm raide fish".

In Wisconsin a neighbor accross the road decided to raise Deer in a high raised
fence operations so fat bankers from Milwaukee can shoot a big buck and write a
check - a despicable form of hunting - if even that.Over 20 years of this the
farm become the states highest infected farm with Chronic Waste Desease.The
state has now double fenced the property and bought it 465,000 so studies on
how toxic these disease spores are.It has completely eliminated my desire to
hunt deer on that property.

Man should leave wild beasts to the wilderness.If they are expensive - let it

Sergio you have an idea of the impact of the Cottage Cheese Revolt on WILC?

Thank you,
MC

I like the car dealership stocks, as I've mentioned many times. Very good
businesses.
Little too expensive for me now for buys. I still hold Penske (PAG) and stub of
Group 1 Automotive (GPI) though. Also holding auto financing companies such as
CACC.

Fwiw, as for auto manufacturers, I continue to add to Toyota (TM) as the stock
falls.

ENZN. Well sometimes following the big value players doesn't work--- for me
anyway.

Icahn, Michael Price, and "margin of safety" Klarman -- they're too tough for
me with regards to ENZN.

In at $11.12, I'll take the loss now and exit at $6.63. I can't find a reason
to continue to hold it, other than these gentlemen apparently still are in and
see something that I don't.

Hi MC. The Israeli govt. lowered import barriers on dairy products, so that is
a positive for WILC but general conditions in Israel are Occupy Wall Street
gone hyper.

I had not noticed before but Jim Simon's Renaissance Technologies fund has an
interest in WILC. This is a highly successful hedge fund management firm.

As a consumer i dont think salmon prices are much cheaper than they used to be
farmed salmon is still considerably cheaper than wild salmon where i live. also
wild salmon is considered more healthy and desirable. im thinkiing there a glut
because the farmed salmon is still more pricy than halibut or cod so i almost
never buy it. either going for one of those two or wild salmon. I dont usually
have salmon in the restaurant either as i prefer to have my fish at home where
i can take it out as soon as i cook it and it doesnt stand around getting
overcooked while the waitstaff take care of other tables.

MHG EKS that article is a little scary but a lot of "may" and "could" baked in.
I'm underwater too but ... ‘Break Even’Prices are likely to stay low the rest
of 2011 and 2012 as global supply is expected to rise 250,000 metric tons in
the next 18 months, according to Nordea Markets, which sees prices at 31 kroner
per kilogram this year and an average of 24 kroner for next year.

At that level prices “should be enough for Marine Harvest to break even,” said
Dag Sletmo, an analyst at Oslo investment bank ABG Sundal Collier. Any lower
will “raise fears of financial distress,” he said.

“2012 seems challenging and supply for the next 1 1/2 years is already swimming
in the sea,” Sletmo said.

Demand for salmon will rise once the decline in spot prices trickles through to
consumer markets, Marine Harvest Chief Executive Officer Alf-Helge Aarskog said
in an interview in Santiago Nov. 9. “There is a time lag there,” he said.

Dead money, maybe, for awhile but I want to be in this space and they are the
big dog. I also see them addressing the disease and quality issues facing the
industry better than others.

Hi Ken -

Marine Harvest

I have a pretty good average price even though my first buys were above
$1.00/share. Both China and Japan are going to be eating a lot of fish so long
term the demand for protein will continue strong. The complete harvest cycle is
almost three years so you can not really back off on production and then
throttle it back up again. That's why the industry really needs to look at a
sustainable program.

There was another company working on a genetically bred fish which I am totally
opposed to at this time. The key to profitability is the cost of the food
mixture. They incorporate a lot of "wild" fish meal in their formula which in
the past has been the most expensive component. I hear they are close to
developing a formula that uses soybeans exclusively (soybean meal w/ a mixture
of fish oils) that will be cheaper and hopefully cleaner when used in a
production environment.

In Idaho there are trout farms that are profitable and produce a lot of the
fresh trout we see our local market. Catfish are harvested in the south and
even in Asia they harvest shrimp (not necessarily the cleanest environment as
they are known to use sewer effluent). There is a place for farm raised fish in
the food ecosystem. They just lowered the farmed raised salmon price in my area
to $4.99/lb.

When you research how chickens, hogs and turkeys are farmed and the
claustrophobic environment they live in and the enriched food loaded with the
latest antibiotics, you will never want to eat any of that mass production
farmed raised food. I find the current way they raise the salmon a middle of
the road approach when compared to mass production of chickens and/or hogs. Of
course, I raise my own chickens, do not eat pork and will only eat free range
turkey's.

One of my best AG investments so far is <u>Seaboard Corp. (SEB).</u> My first
purchase was 10/2011 and it is up almost 30%. I only bought 5 shares at
$1,697/share. I was tempted to sell one share today but the company is still
undervalued even at current levels. They bought a 50% interest in Butterball
Turkey last year and I bet they report excellent Q4 results due to Thanksgiving
and Christmas "food" holidays. The company also runs very eco friendly Hog
farms in Colorado integrated to use waste effluent to produce Bio-Diesel.

The one biggest thing I am learning from my Agriculture Investment theme is
there are still wild swings in both the input commodity prices and end user
prices that are not easily hedged by management. You also get unexpected
weather events that you have little to no control over.

OT. You might be interested in a farming concept my students are working on now
http://seawaterfoundation.org/sea_eritrea.html
There is a private venture in Mexico by the same people who did the Eritrean
farm.
We are building templates to share with a town in Chile. We reference
Lovelock's Gaia Theory (NOT the new agey off shoots and crazy stuff) and
Biomimicry ideas as well.
http://asknature.org/

These ideas are based on the work of Bill Mollison who wrote books in the 70's
called Permaculture 1 and 11 and who continues his work even now.

>>Marine Harvest’s ability to honor loan conditions is being called into
question after third-quarter net income declined 97 percent. The company’s 225
million euros ($310 million) of convertible bonds due 2015 trade at 82 cents on
the euro, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The bond has plummeted
from 123 cents at the start of the year, underperforming peers in the UBS
Convertible Europe Index, which have declined an average 7.6 percent.<<

Now, the high dividend in excess of earnings paid out earlier and partly
financed with debt come home to roost. I own some Pacific Andes (1174.HK) in
the fishing sector and so far so good but of course I bought low enough.

As for holding deer in captivity to shoot trophy's I agree it's despicable but
I am not sure about fish farming. The problems I see with the fish farming as
it's currently done is that the extremely high density makes it susceptible to
diseases which are very hard to control in water. in the long run, it may be
the only option to supply enough fish for human consumption but how to do it
right without harming wildlife is not clear to me.

Their background research looks useful.

However, I'm not too sure how useful their DCF model is. It gives you the

re XYL -
>>clown - have you actually looked at the water business or you are just

I have done both. XYL is an OK but not great business. They target 4-6% organic
growth rates supplemented by acquisitions. 75% of the business comes from the
US and Europe and a lot of that is from municipal or state entities, so it will
be affected by austerity moves just like defense as well. There is 1B$ in debt
as well as they have some pension obligations (less so than XLS).
If I can buy this for 10-11x earnings (17-20$/share) I am in. For 24$ I think
it's fairly valued and I am not interested in buying fair value :-).

"Biotech shorts are specialists who usually know more than the famous names you

Well sure. These men making the buy decisions though... I assume they know what
they don't know. And since they take in management fees, they would hire
biotech analysts and/or appropriate tech consultants to inform them and advise
them before they commit funds to these 'esoteric' businesses. So if they do
buy, these 'value' investors are betting that they and their biotech long
specialists are more right than other biotech specialists who say to avoid or
short.

--g-- Of course, maybe otoh it's some other professional investors who have
hired biotech specialists who have determined that ENZN is a good short
candidate who will continue to be proven correct.
