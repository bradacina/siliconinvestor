Re KRO - it is not quarter end selling that is causing the weak share price.
Competitor Tronox mentioned softness in demand for TiO2, which is causing it's
shares to be weak and KRO goes down in sympathy, I suppose.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tronox-sets-five-for-one-stock-split-dividend-
012-06-29?siteid=yhoof2

NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Tronox Ltd.
http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/TROX?link=MW_story_quote said Friday
it plans to issue a five-for-one stock split, launch a quarterly dividend of
$1.25 a share and buy back up to 2.5 million shares. Shareholders of record as
of July 20 will receive four additional shares for each share of the company.
Separately, Tronox, which produces mineral sands and pigments, said it's seeing
softness in demand stemming from "customer reactions to the continued
macroeconomic slowdown in, and risks arising from, China and the Eurozone
markets."

Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. (CBI) -NYSE - closed out position from
6/10/2010

I decided to close my position as this company has too much foreign currency
exchange risk in their order book if my premise of a stronger $US occurs over
the next 9-18 months. It's been a good run w/ a cost basis of $17.83/share. The

re MGDDY and European car sales, the news sources I am following state that
European car sales are very weak in South Europe (no surprise) but it seems to
be spreading to other countries as well. French car companies (Renault,
Peugeot) reported very weak results and rebates are increasing in Germany too
which indicates weaker sales. Ford just reported higher losses in Europe too
from their subsidy. Luxury car sales are still OK but I can see that changing
as well. the messages from China are mixed - the domestic chinese car companies
are reporting very weak results while some companies like GM are still
reporting solid results.

One thing that might be helping tire manufacturers are the much weaker rubber
prices but I suspect these savings will have to be passed on, since they passed
on price gains too pretty much without delay (unlike in the past).

I don't have hard numbers but I get a whiff of a lot of headwinds from European
automotive from a lot of directions. I suspect that some of the weak share
performance of ITT is related to automotive exposure (25% and quite a bit of
that in Europe) for example. Even outside the automotive sector, I suspect we
will see a lot of earnings warnings in the industrial and material sector after
the 4th of July week.

I see two short term catalysts to get the ball rolling:

1. The transportation bill passed today allows corporate pension plans to use
the average interest rate for the past 25 years instead of the last two years
in calculating future returns. Under-funded plans like F are magically less
under-funded and the bottom line earnings improved.

2. GM, FORD, NISSAN, FIAT, VW and more report earnings on July 3rd and are
expected to come in with the highest level of July sales in the U.S. in five

re F (Ford) thanks for the link. I was not aware of a change in the pension
assumption. From my point of view, it does not matter what actuary assumptions
are made - the fact is that Ford has to pay ~5.5B$ in hard cash to their
pension receivers and they have 58B$ in assets to cover it. it seems like a
stretch to assume that this asset base can support the outlays. Right now they
assume an 8% return on plan assets and based on that their pension fund is ~
10B$ underfunded. Given the interest rates we have right now and a 45%
allocation to bond funds according to their10K (note 18), i cannot see how they
make it. If you assume 7% return, they would need ~78B$ to support the
outflows, which would be a 20B$ shortfall.

In any case, i don't see F as an attractive stock, if you count in all
liabilities, the EV/ EBITDA does not look that attractive to me, relative to
better financed peers like BMW.DE (trading below tangible book), Daimler or
Toyota.

Just look at these stats (they include the finance ops) and compare with F.
BMW3.DE comes out ahead and as a luxury car maker, actually has a moat, much
less of a pension problem , a much better balance sheet etc.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=BMW3.DE+Key+Statistics

In most cases, it's better to avoid stocks with huge pension liabilities.
Analyst like to ignore or downplay them, so they are often not acknowledged in
earnings or FCF estimates. Managment tends to ignore them and speaks about
operating earnings or such. Yahoo ignores them too. You have to do the legwork
yourself. My last experience with XLS was not good either. It takes quite a
hurdle for me to even look into this stuff, since I know that in 80-90% of all

One more note on Ford's pension shortfall. Ford is addressing this problem. New
employees are not offered a defined retirement plan. Salaried retirees have
been offered a lump sum payment. Hourly wage retirees will be addressed when
the current contract expires. GM has copied and is going one step further
spinning their responsibility for retirees who do not take the lump sum offer
off to Prudential.

Re BMW.DE /BMW3.DE - the general perception in Germany (right or wrong) is that
the car makers are at peak earnings and they are priced as such. I personally
like BMW3.DE most and they are trading below tangible book right now - the
preferred have a huge discount to BMW.DE that is not justified, in particular
since the Quandt family calls the shots anyways.

I have looked at the GM pension deal briefly. My impression is that GM paid an
extra 3-4B$ to Prudential to get rid off 20B$ in gross (not net!) liability and
convert the pension into a PRU annuity basically. This makes sense PRU does not
sell 8% annuities (the assumed rate of return in most pension plans) so extra
funds are needed to make up for the shortfall. I don't know the gross liabilty
for GM's pension plant but it has to be in the hundred of billion $, so doing a
PRU like deal will require a lot of cash outlays. Add this to the EV ( i have
not done this) and decide yourself if GM is still cheap.

Killing the pension for new employees just helps not to perpetuate the problem,
but GM still has to deal with it for 20-30 years.

shares in 2008 to 330M shares now! This was done without incurring extra debt
and while WLP has not grown, it points to extremely healthy FCF. They recently
started to pay a dividend as well. The FCF yield ought to be north of 10% on
this stock and they have done a good job buying, when their shares were cheap.

WLP missed earnings recently which has caused weakness in the stock. I think it
is a buying opportunity. he health care law does not seem to bother other
insurers like UNH too much, so I think this is manageable.

$29 billion to Prudential for the annuity after pumping $3-4 billion into the
fund, cutting GM's liability for salaried employees from $36 billion to $10
billion.

GM's pension liability at the end of last year was $134 billion. The unfunded
portion was $25 billion. Expectations are that this new plan will lower their
unfunded liability to $24 billion or a 4% reduction.

Hi I2. re WMT: Congrats to those who have stayed with the company as the
company grew or prospered in the past couple of years while the stock didn't do
much. I sold my position about breakeven, if I recall correctly. My wife had
asked me not to buy/hold the stock based on her/our dislike of WMT's business
model/business practices. (She seems to tolerate or has not caught on to our
tobacco, alcohol, weapons stock positions, -g-)

I've got no firm opinion on the stock. I guess fairly-valued here. Or for a
ltb&h -- the company isn't going away, its base of customers seems to be
increasing as the ranks of the middle class fall, the company pays a small but
always increasing dividend -- so for a 5-10 year or longer hold in a
diversified portfolio -- it's perhaps a dull plodder and a maybe buy-to-keep.
Not for me. BWDIK? I said the same thing ("not for me") about XOM and other
conservative-labeled stocks in the 1970's: Little did I understand or
comprehend that a $1000 XOM buy June 1972 with dividends reinvested (assuming

Hi Clownbuck -

Re: WellPoint Inc. (WLP) -NYSE & "For Profit" HMO's

I sold all of my HMO stocks and basically am fundamentally against investing in
any "for profit" HMO. I feel health care is a social right (especially in the
richest country in the world) and should be provided at a break even and/or
subsidized universal price. I just can not see "profit" being made on these
services especially for the HMO sector.

That said, that's pretty incredible that WLP has reduced their outstanding
shares by over 40% from their FCF. I guess that "for profit" model has
benefited the company and the shareholders. Maybe that's why my heal care
premiums are such a large % of my net income now and my monthly health
insurance payments exceed my monthly home mortgage payment.

Health care is still a large percentage of our GDP so it is important to me to
be exposed to the sector. Both Becton, Dickinson and Company C (NYSE: BDX) and
Medtronic, Inc. (MDT) -NYSE have been mentioned and I like these companies. I
would also invest in some type of "for profit" preventive care/nutrition
companies. That is why I have a small amount of Nestl (NSRGY). That was brought
to my attention from several of your posts over the years. That company has
done some incredible things w/ their manufacture & distribution of their baby

My recent sell on AUUKY shares was a portfolio diversification move more than a

cost basis on my other shares is around $5.50/share. BHP is a no 2 holding even
w/ some sells last year. I did buy some VALE w/ some of the BHP proceeds last
year that is underwater but I moved a lot of the proceeds into cash.

I still believe commodities and natural resource stocks will continue to fall
in price as the $US gets stronger. There are however, some very compelling
value buys (IMO) in some of the jr. miner stocks. I started tracking positions
in RIC,CPPMF and AUNFF during the past week/month/quarter. I plan to build
these position up over then next 6-18 months if prices move lower.

CPPMF ( http://goo.gl/gVeMN ) has a compelling story and 2012 production
numbers should come in high. As this company grows and meets their production
targets,one could make an argument that it should be a $9.00 stock (not $3.50).

My portfolio is still heavy in both oil and natural resources even though I
have lightened up. I want to diversify those holding more into Canada than
South Africa so that is why I peeled off about 15% of my AAUKY shares. I
believe many of the small cap miners that are profitable now could more than
triple in value in the next commodity up cycle. However, I still believe it is
very early and it may be awhile (perhaps years) before we see these prices
moving higher. We have yet to see the bottom, maybe 30% lower. If I am wrong, I

Fidelity as custodian and current IRA account number?

ACAS claim. "whether I should mark "Identity of claimant" as "Individual" or as
"IRA""

It's sort of straightforward, imo. Although... I AM NOT A QUALIFIED PERSON to
answer, and even though I may sound like I know something, I have opinions
only, and I am wrong many, many times, -- as people here have affirmed -g-.

The difference between "individual" and "ira" is this (imho):

#1. If you fill out the form with "individual" checked, and you do get a
settlement check, you'll get a check in the mail a couple years from now. The
check will be addressed to you.

#2. If you fill out the form with the other choice, which reads "IRA Keogh, or
other type of individual retirement plan (indicate type of plan, mailing
address, and name of current custodian)", and you do get a settlement check,
the check is likely to be mailed to that mailing address (I am guessing).

Here's what I would do with ACAS bought in my IRA (and what I may do, if I ever
get around to filling out all the darn buys and sells I had with ACAS over the
eligible years):

First, growl... grr. #1 is simpler, quicker, easier... and wrong. Maybe
illegal. But who'll ever know? Ah well, grrrrr, I'll do the right thing and
check box #2.

#2: type of plan, for me: "IRA rollover, FBO Paul Senior. For you, you decide.
Maybe similar "IRA rollover, for benefit of Jurgis Bekepuris"
mailing address, for me: I will use my home address
name of current custodian, XXX Brokerage Service (xxx= name of broker holding
the IRA into which I would want the ACAS settlement check transferred)

What I would expect in this case, if the claims administer determined I was
eligible for some monies, they will eventually (couple years from now) send a
check to my home. That check would be addressed not to me, but to "Customer IRA
Rollover, FBO Paul Senior". This means my local bank will not cash the check.
Instead, I will drive to the brokerage firm, sign the check over to them and
the monies will be placed back into the IRA rollover. That ends it. There'll be
no taxes to be paid or fees or any other things to worry about. The check
proceeds will just show up in the IRA account under some terminology maybe like
"cash deposit" or "cash received"

I guess to save time/effort you have the option with "mailing address" to have
the check sent directly to FIDO. Myself, I just would rather have the check
sent to me and I turn it over to my broker after I confer with them. This all
will happen - imho - in two, maybe three years from now, and if the broker
(FIDO is very good) is capable and just deposits the check into the ira -- I
may not notice it or even remember what it was about. Also I have several IRA's
and with the check in-hand, I can tell the brokerage rep into which IRA the
check should be deposited.

Good luck!

That is, if you bought or held a stock during the eligibility period and you

brokerage buys&sells during the litigation eligibility period net out such that
you had net gains, not net losses (and so you made money and did not sustain
losses), your claim for damages will be denied (i.e. no cash payment for you)
This is my view and understanding. I'm saying, for me, before I go to the
trouble of making copies of buys and sells, I try to affirm from my records
that I will indeed be reporting a net loss if I complete the forms. I have had
instances where the claims administrator sent me the forms for a particular
stock, and I found I had an overall gain in the stock from shares
bought/sold/held in the eligibility period. Therefore, no sense in completing
and returning the forms for that stock. Again, in my view. (And I could be
wrong depending on the particular litigation.)

Of these I have Cameco. I think the countries are coming to realize that they
cannot replace such a reliable source of energy as nuclear. Japan is starting
their reactor. And there are talks in Germany too.

Re WLP - I agree with you that access to healthcare should be provided and the
USA is the only ndustrilized country that hasn't done this so far. The cost of
health care in the USA is roughly 2x of the same service in other comparable
countries in Europe per my experience. that said, even with universal health
care, there is a police for private insurers like WLP.

In any case, WLP is more of a service or pass through organization than an
insurer. they pay out about 83-84% of their premiums, ~13-14% goes into G&A and
some investment income ( from the customer funds they hold) and the small
insurance margin provide the margin. It is u likely, that an non-profit would
be more efficient. What is inflated, is not WLP administrative side, it is the
service cost.

That said, WLP buy back are remarkable - the share count peaked in 2005/2006 at
about 620M shares ( after an acquisition spree) and now they are down to 330M
shares. Basically, they are doing what Teledyne has done in it's days. The
revenues have not moved in all in all those years, but in terms of per share
data, the growth has been quite nice, compounded over 10% annually, and the
value proposition is that the shares have treated water, so the stock is now
way cheaper than it used to be.

I think this has to do with the infatuation for dividends rather than buybacks,
people like to do dividend re-investing but here we have a compounder that is
cheap and beats any utility that I am aware of, yet people yawn even here in a
value forum when I bring it up.

Even better WLP has started to pay a dividend as well, and I expect it to grow
fairly fast. I think this may draw the attention of the dividend invested crowd
at some point.

But it's just one reactor out of many that is shut restarted in Japan. The net
result in uranium consumption from the shutdowns in Japan and Germany is still
very negative. While I agree that shutting down the reactors is a mistake,
things are the way they are, not the way we want them to be.

China build is a fleet of nuclear reactors but see what happens if they get a
serious situation ( which given the way, they implement complex technical
systems is not that unlikely, see the high speed trains).

Even if a country were to decide to restart their nuclear reactors after they
have been idled, it would take many years to get them back into operation.

Clownbuck: I recently sold a my few tracking shares of EXPD for a small loss. I
have the stock on my watch list now.

I like the company for:

its continuing good business results (ROE)

its strong cash, no ltd position

its management led by Mr. Rose. He's built employee loyalty and strong
corporate culture. For example, with his no-layoff policy in bad times (2008).

its relatively good metrics (low p/e now compared to historical numbers)

---
For me, this is one of those cases where, given I been I've been enthused about
the business model and the excellent results the company has obtained over the
years, I apparently failed to weigh the value proposition. Instead I relied on
relative metrics (which is very dangerous).

Stock is still too expensive, imo, for a value buy. I watch EXPD though,
because I may yet reenter if stock drifts lower.

Paul - i am very disappointed by your comments here. I thought you knew better.
You are basically accusing me of plagiarizing. If you read my posts on my blog
then for every post that i have read online or barrons, I mention at the top
that its not my analysis and i read it online. My intention is to highlight
good reads to readers who come to my blog. Not everyone reads as much as you do
or I do. I have a full time job and am passionate about investing thats why i
do all this reading. but other people who have a full time job may not have
time to read stuff! So for you to come out and say that i ascribe someone elses
work to myself, is extremely disappointing to me. Next time you accuse me to
that, i will advice, you either ask me for an answer or do your homework before
pointing figures at my integrity.

Now for your other comments :

A. "Fundamentals don't look "good" to me though. P/E over 20, only this year is
profitable of last five. Not a value stock" -- if you are going to tell me that
some stock is not a value stock bcs its P/E is more than 20x, i guess
bankruptcies should not be value plays either? As I have mentioned before,
value is a very relative term and you should not go lecturing about value based
on P/Ex. You should rather looking at the firm and potential catalysts. We have
different ways to look at value. Its wise therefore to give a tangible argument
(Clown gave me one)instead of throwing a number at me, which in itself is
useless.

B. You are going to get bitten one day if you continue to use other writers'
facts/statements/conclusions and ascribe them to yourself without acknowledging
the source.

I always appreciate your comments, however, NEVER ACCUSE me of stealing stuff,
unless you have some sort of proof. I mention on my blog that its not my work,
when its not mine.

And "we all will get bitten one day" its a stupid advice to give because anyone

Here is an interesting post regarding the cost of production for gold.
Apparently it is increasing at a fast pace (up over 30% in last 6 months). For
me, that's hard to believe so it must either be a country specific thing and/or
a company operation specific event.

http://goo.gl/QM3zs

Barrick Gold (ABX) was mentioned in the post. RIC seems to acting like they may
be incurring higher production costs too. My thought was to look at the newer
and efficient Canadian miners as their production costs are lower and have no
new Country resource tax like So. Africa.

It's still something to watch as I only want to own the very efficient

In my opinion nuclear energy is very clean ! It is the most reasonable solution
to reliable clean energy. It is not corn and wind mills, or solar panels. Maybe
not yet. Maybe because we still don't have very efficient ways to store energy,
but sooner or later people come to realize if something is not reasonable.
Nuclear is the cheapest most reliable of electric energy so far. It is very
unreasonable to give it up before you have discovered anything better.
I have enormous respect for the Geraman and Japanese people and they have the
discipline to replace it, but they are starting to realize it is not
beneficial. I saw a Bill Gates TED video about a new technology that entirely
burns all the nuclear waste and produces more energy. If Germany grows 4% per
year I believe they will need about 30% more energy net in 10 years.

so thanks for the explanation. I understand that you are limited in what you
can post or talk about due to professional conflict.

Looking at the websites mentioned in your blog led me to this article on Steel
Partners:

http://otcadventures.com/?p=90

I have been a fan of Warren Lichtenstein with the exception of his investments
in Japan. I did not know that Steel Partners had gone public. It started otc
and is now listed on the NYSE.

On a quick glance it looks appealing. I don't see any Japanese exposure,
Litchtenstein has skin in the game and the stock is selling at a deep discount
to book value. I am going to do some more reading on this.

Also, their partner Carlyle probably got the best part of the deal but I am not

NG usage in the N.E. is not as common as it is in the West Coast.

Completion of the pipeline connecting NYC is expected to be completed next
year, opening up a huge market.

This co. is well set up to exploit any price expansion of NG as it has been
doing quite well simply by the increased demand for NG for producing energy due
to the weakness in price.

SE received a recent analyst upgrade factoring in the weakness of NG pricing.

Sergio - thanks. I do lot of other readings, but i don;t like to put up stuff
just because i thought some firm is trading at low P/Ex or P/Bx. (And i am not
saying this to tease Paul). Barron's highlights some good catalyst, therefore i
put it up on my blog for people to read and then do their own homework.

For example - I have speaking with a former PM at Owlcreek fund, who is
following me on Seeking Alpha. He sometimes picks up ideas from these posts to
research further - which is what I am trying to achieve with weekly posts on my
blog.

Given my job commitments, i read about another 4 -5 publications in addition to
barrons in a week ( I can do more if i only had money to manage). I have
approx. 10-15 ideas at any given time i look at, however, i don;t like to post
them unless i do my homework.

On investing in Steel partners, i prefer in investing in one of the ideas they
are investing in, rather than investing/trading the fund shares. I am sure you
know that to be certain of making money trading steel partners, you will and
should see their books. to the extent they are public, you need to look at
their exposure to individual positions, cost basis and hedging policies. This
is not going to be easy however not impossible either.

If you are talking about ideas, there are two firms i have recently put on my
watch list:

Rentech Nitrogen Partners - Manufactures nitrogern fertilizer and industrial
products including ammonia, urea and stuff. Used natural gas as its primary
feedstock. debt, 10M; Cash:72M; 6Q EPS is more than 15%; last Q EPS is more
than 46%; last Q sales increase is 60%.

CATM: Over leveraged; they have contract with BoA which provides them with 56%
of their cash needs. The contract is set to expire in October,2012.

Dennis,

Thanks a lot. I am special sits guy, so I always look for catalysts in addition
to value. I look at range of catalysts from post reorg equities, spin's, chap
11, divestitures, so on and so forth. It has worked great for me so far.
Obviously, I have lot of ideas, but i can only look at 1 or two at a time.

I don;t get time, due to full time job i have, therefore, when i have some
catalysts or i spot certain numbers, or if i jot down something good and i
don;t get time to look at those ideas, I post it here for people to look at.

Now having said that, not all ideas I post might qualify for an investment
however, some might. So when i post something here, unless i say, its something
i am going to invest in or is on Seeking Alpha as a detailed writeup, then its
just to point out some good names for people here and contribute to this
chatroom.

CATM is a potential short. Its about contract expiration in oct 2012 and
leverage. If that contract gets priced at a higher price point, it will affect
margins and their bottomline. In addition, they have a lot of leverage, so the
firm might get squeezed.

RNF - i have only gleaned at numbers very quickly and them being on the agri
side got my attention. There have been attempted consolidation in this sector,
the firm has good growth, is a midcap name and might be a takeover target. In
addition, nat. gas being where it is, the question of how they will support
their P/E should be obvious? It will take atleast anywhere between 1 -3yrs for
nat. gas prices to come back up.

As i have always said in my previous posts, the only real investment I have
currently has been my investment in Sara lee since mid 2011. I have earned a
2.5% div yield on it. in addition i just earned a $3 special dividend. Catalyst
was a spinoff. I hold original meatco shares that are potential takeover target
with good management. In addition, i have coffeeco shares, part of business
that again is run by good management and is growing in europe. So overall
worked out really well.

The whole point of Graham's exercise is that stocks should be purchased when
they are screaming values - not "relative values" as we have been conditioned
since 1995. We haven't seen as many Graham-type values in so long because we
haven't had a complete washout a la 1982, 1974, or 1968-1969.

Now, these rules are set aside for "Enterprising Investors." Other investors
(more conservative, or inactive) Graham feels can buy fairly-valued stocks and
hold on to them (his last edition of The Intelligent Investor came just before
the 1974 washout, and many stocks were trading at between 25x-50x earnings
during the Nifty Fifty craze). Just don't pay more than 16x trailing earnings
for the past seven years for a good, dividend-paying stock with little debt.
JNJ, MMM, MSFT are a few that can be had right now for decent valuations, pay
dividends, and have good balance sheets.

If you take a look at anything Shiller, Hussman, Richard Russell, Charles
Allmon, or Jim Rogers have done, their work will tell you that we don't have
any real Graham-type bargains in the market right now. Sure, you can pick up a
few - but, to be a true Graham operation, you need to own over a hundred stocks
meeting his criteria. Graham-Newman Corp. followed these guidelines very
profitably (of course, Graham also had a huge position in GEICO - a 1/4 stake
in the company - that he purchased in the forties, I believe).

Graham wrote that a well-diversified portfolio need not contain a hundred
stocks, as his did. Between ten and thirty equities covering several fields of
business should provide adequate diversification, in his view. However, the
fact that so few Graham bargains are available in today's market should be
taken as an indicator that we should batten down the hatches and wait for panic
sellers to turn richly-valued stocks into bargains for us to snap up.

>>Graham-Newman Corp. followed these guidelines very profitably (of course,
Graham also had a huge position in GEICO - a 1/4 stake in the company - that he
purchased in the forties, I believe).<<

This is correct but it should be noted that Warren Buffet by far outperformed
Graham Newman, using first an activist approach and later by purchasing quality
companies and decent and sometimes great prices. I think Graham Newman only
outperformed the market by a few % points annually. WEB absolutely trounced the
market in his early days. the Graham Newman mousetrap was good but other
mousetraps from Graham Doddsvile followers worked even better imo.

FWIW, i do think that the Graham approach is too restrictive - the fact that
Graham was the first does not mean, he is/was the best. My opinion from this is
that we should absolutely feel free to tweak the Graham approach and I think it
will work, as long as the tweaks are rational and based on rational value based
criteria.

In this particular case, 2011 FCF value depends on whether you subtract money

E_K_S,

Paul and I talked about Sunoco and other refiners throughout last year. Since
then the company has spun off its SunCoke business. There's a tiny arbitrage
opportunity here, which could could be better than money market funds, but it's
your call. I'm holding onto my shares for now.

Hi EKS

Took a starter position in TRN to add to my GMT. Was speaking to a relative at
a 4th of July get together,who now lives in Houston, moved from San Antonio. He
travels around Texas regularly and mentioned seeing an ad down there for 500
"rail" workers. So I nibbled today following the energy/equipment/ supply

Web Site: http://goo.gl/fQbqO
May 2012 Presentation: http://goo.gl/x69oP
Trinity Industries ADFN Financials: http://goo.gl/2P1Fk

This looks like an interesting value prospect. I never ran into this company
when I was looking at rail car builders. Except for their high debt, their
value characteristics look promising. Stock is selling close to it's TBV of
$21.2/share.

The company generates a lot of cash flow probably from their leasing
activities. Except for one negative EPS report in 2009-2010, the company
reported positive earnings in the last 8 years.

PE's are attractive too: Current PE=11.5; Forward PE=7.4. Total LT Debt to
Annual NET income is high at 18x's but very typical for a leveraged leasing
company. For example BOX ( http://goo.gl/f7dfd ) is 32x's.

My EKS's value is $29.00/share (using 2011 EPS of $1.17/share) at the low end
and $39.00 at the high end (using 2012 EPS estimates of $3.30/share). That's
16% - 56% undervalued from current levels.

I have added the company to my watch list and will start a tracking position
below $24.00/share

Closed position in KRO for small profit. Will try to re-enter at a lower price
(below $14.00). Still a bit too much exposure in Europe than I would like. Move
the proceeds into TRN. TRN is a better value proposition to me. Also, they gave

Welcome to the SI Value thread SimonK -

From your list of stocks ( http://goo.gl/uoFgK ), I own TOT that I bought at
10% higher prices. I believe this is an excellent undervalued large integrated
oil play. You might want to bookmark the http://www.mcdep.com/ report Web site.
They rank TOT as the most undervalued integrated oil company (at least on their
latest report). Pg-2- of the report shows TOT with a .53 McDep ratio (47%
undervalued on their 1.00 scale). http://www.mcdep.com/mr120522.pdf

As far as your other stocks, most are selling with a PE below 10. That for me
represents a pretty good value. DDAIF has been discussed a little down thread.
At the top of the SI Value thread screen, you can enter a search string to find
earlier posts. Here is a recent post by Paul Senior that mentions DDAIF (
http://goo.gl/uyv9v ).

It helps to add one or more reasons why you like the stock(s) especially from a
value perspective. I try to find those value stocks that fit an investment
theme. Today, I started a tracking position in TRN. I didn't realize they were
the leading producer of propane tanks, tank containers, and tank heads for
pressure and non-pressure vessels in North America. As a value candidate stock,
it also meets my NG infrastructure theme. http://goo.gl/x69oP

Many of the companies post their quarterly presentations on their Web site.
That's a good source of information.

Hope to hear about some of your other picks and some reasons why you like them.
Maybe they have some yet undiscovered hidden value nuggets in a
subsidiary/division which provides a level of safety for the value investor.

Welcome SimonK.

I try to review each alleged value stock mentioned on this thread to see if
they might fit my criteria and be a buy for me.

With my usual quick scan, my opinions are:

UPL. Have to pass for now. I can't determine if it's a value (for me) unless I
look closer at its land holdings, oil production vs. gas and ngls, nav. No time
now.

DDAIF. Looks like a value buy, and perhaps could be a better pick than my
choice of Volkswagen (VLKAY). Though maybe not as good as BMW, mentioned here a
few posts ago. I don't have enough information or conviction about Mercedes
though to alter my holding of VLKAY, and given that I already own several auto
manufacturers (GM, F), that's enough for me right now.

TOT. Several of us on this thread have reported that we are buyers/holders of
the stock. I'm in, and consider TOT to be undervalued and a buy at its current
price.

NIKE. Seems relatively (to its history) undervalued. Paying 15x forward p/e
though for a shoe/clothing manufacturer still seems too expensive too me. OTOH,
it is Nike with its excellent history of profitability and its brand name and
apparent dominance in footwear technology and footwear sales (riots occurring
for its latest fashions). For me, I'll pass on this one at its current price.

For some stocks, the question imo has to be asked "How long would you be in
these stocks?" I suspect a couple years or 3-5 year holding for NIKE would
eventually put the price up higher than it is now. Maybe decently higher.
Perhaps higher for Mercedes a couple of years out also. If the stock were held
that long, then I'd say the stocks could be buys at current prices although
they may be expensive. (Expensive in my view).

Good luck with your choices!

Hi Grommit:

RE: TRN

That's a lot of insider selling. I missed that. I did find this pending
litigation which is quite large (over $100M). I wonder if some of the insiders
know the possible out come?

<blockquote>Trinity Industries subsidiary files litigation against Suzlon Wind
EnergyTrinity Structural Towers, a subsidiary of Trinity Industries, announced
that it filed a breach of contract law suit against Suzlon Wind Energy
Corporation for failure to comply with its purchasing obligations for
structural wind towers from TSTI pursuant to the 2008 Supply Agreement between
the two companies. The law suit was filed in the District Court of Dallas
County. In accordance with the Agreement, Suzlon agreed to purchase
approximately $377.3M worth of TSTI-manufactured 80-meter wind towers on a
scheduled basis through 2011. <u>Following the execution of the Agreement, TSTI
and Suzlon mutually agreed to amend the Agreement on two separate occasions,
ultimately resulting in an additional $123.8M worth of wind towers to be
purchased and extending the delivery timeframe of wind towers through 2013.
</u>To date, TSTI has produced and delivered approximately $88.6M worth of wind
towers.</blockquote>
Suzlon Wind Energy Corporation is pretty large. Their corporate headquarter is
located in India but have operations in Brazil, China and North America.
http://goo.gl/QNv4U

There was some news that the parent company was having problems making payments
on their corporate bonds and was selling assets to raise money. Sales include a
wind farm and a China manufacturing facility.

My TRN tracking position is small.

Kronos Worldwide Inc. (KRO) is more profitable on several measures:

re: "nuclear energy is very clean"

imho events like Fukushima are going to cast a long shadow. As alternatives to
nuclear continue to arise and become more cost competitive it's going to be
hard to make the case to the public unless you can build the nuclear plants out
in the middle of nowhere. These things have black swan written all over them -
seem like a great deal until a major city has to be evacuated.

again, all imho - but it seem likely we'll see another event that will again
set nuclear back - (at least nuclear as we currently know it).

Hi SimonK,

I've owned TOT before and it still seems attractive to me, esp w/ the dividend
if it's sustainable (they're cashflow negative right now), but I got stopped
out for a loss on my last buy (maybe a yr ago?) and have not re-entered. After
your post I just looked at TOT again and noticed it's now down to 1.1X book -
pretty low compared to XOM, CVX. TOT used to trade 2-3X book prior to 08.
