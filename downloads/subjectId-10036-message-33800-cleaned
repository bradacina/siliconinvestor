It occurs to me that AIG is a much bigger scam than Madoff- The number bandied
about for Madoff was $50 Billion but that number includes 30 years of
non-existant profits. on the other hand the US treasury has already shoveled
out $160 billion of real money on behalf of AIG and this has probably received
1/50 th of the media attention that Madoff has gotten. I wonder why? Geithner

re AIG - yes the losses are probably bigger than Madoff but keep in mind that
AIG was also a huge operation with an almost trillion $ balance sheet. Most of
their losses were created in an obsure and entirely unregulated part that was
writing credit insurance on mortgage bonds. That is what did them in. The rest
of the operation may well have been fairly healthy (they were in many regulated
business where I assume that blatant fraud within those operation would not be
easy).

I also think it is correct that Greenberg started the whole thing, at least I
am hearing that they started to write credit insurance under his watch. He was
lucky to get ousted as the chairman a few years back. I think he started the
Doomsday machine.Sullivan never had a clue what morass he was in, until very
late. The complete saga will be very interesting.

I also lost some $ with AIG but sold when they had a disagreement with their
auditor. I think that was early Y2008. I decided then to keep out of all
insurers.

The puts are exercisable only in the future, but for now they are a loss and

position (although to be honest, I don't know the size of the liability versus
Berkshire's capital base). Sure it could work out fine, but it could also

Actually it's not, especially when counterparty cannot force it to be delivered

analysis on your own to figure out the possible risks and rewards. Would be
more worthwhile than parroting "common knowledge". ;)

The only place where Buffett may have been wrong is not accounting for the cost
of losing AAA rating. I.e. it may be that incremental cost of capital due to
rating loss is bigger than the gain from the put. But then there is no
guarantee that Berkshire would have held AAA even without the put. WFC/USB/AXP

Reits: stock in lieu of cash dividends. Someone's told me that this only
applies to the common shares. The preferreds have to be paid in cash. Which if
true, is good news for preferred shareholders.

I haven't been able to confirm. I Googled and got IRS Revnue Procedure 2008-68
where it talks about the distribution possibilities for the reit common shares.
No mention of preferred shares.

I got my impression from the below Dow Jones report that reits were permitted
to issue stock for preferred dividends. The article said, referring to Jay
Leupp, a portfolio manager for Grubb & Ellis AGA Realty Income Fund:

"Leupp noted, so far, no REIT has elected to pay part of its preferred dividend
in stock."

Anyways, how would that work? Would preferred shareholders get more preferred
stock? At what price? If it is the current price of the preferred they would
issue more debt (from a shareholders perspective, preferred are debt) at
extremely high interest rates? That would not make any sense.

Just another bad datapoint regarding REITs. CS (accessible for those with

You can think of a stock dividend as a combination cash dividend and a
mandatory rights offering. They can make you buy the shares but they cannot
make you keep them. You can sell the dividend shares and you will then have the
dividend in cash.

The only issue is that as a stockholder, you may not want to see a rights
offering at today's stock prices. If you feel that way, you have to keep the
shares and sell something else to get your "cash dividend".

Does this make sense?

%BOM---------------------
Date:3/17/2009 1:33:34 AM
From:Paul Senior
Yes, makes sense if I consider that the distribution is a stock dividend - a
combination cash dividend and a mandatory rights offering.

But I don't consider it as such. I buy these reits for the cash distributions.
Not as something where management arbitrarily makes the stock/cash decision and
maybe the other stockholders decide (vote) the ratio of cash/stock. (And of
course the majority elect all cash. Which means everybody gets mostly stock)
It's also a management decision that worries me - it may be by necessity one
step above the other alternative of a distribution cut or elimination.

And another thing I don't like is that whether I sell the shares distributed to
me or hold on to them, the value of the distribution -- unlike a regular stock
dividend -- is taxable income in the year of receipt (for reits held in a USA
taxable account.)

So the way I consider it is that the company reneges on sort of an implicit
agreement to pay cash, instead issues me stock and I've got to pay tax on it
(in taxable account). This is not what I want from a reit. I want to be
receiving money...not paying it out.

Not criticizing you or anyone else who might have reits and has determined the
stock distribution is okay for them. It might work out very well -- getting
shares at low prices now when the reits are out-of-favor. And if/when cash
distributions are fully reinstated, getting that cash on a larger number of
shares.

The whole mess with these stock dividends is just BS and shows how bad the
fundamentals of the REIT sector really are. the stock dividend really means a
dividend cut, nothing else. It creates amongst other things a steady supply of
stock at given dividend dates that is partly being sold. great for the shorts
probably but for the shareholders?

It does make the preferred look better at least in relative terms.For one thing
we have cash versus paper but we also have the fact that the REIT preserves
cash for the holders of debt and preferred.

If these REITs were really worth what management and some brokerage reports are
saying the solution would be simple: Sell properties and deleverage buying back
discounted preferred and debt. But of course nobody is buying CRE right now,
which of course means that these NAV are really BS as well by my logic.

That said, preserving cash may be the only way for these REITs to survive, but
then they should just call it what it is - a dividend cut to zero, IMO.

The whole thing makes me think that this is just an industry to be avoided for
at least a year if not more.

the capriciousness of usa management in general of willy nilly cutting

the way management sees shareholders, as a source of funds rather than as

to be a problem. It sounds like this decision to pay stock dividends on reits
will exert downward pressure on reit share prices for the reasons you gave for
selling. seems unusual though that you would have to pay taxes on a stock
dividend.

Hi Paul - I have been holding off on starting a position in the Lexington
Realty Trust (LXP) preferred series based on this announcement.

Lexington Realty Trust Announces Quarterly Dividend on Common Shares of $0.18
Per Share Payable 10% in Cash and 90% in Common Shares
Monday March 16, 6:51 pm ET

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/090316/la84603.html?.v=1

It appears that this does not apply to their preferred series (so far) but it's
still raises a red flag to me.

There are too many other REITs that pose less risk looking forward 12-18
months. LXPpB, LXPpC & LXPpD are all trading at or near their lows. If I owned
these, I would implement my hedging strategy by selling short the common, buy
Puts on the common or exiting these preferreds and closing out my long
position.

==============================================================

As companies announce dividend cuts to preserve cash, a lot of potential value
opportunities will be on sale. Specifically, I have been waiting for EI DuPont
de Nemours & Co. (DD) to announce a cut (nothing so far) as it traded at a new
multi year low last week. On any cut, I expect to be buying shares between
$10/share and $15/share. The ace-in-the-hole is DD's solar division in China
that comes with the deal.

The patient investor will be well rewarded to snap up these value buys on any
such news. Both dividend cuts and paying dividends with stock (SFL recently
announced the option for shareholders to receive they dividend in stock) are
indications that companies are short term cash poor. If the other value matrics
look sound, it might be a good time to nibble.

Hi Paul - The key is to be very selective on your buys. The good companies
should sell off along with the bad. Spekulatis posted this report (
http://www.citigroupgeo.com/pdf/SNA31115.pdf ) from citigroup which has a very
detailed analysis for the valuation of several Reits.

theHunter REIT Industry Comparative Valuation Analysis (pg 57) presents a table
showing the "Implied Value" $/sf & Cap Rate for several REITs grouped by
"property type". On page 76, they arrive at a "Universal Summary Rating" which
I have been using to pick out potential survivors.

It's a moving target and I expect things to get worse but this provides a good
first screen for selecting "safe" REITs. You just have to avoid the land mines
and have your exit strategy in place if FFO's start to fall off a cliff.

So did you actually calculate the risks and returns using "real option theory"

read Buffett's explanation of the investment? You accuse me of "implication",
but you make no effort whatsoever to give any foundation to your claim.

Until you show under which model you operate calling this "speculative", I
cannot help you to change your opinion.

And by the way in your previous post you called this "as speculative as you
get". Are you backpedalling now to a merely "speculative according to Graham"?
Sure you cannot find anywhere in Graham an endorsement of such position, since
it did not exist in his time. It actually does not exist even now for any of us
mere mortals, since Buffett got a position very different from "real options".
So the only way to figure out if it is speculative is to calculate risks and
rewards under different scenarios. Go ahead, I asked you to do this once, maybe

amazed that the rating agencies have any credibility remaining at this point.

Were ratings just opinions, all would be fine. The problem is they are written
into debt instruments and cause forced real world activities. And all of it
seems to be subjective: the first 'rating' that seems to have an objective
observable is at 'C' --- default.

Since we don't know the real details of how the ratings are determined it is
all a mystery. So why would one use them at all?

Answer: That's all you got. I don't know how it was done before there were
'rating agencies'. I would guess there is a very long history spanning
centuries and involves insurance that actually pays off on physical world
events.

I think the only way to discuss this as speculative or not is to build a
risk/reward model. It is very similar to insurance that is a major Berkshire
business. Is insurance "speculative"? My answer would be that it depends on
assumptions used. If one assumes very few hurricanes in Florida or takes very
low premiums, then it is speculative. If the model is conservative and premiums
high, then it is not. Insurance is not a Graham investment either, so looking
at him for answer is not an option (pardon the pun :P). One can either exclude
whole classes of investments based on the fact that Graham did not do it, or to
figure out what are potential risks and rewards. Buffett put position is
actually rather simple case, since there are only couple of variables to
consider.

In retrospect it is possible to call Buffett investments in banks more
speculative than the put position, since they depend on short term government
actions that can kill (or at least severely dilute) existing shareholders
without any recourse. But the right thing to do would be to build a model for
bank shareholders. ;)

I only know what you know, I’m only have access to public information. We also

The company has given guidance that it has FFO of like $1.35 a share for 2009.

Jurgis,

A few questions and comments for you here and then I am done. I apologize to
the board for continuing this, but Jurgis has gotten under my skin.

1. No I didn't calculate the risk and returns using real option theory. It
obviously doesn't apply since this isn't a power plant? What I am telling you
is that I have experience with options, probably more than you do. I bring it
up because you accuse me of "parroting common knowledge" without even knowing
anything about me.

2. We are not taking about insuring hurricanes. We are talking about writing
naked puts on the stock market. Options did exist at Graham's time, and Graham
lived through the great depression. Graham recommended a heavy dose of bonds in
the portfolio. Do you honestly think he would have recommended selling
out-of-the-money put options as an investment? He would have called it
speculation 100% IMO.

3. What is your definition of speculative? It appears you think you defining
speculation as a "bad investment". This is wrong. It is an investment with a
high degree of risk relative to the dollars invested. Out-of-the-money puts are
a speculation because you can lose many times your dollars invested, and I
expect that Buffett is under water most or all of his entire initial investment
(or even more) as of right now.

According to my definition, I stand by the claim that selling naked puts is
about as speculative as you can get. Many trading shops have blown-up selling
out-of-the-money puts. This is even though I believe puts are overvalued on
average (due to volatility skew), and that the average margins from doing so
are quite handsome. A speculation may have a positive expected pay-off and may
actually be a worthwhile business opportunity, but it is a gamble.

IMHO among the more egregious omissions in the various financial statements

various banking lending agreements in which ratings determined many of the
borrowing base numbers, when the rating changed so did the borrowing base
numbers and the overall line of credit. None of this info was disclosed to

enough about the systemic risk before hand to regulate it? nobody is asking

I told you guys at the time that the TARP was a license to steal and no way

So you did not provide a single shred of evidence that this is a speculative
investment. You say: "This is wrong. It is an investment with a high degree of
risk relative to the dollars invested." Yes, this is what my definition of
speculative investment as well.

"Out-of-the-money puts are a speculation because you can lose many times your
dollars invested, and I expect that Buffett is under water most or all of his
entire initial investment (or even more) as of right now." - and this is where
you parrot a textbook. Buffett did not sell "out-of-money-put" in standard
definition. You choose not to see a difference and not to calculate the
potential losses and gains. You believe without any supporting arguments that
10 year puts on the market not callable before expiration work exactly the same
as a month puts on a single company. You choose to ignore Buffett's explanation
why there is a difference. You just repeat whatever is in your head without
doing any work or any thinking. Please build a model, come back with it and
then we talk.

IBM reportedly in talks to buy Sun Microsystems

LONDON (MarketWatch) -- International Business Machines Corp. is in talks to
buy Sun Microsystems for at least $6.5 billion in a deal that would put
hardware back at the core of Big Blue's operations and bolster its
computer-server business, The Wall Street Journal reported.

----------------------------------------------------------------

IBM's offer for Sun Microsystems is a value proposal. I wonder what other
beaten down tech companies may be picked up by the big three (CSCO, HP & IBM)
to enhance their operations.

I own both Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NasdaqGS: JAVA) & Hewlett-Packard Company
(HPQ). Maybe I need to add some CSCO and IBM to balance out my tech holdings.

Jurgis,

I just explained it vert simply to you. Selling a put you can lose many times
your initial initial investment, which I am calling the put premium (your
maximum profit potential). By its very design, selling a put is a speculation
unless there is essentially no probability that the put will be in the money.

Now you or Buffett may claim that markets always will be up 15 to 20 years from
now. Explain that to the Japanese. It's been almost twenty years since 1990 and
the market is what about a third of where it was? If you can demonstrate a
realistic model that shows there is zero probability that these puts will be in
the money, then I'll concede your point. You can't

It also helps if you don't sell the puts at the height of the credit bubble,
with low volatilities and overvalued equity prices, but that's just of timing
not mathematics. So, yes selling a put is a speculation. QED, end of story.

MC

PS: Buffet was already down $6.7 billion on the trade in November, more than he
could ever make on the trade

Wow, finally we are getting closer to a model. So far your model does not
account for a few significant things, but at least it begins looking like a
model. So here are next steps.

You forget that he received money NOW. And by investing that money for 10
years, you can also make "many times" the money you received. OK, maybe not
many times, but at 10% cumulative about 2.5X (15% - 4X). That's the beauty of
selling super long term put. So how about accounting for that? It is like
insurance float, which may or may not be costless.

And giving a single example of Japanese market does not make for any kind of
general model. You'd have to show what percentage of time this occurs. It IS
like insuring against hurricanes. If you claim that Florida gets 3 hurricanes a
year, which occurred once in the last century, this is not a model I'd use. So
let's look how often markets were lower in 10 years time and by how much. Of
course, you can argue that "this time it's different", but I won't buy it.
Market was not generally overvalued in 2007. That's why so many value investors
got bitten by losses of getting in too early. But if you say that general
predictions do not apply, at least then we know where we disagree.

After you account for these two things, you can start arguing whether this is
speculative.

Regarding Buffett's current losses, they are irrelevant. They are no more real
than any decline in a stock price. He does not have to pay now and he does not
even need to post collateral. So your argument based on them is pure strawman.

CORE looks like an undervalued stock to me.

What's not so great for me is that there's not much public history to
Core-Mark:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=CORE&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=

(Company's been around a while though: Their website says they were founded in
1888.)

For a buy for me, I would like to see this stock trading closer again to the
$15-16's of the past couple of weeks than at the current price. There are so
many value stocks available that maybe it pays to just wait to see if
volatility brings prices closer again to lows. Otoh, who knows?

The stock's a buy because it seems in its short history to have been
profitable, and for such a distributor (26 distribution centers, broad product
array), to report a good quarter and outlook, yet to have a p/sales ratio of
only .04--- that says to me the company is likely undervalued.

Company doesn't seem to have too much debt (I've not considered refunding
issues, if any). I note pension liabilities are up sharply. P/e of 10 is
acceptable. Price below stated book is a strong positive.

N.B.: About "a reasonable trade (a buy and subsequent sell) over the next
several months", on that I have no opinion. I'm figuring maybe a buy and hold
for maybe a short-term, 18-24 mo., timeframe.

It has a stable of what some would argue are second tier food brands, but you

In past few months, company ceo has been interviewed couple of times on my
favorite Bloomberg show. Paraphrasing, the ceo says he's navigated tough
business conditions before,and that he expects company to do okay. Ceo says
he's still looking at acquisitions, but that can't find motivated sellers.

Meanwhile the dividend has been cut. Right now it's. .17 and the bond component
(interest payment) is .21, which gives in total about a 15% yield on the hybrid
BGF stock. Not bad - if the common stock dividend holds up. (If it doesn't, the
stock will crater.)

Stock's up from past two weeks. As a current shareholder, it seems like chasing
to me to buy right now. Maybe somebody just looking now to start a position
though will have a different perspective.
Who knows if there'll be be another chance to buy closer to recent lows? If I

Brandywine Realty Trust (BDN) declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per
common share today which is 30% below from their last year's quarterly payout.
The preferred series continue to be paid at their stated rates. (
http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/090318/ph85807.html?.v=1 )

The common shares traded at a 15 year low inter-day at $2.95/share (previous
low in Dec 1992 was $1.50/share) and recovered back into it's previous trading
range of $3.40/share - $3.60/share. After it's low in 1992, BDN traded to a
recovery high of $25.00/share in December 1997 (5 years got a 16 bagger).

Is a similar recovery possible in this cycle or will BDN default on some of
their LT debt?

Low 10 year yields pave the way for much better credit terms for REIT's. If
they are borrowing at a premium to 10 year yields, the cost of capital just
went down 25% today with rates dropping from 3% to 2.5%

I doubled up on my BDNpC shares. Still underwater on my small amount of common

I would not hold JAVA shares here, since if the takeover does not materialize,
the situation will be tough for Sun. But then there are other possible suitors,
so you can win too.

Hi vireya. Until last summer I'd say all of my portfolios (ira, taxable, Roth)
were 99% stock. I owned and my wife owned, very few bond funds or preferreds
compared to my stock holdings. That's changed with the down market in all my
common stocks. I now have several bond funds, preferred funds, preferred
issues.

When I take an exploratory position or make my first initial buy of a common
stocks it's always less, much less, than 1% of my portfolio's total worth
(which includes now a substantial bond and preferred component). I might bring
a common stock up to 5% of my total worth with subsequent buys. That would be
rare for me.

I have a bond fund to which I've committed 7% of my largest portfolio. I might
go 9%. I also have a couple of stocks that are in the 4-5% range. They got that
way though not because I bought them up to such a high (5% for me) percentage,
but rather because of appreciation and I just didn't trim the position.

I generally keep more than 200 positions. Many of them are in the same sector
and their stock movements are often correlated. So for example, I ask - myself
- what's the difference in risk or results or effort for me between either
holding 4% of the portfolio in one integrated oil company that I've picked out,
or of having smaller positions in a cluster of them, e.g. MRO, CVX, COP, BP,
OXY, TOT, REP, etc., each bought when they looked attractively priced to me.
With their total in my portfolios, being maybe 4-6%.

DryShips Announces Letter of Award for a Contract to Employ the Leiv Eiriksson
for 3 Years With Petrobras
Thursday March 19, 8:39 am ET
http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/090319/0483344.html

From the article: Drys "...announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary
Ocean Rig ASA has received a Letter of Award from Petrobras for a 3-year period
employment contract for exploration drilling in the Black Sea. The 3 year term
includes mobilization, disassembly and reassembly of the derrick structure for
transit through the Bosporus Strait. The contract is expected to commence in
direct continuation from the current contract with Shell. The contract value is
approximately USD 630 million including an estimated 60 days of mobilization,
disassembly/reassembly of the derrick structure and an incentive bonus of
8%..."
===============================================================

We are starting to see CapX money to be deployed by the integrated oil
companies to develop their deep drilling offshore fields with new rigs and the
support services required to maintain them.

I have my eye on several companies including
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FLR,AGCY.PK,HAL,SLB,BHI,RIG,DRYS,SFL,ULTR&d=s

The key will be to find those companies that directly benefit from the offshore
oil field development, have a significant percentage of their business in
providing the various support services or companies that lease the very
expensive offshore rig platforms and are selling at a significant discount to
BV.

RIGs, Drys and SFL lease these multi-billion dollar rigs (Drys is the most
leveraged with huge debt), Ultr and AGCY provide specific offshore services and
FLR, HAL & BHI are very large diversified (both onshore & offshore) development
service companies.

Are there any other undervalued companies that fit this theme? Please post.

Hi Jurgis - I think the article that Spekulatius posted overstates the actual
shortfall. Here is another site that provides a slightly different view of
their liability and shortfall. I was surprised to see that the "actual"
shortfall was that small ($ millions rather than $100 of millions). Look at the
% Assets/Liability calculation.

From the Web Site - Your Pension Health

"...We analyzed Form 5500 data for the 20 largest single employer plans
(company plans) and the 16 largest multiemployer plans (union plans), as listed
by a major financial magazine....".

http://www.knowyourpension.org/pensions/pensionplans/43_pensionplans_2004_05.as
x

Their data is lagging, so based on the S&P 500 decline YTD, the actual value of
Total Assets might be lower than the amount reflected in their table.

I think that pension liabilities are something to watch for the future but
their shortfall might be overstated especially if the S%P 500 reverts back to
it's mean long term value and growth rate. It's possible that we could see some
one time payments by a few of the companies with shortfalls. A one time expense
might impact earning but not significantly enough to tank the company's per
share stock price (ie. greater than 20%).

Speaking of oversized dividends, has anyone looked at NLY and CMO lately? I
remember getting killed on CMO 15 or so years ago....the former CEO had the
kindness to put out a putrid press release after 6 PM on a Friday evening, and
that's never a good sign.
Are these two outfits in the sweet spot now in terms of leveraging increased

I'm holding a few NLY shares.

The company makes its profits from the money spread: "At December 31, 2008, the
weighted average yield on assets was 5.03% and the cost of funds, including the
effect of interest rate swaps, was 4.08%, which results in an interest rate
spread of 0.95%." So if/when the 'interest rate swaps' increase, the spread
lowers (I presume), and profits decrease.

Regarding default risk, the money spread is all on guaranteed mortgages (if I
understand correctly): "As of December 31, 2008, all of the Company’s
Investment Securities were FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA mortgage-backed securities and
Agency debentures, which carry an actual or implied “AAA” rating."

The company is reducing its leverage: "Leverage at December 31, 2008 was 6.4:1,
in comparison to 8.7:1 at December 31, 2007 and 7.2:1 at September 30, 2008."
This should make the company less risky, although maybe also less profitable.

I see today's announcement that the dividend has been maintained. I bought my
shares a few months ago at about today's current price. If stock falls closer
to yearly lows on no adverse news, I may take a few more shares. If stock
doesn't go anywhere, I am hoping that that will turn out okay with me- trying
to be satisfied hoping the 13-14% yield continues.

TWX - anyone following the cable (TWC spinoff) story? Looks complex to me so
maybe an opportunity. TWX post spinoff looks pretty good (better than before) I
think due to debt reduction.

Credit Suisse has a good report on the timeline and the expected outcome. Right
now it looks like each share of TWX has approx. 2$ value in terms of TWC shares
in it until March 27 when those get paid out and TWX will do a reverse 1:3
split. So after that chore TWX should trade at 16-17$/share.

Proforma balance sheet says 10B$ in cash and 20B$ in debt left for TWX. Maybe
worth a look. I suspect a lot of TWC shares will be dumped after March 27.

EKS. About:
"Are there any other undervalued companies that fit this theme?"

Okay, try these additions to the ones I've already mentioned to you.

HLX. May or may not be undervalued. I believed it was at higher prices. Not so
sure now. Execs are buying now though:

How about air transport to and from the offshore facilities. I have BRS for
that. They have a mandatory convertible out too. I hold shares in that also.

Hmm, I read it. I have to think about it. Nothing really jumps at me and yells
"buy". ;) All companies losing money or having no business at all, or losing
money. Did I mention losing money? ;) Not that serious big huge S&P and Dow
companies are having profits. ;)

Don't take this negatively, I'm just kidding. I seriously need to think whether
any of these are worth a dip.

BTW, activist shareholders have been hurt bad in this crash. Almost everything
I owned or followed with activist shareholders is down down down. :( So, I find
it hard to bet that activist shareholders in these cash-rich companies will do
better.

I'm not so willing to buy any either. I have several cash-rich companies (stock
selling below cash) and they have been, and are, doing lousy. Perhaps worse,
I've bought some stocks that have declined to where they now sell at their cash
level. On their list of ten, I have a miniscule few shares of SOAP, and a few
shares of TRID (held from the $4-6 area to today's $1.47). I likely won't buy
or add to any of these on the list. Even the author(s) of the article don't own
any.

I have assumed that something would help at least some of the cash rich stocks
I have - an activist investor or company making a buyout offer; the company
itself returning money to stockholders; business results improving. Nothing
seems to have helped any of these companies' stocks though. Perhaps it's just
the current market environment. Maybe some of these stocks will rise if the
stock market improves. I have my doubts though.

what is more interesting to me is that Dodd first of all said that he didnt
know anything about the bonus issue. Now it turns out that a. there was a
clause in there initially but it was removed by him at the behest of 2 low
level treasury people, according to Dodd. b. AIG greased the palms, oops i
mispoke, made campaign contributions to of many of our top politicians
including Obama Dodd Biden McCain. Dodd should be out of there too. I believe
that the big story here is how the US taxpayer went on the hook here for a
couple of hundred billion dollars, who made that decision, how was it made, and
was it really neccessary. It seems like most of the beneficiaries of the
bailout were not major us banks as obama alluded to in one of his off the cuff
interviews but Goldman Sucks and foreign banks, so why did they do it? the
reward for failure if you are a capitalist which all these anti union banks
profess to be is bankruptcy not a taxpayer bail out.

Well, there are exceptions. KONG has doubled from at-cash lows, but not due to
its cash. Rather Nokia venture fund invested in it. Surprised me, I never
considered KONG to be cutting edge company, actually my fear was that it was
falling behind in its services. I did not participate in the move.

Maybe you can also consider WH's dividend and subsequent pop a good return of
cash to shareholders.

But you are right, mostly it has been as bleak in the net-cash land as in the
other market. On purely net-cash, I only own ACTS. I also own some Chinese
companies that I bought for business but which are trading at net-cash by now.
GU for sure, maybe some other ones.

I guess I think that, just perhaps, the folks we elect should do us the
courtesy reading the laws that will control our lives. After they do that
perhaps they should spend just a moment or two understanding the consequences
of the law that controls our lives.

If they don't read a bill they should not vote for it. If they don't really
understand a bill they should not vote for it.

Although the superiority of our elected officials (I live in MA ... and we sure
have the best: Kennedy, Kerry, Frank, ... The Big Dig, ... now shooting for
highest gas tax, highest tolls, highest auto registration fees, etc.) cannot be
questioned, even they could barely read a 500 page bill in 8 hours much less
understand it's consequences.

Why bother with them at all if all they do is what they are told to do by their
staff or 'masters'? Better to have a benevolent dictator.

Way OT: "Better to have a benevolent dictator" - perhaps. The problem is really
that dictators are very very rarely benevolent. Singapore is close to being a
single example (and not pure dictatorship either). I am sure there are people
who bitch about it as much as people do about US government.

re AIG. I doubt the campaign contributions have much to do with it even though
it is ironical that some of the biggest shouters (Dodd) have received the
largest contributions. Big influential companies like AIG tend to contribute to
just about anyone who has or is bound to have influence.

I agree that the AIG bankruptcy would have been cheaper in hindsight but he Fed
could not have known in back September. if they had let AIG fail, they would
have had to ringfence the fallout (which is worldwide) or the panic would have
been incredible.

How do you ringfence a $2.6 trillion derivatives book all at once? It would
have been utterly impossible. The folks who talk about BKing AIG as a "cheaper
alternative" don't seem to grasp what was at stake. Beyond that derivatives
book, the consequences of multiple simultaneous BK's among most of the world's
financial institutions would have brought the world economy to a halt.

The fact that so many people gleefully ignore that basic fact just amazes me.
Uncle Sam let AIG do some really awful, dangerous things. Now we are paying an
awful price trying to clean it up without a meltdown.

Hi Paul

Re: HLX The share price is selling off its recent highs around $30/share but I
noticed that there were several different long term debt facilities created
recently which they have been using to finance their development projects. A
large portion of their secured and unsecured notes were placed when their
project valuations were priced much higher. They appear to have sufficient
future cash flows to service and pay off this debt as long as Oil & Gas rates
remain in the $60/bbl and $6/cpm range.

At least that was where the rates were when they obtain the financing.

A more recent private placement was made using a convertible preferred series
(issued when the common was selling around $15/share). The private placement
party has subsequently converted all of their preferred into newly issued
common shares early this year. (
http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/helix-receives-redemption-notice/story.as
x?guid= {743DB0FF-572D-4901-8072-BFB4F0DB7FE0} )

That's a positive to me as the current stock price seems to have discounted the
common share dilution. The company also split their shares 2 for 1 on
12/31/2005 (at that time the share price was around $30/share post split).

Helix Energy Solutions Group In (NYSE: HLX) is selling at 40% of BV and the
analysts estimates for next year are between $1.00/share - $1.33/share down
from $2.50/share only 60 days ago. That makes their forward PE around 5 (seems
low when compared to other companies in the same sector like Oceaneering
International, Inc. (NYSE: OII) at 10 PE). I like their book of business and
the company's specific service niche (deep water oil & gas services). The stock
has broken out above its 50 DMA ($5.00/share) this week but on average to lower
volume (not very good).

I have it on my watch list and might start an exploratory position if there is
a check back below $5.00/share. The options market are paying $1.25 for January
2010 $7.50 calls, so there are expectations that at the current price the stock
is 60% undervalued. I believe that if Oil & NG prices stay at current levels
(or higher), HLX could trade back to $10.00/share which is the next volume
accumulation level. The stock sold down from $30/share to $10/share in October
2007 when the price of oil dropped off a cliff.

I am encouraged that the insiders are buying at current levels too.

Acergy SA (ACGY) ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ACGY ) which you mentioned
earlier this month as another company in the same sector is up over 40%. I like
this one too but am not able to buy a foreign stock very easily through Schwab.

EKS, thanks for the HLX review.

For another idea, fwiw, I'm entering http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CKH for a
just a very few shares now.

http://www.seacorholdings.com/aboutus_bizlines.html

Seacor's been profitable every year for past ten. P/e 6; sells below tangible
book value (per SI numbers). Relatively (to itself) low p/s ratio. ltd/e ratio
is .6.

Company is so diversified in niches that I can't get comfortable understanding
the specifics of the parts or how each might perform in future:

http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/090217/0474911.html

I'm going mostly by the numbers and my expectation that when totaling the
performance of the company's segments, overall company profitability will
continue.
