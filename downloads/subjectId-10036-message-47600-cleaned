What do you think of gold producers now? I did not see where a second round
should be started and only have one so far. If you have more new opinion thank
you.

This was your message.

re NEM (53$), ABX ( 43.6$) - these gold producers start to look like decent
value with strong balance sheets and PE's less than 10x. Any preferences
regards either ABX or NEM?
I think NEM has a better LT track record but it seems like ABX is slightly
lower production cost/oz. (ABX ~500$/oz, NEM, 560$/oz). I am thinking of
starting a first round of buys at current prices or a bit below. I think they
may also serve as a portfolio hedge, and while gold will not respond if I
fondle it, these stocks pay dividends.

of Gold roughly stayed the same. I noticed that earning estimates at yahoo have
come down significantly. Athe two reports that I have seen (CS and S&P) have
estimates north of 5$,while the consensus has fallen to 4.8$/share. Before I

Two posts and you start already complaining that co-tailing our picks does not

As for NEM, I thought my post was pretty clear that I did not add yet and I
explained why. If I believe that information is out there, that I am not privy
to and that the market has not have digested either, I will not add unless the
valuation is absolutely compelling. In NEM case, the earning estimates for NEM
have gone down by almost 10% during the last 30days and I need to understand
why. I think we will know on 4/27 and I will rather hold out a few days until
the new information is public. I think buying right now before earnings is an

re AIR - decided to take a pass on AIR.
- increased government exposure, airlift ops could be vulnerable to budget cuts
- that glitch that you stated is a bad omen since they just acquired that
business as I understand it. Did the prior owners skip maintenance so now AIR
need to catch up with deferred maintenance? There is a possibility that the
prior owners goosed the earnings by deferring maintenance costs to get a better
price. This may or may not go away over time.
- somewhat of a less of focus, with leasing ops, manufacturing, airlift. These
are all very different business and my concern is that management may drop the
ball (more than they already did).

BIG. Yes, very rough day for Big Lot shareholders. What's also troublesome (to
me)is the large insider sales that preceded the company's announcement. Here's
a Forbes article that discusses that:

http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2012/04/24/a-very-fishy-smell-com
ng-out-of-big-lots/?partner=yahootix

I have held a Big Lot position of varying sizes for many years, if not decades.
I added to my position today in the $36, $35 and $34 areas as stock fell. I
intend to continue to hold. The stock is among the cheapest of the discount
retailers, and last year BIG was willing to put itself up for sale (looking for
over $40/sh). In past, the company has recovered from its troubles either by
changing store mix (closing stores), changing product mix, or changing
management. The company has a low d/e ratio, and that may be helpful in giving
the company time and resources to improve.

I'm figuring I'm going to wait at least a couple more quarters to see what
progress the company is making to restore its earnings growth and investor
confidence in management and the company.

I'm not saying my time with the stock has given me great knowledge or insight
about the company. Rather, It's just that I've been with BIG so long that I can
give it a couple more quarters, and I'm willing to up my position now when the
company's hit a roadblock. Perhaps for other people, maybe yourself, the stock
might rightly be considered dead money at best. It may be that the fall in
share price will continue tomorrow. Or in future if BIG continues to stumble,
disappoint, and/or show that its management (by selling its stock recently) is
not aligned with shareholders. Because of these possibilities, I'd not
recommend the stock as buy for others now. And maybe for very disappointed
people already in the stock, perhaps the correct or best decision is that it's
time to just sell and move on.

re BIG - I have put this on my watch list. I agree that it's cheap and the
balance sheet does not have any LT debt, which is good. I have never owned
these Dollar store stocks because I have a hard time relating to this business
concept and why people shop there. it seems that the shame factor is fairly
high to shop there or even to own the stock :-) and I admit of shopping at
Walmart quite a bid and I have owned their shares a while ago.

I do think that KSS is interesting and I believe their stores are well run.
Barron's had a story on them recently, their margins stayed good and all they
need is decent some store sales to get earnings really growing.

NikhilJog, re gold producers

<blockquote>Gold producers - THese guys get the gold@ USD 500/600 an ounce
while the metal is trading at $1600.</blockquote> The disparity between the
performance of the metal itself and the producers of gold (which is essentially
a leveraged bet on gold) are what caught the attention of value investors. So
far, the disparity only get's larger, gold itself essentially stayed put, while
the gold miners have fallen.

Gold miners have been trading at elevated valuation ratios relative to other
mining companies for a long time but that is no more.

FWIW, NEM may have other issues that have caused a revision in earning forecast
(rising costs, the Peru mine that has been delayed? )that I want to learn more

I'll add a bit to my losing position in HES also.

The way I look at it, HES's stated bv has steadily marched up from $15/sh ten
years ago to about $55 now. During that time, in only one year ('03) has the
average p/bk been below 1 (It was .83.) Right now the stated b/pk number is
about $52/$55, again under one. From '02 to '08 d/e has come down to .33, where
it's remained.

The company has exploration opportunities, and I suspect and I will bet, that
HES will produce, and that stated bv will continue to increase and the p/bv
will move up beyond 1. So I'm a holder and a buyer now.

If one is looking at insider sales, there have been some substantial (imo)
multiple insider sales in February in the $61 area. In my view that's somewhat
offset by a relatively small buy by the insider controlling person, Mr. Hess,
of 25,000 shares at $54.79 in the previous month. Possibly a good sign that
buyers now can come in and get shares under what Mr. Hess recently paid.

Stock about .9x stated bv. Often in past the stock has traded at 1.2x stated b.

Anecdotally KSS stores around us are newer and that's a plus. They have two

20%-30% coupons all year round, we just don't go there to use them. Merchandise

re HES, I am likely to add more after reading the CC transcript. The earnings
miss, while significant, is partly due to heavy investment and to lock in their
Bakken acreage for production. They also invest huge amounts of money in
infrastructure - a rail terminal station for and pipelines for crude in the
Bakken (500M$) and a NG separation plant (500M$). The rail station has a
capacity to move 50k brl/day. Both are nice assets that could easily go into an
MLP once fully operational.

Rather than stated book, which is based on historical cost, I like to value E&P
based on proved reserves and HES is somewhere in the range of 16$/brl, which
sounds awfully cheap with crude around 100$/brl. And this does not even take
into account the acreage, pipeline assets, rail terminals, marketing assets,
gas stations and refineries that HES owns. No question that it is cheap based
on the asset value but there is a question if and when they can unlock that
value.

re DL.AS, somehow this stock is cursed for me. Stock starts to drop as soon as
I buy it. I decided to sell at a sell at a very small loss.

I believe my thesis that the rising tide of liquidity from the ECB lifts all
boats is probably wrong. Apparently what is happening is that the PIG banks are
borrowing at the ECB bank at Libor (~1%) and buying sovereign bonds of their
home nations.

I guess they figure that if their home nation defaults, they are toast anyways,
so they can as well load on their own sovereign debt and collect a 5% spread if
it works out. Probably not more risky than lending to small business in their
respective home countries and more liquid too. Of course this does zilch for
the local economy.

Even funnier, the French and German banks are selling the sovereign debt, while
the banks located in Pig countries that are already up to their eyeballs are
buying more.

GSOL:

Some thoughts:

- It's possibly not a sham, since NASDAQ halted the shares for info request,
but then restarted them and the stock did not crater. No busy-bee short reports
either AFAIK. Not much Yahoo board activity either for some reason - no
pushers, no shorts, mostly silence. Even the NASDAQ halt yielded only 2-3
messages. Boring.

- It's still listed in Bermuda, so financials are somewhat suspect. (I seem to
remember times when we only had to doubt Florida company financials, then came
Bermuda, then came China... ;)). We'll have wait for 2011 20-F to come out for
full view.

- "Our China Global Sources Online website, which we launched to facilitate
trade in mainland China’s domestic market, is generating very little revenue
and may not ever be profitable." - this suggests that they are not a fraud,
since they don't hype their stuff...

- Balance sheet is clean (assuming we trust it).

- They bought back 24% of their shares at $9 per share in 2010 for total of
~100M. I guess I vote for "not a sham". :) But shares are now trading for $6.2,
so it's not clear that it was great use of capital if they don't buy shares now
when they are 30% cheaper...

- Merle A. Hinrichs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer - founder. Founded
the company in 1970 in HK. Holds 44.4% shares. This may be good or bad. He is
69. I think he intends to continue, so probably no sale of the company.
Probably no going private either.

I am not sure it's great that they use a lot of contractors (>90%) for content
development and sales. It carries quality risks. Their website looks OK, but
not supergreat.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-sources-provides-financial-expectations-09
000512.html - this is a bit interesting. I understand Europe being soft. But
they argue that US is soft too. I wonder if they are detecting softness that
others are missing (i.e. China/US are gonna collapse in Q2?), or they are just
masking their own problems by blaming global economy. It's an issue if they are
indeed masking their own problems. My guess is that perhaps their services are
less needed with a lot of connections already established. I am not sure
though.

- Depending on share price GSOL may become a PFIC. Trade/hold accordingly.

I might buy a tracking position.

re KSS - i don't think that the debt level is too onerous at this point. They
bought back a huge amount of shares last year but that will slow down to about
1B$, which is a little less than the free cash flow (1.1B$ in 2011). Dividend
is about 270M$, so there will be a small increase in debt this year too but
nothing substantial.

Essentially their depreciation is equal to their investments, so they are in
steady state operating mode.

Their business model is to operate cheap - cheap standalone locations, low
operating costs and they are pushing their own store brands. Their same store
sales took a 10% hit in the great recession and heave been steady since at
~220$/ sqft, which is much less than a good mall location sells (>300$/sqft)
but then again their locations are much cheaper to rent. the problem with these
mall locations that most of the good economics accrue to the mall owner, not
the stores themselves, via rents, so i like KSS business model.

KSS owns about 35% of their stores and the rest is leased. I think they do a
good job with e-commerce and using it to drive traffic in their stores. We
bought a few things online and I felt the deals were good and their website
works well too. I am thinking ~45$ would be a good entry point for the stock
and I would be a likely buyer there.

happened to notice that in the article's summary page, which listed the stocks

and yet among this group there was also something with the symbol "GSOL" --
which seemed like an odd symbol or an anomaly among all the other symbols I
saw. I didn't know that symbol, and I must have ignored it or passed on it, or
missed it back in '07. Anyway, this time I wrote "GSOL" down in my notebook,

and decided GSOL fit my criteria for a small bet for a small cap value stock.

Jack O B, BDX is a tough one for me to come up with a clear opinion. I hold a
few shares. Some of us here were buying in early '09, and I was one. I have
sold some of those shares in past six months. Possibly because I just got tired
of holding and I've been afraid of giving up much of my gains in the stock as
the stock has dropped from highs of the year. Possibly also because I wanted to
raise some cash for other opportunities.

In some ways the stock fits for me for a value buy (profit margins, p/sales).
On some other measures, it doesn't (lack of growth in stated book value vs.
current p/e, increasing d/e ratio).

I've not been following BDX -- the company and its business -- very much at
all. That of course reduces my confidence in what's happening now and in future
with the company. Which in turn, accentuates the likelihood that I have sold at
the wrong time.

I notice now my last purchases were for a few shares @ $75.23 on 5/13/10 and
then a very few shares (just a touch more) @$69.72 a month later. I believe
I'll make a note that if the stock does drop a few points or so below my
$75.23, that I might want to buy a few more shares.

For you though, I guess if I worked for the company and knew it's history and
planned on holding the stock 5, 10, 15 or more years, then yes, my opinion
would be that I would start to buy shares here at current price and also begin
to reinvest dividends.

All jmo, and I've been wrong, many many times.

all about retaining acreage with minimum required drilling to continue to hold
the leases.

Also coat tailed a few of you fellas yesterday with a purchase of CJES @ 17.68.

NEX.PA - 38Euro is an European cable manufacturer that is absolutely getting
hammered.

Looks like it's trading below stated (~1.9B Euro) and even tangible book (~1.5B
Euro ?), it's market cap is only 1B Euro. Loss in 2011 was due to restructuring
charges. Latest news don't sound that bad to me:

Canadian Oil Sands Limited (COSWF.PK)

Sold my COSWF in the taxable account and booked a small gain. I have already
bought a similar position in the IRA (unfortunately at a slightly higher
price). I plan to use the proceeds to add to my HES position. Given the recent
sell off in the stock, I am going to wait a few days to see if there might be
some more frustrated sellers.

There seems to be too much agreement on HES at the current price, I wonder if
we are missing something?

feel is at or near a bottom (I'm following T. Boone Pickens here).
I didn't do great in depth research on NFG. What sparked my interest is that is
diversified within this industry, pays a nice dividend which has consistently

Hi Wallace - For those that did not see the write up on National Fuel Gas Co.
(NFG)
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=NFG&ql=1

From the report:"...National Fuel Gas Co

<u>Company description </u>

National Fuel Gas (NFG) is an integrated natural gas company that produces,
transports, distributes and markets natural gas and oil. The Company produces
natural gas from about 660 billion cubic feet (bcfe) of proved reserves out of
the Appalachian Region and the West Coast. NFG's distribution business provides
natural gas and transportation service to roughly 732,000 customers in western
New York and northwestern Pennsylvania through its utility, National Fuel Gas
Distribution. NFG s interstate natural gas pipelines and storage assets provide
service to customers in the surrounding utility territories.

<u>Investment strategy </u>

We rate NFG Buy with a $57 price target. We estimate that the Firm's Marcellus
acreage could boost long-term production levels to ~20-30%+ per year. The
company's regulated business lines (Pipes & Distribution) bear no direct
commodity price exposure and serve as a balancing point with respect to overall
risk exposure. We currently give the company full value for the Marcellus and
assume around 7,000 locations. We do not give the company any credit for a
potential JV

<u>Valuation</u>

We rate NFG (NYSE: NFG) Buy. Our target price is $57p/s, based on the averaged
value of the following valuation methodologies:

Our NAV calculation results in a target price of $76p/s. We estimate that the
gas distribution business is worth ~$1.3bn based on total rate base of $1.035bn
(New York and Pennsylvania) and a 1.3x multiple. We value NFG’s E&P business at
~$5.4bn, which includes proved reserves of 935Bcfe, but affords no credit for
probable and possible reserves. We value natural gas reserves at $1.85/Mcf and
Crude Oil reserves at $18/bbl. We also value the flowing Marcellus production
of ~120mmcf/d at $12K per flowing mcf, a total of ~$1.4bn. In addition, we add
~$1K for 735K acres in the Marcellus (adjusted to exclude the developed
portion). We value the Pipeline & Storage segment at $1bn based on 2012 EBITDA
of $130mm and an 8x mid-cycle multiple. We believe the Energy Marketing
business is worth ~$25mm based on 2012 EBITDA of $5mm and a 5x mid-cycle
multiple. Our DCF Analysis results in $57p/s using the company's weighted
average cost of capital.

Our long-term P / E analysis results in a value of $48p/s. We base our analysis
on 2013 estimated earnings. In order to account for the company’s various
operating segments, we value the E&P earnings at a 20.8x multiple, the Energy
Marketing earnings at 8x and the utility earnings at 13x. All our earnings
multiples are based
on mid-cycle earnings multiples.

Our EV / EBITDA multiple analysis values NFG at $49p/s. We value the E&P
business at $2.2bn based on a 5.1x 2013 multiple on $439mm of expected EBITDA.
We value the other consolidated 2013 EBITDA of $388mm at 7.8x to get an
enterprise value of $6bn, of which we subtract ~$1.2bn of debt for an equity
value of $3.9bn....".

fairly valued NG plays and nibble at some of these others I have missed.

re OMG - stock looks cheap but after the Vacuumschmelze acquisition, they now
carry a fair amount of debt. I believe they overpaid for the Vacuumschmelze

It is strange that all the stocks in my "Material" list seem to have issues -
CLF, NEM, OMG, MTRN , the agricultural types like MOS, POT, BG and to a lesser

Most of them are at the beginning of supply chains so they get whipped around

ORBT-Going to be a Great Qt coming up-Orbit International Receives Follow-On
Award for U.S. Navy MK 110 Signal Data Converter (SDC) Valued in Excess of
$5,758,000
8:45a ET April 27, 2012 (Business Wire)

Orbit International Corp. (NASDAQ:ORBT), an electronics manufacturer and
software solution provider, today announced that its Electronics Group has
received a new base contract award from a U.S. Navy Procurement Agency valued
in excess of $5,758,000 for its MK 110 Signal Data Converter ("SDC"). This
award was received by the Company's Integrated Combat Systems, Inc. ("ICS")
subsidiary located in Louisville, Kentucky. The U.S. Navy has placed its
initial order on this contract with a task order valued at approximately
$1,050,000; an additional award is expected shortly for approximately $547,000,
for a total of $1,597,000. Additional orders for the remainder of the contract
are expected later in 2012 and in 2013. Deliveries of all units under this
contract are expected to commence in the third quarter of 2012 and continue
through the end of 2013.

The MK 110 SDC is a major configuration item of the GCS MK 160 MOD. It includes
custom fabricated enclosures; Commercial-Off-The-Shelf and Non-Developmental
Items components, which also are designed to meet the most stringent U.S. Navy
operational systems requirements. The MK 110 SDC is to be deployed on DDG 51-78
as part of the AEGIS Modernization Program and is operationally integrated with
the 5"/54 MK-45 Gun Mount systems.

Julie McDearman, ICS's Director of Engineering and Logistics commented, "We
greatly appreciate the continued trust shown by the U.S. Navy in our
experienced team of engineers and logisticians. The MK 110 SDC is the AEGIS
Modernization Program's version of the MK 119 GCSC that ICS has been supplying
to the U.S. Navy since 2001. This order demonstrates our continued partnership
with the customer."

Mitchell Binder, President and CEO of Orbit International commented, "We are
pleased that our Electronics Group continues to receive orders not only for its
legacy hardware but for new equipment as well. Our backlog at March 31, 2012
was in excess of $21.1 million and this MK 110 SDC order should further
increase backlog at April 30, 2012. This new order well positions ICS and our
Company as a whole for continued strong operating performance in 2012."

Orbit International Corp. is involved in the manufacture of customized
electronic components and subsystems for military and nonmilitary government
applications through its production facilities in Hauppauge, New York, and
Quakertown, Pennsylvania; and designs and manufactures combat systems and gun
weapons systems, provides system integration and integrated logistics support

"ORBT-Going to be a Great Qt coming up-"

The essential point for me is that it's a small company that seems dependent on
government contracts.
Which makes for erratic corporate performance: note profits last year, this
year (and perhaps next year). Prior three years were losses though, and in
years before that there were profits.

Certainly possible the stock could again double from current price. For me, at
current price there's not enough margin of safety that I see. I note the 10%
beneficial owner has made repeated sells last month.

So I'll pass. Jmo, although I've been wrong many, many times.

US/Canada agreement changed last year, Madharry, and with Canadian

There is that tax withheld though if stock is in a USA taxable account.

Withholding rules and amounts vary by country. For example with French stocks,
the withholding tax is 25% if in ira, but "only" 15% if your French stock is
held in taxable account.
============
Yes, agree, almost impossible to get the taxes back if they are held in ira. I
have heard some people say there is a form or forms from the Canadian
government that allow for this, but have never heard of anyone successfully

Re:SEB

I somewhat agree with you that they own a slot of shipping assets that
integrate well w/ their operations (only invest in their fleet to support their
other operating divisions) and do not use too much if any debt when updating
their fleet assets. In fact, much of last year's free flow cash was used to
finance some major upgrades in their fleet.

That said, it's a matter of deploying that free flow cash and at least last
year, a very large percentage went into their shipping fleet. That cash could
have been deployed in other more specific AG ventures like hog farms,
purchasing more of Butterball Turkey or even some ventures into other grain
mills located around the world (India, Africa etc).

The company is still selling close to BV on my last check but per share
earnings and FCF for 2011 was disappointing to me and missed my expectations
(not sure what if any analysts follow this company). As a result, I had a
pretty good gain and closed out my position in SEB and booked my gains. Their
dividend is tiny compared to CAG , ADM or even BG. I also closed out my
position in ADM and booked my gains but continue to hold BG and CAG (Note: CAG
has the best dividend of the group).

This was part of reducing my AG basket exposure by 20% in April 2012. I think
both ADM and SEP can be had at lower prices (or at least before I buy them). I
agree with you that for SEB, when you look at their shipping assets as a
percentage of their total assets it's large so one could make the argument that
the company should be priced at a lower PE to reflect this. On the flip side,
it makes their other divisions more profitable when you look at the entire
package.

In general these AG companies (even the diversified ones) still are impacted by
commodity prices and even w/ hedges, falling commodity prices tend to impact
EPS to the negative side. I think the next 24 months prices will be flat to
lower so only those AG companies that can provide a significant value added to
the end products produced will EPS be higher. Of the companies I watch, BG may
be the best candidate as they own processes that do add a lot of value to the
end product.

Therefore, as BG shares fall, I am more apt to buy this one of the group.

FWIW, my goal is to increase my stock turnover rate to under 24 months than
36-40 months. I do not have time to wait out the cycle holding these stocks
and/or hold during a down cycle. I will sell now (book my profits) and look to
re-enter later if the value proposition is there.

TTEK update.

Hit 52 wk high last week. It's still trading at very reasonable multiples.

Looking at it historically, TTEK has managed to eke out growth in earnings
averaging in the mid teens or better for at least the last five years. They
have successfully offset the decrease in U.S. govt. spending by increasing
their revenues and earnings from international sources as well as U.S.
commercial sources. The stock is up significantly this year and so is the U.S.
stock market. I think going forward TTEK is well positioned regardless of what
happens with the U.S. stock market in general.

Their website offers a wealth of information. Start with presentations found
under Investor Relations at
http://www.tetratech.com/

TTEK offers advisory services and does not have the costs associated with
delivering infrastucture services. They offer knowledge and therefore the
margins are pure profit. The need for their knowledge base is just becoming a
necessity. TTEK deals with solving water problems. People need water and they
assure that when you turn on your tap, water will come out. TTEK provides water
solutions to California, Colorado, Brazil and Afghanistan. Additionally, they
are also involved in water solutions for the mining industry. There is a good
presentation on their website on this. Mining has increased its impact on the
environment and therefore has increased the need for environment protection
services that TTEK offers.

Earnings report is coming up in the first week in May. I like this stock going
forward. Institutional investment has been solid, insider interest has been
lacking. Lots of analysts follow this stock but probably due to the heavy
competition, TTEK has not received much press.

TTEK has almost no debt, so it is in a good position to expand growth by
acquisition as it sees fit, but however management chooses to go forward, they
have established a good platform to build on.

re IR - sorry for my sloppy English - i do have an excuse though - it's not my
first language. FWIW, I posted 3 or 4 times around August 2011 about IR - at
that time, it did not seem that anybody was interested in the name, which goes
to show that stocks that get little interest are not always the worst
investments.

Right now at ~42.5$, I don't think that the stock is all that cheap. For one
thing, the business does not have the same kind of quality, than UTX or PH and
ETN for example, so it should trade at a discount relative to those names. IR
also has a history of overpromising and underdelivering and a mixed track
record with acquisitions.

They do pay a lot of interest (~280M$/year) for their 3.6B$ in debt, I assume
that is because the debt they took on with the Trane acquisition is pretty
expensive. If so, this interest expense should drop , once they refinance.

make it up in the remainder of the year. Volatile earnings are just part of the
business, so BG should not be judged based on their last quarter, imo.

Furthermore, a significant part of the margin comes from trading, (which is
facilitated by the assets they own, like grain terminals, logistics assets,
storage assets) and sometimes their hand is good and sometimes it's not.
Cargill is pretty much in the same boat and they had a poor quarter as well, so
it's no surprise that BG is not doing great either.

In any case, BG is a decent but not a great business. I think I'll put my land
in the sand at ~ 60$ as a pricepoint to buy back my shares.

Hi hoyasaxa

Re: Voyager Oil & Gas, Inc. (VOG)

I have been selling off my high priced shares in VOG taking some small losses
and have gotten my
average cost down in the low $3's. I eventually plan to add to these and my
other E&P shares (of my 8 surviving companies in my E&P basket). I decided to
keep this one as they still have good land holdings in several of the U.S.
shale producing regions including the Bakken area.

Here is the most recent (April 2012) investor presentation:
http://a.eqcdn.com/vyog/media/f7a4cba9889991f8fb60ae4e3fa14f96.pdf

Pg-13- 2012 Production Forecast – Accelerating Growth; company is in their
accelerated growth curve phase. Translation- spending lots of money to bring
more wells on line.

My take away from their most recent presentation is they own lots of mineral
rights on a lot of acres with an average per acre cost at $7K/acre. Management
states that compared to the other companies that have operational wells in the
areas where they own property, their land is worth a lot more 2x or 3x. To
drill those wells, the company must start spending big bucks which either
dilutes the share base (ie selling more equity) or taps their $150M credit
facility (more long term debt). (Note: That credit facility could finance 18-20
new wells max which is a big bet on their success and/or failure)

Management claims they are a low cost driller at $7M/well which for me is
average but a lot depends on access to their land and Bakken has several areas
with difficult access.

When I started buying shares in the company, they were essentially raising lots
of capital and buying all sorts of land interests with very little well
development. As time went on and money was being spent down, shares were
diluted even more and drilling results were just average to poor (which is the
nature of the business). Therefore the stock has dropped in price accordingly.

That's why I take the basket approach to buying shares in these small E&P
companies. It's hard to pick just one that hits a home run and then determine
when it's time to get out.

My plan is to fill my E&P basket up by 25% over the next 6-9 months with shares
from the list below.
http://goo.gl/WWgon

I still think some of these companies can fall further in price but VOG below
$3.00/share and AXAS at current levels would be where I might start nibbling if
I had no current position. For me it's really a time issue as I think the lows
in Oil prices will be in the Sept-Oct period (similar to last year), so I am
just waiting before I add any more shares.

If you can get in at a good value price Bakken is definitely an area you want
exposure in. If you look at pg-6- of their presentation, they list the larger
companies (less risky) w/ exposure in Bakken. HES is one I like a lot and have
bought shares in last week. HES could be a 30% winner while VOG could be a
multi bagger (on the upside and/or downside if their wells come up dry).

re VOG - always interesting to see these presentations and cross check it with
what the competition is saying.

First, VOF doesn't operate their wells, which means that they are not in
control of their Capex (the operator determines when and how the well is
drilled). They have option typically not to pay for their share but then they
lose the well and the right to land around it. Only 25% of their land right now
is held by production, which means that many more wells need to be drilled and
VOG has to pay a share of their Capex. My opinion is that VOG has to raise more
money in debt and equity.

Second, their wells yield 600brl/day, which is less than the 900brl/day that
HES is reporting. I take it that HES has better acreage. FWIW, VOG reported 9M
in well costs (including completion) while HES reported around 10M$, which
seems to be in the same ballpark.

The table in P8 shows the land acquisition cost for several companies operating
in Bakken and it is clear for example that HES with 4200$/acre cost and some of
the highest well flow rates got a great deal.

One I owned before a long while back which I rode through some wild ups and
downs (I believe I may have broken even) has gotten crushed again. It's a very
small cap with ticker MXWL.
Above average balance sheet IMHO, and may be getting punished too harshly for
apparent lackluster results/guidance.
I don't know if anyone here follows or knows anything about Maxwell.
It might be worth a flyer as it lurks near 52 week lows.
No position, but it's on my watch list, maybe just as a trade.

re NEM had a narrow earnings beat at 1.17$/share. Production was flat YoY and
cost were below expectations (620$/oz, 20$/oz less than expected). the big news
was that the Peru/Conga project (800M$ in sunk costs, I believe) may not get
off the ground. I think the cost focus is good but the production growth is
more uncertain than I thought a while ago.

Thanks for your thoughts on IR. I'm on the fence and not sure what I will do
with my shares. Despite the recent run, the stock is still down over the last
52 wks. And yes, they have a history of not meeting expectations, but they have
beaten estimates for the last three Qs. And if you look at their recent
presentation, available on their web site under Investor Relations, the company
is modest going forward.

You're right about the debt payment, but they are paying it down; an specially
large debt payment was made earlier this month. And they have managed to buy
back shares at an opportune time.

Div. increase is likely, so I think I will wait till the div. increase is
announced to take profit unless I find something better to invest in and I need
funds. Right now I have 20% of my folio in cash which is unusually high for me.

It was the most attractive choice for me. Whether it was the best choice, only
time will tell.
I pulled up a ten year chart, the dividend has been increased every year. If
that history holds, the next dividend declaration should increase, I'm guessing
by a penny a quarter. Not a huge increase, but still a positive if that
happens. Coverage is more than adequate, S&P predicting $2.60 earnings for '12.
With Gabelli involved, that helps in the due diligence process.
I also like that it is involved in a variety of complimentary businesses in the
energy field.

SVU -- sold it this morning, earlier than I planned. I have been waiting for a
dividend announcement, but it has not come yet. Also there was a downgrade this
morning. The next catalyst for SVU will be next earnings announcement which is
still way off, and the dividend. There should be no problem with the dividend
unless there are some debt covenants that interfere. No time to look for those.

Hi KyrosL -

Good positioning on SVU. The company will still be around later and no rush to
stay in the stock especially if most of the easy gains have already been made.
I still hold shares but was able to sell some shares at the $6.60 level. Will
consider replacing those shares in the low $5's as long as their business
remains on track.

I look forward to your update on Greece when you return. That and Spain should
be a good baramator on the condition of the EU. Spain at over 25% unemployed
with the youth taking the brunt does not bode well for their long term economic
growth . It will be interesting to see if you hear any chatter about Greece
leaving the EU (at least from the residents there) since I believe it will be a
gain for the general public and a loss for the banks.

Have a great trip.

I continue to hold (and buy a bit sometimes) PWRD, GAME, CYOU and GRVY (not

best growth. GAME is probably the most likely to be taken private (by SNDA).
PWRD was/is the cheapest + they now have US businesses that may be positive or
negative dependent on results. GRVY is still huge-cash-hoard + potential RO2

Cop-WI- bought a bit of COP-WI today. I was surprised that the PSX part
(refinery, midstream, chemical) has such a substantial market cap assigned to
it and subtracting that the E&P part looks cheap.

Their proved reserve base looks as follows|
~3.5B BOE in crude
~3.5B BOE in NG
~1.5B BOE in heavy oil

The E&P par will carry about 20B$ in net debt and there ar 1.264B shares
outstanding, so EV is about 90B$ at a 55$ share price.

BreitBurn Energy Partners, L.P. (NasdaqGS: BBEP) - Started new position in IRA
http://www.breitburn.com/
MDU Resources Group, Inc. Commo (NYSE: MDU) - Peeled off 50% of shares in IRA
ALGONQUIN PWR & UTIL (Other OTC: AQUNF.PK) - Peeled off 50% shares in IRA
http://goo.gl/HrpO2

A few trades in the IRA account to start what I feel is a value Buy in BBEP.
According to my EK$ calculation BBEP is 15% undervalued. The EK$ fair value is
$22.10/share but their is a small EPS history especially w/ their recent
acquisitions.

BBEP owns and operates natural gas, oil and midstream assets in Michigan,
Indiana and Kentucky, including fields in the Antrim Shale in Michigan and New
Albany Shale in Indiana and Kentucky, transmission and gathering pipelines,
three gas processing plants and four NGL recovery plants. Their transmission,
gathering pipelines and NG processing plant infrastructure holds value for me
as I expect many of these smaller operations will eventually be consolidated
into larger operations.

The value lies in their pipeline easement agreements that are worth a lot more
to a very large operator especially in the regional areas BBEP operates in.

To fund the transaction I sold positions in MDU and AQUNF. MDU is selling at
their higher price range and I believe I can buy shares 20% lower. AQUNF
although a good dividend payer (4.4% yield) does not provide me the growth and
dividend potential that BBEP does. I have a 10% capital gain from my original
buys in 5/2011 which is pretty good for a water treatment utility. I still
maintain a small position in the portfolio that will allow me to track the
growth of the company.

Just at the brink of continuing its uptrend pattern from Aug 11. May be
