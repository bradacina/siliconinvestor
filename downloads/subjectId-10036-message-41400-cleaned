Hi Spekulatius -

I still own NOK and look forward to the new management making significant
changes to their current business model. The MSFT deal is not exclusive to NOK
so I also see NOK providing Android based machines to expand their product
offering(s). NOK is rumored to enter the tablet market which is going to be a
large growth component for them in the future. They still own 30% of the
smartphone market and are a low cost manufacturer.

That said, NOK must build platforms that utilize the Android OS. The software
is open source and free. They must capitalize on the Android Market and drive
new revenues from selling company developed apps.

The MSFT deal is going to have higher upfront costs to the end user as each
phone will require an OS license fee which is not required w/ the Android OS.
They are entering this market just to help maintain their market share and
probably can port some of their apps to this platform. It's a marginal new
revenue proposition at best.

I recently purchased an Android Tablet-Gtab by Viewsonic (w/no contract). I
have been playing around with the different ROM's based on Google's open source
Android OS developed on the XDAdeveloper's site(
http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=841 ). I have come to the
conclusion that most everything you can do on a PC can now be done on a smart
phone and Tablet using the Android OS.

In fact, I am using my Gtab to stream IPTV to my 42" LCD (via HDMA cable) and
view HD movies (eg Netflix), HuLu shows and live sports (ESPN3-
http://espn.go.com/espn3/ ) over my home WiFi connection. I axed my cable
service about 6 months ago. This is all accomplished using Android OS and cloud
services over the internet.

I think the big winner in all of this will be Google. NOK should do ok if they
build their devices that leverage the Android OS (maybe also MSFT to a much
lesser extent) and look to derive their profit from new software apps. Cable
and conventional TV broadcast models will also be loosers IMO unless they
develop their own content.

Nvidia is benefiting with their dual core low powered chips much more than
Qualcom's snapdragon chip(s). Nvidia's next generation quad core products will
surpass current desk top PC processing technology and surpass anything Intel
offers in this segment. My GTab has a Nvidia Tegra II chip and w/ it's built in
video encoder provides 1080P output as good or better than my desktop system
that uses a separate Nvidia video card.

All of this computing power in a smartphone & Tablet can be powered w/ a
battery that last over 10 hours w/o a charge. My current desktop requires a 200
watt power supply just to drive the video card.

It's a huge growth market but the new money will be made w/ all the new
software apps and the required bandwidth to deliver all the content.

i dont look at markets as a whole but in AUgust and Sept. of 2010 i made my
first purchases ever of megacaps like IBM ans GOOG and I still think they are
very cheap on just about any metrics. many of the chinese stocks also look very
cheap because of the fraud concerns. I own several mining entities that seem
very cheapn in relation to the current market cap of their holdings- aab.to,
cmpzf, als.to. if anything iwould say that financials ans bonds are in cukoo
land rather than equities. I wonder how many foreclosures are going to be
happening and who will be maintaintaing these properties once the deadbeat
mortgagees are forced out and what cost. I think we have easily lost an entire
generation of homeowners betweeen the people in their late 50s who were laid
off and saw their 401k plans devastated, and people in their mid to late 20s,
instead of moving into well paying jobs are either unemployed or underemployed,
and saddled with student loans and credit card debt. I would be very curious to
see the numbers on just how many people are now living rent free, while the
banks figure out how to foreclose legally.

Hello Jurgis,

I'm positive (though less so than I was 3 months ago) on CSCO in general after
doing more research over the last few days on this last earnings report, but
I'm curious as to why you don't think it's cheap until the 16's? Have you
attempted a DCF analysis on CSCO? My quick ones imply to me that CSCO is
undervalued at current price levels.

What I see is that CSCO is not doing so well in its legacy product lines, but
its services business is growing (with strong margins). And new product lines
are growing at a pretty good clip.

I guess my overall thesis is this:

CSCO is not a $300+ Billion value company anymore. It's closer to $100 Billion,
and less if you back out some of the cash. To me, without growth, it's current
cash flows justify at least it's current valuation and I have confidence that
CSCO can leverage it's brand name and technology to achieve growth in new
product markets.

That being said, I don't see CSCO doubling in value over the next five years.
My view is more that it should be worth $22-$24/share right now. It could (and
probably will) go down here more, but I see the downside more limited than the
upside.

So, in this market, where I have little cash, I'm considering rotating some of
my higher beta names that may be a bit toppy into more CSCO to play for a
potential bounce in the medium-term with less downside when we correct.

So, I believe CSCO is a decent place to park money these days in this market,
but I'm not pounding the table either.

Thanks,

Grant

I agree that GOOG as a stock is not expensive but it's not particular cheap
either AAPL is not particulary expensive either but my main point is that it's
fairly easy to beat the market with 3 stocks for a short time, it's not so easy
to beat it for a long time - all it takes is one real bad pick and you are out
1/3 of your capital.

FWIW, GOOG is doing a lot of things right - their applications like Google
Voice, Gmail keep getting better and now they integrate them with Android - so
if you have an Android phone, the synergies make these applications more
sticky.

I used to be a yahoo fan for a 1-way stop (email, calendar) but find myself
migrating to GOOG applications because they are getting better while YHOO is
just staying put. For example I am still using yahoo's classic email because
their update introduced 2 years or so ago, still freezes often. I Yahoo will be
obsolete in 5 years.

GOOG Android is a huge winner with cellphones, I own a n android device and I
am pleased with what it can do. It' no Iphone but it does come reasonably close
for a much lower monthly cost. This move to Android becomes none to early
because users a shifting to mobile devices (Cellphone, Tablets) and those that
are only offering PC based applications will loose market share. I see this as
a major risk for MSFT, INTC and YHOO.

of course its ridiculous to own a portfolio of 3 stocks for a long period of
time however for me at least in my taxable accounts i am trying to to own
stocks for the long term and cornerstones there there are goog ibm and slw.
Bear in mind that in taxable accounts you really have to compare buy and hold
strategy against your additional cost of portfolio turnover- if you have to pay
20% capital gains every two years on your portfolio as opposed to holding for
10 or 20 years makes a huge difference- especially if you die!

Hardly a day goes by without me being impressed with the impact of goog on my
daily life- Trying to catch up on my WSJ reading I read an article about some
guy from goog who played a key role in the egyptian activism, then the friday
journal has a big article on animation which emphasizes to me the global reach
and influence of youtube.
How clever an acquisition did that turn out to be?

If I think about my deficits as an investor/speculator it seems that that I was
too hopeful about one product, thinly capitalized companies making it, and on
the other hand not giving nearly enought credit to larger companies benefiting
from innovative new products that they can use to piggyback their existing
business onto. Disney and Apple have been spectacularly successful at this .
Microsoft not so much. I would say GOOG and IBM are doing pretty good so far.

I agree about the Android smartphone risks to INTC, MSFT, and YHOO, though I
still hold MSFT. I recently upgraded my phone to an HTC EVO Shift at Sprint
which runs on Android. I'm amazed at how much I can do with this phone and how
for some internet tasks I prefer to use it over a computer.

From a business standpoint, MSFT and INTC still will do well as I can't use
Office effectively with my phone. I think the risk is that homes that used to
own 3-4 computers with Wintel, could get by with 1-2 and some smartphones.

From a Windows Smartphone standpoint, I was very disappointed from a MSFT
shareholder perspective to see how Android and Apple are dominating things from
a marketing perspective at least. I looked at a variety of phones at a the
major phone companies and I don't think I even considered a Windows Smartphone
if I even saw one.

re Smartphones - I agree that Smartphones are surprisingly powerful. I think
they will supplement rather than cannibalize Computers and there is a chance
that players find synergy in the two - well Apple does this already and Google
to some extend too. I do think that the new Android based tablets will
cannibalize computer (especially netbook) sales. They can do a lot of things
better than a netbook (watch streaming movies/TV), play games and a great if
you want to be mobile. They are a "consumption device" mostly but that is what
most people do on the internet nowadays anyways.

Windows Mobile seems dead on arrival, although it is not a bad GUI per say,
there are very little apps for it. Without apps, an operating system is
worthless. I see no way how WM7 can catch up with Android and Apple.

Grant,

Using Buffettology spreadsheet, expected return on CSCO right now is about
11.5%. I don't buy stock using Buffettology criteria unless the expected return
is at least 15%.

Owner's yield (Earnings / EV) is about 8.5%. This is not bad (in a buy range),
but not great.

Sales only grew 2% in last 3 years, earnings dropped 5%. Based on this I am not
sure what growth rates we can conservatively assume going forward.

So let's say you assume 10% growth for 10 years - a hugely, enormously
over-optimistic assumption - the DCF valuation at 15% discount rate is ~83B
which is way lower than current market cap.

So really the company is not cheap using almost any metric.
The only metric that looks good is 8 year earnings growth, which is something
like 23%. But do you really believe that CSCO can repeat this?

If you look at MSFT all the numbers are so much better (except 8 year earnings
growth ;)). So if I had to buy a tech megacap, I'd buy MSFT. In fact, I did
even though I am not a huge megacap fan.

Hello Jurgis,

Thanks for the reply. I won't pretend to be an expert in DCF analysis, but I
know enough to be dangerous. :)

How are you incorporating the Current cash at CSCO and/or Net Debt in your
calcs? If you get $83B at a 15% discount, that would be below the current
market cap of CSCO, but above the market cap - net debt...

Thank you,

Grant

I don't incorporate cash in DCF or Buffettology calculations. The reason is
that both are looking at 10+ year results and it pretty much assumes that this
cash will be needed to achieve the results - whether for acquisitions or cap
investment, etc. You could make an argument that CSCO could distribute the cash
to shareholders right now and still produce the same cash flow / earnings
growth going forward. I disagree.

I went to http://trefis.com and played with their model. I am not affiliated
with Trefis, but I think they have pretty neat tool to play with (you may have
to register, free tool is available for limited set of companies, etc.)

 Note that they are using DCF, but they are predicting a "fair value" to which
the stock should rise based on their model. They are NOT doing the classical
DCF which gives you a price at which DCF would exceed the discount factor.
Their price ($24 in case of CSCO) is a TARGET price, classical DCF price is a
BUY price. Don't mix the two, the values they produce are not directly
comparable.

So I changed parameters in their model to yield the classical DCF results,
changed some values and got the price $16.37. This is classical DCF BUY price,
i.e. if you buy below $16.37, you will get ~15% return. I think even these
assumptions are a bit optimistic, but it jives well with my other calculations.
;)

Not sure if this link to my model will work, but I will post it anyway:

Hello Jurgis,

Yes, your link works. Pretty neat application, I agree. I think that you and I
are on the same page with CSCO except that I'm factoring in CSCO's cash. If you
added $4-$7 in cash right now to $16.37, you'd be in my ballpark.

I understand your reasoning for not doing that, but my general reason for doing
so is to incorporate a balance sheet impact in my analysis. Two companies with
the same future cash flows should have different valuations if one has a great
balance sheet with a lot of cash, and the other doesn't.

But, everyone has their own analysis techniques. That's what I'm doing these
days. I will probably change to some degree down the road if/when I take a big
loss on something with a lot of cash! :) I appreciate the discussion...

Ah, but you did not notice that Trefis accounts for cash, so $16.37 number is
with cash. :P

Perhaps I was not clear: I did not account for cash in my own DCF and
Buffettology spreadsheet; it is accounted for in my modified Trefis model; it
is also accounted for in E/EV ratio.

Good point. :) I haven't used Trefis much, but I see what you mean that you
have Cash figured in there.

In examining this more, I think the difference in our perception of where CSCO
is cheap is that I'm not necessarily looking for a 15% return per year. When
I'm jumping into a large cap/low beta name like this, I'm really aiming at
somewhere between 11-15% per year, with the idea that:

1) If I'm buying Large Caps/Low Beta names, I'm probably looking towards a
correction and that this is a safer play than others.

2) If perception of CSCO is bad, I will monitor the stock price and take a
quick gain in some situations.

So, I think if you had my expectations and put your discount at 11%-12% instead
of 15%, CSCO might be cheap to you also. But, I understand trying to aim high
for 15% returns.

Thank you,

Grant

Billionaire Paulson Cuts Citi Stake, Shuffles Bank Bets

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Billionaire-Paulson-Cuts-Citi-indie-4030124681.ht
l?x=0&.v=1

From the article:"...A look at Paulson & Co.'s top-15 U.S.-listed equity
positions across all of its funds from the end of 2010 shows that Paulson was
upping his exposure to energy names, while shuffling positions in the financial
sector. During the quarter, Paulson opened a new position in offshore driller
Transocean (NYSE: RIG - News), while upping a position in Anadarko Petroleum
(NYSE: APC - News).

In the financial sector, Paulson increased stakes in Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC -
News), Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF - News), and SunTrust Banks (NYSE: STI
- News), while trimming stakes in Citigroup (NYSE: C - News), Bank of America
(NYSE: BAC - News), and Hartford Fin Srvcs Grp (NYSE: HIG - News).

Elsewhere, Paulson left his massive SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD - News) position
unchanged in the fourth quarter, while selling some Anglogold (NYSE: AU - News)
and holding steady in Gold Fields (NYSE: GFI - News). Paulson also upped his
stake in pharmaceutical firm Genzyme (NASDAQ: GENZ - News), which is being
pursued by Sanofi-Aventis (NYSE: SNY - News)....".

-------------------------------------------------------------------

There were some rumors that BHP was looking at Anadarko Petroleum (APC) for an
acquisition based on the natural resource assets they owned.

In the BHP earnings report today, they did not rule out another big acquisition
but stated nothing was definite. BHP did announce a large share buy back
program (they added $10.00 Billion) indicating that they could not find any
other large investments for the use of their capital other than buying back
shares.

Maybe Paulson knows something more than you or I about Anadarko Petroleum (APC)
and that's why he has been upping his position.

I'm fine with volatility in net-net and microcap type situations where market
prices bounce around much more than any change in underlying company
fundamentals. As long as the basic business remains sound, I have few worries.
Price volatility leads to great trading opportunities , and if prices go down,
I am happy buying more.

However, stocks that are heavily dependent on macro factors (such as miners)
tend to result in some heartburn for me. A company's prospects can go from
great to poor depending on the global factors beyond my control/understanding.
This is especially true if the company has a lot of debt. I am usually not
inclined to step up for large positions in those cases.

My top 10-ish positions in no particular order: NRF-A/B, UVIC, IDCC, EBIX,
GFRE, GILD, COPJF, DRAGF. Changes in top-10: MHR-C - out

New positions: PTNR, GPS, BBD, EGY, ARY, AFSI
Positions increased: NXY, SDTH, AXS, MSFT, TPCS, AMGN
Positions reduced: NRF-A/B, MHR-C, GPOR, UFPT
Positions eliminated: SOHU, RIMM, FR-J
Flip-flops: ESTE, CCME

This was pretty active time for me.

In fixed income area, I have sold remaining FR-J, reduced NRF-A/B as they
climbed up and sold a bunch of over-par MHR-C. Not much is attractive in fixed
income right now, but I decided to dip a toe into MCsweet's ARY.

I flip-flopped into and out of CCME with minor gain. I decided that I don't
like our old friend's ESTE's results and sold my position after buying at lower
prices a week or couple ago.

On the sell side, I sold SOHU that has become richly valued. At least premier
Chinese companies still provide nice returns. :)

I sold RIMM due to uncertainty in cell phone business, although they may
benefit from disastrous NOK decisions.

I sold some more GPOR. Every time I sell, it goes up. ;) Maybe it will fall
when I sell my last shares? ;) People can probably find out how big percentage
I left on the table so far. Ah the Internet never forgets. ;)

UFPT - I said that I was not very psyched about it at $11... Shoulda bitten my
tongue, since it started running up next day or so. Almost double in month and
a half. Now I sold a bit just so it does not get into my top 10 positions. :)
Getting fairly valued here.

In oil area, I bought some more unloved NXY and restarted my EGY position after
two and half years. Not much has changed, has it? ;)

I bought an exploratory position in PTNR. Not very exciting company, definitely
with political risk and some leverage.

GPS has been discussed here by Paul Senior. Pretty nice valuation. In for small
position right now.

BBD - Brazilian bank discussed here. I don't particularly like banks, but I'll
dip my toe for exploratory position.

AFSI was suggested and discussed here. I still don't like the P/Book ratio, but
results are so far solid, so I bought a position.

Increased positions in SDTH, AXS, MSFT, TPCS, AMGN based on valuation.

IMHO MSFT is a great way to play NOK's "conversion". If it succeeds, which is
very unlikely, MSFT will benefit a lot. If it doesn't, MSFT does not lose much
either.

TPCS - a US small cap that looks remarkably like Chinese small cap. Oh, they
even have a subsidiary in China. No wonder. Well, at least people will find
someone to sue if a fraud is discovered. Apparently so far the management is in
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. If I was them, I'd get airline tickets and
Chinese visas asap. :P

prudent to wonder whether an islamic democratic middle east will actually cause
more harm than good from our perspective.

Regardless, the level of instability and ignorance about what is actually
happening is enough to make me bullish on crude. Market volatility seems likely

Hi Paul -

I have been thinking about types of 2nd derivative "value" investments that
would take advantage of all of this E&P capital sloshing its way through the
Bakken oil shale states. Basically it would comprise the mid west states,
specifically North & South Dakota.

One name I came up with is Investors Real Estate Trust (IRET) - Dividend yield
around 7.7%. This is a diversified REIT company that owns different types of
properties in the Bakken oil shale region.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=IRET+Profile

They own multi-family residential properties and commercial office, medical,
industrial, and retail properties located primarily in the upper midwest states
of Minnesota and North Dakota. As of April 30, 2008, the company operated a
real estate portfolio of 72 multi-family residential; 65 office; 48 medical; 17
industrial; and 33 retail properties.

If you reinvest your dividends through the company's DRIP program, you receive
a 5% discounts on purchases.

From their Web site:"...Through IRET Direct, you can reinvest your
distributions at a 5% discount below the market price for our common shares on
the distribution payment date...."

http://www1.snl.com/irweblinkx/stockinfo.aspx?iid=107231

My value proposition is (1) property values have probably bottomed, (2) the
local economies should be doing better w/ more money coming from E&P capital
investments and (3) the company buys a lot of their properties with cash and
little debt.

Their debt to equity is just over 50% on their properties and their payout
ratio is still high over 100% (it has to be since it is an REIT). If you think
real property has bottomed, then it might be a good time to accumulate a
position.

They do have a history of a high percentage of "Return of Capital", which when
added to your 5% share discount on their DRIP program will reduce your overall
cost basis substantially.

http://www1.snl.com/irweblinkx/GenPage.aspx?IID=107231&GKP=203007

Therefore most of your gain will eventually be a long term capital gain (when
LT shares are sold) and hopefully taxed at a lower tax rate than typical REIT
dividend income.

Hi 7 Years -

Re: RAM Energy Resources, Inc. (RAME)

Here is an article posted on the Big Dog's Boom Boom Room titled: Jeffrey

Source: George Mack of The Energy Report 02/15/2011
February 17th, 2011

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27176956&srchtxt=rame

From the link:"...Chad Mabry: Sure. Just to talk about one of my names that we
recently moved over to our top picks in our preview piece is RAM Energy
Resources (NASDAQ:RAME). It's a value name, and it's a stock that really hasn't
participated in the recent rally. One of the things it's been doing over the
past few months is addressing its high leverage situation. The company has
divested a number of non-core assets, and these were pieces of the portfolio
that were more gas weighted. They were non-operating assets for which the stock
really wasn't getting much credit. It was able to use proceeds from those
divestitures to pay down some of its debt load and, in so doing, high grade its
asset base by increasing its oil weighting. RAME's trading at a 2011 EV/EBITDA
of 5x–6x. One of the intriguing potential catalysts in the near term is a
shallow oil-exploration play at its Osage Concession. It's a Mississippian play
in northern Oklahoma that the company's been pursuing for the past year or so
now. It really is just at the first stages of having some initial results,
which could really get the stock moving here.

TER: Chad, you said it's a value play, and indeed it has trailed its peers over
the past 52 weeks.

CM: To retrace some of the steps over the past 52 weeks, the stock has seen a
fair amount of volatility. The company did announce it was pursuing strategic
alternatives, and it got a little ahead of itself for a while as investors
priced in a takeover last year. That didn't transpire, and it corrected a bit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

They still seem to think the stock is a value play and as oil increases in
price, their future development projects should add even more valuable assets
to the company.

The link also has some good comments on two other E&P companies:

<u>Rosetta Resources Inc.(NasdaqGS: ROSE ) </u>(mentioned by Paul Senior) and
<u> Gastar Exploration Ltd New Ordi(AMEX: GST ) </u>another one of my holdings

Re: Emerald Bay Energy Inc. (EBY.V)

I am going to pass on this one. The company has a bit too much debt for their
current revenues IMO. Even with their recent success using new technologies to
optimize the flow rate in previous unproductive wells, they continue to lose
money. That's not to say once they get ramped up to optimize the 10 new wells
in their recent license with PRI they could be marginally profitable.

The main problem I have is the company is maxed out on their revolving credit
facility and it is unclear to me how they will finance their 2011 capital
budget to do these new projects. They are paying prime plus 2% on their
revolving credit facility now and the new incremental production does not even
cover their debt service even with the higher Oil & NG prices.

Therefore, the value proposition is in their 25% ownership in PRI and their new
well optimization contracts w/ them. They are going to need a JV partner w/
deep pockets to help finance this new project.

They surly will not be able to do it by issuing more stock at $0.06/share less
filing fees.

EKS

P.S. One well optimization company that is doing the same thing and is quite
profitable is <u>Lucas Energy, Inc. </u>(LEI), They have announced some new
deals, have very little debt can raise money by issuing shares in needed (only
24 million shares out) and/or can utilize their credit facility and most
recently an insider announced a 6% position in the company around the current
price.

The company has shown they can be profitable on each new incremental deal they
proceed on w/o adding any significant debt. On their Feb 2011 presentation they
have NAV of proved & probable reserves valued at $5.98/share up from
$3.79/share as reported April 2010. ( see

LEI the net asset value of 5.98$/share contracts their assessment of PV-10
value (not sure if it's pre-tax or post tax) of 47M$ versus the 32M$ market
cap. I assume then difference is with the warrants (there are quite a few out
there).

They state on another slide that the EV value is 0.7X the PV10 value. This
would lead to a NAV of ~ 2$/0.7=2.85$. If the NAV is pre-tax (I think it is

Good point about the warrants. They did show good growth from April 2010 to Feb
2011 and they accomplished this with little or no debt (perhaps that is where
the warrants come in). Also, they have some new projects that should allow them
to incrementally grow their reserves.

The big risk is if they hit dry holes or wells that kick out too much water
with the oil.

They are supposed to release the results from their Hagan Well development in
March.

I like this E&P basically because they have no significant debt. The number of
warrants that you point out could be somewhat dilutive. Thanks for pointing
that out.

Thanks for the update on LEI. In my notes, the previous presentation was 9/09.

I have a comfortable position in LEI. I've doubled it now before the close.
====================
NAV. Does it make a difference, pre or post? Only if the company pays income
taxes. I don't know if LEI does or will, given all the tax breaks that oil
gets.
=====================
Negatives are as you state, are they finding and getting oil, or is there too
much water? (Talking about LEI's au courant Eagle Ford involvement, not LEI's
prosaic work-over of old wells business)

Positives could be, per Lucas, that they're in the desirable oil section for
fracing in Eagle Ford. Lucas sold the "deep rights". Not sure for how much, if
all, or under what conditions. Not sure how deep deep is, but deep is where the
action is, and where the fracing is being done. LEI retains a 15% working
interest in first two wells. I guess good results with even 15% might be enough
to help the stock of such a small company. (Has helped the Australian shale oil
stocks.) And the structure of the deal with Hilcorp seems to be such that LEI
is not yet out of pocket (on these first two wells).

Stock is undervalued based on NAV. May also be undervalued on flowing barrels
of oil they expect to produce this year (Not exactly clear to me how many
barrels that actually might be.)

Re: Lucas Energy, Inc. (LEI)

Hi Paul - A possible Red Flag for LEI.

On Friday February 18, 2011 Lucas Energy announced the resignation of John
O’Keefe from his positions as Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer
of the Company. http://biz.yahoo.com/e/110218/lei8-k.html <u>This is the second
CFO to be replaced in one year for the company.</u>

O'Keefe has a checkered past, so it may be a positive for Lucas Energy to have
him gone (see the O'Keefe bio at bottom of post).

The one positive is that the person they appointed was K. Andrew Lai a former
employee with Far East Energy Corp. (FEEC.OB).

Mr. Lai, age 44, joined Far East Energy in January 2007 and currently serves as
Corporate Controller and Treasurer. He has also served as General Counsel and
Secretary of the Company, and will retain his responsibilities as Corporate
Secretary when he becomes Chief Financial Officer. Prior to joining the
Company, Mr. Lai held financial management positions with EOG Resources, Inc.
(EOG).

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the positive the way I see it. Mr. Lai has ties with China United Coal
Bed Methane (CUCBM). CUCBM had partnered with Far East Energy on several NG
production & gathering deals (
http://article.wn.com/view/2008/08/28/Far_East_Announces_Senior_Management_Prom
tion/ )in the past. Lai was responsible for setting up these partnerships. In
December 2010, China National Offshore Oil Corp. reported that they were
considering buying a 50% stake in CCUBM.

 Therefore, Lai brings a possible Chinese connection/partner with deep pockets
to Lucas Energy, Inc.

The CEO of Lucas Energy likes to have JV partners that will help finance future
well development deals and perhaps Andrew Lai was brought in to exploit his
Chinese ties.

Lai also had previous experience working with EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG), so he
does bring extensive industry experience to his new job.

I still do not like the idea that two different CFO's in the last year were
entrusted with the CFO job. The most recent appointee O'Keefe was hired October
7, 2010 after serving as CFO at HDY for only 11 days! His dismissal occurs only
days after the company releases their 10Q (2/14/2011) which contained some
significant one time charges and lower than expected Q4 revenues from
production well(s) due to "...inventory accounting issues... Oil that was
supposed to be transported and sold was delayed and kept in storage tanks at
the well site(s) perhaps due to a cumulative water/oil contamination problem).
This was the first 10Q he was responsible for preparing and was terminated from
the company after its release.

Therefore, I will continue to hold my small position and see if this recent
event turns out to be a net positive or negative for the company.

Hi Madharry -

On March 3, 2008 you staed in your post:
( http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=24452539 )

"...Sadly, we are caught in that stage of empire deterioration where the govt
is forced to DEBASE the currency, savvy investors are fleeing with their
capital, and our politicians are taking up the fiddle. How long before we see
prices being changed on a weekly basis to reflect the continued decline of the
dollar? Perhaps we should have a pool to determine how many months before we
see $4 gas....".

Well here it is at least in Northern California:

Gas for $4 a gallon?
Posted: 02/14/2011 05:45:32 AM PST
http://www.insidebayarea.com/timesstar/localnews/ci_17379848

From the article:"...Gasoline prices will breach $4 a gallon in San Jose at
some point in April or May, predicted Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst
at gasbuddy.com. "Diesel prices in California should easily breach $4 a gallon
in the next two months....".

-----------------------------------------------------------------

More food for thought. The IMF came out with this article on Thursday February
17, 2011.

IMF calls for dollar alternative
http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/10/markets/dollar/index.htm

From the article:"...The International Monetary Fund issued a report Thursday
on a possible replacement for the dollar as the world's reserve currency...."

"...In addition to serving as a reserve currency, the IMF also proposed
creating SDR-denominated bonds, which could reduce central banks' dependence on
U.S. Treasuries. The Fund also suggested that certain assets, such as oil and
gold, which are traded in U.S. dollars, could be priced using SDRs.

Oil prices usually go up when the dollar depreciates. Supporters say using SDRs
to price oil on the global market could help prevent spikes in energy prices
that often occur when the dollar weakens significantly...."

---------------------------------------------------------

Another reason IMO to buy companies that own in-the-ground oil reserves or own
a lot of oil related assets.

Williams Plans Split into Stand-alone Companies

From the article:"...The move will focus the original Williams on its midstream

exploration and production segment. An initial public offering for the new,
currently unnamed Williams E&P company, containing 20 percent of those assets,
will be held as early as the third quarter.

The remaining E&P assets will be part of a tax-free spinoff to Williams

Hello Spekulatius,

<FWIW, the RSH stores are franchised - not all of them are the same. I don't
like the one close to where I live but the one close to work is great. the have
a niche running in neighborhood store, with crosselling opportunities with the
folks dropping in.>

So, I'm trying to compare this to SVU as a beaten up retailer value play. One
thing I like about SVU is the amount of stores they own. It doesn't look like
RSH is really a property value play, based on your statement above and the book
value of their property, right? OTOH, I certainly like the fact that RSH has
nowhere near the debt as SVU! :)

I also like the stores in general. On one hand, I think everything in their
stores is expensive, but I tend to go there when I have an electronics problem
I don't necessarily know how to solve. I go there for help and they fix it for
me pretty quickly.

I also like their kiosk model in other retailers. I'm still in GLW as a play on
the smartphone build-out and this could be another one at a good value price...

Thanks,

Grant

BHP to Buy Chesapeake Arkansas Shale Assets for $4.75 Billion
http://noir.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aG0XnJvwxPnA&pos=2

From the article:"...BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest mining company,
agreed to buy Chesapeake Energy Corp. assets in central Arkansas for $4.75
billion in cash, entering the U.S. shale gas business for the first time...."

"...Chesapeake agreed to sell all of its interests in about 487,000 net acres
of properties in central Arkansas, the company said. The transaction is
expected to close in the first half of this year, Chesapeake said...."

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I calculate that at $9,754 per acre. Williams paid about $7,000/acre for
Marcellus shale acreage in 2010. This compares to PVA's purchase of some Eagle
Ford shale acreage in August 2010 for $4,600/acre.

CNOOC (China National Offshore Oil Corporation) is paying $2.16 billion -- half
up front, and half in the form of future drilling costs -- to earn a one-third
interest in Chesapeake's 600,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford. Ignoring the time
value of money, that works out to $10,800 per acre.

Of the recent buys, it seems like PVA got one of the best deals.

Madharry,

Regarding AAB, the press release mentioned specifically that 1.43 was not
equivalent to the company's NAV. Would you happen to have a guesstimate of what
the NAV is or whether we would expect it to be greater or less than 1.43?

Also, with 37.5M warrants outstanding at 1.00 looking close to exercise, I
would think we could get significant dilution, such that we might need to start
looking at NAV on a diluted basis (unless they already factor that in).

Thanks,
MC

Hi Paul - Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) filed a 13G today disclosing they
now own 10.57% of Gastar Exploration, Ltd. (GST). Both have operations in the
Lower Woodbine area which some experts think may be the new oil play to watch
in southeast Texas (ie another Eagle Ford Shale play).

Re: Gastar Exploration, Ltd. (GST)
Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK)

13G filed today - Chesapeake beneficially owns 6,781,768 shares of Gastar
Common Stock which represents 10.57% of Gastar’s outstanding Common Stock. (

"...According to Jefferies, operators in the vicinity include Apache Corp.

is currently drilling a well targeting the formation in north central Madison
County and three other locations have been permitted in Madison and Leon
Counties....".

Maybe a JV is in the works with the companies. Apparently both companies
believe there is significant value in this area. Gaster has completed some
preliminary wells and has identified 150 additional well locations they would
like to develop.

From their Web site:"...The Company drilled its first Glen Rose test, the
Wildman 6H in June 2010 and began drilling the second Glen Rose well, the
Wildman 8H, in November 2010. The Wildman 7H, its first horizontal Eagle Ford
well, was drilled in December 2010 and fracture stimulated in January 2011. If
exploration results are successful, the Company has identified approximately
150 additional well locations in the Glen Rose and Eagle Ford/Woodbine....".

Chesapeake must have picked up their shares on the GST secondary offering that
was just completed and was priced at $4.00/share. It seems like a good prospect
for CHK given they sold all their Arkansas shale interests to BHP this AM.

EKS, thanks for the IRET idea as a beneficiary of the development of the
Bakken. I've decided that while IRET's combination of nice dividend yield and
history of increasing the dividend and its potential stock appreciation total
up to be good, I'd rather just go with a diverse package of e&p stocks in the
area. In this, I'll assume that not all Bakken e&p companies will do well, but
the ones that do will far surpass the laggards. And overall, such a package
will surpass what IRET might deliver. Of course, more risk too by not
diversifying with something like IRET.
