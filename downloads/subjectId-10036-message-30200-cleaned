IAR drew my interest so I looked further. It seems that a whole industry
succumbs to new media. The fall of IAR competitor RHD makes me wary and RHD is
in a much better shape than IAR.

As you mentioned Hertz, there&#180;s also its large competitor, CAR / Avis
which was a part of the old cendant plus budget which they bought out of
bankruptcy a few years ago.

SIL, since they appear to have a large derivative position in Silver and Zink,
a short position in those metals to presumably offset pricing risk for the
mining assets we can only assume that they will show a gigantic loss for the
next quarter (silver has almost doubled during the last 2 month). Their mine is
not producing much due the water problem (if i remember correctly) that sounds
like it will take another 6 month to solve. I wonder if they are still liquid
by the time the mine starts. Shareholder equity is already negative and the
huge short position at some point will cause margin cause, IMO. And we do not
even know if those derivative losses are tax deductable in Bolivia.

SIL will have to raise capital (which is very difficult right now) or sell some
ownership in their mine (to Sumitomo, i presume) to stay afloat.

Hutchison Whampoa is one of the most opaque company i am aware of. it is
impossible to determine operating earnings because year after year, investment
special dividends etc. gains bury operation results. this year it was the huge
windfall from the sale of the Indian cellphone business and some special
dividend that accounted for 2/3 of the cash flow. I do know that the Telecom
arm generates huge losses and that the property/ports/hotels are nicely
profitable. My best guess is that if all special gains are backed out HW is
barely, if at all profitable. maybe that's what HW is, a conglomerate that
wheels and deals with companies. They seem to have done OK doing this in the
past and it may work in the future. But i would not be surprised if one day the
whole thing comes tumbling down.

In the current market simplicity trumps complexity. When the going get's tough
a lot of people will dump the stuff they do not understand first. HW seems on
the wrong side of that equation, IMO.

HUWHY. If they can turn around their huge telecom investments in 3-G, the stock
will do very well imo. They've not been successful though in past three years.

Yes, not possible to understand billionaire Li's balance sheet or his
strategies. Or his often gutsy (erratic?) bets. HUWHY is a conglomerate with
great assets and lousy earnings visibility.

Reminds me of Berkshire in that there are lots of core assets throwing off cash
that the company uses to invest in presumably higher growth areas and
industries.

My opinion is that people won't bail from the stock because its complicated
financials are anathema in difficult times. My opinion is that people have
generally always ignored Hutchinson because of Mr. Li and his complexity. That
I suspect (and hope), has made the stock undervalued.

I've been in the stock since '03 with a small add in '04. It's not been a great
performer. At current price and with the few shares I hold, I'm willing to add
a little more now.

Racetrack operator Magna Entertainment, the parent company of Laurel Park and
Pimlico, announced yesterday it had more than tripled its fourth-quarter loss
to just less than $43 million, and reported in its financial statement that its
"ability to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt "

The Ontario-based company, one of the major racetrack operators in the country,
suffered losses of more than $113.7 million in 2007 despite implementing a
debt-reduction plan last September that called for the sale of non-core
racetracks and other real estate holdings.

Magna, which also lost $288.3 million between 2004 and 2006, is carrying
long-term debt of $879.9 million with $209.4 million of that debt due this
year.

The company's financial struggle raises questions about Magna's position when
Maryland voters face a slot-machine referendum this November that would provide
a huge infusion of income into the state's racing industry. Maryland racing has
been battered in recent years as tracks in Delaware, Pennsylvania and West
Virginia began realizing revenue from slot machines. None of those tracks is
owned by Magna.

Recent analyst reports to the Pennsylvania Gaming Congress found that
slot-machine revenue in Pennsylvania last year reached $1.08 billion, according
to a story in the Thoroughbred Times.

Maryland Racing Commission Chairman John Franzone has called on Magna to detail
its finances at the commission's upcoming meeting March 18.

"It's almost inconceivable how [Magna] can lose that much money," Franzone
said. "Are you making mistakes at the window and paying people incorrectly?"

Franzone suggested it would be wise for Magna to concentrate fully on helping
pass the slots referendum in Maryland.

"If you get the slots and run them properly -- this ship is the Titanic now and
it will change it into the" Queen Elizabeth II, Franzone said. "That would
reverse their fortunes dramatically and allow them to gain profitability."

Magna's stock fell 9 cents yesterday, with a closing value of 79 cents per
share. On Feb. 14, NASDAQ warned the company its stock would be delisted if the
share value didn't rise above $1 by this summer.

"No one can be happy with our financial performance during the fourth quarter
of '07 or the year as a whole," said Magna Chairman Frank Stronach during a
conference call with investors.

"It's like 'Groundhog Day,' " said Tim Rice, president of Rice Voelker, an
investment firm in Louisiana. "Every quarter, the results are disappointing.
Every quarter, [Magna says,] 'We're going to sell assets and reduce debt,' and
nothing ever happens."

Michael Smith to build this company, and eventually list it somewhere. I havent

buy because the bid ask spread is always so large. Its one of my largest

Maybe we're entering a recession and things are going to turn for the worse,
but I'm still seeing hotel prices go up in D.C., where I generally do business
as an SAP Consultant. I'm also still seeing strong nationwide business for our

The owner of my small consulting company takes us to Cancun every year for a

that our hotel had less people from the U.S. than from Europe. I think the
exchange rate changes have made traveling to this side of the pond easier for
Europeans, and I think that European tourism and appetite to buy hotels has
been discounted in the valuation of these hotel reits.

But, who knows, we may go down before we go up, but I'm starting to enter

Upped my few shares of BMS today, fwiw.

This diversified packaging company is kind of a steady Eddy. S&P has a 12-mo.
target of $27 (Stock at $24.73):

"Our risk assessment reflects the possibility of
softer global economic conditions, higher raw
material prices, and difficulty in integrating
acquisitions. However, BMS has an S&P Quality
Ranking of A, which indicates historically stable
earnings and dividend growth."

S&P rates the stock as "hold".

Perhaps they'll be right. Looks like a buy to me for me though.

Stock has traded every year for past ten at least at 16x earnings. Using S&P's
'08 earning est. of $1.85, the stock sometime in next 9-12 months will hit at
least $30 (if past ten years results can be counted on again in the this, the
11th year).

If not, a buyer is still holding a stock in a decent quality company which has
increased its dividend every year for at least the past ten, and currently
yields 3.4%.

BMS - i agree that it looks like a nice safe company. and the insider buys are
a plus. here's the data i have that seems to indicate a lower PE than 16.

from corp presentation:
10 year sales growth 8%
10 year EPS growth 6.6%
10 year cash flow 10%
target sales growth 6% to 8%
target EPS 10%
target CF 10%

from yahoo:
ROE 12%
industry PE 14
EPS growth 2008 / 2007 = 4%
EPS growth 2009 / 2008 = 9%

so their present earnings of 1.73 = PE of 14.4 (at $25 price)
fairly valued, or a bit overvalued, imo.
prob a good bet, but don't expect the moon.
unless they beat their own expectations / targets.

better bets to make out there...

BMS. I'll clarify. Looking at the S&P past ten year history, the lowest high
p/e number was 16 (the p/e in the year 2000). In every other year, the p/e got
above 16. I'm saying I hope the p/e will, in better days sometime in the next
12-18 months, get to 16 or better yet again as it has in each year of the past
decade. (I am expecting no decline in earnings/sh.)

And I haven't mentioned how low the p/e for BMS has been. Looking at that, if
the p/e currently about 14, fell to the decade's low it would be at 9 (Which
occurred in year 2000, according to the S&P numbers)

Imo, Bemis is a good company now at a fair price. Yes, there are better values
out there. Every day seemingly. Still, if anyone could be comfortable about any
stock or business these days, Bemis at current price, could be one. For a small
position. In a diversified portfolio, of course -g-.

Not sure which are "values". Sold a little IGT recently just to trim position,
free up some cash. Stock at multiyear high. I believe I've read that slot
machines are a cyclical business, and we are now in the beginning of a new
buying cycle by casinos, as a newer generation of slots is being or has been
developed. So maybe slot makers will show good sales and earnings gains over
next few quarters. Who knows?

PENN confuses me. If the buyout offer goes through in the next few months, the
stock will rise. If the offer collapses, in all other instances that I've seen
where the deal gets canceled, the stock drops - usually back to where it was
before the offer was made or where buyers suspected an offer was in the works.
Sometimes the stock drops suddenly even below such a point, and then usually
(it seems to me), the stock recovers to where it was before the offer. With
PENN though, I believe the stock, near 12-mo. low, already is down to that
level. So if the offer is indeed rescinded, I am hoping and expecting that the
stock won't get killed. A retail investor coming in now is buying PENN for its
business and prospects, and gets kind of a call option on the possibility of a
fairly quick and good profit if the buyout comes to fruition.
I am considering adding to my position.

You could look at CNTY (Century Casinos). I like it because compared to others
in the sector, it has a reasonable (lower) p/e and not as much d/e. One of its
casinos is in Edmonton, which should do very well given the Alberta oil sands
boom. I like that. But it may not be relevant since CNTY is diversified with
several other casinos and casino operations.

OPMR is cash-in-search-of-a-business. They processed on-line gaming until that
business was made illegal in the USA. I find the cash/sh number attractive
given the stock price. And am hoping, of course, the management doesn't fritter
away the monies, spend it egregiously on themselves, or make an unwise business
investment with it.

EP, WMZ, I decided to switch from EP to WMZ. WMZ is a newly IPO'd MLP for WMB's
pipeline assets. it currently is trading below the IPO price of 20$ and I think
it has good prospects for distribution growth because of "dropdown" of assets
to this MLP.

I think WMB is interested to getting WMZ to a 9% yield at which point they are
entitled to 50% of the incremental earning gains 9as the general partner).

WMZ trades at around <10x EV/EBITDA which is a discount to most other pipeline
MLP,s despite lower leverage. Right now they only own a 35% stake in Northwest
Pipeline (spanning across the Rocky Mountains, WA and OR).

My notes:
EquityL
33.5M units @20 =667M$
Debt =243M$ (this is WMZ 35% share of Northwest debt)
EBITDA approx 90M$
Distribution: 1.15$/unit

I think this is a better and lower risk bet than EP which trades at 10X EBITDA
but this includes the volatile E&P segment (which usually command much smaller
multiples than Pipeline assets). I keep this position in an IRA and it's going
to be small enough so i don't have to worry about the 100$/year reporting
limit.

As I mentioned before i am very bullish on North American NG and I believe that
Pipelines are a secular and low risk growth story that is going to benefit from
much stronger NG pricing, IMO. Even if NG does not rise as expected the owner
of MLP unit's still should do OK.

Alon USA Reports Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2007 Results
Wednesday March 5, 4:15 pm ET
Company schedules conference call for March 6, 2008 at 10:00 A.M. Eastern

DALLAS, March 5 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Alon USA Energy, Inc. (NYSE: ALJ -
News; "Alon") today announced results for the quarter ended December 31, 2007.
Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2007 was ($39.9) million, or ($0.85) per
share, compared to net income of $22.0 million, or $0.47 per share, for the
same period last year. Excluding special items, Alon recorded a net loss of
($41.5) million, or ($0.89) per share, for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared
to net income of $26.0 million, or $0.56 per share, for the same period last
year.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $103.9 million, or $2.22
per share, compared to $157.4 million, or $3.37 per share, for the same period
last year. Excluding special items, net income for the year ended December 31,
2007 was $99.5 million, or $2.13 per share, compared to $138.5 million, or
$2.96 per share, for the same period last year.

Jeff Morris, Alon's President and CEO, commented, "The fourth quarter was a
challenging quarter as earnings were negatively affected by record crude oil
prices, which resulted in the worst quarter in the history of the company.
However, 2007 was the second best year in the history of the company. In 2007
we set throughput records at each of our refineries and reached new sales
levels in both our asphalt and convenience retail segments. We believe that the
overall increase in sales by almost 50% year over year is a reflection of the
potential and the future growth of our company."

Mr. Morris added, "On February 18, 2008, the Big Spring Refinery experienced a
major fire. We believe we are adequately insured and are aggressively working
to re-establish production at the facility. We are very proud of the
performance of all Big Spring personnel and emergency responders which helped
to limit the severity of injuries and damage to our equipment. Importantly, no
major vessels, compressors, or motors will require replacement. We are
currently ahead of our own internal schedule and continue to be optimistic
about returning to the first stage of operation, producing gasoline, diesel and
asphalt by the end of March.

"We are continuing to progress on our announced hydrotreater and mild
hydrocracker projects at our California refineries and expect to complete these
projects on schedule. In addition, our board of directors has approved plans
for an initial public offering related to our retail and marketing businesses
which we will seek to complete by year end. Our board of directors has also
instructed us to continue to pursue the M&A activities we are currently
evaluating. In sum, while we will be working hard to repair our Big Spring
refinery, these efforts will not lessen our focus on opportunities to further
our growth strategies."http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/080305/law068.html?.v=101

fwiw this is my proposal to the housing crisis and this would apply only to
single family homes occupied by the mortgagee. I would limit the resets to 30
year bond rate +2.5%. in cases where the value of the property clearly dropped
by at least 15%, I would reduced the principal amount to be paid by 15%, that
upon sale of the property, first the mortgage balance gets paid off, then the
15% principal gets paid off, then any remaining profits go to the homeowner.
Needless to say there wouldnt be any additional mortgages permitted on the
property unless the 15% is paid off first. I believe that this type of plan
would eliminate a lot of the foreclosures where the borrower still has a job.

WMZ pipe begins where WPZ pipe ends :-).
WPZ and WMZ have a similar financial structure - both are LP sons of WMB. WPZ
is for WMB short haul /processing/storage assets near the wellhole. WMZ is for
WMB's long haul/storage assets.

What i expect to happen is that WMB will "drop down" long haul pipeline assets
intp WMZ. the expectation is that this is going to be accreditive to WMZ,
meaning that the distribution/unit will increase. the advantage for WMB is that
it free's up capital, they still control the assets and if certain targets are
met their General partner share will increase from 2% currently to 50%. For LP
holders the advantage is that there is a low risk growth path build in (the
existing WMB assets).

If WMZ follows WPZ trajectory I am going to be fairly happy. IMO, WMZ has
languished below IPO price because they IPO'd at the worst possible time (Late
January). I do not think there is anything wrong with the assets owned by WMZ
or the LT plan.

Backcock & Brown hard asset manager in trouble ?

I think they are the 2nd largest "hard asset" manager after Macquarie in
Australia.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=BBI.AX&t=1y

Anybody willing to bet that investors are not lining up to buy more. Most of
those funds are leveraged fairly high 3:1+, so i am guessing that higher AUD$
interest rates are not favorable. Now when those funds cannot issue new equity,
the initiation fees (which are about 30-40% of BNB revenue) are gone.

I also looked at Macquairie's famous infrastructure fund and was not impressed.
they are simply resetting NAV by reducing the cap rates for the fair value of
their assets. those cap rates appear already fairly low to begin with - around
5% and sometimes as low as 4%. I am guessing that the economy, higher gas
prices and such do not matter for traffic growth on their toll roads.

BNB.AX blowing up may not matter to most here - but some were discussing BAM.
BAM in my opinion is very similar to to BNB except that most of their hard
assets funds are not traded as stock units, so the fair value is more of a
guess but i don't think that investors right now are lining up to purchase
these things.

I can't figure it out but the street definitely knows something we do not. The
student loan goodwill was entirely written off last quarter. The actual student
loans are 95% guaranteed by the US government. Transportation leases on
airplanes and rail cars are doing well. Corporate finance should be OK as is
their trade finance(factoring). They lost Dell in the Vendor finance but have
picked up others according to releases. They just priced and sold unsecured
notes to get/replace funding. Their adjusted risk spreads have been about 2.6%.
So what is out their. They keep announcing more fee income with their M%A
unit-Edgeview. I think it must be something else. A douwngrade in their credit
rating by Moodys.

For each .1% in increased credit provisions or .1% in lower spreads, this costs
CIT with 75 bill of managed assets about 75 mill. So the leverage can create
big swings in income. I called the company but got a mailbox message. I think
it is a downgrade by Moodys who had them on negative watch. I bought at 28 so I
am way down.

They keep taking more writedowns on their mortgage business . I thought they
were through but evidently not. Their bonds are not being sold for a B/R
condition.

Nothing to do but hold on.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares in CIT Group Inc. plunged Thursday after an analyst
slashed its earnings target for the lender on concerns that the company will
take a massive charge to write down its student loan portfolio.

CIT shares lost $4.50, or 22.1 percent, to $15.86 Thursday. Earlier in the
session the stock hit a 52-week low of $15, well below the previous mark of
$19.05.

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Sameer Gokhale now expects the company to earn
8 cents per sharein the first quarter instead of his previous estimate of 76
cents per share.

"We believe there is increased risk that the company will have to charge off
$179 million of private student loans made to students of a flight school which
recently filed for bankruptcy," he wrote in a note to investors.

He said the students did not receive their licenses and are less likely to be
able to repay the loans. Because the loans are private, they cannot be written
off in personal bankruptcy, he said.

the above may be why. I think all all financials should carry a warning "
Buying this stock may be hazardous to your portfolio".

Other than buying lottery tickets I dont think its advisable to put any money
into financials, insurance companies, or builders, until there is some light at
the end of this tunnel.
These companies are all pretty leveraged and its clear to me that the risk
management, if it was anything like my former employer, was a case of heavy
reliance upon rating agencies and
credit scoring. We see now that this was a poor strategy resulting in banks
following each other like lemmings off a cliff. There is now a shortage of
qualified people capable of working out these problem loans because banks have
not invested in training qualified personnel as opposed to marketers and
syndicators. I remember trying to obtain an interview with a high ranking
credit officer at Citibank a decade ago. He told me he was no longer hiring
workout officers because Citi had all their loans under control.

CIT. Writes off $179M, so earnings for quarter are negligible. Hit to book
value is then also about $1/sh. ($179M/190M sh.) Before taxes or maybe after
taxes. Still it's only $1 of CIT's stated b.v. of $34. And stock price now
about $16.

Short term pain. Longer term, company shouldn't be impaired by this. (Although

CIT, i don't think the student loans are CIT's problem
The larger problem is that they are not done writing off their mortgage assets.
The new 10k provides some more insight (the 5 loan pool buckets) and it does
not look pretty. they were able to extract 5.2B$ in cash from a little less
than 10B$ in loans so they are still sitting on 5B$ in net assets of which 50%
is constituted of loans with pretty bad looking stats (they somehow avoid the
toxic word subprime). My loss estimate of 2B$ from December 2007 still holds,
in fact it could be more than that the way things have been going lately.

Lot's of nice income producing stocks trading at about 9x EBITDA/EV nowadays.
The REIT's FCH, SHO, pipelines (WMZ and others). Those are not wasting assets
either - over the long term hotels room rates have outgrown inflation. Likewise
with pipeline (which probably have a better short term outlook.

I do not see SHO falling apart even when business is slowing down. Their
projected EBITDA (low end of guidance, CC info) for Y2008:

EBITDA: 308M$
-Interest (incouding preferred): 123M$
-Maintenance Capex: 70M$ (upper end of range given by management)
-Taxes: 10M$
-Dividends :105M$

The numbers add up. if they come out at the guidance midpoint a dividend
increase may be in order. If we are looking at a full blown recession there
will be a dividend cut unless they are willing to borrow for the payout or
skimp some on maintenance capex (management has given a 50-70M$/year range).

I added some more SHO and WMZ today. Both are now at a full position.

This has been my value-oriented strategy for Citi:
Fall,short,fall,short,fall,fall,short,short.

I almost never short stocks, but Citi has been the exception for me. The signs
were so clear months ago, and the "hope" factor in the market so high, that I
couldn't resist, and my short position has only been growing. My three tests
for going short are that rare situation where:

a) the potential rewards are so much larger and more likely than the risk of
being wrong,
and most importantly
b) there is some kind of time limit or horizon(s) at which the basic premise of
the position is tested.
c) there is some vague hope or fear involving a national/global catastrophe
that temporarily erases the facts of basic math, science and common sense.

The imaginary Y2K "crisis" satisfied all three conditions perfectly and for me
was very lucrative (anyone remember ZITL and friends?). I view the subprime
crisis the same way (with Y2K "fear" replaced by solvency "hope"). I do hope
your long position works out eventually but for now I have to follow the

Seems to me that could apply to just about any financial beginning with C-

As I see it the only problem with being short is the same problem i have with
going long. I dont know where the bottom is going to be. Do you have a
projected bottom for Citibank? I was listening to one of the few economists I
respect and he believed that about $175billion in mortgage writedowns had been
taken out of an anticipated $300 billion total. However he believed that about
85-90% of the total writedowns taken by the biggest financial institutions had
been taken because they have been marking to market. The next wave of write
downs he believes will mostly be taken by the multitude of smaller banks and
insurance companies.
If he is right we may be close to a bottom for C. This assumes that there is no
severe global recession. However, if that happens i would expect it to be
foreshadowed by a decline in commodity pricing. I have seen none of that so

from RITHOLZ:

For 2008, let's try a little reverse financial engineering: Squatting in $3
million dollar waterfront mansions in Florida and paying nothing.

At least, that's a new and growing problem we learn of via MW in South Florida.
MW is a local developer, and claims this has become "very serious" (I have been
able to independently verify this with a local resident, who tells me the local
papers are filled with such tales).

He writes:

"There is a very important phenomenon that is occurring that has only been
covered in a "glancing" manner. Beyond the concept of "jingle mail" -- which
suggests that folks who can pay their mortgages may just choose to walk away
given the dramatic loss of equity due to housing's collapse -- consider the
following: As a developer, I had stepped to the sidelines and rented beginning
in 2005, because I was sure that housing was unsustainable and was bound to
collapse; it took 2 more years for it occur.

Nonetheless, as I have followed several of the homes that my wife and I were
interested in a few years back, they are all on the market now. What is
shocking, that in each and every case, I have been told by brokers and banks
that the owners have ceased paying their mortgages in some cases for nearly 2
years and have continued to occupy these homes. Now, these are homes in excess
of $2,000,000 in the very best neighborhoods in South Florida. Brokers have
added that these buyers further complicated things by putting huge home equity
lines on top of their mortgages and now have no possibility of selling their
homes for amounts needed to cover their accumulated debt.

This may not seem like news, but understand what this means: There is currently
an 8-10 month wait to get a court date to have a foreclosure filing heard in
Dade and Broward counties. The bankers have non-performing loans on their books
to the best heeled borrowers in multi-million dollar amounts with no immediate
means for recovery; with a non-secured second mortgage in place, there is no
possibility for a "short sale" that will satisfy all of the borrower's debt.
They are reluctant to take a haircut knowing that they have the home equity
debt still around their neck and are likely to frustrate any near-term sale.

There is no clean way to sell the home that would guarantee "clean title",
hence a foreclosure is the only means to separate the property from the
dead-beat speculator/squatter. Banks do not want to spend the $50,000 required
to take a home through a foreclosure and clear the title -- only to put the
house back on the market for a deeper loss afterwards. Most likely, they have
not revealed these owner occupied defaults to their shareholders, thanks to the
sheer numbers of non-performing loans on their balance sheets, and the daunting
task of foreclosing on all of them. This is the ultimate seizure and full stop
of the market whereby everyone is standing in a stalemate. As one broker said
to me, "these bums sitting in $3,000,000 homes overlooking the water are likely
to be left alone by the banks for 2 years before the banks even get serious
about foreclosure."

So here is the difference between "walking away," these folks are doing
anything but walking away, they are sitting on lounge chairs sipping martinis
living cost free! (not to mention that they have ceased paying property taxes
and insurance). I can only imagine what this market will look like in the
coming years . . ."

All I can say is wow.

"MW" has been hearing this for the past six months. He believes both the local
and national lenders are in a state of disbelief with no understanding on how
to proceed.

If anyone has any local newspaper stories on this, please post in comments.

I think a recession is a foregone conclusion and we are already in one from
everthing I see. The economy is not going to create any jobs in manufacturing,
construction (residential or commercial) or municipal. There just isnt a demand
nor is there revenue in the case of the government.

Won't be much refinancing/equity cashout stimulating the economy either. Lets
face it, banks are not going to get burned again, so if someone wants money,
they better have the income and the equity to show for it.

I have noticed progressively less full flights during my travels which is just
a personal indicator. This recession will be closer to the 1980's style
recession then the 2000 imo. I think hotels are a bad investment right now, but
I do like pipelines and commodities (natural gas, silver and gold) and will
take a look at your recommendation

They have about 170 mill in private student loans which are consolidated which
are not guaranteed. He would not say whether they intended to write it off. I
doubt very much if they need to write it off but may increase the loss
provision.

I asked if there was any info out there to account for the drop in CIT
yesterday. He indicated the company has put out no announcemnets and he knew of
no announcement/action by Moodys or others to downgrade CIT credit ratings.

All financials took a big hit yesterday and he indicated CIT was hit more then

stocks that look so much more attractive to me. It might be there with AWI, but
I don't see it.

Jmo. I certainly could be wrong.

Thanks Paul, that helps. It seems to me they are going to drain the cash out of
it via special dividends. Supposedly it generates enough cash flow going
forward, but 200+m of the 500 they are going to pay out was from tax loss
gains. That will not be repeated. Seems that management would rather drain it
of it's cash and let it go bankrupt in the future (if that happens).....then to
sell out to a larger operator for a modest premium in the present. The way it's
trading this seems to be the belief of those involved. RGRDS - JT

AYR: Upping my position a little in this aircraft lessor.

I still don't understand the tax implications for me (i.e. the tax forms I'll
need) with this company's business structure. I do not like that. A big
negative for me.

There may be some problems with the major holders of the company - a hedge fund
and its boss. Perhaps they are in some trouble and are forced to sell some
shares. Perhaps not. I don't know.

The AYR business however seems intact. I don't see the dividend in jeopardy. (I
don't admit to seeing so well though. -g-)

At a new low today, the stock provides a $2.80 annual dividend on about a $17
stock price. That's a 16.5% dividend yield. Possibly these days most people who
could get a 16.5% increase in their stock portfolios would be very satisfied
with that this year (as we see how beat up most of our portfolios are in this
market ytd). For sure for me, I'm happy to take the yield and will consider any
capital gains as gravy.

> Do you have a projected bottom for Citibank?

Not really, unless you count the possibility of zero :-) My seat-of-the-pants
guess is 10-15 and I expect to close out the short position sometime in the
next couple of months. But all I can really do is keep watching their balance
sheet as the unwinding progresses. Also, try to examine what the effect of
ratings downgrades and any other cascade effects might be. And listen to what
my spies on Wall Street are saying :-)

AWI - I bought a starter today. I was watching the stock for a while because i
see opportunity in companies emerging from bankrupties. i very much like what I
see - the company has performed well in a difficult environment. After the
dividend is paid, AWI will have cash of 250M$ and LT debt of 385M$. Tangible
book will be 1.5B$ /26$share. Pension fund assets exceeds postretirement and
pension liabilities by 200M$.

Looking back when they operated under Chapter eleven, AWI generated about
70-100M$/quarter in free cash flow - oif course this was without paying
interest at this time. They are projecting 175-200M$ FCF. Taking the 175M$,
this is more than 3$/share for Y2008.

The management does not promote the stock, but in my opinion the quarterly
presentations are concise and no-nonsense. They have exceeded the projections
every quarter since they emerged from bankruptcy. I do not know why they did
not managed to get bought out but I suspect that the bankruptcy trust which
owns 68% of AWI's shares has more to do with it then management. A potential
buyer most likely will talk to the trust when they want to purchase the
company, as well as with management. With a 68% ownership there is nothing
management can do if indeed the trust want's to sell.

There is virtually no analyst coverage (another plus, IMO), because the company
does not need Wall street. The stock IMO is priced for very low expectations in
2008 and since this stock in a decent environment is a strong cash generator, i
really think it would be an excellent acquisition candidate for a strategic
buyer like WEB who has cash and some patience.

f***** shocked that none of these highly paid financial executives learned that
you dont finance long term assets with short term debt. I learned this and
taught this 25 years in a program for lenders. The whole prime lending thing is

Actually, in this year's shareholder letter, WEB admitted that he made quite a
few mistakes. :)

But I am mostly with Grommit on what he said. I wrote the following for myself,
but it may be useful for others, so, with dereference to Buffett, here it is.
It is not aimed at you or any other poster personally. :)

---------------------------------

- The world is not ending. If it was, there would be a reason to flail and
whine. Even then it might be better to wine and dine, but it's your choice. :)

- If you care that your stocks dropped 2% today, you are not an investor
business owner, but rather a speculator.

- If you are an investor and businesses are cheap, you don't sell them
expecting them to become even cheaper. If businesses are cheap enough for you
to buy, you buy them and not delay expecting them to become even cheaper.

- The technical break-downs, supports and trendlines do not affect the
businesses you own. Really. :)

- The FED decisions and macro events do not affect most businesses either. Same
thing about cratering of some over leveraged banks or hedge funds. If these
events affect the businesses you own, you should consider whether you really
want to own them. Sometimes you do, but then you should be ready to go through
thick and thin. :)

Another day of some cleanup in the portfolio. I got rid of DFS stub last week,
I got rid of LM today. It's probably not a good time to bail, but I don't want
to be invested with management that has troubles keeping their money market
funds at $1.

I added a bit to CRDN and CROX. I got a tiny bit of LTUS. I am thinking of
adding to ASFI and possibly AOB and CHNG.

Am doing the same (cleaning up some stocks). I too am giving up on LM. Sold
half my remaining stub position today. I have been very wrong on my calculation
of the value of that one, and have lost a goodly amount of $ with my bets on

Have a couple of more big losing positions which I am eliminating. Too ashamed

it was apparent the reason for buying would not be valid.

Company will again be issuing more stock, it has been announced. That in past

could be a long time though in this market.) And the stock is ex-div today.

Price decline seems overdone to me though. Bwdik.

I am curious what your concern would be in the market shut down for a week. Is
your timeframe for being in the market measured in that short of time. From an
investment perspective, this market while brutal in some areas (and painful) is
also providing lots of opportunities that will lend itself to future excellent
performance.

Hopefully you are not on margin or fully invested so you can take advantage of
the current market.

WLP with ugly new earning numbers and the stock down 15+%. So much about
recession proof. It also own UNH which is down in sympathy. If the new earnings
estimate is correct WLP indeed looks cheap at 10x earnings. that's a big if
though.

It seems too late to sell now after the instant and severe punishment the stock
has taken. maybe when this year is over the flatish to slightly up earnings for
WLP may not look to bad any more. I think i might add some more if it drops to
the low 50's.

I also need to decide what to do with LM. it's a comparatively large position
and my biggest loser dollar wise. I think about selling and moving on. My
alternative play AMG does not look much better, this may just not be the time
for asset managers.

You can always sell covered calls against it until it starts to recover. For
instance, you can sell the Apr 65 for 1.65 right now. This might be a good play
if you want to hold it longterm but think that it is dead money for awhile. The
risk is that stock continues to drop and all you get is the premium

ALD. I'm not sure why it deserves a premium when comparing it to other bdc's.
Maybe it doesn't. Company is taking advantage of it though by issuing shares
above stated b.v. which means there's no dilution to current stockholders. One
of the few, maybe only, bdc that now can still do this.

Stock could fall a serious amount further and then be at a p/bk similar to
other bdc's. Helping to prop the stock up though are its very good 40-year
history and its now almost 13% dividend yield.

I am buying these bdc's as they continue to fall to new lows. With ALD, given
its past history in all kinds of stock market turmoils, I'll be betting they
can weather current troubles too. Meanwhile hoping and expecting the good
dividend to hold, and that we are somewhere near a bottom with the stock price.
