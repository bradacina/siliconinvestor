Bill Wexler. I'll respond these two ways:

The ole Paulie way: A person has to do what a person believes is right at the
time. If it comes to some reconsideration as time passes and upon further
reflection, and the decision is to do something different from where one is now
- as regards how and what one is buying or shorting now - that is perfectly
okay and understandable. One must change with the (new) info. and education one
gets.

Now...the tougher response. All jmo, and I'm wrong a lot:
Bill Wexler, you are a long-term SI poster with a rather large following. You
have said for the first time in 25 years you have liquidated your long
positions and are net short. (I have to assume you're not some kid, but a
person who has a real $$$ portfolio.) A VERY strong decision in that. One
presumes carefully considered.

But NOW, NOW after some one long discussion with a value-fund manager friend,
you waiver? That is ridiculous. You still could be very right in your outlook
regarding gold and shorting positions. Nobody really knows the future. To take
such an 'all in' position, yet after one conversation maybe even only
considering changing your mind, is way odd. It just looks like either you are
impetuous in going 'all in' or really lack the conviction of your ideas, and
thus have no business going 100% in one direction. You've made a
big...huge...call and you might very well be right. (Or not) And it's only now
you have this conversation with your friend? You have got to get yourself
together, man!
----------------------
Oh well, jmo, and I'm wrong a lot. (And I have my own issues.) Maybe my first
response above was the better one. -g-

Just a note though that this is (or could be/should be) the Ben Graham kinda
thread, so Graham followers would say one ought to move between stocks and
bonds/cash in a 75:25 ratio. I.e when stocks are expensive go 75%
bonds/cash/equivalents, and when stocks are cheap, reverse: 75% stocks, only
25% others. In no case should or would the defensive investor go 100% in one
direction. (If I recall correctly from "Intelligent Investor")

Well - my "big call" was made after a lot of consideration. It boils down to my
opinion that the macroeconomic climate has made just about everything too
expensive. That doesn't mean I think it's the end of the world...but I do think
that risk premium has shot through the roof.

The gentleman I spoke to runs 10 figures of money, and we generally agree about
large themes (though we may disagree about certain stocks). This is the first
time he is on a complete opposite pole. He thinks that I'm not being contrarian
here and it's the crowd that is panic selling.

I respect his opinion so much, that I will now have to go back and triple check

re: CFC 

Bill:

Among other reasons, here are a few for my being bullish on CFC:

1. I think that Mr. Mr. Angelo Mozilo, the founder and president of CFC had
purposely orchestrated several presentations in recent months about the dire
operating condition of CFC to induce the Fed's Chairman Mr. Bernake to
aggressively lower the discount rate.

2. In fact, CFC is running a very diversified operation and it has access to
the Federal Home Loan Bank in case of emergency needs.

3. In terms of operating results of the latest 12 months, CFC had not only out
performed many of its competitors, and it had not run a defecit.

4. There may be a surprise upbeat element in the upcoming Q earning report.
Please refer:

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=23920687

5. Several outsiders, including Bank of America and Buffet, who have shown
interests in investing in the company.

Bridge Player. To me, for anybody to find value stocks, buy them, then sell
them all abruptly on a macro call, that is sheer panic and fear operating.
(Which could be a good thing sometimes)

Bill Wexler mentioned ADPT, NXG here, and these two do look like value bets to
me, so I'm in (small) and holding. These stocks have some cash value; they're
cigar butts though (imo). I guess everything's tied to everything, and if dire
predictions for the economy prove true, these stocks, already down low, might
falter further if most all stocks fall. I guess further that for a trader (and
maybe most people), a drop in price is to be strongly avoided. -g-

For me, I'll try to look 2-3 years out and try to go with the historical nature
of value stock picking. With a package of these things (assuming such like ADPT
and NXG et. al. are possibilities with a margin of safety (cash components)),
holding these in a diversified portfolio seems to me the better bet (than
selling out all but gold &going short the market). But of course, this is jmo.

Hi Paul - The "Value" portfolio is what I try to build and one of the large
components that I consider is the total dividend income which is generated.
This provides me a level of safety so if there is a significant sell off, I can
collect my dividends and wait for my stocks to come back to my fair value
targets.

I do try to maintain a discipline of peeling off long term capital gains and
building up my cash reserves in times where the general market is at or near
fair historical value. If I sold out and went into all cash, I would have huge
capital gains tax liabilities and it would take me a long time to rebuild my
portfolio to generate the high "effective" dividend yield I currently have.

The only way this long term approach works from my experience is to accumulate
companies that have undervalued or under utilized assets that either appreciate
or maintain their value over time.

The difficult part is to find the hidden value opportunities during the stock
screening and company research review. I have found that different "value"
themes develop out of larger macro economic disruptions. In the 90's it was
undervalued real estate hidden in corporate balance sheets. Today it is a mixed
bag of good and bad debt, $US dollar denominated assets which are falling in
value and company owned resources (below & above ground) that is in demand from
a growing global economy. For example, I believe natural gas is currently
priced significantly below it's longer term fair value (perhaps as much as 50%
- 100% undervalued). The difficult part is to identify those companies that own
these assets and can capitalize on the appreciation without stumbling into
other non profitable lines of business.

Money management is key too. I never use margin and always maintain a large
cash reserve that can be deployed when special situations arise. All this takes
time and discipline to manage so that you can optimize your return.

It's hard not to get caught up in the emotion and fear when "black swan" events
occur. The investor has not control over these types of economic disruptions.
It should be seen as a potential once in a life time value opportunity. If you
have managed your portfolio based on conservative value criteria, there should
be no need to do massive selling but rather you should be nibbling at new value
buys to add to your basket.

Finally, I continue to focus on moving new money into ADR's that meet some of
my long term value themes. Two on my list include Petroleo Brasileiro (PBR) &
Perdigao S.A. (PDA). Both are at all time highs, so I am waiting until there is
some correction lower.

dissappointing, and they are in fact more expensive than ameritrade from my
point of view since i use limit orders, and sometimes buy more than 5,000

New Street.com Video Calls Force Protection Top MRAP 2 Contender... (Not rated)

Force Protection Rolls Again

By Melissa Davis

Senior Writer

After slipping into reverse this summer, Force Protection (FRPT - Cramer's Take
- Stockpickr - Rating) is on a roll again.

Force Protection's stock has been zooming forward, rising 30% over the past two
weeks alone amid mounting hopes for new orders of the company's popular
Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicles. With the U.S. government set to
approve billions of dollars in new funding for MRAP vehicles -- and the
military halting plans for a rival vehicle program -- Force Protection could
soon see demand for its powerful trucks grow even stronger.

While it faces stiff competition from Navistar (NAVZ - Cramer's Take -
Stockpickr) and a new duo formed by Ceradyne (CRDN - Cramer's Take - Stockpickr
- Rating) and Oshkosh (OSK - Cramer's Take - Stockpickr - Rating), Force
Protection enjoys some major opportunities right now. The U.S. is currently
fielding bids for so-called MRAP II vehicles, with the first orders expected to
be placed as early as next month. Meanwhile, the government has delayed a
high-profile Humvee-replacement program -- calling for new "Joint Light
Tactical Vehicles" -- and potentially opened new doors for Force Protection in
the process.

"In our opinion, this move benefits FRPT in two ways," SunTrust Robinson
Humphrey analyst Chris Donaghey wrote on Wednesday. "First, it likely extends
the longevity of the MRAP program, which could mean MRAP production extends
beyond 2008. Second, it allows more time for FRPT to complete the development
of its Cheetah vehicle, see it fielded domestically and internationally and
continue the spiral development process to add capabilities.

Although Cheetah is not officially the JLTV, a delay in JLTV opens the door for
FRPT to begin capturing this market well before JLTV arrives."

Donaghey recommends buying Force Protection's stock, which he values at $36 a
share, in anticipation of big gains. His firm has investment banking ties to
the company.

Force Protection shares, which fetch around $21 following their September
rally, peaked above $30 a share this spring, when the company still looked
poised to monopolize the MRAP program. But the stock lost serious ground as
competitors, such as Navistar and BAE, started winning big contracts.

Still, under MRAP II, some foresee a better scenario ahead.

"We ... expect to see the competitive field narrowed to three vendors, with
FRPT and Navistar likely as the dominant players followed by BAE as a smaller
third player," Donaghey wrote this week. "Consequently, FRPT's market share of
MRAP should once again increase, providing a significant positive catalyst for
the stock."

I looked in your markitsource link you provided. Only the tranches better than

now some AA tranches still trade at 80c on the $. have you calculated how much
E*Trade has to write off if they have to market-market their mortgage book at
these prices?

from you letter:
 Quote: "It showed $690 million in unrealized losses in securities held on its
books at the end of June, a vast majority in mortgages."

But do you realize how much the mortgage market has changed since then?

At the end of June, the mortgage market as represented by the ABX indices was
in a very distressed state, with many series
of mortgages having locked market prices -- offers were locked on the bid, no
spread existed between the two.

But have you noticed the sharp improvements in the liquidity and pricing of the
mortgage market since then?

The improvements of the mortgage market has much improved since the end of June
till now is the difference in liquidity in the mortgage market. At the end of
June, a lender would find it difficult to liquidate almost any position, but
now the liquidity in many series have come back. The following chart, I
believe, can be used to illustrate how much the high-yield bond market has
rallied since the late-June to July period.

I've been too busy with work to spend a lot of time on my portfolio, and I was
also a little surprised at my large cash position. I recall thinking I was
pretty damn smart right about the time the Dow hit it's previous record and I
was up so much. Without looking it up, I'd guess that was August 12. :>) So to
protect my gains I started selling.

Today I put some of that cash to work and am now at 49.5% cash. Still looking
for new ideas.

Bought CLL and BDN based on posts here and the charts. Added to ARO after
updating my FV calculation with what I believe are conservative estimates:

Company: ARO
Date: 10/1/2007
Next year's expected earnings: $1.80
EPS growth rate used for estimate: 8%
Multiple Graham used for estimate: 8.5
Graham Fair Value: $31.05
Current Price: $19.61
$ difference: $11.44
Percent Growth to Fair Value: 58.32%

Started a position in DDS, Dillards. Much not to like about this pig
(management, possible recession and lower consumer confidence, slow growth,
better execution in other retailers, etc.) but I think that is all priced in.
So I plugged my nose and took the leap.

Six year weekly chart gives me some confidence at this support line:

If one believes CFC will be a big winner, a more conservative way to play that
upturn is to buy BAC, which negotiated a huge convertible deal a month or so
back with CFC. Conversion price of $17, plus it has a yield of 7.5%, if memory
serves.

Obviously you won't get the same bang as straight equity in CFC, but you
eliminate a lot of risk, and pick up a high quality bank itself yielding about
5%.

Disclaimer: I own BAC.

UNH very weak on a strong day, usually not a good sign.

Today the company i work for announced that for next year, the United
Healthcare PPE will be replaced by a Wellpoint affiliate. With the Medicaid
announcement a few days ago, it does appear that UNH I sort of get the feeling
that UNH might not make their growth projections.

Maybe WLP is the better choice. The fundamental valuation metrics are about

Oct 2 (Reuters) - Levitt Corp (LEV.N: Quote, Profile, Research), the parent
company of troubled homebuilder Levitt and Sons, said it raised $153 million
from its rights offering that could be used for various uses as it deals with a
tough Florida housing market.

Levitt said it could use proceeds to fund its home-building unit's negative
cash flow but continued support of the unit's cash needs would be determined by
the homebuilding market and the results of Levitt and Sons' talks with its
lenders.

Levitt and Sons is currently in discussions with its lenders to amend its
credit lines to modify the timing and amount of payments due and to obtain
financing to support its operations and projects.

Levitt will be issuing more than 76 million shares of its Class A common stock
in the rights offering.

very slow rising stock prices over next ten/twenty years. (Hence, old man
stocks)

Within the past 12 months or so, I've bought a mishmash: PMBIF, GNRG, ENB, SE.
I particularly like ENB because of its connection from Canadian oil sands to

Joan, are we talking about VELC? Could you give us more information about the

dividends, apparently paid annually, until January 2007 when they paid .32.

The data shown on this Yahoo! link indicates that they split 10 for 1 in 1999.
Did you buy it before that, and are your dividends based on those split shares?

Now I'm starting to look at CC, as well, purely from a value perspective, as
growth is, currently, a non-issue at CC.

CC trades at less than tangible BV, and has a strong balance sheet, IMHO from
this angle, it may be a buy.

I'll admit I'm not a CC shopper, and wouldn't be, unless some great deal were
to be found there. They need to get sales issues in order.

That doesn't take away that, using some value metrics, CC may be worth

I sold a bunch of stuff in the last two weeks and I don't really know where to

looking at CSG. But really, most of the stocks that were approaching buy prices
have moved up again and there are not many to be bought.

There are 3 sectors that are cheap:

- Homebuilders. They are cheap, but may get much cheaper or even go bankrupt.
Risky. I got initial position, but won't buy much more at current prices.
- Energy. Still cheapo if the oil/gas stays where it is or rises (per peak
oil). It's not cheap if the anti-peak-oilers are right and we are going into
cyclical drop of oil/gas. I have a large position in this sector.
- Retailers. Somewhat cheap. Not screaming buys. I got some positions.

Financials and insurers may be also cheap, but I don't follow them.

Wallace, I agree on CC valuation metrics, however i remember they were looking

it's their lunch they will disappear, not matter how good their balance sheet.

I think CC may be worth a small bet, but the odds of them going out of business
in a few years are fairly high.

I purchased my LCD TV online from CC. They do have good offers if look
carefully. I was able to stack a 10% coupon (for AAA members) on top of a
special offer. That beat Best Buy's price and even Amazon. But overall, Best

Quicken.com gives its ROE in 25-30% range. If that was the case, it would be a

It seems a common issue with European (English only?) stocks. They calculate
ROE differently than in US standards. I am not sure exactly how/why, but the
ROEs from websites and annual reports of GSK, AZN, CSG and some others are much
higher than if you use Yahoo numbers for earnings and equity and calculate ROE

This new contract locks in the forward (10 year) free flow cash flow for the
company and investors. The company maintains its exclusive syndication rights.
IMO fair value based on the future cash flow under this new contract s/b $6-$8
per share.

CBS has agreed to a standstill agreement to not sell their common stock equity
interests (almost 20%) until AFTER 12/31/07. The company is being shopped

This stock is still quite speculative but with this new contract makes the
