dieoff was started by a friend of mine. He's a genius(literally). Made a small
fortune in software and has been retired for at least 15 years. Like Rainwater,
he spends hours a day researching issues that he believes are a major concern
to the future of mankind. Crackpot? Maybe. Successful financially? Absolutely.

I don't know Rainwater but if he thinks like my friend Jay Hanson who started
dieoff then I would lean in his direction as well. I still work most days and
don't have the time to research issues for 5 hours a day. However, over 15
years of pretty steady involvement with Jay and his wife have proved to me that
they are sincere, honest, extremely well educated, and very diligent in their
research. Crackpot is the least likely moniker I would attach to Jay, FWIW.

I looked at the dieoff website and it still does not look plausible to me. the
big problems I have with that models like "peak oil" etc. that they depend on
linear thinking, but totally neglect that human inventiveness will prevent
those disasters from happening. I have a book in my shelf dated 1972 that
predicts that oil will only last for another 30 years but here we are past 2002
and there are no lines on gas stations yet. It's all a matter of price in a
market driven economy - scarcity will drive prices which will reduce demand and
increase supply or other energy sources. if we run out of oil, we will use coal
(we have supplies for another 250 years), convert coal to liquids, save energy
and use alternative energy sources.If we run out of coal we will use nuclear
power, as i would bet that a winter where fuel is rationed would change our
public opinions in a heart beat. Nothing is inevitable in my opinion. I do not
know what will happen in the future but i do know what the future will be
different than even the smartest man's prediction.

Jugis Bekepuris: On an individual basis, those three you've got look lousy to
me. As a package, very possible it'll work okay - possibly there's a
revision-to-mean with one that'll deliver an overall cap. gain for the
threesome.

I'd also agree that LBY's got a lot of debt for what you get - not a great
profitable business. But for what it is, in past they seem to have okay profit
margins and high roe (All that debt enables some good ROE.). Not much sales
growth and plenty of competition, it seem to me; so I would expect a low p/e
nonetheless.

Again, as I say, I've been wrong on DSWL forever. I just do not see how, or
understand why, a company that I see as basically an injection molding shop and
a printed circuit board manufacturer (assembler) can have and sustain such high
profit margins. Totally different from my limited experience when I worked with
and in these types of companies in the USA. I never saw a moat to these
businesses. OTOH, perhaps I've not studied DSWL as I should - I've never tested
my biases - perhaps DSWL is not what I perceive it to be, and there's something
different about its businesses. Back on the other hand though, when you fudge
the books (somebody apparently got caught there recently), you can show good
profit margins!

I'm closing my position in my recently purchased RadioShack (RSH). (I'll take a

hard for me to see DSWL or LBY recovering (aside: I don't see so well though),
I now wonder if RSH can recover. Plenty of stores, no compelling products (that
I'm aware of). I ask myself, if RSH went bankrupt, would anybody even miss
them?
Historically on several measures, the stock is cheap. I've lost confidence here

Here's what a writer at "Fortune" says:

http://money.cnn.com/2005/12/22/markets/pluggedin_fortune/index.htm

I read this and it seemed like there might be a possiblity of a couple or more
good bets among some of the stocks described. I re-read the article, and I
can't tell now if the author is being serious or facetious with his predictions
or the stocks he describes. As with: "(It's)...safe to bet that names like BP,
Chevron and Shell will continue to outperform. Surging cash flow should also
keep dividends and share repurchases buoyant, so that limits downside." Good
bets they may be, but safe? Not really of course (imo). And the fluctuations in
oil stocks has been so great that having a dividend or good cash flow hasn't
given any noticeable downside protection or amelioration that I can see.
Whether or not the author is intendng to be somewhat tongue-in-cheek, I do like
some of the stocks mentioned in the article for 2006.

Seeing as this appears to be the time to discuss Portfolio performance, here
are the 3 stocks which form my Portfolio. Their purchase dates are in brackets.
Personally, I'm not one to have too large a Portfolio in order to reduce risk.
If a company's Fundamentals satisfies the criteria generally reflected in
QUALITY stock, then I see no reason to dilute capital gain with stocks that
don't exhibit the same. In my personal opinion, sanity eventually prevails in
the stock market and, in the medium to longer term, a stock's price will
reflect the inherent quality of its Fundamentals.
BRY is a bit of an unusual one for me as I prefer to stay away from Resource

state of the oil market.
I'm particularly pleased with the performance of HANS. We debated this stock,
and TWIN, back in July. I trust that you bought some TWIN (you didn't refer to
it in your list) because its price has risen about 88% since then !!
I seem to remember certain Board Members referring to HANS as "the gnat amongst

ABS ... you ask, "any ideas ?" Well, when you look at Retail Food & Drug stocks
like ABS you may want to consider the following ratio from their Income
Statements, viz. EBITDA/Turnover, which gives Operating Margin. In ABS’s case
it’s a low 5.9% for the last 12 months. This is typical of companies in this
sector as they have to keep prices low in order to compete, and leaves very
little margin for error, with the end result that ABS’s Bottom Line is a
minimal 1.16% !
So here you have a company that Turned Over $41,209mil. for 12 months and all
that it could show for that effort was $479mil. !
Therefore, for retailers such as ABS to dazzle the Market with appreciable
increases in their Bottom Line earnings, they really have to INCREASE TURNOVER.
So how likely is ABS going to increase its 12 monthly Turnover by, say, 30% to
$40% ($12,500mil. to $16,500mil.) in order to really impress the Market with
its increased earnings ?!
IMO I’d be surprised if they managed more than about 10% to 12%, considering
that their Annual Turnover over the last 5 years ranged between a low of
$35,626mil. and a high of $39,897mil. Their last 5 Quarterlies didn’t do much
better by ranging between $9950mil. and $11078mil. Their sideways moving chart
doesn’t reflect much in the way of demand either.
Of course, their price plunged in the last 2 days from $24 to about $21. Maybe
there’s something there for the short term players, as they study "Resistance
Levels" etc.. etc..
But you still have to ask why informed investors would want to buy a stock
that’s unlikely to dramatically increase shareholder value.

Those are very good returns Spekulatius. The key is to not have any huge losses
and to compound your returns year after year.

I have not measured the return on my taxable account(s) yet as it is a bit more
difficult for me to determine my net gains attributed to the specific portfolio
performance vs the monies I have added this year from other asset sales
including real estate and gold.

I actually saw money from pending litigation on a few stocks I have held in the
IRA. These were class action cases going back several years. Two securities are
BK and worthless but the litigation money was a surprise.

On my IRA account which is closed to new monies gained just over 12% in 2005.
My goal is to produce at least a 10% return every year. This way the portfolio
doubles in 7.2 years. A large percentage of the return is attributable to
investing in stocks that pay dividends.

My best performing stocks in 2005 in my IRA included GLW (+96%), HAL (54%), GP
(47%) and TRP (+32%).

The worst stocks were the drug companies. Of course I used the proceeds of the
cash flow from the dividends earned and a few equity sales to load up in this
sector.

My top three sectors in the IRA now are Drugs (21%), Integrated Oil (16%), and
Banks (13%).

I have about 25 different equities in the IRA.

On participating in litigation:

re: "I actually saw money from pending litigation on a few stocks I have held
in the IRA. These were class action cases going back several years. Two
securities are BK and worthless but the litigation money was a surprise."

I'll back you up with further comments. PARTICIPATE in these securities
lawsuits!!!! Almost always when I read people who've lost money in a stock
they've derided the lawsuit(s) that are filed. The reasons are primarily
two-fold: 1)We're in a capitalistic society - you took a chance, you lost, move
on, stop whining, don't blame (i.e. sue) somebody; 2)What's the point?- the
so-and-so lawyers make all the money, the suits perpetuate frivolous
litigation, you'll not see any of your money anyway when the thing is all
settled - and that's years from now. Maybe a third underlying reason is that it
takes some work to fill out the paperwork, and with more claims than settlement
monies, the return amount is iffy and likely to be very small.

I've found that it is possible to get some money back. A pleasant surprise, and
sometimes $$$ much more that what was expected. Of course, almost no one is
made whole from their losses. Secondly, some of these people who run these sued
companies, ARE crooks, and there ought to be some deterrents available to the
small investor swindled/cheated/hurt by these guys' shenanigans. Having the
ability to go before a judge with a complaint and having the judge find in
favor of plaintiffs, is one way to deter these crumbbum managers.

Given all the positions I hold and given that a lot of these stocks are on the
edge and a lot have already fallen over, I likely see more of these litigation
paperwork things on my desk than many other folks. My recommendation based on
my experience is this:

PARTICIPATE if you have losses and qualify to be in the class-action.

SAVE your records.
I'm just mailing back AOL-Time Warner and they wanted info. going back to 1999;
Fleming is on my desk now, and they want info. back to 2001. I tossed out
Computer Associates forms yesterday- I have gain on my sales transaction, so I
wasn't damaged with losses, and so I don't believe I qualify. EDS came in
today's mail. Geez- that is a bunch. Maybe the filings are seasonal, end-of
year?? Merry Christmas from the lawyers? -gg-

There's some tax stuff too which I'm not qualified to discuss. For example,
monies received from a lawsuit from stock that was in an IRA are now received
outside the IRA. Does or can the money go back in, and/or is there a federal
and/or state tax consequence - if so how is it calculated and where is it
reported? etc. etc. Ugly stuff. That's why somebody might want to have a tax
accountant to help them with these issues.

Many good points Paul Senior.

The litigation I am waiting on goes back to December 1999. I mailed in one
complete set of forms and trade receipts in 1/1/05 but they now need copies of
my statements for the "class" period. The money from the suit is already in an
escrow account and I was told there were only 1,300 class members that are
qualified to receive the settlement proceeds. When I asked if there was a non
response from any of these members, would the settlement be split among the
remaining qualifying members? There was a pause on the phone and silence then
in a quite voice answered . . . "No"!

So it appears that this is another incentive for the lawyers to get these cases
closed. They apparently receive all the money in the escrow account after the
payment to the qualified class members. This amount can be substantial. 30% of
the qualifying class members are non-responsive.

Regarding the litigation for an equity in my IRA account, the claim is made
according to the title of my IRA account and any checks received will be made
out in the name of this account title. I assume these monies can be deposited
directly into the account w/o penalty as these proceeds represent the return of
principal.

What is extremely important in the case of an IRA account is that ANY loss of
principal compounds the hit on future returns. New "qualified" monies are at
best difficult to add to the account. In my case, I have very little or no
"earned" income so I no longer can make annual contributions to my IRA
account(s). All of my income is either dividend, interest, short term or long
term capital gains.

Therefore, any proceeds from this litigation is extra gravy for my IRA account.
I am very conservative in all of the equity investments that are made in my IRA
account.

I have a big "Value" bet on many of these drug companies (for the long term)
and I am glad to see that at least one of them is beginning to pay off.

Biotech is an old stomping ground of mine. Though to make consistent results.
Most companies never make it, so one needs to have home runs to make up for the
inevitable losses or be an savvy trader. I decided 3 years ago that this is too
tough of a business. With a few exceptions I decided to buy into companies with
earnings and go for singles and doubles..

After reading your reply 22832, it occurred to me how similar your strategy is
to so many others one reads about on this Board and elsewhere. Don’t get me
wrong. I’m not out to criticise or pontificate, but rather to debate, question
and suggest. What you and others do with your investment capital, and the
criteria you use, is entirely your own business.
But when I read through many Messages on this Board of Value orientated
investors, the common thread is often how many stocks they’ve purchased which
have lost them money. Of course, they also purchased winners as well. Therefore
the one question I thought folk would be asking themselves is "what is it about
the stock selection criteria I’m using that doesn’t separate the potential
losers from the potential winners ?" Because if one is going to use a
particular modus operandi that seems to have flaws in it, then why continue to
use it. Logically speaking, something about some of those criteria cannot be
right.
In your reply, you stated "If your portfolio is riding on only a handful
stocks, the risk that you are incurring is pretty high." But the fact of the
matter is, that the average of two of those stocks, HANS and PDX, was 54% (I’m
ignoring BRY because it’s not a stock that would have passed the criteria I
normally use. Personally I don’t usually invest in Resource based stocks or
Banks). And that criteria is not my own, but is based on a stock evaluation
method devised by my good friend Dr. Karl Posel. Very briefly it states ...
1)Don’t buy a stock if it doesn’t satisfy 8 specific criteria based on
pertinent information contained in its Financial Statements.
2)Don’t buy a stock if it’s currently too expensive.
3)From those stocks that manage to satisfy (1) and (2) above, select those that
show the greatest potential for price increase in the next 6 months.
The end result of this approach is that one ends up with only a handful of
QUALITY stocks compared with the generally accepted practice of large
portfolios chosen, primarily, to reduce risk. But often the end result of the
latter approach is the good performance of the minority of stocks are adversely
affected by the poorer performance of the majority of lesser quality companies.
It wouldn’t surprise me if you told me that about 10% of the stocks you bought
in the last year really made you a good return, but your overall performance
was marred by a fair portion of the other 90% which brought your averages down.
And if you had to investigate the Financial Statements of those 10%, I’d be
very surprised if what they contained did not at least satisfy (1) above. The
fact of the matter is, that good companies that provide ongoing value for their
shareholders (and a good dividend as well !), generally tend to meet or exceed
specific criteria and ratios found within their Financial Statements. The
converse is true for the potentially poorer performers.
So, in our opinion, your risk for losing money is actually reduced by choosing
companies that satisfy (1) to (3), compared to investing in a large portfolio
because of the assumption that one’s losing positions will be diluted by your
winning ones. Why not rather invest in fewer winning companies that reflect the
properties of winning companies.
I trust this Message will be received in the spirit in which it was intended.

That was a very good post in my estimation. I wish that you would offer

From:bruwin
Thanx for your positive comment Suma.
You also said, "I wish you would offer specificity...and give us more stocks
..etc"
Well ... in order to adequately reply to that, I went back to when I first
corresponded on this Board on the 17/6/05 (21642). Below are stocks I
recommended or were positive about :-
(1) On the 18/6/05 I commented in 21493 that I liked the look of HANS, at
$40.60 (post split) and PDX at $73.84. HANS is now $85.60 and PDX is $90.61. So
that’s 110% and 23% on your money in 6 months.
(2) On the 19/6/05 in 21500, I mentioned JLG. It was $27.70. It’s now $48.15.
So that’s 73% on your money in 6 months. In fairness I also mentioned OXY in
the same post. It was then $80.13 and is now $82.46. That's only 3% up. It did
rise to a high of $89.80.
(3) On the 23/6/05 I debated TWIN with Spekulatius in 21533. I stated then that
I regarded TWIN as being undervalued with its P/E at 10. I believed it should
be at about 16. Its price was then $22.00. It’s now $46.50. That’s 111% in 6
months.
(4) On the 25/6/05 in 21545 I mentioned and recommended FCFS. Its price was
then $18.76. It’s now $28.49. That’s 52% on your money in 6 months.
If you’d invested equal amounts in these stocks you would have averaged
(110%+23%+73%+3%+111%+52%)/6 = 62.0% in 6 months.

But stock market investment is not only about what to buy, it’s also about what
not to buy. In this regard :-
(1) I had my reservations about GCI on 19/6/05 in 21497. It was $75 then, it’s
now $61. A fall of 18.6%.
(2) I didn’t like MAXY on the 28/6/05 in 21561. It was $7.83 then, it’s now
$7.86.
(3) I didn’t like EGR on the 2/7/05 in 21588. It was $1.61 then, it’s now 30%
down at $1.24.
(4) I didn’t like ABS on the 9/7/05 in 21642. It was $20.90 then, it’s now
$20.54. In fairness, it did go to $25.80 before moving sideways and then
falling back to $20.54.

There were also stocks that performed better than I thought they would :-
(1) JAKK (see 21739) was $17.95 on the 21/7/95. It’s now $21.12. That’s 17.6%
up in 5 months.
(2) You mentioned LIFC on the 22/7/05 in 21763. It was $16.39 then. I thought
it was too expensive at a P/E of 67. It went to $24.49 before falling back to
its current price of $19.77. That’s 20.6% up in 5 months.
(3) I didn’t like TEX in 21820 on the 30/7/05. It was $51 then. It’s at $60
now. That’s 17.6% up in 5 months. However, in 21821 I did like TRIB which was
$6.55 then, and is now $8.05. That’s 23% up in 5 months.

So ... in my "defence" {;-) SUMA, I’d like to think that I’ve done my bit with
regard to stock recommendations, as well as stating my reservations, with
reasons, about others.
In line with what I said regarding choosing fewer Quality stocks as opposed to
larger, "risk averse" portfolios, just 6 companies would have earned you 62% in
6 months.

 on this Board of Value orientated investors, the common thread is often how
many stocks they’ve purchased which have lost them money 

I never incurred in my post that many of my stocks lost value. In fact, very
few of my stocks lost value. of course with a larger portfolio, one is more
likely to occur losses, but their effect on portfolio performance is of course
lessened through diversification. It is apparent from you post that you believe
that your method is fairly error proof. From my experience, no such method
exists, as there is always a risk that even the best fundamental analysis is
negated by inhonest management, fraud, or much more likely "stuff that just
happens" and quickly changes the outlook of a company (and the stock price for
that matter). last not least I second Suma's call to give more specifics on you
8 criteria or the stocks that you choose using them.

The end result of this approach is that one ends up with only a handful of
QUALITY stocks compared with the generally accepted practice of large
portfolios chosen, primarily, to reduce risk.

Regardless of the 8 specific criteria you use you're still at risk for the
non-financial things that can (and sometimes does) drive the price of a stock
down. You might be able to figure out that a company might have exposure to
lawsuits or patent issues, but how about a plane crash taking out the company
top management, an earthquake that destroys company headquarters, a hurricane
that destroys the infrastructure necessary to keep a factory running at peak
efficiency.

These things don't happen often, but they can have a very large impact when
they do happen. I don't want 30% or 50% of the value of my portfolio
susceptible to that kind of risk.

Hi Manny valasco - Any of the major drug companies are good for the long term
as the sector is down compared to the S&P 500.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=5y&s=%5EDRG&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=pfe%2Cmrk%2Cbmy%2Csg
%2Clly&c=%5EGSPC

Notice that all the major drug companies have under performed the S&P as well
as the general Drug (DRG) sector.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=5y&s=%5EDRG&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=pfe%2Cmrk%2Cbmy%2Csg
%2Clly&c=%5EGSPC

The companies on the graph above have under performed the S&P w/ worst to best
performance include:
BMY ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=BMY )
MRK ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=MRK )
SGP ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=sgp )
PFE ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pfe )
LLY ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=lly )

I have bought BMY, MRK and PFE recently. I have SGP on my buy list if it goes
below $20 again. I will pick up a few shares to add to my other drug companie
holdings.

I sold my JNJ in 2005 at $65 as I thought it was over valued compared to the
other drug companies. I like JNJ and will buy again if it test $55.

It's not too often that you see the DRG index under perform the S&P. Each of
these drug companies pay good dividends and have the free flow cash flow to
support these payments. The big question that the market is uncertain on is the
future pipe line of new drugs under development. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)
got FDA approval for their new drug for rheumatoid arthritis. It's just a
matter of time that these other companies get approval from the FDA for their
drugs under development.

You want to accumulate shares when they are at their lows and hope over the
longer term that their R&D investments pay off and new drugs are approved. All
of these companies continue to invest in R&D especially MRK and PFE.

Hope this helps.

From:bruwin
Thanx for the reply Spekulatius. Commenting on the investment strategy and
criteria used by other investors often engenders something of a ‘retaliatory’
response. That’s why I usually preface my comments with "What you and others do
with your investment capital, and the criteria you use, is entirely your own
business." Needless to say, it’s good to read that, however you personally
approach the stock market, you are generally garnering profits and not
incurring much in the way of losses. The proof of the pudding, as they say, is
in the eating !!
My primary intention for writing what I did in 22845, and in 22847, was to
comment on another Investment Strategy and to back it up with actual
performance numbers. Maybe it would assist others by way of them asking
questions of their own systems in terms of separating winners from losers.
Is the system "error proof" ? Well, firstly, as I mentioned previously, it’s
not my system. It first saw the light of day in my friend, Dr.Karl Posel’s
first book, 'Winning On The JSE'. The author holds the highest level of
academic qualification, viz. D.Sc. and Ph.D, and also has over 30 years
experience in stock market investment. I mention these two aspects because, in
my opinion, such individuals :-
1) Generally value their reputations and are very circumspect when it comes to
putting anything into print which they cannot support and substantiate.
2) In those 30 years he has seen and evaluated many different approaches to
stock investment and has concluded that a mathematical and rational analysis of
a company’s Financial Fundamentals is primarily the way to go.
Speaking for myself, I have yet to lose money on a stock purchase that
satisfied the 9 criteria (or Laws as he described them. Several have since been
modified) that appeared in "Winning ...", as well as 3 further criteria that we
have determined since then. I mentioned 8 in 22845 because those ones refer,
specifically, to the contents of a company’s Financial Statements.
You stated, "From my experience, no such method exists." Well ... who of us can
say that we have experienced all that life, and stock market analysis, has to
offer ??!! {:-)
With regard to ‘inhonest’ (maybe that should be ‘dishonest’) management. Yes,
there certainly have been examples of that in recent times. But, in our opinion
and experience, QUALITY companies, earning above average returns for their
shareholders, don’t usually have anything to hide. This is generally evident in
the content and manner in which they present their Financial Results. After
all, you can fool all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all
of them forever, and eventually any bad reporting will become evident. Needless
to say, it’s important to also consider the quality of the management of the
company you are investing in. This, after all, is one of the most important
considerations of the "Sage of Omaha" before he buys into any company.
You ask for "more specifics". Unfortunately it would not be fair to those who
have commercially obtained this information, both from me and from the writings
of Dr. Posel.
However, for what you may consider it to be worth, I will indicate which
aspects, both within and without, a company’s financial statements, we would
consider. Most of the items are formulated into ratios, and targets are set
which a company has to meet or exceed. QUALITY companies, that provide ongoing
value to their shareholders, have no problem in generally satisfying these
requirements. The converse is the case for poor performers. We generally only
purchase or sell our shares after a company publishes its financial statements
because that’s when you know most about a company’s financial status. If, at
that stage, a company no longer satisfies our criteria, we sell it. We would
also sell if a better opportunity presented itself. In this regard, it would be
interesting to know why you sold TWIN "early" as you stated. Was there an
adverse change in its Financial Fundamentals, or did you find a better prospect
? If it was neither, then, in our opinion, there was no reason to offload it
and lose out on future profit.
We concentrate, primarily, on analysing individual companies, and don’t put too
much emphasis on which sector is weak or strong, what "the Dow", "SP500" or any
other Index is doing. Personally, I fail to see what the average performance of
30 large cap stocks of "the Dow" has to do with the ongoing performance of, for
example, a stock such as HANS or PDX. And criteria such as "Market Sentiment"
is, in our opinion, a rather nebulous and un-quantifiable consideration.
We prefer not to invest in Resource based companies, Banks and Financial
Institutions. That still leaves over 8000 companies to choose from on the US
stock markets.
With regard to Industrial Companies, we look at and utilise ..

TURNOVER
EBITDA
NET FINANCE COST
PROFIT BEFORE TAXATION
NET INCOME
LONG TERM DEBT
CAPITAL EMPLOYED
EPS
DPS
DIVIDEND COVER
DIVIDEND YIELD
P/E
MONEY MARKET INTEREST RATE
INDIVIDUAL’S AVERAGE TAX RATE

We are not fans or proponents of ‘Free Cash Flow’, Price/Book, Price/Sales,
Price/(Anything Else, except Earnings).
One could say it’s a process that concentrates, primarily, on the "internal
dynamics" of an INDIVIDUAL company’s Financial Statements. After all, it’s a
company one is investing in, not a Sector or Overall Index.
Best wishes with your investments in 2006.

Thanx for your reply Marc. I don’t think I could add much more to this reply,
over and above what I said in my comments to Spekulatius in 22853.
I suppose there’s always the risk of one of those events occurring. However,
another question to possibly consider is, "does my investment strategy
generally ensure that the overall majority of the 20 or 30 companies in my
Portfolio will provide above average returns for their shareholders ?" If this
is not the case, then one’s investment losses, or below average returns, are
likely to occur more often than the type of business setbacks you mentioned.
If we exclude the highest earner of the 6 companies in 22847 because all the
management were wiped out in an aircraft accident as you suggested, viz. TWIN
at 111%, we have (110%+23%+73%+3%+0%+52%)/6 = 43.5% in 6 months. Would you

Hi valueminded. You asked "Any thoughts on heavy equipment manufacturers ?"
If I understand your question correctly, can I ask the following question and
put forward the following scenario ...
Let’s assume that the Heavy Equipment Manufacturing sector contained 30
companies. 28 of them were performing particularly badly causing the sector’s
index to go downhill. But two of the 30, CYD and VOLVY, were providing well
above average returns for their shareholders and future prospects were looking
positive, as one could determine from the data contained from within their
Financial Statements. Should the 28 poor performers necessarily deter you from
investing in CDY and/or VOLVY ? Is it the overall "heavy equipment
manufacturers" you're considering, or the inherent quality of an individual
company’s financial fundamentals ?

flaw in the sector - but was interested if someone else did.

CYD has some management issues. I believe the majority of CYD stock is owned by
a holding company which controls the companies fortunes to the disadvantage of
minority owners. I think the issue was a dividend payment that did not happen
(or a dividend payment that was not supposed to happen). After the machinations
became public in 2004, the stock faltered from above 20 to less than 10 and
never really recovered from that. Some info should be available in the public

Hey Bruwin - thanks for expressing an interest in PPTI's fundamentals.
Especially those I think are excellent. But first, let me apologize for being
less than clear. You ask very pointed questions about PPTI's "quarterly
results" and "EBITDA". I should have clarified that you are correct about this
aspect of a company's "fundamentals". If we were measuring the fundamentals for
a declining industry, your analysis would help decide which to ditch first. But
I referred to two aspects of PPTI which make it the next new tech firm to buy!

PPTI has a fundamental breakthrough in a biotech device. It is based on silk
and elastin, but because the polymers (pPti) "can be processed into a variety
of forms such as gels, sponges, films, and fibers..", it is not only biosafe
and long lasting, it will be effective in many ways. Safe and effective means
sales.

PPTI has recently fundamentally improved its management and its vertical
integration. This is all on record. PPTI is growing.

Thanks for your best wishes - but I think the company's fundamentals will make
the rise happen.

 it would be interesting to know why you sold TWIN "early" as you stated. Was

I sold TWIN because i considered it fairly valued when I sold. Of course I can
now say I sold early because the stock kept on rising. That's the way it is,
sometimes i sell too early and sometimes i sell to late <g>.

Generally speaking i am quick to sell if the fundamentals don't turn out the
way I expect or when a stock rises beyond what i con sider fair value. i hold
some stocks for several years if the fundamentals are OK, shareholder value is

Hi John ... thanx for the reply. It seems we view "fundamentals" from different
perspectives ! I’m certainly not well informed on the fundamental properties of
silk, elastin and the pPti of polymers.
For those who are, or soon will be, invested in PPTI, let’s hope that their
product sales will vastly improve the current state of that company’s
financials.
I belong to that school who prefer to first see EVIDENCE that a company is
increasing Revenue, has debt well under control, is reporting increasing Bottom
Line profit and preferably rewarding their shareholders with a healthy
Dividend.
In the world of competitive Capitalism, be it Biotech or elsewhere, who can say
whether or not a particular company will, sometime in the future, not be
overcome by another company with superior and more sought after products or by
superior management, marketing campaigns, etc.. etc.. At the present time,
PPTI’s financial fundamentals, IMO, give no indication that they are well ahead
of the competition.
In my humble opinion, the only time we will know for sure how successful are a
company’s products and management abilities, will be when we see that success
portrayed in the Financial Statements of said company. Rest assured, I, for
one, will seriously consider buying PPTI’s stock should their financial
fundamentals indicate that they are more than worthy of purchase. Until that
happens, from a stock investment standpoint, one is crystal ball gazing and
involved in the realm of speculation.
Let’s hope that your contention ... "but I think the company's fundamentals

I made the comment you referred to because maybe the "internal workings" of

Imo you might be a little too reserved here in your response to the gentleman.

On this, the alleged Ben Graham Value thread, that this stock is posted here as
a value stock, just degrades the term value. If PPTI is allowed to pass here as
a "value stock", then there can be no objective criticism for any stock that
anybody puts up here. Every stock qualifies as a value stock.

I don't say the stock can't or won't go up - it's been over $1 before, way
over, and it could do it again (from current 19 cents). But the company has
never - from what I can tell- ever been profitable, and everything has been and
remains - a potential.

I'm not saying the stock should not be looked at. It could be a great
speculation, and just what somebody might be looking for. And anybody can
diddy-bop into the thread and mention any stock they want - it's an unmoderated
thread. But for somebody to offer this thing as a value stock...man, that is
insulting the thread's collective intelligence. Well, I presume so anyway. -g-

OT? Picked up NABI yesterday @3.43. It got whacked hard on failure of a staph
drug. I doubt it qualifies as a value stock, but here's my rationale for the
purchase:
Selling near tangible book [S&P] thus little or no value assigned to
intellectual property.
Anti-Smoking Vaccine Shows Promise
http://www.forbes.com/lifestyle/health/feeds/hscout/2005/12/26/hscout529407.htm
NicVax MARKET: Tobacco use is the single leading preventable cause of death in
the United States and is responsible for more than 440,000 deaths each year.
Experts estimate that 70 per cent of smokers in the US want to quit, but less
than 5 per cent of those who try to quit abstain from smoking for 3 to 12
months. In addition, tobacco use is thought to cause $75.5B in excess medical
costs and $81.9 billion in illness- related productivity losses each year in
the US [So Co's/healthcare plans are eager to support anti-smoking solutions].
BUYOUT? Several big pharma's have projects to address nicotine addiction. Could
they buy NABI to build nicotine portfolio and use current cash/cashflow to
offset coming expirations:
* Nicorette/Nicotrol - Pfizer
* NiQuitin/NicoDerm/Nicorette/Nicabate - GlaxoSmithKline
* Nicotinell/Habitrol - Novartis
* Zyban (Bupropion) - GlaxoSmithKline
Late-Stage Development Product Focus
* Rimonabant (Acomplia) - Sanofi-Aventis
* Varenicline - Pfizer
INSIDER BUYS: CFO 17.4k sh @3.51 & CB/CEO/Pres 63.3K sh @3.47 SVP -Technology

APOL: re: "PE is around 20 and with an estimated 15-20% growth rate,a
substantial FCF (despite the growth) and a good balance sheet, the stock looks
like a bargain."

Okay, but just don't call it a "value stock". -g-

If the company is able to sustain its performance, imo by my calculations the
stock would/could/might be in "bargain" range as long as the p/e is under 28.
THAT is a very high number and difficult to sustain for most companies
(although APOL has had higher than that p/e for the past ten years on average).
I see the stock as both risky and attractive at current price and current p/e
(~24, per Yahoo). I'm in today for a few shares.

A PE of about 28 for a company like APOL sounds about right. What impresses me
is that Capex was less than 25% of the cash flow during the last few years,
despite high organic growth. By my estimate, shareholders would do OK with 10%
growth organic growth rate given those economics. I think APOL should be able
to do better than that for a couple of years. The stock right now look
surprisingly weak - tax loss selling? I am planning to add more. Y2005 is
almost over and Y2006 estimates are around 2.9$ so PE based on 2006 numbers is
indeed around 20.

APOL: I like the idea of adding more in '06.

The company and stock had been popular, and hence (imo), the high p/e. Should
the sector or company fall further out of favor, stock price and p/e could drop
further. OTOH, the company IS delivering superior results, and it does deserve
a higher p/e than it has now. ("Deserve" and "superior results" mean by my
calculations and how I evaluate a company's performance against the totality of
what all other companies are delivering. I could be wrong.)

Firstly John, I can understand your enthusiasm for PPTI because it’s more than
likely based on your in depth knowledge of the products it produces and how
they currently compare to others in the market place. As a result, you believe
that their superior performance, quality etc.. etc.. will, inevitably, lead to
the financial prosperity of PPTI. That may (or may not) well be the result,
however ....
As the title of this Board suggests, this is all about VALUE stocks based,
largely, on the CURRENT status of a company’s Financial Fundamentals. In my
opinion, by no stretch of the imagination can one look at the current contents
of PPTI’s financial statements and conclude that this is a Value stock.
When should you return ? Well ... as Paul Senior stated, "...anybody can
diddy-bop into the thread and mention any stock they want - it's an
un-moderated thread."
Hopefully, the next time we seriously consider PPTI, it will be, at least,
because Turnover is increasing at a regular pace, EBITDA is no longer negative
and Bottom Line is on a regular uptrend .... a healthy dividend payment to
shareholders would certainly add to its attractiveness, IMO.
.... And best wishes from me too !

This is probably not relevant, I don't know: There's an unwritten rule on the

stock be limited to 20 posts. The idea is that after some discussion, people
ought to know whether the stock interests them or not. If it interests them,
the discussion should be taken to a separate thread devoted to the company. In
that way, the people here who've decided that they are not interested in the
particular stock, don't have to wade through the posts here.

Paul, the one thing that has always impressed me about your posts is the polite
and constructive manner with which you communicate to other Board members. IMO
you don’t get personal, you just express your opinion and provide information,
as is your right. This is contrary to other recent contributors who insist on
making snide remarks without identifying the individual they are targeting.
I’m sure, when you wrote your comments to me, you must have thought it unlikely
that I wouldn’t reply ! In this instance, I believe a reply is necessary.
(i) You may recall, that in my original Message I said, "Medium to longer term
investors may want to KEEP AN EYE ON THEM."
(ii) In the following Message I said, "I believe their current fundamentals are
still fine, and GOOD FUTURE RESULTS, with above average increases in EPS, could
bring those P/E ratios down and probably MAKE THEM ATTRACTIVE to informed
investors."
(iii) As I stated, in my Message to Spekulatius (22853), a component of my
investment strategy can be read in the comment I made then, that "(We)
generally only PURCHASE or SELL our shares AFTER a company publishes its
financial statements because that’s when you know most about a company’s
financial status."
From (i) and (ii) I’d like to think that what should be clear to the reader is
my intention to bring several stocks to his/her attention (‘may want to keep an
eye on them’) and to assess their future fundamental quality (‘good future
results’) before making a buy decision. Unfortunately, what the reader would
not have known at the time, was that component of my investment strategy which
appears in (iii), and which states that I prefer to only buy or sell shares
immediately after the publication of a company’s financial results. I stated at
the time that several of the stocks had, in my opinion, slightly high P/E’s,
and it would have been prudent to see what their next EPS’s looked like as this
could have brought that ratio down and probably have made them more attractive.
In my opinion, the investment time horizons for Fundamental Analysts are not
hours or days, as they are for Day Traders and possibly Swing Traders etc ...,
but rather several months or years. From the 7/11/2005 to today isn’t, in my
opinion, a long time in the arena of Fundamental Analysis. Personally, I don’t
believe too much attention should be given to short term share price movements,
as a stock’s price tends to reflect a company’s underlying fundamental quality
over the medium to longer term, especially if it’s concurrent financial results
continue to reflect this quality.
This is one of the reasons I put charts of 3 South African stocks, DAW, DGC and
WBO on my web site. There have been several occasions of selling pressure in
each one which caused sideways or slight declines in their price movements.
However, the underlying quality of their financial fundamentals are still good
and satisfy the specific criteria we require of a stock. As a result their
overall average share prices have gone up 123% in the last 15 months (100%,
149% and 121% respectively).
One of the aspects of Technical Analysis that I’m prepared to go along with is
the Trend Line. I believe there’s something to be said for "higher highs and
higher lows".
With regard to the specific stocks ...
At the time, AOB was the best price performer. Since then, as you quite rightly
pointed out, it’s price has fallen a fair way. But behind that fall is a reason
which obviously wasn’t apparent at the time. Below is an extract which should
go some way to explain that reason. Personally, I don’t believe it alters the
quality of AOB’s financial fundamentals as they were in early November :-

"HONG KONG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 23, 2005--American Oriental Bioengineering
Inc. (AMEX: AOB - News), a leading Chinese manufacturer and distributor of
pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products, announced today that it is
conducting a private offering to accredited investors with respect to an
offering of up to 12,500,000 units, each unit consisting of one share of its
common stock and three-tenths of a warrant to purchase one share of its common
stock, at a price of $4.80 per unit, for anticipated aggregate proceeds of up
to approximately $60 million. The proceeds, net of offering fees and expenses,
will be used to finance acquisitions and for general corporate purposes " .....
and ....
"Each unit consists of one common share and three-tenths of a warrant to
purchase one share. After accounting for the warrant conversion, American
Oriental Bioengineering will be issuing 17.4 million common shares.
The news sent the company's shares down 95 cents, or 16 percent, to $5.02 on
the American Stock Exchange. The stock has traded between $1.75 and $7.68 over
the past 52 weeks."

You correctly stated that SCHK’s current price is $33.25, but that you couldn’t
find anything on Yahoo as to it’s price on 7/11/2005. For those who are not
aware of it, the web site, www.bigcharts.com, is an excellent one for looking
up past stock prices. I use the Java chart facility in this regard. On the
7/11/2005, SCHK’s closing price was 12.3% lower at $29.60.
Yes, I would still offer HANS and PDX as Value picks based on their most recent
set of financial results. Needless to say, based on (iii) above, I could change
that opinion after their next set of published results. So I agree, ... for the
present, let’s move on !
Now that I’ve been made aware of that "unwritten rule on the thread"
(unfortunately I haven’t been around on this Board long enough to have picked
up several aspects of Board etiquette) I’ll be sure to monitor my number of
individual stock references !

P.S. I hope Madharry wasn’t too put out by my Message 22885. It was meant as a
"tongue in cheek" comment, which was why I put the "{:-)" at the end of it !
After all, let’s not take life too seriously. Apart from the "serious" business
of stock analysis, I believe we are meant to have a bit of fun as well !

Best wishes with your investments in 2006.

Thanks for noticing AOB. I'm in from 10/04 @$1.40. (Current price $4.40.)

I am conflicted in some respects. I'd love to brag about my gains, how astute
I've been, how wrong "everybody" else has been about one or more of my picks,
and I'd love any accolades I could get.

HOWEVER, this is a thread about finding value stocks. Therefore, in the spirit
of trying to help others (and myself), I believe it's much more beneficial to
talk about losses - and I have a bunch of them. First of all, if I talk about
gains, then more likely than not, the stock is - at the time I would mention my
gains -, at a much higher price than a value investor here would commit to buy.
So its mention is irrelevant to somebody looking for a value purchase. OTOH, if
I mention a downtrodden stock like BMY, where I've said I've had enough, I'm
tossing in the towel, and I'm moving on after holding various amounts of the
stock for maybe 15 years, readers might reflect that if a "presumed" investor
is giving up on the stock, maybe, just maybe it might be that others are doing
similar and so the stock is near the bottom and/or that maybe the stock is now
worth monitoring for somebody willing to commit fresh blood for a possible
purchase and hold.
-------------
Sometimes I have the feeling that I'm like a secret part of each poster on the
thread, unknown to every other poster. For example with you Carl Worth, I
presume it's just you and I who care about and are monitoring CULS (in @$3.20
on 1/04, now $7.15) or WNMLA(in $3.4-3.9, now $5.10)

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=20313639

For these stocks, as with others I have, if I get to the point where I believe
such stocks are worth adding to, then I'll likely again mention them here.
Otherwise, they're in the background unless like AOB, somebody else starts them
up again.

I'm happy your strategy works for you. That's great. However, I'd like to
reemphasize one point Paul touched on.

HANS is not a value stock. This is 100% clear-cut, not debatable, end of story.
I don't know why you keep posting on it on a "Value Investing" board. It may be
an undervalued stock, but it is not a value stock now, and I doubt it was when
you first posted on it. If we continue to talk about stocks like this, we might
as well call this board the "stocks we think will go up" board.

I'm not saying HANS is a bad stock, and I think you should be able to pat
yourself on the back. But if you want to do so, think about posting on a growth
board and reference your great call there. Or, consider creating your own board
"undervalued stocks" or "bruwin's picks".
