Jim, I am 99.9999999% confident the market at some point this late summer/fall
will have a big down thursday with a bad close, a big down Friday with a down
close, a weekend to think about it and realize the meaning of risk, and a crash
on the Monday.

I am also very wary of a snap-back rally from here. Maybe investing in tobacco
was gutsy. But what you are doing is even more so. The market is breaking, not
necessarily yet broken. What's your stop loss?

STE: Good insights. Seems Medicare PPS and managed care really putting pressure
on. Heard one analyst indicate 50% of hospital beds are empty now and number
will decline by another 50% or so in 10 years [By my recollection, which may be
flawed] Vencor, now selling at .09/share 2 years ago was selling at 43 2 years
ago. Tough times. No wonder they're pinchin' pennies. This is one of the
reasons I recently bailed on my LUMI position.
Are there perhaps some other suppliers like STE that haven't hit the wall that

With how poorly my hospital (UCSF-Stanford Health Care) is doing, it is hard
for me to have much confidence in any health care names or sectors. HMO's can
be promising though. I bought that PacifiCare position mainly because of its
hidden asset: all the actuarial data it has that neither the gov't nor the
doctors nor the hospitals have. I don't know how this will all play out, but I
bet the one with the most plentiful and most accurate information wins.

Thanks, Mike. I had mentioned that there appeared to be too many dealers, but
this collateral damage is quite troubling. I am still looking with interest at
CAV in the $4 1/2 range, where it would be selling at 70% of tangible book,
with a yield of 3.5%. It is a point away, but I give it better than 50-50 of
getting there. But note below.

A very interesting point about the industry has come up on one of the CCs -
Champion I believe. The industry may be being adversely effected by the
strength in the economy and stock market -- fewer people have to start out at
the low end or retire down to the low end, as more can afford the stick-built
houses. In my mind it reduces my interest in the industry quite a bit! If they
will have business trouble while things continue good and certainly the stocks
will have trouble when the market rolls over, it looks like this group might be
a whole cycle and many points away from good times for their stocks.

Call this off-topic. Its about shorting. If you are going to flame me for it,
just don't read it.

<<James, SOC is still a short? >>
Obviously SOC was a much better short at 50. Or was it? I had a business school
professor, a portfolio manager (not an academic) tell me something big. She
said your best short is not the high flyer at 75 times earnings. It is the
broken company at 10 down from 75, but clearly on its way to zero. I think she
was right. Peter Lynch said that if you a stock goes to zero you lose 100%
whether you bought it for 100 or 3.

I'll assume you know Sunbeam's history. Sunbeam has 2.2 billion of debt, four
businesses that are mediocre at best and are currently losing a fortune every
quarter, and still bleeding cash profusely a year after everybody forgot about
them. If you read their 10-K the covenants from the banks read like something
out of a bankruptcy document. Management is not allowed to buy a soda without
getting permission from the lenders. The lenders cut them a lot of slack, but
the agreements end next April. That's when they file for bankruptcy unless some
miracle happens. This is a consumer products company bleeding cash in the
biggest consumer binge in recent history. Sayonara. The problem is I couldn't
get shares to short. I am clearly not the first one to think of this. The only
reason I post this is to challenge the notion that your best shorts are
something at its high. I would also point you to Harnischfeger, an obvious
short in my thinking. Unlike Sunbeam, these guys have already filed for
bankruptcy. But the shares are still trading for $2. This will go to zero. The
problem with shorting Harnischfeger is that the slightest whiff of anything
good, even if it is just manipulation, will take the shares to 8 in two days. I
am not willing to take that kind of risk.

I am short Citigroup, Amazon and TheGlobe.com. If you don't know why I shorted
Amazon, you've been living in a cave for the last year. Citigroup I was looking
for a leveraged way of shorting the market - something that will go down 40% if
the market goes down 20%, still trades near its highs, and will not be saved by
a take-over. Citigroup and Goldman were the two I picked. Haven't done Goldman
yet. I did Citigroup first because I also think the merger of Citibank and
Travellers was ridiculous.

Which brings me to TheGlobe.com. Go to the website theglobe.com and explore
around while thinking about how this could possibly make any money. I was
looking for an absolutely ridiculous internet company - here it is. The co-CEOs
are both 24 years old. They started this website when they were undergraduates
at Cornell. $3 million in revenues last quarter but somehow they lost $6
million on the bottom line. They have $20 million in cash left over from the
IPO and they burn it at the rate of $5 million a quarter. Start the stopwatch.
The stock is well off its highs, but this is a "company" that is overvalued if
it trades for $1. I was surprised I could borrow shares so easily.

jeffrey: Quick take on shift to stick built form MH..that may be some of it,
but industry has been upscaling their offerings to meet demand for better
stuff. I suspect demand for product and low entry barriers, perhaps aided by
industry financing, increased dealer count and thus total inventory in field.
Rate jump, though minor, increased floorplan costs, and hit marginal demand.
Another factor could be lack of places to put the units...there's NIMBY factor
on zoning for MH overhanging from "trailor trash" perception that can create
barriers to rapid sales expansion in some areas.
Another possible factor is that intense cyclical hits in the past may have
caused dealers to cut back real quick at the hint of a downturn. I bet a lot of
experienced dealers locked up their purchase orders as the rates rose...not
because demand slowed, but because of fear that it might.

I agree with you about Sunbeam, but then I never short. I would be careful
about the internuts though. even though you believe something like The Globe is
way overpriced someone may scoop it up for some overpriced shares of something
else that you may not like and you end up looking at a substantial loss. Look
at what @Home paid for excite.
I like the Amazon short better if you have the funds to wait it out. However, I
do not see interest rates going up in this environment. I am being offered very
low credit card rates on a temporary basis. To me that means there is lots of
liquidity out there. I think asia is coming back strong and this is an economy
where lots of people have not yet participated. My guess is that there will be
no interest rate moves until after 2000, because no one knows how people will
respond to this issue, and I think the AG will be very careful about making any
monetary moves that might exacerbate a natural trend for people to move money
out of the market as we approach the millenium.

OT re shorting (gosh I'm so easy to goad into posting about shorting on this
hallowed ground -- sorry! Though there is a snippet or two about value buying
of distressed junk bonds, and USU...)

(I think Ben must be turning in his grave, not smiling! ;-)

There's four types of shorting that I can think of off the top of my head:
- overvalued stock (but otherwise good company, management, business)
- arbitrage
- bankruptcy-in-the-making
- fraud/scam/pump 'n dump/hype

I've done each type except for arbitrage. Category #1 has always, every single
time, lost me money (SBUX. AOL. SBUX again. Japanese Yen. Canadian Dollar).
Categories 3 & 4 have been surprisingly profitable and worthwhile. I think
James is suggesting that Sunbeam falls into category 3, which I hadn't thought
of but suppose it might very well. Now I've gotta follow up on his lead... ;-)

One kind of bankruptcy-in-the-making can be remarkably easy to analyze is the
case in which a company has overburdened itself with so much debt that recovery
is likely impossible, even if all sorts of things go right. For an aviation or
racing analogy, think of it as getting behind debt's power curve. One good
short of this type that I made was the gold miner Royal Oak, which had piled on
so much high interest debt that no matter what happened (even if gold went to
$375 an ounce the day after I shorted the stock), the common shareholder equity
was doomed. No matter how you ran the numbers, it was only going to be a matter
of time before the creditors ended up owning the pieces, the only uncertainty
was the exact timing. In many of these cases the company survives, though
through bankruptcy restructuring the creditors end up taking a haircut and
owning the company (and the former common shareholders lose essentially 100%).
In the case of Royal Oak I suspect it will be broken up and the creditors will
be very unhappy with what little they recover.

I'm also short funeral home consolidator and operator Loewen Group. In this
case I think the common stock is worthless with a safety factor of several
times, even though I am sure that the underlying business will continue to
operate and continue to be profitable -- it's just that during their crazy "no
price is too high" rollup days they took on too much debt ($2.2B). Overpaying
for your acquisitions with stock is bad, bad, bad. But overpaying for your
acquisitions with debt is so much worse it can be lethal. The former dilutes
shareholder value, the latter can eliminate it. Interestingly, I felt that
their bonds were trading cheaply enough and their business was viable enough
that I felt the bonds represented good value (hah! so that's a pice of on-topic
value investing for ya!). I ended up shorting a small amount of their common
(at $3 Cdn) and buying a larger amount (7X more) of their '02 bonds (at 50).
Each side of this trade has gone well so far, though I think it is unusual to
have such a stable, well defined business such that one can be confident enough
one's valuation of the company such that you're willing to bet against both the
stock market and the bond market at the same time. At this point FWIW the
common is at $1.8 Cdn (having traded as low as 30 cents) and I'm thinking of
shorting some more, and the bonds are now up to 66 (I won't buy any more at
that price, but I will hold what I have either until maturity, for a YTM of
about 30%, or debt restructuring -- who knows, it's not out of the question
that I might yet turn out to be a long term shareholder of this company I've
shorted!).

W.r.t. Sunbeam the thing to figure is, if management is able to somehow run it
as a top flight profitable business (for its category), would they fall
significantly short of the required interest payments? If so, then the outcome
for the common equity is inevitable (zero, sooner or later). What happens to
the value of their bonds and debt is less clear and more dependent on the path
taken by management and creditors -- one would have to be fairly confident of
one's analysis before wading into the bond arena.

James, it is interesting to know that you're going short (one can use it as
either a bearish or bullish indicator ;-). Something you have not mentioned
though, and is critically important for us to have in order to understand your
outlook, is the size of your short positions w.r.t. your total equity and/or
your total long positions. This size would tell us whether you're thinking
about a long term outlook (a relatively small, defendable short position that
could be held more or less indefintely without the need to use stop losses),
for the short term (a larger, more vulnerable but more aggressive short
position -- stop losses needed for this size position), or about blowing your
brains out (far too big a position to hold or defend, always a coupla ticks
away from suffering a "permanent loss of capital" -- I just love that
Buffettism!).

FWIW my small taxable trading account is 88% short, 0% long (I find it so hard
to find stocks to buy, even though this is one of my favorite threads!), which
is less leveraged than it has been and yet I am trying to further reduce my
short position (because of the high margin requirements on the low price stocks
I find myself short now, I'm only 11.5% away from a margin call, which is far
too close for prudence). My tax sheltered account (2.4X as large as my trading
account) is 0% short (not possible to short in it), 32% cash, 35% long equities
(USU and SRG.TO arbitrage) and 33% junk bond (LWN) (should probably be thought
of more as a pseudo equity play than a "bond" grade investment as such).

So James, how short are ya? Just because there's an idiot stock that's
overvalued 50X beyond all possible reason doesn't mean the market won't get
even more irrational and drive you into insolvency in the short term, even if
you're right in the long term. Shorting highfliers, or (way?)overvalued good
companies strikes me as a one dimensional bet -- you're counting on a severe
market correction or better. If you're wrong, you lose the bet.

I've been very bearish since the summer of '96 when I realized that the little
bit of money I had just so easily (a double!) made on Iomega had just been way
way too easy, and therefore the market was going to crash by October (of '96).
My impeccable market timing record has continued to date... :-(

That's why I try to add another dimension to my shorts. If I'm shorting a fraud
or a bankruptcy-in-slow-motion-before-your-very-eyes, it can succeed (as a
short) even if the market doesn't crash. I'm assuming that this sort of short
would also do well in a crash too.

Interestingly, I think some of the high fliers might be more attractive (and
safer!) shorts *after* a market cash. Amazon sure seems to suck as a business,
but they do have a lot of cash to burn and so long as the market has not
broken, there is the not insubstantial risk that they can continue to raise
money to burn through more debt or stock sales, and succeed in bucking off even
determined shorts. But if the spirit of the market breaks and Amazon falls to
(say) $25, it could (I haven't run the numbers) be an excellent short, safe
enough to take a much bigger position in, on the assumption that their future
access to cash would be cut off (people no longer in the mood to give them
money to burn). Until the irrational exuberance breaks though, I just can't see
how it would be safe to take a large enough position in Amazon.

W.r.t. whether we have a crash of historic proportions and whether it happens
sooner or later, I think I finally understand enough to say that I just don't
know. I think it is a very real possibility, and it would be foolish to bet
against a crash, however it doesn't strike me as a sure thing to bet *on* a
crash happening either. What I will say is that I fear (and predict!) that the
average stock portfolio today will probably be worth about the same in ten
years, though I don't pretend to know the details of how it might get there
from here. I am bothered when I think about how most people I know would be
truly financially hurt by no growth over ten years, let alone a psychologically
damaging crash (and the irrational responses that that would surely engender).

Airlines
I missed Wall Street Week tonight - I made a note to watch it because Julius
Malthutis was on, but the Phillies and Braves had a great baseball game going
at the time complete with beanballs and fights. Even Julius can't beat that. I
know Julius well and there is nobody in the world who knows the airline
industry better than he does. The man is a real analyst - he's about 60 years
old and has been covering the industry forever. He has forgotten more about the
industry than anybody else knows. The man is stuck in a game where 27 analysts
cover AOL and 27 have buys on the stock at 155 times earnings. And he is one of
a handful that have a buy on an industry leader trading at 6 times earnings. He
has been wrong for a long time on the industry but I think he'll be proven
right five years from now.

I would point you, as would he, to AMR, which I own big professionally. If you
want to deal with airlines - there are many reasons not to, most of them are in
the price - you don't need to look beyond this one. If you look at AMR
carefully and aren't interested, don't bother looking at any other airline -
you won't like them either.

If you back out AMR's 83% stake in Sabre and recognize that the pilot sick-out
in February cost them about $1.50 a share, the airline trades at 5 or 6 times
earnings. The company has bought back something like $2.5 BILLION worth of
stock in the last two years. In my opinion - AMR has the best management by far
among the global airlines, and has for the last 20 years - Herb Kellaher of
Southwest is in another league, but that stock trades at three times AMR's
valuation.

As an airline analyst, I have written memos listing 15 reasons not to own
airlines. 20 of those 15 reasons are in AMR's price at 65.So don't tell me this
is a lousy industry - I know that. Everybody knows that. Except maybe Julius,
who has followed the industry for at least 20 years. His thesis since I've
known him is that things have changed. And his argument makes sense. AMR is not
a Buffett stock by any means. But should it trade at 1/5 of the market
multiple? No way.

Take the first two sentences out of that, add to it the fact that Congress is
going to either give us a big tax cut or a big spending increase (probably both
- gotta love democracy), and you might see why I think Greenspan has a
hairtrigger to tighten interest rates. And when the stock market trades at
insane levels, the second short term interest rate increase has historically
been the fatal one. Maybe Greenspan doesn't tighten - that's a nice analysis if
you own bonds. But for stocks just think about the risk vs. reward. Reward -
Greenspan doesn't tighten now, maybe we get a 10% move in stocks.
- Greenspan does tighten. Game over. Dow 8000 by October.
Those are odds I want to play on the short side.

I'll keep you up to date so you know that I am putting my money where my mouth
is. I shorted Citigroup yesterday. I shorted Amazon and TheGlobe.com today. I
want to do one more on Monday, preferably not an internet. The last thing I
want is correlated shorts. If I can get shares of Sunbeam I'll do that,
otherwise maybe Providian (credit card lender to people nobody else would lend
to, insane valuation, under investigation for its fee practices, book value is
miles below the share price...enough said). Then I'll dig in and hope I'm
right.

I am making no recommendation here to anybody else. I am not an experienced
shortseller - I have done two and one was a big loss and the other was a loss I
stopped early (though I was right a month later). And make no mistake, this is
a market call. I have made two of them, both bearish and both well documented
on this thread. One I was very right and one I was very wrong.

If the market doesn't drop 20%+ in the next three months, consider me wrong.
I'm making a prediction, and have acted on it, so you're not going to talk me
down now. We'll revisit this in November. Either TGLO will be at 3 or it will
be at 30. Amazon will be at 40 or it will be at 150. The Dow will be at 11,000
or it will be at 8,000. I will admit I'm wrong...or I might exercise my right
to gloat (discreetly of course). (But don't worry about me - I'm not the guy in
Atlanta - if I am wrong it would hurt my net worth, but its not money I need to
pay the mortgage.)

Jim, I don't agree with you.

I'm one who's not reading any of your short selling recommendations. My general
observation is that it's a loser's game for any amateur investor to say,"gee,
the market is so high, and some stocks are so obviously mispriced, ergo I'll
just simply reverse the process and start shorting some of the most egregious
examples." But as I've said before, my opinion is, the only way people are
going to learn that you will not make substantial money through shorting is to
short, short, short. -g- Then you'll see it for yourselves.

I will argue again for UAL. UAL is strong in the Asian market. Asia is coming
back. UAL trades at a relative low price to book value. Fund managers with
positions in UAL include Dreman (per Bloomberg Dec '98) and Marisco (p. 170,
Fortune, 7/19/99).

For AMR you say to back out TSG. TSG is trading now at 31x eps and about 8x
book value. Trading in a yearly range between 23 and 72, now about 63, what
value do you ascribe to TSG? When I posted here that I was buying TSG @ 27, no
one commented that they thought it was a value at that price. When it was about
35 and reported lower earnings, the stock dropped sharply back into the 20's.
So for me, I will have some difficulty valuing TSG anywhere near 60.

I also challenge the conventional wisdom that AMR is the best managed of the
large airlines. Crandell may have been the smartest of the bunch (hub systems,
frequent flyer programs), but he's gone now. Meanwhile AMR still has plenty of
challenges facing them - employee pay scales, South American routes, troubled
alliances.

Got to get my 2 beans in on this before people get completely tired
of this on VI board. Like everyone here (almost), I think the
major indices could take 1/3 cut and still be overvalued. And I would
not be surprised to see it happen in the next couple months. However,
I also would not be surprised to see another couple years of mostly up
with no corrections bigger than 10-20%. That said, I've been playing
the downside off and on for the last year - mostly amzn, amat, amtd,
mu, irid, and a few others. However, I've done it with put options
rather than short position. Anyone going short should read Michael
Burke's 90/10 piece and consider all the good reasons to do puts
rather than short (limited losses, greater than 100% upside, etc.).
My big winners in some of the positions mentioned have more than made

James,OT follow up-shorting SOC

FWIW, My .02, shorting bad companies that deserve to go in the dumper is not
off topic and 100% relevant to the thread.

I'll assume you know Sunbeam's history. Sunbeam has 2.2 billion of debt, four
businesses that are mediocre at best and are currently losing a fortune every
quarter, and still bleeding cash profusely a year after everybody forgot about
them. 

Including me! No I have not followed SOC since enjoying Chainsaw Al's
well-deserved come-uppance last year. Unfortunately he left quite a trail of
bodies -- fired productive employees and deceived shareholders. His diatribe
"Mean Business" at the height of his "career," is hopefully in the 99 Cents
Store's cutout bins now--deservingly so. That said, I was not aware how
horrendous and perhaps irreversable a state he left the company in. And I
assume shareholder suits over the restated financials are still outstanding?
Yikes.

Still, SOC has a battery of name brands with some residual value....or does it?
Unless there is some intangible value, your point that SOC is still a short
even at this juncture is well taken. Too bad...this is a wrecked company that
did not have to be wrecked. Thanks for sharing it.

If you don't know why I shorted Amazon, you've been living in a cave for the
last year. 

I think not even Fred Flintstone could justify AMZN's value now :-) I admit
though I like Bezos' affable techno-geek nice guy style. Not a rationale for
investing in his company though.

Which brings me to TheGlobe.com. Go to the website theglobe.com and explore
around while thinking about how this could possibly make any money. I was
looking for an absolutely ridiculous internet company - here it is. The co-CEOs
are both 24 years old. They started this website when they were undergraduates
at Cornell. $3 million in revenues last quarter but somehow they lost $6
million on the bottom line. They have $20 million in cash left over from the
IPO and they burn it at the rate of $5 million a quarter. Start the stopwatch.
The stock is well off its highs, but this is a "company" that is overvalued if
it trades for $1. I was surprised I could borrow shares so easily.

Now these guys OTOH on a recent TV piece on net co's left me more than a little
underwhelmed. The only caveat here (an this is just an off the cuff general
thought) is can these guys get their hands on more cash to keep things going???
Or sport some "net valuation figures" like number of hits, that will give the
stock a bounce??

Best of luck

Hi, Armin. I just read the section of IDTC's description of its internet
telphony subsidiary - NTOP. The passage briefly mentioned that the internet
telephony market is expected to reach $1 billion by 2002. However, NTOP is
already valued by the market at $1+ billion! Barring that NTOP is going to gain
100% market share, it is currently overvalued at $23 a pop. Hence, IMHO, IDTC
is not as much of an asset play as originally thought.
%EOM----------------------

Date:8/2/1999 9:20:00 PM
From:Roger L. Chuchen

Sorry, Armin. I have no clue what the value of NTOP should be? However, what I
do know is that NTOP, as w/ most other 2nd-tier internet stock, is overvalued.
Remember that the estimation of the total availabe market (TAM) is 1.0 billion
in 2002! That's almost 30 months from now! Of course, when estimates are that
far out into the future, the actual figures could be dramatically different (to
the up or downside). Who knows? Maybe the market is worth 10 billion in 2002
instead of the 1 billion estimated. The problem is that internet telephony is
in its nascent stage and it's impossible to value something that has little
market awareness.

However, IMHO, if you're interested in soley an asset play, I would stick to
your ALSC pick as it has a lot of "hard" assets. Hey, it's worked very well for
you so far judging from its market price. I just don't think that IDTC passes
the margin of safety test. As you know, internet issues can trade at almost any
value exactly because of the uncertainties regarding their future.

CTZ, STC, FAF: (title insurance co's). Given the price being paid for CTZ, FAF
now looks undervalued to me. Pe, psr, p/bv look low. On the other hand, these
ratios have all been lower prior to the past few years. Plus, we are talking
about a cyclical business. Although, on the other hand again (I've got lots of
other hands -g-), FAF is trying to reduce dependency on title insurance with
their financing/banking, home warranty, and related businesses. I think (can't
find my reference though) that this stock is or was a Marty Whitman holding in
his fund and recommended several times by him in media interviews last year.

Overall, for value investors, I'd rate FAF now as fair-- okay to buy for
diversified accounts. Not okay to buy for someone who looks at macroeconomic

I've started a small position today in FAF @ 16 1/2.

According to TheStreet.com, the market is finally being driven lower by margin
calls. As Cramer puts, it, it looks like the margined traders have "forgotten"
how to sell, and the inexperienced online brokers don't know how to react,
creating chaotic margin calls and brewing terror out of fear. This could get
really messy.

OFF and ON Topic

I am shorting into this internet collapse because it is looking more and more
like the big one. TGLO broke through to a new low yesterday, then they
announced earnings after the bell - an upside surprise even - and the stock
went down another 15% today. I shorted TheStreet.com 10 minutes before the
close today and it dropped a point just in that time. If that gets to 19,
that's the IPO price, then see ya. Amazon is at its final support level ~86.
Tomorrow is key for Amazon. The reason I keep upping my bet at lower and lower
prices is that I agree with Mike, the margin calls have got to be accelerating.
And that could create a very quick death spiral for these things given that
there is no level on the real garbage ones at which real investors would step
in to buy.

And on topic: LKI, a net-net I posted in April at 7 or 8 announced earnings of
8 cents. I like this for two reasons - the company has been losing money, so
turning from a - to a + should attract attention to the valuation. And also
estimates were for 4 cents, so it should attract attention as an upside
surprise. The stock is now at 9 5/8, still below book value and right about at
net-net value. I would buy at the open tomorrow if it wasn't already 25% of my
portfolio.

It is very interesting to watch all of this internet stuff unfold from the

COO: I still like the company a lot. I call it a growth stock at a value price,
what in the old day's was called a "businessman's risk"
investment. They should make estimates of $.45 for the quarter ending
7/31. Estimates are $1.90 for the FY starting 11/1/99. It pays no taxes because
of large NOL's but reports on a fully-taxed basis. Company operates in the
higher growth Toric contact lens market where it will soon be number 1, and is
gaining market share. Company would be an attractive acquisition target for JNJ
and others. They bought back 6% of the outstanding shares at $15+ recently, and
would start another buyback under 20, in my opinion. Yahoo thread is the main
thread and is pretty decent. Coverage by 3 firms, probably going to 5 soon,
major institutional ownership, minor dividend.

If anyone had an interest, and owned none, I would suggest a 1/3 position at
today's prices (20 1/2+), 1/3 if it is dragged down 2 points by a general
market fall, and 1/3 at around 16. My target is high 30's over a couple of
years either through company performance or a takeover.

Eighteen month price range 52-12. A fabulous run got carried away and it was
overpriced at $52. A less optimistic view of the industry, hot money going to
the laser eye surgery stocks, and some now-solved company specific problems at
the end of last fiscal year and the beginning of the current one took it to
$12. Since hitting 12 has rallied to as high as 25.

around last December and still seems an attractive value-oriented investment in
the ERP/e-commerce space.

This is my first purchase order since my poorly timed Health Maintenance HMA
buy mentioned on the Buffettology thread. Still holding alot of cash, but I'm
also beginning to see some good buys in several of the tech stocks right now,
and want to average into the market in steps so I won't miss things should it
rebound.

P.S. Even though I'm not familiar with Borders - were you aware that Dell is
locating a major manufacturing/distribution facility near the airport here in
Nashville? That's been a pretty big buzz around town for the past several
months.

Armin,

I looked at ITG, but didn't buy. It's certainly better
value than other "trading-system" stocks, but I looked at the
year-to-year % change in NYSE volume for the past 100+ years
to try and figure out what I would consider a reasonable
long-term growth rate - figuring if it was below that it
would be "good" value. From the data, I figured an average
year-to-year % change in share volume of 13%. As a result,
I would be interested in getting ITG at a discount to a
13 P/E.

Keep in mind that analyst's "projections" for this stock
are truly crystal ball guesswork. Give ITG a couple years
in a row where share volumes decline 10% a couple
years in a row and there won't be very much growth at
all. There's not much ITG can do about that and that lack
of visibility should hurt the P/E.

Anyway, the data is below. It was taken from the NYSE daily
data on the NYSE web site, and run thru a program to
summarize it. It's very rough and was done quickly. It's
pretty interesting to look at, even for those that aren't
interested in ITG.

Regards,
Stew

Anyone still looking at RAD (Rite-Aid)? Just hit a yearly low around 20. Its
PSR ratio is only 1/3 of WAG (Walgreens). Walgreens has a higher per-store
sales, though. It's hard to get a handle on these national stores because they
have been growing so rapidly, and many of their stores are acquired. Here in
the S.F. Bay Area, in my experience Walgreens tends to be the dingiest of the
stores, but who knows about the whole country. (And maybe the dingier stores
make more money?) If someone is interested in this area, LDG (Long's) trading
at 34 is a California/Hawaii drug store. I understand that it's true book value
is higher than the reported $16.50, because they carry so much land at original
purchase price. It has been rumored that Longs will be bought out, but I don't
know by who. Maybe Wal-Mart or ??

For those who want to be defensive with their investments now, I think LDG or
RAD would be pretty defensive. No guarantees though!

Paul, Re: ALR. Net Cash is actually a bit more than $4, according to my
calculations.

As of March 31:
Cash and equiv. 11,542
Restricted Cash 11,336
Restricted Deposits 6,737

Notes Payable 5,330
Curr. Maturities 556
LT Debt 4,008

Net Cash 19,721

Shares O/S 4,830

Net Cash per Share $ 4.08

Part of that cash is from "Advance Payments on ontracts", but still,
that seems like a lot of cash for a $4.75 stock.

On Backlog: Just to confirm your point: As of June 23
press release, backlog was up to $65 MM, from $26 MM on 3/31.
That definitely gives them some breathing room.
The 6/23 press release also highlighted that the latest order was
to a new customer, which should lower their reliance on Saudi Arabia.
That is quite welcome.

Paul, we had a brief conversation some months ago on the manufactured
housing market. I see from your posts that you went ahead with it.
(I had reported that I did not like what I saw when I investigated).
Hope your timing was late enough to avoid recent downturn.
At least with Clayton, you probably got one of the better ones.

Paul, forgot to mention in my last post another Aerospace/Defense company that
has some of same look as ALR. I.e., selling at half of book value, making some
money, etc. Background summary:

Fairchild Corp (FA). Largest maker of aerospace fasteners (rivets, etc.). Has
been peeling off non-core
businesses. Recently sold interest in a canning operation in Turkey (not a
turkey canning operation :o)). Have
announced intent to sell parcel owned on Long Island, on which they are
finishing development of a shopping
center. These two sales will ease leverage, which is high following purchase in
April of one of their larger
competitors. The slimming down to core activities suggests that they may be
sprucing the company up for sale. The stock is controlled by the Chairman. The
chairman's son has been taking an increasing role as top manager (now COO).
While their net cash isn't too high, they are selling at under half of book
value.

Don't confuse them with FAF, of course!

Today I raised a bit of cash, stepping aside of some of the American Power
fallout, at the same time buying a bit more Tricon Global.

Situations I'm watching include:
Mattel: getting ready to touch old lows; a low risk buy at those levels, with a
quick sell stop at any new low

Philip Morris: moving towards its lows again; same deal as Mattel

Waste Management: could this be a bottom? the cash flow is tremendous and the
debt is weighing too heavily on investors' minds IMO. I was just waiting for
some stability.

Bebe: Eegad. I know. Ridiculous fad. And I've criticized it in the past. But it
is a branded specialty retailer that posted 18+% SSS growth in July, leading
the industry. They have barely penetrated any markets. Managing huge returns on
equity and assets, and strong cash flows. This one has a long way to grow and
after reviewing the competition, I like this one best after its recent 50%
price cut.

Pulte: the cheapest of the home builders, with the best balance sheet and
lowest p/b. insiders are buying, though the interest rate boogey looms large.

WAMU: I still like Washington Mutual here.

Berkshire: Buying this during a market correction leverages the low price and
the known opportunity for Warren to reinvest the GenRe money.

Callaway Golf: OK, it's round-tripped to its lows. I'm going to be patient, but
hey kids it has a decent dividend and the premier brand.

Waiting for some tax-loss selling in some of these.

Michael, if i may put my 2c in on some of your items.

Pulte: While I haven't looked at them, I have looked at other builders, and
decided their PE's are chronically depressed. It's not just "the cycle". That's
what I told Paul when he was looking at them. And I believe it still holds.
(You might look at any of them as being at the bottom of their trading ranges,
however.)

Callaway: As a golfer, I'd dispute the "premier" brand label. Adams is hitting
them on the low handicap end, as well as the traditional outfits. And those
Orlimar infomercials make them look terrible!

Berkshire: As a long-time holder, I'm a big fan. And while I'm frustrated by
the weakness in the stock price, it sure seems like a buying opportunity.
Especially with the fallout in the "deferred income/growth" stocks (my term),
people may start looking at things more in Warren's way, and Gillette and Coke
should get their problems worked out.

All offered fwiw and imho.

Mike, my two cents too, though your picks are probably worth 4 cents. I don't
know how you do it with a full time job.

Waste Management I would be very careful with. I said that (maybe not here)
after the first drop because their accounting is scary. I leave the job of
picking bottoms in those to those who don't read financial statements - and
there are plenty of them. Mike is not in that category, so this is meant as a
heads up.

Philip Morris and Mattel with stop losses if they break 35 and 22 seems like a
high upside no downside strategy. I would just buy either and hold them, but
Mike's strategy is probably better.

Calloway I'm wary - I just don't see the people who bought the product two
years ago (including me) even interested in improving their golf bag. The
product is so good you don't need to buy another one. The market is saturated.
And if I were interested in buying a golf club manufacturer (and I am because
as Mike knows they are so damned cheap) I would go for Adams, which is
borderline net-net and has a new product. I do not own the stock, so do your
own homework.

That brings me to Berkshire. I bought B Shares for 1956 late December - caught
the bottom perfectly thanks to Wayne on this thread. I was up 25% in about a
month and am now very close to a full round trip. I bought shares for my mother
the other day at 2080 if that give you an indication of where I am on this one.
Insurance stocks are way down now, and make no mistake - Berkshire is an
insurance stock. Coke is below 60, Gillette is way off its highs. If you are
ever going to buy Berkshire, this is the time you do it, unless you are going
to be really greedy and buy it in a market crash. (I'll add then) Berkshire is
a play on all the things you know its a play on (Coke, insurance...) but it
also a play on a market crash. Because Buffett is holding $15 billion of cash
just waiting for a chance to invest it on his terms. This is a company that
will capitalize on a market crash like no other company will.

For now I am not selling my portfolio, but am short Citigroup, The Globe.com
and TheStreet.com. I would buy Ambac or Clayton (which I bought in my own
account yesterday) at the current price regardless of my view on the market (I
think Monday is going to be interesting).

Re: Callaway (as I've been hit twice on this) the deal is it looks crappy. We
can see no recovery, and we're heading into the winter again. It's bleak. But
it's at its bottom. It's still profitable, and those profits will grow, and it
pays nearly a 3% dividend.

I've got Callaway irons, Orlimar driver, Adams fairway wood, Callaway BJ
putter. What the good golfers I know (lord knows I'm not one of them) really
think are nice are the Callaway product. After using my putter, several people
have told me they need to upgrade. And when the golf ball comes out it will be
another reliable revenue stream. Really, Taylor Made golf balls look nice, but
they just imitate every other ball on the market. If Callaway can use their
125M to come up with a patentable all-new golf ball that is still legal, they
could really shine. Looks like their AR is still very high right now.

I'm not buying yet. Just like I'm not buying brk yet. But as the dog days of
fall come upon us, tax-loss selling intensifies, and everything goes on sale,
these are some of the ones I'll be looking at it.

I would buy MCK at 31, and I would certainly buy it after the drop today. WMI I
am much more cautious about. If you look back at the MCK story, the McKesson
side is clean - you can value it based on historical financials. Don't assume
it was fairly valued before the HBOC acquisition - I think it was way
overvalued then. But even if you believe that, it is not hard to crunch the
numbers and understand that you are not paying much, if anything, for HBOC. It
is probably not worth anything close to the $14 billion MCK paid for it, but
its worth something substantial. I see a $50 price target when things calm
down. It might take two years, but the value is there.

The difference between MCK and WMI is the balance sheet. MCK is not going to go
"poof". Despite a foolish acquisition, they have very little debt. If you're
looking at WMI, before you buy into Wall Street's "huge cash flow" story, I
would suggest you really dig into the last three years financials and look for
the cash. I mean free cash flow. I couldn't find much after all the accounting
garbage. Maybe this is the bottom - I did my analysis after the first drop and
said no way. And I am not willing to fish for bottoms on WMI until I am
convinced that Wall Street analysts have read the financial statements, or
until it is a compelling valuation. But considering the state of the balance
sheet, I didn't see anything close to a margin of safety.

I would be very interested in Mike's take on MCK. That's much more within his
circle of competence than mine.

Agree...unless MCK somehow shores up investor confidence before November, tax
loss selling appears a given. I'll be watching too.

Mike-- Interesting that you Value folks are discussing MCK. I bought
a little yesterday ($30)... just a nibble. I had considered WMI and
SRV, but felt that McKesson HBOC offered a better potential. Regards,

Are you referring to netting out intangibles leaving -1.5 $B in net equity?

The real value of the assets is going to ride on real earnings they generate
going forward. My contention is that we're getting pretty close to the real
scoop on this and 10x those earnings isn't bad for what many analysts have
praised as top drawer assets. The bear case on earnings is that the industry
guys have flim-flammed the former SEC guy and the accounting still sucks. The
further bear case on the stock is tax loss selling. I doubt the former bear,
but suspect the tax-loss selling will bring lower prices.

BRK: Y2K risk Gen Re, as of Nov 98, had spent 42% less than average insurer on
Y2k remediation...hard to draw hard conclusion from this, but it's not
reassuring. Berkshire, as of same date, had spent less than average, but not
much and hard to tell if non- insurance operation may have clouded issue.
Source data: http://www.bestweek.com/issue-pc/1998/pc113098.html

Hurricane Risk: From prospectus on Gen Re purchase
"SUPER-CAT INSURANCE. Berkshire believes that in recent years it has been the
largest writer in the world of "super-cat" insurance, whereby reinsurers (such
as Berkshire) assume a risk of large losses from mega-catastrophes such as
hurricanes or earthquakes. This business has produced pre-tax underwriting
gains of approximately $283 million, $167 million and $152 million in 1997,
1996 and 1995, respectively, but is virtually certain to produce huge losses in
some years in the future. Berkshire's present underwriting standards (which are
subject to change) seek to limit Berkshire's exposure to a loss from a single
event to $1 billion in excess of the premium earned. Prices have fallen in the
super-cat business and Berkshire's volume in this line of business may
significantly decline."
On greater risk of Hurricane activity:
La Nina years tend to be much worse and -
http://tropical.atmos.colostate.edu/forecasts/index.html
I saw a discovery channel bit on liklihood and potential devastation of a
Hurricane hitting NYC...More likely and more destruction than you'd think. If
one heads that way, I'd consider shorting Berkshire 'till it passes.
The Hurricane season ends Nov 30 [officially - but someone may forget to tell
the Hurricanes that]. The Y2k selloff could extend to end of year or beyond, if
there is a serious problem.
None of this is real hard data, of course, just food for thought and
discussion.

would buy MCK at 31, and I would certainly buy it after the drop today. 

Would you? Are you? I'm thinking right now it is maybe fairly valued. The
business economics are not that good. With Medicare getting involved in drugs,
well that's an argument against anything to do with drugs, including the
pharmas. MCK is the dominant player. No doubt. But the business is not really
that great a business. Is HBO a good business? Who knows, really. There's a lot
risk here still.
You're still talking about razor thin margins, and it is going to be in the
gov't's interest to erase them. MCK gets to be a value stock when it looks like
Ingram or Tech Data did at their bottoms. Too many people like it and the tax
selling hasn't even started. The market looks like it's going to leg down
something nasty. I ain't touching any of the fallen angels yet. In fact, now I
upped my cash again yesterday and am not anxious about putting it back in again
anywhere right now. Looking forward to the fall.

About that Miller. Well, he's taken big positions in some fallen angels lately,
only to see them crumple. Does anyone have insight into his strategy. Is it
just buy the biggest fallen angels? Jim, I know you can't comment, but this is
for the thread.

How have your shorts done?

Meanwhile, I almost pulled the trigger when Callaway hit its old lows (way too
cheap given its balance sheet and dividend and dominating position) and now it
bounces 15%. I'll wait again... Champion continues to spiral. Clayton still
bouncing along old lows. Score one more for James.

Something grabbed hold of Analysts International today. Apple and YUM too.
Happy days are here again. ;)
