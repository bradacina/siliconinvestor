"It looks like grandpa and grandpa furniture stuff that people are trying to
sell in craigslist after they passed away."

That's funny. Not my taste either, but furniture taste varies greatly in this
country. California contemporary, New England colonial etc. Did you notice the
brand names that FBN offers; Broyhill, Drexel Heritage, Henrendon.....names
recognizable as prizes on game shows like The Price is Right when I used to
watch it.
To me it's game show prize furniture with a New England hotel look.

I like the idea of investing in apt. building stocks. Owning rental property
has become more lucrative as less people are buying homes. I have apt. reits in
my folio. I don't know any apt. builder stocks.

A while back we had a discussion on the farm cycle on this thread. No one
posted a definitive answer on where we are on that cycle right now. According
to this article we are now at.......

Sergio - good point. I am aware of it and thats why XYL can make a LOT of money
from Analytics.

Every coin has 2 sides to it. You need gas - cheaper and cleaner fuel. If you
read a recent report by Exxon, they say, natural gas will surpass coal in
another 10 or 15yrs. SO the question is " What can we do to create win win
situation"

Well, make pretty strict standards for the industry, make sure they are
monitored, water quality is maintained! and then who makes the money? People
like XYL?

Now i can always be wrong, however, i don;t think in this case i am. I guess we
will see :)

And Sergio, are you a FA?

FBN - I do think it is oversold (they missed revenue by a few million and had
more than 100 million removed from their market cap; Look at the balance sheet
and they should be worth $2 - $3 per share if they get to cash flow positive
which would seem achievable (given their management team it is far from a sure
thing however). I'd be interested in FBN if it got much under $1 per share. But
I think people are right not to like the business (Broyhill used to be good
furniture but I think they make it cheap these days instead of good, so I
wouldn't be surprised if they continue to write down those trademark values in
the future).

I did add a little more AVTR recently and also reentered JOE recently. Just
small positions. Wouldn't mind adding a home builder if somebody could develop

AGL Resources Inc. (AGL)

Picked up some AGL on the close to add to my other shares (I will avg up from
my previous buys). AGL was trading a bit funny the last two secession since it
is going to be added to the S&P 500. Their Forward PE is still quite attractive
at 12.7 when compared to their peers at 15.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------

UGI Corp. (UGI)

Was also looking at UGI as it was getting close to my earlier sales price @
$27.30/share (7/14/2010). This was one I wanted to get back into as their
Forward PE is now close to 10.

The article below discusses UGI's uncertain growth prospects when looking at
their margins: Gross, Operating & Net when compared to competitors. <u>The
bottom line is UGI is not that efficient. </u>

Here's How UGI May Be Failing You
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2011/12/06/heres-how-ugi-may-be-failing-y
u.aspx

This can be seen as a net positive for the company if management can make the
appropriate future capital investments to expand their current margins. <u>They
just may be in the middle of accomplishing this through recent 2011 investments
that should BOTH expand production and open up new (foreign) distribution
channels.. </u>

From their 2011 annual report Letter to Shareholders:
( 2011 Annual Report:
http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/UGI/1561421881x0x525804/687FC56A-C3C0-49
B-BDAC-1685020CE22C/UGI_2011_annual_report.pdf )

• In 2011, our Midstream and Marketing team announced a series of investments
in the Marcellus Shale region. These investments included the upgrade and
expansion of a gathering system in northeast Pennsylvania that will deliver
Marcellus gas to the Tennessee pipeline and a new $150 million pipeline
project that will extend that existing system 30 miles south to connect with
the Transco pipeline. We also conducted the first request for proposal for our
15 BCF gas storage facility in central Pennsylvania, which resulted in 100% of
that capacity being committed at attractive rates. We made great progress
during
2011 turning our Marcellus aspirations into a reality.

• We announced and closed the acquisition of Shell’s propane operations in
eight European countries covering the Benelux and Nordic regions as well as the
United Kingdom. This acquisition provides us with strong positions in several
new markets adjacent to our existing operations, and strengthens our European
business through the addition of a talented team from Shell. With this most
recent acquisition, our European propane business now operates in 16 countries,
delivering more than 700 million gallons of propane annually.

• In October, we announced our intention to acquire Energy Transfer Partners’
propane distribution businesses, Heritage Operating, L.P. and Titan Energy
Partners, L.P. This transaction represents an exceptional opportunity to expand
the reach and scope of our U.S. propane operations, and to bring the
high caliber teams from Heritage and Titan together with the AmeriGas team. We
expect that this acquisition will close by March 31, 2012.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------

Therefore, UGI is now back on my add list on any price below $28.00/share. The
company looks like they are in a position to take cheap Marcellus Shale NG and
get it into new distribution channels expanding their overall capacity. Let's
just hope they can also expand their net margins in the process.

re UGI analysis: "The article below discusses UGI's uncertain growth prospects
when looking at their margins: Gross, Operating & Net when compared to
competitors. <u>The bottom line is UGI is not that efficient."

</u>Okay, I agree w/your conclusion above. I don't agree with the fool author's
conclusion based on the article's numbers. There are two things of issue: Is
UGI doing less well than similar companies that are mentioned? It may be, I
don't know. (I'm interested in MDU, also have shares in TEG -- so if these two
have better prospects than UGI based on a margin analysis -- that's okay with
me.) The article focuses solely on margins. I generally only use net,
bottom-line margin in my analyses. Margins are based on sales. So sales growth
or lack of it has to be considered. Imo. If margins are decreasing, but sales
growth increasing -- that may be a positive for the stock or its earnings.
Since I'm also one who uses price/sales in analyses, if sales growth is
stagnant or even decreasing, but price has fallen further (resulting in a
historically low psr), the stock may be a buy for value investing. None of this
is considered in the article.

Right now UGI has a relatively high psr, and to my mind, a relatively high p/e.
So these are negatives. Perhaps expected given that more people seeking safety
seem to have been attracted to utilities, thus pushing up utility stock prices
(and these metrics). The author is right that 3.8% now is low compared to past
two years of 4.7% (peak year) and 4.5%. However, over ten years (not five
years), net margin now seems to be about where it's mostly been: 3.8% vs. 4.7,
4.5, 3.2, 3.7, 3.4, 3.8,2.9, 3.3, 3.4. Using five-year's data makes the current
margin look worse than it is, imo.

In the past ten years, stated book value has steadily increased (4.06-->17.68),
and the stock has moved up:
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=UGI+Basic+Chart&t=my
And dividends, while the yield is only 3.6% now, have increased too.

We may or many not have to worry about UGI. It doesn't seem to me that it will
be because the author sees a "low margin" of 3.8% or because the 3.8% margin
has shrunk based on a five-year number. I've not looked at gross or operating
margins -- I suspect if I did, my conclusions would still remain: UGI margin
numbers shouldn't stop anyone from considering UGI now as a buy.

Hi Sergio,

Would like your thoughts on Tetra Tech TTI.

W es ell them quite a few trucks.

Although they have several divisions much of their business that we sell to is
the handling of water.

Tetra was originally started as a mud salts company.

Environmentalism out in the gulf resulted in them not only selling salts for
mud production ,but they also have recovery systems which in effect recycles
these valuable salts.

They have a large division which serves the Bartlett and Texas Lousianna are
for fracing.

Their new headquarters building is about 3 miles from where I live and they
have been a very fast growing company.

I am biased as I know some of the key managers and they are a very good classy
company to do business with.

Would like your analysis beyond my bias.

UGI Corporation Common Stock (NYSE: UGI )

Bought back half of the UGI shares I sold (1/5/2011 @ $31.77). These are in the
IRA where the dividend is important.

I expect their sales to eventually increase from their $150M investments in the
Marcellus Shale area (upgrade and expansion of their gathering system & a new
pipe line extension). Hopefully their investment will provide them an abundant
supply of NG to re sell through their other distribution channels. Also in
October they acquired Energy Transfer Partners’ propane distribution
businesses. When integrated w/ their AmeriGas subsidiary (to be completed by
3/2012) their 2012 sales numbers should be higher. Therefore, they have
completed some beneficial transactions in 2011 that should help them grow their
revenues.

Analysts estimate $2.63/share for 2013. At a 14 PE (this seems to be where
their peers are) it may not be too unreasonable to expect $36.00/share. One
could make an argument that the stock is 28% undervalued from its current price
of $27.80/share.
It seemed like I sold my shares a lot longer than just a year ago. I am now
able to re enter the position at a 19% lower price. Like you pointed out they
have been steadily increasing their BV over the past ten years which is
something I like to see.

FWIW, I have been adding to my MHRpC between $24.50 - $24.75 as a place to park
cash. The thought was on down days to peel off some of these shares as a source
of funds but only sell them above par (par=$25.00). It worked today even though
the preferred goes ex dividend on the 15th. Was able to capture the UGI
dividend ($0.26/share) which goes ex dividend tomorrow.

I have been adding to my GSTpA position too below $19.50/share. I plan to use
this as a source of funds like MHRpC but they also provide a way to play a
possible buy out of the common as these would move quickly to PAR . I still own
a bit of TPZ (it even trades at a discount to its NAV) that I use as a source
of funds but unless you buy it low enough (say under $21.00/share), it's hard
to sell at a gain. In total, these three holdings (MHRpC, GSTpA, TPZ) make up
12% of the portfolio that I see as "cash" and/or a source of funds. That could
pose a risky bet for the portfolio.

Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)

Do you know what is contained in their "stated Book Value"? Can you really
compare the BV that Yahoo Finance shows across Large, Medium & Small Cap E&P
companies? When I scan the BV (as reported in Yahoo Finance), the large
integrated BV is about 60% of the market price some of the smaller E&P have a
higher BV to their market price and even Hess Corporation (HES) a mid cap is
selling near it's BV. Just on BV, maybe HES is a better Buy? (
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=HES+Key+Statistics ). They also have a better
debt profile when you look at net annual income to LT debt. (Disclosre: I do
not own HES but this is one I am considering based on their total operations).

What you see as diversification and diverse operations in Talisman Energy Inc.
(TLM), I see potential political risks in many of the foreign countries where
they have operations.

I have stayed with the large integrators and maybe the very large E&P companies
( like HES) when I want operations outside the U.S. & Canada. The times I
placed small bets on these foreign E&P companies, they turned out to be
loosers. I can get similar loosers if I focus on U.S. companies w/o the
political risk.

I am not saying that TLM is not a good Buy candidate, it's just not one for me.

TLM/HES. I'd only compare TLM's p/stated book value to itself over time. I'd
not compare bv numbers across companies with no regard to their size
(enterprise value).

You mentioned HES. That's another I'm adding to as stock falls. A little more
today actually.

Political risk is the big concern I have with all the foreign (non USA) oil
companies. or USA companies having substantial assets overseas. Given the
Halloween Massacre of Canadian trusts, operations in Canada could be at risk
too. Biggest country risk I believe I might see right now is Brazil; I've cut
back my PBR position substantially. China -- I won't place money on their

As I said earlier, "Ten years of steadily rising stated book value. Good

re Accor: have you looked at IHG (or IHG.L) vis a vis Accor? From a valuation
perspective, IHG appears to be cheaper.

AC.PA 1.3 Euro earnings, 0.6Euro dividend, share price ~18.2 Euro, very little
net debt
IHG.L adjusted 115pence 9month/2011 , dividend 49pence,share price 1090 pence,
600M pounds net debt

Based on valuation metrics, IHG looks cheaper. IHG business is more centered in
the US while Accor is strong in Europe, I think I prefer the US over Europe at
this time. I put in the numbers denominated in pounds, since i got it straight
from their website. Another advantage for us is that the ADR is liquid while
Accor ADR ACRFY has very low volume.I also believe tax treatment for UK

re COV I have done this several times, starting to average in the stock in the
low 40's, averaging out around 50$. The company has become more valuable over
time, mid-high single digit growth, ~1.8B$ in FCF (before acquisitions), good
balance sheet and a small 2% dividend.

the company has improved their metrice, gross margins went from the low 50's to
the high 50's % range, this is partly invested in R&D (Tyco was skimpy with
R&D, so their products were stale when COV was spun off). I believe COV
management is doing a good job executing to plan. It is imo a company that WEB
may like.

I may get this cheaper (based on charts) or I may not. I believe right now it's
as good of a buy in terms of valuation as it has ever been. I am happy to buy
more in the high 30's if it get there.

I never get the cheapest price on this stock and never went out at the top, I
always bought to early and sold to early, but I always made money holding COV.

National Fuel Gas Co. (NFG)

Stock to me is selling at it's higher end when compared to it's peers. Analysts
avg estimate for 2012 is at $2.95/share. That puts their forward PE around 19.
That's pretty high since peers PE are at 15.

(From Schwab Research)

EPS Estimates: NFG reported non-GAAP fourth quarter 2011 earnings of $0.45,
meeting the consensus estimate of the 8 analysts covering the company. In the
year leading up to the announcement, the consensus estimate had risen by $0.07.
For the coming quarter, analysts estimate NFG will earn $0.84 per share, an
increase of 20.54% over the prior year first quarter results.

First Quarter Earnings Announcement Expected: Earnings will tentatively be
announced 02/02/2012. With 8 analysts covering NFG, the consensus EPS estimate
is $0.84, and the high and low estimates are $1.05 and $0.74, respectively.

As an example you can buy AGL Resources, Inc. Common Stoc (NYSE: AGL) and/or
UGI Corporation Common Stock (NYSE: UGI) at a forward PE around 10, both pay a
higher dividend and both sell at a substantial discount to their peers (perhaps
as much as 29%).

National Fuel Gas Company Commo (NYSE: NFG) would approach my value zone if it
fell to $38.00/share - $40.00/share area. Their debt profile is very good but
(to me) not worth their premium price. Even at this price the forward PE would
be 13 and their dividend yield would be 3.5%. At that price I might nibble at a
few shares. Stock is priced 30% too high to be a potential value buy for me.

ZMH has shown very little topline growth during the last few years. These
orthopedic companies found out, that their demand is sensitive to the economy.
ZMH bought back stock more aggressively than COV. I think COV products are less
challenged by the weak economy compared to ZMH. So for me it is in question
that the 5.25$/share in earnings forecasted in 2012 are actually going to
happen.

SYK is a competitor to ZMH and has a better growth profile. It is somewhat more
expensive, but I think I would prefer it over ZMH. These companies tend to rise
and fall together, so it may be reasonable to buy a basked.

I think I like COV's products and devises better than ZMH. My biggest concern
for COV was their European exposure and what would happen to them w/ a European
implosion. I have not studied their regional sales coverage but just being a
foreign company has made me hold off on any new buys.

FWIW I added BAYER AKTIENGES ADS (Other OTC: BAYRY.PK ) to my buy list on any

re COV
>>My biggest concern for COV was their European exposure and what would happen

Check again, COV European exposure is fairly moderate, their business is mostly
US based. COV moved to Ireland to save taxes, their tax rate is only about 19%.
I also think there will be no European implosion for the European based
multinational industrials. Their European exposure is probably higher than that
of their US counterparts but in some cases not that much. typically, I see 40%
European, 30% US and 30% emerging market revenue split. For US multi's it's
more like 50% US, 30% Europe, 20% emerging markets. And since even Asian and US
home markets are somewhat related to Europe and vice verse, the net effects of
any disruptive event will probably look much the same for US and European
multinationals, with some difference in severity.

Punitive duties will be as high as 12.9 percent for autos from General Motors

“The move shows that China is always capable of intervening politically in its

“The automobile industry is very dependent on China for growth, and there’s
doubts about the pace of future expansion.”
Auto sales in China are rising at the slowest pace in 13 years, putting

carmakers post gains. Automakers declined on concern higher duties may soften

I like that management is quick to adjust their product mix and their current

Their move into emerging markets is not to sell devices but to sell technology.
They have several product launches coming up in 2012 and expect double digit
growth from emerging markets. For Europe,

<Our assumptions for Europe and what we've seen in this quarter has not
changed. The situation has not improved. It's still a tough market. We didn't

It's amazing what prices the large caps are paying for the small cap cloud
companies. Particularly high premiums are going to the companies being run by
former Oracle managers. These small players are being bought out because they
are stealing market share from the big boys and offer a toe in the door for
companies looking to enter this field.

There's concern that the premium being paid for acquisitions is going to hurt
the bottom line, particularly for SAP.

I've been studying Oracle and their problem, from a customer point of view, is
that their software does not integrate well. With more acquisitions, this
problem will continue to grow unless it is addressed.

I like QAD, symbol QADA. It's a small floater. The negatives...Little
institutional investment and no insider owns many shares. Co. has exposure to
Europe and has a large portion of its cash oversees.

But....It's a sleeper in the cloud arena selling for much lower multiples than
its peer group.

They are currently buying back shares and offer a cash div.at slightly higher
than 2% cash or share equivelant.

Company prides itself on customer service.

QAD generated approximately 15% of its revenue from selling software licenses,

a sum of parts analysis, imo.

Based on a preliminary sum of parts analysis, NFG does not look that cheap
either, although I may be underestimating the value of NFG E&P assets where
they have shown significant growth. The problem though with NFG E&P business is
that it's all gas, and that keeps getting cheaper and cheaper.

MDU Resources Group Inc. (MDU)

Good points on the non regulated businesses in these companies. Both have E&P
subsidiaries. MDU is one I follow and they are 50% regulated and 50%
unregulated. Their unregulated business include Construction & Aggregate (75%)
and E&P (25%). MDU's PE is only slightly higher than it's peers at 16 vs 19 for
NFG.

The value in the E&P operations for both companies is their land holdings which
as you point out is better analyzed through a :sum of the parts" analysis. I do
like the stability of the earnings provided by the regulated business and the
potential growth kicker that the E&P division can provide.

For me, it's just hard to pay a huge premium for that benefit so I try to
accumulate shares at the low end of my value range and then have inventory to
peel off shares when the company gets back in the higher end of their valuation
zone. I do notice that if some news is released on their unregulated business
(ie. Oil discovery, spin off rumors), you get a pop in the parent company.
That's where I usually will let a few shares go as over time, the price drops

XLS - sold my shares @8.4$, stop loss twas rigged. I normally don't do stop
losses, but I have very little conviction in this play, due to what i perceive
to be management that is misleading investors about the pension exposure.

They also mentioned in their 10Q that the pension liability is remeasured again
on 12/13/11. I also expect trouble with ITT stubs asbestos reserves. True their
received cash to fill the funding hole (~700M$) but I noticed they revised
their asbestos liability up by 238M$ in 2009 and 385M$ in 2010 and so far 91M$
in 2011. It appears to me that more likely than not, these asbestos liabilities
will continue to grow.

I mentioned this before but this ITT spinoff looks like "crap" was offloaded in
ITT and XLS, so that the CEO which went with XYL can start up with a clean
slate, except for some debt incurred.

Clownbuck,

Quick question on XLS: I saw that they made a dividend payment to ITT for $884
million and also had $662 million transfer to parent in 2010 (shown as transfer
on the cash flow). Do you by any chance know why those payments were made? I
presume in 2010 it might have been distribution of income, but for the $884
they borrowed the funds, so I am confused on that one.

"In connection with the Spin-off, the Company issued senior notes and borrowed
under a credit facility to fund an $884 dividend to ITT (“ITT Dividend”).
Specifically, on September 20, 2011, we issued an aggregate principal amount of
$650 senior notes (See Note 9, Debt) and on October 28, 2011 we borrowed $240
under a revolving credit facility (See Note 15, Subsequent Events). The net
proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and borrowings under the credit
facility were paid to ITT to fund the ITT Dividend. Following the Spin-off on
October 31, 2011, we will have cash and cash equivalents balance of at least
$200."

You bring good points on the presentation of their pension liabilities - I
don't understand why the BS doesn't show the deferred tax asset, but instead
there is $222 million of deferred tax liability?

I would think that the auditors have signed off that the presentations are
appropriate under GAAP.

Thanks for your thoughts on this one.

re XLS, the dividends were done to shuffle funds around amongst the 3 spinoff
companies. I assumed it was to make sure that each of the spinoff companies had
an appropriate financial structure post spinoff.

I am sure the auditors did their job and signed off on the filings. I am not
sure that management presented the truth in their presentation on 10/14 and
10/25 stating that the pension deficit is ~1B$ when a subsequent 10Q filed in
November states more or less hidden, that as of 9/30/11 the pension deficit is
really 2.1B$.

As for their business itself, I don't think it's in too bad of a shape, despite
potential budget cuts. True, they have exposure to Iraq and Afghanistan, but
many of their programs look pretty good and resilient to me and they have ~30%
of non-defense (air traffic control etc) as well.

VQ: The ceo's offer 8/29/11 to buy the company was for a price of $12.50/sh
when the stock was $8.30-$8.98.

It didn't happen. Now though, four months later, I want to believe the company
still might be worth more than $6.71/sh.

I added to my losing position today.

re XLS - i don't think i can answer that question. My belief is that the
pension liabilties are not carried on balances sheets. If so they would be
carried under non-current liabilities and there i can find only 188M$ in
post-retirement benefit liability there.

XLS gross pension liabilties are >5B$ and their assets are around 3B$ , for a
net liability of ~2B$ (I have this from a Moody's credit rating note).
Including these figures would roughly double the size of XLS balance sheet.

My rough estimate for XLS EV (including net pension liabilities) 1.55B$ in
stock valuation+0.6B$ in net debt + 2B$ in pension liability. I am not aware of
any 6/30 pro forma statement, i have only seen a 12/30/2010 pro forma
statement. There is also some big question marks about the assumptions behind
the pension liabilities, most importantly the assumed rate of return. I seem to
remember that XLS pension plan assumed 8.5% , which seems rather high, given
the near zero interest rates. other plan that I have seen assumed ~7.5%, which
is still high. Changing the rate of return by one 100BPS does not seem much but
has a huge impact on the net liabilities, given the relative size of XLS
pension plan.

Other defense contractors have pension liabilities too but XLS clearly stand
out at ~40% of revenues net liability (more typical seems to be <20% net
liability). This needs to be factored in, when looking at what seems to be
cheap shares. in addition, I would expect a 20% across the board reduction in
revenues when doing a valuation case, due to defense budget cuts that seem all
but inevitable. Enough said, I am moving to a different idea to loose money
<g>.

The good news is that selling my shares and ranting seem to have bumped up XLS
stock, if only momentarily.

Gastar Exploration 8.625% Serie (GST-PA)

An inefficient market can provide a "Value" opportunity. 

Today there was a seller of 20K preferred shares that wanted out of this
security. I noticed that the 20K share sale was made in the AM (extremely high
volume for this stock) which meant that the Market Maker was a forced buyer of
these shares. To square his book, the Market Maker has to lower the price to
attract new buyers. During the day the price drifted lower (as much as 10%)
until he made back his inventory of shares (those he was forced to sell earlier
in the day). Once that was completed, the stock drifted back up to it's open
day "fair value" price.

<u>This occurs because of the lack of liquidity in these types of securities.
</u>

Today I added a few shares of GSTpA (which I believe I got on sale today) and
swapped out an even number of fairly valued MHRpC shares.

These types of forced sales occur only a few times a year (unless there is some
negative company specific news). I suspect it might have been a large investor
(or institution) doing some end of the year closing transaction. Earlier this
month, there was a 90K share block that traded at $19.50/share. This has been
the previous price support level. <u>To me, the $19.50/share price appears to
be the fair value based on the company finances, where similar preferreds trade
w/ similar risk and the relative yield of 11%.</u>

-----------------------------------------------------------

The hidden fact is that Atinum Partners Co. ( http://atinumep.com/ ) has a
significant vested interest in GST. They have financed GST's 2011-2013 drilling
programs and are their JV partner in these deals. For more detail see my
earlier posting titled " The South Korean Investor - Atinum Partners Co. "
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27635227 ).

One of the possible end plays for GST is that Atinum Partners buys the company
and folds them into their E&P operations perhaps packaged and then sold to a
Chinese consortium. The GSTpA securities would then be paid off at Par ($25.00)
and even at some premium to par if occurred before 2014.

Thought there might be some correlation between the PAWN Shop company (EZPW)
and the junk/recycle company (IDSA). From the one year chart below I guess not
unless there is a lag between businesses.

With commodity prices more near their highs than lows, I do not see how they
are running at a loss. One analyst has them earning $0.50 in 2012. That's a PE
of 11. As you pointed out they are selling close to BV.

Interesting domestic play. I added it to my Garbage Company watch list. I like
it better than Icahn's CMC "recycle" play since you can buy IDSA at BV.

I will have to scan their annual report to see why they can not make money even
when commodity prices are around their highs,

re N OK and RIMM -
skimming my German sources, I think the reception of the Nokia Lumia phones was
mediocre at best in Europe. I also found this not too comforting story:
http://www.fiercewireless.com/europe/story/survey-nokias-lumia-shunned-european
-so-far/2011-12-16
RIMM had still 0.6$/share in earnings last quarter but their cash went down
significantly because of the patent purchase and swelling inventory.

The service revenues (from their proprietary email network) is generating the
earnings but I wonder how sustainable it is to charge their users 10$/month for
email, while same is free with Android or iphone users. Based on what I see, I
probably favor NOK, because I believe they have a better shot at surviving,
while RIM goes the way Atari or Minicomputers. The question for NOK is how much
are their normalized earnings going to be and how much blood sweat and tears
are going to be in between now and the new normal (which I think is going to be
lower than the old normal).

Either one is not a buy for me at this point and may never be one even if the
turnaround is going to happen, because I won't see it coming...

Subject: ITT Exelis (XLS)

Below I've added the link to the amended form 10 I was referencing. The 6/30/11
pro forma balance sheet is on page 52 and shows $1.26B for postretirement
benefits. Adding the 9/30 $661M re-measurement gets to $1.92B which seems to
tie to the $2B you site from the Moody's report.

I think they were allowed to just report the segment balance sheet in the 9/30
10Q which is why they just show $188M for postretirement benefits. You'll
notice that the parent company investment is still reported and not eliminated.
I figured this out when I tried to roll forward equity from 6/30.

From the form 10 balance sheet elimination entry (f) deducted the transfer of
the pension liability from equity through accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Therefore I'll assume the $661M re-measurement will receive the same accounting
treatment and also be offset to equity. So it sounds like book value is around
a half what one may have initially calculated from the 6/30/11 pro forma
numbers reported in the last form 10.

I can't believe they just realized a quarter later, they were short $661M on
the liability. Maybe I'm being overly cynical but it sounds like they took
advantage of some reporting loopholes between keeping $661M out of the final
form 10 and then reporting the segment balance sheet at 9/30, which also
allowed them to not report the pension liability.

I agree with you that the 9% estimated return on plan assets seems overly
aggressive and leaves them exposed if the markets underperform, which they have
been doing for onwards of a decade now.

Rex, great post. I believe you are correct that they took advantage of
loopholes to get the spinoff done. I see the pension fund like an investment
account and assume they should know the balance of their assets at any given
time. superficially they should have known about the shortfall on 9/30/11
already, theft they were representing stale numbers as late as 10/25.

I think the accountants and the management that facilitated this including the
CEO of XYL should get their ass sued.

IDSA - pretty volatile business, selling shares for 13$+ and then rebuying them
for half that amount a few month later seems like a prudent move, even if the
stock goes down some more. Based on the chart, I think 4$ is possible, could
you please ring the bell if that happens?

My thinking is that they are vulnerable to sudden price declines for scap as
their inventory declines in value and the prices of their input cost fall less
than those for their product (scrap) because of quoting and processing lag, but
I don't really understand the fundamentals well. At least that is what their
last earning report reveals. I wonder if other scrap companies handle these
situations better.

IDSA ( http://www.isa-inc.com/ )

I was thinking the same thing on the price lag/decline. The larger players
hedge their inventory but these folks are too small and are vulnerable to the
commodity price swings from when they buy and sell their scrap inventory.
Therefore, do you buy this one based on the value of their inventory in process
and the current (or future) price of the commodity?

So maybe BV is the starting point. Then you calculate the value of their "in
process" inventory. If their inventory turns over every 10 days then they
either lose or gain based on the price paid vs the price sold at the beginning
and ending inventory turn. The simple buy decision would be to see where the
alloy prices are trending over the last 30 days. If commodity prices are
falling, their "in process" inventory margins will be small. If commodity
prices are rising, their "in process" inventory margins should be large.

They only operate four separate recycling centers so every inventory turn is
important. They probably have different inventory turns for each commodity they
recycle too.

IDSA is thinly traded so you are probably correct to set a low ball "value"
entry point (below $5.00/share) and then sell at the 200 day MA price and/or as
commodity prices trend higher. It does not appear they are expanding as I did
not see any mention of adding new recycle centers any time soon.
