Good point regarding IDTC:

"Well....I normally don't look for an over bought condition as an entry point
on a value play.<g>"

IDTC has been heavily bought in the last two weeks, driving the stock up from 9
1/2 to 16 and change today. I suppose that with some technical systems, that
might make it overbought. However, my common sense tells me that it is still at
a low because it based between 14 and 17 for 6 weeks before it made a new low
in it's drop to 9 1/2, and it popped back up to recent levels so quick and now
has based between 14-17 again for a couple of weeks. I see the recent move from
9 1/2 to 16 as a correction of a ridiculously low price rather than
over-buying. Besides it is still just slightly over 1.5 pb, (Yahoo).

IDTC is moving up now! That's what the technicals say, right? If you guys wait
too long to buy IDTC, it won't be a value stock anymore. But, I guess we don't
want our value stocks to remain value stocks forever, now do we?

CLCX looks intriguing. I have heard of Computer Learning Centers. I would like
to know more about their product and how they make money. I would also like to
know why it is beaten down. Could it be that investors just got impatient
because the start up of 3 new centers cut back the earnings? It does not appear
to have any debt. Is this right? If so, I like it even better.

Charlie, KO has been heavily bought in the last two weeks, driving the stock up

Hi Bill,

As I remember CLCX had to restate earnings which caused one of those massive
50% over night drops. Then came the share holder suits and at the same time one
of the state boards of education climbed all over them for some minor
accounting errors. Recent news suggests they have cleared up most of the
messes.

I'll often pick something out of the NASDAQ looser list and track it for awhile
until it bottoms out. I thought CLCX looked interesting when it gapped down big
but there wasn't even a dead cat bounce so I put it at the bottom of my quote
page and more or less forgot about it.

Yesterday it caught my attention when it bounced a buck for no reason. 1K
trades were bouncing across the screen as fast as they could go. Like I
mentioned, day trading action really abuses a stock for a week or two after a
run. It sucks in a lot of slower players that don't understand the idea of
taking a 6%+ profit 20 minutes after taking a position.

There has been substantial insider buying in recent months in the $5 range and
it has formed a decent consolidation bottom pattern since it first hit 4 1/2. I
might take a position if it pulls back into the 4 1/2-4 3/4 range without going
lower. If support holds at 4 1/2, it should start heading north again.

Another little beater stock I have a small position in is ELCO.
http://www.marketguide.com/mgi/snap/A1085.html There are some interesting news
items over at yahoo. Yes, it's true, I use yahoo to do some of my research.
Most of the stuff I need is all in one place, although I usually go to free

REIT's ETT & Hi Yield Health Care REIT's
Just added to position in ETT today @ 7.75 with yield of 18.8%. I talked to CFO
last night and came away reassured about the security of the dividend despite
GHV PPS issues discussed in Press release pasted below.
Risk factors ETT is highly exposed to GHV & GHV has some uncertainty related to
PPS, but Merrill report indicated above average dividend coverage vs similar
REIT's

http://biz.yahoo.com/t/e/ett.html
Note: Insider buying by Lee McCreary, the CFO...nobody oughta know better if
it's real shakey.
The source of a lot of this pain, PPS, a ceiling on payments to nursing home
operations, could go away if these really start circling the drain. The
demographics of demand for elderly care call for more not less of these
facilities. The elderly vote as do middle aged folks charged with thier care.
When these voters begin to see the limited range of choices that have resulted
from Congressional attempt at defacto price control....it won't be happy
times for congressional types. This is the catalyst for favorable change...fear
of being voted out of office triggered by complaints of poor options.

ElderTrust Announces Quarterly Distribution

Highlights

-- Authorizes fourth quarter 1998 distribution of $0.365 per share, based

on an annual distribution of $1.46 per share

-- Addresses recent Genesis Health Ventures earnings release

KENNETT SQUARE, Pa., Feb. 9 /PRNewswire/ -- ElderTrust (NYSE: ETT), a health
care REIT, today announced that it had authorized the payment on or about
February 26, 1999, to shareholders of record on February 18, 1999, of a
quarterly distribution, covering the fourth quarter ended December 31, 1998, of
$0.365 per share, which represents a pro rata distribution based on an annual
distribution of $1.46 per share.

In response to growing concerns about the long term health care industry,
ElderTrust also today addressed recent announcements by its primary tenant,
Genesis Health Ventures, Inc. (NYSE: GHV), and other long term care operators.
Genesis' recent first quarter 1999 earnings release and pre-announcements of
earnings disappointments by Sun Healthcare Group and Vencor have heightened
investor concerns about the impact of the new Medicare Prospective
Payment System (PPS) on operator cash flows. These concerns also appear to be
reflected in recent trading activity for the healthcare REIT sector as well.

"We believe that the implementation of PPS is just one of several factors
impacting the healthcare industry and each company in the sector has a
different story," said Edward B. Romanov, Jr., ElderTrust President and Chief
Executive Officer. "However, as we announced last October ElderTrust continues
to monitor PPS' impact on our properties and we have seen no significant
deterioration in our portfolio's operating income. Furthermore, in spite of
recently announced earnings that failed to meet street expectations our primary
tenant Genesis Health Ventures, continues to generate increasing overall cash
flows and generates approximately 50% of its revenue from its pharmacy
business. As reported by Genesis Health Ventures Inc. in the above noted
earnings release, its net income for the quarter ended December 31, 1998
declined to $5.2 million from $10.9 million for the comparable period one year
ago. However, its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and rent
increased by 24% to $71.2 million compared to $57.2 million for the earlier
period.

Mr. Romanov added, "We also believe that the REIT sector continues to be an
under appreciated segment in the overall investment marketplace. Internet
companies such as Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, uBID, Amazon and Network Solutions
continue to attract significant market attention while REITs, on the other
hand, have attracted little positive attention since falling out of favor in
1998. This is in spite of providing attractive dividend yields in a falling
interest rate environment." ElderTrust distributes $1.46 per share per year
which yields 16.22% on a $9 share price.

ElderTrust is a real estate investment trust that invests in real estate
properties used in the healthcare services industry, principally along the East
Coast of the United States. Since commencing operations in January 1998, the
Company has acquired a portfolio of 27 buildings and has loaned $47.5 million
in construction and term financing on 10 additional healthcare facilities.

Certain matters discussed within this press release may be deemed to be forward
looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Act of 1995.
Although ElderTrust believes the expectations reflected in such forward looking
statements are reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its
expectations will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from ElderTrust's expectations include real estate
conditions, information determined in the course of due diligence review,
changes in economic conditions and other risks detailed from time to time in
the Company's SEC reports and filings, including its Form 10-K as well as
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and reports on Form 8-K. The Company assumes no
obligation to update or supplement forward looking statements that become
untrue because of subsequent events.

XPRSA TCAM --

Hi folks,
This is my first post here, since I just found this thread. But as a value
investor, I plan on becoming a regular if the suggestions and tips are useful.

I will offer the following -- I am a big fan of the trucking industry right
now. I think it is defensive due to the low valuations and since the foreign
exposure is limited -- real limited. My 2 favorites are xprsa and tcam. tcam
has very very low volume but is more undervalued. Both just released earnings
and made around $1.40 each for the 1998. Both had around $1.15 in 1997 and both
are expected to do $1.65 +/- in 1999.

http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=xprsa+tcam&d=1y

TCAM released earning last night and you can hear the CC over the net
http://www.vcall.com/

Let me know what you think? Oh yeah -- Not much activity in the XPRSA thread
here. http://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=21752
No TCAM thread. A few decent followers on yahoo. No issues.

Seem like relatively safe 15-20% growers with PE around 10. In 1997 the PE
ratio of XPRSA was generally over 18. As you can see here:
http://www.marketguide.com/mgi/performance/A0857.html

PE for the trucking industry has been 12.5 to 30.5 over the past 5 years
according to this:
http://www.marketguide.com/mgi/ratio/A0857.html

One more thing. With TCAM's just released 1998 earnings -- there was (.15) loss
due to results of a division which they just sold -- sold it because they could
not develop it. Sold it to someone already in that subsector. So EPS excluding
that loss was a bit higher. But they do not make a big deal of it and did not
separate it in the income stmt, just in the commentary.

upside, upside, upside...

grommit

Hi Bill,

Out of the three oil stocks you mentioned, I think my first choice would be
INT.

A quick glance through MEXP filings at free edgar would make me nervous to hold
this one over night. There was mention in the 10Q about price supported options
for some of the execs. My guess is that's where you're seeing all the form 4s
coming from. It also looks like they are in the process of issuing some more
stock. Probably to raise cash, which they are about out of. The last low would
suggest a continuation of the downward trend line, although it appears to be
over sold at the moment. My over all impression would be to avoid this one for
awhile and see what it looks like in a few months.

For that matter, the way the market has been acting this last week or so, it
may not be a bad time to look at places in your portfolio where you can take
profits and raise cash. March has a tendency to be kind of ugly, but it can
also be a good time to go bargain hunting.

I have followed and owned TMO off and on for nearly 20 years. I do not share
your enthusiasm. True growth in operating earnings over the years has been
mediocre and erratic, reflecting a mixed bag of operating companies, which are
often not the leader in their industry segment.

The company's apparent stellar track record until recently is largely due to
gains on sale of securities and purchase of companies with very cheap equity.
The music has stopped here.

Although I think these issues are largely in the price, I do not see what is so
attractive about their businesses. In other words, the stock looks cheap
compared with its historic high; but the stock would never have been anywhere
near there without the financial engineering.
Also, the one billion cash does not look so hot if you check the debt level.

Jeffrey, would TMO look better to you if they do go ahead and completely divest
companies not carrying their weight? For example I would like to see them
jettison companies like ThermoLase. If you read their boilerplate paragraph
explaining the co's business without knowing the name of the company one may
well peg it as a BB stock.

BTW, I spoke with IR yesterday. The rep said that most of the company's
problems have been self-inflicted, referring to structural issues, but they
know what the trouble spots are and are addressing them. He said expect a
structuring announcement related to Thermedics in April. Restructuring should
be finished by end of year or September (sorry can't recall if he said one or
the other or both). He also conceded the restructuring has taken a long time;
he speculated that may be why stock has gone from 20 to 15 recently. He added
Asia exposure is appx 15%. Plus usual things you'd expect from an IR dept worth
its salt: the NAV of companies and cash clearly indicate TMO is undervalued,
mgt. is excellent, etc.

My take is 11-12x earnings for a restructuring company expected to underperform
for the next 12 months is fair valuation. Given expected 1999 earnings of 1.20,
and _assuming_ they don't miss their numbers, I suspect this stock will
languish in the $13-15 range this year.

I partially agree with your conclusion. This is a heavily institutional stock.
I would expect periodic rallies as something positive is announced followed by
pullbacks. In other words if you buy at a low and sell or write in the money
calls on a rally you could generate a good total return in a stock that will
probably pretty much move sideways.

But I still end up with the question - How much revenue growth can be expected
in the future? While I agree the wounds are partially self inflicted, their
actions were done to maintain the financial engineering income. If they had not
had a strategy that eventually had to end up this way, they would never have
had the reported results that got the stock to $40 in the first place.

Grommit, the trucking industry might be a good value now, but a cautious
investor might avoid your picks XPRSA and TCAM.

That's because they are highly leveraged, with debt/equity of 1.35 and 1.44
respectively, vs. an industry average of 0.6. Operating margins in this
industry are typically 7.5%, which is slim enough that you can go from profit
to loss too easily if you use a lot of leverage and something goes wrong. So
that low p/e you are looking at should be evaluated along with the risk it
faces.

If you want to compare to an example of a trucking company with the best
financial model, try the 6th largest co. by market cap: HTLD. Zero LTD and
industry-leading operating margin of 17%.
http://www.marketguide.com/mgi/ratio/41670.html

A funny thing about trucking companies is that you might think they should be
cyclical, but there is also a counter-cyclical effect at play: when the economy
is good, they can't get enough drivers and the top line suffers. This is HTLD's
only problem at the moment.

Sbarros a Good Deal!!,

The Sbarro family recently agreed to up the offer for the shares it does
not already own to $28.85. Shareholders accepted. (I think it's still
light)

Today, Sbarro's closed at 25 15/16. That is a 2.9125 point gap between
the closing price and deal price.

I spoke to the company several weeks ago and they said they expected the
deal to close in around four months. I have not spoken to them since
then and there's been no news that I am aware of.

If the deal closes on schedule, an investor will receive approximately
11% (+/- depending on commissions and the number of shares purchased)
over a 4 month period (perhaps even less). This works out to an
excellent annualized rate of return for a deal that has an extremely
high probability of closing.

For those of you fearful of an imminent crash or the possibility of the
deal falling thru, a June 25 Put can be purchased for
1 - 1 1/16. This strategy surrenders some return, but it STILL works out
OK. Worst case if the deal falls thru and the stock collapses, you own
it for about $24. Not such a bad downside considering the family loves
it at 28.85 and I think they are stealing it at that price. A collapse
of course is a very low probability event.

Today, I upped my position with the PUTS. The net price I paid was
26 15/16 including the puts. I calculated the annualized rate of return
at slightly north of 19% after commissions assuming a 4 month closing. I
suspect it will be sooner and higher.

USFC also has lower debt.

In a low risk sector, I enjoy leverage. If you want to avoid some debt worries,
I would check out USFC. The debt is higher than HTLD but still quite low --
around 25%-30%, I think. But their revenue is around 7x HTLD. I think size
matters.

I think the leverage risk in XPRSA and TCAM is recognized in the
undervaluedness. Probable why they are lower priced relatively. Of course, if
they perform there is significantly more upside.

Thanks for your comment. I will keep your observations in mind and might adjust

OWN -- Sunterra.

This stock/sector is not a low risk area, but it certainly is a value play. OWN
just announced earnings and beat the numbers by a couple of pennies. They
develop and sell timeshares. Creepy industry, I know.

But check the basics:
http://biz.yahoo.com/z/a/o/own.html
Note that the analyst estimates are tight. They get guidance from the company
and buy into it. I think that is generally good -- as long as the analysts are
not sheep. (I am wary when analysts diverge.) OWN has a new CEO from REI (the
timeshare company) who is reputed to be quite outstanding from what I read on
yahoo when he joined the company.

Here's the industry:
http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=own+ffd+bxg+svr+vstn+twri&d=0b

The whole industry is undervalued. I believe based on the belief (fear) that
the economy tanks, and timeshares dry up. If you believe that -- do not go
here. But from what I read, the demographics favor timeshares as the boomers
age. Long term OK, short term risky.

enjoy,
grommit

PS - I do not intent to overpost and tout my picks on this thread -- but they
just came out with earnings, and it is one of my big holdings.

PS2 - Merril Lynch has a "Buy" on sunterra and has an analyst report on the
company which you can get thru this month. They have free analysis reports for
awhile --
http://www.mlol.ml.com/

Merril Lynch had EPS for 1998 at $1.18 est (actual 1.20) and has 1999 est at
$1.57 -- 30% growth. With ML recommendation, this industry and this company
have some credibility. :o)

Oh yeah -- $1.20 per share -- 30% growth -- guess the stock price -- under $12
right now.

Hi Wayne,

I'm not sure if you are into math or calculating risk/reward factors, but your
strategy is absurd.

Stock plus puts = $27 or $1.85 gain in four months, IF the deal goes through.
That comes to a little less than a 7% return. If the puts expire worthless at
$25 the loss comes to 8%. You should be able to get around 5% on a six month
FDIC insured CD WITH NO RISK AT ALL.

You are missing the percentages of each event occurring.

The cost of the stock + puts was 26 15/16 for me. The deal price is 28.85. This
is 7% +/- depending on the number of shares and commissions going out 4 months.
But it is over a 3-4 month period in which the deal will probably be closed and
you will have the cash. So the return MUST be ANNUALIZED. That makes it
approximately 21%. I had calculated it at my commission level at 19.3%
annualized.

If the deal does not close by then but is still on, the gap between the current
stock price and the ultimate 28.85 will be narrower as that date approaches so
the return will still be significantly above cash returns. Remember, the 2
point of profit already includes the money spent on the put at a loss.

The downside is the probability that the deal does not occur at all. I say that
is about 10%.

If I earn 19+% annualized 90% of the time I am fine if the downside is that I
own an undervalued security the other 10% of the time minus the 1 point I gave
up on the put. The net return of a series of transactions like this is still in
the upper teens percent.

You also assumed that if the deal does not go through that the stock is
automatically at 25. That will probably not be the case since the stock has
traded above that level all along prior to any deal.

The fact that Gabelli is buying Loewen and not Service Corp. should speak
volumes.

I didn't respond to this immediately because I had nothing to add to my
previous statement. I remain concerned about the financials, meaning that I
have a hunch that you don't want to use historical earnings to value this
stock. I generally look at cash flow statements, not income statements, and the
cash flow statement and the balance sheet paint a very different picture than
the income statement. Lets just say this. When I see a company with a 12%
return on equity being hyped as a 20% grower, I am very suspicious. If this
business were the gold mine that Wall Street thinks (thought?) it is, ROE would
be a lot higher than 12%.

The resignation of the President of the company today tells me I was onto
something. The conference call yesterday also tells me I'm onto something. They
completely failed to explain how they could have missed such a drastic change
in the death rate. This should be an actuarial business. If there was such a
sudden change in the death rate, why aren't life insurance companies blowing
out their quarters? Why aren't Service Corp.'s competitors posting similar
numbers? There is another shoe waiting to drop here, and I would be very wary
of buying this company before it does. I was instantly suspicious, without
knowing a thing about the business, when I read the initial press release. It
just didn't make sense to me.

When you're dealing with what you suspect are misleading financials, you have
to shift to a different level of analysis. First, forget the historical
earnings, assume they are going to be restated. Value the company off the cash
flow statement, which would take outright fraud to mislead on. Second, pick a
nonfinancial event as your buy signal. Maybe its justice department action.
Maybe its the resignation of management. The point is that I could care less
what P/E is because I don't believe the "E". Third, look back at similar
situations over the last couple years. I would point to Oxford Health and
Cendant. Then ask yourself whether you would have been happy to buy on the
first big drop? Or the second?

Maybe I'm wrong, but I was sitting across the table from an analyst today who
was telling me this stock is a no-brainer. I just wanted to respond, "only for
an investor with no brain". But I was nice. Maybe I'm wrong and this is going
to be a double in six months, but the only point I am making is that there is
still a hell of a lot of risk here if this story plays out how I think it will.
I have no evidence of fraud and I am not making accusations. I am only pointing
out what my instinct tells me is high risk which I do not think is in the price
yet. I've read a lot of 10-Ks and I've read SRV's. It made me say wait for
single digits.

Don, Here's a little more on my thinking about Sbarros.

I bought a substantial position in Sbarro's prior to the deal being accepted
because I thought it was cheap at the time.

The deal itself has been accepted by shareholders and the financing has already
been arranged. So I would say that the only way it will not go through is if
there is a market crash and the financing falls through. This is obviously a
very low probability event. Hence the very high likelihood that I will make a
19.3% annualized return on this investment.

Under normal conditions I would suggest to anyone that they just buy the stock.
The annualized rate of return on the position (a 3 point gain in 3-4 months on
a $26 stock) is very attractive annualized.

This gets me to my view on the market and why I bought the puts for this second
purchase. It's my view that the Blue Chip indices are discounting low interest
rates and historically high returns on equity as if they a permanent. My guess
is that those conditions will be impossible to sustain. On a "normalized basis"
I can make a very good case that the S&P500 would need to drop by 50%-60% to
reach fair value. I further believe that the global financial system is in much
worse shape than either the public, the Fed, the Treasury, the press etc...
understand or are willing to admit.

As a result of this view and the fact that I typically only invest in high
quality companies I am carrying a very high cash position for me right now. I
can't find any companies that meet my strict criteria for value.

I view my new investment in Sbarro's (with the put) as a cash alternative. The
combined position without the put is more than I would like to have in Sbarro's
equity at this time. In the event of a crash (very unlikely within 3-4 months),
the second batch that I just bought will have a very limited loss, if any, as
constructed and will still earn a very respectable return.

Life Insurance premiums are coming down rapidly in response to lower mortality

Re: Arbitrage opportunities....

You are quite right, for comparative purposes the return on such an arbitrage
deal must be annualized. I haven't looked at Sbarro deal personally but on the
face of it, looks like you landed a nice merger arbitrage transaction.

Also such opportunities are an excellent market diversification tool. The only
thing that is going to make Sbarro's price move will be a change in the terms
of the deal or (hopefully not) the deal is cancelled. So Sbarro has a market
beta of zero.

This reminds me of a mutual fund which does this arbitrage stuff exclusively:
Merger Fund. Last I heard it was closed to new investors but after reading your
post I will revisit it. Thanks Wayne!

BTW here is another arbitrage opportunity worth discussing here: has anyone
looked into buying closed end funds which are trading at a discount to NAV,
where the CEF is facing pressure from shareholders to go open end? Of course
the fund then trades at 100% of NAV and investors pocket the old closed-end
discount.

Re: Arbitrage opportunities

As for buying closed-end funds that are going open-ended,
I am in NEF (Scudder New Europe). It is going to be
opened, it has a good track record, and you can probably
squeeze 6% from it (you could have squeezed some more if
you bought right after the news). However, there will
be an exit fee if you sell the fund within a year after it
becomes open-ended. Also, it is not a riskless arbitrage
since you can obviously lose money if the European
markets go down.

I think Emerging Germany and Scudder Spain & Portugal
are opening soon, but their discounts are only 2 or 3%.

I have heard of investors that buy likely candidates
for closed-end funds that are going to open. As I recall,
the strategy was successful but nothing earth shattering.

BOSS (a stock I recommended earlier but sold) looks interesting
to me. Company has a tender offer for 1/2 shares at $25.00.
Current price is $16 3/4. Company had a lot of cash, now will
be leveraged, but you'll essentially be buying one share for
$8.00.

With $23 mil in shares to be left outstanding and a historical
$130 mil in EBITDA, this may not be too bad a deal. Any thoughts?

The 9/98 balance sheet is strong. Recapitalization is intended to give

$25/sh. On the flip side, this is the second shot at recap, and it too may fall
through. And then we're left with a company that I can't predict the earnings

When I first examined BOSS a few months back,

about CEO Ledecky. I do not take much stock in
them, but at the same time I am not 100% confident
about Ledecky.

Although I realized the originally plan called for
a 90% buyback from public shareholders (even though
buyback was only 50% of shares), I am not sure if
this is still the case. If so, that makes the deal
even sweeter.

It appears that BOSS will have the funding available.

TMO-final thought...

Those who want to play a TMO turnaround may want to consider the Thermo Oppty.
CEF (symbol TMF). It is trading at a discount of some 25%+ to NAV. AFAIK it
does not invest in TMO directly but rather all of the spinoffs. So I would
speculate they probably own as much Thermo Instrument Systems as possible and
then whatever else. If TMO is serious about divestitures and restructuring,
perhaps TMF will be the beneficiary as money losing spinoffs are sold or TMO
issues tender offers to pull spinoffs back into TMO itself.

Excellent idea, Mike, since we know that almost by definition the businesses

makes sense to buy the fund over the spinoffs. However, do you know if perhaps
TMO is selling at a material discount to the values of its stock holdings
(marked to market) plus other assets less debt? Then I would prefer the parent
company. But that might be tough to determine.

I took an initial position in Tidewater (TDW) today at 20 3/8. I know this is a
Mike Burry favorite, but it might be of note that the two of us came to this
conclusion completely independently of each other. I have never invested in an
oil related stock - its an industry I have always considered outside my circle
of competence. But after spending the weekend with Tidewater's financials, I
just don't see the downside if you're willing to hang in there even if it takes
three years. And the upside is that this company will be stronger and bigger in
the next good times for the industry.

Wall Street is focused on the next quarter, which looks like doomsday. I
recogize that. I also recognize that I can provide no reason for oil economics
to get better in the following quarter or the quarter after that or the quarter
after that...But who will kid themselves that they can see more than a few
months out in an industry like this? The point is that everybody assumes this
is a loser forever (in Wall Street terms today forever = more than two
quarters). I'll take those odds. But long term, the risk vs. reward looks
absolutely perfect.

As I'm sure Mike has already pointed out, this company is the leader in its
industry, has zero debt, and earned about $5 a share of FREE CASH FLOW at last
year's peak. It is likely to be free cash flow positive even at the bottom.
These guys went out last quarter and bought back 3% of their shares at very low
prices without taking on a dime of debt. The industry looks absolutely awful,
but the stock is down from 70 to 20. Once again NO DEBT. If the balance sheet
didn't look like that, I would not have touched it.

This company is worth over $40 a share by my calculations. It trades at 20.

2. Terrible one-year performance

3. Related to 2, it has owned small-caps like dypr and oils that

I initially became interested in Loewen around 1993 or 1994, when I first read

followed the stock for quite some time with the intention of shorting, however
I was unable to really nail down my understanding of it and its business so the
stock dropped off my radar until a couple of weeks ago, at which point I was
shocked to see just how far it had fallen.

I am now going to try and see if LWN stock has any equity value. As I
understand it, they bought a lot of money making businesses but overpaid for
them. The question here will be (I suspect) how much of the overpayment for
acquisitions they made with stock and how much with debt.

Wayne, a couple of ideas for those very nervous about the market.
1)Sell in the money puts on stocks you believe to be solid. Time frame should
be 4-6 months to give position time to work out. Example in Sept-Nov time frame
I sold Feb puts on cmo(5),bcu(5),zeus(7 1/2),and ldry(7 1/2). This is
equivilent to buying stock at discount from market price. Advantage, proceeds
can be used to buy treasury notes, and margin is only 20% of stock price plus
proceeds of sale. For example the bcu put was 2 3/8 with stock at 3 1/8 the
margin was about 3 but you have 2 3/8 in your account. You can also sell out of
money puts if you are less confidant of stock. Currently I am considering ist
and idtc as out of money candidates.
2) Sell close to the money leap calls against stock. Example, madgf at 3 7/16
and 2001 5 call at a 1 3/16. Cost 2 1/4. Double in 2 years if stock reaches 4
1/2. Protection down to 2 1/4.
3) Sell ratio of way out of money calls. Example long 700 shares of plat and
short 20 calls ,2001,strike 35. Stock at 13 1/4,calls at 2 3/8. Shares cost
average of 6.70. Must buy additional shares if stock climbs but my expectation
is a channel between 10-30 and more risk on downside than upside.
Also if your interested MAJ has news which I believe forbodes well for the
stock(MY average price is 2.80)

Boss vs Samsonite

I noticed that after the buyback Samsonite now has a negative
book value and negative earnings. Any buyback will increase
the volatility of earnings in either the positive or
negative direction. So with the negative earnings, the
stock tanked.

By my rough calculations, after the buyback BOSS should have
a book value of $8 or $9 a share. Assuming the earnings
stay close to what they are expected to be, I think that the
stock should sell above the residual value. Assuming that
earnings only stay flat from this year, they should be about
$2.50 per share (w/ 1/2 shares out ) - extraordinary charges.

I don't know how company will handle debt on balance sheet,
since they have had excess cash to burn for some time now.
This new leverage would worry me somewhat, but they have
pretty strong cash flows.

I have not myself taken the plunge into BOSS, but am still
highly intrigued. The reputed "slimy" management is still
somewhat of a worry ...

PENNZENERGY CO (PZE) SETS INITIAL DIV OF $0.0625/SHR

HOUSTON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Oil producer PennzEnergy Co. said Wednesday that
its
board has declared an initial quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per share on its
common stock.
The company said that the dividend is payable March 15 to shareholders of
record on
Feb. 28.
PennzEnergy said it is the first dividend paid since PennzEnergy became a
stand-alone
exploration and production company at the end of 1998. PennzEnergy was created
through
a spin-off from the former Pennzoil Co. when Pennzoil merged with Quaker State
Corp. to
form Pennzoil-Quaker State Corp. (PZL).
PennzEnergy shares closed down 9/16 Wednesday at a new 12-month low of 9-13/16
on the New York Stock Exchange. Its 12-month high is 70-3/4.

A Value Play in the Graham Tradition?

In this week's Barron's (2/22/99, p.20), "Sizing Up Small Caps" author Rhonda
Brammer gushes over "an intriguing speculation", name of Highlands Insurance
(NYSE:HIC). In the large font opening lines, Brammer enthuses that HIC, a
troubled p&c insurer that hasn't quite turned the corner, is "a $13 stock --
with a shot at earning $1 this year -- selling at 65% of book." Later in the
article, she hedges by attributing to insurance stock analyst Stacy Smith the
view that (in Brammer's words) "fully diluted statutory book is over $14 a
share."

Simple arithmetic suggests that by this reckoning the share price is less than
92% of book. While this still suggests a bargain, especially relative to
today's bloated ratios, it is not quite the totally discarded cigar butt that
65% of book would be. Fwiw, Market Guide puts HIC's price-to-book ratio at 49%.

Daniel: I looked at LWN a few years back, at the request of a reader who was
holding onto the stock. I don't recall too many of the specifics, but I do
recall that, unfortunately as it turns out, I was unable to convince him to
sell LWN.

My hazy recollection is that the principal owner had mismanaged the firm for a
number of years, and had failed to deliver on a series of reforms that had
repeatedly been promised to analysts and outside shareholders. For all I know,
he may be gone. But, I would't go near LWN unless he is already out of the
picture.

On a more fundamental note, there are questions about whether the funeral
industry affords significant economies of scale -- enough to warrant getting
into a lot of debt to buy up the small operators. Outside of using market power
to get the casket makers to lower their prices, where are the cost savings from
consolidation? Every funeral is still a one-at-a-time, labor intensive, local
affair. People aren't going to drive great distances to go to a super multiplex
funeral parlor. Would national advertising be more cost effective than local
radio spots and newspaper ads? Can they get labor costs below those of what was
typically a family business to begin with? I don't really know the answers, but
so far LWN has not been the Blockbuster Mortuary it was supposed to be.

To group: Uncommon value for software company.

I have hesitated posting this at higher levels even though at $6 and $5 I still
thought was a great value. AT $4, I felt now it is time.

I have followed this company since last October.
Infinium Software. (INFM).
The Numbers:

Stock price = $4.1875
Cash per share = $3.34
Price/cash = 1.25
Price/sales = .5
Price/book = 1.18
Shares out = 12.6 million.
52 week high = $23.25
52 week low = $4.125
Earings last four quarters
3-98 = $.10
6-98 = $.19
9-98 = $.20 (end of fiscal year)
12-98 = $.08 (this quarter is always weakest)
Average estimate for fiscal year ending 9-99 = $.63

These numbers represent a low valuation rarely seen for a software company.
WHY? The main reason is that INFM is an "enterprise software" company sometimes
called "ERP". Some larger companies in this area are: JDEC, PSFT, SAP, BAANF.
Compare the per share values of these with INFM , and you will like what you
see.
Wall street hates this whole sector now because there is a fear
(justified at this point) that this sectors customers are concentrating their
software
and Information systems efforts on becoming Y2K compliant, and thus delaying
other
software purchases. The good news is unlike some sector or company specific
problems
we can all be sure that the Y2K is a temporary problem. Once it is passed, this
should be more positively viewed again. Wall street (in its typical
short-sightedness)
sees this stock trending down, and knowing that it is probably "dead money"
short term
is abandoning it in favor of whatever is performing now.

Another Knock on INFM is that it was dependant on mid range (AS400) systems.
That is changing. The company has been heavily investing in , and creating new
products for Windows NT.

A little background on the price history. This small cap company along with
most other small caps got hit hard late last summer and fall with the market in
general.
Sector fears may have had a role partially then also, and the selling fed on
itself
until at exactly the wrong time (10-98) the company reported earnings that
missed by $.02
(came in at $.20) which crashed the stock from about $10 to $5. After a small
rebound,
it got caught up in tax selling, and slipped back down again. This year, it had
a January
effect rally, and after the most recent earnings report (which met estimates)
has continued
to slip for the reasons listed above. Which brings us to the value we now see.

I don't have any expectations of getting rich quick here, but with a 12 month
view,
I think INFM is a good place to be.

Porc, re: LWN,

Too bad you couldn't convince your reader to sell when the selling was good. I
was going to short it then, but just couldn't get a good enough handle on it to
be comfortable with it to be convinced that it would be an "investment grade"
short. (Hey, if I'm going to mention shorting on this thread I've gotta keep in
line with Graham et al. ;-)

The principal owner was forced out within the past year. If that was a big
problem as you indicate (I was not aware that it was), then that certainly
fixes that.

"Blockbuster Mortuary", I like that! True, the economic rationale behind
bringing many small funeral homes under one roof may have never existed. But
provided that the debt is safely less than the intrinsic value and the debt
servicing capabilities of the operation, could one not look at this as an
opportunity to purchase a a large block of viable businesses at a bargain
price? (If in fact both those characteristics are true! As I said before, I
don't know the answers yet).

I.e., provided the price is cheap enough and the debt manageable, who cares if
1000 funeral homes offer no economies of scale at all?

Something I find surprising is that industries which I "feel" to be very
expensive (for the value given), such as funeral homes, military contractors,
aerospace firms etc, do not seem to necessarily generate exceptional business
returns for their shareholders. It's as if their high cost to value is due to
inefficiency and not fat profit margins.

I'm not sure it's inefficiency that's the problem. The most profitable business
model has always been razor/razorblade--i.e., make a product, mass produce it,
and then sell it widely with little personal involvement. Personal services,
"made to spec", limited market companies, and companies in industries with
competitive bidding have steep mountains to climb to attain healthy margins.
Their usual path is oligopoly and overpricing, and this path is not always open
to them.

Hi James, (re: LWN)

 Has anybody done the work on the balance sheet required to address this
question?

Very briefly, crudely, and without verification (so far), here's how things
look:

Assume all liabilities worth 100 cents on the dollar.

Assume all the assets on their latest 10-Q are worth 100 cents on the dollar,
except for the last four items. I think this is fair (only serious fraud or
business deficiencies would undermine this)

The last four assets are "Cemetery property, at cost", " Property and
Equipment", "Names and Reputations", and "Other Assets", which all together
total $3331M.

Equity for Common is $1274M, market cap is $185M for 74M shares at $2.5.

So how much of the $3331M ought to be knocked off, leaving how much of the
$1274M nominal equity truly available for the purchase price of $185M? In order
for the company's fair value to be $185M, then those assets (the nominal
$3331M) must be worth at least $2242M.

Since I am assuming that they overpaid for their acquisitions to some extent, I
think what I need to find out is whether they overpaid more than 3331/2242 =
1.48 times. (Of course I have to investigate how much has already been
depreciated or charged against the $3331M sum already. I am implicitly
attributing these assets to substantially all of the purchase prices they have
paid).

At first blush I had been pretty excited about snatching this one up, but now
I'm not so sure that they didn't overpay by more than that amount. I think I
better look into it a bit deeper.

Japan gearing up the printing press?

Recent press reports have indicated that Japan may be more willing than it has
been recently to monetize its huge bad debt overhang, devalue the Yen, and try
to export its way out its mess. Fiscal policy has failed. (big surprise?) If
so, you can expect at least some of that flood of easy money to reach the U.S.
credit and stock markets.
The U.S. for its part seems willing to run however big a current account and
trade deficit is necessary to keep inflation low and our bubble up while trying
to bail out the rest of the world. This is at best a short term solution for a
world whose global trade imbalances grow daily.

This is more of the same from central bankers and other financial heads who are

show up. X-out this, and your margin of safety is quite thin indeed. I'm not

There's a technique that attempts to get at the answer of what the assets are
worth from the opposite end. First see what this company is really earning on
its assets, if anything or could earn. If it isn't earning 12% to 13% on
capital (ignore goodwill,) a historical roe for American business, then you
need to "mentally" write down the tangible assets to a level where it could,
even if the company hasn't got around to it yet. Kind of like taking a
premptive restructuring charge, which the company will eventually get around to
doing, just to get the returns to a "normalized" level.

Nice post. I share the others views. Based on your numbers I would consider it
quite possible that the assets you referred to are not worth 67% of the
carrying value (2242/3331).

I think the comments about there being few economies of scale in the funeral
home industry are on the money. In fact I would say that there might be
negative economies of scale. If your local mom-and-pop funeral home gave a
nice, personal, sympathetic touch to your grandmother's funeral, you are more
likely to go there for your mother
than if it is run by someone to whom it is just a job and not their own
business.

In my opinion, rolling up the monument business made a bit more sense.

Re: LWN, I'm not suggesting that one consider it under a "panic liquidation"
scenario, rather, a fair "going-concern" value for the assets they have. I
think that twister's idea of writing the book value of their capital assets
down to that which would produce 12% ROE would be a fair way of deciding just
how much to whack off. I'm not doctrinaire about not attributing any value to
the goodwill on their balance sheet, or for that manner any other asset. If it
earns its keep, I say keep it there.

At this point I have to discover what the earning ability (or free cash
generating ability, etc) of funeral home and cemetery assets are. I was
thinking about perusing Loewen's and Stewart's past 10-Ks to see if I could
estimate any of this. Though this seems to be a bit too self-referential, eh?

The other trick I have up my sleeve is to talk to a funeral home operator. The
only thing is, I have to find one who is willing to confide, and either
understands or can be taught to understand what it is I'm looking for (owner
earnings, free cash flow, true earnings, call it what you will).

Frankly I was surprised when I saw that the $175M price tag on the whole
enterprise does not necessarily leave a "jump in and buy without further
investigation" sort of margin of safety. I wish they had done more of their
overpaying with stock..... ;-)

Hmmmm, maybe there's another angle to approach this - their bonds (or
preferred). If I can convince myself that the business is basically sound, and
will make *some* money (though not necessarily enough to pay for the original
cost), perhaps one should look at buying some of the $2066M of their debt? Even
if the equity gets wiped out entirely, the bonds may be available at a
distressed-enough price that they may in fact be a good investment. I've never
done any bond stuff though, I've always counted on the senior nature of bonds'
claims to add value to my short positions. Buying something is so weird, it
feels, well, backwards to this shorter ;-)

Hi Jeffrey,

The point you make about avoiding the "big faceless chain" syndrome is a good
one, however they (the consolidators) understand this well, and have taken
great pains to avoid it. When they buy up the various local operators they
always keep existing management and business names. I recall seeing some U.S.
TV show on this (one of those aggressive, annoying dirt digging kinds) that
criticized this, basically pointing out that the supposed "variety" of
"independent" funeral homes in an area were in fact mysteriously and perhaps
sinsterly owned by just one or two of the big corporate operators, thus
depriving consumer of any chance at getting competitive pricing. Of course this
is something (lack of competition) that the companies would probably think of
as a good thing ;-)

I mentioned the "big faceless chain" syndrome as I was reminded of it just last
week by getting a letter in the mail soliciting some pre-arrangement business
by a local funeral home operator who started out his letter by emphatically
stating that they were not such a (horrible, by implication) chain and had been
in business for some 100 years as a family owned business. So it is being used
against them by the competition.

By the way, ROAC was the memorial company I was thinking of, whose price has
not collapsed. But one would think that if a key reason for the problems is a
declining death rate they would face similar problems?

Bidding War Over Southwest Gas Corp

Monday, 22 February 1999
R E N O , N E V . (AP)

SOUTHWEST GAS Corp. became the target of a bidding war Monday as
Southern Union Co. of Texas offered to top a deal the Nevada-based gas
distributor had already struck with Oneok Inc. of Oklahoma.

Southern Union's unsolicited proposal values Southwest Gas at $32 a
share, or $973 million, beating the $28.50 a share, or $866 million, that
Oneok agreed to pay.

Southwest Gas issued a statement saying that while the merger agreement
with Oneok remains in effect, its board of directors has authorized
management "to commence substantive discussions" with Southern Union.

The move by Southern Union took Oneok officials by surprise.

"We based our offer on due diligence, consultation with investment
advisors and sound business judgment," said Larry Brummett, Oneok chief
executive officer. "We believe our offer is fair, competitive and still valid."

Southwest Gas, based in Las Vegas, serves about 1.2 million customers in
the fast-growing region of Nevada, Arizona and California.

That growth makes Southwest Gas an attractive takeover target, a
Southern Union executive said.

"We believe that Southwest's rapidly growing customer base combined
with Southern Union's experience as one of the most cost-effective
operators in the industry would create significant value for shareholders,"
said George Lindemann, Southern Union chairman and chief executive.

In announcing its proposal, Southern Union said the merger would make it
the largest gas-only distribution company in the country. Oneok made the
same claim when its pending deal was announced in December.

Under Southern Union's proposal, Southwest Gas would operate out of
Las Vegas as the Southwest Gas Division of Southern Union and keep its
name in the local markets. Three Southwest Gas board members could
join Southern Union's board.

Southern Union's customer base would nearly double to 2.2 million
customers if its bid is successful. Southern Union has customers in Texas,
Missouri, Florida and Mexico.

Oneok, the corporate parent of Oklahoma Natural Gas Co., spent 14
months working on the merger agreement that was approved by the
Southwest Gas board of directors. That deal is still subject to approval
from state regulators, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and
Southwest Gas shareholders.

Southwest Gas said it would make no further public announcement
regarding its negotiations with Southern Union "until an agreement is
reached or negotiations are terminated."

Dominion Resources To Buy Gas Co.

Monday, 22 February 1999
R I C H M O N D , V A . (AP)

DOMINION RESOURCES Inc. will buy Consolidated Natural Gas in a $6.0
billion stock deal that will create a utility giant with nearly 4 million
customers and $8.8 billion in annual revenue.

The merger, announced Monday, will create the nation's fourth-largest gas
and electric utility and gives Dominion Resources the size to remain
competitive in an increasingly deregulated market.

Under the deal approved Sunday by both companies' boards of directors,
Dominion Resources would buy all shares of Pittsburgh-based CNG, one
of the nation's largest producers, transporters, distributors and retail
marketers of natural gas.

When the deal was announced, it was worth $6.3 billion. However,
investors sent both stocks falling. Consolidated closed down $1.06 1/4 to
$55.18 3/4, while Dominion Resources fell $2.25 to $40, both in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.

The move is strategically wise for Dominion Resources because it puts the
company further into oil and gas exploration and production, said Thomas
Hamlin, an analyst with First Union Capital in Richmond. It also gives
Richmond-based Dominion Resources more retail customers and puts the
company in more markets, Hamlin said.

"It's a very good move, a necessary move," Hamlin said.

Dominion has derived nearly all its earnings from its Virginia Power unit.

The merger also is consistent with Dominion Resources' goals and the
growing trend that unites electric generating companies with pipeline
companies, Hamlin said.

Pittsburgh-based CNG supplies natural gas to 1.9 million customers in
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia through its four distribution
companies: East Ohio Gas Co., People's Natural Gas Co., Hope Gas Co.
and Virginia Natural Gas. It also owns 7,600 miles of gas pipelines in New
York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland.

"It's a natural fit for our shareholders, customers and employees," said
George A. Davidson Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of CNG.
"It's also important to note that DRI and CNG have similar corporate
cultures, strategies and management styles."

The combined company will be named Dominion Resources and have its
headquarters in Richmond. Thomas E. Capps, Dominion Resources'
chairman, president and chief executive, will serve as president and chief
executive officer of the combined company. Davidson will serve as
chairman until his previously announced retirement in August 2000.

"It unites two of the most respected names in electricity and natural gas and
provides us the critical mass needed for today's dynamic energy sector,"
Capps said. "We are creating a formidable platform for growth in a region
that is home to 40 percent of the nation's demand for ener

1/3 to 1/2 what the funeral homes were charging. The funeral home operators on
the show more or less admitted that they were making thousands on the coffins,
but said they would have to charge more for the embalming, etc., to make up for
the loss of profit if they did not sell the coffin. But who is to say they will

If I were to guess at the brick and mortar and equipment value of these "homes"
I would guess at 500,000. If LWN paid a million plus for these facilities in

to do as well. And the customer is greiving over a loss. The bottom line is
that the customer is probably not going to comparison shop.

I came down very skeptical on SRV a few weeks ago and have done a lot of
homework since. Most of my previous concerns have been adequately explained.
The company's accounting is extremely difficult to understand and really throws
you off - it looks like no other business's accounting I have ever seen. But I
think its clean. That was my concern. Having satisfied myself that the
accounting is clean, the stock is a buy in my book at the current price.

Eric,

On Infinium and entire ERP sector in general. I think the fear is still growing
out there that business might go into the deep freeze until Y2K passes. This
IMO will limit the upside on alot of these for maybe another year, but I'm
willing to accumulate on weakness. I'm hoping to catch some of the larger
companies in a selloff should it occur.

From a quick look Infinium doesn't seem very differentiated from the pack. What
do you feel is their competitive advantage?

If you like these kinds of stocks, Datastream DSTM is another value IT stock
that has been mentioned on this thread that is caught up in the same psychology
negative psychology as the sector.
