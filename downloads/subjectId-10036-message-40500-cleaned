Hi CusterInvestor

Re: MHRpC

You had to buy today to get the $0.2135/monthly dividend. I loaded up yesterday
and may sell some shares in a few days at $25 just to scalp the dividend. You
should be able to sell all day at $24.99 if not at $25.00.

Watching the trading volume. they still have quite a few new shares yet to
sell. The company must be administering the sale of the new preferred shares
themselves and very well could have cut a special deal with their street
broker. It's a good deal for the buyer and the company if they can reduce the
transaction cost by 5% doing direct sales.

Acording to QuantemOnline ( http://www.quantumonline.com/search.cfm ) the MHRpC
have a rating of BB.

Moodys/S&P WR / BB 10/23/10.

Can you believe that MHRpC has a higher quality rating than Supervalue: CFR at
B1 and SVU Senior debt at B2.

>>>>"Costs incurred on uncompleted contracts, in excess of progress billings"
on balance sheet 4M - do you know what that is and why it went up from March
2010?

Here is the explanation of this from the 10-K. If you still have questions,
please ask. "Revenue and costs are recognized on the units of delivery method.
This method recognizes as revenue the contract price of units of the product
delivered during each period and the costs allocable to the delivered units as
the cost of earned revenue. When the sales agreements provide for separate
billing of engineering services, the revenues for those services are recognized
when the services are completed. Costs allocable to undelivered units are
reported in the balance sheet as costs incurred on uncompleted contracts.
Amounts in excess of agreed upon contract price for customer directed changes,
constructive changes, customer delays or other causes of additional contract
costs are recognized in contract value if it is probable that a claim for such
amounts will result in additional revenue and the amounts can be reasonably
estimated. Revisions in cost and profit estimates are reflected in the period
in which the facts requiring the revision become known and are estimable. The
unit of delivery method requires the existence of a contract to provide the
persuasive evidence of an arrangement and determinable seller’s price, delivery
of the product and reasonable collection prospects. The Company has written
agreements with the customers that specify contract prices and delivery terms.
The Company recognizes revenues only when the collection prospects are
reasonably assured."

This pretty much means that "Costs incurred on uncompleted contracts, in excess
of progress billings" is like inventory or AR and its expansion is not a
positive.

>>>>"Although we provide manufacturing services for large governmental
programs, we usually do not work directly for agencies of the United States
government. Rather, we perform our services for large governmental contractors
and large utility companies. However, our business is dependent in part on the
continuation of governmental programs which require the services we provide." -
how sure are they that these government programs will continue?

I'm not sure what this text is talking about. I'm not aware of governmental
programs that they are working on indirectly. Maybe this is legacy text
relating to past business. I'd have to dig in further to understand this.

I am pretty sure they are talking about BAE systems and the fact that BAE is
purchasing TPCS products for government funded programs. I did not look at what
exactly are BAE orders though.

Overall, though I pretty much stay at my previous conclusion: cheap with high
potential reward but also high risk. :)

I think work-in-progress inventory is probably the best comparison. The product
is being built to a customer order but contractually can't be billed yet. I
suspect that we will see that number drop back down in a quarter or two because
I think it might represent a part of a large project.

Hi Paul -

Re: RAM Energy Resources, Inc. (RAME)

Started an initial position in RAME. The company closed the sale of their North
Texas Barnett Shale and Boonsville properties to Milagro Producing, LLC for
$43.7 million in cash today.

According to their press release, the proceeds of the sale to be used as
follows:
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/RAM-Energy-Resources-bw-526625509.html?x=0&.v=1
"...Use of Proceeds

Proceeds of $16.0 million will be applied to reduce the outstanding balance on
RAM’s revolving credit facility which stood at $133.5 million as of September
30, 2010. The remaining net proceeds will be applied to reduce the outstanding
balance on the company’s Term loan which was $113.3 million at September 30,
2010...."

=================================================================

Based on their land holdings and proven reserves, the stock s/b valued between
$3.50/share - $4.00/share. The sale leaves them with more oil production
capacity and sufficient cash (from their revolving credit facility) to focus on
new well development in their South Texas parcel(s). $20 million is budgeted
for well development in 2011.

http://ramenergy.triadcentral.com/index.cfm?id=21

Don't know if you closed your position but RAME's prospects look good
especially with crude selling in the $80.00/barrel range.

Value in Oil and Gas E&Ps - Josh Young
http://seekingalpha.com/article/237163-value-in-oil-and-gas-e-ps-josh-young?sou
ce=yahoo

"...RAME has a number of more mature oil assets, primarily in Texas and
Oklahoma. They also have an oil field that they recently did some exploration
work on and achieved some really positive results. Their stock is attractive
because it is trading at a large discount to its proven reserve value, at a low
cash flow multiple, while benefiting substantially from the above $80 price of
oil. RAME's enterprise value/BOE is effectively ~$11/BOE, or $11 per barrel
equivalent of energy in its proved reserves, which is substantially lower than
the going rate for other oil stocks and in the asset market.

On the surface, RAM appears to be overleveraged, but it recently did an asset
sale for more than $40 million. The asset they sold appears to have been one of
the company's weakest assets. It was a high-percentage natural gas field that
was providing a relatively small amount of cash flow to its value. Even though
RAM announced positive exploration results on a trend where SandRidge Energy,
Inc. (SD) and Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) have been very successful in a
couple of counties west in Oklahoma, RAM's stock has not received much credit
for the substantially improved liquidity position nor the recent exploration
success. And given that the majority of RAM's reserves are in oil, the company
continues to trade at a substantial discount to its proven reserve value, which
was calculated at a lower oil price. So, there's even more value there that
should be recognized in the market at some point..."

treacherous especially if you do not have deep pocket. to recount my experience
which many here have heard in the past. in 2000 i bought an ipo called icge at
15 or so. with a couple of months it reached 80 and i was convinced it was
massively overvalued and sold my entire position and thought about possibly
buying puts on it down the road. six months later it hit a high of $320 or so.
when it dropped back to $240 i thought about buying puts but for the amount of
money i wanted to risk it would have had to drop 50% more for me to make money
so i didnt do it. eventually the stock dropped well below $1!

another problem are facing shorts is the greater fool theory. the classic
example of that being time warner's foolish purchase of aol, which probably
destroyed many smart shorts.

The moral is shorts can be great but you have to have staying power and be
willing to suffer a better than 100% losing position before you may be proved
right.
I agree that nflx is way over priced but i also believe it could be acquired by
a greater fool as well.

LPHI - I agree with your observations regarding regulatory risk and P/book. I
also don't see any moat, except perhaps long experience in business +
reputation (if it's positive). I don't see why insurance companies would not
get into this business if it's so lucrative. Perhaps conflict of interest or
unwillingness to appear shady?

The company seems to be cheap in terms of E/EV, however the earnings have been
on an upswing for last 2 years, so I wonder if this is sustainable. Especially
since the revenues have not grown. I am afraid that this may be volatile
business and if there's sparsity of policies to be bought cheap or competition
develops, the earnings can dive down really fast.

Regarding business, selling the policy for partial sum instead of letting it
lapse and getting nothing might be positive (

Have you written calls on your position here? The Jan '11 Calls at $9 seem to
offer a decent premium to continue to write monthly calls against, but it's not

write calls further out and reduce your basis by 20%+. Decisions, decisions...

Hi cwillyg -

I currently do not have any covered calls on SVU and probably will not initiate
any position any time soon. I believe the company is undervalued by at least
35% and it's quite possible to see a private buy out (for all or part of the
company) w/i the next six months if the company remains at the current price
level.

That's based on a $12.00/share take out offer at the minimum. Therefore, I
would not consider doing any covered calls unless the stock trades at or near
$12.00/share.

One can also make an argument that the stock could be valued at a $17.00/share
price (or higher) when looking at Price/Sales, PE and/or considering the
possible value in their company owned real estate. I probably will just hold
and collect the dividend now yielding 4%.

If I were to establish a covered call position I would write an option out so
that I captured the next dividend (ex dividend Nov 29...next dividend around
March 1) so I would sell the March or April 2011 calls.

It appears that a lot of the option activity are for the out of the money calls
near $12.00/share.

I think that management will eventually do something to pay down their huge
debt like selling off more stores & company owned real estate. Maybe a
"packaged" private sale made up of stores in a particular region w/ the
distribution & warehouse arm remaining as a separate division. I am not so sure
that the pieces are worth more than the total but there is definitely value in
their assets (especially their real estate).

I am not too sure that any type of refinancing will help the company as they
are pretty much already levered way too high especially if sales turn down.

This is one that you hold and wait for investors to recognize the hidden value
in the company. With all the cheap money floating around (ie QE1 & QE2), there
is no better time to take this company private.

I kept researching today and the fact is that this is not an insurance company
and it doesn't have the risk of an insurance company.
And talking about the book value of an insurance company is very difficult IMO
because we don't know the risks they have taken (example: AIG) unless we are
very well informed insiders.
So why would this be a shady business. It has been done for 100 years.
Practically I don't see any risk for losses unless they run out of customers. I
don't see that happening. Obviously they have a good network and reputation
among the customers and the sellers.

Wikipedia
Life Settlement providers must be licensed in the state where the policy owner
resides. Approximately 41 states have regulations in place regarding the sale
of life insurance policies to third parties.

This is from the annual report and wikipedia:

"We act as a purchasing agent for life settlement purchasers. In performing
these services, we identify, qualify and purchase policies on behalf of our
clients that match their buying parameters and return expectations. Because we
are obliged to work within these parameters, we must make offers that are
competitive from the seller’s point of view, but still fit within the buying
parameters of our clients."

The Policy as Transferable Property

Wikipedia

The Supreme Court case of Grigsby v. Russell (1911) established the
policyowner’s right to transfer an insurance policy. Justice Oliver Wendell
Holmes noted in his opinion that life insurance possessed all the ordinary
characteristics of property, and therefore represented an asset that a
policyowner could transfer without limitation. Wrote Holmes, “Life insurance
has become in our days one of the best recognized forms of investment and
self-compelled saving.” This opinion placed the ownership rights in a life
insurance policy on the same legal footing as more traditional investment
property such as stocks and bonds. As with these other types of property, a
life insurance policy could be transferred to another person at the discretion
of the policyowner.

This decision established a life insurance policy as transferable property that
contains specific legal rights, including the right to:

* Name the policy beneficiary
* Change the beneficiary designation (unless subject to restrictions)
* Assign the policy as collateral for a loan
* Borrow against the policy
* Sell the policy to another party

A second milestone occurred in 2001 when The National Association of Insurance
Commissioners (NAIC) took a crucial step by releasing the Viatical Settlements
Model Act defining guidelines for avoiding fraud and ensuring sound business
practices. Around this time, many of the life settlement providers that are
prominent today began purchasing policies for their investment portfolio using
institutional capital. The arrival of well-funded corporate entities
transformed the settlement concept into a regulated wealth management tool for
high-net-worth policyowners who no longer needed a given policy. Strong demand
for life settlements policies is driving a rapid market expansion that
continues today.

From:gcrispin
From Morningstar:

Life Partners Holdings facilitates life settlement transactions by matching
potential buyers of life insurance policies with sellers. The market for life
settlement is still in relative infancy, which has allowed Life Partners to
achieve rapid growth as it penetrates a market that was almost nonexistent a
few years ago. The industry remains relatively small and lacks developed
competition, allowing Life Partners to generate strong margins and high
returns. We don't believe the company has an economic moat to protect these
returns, however. As the industry matures, revenue growth and margins will
contract. Additionally, we have concerns about Life Partners' history of legal
entanglements with state governments and some of its accounting and disclosure
practices.

Every year, millions of elderly Americans voluntarily allow their life
insurance policies to lapse because it no longer makes economic sense to pay
high premiums to maintain a policy they do not need or they simply can't afford
their premiums. Rather than letting their policies lapse, some policyholders
have begun to consider life settlements. Companies like Life Partners step in
to broker a sale from the owner of the life insurance policy to a buyer who is
interested in purchasing the policy as an investment. This transaction is
attractive to both parties, as the seller collects a payment in excess of the
cash surrender value for his or her previously illiquid life insurance policy
while the buyer acquires the policy at a discount to face value, providing a
potential return uncorrelated with traditional markets.

If the industry becomes more accepted and mainstream, we think there will be a
natural pressure on the fees Life Partners is able to charge buyers and the
margins it will be able to generate. Potential competitors have largely
overlooked life settlements because of the relatively small size of the market.
While so far the life insurance companies have generally turned a blind eye to
life settlements, they have financial incentive to diminish or eliminate their
use. Life insurers assume a certain level of lapse rates in their insurance
pricing calculations. If lapse rates fall from increasing use of life
settlements, life insurance companies will have incentive to begin buying back
the policies themselves. What's more, in contrast to Life Partners, which must
pay intermediaries to find potential sellers, life insurance companies already
have existing relationships with policyholders, allowing them more financial
leeway to bid up prices over life settlement companies. Also, large financial
institutions have been considering securitization of life settlements or
creating an exchange for their transactions. Either of these events could
greatly increase competition in the industry and lower Life Partners' returns.

As it stands now, the life settlement industry is relatively opaque. It is not
clear whether competitors are actively bidding on the same policies Life
Partners is or whether each policy is sold to the first bidder. Life Partners
does disclose the fees it collects on each transaction to the buyers of
policies. Life Partners' fees seem to be high relative to the face value of the
policy and even higher relative to the discounted value at which the policies
are purchased. Over the past three fiscal years, the firm has collected gross
revenue (before payments to brokers and licensees) representing about 17% of
the face value of policies, and this number is even higher in recent quarters.
As the industry becomes more competitive, we expect those fees to decline.

In the past few years there have been disagreements between Life Partners and a
number of states regarding whether life settlements should be treated as
financial securities. While the settlements are not treated as securities under
federal law, some states have sued Life Partners on the basis that the
transactions were securities based on state law. Florida and Colorado have both
ruled against Life Partners in this regard, and the company does not currently
facilitate any transactions in these states. As a condition of its settlement
with the state of Colorado, Life Partners agreed to offer to repurchase all of
the settlements it had issued in the state at a premium to what the buyers had
originally paid. When Life Partners bought the policies back, it did not

settlements the firm holds on its balance sheet matches the economic value of
the policies. Given that the company now holds more than $18 million worth of
policies on its balance sheet, a change in the accounting rules could have a
material impact on its earnings.

re LPHI - this is straight from LPHI website. if this does not sound like
something that needs regulation, I don't know what does. If they ever get a
newblip that claims they rip of old ladies having Alzheimers, the stock is
going to drop 30% in one day. In addition, I read they extend boundaries by
going mainstream while maintaining quality (whatever hat means).

http://www.lphi.com/LifeSettlements.htm

A life settlement is simply the sale of an existing life insurance policy by a
terminally ill or elderly person to another party. The price of the policy is
negotiated and sold by the owner at a discount to the face amount. The
purchaser then collects the full amount paid out under the policy.

Life settlements are attractive to policyholders because they provide a
secondary market for life insurance policies that are no longer needed or
wanted. Investors are attracted to life settlements because they offer the
opportunity for potentially high returns that are not tied to stock or bond
markets, interest rates, or business cycles.

Re: SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU) - Outstanding Debt analysis

The site below provides a listing of all the outstanding debit for SVU. There
are 27 issues that have maturities that range from 2011 through 2031. I was
surprised to see the total debt outstanding was now at $4.625 Billion. Yahoo
Finance lists the debt at 7.45B which may also include other revolving line(s)
of credit. They do not have any preferred shares outstanding as this was called
in 2006.

http://cxa.marketwatch.com/finra/BondCenter/SearchResult.aspx?q=SVU .

The coupon amounts on their outstanding bonds range from 6.1%-8.7% with the
average rate at 7.0%. The maturities come due over these segmented time
periods:

2011-2014 $1.730 Billion
2015 - nothing
2016-2017 $1.04 Billion
2018-2029 $1.23 Billion
2030-2031 $0.625 Billion

Therefore, the company might be able to refinance some or all of this debt
pushing out their average maturity to 10 years. Their largest payment of $1.0
Billion comes due in 2016.

They may be able to reduce their average interest rate by 100 basis points
providing a savings in annual interest expense of $46 million/year or about
$0.22/share. This represents a 15% addition to the average analysts earnings
estimate of $1.50/year for 2012.

In previous conference calls, the company said that provision has already been
made for the debt coming due; the $700M in 2011, $300M in 2012, $200M in 2013,
and $490M in 2014 and are less than what they already paid in 2010. Their peak
cash flow hit due to their structured debt service s/b falling. If their sales
slow down has also peaked this quarter, the company should be well positioned
to generate increasing quarterly cash flows again.

As these earlier maturities get paid off, the rating agencies should (at some
time) be upgrading their opinion on the remaining outstanding debt (s/b just
over $3 Billion by 2015).

This is a good combination to increase stock holder's equity and the stock
price: (1) reduced total debt w/ lower annual interest expense, (2) higher
quarterly cash flows from day-to-day operations and (3) stabilized sales w/
steady margins at 3.10% one of the highest in the sector.

Maybe SVU has reached bottom and the future prospects are only going to get
better especially if there is a path to get their LT debt down to $3 Billion by
year end 2015.

Hi richardred -

Thank's for the heads up. Perhaps something can be learned from their
bankruptcy.

A&P, Grocery Store Owner, Files for Bankruptcy in N.Y. (Update2)
http://noir.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=amWYRtUPmaSk

From the article:"...The company has 41,000 employees, 95 percent of whom are
covered by union agreements, according to the filing....".

<clip>

"...According to its most recent quarterly report, A&P had a net loss of $153.7
million for the 12 weeks ended Sept. 11. Its total assets were $2.53 billion
and liabilities were $3.21 billion.

Meeting liquidity needs considering debt of $165 million was coming due June
15, 2011, was a reason for its initial move to restructure out of court, the
company said in regulatory filings.

The company’s labor costs mean the company has less flexibility to invest in
other parts of the store, Hertel said in an interview...."

==================================================================

It looks like the bankruptcy will help management establish more flexible
union/non-union labor agreement(s).

The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc. (GAJ) represents the stock
exchange listing for their debit at $25.00/share par.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GAJ

This is now trading at 24 cents on the dollar ($6.00/share) but was as high as
60 cents on the dollar ($15.00/share) before the BK news on Friday.

It's interesting to note that its biggest stockholders are activist investor
Ron Burkle and the German retail group Tengelmann. Burkle's Yucaipa investment
firm has built up a large position in the company's debt. I suspect that there
will be a lot of shares traded on GAJ Monday and it would not surprise me that
it is Burkle and his investment group doing the buying.

I sold TXIC partly as it ran up from the firesale price I bought at couple days

WAMPQ - what a day can do to investment returns. I looked through all the data

So I held and finally got out at $21. Lesson 1: don't invest expecting

Hi Masharry -

You mentioned that you are going to keep an eye on rising interest rates as an
indicator for peeling off shares of silver & gold stocks. I noticed that my
GNMA Fund (VFIJX) has been falling in price (anticipating higher mortgage
rates). Previously it was trading at an all time high around $11.17/share. Now
it is around $10.93/share (all w/i the last 10 days). It was trading around
$9.75/share in 2006 when LT rates were at their high for the cycle (about
7.5%).

Do you take the proceeds and build up a position in money funds that benefit
from rising rates?

My credit union lowered their annual rate to 0.95%/year last month.

I am thinking that it may be better to try to find undervalued equities that
own hard assets and pay an increasing dividend. By the time rates get rolling
higher, it's going to be too late to make the moves.

Perhaps the other option is to build up positions in China and/or Brazil where
you can benefit from their double digit GDP growth.

Re: GMXR - Shorts HTB stock

Not too sure but according to Schwab it is listed as a HTB stock. It could be
that at one time some large hedge funds were in the stock and there was forced
liquidation(s) that drove the stock down. Also, their production is largely NG
and with such low prices, investors saw a good short opportunity. Now, NG
prices are higher and shorts are covering.

I posted this earlier but the long term prospectus look good to me.

From Josh Young Finds Value in Oil and Gas E&Ps article (11/16/2010)
http://oakshirefinancial.com/2010/11/16/josh-young-finds-value-in-oil-and-gas-e
s/

"...GMX is interesting to me because it has a tremendous amount of proven
natural gas reserves on its books and is in the process of reducing the cost of
adding additional reserves. Relative to the company’s enterprise value, you pay
less than $1 per 1,000 cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves. A large
portion of those proven reserves are developed and producing. The company is
profitable right now—primarily because of its hedges—but it is profitable.

GMX has done a couple of things that have substantially increased the company’s
value and the value of its assets. First, it has significantly increased the
amount of reserves it accesses with its Haynesville well. At some point a
couple of years ago, GMX was booking 3–4 billion cubic feet (bcf) of reserves
per well. Now it’s up to somewhere around 6–6.5 bcf per well in reserves, with
associated higher production. Based on the type of improvements the company is
achieving, it could get reserves as high as 7–8 bcf per well, comparable to
some other places in the Haynesville historically considered more “core” than
GMX’s area. These are $9 million wells, so GMX’s finding costs are pretty low.
It’s not the lowest-cost producer, but the company has definitely improved its
cost structure. That’s one really big positive.

Another big positive is that it did a deal with Kinder Morgan Energy Partners,
L.P. (NYSE:KMP), one of the big pipeline companies. GMX sold a minority
interest in its gathering system in East Texas for more than $40 million. I
think it was a 40% stake or somewhere in that range. GMX still has the majority
ownership in that system. Valuations on mainstream and gathering assets have
gone up a lot since that transaction. So GMX has what’s probably a $60–$70
million asset that no one seems to be giving them credit for. The company’s
valuation is very low because people are worried it will outspend its cash
flow. Yet, it has this asset that it will be able to sell to fund its
development, increasing expected future reserves and cash flow. When GMX sells
that gathering asset, it’s really going to unlock value there. It will
highlight how discounted the stock is relative to its fundamental value. And
this is the kind of discount I look for and the kind of misunderstanding I take
advantage of for my fund...."

What I wonder about FRA and VVR (less FRB) and FLC/FFC mentioned on Dale's

for the fund go up faster than the rates of securities in it? Maybe that's not
true for floating rate funds? Maybe it depends how steep is the yield curve?

I still hate the fees in these funds. FRA is cheapest at 1.22%, but even with
that you lose ~20% of the yield to fees. It seems all these funds are cap gain
trading vehicles and not really yield vehicles. If you don't get cap gains,

"INTC and WDC are not my type of companies (low ROE)."

WDC is really not _that_ low for ROE, but... I've come to use a suite of
"return on" calcs including total capital, Greenblatt's version of the calc,
and a few marginal calcs for return on marginal capital. WDC is really pretty
decent there from what I see, but it doesn't have much moat/barrier to entry
other than it's one of the last standing (albeit in shifting industry that
requires constant execution).

INTC doesn't look as strong from return standpoint, but I give leeway to
gorillas and it does look better using Greenblatt's return on tangible capital
measure. The Magic Formula approach is the first time I really started liking
INTC, and the market position gives them a few extra points in my book, but
valuation is huge part of my interest. I'd love to see INTC improve in ROE and
some of the marginal capital measures, but I think that may be why they're
trading at 11.5 multiple right now.

RE: AFAM/LHCG. Yeah, I can understand staying away. It's hard to know what the
bottom is on these, but I'm guessing in the end home health is a much cheaper
solution than alternatives, and these stocks have already been beaten down
pretty badly. Bottom could be lower but I'm in here. FWIW it seems like AFAM
"wants" to go up more than LHCG. I've read some things indicating that AFAM was
billing more conservatively than AMED which seems focus of investigation.

Again, all of these are likely trades for me and I'll look to rotate out to
other positions when price is right. I've been in several of these for a while
- particularly MSFT which is my largest holding. I thought it'd be to 30 by now

Hi Paul - it's been a long time ...,

I'm probably taking liberties, but my reading of Greenblatt didn't necessarily
seem to preclude shorter holding periods. I've seen studies showing good
results with shorter term rebalancing also using Magic Formula approach (1
month) - although I've tried trading on 1 month windows and it's a bit much I
think. There's not enough "better" new ideas that come up in such short term
time frames. 2-3 months seem to be a timeframe that creates enough new
opportunities to me.

I came to 2-3 month holding periods recently after several trades over the
summer trading moves in stocks like KMB, JNJ, WMT, PEP, MSFT and few others -
just moving capital from one to another based on price action. The big blue
chips just seemed so cheap to me, but at the same time I realized they hadn't
gone anywhere in 10 yrs so I didn't want to commit long term. Trading the
rolling waves in price action and picking up dividends here and there seemed to
make sense to me in that environment. (For example ABT is looking to shape up
for a short term trade right now following that same approach - I probably
should pull the trigger on it. CHL is one I just entered for similar
reasoning). To a degree MSFT and INTC are in that same boat, although more PE
expansion makes sense to me with limited downside in both of the latter.

Yes, my personal opinion is you are taking liberties if you are posting trading
ideas.

My understanding of the Greenblatt procedure is that you buy with the idea of
holding for one year and then rebalancing after a year. That's too short a time
frame imo for value stocks to allow for value stocks to work out. Argument
could be made that maybe Greenblatt's methods are only for a subset of value
stocks (essentially high roe and low p/e), or that they aren't necessarily
value stocks at all, or that he is culling losers (non-performers) from
winners.

I assume that under Greenblatt's rules, if a stock works out (rises enough,
maybe enough so as not to qualify any longer as a MagicFormula pick), then you
go ahead and sell it. Whether it happens one day or 364 days into the holding.
A person doesn't go in though with the intent to sell after 2-3 months with his
method, as I understand it.

Well, it's all on a scale, and we have different ways of describing where we
are vs. where others are. There was a guy here a few years back who believed if
you go into a buy and have any intent to sell the stock -- two months out, two
years out, ten years out - you were in his view not an investor but rather a
timer. That seems extreme to me. On the other end of the scale, to say somebody
makes a value buy with the intent to sell within a few months and where's
there's no corporate business news a priori to justify that, to me two months
is just too soon. Although in this market which has been in an uptrend the past
several months and may correct at any time - maybe especially so after the end
of year - then I certainly can see somebody going for a two-three month hold.
To my knowledge and weak memory though, no professional value investor calls
that value investing however. And since I go with it's not value investing, and
this is a value thread, then yeah, it's taking liberties. Again, jmo.

Keep posting though, because people who remember you do like and/or respect
your ideas. And as thread moderator I don't see where your posts are
distracting anybody. Your posts may be very helpful to us.

It's been a while since I've done a lot of DD on this asset class.
As I understand these products, most invest in senior loans of a very short
maturity. Thus, the risk implied in leverage is lessened, as the portfolio
resets frequently at prevailing interest rates.
Another poster mentioned company specific risk, and examining credit quality.
Each fund is diversified, which mitigates risk to some degree. As these loans
are "senior", they stand at or near the front of the line in the event a
company were to have financial duress.

This is an incorrect assumption. If you follow his method you hold the stocks
for one year (exactly long enough to qualify for long term capital gains tax
treatment). This is regardless of valuation. One important principle behind the
magic formula method is that you don't make decisions. You treat them as a
basket, knowing that some will work out well, some will work out poorly, but on
average over time they will work out better than the market.

Of course, there's nothing to prevent anyone from taking the MF list as a
starting point and doing anything they want. For those who know what they're
doing that may even be a good idea. But if you're not buying the basket and
holding them all for a year regardless of subsequent developments, you're not
following Greenblatt's method.

looks like gfre was the victim of some scam by short sellers. It really would
be nice if the SEC would start doing their jobs and investigate this type of
criminal activity. investors who were scammed into selling their shares should
contact them and complain. here is GFRE's response:

i believe we heard the same arguments with respect to mortgage backed
securities too. at least the senior debt and diversification part. the most
important part to me would be that the originator has some skin in the game and
is not just a servicer of the loans.

Madharry,

How unnecessary these writings will be if only they employ a reputable auditor.
Why are they not doing that? As far as the short sellers go. If they can scare
me out of a stock then I shouldn't be investing in this stock. And if I run
then it is entirely my fault. Isn't there a rule that you can sell short only
at an "Up Tick". I don't know if this rule applies, but if it does, short
sellers could not have done what happened with GFRE. I still have SLW, thanks
to you, since 24$. It is getting close to Netflix' PE. But at least every share
is backed by 5 ounces of silver.

Good Investing and thanks for the bright ideas.

WDC - you put it very nicely: "it doesn't have much moat/barrier to entry other
than it's one of the last standing (albeit in shifting industry that requires
constant execution)."

INTC - I agree, it's one of the truer Gorillas although AMD clouds the issue.
;) I still wonder why ROE is so lowish for a Gorilla. Maybe it's the issue of
capital requirements to build the fabs, but then I look at TSM which is a
generic foundry and they have higher ROE and higher margins than Gorilla
INTC... Weird. But sure INTC still has a lot of moat with some fraying at the
sides (AMD + ARM for things mobile).

No difference. That's the holding period they based their research on, so
that's the one that they recommend. Of course anyone is free to do what they
want re holding periods, or anything else, but they're on their own. If you
follow the MF method as put forth by Greenblatt, you adjust at one year
intervals.

your welcome. i think that rule is long gone. there are a lot of factors that
go into choice of auditor, including price and loyalty. I dont put that much
stock into auditors as even the best get defrauded and screw investors. for
example in the enron case many more people should have ended up in jail than
actually went. the auditors and the banks helped to defraud numerous investors
and employees who invested in the companies. you cant trust anyone. I have been
burned plenty of times and usually there were warning signals that i didnt pay
enough attention to.

It is not the auditor's job to detect fraud. That is a common misconception
held by many investors.

The financial statement audits done by external auditors are not designed to
detect fraud, plain and simple. Audits of financial statements really do two
things, when you break them down to the most basic objectives: (1) they double
check the math to see whether everything has been added and subtracted
correctly; and (2) they make sure that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP) have been correctly applied. That may not sound like much, but that is
what audits are. Audits were never designed to detect fraud.

http://www.expertfraud.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=13&Item
d=15

The Enron case was unique in that the base for the fraud was reported in their
financial statements - as a small footnote. The real error in that audit is
that it was a "material" amount and thus should have been more prominently
reported.

WATG. I'll chance that one as well for a few shares. Looks like p/e is
relatively high for a Chinese small-cap at 7+. Otoh, it seems be a real company
with products (like airbags) that can be confirmed to be sold to companies
outside China. In scanning, I see auditor is Pricewaterhouse. Regarding this
auditor, I at least know their name, not that I can assume they protect anyone
from fraudulent accounting.

Nov 9:
"The Company raises guidance for full year 2010 sales revenue to $307 million
from $300 million, as well as the guidance for full year 2010 net income to
$37.5 million from $36 million, excluding the share-based compensation."

33.8 million shares outstanding. Eh, roughly then 37.5/33.8 = $1.10/sh for 2010
earnings

"Nov. 23, 2010 /PRNewswire-Asia-FirstCall/ -- On November 23, 2010, Wonder Auto
Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: WATG, "Wonder Auto") announced that management
estimates that its revenue for 2011 will be about $445 - $455 million."

So very very roughly, MAYBE and IF revenue estimates are achieved, maybe I can
ratio 445M/307M to get 1.45x$1.10/sh to get $1.60 per share earnings in 2011.
On a stock like Wonder Auto which trades now at $8.09, that possible p/e of 5
looks attractive to me.
