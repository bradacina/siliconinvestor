total worst case scenario would be 300K of stock put to me, but the worst I
have dealt with this year is 3 stocks put to me at once; one of which was WAG
at $32 which I sold in a few weeks at 36.07 after the ESRX announcement which
was only a matter of when not if, one was WLT which I sold last week when it
bounced, and one was NKE which I sold at $96.77, down .36%, but I turned around
and sold the NKE Sept. 85's, so I will be ahead on that stock unless the market
caves in. Again, owning NKE at $85 will not be a disaster for me.

I sold the JCP $20 puts last Thursday, got a little nervous when I saw it trade
pre-market, but counted on some good short covering, and made a decent profit
overnight.

Knowing I have the vast majority of my portfolio creating an ever growing
income stream is comforting, and allows me to feed my old trader mentality
through options on stocks that would make sense to hold for a while if
necessary, but the main point is to bank the premium from the options, not own
the stock.

Great post Paul.

Most of the people using options think that they get good/better returns. I
wonder if many (any) of them do. And I am talking about time periods longer
than 1-2 years.

Options magnify the problem that already exists in short term trading. You have
to make decisions all the time. Buy/sell/hold every fricking day cause the time
is ticking. So even if you are good at it, you have a full time job. The beauty
of Buffett-style investing is that you can buy for forever. And then go on
vacation to France while your portfolio is growing. Even if you need to review
it, it can be done once a year or whatever.

No, I am not there yet. I still spend too much time looking at stocks and
deciding whether to buy or sell. But I try to keep in mind that long-term
holdings are great. I don't do options. Tried it and I know it's not for me.

And BTW the lost decade made people forget the value of compounding. In 2000,
there were tons of people who made good money on long-term holds and
compounding. In 2010 - not many. We'll see if wheel turns again or the new
normal is no growth and no compounding to speak of.

Hi Paul,

As one of the "guilty parties" moving mostly to options, I would say the
following. There is far too much irrationality in the marketplace, IMHO. Or at
least too much knowledge that is not shared with the general public,
particularly if I want to pick individual stocks. What I have learned about
efficient market theory and dividend discount models - throw them out the
window as far as I am concerned.

Examples, why does HSY have a 24 PE but XOM only around ~10. How can AMZN, with
2012 sales estimated at over $60 billion, trade at a PE of ~100 on projected
FY13 earnings. How does GRPN fall from 13 to ~5.50 in one quarter, even though
they met their guidance. How does FOSL lower annual guidance, but go up 30%.

In a sense, by selling puts, I am value investing. Upside is limited (to
premium received), but I'm being paid to essentially place a limit order. If I
think ZNGA, for example, would be a good value at 2 (and considering they have
about $2 cash per share on balance sheet, it should be), and the market is
willing to pay me 16 cents for a January 2013 put, that's 8% return in ~5
months if ZNGA doesn't fall under 2. Or if I think KOG is a good value at
today's price (~8.80), and the market is willing to pay me 95 cents for a Dec.
2012 $8 put, that's either about a 12% return in 4 months if the put expires
worthless or I'd basically be buying the stock at 7.05 (a 20% discount to
today's price). In an ideal world, I would hope all my put selections would
expire worthless. But even on an unlevered portfolio, you could possibly obtain
close to 20% or even greater annual returns without having any of your stock
choices increase in value - and in many cases, even have some fairly
significant downside protection.

As long as option premiums remain robust and I can continue to find attractive
positions, that seems like a fairly attractive investing approach to me, and
one I am pursuing in taxable trading accounts where I can sell naked puts. And
why I and others have increased the level of discussion regarding.

But I am being fairly conservative (high cash levels) in other accounts, and
may begin to pare back on number of put positions as election approaches
(knowing that fiscal cliff possibly would soon follow depending on outcome).

OT to a great value investing thread.
A couple of observations on options...

>there is far too much irrationality in the marketplace,
irrationality can be taken advantage in other ways than options.

>Most of the people using options think that they get good/better returns.
but options are a zero sum game. the clown on the other end of the trade has
the same opinion. if Clown A get better returns it is at the expense of Clown
B.

>they've switched to buying options or long-dated leaps where they feel risk is
less (because less dollars are committed)
maybe. Still, Clown A is trying to beat Clown B. Clown B probably has more
information and money, and the trade is part of a mathematical routine.

>if I think KOG is a good value at today's price (~8.80), and the market is
willing to pay me 95 cents for a Dec. 2012 $8 put, that's either about a 12%
return in 4 months if the put expires worthless or I'd basically be buying the
stock at 7.05 (a 20% discount to today's price).

This is faulty thinking in my book. You are selling insurance. If there is no
crash you win and keep the premium. If there is a crash you buy the car at a
discount to today's value, but you still own a car that has been in a wreck.
You cannot justify it by saying that you bought the car at a discount to
today's value so you win both ways. (I think that put sellers have the opinion
that if a stock is put to them, that it is just a matter of time until the
price recovers to their cost and they can unload it. If they can just wait it
out...) And of course, you do not notice your loss when a stock zooms, because
you made a free premium. If you get a 12% return in 4 months, it might be
because the market is irrational, or maybe you are selling car insurance to a
12 year old driver. Looking at KOG for 15 seconds -- insiders are selling and
their earnings estimates are dropping. I have no idea what the company does,
but I do not want to own even at a 20% discount to today's price.

A non-financial friend of mine attended a rip-off seminar where they explained
how to make money selling puts. He thought he couldn't lose. Free money. It
wasn't a market crash that nailed him, just bad luck of selling insurance on
too many cars that got in wrecks. And put sellers have that bad luck risk in
addition to an earthquake event that damages all cars.

I am obviously biased, but this is like politics -- you will only hear what you
already believe.

The worse thing that can happen to you when you enter a casino for the first
time is to win some money. While we are on the subject here's a good joke --
the gambler's prayer.... when a real gambler enters a casino he always says
this prayer -- "oh lord, please let me break even today. (pause) because i need
the money."

Armanino Foods of Distinction Inc. (AMNF) - Reducing position as stock hits new
all time highs

Peeled off a few more shares @ $0.90. Their full financials are now posted on
their Web site.

<u>Results of Operations: </u>
<blockquote>Net sales for the quarter ending June 30, 2012 has increased by 13%
to $7,097,885 from $6,290,645 in the same quarter last year. On a year to date
basis, net sales increased by $1,626,384, or by 13%, from $12,155,115 on June
30, 2011, to $13,781,499 this year. These increases reflect higher demand in
the Company’s core products, an increase in its customer base, and higher
international sales.</blockquote> What has impressed me is they are now
obtaining 17% of their sales in Asia.
<blockquote>During the three months ending June 30, 2012 and 2011 Asian sales
amounted to 17% and 11% of the Company’s total gross sales, respectively. For
the six months ended Sales into Asia represented 15% and 9%. </blockquote>
That's a pretty good growth market for them.

AMNF is my smallest CAP stock but still holds a position in the top quartile in
the portfolio (23rd out of 80).
Forward PE around 10. Dividend now 4% w/ potential of special dividend too.

Re: GOV

http://goo.gl/KrNcC

You make a very good point about the management (and their fees) for GOV but my
premise for buying at current levels (and below $21.00/share) is because they
are buying properties at bargain prices. If you look at the 10 - 20 year real
estate cycle, their is no doubt we are near the lows. In fact they just picked
up a building located in Stockton CA (the city recently declared bankruptcy) :
<blockquote>In July, we acquired a previously disclosed office property and
stocked in Stockton, California with 22,000 square feet. The property is 100%
leased to the U.S. government and occupied by the Department of Immigration and
customs enforcement. For remaining lease term 14.7 years, the purchase price
was $8.3 million and the acquisition cap rate was 8.8%.</blockquote> In their
most recent conference call they described a total of $250M of acquisitions
since April 2012. That represents almost 16% of their $1.48B Enterprise value.
Most of these recent buys include leases that continue for 4 years or more.
Their Stockton property is leased not by the bankrupt City but by the <span

WILC. So far it seems the negativity expressed here last couple of quarters ago
about this Israeli food company has been correct. It's now another quarter of
poor WILC company performance. With no end in sight. Maybe worse, as I read the
q issued now. I bought in part because I have hoped for a turnaround in the
business -- at least the company being able to increase its food prices to
customers to keep up with its increasing costs. That isn't happening.

I believe I'll hold a little longer.
Cash + securities = US $51M. Net current assets = $78.4M - $8M (which is
current and long-term lia) = $70.4M. 12.97M sh. issued and outstanding. (down
apparently from 13.6M in '11; so maybe there has been a share buyback) . So nca
= 70.4/13 = $5.42. Dr Graham might have said, it's a buy at 2/3, ie. $3.61.
Stock's now at $4.11.

WILC,

Not happy with recent results, but these were foreshadowed in prior earning
calls. There was a buyback last year, but they put it on hold. However, the
holding company Willifood Investments has been buying shares (+133,464 to
7,305,201 shares as of 4/1/2012) and in the call they said WILC might renew the
buyback once the parent company buyback is completed (the audio got kind of
garbled).

I recommend you also look at the recent proxy. They are considering a related
party sale agreement between and affiliate Willi Food. Not being in the grocery
store business, I don't know whether the agreement is fair.

Given the cash and net assets and management/affiliate buying of shares, I am
inclined to hold a small position for the long term. I think the stock could
rebound quite well with an improvement in business conditions or a good
acquisition, but neither of those seem imminent. Thus, it seems like a tracking
position makes the most sense at this juncture.

look at 3 year avg of earnings for xom since its a commodity its trading closer
to 15x.

Yes, but the other side of put selling is that you can pick a price that will
turn an ordinary stock into a value investment if it drops to your price,
otherwise you are adding "value" to your portfolio by adding your premium to be
able to buy another value investment down the road.

Different strokes as they say, but it can all add up to value investing in an

i don't have a strong opinion on gold stocks right now. GLD itself seems tired
and I wonder why the stocks would go up now with GLD stagnating and cost rising
faster then revenues.

Do want to bounce off a few ideas:

Short: defense companies like LMT and NOC. Catalyst: fiscal cliff talk, pension
gap (somewhat alleviated because they rules for the allowed discount rates have
changed, but the cash outflows are still real.

As a pair trade, I do like ESLT (EBIT Systems, israel defense contractor,
strength in drones,electronics, strong export business, cheap)

Long: DWA (Dreamworks)! Cheap by some metrics, decent balance sheet, low market
cap given the franchise, the near term challenge is to overcome the loss in DVD
sales? DWAis building a stable of franchises overtime (Kung Fu Panda, Shrek
etc. that they should be able to monetize.) They want to get into cable channel
programming which if auccessful, should create reoccuring revenues. A catalyst
could be the November release of "Rise of the Guardians", if successful. Many
ways, i can see this working outin the long run...

ESLT - well i bought a few shares this am at 30.51$. ESLT for sure seems cheap
and I don't think it has pension issues to the extend that US and some European
companies have them. ESLT has a broughtly diversified business with customers
in Israel, Europe, the US and other countries. Defense products from Israel
have a good reputation and I know for fact that the optics from there are top
notch. I also think they more are affordable than US products.

It is amazing to see the US defense stocks marching upwards and onwards. I
can;t see that either of the candidates has good things in store for the
defense business so i am shaking my head. i would venture that both LMT and NOC
are in those big fat programs that just need to be cut, if the defense budged
will be trimmed.

As for DWA, i am still somewhat on the fence but i like what i see in terms of
international expansion. DWA is now after Pixar went to DIS, the only major
standalone animation studio and 1.5B$ would be easy for an acquirer to digest.
the upside could be huge, if they can get into cable channel programming or the
ventures in China work out (hopefully with favorable financing). FWIW, I

Congrats of a great T trade. I sold mine a while ago; left too much on the
table, but it just seems overvalued. Of course so is AMZN, lol

Bought some MRVL. at 10.4$. 40% of the market cap is in net cash. MRVL is also
an Einhorn pick, not that this means much, since everything he goes long, seems
to fall into pieces ( health insurerers, GM, DL.AS etc.). MRVL apparently is
hit by RIMM weakness but i think there strength is more in storage.

ATPG bit the dust. i know i expressed reservations about this one a couple of
years ago. when a company goes belly up and I had looked at it. I try to go
back and see what happened. Here the very post i saw in May of 2010 noted that
the bonds were at a yield to maturity of 18% thus pricing in a high likelihood
of default, that coupled with a company ceo with a history of not delivering on
his promises were some pretty strong warning signs. In retrospect it was a bit
like people who buy goods on credit and dont try to negotiate the price because
they know they are never going to pay for the goods. I have been frequently
told that the bond market is a much better guage of likely bankruptcy than the
equity markets , seems true in this case.
now the question is whether there some publicly trade debt worth buying?

aabvf abg.to I am having second thoughts about saying i will vote no to this
merger. this may well be a historic opportunity to make
investments/speculatinos in the junior mining space, which has pretty much been
left for debt.
depending on the ease with which they can sell off dacha portfoilio and
reinvest the proceeds into equities. i might say yes to the deal. if i were a
big investor i think i would just say look if this is your goal convert all
your inventory into cash and lets see what you end up with. then we can make an
informed decision about whether we want to dillute our ownership in the hopes
that you will make us a great deal of money putting that new capital to work.
because the downside is that the dacha investors will be looking to exit this
play. there is also in my mind some question about where these rare metals are
being held and how easy will it be to sell , take the proceeds out of where its
now and and then deploy the capital back in canada or us. if these answers are
satisfactory then i may change my mind.

<<ATPG bit the dust.>>

<<now the question is whether there some publicly trade debt worth buying?>>

there is a 1.5 billion issue of public second lien debt, recently dropped below
30, but presumably on monday drops a bit more. they have no provided numbers
recently so it is difficult to assess just what the value of the bonds might
be. i have seen people i regard as thoughful range from zero to full par, not
too helpful. i am still trying to develop and estimate i am comfortable with.
around 10 i expect to be a serious buyer and i expect to pick up some before
that. of course i am a bad guage, since i just sold my ATPG bonds last monday
for 34 and change, so WTFDIK? i am thinking buying back double the face at 17
might be my entry point, but still trying to get my arms around the numbers.

of course, beyond the numbers, this is really a very levered play on oil
prices. if they are able to get Clipper producing soon at the expected level,
they might be around 15 million barrels/year, so every $7 change in price is
roughly $100 million swing in revenues. oil at 50 kills them no matter what,
and oil at 150 saves them no matter what IMHO.

I don't see the rationale in Dacha's business plan - hording rare earth metals
does not generate any cash flow. It also seems to me that the merger is
dilutive to AAB's NAV. I have only a small position but I'll vote against the
merger.

Re MRVL - I buy MRVL while I buy most other stock, it is cheap by most metrics
and MRVL specifically has almost 4$/share in cash. I am guessing that they can
rebound, ex cash (somewhat iffy metric) the stock trades at 6 x earnings. I
think the dividend, which I think will be raised, provides some downside
protection as well.

I don't care about Einhorn. He seems to have lost his touch on the long side. I
can name Delta Lloyd, DELL and the health insurers. He still does seem to have
a pretty good touch on the short side though.

i thought when i spoke about einhorn, i said "long term"...not what has
happened in the last yr. On Dell, i will say it again - in 2 yrs people will
regret not investing in this firm..

Interesting logic on Marvell. thanks.

MRVL is another situation where the numbers look great. Fantastic balance
sheet...but there are no catalysts.

If your investment strategy does not require catalysts, this is a buy.

Did I miss a catalyst? For me, I don't see a reason to buy this stock.

I don't see any reason to buy DELL either. Compared to IBM, it looks cheap.
It's selling at a discount but there's not a catalyst in sight to turn this
stock around.

I don't have a position in INTC but it looks more attractive to me than MRVL or
DELL.

MRVL. The company has a history of poor roe, and because of that, in my view
the stock, even after its drop, doesn't seem very attractive to me. I'll pass.

If the company were to do something with its cash, I might consider revisiting.

Talk about a value trap. Another dilutive deal for investors, which ticks me
off. AAB trading at over 50% discount and Dacha at less than 50% discount. AAB
contributing more assets, but getting only 48% of the new company.

Strategically the combination seems to make sense, but I hate always getting
the shaft in these things. I probably vote no, but with punitive break-up terms
I met hold my nose and vote yes.

These junior miner stocks seem very cheap and in a bad way, so it is good the

shafted. i might feel differently if the merger were being done and dacha was
all cash and it was very clear that they were going to be using the cash to
make junior mining investments but that is not the case. as far as i know they
have not sold off any of the inventory and are not holding even 25% cash at the
moment. so we have to accept whatever their ability to convert those rare
metals into cash and then hope they will put the cash to use in a timely
fashion in junior mining plays. I think its pretty ridiculous to expect patient
investors like myself to put up with those terms. I dont want to be in the rare
metals space and i dont want to be forced in there by some merger that i think
benefits the management of the company more than it does me. i hope there are
some institutional investors that feel the same way i do. if you want us to

Nik, I don't understand your take on DELL. You are bullish two years in

In an earlier post you stated first that it is not a buy for six months and
then in a later post you said that it's a buy looking out two years into the
future.

So, looking at it now, it's not a buy and should be reviewed again sometime
after six months from now but before two years....right? I won't ask why, but
if you get around to it, I wouldn't mind this information.

On Einhorn, his fund, Greenlight Capital has a return of over 20% since

Paul, that is just an excellent post on ROE.

You can't just take a metric at face value.

I'll add my two cents.......

MRVL has undergone a massive share buy back plan and that was the reason given
for attracting Einhorn's additional investment. Perhaps he sees this as an
acquisition target?

http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/13g-alert-david-einhorn-upped-marvel-technolo
y-position-by-60-15496/

<u>The Co. has been buying back its shares for the last four years</u>. But
this is not a substainable business plan.

Insiders have not been eager to buy shares at all and hold only a small
postition.

Yes, there is a possibility that the div. could be raised, but it needs to be
raised substantially for this stock to be interesting while it develops a
business plan to take on its competitors. The div. it pays is lower than other
more solid high techs such as Intel or Seagate.

MRVL falls short as a div. play and/or as a growth stock (referring to earnings
guidance) and will be in limbo for awhile until something changes.

MTLQU - I cannot say that I understand everything that is going on, so take the
following with a large grain of salt. :)

Are you just dividing 1.3B in liquidation assets into 30M of units outstanding
based on
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/40730/000119312512236445/d353943dex991.h
m ? You should probably be dividing into 36M units based on possible "diluted"
count. This reduces your possible gain to $37. Furthermore, the trust holds GM
stock and warrants. The price of GM stock dropped from $26 in March to $22 now.
This reduced the value of GM stock by 30% and the value of Series B warrants
($18.33 warrants) probably by more than a half. Looking at
http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/40730/000119312512355242/d365888d10q.htm ,
there are 36M units "diluted" and 1B of liquidation assets. This yields about
$28 per unit assuming GM price does not continue to drop. Distribution may be
higher if not all "dilution" happens. It is not clear to me when the
distribution will happen - probably when all claims are resolved, but that's
not clear to me either.

So really, if you buy this, you should short GM to preserve the current gain
factor. If you hold it naked, it's a levered GM position (Series B goes to
~zero if GM drops below $18...) purchased with a discount.

MTLQU - Actually it may be more complicated and worse than I initially thought.
It seems that new allowed claims get both units and GM shares+warrants (that
were already paid to other allowed claims in the past). In other words, each
additional allowed claim not only dilutes the unit count, but also reduces the
assets under liquidation by removing some of the GM shares+warrants in the
assets. In essence it is double-dilution. So really you have to estimate how
many remaining claims will be allowed.

Re: MTLQU

Thanks for your analysis, Jurgis. Here's the math I used:

30,158,595 units currently issued or pending issue.

The Trust currently holds:
23,258,394 shares of new GM ($21.63)
21,143,880 new GM warrants, which can be exercised at $10 (I'm calling that
$21.63, since they can be exercised at any time)
21,143,880 new GM warrants, which can be exercised at $18.33 (I'm calling that
$21.63, since they can be exercised at any time)

That's $1,417,763,311.02 in value, divided among the 30,158,595 units. I'm not
sure how dilutive the warrants are to GM shares.

Anyway, that calculates out to $47 of potential distributions per unit.

In 2Q there were 121,650 in new claims against the Trust, which meant 484,167
shares of new GM were distributed, and 440,373 of each warrant were
distributed, along with 1 unit for each claim (so, 121,650 new units issued).

Essentially, right now a unit-holder would get 0.77 new GM shares per unit
held, and 0.70 of each warrant, if there were no more claims against the trust
over the remainder of the trust's life. This is unlikely, but, 0.77 shares of
GM at yesterday's closing price, equates to $16.65 per unit, when I paid $15.20
per unit, and the 0.70 warrants equates to $15.14 of each warrant, per unit.

Given the fact that there will be more claims against the Trust (though, who
knows how large those claims will be - one would assume most of the bondholders
have been active in making claims already) these figures will be decreased
somewhat in the coming quarters. The $10 warrants should be a fairly safe bet
for remaining above their exercise price, the $18.33 warrants, maybe not, and
the GM shares will always be there.

I'm not saying this situation is any easy triple, or even a double (I've never
invested in a liquidation before), but I do believe these units offer the
potential for an adequate return on capital as currently priced.

I think you are very optimistic when you say

<blockquote>these figures will be decreased somewhat in the coming
quarters</blockquote>From the tables in the documents, there are still
potentially about 5M claims that can be allowed or dismissed. Assuming they are
all allowed and assuming each claim gets 3 shares of GM + 3 warrants (per your
ratios from Q2), the trust loses over 15M of shares+warrants in addition to 5M
dilution. You are left with 8M shares+warrants to be distributed over 35M of
units. That's less than $10 per unit at current prices. Plus there might be
further share allocations for taxes and operating expenses. I think this is the
worst case (not counting further GM stock drop), but I might be mistaken.

Obviously, if only 10% of claims are allowed - optimistically realistic number
perhaps - trust loses only 1.5M shares+ warrants. You end up with about $27-30
value. So IMHO, my previous numbers stand as optimistic upper point.

Make sure you really understand the currently ongoing trial if you invest. It
seems that there is a trial decision coming up about allowing or disallowing a
large number of remaining possible claims. It could be the key of how many
shares trust loses to claims. I can't say I understand it fully.

And I seriously suggest shorting GM to preserve your possible gains. If GM
drops to $15 or so, you won't see any gains even with 10% claim allowance
rate...

http://goo.gl/LpduM (NYSE: EXL) - Started a tracking position in IRA

Increased positions in these two specialty Canadian mining stocks; AUNFF and
CPPMF. AUNFF is a silver producer that still is building out their Shafter mine
(not producing yet)and reported some minor delays in getting the facility
online (water leakage). To me, that's a buying opportunity as sellers give up
on the stock. 2013 estimated production is large especially if/when the Shafter
mine adds to the pot. Their cost of production is around 1/3 of the current
market price.

CPPMF is a similar mine that produces copper. They have yet to get their mine
into full production. Stock has been selling off due to low expectations for
future copper demand (especially from CHINA) resulting in lower copper prices.
These things are cyclical, so as long as their cost of production is lower that
the market price, the mine will be profitable. Once the cycle turns (they
always do), both these stocks could be multi baggers when future productions
comes on line.

EXL has exposure to Southern CA real estate (ie mini malls) and has a low debt
profile (for an REIT). Insiders have been buying the common shares so I decided
to nibble at some of their common too for the IRA. In June 2012, I started a
position in their preferred EXLpB. It sells at a 5.5% premium to par (@ $25).
My cost is 2.5% above Par $25.60/share so rather than adding more to the
preferred, I thought a few common shares (w/ a yield of 5.6%) my be the better
value buy.

XIN,

From 13F filings, the top shareholder Blue Ridge Capital sold 2.7 million
shares last quarter. They own 11 million more shares. It appears that they were
an initial investor at < $1 in a private equity fund and the fund is winding
down, so they are selling out. From an old seeking alpha article, I saw mention
of the company canceling a secondary offering a couple years back in which Blue
Ridge would have sold shares.

IMO, the Blue Ridge sale puts a short-term cap on the stock price, but also is
positive for the long-term as the company will be able to complete its buyback
at cheap prices. Some other smart institutions such as Renaissance Technology
and Millennium Technology increased shares during the last quarter and the CFO
