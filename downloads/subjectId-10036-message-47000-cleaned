Hi Sergio -

Re: Battery Technology R&D at a value price

I have been researching OM Group. They have a fairly large Battery Division
http://www.omgi.com/product-batterytechnologies.html

Within this Division is a subsidiary company called EaglePicher Technologies,
LLC
http://www.eaglepicher.com/content/view/36/70/

EaglePicher Technologies is a leading provider of advanced batteries and
battery materials. EaglePicher Medical Power develops implantable batteries
used in medical devices.

My interest lie in efficient consumer batteries that are required in all the
new smart phones. It looks like they have a Consumer Group that targets their
research and development in this area.

http://www.eaglepicher.com/content/view/57/91/

The use of specialized materials integrated w/ new technologies (ie smart
charging systems) is producing more efficient and powerful batteries for this
growing market.

OM Group's Battery division makes up only 9% of the total annual revenues.
Still it is a fairly large player (sales $130M) in the area they focus in.

For a value play, OMG's forward PE of 7.5, buys almost a 10% pure emerging R&D
battery play.

Question for you on ERF since you seem to have a lot of knowledge on the
company. I have been looking at it since January, but have not yet pulled the
trigger. I am making room in my IRA so I can avoid the tax bite.

My questions relate to why ERF has used so many of its assets on new gas
acquisitions when there is and will be a market glut of natural gas for all the
foreseeable future. It seems to have even diluted its stock equity recently for
this purpose. Are they just looking at the long term picture? Buying straw hats
in the winter??

It's earnings seem flat with little improvement in sight. It's costs,
especially drilling and administrative costs are fairly high, no?

Any idea whether they can maintain the dividend? From Q4 results:

"Our adjusted payout ratio, which calculates dividends plus capital spending
divided by funds flow, was 221% for 2011. However, after including our net
acquisition and disposition activity, our adjusted payout ratio was 153%. Our
payout ratio has increased year-over-year as a result of our significant
investment in early stage growth assets that are not generating immediate
production or cash flow. This has been compounded due to the decline in natural
gas prices."

Will the dividend be partially funded from proceeds from the recently issued
shares to Canadian investors?

SEB should do okay if co. can continue to increase book value and if stock
comes into more favor (higher p/e again). Number of shares bought for profit to
be obtained is -- for me -- a function of my willingness and risk level to take
small absolute dollar profits with many stocks that I am buying in small
amounts and holding . (I don't mean scalping. I mean I hope for a good
percentage gain for the small dollars invested -- on each of many, many
stocks.) As I view it with SEB, the longer (more years) I am willing to hold,
the larger the profit possibilites might be.

Also importantly for me, it's not so much how many SEB shares I have just
bought-- also I have to consider my willingness and commitment to continuing to
add more shares if/as SEB stock drops further.

ERF. No, sorry, but I don't have much knowledge about ERF, and I don't follow
it that closely. I do hold shares though. I've bought the stock for two
reasons: its diversified oil properties - Bakken, Cardium, Duvernay - and
because of its dividend. Now that very high current yield just seems to be
screaming that the market doesn't believe that the dividend is sustainable. And
with producers still shutting down nat gas wells, I believe the likelihood of a
dividend cut has continued to increase. Which might drop the stock even
further. As I consider ERF oil production for 2012, there seem to me to be more
attractive stocks on a production/enterprise value - although they don't pay a
dividend.

For me, it seems risky to hold this stock now: I have been considering reducing
my position.

re PNX -
Book value at $9.67. 

I noticed that the deferred acquisition cost of ~1.3B$ exceeds the shareholder
equity of 1.2B$ or 110% of the equity. I compare this with solid and high rated
life insurance companies, where DAC is typically in the order of 50% of their
equity, sometimes even less. This indicates aggressive accounting (activating
costs)
Also, their income statement is riddled with special charges year after year,
any idea when they are going to be done with them?

I personally would not make a contract with them for a long tail insurance
because their AM Best and credit rating is so crappy (BB-), although apparently
improving. This is a high beta dogshit company (imo).

FWIW, it appears that you are very good at what you do and probably have
results that exceeds my returns. I am guessing that you also accept much higher
risk than I do. For me, the apparent momentum in stock price is not worth the
risk indicator that i see in the balance sheet, which would make me very
uncomfortable to average down, should this stock go down for whatever reason.
So it's not a stock for me unfortunately.

Phoenix has been in business since 1851, so they must have done some things
right to survive

Special charges are now done and that is why the estimates of earnings at .40
this year. As long as this is an earnings driven market and the company can
meet or beat earnings it should head towards the target of $4.00. What I have
found is that the risk/reward of small undervalued stocks like this far exceeds
those of other companies. Especially considering that Phoenix has been in
business since 1851, and remains a buyout candidate at an estimated value of
$5.00. The downside risk is limited and the reward is a possible double from

re PNX -
The downside risk is limited and the reward is a possible double from here.

This stock was at ~1$ in Sept. 2011. My guess that would define the downside.
Also from a fundamental analysis side, based on my cursury review of the
balance sheet I am not sure that the special charges are done. Due to the
outsize (imo) amount of deferred acquisition cost, I think there is a lot of
risk that this asset will have to be written off (especially since the
profitability of the existing business may be challenged by the low interest
environment).

Part of what irks me a bit in your stock proposals is that you solely mention
the positive fact, but never the negative ones. I do not know if this is simply
because you concentrate solely on the upside, or buy based on blend of
fundamentals and charts (which I suspect), or you just think we can do our own
homework (which we can). However my preference would be that you share all the
facts that you are aware of, not just the bull case. As someone who is heavily
invested in a stock like PNX, I suppose you are aware of the fact ,that PNX is
considering a reverse stock split. I don't think I need to tell you that post a
reverse split, stocks often tend to lag:

PNX too risky for me also.

I'd rather have MET or something with a p/e of 5-7 vs. PNX with it's "historic
p/e of 8.5". I show that PNX had a big decline in stated bv by '08, negative
p/e in '08-'10. The company's net income was .07 in '11, and depending on which
of three Yahoo analysts one might believe, forecasted earnings this year might
be between .25 and .56. At .56 and a p/e of 5 or 6, the stock could or will or
might make a good move from here. OTOH, at .25, the stock seems to me at least
fully-valued. The p/stated bv is very low. Otoh, the p/stated bv has been low
(under .5) for several years. The p/bv is very very low now, so maybe there's a
good possibility of improvement as the company gets re-evaluated by investors.
Or maybe the stock just languishes at it current low p/bv.

The company may have been in business since 1851, I only see though about a
decade of stock performance, and it doesn't look so good to me. And so I take
no comfort that the company's been in business a long time.

"...I'd rather have MET or something with a p/e of 5-7..."; so I was going to
say look at The Travelers Companies, Inc. C (TRV). A recent SeekingAlpha
article listed it as undervalued when compared to it's GN of $68.74 (
http://seekingalpha.com/article/403571-11-s-p-500-dividend-stocks-undervalued-b
-the-graham-number ). The article failed to use the TBV. I still have it on my
"value" watch list at it's current price of $58.90.

MetLife was one of four companies that failed the Federal Reserve’s
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review test, which was applied to many of
the largest U.S. financial firms.

MetLife Fumes as it Fails Fed Stress Test

http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2012/03/14/metlife-fumes-as-it-fa
ls-fed-stress-test/
However digging deeper in the article:

"...Last December, MetLife reached an agreement with General Electric to sell
its online banking operations, and it is also winding down MetLife Bank’s
forward mortgage business and so by mid-2012 it will cease to be considered a
bank.

MetLife had excess capital of $3.5 billion at the end of 2011 and management
expects that to grow to $6-7 billion by the end of 2012. The company wants to
return excess capital to its shareholders, but its plan for $2 billion in stock
repurchases and a dividend increase from $0.74 per share to $1.10 per share was
rejected by the Fed...."

But now that I read the Forbes article about MET, it actually may be a buying
opportunity w/ all the negative news regarding their failed stress test. <u>MET
appears to have offloaded their banking division along w/ it's forward mortgage
business.</u> I am not sure if everything has been written down and/or if the
FED consider these transactions in their stress test but these are the event
driven news that can create value opportunities.

According to the link referenced in the Forbes article
(http://www.trefis.com/company?hm=MET.trefis# ), they value MET at $39.23 or 6%
below it's current market price.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Therefore, I still think TRV presents a low risk value play in the insurance
business. I do not own it but have been watching it along with your buys in
MET.

Re: PNX 

<<This stock was at ~1$ in Sept. 2011. My guess that would define the downside.
>>

optimist.

if everything works out this could make some money, but downside is zero, and
if interest rates had not dropped so much to permit the asset values to
increase from end 2008, where would they be now? one should read the various
disclosures in public documents about unusual transactions and contemplate the
implications of those transactions.

it would also be interesting to examine the comp packages of the top 5 over the
past 5-10 years, and compare that to (1) comp of managements at similar sized
companies (go ahead, even count similar sized companies that made decent money
for shareholders), and (2) total dividends paid to shareholders, or profits, or
....

IMHO you will conclude, as i have, that the company is run for the benefit of
management, not shareholders. not as badly today as it was under previous
managements, but that IMHO is largely because they are running out of
shareholder money to award to management for the results they have produced for
shareholders.

if you evaluate the stock price of PNX relative to book value, you are looking
at a value trap of the worst kind. if you evaluate it on the basis of
normalized earnings over a number of years in a fair manner, i think you will
conclude the price is extremely high relative to underlying earnings, UNLESS
they get their expenses in line. if you compare their average expense per
policy to other life insurers i think you will want to check your numbers a
couple of times because you will not be able to understand how their expenses
could be so high as compared to the competition. and then if you compare what
their expenses per policy would have been if they had a comp policy for the top
5 that was more like other companies of similar size and performance, i think
you might say 'ahh, the difference is to a large degree excessive management
salaries'. and then if you think to yourself, 'well, someone needs to take them
over and strip out those excess expenses. should be easy enough to do.' i
invite you to circle back to my conjecture that perhaps the company is being
run for the benefit of management, not shareholders.

but if everything goes just right, one could make a little money here.
personally i do not think it is a very attractive risk/reward proposition,
which is what i think Mr. Clownbucks is saying. but i often find myself
agreeing with Mr. Clownbucks.

Investing style differences are what make the difference between good yearly
returns and mediocre or losing ones. My investing style is to find stocks that
the herd has not discovered yet and wait for the company's stock to be
discovered. I have done very well with that approach, beating the S and P
handily for the past ten years. I am up 14 times what I started with in my IRA.
This is why I accept some risk in some of my portfolio holdings, because when
you do buy a stock that has some risk, your returns are much greater when
companies reorganize their business plan and make profits.

Yes, I do leave it to the personal investor to do their own due diligence after
mentioning some of the recent highlights. These I glean from reading recent
financial reports, CEO interviews, and other information. Information like
PNX's teaming up with State Farm and Edward Jones to offer insurance to
clients. In the case of PNX, we have had other people here mention the company
and I didn't know how much was offered up for information. If I didn't think
that the company had potential I certainly wouldn't mention it. I just am of
the opinion that the positives outweigh the negatives, and I purposely waited
to buy shares in PNX until more was known about their reorganizing efforts and
their plan.

In the case of PNX and the proposed stock split, I think that since this is an
earnings driven market of stocks, in the final analysis it will probably be a
positive for the company, due to more mutual fund purchases, and greater
liquidity. I just witnessed some of your lag the market after the split story
in RES. I sold out prior to the split taking place due to that very concern and
it did sell off. Sometimes people get upset that they didn't buy shares in the
XYZ company after seeing the PPS go up six times. If you are too cautious in
buying stocks and only look at the possible negatives you never put yourself in
the position for good returns. You might not lose, but you never will have
those multibaggers either.

re MET - MET's failure is largerly irrelevant, except for the reputational
damage. Once they cease to be a bank holding company ( They can change the
status once the sale of their bank operation is closed), the FED has no say in
what MET can or cannot do.

Reading in the aforementioned FED report MET seems to fail the test because of
~11.5B$ of assumed realized losses and 7.9B$ in fair value changes (due to
increased spreads) for held for sale loan. So roughly we talk about 21B$ in
assumed loan losses, which is pretty substantial relative to the 48B$ in
tangible equity that MET currently has.

While the FED opinions won't matter, once MET ceases to operate as a bank
holding company, the simulated scenario shows that MET (and other insurance
companies) are fairly vulnerable and maybe even more vulnerable than banks
currently to economic stress. For me, that is the real significance of this
test and I think it is important to remember in the future.

thatsnotluck re PCN -

thanks for your input. I think you said it better than I did. FWIW, I looked up
PNC history and while they have a long operating history, they demutualized in
2001 and 17.5$/share. At that point, they had high ratings (AA S&P, A from Best
ratings) but I think the sows of destruction were already there, when they went
public. In the 10 hears they were public, they never had a consistent operating
history and yet you are correct that management rewarded themselves amply.
Maybe the new management is better but it seems that in the past, the changes
were more like passing the baton from the number1 to the old number 2.
It remains to be seen if their balance sheet is too damaged to recover (would
any body with a little bit of knowledge really get into a long term insurance
contract with a company with crappy ratings while there is so much competition
with good ratings out there?).

I think if you want to invest in a crappy insurance company, HIG is the way to
go :-) ; at least they are sound to some extend, have decent ratings and a
possible catalyst. Maybe PLFE (which I understand has management issues as
well) is worth a look too, especially at a pullback. I own NWLI (largest

their brands (Pepsi, Doritos)

Hi Ditch -

I continue to hold SFL mainly for their generous dividend. Their main customer,
FRO seems to be doing better as a result of the higher price charters. In fact
it seems like many of the shippers have bottomed and now have turned the corner
so perhaps the next few quarters will be profitable for these companies.

I will start to peel off my high priced shares above $20.00/share (in the past
it was $29.00/share). My last large buy was 9/2011 at $14.80. I have got my
average cost down to $13.50/share but SFL still is a large position in the
portfolio now ranking number 7 or about a 4% position.

My other shipping companies are special situations; Ultrapetrol (Bahamas)
Limited (NasdaqGS: ULTR) and StealthGas, Inc. (NasdaqGS: GASS). Both are small
holdings compared to SFL. I am still underwater on ULTR but GASS is now
profitable.

It appears there is a lot of interest in Canada's grain companies. The major
global leaders are in a bidding war for Viterra.

Viterra Sets Up ‘Process’ After Getting Buyer Interest

http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-03-15/viterra-says-process-established-af
er-expressions-of-interest

From the article:"...Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM), Bunge Ltd. (BG) and
Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL) are in Viterra’s so-called data room after being told
they must offer at least C$16 a share, dealReporter said yesterday, citing a
person familiar with the situation whom it didn’t identify. Glencore is in
“advanced talks” with Agrium Inc. (AGU) and Richardson International Ltd. about
a joint bid for Viterra, the Financial Times said, citing industry executives
it didn’t identify. A formal bid may come next week, the newspaper said...."

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I own positions in all the bidders but not Glencore International Plc. It never
made it on my radar.

I wonder why I missed Viterra as they own all of the types of assets I find
attractive.

From the article:"...The company’s elevators and port terminals are well placed
in Canada and Australia to serve growing demand from Asia, Zandberg said.
Viterra owns more than half the grain-export capacity in Canada and all ports
in South Australia, according to the company. Canada is the fourth-biggest
wheat exporter after the U.S., Australia and Russia, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture...."

I still think many of the large Ag plays are still undervalued especially from
the bids we are seeing for Viterra. Once the market figures how cheap these
global companies are selling, I suspect we will see them bid higher based on
the comparable assets they already own around the world.

Just bases on the fundamentals and their traditionally very low ROA, I do not

of them overbids, since both looked cheap even compared to Viterra around
10$/share.

That sometimes seems to be the reason that people won't buy such stocks. In my
experience, I've found that that concern about low absolute margins to be
almost unfounded. First, companies can often go years or decades doing okay
with low margins. Especially if they have a lot of sales per share (low p/sales
ratio). Grocery chains, for example.

I could wrong here of course, but as far as I can tell, DIT seems to be doing

Hi brasilboy -

My main concern for SFL is that their biggest customer (FRO) accounts for 35%
of their revenues. Remember SFL is not a shipper but finances these ships under
long term contracts. The ships are essentially mortgaged to SFL (avg of their
fleet leases is 13 years). FRO was having significant cash flow problems due to
very low day rates and could not meet their finance obligations to SFL. Many of
their contracts were restructured to provide lower payments but higher profit
sharing w/ backing by billionaire Fredricksen (who owns a large equity interest
in each company).

So w/ their LT Debit/Total Capital of 69% is not that different than w/ a
leveraged REIT. One customer that goes BK and/or can not meet their LT contract
terms could/will hurt the financing company. I think SFL has seen the bottom in
their FCF (went negative late last year) and with the loan restructure for FRO
and higher charter day rates is in much better condition.

It's also nice to have a billionaire backstop that can step in and resolve
any/all financial problems w/ his checkbook.

ULTR has been a disappointment for me but the company is well positioned in the
niche shipping markets they serve. They have been investing in their River
business and should start growing that segment of their business. I am
currently holding for the next market cycle (it always seems like it's the next
quarter they will start putting up back to back EPS gains). I see that Paul
Senior gave up on his shares.

re used cars

<<New vehicle sales will continue to grow and low mileage cars are very hard to

The new car sales from 2007-2010 were way down to begine with and people are
holding on to the cars longer. The combination of these factors creates very
little used car supply from these vintages. I found this out myself and decided
to buy new (the Hyundai I was talking about a while ago.).

I do think that the Japanese (Honda, Toyota) are going to fight back with lower
prices. For one thing, they lost significant market share due to supply
disruptions and in the case of Toyota lack of fresh models, and now the Yen is
down 10% against the US$, plus they are outsourcing more and moving production
away from Japan. I believe this gives them leeway to gain back market share,
and they have to do this with better prices.

Hi thatsnotluck -

I believe the SFL SDRL loans were paid off and/or sold back to Fredricksen and
his holding company (there was a clause typical of a lot of their contracts
where the asset can be sold and/or loan paid off w/ special minimum profit
payments to SFL). I believe the SDRL loan and/or the asset was sold w/ loan
paid off back to SDRL w/ some type of equity financing. SFL made money on the
deal but just not as much if they kept the loan in tact. It did impact their
cash flows but LT debt was reduced too.

As long as Fredricksen maintains a large equity position in the company (ie
SFL) his interests are in line w/ mine as a shareholder. But you are right,
there can be a conflict of interest especially if he sells a portion of his SFL
shares and/or starts that new (rumored) FRO_2012 private company and does not
allow SFL to do some of the financing.

FWIW, I was an early shareholder of DRYS and that CEO did not have the
shareholder's interests in mind at all (IMO). Shares were diluted and under the
table deals were done that confiscated my equity even though the company was
creating value. However, the only value it was creating was for the CEO. Then
when rates dropped and the company almost went BK, the CEO pocketed even more
money while the shareholders were left holding the bag.

So, I guess it's a matter of perspective. I have been a long time holder of SFL
since the IPO and the company has done well for me. You need to sell shares
when the company gets over valued based on their cash flows (I have always sold
in the $25/share - $29.00/share range), because of the nature of their
business, you will have the chance to buy them back at $0.50 on the dollar.

If you have been a buyer recently in the $10.50/share range. it's probably not
too bad to peel some shares off and take your profit. Both SFL and FRO are up
big today as investors seem to think the worst is over on day rates and those
rates will be much higher in the future.

The other risk w/ SFL is that the next generation of ships will be much more
energy efficient making their operating cost much lower. SFL has few if any of
these ships in their lease fleet. This makes their future cash flows vulnerable
from a competitive position. I would like to see them finance these next
generation vessels, in particular those that Fredricksen has in mind for his
new company. If he chooses not to use SFL as the financing arm, it alerts me as
a shareholder that maybe I should find the exit door before the competitive
environment "stings" SFL.

The Paul Senior secret method for buying a new car.

I can't beat the dealerships in the sales process. Why would I even expect too?
It's their business to get - extract - the best price they can, and they are
salesmen and women who practice doing this every day. Vs. the rest of us who
might do a little homework once every few years when we go to buy.

There are three methods I see for improving a position vis-a-vis the dealership
and the cost of buying/maintaining a car.

1. Don't buy new. Buy used cars from private parties. Don't buy at all (keep
the ole junker). Don't own a car at all.

2. Have a mechanic friend with dealership training/access. You buy a used car
-- even a high mileage one - and you keep it and have your mechanic friend
service it.

3. The Paul Senior way. Buy a new car AND concurrently buy stock in your car's
auto manufacturer. As an example, if someone were a value investor who bought a
new Hyundai, my guess is the person would be planning on keeping the car maybe
5 or more years. For a $30k car investment, I suspect a person making an
additional $$ investment in Hyundai stock at that time (unfortunately though,
likely through iShares EWY), and also holding those shares for the life of the
car ownership -- that person would be satisfied with the results. That's how I
do it, anyway. (Audi bought---> a small proportional $ amount of VLKAY bought).
I first got this idea from reading Peter Lynch: One of his best ideas he said,
was buying Subaru stock at about $3 and selling it a few years later at about
$30. It dawned on me when reading that, that when I bought my new Subaru in
'74, the stock was selling for $3 and I could've, but didn't buy the stock at
that time. Ever since, when I buy a new car, I've been very attuned to perhaps
acquiring stock in the manufacturer also.

HDSN (Hudson Technologies, Inc)
$3.72, cap 88M, trailing PE 92
How's that for a value stock?
They are the only publically traded company selling R22 refridgerant--R22 is
used as a coolant for 60% of all cooling sytstems (AC, refridgerators, etc.) in
US. It's a fragmented market with lots of small players and they have 20%
market share. Since 2004, the EPA has been limiting the production of R22
becuase it's bad for the ozone. Last month EPA announced plans to further
reduce R22 production
(http://www.hudsontech.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/EPA-R22-FactSheet.pdf).
Since then the price of R22 has skyrocketed along with the stock price of HDSN.
Last year 30lbs cylinder costed $160. It now costs $425 (http://www.r-22.com/).
So for this year their earning from their virgin gas sales should increase
significantly.
They have additional drivers for earnings.
(1) Recycling: They have a patented process for recycling the R22 gas. This is
the reason EPA is limiting production of R22, to increase recycling. In the
past when R22 was cheap, the contractors had little incentive for reclaiming
the R22 gas. Although illegal, it was easier for them to vent the R22 into air
and sell their customers virgin gas. Now with signifcant increase in price of
R22 they are going to get much more recycling business. This has higher margins
than selling virgin gas. They already have the infrasturcture to handle
significantly more volume without additional capital expense.
(2) Joint venture in Europe starting this year.
Price of the stock has moved up quite a bit, but I think there is more upside.
How much? Not sure. But if you use their invstor presentation projections, you
can get a estimate of $1/sh in earning from just recycling at R22 price of
$14/lb (approximate current price). Plus you get additional revenues form
virgin R22 sales and European joint venture making this a "value" stock.
They have a good investor presentation on their website:

Paul, bad timing on your switch to FDP from DOLE. Better than expected earnings
pushed the latter up almost 12% today. So it goes.

On the other hand, thanks for your lead on IEP, which has been performing very
well.

Jon,

I understand your point and probably once shared it, but I think in this case
there are few items going DIT's way.

1) In the last 5 years net debt represents about half of the '05 level and book
value has grown exponentially and consistently from negative to over $40
million. If you have time, I encourage you to read through the Chairman's
annual letters, where liquidity and low debt have been focus points.
Additionally, I think it was in '09 when the company redeemed convertible
preferred shares at a discount - at the time they felt strongly not to have
dilutive shares out there threatening the shareholders. I've never met the CEO,
but he strikes me as what Jim Collins would call a "Level 5 leader".

2) If you look at a map of DIT's distribution area, you would see that it is
primarily focused in the Midwest - "Serving Middle America" begins the 2011
annual report. As bullish as a person can be on railroads, in this area of the
country trucking has advantage of reach. Think of it like this; being a refiner
in the Northeast is unenviable position, but in Cushing, Oklahoma it's a
wonderful business enjoying healthy margins.

Here's the list of DIT's distribution centers:

Bismark, North Dakota
Crossville, Tennessee
Omaha, Nebraska
Quincy, Illinois
Rapid City, South Dakota
Springdale, Arkansas
Springfield, Missouri

If these aren't places you are excited to go, so would the competition.

In 2010, DIT acquired Discount Distributors for approximately $4 million,
expanded its reach and added $60 million of sales.

3) One thing that we didn't mention is that 72% of their revenues are from
cigarettes, which face high excise taxes - this is the one item that will be a
drag on the business.

Finally, one question keeps coming back to me: "Why would a micro cap company
helmed by a private equity guy distribute freely its annual report through the
WSJ annual report service?"
