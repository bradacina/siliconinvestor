Anyone care for mortgage reits? Here's my 2 picks:

#1 - (IMH) Impac Mortgage -
- stock has gotten absolutely clobbered - stock is at $8.62 - which is below
book value - mngt announced they're going to buy back shares - pays a
$.25/share qtrly dividend

#2 - NEW - New Century Financial Corp
- stock also clobbered - NEW announced in '06 that they'll do combo of $8/share
in dividends & stock buyback in '07 but everyone thinks they're taking a bath
in defaults - which we'll know for sure on 8 Feb '07 when they report -
meantime - stock pays about $1.90/qtr dividend & at $30.27

- over the years - mortgage reits have fluctuated widely - if they don't go out
of business - the survivors seem to do very well & throw off nice dividends

International Paper Completes Exchange of Brazilian Assets With VCP
http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/news_press_release,53709.shtml

From the article:..."This investment complements our global strategy, improving
our competitive position, while adding value to shareowners. The project is
immediately earnings accretive, with greater than cost of capital returns, and
doubles the EBITDA of our Latin American business," said John Faraci,
International Paper chairman and chief executive officer. "The Luiz Antonio
mill is a globally cost-competitive paper mill, and its addition to our
portfolio, along with our plans for the paper operations in Tres Lagoas,
significantly expands our uncoated freesheet capacity in Latin America while
providing growth opportunities in the region."

Blankmind, here are three mortgage reits that I'm holding:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AHM,NCT,RSO&d=s

AHM's my favorite of the three: I like the reputations of some of the
institutional holders.

Fwiw, I am a recent buyer of PCC. It's a reit, and part of its business is
mortgage related, primarily with commercial real estate.

These things seem risky to me --- as well as to most folks, I presume. That may
(or may not) make some of them bargains. Apparently lots of people who've had
NEW and stayed with it are doing very well in total return. I've always been
too fearful to be a buyer.

Now I can relax. For a no-brainer buy (There are NO no-brainer buys. NONE.
There's risk everywhere.) for a "guaranteed" 50% gain in under two months, it

From the article:"...The Company continues to execute its synergy
implementation plan ahead of schedule. The synergy plan is expected to achieve
run rate operating income improvements at the high end of the previously
announced range of $40 to $50 million early in fiscal 2008. Through December
31, 2006, the Company already has achieved run rate synergy benefits of
approximately $41 million..."

It appears that management came through with a better than expected report. Now
they need to show good growth, continued strong operating margins and improving

i would like to follow up on PPMD with a few comments.

i also own BLFS which has around 68 million shares and trades for around 9
cents.

BLFS recently released it prelimary sales figures - you can read the PR here:

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/070123/latu026.html?.v=85

what i would like to point out is that BLFS did have an increase in revenues
but the company lost nearly 3 times its revenues whereas if you look at the
last filings for PPMD they were actually making a profit prior to going to the
pinks.

please take the time to look at BLFS financials:

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/834365/000135448806000704/filing_314.htm

and compare them to Protides last filing:

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/883720/000089710104000721/protide041936_
0qsb.htm

i believe that sales for PPMD have increased as they have for BLFS only that
PPMD is in much better financial condition. i suspect its sales are as good as
- or perhaps better than BLFS and that the company operates at a small profit.

BLFS has a market cap of $6,000,000 whereas PPMD has a market cap of only
$720,000. if PPMD were to share the same market cap as BLFS it would be $1.25
today.

here are some of PPMD's products:

With subprime defaults continuing to rise (and associated horror stories about
fraud and lax lending standards), these two mortgage reits are quite risky.
They are levered and own/originate subpar collateral.

I think they could make or lose you a lot of money. I don't know which, but

"It appears that management came through with a better than expected report."

I don't agree. The consensus estimate for the fourth quarter was 17 cents, so
it looks like they missed by two cents.

A couple of other points from the quarter:

"Consolidated net sales for the first quarter were $411.9 million, compared to
$480.4 million versus the same period last year. Declines in the residential
housing market contributed to lower revenues, but the resulting decline in
volumes was partially offset by product price increases."

This stock is as much a play on housing starts as it is on water
infrastructure.

"U.S. Pipe operating income was $7.2 million, compared to a loss of $27.8
million in the prior period, which included $40.0 million of closure costs
related to the Chattanooga valve and hydrant plant."

If you take out the restructuring charge,the operating income for US Pipe was
down.

Anvil Segment

"Operating income was $13.0 million versus a loss of $1.5 million during last
year's first quarter. Excluding the prior year acquisition-related inventory
charges of $12.2 million, operating income increased $2.3 million, primarily
due to higher pricing and approximately $1.2 million of dumping duty proceeds
awarded by the federal government."

Higher pricing and one time charge led to the increase in this division.

It appears to me that lots of restructuring charges are built into the earnings
report. The company cut their debt which helps with interest expense. But there
are just too many moving parts in the financials for me to see this as a pure
water infrastructure play that is increasing sales. The company isn't overly
expensive, but I'm not sure if they will make their yearly estimates without
lots of restructuring charges.

Just my opinion, of course. Good luck with your investment.

Rich Evans, about component suppliers. It looks to me like your analysis of
these companies has played out correctly over the past two years. Your
conclusion to avoid these stocks has proven correct. (imo)

I don't see anything in the business environment where demand will again match
supply. Supply just dominates and decimates (it appears to me).

Right now I'm somewhat conflicted: It's what I see or don't see in the future
vs. my reliance on past historical performance reverting to a mean. A possibly
permanently changed business environment vs. rear-view mirror investing.

Sometimes, at some point, I override my feelings and just buy based on
companies falling within the numerical ratios I'm looking for.

I'm buying VSH now, and adding a little to remnant holding of SEMI. Very small
bets only. The stocks fit what I'm looking for in p/sales and p/book. Two
somewhat comforting aspects for me: with SEMI, an outside company has taken a
large position at around current price, and wants to work with SEMI to increase
shareholder value (so they apparently say). With VSH, I notice that Matrix
Asset Advisors has a position, and I have a lot of respect for the stock
picking ability of David Katz, the guy running it. But not enough respect or
confidence to make more that just a very small bet on VSH (or SEMI). -gg-

Yes, every one analyses from a demand standpoint and forgets about supply.
Supply controls it seems in a global enviroment with the Chinese. I did this
also and a wise man told me to think about supply. So now I try to do this.
Demand can work with a special product or niche product but in technology this
does not last for ever. Microchips hit an all time demand in sales but look at
the margins and profits in the industry.

VSH is the best of the component guys IMO. I own tyco and will be looking hard
at the tyco electronics spin off to see if I want to keep it. Basically it is a
passive component company with 30% of its business to the auto industry in
cables and connectors.

Another aspect of supply is being the low cost producer. So plant location is
very important.

EMS is another industry which has changed. Growth has stalled generally from
competition, overcapacity, chinese, koreans etc. Net margins continue to be in
the 1-2% area. Business mix is extremely important- witness CLS, SANM,SLR.
Vertical versus horizontal business model is important. The mid tier companies
minding their knitting and not issuing shares for bad combinations have done
the best like JBL, PLXS and BHE. But last 6 months even these companies have
come down quite a bit. Once again it is a supply problem, plenty of capacity
and competitors. At least VSH has some special products with good margins like
their strain gauges, inductors, and their power chip business. Buying rest of
Siliconix was a good idea.

But I am staying clear of most passive and active component suppliers The
pricing is brutal with the 5% ASP declining every year which is the best case
scenario. And if you get hit with a commodity splurge like copper going from $1
to 3.50 a pound then you take a hit like Tyco of $500 mill a year for the
200mill pounds it uses in its cables.

You may remember Paul K.He has stuck with EMS and taken a beating especially in
CLS and SANM.
Anyway good luck with your investing. The Macroeconomic situation looks OK to
me but geopolitical matters keep me on edge.

Brokerages. I don't know which one would meet your needs, Winix.

Depending on how you look at it, they all play games or they all have their
strengths/weaknesses as they go after different customers. For example, I have
one brokerage account that offers low margin rates and relatively low trading
costs. The tradeoff being those costs go up a lot if you buy more than 1200
shares and/or if you buy stocks under $1/sh.

I get around some problems somewhat by:

1. Having more than one brokerage account. Use a particular brokerage account
for a particular purpose (e.g. if buying 1200+ shares)

2. Placing limit orders vs. market orders.

Defense stocks: I'm looking again at the sector after seeing that even more US
spending is going to defense and that something different has happened in IRAQ:
we (USA) have had four copters apparently shot down since mid January. (which
is either an anomaly or a new aspect of the war)
-----------------------------------------------

I'm considering TXT now, which makes or will make the Marine's helicopters. The
contract's already let, the stock's up, so Textron's a speculative bet (that
more helicopters orders will have to be placed), not a value pick at this
point. Imo.

I found SAIC,Inc., a spook kind of company. (Who really knows what all they do,
all the secret stuff and hidden contracts. And who ever heard of them - and
they with 43,600 employees.) I'll assume that the high secrecy level that I
suspect I see (or don't see)means that the company is tight with government
defense officials (procurement). I have bought a few shares of the stock. Here
again, a speculation.

I see I should have bought LLL when it was mentioned here (by Spekulatius in
August). That stock's up from lows to highs:

Fwiw, General Electric has a defense business component. That stock still looks
attractive to me, and I'm considering averaging up on my position. (Because of
relatively low forward p/e, increasing dividend, and company's on-going

Well, the SPOR tender seemed to be very highly subscribed, the company getting
all its shares at $4.80, so I'm guessing it may go back down. But, who knows?

That being said, I'm considering a position, but I have one main questions for
the SPOR crowd:

It seems like SPOR hasn't been very profitable over the years, but its cash
flow from operations has been relatively strong, which in a play like this with
the potential of going private is more important than GAAP earnings (can I
still call myself a CPA after saying that? Is anything more important than
GAAP? :))

That being said, what are the odds of this continuing given the recent broken
deal with Walmart?

I like the fact that the company is showing signs of trying to increase
shareholder value through the tender, I like that it's a NCA play, and I like
that it's cash flow positive. But, at what point would i buy is the question.

Paul,

I think this is the first company that I've actually owned before you. Wow,
what an honor, though if I'm sitting at a loss because I bought at higher
prices, should i still consider it an honor? :)

I've actually made a little money on this stock over the years on different
trades, owning it off and on since 1999, I believe. Back then, the outlook was
strong and the stock was going to the moon, but things have changed. They've
revised earnings estimates downwards and are in a bit of a holding pattern.

But, long-term prospects are great for this one if they can execute to some
degree. LED's are going into Laptops and IPOD-like devices soon and CREE just
needs to get some deals with a couple decent-sized players and they'll be in
good shape. On top of this, looking 5 years down the road, the LED (and
therefore CREE) is in good shape to capitalize on the death of the light bulb
(i.e. California's attempt to kill it legislatively) as LED's are very energy
efficient and much cooler than fluorescents. But, we'll see.

I'm just holding on to this one for the long-term now. And as you say, little
debt and lots of cash are starting to make this a value play, though I've
always looked at it as a growth play.

Thanks,

cw

Hi Paul Senior -

Both VCP and ARA have underperformed the iShares MSCI Brazil Index (EWZ) over
the last 24 months.

http://finance.yahoo.com/charts#chart2:symbol=ewz;range=2y;compare=ara+vcp;indi
ator=dividend;charttype=line;crosshair=on;logscale=off;source=undefined

The two year comparison shows that the "index" is 40% higher than ARA and 80%
higher for VCP. Most of the gain for the index is from oil related stocks.

Here is the list of holdings for the index:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hl?s=EWZ

Notice that the average PE for the group is below 12 which is a good value (and
does provide a hedge against a falling U.S. dollar). Maybe a better way to
invest in Brazil is to just buy the ETF. I believe there is a better value
proposition with VCP & ARA as long as one keeps their position small. My total
position is less than 1% of my taxable portfolio.

Too bad I missed investments in Brazil over the last 24 months as the index is
up over 140% during this period.

Well, Im disappointed but not really surprised that the entire 472,000 shares
are being bought back at the $4.80 low.

There are 6 holders with over a million shares total.
They simply have no chance to sell in the open market.

I got & glanced through the 10k & proxy recently and although Im not a CPA and
I do have A.D.D., I believe things will be better going forward based what I
read.

It appears the whole walmart fiasco cost them heavily and I think they would
have shown a nice quarter without that screw up.

Insiders didnt tender a single share. They dont own a lot directly but have a
boatload of options that are "in the money" so I have to believe they are
acting in their financial best interests.

I believe the company will be sold eventually. And the excess cash was of no
use to them.

Buying back the shares at $4.80 is accretive to book value.

The other thing that suggests things are going well is the officers have been
getting nice raises & bonuses. Im hoping that means things are going well but
it could just mean the board of directors make the keystone cops look
competent.
(Something Ive wondered for years)

I sold about 17% at $5.20 and didnt tender any because I was hoping that it
wouldnt be fully subscribed and they would only get a portion at $5.30.

I expect the stock to show some weakness, it already has.

But, I believe there will be a time within the next 9-24 months where we will
have a liquidity opportunity for more than $5.30.

How much more depends on earnings. Or perhaps EBITDA.

I recall a stock I used to own called Pure World that did what SPOR did...hired
an investment banker. Later let the deal expire with nothing being done, then
returned to profitability and then sold out at about 3 times the price.

Im hoping something like that could happen here. Although I dont think $15 is
in the cards.

Read the 10k and give me your thoughts.

SPOR has historically been pretty illiquid and a little buying or selling can
move the stock more than you would think.

My plan is to buy on weakness and sell on strength although I will maintain a
position waiting for an eventual endgame. A buyout by a strategic or financial
buyer is my guess.

One thing that struck me as odd as Ive never seen it before.
Page 35 of the 10k says "On 8/28/06, the BOD accepting the CFOs surrender of
the title of Controller, an officer position. He will continue to serve as CFO,
secretary & treasurer. The company hired a controller as a non-officer position
to provide assistance in the accounting department."

Is this just a nice way of saying he had too much on his plate and they hired
someone to help him ?

Never seen it before.

As for the thing with walmart, my reading of it is that without the losses
incurred for that fiasco, they would have had a nice 4th quarter. Those losses
wont be there going forward. That, and the payraises for officers along with NO
insiders tendering suggest that patience is in order here.

The board may be incompetent, but they have a big financial interest...mostly
via options and they hired an investment banker.

My guess is returning to profitability and then selling the company is the
plan.

Just to get an idea where Im coming from...I would be happy with $7.00 in 18-24
months. Although I hope for more.

Y2006 467M shares 9.0TCFE gas reserves

Sharecount up 25% YoY, reserves up 20%. Their debt is up somewhat too YoY, even
after for accounting the proceeds from the last share issue. That's all one
needs to know about CHK, IMO as far as creating shareholder value is concerned.
Of course Wall Street loves them since they generate a steady stream of
commissions with their deb/preferred share and share issues.

RE CHK I love them too and theres a lot more to look at. their price to cash
flow, their cost of finding reserves as compared to what they sell them for,
their calculated navs, not too mention that there is no immediate
proportionality between buying leaseholds and finding proven reserves. In the
company's detailed presentation of 2/5/07 they tell you that they increased
unproven reserves by around 80%, they improved nav per share by 20% or so. But
its ok for us to disagree. To me it seems clear that when you increase the
number of shares that much for an already large company its bound to keep
appreciation down, no matter how succesful or cheap the company is.

EKS. I don't expect USA paper stocks to outperform or match USA indices,.
Forests/trees/lumber/paper seem never get the interest that oil, commodities,
banking, steel get from USA investors, and maybe that's how Brazilian investors
see things too. So I don't expect VCP or ARA to match or beat the Brazilian
index.

OTOH, those two stocks are cheap enough by themselves imo for me to buy a
little. jmo. I could be wrong.

Some of the stocks in that Brazilian index look expensive to me. So maybe in
that way, there is some relative value to ARA/VCP. I do not know.

RE OSTK I must not have my brain cells functioning properly-the company reports
horrible q4 results. the stock goes down only a little after the results have
been reported. Today it receives an upgrade citing that perhaps all the news is
reflected in the stock and today the stock is up over 10%. Personally I think
this this company has had lots of chances it has a business model that works
and I find it remarkable that a brokerage firm could reccommend the stock
without some evidence that its business odel is working. This is as illogical
to me as Dell moving back up on news that the ceo is leaving and being replaced
by Dell who for the past 6 months has fully supported his CEO. Everyone seems

that are essentially in escrow as an asbestos settlement from 2003. The shares
will be given away in 2009 and whatever market value they have at that point
will be a current liability to the company. For the sake of extreme
conservatism, we’re going to shoot for the moon and value the GLW shares at
$2b, which amounts to $80/share in three years. That should take care of the
most pessimistic investors’ qualms, and clearing that trash out of the way, the
total breakup value for Corning comes to an impressive $35/share – with any
profitability in the environmental and life sciences groups being a great

SPOR...

I compute book value to be about $5.50 per share and cash to be about $2 per
share after the dutch tender.
Total share count is just 2.3 million.

As expected the stock exhibited some weakness tuesday.

Makes me wonder if one of the large tendering parties was actually proping the
stock up in order to get less folks to tender ?

Sounds a little paranoid, I know.

I remain hopeful that SOMETHING good will happen to increase the shareprice in
the next 3 months to 2 years.

In the nearterm, I expect the volume to slowly dryup and it will get back to
hardly trading and perhaps more volilitity because of the smaller float.

Well, I did some more research yesterday and I'm still interested in SPOR, but
probably not until/if it goes down to the 3's again.

I had initially thought that from my brief research that it had pretty strong
cash flows, but in looking at the financial statements again, yes SPOR had good
operating cash flows in 2005 and 2006, but most of that was due to balance
sheet changes such as increasing collections of Accounts receivable
year-over-year and/or increasing accounts payable balances year-over-year. So,
to me, unless operations can really turn around strongly, this is a play
waiting for a buyout or private transaction and hoping book value holds up to
some degree until this happens.

It seems that management is at least considering taking the company private. Do
you think the dutch tender was done to try to gauge at what general price they
could offer to go private at for all shares later down the road?

In my view, regardless, I think this play is interesting and if it goes down to
the 3's (close today, down to 4.25 at one point) I would try to catch some
shares and hope for another take out at $4.80 or higher. The thing I like about
SPOR these days is that mgmt seems to be at least interested in taking action
to increase shareholder value, which is a plus.

Hi Madharry -I believe GLW could go much higher (maybe $60) once their other
business segments begin to generate significant revenues. I was not aware of
the 25M shares they set aside for pending asbestos liabilities that must be
setteled by 2009.

When HAL was in the middle of their asbestos litigation, I bought the stock at
$9/share pre split and it eventually became a 10 bagger. I suspect GLW may have
over estimated their potential liability like HAL.

I do not believe the company has any plans to break up their business segments
now. As we get closer to 2009 and IF their asbestos litigation settlement
sours, they may do what HAL did by splitting out this division from the rest of
their other operations.

I plan on holding to see what develops.

Stockpickr: The Top Small-Cap Value Plays
By James Altucher
RealMoney.com Contributor
2/7/2007 8:40 AM EST
URL: http://www.thestreet.com/newsanalysis/stockpickr/10337196.html

As Warren Buffett has said, the three most important words in investing are
"margin of safety." Although small-cap companies offer the highest potential
reward -- small-caps that graduate to large-caps offer multiple 1,000% returns
-- they also are most likely to fall apart and become worthless.

At Stockpickr we keep track of, and update regularly, a portfolio of small-cap
value plays. These are stocks with market caps of less than $1 billion, P/E
ratios of less than 10 and little or no debt.

For whatever reason the market has abandoned them, but they often are
candidates to be acquired or bought up by the large mutual funds once Wall
Street recognizes the potential of their earnings.

Focusing on little debt ensures that liabilities won't eventually take over and
destroy the company. This gives us -- to some extent -- a margin of safety. In
addition to the link above, you can find this portfolio and other similar
portfolios in our Today's Lists section on Stockpickr.

FreightCar America (RAIL) is one of the names on this list. The stock is
significantly off its 52-week high of $78, a level I believe it can easily
reach again over the coming 12 months.

FreightCar agrees with this thesis, as it recently used its cash to announce a
$50 million buyback program. Looking at the basic numbers, the company has a
market cap of $743 million, but subtracting out its $184 million in cash gives
it an enterprise value of just $559 million. That's nothing compared with its
$180 million in cash flows. That means the company is trading at just 3 times
cash flows.

The rail-car industry is very cyclical, and, in fact, FreightCar's backlog of
rail-car orders has gone down significantly lately. That said, the company is
the leader in this space, and the aging fleets of many of the railroads
guarantee that orders will be forthcoming.

Analysts currently expect the company to earn $6.22 a share in 2007. How have
analysts done when predicting prior quarters? The company has beaten analyst
expectations for the past four quarters in a row.

I believe part of the reason shares of FreightCar sold off in May was because
activist hedge fund Pirate Capital is being required to give up its position in
the company due to redemptions. The company is also a candidate for a short
squeeze: It would take nine days of nonstop covering to cover all the shares
short at the current volumes.

Super hedge fund Citadel also owns FreightCar.

Aspreva Pharmaceuticals (ASPV) is also on our list of small-cap value plays.
The company has a $693 million market cap and $228 million cash in the bank
with no debt, giving it an enterprise value of $465 million. Combine that with
$126 million in cash flows and you get a company trading at just 3.5 times cash
flows.

Meanwhile, analysts expect the company to continue its strong growth,
forecasting revenue to increase from $212 million in 2006 to $237 million in
2007. They also expect the company to earn $3.45 per share in 2007.

Aspreva also shows up on the Stockpickr list of top free cash flow stocks, as
well as a list compiled by Stockpickr member "BamBam" of Magic Formula stocks.
These are names that satisfy the conditions of Joel Greenblatt's successful
investing book The Little Book That Beats the Market, in which he recommends
buying stocks with low multiples over cash flows and high returns on equity.

The list of 25 dirt cheap small-cap stocks includes Plexus (PLXS) , Avatar
Holdings (AVTR) and Omnivision Technologies (OVTI) . For the full list of

New Century shares plummet on warning

NEW YORK

Shares of New Century Financial Corp. plunged to a new 52-week low Thursday a
day after the mortgage lender said it didn't properly account for some of the
home loans it had to buy back.

The Irvine, Calif.-based mortgage bank, which lends money to home buyers with
blemished or limited credit histories, said late Wednesday it expects to report
a loss for the fourth quarter. Because of accounting errors, the company also
must restate results for the first three quarters of 2006. It hopes to have
that done by March 1.

Like many mortgage lenders, New Century doesn't keep its loans; it sells the
loans to banks and investors. The deals normally have clauses allowing
investors to force New Century to buy back a loan if the borrower misses an
early payment.

Loan repurchases are bad for mortgage lenders because few investors would sell
back a loan unless it lost value. Piper Jaffray analyst Robert Napoli said a
repurchased loan has typically lost 15 percent to 20 percent of its value.

New Century made two accounting mistakes: It didn't assume more investors would
sell back loans, even as loan repurchases surged throughout 2006 amid payment
defaults. And, New Century didn't assume the repurchased loans would be less
valuable.

Many analysts think the subprime mortgage market is in trouble. During the
housing boom, a number of mortgage banks lent money to home buyers who couldn't
afford the loans. Now, with the housing market sagging, more borrowers are
missing payments and many lenders are going out of business or putting
themselves up for sale.

New Century said it needs to set aside money anticipating more loan
repurchases, reflecting the lower value of those repurchased loans. The lender
also said new loans this year will fall 20 percent as the company becomes more
selective about which borrowers it lends to.

Three analysts downgraded New Century's stock. Friedman Billings Ramsey analyst
Scott Valentin ratcheted the shares down to "Underperform" from "Market
Perform." Jefferies analyst Richard Shane Jr. cut the stock to "Hold" from
"Buy," and Merrill Lynch analyst Kenneth Bruce downgraded the stock to "Sell"
from "Neutral."

Shares of New Century Financial plummeted $8.31, or 27.5 percent, to $21.85 in
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Yes, CAT debt seems high - in absolute terms (34Billion?) and in relative terms
(compared to past years).

OTOH the company seems to be doing good things (so far) with that debt. ROA is
up, as are margins (so far).

The stock already has moved up over the past few years. So I have to worry if
it's not already too late to be a buyer. I'm confident that CAT will get a good
share of the global construction/mining business. (I'm hoping that those
cyclical businesses are not now seeing reduced demand.)
In the 1970-1980's I - like many or most others - was not so confident about
CAT's prospects. With the ascendency of Japan, Inc. it was widely
believed/reported then that Komatsu would decimate CAT, just as Japanese
manufacturing techniques were enabling Japanese auto makers to pound Detroit.
That has not happened: CAT dominates still.

=============
Always a puzzle to me how some stocks in a sector behave when the market and
the stocks in a sector move up. Sometimes it's the market share leader that
sees the max stock price gain, sometimes the most leveraged, sometimes the most
downtrodden. I've been selling some TEX (an "inferior" company to CAT, imo)
over $60. That's about a triple since mentioned here, and beats CAT's stock
price rise. OTOH, I'm one who's totally missed the great rise in JLG, another

Paul , here is a good article showing the pressure on componenet suppliers even
in the all mighty dsp industry.

Motorola, Nokia shaking up their chip suppliers
Marketwatch - February 09, 2007 11:43 AM ET

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) - The world's top cell phone makers, locked in
fierce competition for new customers, are shuffling their chip suppliers.

Nokia Corp. and Motorola Inc. have struck new agreements in recent weeks as
they look to cut production costs and cram more features into their handsets.
Also changing the supply dynamic is the push by handset makers to capture more
market share of low-end phones sold in China, India, and Brazil.

The moves signal that the phone giants aren't afraid to step on the toes of
their suppliers, even those with whom they've had longstanding relationships.

"They'll shop around. If they can buy a chip for three cents cheaper, they
switch in mid-production of a phone if they can," said Allen Nogee, principal
analyst at In-Stat, a technology market researcher. "They want flexibility."

The trend is putting more pressure on all suppliers, including giants like
Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN), Freescale Semiconductor Inc., and Qualcomm Inc.
(QCOM) But it's been especially tough on smaller competitors.

On Thursday, small-fry Silicon Laboratories Inc. (SLAB) bowed out of the race.
It agreed to sell its phone-chip business to NXP Semiconductors for $285
million. Silicon Labs had a single-chip phone product but had yet to score any
design wins with top-level phone makers.

More supply agreements may come next week, when the wireless industry holds its
annual mega-conference, known as 3GSM, in Barcelona. All the major phone
vendors and chip makers plan to be there.

'Musical chairs'

"It's musical chairs," said market researcher Will Strauss of Forward Concepts,
speaking to the latest flurry of announcements. "You just can't watch this game
without a program."

The latest round of changes started on Jan. 29, when Motorola expanded its
chip-supply agreement with TI. While no shipment figures were disclosed, the
pact ranges from existing low-end models to newer high-end phones set for
release in 2008.

The deal further wedges TI into Motorola's phone business, now mostly dominated
by Freescale Semiconductor Inc. Freescale, which was taken private last year in
a $17.6 billion private-equity buyout, currently supplies roughly 55% of the
silicon in Motorola phones, such as the Razr, Slvr and Krzr devices.

In another move this week, Nokia tapped Infineon to provide a single-chip
product for its entry-level phones, a setback for TI. The deal marks the first
time Infineon will sell a baseband processor - the central brain of a phone --
to Nokia. See full story.

TI had been the sole source of baseband chips for Nokia (NOK). Infineon
currently supplies radio frequency chips to the Finnish company.

On Thursday, Motorola (MOT) also renewed its commitment to Freescale, selecting
the semiconductor maker as a "preferred supplier" of current and future chipset
platforms through 2009.

Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore said more deals like those are likely, in
part because phone-chip architecture is becoming more complex.

Multi-source arrangements with suppliers are "the way of the future, especially
as semiconductor vendors introduce more single-chip architecture," Seymore
wrote in a recent research note.

Razor-thin margins

When it comes to low-end phones, which are growing faster than sales of
high-end models, handset manufacturers are working with razor-thin profit
margins. Bare-bones phones, sold in China, India, and Brazil, sell for around
$30 to $50 a pop.

This has elevated the design competition among TI, Freescale,
STMicroelectronics and Qualcomm Inc., which are challenged with integrating
several features on a single chip - while also lowering costs.

For TI, the world's largest phone-chip maker, some analysts think the good news
at Motorola will be offset by the bad news at Nokia.

Still, Cody Acree, analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, wonders if TI is losing its grip
at Nokia, its biggest customer. Nokia, in a related move, selected STMicro to
offer an applications processor for a few of its phone models. That deal also
came at the expense of TI, Acree said.

"A major shift in supply mentality can be seen at Nokia, which likely expands
in the future and puts further competitive pressure on TI," wrote Acree, who
rates the stock a hold.

PNRA falls into the category for me that Buffett calls "errors of omission".
I've been following it for years, and almost pulled the trigger during the
Atkins' panic, but the stock didn't quite get down far enough for me to
consider it a good value. I've decided since then that I underestimated the
strength of their model (duh!). Right now they are close to a buy for me and
I'm watching them closely.

As to whether they can continue to grow at their historical rate, that's always
the question with stocks like this. They currently have 1,027 bakery-cafes.
They opened 155 in 2006 and plan to open 170-180 in 2007. IMO they can get to
double their current system wide total of bakery-cafes without breathing hard.
They are estimating comp sales in the 2-4% range for the year and earnings
growth in the percentage range of the low to mid 20's. Those numbers look
plenty robust to me.

This one has the potential to be as powerful a national brand as McDonalds or
Starbucks. It's possible that in retrospect this will turn out to be one of
those stocks that was a bargain at any price. I'm still kicking myself for not
buying when I had a good opportunity.

Julius Wong,

Thanks for telling the board about Consuelo Mack's WEALTHTRACK television show.
I watched the show featuring David Dreman, Julie Fox Gorte, and Jason Trennert
using the new video on demand feature. They came down on all sides of the
socially responsible investment question, and I learned from each manager's
insight. Especially Dreman - I bought 2 of his books. Both Dreman and Gorte are
good sports and expansive speakers.

I really enjoyed the show and its format with Mack asking questions and keeping
the show lively. There were informative graphics of some stock indexes and
featured stocks. It's professionalism and cool, kind of reminds me of the old
Rukeyser show. There is a link that will show you when and if the show airs in
your area.

Thanks again.

They are expanding and have even put a store in Boone NC... which is really
small potatoes compared to Sarasota where there is just one down the street
from me. Always busy. Never a let up. The food is good and it's stand at the
counter and then carry your own tray to the table..

Might be over priced but CMG is another one that is booming.
I believe it came to market at 41.00 a share..and look at it now.

I eat at both places and Outback. They all are good.

RAIL

Makers & Breakers
Riding the Rails
Tatiana Serafin 02.26.07
Rail freight growth is moving faster than Casey Jones' last ride. Rail
container maker Freightcar America (nasdaq: RAIL - news - people )( 59, RAIL)
has responded by ramping up production 39% last year. It's increasing the
number of cars built at low-cost factories, says UBS analyst Jason Feldman.
Large customers include Norfolk Southern (nyse: NSC - news - people ).
FreightCar doubled earnings to $95 million for the first nine months of 2006.
With a P/E of 6, FreightCar trades at well below its competitors, American
Railcar Industries (21) and Trinity Industries (nyse: TRN - news - people )
(13).

Here is an recent Associated Press (AP) article on last year's earnings for
FreightCar America, RAIL, along with my thoughts. I am a holder of RAIL and I
am puzzled by the markets luke warm reaction to RAIL's exploding earnings.

From a value investors point of view RAIL is a great stock with growing
earnings and low p/e, price/book value, price/cash flow, and price/sales
ratios. RAIL's drawback is its in a cyclical business and the investing public
does not realize how long this replacement cycle will last. I believe much
longer then prior replacement cycles. And many on Wall Street have no idea of
how to value a RAIL with its lumpy yet unseasonal revenue and earnings stream.
Just keep in mind year 2005 earnings were $4 followed by year 2006 earnings of
$10 and the stock costs only %52.95. Go figure

LUV received a Bear upgrade today, thus the runup.
I am somewhat a Southwest junkie for travel, so I think I have a decent feel
for pricing. IMHO prices are inching up and holding. They may be more than just
inching up in the FLA market, where I'm travelling in the near future. Another
indicator may be the dearth of DING! deals. DING! is the Southwest desk top
application which offers short term deals on routes which have soft bookings.
The offers are sparse, to put it mildly, much less generous than a year ago.
May be an indication of greater pricing power.

Thanks Wallace,

I sold LUV today for a small loss. I look at the stock as more of a trading
vehicle, so I'll review the stock at lower levels.

Also sold the rest of IMOS for a 1.5 gain.

Last week I purchased MNDO, a stock mentioned here by Mcsweet. Below is a dated
but good review of the stock.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=22224376&srchtxt=mndo

The question of their cash reserves has been resolved.
http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/061206/0192088.html

So you have a company with 37 million in cash, no debt, a price to book of 1.2
and a market cap of 57 million dollars. The company has recently signed some
new clients, so my hope is that the revenue growth will start to improve. In
some ways, MNDO is an telephony play on the improved wealth factor in emerging
markets. BTW, the company, in the past, has paid a dividend.

Quick update: I've taken profits in both ANF and CRYP near recent highs. I'll
look to get back in either on a substantial pullback. Still holding VPHM, USG,
ASPV and CAKE - CAKE's the only one down. I think they are all still good
values though I've lightened up on VPHM. Never did buy OC or AWI yet. Recently
took a small position in NFI - seems like a lot of bad news is already priced
in. Also holding big pharmas PFE, MRK, and ABT and looking at SYMC and LUV.

_________________________
I added a little more ANF a couple days ago also. Plus I doubled my position in
VPHM before the last earnings. I think CRYP, USG, and ASPV are all solid values
here. I think CAKE is a strong candidate for a private equity deal (not that
I'm qualified to assess that). I'm considering OC & AWI for new positions.

Maybe all the bad news is done.
Always a possible takeover for somebody wanting access to NYC housing market.

OTOH, as reported in media and also discussed here, earnings will need to

Paul, I am intrigued by Novastar Financial, NFI, the sub-prime lender. Trades
around 16, down from 50 a couple of years ago, and down from 30 a couple of
months ago!

All of the wall street buzz, the hand-wringing about housing, and the panic
talk in the sector looks like it may be at a peak.

And maybe the stock near or at a bottom. Even given major cuts in the dividend
and write-offs on their mortgages.

PSEC. This company looks appealing. But I don't really like their structure.
Let me know if I have it right...

They are managed like a hedge fund, in that they have advisory fees. They pay
themselves 2% of assets plus incentive fees which can get pretty steep. Check
the last 10K. I did not see any salaries in the proxy, so maybe the "employees"
are all paid as advisors???. The outside directors get $70,000 per year. I'll
take that job. DO I have to attend 4 meeting per year?

Anyway, just a quick look on my part. I like the business but I do not like a
structure that can give exceptional paychecks to the officers. I have to dig
too deep to see if I am being ripped off.

In situations like these its very difficult to know where the bottom is until
unless you are an insideder and have access to their books and records. Once
entities start restating numbers I like to sit and wait. Also bear in mind that
this may just be the beginning of the portfolio repurchasing process. No one
knows where it ends. You are buying a pig in a poke here.

re PSEC I too spent quite a bit of time reviewing the 10K. reminded me a little
bit of edv. 2% mgmt fee, but then they have some weird formula and they glom
100% of some of the fee beyond a certain hurdle rate and then it drops back to
20% of everything beyond that upper limit hurdle rate. Looking at the history
of share prices vis a vis net asset values. Im interested in the company but
would like to buy it at discount to NAV. Especially because the they are making
riskier investments than treasury bills but get the incentives while the
investors bear the risk. To elaborate- their incentive fee is broken down into
a yield segment and a capital gains segment. the incentive on the capital gains
is reduced by the capital losses. Thus they could have a whole slew of
investments going back yet still earn a nice incentive fee on the yield
portion. Oh did I mention that they also incur debt to finance some of their
investments? There is also a husband and wife team in here which is a red flag
for me . Having said that the wifes credentials indicate that she is pretty
sharp, so that may be a plus in this case. Let me know if the discount ever
goes to 15%.

For some PSEC background, you may want to peruse two write-ups on
ValueInvestorsClub.com via guest access:

http://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/value2/guests/index2.asp?select=symbol&textfi
ld=psec

The CEO, John Barry, is binary - people either love him or hate him, with the
latter group being more popular. Last fall, PSEC raised a ruckus when they sent
out a proxy that would allow them to sell shares below NAV. Many investors were
upset that management would let them be diluted. They could not get the vote
and dropped the issue, and then subsequently did a follow-on equity offering.

General rules about investing in BDC's:

1. Never buy the IPO.
2. Buy immature BDC's when they trade below NAV.
3. On mature BDC's, buy when the yield is over 10% (although make sure they are
earning the dividend; MCGC used to do a return of capital).
4. On a mature BDC, sell when the yield is under 8%. However, there is such a
chase for yield that it is distorting things and some are trading in the 7's.

On difference between mature vs. immature, most BDC's take time to invest the
capital and use leverage. BDC's are limited to assets to equity ratio of 200%,
meaning that debt to equity can't exceed 1-1. Most operate BDC's will operate
between 65% and 95% of leverage.

Remember FreightCar America, RAIL, went public on April 6, 2005 at $20.25. It
was very quiet IPO and I did not hear of the company until the summer. And I
did not buy until the fall of 2005.

At the time the earnings were turning around, and America was clamoring for a
cheap, reliable, domestic energy source to counter the high price of imported
oil that was hammering the world energy prices that year. My mind immediately
thought of coal, specifically plentiful, and dependable western US - low
sulphur - coal. The stuff is mined in the Powder River basin of WY and the
western slope of CO, so it has to be transported to the power generating plants
in the eastern US by the railroads. This is where RAIL and its aluminum gondola
railcars comes in. It is no secret the railroads became very profitable early
this decade, and its no secret the railroads had neglected to upgrade their
rolling stock and tracks for many years, but could now afford to upgrade. So
many secular facts favor RAIL's profitability.

And I believe RAIL's price will follow its earnings.

I based my thinking of these prospects and the financial results of RAIL.
FreightCar America has pulled off a magnificent turnaround over the last couple
of years, and is a US success story. Too bad it has not got the attention it
deserves.

Here are the Revenues, Net Income, earns per share for 2003-2006.

I read the write-ups and am still convinced that I would need a margin of
safety here and that margin of safety is a discount to the nav. From what I
have read so far and the way mgmt has structured their incentive, i have no
doubt about mgmt willingness to throw investors under the bus if need be.

jhelmers: Thanks for the post. Very helpful for PSEC background.

I also like your general rules for BDC. They seem apropos to me.

I have considered selling a couple of BDC's as their stock prices have risen
and thus their dividend yields dropping - to below 8%. I didn't do that,
because I figured I'd not get back into the stocks unless the yields rose to
10% which I don't expect to see. (Otoh, there ARE occasional downward spikes
where an alert investor can buy getting a 10% yield). These BDC also raise
their dividends sometimes, so a ltb&h person can sometimes eventually see
dividend yields on purchase price well over 10% (even though at time of
purchase the yield is below 10%). Anyway, I'm paying the price for not selling
as at least a couple of these stocks are correcting now. ACAS for example, down
about $5/sh. in the last few days.

XIDE: "Could you just imagine the patience, fortitude, and conviction of
someone buying the March 2006 dip."

http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=xide&sid=0&o_sy
b=xide&freq=1&time=8

People who bought on the March dip had conviction. That they needed patience
and fortitude, I'm not so sure. Because it looks to me like anybody who bought
in 3/06 was in postive territory by 4/'06. And depending on what their tax
consequences were or are, it maybe even got a little easier hold through 12/31.
And if they were USA citizens in taxable accounts, by 1/07 or maybe 2/07,
there's a reward for staying through the twelve month holding period through
Mar. '06 (and thus serendipitously capturing the Feb. '07 stock price rise).

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=XIDE&t=2y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=

The people with patience, fortitude, and conviction - imo - were the people who
bought the stock not at $2.50/sh. (3/06-4/06), but who bought at $4-5 a share,
had losses (or no gains) and had to hold on from anywere between May of '05
through until almost end of Jan '07 to finally see a profit. That was sticking
with a losing or no gain position for as long as 18 months while the stock was
basing.

That is, imo it's a heck of a lot easier (or more common) for people to stick
with a stock that's up and maybe moving up, than to stick month/years with a
stock that's a loser and/or losing. jmo.

What you say has some truth. Maybe a better word for buying the March 06 dip
was guts. What I was really getting at is how the stock behaved from June thru
mid November during a time when many stocks were in advance mode in the
indexes. I can imagine holding this thru that period watching everything else
moving, as XIDE went nowhere. A buy near $2.50 would have likely been a flip
out for most at 4 or 5 quickly. I suppose it would have been better stated that
anyone holding this from June thru November had alot of frustration, patience,
and conviction.

ACAS.

>I didn't do that, because I figured I'd not get back into the stocks unless
the yields rose to 10% which I don't expect to see.

I also don't think the price will drop much more -- since it seems to be due to
recent analyst downgrades. It will pass. It may not go up too much either, we
are near fair value, IMO. I think all we can hope for this year is dividend
yield. The cap gain came last year.

I did not want to sell old <$20 (2002) shares and pay taxes. So I sold all my
IRA shares in January, which was around 30%+ of my shares. I did miss the
run-up in late January, and my price was only a bit higher than today's price.

An 8% yield is on the low side of recent history.

Bridge Player, Yes NFI at 16 down from 50 - and down from 30 recently.

OTOH, it's up from 2002. This thing has incurred losses before, and has traded
below book value 1997-1999, and at a lower p/sales than currently. I'm saying
it wouldn't surprise me to see NFI stock drop even further.

The dividend isn't offering up much protection now (i.e. the stock keeps
dropping), and the div. may not in future. Issue of whether the dividends will
be reduced. I don't have a clue. I'm with Madharry: I can't scope the situation
in NFI or NEW or their environment. So not worth a bet to me. Jmo, and I've
been wrong many, many times.

----

I am holding AHM, NCT, RSO, maybe a couple of other reits that have more
sub-prime loans that I should be alert to but am not.
AHM's been profitable every year in past ten. NCT looks profitable in each of
past seven years. Big deal, harrumph. When they go sour, maybe they all go
sour. AHM, NCT may or may not be as exposed to a possible sub-prime debacle as
NEW,NFI. I need to look closer here.

Here's a different take on RAIL from seekingalpha:

http://transport.seekingalpha.com/article/23748

Disclosure: I own a little bit of RAIL as part of my MFI ("Magic Formula")
holdings, but as of yet I haven't formed my own opinion on the company. I will
say I'm not sure the backlog drop is as serious as the author seems to think,
given the obvious historical lumpiness of that number - especially when it is
still up so dramatically from 3-4 years ago. Also, the hiring of the new CEO
could be a key catalyst.

RAIL may go into the "too hard" pile for me, but it's an interesting company.
