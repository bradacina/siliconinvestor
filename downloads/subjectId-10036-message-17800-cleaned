Someone was asking about a chart showing insider buying & selling ratios & so
forth.

Its not very comprehensive but it does show how insider buying has fallen off a
cliff recently.

The VICKERS INSIDER INDEX rates each company's insider transactions for the
past six months, taking into account several factors that are weighted
according to relative importance. These factors include:
The number of buy and sell transactions recorded for each company,
The percentage change that occurs in an insider's holdings with each purchase
or sale,
Unanimity among a given company's insiders (all buys or all sells),
The dollar value of the transactions (those involving $250,000 or more are
given added weight),
Reversals in insiders buying patterns, i.e., a change from buying to selling or
vice versa.
A HIGH "PLUS" VALUE DENOTES RELATIVELY HEAVY INSIDER BUYING; A HIGH "MINUS"
VALUE GENERALLY REFLECTS HEAVY INSIDER SELLING.

*Based on all stocks reporting transactions over the last 6 months.

**A ratio of 2.25 is considered "neutral". Under 2.25 suggests a rising market;
More than 2.25 a weakening market.

Watching insiders for clues
Executives have not been buying into the recovery, reports show. Investors
wonder what that means.
By Wendy Tanaka
Inquirer Staff Writer

Despite signs of an economic recovery, a bear market could return if corporate
insider buying of stocks continues to be anemic, according to reports released
last month from Thomson Financial.

From May through July, executives, directors and other insiders in corporations
sold far more of their companies' shares than they purchased, which could
suggest that stock prices are too high, an author of the reports said.

Some investors closely watch the buying and selling of shares by company
insiders, who include management and those who own at least 10 percent of a
company's shares. Such insider transactions occur every day and are legal,
unlike the sales of ImClone Systems Inc. stock that landed former chief
executive officer Samuel Waksal in jail. The Securities and Exchange Commission
has specific rules for insiders on when they can sell shares preceding or
following announcements of earnings or other significant company news.

The reason some people follow purchases and sales by insiders is that the
insiders are often perceived as having the best information about a company's
financial health. In theory, executives who buy company shares signal that they
believe the stock will go higher.

Given that the stock market has risen substantially since March and that there
have been indications the U.S. economy is improving, many investors wonder
whether stocks will hold their gains for the rest of the year. No one can
predict the direction of the stock market with certainty, but that doesn't stop
investors from looking for clues in all sorts of analyses, including 200-day
moving averages of stock prices, or from following trends in insider trading.

Kevin Schwenger, an analyst at Thomson Financial, a financial research firm in
New York, said the insider-trading trends were clear: "Everyone's talking about
an economic recovery, but executives aren't putting their money on the table
and backing it up."

Thomson researchers crunch all of the insider purchases and sales during a
month. From the data, the company calculates a ratio between the value of
stocks sold and purchased by insiders, and considers that figure an indicator
of the market's status. A sell-buy ratio of 20-to-1, or 20 times more selling
than buying, straddles the line between a bull and bear market.

Since May, the sell-buy ratio has been above 20. In July, it averaged 32.21 -
the highest since May 2001 when it was 40.90.

Thomson Financial said the May-through-July period is the second time in a
decade that the sell-buy ratio exceeded 20 for three consecutive months. The
other period in which this occurred was July through September 2000. In the six
and 12 months that followed, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index declined 19
percent and 27 percent, respectively, representing the market's worst one-year
return in a decade.

"In the past decade, there were only 15 months when the ratio was above 20,"
Schwenger said.

"On average, the S&P 500 has gone down 10 of those 15 times. So there's
definitely a correlation between that ratio and the market."

Schwenger speculated that insiders may not be buying right now because they are
waiting for the stock prices of their companies to go down.

"Insiders want to buy as low as they can, and sell as high as they can," he
said. "Perhaps it's a sign of a lot of [insiders] still thinking their [company
stock] valuations are a little high for themselves to be buying. They would
never admit that."

Re: HELE, the only thing I see is the headline, "HELE under pressure after
top-line disappoints, and EPS aided by lower tax rate."

Interesting timing, since yesterday was the start of my stock contest I'm
organizing for friends and family in order to help some beginners (some parents
and kids) learn about picking stocks. (Rules: just for fun, although I'm
interested in using real money for some picks; up to 5 stocks; hold for 6
months; no trading; emphasis on diversity.) Being a 6 month period, I found
myself thinking more aggressively and borrowed some ideas from Dale's 50%
thread.

My first portfolio, which is now off to a bad start: HELE, IMDC, WLS, STHLY,
ARO.

Second portfolio: PLMD, QSII, UTSI, MSSN, MAXF

Other picks from friends and family:

DELL, MCD, WM, BOBJ

SWY, NOK, AMD, SUNW

COST, FO, ANF, C, AMZN

VZ, ABS, GE, YUM, GTW

LNCR, SSL, CVH, TGT, MSFT

ABS, PCL, BAC, SBUX, NNBP(!)

PETC, PDCO, SONC, GGP, LCUT

Obviously, this is an eclectic and interesting bunch of stocks. In these picks
I see big and small, well known and obscure, value and growth, stable and
speculative. Perhaps it is representative of how "amatuers" invest?!! Of
course, I'd like to think I have a leg up on these friends and teenagers, but
who knows what will "win."

Comments or predictions are welcomed and encouraged.

Some nice stocks there. Pity that that many were not able to be chosen when
they were first mentioned here - when several of them were at much lower
prices. (OTOH, maybe they were bought then and contestants still like them.)

Very sorry I didn't step up to WLS anywhere or anytime during its great run.
After watching it for a short time @ $14, it quickly scooted to $20, where it
seemed to me I missed it. I missed it all right - only because I failed to step
up and buy anytime and anywhere during its subsequent continuing run. Now at
$50.75 and with p/e of about 9 according to Yahoo, there may STILL be money to
be made with a purchase. My failure here has caused me to look at other small
publicly-traded Southern California homebuilders, BHS being one.

Also sorry I didn't buy GTW when I mulled it over here. It was then a no-debt,
below-cash play. (Cash now $3.61/sh with stock at $5.75.)

Surprised to see grocery chains SWY and ABS on a list. Some of your
friends/family must be talking to each other about this sector. I wouldn't have
expected teenagers who might(?)be involved in these selections to pick such
mundane businesses. I would've guessed maybe ANF or something tech that's more
hip/in. (I'm still holding my positions SWY, KR, and ABS.)

Many of the stocks on the lists are selling near or at highs. For me then, it's
hard to justify a buy on those. Ones that might work for me are WM (which I
recently have added to) or SUNW which has cratered yet again, and so might be
interesting from a contrary perspective. I see some other stocks on the list
which I have - I consider those holds at this time.

STRZ: Asset value's stake dropped from 8.47% in July to 5.76% as Hummingbird's
stake has risen so it appears one well informed seller is distributing his
stake to a more optimistic buyer. Perhaps Asset value's patience, like ours, is
wearing thin.
I probably sold too soon given the Hummingbird catalyst, but this is a 'sell

My positions aren't big enough to require a lot of liquidity, but since my STRZ
experience, I'm walking away from stocks that 'trade by appointment,' that is
where average volume isn't at least 10x my expected position and spreads rarely

Tips on cash management?

Given the current environment, I'm holding pretty high levels of cash.
Brokerages seem to be paying interest in the 0.5% range; on-the-run 90-day
treasurys are about the same.

Meanwhile, FDIC-insured bank accounts are returning upwards of 2% if you look
in the right place (www.bankrate.com is where I'm looking). Problem there is
you have to split your money into $100k chunks to make sure you're safe.

Does anyone know of any vehicle that allows getting that kind of return safely
without splitting up your capital into little chunks? I'm assuming that the way
banks are even able to offer those kinds of returns it that they're taking some
risk and passing it off onto the FDIC -- i.e. the FDIC insurance creates a
market inefficiency.

It goes without saying that I'm not interested in any vehicle where there can
be principal depreciation (i.e. long bonds, preferreds, GNMAs, dividend
payers).

You are looking for return without risk; the market isn't structured that way,
otherwise all the big money would look for the risk-free high returns and make
them impossible to provide.

Why not put together a basket of investment grade bonds and enjoy a 4-5% yield?
Or add a small amount of risk and double that?

Diversification can go a long way to compensate for small credit risk.

I have followed FSS for several years, getting in and out while enjoying a 5%
dividend. It is sitting right at my usual entry point of 15 right now. Very
much dependent on whether the economy recovers because FSS relies strongly on
state and municipal purchases of their equipment. Right now all governments are
hemorrhaging pretty badly, as reflected in FSS recent downward sales
projection. But I think I'll at least pick up a one-third position.

My opinion:

ABM - good co. with good record. To expensive for a buy at this time, imo. (But
in past, I've been wrong on this stock in holding to that opinion. As well, I
bought competitor CLHL but sold too soon.

CSG - (I presume Cadburry, not CSG Systems). I've been buying at higher and
lower prices. Seems like the stock has danced around $25 for years:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=CSG&t=5y

Because of this (low beta), and although profit margins have improved over the
past few years, I'm not expecting much from the stock. Maybe a 20% gain within
18 months plus dividends with some safety/stability as regards the business
(confectionary/beverage diversity and large international presence).

I'm with Paul K. Blakely regarding FSS. Have bought at current level before. My
buy-in now would be a point or more lower that Paul's $15. Although in waiting
last time, I missed the move to over 20. I guess everyone expects stock to
recover when municipalities increase their purchases, but that hasn't happened
for several years now (it seems to me), and I don't see increased purchases on
the horizon. Eventually, equipment will have to be replaced, and so the stock
could quickly yet again rise over $20 as stock buyers anticipate better times.
I'm going to stay on sidelines for now.

Just my opinions, and I've been wrong many, many times.

Mike, in my opinion, the suggestion to buy long term bonds is hardly risk free.

As far as what you have noted goes, I do not think it is really the FDIC
causing this. The banks are borrowing short and lending long and giving you a
rate in between. If short term rates were to rise a ton, you would find that
the rate you got would not keep up as the banks moved to protect their spread.
However, with the yield curve sloped the way it is now, this is low risk for
them. (The risk is that if short rates went up too much and they did not
follow, you would take the money elsewhere and they might have to sell long
term loans at a loss to pay you.) The FDIC protects you against this risk.

You might be able to sock more money away than you think in these kind of
accounts. In a joint account the limit might be $200,000. Also look into
www.ingdirect.com for another avenue to link a 2% savings account to your
checking account. If I am right on the $200,000, setting up a base checking
account plus ING would give you $400,000 in one fell swoop. Finally, some of
these high-yield checking accounts are in really sound banks, where you
wouldn't lose any sleep over going over the FDIC limit.

Re: Investment grade bonds

Dale said: Why not put together a basket of investment grade bonds and enjoy a

The concern I have is not credit risk but interest rate risk. If I purchase
fixed-income securities of any kind that have maturities longer than a year or
so, I'm likely either to have principal depreciation when rates rise or to be
stuck holding the bonds when I would rather move my money back into other asset
classes.

Jeff: I'll look into the suggestion on getting the FDIC limit up higher. It
seems to me that borrowing short and lending long could be a significant risk
in the current frothy rate environment. All things considered, I'd rather avoid
taking any risk, even if it requires a little more legwork on my part.

I'm somewhat surprised that no bank has set up a way of syndicating savings
accounts so you can spread your money around using a single vehicle.

Re: Investment grade bonds

If you are worried about interest rate risk, but not credit risk, buy a senior
loan/floating rate mutual fund. Yields are not bad and duration is extremely
low, since the yields fluctuate with changes in interest rates.

FFRHX is an example of an open end with a 2.67% yield. (Not a top
recommendation, just one I know since my broker is Fidelity.)

There are also senior loan closed-end funds with higher yields, but they
utilize leverage and result in premium/discount risk to your principal.

In any event, with a bank like ING, how much risk is there really that they are
going to go belly up before you could take your money out ?

I mean, if you were that worried, make a mental note of INGs stock price and if
it drops say 15-20% then take your money out.

I have a hard time believing that $40 billion in marketcap is going to go
"poof" before you can yank your savings out.

So yes, while its technically not risk free, there is also a chance you get hit

FSS operating margins have decreased every year from 12.4% in 1993 to 7.8% in
2002. Off the cliff in the last two years for sure. In 2001 and 2002 operating
margins were hard hit by the recession and tighter budgets. But working capital
is at all time high levels (No place to invest?)

Looks like sales have flat lined at about 1.1B for the last 3 years but that
level was the highest in their history. During the last 5 years the board has
increased dividends each year.
Looks like new business and backlog in 2002 is record high levels. A lot of
short term debt has been replaced by long term debt so they are more highly
leveraged.

Unlike the federal government, state governments can't run a deficit, they have
to balance their budgets. So IF the economies improve, FSS's cyclical business
is likely to increase. Even if the dividend is cut to yield 2 to 3%, is it more
likely that this company deserves a multiple of 10 rather than its trailing 12
month P/E of 16.67, which looks RELATIVELY reasonable? With the lousy economic
conditions of the past two years, they still managed a return on equity of
12.1% and 13.3%, down from higher teens and +20% returns in prior years.

But you read these statements better than I do, James. I would be interested in

However analyst estimate (5-7M$) were lowballed and below the run rate of the

the stock again at lower prices, as the story is still intact.

TVIN looks like a risky bet to me, but at current prices I take the odds at
1.12$. Very low liquidity and while business has been on the romp order flow
may be erratic in the future. But PE seems to be about 8 and this seems very
cheap.

I looked at ABC and while I like the valuation, i think there is too much
headline risk due to FBI investigation. I also suspect margin pressure because
the pharma companies get more careful about discounts to wholesalers to push
drugs into the distribution system. I'll watch this one and see what happens, I

Wallace Rivers, re: DRD, I'm one who does believe DRD is worth more than its
current quotation. If some of the economic issues facing NY and NYC are
resolved or muted (i.e. if the economy should recover), DRD stock price will
rebound from current price. Imo of course, and I've been wrong many, many
times.

Of the two, CVC vs. DRD, CVC was the one to buy, it seems (sorry I didn't):

At this point (CVC up, DRD down), I have added a little to my DRD position
today. I am considering whether I want to up the position even further. I like
DRD's strong niche market, their presumed (well, I'm presuming it) ability to
hold out until better times, and their historic good margins in non-pharmacy

Building a small position in thinly-traded MAX.

Company provides "a broad range of services to the aviation industry. The
Group's operating units include fuel sales and services, cargo operations,
fixed base operations (FBO), government contract services."

http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/profile.asp?symb=MAX&vc=0&siteid=mktw&d
st=dropmenu

The company is losing money and has a fairly high d/e ratio.

Stock sells for below what had been (until recently anyway) a steadily-rising
stated book value. With a psr now of just .05 there should be opportunities for
management to improve operations, return to profits, and see psr numbers closer
to the norms of the past few years (.1-.2)

This company competes with World Fuel (INT), a company I've mentioned here many
times over the past few years. (INT is the company I often contrasted as an
alternative to buying QCOM when QCOM was at its highs.) I don't expect MAX to
be a repeat performance of INT (although that would be nice). I'd say INT is a
little too expensive now for a value stock buy.

MAX might turn out to be an okay revision-to-mean stock. I'll just bet the
$6.75/sh stock might trade once again above its stated $10.15 book value, maybe
sometime within the next 18 months.

Jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times.

Toyota just keeps coming on stronger and stronger in terms of car sales... and
truck sales. If the Japanese, or others can knock off more truck sales --- as
they seem to be trying to do --- they will hurt the Big Three who now depend
heavily on truck sales for their profits. In terms of how to play Toyota,
someone here might have a good opinion. Doesn't Marty Whitman have in his fund
some company (Toyoda??) which owns a ton of Toyota shares?

For me, the time to buy seems to have passed. That was in April when Toyota &
Honda (and Sony) were at lows and were discussed. Sorry I couldn't see it
enough to buy. I'm stuck in my old paradigm wherein I still sometimes get
concerned Japanese companies are run for the benefit of Japan rather than for
the benefit of stockholders. (I don't imply that that direction is bad, just
that needs of country/community/employees are considered more important
oftentimes (?) than making structural changes (layoffs/plant closures) to meet
Wall Street's desires.) OTOH, no denying Toyota, et. al. are profitable,
dynamic, hungry and aggressive competitors with many people worldwide willing
to buy their stocks. (Sorry I sold NSANY couple years ago at ~$11 as its
turnaround under Mssr.Ghosn started.)

ALVR to $8+, new 52-week high.

This is the market share leader in Broadband Wireless - one of the fastest
growing tech sector. I recommended it early this year at $1.86, and multiple
times later on this thread (see previous posts below)

I believe ALVR is likely to be taken out by CSCO, JNPR or the like. This sector
has huge growth potential in next 5 years and CSCO will want to get into it.
Acquiring ALVR is probably the best choice given the small marketcap of ALVR,
otherwise CSCO would have to buy a smaller competitor and play the tough catch
up game on ALVR, and a competitor (INTC, JNPR or the like) may come to buy ALVR
and undercut Cisco's effort to become the leader.

I do hope ALVR get to at least $15 before someone showing the interest, then
the buyout price would be $20 or more. I would hold all my shares purchased
under $2, sell $100K per year for the next 10 years to avoid paying too much
tax in one year.

Below are my previous posts recommending ALVR.

Message #17683 from Steve168 at Sep 9, 2003 10:09 PM

ALVR received $23M order today, up 10% to $6.7.
A below cash value stock I recommended here in Feb 2003 at $1.86, is turning
into a growth star in a new booming sector. I am still holding a large position
and I think it still have upside to go. Citicorp, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan
Chase were new institution buyers in last quarter filing. They could have
bought under $2 had they hired me as an analyst or trader :-). I am looking for
such a job.

MrCJ, thank you for your nice comment. My largest holding is ALVR now, trading
at 1.86 while cash at 3.14, book 4.36, and zero debt. Losing about 10c/Q, not
too bad, it is a leader in a niche market of Broadband Wireless Access. I
believe the company has a chance to be profitable in the next 12-18 months.
When that happened, it should be at $3-5.

Mikeslemmer, I did not say ALVR is still a value stock at $8. It was a value
stock when I bought under $2 while having over $3 in cash with no debt.

My point is to discuss the hold/sell strategy for a value stock. I modified the
traditional "sell when a deeply undervalued stock reaches fair value" approach
because I found I sold many stocks way early, before they doubled or even made
a 10x move. I had 3000 shares of EMC in 1993, it would made me ONE million
dollars if I hold thru 1999.

I did hold PHTN from $3 to $70, and SINA from $1.5 to $41 (still hold shares
now) after learning that EMC lesson. I am holding ALVR now because it is
growing fast.

Re: ALVR

Selling routines are always difficult to figure, but there is statistical
evidence which argues against your approach. For instance, in David Dreman's
books on contrarian investing, statistical models which purchased low P/BV and
P/E stocks and held them long term did somewhat worse than those which rotated
when P/BV and P/E reached industry or market average levels.

PHTN and SINA are examples where the former strategy works, but there are just
as many examples where investors have taken round trips. In fact, according to
Dreman, the round trip is statistically the more likely scenario.

Personally, I have no feel for how the market will price a company once it has
exceeded intrinsic value. So, I prefer to keep my chips on the side of the
table where the statistics favor me.

RTWI--Wonder why American Physician decided not to acquire RTW in late 2001

My guess is that they took a deeper look at the financials and ran screaming
for the exits. The founder had retired and the then current CEO had decided to
expand operations into many states and the company was bleeding badly under his
watch. Right after American Physicians backed out of the deal, the founder of
the company pulled off a palace coup and returned to try to get the RTW ship
back on course. Since that time, RTW has stopped expansion, closed offices in
several states, engaged in risk mitigation through reinsurance, and performed
whatever internal surgeries they felt they needed to to get back on track.

You are oh so correct to point out that there may be flies in the ointment.
While the cash flow may be sporadic, it appears that it has moved from negative
in 2000 and 2001 to positive in 2002 and the last 4Q ended 6/03.

One of the reasons (as I understand it) that this company started its big price
decline after 1997 was changes in the WC laws. Those changes apparently limited
the amounts that could be charged while increasing (I think) the amount of
coverage that needed to be provided. So your comment that WC changes can impact
companies in the market appears to be right on point here as well.

Still and all.....looks like a value play to me. Hope I'm right, I took a small
position this week to "try it on for size". I seem to watch these issues more
closely when I have real dollars at stake.

I agree that statistically holding the low P/BV stocks long term (after reach

That list of yours, TimbaBear, turned out to have a decent number of good
performers. The multi-baggers seem to have outweighed the few stocks that went
nowhere or down during the approx. two year period since the posting. (Based on
a cursory look at Yahoo 2-yr. charts)

I looked at all those stocks back then that you mentioned, and missed every
one. Oops. DECK, for example, comes to mind since I've wrongly passed over it
it a number of times (during its run from about 5 down to about 3 and back up
through 13) whenever I've re-looked at the shoe stocks I do own. MUEL was a
value stock that didn't seem to be going anywhere; now it's up to all time
highs.

A couple of the stocks look to me like they still might be profitable holdings
going forward. I just wonder if I would have had the sense or grits to hold on
to Oxford Clothes from its run from near 20 to near 70. (That stock doesn't
look particularly over-priced to me: maybe it's still buyable (?))

What seems to have been required if one purchased the list of stocks was a
decent amount of patience. (Several stocks really blossomed since May '03). I
would've wanted the gainers to gain more than the losers lost (I would have
assumed a couple of do-nothing stocks), so the best bet, imo, would have been
to have bought (and held) all the stocks on that list.

I do like occasionally reviewing old posts of stocks mentioned here. I always
find many good opportunities that people mentioned here that I didn't recognize
at the time and which surprise me in seeing how well they've worked out. Some
stock picks seem so obvious in hindsight.

And for some of my own picks, I see how I overlooked facts or situations that
subsequently got me in trouble. Of course, given that I've posted on so many
stocks relating to my VERY diversified portfolio, you'd expect me to get a few
right, and it's gratifying to see those turn out just as I hoped they might

I looked at all those stocks back then that you mentioned, and missed every
one. Oops.

Well, I did buy a few of those and made some money overall. I own none of them
now and missed the lion's share of the biggest up moves. For me, it was a
combination of not having faith in my methodology (which, in part, was
justified) and not being mature enough in my thinking, and being very gun-shy
after having come out of 2000 as badly battered as I was.

I have improved upon my methodology and have a lot more confidence in it; have
evolved a bit more in my investment patience; and have nicely surpassed the
1999 highs in my portfolio values which has done wonders for helping me grow
past the "gun-shy-ness". I am trading far less and insisting on more margin of
safety on entry. Interestingly, though, I find my exit criteria has become a
bit more fungible on successes. Not because I don't want to sell winners, but
because if the business model is sound and still growing, I don't care as much
about the price outrunning those fundamentals occasionally. TRCI is a case in
point. I still own it, although in the short term, its price is higher in
comparison to its cash flow than I would insist on for a new entry.

And for some of my own picks, I see how I overlooked facts or situations that
subsequently got me in trouble.

Hindsight, when its 20/20 is very valuable to me too. It's amazing how often
though my hindsight is not as clear as I would hope for. In this arena, it does
seem as though all of the lessons are pricey so the hind vision eventually
clears up when the price paid reaches a certain pain threshold. I'm not always
a quick learner it seems.

...and it's gratifying to see those turn out just as I hoped they might when I
posted on them.

Yes it is! It's amazing how quickly my ego takes credit for it too! <ggggg>

Please understand I will not post every move here. This is a free forum and

CTGI seems to be a scrappy little company that, as is typical in this business,
expands by acquisitions. CTGI is positioned okay (I am guessing) in the growth
markets of CA., AZ., and NV, making the company itself a possible acquisition.

I'm looking at it now as being a weighing decision between the environment and
the business. Are the building boom and the refi boom (the environment) winding
down and therefore diminishing expectations for this title company, or can CTGI
control its destiny significantly enough to keep its stock up in spite of this
wind-down (if it is occurring)? I'll just take an exploratory position and try

Correct - for my rollover IRAs. If there's something I can do to mitigate tax
bite, please let me know. When I do buy ADRs for these standard tax-deferred
IRAs, I rationalize that I'm in it for the cap. gain, and the 20% (?) tax or so
taken off a good 5% dividend still leaves an okay div. Also, I assume it's iffy
if I'll still be holding the stock when the div. is paid. (Often that's only
once or twice per year with these foreign payers.)

I keep no ADR div-payers in any Roth accounts. With tax-deferred IRA, US gov't
is my partner, but with Roth, the foreign tax bite is totally mine, as far as I
know.

For ADRs in my taxable accounts, those foreign taxes are offset as tax credits
by my accountant when he does my taxes. (I believe there are some limits,
because if I recall, I'm always rolling ADR tax credits over to future years.)

Madharry, I suffered as you in 2000+. I think you need to do two things - don't
allow a position to become a disproportionate percentage of the total portfolio
AND don't allow it to exceed some dollar limit. Since everything went up in
2000 the first rule wouldn't have saved you. However, the second would have.

Note that I tend to have a concentrated portfolio, where such rules are
meaningful. It would be tougher to do this with 50 or 100 stocks.

Can anyone assist me in advising a teen investor who's just getting started? My
stock contest has resulted in a request from a 15 year old for stock ideas
using real money. I've recommended index funds in the past but he doesn't have
enough to get started (I think his dad will let him start with $1500 or so.)

I thought I would suggest a mix of ETFs since he doesn't have enough for HOLDRs
either. I've never really researched ETFs and after an hour I'm frustrated and
thought I could turn to this group of trusted souls.

I'm not sure of the difference between iShares and StreetTrack and all the
other variations.

Does it matter who issues the iShares? (Goldman Sachs, Dow Jones, S&P, etc.)

I'd hate to see him pick some mo-mo stocks and have them dive. I want him to be
diversified. And I want him to be a kid and not have to spend too much time
studying stocks. So I thought I'd try to get him in 3 different ETFs and leave
room for 1 stock pick, just to get started. So instead of him buying AMD, which
he wants, maybe he would buy a technology ETF, like IYW or IGM. Or maybe I can
get him in a value ETF, a growth ETF, and a foreign ETF. Thoughts?

Anyone have any input on the different value ETFs? Amex.com has a basic screen
that resulted in IJS, IWD, IVE, and IXG.

Or thoughts on a growth ETF? The Vanguard extended market Viper (VXF) has an
interesting name and a good mix of financials, consumer stuff, health, and
tech.

What sites are best to do more research? There ought to be a site where I could
name the style/size/sector I want and see if any ETFs are available!

Thanks.

wak,

What I did with my daughter's IRA a couple of years ago for growth is to buy
HQH a CEF. It is a bio tech health care closed end fund. They pay nice
dividends and it can be reinvested. It is expensive right now, but with the
reinvestments and assume it goes down to the low end of the trading range your
15 year old will be ok over time if things get sold off. The yield on the fund
runs between 14 and 16 percent.

I happen to think this is a great growth area for quite sometime.

Edit, he could hedge this with a gold stock like AU, GFI or HMY. These stocks
pay dividends and the SA folks have been in this business for 200 years - I do
not think they will quit now. <g>

I face the same situation as you regards micro cap stocks that I have that have
appreciated. I've got no good answer as to what to do. I look for exit points,
but nothing is clear. Maybe these stocks are so overvalued or fairly-valued now
that they should be sold en-mass. That doesn't seem quite right either.

You should also check if the funds you plan to buy allow odd lot purchases.
Some indices (SPY? QQQ?) don't - you have to buy at least 100 shares.

No ideas on ETFs, since I've only researched Asia Pasific ETFs, which are too

MIM -
- Commercial real estate company spun out of MECA in September.
- Owns 59% of MECA's common stock with 96% voting power.
- MIM used to acquire the property connected with MECA's acquisitions and lease
it back to MECA. Now it can do business with entities other than MECA.
- Net book value of MIM's real estate is $1.1 Bn. ttm FFO was $72 million. Q1
FFO = $20.6 million. Q2 FFO = $22 million. 9x annualized FFO brings the
valuation to $720 million. MIM's block of MECA is worth approx. $280 million.
Total valuation is about $1billion ie approx. the current market cap.
- Has 106 income producing properties with 100% occupancy and $978 million book
value. All of them are under triple-net leases (tenant pays taxes, maintenance
capex and operating costs).
- MIM operates on a build to suit basis ie it does not begin building until
clients enter into binding contracts. Thus it has low development risk.
- REOC's tend to be about 50% leveraged. MIM's balance sheet can take on
additional leverage. It has considerable growth potential from its real estate
as it takes on more leverage.

i am just curious - how did you treat your investment in faro under those
rules? did you sell off portions as the share increased? I know that in late
1999 i took a chance and purchased an ipo with 10% of my capital. two days
later i sold 300 out of the 1000 shares i owned and recouped my entire initial
investment. in about 60 days the remaining portion got to be 20% of my
portfolio and i got very nervous even though it seemed to be going up daily.
shortly thereafter i sold the entire position as it seemed incredibly
overvalued having appreciated some 500%. After i sold it it quadrupled before
ultimately becoming a penny stock. I have decided to try to keep winners at no
more than
10% of my portfolio going forward, and not to make more than a 6% portfolio
investment. I am not sure though that i want to set absolute dollar numbers
because I think its tough for me to come up with more than 20 good investments
a year unless the market has really fallen apart.

OT- my portfolio appreciation in 2003 has thus far exceeded my expectations. I
am curious as to how you handle some of these unexpected gains- do i let it
ride in my regular portfolio making the same decisions i usually make or do I
take some off the table making more conservative investments, which i can
afford to do because of the extra appreciation. any thoughts?

I have no words of wisdom to share. All I have is what I've done and am doing.
In the late 90s and early 2000, I was caught up in the same mania that the
whole market seemed to be in. I let it affect how I selected what constituted
an "investment" to the point where virtually all of my holdings were really
"highly speculative" with very few good holdings at all. After I got severely
burned twice in 2000, I had to decide on either getting out of the investing
arena or to learn how to become a consistently prudent investor.

The reason I went into all of the above was to set the stage for what I'm about
to say and also to "qualify" as a veteran of hubris.

Many of my current holdings have also run past my anticipated returns when I
bought them. I do expect a correction in the not too distant future as reality
rudely intrudes again. My approach is that if I am wondering how much more I
can milk out of an investment that has already exceeded what I thought was
likely, then I'm selling and going to cash. I might miss some of the upside,
but I'll have all of the profits from my hard work of discovery.

On the other hand, if I still believe that a company that I own has a great
business model for the coming years, then I'm going to hold onto it while
bracing myself for the potential drop in pricing that is likely to occur when
the lowering tide lowers that boat as well.

I'm no Warren Buffett, but I surely can try to understand what I observe of
him. He seems to have an investment side of the business and an opportunistic
side of the business. The investment side he rarely sells and doesn't appear to
ever concern himself with market timing. On the opportunistic side, he buys
bonds when they look cheap and sells them when they look expensive; he seems to
have speculated a bit in other things as well (like silver).

I, too, have found it convenient to break out my investing into those broad
categories. The only speculation on my plate now is S&P Puts (March). All the
other stuff has been either tendered (the last of EBSC at 8) or is under review
(TE up 35% from purchase) or has been sold outright.

On the investing side, I think I can ride out whatever storm may occur this
time as the foundation for selection was bedrock, not "greater fool".

From:Paul Senior
As usual, I will voice a contrary opinion regarding your budding teenage
investor. Totally contrary, I assume -g-.

I don't see it as being about something you want for him. It's about what he
wants for his (er,his Dad's) money. Imo. Is it something to get him started?
What's his timeframe/patience level? Is it to make money quickly? What's he
interested in? What will keep his interest in investing (assuming that might be
a parental goal)? Can he even stick six months with one or two stocks?

I don't know anything about ETF's. They sound dull and boring to me for a
teenager. When the question was asked here a couple of years ago for a teenage
girl about what stock she might buy to get her started and interested, my
suggestion was CAG because of its diverse food products everybody knows about
(coupons in the annual too), the increasing dividend, the chance for stock
appreciation. I believe now that that was the wrong stock. Like watching paint
dry. Too slow for a kid (I am guessing). Same with most value stocks - prosaic,
2nd tier or lower companies that most teens never heard of (I am guessing). I
would bet - given that the kid likes AMD - he wants something with a high
pride/shame ratio - something where he could brag to his friends - where he
wants to maybe know about the company, maybe already knows the products, is hip
to what's going to be introduced to the public. How about others in that venue?
Maybe Harley-Davidson? A car company? Computer company?Adobe? Maybe a company
where his relatives work? A place he goes shopping? ANF, VANS, HD? A movie
studio? Something with a little juice in the stock (good trading range)? Or
maybe he just wants to double his money by the end of the year. There are some
people on this thread with very good success that can give some small-cap
stocks to make a bet on. Or maybe he is special (a patient investor, not
expecting to double his money in two months) - after all, he was smart enough
to ask you for advice - maybe he does want a couple of your value stocks. In
any case, ASK HIM!

As a corollary, my other way-divergent and strong opinion - mentioned here and
elsewhere - is that it's darn difficult for most people, new to the market, to
make money the way the books say you should. (Somewhat like Mr. Buffett's
shrugging his shoulders about how some (many?) people just don't get it about
buying $1 for 50 cents - you see it right away or else maybe never.) Most
people make most money by NOT trading, by NOT playing futures, by NOT margining
up to the hilt, by NOT making big bets on iffy companies with no earnings, etc.
etc. IMO, this can NOT be learned from books or from parents. It just doesn't
sink in. It's only after - through experience (that means losses -g-) - that
one sees the path that is right for himself/herself. (That path may likely
follow (We hope -g-)some of the good specific suggestions of the experienced
posters here.(ie. those who have tread the path.) In any case, the opinion I
hold is that rather than tell or show the kid the best choice that might be
available to him that he should take, I say his own experience must be the
teacher. Therefore let the kid try everything he can and is interested in now,
while his play money is small, and his losses will be small too (in the scheme
of things). He may learn soon enough (maybe) what works for him if he sticks
with investing.

Again just my opinion, even if I am wrong many, many times.

Thanks Joan, Mark, Jurgis, and Paul for your thoughts.

Paul's response hit me like a smack upside the head, and I realized I hadn't
shared the whole story of this budding teen investor. I also now admit I am
really interested in ETFs out of curiosity and for other purposes, not just the
15 yr. old.

Just for the record, his picks for the contest were WM, MCD, DELL, and BOBJ;
he's currently in 5th place with a 6.33% gain (in two weeks).

His 17 yr. old sister is in first place at 10.76% with SWF, NOK, AMD, and SUNW.

More importantly, he was an eager student in a "school" I put together for him
and his sister last summer. I met with them for about 40 minutes once or twice
a week, teaching them the basics of the market, stocks, funds, etc.
Very high level stuff, with lots of sports metaphors to keep their interest. It
was great fun. I even had quizs with pushups for wrong answers! :>)

The thing is - and what Paul's email jolted me into admitting - was that I was
projecting my anxieties about going through 2000-2002 again, losing big, on
this great kid. I wasn't giving him credit for what he learned. To wit, here's
my synopsis of what I taught them:

you all the info you want on a given ETF. I used them a lot this year to move

Latin America - LAQ, CH
Africa, SOA
Asia - TTF, APF, SGF, GCH

I have less experience with US-focused ETFS since I am more confident I can
pick my own stocks there. I do own some individual foreign stocks too. But the
ETFs are a great way to play foreign markets where stockpicking is best left to
the local experts much of the time.

No doubt those selections would have been great to own during the last 6

these vehicles to follow on with major increases two years in a row. The Thai
fund is up over 128% to Sep 30 this year, Singapore +46%, Greater China +76%.

I appreciate the strengthening Asian currencies relative to US buck are likely

Madharry, using only percentages gives you no protection if everything goes up

As far as FARO goes, I have not sold a share. My long term view is in Yahoo
FARO #1779. Short term I do not consider it worth selling any fundamentally
until the $20's, although today looked like a blowoff top short term. I have
held this view for a long time, and sized my initial purchase so I could have
this attitude. In other words, in the $20's the stock will go over my maximum
$$$ in a position limit. (I apply the rules I suggested such that a stock must

the deep water drillers will do better in the future than the land drillers. I
assume that the high NG prices keep the land based drill rigs running while the
deepwater exploration is lagging, despite fairly robust oil prices.

I don't see much sense jumping into this group right now as I see that my
favorite E&P APC is trading at 8x earnings.
