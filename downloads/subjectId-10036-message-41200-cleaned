The trick is going for companies that are too small for Wall Street to take
meaningful positions in. The market cap bracket under a billion is chock full
of thousands of possible targets, many of which are just getting started on the
value-building curve. Not worthless penny stocks, but solid operating companies
just hitting their growth stride.

The danger is their high volatility, which means that only holding 10 would be
too high a risk for most of us. But I wouldn't own 200 either, I am in between
you two.

I scarcely know where to begin in responding to your ideas.

1. We're a Ben Graham thread (maybe/sometimes). So for me as I review Dr.
Graham's last writings, he was about removing complexity. That is, he kind of
disavowed the complexity of his Graham&Dodd opus, and said it looked to him
like using a couple of standard measures -- price/book, p/e, or maybe others --
on a reasonable number of stocks would give results about as good as anything
else. (Like maybe 25-30-- I can't remember. Not 200 though. I don't believe
it's even possible for anyone in the media to ever suggest such a thing. 200
stocks for the average person? The person suggesting that would be laughed off
the stage.)

2. I stand by my previous statements -- if I can remember them - lol -- that
there's no real academic evidence that I've seen that confirms the more you
know about the particular stocks you put and keep in your portfolio, the better
your portfolio's performance will be.

3. You don't have access to my portfolios or their history, so I can only say
that you seem to presume that because when you see public managers with their
large number of stocks and they don't beat the market by much if at all, you
follow the usual conclusion that academics espouse, that my portfolio too must
tend to the mean, and that I would not beat the market by much if at all. Do
you still assume that same conclusion though even after I've implied my
portfolio isn't kept equally weighted (e.g. lots of oil stocks now)? I have
posted my performance over time in a previous post.

4. When I invest by time, sure, not so great $$$ gains with small positions. A
4.6x bagger on the few shares of Apple stock I still have from an 6/'06. That
performance is duplicated and bettered by several other small positions of
stocks in the portfolio as well. Which add up. Nibbles add up to a full meal.

5. I post stocks here that I am buying that fit into my model for value stocks.
I don't buy them because I have a strong belief in them. I buy them because
they fit. If I had to have a strong belief, I'd never have bought some of the
stocks that have treated me well.

6. Sometimes a belief does get in my way or in my sights. I use position size
to manage the risk of that.

I accept what you seem to be saying you want to do -- keep your portfolio down
to 10 stocks with a view that maybe you want to do very, very well with those
stocks (i.e. get big gains). How about though, you give some encouragement to
that view with some suggested buys for that portfolio of ten?
Are you suggesting MGM is one of the stocks? Or that you are swing trading one
or a few ETFs for a market timing thing? These ideas to me don't seem like they
will do the job. (Speculating more than "investing"?)

This all jmo, of course. I have my way, my strong opinions. Doesn't mean I'm
right. (And I'm often not.)
Room in investing for many different ways. So people here keep telling me.
Hrumph, hrumph -- I still say my way is best--wrong though I have been so many,

But so far you are just trying to sell your philosophy to a bunch of investors
as if they are some greenhorn newbs. You know people here have tried various
approaches, have read through Buffett and Munger and Graham and tons of other
stuff and know their ideas as much as you do. The fact that some of them
decided to follow more Grahamesque approach or more diversified GARP approach
does not make them schmucks or poor investors as you seem to imply. Maybe it's
time for YOU to reread Buffett's article "Superinvestors of
Graham-and-Doddsville" and learn some humility from it. One of the greatest
investors of all time knows how to appreciate different value investing
approaches. It's only his "disciples" that try to proclaim the way of Buffett -

Hello Nikkei86,

Have you been using this 10-stock strategy for a few years? To be honest, I've
considered it, but I'm not going to go for it. Right now, My top 10 positions
are generally over 60% of my portfolio, with another 10-20 positions comprising
the other 40% and I still am concerned enough about the market these days that
I've got a bunch of covered calls covering me for 10-20% premiums in case we
correct.

If I were to go to 10 positions someday, it would be only large, value
companies like CSCO, MSFT, GLW, TOT, E, etc... I've thought about it to try to
get solid returns, but I've backed off mostly due to the fact that I felt I
couldn't get exposed to enough sectors that way. And I had more ideas than 10
that I wanted to put my money into. And in the end, having only 10 positions
spooks me.

Thanks,

Grant

Dale, my thoughts exactly. You can find some very interesting situations among
the stocks that aren't followed by Wall Street. By the time the street picks up
on a stock, it's generally too late.

As far as volatility, I'm usually bored by it. I've been in some penny stocks
where the price dropped 50%, 75%, and my sleep wasn't affected at all. In fact,
I think I slept better for some reason ;-) I knew the value, and it ultimately
came through.

For some reason, 10 stocks seems like a lot to me. In the past, because of my
situation (undergrad, now grad student, no time for serious research), I've
usually committed 100% of my capital to 2 or 3 situations. Otherwise I just
play the macro moves. But I don't hesitate for a second to go all-in on stocks
I believe in.

It all depends on your situation. Obviously, a guy on the verge of retirement
should be very diversified.

"Why not show us your 2011 ten baggers?"

Point to my remark where I claim to have a list of ten-baggers. What I'm saying
is, in a purely philosophical manner, is that as you put more stocks in your
portfolio, you don't stand to gain as much from your best ideas. This should be
a calm discussion between market enthusiasts, not some nasty 'prove it'
contest.

I'm a grad student at the moment, and my time is EXTREMELY limited. I research
whenever I have free time, so if you're expecting me to list 10 stocks that are
10-bagger (I never said this, BTW) you're in for some disappointment. I'm here

Hi Grant!

I'm a grad student at the moment and the time I have available to research
stocks is extremely limited. So, whenever I find a really really good idea, I
load up. In the past, I haven't hesistated to put 100% of my capital in my best
2 to 3 ideas. When I'm out of ideas, I play the broad macro moves through
various ETFs. ex. RJI, SPY

This past upturn has been the easiest because of the amount of money the Fed is
printing. If the Fed continues, the markets will continue to go up. There will
be some technical pullbacks along the way, but, again, as long as the Fed
prints the money, this puppy is going up.

I think Buffett put it best when he said that everyone should treat each trade
as if it were one of twenty trades one could make in a lifetime. You get a
twenty-punch punch card. The point is that you wait. You fight the temptation
to put money into play. Buffett commented on this. He said having a lot of cash
sitting on the sidelines is dangerous, because you want to put it to work. He
had this problem before he bought the US Air preferred stock. And you load up
when you have a good idea. This idea is probably more of Munger's than
Buffett's. Munger talks about this idea a lot.

It just seems so obvious. Your best ideas you load up on. But if you don't have
time for research, or you're in retirements, etc., etc., wide diversification
makes sense.

Well, you started it as a "prove it" contest, so I'm not sure why you are
surprised now.

So let's see: you have some idea, you come to a thread and try to push it as
the only way to significantly outperform the market, you cannot show any proof
of it academically or from your own experience, and we still should all believe
you. When people ask you at least for some suggestions that would support your
claim, you turn around and tell them that you never said that you can provide
such potential portfolio and that you have no time to research it. So it's all:
"Hey guys, go do the work, find ten 10 baggers and you will be rich, now go"
from your side. OK, is that pretty much correct?

The problem is that you don't know which stocks are the ones which will return
your favorite ten baggers. Please give a methodology on how you can select
those "guaranteed" ten-ten-baggers and I will reduce my portfolio to 10 stocks
tomorrow. If I had such methodology, I would be at 10 stocks ten years ago.
Unfortunately, everything - including Buffett - does not provide good enough
selection methodology for me. Maybe you have a selection approach that works,
then please share it.

So OK, in theory I agree that investor could have better returns with
concentrated two stock or ten stock portfolio. The problem is how to select
those ten stocks so that you don't have a huge risk and you still get the high
return. Until you show how to do it, the theory remains theory. You may think
the risk is not there, but I've seen enough stock blowups to know it's there.

Hi Paul -
Pace Oil & Gas Ltd (PCE.TO)
Pace Oil & Gas Ltd. (MDOEF.PK)

Have you looked at Pace Oil & Gas Ltd.. This is the upstream Oil & NG business
that was spun off from PVX when they converted to a corporation.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=PCE.TO+Key+Statistics

80% of the shares are owned by PVX unit holders. The company trades below book
($9.80/share) and has proven reserves in-the-ground worth upwards of
$16.00/share (this is from Pg -6- of their 2010 presentation
http://www.paceoil.ca/images/stories/presentation/101222%20Q3%20PACE%20Investor
.pdf ). The stock is thinly traded on the pink sheets but has decent volume on
the Toronto exchange (PCE.TO).

Pace Oil & Gas Ltd. operates as an oil and natural gas production company. It
focuses on the development opportunities in the Deep Basin, the Peace River
Arch, and the northwest and southern regions of Alberta. The company is
headquartered in Calgary, Canada.

<img src='http://paceoil.ca/images/stories/opperations.jpg'>

The company presents several valuation metrics and conclude that "...Based on
average metric Pace should be currently trading $12.00 - $18.00..." ( pg-21-
http://www.paceoil.ca/images/stories/presentation/101222%20Q3%20PACE%20Investor
.pdf )

It looks like they have 80% NG and 20% Oil through current production but plan
90% of future capital budget to Oil development.

I currently own a few shares from the 2010 spin off ( at a much higher cost
basis) and think I will add some shares on any sell off back down to
$8.25/share. This one looks like a low risk trade with the potential to double
based on the reserves they currently own.

Any opinions?

Hi Spekulatius -

I was thinking about selling my Covidien plc. (NYSE: COV ) and buying Abbott
Laboratories Common Stock (NYSE: ABT ) with the proceeds. The PE differential
still favors holding COV a bit longer. I was waiting for $50.00/share.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ABT,COV&d=s

I think I prefer the equipment side of the business and COV is more of a pure
play here. However, ABT does pay a higher dividend and is out of favor
especially w/ their recent warning on forward earnings. It's getting cheap
enough that I should probably sell at least half of my COV and move the
proceeds into an equivalent amount of ABT shares.

Have you bought any? Are you looking at any other devise makers? JNJ only looks
interesting to me in the low $50's.

I don't like Pace: it's too gassy for me. Too tough for me to value, and I'm
not sure I've got the patience to stick with it until gas prices improve or
company moves to more oil/ngl production.
=========================
I don't understand how in that presentation, npv per share is determined.

P.4 of presentation: basic shares outstanding = 47M; fully diluted = 50M.

On p. 6 though, per share net asset value is calculated on 40M shares: $643/40
= $16.09. I don't understand why that 40M number.

Moving to p.21, the company compares its price/nav to its peers price/nav, and
based on that and other similar metric comparisons, says PCE is undervalued by
some percentage. In other words the company should be valued much higher. I
question (rhetorical) if PCE's price/nav is somehow based on 40M shares and if
so, if that's the correct or adequate number to use.

Nikkei86 - when I was a college grad, my portfolio was smaller too, in terms of
the position # and the $ (at that point it was DM) value too. I had maybe a
handful positions, mostly to keep my commissions at a manageable level.

Now my portfolio is somewhat larger and I don't particulary like the idea to
loose a year worth of savings with a single bad decision. Commission matter
less too, in relative terms, so I see no harm in diversifying.

I could probably do with 15-20 position but my investment principle is to
average down. Well sometimes I can, sometimes I don't because the stock goes up
and I rarely average up. So I get stuck with stub position which I neither have
a compelling reason to add too, nor I want to sell. So the 20 position swell
into 30-40 positions. Beyond that level, I probably start to clean up and
consolidate, especially in tax deferred accounts.

As far as Buffet is concerned, he was not a pure Graham like value investor. He
was more an activist or even control investor and he was concentrated, so that
he could make sure he could influence the outcome in a substantial manner, or
where he had superior knowledge (in some cases knowledge that would be
considered insider knowledge nowadays). that was a very different approach than
Graham/Dodd. the latter were basically buying a fairly diversified mix of
stocks which appeared undervalued , without studying the individual companies
all that much.

Well that's just me - 10 position is a very low number, because I found that I
have ideas in areas that are often correlated. This means that probably 30% of
my position and funds are bet on a single idea or trend, so the diversification
is not as great as it seems. I basically take some insurance out on company
specific risk but overall market trends can still have a significant impact on
portfolio performance.

Hi Mr. Gogo - If you do not have a small position in GMXR this recent sell off
may provide a good entry point.

Lots of news out today on GMXR. The most important is the issuance of $100
Million in new stock. Company also plans to focus on Oil rather than NG in next
years capital budget. They also are paying down debt. Long term probably
bullish as they can afford to expand their common shares and make up any
dilution w/ growth. Short term, current shareholders do not like any type of
share dilution.

You could wait until they price their secondary offering and try to buy on any
dip below that price. I doubt that any new offering will go below $5.00/share.

Company owns a lot of good assets especially in the Hainsville Shale area where
there is a lot of take over discussions by XCO investors.

GMX Resources Issues Haynesville Shale Update
http://shale.typepad.com/haynesvilleshale/

GMX Resources (GMXR) issued an update on its operations in the Haynesville
Shale, including data on production and well costs.

GMX Resources brought eight wells onto production during the fourth quarter of
2010. These wells had an average lateral length of 5,356 feet and an average
cost of $8.9 million. The company indicated that this was a decline in average
cost of $500,000 per well.

GMX Resources reported that the Mia Austin #6H Haynesville Shale well produced
an average of 7.24 million cubic feet of natural gas per day during the first
sixty days. The Bosh Heisman #17H well was recently drilled and completed into
the Haynesville Shale with a lateral length of 6,164 feet and a fifteen stage
hydraulic fracturing operation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lots of cross currents. Since GMXR's management has a new focus on drilling Oil
wells (and no more NG wells) would they consider packaging some of their
producing NG wells in the Hainsville Shale area to a potential buyer of XCO
properties?

It should provide for an interesting ride w/ this stock as some of their assets
may be in play at a time where they need the money to expand their oil drilling
program.

I wonder how many shares were sold short between $5.75-$6.3 ahead of this $100m

That is one way they make the risk free money.

I think GMXR will trade dead lock in range: $4.5-$5.5 for a while.

Re: Penn Virginia Corp. (PVA)

Started a position in PVA. Looking to eventually write some covered calls to
supplement the 1.3% quarterly dividend. PVA has a BV of $22.00/share, 1 years
Gross profit covers their LT debt so their large LT debt is quite manageable
out of the income they generate from the operating companies they own and/or
control, there has been recent large insider buys from Black Rock, and they
recently have completed four producing wells located in the Hansville Shale
area.

November 17, 2010
Penn Virginia Corporation - Haynesville Shale Update - Q3 2010
http://shale.typepad.com/haynesvilleshale/page/2/

Penn Virginia Corporation (PVA) reported the completion of four gross wells
into the Haynesville Shale during the third quarter of 2010. These wells had
initial production rates ranging from 5.3 million to 8.7 million cubic feet
equivalent per day.

Although Penn Virginia Corporation is encouraged by the results of its
development program here, the company has decided to defer further drilling
until natural gas prices recover sufficiently to provide better returns to the
company.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The company is well diversified with three operating segments: Oil and Gas,
Coal and Natural Resource Management, and Natural Gas Midstream. They have a
lot of land that they have owned for decades. They manage timber (above ground
assets), oil & NG mineral rights (below ground assets) and NG gathering assets
(pipe line and processing facilities.

I really like their Midstream business that throws off a lot of cash flow. This
segment should benefit from the increased NG production in the area that they
service.

From their annual report: "...The Natural Gas Midstream segment provides
natural gas processing, gathering, and other related services. As of December
31, 2009, it owned and operated 6 natural gas processing facilities; and
approximately 4,118 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines in Oklahoma and
Texas. The company was founded in 1882 and is headquartered in Radnor,
Pennsylvania with additional offices in Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and West
Virginia...."

Penn Virginia are three interrelated Radnor, Pennsylvania-based companies that
trade separately on the New York Stock Exchange and control 916.4 Bcfe of oil
and gas deposits, 827 tons of coal [1] and have 400 million cubic feet per day
(MMcfd) midstream oil and natural gas pipeline and processing operations.[2]

The original company was split into three separate companies in 2006. PVA kept
large equity interests in BOTH PVG & PVR.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PVA,PVG,PVR&d=s

* Penn Virginia Corporation (NYSE: PVA) (owns natural gas and oil and has large
ownership interest in the other two companies)
* Penn Virginia GP Holdings, L.P. (NYSE: PVG) (controlled by Penn-Virginia
Corporation and is the largest shareholder of Penn Virginia Resources)
* Penn Virginia Resources (NYSE: PVR) (controls the coal and pipeline
operations)

Therefore, you get controlling interests in PVG & PVR that include many
undervalued domestic natural resource assets.

I am looking for PVA to trade back to it's 2007-2008 trading range of
$45.00-$65.00 price level.

At this point, however, I can't imagine filling a portfolio with anything more

Hi nikkei86 -

You might look at Gulf Resources, Inc. (GFRE) for your water play. They are a
huge producer and distributor of bromide ( thew own the mines, processing
facilities & distribution channels) in China. Bromide is a chemical used in the
water treatment and purification process. This company has been discussed a lot
on this thread so search GFRE for a lot of detail(s) both pro & con.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=GFRE+Key+Statistics

PE wise this is a big value at 5 PE. Some on this thread are skeptical of the
accounting being a Chinese company. Their bromide business is growing over 20%
in China and it seems that this should continue for quite some time. I doubt
you will see any significant PE expansion but it is not unreasonable to expect
such growth to demand at least a 10PE.

Your 10 Stock Portfolio

In your situation I would suggest a smaller equity concentration of three or
four stocks (your best ideas) that you commit money for 2-3 years. Say 50% in
equities (best ideas) w/ the remainder of the funds in sector(s) or general
market indexes (ie.ETFs).

With your "Best idea stocks" you can also use long term options to leverage
your position when significant buying opportunities present themselves. Stagger
each of your four stock selections over a quarter (every three months) so when
you eventually close out a position you have a source of funds to re-invest
into another "best idea". Be willing to make your buys in three different
chunks over three months,

Let your "best ideas grow" and after 24-36 months you should be able to harvest
your shares w/ a multi-bagger if your best idea pans out.

The key is to let your winners run and it will take at least 18 months during
normal market cycles for Mr. Market to realize the value in your selected
equity "best idea" position(s). Since you stagger your new buys, after 18
months, you should be able to begin to harvest your potential gains every
quarter, Keep this up for six years and your portfolio should double or triple
in value (10% to 20% annualized return).

From time to time, if you have no best ideas, harvest your best idea gains and
re-invest in your ETF's. You may also have a buying opportunity so sell some of
the ETF's and start your 1/3 equity buy in your new position(s).

The patient investor with an investment strategy for building value positions
can expect a better than 10% per year annualized return (double your portfolio
value in 7.2 years). I think you can do this with ETF's and a 3-4 concentrated
stock portfolio in 36-48 months.

My portfolio is around 90 positions that I manage for income and growth. It's
my sole source of income but my biggest returns have come from my multi baggers
that I held for 24-36 months.

My average new position size (new seed money) is $5K. Once I am comfortable w/
my analysis, theme & or value opportunity it will become a minimum $15K
investment which I expect to grow to $50K in 2-3 years. My goal is to find
15-20 "best ideas" every year. I am trying to turn my portfolio over every 4
years but I tend to hold onto some of my core positions much longer which skew
my results.

That's how I do it and I have been at it for over 35 years. I started w/ two
best idea stocks in college and have grown that to over 90 equity positions
which make up my taxable and IRA account(s). When I was employed I contributed
10% to the IRA which was matched by my employer.

Good luck with your investment career you have lots of time to grow your
portfolio.

I've heard the water story for ages now - at least ten years or so. It keeps
resurfacing every time there is drought somewhere. I've also lived in So Cal
when they built desalination plant during one of the low water years and then
could not find business for it as rainy years came.

Does not mean the story is wrong, but I'd be skeptical that it will be correct
in short term and not, for example, 10 years from now.

There is another issue too: municipalities/governments delay water investments
as much as they can. And when they invest they either strong arm low margins or
they give business to their cronies. In both cases this is a politics based
marketplace which Buffett (not sure about your hero Munger :P) avoided most of
the time. You can avoid politics somewhat by buying the shovel makers, but most
shovel makers are not pure water plays. So you end up diluting (pardon the pun)
already weak story, IMHO.

Personally, I don't think there will be a huge water play soon. IMHO oil is
much easier play than water if you look for a natural resource shortage play,
although oil was much more exciting when it dropped to 30's.

With all that said, I almost bought ITT on valuation before it ran up due to
the corporate split announcement. Not a buy right now for me. No interest in
other companies listed.

My top 10-ish positions in no particular order: NRF-A/B, UVIC, MHR-C, IDCC,
EBIX, GFRE, GILD, COPJF, DRAGF. Changes in top-10: None.

New positions: ESTE, PSDMF, TSP
Positions increased: PWRD, MAIL, FRFHF, FSR, AXS, MSFT, GAME
Positions reduced: NRF-A/B, CSGH
Positions eliminated: STPJF, GS, HOG, GXDX

Even though I established and increased some positions, there was not much to
buy recently. Maybe this is changing with the Egyptian crisis. We will see.

My fixed income pref sales continue with NRF-A/B climbing almost to par. MHR-C
is now over par with investors probably expecting that the company is getting
overlevered and will not be able to replace C prefs at first opportunity in
December. If it is called in December, yield to maturity sucks (~7.5%). I am
not selling yet, but I'm definitely thinking about it.

I did not like CSGH report and lightened a bit.
I sold STPJF on valuation.
I did not like poor GS earnings and the fact that they made most money on
trading their own accounts, so I sold the whole position.
I finished selling HOG. The turnaround is somewhat there, but the company is
still struggling. I am sure HOG would be a good acquisition for someone and it
might even make a good turnaround, but I am not so confident in it at this
price.
GXDX announced a buyout. First buyout for me this year. I should have kept full
position instead of selling half at $21 when they announced shopping for buyer.
Sold the last half after announcement.

New positions:
ESTE - our old friend BSIC renamed. Reacquired position that I previously sold
higher.
PSDMF - interesting drama for popcorn. Not a value stock. Exploratory position.
TSP - pretty cheap if they can figure a way to maintain or grow their earnings.
Initial position.

MAIL has announced new agreement with GOOG and it looks like they are going to
make tons of cash for coming couple years. Bought more.
MSFT is still very cheap. Added after earnings.
The rest are increases on valuation and attempts to productively deploy money:
PWRD, FRFHF, FSR, AXS, GAME. Most of them will announce earnings sometime in
coming two weeks. I don't expect anything spectacular. Hopefully no blowups
either.

Nikkei86, you believe you're not too late, and that these stocks are still
value buys at their current prices?

I say look instead at PICO, SBS, maybe AWK.

You have access to the Wall Street Transcript? You are blessed...and cursed.

Very, very difficult to find a library that will pay the cost for that. Not
sure what it is now -- $1800/yr.? I assume as a graduate student, it's not you
who has a personal subscription. For me as an alleged value investor -- $1800
is too stiff a price for me to pay for my own subscription.

The benefit of the WST is that you get so many ideas each issue for stocks that
could be buys. I'd say maybe at least 20 or more from the dozens of stocks
mentioned from ceo interviews, special reports, industry analysts, roundtables,
etc. in each issue. You are just not going to find a lot of these stocks
discussed elsewhere (although the water stocks you culled are well-known). The
Wall Street Transcipt is possibly my favorite investing publication.
http://www.twst.com/index.html
I'd say though for you, from what I believe I am reading of your posts - you
really don't have a fixed method for determining valuation of a stock -- i.e.
if a stock is a buy or not based on metrics. You're more or less by gut -- oil
is going up; there a possible water shortage. So you are going to see so many
stocks mentioned that have good ideas and logic behind them as to why they are
buys, that you are going to spin. -g-

Re value investing

>>That definitely has to be frustrating. I'm not a big technical analyst, but
I'm sure it would be helpful in building a position.<<

True, as a value investor, I am far more often frustrated than satisfied. I am
frustrated when the stocks I consider to be cheap, become cheaper (after I
acquired already what I consider a full position). I am frustrated when the
stocks that I bought go up, before I bought a full position. I am frustrated
when the market goes straight up, just like it did during the last few month
and I find lot's of stocks to sell and nothing to buy and cash swells to 40%+.
But then on the other hand, I regard as all this frustration as the price to
pay for usually better than average performance.

I could entertain myself better buying Momo stocks. Lot's more people to talk
to, blogs to study, new tech trends etc but is it profitable. I guess I stick
with what works for me and if I want to be entertained I'll watch a good or bad
movie or have a few cold ones with a couple of friends from work.

Anyways, i buy more stock position in chunks. I average down in increments. I
have a max. $ amount in mind when I first buy a position and usually keep the
first buy at 1/3 of that $ amount, sometimes less. There are exceptions from
this rule when I see a real special situation or a very attractive opportunity.
I look at technicals too, but I find them to be of limited use. There are
resistance zones, breakouts and all that but what is really going to happen.
Resistance zone can be broken or they stay intact and the stock bounces back.
'
Case in point ABT - stock looks really weak and a resistance zone is in the
44-46$ range. Will it hold - I don't know...I bought my first at 46.21$, my
second today at 45.35$ in another account. I bought 2 lot's out of my possible
6 total, so if it goes down without any bad news I think it will go down in the
42-43$ range at which point I probably buy my 3& 4 lot. Who know if it goes up
- either way, I am prepared. The way I see it, so more volatile the market is,
the better, as it provides great opportunities for those with cash and
conviction. In reality, I don't really have that much conviction, I just follow
a sort of mechanical approach to average down carefully while trying to asses
the risk and downside constantly. but selling just because others selling
assuming they know more than I do? That is a loosers game, imo.

This is really great advice, thanks so much! You articulate the strategy well,
and I agree with it. One thing I love about ETFs is that they relieve the
pressure of trying to chase opportunities. With most investors, it's either the
idea or cash. That can be dangerous. I'm very very comfortable with my macro
picks, so I can let the money sit in the ETFs, as you say, and invest when a
compelling opportunity comes along. Or, when I close out, shift it back to the
ETF. And there are so many ETFs out there, that there is always a strategy to
play out.

No, just polling you guys. I've looked at the charts, and they've already had

When I found out my uni had it, I was surprised, but definitely delighted. If

I'm familiar with the DCF models, and all the rest, and I do think they serve a

things, it's usually too close. Plus, it's really just mental masturbation with
the growth rates.

You thought more or less correctly. There is no water problem. There is only a
cost of water problem: you can always desalinate if you have enough money and
energy.

Differently from other commodities where the cost of digging may increase
arbitrarily high, the cost of desalination + transport from coast is always the
same in terms of energy. So there's always a cap on cost. Not saying that this
cap is low or acceptable for emerging countries though. Although there are a
number of people and companies working on affordable water solutions for poor
countries.

But the article does point out that the problem is relegated to specific
regions. Particularly, emerging markets where cities are seeing tremendous
inflows from the rural areas. That makes sense.

It does, but this makes the politics issue even more: there's no guarantee that
any of the western companies will be big beneficiaries if Brazil (for
example... you can take any other country) decides to improve their water
infrastructure.

Nice discussion on diversification. FWIW I am still not well diversified and
have 5 positions or less at most times. I think to build wealth it is likelier
by concentrating positions while protecting wealth is accomplished by
diversifying.
I find a really good ideas that I can quantify and understand every few years.
The market crash gave me an opportunity to build some wealth. I took 2
positions that I was certain had more intrinsic value than the market gave and
have made outsized returns.
They were APL and LINE. I still hold them and 300% so far. I will need to
diversify soon and the reason is only to protect wealth.
My best ideas will probably still be outsized but my issue is that if you have
made enough, and I think I am close, to being able to retire at a decent age,
it is foolish to risk it by not being diverse.
And enough for me is that if near average returns can get me where I want to be
then why risk it by being luke warm. Not enough stocks to protect you from bad
calls and too many to really keep track of.
Worst mistake in the down turn was selling NFLX...what a run on that stock.
Best lesson(learned over many years) was invest in something you understand
well enough to overcome the fear when the market is screaming sell.

I interpret what you are saying as: having a very concentrated portfolio gives
a very wide variation in expected results.

In being concentrated, since the band of expected performance is wide, some
people are going to do very well -- wind up at the top with excellent outsize
gains.

Similarly as you say, if the person has made enough or is near retirement age
and is still concentrated, and thus is still in that wide band of expected
results, then one ought maybe consider he/she could drop to the low end of that
performance spectrum, and lose a lot - if not most - of the gains. So therefore
diversify and reduce that band, reduce that risk.

To me, an issue is not whether being concentrated can bring on more wealth than
being diverse, but rather, what works for the average person? I always recall
the heyday of Yahoo, with the media report of the family sitting in the front
of the annual stockholders' meeting. They had little experience in the stock
market, owned only Yahoo, but went all in at the right time, hung on and hung
on and hung on, and made $millions from their very small investment. This
extreme reminds me that there are always going to be people who do well with
concentrated portfolios. It doesn't mean it's the sensible or best or optimum
way to invest.

My opinion is that for most people, they have a better chance of reaching their
financial goals by being diverse in their investments. (Assuming goals are
typical normal, ie. kids through college/retirement secure, etc.)

Furthermore, it's not necessary to beat the market. If people would invest
early enough and consistently enough, with dividends reinvested, they only need
average returns. We see studies that show that most market participants can't
even get average returns (about 10%/yr, I believe, with dividends reinvested).
Reasons seem to be people sell out at wrong time, buy at wrong time, don't
realize dividends are a significant component of the 10%, and don't reinvest
the dividends they do get. I wonder too, if part of that is that most people
maintain too concentrated a portfolio. -g-

From:geoffrey Wren
I see four reasons to run your own portfolio as opposed to low-cost ETF's or
mutual funds. I am sure there are more, but the four I see are:

1. Controlling the timing of capital gains, losses. For instance, if you have
purchased a stock for $10,000 and it is now $5,000, and you still like it, I
say buy another tranche, wait 31 days, and then sell the first tranche and lock
in your loss. There are other plays like this if you control the trading.

2. Reduce cost. Even low cost ETF's can run, say .2% fees, or $400/year on
$200,000 invested. Well, if you have $200,000 to invest in that ETF, you can
create your own portfolio of 15 stocks for less than $150 in commissions, and
if you only moved positions of three stocks a year, running cost would be less
than $100/year. I would not think this reason for running your own portfolio
would be significant until you had maybe $500,000 or more to work with.

3. Favor classes of stocks in IRA. I am not sure why more is not written about
this. It is a given that Muni bonds yield less because the rich chase after
then, and these should not be held in IRA's because the tax benefits would be
lost. I think it is also a given that REIT's yield more because their dividends
are not given the 15% tax rate. Sure there are many other tax deferred
investors such as pension funds, but they cannot move into thinly traded
positions. At any rate, I have a fair amount of REIT's in my IRA's, and it
seems to me there is an edge there.

4. Be a stock picker.

As to being a stock picker, I would advise anyone starting out to be be
conservative at first, in that same way that if you are joining a poker game it
is a good idea to play slow at the beginning until you understand the game. I
did okay when first venturing into investments, but below the index (I always
reference the S&P500). I did about as well as a typical mutual fund manager I
suppose. Luckily I did spread my bets out at first.

Since 97 I have outperformed. Maybe it has been luck. There are serious and
weighty arguments that one cannot outperform the market except by luck. I tend
to believe that is true in the large cap stocks. But I think there is
opportunity in small-cap stocks that are not so much followed, especially odd
eccentric small-cap stocks in transition.

I do not think one should attempt to be a stock picker unless one spends 10
hours a week or more working at it. Its best if you are in position to monitor
your stocks over the course of the day. Mostly I troll for new ideas. I do not
see the need to be in more than 20 stocks, and I concentrate a lot in my top 3
or 4 ideas. Respect other investors, but never invest just because someone else
invested. Come to your own conclusions. Do not trust managements. Some are
honorable; more have the ethics of used car salesmen.

So here are two recommendations: MDH and RAS. Check them out.

I am still trying to come to an understanding of SVU.

Your words are accurate. My portfolio is and was concentrated. My needed
retirement assets are not. I have a pension and a 401K that are actually
enough. I have made outsized returns with a taxable account and an IRA because
I could afford to take the risk. I plan to use the extra to retire a little bit
earlier than I would have.
Is it for everyone, certainly no. But if you can take a risk with a portion of
your assets by concentrated bets and have an interest then I think it is ok to
go against conventional advice.
Every small business owner does the same thing for a while and taking an
ownership position in a security that is outsized is the same in my opinion.

My advice to most people is diversify among dividend payers. There will be some
on this site that swinging for triples and home runs at some point makes
perfect sense to me. The difficult part is stepping back and hearing the wise
counsel that you are giving when the triples and home runs are working.

I have been investing for over 20 years and realize my weaknesses and
strengths. Some expensive lessons for sure but I have gotten much more patient
with capital and tend to do better then I was ever hoping to do.

Personally I think part of the problem with most investors is they trade too
much because they are speculating only instead of looking at investments as an
ownership stake. Quality management and quality assets become easier to spot
with practice but certainly I do not have time to keep very close track of even
10 companies.

As far as the companies I am invested in currently the only one that I think
has a
likely chance of being very undervalued is Sandridge and my position is still
small. If it becomes very obvious that they have turned around there will be
plenty of gains left to increase the position. APL bottomed at$2.50 but I did
not buy until $8 when the turnaround was clear. 9 months of watching and
research before I pulled the trigger. Lynn energy was easier when there were
crazy prices in the meltdown. I sold NFLX to buy Linn energy and am happy with
my choice.

Linn energy and Atlas Pipeline are not overvalued IMO but would not be such
large positions buying at todays prices. I am happy to get the compounding at
my cost basis with increasing distributions so I have no reason to sell today
except to diversify and even then would keep some of both because the assets
are so long lived they fit my criteria for long term holdings.

Thanks for your thoughtfully worded post.

Somebody asked me in private why MHR-C yield to maturity is ~7.5 and not 9.X%
that you get dividing $2.5625/$25.8. Here's the answer:

At maturity you only get $25 for the pref, while you are paying $25.8 for it
now. So you lose $.8 that you have to make up from divvies. Your yield to
maturity for remaining 10 months is about ($25 + $2.5625/12*10) - $25.8 /
$25.8. The actual formula is much more complicated due to discounting and
monthly accumulation + possible reinvesting, so you have to plug in numbers
into one of the yield-to-maturity online calculators. Here's one, though it has
1 year minimum for calculations:
http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/bond_yield_calculator.htm

Your only chance to get better yield is that MHR-C would not be called in
December. The longer it's not called the better your yield becomes. If it's
called in Dec, the yield rather sucks.

Of course, it should be pointed out that the benefits of diversification can be

It should also be noted that "risking" a large portion of your portfolio on a
wager is not exactly what most of us on this board will be seeking to do, given
we are value investors with margin of safety concerns!

The difference between variance in results and permanent capital loss is large
- whether you can tolerate volatility and know you have achieved margin of

here

That quote you mentioned is likely is a relevant quote, because it's still used

Interesting that Mark Twain, who penned the quote, was himself an avid but very
unsuccessful investor. His concentrated investments in a supposed technology
gizmo of the time, and his big bet on a mine (apparently salted by unscrupulous
promoters) were possible contributors to a result that caused him to go
bankrupt.

I wonder if the quote was his acknowledgment that he attributed a lot of his
failure to not checking out and following his investments more closely.

Well, no intrusion if there is more to it than just quote. :) Because if it's
just a quote, then IMHO it's useless.

Once you (or someone else) elaborates, we can have a discussion. (I like what
Paul said, BTW. ;))

For example, how do you decide on the basket? I assume your quote does not
imply that any basket (stock/company) is fine as long as you watch it. Cause
that's obviously wrong. ;) So there has to be a decision on basket not
mentioned in the quote.

OK, so now you used some way to select the basket. How do you watch it then? Do
you talk to the management? Other investors? Competitors? Analysts? Do you read
financial numbers? Technicals?

Then, watching presumably is also not enough. If bad things happen, you have to
do something with the basket. Maybe you can repair it - if you're an active
investor. Switch to another basket? When and how?

Somehow the simple approach in the quote does not seem so simple anymore, does
it?

Waiting for the right basket is what is difficult if it is your only investing
style.
I have difficulty being even close to 100% cash which would be required if you
had not found the right basket.
It takes a ton of effort IMO to really research a company better than the
analyst following it to the point that you can see out a few years with
confidence that the value is discounted too far.
That for me rules out real complicated companies and markets. I am just not
smart enough. I decided a few years ago to focus on energy production,
transportation, fractionation, distribution and suppliers. The markets for
NGL's, crude oil, and gas are just as important as reservoir characteristics
and emerging technologies to the long-term value in the entities that have a
choke point on the assets.
The home-work has been interesting and fun which is a key part if you want to
attempt the few basket strategy.

Re: Penn Virginia GP Holdings, L.P.(NYSE: PVG ) - Buy
Re: Penn Virginia Resource Partners (NYSE: PVR )
Penn Virginia Corporation Commo (NYSE: PVA ) - Buy

Re: Spectra Energy Corp Common Stock (NYSE: SE ) - Sell

Started a position in Penn Virginia GP Holdings LP (PVG). As you stated, there
is a merger pending.

"...As previously announced, under the terms of the merger agreement, PVG
unitholders will receive 0.98 PVR limited partnership units in exchange for
each PVG limited partnership unit owned at closing. The merger transaction
would be completed with 100 percent equity consideration and would result in
PVR owning its general partner, the cancellation of PVG's incentive
distribution rights and the cancellation of the PVR limited partnership units
owned by PVG....".

I am not too sure how this translates into PVA shares. There is however a
discount between PVG ($26.20) and PVR ($28.00) about a $1.25/share discount
based on the .98 conversion factor.

I am not too clear where the NG Gathering assets reside but that is the
component I really want. I think they are inside the PVR Limited partnership. I
plan to build up my PVG shares equal to my PVA shares so when everything
eventually converts, I will have a full position.

Their NG Gathering assets are at least 25% undervalued if I compare PVR vs some
of my other NG gathering companies and MLP's during the prior four years since
the PVR spin off.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=PVR&t=5y&l=on&z=l&q=l&c=se%2Cdpm%2Ceeq%2Cepd

Once the dust settles, I will probable sell the remainder of my Spectra Energy
Corp. (SE) (acquired 2/2009 at $13.28/share as a 2009 Best Idea) and see if the
new PVA can move back to it's pre unbundled highs (Nov 2006) of $32.00/share. I
think this should be at least a double especially with all the new interest in
NG & coal.

That's the strategy and value opportunity at least the way I see it.

Followed you into Abbott Laboratories Common Stock (NYSE: ABT ) with a starter

I peeled off a few shares of Covidien plc. Ordinary Shares (NYSE: COV ) that I
