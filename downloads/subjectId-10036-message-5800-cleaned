Re: options
I gave up on all types of options a while ago. At first I just sold calls. Then
I took an options course, examined every possible strategy (they hand out a
nice cheat sheet), and chose synthetic longs and call-ratio backspreads as my
tools, using real time data with OptionStation. The level of sophistication in
pricing these things is much higher than most casual options players suspect,
and IMO the market is much, much, much more efficient than stocks. After trying
futures, options, tech analysis, and feeling that I was running in circles
(thankfully I never lost my shirt - especially in the commodities) I've
determined that plain stocks are the most rational area to find discrepancies
in value large enough and analyzable enough, given the facilities available to
me in terms of time and technology, to give outsized returns. I agree with Bob
that the best books are by McMillan (ignore the stuff from Angell).

But everyone should also know exactly what they're getting into, and that means
seeing the real-time options pricing and search software in action prior to
doing it. IMO, options are absolutely nothing about the price of the underlying
security (they are everything about correctly interpreting the security's
volatility differently than the market), and hence poor substitutes to simple
shorts, which for now I'm continuing to use.

I agree with your statement when you are taking about a single contract for 'x'
time or when you are trading options. But what about the situation I am talking
about? Suppose you view the option not as a single contract that will either be
a winner or loser, but as a rolling LONG TERM short position. In other words,

1. I can choose to short stock 'abc' until the price reaches 'x'.
or

2. I can choose to sell calls on stock 'abc' every 'y' months until the price
reaches 'x'.

It seems to me that if the stock is truly overvalued, a continuous series of
selling calls could turn out to be more profitable because the calculation of
the premium price is in part related to the stock price. And all option models
I have seen assume that the stock is efficiently priced which in our example we
are assuming is not the case. So I agree with you on a single option case or a
trade, but I suspect my alternate view of a series could be different. If the
stock goes down you can get the downward movement plus the premiums.

The option strategy limits losses when the stock is going up and against you
and may even provide profits because of the continuous collection of premiums
which can amount to a big percentage annualized.

It works out much better when the stock is sort of doing nothing but bouncing
around for an extended period of time because you are collecting premiums.

The only down side, is when there is a sharp crack in the stock at one time or
a crash. You may not participate fully in the profit. I suppose some judgment
might be useful here as to why you are shorting the stock to begin with. Are
you expecting them to miss the next quarter number? This could cause a violent
move down. Then shorting would be preferable. But if you expect no violent move
down other than random chance, if the stock moves down slowly, you can keep
moving the strike price down and pretty much fully participate.

I have engaged in some hedging activities in my own portfolio over the last few
years as the market moved higher and some of my personal holdings that I did
not want to sell became overvalued. I sold calls on stocks I thought were more
overvalued than my own and likely to disappoint. I am certain that in the cases
where I have been wrong, the options strategy saved me a ton of money. Just
something to toss around. Sorry I'm off the value investing topic.

Mike,

Here's a simple example of what I might do. Suppose I wanted to short the
S&P500 because I thought it was worth 1000. Instead, I sell strike price 1000
calls going out 3 months and repeat the process every expiration. I might
receive an annualized premium of anywhere from 7%-15% (probably closer to the
lower) depending on where the S&P trades and what the volatility is. I will
also bank the cash and earn interest.

If the S&P moves up 7%-8% this year I am still even to slightly ahead for the
year and way ahead of a short seller.

If the S&P moves up a lot, I am losing but I am better off than the short
seller.

If the market moves down but remains above 1000 I have made more than the short
seller after 3 months (or 6, 9, or 12 months) because of premiums and interest.

If if moves close to 1000 at any point I can cash out the same as a short
seller but I will have to give up some premium and he will not. Depending on
how close to expiration I am and at what level the last option was sold at I
may still be slightly better off or even with the short seller depending on how
much I have accumulated in prior premiums and interest. It's a close call.

Only a crash through 1000 from a high level would leave me worse off.

If I felt something like that was more likely for whatever reason, I would
reverse course and short instead. I am willing to give up the low probability
crash scenario for the other favorable scenarios.

I don't want to get too hung up about options because that's not what this

posting it originally was because I think it is an alternative to shorting
(which some people were discussing) that can limit some of the losses when you

you call sell in the money calls and capture all the downside you feel is
appropriate and still get a small premium. It's just an alternative.

Wayne: Highfliers selling calls. The whole point of the operation is to fully
participate in the downside collapse of wildly overvalued issue like AMZN. When
this will occur or the shape of the downtrend are pretty much unknowable as is
the intervening price path. Selling calls exposes you to potential price
explosion - AMZN moved about 100 points intraday in 5 sessions, without
considering major expansion in risk premium 1 option would have exposed you to
$10,000 drawdown, without giving you access to potential price IMPLOSION.

It would seem, however, this might be a reasonable strategy for a moderately
overvalued issue with moderate fluctuation that lacked catalyst to sink or
soar..you would be paid to wait. I wouldn't do it, but it seems reasonable.
A variation would be to use call selling to let the market take you out of an
issue that you owned yet felt was fully priced..covered call writing.

I understand your point and I agree. I'm not sure what I would do with a stock
like AMZN. Most likely I would start heavily in the money so I could
participate in a collapse.(this one is wildly overvalued so definitely
vulnerable) I would still collect a decent premium on the option sale because
of the volatility.

You have to remember that when the stock moved up 100 points, options sellers
lost a lot less than short sellers because of the premium they banked. So short
sellers lost 100 and options sellers lost 90 something or less.

On the flip side, if the stock falls 100 (and you started 100 in the money) you
can buy the first option back and sell another one that is 100 further in the
money. You can keep rolling down the calls and get a lot of the collapse. How
this nets out compared to the short seller depends on the timing of the events
relative to expiration and the other usual factors. It will cost a lot to buy
back that first option after the stock falls 100 points if you are still far
from expiration, so the short seller usually will make out better. The sooner
the collpase happens, the better off the short seller. The longer it takes the
better off the options seller because he is constantly accumulating premiums.
If it never happens, then the options seller is way better off.

My big problem with the short side in general is that the losses are unlimited
and the gains limited. The options route lessens the pain when you are wrong
bigtime and still pays off when you are slightly wrong.

Twister,

>>wayne, in a crash scenario, why would you be a loser? Wouldn't you

I wouldn't lose. I would make the entire premium and interest as you say. But a
short seller would make more because my gain is limited to the premium and his
can keep going for a long as the market falls. In a crash scenario I am kind of
assuming that I won't be able to keep rolling down my options due to either an
inability to get through to my broker or use my online account. This happened
to me already during one of those 500 point down days.

>>BTW: Selling naked out of the money leaps is a favorite pastime of Jim

I didn't know that. He's must be thinking of it as a long term overvaluation
bet the same way I am. He must believe the premiums are mispriced because the
underlying stocks are mispriced. The long term nature of the bet is similar to
thinking about long term bullish stock investments. I don't know what the
stock's going to do short term but if I'm right about the values... Thanks!

People are saying you don't get the full bang for your buck on your bearish bet

I think the company is a fantastic value on a stand alone basis, but there are
other factors which make it attractive, as well;
1) There is consolidation in the drug store industry. JCP taking over Eckerd's
and Genovese, for example. Genovese went out at almost 5 times book.

Bear Stearns recently recommended investors increase exposure to energy. They
reported that the current weighting of the sector in the S & P 500 stands at
5.2% which is its low since the late 70s. Their oil analyst is projecting that
oil will average $17 a barrel for 1999 and that earnings will rise sharply.

Seventeen-dollar oil seems a bit optimistic but Bear Stearns has been pretty
good in the past on calling the price of oil. Worldwide growth will surely pick
up again and with it the demand for oil. Is the oil patch a good place to look

I posted a pretty in-depth post on REITs and nobody responded. I'm not
complaining - the lack of response confirmed what I will develop below - that
these stocks are in the "neglect phase".

The sector is objectively cheap. There is asset value to back that statement up
and to cushion downside in a bear market. Earnings still growing, and supported
by long term leases. Plus a 7 or 8% dividend yield to keep you busy until they
rebound. I am a very conservative real estate investor who did vulture real
estate investing professionally through the bottom in 1993. This does not look
like a top to me. There is not enough construction out there for me to be
worried. Things were getting toppy during the summer, but the August shock
scared away alot of the new construction, leading to what looks like a nice
equilibrium in most sectors and regions.

Another data point. Merrill Lynch ran a very insightful conference call on the
group yesterday with the most respected REIT analyst and there were 70
call-ins. The analyst said that a year ago there would have been 200-300
callers.

My point here is that a characteristic of a great value investment where you
may be a little early (though here the dividend yield makes that less of a
"risk"), is a neglect phase. That's where I believe we are with the REITs now.
Investors, whether value or growth, are completely uninterested. But the
companies just keep chugging along and producing healthy earnings. And their
properties aren't going anywhere. You aren't going to hit homeruns in this
sector, but a low-risk 10-20% move in a year on top of an 8% dividend is, in
the words of a seasoned old value investor who signs my paychecks, "better than
a sharp stick in the eye." I exited this sector for the most part last summer,
but this is a place I will be putting money in the next few months.

I like my choices better.
PSA -- sure is a clearcut mention in media articles I see. I prefer UHAL

Chelsea Realty (CCG). Traffic jams at some of their properties?
Try MLS. Factory outlets cum entertainment centers. No. 2 draw in Florida (or
so I've read) after Disneyland. I say designed right --with no traffic jams (so
I've read). Close to a 10% dividend yield.

Further, I don't understand the subjective criteria you apparently think are
critical for success in your selections. CLP: "most honest... management". EGP:
"These guys are good people". LHO: "I can personally vouch for management's
honesty". So you are saying honesty is vital and you are comfortable with their
honesty - and I infer then, that since I certainly cannot interview management,
that therefore I should have to trust your judgment? (I will assume YOU are
honest of course -g-.) And you have a way of evaluating honesty of management?
And you've 'tested' everyone in management who possibly could be dishonest and
so might hurt the stockholders?

Jim and Paul,
I've been lurking here for a while, since I'm anxiously looking for some value
plays. I've put some of your REIT recommendations on my watch list. But I have
a couple of questions:

1. When the bubble breaks, are these REIT's going to hold up much better in
terms of asset value and payout? I notice CLP, CCG, and PSA all dropped
considerably during the July-October period when we were starting to feel like
a bear market. Asset-backing in the REITs can still depreciate in value, which
would happen if this 94 month economic expansion falters. If this happens, do
these particular companies have a history of paying dividends thru the down
cycle?
(If there is a site which provides a history of the payouts going WAY back
since the last downturn, would like to know --otherwise, a trip to the library
to check out Value-Line or Moody's?)

2. What am I missing here: when I look at these stocks on Yahoo, I see most
with earnings/share MUCH less than dividend/share. How is this sustained over
time?

I'll tell you, if I could get something close to a guaranteed 8-9% going
forward for the next 12-18 months, I'd take it right now!! So I'm interested in
hearing your reply.

In agreement totally - bought Sunstone Hotel (SSI) last October. I like it
better than Lasalle (LHO), but only because it is bigger, and thus more
diversified. Dividend on SSI is well covered by FFO. I recall reading once
where the only instance that the dividend would not hold would be if the
lodging segment had occupancy rates drop more than they ever had in the past 15
years (this is from memory, and the facts may not be totally correct).
Basically, business would need to fall totally out of bed (no pun intended) for
the dividend not to hold. It still trades at a significant discount to NAV.
Risks are overbuilding, which I have heard has abated somewhat (this makes some
sense, as the currency often used for new builds is stock i.e. the proceeds
from secondaries - well, there haven't been that many secondaries, because of
depressed stock prices), and a general slowdown in the economy.
I recall that The Mad Bomber, Ken Heebner, at one time was quite bullish on SSI
prospects, and owned the stock. I would suspect (but don't know for certain)
and hope that he still holds the stock. Does anyone know what his holdings are?
One sees his adds a lot on CNBC - the CGM Realty Fund, I believe.
And, fellow value investors, on another matter, what I mentioned about PMOR

<<2. What am I missing here: when I look at these stocks on Yahoo, I see most

GAAP earnings is not the way to look at a REIT because of the accounting for
depreciation. This is why real estate was always used as a tax shelter, because
you could generate tax losses (negative net income) but still have very
positive cash flow. Depreciation is often a non-economic charge in the real
estate world - a property often appreciates instead. So look at cash flow, not
earnings.

If you go back to the last downturn in 1991-94, you are going to find that none
of these REITs existed. What were called REITs then were a different animal,
and will be a misleading comparison. What I look at is leverage - real estate
owners went into the last downturn with 90% debt, and lots of them got
completely wiped out. Be careful with REITs that have debt/capital of much over
50%.

Your point about safety on the downside, given their lousy performance in
August, is well taken. A lot of us REIT fans were VERY surprised when they
dropped with the market. So no promises there, but intuitively I cannot imagine
REITs paying the yields they are paying taking the full brunt of a bear market.

One additional caveat on REITs. They are boring beyond belief. I tend to get
bored out of my REITs long before I get scared out of them.

REITs Jim, I had asked your opinion on ETT on a recent post...13% dividend
yield, major risk factor is large exposure to GHV [One of Paul's positions at
one time], but Merrill report indicates dividend coverage is good [139% vs 125%
for healthcare and 136% for the overall REIT universe] and insiders are buying
GHV pretty heavy. There's some good posts on yahoo GHV area on ETT. I'm long
since early this month. Not without risk, but looked like a good value to my
untrained eye. Would love a 2nd or 3rd opinion.
Also looked at GRT with 12.7% dividend but payout ration of 2x and high debt
ratios stopped my analysis in it's tracks.
Besides retail is going to be hurt by the rise in internet sales..demand for
retail space isn't going away, but it's going to be significantly affected IM0.

repost of something on the ag tractor business I posted on another thread.
Seemed relevant here too. In the spirit of full disclosure, I cover these
professionally, so I know the managements well and have visited dealers and
driven combines and all that. But nevertheless, I will admit that I have done
nothing but lose my clients' money so far. I bought NH at 18, CSE at 47, 28 and
22; and DE at 31.

RESPONSE TO SOMETHING ON AGCO
Agco is cheap. As are its three major competitors, Deere, Case and New Holland.
We are just beginning an ag recession. That is not the time to buy the company
with the worst balance sheet in the industry. That would be Agco. Case's
balance sheet also troubles me, but its core products are closer to Deere than
any of the competitors.

My pick here would be to pay up for the best of the best, when you can buy it
cheap - that would be Deere. At $31 (be patient and wait for that price - it
will bounce off there again) the long term risk is minimal no matter what the
market does. Or if you want to be a cheapskate, buy New Holland. Solid
products, solid management, very conservative balance sheet, and a rock solid
4% dividend yield. I own New Holland personally, and own DE, CSE and NH
professionally. Expect to be bored out of your mind if you buy NH, however.
Peter Lynch said again and again that boring is good. If he's right on that, NH
is going to triple.

The way I look at it is that if you bet on a horse that survives in this
industry, you are going to at least double your money when the recovery comes.
I would not bet on that being next year, but within 3 years is pretty safe.
Within 5 years is as close to certainty as you get in the investment world. A
double in five years is a 15% IRR return, plus dividends. Thats your downside
if you play this sector right (i.e. buy now near a low and don't get scared out
of them, and forget about them until everybody loves them again, even though
that might be 2004). So how can you be sure the horse you bet on finishes the
race? Look at the balance sheet. In order of safety, #1 is DE, a close #2 (and
much much cheaper) is NH, and a distant 3 and 4 are CSE and AG. And that would
be precisely my ranking of them as investments at this point.

Hope this is helpful.

Hi Wallace. re: JCP. Dividend is not secure IMO. But last week I added to my
'96 position, primarily betting that it will not be cut.

I first discussed JCP in the first 100 posts of the Value thread. There was
some discussion about whether NIKE was a buy: I liked JCP (country's biggest
seller of NIKE product in '96-97). And for a while JCP stock did better than
NIKE stock. But in retrospect, I should have been buying and discussing WMT
which went up 3.5x (wow!) since then- while JCP is down below high 40's (where
it was in 1996). Market share growth and business focus (WMT) sure beat muddled
value. A Buffett lesson somewhere in there I think.)

I've also added some comments on the JCP thread.

Hi Carmine: re: CDD. uhhh, I dunno. I like Northrop (NOC). Stock at its low for
the year--about 60 and I've been a buyer this week. I've been buying down from
80 level to 60 level though, and maybe more downside is coming. Maybe NOC's not
the same industry exactly as CDD, but with cf about 3-4, p/b about 1.5, psr
about .5 -- these numbers are better than CDD.

I've also looked at HXL (somebody on thread recommends it-- looks a little high
to me (the stock price, not the guy -g-), ORB (too high -- -g- that's the stock
price again -g- not the suborbital satellites), BEAV (too high, but maybe), WYG
and PCP (too high on WYG-- I like though that they are so dominant in the
forging of those large fuselages), and FA (looks attractive to me here). CDD's
Howmet div-- gas turbine engines -- if they are competitors to AlliedSignal's
business, ALD is a VERY strong competitor under Bossidy's leadership. Almost
would rather step up for ALD.

I think these stocks will all move if and when Boeing comes back. For another
play on this, you might look at very undervalued IMO, TIE (which I own
unprofitably). I also have a position in thinly traded FAVS, an aircraft engine
parts supplier and rebuilder. I am a buyer of the stock at current price (4 3/8

Jim, I recently traded NH bought at $10, as I thought a trade was all it was
worth at this time. Do you have an opinion on where historically it has paid to
buy these cyclical stocks -- when everyone
knows results are going to get worse and they are down a ton, or when they are
actually reporting the lousy numbers? If the latter, then I would say we should
wait for the poor comparisons and START buying when they do not elicit any
further down moves to speak of in the market on the bad news.

By the way, NH (my favorite) has exposure to Brazil, whether it is
disproportionately large I do not know -- but it may be a source of further
downgrading of its expectations.

The ag stocks have stopped hitting new lows as the news continues to get worse.
I see absolutely no catalyst for things to get better any time soon, but by the

or so. Value investors will never agree about whether it is more important to
get in near the bottom, or if it is a better strategy to wait until the stock

The golf club industry is in real trouble, with imitators and knockoffs
slashing margins. Meanwhile, demand began to fall last year as just about
everybody who would spend $300 for a driver already had one. I started
researching Calloway last week, and then it jumped 25% on Friday before I could
get my homework done. Maybe there's something there, maybe it was just too
cheap. Coastcast looks cheap, as does Calloway. But they should look cheap,
because past margins are probably going to fall dramatically. I know Mike has
looked at this industry before as well. The reason I was looking at Calloway
however, is that I think these are good for a bounce in the spring as people
start thinking about golf again, and the new products start to get hyped.

Jim,

I've bought into Callaway recently at 10 5/8 - it's in the VSN Fund at my web
site. To me, this is a 10 minute analysis, a la Timberland or Midway. Massive
insider buying, premier name. Decent technical support. No debt. And with
spring coming, well, why not buy it at such a low market cap? Every golfer I
know (remember, I'm a doctor, so there's a few) seems apoplectic when I tell
them what's happened to Callaway stock. The faith in the brand has already been
established among golfers, even though Wall Street has lost all faith.
Sometimes value investing is as easy as being contrarian, which comes naturally
to some of us ;-) There's just something to a story that makes sense in 10
minutes.

excess capacity [and I think the downtrend is saying there is] and it's costly

I thought it looked cheap when I bought it and I KNOW it was cheaper still when
I sold it for a tax loss, both at higher levels than here. And this during the

Mike, FWIW, I'm a golfer. I play Callaway except for the putter. Great Big
Bertha (GBB) driver, GBB 3 (which I just ordered yesterday), '96 vintage Big
Bertha irons, which the company would like people to believe are obsolete. I do
believe that those who have played them do become very loyal to a great brand.
I have no desire to buy any other brand.
Negatives:
I feel they stretched after GBB to entice players into the next greatest
product - the Biggest Big Bertha, the tungsten-titanium irons, for example. I
don't believe either of those were much of a success. Last year they introduced
the X-12 irons and Steelhead woods at a lower price point, with lower margins.
X-12 did well, Steelheads too early to tell. The Hawkeye wood launch ($500
list, about $375-$400 typical retail) just started. Steelhead look and
purported advantages did not impress me, X-12s are a very nice club, but my
"old" Bertha irons were just fine thank you. Hawkeyes look just like the
Steelhead, except they are titanium, and have some tungsten plug. Just didn't
see how they could be that much better for $125 bucks more per club than GBB.
I suppose the point I am trying to make is that the company has run into a wall
in marketing the next, greatest, product to golfers who at one time were eager
to get the next thing that would make the ball go further and bring lower
scores into their bags.

I agree on the general unattractiveness of Calloway. In my opinion, if one of
these kinds of companies gets to be one where its growth comes from
demographics only and replacement buying of limited scope, as you note, they
are usually poor long term investments -- unless the price gets to be so low
that the company could and plans to eventually buy all the stock back.

A more recent buy is Michael Rome of Lazard Equity Fund.

IMO TOY is being squeezed on one side by e-toy types and on other side by WMT

You're right, Paul, Toys R Us is in the crosshairs of the e-tailers. But that

because they have been abysmal allocators of capital.

I talked to management recently and learned that they are refusing to be "the
warehouse of the industry" anymore. Speaks volumes about their past when they
tolerated that. If you don't see inventory turns increasing soon, get out of
the stock. If inventories do what they are supposed to, I would hang on until

Hi. Just an intro and a thanks from a lurker who just joined.

The price seemed steep but keeps going up. And since I made 20 times the price
on one of the recommendations here, I figured it was time to join up so I can
contribute as well.

Of what has been discussed here as well as others I consider value stocks, I'm
long:
FLYT BNHN DSWLF HIHOF MWY NH USU

To Paul and other followers of FLYT, are you out yet? It is up 75% from when it
was discussed here. I think that still leaves selling for less than cash minus
liabilities.

My expertise is in securitization within finance companies, so if you ever have
questions I can help with, ask away.

Adams Golf - sorry, my database had not updated, so I was looking at Friday's
close rather than yesterday's. It jumped 10% yesterday to 4 1/4, not 3 5/8 as I
said in my last post. Still cheap, but man is that annoying. I keep winding up
one day behind these golf stocks.

ADGO is interesting with about $2 1/2 per share in cash. However, my general
issue with stocks like this is that you almost always find that the trailing 12
months earnings is a loss, they are currently losing money, industry conditions
show many competing products that are similar, and an unclear view as to when
if ever things will get better.

That seems to be the case here and that makes a value stock for those few of us
who know the business well enough to make an informed decision. What's the
catalyst to change industry conditions?

Hi Mike: re UBB and funds. I see that at least one mutual fund manager who I've
reported as recommending UBB -- it turn out now-- he says now he has been
hedged on the rial-but he never said that in any of his media interviews. Much
easier to be bullish on UBB when you are in a hedged position. I believe UBB
holds a lot of Brazilian debt; I don't know where the rial will settle; and I
don't understand what turmoil it will cause businesses and individuals. While
this may be factored already into the price of UBB, UBB has traded below 8 in
the first scare on devaluation. I would rather back off now and reenter at a
later and maybe lower price.
Mike, seems like that's what you've been doing with some of the other stocks
we've both owned - TIE, etc. - and IMO, that's been much more effective (having
an exit plan on bad news) than what I've been doing (holding as they
disintegrate).

With the UBB funds:
I've also sold a small amount again of BMY (which I have been wrongly peeling
off scale-up from 44 - I should have just been holding this one- that's all I
needed to do. --Funny how a position or sale in one stock can have more of a
potential or actual affect on a portfolio than a combined total of 25 other
stocks).
I've made purchases in past few days which you've seen posted here. Also have
started a position in Kerr McGee (KMG) as a relative dividend play. And adding
to defense contractor Northrup (NOC), electronics distributor Marshall
Industries (MI), and entertainment stock Dave & Buster's (DANB).

Dan Meleney: Yes, I still own FLYT. It was recommended by a Roger Thrash in
July of last year, posts 4431 I think, and my comments on 4436. Essentially it
was a net-net (from my brief analysis),and I decided to add it to a small
package of net-nets that I've bought. I thought the company not only didn't
even have a business, but the business plan they were proposing was crazy.
Later on, after I bought,there was some reported news of a possibility that
maybe some of the wiring or product they might have installed in the Swiss
airliner that crashed might have been related to the alleged problem that might
have contributed to causing that Swiss plane to crash. But of course you know
all this already. Anyway, I am surprised this stock is trading higher than my
buy price. Do you have a current opinion on FLYT?

re your expertise in finance/securitization: I currently own at a loss, UC. Do
you have an opinion on it?

You bought a stock from this thread that went up 20x? Of course I am interested
in that stock, but also who was the person who posted that stock and are there
any more recommendations that person has made that we might revisit? Appreciate
your comments. Paul Senior

Paul, about UC and FLYT

I haven't followed it but I'll look at UC.

The stock that paid for SI was FLYT. I meant it went up 20 times the price of
SI, not of what the stock price was. I bought at 5/8, before the 1:3 split. I
put 7K in and it is worth about 12K now. Rounding that 5K gain down a bit and
dividing by the $200 SI fee is the 20x. So I figured it was time to stop
mooching and do my share.

BTW, SI is switching from the flat fee to $60/6 months.

In my DD on FLYT, I estimated I was getting 1 1/4 for my 5/8. Reverse split
that's 3 3/4. Current price is about 3 1/4, but I'm concerned that they're
about to throw money into black holes rather than give it back to us. I'm
willing to lose the gain from any tax loss benefits that tehy might realize
with the right acquisition. I'm selling 1/3 today. I'll probably sell the rest
over the next few weeks.

If only we could find lots of ugly no-brainers like the buy FLYT was. Perhaps
watching for "going out of business" signs from recent IPOs would work. I
wonder if there are a fair number that realize their technology won't work and
they stop their R&D before the cash runs out.

Don't know which stock you have ADGO mixed up with. This company made 54 cents
last summer. It trades at something like 2 or 3 times trailing earnings is you
strip out the cash. Are those earnings growing at a nice predictable 15%? Of
course not. So that's where the fun begins.

I traded PSO for a point or two twice. That makes about 3 points on a $6 stock.
I'll take that. Why doesn't that sound like me? If I start getting that
predictable, I'm doing something wrong. You will find I sell with a hairtrigger
target in some cases but very reluctantly in others. I have no desire to
roundtrip a low quality business like PSO over and over again if I can make the
same money two or three times. If the thing takes a moonshot to 15, I won't
complain because that was not why I bought it. I would be satisfied with the
no-risk 30% I had targeted. And I at least think I stated publicly that I was
out of the stock if that's what you're getting at - I try not to recommend a
stock and then leaving people hanging long after I'm gone - in this kind of
forum it can be tough though.

Warning: long post. re: Adams Golf. I think some of you might really like this
one. But if you're not into long posts, stop now.

Check the financials on EDGAR for the earnings numbers, and you will get a much
different picture. (I am going to go partially balistic here, but it is not
directed at Jeff Bash. If he had really gone at me about my reasoning on the
investment it would be, but he just posted one observation from the 10 second
drill we all do regularly when we see somebody post a ticker on this thread -
it is the advocate's responsibility to make the case, which I am about to do.)

First I want to point out something about Yahoo, Baseline and all those other
"services". The dirty little secret there is EVERYBODY USES THEM FOR THEIR
INITIAL SCREENS. If a number is wrong, or just misleading because the robot
does not understand some glitch in the financials, you've got an advantage over
99% of investors if you notice the error. This is called a market inefficency.
Market inefficencies are why value investors bother to wake up in the morning.
Understanding what these databases systematically get wrong is something we all
might want to spend some time on. ADGO is an extreme example. Of course this
will do none of us any good if we use the same faulty sources. God created the
10-K for a reason.

It boggles my mind how often I hear my colleagues - well paid institutional
investors - argue with my analysis of an SEC financial statement because some
computer database on their laptop shows a different number. This is a dirty
little secret of the investment management business. The guys managing your
mutual fund - I would bet even odds - don't read the basic SEC financials of
half their stocks before they buy them. Call me stodgy, but that is inexcusable
for any investor, institutional or individual. Especially institutional. They
don't tell you that in their quarterly letters, do they?

I have never used the Yahoo "fundamentals" database, but I just found it to
figure out where the devil Jeff found such a wrong trailing 12 months earnings
number for ADGO. When I saw it it just made me laugh - once again, not at Jeff,
but at Yahoo posting these numbers as if they are fact. The -0.37 figure is
their 1997 loss. That number is a year old. Before it was a public company.
Certainly relevant, but not if you're looking for a trailing 12 month number.
Lets take one more step. The prospectus shows that the earnings for 1997 were
grossly distorted by a huge one-time expense. I could easily argue that 1997
earnings were actually a PROFIT of $0.60 per share. That means by my
calculations trailing 12 month net income is $1.17 per share. (I have been
doing this on the fly, bouncing between EDGAR and this message, WOW, this stock
is even cheaper than I thought! Before I did this, I thought trailing 12 was
half what it is!) The Baseline database (the crutch for lazy institutional
investors) misses half of ADGO's cash on the balance sheet because it is
accounted for as long term marketable securities - so in their database it
looks like fixed assets! And on Baseline's cash flow statement, believe it or
not, they call it capital expenditure when ADGO invested its cash in longer
term securities! Talk about getting a distorted picture of a business!

This all boils down to three points:
1) You've got a $4 1/4 stock with $2.75 in cash and substantial trailing
earnings.
2) Yahoo and the similar crutches institutional investors use to avoid reading
SEC documents are often very wrong. I am not playing holier than though. WHAT I
AM SAYING IS THIS IS A MARKET INEFFICIENCY. COULD THIS BE THE REASON WHY THIS
STOCK IS SO CHEAP? THAT WHEN I DO MY [NEAR-NET/NET + PROFITABLE] SCREENS IT
DOES NOT COME UP? AND IF IT DID IT WOULD NOT TRADE AT THIS PRICE BECAUSE 10
MILLION INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS WOULD HAVE FOUND IT SIX MONTHS AGO?

I agree with you on the industry - its miserable in the long term. But I have
no intention of investing in Adams Golf for the long term. This is pure Ben
Graham if I can nail down the analysis. I'm not there yet. There are questions
I want to ask this company. I also want to see the December balance sheet to
see how much cash they burned to launch this new product. Their past use of
capital leads me to infer "not enough to matter". This opportunity looks good
enough that I will sleep on the idea of buying half a position tomorrow at the
open.

It looks a lot like a textbook Graham play with the added benefit of an
industry with manic investor psychology. Put those two together, and it means
"low risk potential triple in six months". That is very different from PSO. Or
maybe I'm missing something huge. I know the industry sucks. I have my Graham
hat on here, not my Buffett hat.

One last thing. I may buy this tomorrow for the reasons above. But there is one
reason why I would wait. And if you want to do your own homework to check my
facts, it is not fair for me to post the good things without the bad one. I
have heard that product returns under warranty are huge. Just a rumor, and it
does not show up in the financials. It is certainly something I will ask the
company, but they are in a blackout until they release earnings next week.

Sorry for the long post - I have never done a post while I was doing research.
If it reads like a stream of consciousness, that's why. But if it makes us
money, who cares?

Substantive feedback is extremely welcome. Has anybody used their products?
Does anybody know the new products? Does anybody get a different read from the
financials than I got? If I'm wrong tell me now before I suck a lot of other
people into an error.

I HAVE NOT DONE THE HOMEWORK I WOULD CONSIDER SUFFICIENT FOR A CONSERVATIVE
INVESTMENT. CHECK MY FACTS, AND DIG DEEPER. OTHERWISE I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT IT IF THIS GOES TO 2 AFTER THE EARNINGS REPORT NEXT WEEK.

I think I made it the first point of my long post, and if I didn't I'll say it
again, I was not disparaging Jeff's research at all, because his post clearly
was not intended to be in-depth research. On this forum, a post is always
directed as a "response", and his post just happened to be the one I linked
off. If my post disparaged Jeff in any way, I sincerely apologize.

And obviously the warranty issue could be huge for a product like this. I take
the rumor seriously, and that is why I included it before I posted the message.
I have not had a chance to grill management yet, but the fact that it does not
show up in historic financials gives me some, but not complete, comfore.

Paul, re UC

I need to review the 10Q, but I went through S&P and Zach's reports. This looks
interesting.

The keys are all off balance sheet related to the $6B of managed portfolio:
Questions I'll be asking myself are:
Are the securitizations term deals or CP deals?
What's the potential hedge risk?
What's the servicing fee? (this could be a significant source of future income)
Where is the contingent obligation to repurchase? How big is it?
Hom much of the receivables are really overcollateralization for the
securitizations?
Have writeoffs and delinquencies stabilized?
How are writeoffs carried on books? At what % of market value?

My first glance tells me there is a reasonable margin of safety between the
book value and the price. DD will be needed to see if it is enough to cover the
risk.

I'll look at this like FLYT but with one off balance sheet item:
(liquidation value of assets MINUS all liabilities MINUS my additional estimate
of unreserved future losses) / # shares to compare to the current price.

Are you looking at this as other than an asset play?

Jim, I did not take your post as disparaging me. But thanks for your
sensitivity anyway. This is one of the most polite and dignified threads
around.

My key point on the returns was not the financial impact, since they have a
strong balance sheet, but the issue that it is not a good sign in a fragmented
industry with a tough time differentiating one product from another to have a
company with possibly an also ran product line.
Enough said.

Somewhat OT, can you believe what this "analyst" is saying about E-bay? Raising

Here is a misnomer for this thread - a small biotech "value" stock --
GZMO ($2 1/2):

-This is a stock that tracks (like the old GM class E stock, for
example) the performance of the described business units that are part
of the $4 billion market cap parent company GENZ. Company has access to capital
and resources of parent company like no other small company its size in its
field, so if they make progress will probably not face running out of money. It
is not an independent company.

-Current market cap is something like $30 plus million, which is
mispriced if the research initiatives and business make any sense.
Probably a lot of selling by institutions who got this stock last fall
as a dividend on GENZ helped knock it down from $8 to 2 ($15 12 months
high is wrong), since many such institutions probably can't hold such a stock.

-The parent company in structuring this company retired all the significant
outstanding debt related to the sub's businesses by issuing stock at a stated
value of $6+.

-The FDA now has a fast track strategy for cancer drugs, which in effect makes
cancer research a more attractive field relative to ROI.

-The collaborations with companies and research institutions are top rate. My
daughter just got a PhD in cancer research and says they are working where the
action is.

I have never considered small biotech companies because all they do is burn
money. This is no different in that respect except it seems to cover an awful
lot of bases in an important area, with a corporate structure that seems to
offer a good shot at realizing the benefits of its research if successful - and
a very low valuation.

Thus, this is the only microcap biotech I have ever seen fit to buy, at current
levels. Anyone interested should read the 4/98 S3 at GENZ on EDGAR (very
complete) and all the sections of following GENZ 10Q's relating to GZMO.

My view is that at this market cap ANY material announced success
will deliver a 3-5 bagger.
