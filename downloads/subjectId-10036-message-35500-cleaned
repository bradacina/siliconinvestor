Hi Grommit

It seems like one of the last undervalued REIT preferrds caught fire today and
is up over 4%. The current price reflects a post recovery high and matches it's
price on 9/29/08. Can you guess the company? Its the First Industrial 7.25%
preferrds both J series and K series. At the current price of $15.30 for the
FRpJ, the yield is now 11.8%

It appears that the common shares still have a ways to go to match their 52wk
high. Of your listed group, HRP is the closest to it's recovery high.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BDN,LXP,CLP,HRP,DRE,FR,AHT,DDR,MPW&d=s

The YOY comparisons get easier as the posted highs will reflect post crash
levels. The best relative comparison is to use the first week of September 2008
prices as the normal base period.

I am cautious to put any new money into the common shares but with the yields
down on all of the preferrds, it appears that the risk/reward may now be with
some of the better positioned common shares. It was suggested by an analyst
that those companies that were able to raise new capital w/o too much dilution
are better positioned for the long term. Good management will use the new
capital to pay down debt and purchase new properties (50 cents on the dollar).

I know that BDN raised new capital recently. Do you recall what others on your
list completed successful debt or 2nd common share offerings?

"What domestic producer benefits the most from oil going to $100 a barrel?" Not
only do I not know, I don't know where to get the answer. Maybe Big Dog's
thread? I'd guess someone really has to know the sector, and specific stocks in
detail too -- proven/probable reserves, hedges - amounts and times, etc.
================================
I am buying, buying and buying and trying to find those oil/gas stocks where
company trades below stated book value, has lots of probable/proved reserves,
not high d/e ratio, and preferably good cash position. (One example might be
USEG.) Still scary because of oil/gas volatility and because margin-of-safety
can disappear fast with cash falling and debt increasing as company spends to
acquire and/or develop oil/gas properties.

If anybody here knows of such stocks or can answer Madharry's query, please
post. (Aside: Fwiw, COP with a p/bk at 1.15 now. That's pretty low compared
with yearly averages in past ten years.)

I do think there is an interesting value story in these radio stocks (if you
believe radio advertising will rebound some in the coming months and years).
CMLS made 0.35 last quarter and selling at 1.70 and ROIAK that made 0.12 and
selling at 0.90. Personally I think CMLS at 3 times the ROIAK eps is worth more
than double what ROIAK sells for (although the buy back angle is interesting).
ETM also sells at 5x 2010 earnings per yahoo. But if you look at EV\EBITDA not
dirt cheap (at least based on trailing twelve months)and they certainly have a
lot of debt.

Today's Portfolio Adjustments:

1) Picked up a full position of FRpK to add to my FRpJ based on today's
announcement by the company to Offer 12.5 Million Shares of Common Stock. The
current yield is now just over 12% down from as high as 18%! Still a pretty
good return compared to the other REIT preferred shares.

I expect this series of preferrds to move even higher such that the yield is
similar to the other REIT preferrds or about 9%. These preferrds should then
sell around $20/share reflecting a 33% increase from today's close at
$15/share.

I sold 10% of my GNMA bond fund (yielding 4.42%) currently at or near it's all
time high to finance this trade.

2) Peeled off a few shares of HPQ to finance buys in MSFT and INTC. HPQ is
selling at a PE of 15.97 and only yielding 0.7%. The forward PE for MSFT is
13.48 and yielding 2.00% and INTC carries a forward PE 15.97 and yielding
2.90%.

I believe HPQ is fairly valued while MSFT and INTC are a bit undervalued and
have more global reach than HPQ.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=HPQ,INTC,MSFT&d=s

I have owned HPQ for many years but according to this five year chart, it might
be a good time to sell a bit of the HPQ and move that money into both MSFT &
INTC.

928;compare=hpq+msft;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;
ogscale=on

3) Peeled off a few GOLD shares AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AU) that I bought in
8/2008 for $25 and booked $40. A 60% gain in 13 months.

4% of the taxable portfolio remains in Gold and Platinum stocks, 18% of the
portfolio is in mineral and other base metal resources (excluding oil & NG) and
about 35% is in integrated Oil companies, Ng, midstream collection, pipelines &
distribution companies and 11% in different domestic & International utilities.

=========================================================

My theme is to lock in higher yield using the preferrds, utilities and good
equity dividend payers. I continue to focus on these sectors: (1) NG and
midstream distributors, (2) technology and (3) utilities.

With today's buys, the overall portfolio dividend (& bond) annual return now
yields 5%-6% up about 100 - 150 basis points from the previous quarter
holdings. One half of the income is qualified dividend income.

I continue to hold 20% cash,bonds & REIT preferrds.

Im sure you are doing great but my philosophy has been to focus on gold and

done well for the past 2 years despite the surges in the prices of gold and
silver. I believe that this was primarily due to deleveraging of the hedge
funds that invested in those junior mining companies. I continue to be patient.
my ira portfolios which contain the bulk of those shares declined 61% in 2008
and were up over 60% in 2009 but are still way down from 12/31/08. I would like
to have more of my portfolio in high yielding instruments but I believe that
the oil and gas mlps offer more long term protection than the reit preferreds
although 12% is pretty good. and it may be quite awhile before we have real

Book value for E&P companies represents historical costs and is not all that
relevant. A better measure would be EV/barrel of oil equivalent or even better
EV/NPV(proved reserves) which is what MCDEP tries to calculate.

When comparing COP to CVX, it is clear that COP has much more debt. When
looking at EV/EBITDA (again a poor measure because reserves have a different
lifetime), then COP with a 3.7 looks a bit cheaper than CVX with 4.4.

COP has not been an efficient allocator of capital in the past, imo - they
spend more than their cash flow even when crude prices were rising. They did
poor acquisitions (BR) and I generally consider tham a high cost producer. As
such, COP will do better than CVX if crude & gas prices rise, if they stay the
same or fall, CVX will do better, imo.

I own neither one right now, I am not bullish on crude.

seems that somehow his NPV calculations are arbitrary, in particular when it
comes to foreign oil companies. His model has problems adjusting for different
taxations, which matters quite a bit in countries like Russia where these can
change quickly. He also overvalues Norwegian companies (Statoil) where 80%+ of
the profits are taxed away, imo. i have also seen erratic changes in

ct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest automaker, is
“grasping for salvation” as it predicts a second straight annual loss, said
President Akio Toyoda.

“The salvation for the company isn’t me,” Toyoda, the grandson of the
carmaker’s founder, said today. “We have to listen to our customers and make
better cars.” Toyoda, 53, became president in June.

The automaker is one step away from “capitulation to irrelevance or death,”
Toyoda said in a speech to journalists, citing a study of how companies fail.
Toyota has forecast a record loss of 450 billion yen ($5 billion) in the year
ending March after the worldwide recession pummeled car demand.

Toyota has gone through the phases of “hubris born of success,” “undisciplined
pursuit of more” and “denial of risk and peril,” according to Toyoda, who cited
Jim Collins, the author of “How the Mighty Fail.”

The company will sell about 7.3 million vehicles this year, Toyoda said,
compared with 8.97 million in 2008. Toyota’s sales have plunged 28 percent in
the first nine months of this year in the U.S., traditionally its most
profitable market. The yen’s 7.4 percent gain against the dollar in the third
quarter is also eroding earnings from exports.

“The yen is at a very severe level and just by increasing sales won’t make
Toyota profitable,” Toyoda said.

Toyota shares fell 3.7 percent to 3,380 yen at the close of trading in Tokyo.

PRETTY SOON WE MIGHT ALL BE GRASPING FOR SALVATION.

Face Masks Offer Protection Against Spreading H1N1

Best evidence suggests that the H1N1 virus is transmitted through large
droplets from sneezes or coughs that travel through the air and land on

Because the risk of transmission of the virus skyrockets with every sneeze and
cough, face masks are a vital tool in fighting H1N1. Wearing a high-quality,
FDA-cleared face mask that covers the mouth and nose can reduce the risk of
transmitting the virus.

A report from the Institute of Medicine states, "In the event of pandemic
influenza, supplies of effective vaccines and antiviral medications are likely
to be inadequate to treat a very large number of affected individuals.
Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions will be important, including the
use of respiratory protection through respirators, medical masks or both."

Seth Segel, Executive Vice President at Cantel Medical said, "We know that
masks provide one of the simplest, most cost-effective infection prevention
tools in the fight against spreading the flu. While seeing someone wearing a
mask on a crowded subway can be startling, during flu season, it should
actually provide you with a level of comfort. The more people who wear masks,
the lower the risk of transmitting the disease, especially in densely populated
areas."

To keep pace with the global demand for its face masks, Crosstex recently
expanded production of its entire face mask line. In particularly high demand
are Crosstex Ultra Face Masks, which provide one of the highest levels of
filtration available. This surge in orders of face masks, as well as other flu
related prevention supplies such as SaniTyze?&#174; alcohol-based Hand
Sanitizer and surface disinfectant wipes, has come from distributors,
healthcare practitioners, private industry, hospitals and government agencies
worldwide.

Cantel Medical Corp. (NYSE: CMN) is a company dedicated to infection prevention
and control. It provides a wide array of products and services to specialty
healthcare markets.

Utilities. I am surprised how the many utility stocks I am following seem to
rise and fall together in the past few days. Today, for example, except for one
(GXP, up 5 cents), my screen shows all others down right now. And it's a
diverse mix - geographical,gas, electric, regulated, non-reg.

Somebody mentioned utility stocks rise and fall with the price of oil, and that
seems to be so, right now.

If so, I'm not thrilled with that. Just adds more volatility to the portfolio
since I'm holding a significant amount of oil company shares.

 Utilities. I am surprised how the many utility stocks I am following seem to
rise and fall together in the past few days.

The whole market is correlated with crude prices lately so I would not expect
utilities to be an exception. So far the utility stocks I own have shown less
volatility than most others.

I am wondering who high the percentage of crude related stocks in your

The tanker stocks that move the slick stuff are very weak lately. TNP might be

re XOM - this is an interesting graph. I remember looking in 1983 at some oil
stocks, XOM, Chevron, Mobil, Union Oil (?) and Gulf Oil. the article was
claiming that those stocks were selling for 1/2 their asset value which was
probably correct. That in connection with quite low oil prices (that went even
lower) was setting them up for a good performance.

Even then i remember that XOM was the most expensive one, based on PE, discount
to asset value etc. but they were also the best managed. the long term chart
shows what can be accomplished when a company executes for a long time in a
mostly unexciting business.

Nestle is another one of these LT performers. I remember looking at them in
1981, the shares were trading in Switzerland and costing about 3300 Francs.
That was more than I could afford back then so i couldn't buy. I have some
shares stashed away that I bought in 2003 or thereabouts - they are worth about
twice as much know even without accounting for dividends. I bought some
recently near the lows in my IRA account and probably keep those around for a
long time. A great company ever since i first looked at it more than 25 years

Is it smart to follow China Wealth fund? My impression is that they may buy
into companies to enhance China's influence (in raw materials and energy)
rather than optimize return.

In most cases government influence is seen as problematic and stocks go up if
the government sells their stake. Why should China Wealth involvement judged
differently?

Even that argument aside, i don't like the fact that they got a sweetheart deal
with Noble (10%+ discount to prevailing share price) at all. I would only get

Heritage Auctions in Dallas said Friday that a collector from Queens, N.Y., won
with a bid of $56,762.50. Dykstra and the New York Mets wrapped up that title
in Queens, at Shea Stadium.

There were 11 auction items related to Dykstra, and they sold for more than
$162,000.

Dykstra filed for bankruptcy protection in July, saying he owed more than $31

National all-property type index

There is the chart of the CRE index:
http://www.rcanalytics.com/derivatives_index.aspx

Excerpt:
 Notable Observations and Themes
•
The National — All Property Type Aggregate Index measured a 5.1% price decline
in the month of July. The index now stands 38.7% below the peak measured in
October 2007.
•
Overall market transaction volume by count declined this month to a low not
seen since 2001 following a slight uptick in the previous month. 74 repeat
sales transactions totaling $1.2 billion were used in calculating this month’s
index.
•
Of the four property types, apartments are holding up the best in the eastern
region with an annual drop of only 6.0%. In the same period, the national
apartment index declined 24.4%.
•
Southern apartments declined 44.2% in the past year. Apartment prices in this
region are now at their lowest level ever recorded by the CPPI.
•
Southern California saw large drops in the office and retail sector, with value
declines of 25.8% and 24.2%, respectively. Both sectors are underperforming the
nation.
•
All three office markets saw prices fall more than 20% over the past year. San
Francisco was the worst performer, declining 27.0%.
•
Florida apartments, like the southern apartment market overall, saw a dramatic
drop in prices over the past four quarters. With an annual decline of 39.8%,
apartment prices in Florida have now fallen almost 50% from the peak.

China Investment Corp. catching the attention of Australian Government. Not
sure why their Nobel Group Limited purchase would cause concern w/ Australian
Government as it is not a very big player when compared to BHP or Rio Tinto
(VALE). In fact, China is still one of the major buyers of iron ore (and other
minerals) from Australian owned companies.

Oct 04, 2009 (The Sydney Morning Herald - ABIX via COMTEX) -- The funds managed
by sovereign wealth group China Investment Corporation have grown from $US200bn
($A231bn) to in excess of $US300bn under the stewardship of Lou Jiwei. The
impact of the global financial crisis means the fund has gained new power as
overseas companies are seeking financial support from it. The latest investment
move though, on Hong Kong-based Noble Group, has encountered a hurdle due to
the latter's stakes in Australian resources businesses and the regulatory
concerns in that nation. This is adding to rising tension between the Chinese
and Australian governments.

Value tech stocks usually come in 3 flavors:

- Old-guard huge successful companies (your MSFT, INTC, NOK fall there). They
usually fall into value prices because people distrust "old" big tech and think
that someone newer will eat their lunch. Sometimes they are right, but
sometimes it IS a huge value, like was investing in IBM when it turned around.

- Old guard crappy companies that never found their groove (revenues, profits),
but may have technology. Novell, Borland of old falls there, as well as JAVA.
IMHO, these are very dangerous and not investable. However, you can get
occasional good gain if someone buys out this crap for their technology, like
it happened with Sun.

- New small companies that fall through the cracks. Something like GSIT some
time ago. These are usually companies for some reason not considered sexy by
growth and momo crowds. I.e. not "next Microsoft", "Google", etc. Here the
questions usually are: do you know something crowd doesn't? is the valuation
compelling enough that even with mediocre execution, the results could be fine?

An offshoot of the 3rd flavor are the "ignored" Chinese or other foreign tech
companies. I think the questions there are exactly the same, though risk may be
higher, but possibility of momo/growth runup is higher too.

Right now I hold MSFT, NOK, GRMN, GLW (if we consider it a tech), GAME, GRVY,
ITRN, ACTS.

RE:ATPG - The one thing that caught my eye in their presentation (page 4) was
that they achieved a "...98% success rate converting non-producing properties
to producing properties...". Can they continue to have this success rate? Do
they need this type of continued success rate on future wells to make that
$114.000/share price target?

There is just a bit too much leverage and debt for me but I suppose as a small
position in a large portfolio of assets could make sense especially w/ a three
bagger potential.

I do like their exposure to owning and operating off shore deep drilling rig
platforms. However they pay no established pattern of dividends but rather keep
and own a percentage of the on-going production stream.

SFL owns a few of the deep water drilling rigs and builds in a profit sharing
percentage that is added to their fixed return. The shareholder receives a
steady dividend (now around 10%). Their quarterly profit sharing amounts can
amount to as much as 25% of the annual dividend income paid.

When I look at these different energy asset plays, I find that it's all about
the proven reserves they have, how fast they can replace their reserves (based
on the company's previous record of success) and the income stream generated
from the active wells in operation. I was surprised to find that NG wells in
general can produce for a long time (as along as 20-30 years!).

I have bee researching Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB) and a sister company,
Williams Pipeline Partners L.P. (WMZ) a MLP with interests in their pipeline
operations. The MLP pays a 6% dividend, owns an interest in a very steady cash
flow stream from the pipeline (transportation) operation but has limited up
side from exploration or new NG well development.

If you want just the income (from the pipeline operations), you buy the MLP and
if you want exposure to the NG exploration, well development & production and
also own an interest in their network of pipelines, you buy WMB.

My preference is to own a huge diversified company like COP that owns a bit of
everything and does not have so much debit spread across a few potential high
production assets like ATPG. If ATPG hits their discovery wells, there is a
huge potential return.

ATPG. They buy proven oil properties from others and develop those assets.
They've spent big bucks developing a couple of projects, and these are
scheduled to come on-stream through 2012. It doesn't seem to me that they need
to acquire and develop more projects now, but that seems to be their business
model. Whether they continue that, and will remain 98 successful, I don't know.

I don't understand this 98% success number they're quoting. I see a couple of
big transformational bet-the-company projects; I don't know how they figure
there were 49 of 50 actions that were successful (98%) conversions.

They reduce debt by partnering or selling off parts of their business
(pipelines, for example), and have lowered d/e ratios by selling stock.

Anyone have an opinion on Delphi Energy Corp (DEE.TO). It trades on the Toronto
exchange and they hold NG & Oil producing properties located in Canada.

The company carries lots of debt (about $1.30/share long term debt) and in the
past has used hedges on both it's oil and NG production to smooth out the
peak's and valleys of the big price swings.

Here is a recent clip from BNN where the CEO of Delphi Energy discusses their
current business opportunities.

Here is recent news stories and company financials:

==============================================================

Pros: Company owns proven reserves that generate good cash flow (w/ hedges).
Positive free flow cash and break even after depreciation. Company has been
buying more properties (Hythe & Fairmount Energy) at very good "value" prices
in a much depressed market. Great potential to generate positive marginal
income.

Cons: Company carries a lot of debt. Company just completed $16.5 million
public stock offering (share dilution). Little to no income after SG&A and
depreciation.

Very small independent oil & NG developer but reaching economies of scale as
they add new properties into their production mix. Future growth prospects are
positive as long as they can integrate new production from recent purchases
into their on-going business. If the commodity moves higher, then the business
value goes up. Lots of potential to make positive earnings with additions to
production w/ new property buys.

Company buys and sells in Canadian $'s. Should benefit from a falling US $.

I have owned Delphi for several months for a 100% gain but it still looks good
here, so I'm holding long-term.

which brazil steel stock do you own currently?

Im still heavily long but mostly mining and energy. ive got all of my gfre and
mcgc, but slw dgc.to sd chk and mfcaf are pretty huge positions for me. dgc.to
detour gold is the company the pelangio merged back into .I think its
inevitable that junior mining stocks have their day again.

Paul, what prompts you to choose WLFC common over the preferred?

MikeS97707 correctly called for a target between 9 and 10 when the pfd was
selling at 6 and change back in March, but even at current price, the preferred
is still yielding 9.3%

WLFC. Yes, case can be made for the preferred even now. Maybe a better case
than for the common.
It's just that I have pfd shares bought back then at those prices, and while
9+% is good now and I've no intention of selling my stock (I'm watching to see
if preferred stock falls so as to maybe buy more), now might be the top for the
stock's appreciation. And it just seems that the aircraft leasing business is
holding up okay (perhaps evidenced by recent consolidation among the players),
so I decided to increase my exposure (increase my bet on the future by buying
the common). I realize WLFC isn't primarily an aircraft lessor, but I am
guessing it (the company and the stock) ought to do at least as well going
forward as GLS & FLY, both of which I am also in for a few shares.

OT morning rant:

I find it annoying how every short term price increase in a headline is alway
accompanied by an explanation, that leaves me scratching my head-"how do they
know?' then realizing that they dont really. todays is "oil goes above $71 as
investors are more optimistic about global recovery". Makes me wonder if some
headline writer sits in front of a computer with lists of words for going up
and down like soars and plunges, rises pulls back, etc and then another list of
dozens of reasons and then picks one at random. one the other day was about
"gold plunging as investors concerns about inflation ease". any headline
writers out there?

That is exactly how it works. You can give a newspaper to a flock of
journalists and delete all references what the stock market did. tell half that
the stock market went up 200 pts, and the other half that it went down. They
will all find plenty of reasons in the daily news for market action in their
direction. Or they dust off the standard reasons. you finally figured this out?
:o)

Asian stock markets and oil prices extended their advance Wednesday amid
renewed faith a recovery in the global economy was sustainable....

Or they pick up the phone and call one of the half-dozen regular trading desk
guys they speak to and drink with after work and say hey Jim, why did we go up
today? Well, it was optimism about global recovery, Jack.

Thus "investors say" is born, published and widely repeated by everyone running
that wire service.

I have a friend who was in government public affairs for 20 years and now does
corporate communications. He says most business reporters are incredibly lazy.
