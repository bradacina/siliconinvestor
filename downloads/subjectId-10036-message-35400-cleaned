I suppose there are more than 1 school of thought on RODM. One says the stock
was a buck in July and the run up now to $5 makes it technically extended and
increases the danger. The other says they earned 42 cents in Q2, and based on
the fees they make selling virtual junk, they are likely to exceed that 42
cents cents by a good margin, while the one lonely analyst has them pegged for
a loss this Q.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ae?s=RODM

If earnings and earnings growth, significantly beating the estimates, and the
PE drives the stock price, RODM could do alot better than 42 cents this Q. That
would give it an extrapolated annualized PE looking at a trailing 2 quarter
basis of about 2.5.

I'm betting higher still with some gambling tendency and patience thru any
pullback should one occur.

Bought some OSHC (6.9$) and SSBI (6.3$) - regional banks.
The OSHC position was acquired over time. OSHC has been discussed here before
it's a demutualization play - they did their 1step in 2004 and management
wanted to do the 2nd step in 2008/2009 which busted. Still it's a solid small
little bank trading far below tangible book. Writeoffs are small (albeit
growing) but so is their allowance for losses.

Balance sheet is very solid with a 9% tangible equity ratio (without the 2nd
step shares being converted).

SSBI is a Dale Baker pick and hasn't moved much. 5* safety rating and they are
local for me.

Hi Paul - NOBGF.PK is a very interesting stock. I read through the 185 page
2008 annual report and was quite impressed with their different business around
the world. I was a bit concerned about their outstanding shares (around 3.5
Billion) with a stock price of $1.85/share. I was told by Schwab Global that
this is common for the companies in Asia (specifically Singapore). You must buy
these shares through Schwab Global at a minimum $100 fee, but my Ameritrade
account will accept my order but no action yet for my starter position.

The company is earning money too. They earned $0.18/share last year which
translates to a PE around 10 (very reasonable price). They paid a cash dividend
this year around 2% and in 2008 they paid a stock dividend at the rate of 1 new
share for every 5 held (a 20% stock dividend).

It is very difficult to obtain these simple numbers from YAHOO (they have no
financials) or even on the Nobel Group Ltd web site. Do you have a web site
that condenses their detailed reports into very simple earnings per share, PE
and dividend payments (amounts & dates)?

Finally Schwab Global said that the stock has been halted for three days
pending some announcement on a large sale from an estate which the company was
trying to buy. The last trade in Singapore was $1.62 and the picks sheets have
been trading the stock between $1.83-$1.90.

This looks like a good one to accumulate. The company is not dollar denominated
so you have a hedge against a falling U.S. $, the company owns and operates
many different natural resource assets (mineral rights), ports & logistic
assets, and have operations in several of the BRICK countries (especially my
favorite Brazil). There is only a three year track record since it went public
but they have paid a dividend every year (cash and/or stock) and have had
excellent earnings growth.

If the global market is really going to turn positive with the largest demand
coming from Asia (ie China), NOBGF.pk Noble Group LTD seems to have their table
set to gain from this.

The stock could have been had for $0.45-$0.65 a share between 10/2008 - 4/2009.
The stock broke above its 200 day MA in May 2009 at $0.95/share and now is
trading in the $1.80 - $1.85/share price range.

A couple more observations regarding my portfolios:

The performance of my portfolios during the last 5 years is positively
correlated to my trading frequency. For me trading does seem to work.
Essentially I am selling liquidity, so I am more of a swingtrader with a value
bias than a LT value investor. This is different what many books about
investing are teaching but for me buy and hold did not work (and the bear
market is a reason for that but even before 2008 the heavily traded portfolio
seems to be outperforming the others.

I cannot get Lynch philosophy to "buy what you know" to work for me - example:
I love Jamba Juice, looked at the stock a couple of times and passed due to
unconvincing financials. For me numbers rule over my gut or tastebuds. (The
stock is a disaster so far.) I cannot find anything attractive about McDonalds
but I think their business model works and I would buy their stock if it's
cheap enough.

Foreign stocks can be great in bull markets but beware bear markets. At least
with stocks in your native country, you know what hits you. With foreign
stocks, you often don't and the stocks go down for seemingly no reason. It's
probably good to play these also based on charts unless you can keep yourself
abreast of developments in many different countries (best in the native
language for diversity of information sources).

My shortselling skills are poor. I do better with puts, at least it's clear
what I am going to loose if my bet is wrong (100%).

When all the bulls (or should say bears) are running in your direction like a
stampede it does not matter if you are wrong or right or your stocks are solid
or cheap or both. You need to step aside or you get trampled!

Leverage ratios are the new VaR?
Posted by Tracy Alloway on Sep 11 08:49.

What happens when you get Rick Bookstaber and Nassim Nicholas Taleb in the same
room, to talk about one of the most controversial risk measures of the
financial crisis?

They (almost) agree.

The two were speaking in front of the US House of Representatives Committee on
Science & Technology, which met yesterday to discuss the role of financial
modelling in the recent financial meltdown. As Reuters blogger Felix Salmon
points out, the two risk-writers have had their differences in the past,
notably about the usefulness of Taleb’s Black Swans, or fat-tailed events that
no one foresees.

While the two come up with similar ideas about what could replace VaR as the
dominant measure of banks’ risk for the committee, there were nevertheless
differences in their opinions.

From Rick Bookstaber’s statement:
There are two approaches for moving away from over-reliance on VaR.

The first approach is to employ coarser measures of risk, measures that have
fewer assumptions and that are less dependent on the future looking like the
past. The use of the Leverage Ratio mandated by U.S. regulators and championed
by the FDIC is an example of such a measure. The leverage ratio does not
overlay assumptions about the correlation or the volatility of the assets, and
does not assume any mitigating effect from diversification, although it has its
own limitations as a basis for capital adequacy.*

The second approach is to recognize that while VaR provides a guide to risk in
some situations, it must be enhanced with other measures that are better at
illuminating the areas it does not reach. For example, Pillar II of Basel II
has moved to include stress cases for crises and defaults into its risk capital
process. So in addition to measuring risk using a standard VaR approach, firms
must develop scenarios for crises and test their capital adequacy under those
scenarios. Critical to the success of this approach is the ability to ferret
out potential crises and describe them adequately for risk purposes.

And Taleb’s:

Regulators should understand that financial markets are a complex system and
work on increasing the robustness in it, by preventing “too big to fail”
situations, favoring diversity in risk taking, allowing entities to absorb
large shocks, and reducing the effect of model error (see “Ten Points for a
Black Swan Robust Society”, in Appendix II). This implies reliance on “hard”,
non-probabilistic measures rather than more error-prone ones. For instance
“leverage” is a robust measures (like the temperature, it does not change with
your model), while VaR is not.

So are leverage ratios the new VaR?

While many of VaR’s failings are due to the fact that the measure largely
relies on banks’ own inputs, leverage ratios, we imagine, are prone to the same
sort of manipulation. In fact, Bookstaber points out in his statement that
off-balance sheet positions, and even CDOs, weren’t included in some banks’ VaR
calculations.

Surely off-balance sheet positions wouldn’t be included in leverage ratios
either. In fact, this is something Bookstaber himself remarks upon in his
footnote:
*The Leverage Ratio is inconsistent with Basel II because it is not sensitive
to the riskiness of balance sheet assets and it does not capture off-balance
sheet risks. By not taking the relative risk of assets into account, it could
lead to incentives for banks to hold riskier assets, while on a relative basis
penalizing those banks that elect to hold a low-risk balance sheet. In terms of
risk to a financial institution, the time horizon of leverage is also
important, which the Leverage Ratio also misses. The problems with Bear Stearns
and Lehman was not only one of leverage per se, but of funding a sizable
portion of leverage in the short-term repo market. They thus were vulnerable to
funding drying up in the face of a crisis.

Madharry ,the VaR discussion is an interesting one and the potential abuse on
of the reasons why I think that derivatives need to go to an exchange. Assuming
there is a real market there, at least the value part of the equation should be
straightforward.

The other argument in favor of moving as many financial instruments to an
exchange is that the clearinghouse functionality prevents a chain reaction of
default. it is very telling that the big brokerages (JPM, GS) are working hard
to prevent move towards an exchange for those derivatives.

another interesting article for your consideration:

HA Director David Stevens came out last week with a statement that their 2%
minimum capital rule will be broached this fall. Mr. Stevens swore that this
was not going to be a problem and no federal bailout was going to be required.
He came forward with a list of things to address the problem. As near as I
could tell none of these changes will have a significant impact on the results.
The proposed measures will not be implemented until after 1/1/2010. By then it
will be too late. In my view FHA will most likely require a federal support
package sometime in the 1st quarter of 2010.

FHA is on a tear to provide new mortgages. One needs only to watch cable TV and
see their endless ads to confirm that. FHA makes high LTV loans. They lend as
much as 96.5% of a purchase price. This coupled with the first time buyer
credit of $8,000 makes them a provider of 100% financing. The history of this
type of lending shows very high default rates in the first eighteen months of a
loan. Between now and January their capital cushion will be eroded and we will
have another Fannie and Freddie story to deal with.

FHA is not a public company, it is owned by Congress. They do not publish the
wealth of information that F/F does. It is therefore difficult to determine
just how sick they are. Rummaging through their web site I did come across
something that I thought was interesting. FHA sets ceilings on its credit
extensions based on geography. This make sense as RE values vary across the
country.

There are some predictable results and a few surprises. The major East/West
Coast cities have the highest limits:

But if you live in one of the Nation’s other Cities you are not so lucky:

And if one lives in some not so expense (but still very nice) parts of the
country you have been red lined by the Feds:

One has to wonder if RE prices drove these limits or if these limits drove RE
prices. An example: The FHA has set very high loan limits for a number of major
ski resorts. It is certain that the availability of cheap FHA loans with 96.5%
LTV has been a boon to the development of these areas. I have to wonder as to
the social implications of this. These are Federal dollars being spent in
support of a rich man’s sport in rich man’s Counties.

Other FHA factoids:

-The highest advance rate for FHA is in Maui, Hawaii. There you can borrow up
to $790,000. While I understand that RE is pricey in this beautiful spot I am
not convinced that Uncle Sam should be supporting those high prices.

-In San Juan, Vermont the limit is $271,050, In San Juan, Puerto Rico the limit
is more than double that; $606,500.

-In Saipan you can get an FHA mortgage for up to $613,000. In Guam the limit is
$651,000. In St. John, Virgin Islands you can get a 96.5% mortgage for up to
$623,000.

-In three important counties in S. Florida the limits are as follows:
Miami-Dade – $423,750
Palm Beach- $423,750
Collier- $531,250

By way of comparison the following twenty-seven counties in Puerto Rico have
FHA limits of $606,250. Go figure that one out.

Guaynabo, Gurabo, Hatillo, Humacao, Juncos, Florida, Tao Alta, Tao Baja,
Trujillo Alo, Vega Baja, Vega Ala, Yabucoa, Yauco, Loiza, Maniti, Maunabo,
Morivis, Naguabo, Naranjito, Orocovis, Quebradillas, Rio Grand, San Juan and

That was an interesting article.

After reading quite a bit about tremendous uncertainty regarding the extent
people will walk away from their mtg when they are underwater, this study
suggests that walkaways are 50% more likely to occur among people with high

It is easy to imagine these people rationalizing their action as purely a
business decision, not related in any way to an "ethics question." Or the
common good. Especially in an environment of financial corporation abuse and

Also read this morning that the "option ARMS", the ones with the teaser rates

reducing the interest rate, and lengthening the repayment term. I suppose $186

Think somebody knew something? Lets see how the SEC handles this:

Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Trading in bullish Perot Systems Corp. options jumped
to a seven-year high Sept. 18 before Dell Inc. said today it will buy the
company for $3.9 billion.

Call volume climbed to 2,539 contracts, or 242 times the four-week average and
the most in one day since 2002, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Only
10 puts traded that day, the data show. The shares, which rose 0.1 percent to
$17.91 on Sept. 18, surged 65 percent to $29.56 today in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.

Call options, which convey the right to buy stock at a specified price by a
certain date, often return more to investors speculating on takeover targets.
Some of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s biggest insider-trading
cases have focused on purchases of options before acquisitions of companies
such as Dow Jones & Co. and TXU Corp.

“The question is whether there was insider trading,” said Tamar Frankel, a
professor at Boston University School of Law who has testified to Congress on
financial regulation. “It’s enough of a bump to warrant attention, and it’s not
costly for regulators to inquire.”

Goldman, Morgan Stanley

SEC spokesman John Heine and Dell spokesman David Frink declined to comment.
Perot spokesman Marvin Singleton didn’t return a call for comment.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Baker Botts LLP advised Perot on the transaction,
while Morgan Stanley and Vinson & Elkins LLP helped Dell.

The last session’s most-active options were October $20 calls, which gained 22
percent to 55 cents Sept. 18 and jumped 1,627 percent to $9.50 today. Those
contracts, which expire Oct. 16, are also the most widely owned options,
accounting for about half of all 10,353 Perot contracts.

“When there’s a volume spike on a legitimate takeover it smacks of insider
trading,” said Steve Sosnick, equity risk manager at Timber Hill LLC, the
market-making unit of Greenwich, Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers Group
Inc. “What made people wake up Friday and decide to make big bets in upside
calls on Perot? That’s the question that has to be asked, and the most obvious
answer is probably that someone got wind of the transaction.”

Almost Double

Sosnick’s firm doesn’t make markets in Perot options.

Last week’s call volume of 8,279 contracts is almost double the number that
traded during the previous three months, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Call volume rose to 15,364 contracts today, 28 times the four-week
average.

Other factors may explain the trading, such as investments triggered by changes
in the price of Perot’s stock, Frankel said.

Dell said in a statement today that it agreed to buy Perot, founded by former
U.S. presidential candidate H. Ross Perot, undertaking its biggest purchase
ever to compete with Armonk, New York-based International Business Machines
Corp. and Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard Co. in computer services.

‘Worth the SEC’s Time’

Dell, the second-biggest maker of personal computers, offered $30 a share in
cash, about 68 percent more than Plano, Texas-based Perot’s closing price on
Sept. 18. The acquisition probably will boost profit in fiscal 2012, Round
Rock, Texas- based Dell said in a statement today.

“It wasn’t just a random event that they happened to show up the week before a
takeover and put on the largest options position in seven years,” said Danon
Robinson, the risk manager at Toro Trading LLC, a New York-based options
broker. “It’s certainly worth the SEC’s time to make a few phone calls, find
out who the customer was and do some investigating.”

Anializer it's pretty common for telecoms with wireless assets to have negative
tangible value. This is because the expensive wireless licenses that are on the
books as intangibles. Both T and VZ (although they are still partly landline)
have negative tangible book value. VOD balance sheet is actually in a much
better shape than T & VZ.

These wireless licenses have real value, more so than the hard assets in the

Licenses or patents are typicially in the books for the purchase value minus
accumulated amortization (over their usefull life). When patents are developed
in house, their are mostly on the books for a token value, so patent values are
mostly completely arbitrary values.

Telecom licenses are typically acquired using a bidding process, so at least at
some point there was a second party validation.

Regardless, i don't claim that VOD is an asset play, it's more like a cash flow
or FCF play. Those wireless assets (whatever they are worth if they were sold)
are generating real cash flow and VOD cash flow multiples seemed low when the
stock was at 18$. There is more than one way to skin a cat or to value a stock

Thank you everyone for not poking fun at me for losing serious gains on my
early sales of Hotel Reits such as FCH and especially BEE (Which has promptly
doubled from my sale point!!!!) as they've continued their march.

I hope that others have made more money on BEE than I did. :)

I appreciate the suggestions from others of ACTS and GRVY recently. These are
slightly above my buying price and I like their current valuations for further
upside.

Though, I'm feeling like we're back to a regular stock pickers market. I don't
feel like there are any no-brainers out there anymore.

Thanks,

Yes, Madharry. I agree. This has definitely been a great year, and I don't
think I've ever been able to have as much conviction in buying certain stocks
than ever before, which is why I was able to hold on to some of them for big
gains. Though, as I'm mentioning, I sold way too early on BEE (did ok on FCH
though).

My problem now is that I'm not having the same conviction buying many of the
'values' out there now, which is concerning. I'm rotating into safer plays now
with less future returns (from my perspective). We'll see how that turns out.
But, as you say, I'd love to get half the returns in future years as my returns
this year (So far! Hopefully, we don't crash for the rest of the year!).

Market has become very complacent, imo and is not driven by value buyers since
the fundamentals are lacking. I think the market is driven by a combination of
chartchasers and see of liquidity as well as the resurgence of carry trades due
to zero interest rates.

SP500 unit earnings are about 50$ and the SP500 is at 1066 which is a PE of
about 21. I cannot see this as cheap. Y2010 earnings are about 65$/unit which
assumes a pretty heady 30% growth (off a low base of course) and even with that
we are at a PE of 16.4.

Another warning sign - these are "operating earnings" the GAAP earnings are way
lower than that. A large gap between these two is a good indicator of poor
earnings quality.

SO my take is if the chartchasers are gone, what is going to support the
valuations? I cannot see the value buyers loading up before we hit the 800-850
point range. Of course individual stocks will be in value territory long before
that, so i think stockpickers can do OK.

Just my opinion and it's worth what you paid for it <g>.

ROIAK,

Thank you for posting this. Interesting stock, but I don't know yet about being
a no-brainer. I have only met a handful of stocks in my career I'd classify as
no-brainer.

Like other radio plays, a couple of which have gone bankrupt, it has negative
tangible book value. If market worsens some of the intangible book value could
get written off. Also, the company has a lot of debt.

The company received a comment letter from the SEC. Not sure what it is, but
they are delaying the annual meeting. They also said operating conditions would
be challenging the rest of the year.

It seems high potential reward, but a decent amount of risk.

Are you selling any of your preferreds? If so where are you putting the
proceeds? I am holding all my preferreds in the IRA and am thinking of peeling
off some of the multi bagger preferreds from the taxable account with the idea
of buying NG related stocks on any pull back.

I like the income that the preferreds offer and may just peel off a few shares
of my GNMA fund instead. The FED will hold interest rate steady for some time
as the credit markets are still fragile especially the housing sector. When the
FED shows any sign of raising rates, I believe the GNMA prices will fall faster
than the preferred shares.

Eventually inflation will be the big concern but by the time it is evident many
of the obvious hedges will be much higher.

If we do test lows again (or at least have a good correction) the sideline cash
will allow one to accumulate some good assets on the cheap.

Great job on your YTD gains. I think the better deal is the nice income streams
you locked in with your utility and preferred share buys. Even after taxes the
blended return is north of 10% backed by quality assets.

>Are you selling any of your preferreds? If so where are you putting the

Selling. Yes, but very limited and where the price increase has dropped the
yield to under 9%, like DRE-N and BDN-D. However, keeping CLP-D (at 9% today)
because it is residential

I used some of the funds to add to other higher yielding pref at the time, like
FR-K at $12 to $13, and some DDR-G (but it is retail) under $16. The rest is in
cash and utilities for awhile. Oh, and I recently bought FVE and SKH.

>...idea of buying NG related stocks on any pull back.
I bailed on NG years ago. Only energy I own is DO and RIG. But I bought some
NXY this AM. My 1st oil in awhile.

>I think the better deal is the nice income streams you locked in with your

Yep. But my utilities are only yielding 5.7% now -- just a place to store the
cash. CNP POM LNT FPL PGN.

The reason why I particularly think it's a "no brainer" is because the size of
the buyback left is bigger than the market cap. If you have 3 widgets for sale
and somebody has approval to buy 5 widgets from you at a higher price than you
have them advertised for sale, it's a no brainer that you'll be able to sell
your widgets for a profit I think. :)

But there's always risk that they'll cancel the buyback, and my definiton of
no-brainer just means that the potential greatly outweighs the risk. As to your
comments, I'd have to disagree...

1) The intangible book value = licenses with very real value that can be sold.
There is virtually zero chance of "writing it off" in its entirety -- this is
different than "normal" Goodwill. However, I guess there's some risk of SOME
reduction in value of the radio licenses and some relatively minor writeoff vs.
the value of the licenses carried on the books.

2) ROIAK appears to be the most healthy and best positioned public radio play
that I can find. I don't think bankruptcy risk is realistic, especially
considering how profitable they've become and how much credit/liquidity they
have available to them without material debt payments due any time soon.

3) The only thing about the SEC was routine correction on comments made in SEC
filings that need to be fixed. Nothing to do with the financials so it's just
paperwork.

Brandywine gains after $250 million debt offer
Brandywine shares advance after raising $250 million in unsecured debt
Tuesday September 22, 2009

From the article:"...UBS analyst Ross Nussbaum said the new debt carries a
"solid" yield, which compares well with its other debt due 2014 with an
interest rate of 5.4 percent and yields in the low 8 percent range. Bond
investors compare yields when they're investing in debt.

Brandywine's successful debt offering shows there's still strong demand for
real estate investment trust paper in the credit markets, the analyst said in a
research note...."

..."...Nussbaum said access to the unsecured market is important for
Brandywine, since it's more dependent on this type of debt than its peers.
About 70 percent of Brandywine's debt is unsecured as of the second quarter,
compared with 34 percent on average for its peers.

Brandywine's ability to raise unsecured debt is a positive for the company, a
feat Nussbaum didn't believe it could have pulled off some months ago...."

===============================================================

I own the BDNpC which at $21.5 now yields 8.75%. The stock goes xdividend on
10/15/2009 ($0.47/share) and is only yielding a 1.125% premium to the new debt
just issued. I am tempted to sell 1/2 my BDNpC in the taxable account and put
the proceeds into FRpK which yields around 12.5%. The risk may even be a bit
less with FR as their debt exposure is a bit less than BDN.

I missed DDR so I will pass on that one. Keep us advised on other income
producers with value as your lists have been useful to me.

F-A,

The DKL trust preferred yields more at 11% and matures sooner. I think it has
equal rights to the F-A notes, but you might double check the prospectuses.

I haven't the guts to buy them at these and much higher yield levels. I'd love
for somebody to talk me into it.

I'd be perfectly content with 11%+ returns for the next 22 years. I'd
especially be content with that the next year or so. The market is offering

ROAIK,

I had a lengthy reply, but I screwed it up, and I am tired to redo it, so I'll
cut it down.

I looked up the 2011 notes on Bloomberg and they are rated at CCC- and trading
at $0.50 on the dollar with a yield of 59%. That implies non-zero risk of a
bankruptcy in the next couple of years. You might feel like you have a better
grip on this than the bonds guys, but I don't have that much faith in my
analysis abilities.

So maybe the upside is 4x, but downside is pretty big if things turn south. Not
a no-brainer for me because losing money gets more painful as I age. I might do
it as a spec.

I'm content with 11% returns, but I don't want to risk losing my entire

south again (not as bad as it got, but there will be some more bankruptcies).
I'd rather skimp a little on yield right now and cut down the risk.

I certainly like the equity raises are helping companies pay down debt.
However, like you said, DDR selling notes doesn't comfort me as much. It is

ROIAK is actually more expensive based in EBITDA/EV than SALM. ROAIK EV/EBITDA
value of about 9x is not that great for a shrinking business - it implies a 11x
yield pretax on th entire capitalization. Their revenues are down 16% (compared
to 12% for SALM). What has helped them were huge cost cuts in overhead. On plus
is that the TV One JV may be a hidden asset.

Revenues were down simply because advertising rates for multiple reasons
including this not being an election year which is the highest driving force of
revenues. If you think there will be any sort of economic recovery AND another
election, advertising rates will drive higher revenues and net income for ROIAK
IMO. I don't think radios are a dying business as long as people have cars
they'll be listening to radios.

Not that any of this matters....I know ROAIK will be a multi-bagger for 2
reasons.

(1) In this off period for advertising, ROIAK managed to squeeze out +.12/share
EPS last Q for an annualized PE of less than 2. Listed penny stocks showing
even remote chances of survival have been going absolutely nuts and running.
With ROIAK making big bucks now I'm confident it will continue to explode.

(2) The buyback is just insane. No matter what the operations are doing, they
company is in the middle of buying back itself. 40% of the outstanding shares
have been bought back already in the last year. You can analyze EBITA until
you're blue in the face -- it doesn't matter if the company buys the entire
float the stock will continue to explode. I don't know of any other "healthy"
businesses with such a monster stock buyback all in the open market.

But speaking strictly on financials, bond guys have been screwing up left and

down the market. I wouldn't put too much blind faith in them.

That said, of course there's risk with ROIAK if things turn south and/or they
cancel the buyback for some reason. But I like the risk/reward ratio. I think
ROIAK will continue its mulit-bagger trend short term as they continue to make

I agree the buybacks add an interesting twist to that story but by definition
they cannot buy back the whole company because the remaining shares get more
expensive. They also have increased their debt while their cash flows have been
shrinking. they only have 8M$ left on their bank line until they have covenant
issues, so i think these buybacks will have to slow unless they continue to
generate strong FCF.

Radio has been shrinking for years before we went into the recession and while
a better economic climate will reduce the revenues losses, I think that it is a
business in terminal and slow decline, just like newspapers.

ROIAK does not really stand out relative to it's peers, not even in stock price
performance. Many penny stocks have been jumping up a few % percent from their
loans. Obviously the perception has changed and some give those equity sliver
stocks a chance of survival. I am not sure they actually will and if the debt
is included (that is what the EV will do) they are not even cheap.

I wonder how huge the net income will be for ROIAK with the Q3 earnings report?
Man is this a value play if I've ever seen one... such a tiny annualized PE.
This is clearly a massively recovering (not dying) business:

Alfred C. Liggins, III, Radio One's CEO and President commented, "At this point
it seems likely that the first quarter will prove to be the low-point for 2009
radio revenues. Our second quarter performance showed significant improvement
in three out of our top four markets, and we out-performed the general market
in 10 of the 14 markets where we have available Miller Kaplan data. The
significant cost reduction program that we launched in 2008 has mitigated to
some degree the impact of falling revenues on the bottom line, but there is no
doubt that the operating environment will remain very challenging for the rest
of 2009."

This, couple with ROIAK's massive buyback, makes ROIAK a screaming
fist-pounding super-obvious no-brainer. Anybody who studies it and doesn't buy
should have no excuses after it explodes.

New Nielsen Ratings Show Strong Radio Usage

September 23, 2009
Nielsen's newly-launched radio measurement service found that 18 to
34-year-olds in the 51 markets covered by the service listen to the radio 21.5
hours each week – in line with all people age 12 and older, the company said.
The findings were among the first data delivered to clients since Nielsen
announced last year that it would begin to measure radio. The survey was
conducted in March and April among 119,000 consumers representing a population
of 14 million.

Nielsen utilizes address-based sampling (ABS), which uses randomly selected
home addresses rather than telephone numbers. As a result, ABS is able to
target cell phone only (CPO) homes and landline homes with unlisted numbers.
The company reported that 15 percent of the households in the sample are CPO,
which skew toward younger, tech-savvy consumers. Nielsen found that they tune
in even more than 18 to 34-year-olds, listening to the radio 23 hours per week.

"By measuring the listening habits of 98 percent of the population instead of
the 65 percent that we have been getting, Nielsen has dispelled many of the
harmful untruths that have plagued our medium among the ad buying community,"
stated Cumulus Radio COO Lew Dickey. "Most notable is the notion that radio has
lost its hipness and relevance among younger audiences. Nielsen’s data proves
that this is clearly not the case and it will clearly lead to a stronger
appreciation of radio over time."

"Nielsen is committed to setting a new quality standard in radio ratings," said
Lorraine Hadfield, Nielsen’s managing director of global radio measurement. "We
have collaborated with our clients every step of the way to develop a better,
more accurate approach to radio measurement and we are proud of the data that
we are sharing with the marketplace."

Nielsen’s ABS also showed that the 12+ listener on average tunes to 2.5
stations each week. CPO listeners 12+ listen to 2.8 stations per week. Persons
12+ have a total Average Quarter Hour (AQH) rating of 15.7 and listen for 21
hours and 57 minutes per week. Also, African-Americans and Hispanics in the 51
markets measured tune in more than the average population at 26.5 hours and 25
hours per week, respectively. Radio listeners age 18 to 34, which account for
27 percent of the measured population, have a total AQH rating of 15.6 percent,
which is in line with the entire market, Nielsen says.

Nieslen data is about viewership -- not ad ratings. The number of viewers tells

cyclical and seasonally swings.

a far cry from a "value" play. WTF?

Can anyone who follows ROIAK confirm the accuracy of this posting?

3/31/09 and 6/30/09, per Form 13F-HR filed on 8/14/09. Incredibly, their
selling represented roughly 50% of the 7 million or so in total volume that
ROIAK traded during that time period, which no doubt explains why the stock was
"dead in the water" for that time period.

I see a similar pattern with MNI, where Ariel did some major dumping in the
same time period, only to be surprised by (like ROIAK) SPECTACULAR earnings.

The interesting question now, is with Ariel still holding 6.5 million shares at
6/30/09, are they CONTINUING to sell, or have they decided to HOLD their
remaining position. Ariel owned an incredible 10 million shares of ROIAK at
3/31/09, which was equivalent to nearly 20% of the outstanding "K" shares, at
the time.

My HOPE is that management is using its availability on its line of credit to
BUY BACK shares from Ariel, and reduce the size of the share base. That would
be an incredible way to continue to increase shareholder value...for those of
us who remain.

Raw doesn't want to talk about those issues........but for the record,
institutions have DUMPED about 25 million share in this jewel in latest
reporting. Ask Raw, how much this operation lost in 2007, 2008, and so far this
year reporting even greater losses. And now SEC questions have stopped dead in
the water their plans to hold something called Annual Stockholder meeting.

He mocks ETMR, however, ask him how many shares the insiders and institutions
have BOUGHT in the last few months....as I have. Biotech don't have income
until they get product approved by the FDA...Let's see, RIOAK is trading for
.85 cents, and ETMR was trading at .83 cents a few months ago and is now
trading a $5.00....so one should ask......if it's at $5.00 how much will it be
worth if they get FDA approval for addressing one of the nation/world's great
health crisis. Raw paints the 'pie-in-the-sky' story.....I tell anyone...do
your own DD.

Wow, you know so much about ETRM that you didn't even get the symbol right, LOL

ROIAK - I don't care that institutions foolishly dumped ROIAK in the timeframe
before they started reporting positive EPS while the world was mad -- I just
wish I was the one buying their shares. There have been many many many
incredible runs in stocks that institutions foolishly dumped (or blew up and
had no choice) that proved to be nothing more than insane buying opportunities.
ROIAK included obviously.

SEC questions? They did a routine examination of disclosure comments. Happens
all the time. Means little to nothing.

Good luck with ETRM or ETMR, I know absolutely nothing about it except that I
know it doesn't belong on this board -- I wasn't "mocking" it. This is a VALUE
board. I repeat -- do you have any idea what a value stock is? I'll give you a
hint -- it requires something called positive earnings. ETRM/ETMR may be the
buy of the century, but it still doesn't belong on this board. How hard is that
to comprehend? ETRM/ETMR/EOMR or whatever the hell it is is losing money hand
over fist currently. This board is for companies that are profitable in their
most recent quarter or year, not something with zero revenues whatsoever.

What in particular are you expecting from GTE? It's one of my largest holdings
also, but I'm becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of movement, while
other South American juniors have doubled and tripled over the last few months.

Kaiser,

GTE is not really a value stock, except perhaps in P/book terms (1.26 P/book
now). It is losing money last quarter and is highly expensive in P/Sales terms.
Its only attraction is possible continued rise of oil price and continued rise
of its reserves that may result in good profitability in the future.

I don't have a specific goal for it, but I would sell it if it doubled from
here. I am not impatient for that, so a double in couple years is fine with me.
Most of my purchases were in $2.X range, so I am happy with current returns
too. Yeah, other oil E&Ps may have rallied more, but GTE looks like a solid
holding still. I do have an outsized position.

Take care

Okay, back at my computer now after a short vacation in southern Sweden and
Copenhagen (aside: Very nice time, and I liked the areas/people/food and small
cities, esp. Ystad (site of Wallender mystery books/movies)in Sweden. Dollar
really doesn't go very far at all though, and that I expected in expensive
Scandinavia and in looking at other exchange rates (Euro/Pound). Couple
"of-course"'s and surprises: Yes, everybody we talked to over the age of 6
spoke English, but surprise was communication still a little troublesome
because nothing or very little is written in English in public places, ie. in
advertising or menus posted outside of restaurants. TV stations are few at the
hotels we were at. BBC World news was poor, esp. for business. Surprised no
CNN. Yes citizenry bicycle - apparently all ages and social groups - surprised
though at the amazing number of bicycles parked everywhere (and some available
by the gov't for free use with a refundable deposit). And yes, many tall
good-looking blond women (I liked that) and big athletic-looking guys. Only
very few overweight people compared to USA or even compared to supposedly
body-conscious California. Surprised seeing how many people still smoke
though.)

Market opening in a couple of minutes. Have finished placing orders. I'm going
to build up position in ADM again if it continues to drop. Reversion-to-mean:
p/e of 10 is too low compared to past years' averages. Company has nice history
of raising dividends (although yield now is small at 2%).

Welcome back Paul -

It's not very often that the buyer goes up after an acquisition, especially the
size of this one. ABT up 3.2% on their announcement.

Abbott to buy Solvay drug business for up to $7 billion
Deal gives Abbott control over cholesterol drug franchise
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/abbott-to-pay-up-to-7-billion-for-solvay-divis
on-2009-09-28

From the article:"...The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter
of 2010, will add around 10 cents to Abbott's adjusted earnings per share in
2010, rising to 20 cents by 2012. Abbott said it plans to pay for the
acquisition with cash from its balance sheet...."

==============================================================

Good job on your persistent buys of ABT. I opted to buy LLY based on current
price and forward PE. It appears LLY plans to increase their revenues through
downsizing while ABT's approach will be to buy into the future pipeline of new
drugs.

The market seems to like ABT's approach more so than LLY's.

USEG. Continuing to average up on my position.

Well, we all have our ways. And for me, rightly or wrongly, I like to buy these
oil/mineral companies when among other things, they sell for under stated book
value.

This one does, and I'm a buyer.

Among the threads I use as a contra indication, Big Dog's oil discussion thread
is one of my favorites. If an oil-related stock is not discussed there, not
recommended there, then for me that is a VERY positive factor. The Big Dog
thread being the top subject-marked thread on SI, with a bunch of oil experts,
traders, investors and bs'ers. Either the stock I'm interested isn't worthwhile
for anybody to dig up and comment on (pro or con), or else, perhaps I've just
found it and am interested in it, before the crowd. I prefer the latter view.

USEG, not being mentioned yet since 2/07, I take as a positive buy signal still
for a stock that meets my requirements.

Peeled off a few shares of CVX and bought the equivalent amount of shares in
COP. COP to me is a better value with a forward PE of 7.6 and pays a slightly
higher dividend than CVX. I like the NG holdings that COP has and after reading
through their 2008 annual report, COP's mid stream business is well positioned
for future growth.
http://www.conocophillips.com/EN/about/company_reports/ViewReports/08annualrepo
t.html

I also increased my Black Hills Corp. (BKH) position by 30% even though I am
buying at levels 25% higher than my previous buys. The company still yields
5.6% and I believe that their non-regulated energy business is undervalued. I
specifically like their Oil & Gas subsidiary called Black Hills Exploration &
Production.

http://www.blackhillscorp.com/nonreg.htm

I also started a small position in Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB) as this is
another NG company involved in the production, gathering, processing, and
transportation of natural gas in the United States. It's one I have watched for
a long time and it continues to slowly move higher. The stock is not a
screaming buy but at 14 forward PE it is not overly expensive either. They pay
a 2.5% dividend. I like their core assets and at 1.25 BV you are not paying a
huge premium for their facilities. Like BKH, WMB operates in the San Juan basin
in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado. This area is ripe for NG
development and WMB can transport the NG to California where demand continues
to grow.

EKS, I believe you might be right about COP vs. CVX. CVX has some big finds and
big projects though, and that might be a reason for higher valuation. Or maybe
it's something about refineries and who has the worst margins. Anyway, I don't
want to go reduce my CVX shares any lower than I already have (reduced by over
90%). I will though follow you in COP now for a few shares as a new starter

SAFT,

Paul, I am sticking with this one. I don't have a huge position.

The value numbers look compelling, and the company has been doing all the right
shareholder friendly things in my book (dividend and buybacks), but there is a
lot of company-specific risk particularly with GEICO entering their market.

I'd like to see how that plays out before selling out or perhaps even buying
more.

Was there anything in particular that got you nervous on car insurance, or just
overweighted?

Thanks,

WOOOOOOOOO0000000000000000--ETRM or is it ETMR? The one that jumped .40 cents
on booming volume today and is in three of my accounts. Sure wish I could get
the hang of this value investing.

Give me another lesson in value investing.......maybe you could use some of
those OTC:OB selections you have....tell me again about that 'barn-burner'
stock that has a MC of a whopping $5M....now that is value!!!!

As for dismissing the cancellation of the stockholder meeting and it merely
being something that routinely happens........do you want to give me some
examples of other companies not being able to file a SEC document that should
contain factual and correct information?

You know, Raw.......for some one that is freeloading here on SI...why don't you
pay them to post your informative info on value stocks? Sell some of that
company stock that can be bought for pocket change...pay SI to participate.

Do your own DD...investing in biotech is fraught with dangers.....one can lose
their shirt, but pick the right ones.....and you might get lucky! My mentioning
of a particular stocks is just a heads-up for people to start their DD. I will
have taken a position in a stock long before I'm going to mention it here on
SI. For examples...go to the PSDV and MITI boards......notice the price where
they were before I posted the first time. As with anyone..I've had some that

Personally, I wouldn't invest in either ETRM/ETMR or ROIAK, but that's just me.
I'm more risk averse as I've gotten older, investing in beaten down blue chips
like ABT, HNZ, T.
Less risk, less potential reward.
The biotech you mentioned may be a home run, I have no idea. I do know it is a
penny stock and almost certainly not a value stock as originally intended on
this thread.
Radio One has a few more of the characteristics looked for on this thread, but
this one's a crap shoot, as well, IMHO.
