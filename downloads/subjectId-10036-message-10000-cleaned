I purchased a biotech stock 4 years ago for $18 which was just about its high.
It kept dropping and dropping eventually reaching a bottom of $2.50 where upon
it issued a secondary. At various times I resisted the temptation to purchase
more shares as the company continued to burn cash, had no partners, and no
means of bringing the products to markets. This has been the case through today
but the stock has surged all the way back and hit $19 today. I am lost in the
biotech area. How can so many companies be worth 5-10 times in six months. What
have I missed here?

Perhaps I can provide some insight into the biotech stock move, since I have
enjoyed some of it with GZMO, which I recommended ON THIS THREAD in early 1999
under $3, as a value stock!

In my opinion, biotech is getting a bunch of the Internet speculator's money as
the company characteristics are similar -- no earnings to confuse anyone,
exciting stories with HUGE future potential, that WILL be realized by SOME of
the companies, enough actual business success stories for reference, recurring
Wall Street financing interest, and, very important, it is difficult to know
which ones will succeed and which ones won't, even if you are a scientist in
the field.

Long post: Busting on Grommitt, and net-net reflections

Grommit - you ought to be ashamed of yourself for gaming the system to get
10,000. Thats like buying a stock with $20 of net-net value for $13. Speaking
of that...Blair is working, and it is still a net-net, with improving
fundamentals.

You can still buy that net-net $20 and a profitable business for less than $17,
and now it has "momentum" (ggg - I don't know what ggg means, but Paul says it,
so I guess it is cool.) The stock has improving fundamentals, a new CEO and an
internet kicker.

I went back over the net-nets I have actually purchased over the last three
years. I was surprised there were only eleven - I've probably looked at and
rejected ten times that number - and that doesn't include the one that I had a
limit order on, gave up when it didn't get filled, and then it got taken over
two months later for a 50% gain. I have not taken a loss in any of them - and
that doesn't mean I am holding losers - EBSC is the only one I am down on that
I am still holding. With some the gains were small, but six of them I took away
40-50% within six months. And now I find myself down 10% in Elder Beerman. I
can't even remember being down in a net-net for any length of time - I was a
little early on FIT, and then doubled down at 10 1/8 which was nice. A little
early on Blair and doubled down below 13 which was very nice. Either
Elder-Beerman is a screaming buy now or my run is going to end. (I believe I
once said I had never lost money on a real estate stock. That changed very soon
after I said that. By that logic, EBSC is a short.)

Anyway, regarding Elder Beerman, I think it was Jeff who asked how to avoid
these mistakes. Mistakes? We've owned it for what, two months? I'm down 10%,
you're down at most 25%. The concept most central to value investing is being
forgotten. It begins with a P and ends with -atience. Relax. Nothing has
changed except the price, unless your research uncovers something - I'd love to
hear it. If I didn't already own EBSC I'd be buying it now. And if SNH and CMH
weren't trading at 8 and change, I'd be buying more EBSC.

Regarding past net-nets I disclosed ownership in -
WTBK - sold for a negligible profit - probably still a buy but I needed
marginable securitites to back internet shorts.
MAXS - I wouldn't buy it above 8 1/4.
LKI - I'm out above 9, but below 8 it looks attractive. No longer a net-net.
Things have deteriorated. I'm not buying.
EBSC - in at 5 1/8, keeping the faith
FIT - still a buy - I'm looking for 15-20. Nice dividend.
BL - still a buy at 16 1/2, I'd sell at 19-25 depending on how things look.
J - I sold my cost and am holding the rest on the chance something really
bizarre happens. Rumors of some internet thing. Play money now. No way I'd buy
it above 9.

Jeffrey Bash: re: GZMO the value stock

I've gone back to try to find what I missed on GZMO. I see how it could rise
based on your insight as to the biotech fervor or fever. But in reading the
latest news announcements,glancing at Yahoo posts now (the first GZMO post was
around 8/99 - much later than when you posted on
GZMO here), looking at Yahoo numbers, I still don't see it - how it was a value
stock at $3 - or that it's even worth more than $3 now. I can't find your
original post on GZMO here.
In one of your posts in the GZMO thread you recently wrote, "It is my opinion
that they will be able to produce aaATIII for much less than ENMD can its
antiangiogenesis compounds." That sentence suggests to me that your decision to
call GZMO a value stock might be based on some technical or professional
knowledge that perhaps most other value investors would not have. If so, I
could see why I would've passed on GZMO.

Paul, I would not know how to find the GZMO reco on this thread that I referred
to. My core points at the time were that it was uniquely depressed because of
the Genzyme dividend distribution of the stock to
largely institutional holders who could not keep it plus the leverage to the
company's business plan that the Genzyme relationship gave it, making it unique
among companies of its type.

Interestingly, I have had a huge aversion to these money-eating biotechs for
years and primarily because of those two characteristics
made an initial exception. I later made another for GZSP which I also mentioned
on this thread, but was an obvious value stock by traditional measures.

as a possible point of interest, have you considered ProFunds UltraShort OTC?
in essence, by using options and futures, it seeks to provide investment
returns that are twice the inverse performance of the NASDAQ 100 Index.

no, i didn't intend this as a joke.

"Investors who anticipate a downward trend in the NASDAQ 100 Index can
establish a position that seeks to capture twice the magnitude of any decline.
For example, during a 5% decline in the NASDAQ 100 Index, the UltraShort
ProFund seeks to produce a 10% gain in the net asset value."

an index fund on steroids if you will.

fwiw, they have similar UltraBull and -Bear funds for the S&P 500.

My value picks are:

RPM: with 50+ years of increasing earnings and 5% dividend and long history of
dividend increases currently selling at a 10 year low. Do-it-yourselfers keep
RPM profitable during down cycles.

CMH: with 30- years of increasing earnings, recently stumbled and trading at
low PE. Considered the best in their industry.

NEOG: one of the few biotech companies with earnings and strong balance sheet.

PBY: in 1997 was considered as one of the 100 best stocks to own. Recommended
by S%P at $38 in 1997 now down to 15 year low selling below book value and 4%
dividend.

PIOS: electronics distributer with strong b-to-b trading at a low valuation but
near its high.

these are all DRIPs so can be acquired over time or near dips.

PBY I would be wary of. Competitors I have spoken with say they are beyond
fixing. I live in their home base of Philadelphia, and their stores here look
old and tired. Is the balance sheet still deteriorating? If things are starting
to improve operationally, you've got a stock that everybody has given up on, so
it probably has a lot of potential upside. If my understanding of the
fundamentals is right, though, that is not the case. I have not looked at the

Your points on PBY are valid. However, if the market turns down and investors
feel poorer they'll buy fewer new cars and take their old clunkers in for
service or perform the work themselves. PBY is open for service 7 days a week
and are relatively inexpensive when I price compare for parts and service.
Also, PBY is expanding on the service theme, which may pan out. Another plus is
PBY is largely owned by their employees. Finally, PBY may be a takeover target.

I have personally used PBY for parts and service. Parts prices are reasonable
but there is lots of competition and slim margins here. Service has been OK
with a couple of screwups which is par for most service work.

I figure the stock price is still sliding negative and may go below $5 where
the company would be selling for 30-40 cents on the dollar. You're right this
is still a gamble, but a shake of management might bring new life to PBY. At
recent prices shareholders may demand changes.

I agree but I don't see much downside risk for RPM at current prices and with a
history of dividend increases. Also, if times get tough, people will tend to
repair items rather than replacing them. Also, RPM could conceivably spin 20
(+or-) companies.

It is still early for CMH and there may still be some downside risk. Wait till
interest rates begin dropping again. Lots of boomers are thinking of moving
into the country away from cities and suburbs and some will want smaller
retirement homes. I think growth could pick up over the next decade and at the
current PE this could do well in a time-averaged account such as a DRIP.

PBY still has downside risk but may have potential once bottomed.

And while NEOG may have limited upside, they had reasonably priced growth until
they recently stumbled. I think NEOG is back on track with their latest
acquisition and population trends going forward.

IMO, as long as the Nasdaq will continue to head North it will become easier
every day to find some good value picks. The phenomena is quite simple: the
money goes out of the conservative stocks like G, KO, F, MO, or whatever... to
be poured in the QCOM, CSCO, NT, JDSU, USVO or whatever... As long as it will
last, as long we will suffer. But it does not mean that value investing is out
of date and should not be part of one's strategy.

I have just finished the reading of a research published February 14, by Ed
Yardeni, Chief Economist at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. Titled "Is It A Bubble?
-- Old Vs. New Economy Stocks", the analysis points to the extraordinary run-up
of the Nasdaq against the S&P 500 and the broader market. A few excerpts may be
useful to understand what's going on right now and to comfort those of us who
are desperate enough to dump 100% of their old value stocks.

There are some staggering statistics in this article. Here are just a few:

-- The p/e ratio for the 100 largest cap Nasdaq stocks, using analysts'
consensus earnings expectations for this year, is 100x, down from 237x using
1999 earnings.

-- The S&P 500 index, which includes 69 technology stocks, has a p/e of 24.

-- Nearly 70% of the stocks listed on the NYSE were down last year. So far this
year, 68% are down (this number is probably higher as I am writing this). This
stat alone gives a lot of credit to the theory that this Bull may be a Bear in
disguise...

Now, back to the question: Is It A Bubble? Yardeni, obviously, thinks so. He
points to similarities between the Nas' run-up and the Nikkei or Gold Bubbles.
He sure has a point, and the graphs attached to his analysis are not reassuring
at all (I can't publish them, sorry).

But he also writes that these bubbles usually burst when it becomes clear that
expectations won't be met. Unfortunately, the present situation does not give
much clue as when this end will come:

"In the past speculative bubbles attracted too much capital that led to excess
production and capacity. Today, capital is pouring into the New Economy.
Undoubtedly, some of these investments will be worthless. But, quite a few are
likely to produce new products and services for markets that are increasingly
global in scope. (...)

"Time will tell if the Nasdaq rally is just another bubble, or a legitimate
valuation of the New Economy. Favoring the legit side is the impressive
performance of earnings during the fourth quarter of last year, with S&P 500
operating earnings up more than 20% from a year ago. Also impressive is that
the percent of negative earnings surprises was the lowest in several years."

Where are we heading? Not easy to tell, and most unsettling to make a balanced
decision, don't you think?

As for myself, I won't hide the fact that I have taken positions on some tech
stocks in the last few months. I felt that I did not really had the choice, and
hope that my decisions were not based entirely on momentum, but also on value.

In the mean time, I also kept positions on true value picks however. Many have
done awfully bad in the past year, particularly MO and MAT (now a very special
situation). It sure is a big disappointment.

Even though my performance is nothing to be proud of in the last year, I would
still recommend a few of my value picks: Donaldson (DCI), Tootsie Roll (TR) and
Cedar Fair (FUN).

Do your own DD, but I am quite sure you will like DCI. This company shows
double-digit growth for the last 10 years and should finish 2000 with earnings
growth in excess of 20%. The company has a very manageable debt level,
repurchases shares on a regular basis and raises its dividend every year.

Tootsie Roll has been discussed on this board before. Let me remind you of its
incredible profit margin (around 18%), strong balance sheet and annual stock
dividend. This is a keeper in any portfolio IMO.

Cedar Fair, or FUN, doesn't only have a nice dividend, it has shown good growth
possibilities over the years. Peter Lynch recommended the stock in Barron's,
back in 1993. The stock has done well since then if you look at a chart. 2000
should be a great year for this co. New rides on their way and acquisitions
should pay off on the bottom line. Meanwhile, cash the dividend check and don't
worry too much about day-to-day valuations.

Just my opinion.

Nice summary Mark. I like your picks and actually follow two and I am a fan of
Peter Lynch.

I think investors need to play all sides of the street - momentum and value -
soas not to miss out. I like the less inflated techs which sell "picks and
shovels" to the internet like LU, IBM, MOT, and INTC. I also like disruptive
technology companies which own intellectual rights such as the fuel cell
companies MKTY, FCL, PLUG, and BLDP - but these are still a gamble. I find the
only way for me to buy pure internet stocks and biotech stocks is through
mutual funds. I still believe in companies which pay increasing dividends or
frequently buyback shares.

I also like a few pennies like MBHC (33 million in assets and stock at 35 cents
with $1+ a share in assets) - very risky now.

since the fall of 1997. Would you believe that I haven't done a penny with it
yet, even though I am sending a check every once in a while through the DRIP.
Well, I am very patient with this one and will explain you why as soon as
possible.

James, I decided to post here a little r‚sum‚ of a long message I wrote on
February 2 on Yahoo!'s board, as an answer to a post that challenged
Donaldson's merits. I hope you don't mind. I just thought that it would save me
a lot of time and that the results would be the same. Take note that I include
excerpts from the contrarian view between brackets; the following paragraphs
are my answer.

------------------

< 1.) First, that the stock is cheap. Looking in a vacuum, this is a bit true.
This stock has historically traded between 15X-20X forward earnings; it is
currently at 14X. A normal P/E (assume 17.5X) would imply a price of $25-$26,
which we would all agree would be a nice little appreciation from here. If one
assumes growth into perpetuity under the same valuation assumptions certainly
the sky is the limit here. But given the cyclicality of the company, assuming
growth in earnings into perpetuity is not wise.>

I maintain that the stock is cheap on a p/e basis, compared to the over-all
market. Of course, we all that know that the U.S. market (DJIA, S&P 500,
NASDAQ) has reached an extremely rich valuation, on a historical basis. And as
you say, Donaldson being considered a small to medium cap, in a cyclical
sector, has not been as highly valued as the blue chips or internet and
technology stocks lately. But you have to remember that the Asian Crisis has
been very tough for many countries doing business with DCI. Furthermore,
Donaldson's regular customers in the U.S. - the farmers and Caterpillar, in
particular - have suffered through these bad times. I won't say that DCI's
management has been absolutely perfect in the face of this adversity, but the
company has still finished year 1999 with profits. And yes, it was an other
double-digit growth year, even though the numbers were far more impressive than
before. It's unfortunate, there was a financial crisis and Donaldson has
certainly lost some opportunities - or at the very least had to postpone some
projects, which has slowed growth. That's for sure and I admit it.

But does that make Donaldson a laggard? I don't think so. I am still confident
that this is a fast moving and disciplined animal. It has been hurt, maybe sick
for a few months, but it still was able to deliver the goods. It has gone
through the same moves learned over the years: plants have been upgraded; the
dividend has been raised as usual; the shares have been bought back; and these
last few months it has gone back to hunting, with two acquisitions, the last
one adding $80 million to revenues of $944,1 million in 1999. I don't know
about the future, but I see that Donaldson's management is behaving much the
same as in the past. If you look back to 1987, for example, revenues were in
the order of $294,9 million and net earnings, $10,9 million (18 cents per
share). In 1999, we're talking about net earnings of $62,4 million ($1.31 per
share). Thus, for 12 years, we have a compounding annual growth rate of 10.1%
for revenues and 15.6% for earnings. Thanks to share repurchases, earnings per
share have grown at a blistering 17.9% rate. Finally, dividend was a mere 6.5
cents in 1987; in 1999, in 1999 it was 23 cents, for a compounded growth rate
of 11.1%. Not bad either.

<2.) Second, your enthusiasm for stock buybacks, and this links into my first
point. The fact is, Donaldson does not seem to have any meaningful way to use
its cash hoarde other than to buy back stock. It is not very acquisitive, R&D
simply does not play a significant role at the company and it has a healthy
infrastructure established. Valuation multiples will always suffer when EPS
growth is due to the only use of strong cash flow being to buy back stock
rather than spend on internal initiatives. As investors, we pay the company to
grow the business, not shrink the equity base. Considering this, perhaps the
modestly lower valuation currently being awarded DCI shares is warrented. If
so, you may be waiting another 1-2 years to see the stock sustainably higher
than present levels (short-term trading moves, which you abhore, aside).>

Here I don't agree with you at all. Sure, if share buybacks were the only way
Donaldson grew the company, we would have a problem, but let's be honest here,
it's not the reality. I already talked about acquisitions (I should also
emphasize that we have seen too many companies making bad ones...), but R&D is
an other topic. If you look at the financials, you'll see that management
allocates between 2 to 2.5% of revenues to this field every year. Of course,
this is not much compared to Pfizer, to make a comparison, but why would you
spend 20% of revenues in R&D if you have excellent results over the years with
2 to 2.5%? Again, that's just prudent and responsible allocation of capital at
work. R&D? Sure, but not too much R&D.

<A stock price is made of two components, as we all well know: EPS & multiple.
There is a great deal of faith on the former; the latter has never been
discussed on this board (a CIBC analyst discussed it at length some time ago,
but I haven't seen any research on this company out them in a while for some
reason). You should be frustrated by the performance of this stock, but you
should not be surprised.>

Multiple? Yeah! Finally, a good point! And you'll be glad, I agree with you. We
won't see Donaldson trading at a multiple of 100 for a long time if it's what
you're talking about, and we all know that. Maybe, one of these days, if
pollution control becomes a hot sector, as I was dreaming... But in an ordinary
market - I mean, one very different from the current one - I probably would be
very satisfied with a p/e of 15. Now that the market is trading at a p/e of
over 30 however, I am not necessarily disappointed or frustrated as you seem to
think, but, let's say, puzzled... I mean, I hold other stocks and make money
with them, but in regards of Donaldson's intrinsic value and future growth
prospects, I can't help but think that a lot of people are investing in the
wrong issues right now.

Of course, we are in a free country and I am glad to see other people are
getting rich with their investments. It's just that it's a bit sad to witness
the rueful chase to performance, in disregard of the true merit of the
companies... and human beings (management and workers confounded), which are
the living entities behind these stock quotes. I know that some of the "new
economy" companies will entirely deserve the high prices attached to their
stock in the future, but many won't be in business either in a few years.
Meanwhile, the prudent and patient investor should envision future trends and
make sure to position himself in a few selected stocks, while they are
forgotten, in the shadows... in spite of the fact that they are showing good
growth and have a solid future ahead. Which is not to say that you should not
invest in the Linux concept, or buy a "fuel cell" story, but do it with clear
eyes and keep a few bucks for the ones that deliver...

This wouldn't be complete if I forgot to post here Donaldson's last earnings
report:

MINNEAPOLIS, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire/ -- Donaldson Company, Inc. (NYSE: DCI -
news), today reported second-quarter and six-month results for the period ended
January 31, 2000. For the quarter, sales of $259.3 million were up 18 percent
from prior-year comparable quarter sales of $220.2 million. Net earnings of
$17.4 million were up 32 percent from prior-year comparable quarter net
earnings of $13.2 million. Diluted net earnings per share of 37 cents were up
37 percent from prior-year comparable quarter diluted net earnings per share of
27 cents.

For the six-month period, sales of $505.8 million were up 13 percent from
prior-year sales of $445.7 million. Net earnings of $34.4 million were up 30
percent from prior-year net earnings of $26.5 million. Diluted net earnings per
share of 73 cents were up 33 percent from prior-year diluted net earnings per
share of 55 cents.

Total backlogs of $291.1 million were up 16 percent relative to the same period
last year and unchanged from the prior quarter end. Hard order backlogs --
goods scheduled for delivery in 90 days -- of $165.2 million were up 11 percent
from the same period last year and down 3 percent from prior quarter end.

``Our year-to-date results get us off to a great start in fiscal 2000,'
commented William Van Dyke, chairman and chief executive officer. ``Relative to
last year, revenue growth was achieved in both the Engine Products segment and
the Industrial Products segment and across nearly all served product markets,
most notably transportation products, engine aftermarket products, gas turbine
systems and high purity applications. In local currency terms, year-to-date
sales in Europe were up 15 percent from the prior year, while sales in the Asia
Pacific region were essentially flat. Sales in North America were up about 14
percent from the prior year, reflecting strong shipments of transportation
products and gas turbine systems. Gross margins remained at historically high
levels, continuing to benefit from higher capacity utilization, cost reduction
and process improvement efforts. Overall, many positive factors -- sharply
higher revenue, strong gross margin performance, a lower tax rate and fewer
shares outstanding -- combined to provide an outstanding earnings per share
performance in the second quarter and year-to-date period.'

-------------

I'll cap this with an other excerpt from one of my post on Yahoo!'s board:

Donaldson beats the Street's estimate for the fourth consecutive quarter, if I
am not mistaken.

Sales up 18% and EPS up 37%... Not bad at all, for a slow grower... Total
backlogs up 16% bodes well for the 3rd quarter...

Well, with the DCE acquisition completed at the end of January, we should end
up with a pretty good year.

This is all for today.

Evidently.

I look at it this way. If I can take a small proportion of my portfolio and
allocate it towards the internuts through this fund, which has a five year
annualized return of 46%, and make up some of the losses from my non-performing
value stocks then so be it. I think it is kind of bold for the guy to lay out
his decisions for all to see. I don't see any other fund managers doing it. I
figure I got to get in on the action somewhere and this guy has a better track
record than myself for picking tech stocks. I also like the strategy of mixing
in UTEs and REITs in an attempt to provide some form of balance. We can sit
around and beat the value drum until we're blue in the face or invest a small
portion of funds and enjoy some of the crazy returns these other fools are
getting while we wait. I believe others on this thread subscribe to similar
portfolio allocation.

That's fine. I actually hold some of my company stock

but performs worse than your IPS??. But then I can't
buy much else in 401(k).

Yeah, but his reasoning is totally childish. He's worse
than JJC (James Cramer not James Clarke :-))))).
He can make returns - that's luck and guts. But
don't tell me he's got brains. Or else he's lying
in the writeups.

I'd rather buy QQQ or some other tech index.

>I also like the strategy of mixing in UTEs and REITs

Why not do it yourself through QQQ + REIT fund?
At least you know what you gonna get.
But then everyone should buy what they like...

Paul, CTB is interesting me.

The balance sheet is a bit scary with the intangibles and debt, but if they
sell the plastics unit to knock the debt back, this stock may start appealing
to a wider audience.

At a 6 PE, ROE at 14%, I would think the downside is limited. Unless Wal Mart,
Kmart or the internet is going to take over tire retail. (Don't laugh. I ran
into someone a couple of months ago who bought his most recent tires off the

Grommit, I see CTB as a scary buy also. They can't get away from being tagged
as a tire manufacturer - and another drawback, imo, is that they're not one of
the big players either. ROE at about 14% is slipping over the past few years.
And there may be integration and diversification issues also. I do not
understand how this company remains profitable-- but they do.

The relative dividend model I've used on CTB before shows that when the
dividend is 2.5% or greater, CTB is a buy. (stock now yields 3.8%). Another way
I might look at CTB is that given its book value (about $11/sh tangible, $12+
per Yahoo,), but not understanding the recent acquisition- I'd say fair value
might be about $19-21/sh. And the stock occasionally trades there.

I am considering adding to my small CTB position around here ($11).
Also to be considered are other companies in the auto parts, auto subsystems
businesses which may be relatively cheaper than CTB but also have decent
prospects for a gain in 1-2 years. I'm looking to add to my position in DRRA
tomorrow. And I'm looking at DCN. Plus I just may go for the whole car with
DaimlerChrysler (DCX)if it drops a couple of more points or add more Nissan
(NSANY)if it gets nearer to its lows.

Hard to swallow? Yes. These are repeated gut checks for any value investor.
I've been using Enterprise Value/EBITDA with a maximum of 6 as one of my
criteria. Wow. When you hold one of these at 6 and then see the ratio fall to
3, it is indeed hard to swallow. Especially when, like me, you usually don't
take new lows lightly but this time prided yourself on the fundamental value.

But you don't have to buy a high-flyer. That's just a lack of discipline. May I
suggest that any regular here, if ever tempted, try to justify buying a
high-flyer here first before buying? Without discipline, long-term, you might
as well just buy a mutual fund or hire a money manager. Because 99% of people
are undisciplined investors, and 100% of them will be part of the 99.9% of
investors that fail to achieve superior long-term gains. There's just no point.

Myself, I'm starting to see a lot of Buffett-like stocks laying around. This is
a change from when I had to buy a lot of cigar butts, cyclicals, and
decent-companies-at-a-discount the last few years. This is a switch from my
version of Graham-like investing to my version of Buffett-like investing. I
sold Crane and bought Liz Claiborne. That's my first switcharoo. Looking to
make more in the coming weeks and months.

BTW, sold Mattel today; I was suspicious and started looking for an exit when
the numbers came out. Now S&P's debt downgrade nicely summarized my suspicions.
I'm outta there. This is a good example of a free S&P debt report detailing the

Berkley Petroleum. T.BKP

Canadian explorer founded by ex-Shell management in 1993. CEO is a geologist.

Since inception has maintained profitability despite weak gas markets and
depression level oil prices.

Production breakdown. appx 60% gas, 40% liquids. Production growth currently
focused on gas.

Growth: Production growth/share in excess of 80% over past 5 years. Reserve
growth appx 25%, with simultaneous growth in both proven and probable reserves.

Reserves: 1.2 TCF proven + probable.

Share price reflects uncertainty of California exploration, but discounts any
possible success there. It also discounts recent success in the NWT with
Chevron.

By most estimates of 99 reserve additions, a share price of 9 Canadian is a
discount to asset value. When year end reserves are published we'll know for
certain. Today it closed at 8.85 cd. Regardless if the current share price
discounts Ca, if California is dry the share price will suffer. A reasonable
strategy would be to accumulate under 9, with plans to avg in over the next 3-4
months as the results from Ca. become clear. This will also mitigate any
weakness from OPEC March production increases (if any).

I'm with Mike on the issue of "you've got to buy at least a couple of tech
highflyers just to participate". Am I tempted? No. Even a little bit? No. Do I
wish I had bought a few of these two years ago? Or even a month ago? Of course,
but I didn't. I find it ironic that just as the broader market - and especially
value stocks - is really getting favorable for a value investor, value
investors are getting tempted by the mania. You wonder why the Dow goes down
150 points and the Nasdaq goes up 100 points on the same day? This is why.
We've got to be near the end. The end comes when everybody who is left to buy
has already bought.

Somebody is going to be the last one to buy into this game of greater fool and
take the cake as the greatest fool of all. Its not going to be me. Wouldn't it
be ironic if it is value investors that provide the tech mania its greatest
fool? I know this game on the other side, when a stock collapses and the last
sellers at the bottom are value investors who should have known better, but are
terrified. Same effect at the top, I presume. When investors who know better
stay disciplined and stay disciplined, then finally give in. That's the end.

In deference to the guys on AOL who bought these tech stocks 2 or 3 years ago,
I mean fool in the lowercase. If they're as smart as they were then (and I'm
not at all sure they are) they will be the ones selling to you.

The value discipline is fairly simple. Buy things for less than they're worth.
Period. If that's not working at the moment, have patience. I know its hard now
- I'm getting killed too and since I do this professionally I've got a lot more
at stake in it than money. Now is not the time to compromise. Now is the time
to be ordering annual reports from your 50 dream investments that "never" get
to your price and start picking prices. Or just look at what is in the litter
box right now - there are a lot of great companies out there trading at really
cheap prices.

I bought a little more Berkshire Hathaway today, and I am looking at Merck and
adding to SNH whenever I can put two nickels together.

"The end comes when everybody who is left to buy has already bought."

A little simplistic perhaps. In my opinion 3 things are fundamentally different
than when I started investing about 35 years ago. Few individual investors
allocate significant amounts of money to fixed income investments. Individual
investors now manage their own retirement funds because of the decline in
defined benefit plans (which by the way typically used to be invested in fixed
income through insurance companies). Lastly I have never seen such a
disinterest in value stocks (which somewhat resemble fixed income), even in the
heyday of the "go-go" and "nifty-fifty" days of the late 60's.

In my opinion, the end comes with a recession that damages the earnings of
these tech companies. A homebuilder with declining earnings at 4 times earnings
will then look a lot better that the latest tech stock at 200 times with
declining earnings.

As for discipline, well, you sound very Buffett-like when you talk about it...
and I don't say it negatively at all. In fact, I admire you to stick to your
principles. I just can't follow the same strategy. Too tough and frustrating.

Anyway, as I said, I still believe in value and holds to my TR, DCI, FUN, MO
and GBT.a (TSE). In the long term I am quite confident that they will perform
well. Furthermore, at current valuation I'd be glad to add to my positions if I
had some cash to invest.

I have mentioned my some of my selections on this thread from time to time but
only when I could see a value component to them. Otherwise it would seem
utterly inappropriate for this thread. I recently mentioned Alliance
Semiconductor. In the past I mentioned ORTL, MRVC, and unfortunately THQI,
which becomes more of a value stock everyday it seems. I believe that what we
are seeing now is the cannibalization of value portfolios by investors trying
to improve their returns by shifting from value to technology, the perception
being that as long as the fed raises interest rates all the interest sensitive
business suffer- financials, home builders, retailers, consumer non durables,
while the techs do not. I still see all the trends pointing away from these
stocks, and as I said before there is not the dividend protection there once
was- corporate executives love the concept of buy backs instead, so expect to
see more of those as the price declines. I have a small position in CMH and a
larger position in SNH both down significantly.
I am watching those and also USU, to see if that one ever bottoms, but in the
meantime the IPO market continues to rock and when you get 100% appreciation in
one day or more it will continue to attract lots of attention. I personally am
looking for GE to keep coming down, just can't see a finance company going for
40 times earnings. I also do not understand the concept of paying 2-3 times
growth for any company.

Speaking of USU:

Reading the Yahoo threads on this continues to be very illuminating- Also note
that debt of USU downgraded to Junk bond status which will now allow them to
close one of their plants- The dilemma seems to be that the one which is more
efficient is in Paducah and surrounded by old bomb parts, tritium, berrylium
and the like while the other plant may not be economic at current prices. Right
now I don't like the equity holders chances of coming out alive on this one.

I don;t know what your background is. I spent 20 years in banking including 5
doing workouts, and a few years analyzing finance companies. If you have spent
a week analyzing this company and come back and tell us why this is such a good
buy, I will greatly appreciate it. In the 20 minutes I have spent looking at it
I can tell you that it would take me about a week to figure something out here.
Some danger signals I could spot in the 20 minutes are that they had to amend
the bank agreements about 5 times this year due to violations of loan covenants
and they also took huge losses in part as a reduction of retained equity
interests in securitized portfolios. Presumably each bank involved in this loan
has gone around an done a pretty comprehensive audit on this company. My guess
is that they don;t like what they see and the only way they have a shot at
coming out whole is if this gets into stronger hands.
I have seen this before and what usually happens is that the principals get
some large consulting contract to stay on, and the existing shareholders get
wiped out. I have been wrong many times before but IMHO unless you are privy to
the info contained in a detailed audit you have no way of knowing whether this
company is even solvent. Please correct me if I am wrong as this old dog is
always willing to learn new tricks.

In a nutshell there is a lot of debt here, and book represents an estimation of
realizable values and when you are talking about residual interests in
mortgages that is a highly volatile figure. Not only that but it looks like
they missed the boat badly in their estimates last year. How do we know the
estimate is going to be any better this year? You could make a bundle or lose
everything but without a lot of anlaysis and accesss to an audit report I have
no idea what the outcome for shareholders will be.

Armin, I agree wholeheartedly with your post. I would add CTX to the list of
beaten down stocks worth watching. However, I am changing my strategy on a
gradual basis. My money in stocks is now up 5 times from where it was in
October 1998 (which was a horrible year for me). I am now concerned more with
"the return of my capital than the return on my capital", to paraphrase someone
whose name escapes me. Therefore, I am dribbling out my tech stocks on rallies
by either selling a little or writing some short duration calls with handsome
premiums at or in the money.

Lastly, I am looking at these beaten down stocks as my time horizon is very
long and I do not believe the value disparity will be nearly so large in 5
years. In particular, I am looking at only Number 1 or 2 companies in an
industry category. That is not because there might not be even better values
lower down, but I want to give myself the best shot if sentiment turns even
slightly. I bought a small position in HRC today.

<<Is it possible that this number is dramatically overstated?>> Book value is
made up of loans, loans held for sale, and securization assets. Offset by very
high leverage. So the short answer to your question is "uh, yeah". Looks like
Crimmi Mae just before it went bankrupt. Here I would be looking for one thing
- bankruptcy risk. That has little to do with book value when you have this
much leverage and everything to do with liquidity. i.e. do assets match
liabilities in terms of duration and maturities? And what is going on
off-balance sheet?

Hello all,
I hope no one minds me dropping in on the thread as my style of investing has
definitely changed over the years I have been getting more and more into value
investing over the momentum plays as I found myself getting more burned often
than not.

I invested (at the recommendation of my broker) in SAFC last week. From a
Technical analysis of the stock action I am not sure I caught the bottom but
the Safco stock has taken a beating of over 50%, currently trading at <$21 with
a book value of $35+. Dividend yield is 7%. Earnings for the next 2 years are
projected to increase over 25% each year.

Anyway I thought I would throw out for consideration the stock that I felt was
the best value that I have come across recently and look forward to reading
everyone elses from here on out now that I have bookmarked the thread.

Good luck to everyone.

Jim, on EBSC, I agree. By the way, I think this demonstrates that even with
these cheap, balance-sheet play stocks you need to see a catalyst plus some
non-balance sheet margin of safety, to really feel comfortable. The 13D holders
were my catalyst when I bought it and in effect have now come through (we
hope). My margin of safety was very good November sales results which if
repeated for December (which they were not) would have given outstanding
yearend results and a nice bump in the price.

Jeffrey,

Did you get a chance to shift through T.BKP?

The long period of undervaluation of E&P companies will not last. Despite
several quarters of good energy prices, the threat of OPEC capitulation and
subsequent low energy prices has resulted in a prolonged period of market
aversion to this sector. A catalyst for renewed confidence in the sector could
be the March OPEC meeting. Sustained OPEC resolve will bring the entire sector
back to normal valuations. Those demonstrating leadership in growth (such as
BKP) will again trade at premiums.

Even the most admired firms have recently seen an inverse relationship between
their valuation and the value of the product they produce. CHV, APA come to
mind. The decline in their share price at a time of $30 oil is unusual - but
also fortuitous for potential investors.

FIT's FY 1999 10-K just came out. Check out some of these numbers ($12 = $61
million market cap)

$12 of cash and marketable securities

Textile business lost about $5-6 million on a GAAP basis last year, but poured
out cash as working capital was liquidated and capital expenditures ceased.
1999 free cash flow of about $3 a share. This is not sustainable, but it does
feel as if I am looking at a stealth liquidation here, which is exactly what
I'd want this management doing if they are not prepared to sell the whole thing
at once.

Net-net of $16.80/share plus 1.2 million square feet of industrial real estate
owned free and clear. Call it 10 bucks a foot and there's another $2.00+ per
share of asset value. Book value is about $24.

The CEO is 80 years old.

The stock pays a dividend of 70 cents per year. (~6% yield)

Need some accounting help:

In several recent stocks I've been looking at (Equifax, Dun & Bradstreet) it
appears that there have been huge charge-offs against equity due to foreign
currency translation as a result of depreciating foreign currencies relative to
the dollar. I'm no exactly sure how to interpret and value this, especially as
respect to cash flow analysis and cash return on equity/cash return on capital
calculations. Does it show up in cash flows? If not, is it becuase the profits
are made in foreign locales and largely stay in foreign locales for
reinvestment so it is really more of just an accountant's trick to bring
everything into US dollars? I'd appreciate any clarity that can be offered.

I don't know if this will add clarity or not- but I would distinguish between
the cash flows and the non cash flows.
In otherwords there are assets and liabilities that are fixed assets but are
valued in foreign currency and then have to be translated for exchange
purposes- those would not effect cash flow.
Then you have foreign sales and expenses and short term foreign assets and
liabilities and those would effect cash flow.

Mike,

Foreign assets are valued in the local currency. If that currency is
subsequently devalued relative to the dollar then you have lost money. Currency
exchange rates do not have much effect on the price of local products and
services in the local currency, except for imported items. Let's say you buy
Juan's Repair Shop in Mexico. The purchase price is 1,000 pesos. The exchange
rate is 25 pesos to the dollar. Juan's business would cost you $250. If the
next day the peso is devalued to 20 pesos to the dollar then you have lost $50
in equity. You still own the business, but the dollar value of future cash
flows has become less valuable by 20%. Those 10 pesos a day in profits would
now only bring you $2.00 instead of $2.50 you were expecting when you bought
the business. If you were to try and sell the business you would only receive
1,000 pesos ($200). The exchange rate would have little to no effect on the
price of Juan's Repair Shop. A local purchaser of Juan's would not feel these
effects except in that his 10 pesos profit would not buy as much American
product. I think the key is to remember that as a US owner you will now receive
fewer dollars from that foreign business, with regards to current income and
the future sale of the business.

Let's say you buy Juan's Repair Shop in Mexico. The purchase price is 1,000

you $250.

Wouldn't the price be $40 if the exchange rate is 25 pesos per dollar?

 If the next day the peso is devalued to 20 pesos to the dollar then you have
lost $50 in equity.

A change in the exchange rate from 25 to 20 pesos per dollar would be an
increase in the value of the peso relative to the dollar, and the business
would now be worth $50, unless I am missing something.

Lets take another cut at that example. Currencies are tough for me too. I like
the simplicity of that example, but I don't like the math. Lets agree that if
the peso goes from 25/$ to 20/$ that's not a devaluation, its an appreciation
relative to the dollar. I think your illustration wanted to go the other
direction.
