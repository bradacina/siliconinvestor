RE: Magellan Petroleum Corporation (NasdaqCM: MPET )

Some discussion on Yahoo that a large investor was selling shares. I guess they
gave up on the investment especially w/ management's new focus on developing
their strategic reserves.

Not too sure if I agree with it either and do not know the track record of the
development team. I have a small starter position and am not convinced to build
it up until I know that resources are going to be deployed in their U.S.
properties. The company is a bit cash strapped and will have to explore JV
partners and/or raising more money to develop these reserves.

I guess this is the nature of these E&P companies.

====================================================================

GMX Resources Inc. (GMXR) off 7% and back down to it's 50-day MA ($4.53/share).
It finally sold off on heavy volume (1.5 times daily average) so it may test
some of the recent lower lows ($4.30/share level). I will be adding some more
shares as I think this one is further along than MPET in building cash flows
out of their proven reserves.

I can also hedge GMXR by selling covered calls. MPET does not trade options.

I plan to also add shares of Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB) and MDU Resources
Group, Inc. Commo(NYSE: MDU ) on any further correction. I think WMB is
significantly undervalued but it has more exposure to NG than you like. If the
dividend yields go above 3% then I will make some buys in size.

My Empire District Electric Co. (EDE) which now yields 5.5% down from 7.5% s/b
called away from me in December allowing me to book a 25% gain YTD. I plan to
deploy these funds into my basket of E&P companies w/ 70% going into MDU & WMB.

====================================================================

There is definitely interest in these domestic shale fields for both Oil & NG.
As long as I see big money sniffing around to acquire acreage in both developed
& undeveloped well locations, I will continue to commit money to the sector. I
expect to see a lot more JV's and project acquisitions from the big
integrators. Both MPET and GMXR could be the beneficiaries of these new
investments.

<Facebook is all about getting laid>

Hmmm... Well, at 34, I think facebook is mostly about stay-at-home moms telling
all of their friends at once what they've done that day and/or what their
children said. I personally like facebook so that when I see people, I can skip
asking them what they've been doing the last week/month because I know via
facebook. Then, I can talk to them about something more interesting.

I think it's a bit risky for people to use facebook to get laid as spurned
lovers can pretty easily make your life hell by posting mean things to your
wall or their own wall.

I think twitter is more readily available for that purpose as you don't have to
post your real name and I believe you can join groups towards that purpose.
Though, I'm not proficient with twitter...

Hi Paul -

Thank you for the link to Josh Young's interview (California-based Young
Capital Management). Based on the article, I started a position in Gastar
Exploration, Ltd. (GST).

From his interview:"...You mentioned Gastar earlier. That’s an exploration and
production (E&P) company with a market cap of about $200 million. A recent
Canaccord Adams research report said, “Gastar is an attractively priced
Marcellus producer given its relative growth potential.” Canaccord has a buy
rating of $4.50 on it. Meanwhile, Rodman & Renshaw has a target of $5.50 on
Gastar. What are some of the catalysts there?

JY: Well, Gastar just did an acquisition but the stock doesn’t seem to have
priced in the value creation from that acquisition. The company hasn’t
announced the metrics on the transaction; but, based on the understanding of
some of the research analysts that I’ve spoken with and some
back-of-the-envelope math, Gastar just bought north of 50,000 acres at $1,000
an acre or less in the Marcellus. They bought it in the dry gas area, but in a
very good area of West Virginia. That’s tremendously positive for the company.
There are some big questions, though. What is the exact price Gastar paid? How
will they finance the acreage acquisition and development? And did their
existing JV partner decide to participate with it in the acquisition, or will
they seek an additional JV partner?

Gastar recently sold acreage to its joint venture partner at more than $4,000
an acre, and here it is buying similarly high-quality acreage at $1,000 an acre
or even less. That’s huge, especially for a company as small as Gastar. Gastar
is now likely the most levered company in the Marcellus by enterprise value, at
least among those that are publicly traded.

Gastar has really transformed itself to a certain extent into a Marcellus
acreage play, and an extremely attractively priced one at that. This catalyst
has already played out and it’s just a question of the price the company is
paying. I think the market will be further surprised by other additional
upcoming catalysts, such as the results from their oily Eagle Ford and Glen
Rose wells in East Texas—you could see upside to the $5.50 price target that
Rodman & Renshaw put out, and I really respect the analysts at both Rodman and
Canaccord. Rodman recently upgraded RAME and raised their price target, and I
suspect that could happen for Gastar as these catalysts play out...".
=====================================================================

From the article above, GST may have acquired this acreage for around
$1,000/acre. That's good enough for me to start a tracking position.

GRVY Updates:

Good News - Solid results this quarter from Gravity at $0.08/share on a $1.80
stock generally trading near cash levels. It's nice to see them put up a decent
quarter once in a while, at least.

Bad News - Ragnarok 2 release is now scheduled for Q2 2011.

My take:

Coincidentally, I think this is a good stock for a 1-2% position, but recently
it went up to 4% and I took an opportunity to sell some shares to get me back
to 2%. I tend to buy shares around $1.45 to get me into too big of a position
for my long-term tastes, and then lighten up when I feel is a good opportunity.
Too bad I did it a couple of days ago...

I'm not happy with the Ragnarok 2 release, but I do feel like this company is
still cheap and is diversifying into other games. I'm therefore going to hold
my remaining position even with the RO2 delay (again).

re FCF formulas - some formulas include working capital changes some don't. The
argument can be made either way - if inventory can be regarded as a cash
equivalent (low risk) it's probably reasonable to exclude changes in inventory
or account receivables. In other cases, it's done for convenience since the
inventory numbers fluctuate a lot (seasonal swings etc). In these cases, i
would exclude these variation for convenience but I'd check if inventory or
receivables scale with revenues YOY.

I have seen FCF calculated that include or exclude interest rate payments. I
usually include it because it is a real expense that cannot be changed
typically. However folks that look at takeover valuations should exclude
interest rate payments (but have to include provisions for existing debt)
because the debt will be refinanced anyways and interest rate payment will
change.

So the answer about what is right or wrong depends on what you want to know and
what is convenient to calculate.

TYG, others mentioned here:

"Analyst: Funds Investing In MLPs Set For 10-13% Annualized Growth" (Barron's
11/17)

"Despite this year’s strong run by closed-end funds that invest in
master-limited partnerships, the group remains undervalued and positioned for
more growth, according to a report by Ladenburg Thalmann issued Wednesday...

Analyst Eduardo Seda believes that yields should average in the 3%-6.5% range
over the next few years for closed-end funds focused on MLPs.

The average yield on MLP CEFs now is roughly 6.3%, he noted.

His projection is that the group should produce annualized total returns —
counting yield plus price appreciation — of 10% to 13% in the next five years.

Some of the MLP CEFs funds Seda views as best-positioned for total return
growth through 2015 include:

* The Cushing MLP Total Return Fund (SRV)
* The Claymore MLP Opportunity Fund (FMO)
* The Kayne Anderson MLP Investment Co. Fund (KYN)
* The Kayne Anderson Energy Total Return Fund (KYE)
* The Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Fund (TYG)
* The ClearBridge Energy MLP Fund (CEM)

“The MLP sector is positioned to benefit from several growth opportunities as a
result of new discoveries of oil and natural gas resources, as well as from a
recovery in the U.S. economy,” Seda wrote."

my shares I bought in the $2.50/share range are looking pretty good now. 15% of
my shares are still at higher levels but I have my average cost down to
$4.60/share.

Stock could go to the $15.00/share range in 1-2 years when their capital

Since nobody's answering...

DIT - I would not buy such business at all. Distributing is lousy business,
margins are very low, debt to equity high. Why would you invest in something
where the company is not generating money half of the time and when it is, it's
less than 1% of revenues?

So sorry, but I won't help you with the FCF valuation, since it's not worth to

re GM - make sure you are not the bagholder. Even after the bankruptcy, the
balance sheet does not look that pretty to me:
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1467858/000119312510263484/d424b1.htm

1.5B shares outstanding @33$=49.5B$ market cap.

For that you get:
23.&B$ in equity (15.8$/share)
~49B$ in intangibles !
~27B$ in pension and health care underfunding (this number appears to be
growing due to low interest rates - they have a 8.4% cap rate)
~3.5$/share in "earnings"

It's amazing that this equity piece was offered to the public. I don't even see
a real cash flow statement in the filings, with all the adjustments and fresh
start accounting it's hard to back out the operating numbers. Tangible equity
seems deeply in the red. Why in the hell would you buy a mediocre car company
at 2x stated book? GM might look OK in the recovery phase but at the next
recession - they will be looking into the bankruptcy abyss again.

who in their right mind would buy stock in GM? Did all their competitors go out

HEAT. These are not killers for me. HEAT slow to collect payments, too slow
given rise in a/r, but customers seem solid industrial end-users from what I
can understand. Inventory growth in excess of sales growth is a red flag, yes.
I suspect cash reduction means company is using cash to build inventory. That's
okay, if they can sell product.

My feeling now coming off ACTS is rather than holding cash-rich ACTS where the
cash just stays and stays and I don't see any stock gain, I'd rather hold
something like HEAT where I have a shot at a gain after they put cash into
inventory which they hope sells. Or they issue stock for cash for acquisitions.

Company looks to me like it operates in a little niche business in China with
growth prospects. Stock should reflect earnings, if they're there.

49erfan09. What is the question you want answered?

I suspect you are asking a "how" question -- how to evaluate distributors on
FCH.

To me, the unasked question should be, "why" -- why use FCF at all to evaluate
Amcon? Just because Monish Pabrai says that's what he does with distributors?
You also say he uses multiple techniques. "In some cases you can only count on
liquidation value". So you are not talking about liquidation value for Amcom?

I ask because I use price/book value in evaluating distributors. I like
investing in distributors. Over the past ten years I maybe have mentioned a
dozen or two here that I've bought and sold -- with most buys and sells
primarily based on historical book value. (CORE, SYY maybe exceptions) I rarely
use FCF, and never for distributors.
Amcon's too expensive for a value buy, by the way I look at it.
Jmo.

Otoh, p/e is low and roe is high. On that view, the stock seems undervalued.
Back otoh, how a distributor can have high roe, seems strange to me. (It should
be a low margin business with many competitors.) Helps roe though when your
debt level is very high (as Amcon's is). This company could be swamped if an
aggressive SYY or somebody moves into their space. Maybe though, it's not so
much about the good numbers DIT shows, it's about consolidation in the sector
and Ancon as a possible takeover candidate. That I could see.

---------
Away from the financial aspects, you might also want to review the current
status of gov't vs. cigarette sales. (Ancon apparently big in cigarette
distribution.) There've been articles about distribution to these convenience
stores being strongly monitored/controlled because of sales to minors. CORE,
which I have, has suggested it's moving itself toward supplying more fresh food
items to these stores and relying less on smokes. (Cig sales have the very high
profit margins for distributors.)

Re: Gastar Exploration Ltd New Ordi (AMEX: GST )

It's hard to quantify the "actual" value in these small E&P companies but the
perceived value seems to change day to day based on news and investor

Hi Spek

General Motors Company Common S (NYSE: GM) - I wonder if you are going to see
any significant shorting after the 30 day lock out period expires?

What do you think of Ford Motor Co. (F) at current levels? I sold a few shares
in the $12.00 range earlier this year but continue to hold the majority of my
shares.

During the melt down, I owned both F and GM. I sold the last of my GM on
12/2008 at $4.35 and rolled the proceeds into F. I think I would have been
better off to avoid all the auto makers at that time but it appeared that Ford
seemed to be the value play.

Based on the economy, GM car models vs competitors, I would be tempted to short
GM above $40.00/share rather than buy. I consider F a hold and am waiting for
them to eventually reinstate their dividend.

Hi Matt

Re: Covered Call

From the list you posted here are the stocks I own.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?s=CNX,WMB,HAL&d=v7

I own these and continue to accumulate shares at or below their 200d MA. I have
no intention to write covered calls on these unless they sell well above their
50d MA and I believe they no longer have intrinsic value.

My strategy has changed over the years on covered calls. When I was younger
(over 20 years ago) and did not have too much investment capital, I did a lot
of buy write strategies. I collected dividends, call premium and usually got
the stock called away. I typically focused on buying value stocks that later
became a multi bagger if I just held 2-3 years.

Now, that I am wiser (grrr) I try to use covered calls to hedge a more
speculative position (those that typically do not pay dividends) to generate a
guaranteed income stream on the investment. My goal is to make sure I obtain
some minimum rate of return (at least 10%) on every speculative investment.

The other strategy for covered calls is to juice the dividend return by writing
covered calls on high paying dividend stocks (ie. typically MLP's or REITs). I
will try to buy at a value price (below 200d MA), let the stock run, then sell
a 6 month covered call on a portion or all of the stock owned.

There are many different strategies to use covered calls on. With value
investments, it may take the market a long time to realize the true intrinsic
value that you do. By writing a few covered calls, you can collect the call
premiums while you wait. Sometimes you guess wrong and the stock gets called
away on a buyout.

My other rule of thumb is to sell a covered call out six months at $1.00 or
more. Remember a covered call is like renting your stock position out. Calls
are not that liquid on some companies and the spreads are huge. I use the Black
& Scholes pricing model to determine the "fair value" to price the call.

Finally, I have made a lot more money holding on for the multi bagger than
collecting the call premiums. However, when combined with an overall buy sell
strategy, it helps me generate the revenue streams I need to pay my bills.

Being in these situations is discouraging. Because it seems likely that we'll
never get back to break even, given the very high cost basis in relation to low
current price. So there's always the nagging feeling to just cut loose, take
the loss, and move on.

However, past is past, and it's a matter of what'll happen in the future. If
there's some belief the stock might do well going forward, then that's a stock
to hold on to, regardless that we might never see break even. That is, with
DPDW, if business does stay okay or get better, DPDW is a nickel-dime stock
that could double or triple or better. In that case, holding it could be better
than selling out now and risking those funds elsewhere.

E_K_S,

I like your covered call strategy. I'm just starting covered calls with a
portion of my portfolio and I've liked both your buy-writes here in GST and
GMXR. When you've wrote the calls, did you do it as a buy-write when you bought
the stock, or did you buy the stock first and watch it move up a bit? I've
noticed that on GST you got your call sold at the ask and your GMXR was at
favorable pricing between the bid and ask.

I think with these two stocks it's a good play as it protects you against any
medium-term drop in NG while still giving you good return potential if called
away.

I've got some shares in SD in the low 5's and I'm considering writing writing
calls at 6 in March or June for decent premiums. I'm waiting for more of a
run-up in SD though if I can get it.

Thanks,

Hi cwillyg -

My first step when considering possible trade is that the stock must be a value
buy or at least a speculative value find. I also check the candidates of stocks
to see if they trade options, if they have a large open interest and just how
liquid the options trade (are there large bid/ask spreads?).

Typically, I will begin to just accumulate shares (usually a tracking position)
in the stock as I research the news, pending projects, management and
financials (are there proposed secondary offerings around the corner?).

Once the position begins to move in my favor, I might explore a covered call
strategy depending on (1) the annual dividend rate & ex dividend date(s), (2)
earnings outlook and expected growth and (3) what I expect the position should
contribute in gains to the overall portfolio. If I plan to hold 2-3 years and
the dividend yield is under 5%, I will explore a possible covered call strategy
on a portion of the position.

Never have I before been involved with E&P companies where there has been so
much volatility. These are pretty much high risk high return positions. Since
the portfolio must generate some return on each position, longer term holds
that pays no dividend become candidate for me writing covered calls.

Because of the huge price changes in GMXR the Black & Scholes volatility factor
is large (around 87%) vs the volatility factor for GST (recently around 67%).
The higher the volatility factor the larger the call premium.

That said, it does not always work out as planned. I accumulated a lot of
shares of MHR in the high $3's but was too quick selling some May $5.00 calls.
I generated enough income to guarantee the portfolio a 25% return on my capital
invested (if the stock is called away). Unfortunately the calls I sold have
doubled in price since I sold them. I was too early but achieved my goal of
generating enough income to justify holding the uncovered shares too. My total
MHR position is much higher in value AND I was able to guarantee a income
stream to the portfolio through MAY 2011.

Therefore, my call option strategy is more structured for a buy and long term
hold of an undervalued position. Daily and weekly movements really do not
matter once I have established my core holding. As for setting the Buy/Write
position at the time I do the Buy... I don't. If I do my Buy correctly, it is
after a sell off, on bad news or just in a down market day. These are all bad
events for maximizing the call sale price. I try to sell the calls when there
is a break out in the stock, the stock is selling at or above it's 50d MA or an
unusually one or two day rally (over 20%) that allows me to lock in the
guaranteed income stream (or at least 50% of what I need) I need for my core
position to return the minimum income to the portfolio.

It sounds somewhat complected but it really is not. It's just a strategy I have
come to use that forces me to peel off gains from potential winners. Hope this
helps.

There seems to be more than one model or "solution" that works in investing.
Or, some models work sometimes, some other times. Sometimes, we have seen
nothing works in investing.

I buy:

High roe and low p/e stocks

Low p/bk stocks

Low relative p/e stocks. Reversion-to-mean type p/e stocks.

Stocks with increasing dividends

Stocks with relatively (to themselves and to the S&P yield) high dividend
yields.

Stocks below cash value or below net current assets

Also:

Stocks based on insider buying

Stocks with a management with a history of delivering results ("betting on the

Stocks that other investors are buying (e.g. Buffett, Cooperman, Klarman,

I seem to be moving toward "themes". In particular, this year, as regards
looking at potential growth over margin-of-safety value, I find myself focusing

fourteen years people here - and the market - have been telling me I'm wrong.
-g-

What are your actual results over those fourteen years compared to the market
indexes?

According to my broker, in my largest account, an ira, the best they can tell
me is from 2/1/'03 to 10/31/'10 my annualized return is 12.4%. In my second
largest account, a taxable account, the broker says 18.2% over that same time
period. The broker shows the calculations take account of adds/withdrawals --
although I don't know the methodology.

Somewhere around '08 with the market debacle, with these accounts 99% in common
stocks, I got scared out of many and decided maybe I really ought to have
listened to Dr. Graham, and have a balance of stocks AND bonds --I am a senior
citizen after all, so maybe it's time. (Minimum 25% in bond's he's said.) So I
went into bonds -- rather heavily in my ira. (In my case, with bond funds and
preferred stocks.) Which means I was willing to forgo possible gains from value
stocks for instead, more safety or assurance of bonds. Somehow I suspect going
much more "conservative" has affected my subsequent performance. Although the
market's come back strongly and bond funds have performed well, I'm still down
substantially in these two portfolios from peaks achieved '07 or '08.

Dan,

Yes of course, that's why i mention it. They play the analyst/fee game better
than anyone.

There is not much logic in the list of stocks that they throw out.

Thanks for the reply.

What are some value investor's criteria for value stocks? I know that many
technology stocks put a substantial amount into R&D. How much is too much?

Thanks

Depends on what kind of value investor and what kind of stock. ;)

For high ROE stocks, I use a mix of DCF, Buffettology spreadsheet future
earnings estimate, current earnings/EV. The ultimate decision is not one number
though.

For NCAV, I'd just want a reasonable discount, understanding of company's
business, expectation of no significant losses.

many technology stocks put a substantial amount into R&D. How much is too much?

I never looked at this. Probably if they spend so much that the earnings are
poor, then it's too much. But I have not seen companies fail because they spend
too much on R&D. If they fail, it's because they are not selling their
products.

@Jurgis Bekepuris

Thank you for the prompt reply.

I'm looking at being more growth focused as described in Buffett Beyond Value
because it really fits what Buffett is doing in my opinion.

I'm experimenting with DCF, historical ROE, share buy back, treasury stock, and
current earnings/EV. I'm looking to add a free cash flow method into the mix as
well. Would you be kind enough to point me to any?

Also is Price to Book more deadly to a company or Price to Earnings? I'm
inclined to think the latter.

For example, lets consider today's example of PEP vs KO.

PEP is the better deal right? Despite having a higher P/B.

FCF - well, sometimes I use FCF/EV instead of Earnings/EV. Not often, since FCF
takes longer to calculate and usually it does not matter which one is used.
I'll go with Buffett's "I'd rather be approximately right than precisely
wrong". :) However, you can experiment with replacing FCF wherever you use
earnings and see if the replacement makes sense and gives you better results.

Regarding PEP vs. KO. I would not judge which one is better deal right now. I
would not buy either, since IMHO neither is very cheap. If I was pressed to
choose, I'd probably buy PEP. However, it's a tough choice. KO has had better
recent earnings and sales growth (last 3 years), PEP is cheaper on PE basis,
E/EV is pretty similar. Tough choice and I'd rather not make it. :)

What stocks are in the hotseat in respect to the type of value investing you
are familiar with?

On my screens, because I go 1Billion+ EV only, i'm getting notable stocks like:

PEP who has 30%+ ROE for the last 10 years, 10% EPS growth for the last 10
years, 5% Revenue Growth for the last 10 years and 19% Debt/Assets.

UNH who has 22% ROE for the last 10 years, 23% EPS growth rate for the last 10
years, 16% Revenue Growth for the last 10 years with 18% Debt/Assets.

GD who has 19% ROE for the last 10 years, 11% EPS growth rate for the last 10
years, 14% Revenue Growth for the last 10 years with 12% Debt/Assets.

There's also SYK, MDT, CSCO, GSK, XOM, CVX...

Is my criteria not picky enough?

I'm choosing stocks with ROE > 17.5% in the last 5 years, 10 year EPS/Revenue
growth at > 10/5 respectively and Debt/Assets <40%, PE <20.

Anything I should be more stringy upon?

Your criteria are good, stock list is good too. :) But getting a stock list is
the easy part, especially if you're using numeric criteria. The real work is
processing that list with your brain and then buying and selling. ;)

Out of your list I own a small position in MDT. Not very cheap, but OK.

UNH is a bit outside my zone of comfort and expertise.

PEP, CSCO, SYK are too expensive for me.

GD is close to a buy, but there is an issue of potential government cuts, even
though defense budget is somewhat sacred cow.

GSK might be close to a buy, but pharmas are overall cheap due to pipeline and
regulatory issues. I'd probably buy something like GILD, but GSK is not bad,
its consumer product division is a good asset.

XOM, CVX - I prefer purer E&P plays in that sector or alternatively TOT and E.
But XOM and CVX are probably OK buys.

I'm not sure why you would want more stringent criteria. If you are looking to
find one or two super deals to invest into, you will never find them using
numeric screens. Furthermore, I believe very few people are good enough to
select two companies, invest in them and show great long term results. Even
Buffett never owned only two stocks. :) So if you like stocks on your list, buy
positions in all of them and see how that works out. :)

Regarding stocks in "hotseat", I post my buy/sell updates on this board
periodically. I have no other companies that I could suggest. Feel welcome to
ask details about any of my buys or sells.
