Anyone who plans to work in the market full-time has to learn to accept that
every single day, hundreds or thousands of stocks will go up that that manager
does not own and had not considered. I'd love to have a service that surveys
that universe and delivers the ten best new high ideas on my doorstep every
day, but most momentum newsletters I have seen are just that, not really
grounded in value too.

I agree 100% that one should be accountable solely for one's own numbers,

Re: MHRpC - ex-dividend tomorrow interesting trading again this month.

176K shares with a high of $25.15/share. The dividend is $.2135/share so stock
should trade tomorrow at $24.79/share. Stock typically goes back to
$24.94/share or higher in approx three trading days. Company still has over 5
million shares yet to sell at par to complete their authorized limit. It looks
like .5 million shares/month are being bought on average so there s/b plenty of
shares available at par (ie $25/share) at least through Nov 2011.

Nice to see that there is good demand for this preferred every ex-dividend
period. There is good liquidity for dividend capture strategies.

Hi rlee - Your best price will be when it goes ex-dividend. If MHRpC holds at

MCsweet,

I agree that under-followed or hated stocks may outperform the recommended
stocks. I agree investors should look at all stocks whether they are
recommended or not. I do so.

However, let's look at article's implication that you shouldn't buy top
recommendations. The title says: "Why You Shouldn't Trust Wall Street's Top
Stocks for 2011". Why?

There's good reasoning: top picks outperformed in 2010, but underperformed in
2009 and 2008; top picks underperformed S&P500 for 5 years. OK, great reasons
not to follow top picks.

Then there's crappy reasoning: look, but hated stocks outperformed loved stocks
in 2010, 2009 and underperformed in 2008; they outperformed over five years
(with survivorship bias - although I am not sure why there is survivorship bias
at all - account for all the BKs in the year when you bought them). So you
should not buy loved stocks. And IMHO this reasoning is flawed and shouldn't be
in the article.

It looks like BlackRock Inc. increased their holdings in CNX by 6% from 4.22%
to 10.83%.

They must like the land holdings of BOTH these companies to be buying such
large equity positions.

OTOH BlackRock Inc. is so large that these positions are small when compared to
the size of their total portfolio value. I wonder if they have any information
on another large buyer that wants in on the Marcellus Shale play. There have

Hello Paul Senior, mid November through mid December I read through the basic
details/info on 39 ASX/AIM listed companies that mine for coking coal.

I was searching for producing mid-tier mining companies with the majority of
their sales coming from hard coking coal.

I could not find what I wanted, so I broadened my search parameters, I decided
to except companies that produce at least 50% coking coal, hard, soft,
semi-soft or PCI. The other 50% of sales could come from thermal or iron ore.

I did quite well last year with WTN.T, MCC.AX and did OK with ICO back in 08.

I found that the majority of the mid-tier and smaller coking coal companies are
still development stage companies, completing resources studies / raising money
/ building out delivery infrastructure and so forth. Most of them are looking
at a year or more before getting their first shipment onboard the big boat!
Many of them are looking at two or three years before first shipment. IMO many
of those will be bought out/taken over. It seems difficult to put an accurate
value on most of those companies.

I backed away from some companies/stocks due to location of mines, mostly in
South Africa & Mozambique. Last year I read many news articles about coal
delivery infrastructure related problems, labor problems and political
problems/delays, most of the problems were in South Africa. I followed the news
closely as most of the time it caused supply disruptions.

I started my search with these two links:

http://www.asx.com.au/research/pdf/energy_and_utilities_sector_factsheet.pdf

(searched coking coal / found 111 mining companies)
http://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/search/index

Floods or no floods........I like GNM.ASX and BTU.ASX and will continue to buy
them. I think both these companies did a great job in acquiring brownfield
coking coal assets + using newer modern mining techniques to upgrade & increase
output & reserves + increase safety. From what I understand its very
costly/time consuming to find/develop new quality coking coal deposits,
worldwide.

It appears that you already know about GNM.AX so I'll pass on a bit of info
about BTU.AX.......in case you might want to take a look.

New Zealand based (listed on ASX & in NZ), above ground mines, highest quality
coking coal in the world, it is mainly used/blended with for other coking coals
to improve them, good growth outlook, good delivery infrastructure. They have a
good website with plenty of monthly information/updates.

They are targeting first coking coal shipments starting this November. Some
folks are already lining up to look at off take agreements.

European utility ENLAY isn't working out for me, and its poor price performance

In general, it seems to me that there are better opportunities available in the
market rather than keeping funds in some of these utilities.
For example, I've closed my position today in water utility CWT. CWT is a stock
I've held for a while, and which I've intended to keep for a lot longer. Just
that at p/e 17-20 (forward - trailing) and dividend yield at 3.2%, it seems to
me too expensive now. Even though it's an assured slow grower (revenue), and

Someone sure likes SVU on this board.

As to negatives I see the economy and the competition. I believe SVU has unions
and they will likely clean the carcass rather than make concessions that let
the animal live. That is what the airline and car unions do/did, but unlike
them I think no one would feel the need to keep SVU union jobs going by
government subsidy. Even if they did, it would not benefit SVU shareholders.

I did a cursory check on assets, and it seems they have a lot of value in Plant
and Equipment. Anyone know how much of this is store ownership as opposed to
leasehold improvements? Why this balance sheet entry is worth checking out is
that the depreciation is an earnings deduction but not a cash flow deduction.
Secondly the real property, if substantial, makes SVU a sort of REIT. Dillards
(DDS), Sears, and Macy's own a lot of their buildings, and that forms a sort of
backstop to value. Of course currently CRE is devalued, but it will come up
again sooner or later.

I remember about 10 years before Longs Drug Stores was purchased I saw a
talking head talk about the value of their realty being as much as the stock
was trading for. I never purchased, but kept watching and eventually Longs
(which never did make that much money) was taken over at a good price that I
think was influenced a lot by the value of the real property holdings.

Anyone pencilled out the book value of RE holdings of SVU? And made
adjustments? If the holdings are quite old, as some must be, the adjustment
would be up I think.

Re: Provident Energy Trust (PVX)& Armanino Foods of Distinction Inc. (AMNF.PK)

Added these two to the IRA. Both are new positions in the IRA but I have had
shares for some time in the taxable account. The PVX distribution (now a
Canadian corporation effective 1/4/2011) should not be subject to the Foreign
Tax with holding (U.S. treaty w/ Canada for IRA accounts). Yield is now around
8.7%. Good to hold in then IRA. Short term the company should benefit from any
disruption in Alaskan pipe line. Should also benefit from long term distillates
produced from NG and distributed through their pipeline(s).

AMNF.PK is a grower that pays a 5% dividend. The PE is around 8 even at it's
all time high of $0.80/share today. Earnings are growing at 10% (and maybe more
next year). Company should earn $0.09-$0.10/share in 2011. Company has no debt
and in fact over $500K in cash sitting in CD's used for expansion, dividends
and special opportunities.

My top 10-ish positions in no particular order: NRF-A/B, UVIC, MHR-C, IDCC,
EBIX, GFRE, GILD, COPJF, DRAGF. Changes in top-10: PBEGF dropped out due to
PMGLF spinoff.

New positions: PMGLF, TPCS, CGPI
Positions increased: NXY, L
Positions reduced: IACAF, GEOI, FR-J, HOG
Positions eliminated:

So far I feel like Buffett: unhappy. The market is going up and this is
something that always dampens the mood of a value investor. The number of good
deals is shrinking by day and the remaining ones are not as attractive as in
2009 or 2010. It's a risky time: will the market bubble up to ridiculous
heights or will we have correction like in 2010? If it's the first, I should
hold or buy up, if it's the second - keep cash or sell. So far I am more in the
selling camp just because the sales are easier for me than paying up for buys.
However, I think that it is more likely that market will go up and I risk
underperforming in a broad runup.

I reduced positions in IACAF, GEOI, FR-J, HOG on valuation basis. None of them
are ridiculously overvalued, so perhaps I should have held, but I sold. :/

I bought some PMGLF in addition to shares I got from PBEGF spinout. I should
have read more about PMGLF last year and should have bought more. Now the price
is getting out of buy territory fast.

I managed to add a bit to my NXY position, but it is also leaving the buy land.

I paid up a bit for L and think it's still pretty attractive. Insurance
companies are few of the remaining cheapish sectors mostly because their float
returns on low-yielding bonds suck.

I bought exploratory positions of TPCS and CGPI. TPCS is a microcap discussed
on this thread some time ago. Unfortunately its stock has moved up a lot on
tiny volume, so it's risky to pursue. CGPI is yet another Chinese small cap.
Chinese small caps is another sector that has hugely underperformed recently
due to fraud, improper accounting and management accusations. My feeling is
that someone buying a basket of them could make a good return, unfortunately,
there is no cheap and easy way to buy a basket. I personally hold too few
positions for a good return when this sector returns to favor.

opportunity again. as an example of a lost opportunity for me, I considered
buying RSX the russian etf at that time for $10 but didnt pull the trigger in
time and it shot up from there. I recently purchased it at $38 and its now
flirting with $40. LVS I believe I purchased in the $4s shortly before someone
from the street.com put a sell out on it. I sold it around $13 now its flirting
with $50.

OTOH I think there are lots of specific opportunities out there on an ongoing
basis, which are accessible because of wonderful deep thinkers out there who
share their thoughts on the internet,
so for those of us who capitalized on the past two years these are still the
best of times. In fact I now wish i could diversify my portfolio even more but
cant because i have large gains i dont want to pay taxes on. I decided in those
cases there is no reason for me to sell unless I believe a security is at least
20% overvalued. I continue like hard assets, restructurings, holding companies
trading for a lot less than the value of their assets, and companies with low
ev/ebit multiples. My only exception to that is GOOG, which is a one decision
stock for me.

Hi maverick61 - Not sure but it is probably due to the corporate conversion.
Several of my other company conversions had an effective yield that was lower
than when they operated as an Energy Trust. I think that was one of the
concerns the market had as to what the impact was going to be to their
distribution yield.

For PVX it looks like it dropped from around 9.5% to 7%. However, the analysts
that follow the company, have higher earnings estimates looking forward. I like
their growth potential and the effective yield is still very good too.

These are the Canadian Trusts which did the corporate conversion that I follow.
I own all three.

they gonna do? They can't really load all the debt on the E&P part, since E&P
needs cash flow for exploration. But if they load debt on refining part, the
refining spinoff will drop like a rock - can't have that. Not sure they can
find a good way to make refining part attractive while keeping E&P part in

The future of minority shareholders of PTI is unclear although there is a
tender offer in market for 20.6% of shares. Someone on Yahoo boards claim that
the tender is at $22.35 - and it seems that SEC filling
http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1024732/000119312511005788/dex992.htm

tendered might be accepted, so there's still risk.

The future of the company or its US listing is unclear either. iGate may decide
to keep PTI listing and remove whatever listings iGate had. It is unclear if
iGate will keep business in PTI or try to move contracts to iGate side. In any
case, the future may now also depend on iGate corporate performance, which is
unknown to me.

Re:SVU

Why supermarket stocks are getting squeezed

Supermarket stocks stuck between rising food prices and customers unwilling to
spend

Randall, AP Business Writer, On Sunday January 16, 2011, 3:59 pm EST

NEW YORK (AP) -- Orange juice isn't the only thing at your supermarket that's
been squeezed.

Rising food prices mean grocery store chains must absorb extra costs on items
like meat, seafood, and produce, or they try to pass them along to customers.
But many of those consumers are unemployed or have less money to spend, even on
essentials. For now, the big chains are mostly choosing to absorb. As a result,
profits are falling, and so are their stocks, making them one of the few dim
lights in the market in 2011.

On Tuesday, Supervalu was the first of the grocers to report quarterly results,
and the numbers for its fiscal third quarter were ominous: A loss of $202
million, or 95 cents a share, compared with a profit of $109 million, or 51
cents, in the same period a year earlier. The company, which operates
Albertsons, Jewel-Osco, Acme and other chains, also cut its forecast for the
year.

"This is going to be a challenging year going forward to manage inflation,"
Supervalu CEO Craig Herkert told analysts Tuesday. "It's just a fact and we
believe these inflationary measures are going to impact consumers."

The result: "Investing in (grocers) now is certainly not for the faint of
heart," says Philip Gorham, an analyst at Morningstar.

The pressures supermarkets are dealing with are felt elsewhere, too. Soaring
commodity prices help energy and agriculture companies that produce raw
materials. But there are plenty of losers from the commodity boom stuck trying
to pass on higher costs to customers whose wages are not rising as quickly.
Evidence of that came in the government's inflation report on Friday. The
Consumer Price Index rose 0.5 percent in December, the largest increase in 18
months. Most of that was due to higher gasoline prices. Food prices increased
just 0.1 percent, suggesting grocers still aren't passing along higher costs on
most items.

Forty million Americans now rely on foods stamps, up 50 percent from four years
ago, and the average price of gas now costs 12 percent more than it did at this
time last year. That's one reason why middle and lower income consumers are
increasingly going to supercenters that offer less selection but cheaper prices
than traditional grocery stores. Grocery sales at stores like Walmart, Target,
and Costco grew at a rate of 10 percent a year over the past five years,
according to Packaged Facts, a market research firm. Sales at traditional
grocery stores are growing closer to 4 percent.

For the first time last year Wal-Mart Stores Inc. generated more than half of
its U.S. sales from groceries. The company can offer cheaper produce than a
supermarket because it can use its enormous purchasing power to buy complete
crops of apples in Washington and sell them in the U.S, Japan and South
America, says Bernard Sosnick, a retail analyst at Gilford Securities.

Not every grocer is feeling a pinch from higher commodity costs. Whole Foods
Market, which caters to shoppers who don't mind paying extra for organic
lettuce, isn't as sensitive to the 2 to 3 percent bump in food prices this year
predicted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Whole Foods' stock is up 88
percent in the past 12 months.

"If you are an upscale operator your ability to pass on inflation is much
greater, but the middle-income stores are up against tough competition," says
Karen Short, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets who covers grocery stores. "The
high-end consumer is feeling better, but the middle- and lower-income levels
are feeling much worse."

Traditional grocers already operate with low margins. The squeeze they are
facing now is threatening those already slim margins. In December, Kroger Co.,
the largest grocery chain, lowered its full-year profit forecast. Kroger,
Supervalu Inc. and Safeway Inc. each lagged the Standard and Poor's 500 stock
index over the past six months. Supervalu was trading close to 18 in April.
Now, after falling another 15 percent last week to $7.39, the stock is at its
lowest point in nearly a quarter century.

Supervalu trades at 6.3 times its estimated earnings, about a third of its
five-year high. Kroger and Safeway each trade at around 12 times estimated
earnings, well below their five-year highs. Each offers a dividend yield of
about 2 percent or greater, with Supervalu paying a 4.7 percent yield.

The good news for grocers is that some value investors, who pick stocks they
think are undervalued, are starting to wade in. Some 20 mutual funds added
Supervalu over the past six months, according to FactSet. More than 40 bought
Kroger or Safeway. Of course, nearly three times as many fund managers bought
Whole Foods.

IMHO the author makes good points. LPHI is not a clear fraud, but the
transparency is lacking. Since the valuation is low, the stock will certainly
move a lot either to upside (if no big issues/lawsuits/regulatory rulings
appear) or to downside (if there are issues/investors running away, etc.). I'm
still not sure we can figure out upside/downside chances and ratios to decide

The article may be somewhat interesting.

However, don't paint the shorts as saints that discover and publicize fraud.
Shorts are worse than longs in presenting skewed, one-sided picture of any
company that they short. They lie, they misrepresent information, they blow up
any single issue into elephant size, they harass longs, they yell "fire" in
every forum available to them and push for panic.

I am not saying the Chinese companies are clean. However, I've seen
Waldo/Bird/Mushman/whatever-other-aliases operate on his sites, Seeking Alpha
and Yahoo Boards and the picture is not pretty. While stock pumping presumably
has some rules and limitations, stock dissing apparently is thriving no matter

So I'd say: be careful about Chinese companies, but also be careful about
dumper shorts. I wouldn't trust either without making my own opinion. ;)

I think that the yield is not high enough to justify the risk in a less than
transparent company. Reaching for yield? Although I don't own it, NLY seems
like a decent candidate.

For a 5% yield you can get O, a high quality REIT, tons of quality MLP's,
utilities like FE with a 5.7 yield, and a few banks like BXS. MO has a 1/2
percent less yield, and no one has any doubt about the consistency of their
business or yield.

Looking for yield pre-supposes you are also looking for some level of safety,
and I'm not sure the yield is high enough for the risk.

What I watch for are the secondaries, acquisitions like recently with BMO, and
buy in on the dips, wait until I have made my dividend for the year in capital
gains, and then begin to sell covered calls to enhance the yield. Worst case is
that the stock gets called away and you have a year to buy it back cheaper,
during the inevitable correction that simply must come unless "things are
different this time."

One other area of high tax free yield is the much beaten down muni market.

LPHI,

I looked at this one awhile back. It was a cheap valuation, but I decided not
to buy it. The reason at the time was a management and business model that
appeared to me to be "ethically challenged".

Here a few general points:
If management doesn't run a good, honest business it can always be subject to
legal and regulatory risk. The liabilities of those are hard to ascertain, so
it is hard to say how much "margin of safety" there really is.

If management is willing to cheat their customers, then they are probably
willing to cheat you too. Just something to keep in mind.

I'd rather not support business that I view as unethical. I have amassed enough
wealth (and still find enough opportunities in companies that actually do good)
that I can pretty much avoid companies that I dislike.

This has probably cost me some money recently in that I avoided payday lenders,
whose economics are great, but who I think are bad for their customers. Money
isn't everything, though.

We should be careful always. ;) (Slogan of Communist Party of Soviet Union, BTW

I don't know if I've been burned by "too good" deals more often than "medium
good" deals. Maybe I should make a list and see if I can learn something.

I learned "OCF << earnings is a red flag" and "huge inventories and A/R is a
red flag" from Chinese companies. I knew that dilution is bad and management
overcompensation is bad before Chinese companies, so that's not new lessons.

The big question is how absolute are those lessons. A lot of cheap small caps
have at least some of these warts. This is especially true if you limit your
stock universe by requiring good operational performance (high margins, ROE,
sales growth, etc.) - why would a company with good operational performance
sell for cheap otherwise? So should we discard all stocks that have these

How far do you take this rule?

Are banks - who have been screwing their customers - out?
GS?
Insurance companies - most of them make money by either overcharging their
customers or wiggling out of payouts?
HI - mortuary business based on pushing grieving relatives high cost products?
For-profit-education?
Drug companies that have been accused (and settled more than once with
FDA/regulators) on pushing their drugs through doctor wine&dine and consumer
marketing? (+ possible overcharging for unique drugs; + hiding safety issues )
Traditional Chinese Medicine - placebo/unproven results?
Nutritional supplements - same?
Multi-level marketing schemes?
DELL - sales of defective computers?
INTC - monopolistic destruction of competition?
MSFT - same?
IDCC - patent troll?
Cigarette companies?
Booze companies?
Junk food companies that ruin people's health (yeah, KO & PEP are there)?
Monsanto?
BP?

(I skip political issues like defense contractors).

Just wondering where to draw the line.

Disclosure: I own stocks in pharmas, nutritional/TCM companies, oil companies,
defense contractors, insurance companies, HI, GS, IDCC, some banks, MSFT. I
could buy stocks in for-profit education, DELL, INTC, booze companies, junk
food companies. I don't buy cigarette companies, meat industry, MLM, payday

PTI - it may not be interesting to you, but let's explore this a bit more.

60+% acquisition is done deal. Founders are selling and the private holder is
selling too.

20+% tender offer is active. I assume it was done only to satisfy Indian law
about buying from minority shareholders when you acquire stake from majority
shareholders.

However, this raises a question. Once IGTE has 80+% of PTI what do they do
next? There is no point of maintaining two stock listings, so will they close
one? But then why the heck they are not acquiring 100% of PTI immediately?

There are couple explanations:
- They don't have enough financing to acquire 100%. This may be true and
troubling, since IGTE is smaller and acquiring larger companies is very risky
IMO.
- They want to do some maneuver where they delist IGTE and refloat PTI, so they
don't want to have 100% of PTI which would delist it. This also may be true,
but also is not necessarily great for minority shareholders of PTI. In essence,
at some point you become holder of combined IGTE/PTI, but with possible
dilution/conversion/whatever attached.

I looked at IGTE financial performance. It is weird: the revenue has been
dropping while ROE has been rising for last 10 years. I am not sure I like
that.

So perhaps I should follow you and get out. Or maybe I'll just hold my small
position to see what happens next. :) No intention to buy more though.

Jurgis,

Good question. I don't claim to have a consistent framework for ethical
investing, and to be honest I don't take it very deep. Mainly I try to avoid a
few of my pet peeve areas, where I think the company is trying to cheat and
deceive its customers. Among your list, below are a few I would avoid, or at
least prefer not to invest in.

Payday loans, hi-cost mortuary, patent trolls, multi-level marketing, time
shares, cigarettes, nutritional supplements, and like "natural" herb stuff.

Some areas are greyer than others and for some, I would prefer not to invest,
but that doesn't mean I would completely rule them out.

This is perhaps crazy, but I am not as opposed to cigarette or booze companies
as I am on pay-day loans. Even though the effects are worse, I feel like people
who use booze or cigarettes know by now what they are getting into, as opposed
to clueless people buying time shares or doing payday loans. That being said,
I'd still rather not invest in an area that potentially leads to so many
deaths.

I think that is about all I have to say on the subject, because to be honest I
don't feel qualified to recommend areas to avoid. I think each person should
determine that for himself/herself based on his or her values.

HFBC,

HFBC starting to show some life, I guess on bank M&A? I saw some small insider
selling, so I am selling off a portion of my position as well.

MUNI's - Yes, I have been itching to get in several of them since I believe
that the selling have been overdone. Here is my watch list:

Madharry, I'm still looking to find the shale plays for 2012-2013. Right now
I'm guessing Alberta Bakken and Canadian Cardium and thus the e&p stocks
related.

Reiterating my opinion, for 2010 it's Bakken (USA Bakken), going into 2011 it's
Niobrara with Bakken doing well too. Bakken's getting pretty recognized,
Niobrara following. (If somebody studies Bakken, they eventually come across
Niobrara reports now too.) Niobrara's not much proven -- as companies report
results, Niobrara small e&p oil stocks will rise further. Jmo. Meanwhile Bakken
drilling continues to indicate there's lots of oil (it seems to me), and e&p
oil stocks should - I hope - continue to do well. Decline rates for some of the
wells are quite hyperbolic though, so that's a caution.

I find making the value case for some of these e&p stocks somewhat iffy using
either npv or on acreage controlled per share. Nevertheless, I am adding to
stocks held, and I am actively seeking new candidates.

As I've stated before, I am guessing that e&p companies that are involved in
two or more shale plays might be a better bet for me than single play players.
If drilling in one shale area isn't successful, maybe drilling in another
different shale might be successful for the company, so maybe the failure, even
if it tanks the stock, won't keep the stock from recovering.

Popular stocks on the internet which have two or more areas are SDCJF, SSN,
MHR. And these stocks are doing well, and I hope will continue to do so. I've
no courage to add to positions now.

Stocks that I am adding to now (today) are:

EOG. (Adding just a few shares to a few I hold) EOG first mover with large
positions. A relatively big company with large holdings. Bakken and Niobrara.

Arsenal Energy (AEI.to/AEYIF). In an earlier post I stated I could see somebody
actually getting rich if they bought one or more of these e&p shale companies.
AEI.to could be one, imo.
I intend to accumulate a full position. (Not that I expect to get rich on the
stock -- that might be for somebody else. I don't know enough, or have courage
enough to bet enough.) Arsenal has several things going for it that I like:
1. It's 75% oil/gas
2. It's in N. Dakota Three Forks Bakken
3. It's in a couple of other shales (Central Alberta for light oil)
4. My notes say, "3300 boe/d exit rate '11; 85% oil". This means by my
reckoning, the stock -- if the company meets '11 goals -- is or will be cheap
(undervalued) based on a flowing barrels evaluation.
5. This is a stock to get into before the crowd, if somebody were interested in
that. (I find I am.) Search SI--- there's no discussion of this stock. On the
internet threads that are chockablock full of SDJCF, SSN, DEJ, BEXP, MHR -- I
did not find any discussion/recommendation of Arsenal.

TriOil Resources (TOL.v/TRIAF). Starting a small buy.
1. For its size it has a lot of Alberta Cardium land under its control. "TriOil
has the largest leverage to the Cardium in
terms of net acres versus market capitalization", compared to its competitors,
the company says.
2. My notes show TOL.v production is 45% oil. Like most e&p companies, they'll
be emphasizing oil production now.
3. Additionally, the company has holdings in Sanish/Three Forks Bakken of SE
Saskatchewan. (There's also a gas play and a conventional oil play with TriOil.
These two I ignore.)
http://www.trioilresources.com/en/tol-2010-11-ppt.pdf
4. Again, not a well-publicized stock, as far as I can tell.

Adding shares of other small e&p companies today as well; I've run out of
energy to write these up now though.

Hello Geoffrey,

Here's what I've tried to piece together about SVU's business lines and real
estate from 10-Ks and 10-Q's. If anyone disagrees with anything they see,
please let me know.

As of Fiscal Year End:

Total Stores = 2349
Licensed but Unowned Save-A-Lots = 855
Owned Save-A-Lots = 333
Other Brands (Some owned and some leased) = 1161

Total Square Feet = 65 Million
Owned 38% of the Square Feet = 24.7 Million

As of the end of this quarter, PPE looks to be reported at 6.679 Billion, and
they opened another 41 Save-A-Lots (attempting to open 100 this fiscal year it
seems).

If I look at the 24.7 Million Owned Square Feet + potential other plant &
equipment, I think market value is above book value, but I'm not a real estate
expert and without a precise breakout of stores and locations, it's hard to
really pinpoint this.

From a business standpoint, it looks like the save-a-lots are doing ok from a
sales comp perspective and aren't on the decline anymore. So, they're opening
just these stores going forward. These are over 50% of their stores now, but
the other stores are declining in sales and they have to find a way to stop
this.

This is one of my top ten positions, but I do think it's more on the risky side
than most of my other large postions.

Thanks,

Grant

I really appreciate you sharing your expertise in this area. The more I
invest/speculate the more i realize its pretty much a bet on other people who
seem to know what they are doing, whether it be large companies like GOOG and
IBM or small ones like GFRE or TTT.

as usual i am pretty fully invested. down to accumulating 1% positions or less
now., until i part with something that i own.
a lot of my taxable portfolio i am sitting with healthy gains now. it just
doesnt makes sense to me to sell unless i think its 20% overvalued or i can
offset losses against it. right now the only loser in the portfolio is cown. so
right now i feel like im fighting with one hand behind my back. if i sell
profitable short term positions in the taxable account the tax bite is even
worse.
up to 35%. fortunately the ssn is in a retirement account.

IBM reported decent numbers supporting my long term position in it. I hope it
can produce annual per share gains in the 15% range for several years going
forward and the same for goog and v. One of the fast money guys noted that IBM
is more of a software than hardware company yet its got a multiple like its a
hardware company.

I am trying to decide whether its worth putting money into nly.
those guys seem to know what they are doing but they have also been leveraging
up during a period of declining rates. its hard to figure out whether they will
do ok in a rising rate situation. any thoughts?

Madharry, some comments:

Every time I look at NLY I decide I haven't a clue as to the safety of the
thing. The distribution yield sure attracts everybody though. I'll pass on it
again.

One that I bought and have tucked away and that I do like is IBM. In since '96
with maybe a partial sale and a couple of small adds back, I'm expecting I'll
continue to hold on.

Since the time I've held Bristol Myers in this last go'round (buying 5/'09) I
haven't spent the time to try to understand the company's prospects, and I
don't much know what I have with this company. I've just let the stock languish
in my account only to collect the dividend. Guessing that if haven't taken an
interest in studying this stock by now, I might be able to do better elsewhere
with something else, so I sold my few shares today.

I'm taking a chance by reducing some positions in yield stocks and placing more
money on volatile oil stocks. So I've cut back my position in reit Medical
Properties Trust http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MPW a little today and previously
in some utilities, and I am increasing my positions and weightings in oil
stocks. AZZ/AZZEF.pk and REL.V/RELZF.pk. are two. (REL.v being a penny stock I
like for reasons given in prior post -- a perhaps somewhat undiscovered stock
that's in Bakken --Montana Bakken plus SE Saskatchewan Williston Bakken -- and
to a lesser extent also in central Alberta).
