If 1973-4 valuations are your standard you must have been mostly in cash the
last 20 years. Returns from competitive investments like money market accounts
and T-Bonds count for something, as does inflation. Back in those days we were
having or headed toward double digits on all, I believe. I think 4% on a Money
Market account encourages you to take some risk.

I'm a FFH.TO holder. I think it is an extremely undervalued stock, even after
you discount the "negative amortization" that gooses earnings. The cycle is
right. The turnaround at TIG and Crum and Forster are happening. ORH(Odyssey
Re) recently listed on the NYSE at a premium to book, further enhancing
Fairfax's value. When assets are 5X equity, an improvement in underwriting
results and a meager return on assets leads to a huge ROE. I like it and would

Actually the last few years I have been short the market in various ways. I
really don't like it, but the valuations have argued for it. It's unsettling to
be short and a lot harder to make money than buying at low points. And very
hard to get the benefit of long term capital gains. Nevertheless, I still hold
a very large position in Dow Index LEAP puts, Prudent Bear Fund, and a short
position in QQQ that I put on and off as it fluctuates.

I am also still long on energy in various ways.

My wife's retirement account is completely in inflation-adusted bonds.
Incidentally, the St. Louis Fed's monetary publication just ran an overlay of
Inflation adjusted bond rates against the NASDAQ index. For some reason, it's
an almost perfect predictor of the NASDAQ. The interest rates, after a brief
rise, recently turned down again. We'll see it it coincides.

But, yes, I believe in Benjamin Graham and I have not found much to invest in
for a long time.

If inflation-adjusted BOND rates are a good predictor of NASDAQ, then you ought
to get bullish. Bond rates are higher than at the beginning of April:

http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s= ^TYX&d=t

and inflation rates considerably lower, in my opinion, if you take into account
drops in energy prices, and the impact of lots of layoffs, which are yet to be
seen in the numbers. Furthermore, evidence of things like technology equipment
available at a fraction of list on the secondhand market probably will never
make it into the numbers. I frankly would be surprised if true inflation was
above zero at this time, and suspect that inflation adjusted bond rates are
actually up a lot in the last 6 months.

Allen,

You don't have long to wait for TXCC's 2q2001 earnings.

PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 16, 2001--TranSwitch Corporation
(NASDAQ:TXCC - news) will broadcast its Second Quarter Earnings Announcement on
Wednesday, July 18, 2001 at 5:30 PM Eastern, Vcall, a Service of World Investor
Link, announced today.

This call can be accessed at
http://www.vcall.com/NASApp/VCall/EventPage?ID=75968 or via replay at
1-303-804-1855, ID No. 1107522 beginning at 7:30 PM Eastern. 

Then you can tell once and for all if this UBS analyst is worth listening to.
You may be referring to the June 7, 2001 company press release -- it stated
TXCC may post a .10 - .12 LOSS PER SHARE, I think the revenues of only $10 - 12
mill is a misprint. I could be wrong.

You must remember, I am looking for TXCC to weather the economic storm because
of a strong balance sheet with cash of $564 mill, many recent design wins, and
the proven leadership of Dr. Das. I do not know enough about Juniper Networks
to make a reasonable comparison.

But if I were you I would answer the following regarding Juniper Networks. How
much debt on the balance? How much cash on the balance sheet? What's the yearly
debt service? How many times does EBIT cover the yearly debt service? is
management proven? What are the prospects for Juniper Network's products?

Good Luck,

Well, the chart you pull up shows interest rates trending lower again in the
last two months.

Here's the Fed publication I was referring to. If you enlarge the chart on the
first page, it is quite startling.

http://www.stls.frb.org/docs/publications/mt/mt.pdf

The total return on inflation-adjusted bonds has been 12.48% for the past year
in the TIAA fund--the highest of all the funds:

http://www.tiaa-cref.org/charts/ra-performance.html

The year-to-date is even more impressive in comparison with other assets.

As I think I indicated, the correlation between the yields and the NASDAQ may
be purely concidental.

But I do think that on the whole the NASDAQ is still likely to drop a great
deal. Not many of the stocks are very good values and a great many are terribly
overvalued according to any historically valid way of measuring value.

Adding ZQK to my clothes and shoes collection.

The popularity of their Roxy shoes may already be reflected in the high (imo)
p/e of Quiksilver's (ZQK's) stock price.

I will try an entry point here although I believe that the smart money has
already made its profits.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=zqk+vans+skx&d=t

I've also looked at two somewhat similar companies - SKX and VANS. They're all
similar in that they are California-based fashion-trendy-sporty,
design-oriented. Their target markets seem different -Vans is terrifically
strong in the skateboard arena for example. I lost confidence in stepping into
VANS when it was 10-12. Too bad for me. They had started to build skateboard
parks within Mills outlet malls; VANS stock has subsequently climbed to its
current 21+.

SKX looked near fully valued to me last summer at about 17, so I passed. Oops.
Now the stock has come down from recent 40 to about 26-27. Turns out SFX has
had a wonderful 18-24 month run for anybody who bought early and stayed with
it. Reminds me of Nike or Reebok stock runs (both of which I also missed as
well). Skechers appeals to the style-conscious consumer with their national
print media campaign. With the stock price off its highs and continued
excellent earnings predicted, I'm currently considering again whether I want to
start a position.

Meanwhile I will take some ZQK based on its relative (to these other companies)
p/sales and its product line diversity (shoes, clothes, and from what I can
perceive-- products targeted to a broader age-group.)

Am I coming too late to the party with this hypothesis: People will have their
tax rebate and may use some of it for their kids as we enter the season for
back-to-school clothing purchases?

SBL, starting at $10 a growth stock at a value price.

SBL has been crushed. My basic view is that the company can and will make a
buck in a recovery and, as the leader in its industry with a solid balance
sheet, will sell at 20+ times earnings at that time. In my opinion, it is a
simple case of backing up the price to get the return you want over a 2-3 year
holding period (or less) - and then buying at several price points.

For me that is around $10 for a starting buy point. If it never gets there,
that's life.

Gary J. Goetz. With PHSY it seems there are up days and there are down days.

I looked at XOXO again. From its low price and from the high levels from which
it's fallen, I'd guess the stock is one of those that doubles or triples or
more... or else the company goes bankrupt. It's the determination of the
probability of either event that's the hard part -g-.

On the one hand, they've got plenty of cash. OTOH, they are losing lots of
money. In that sense, they're similar to many other companies these days.
However, as you note... there is ton of heavy insider buying recently at higher
levels than the current price. I'd say at today's $1.54-$1.68, XOXO offers
speculators a decent shot that there'd be some bounce in the stock price. (But
if I weren't one to bet with the insiders, then from a value perspective, it's
too difficult for me to understand the company/industry to determine the long
term viability of the company.)

Dale, Sorry this is so tardy. Just going over old posts and saw yours regarding
CCK. I do not have any special source for assessing the asbestos risk other
than the 10K. Obviously, CCK does not have the exposure that a USG has since
they never made asbestos and only owned a sub for a brief time that had once
made it. At the same time as other Cos go bankrupt CCKs exposure increases.
Total liability is certainly an unknowable for me still. I know from reading

Speaking of insurance-related stocks, I'd like to share some info on a
wonderful company: RNR, RenaissanceRe, a global re-insurer that I've been
investing in for about 4 years now. The price is now around $70 - may no longer
be the complete steal it was in early 2000, but still solid value in my
opinion, and an especially good counterweight to my normally tech-heavy
portfolio. Here's an excellent summary lifted from S&P Ratings below.

Cheers,
Kevyn

====
1. Very strong operating performance. RNR has extremely strong operating
performance, with an ROR and an ROE in 2000 of 41% and 20%, respectively. RNR's
five-year average ROR is 45% despite the industry-wide catastrophe loss
activity in that period. RNR's operating performance exceeds those of its
specialist peer group and the reinsurance industry in general.

2. Strong business position. Although most of RNR's insurance liabilities are
associated with property catastrophe exposures, it has broadened its business
position from strictly property catastrophe risk bearing.
Based on its competitive advantage in catastrophe modeling, it outsources its
expertise in a variety of ways, including establishing a fee-income
managed-catastrophe-risk business that allows it to write risk on the capital
base of third parties.

3. Conservative reserving. RNR has historically been well reserved despite the
short-tailed nature of its liabilities.

4. Potential volatility in operating results. As a property catastrophe writer,
RNR bears considerable exposure to high-severity catastrophe events and
therefore is subject to volatility in its operating results. This risk has been
mitigated in recent years by its very strong catastrophe modeling skills but
remains a key rating factor.

5. Active capital management. RNR has remained independent, is publicly traded,
and has a smaller capital base than some of its competitors. It has
opportunistically repurchased shares as its resources allow and when its share
price dips.

Allen,

Your UBS analyst listened to the June 7, 2001 guidance correctly. TXCC last
quarter's 1q2001 revenues were a shade over $11 mill. The loss was $15 mill.
This company is losing money, yet is continues to have enough of a cash hoard
to pay the annual interest on its bonds and pay off its bonds in 2005. Note:
long term debt has shrank to $377 from $460 mill, so the company is buying back
its debt in the open market at 30% less than face value.

Thanks for the helpful comments on TXCC and I hope we can correspond in the
future. If you want any help investigating JNPR let me know.

Good luck,

timba, for what it is worth I strongly dislike CATS.

In my opinion, it is a small commodity chip producer, that spends far less than
peers on R&D as a percent of sales (the lifeblood of such a company), with
major, recent insider selling at the current price level. I suspect earnings
have largely evaporated at this point, and much of cash flow as well. If I am
going to invest in a commodity producer, in any industry, I want the biggest
and strongest, not a small, weak one.

Three stocks I am watching but don't own are MONI, SBL and SFA. Any informed
views are welcome.

jeffrey bash: SFA - Looking to answer the question: Is this a buy? [No
position] I came upon this in 7/20 Merrill report excerpt: <<VALUATION: Does
the present share price already reflect near-term growth concerns? As we have
highlighted in our initiation report on SFA, our revised DCF value is $27. We
do not take this theoretical value as a magic number, however, we do believe
the poor growth outlook dictates a more cautious approach. We have downgraded
our FY2002 model to fit the current environment, and expect the Company to
report an EPS of $1.39, vs. our previous estimate of $1.90.
In the mid to upper $20s, SFA trades at a 2002 P/E of 20x, with an almost 18%
EPS decline expected in 2002 and almost zero, on average EPS growth, expected
in the next four years [OUCH!].
We therefore maintain our Neutral rating and expect no positive momentum in the
share price until the Company proves it can rejuvenate growth with new
contracts or applications.>>
It would appear this is no great bargain at current levels.

re:CATS....your opinion may prove to be the correct one, only time will tell. I
do not put much credence in the activity of insiders, although I know that a
lot of folks do. I don't know how much ownership interest that leaves the
insiders still holding after the sales. By my following the lead of the
insiders, I am in effect, saying that they are better at making the investment
decisions than I am. Not knowing them, I'm not prepared to make that assumption
carte blanche.

CATS has low to no debt, working capital of $1.68, ROA of 44.6%, and Operating
margins of 34.1%. While they state in the 10Q that these margins are declining
due to lower demand and over-capacity leading to more competition for a smaller
piece of the pie, they still seem to be in pretty good shape none-the-less.

Admittedly, there is more element of speculation than a true NetNet play, but I
believe they provide some margin of safety at current pricing.

Differing opinions is what makes the market!

maybe 3x book value (which is $13.6/sh although not growing apparently).
Company has plenty of cash and opportunities to weather an economic downturn.

Hi, Paul -
Have held TMO for what seems like an eternity, and am still way underwater.
Can't give you too much help (other than it's oversold on a technical basis),
it just sits there. We'll know when they report, momentarily.
FWIW sold SLB too early at 54.25, didn't enter MCD, but have built a position
in DIS, at this price looks like a good entry point.
Like your ABN idea, but info on it is hard to come by. Are they getting hit due
to Argentinian exposure? Seems like there may be a lot of exposure to S.
America there.
Am considering MER, which is still the biggest and baddest in the industry,
despite problems, either perceived or real.
My God, I've owned CMO for years in accounts I control, not only is it back
from the dead, it's smoking! Check out the latest div. ($1.50/Q), this thing
sports an annualized yield of about 20%! There is a good chance that div. will
be nominally higher next Q IMHO, of course it will decline when the Fed starts
to tighten. But, I've talked to people who think that CMO will be able to
maintain at least $2 a share annual div. in lean times. At $25, that's still an
8% yield, which isn't far off what yield it traded at in the early/mid 90s.
Quite a turnaround story.

After your post, Wallace, I looked at the stocks you mentioned.

I'll pass on DIS. On the plus side, the stock is at lows, and it's always
recovered.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DIS&d=c&t=5y&l=on&z=b&q=l

DIS was a pick of Mike Burry and/or Jim Clarke at these low levels at least
once before (if I recall correctly, and I'm not sure I am), and it worked out
soon and favorably, also if I recall. Warren Buffett had dinner with Michael
Eisner and there were rumors that Mr. Buffett was interested in purchasing
Disney. That was somewhere last year (?) when DIS stock was trading about where
it is now (?). (I'm not sure about this.) I see DIS as a co. that given enough
time, will have new films or tv programs that will bring it (the stock) back
into favor, and the stock will trade closer to its highs. OTOH...
I stopped at the library this afternoon to look at Value Line's DIS history.
Return of equity is steadily declining. And return on assets stinks over the
past five years. I don't like what you pay for what you get, i.e. very high
p/e. Book value is growing slowly, imo. (P/sales and p/book are low compared to
past years though - a good sign) There could very well be a reason the stock is
down and going lower. I'll pass for now (as I also wrongly did when Mike/Jim
bought). If I read that Mr. Buffett is, or has, bought, then I'll reconsider
the value of DIS's franchise and moat.

MER might also work here. Difficult for me to figure. Have also to absent
myself from my feelings about Mother Merrill - MER reminds me of the cartoon
where one exec. says to another, "Our target market? We like the segment where
you fool some of the people all of the time." -gg-
Company has very good revenue growth. Stock could turn around if market turns.
MER just manages so much money: by taking a haircut on a large number of
dollars they wind up with a large number of dollars. (I am expecting this of
Mellon - MEL - also.)
Very high roe numbers. And, as is typical here, high d/e.
I just can't make up my mind about MER now. Arrgh!!!!
Ergo, I'll wait and reconsider when/if MER gets closer to its annual low.

No opinion on SLB as a sell. I exited early and missed a lot of the big run up.
I'm a buyer again in low 40's and below, if it gets there.

I'll look at CMO. (Congratulations!! Patience rewarded.)

re: ABN: yes, believe that some of the problem is with Argentina, from which
ABN is trying to extricate itself. Also, maybe adjacent Brazil is a problem as
well. Company prides itself on a world-wide reach, so I am expecting (hoping)
that any regional issues are eventually overcome by having that diversity.

right now both are bearish. also from your chart there is a few month (roughly
2 - 7 mo) lag between bottom on insider buying vs bottom on market....therefore
i think we may see significant buying opps with year end tax loss selling.

the wild card is tax rebate - i read that lower rebate in the 70s was catalyst
that boosted economy and market.

my ideal buying situation is heavy insider buying on fallen angel when overall
insider buying is bullish - this often occurs during big market downturn at the

Regarding tax loss selling....some personal thoughts:

I think it is too early to tell. If there is a significant rally between now
and the end of the year, then some tax loss selling might occur, which might
only represent the normal retrenchment after a strong run and that would
present a buying opportunity.

However, if the market trends sideways into the end of the year, I'm not sure
there have been enough profits made elsewhere to necessitate tax loss selling.
Additionally, there may be an overhang of tax loss carry-overs from last year
that could be used to mediate some of the current years need. Of course, those
who made large profits from shorting the market might be the big players that
need to protect some of their gains by taking losses to offset....but would
they be buying or selling for the tax loss?

Insider selling might currently be being done to get the gain from low-priced
option exercise prices protected by losses incurred in other investments.

Gary J. Goetz: I have no earnings estimates on PHSY.

They've got 3.7M enrollees. I don't see why they can't net $10 or maybe $12 in

$1/month per enrollee. Seems little enough. With about 34M sh. outstanding,
that would make eps $1.09 to $1.30. It 'ought' to be do-able if PHSY can get
itself organized properly. But apparently it is not, and they cannot.

Tax loss selling will exacerbate oversold conditions in some beaten up stocks.
It will create bargains, but also psueudo-bargain traps that look cheap but
will only get cheaper as their underlying businesses continue to deteriorate.
Either type may experience a substantial bounce in Jan, but the latter will
roll over and continue to swoon. Last years taxloss season was very fruitful,
so I'd expect more competition for attractive positions. Many business models

Forget about drinking that "water" of Wallace's, guys. I'll buy everybody a

------------------------------
I hadn't noticed RKY or RKY's drop. Funny you should mention a beer stock just
now, Wallace. Near market close today I decided to start an exploratory
position in Japan's Kirin (KNBWY). KNBWY also is near an annual low. There are
several aspects of Kirin that I like:
They are innovative.
They distribute beverages in Japan other than their own. (e.g. Budweiser)
They are multinational.
They appear to very environmentally conscious in their operations.
They have a pharmaceutical business and are hooked up with Amgen.
They maybe/possibly/I dunno - provide some diversification from the US Market.
Beer maybe/I am guessing/I dunno - is a business that might do okay in a punk
economy that we're in.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KNBWY&d=c&k=c1&c=rky&a=v&p=s&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l

Sure looks like RKY could be the better bet. Price has been on a nice rise over
the past few years. (I shouldn'ta sold out years and years ago at 16.) Revenue
on a nice uptrend. Debt low. Earnings growing (but not increasing every year),
and there are dividend increases every year. Mgmt isn't afraid to try new
things related to their business - as with their CRTK spin off, for example.

My bet on KNBWY is that at some point the stock will trade again closer to its
highs than its lows. It's got the beer business, and the negative that comes
with Japanese accounting and being within the interlocking Japanese business
community. Yet there is a kicker -- if they can click with their pharmaceutical
endeavors.

I'll have to consider RKY further.
Maybe over a cold brew this weekend.

Thanks for the idea, Wallace.

Regarding insurance stocks, I am still wondering about FFH.to. I mention it now

they are opposites in stock price too - under $4 vs. over $220. -g-) FFH.to
seems to me too expensive based on p/e and current roe. (This year might be an
anomaly: they say they are very strongly ROE driven.) They are pretty
aggressive, imo, in acquisitions and in growing their business. I like reading
the CEO's straight forward, informative and educational report to stockholders
-- not that his comforting words though mean the stock is a good or safe
investment.

I can't seem to get the right view or consistency on these big insurance
companies. On the one hand, I can't figure Berkshire, and it always looks too
expensive to me. On the other hand, I can't figure AIG or MKL either, but yet I
am willing to hold my very small positions in these two.

Valueman, one prime reason I am holding MKL - and why I might buy FFH.to too -
is a reason you stated for liking FFH: "When assets are 5X equity, an
improvement in underwriting results and a meager return on assets leads to a
huge ROE."

From:Paul Senior
OT. No, never spent time in Japan. In a previous life I did lots of work with
Japanese manufacturing techniques applied to US companies, and I've worked a
little with Japanese businessmen and consultants who came to the USA. Way
before that I had studied a little Japanese in college - soon gave it up though
because I was also studying Chinese language then and started getting confused
in class between the two languages. Now I'm having enough trouble just with
English.

Only contact now is I eat Japanese food (and drink!)- I'm a big noodle man -g-,
attend a few local Japanese cultural events (Nisei Week coming up!), and I like
to read stories about the guys in the 442 (Regimental Combat Team).

From what I understand - and I may be very wrong here - because there are
interlocking relationships all over the place in Japan, it's not likely for
example, that a Sony man would ever consider drinking a Sapporo (if his company
were tied to Kirin). And a Toyota guy would never be seen drinking a Kirin brew
if his company were aligned with Asahi, for example.

Don't know where my alignment is, but I'm considering adding to my small
position in SANNY. Sanyo is way too diversified imo, but worse, still sells at
a very high price (imo)even though the stock is hitting a new annual low. They
are very good in manufacturing (digital cameras, for example), and I very much
like their dominance in cell phone and digital camera batteries. With this
company, as in many traditional Japanese companies, the culture has been (maybe
it is not now) that the purpose of the company is not bottom line profits for
investors or high stock price for investors. The purpose is to provide
products/services to society and especially to provide employment within the
Japanese societal framework.
(That's my opinion anyway - am I near correct?)

Allen, what is your relationship to Japan, Japanese, Kirin, (and/or giraffes

I dunno. Sounds like something Hans Christian Anderson decided NOT to publish.

My daughter has given me some things I liked better, like a John Coltrane CD.

OT: I liked it, Madharry. Thanks for sharing. Had you seen this one:

Remember the five simple rules to be happy:
1. Free your heart from hatred.
2. Free your mind from worries.
3. Live simply.
4. Give more.
5. Expect less

-----------------------------
Maybe #6 is: buy a lot of a stock that goes up. -g-

Madharry (aside: or anyone else here), I believe you've been interested in
broadband related stocks. Have you checked MTP, and if so, do you have an
opinion on it you can share? Apparently it will be debt free after it completes
'non-core' sales; it sells below stated book value; and maybe it has a real
business. I'm considering it.

Paul..I was going to tell you to be careful with MTP because I knew they had a
bad power contract. They have solved this issue.

They are still active in laying conduit and fiber optic cable. I recently saw
them at work south of Reno.

Good Luck.

The future business of MTP, TouchAmerica, is neatly outlined in a separate 2000
annual report that illustrates the profitability of their communications
business.

Paul, what you describe certainly was true when I was in Yokosuka 44 years ago.
At that time, of the 10,000 Japanese employees at the U.S. Naval base only one
had an automobile. When the salesman came in to show off the Nisan Bluebird to
the Naval personnel it looked liked it was assembled by a committee.(never
bought one because my money went into furniture). They have "come a long way
baby." I married Sachiko, a girl from Kyushu Island, and our oldest daughter is
now 41. In fact my wife is visiting her in Toluca Lake CA as I type. I hope you
saw the excellent PBS documentary on the Nisei troops.
On to investment. I do not follow Japanese companies but have MLN on my watch
list. If it reaches 8.2 I will buy. This is a Merrill Lynch senior security
which is guaranteed to give you 10 dollars in Sept 2005. If the Nikkei is above
14,153 by that time you will get an amount equal to 10*((Ending
value-14,153)/14153) May be a little early to consider now but worth while
watching.
Best regards.

Thanks for the MTP report, Sahara. Helps in my decision-making. I'll take the
risk that if MTP's earnings announcement tomorrow has a negative effect on the
stock, that it'll only be a temporary drop and won't crater the stock.

I'm buying a little MTP @ under $10/sh. today.

fwiw, buying WWF here. Too low a price for too good a franchise.

Maybe.

Paul S., who,
has been drop-kicked many, many times by these
entertainment company stocks.

Also considering Sony. It's a dynamo. Price is down, but still looks very high
to me. Any one here with an opinion on SNE to share?

The way I figure it, if you could buy MLN at 8, to hold it for four years you
would need to get about 50% appreciation to make it a good speculation. So it
would have to be worth $12. But to be worth $12, the Nikkei would have to be at
about 17,000. or more than 40% above its current level.

I guess the upside is that you cannot lose in nominal dollars, but in the event
of a dollar decline or renewed inflation, you would lose, having received only
a 25% gain, or about 5% compounded, for four years.

That's a long holding period for very little gain, too.

I am holding a pretty good sized position in Merrill Lynch euro warrants. When
I look at MLN it makes me uneasy to be trying to bet against Merrill Lynch.

Those are good rules. Don't follow MTP but looks interesting- I purchased more
AETH in the AM and am taking a slight loss. the loss might become greater after
they report however the ceo has repurchased around one million shares over the
past 3 months. that is a pretty strong vote of confidence by someone who should
be in the know . the company has lots of cash relative to its burn rate. I also
purchased more MFNX yesterday morning at almost the low- i did not throw too
much money in it- i mean it was selling at .50 but i believe that given the
wealth of verizon and kluge that they will negotiate something that will
support a renewal of a $300MM credit line. this could certainly be a 30 bagger
over time. and if they go BK and the equity is lost. I was wrong and it will
not hurt too badly. I continue to hold shares in mrvc and ldp at these
depressed levels.

I'll add a little more to FAF on its good news. And start a position in KLM on
its bad news.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=faf+klm&d=t&k=c1&t=my&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

Should be room for profit continuance with FAF. Now if investors haven't
already anticipated all that and already priced it into the stock, then the
stock might move up as good earnings reports (I hope) continue.

Airline stocks from what I'm looking at, are all suffering.
Lots of problems at KLM. Still KLM dominate Schiphol in Amersterdam, and they
seem to have enough financial and managerial resources to muddle through. I say
the stock will recover. 'Course I've been saying that with the other airline
stocks I hold, and they haven't. (recovered)

About patience: For some reason I just do not seem to have patience to
comfortably hold downtrodden stocks in certain areas. That'd be consulting
companies or some areas of tech like telecom. OTOH, there are some areas I seem
comfortable with. Like airline stocks. I'll guess there's nobody (including me)
who considers airline stocks good long term investments (Southwest being the
possible exception stock). Rightly or wrongly though, I seem to be okay so far
holding on for what I assume will be an inevitable upturn. Perhaps that's
wrongly tying up funds; on the other hand, airline stocks are very low, and
sometimes it's better to be in stocks that go nowhere than to have stocks that
are bought which subsequently drop significantly.

jmo.

Paul.

I added more MTP calls on the dip today - this is the last of the old

MTP now going forward.

Here's a stock that might fit your style (as I guess it):

ALR. Good earnings report. Management provides favorable outlook. Price moving
up near a high. Low p/e. Under stated book. P/sales seems ok. A microcap (I
notice small size doesn't automatically scare you off) that gets mentioned here
every year or so.

MTP: Just read Merrill rpt on this - Dropping '01 to .01, '02 to .42, rating to
Neutral, Says value compares unfavorabley to RBOC's and LVLT [Price shown
7.96]. The change has been known for a long time so I suspect today's action is
more a reflection of tectonic shift in expectations by folks who planned to
hold, rather than final bailing by folks that liked it as an electric utility.

You know how the song goes....downgrade at the bottom, then upgrade as it comes
back so you can raise your price targets.

By January they will be looking ahead to renewed growth in mid-2002.

I have an order in to buy more calls at a buck if they drop them that low. Then
I just tuck 'em away for five months.

Doubled up on NFI now that that pullback seems to be stabilizing - one of the
safest value stocks out there.
