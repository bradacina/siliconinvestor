Brendan, I'm looking at them for short to intermediate term so the exchange
wouldn't be a major issue. I don't think they pay interest on cash balances -
common among futures brokers, which is where they came from. Speaking of which,
they offer good commissions but very limited offering in futures, but must be
separate account.
I'm a bit concerned, given the low commissions, that they have other ways of
milking order flow or that they might croak as trading slows in bear.

re: interactive brokers. 
I don't believe order flow is an issue... I think they let you route wherever
you want. What I don't know and I would worry about is customer service and the
quality of information and statements they provide. In other words, what
happens when you don't understand something or something doesn't go to form.
Also, the other back office functions... are they ruthless with margin calls,
do they process your merger instructions properly, how hard is it to
certificate, do they return your calls, etc. This is what I refer to when I
call Brown "professional". It costs next to nothing to electronically execute
and clear a trade. As an alternate broker I think they are worth a try.

Article on tech net-nets in September Smartmoney.
The link I provide does not provide the chart the author provides in the
magazine with columns on discount-to-cash, p/b, psr, cash burn, cash cushion.
Be aware his data precedes the most recently reported quarters for most of the
companies. His chart has three companies selling at 37 percent discount to cash
or better.

I didn't find anything particularly compelling. I've been burned by VCLK and
may revisit it. But I am more reluctant on small caps than others here. It
could get more interesting after they report the third quarter if tax selling

Yes, that is about right - so VIAN would run out of cash in four years at
current burn rates and current business conditions.

With $3 per share in cash, I could understand VIAN trading at $2, but not close
to $1. Discounting two full years of cash burn in the middle of a tech
recession seems excessive, given the odds of either a buyout by a bigger
consulting firm or a plain old business rebound in 2002.

VIAN is less than 15 of my portfolio, strictly a "what if" bet based on their
cash hoard. But the image that comes to mind is a modest, homely little waif
with $100 bills hanging out of every pocket.

TALR is another one at a big discount to cash, which I looked at in detail when
it was even lower without getting excited. The problem with most of these
companies is that they raised cash at the market peak, but never had a business
model that turned into anything. The first question one should ask is whether
you think the company would be better off selling out or closing the doors now
and liquidating. If the answer is "probably", you can assume that is not the
company's plan and should not invest.

software market and 41% of the firewall software market, according to Gartner
Dataquest. For the six months ended 6/30/01, revenues rose 70% to $287.1
million. Net income totaled $170.5 million, up from $78.6 million. CHKP has had
a consecutive four quarters of positive earnings surprises. We estimate CHKP
will earn $1.29 per share this year on $630 million in revenue, and $1.69 per
share next year. Projecting an average annual growth rate of CHKP at 30%, we
estimate CHKP's PEG ratio to be .87x versus the industry's 1.99x.

Decreasing my equity weighting.

The amount of money involved is inconsequential but I think it's symbolically

funds rate from 6-ish to 3-ish. However:
o I am finding few investment opportunities,
o I have positions that are highly valued,
o other investors are reporting difficulty finding investment opportunities
(e.g., Ruane of Sequoia)
o Standard and Poors recently reported that if you normalize the S&P 500 eps to
historical standards by adding back purportedly one-time charges that the S&P
is at a record valuation (PE > 28 on eps of $40)

Not a bad plan to raise cash in names you no longer have confidence in, IMO.
Tax loss selling should offer some good bargains over the next 4 months and
there's a good chance a loser will drop further as people sell to capture
losses. Better to be an early seller than a later one.
I'm not finding a lot of what I consider lay-up investment buys, either and
would agree that the S&P is probably still over valued based on adjusted
earnings even with lower discount rates.
That said, I agree with Jeff Bash that PE can be a flawed guide to value when
earnings are under pressure. Nearly every business has cyclicality, and high PE
on busted earnings is often indication the market has discounted the worst of
the cycle.

Twenty percent of the S&P 500 have current year PEs greater than 30. Many of
these are large, not cyclical, and haven't provided much recent growth.
Examples: Gillette, Coke, Disney, Robert Half, Wrigley, Costco, Walmart, Harley
Davidson, Bausch and Lomb, Home Depot, Allergan, Starbucks, Hasbro, Quintiles,
JC Penney.

I always feel like a fool making a "call" on the market. I tend to believe it's
not callable. This is based on greed, not fear... I'm within 1% of a new high.
It's perplexing because there has been so much carnage and still so few
bargains. I don't see any earnings bounce on the horizon (not that you usually
can). It is tempting to believe more bargains may be ahead.

I am buying Owens Illinois (ticker: OI). At $5.50, it's trading at 4.5x 12/2001
$1.20 and 3.8x 12/2002 $1.44. They are the global leader in glass containers
and that's based I think both on technology and market share. They are a large
player in plastic containers.

The two knocks against OI are asbestos and the degree of financial leverage. I
think the market is discounting the asbestos primarily. The way management
discusses their exposure is comforting: the average claim size is $10,000; The
average claimant is in their 70s; They got out of the asbestos related business
in 1950 sharply limiting the ability of trial lawyers to find clients;
insurance has covered the bulk of their exposure to date; and the expense has
begun to decline. I think the market may soon recognize that the asbestos
exposure is receding for OI.

OI has more than $5 billion in debt and that is uncomfortable enough that
management is not buying back its preferred (currently yielding almost 16%).
Last fall the preferred bottomed at over 40% yield. The company is proceeding
with acquisitions because many global competitors are stressed and looking to
exit.

Here's a writeup by Standard & Poors which has their credit rated 'B+'. Moody's
has them rated a knotch lower.
http://www.standardandpoors.com/RatingsActions/RatingsNews/CorporateFinance/Art
cles/042701_owens.htm

I think the financial leverage is adequately discounted by its valuation. Also,
I think this company can grow. Third world consumption of containers will
continue to grow and OI is as well positioned as anyone.

The company has not put through energy and materials price increases. They plan
to do this in January, and they act like they will have the pricing power. We
will see.

Not only do the normal caveats apply (I've closing in on 100 companies I've
been wrong on)... but I've been wrong several times on OI. I bought at $25,
$11, $3, $7.50 and $5.50.

<<not cyclical>>I've come to beleive that virtually all businesses have some
cyclicality and/or lifecycle exposure [cyclicality is often the lifecycle of a
product category or generation], though not necessarily in the traditional
sense as direct exposure to the economic cycle and not in the sense of the
chartists that beleive there are regular repeatable cycles that can be located
and and forecasted. The cyclicality I'm referring to more business/industry
specific, is irregular and could be tied to a number of variable including
fashion/fads [Hasbro's earnings surged on Pokemon and sagged on the fade],
store concept buildouts [No more good places to go, HD]. The reason many of
these 'non-cyclical' companies have seen growth flatten is that their good
returns attracted competitors as their main product reached near saturation.
This is a common theme in the cyclicality of many industries: attractive
opportunities bring competitors and excess capital spending that competes away
the profit by oversaturating the market. This article captures some of what I'm

this would be a trade of 1 or 2 months, not a long term position. Several of

Power’s P/E of 44.0x for 2002E and 31.5x for 2003E are unattractive for

MAIR -- The WSJ had a feature on airlines a week or two ago. The essense of it,
as I recall, was that consumers are getting more frugal and have more
information now on air fares, than ever before.

Air fares are easier to compare and pricing in now in less control of the
airlines. They quoted a few CFOs of this airline or that, and they mentioned
how the business traveller markup is remarkably lower. (That's remarkable as
in, incredible, unprecedented and financially painful. That's the bread and
butter, BTW.) Biz travellers shop around now. If you raise your price, they go
elsewhere.

That scared me away from MAIR and any airline for now.

David: FIT. Arrgh. A hard selling decision. I try to buy 'em undervalued and
hold 'em until fair value is reached. And my opinion is that this stock's fair
value ought to be at least at or above the net-net figure - 18.5, which is
higher than today's 14.8-14.9 selling price. So I figure I "should" hold the
stock for another year or so to see if it can get there. OTOH, as you point
out, the company's future is iffy (as one expects with net-nets), and there
would seem to be better opportunities elsewhere - especially as the market is
in a downdraft now. Plus, if we sell we'll lock in our roughly 50% gain (imo,
the Graham net-net bogey). (I'm in since 12/14/99 at 10 1/8.)

Given the market in the past few trading days, my greed/fear outlook has moved
to the fear side. I can rationalize a sell by telling myself I'm freeing up
cash for what I want to believe are even better bargains.
This is usually a mistake, but emotions rule.

So, in spite of my opinion that this stock is still undervalued, I will now try
to sell (around 14.90) and move on.

Do you know the story behind the DCDC shares? They tried to buy LPAC last year
for $4/share by accumulating a large chunk of LPAC shares. LPAC later passed a
poison pill provision, so DCDC gave up.

Then, in what I consider a very wise move, LPAC negotiated the repurchase of
825,200 DCDC-owned shares UNDER the market price at the time.

So LPAC cut the shares OS by more than 10% and eliminated a dangerous overhang
in outstanding stock.

This "insider selling" was actually a share buyback by management.

Yes, I've been watching SPOR.

The most current financials that I was able to find are dated March 31, 2001
showing current assets totaling $25,319,000 ($6,178,000 cash, $1,473,000
marketable securities, $5,334,000 accounts receivable, $ 10,430,000 inventory)

The company carries debt of only $ 1,351,000.

Market cap as of today is $6,987,000 or 27% of net current assets

I guess the discount to assets depends on how well the company accounts for
receivables and inventory.

The business is shrinking, sales and income are down. Recently the company
closed its B&L Sportswearmanufacturing facility.

Its disturbing that no recent financials were published, especially after the
company was kicked off NASDQ for failing to timely report.

Did you see the web site? Its still under development
http://www.sporthaley.com/

I continue holding. I suppose if the stock price is really crushed I might
"double down". It seems there is value there --somewhere.

I visited a store over the past weekend in New Jersey. Nothing to get too
excited about. But its another retailer trading at a steep discount to net
current assets. The business seems to be holding its own even in this economic
downturn.

The company seems to have generated significant cash flow from operations in
the past (albiet inconsistent).

SPOR sports a $7.54 BOOK VALUE, $6.96 NCA & $2.22 per share in cash &
marketable securites at 3/31. All this for $2.03
(Actually 2500 offered in aftermarket trading at $2.00).
They are awaiting year end figures is why its been so long since the last
reporting. And they will lose some on the closing of that facility.
Also have the SEC investigation to deal with along with what I consider
management incompetence.

As for RAGS, I have owned & traded it for years. Boring stock. Insiders couldnt
care less about shareholders or shareholder value.

Earnings flucuate but are never a decent return on equity or assets. New 37
year old president. Chairman is like 76. But family is also involved so his
passing probably wont be a cataylst.

Its cheap...but its ALWAYS been cheap.

Both companies should be sold. SPOR was in talks years ago. Sure wish they

My point was that insider buying should not be touted when the prices of such
buys were significantly below the current share price. I mean, the stocks
tripled from their buying. At some point, old,lower priced insider buying
becomes insignificant at least in my mind anyway.

We are getting close, RJM. I see more and more small caps with "Get me out of

The good news is that kind of panic selling tends to exhaust itself in a matter
of weeks or even days, forming the bottom that the pros buy so they can sell to
the retail suckers on the way up again.

Today on the Yahoo LPAC thread I guy said he sold in disgust after buying over
5 and watching LPAC retrace back to low 4's. Called LPAC "a dog" despite all
the the great fundies, because it had gone down with the market.

I told him he would be even madder when LPAC went to 6 without him.

KLM, others:

I like KLM's dominant position in Schiphol Airport. I am betting that this
airline is important to Dutch business and that the Dutch government will not
idly watch KLM's demise.

KLM's revenues haven't been growing. But in past good years it's earned $4-$5
dollars per share. I will bet those good years might return if:
Business travel, cut by a world-wide recession, picks up.
Business travel, permanently reduced by video-conferencing, is offset by KLM
(and other airlines') emphasis on tourist travel and on shipping (cargo).

KLM has plenty of people, cash (!), planes, offices, routes etc. to be able to
figure out a way to adapt to current realities and re-allocate capital. That's
imo. (I claim no expertise though, although I've followed the stock for 5-6
years.)

Here's how KLM long term debt/eq compares to some other airline stocks I'm
following (figures per Yahoo):

KLM: 1.88
ALK: 0.83
AMR: 1.15
BAB: 3.19
DAL: 1.36
MAIR: 0.00 (Mike Burry pick)
UAL: 1.59

KLM is approaching 12 year lows:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KLM&d=c&k=c1&a=v&p=s&t=my&l=on&z=m&q=l

I say the stock price is too low. But it keeps getting lower every day. That is
scary. Still, I'm playing catch-the-falling knife here. Missed getting more at
my price on Friday and missed my lowered price today.

(I like to be diversified among airline stocks too, and I am holding on to
positions in other beat down airline stocks and looking for better times for
them all in 2002.)

--------

I wrongly dismissed BA when it was discussed here in low 30's:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BA&d=c&t=5y&l=on&z=b&q=l

To me, although the stock has come down, it's still too pricey now. Maybe on
watch list though looking for a 10% further drop might be do-able.

I wrongly believed TBL was too expensive when Mike Burry (and Jim Clarke? et.
al.) began buying it here at lower prices. I've no opinion on TBL now, but I am
holding on to my MAXS and SCNYB shares. I'm also holding on to clothiers such
as PERY and ZQK (although ZQK dropped sharply - oops - after an earnings
warning).

CWP.

Aside: Seems to me that recently I've been buying several stocks on Mondays
after having researched and evaluated these companies on the weekends. Past
week though, I've lost interest in stocks and have put this stuff aside. Too
shocked and demoralized I guess. (Has nothing to do with the stock market -
that will recover from recent events -- it's about the tragic human loss, the
unfathomable evil - our country's response to it, my response to it, etc.)

If I can get some focus back, I will finish my judgment of Cable and Wireless
(CWP) tonight. It's the 'spotlight stock' in the latest issue of Dick Davis
Digest. In terms of p/book and p/e, and given its big cash hoard and strong
presence in its market -- there could be a very decent chance (which I can't
quantify) that CWP will recover - if ever telecom ceases to be a dirty word in
the investment community. CWP also yields a good dividend. Seems like this
might be a stock that could work for many different types of value investors.

different businesses and getting focused. I'm with you. It's a buy, but it's a
cigar butt. (just the way you like it)

While on the subject of Telecom, you might want to look at MCLD, which is now
priced at about a buck. You may recall that Forstmann Little got involved with
this (may have got Caught UP in bubble thinking) and has been trying to salvage
its substantial investment ever since. They just hired a new CFO/COO who worked
miracles, apparently, at Gulfstream for FL. At the same time, they sold more
equity to FL, cut dividends on their preffered, and added a number of new board
members. FL is VERY involved now. Finally, Clark Mcleod doesn't strike me as a
guy who is about to go bankrupt, which seems to be how the shares are priced.

Hi Dale. Having my difficulties in trying to maintain focus. Entertainment and
entertainment stocks aren't high on my list. Maybe they should be.

I own TWTR although I've taken some profits with it. I'd say it's a hold - it
looks expensive, and there ought to be better bargains out there.

I chose TWTR in December over BBY and CC. That was a mistake. BBY was THE one.
BBY just looked so much more expensive though than others based on financials
and p/e ratios. However, their stores were crowded and still have good traffic
from what I observe. CC looked and looks empty by comparison (imo), and I've
never been in a TWTR.

These stocks seem to move in tandem, but the gains were superior for those who
bought BBY. Maybe it will again be BBY which outpaces TWTR??

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TWTR&d=c&k=c1&c=cc,bby&a=v&p=s&t=1y&l=on&z=m&q=l

I also have a position in SHRP. I'd guess anywhere about 9 or better is a buy -
imo. Although I've bought at higher prices in past.

I'm looking half-heartedly to re-establish a small position in MGM. Stock can
be got for prices less than insiders paid. Drawback is that it's hard to figure
the value of the company and its film library. My opinion is that it's a random
chance which movies will be successful and propel the share price (if they do.)
Eventually though... MGM stock could get some sprinkling of stardust.

Paul,

As far as I could tell, from looking at the company reports, BEAV has a
significantly negative tangible book value from goodwill ($700 million in
acquisitions). It wasn't called goodwill but "intangible assets" but I assume
it amounts to the same thing. On the other hand depreciation of that goodwill
depresses earnings considerably so cash earnings are much higher.

I took my first position in BEAV a few years ago at $13. (On the heels of some
insider buying) it dropped to $6 and then did well. I sold out half at $19 and
the other half at $24.75 on 2/2 & 3/7/01. So not long ago.

Plus the longterm chart shows it always rallies.

Some yahoos on the yahoo board are saying they will get all kind of business
from making the cabin doors safer. While that may be true, there is no question
the downturn will hurt. How much is the question. Conference call is tommorow.

My gut says it was panic selling and BEAV will have its day in the sun again.
Of course, they are very leveraged so anything could happen.

Glad to see SPOR announced another buyback today. I think SPOR would have
doubled if SPOR managers were in the WTC last week. I dont trust these guys any
farther than I can throw them. But the stock is just DARN cheap.

I added some BONT at $2.01 yesterday for a small account I manage. Had a small
order for myself at the same price that went unfilled.

I have to say overall I am disapointed in that a number of stocks I was hoping
would fall did not. I was prepared with a few dozen limit orders at various
prices on a bunch of stocks too.

I was sniffing around AINN but havent bought. Looking for insider favorites but
just not finding a lot out there.

Would like to mention CRTQ again. I like this stock. Trades just above cash

B/E Aerospace Reports Second Quarter Earnings Up 89 Percent, Comments On
Earnings Outlook
WELLINGTON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 19, 2001--B/E Aerospace, Inc.
(Nasdaq:BEAV - news) today announced financial results for the second quarter
of its fiscal year 2002 and commented on the company's earnings outlook for
fiscal 2002 and 2003.

HIGHLIGHTS: SECOND QUARTER

- Net earnings increased 89 percent compared to the second quarter

of last year

- Earnings per share increased 42 percent to $0.27 on the greater

number of shares outstanding

- Cash basis earnings increased to $0.44 per share

- Revenues increased 9 percent; up 6 percent on a pro forma basis

- Backlog increased to $635 million as of August 2001

SECOND QUARTER RESULTS

Net earnings were $8.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2002, up 89
percent compared to $4.7 million in the second quarter a year ago. Earnings per
share (diluted) were $0.27 for the second quarter of fiscal 2002, a 42 percent
increase compared to $0.19 for the same period last year. Cash basis earnings,
at $0.44 per share, were substantially higher than reported earnings. Cash
basis earnings exclude amortization and related tax effects.

Shares outstanding increased to 33.2 million (weighted average for the
quarter), reflecting the common stock offering completed in May 2001.

Higher revenues and improved profit margins drove the strong second quarter
results. Sales increased by 9 percent compared to the same quarter last year,
reflecting higher sales of both commercial aircraft products and business jet
products.

Sales for the quarter increased by 6 percent on a pro forma basis compared to
last year. Pro forma sales include sales from acquisitions completed in fiscal
2001 and 2002, but exclude prior-year revenues from the service operations,
which were discontinued as earlier reported. Pro forma sales also exclude both
current and prior-year revenues from the company's Advanced Thermal Sciences
subsidiary.

MARGIN IMPROVEMENT CONTINUES

B/E continued to improve its profit margins in the second quarter. The
company's operating profit margin increased by 180 basis points compared to the
same period last year, and by 40 basis points compared to the quarter ended May
2001.

OPERATING GROSS
MARGIN MARGIN

Current fiscal year:
- Second quarter 13.2% 38.5%
- First quarter 12.8% 37.3%

Prior fiscal year:
- Second quarter 11.4% 37.0%

B/E has increased its gross margin by 730 basis points since fiscal 1996, after
adjusting for merger and consolidation costs. The improvement reflects the
effective rationalization of product lines and facilities, and the success of
management's continuous improvement and lean manufacturing initiatives. Aided
by effective leveraging of information technology systems, these initiatives
are enabling operating management to drive down costs and improve both quality
and productivity.

B/E's commercial aircraft products segment performed well in the second
quarter, with sales up 12 percent and operating margin up 300 basis points
compared to the second quarter of last year. The business jet and engineering
services segments generally performed in line with management's expectations.
Sales of business jet products increased by 10 percent, while the engineering
services segment expanded its operating earnings by 5 percent.

SIX-MONTH REVIEW

Net earnings for the first half of fiscal 2002 excluding an extraordinary item
(debt extinguishment costs) were $16.7 million, an 82 percent increase compared
to the same period last year. Earnings per share excluding the extraordinary
item were $0.52, up 44 percent compared to the same period a year ago. Common
shares outstanding increased by 27 percent compared to last year. Higher sales
and improved profit margins contributed to the substantial increases in
earnings before the extraordinary item.

OTHER ACHIEVEMENTS

B/E's other achievements include:

- generated $38 million of net cash flow from operations for the

quarter, up from $14 million last year and significantly exceeding

reported earnings of $8.9 million;

- improved liquidity, increasing cash on hand by almost $15 million

for the quarter, and established a new 5-year, $150 million bank

credit facility;

- strengthened its balance sheet, reducing net debt to 73 percent of

net capital as compared to 90 percent one year ago; and

- announced a strategic expansion into the aerospace fastener

distribution market with the acquisition of M & M Aerospace

Hardware, Inc. for an initial purchase price of $177 million. The

M & M acquisition was completed after the end of the second

quarter. Consequently, M & M's revenues and expenses are not

included in the financial results announced today.

the past 35 years, '' said Mr. Robert J. Khoury, President and Chief Executive
Officer of B/E Aerospace. ``This year has seen airlines unfavorably impacted by
high labor and fuel costs, compounded by a steep drop in business travel. U.S.
airlines lost almost a billion dollars in the second quarter. For the usually
strong third quarter, analysts were projecting losses of approximately $450
million even before the tragic events of last week.

``In the wake of last week's events, U.S. airlines face a period of protracted
and severe financial stress and decreased air travel. Clearly, the airline
industry is headed for its largest annual loss ever in calendar 2001.

``Airframe manufacturers will likely see new aircraft deliveries decrease
significantly for the next several years,'' Mr. Khoury said. ``B/E is primarily
an aftermarket company, and is likely to be less impacted than most by
fluctuations in new aircraft deliveries. However, our airline customers will
undoubtedly implement emergency cash conservation measures which will have a
negative impact on our business.''

EARNINGS OUTLOOK

``Although the decline in airline financial results has been swift and sharp,
B/E's business remains fundamentally sound,'' said Mr. Khoury. ``Each of our
segments is solidly profitable. Each is benefiting from our ongoing continuous
improvement and lean manufacturing initiatives.

``We have strengthened our balance sheet in the past year and have good
liquidity, with cash and available bank credit of $156 million as of the end of
August and adjusted for completion of the M & M acquisition.

``Our management team has honed its skills during comparable airline industry
conditions in the early 90's. In addition, we are not solely dependent on the
U.S. airline industry. B/E is truly a global supplier, doing business with all
the world's major airlines and we have a substantial presence in the business
jet cabin interior market as well.

``With these attributes, and the largest installed product base in the
industry, we expect to emerge from this downturn with strengthened market
shares. However, given the unprecedented conditions in the airline industry, we
are unlikely to achieve the level of earnings growth anticipated in our
previous guidance, either this year or next.

``At the present time, we don't have enough information to provide quantitative
guidance on the earnings outlook,'' Mr. Khoury concluded. ``Within 3 to 6
months, we expect to have a clearer picture of how the airlines' austerity
measures will impact our business. However, with our market leadership, lean
manufacturing culture, seasoned management team and excellent liquidity, we
believe we will be able to remain profitable and cash flow positive through the
downturn.''

BEAV: While the retrospective financials look appealing, I see this as somewhat
analogous to telecom equipment providers as the CLEC's crashed. There will be
plenty of buying opportunities ahead...I put a stickynote on my desktop TAX

If I had a better feel for the industry, I might look at it differently, but if
I bought today, the guy selling me the shares would know a lot more than I.

Any thoughts on INLD?

It turned up on a screen I ran last night. It's evidently the
restructured/merged version of what used to be Micron Electronics. I used to
follow Micron a few years ago, but haven't paid any attention to it lately. It
looks like there's plenty of cash and no debt. I'm curious if anyone else has
looked at it recently, or follows the company, and what your opinions are about

Tourism in NYC will decline now I'd guess. And business travel to/from NYC
also. So Medallion Financial (TAXI) might very well suffer.

But cab drivers will do what they have to to pay off their loans to Medallion.
There might be some decline now in cab-top advertising revenue. That will
eventually be overcome. TAXI should be able to come through this, even if they
cut their substantial dividend. (There is no indication now that the dividends
will be diminished from their current levels.)

CWP, MBI-ABK

I'm still watching the price action on CWP.

Anybody here with a current opinion on MBI? Or ABK?

(I very well remember our discussions on these - me with MBI and Jim Clarke
with his fav. of ABK. Everybody here who bought made money (both stocks
advanced) - although it seems - again - that Jim's pick was the better choice.
Ah... for those simpler days of just a couple of years ago.)

If MBI is to be believed about their NYC exposure (I didn't believe them about
their exposure to California utilities and sold my position), this might be a

NEWP and NUHC trade slightly above net current assets, and appear to be solid
companies.

NEWP is taking a beating because 1/3 of its revenue is related to fiber.

NUHC is an electronic-component distributor that is down on what appears to be
pure cyclicality.

These were my two picks from a net-net screen I did yesterday.

Other stocks that turned up included:

SYMM, which is a telecom supplier (which I'd rather avoid), and

CAMT which is an Israeli maker of optical inspection equipment for printed
circuit board manufacturers (my only concern about this cyclical stock is the
low share price, which makes it more volatile).

I bought some NEWP and NUHC today, but not too much. That's because I expect,
as you do Bob, that there will be more opportunities in December, with tax loss
selling.

The screen that I'm using, by the way, is one that I described on this thread
back in April. It has criteria involving balance sheet (fraction of net-net)
and profitability in TTM. I used this screen successfully to pick some stocks
April 10, which turned out to bounce back much more vigorously than did the
RUT. Subsequently, the screen turned up nothing of interest until the last few
days, when it finally begun turning up some decent stocks again.

In other words, now is almost like April 10, in terms of the decent stocks one
can find that are trading near net-net and have a history of profitability.

To me this is highly significant. If they can remain profitable through such a

I suspect investors may be viewing this as analogous to the telecom equipment

'show-me' view...A 'Sell em all then buy back the ones that are working'
strategy.
Tax loss selling impacts ahead also may play into it.

Recent buys.
o Bought American Management (AMSY) at $14.36. It is valued around 11x 2001 eps
of 1.30 with conservative financing.

o Bought some Disney.

o Bought Pier 1 (PIR)... approaching a year low, around 10x eps of .81. The
company has a lot of cash and produces a lot of cash. I was pleased listening
to their conference call yesterday.

o Added to Sabre Group (TSG). I have no idea how badly it will be hurt by the
travel. This investment was made largely as an act of faith.

o Added to Cemex (CX). It is leveraged but the pre-disaster PE is now under 5.

o Started a position again in ADC Telecom (ADCT) at $3.15. I sold previously in
the mid $4s. The stock price has not been this low since 1994.

o Added to a Bank of New York (BK) position. The PE is in the mid teens.

o Added to OI and ET positions discussed previously.

o Started a position in WPP Group (WPPGY) at $38. The PE is in the mid teens.

SYMC (stop lossed out to prevent further loss)

MAIR (bought on Burry analysis, stopped out on 20% drop, may reenter once the

TSG (Got out with nice gain a couple of months ago after it broke support.
Lucky break.)

FDX (Got out before tragedy when I decided I wasn't in for the same reason I

BLS (Finally cut loose of inherited position that had done well until the last
two years)

Recent Buys(all before Sept 11):

AER - Burry pick once again, Buffett also holding I believe?

LQI - Burry Again

Still Holding:

ADCT - Inherited from PAIR holding. Sold most after run to 45 but kept a
little, bad mistake

CMH - Should have sold. Still up, but not much

MCO - Holding from DNB, has done excellent. Sold DNB due to uncertainty of
their future plans

EBSC - Still holding Clarke pick, Down a little but not much. Has come back
recently.

SNH - Have realized nice gains. Burry cut loose after management decided to
have a new offering. Doesn't trust management. Held on to get recent div. and
it went up but now has fallen back. May boot due to having LQI and AER.

SHOO was looking interesting until I found this in a SEC filing. Any comment?

CERTAIN RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

On June 20, 2000, Steven Madden, the Company's former Chairman and current
Chief
Executive Officer, was indicted in the Southern District and Eastern District
of
New York. The indictments allege that Mr. Madden engaged in securities fraud
and
money laundering activities. In addition, the Securities and Exchange
Commission
filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of New York alleging that Mr. Madden violated Section 17(a) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.

Neither the indictments nor the SEC complaint alleges any wrongdoing by the
Company or its other officers and directors. Mr. Madden has denied any improper
conduct and has advised the Company that he will vigorously defend himself
against any and all charges. See Part II, Legal Proceedings.

On June 21, 2000, Steven Madden resigned as Chairman of the Board of Directors
and the Company appointed Charles Koppelman as acting Chairman of the Board.
Mr.
Koppelman has been a director of the Company since June 1998. Mr. Madden
continues to serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer.

I found this is a July 12 Street.com piece:

Steve Madden: If the SHOO Fits ...

Meanwhile, I'm still shaking my head over this Steve Madden (SHOO:Nasdaq - news
- commentary) fiasco. Insiders last sold the trendy shoemaker in May 2000, one
month before the company's founder was charged with multiple counts of
securities fraud and money laundering. The stock summarily plunged 40% in a
single day. In late May, Madden pleaded guilty and was fined $8 million, though
he still faces a sentencing hearing.

Believe it or not, four Madden executives sold another 181,000 shares in April
and May. Apparently hardened to the ways of the world, the stock reacted much
less dramatically to the guilty plea than to the arrest. This was especially
fortunate for Madden, who summarily sold 285,816 shares for nearly $5 million.
Just when you thought you'd seen it all.

Then this snippet from a Reuters story on 8/21:

Madden in May pleaded guilty to criminal charges and faces a prison term of
between 41 and 51 months and fines totaling more than $8 million.

In a separate civil case with the SEC, Madden agreed to pay more than $7.8
million in disgorgement, fines and interest and to be barred from serving as an
officer or director of a publicly traded company for seven years.

Sentencing is expected to take place early next month.
