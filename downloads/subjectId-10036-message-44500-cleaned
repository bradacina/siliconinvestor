Hi Clownbuck -

When I stagger into a position I usually have a buy rule where I add more
shares 10% lower from my previous buy. I get that opportunity with FWLT in less
than 24 hours. Looking at the long term chart maybe $15.00/share is in the
cards but when this storm is over, I definitely want at least a 50% position. I
am going to hold off a few hours (or days) on this one unless I see a final
blow off.

As far a finding a bottom, I look for lower lows on lower volume. The one
positive on FWLT is it is hitting new lows on lower (vs avg daily volume)
volume. If the volume remain stagnant I may hold my nose and add more shares.
It seems like today the large drop is just a lack of buyers.

I came into the week with a large amount of cash but have already used up my
allotment for the day/week but I am seeing lots of bargains as long as this is
not Armageddon.

OT:
I've been reading about Ray Dalio of Bridgewater - very interesting guy and
incredible long term record (over 30 years with 15% return and manages over 100
billion dollars). I thought the following article was very eye opening.

http://www.hedgefundletters.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/a-template-for-under
tanding.pdf

There's more info at his website and with a google search. If he is right, we
are basically in a depression and I am wondering if just trying to buy cheap
stocks is going to be enough. Specifically, I am interested in his concept of
having uncorrelated return streams. As an individual investor I feel it's hard
to find an investments that are uncorrelated with the stock market. Some
uncorrelated ideas that I can come up with are:
Gold/precious metals
Commodities - I am not sure whats the best way to play this. Oil? Farming?
Boswell is interesting but it's seems like a black box.
mortgage REIT - NLY, still correlated to debt market
Pharma - somewhat uncorrelated to general economy/stock market
I would be very interested in knowing what other people thought about this
article and his investing approach.

Reno4, my opinion is that in a market like we are seeing these days, if it
trades on an exchange, it's going to be correlated to the stock market. They're
all correlated. That is, as far as I can tell every sector is down -- food,
commodities, gold, mortgage reits, publicly-traded hedge funds, and so on.

The only thing seems to be to what extent are they related to the changes. That
is, I'm looking at the S&P down about 3.3% now, my oil stocks maybe down 6-7%
or more on average, and something like NLY down .3%.

What he wrote makes sense and is mostly correct.

Regarding "uncorrelated return streams", I don't think this is easy. Like today
shows, gold, commodities get shot down too. Pharmas are dangerous if there is a
move towards more government controlled medicine (btw, so far Dalio was wrong
when he said that in expansions everyone is a capitalist while in recessions
everyone is a socialist - the move is definitely not that way in USA, but I
don't want to get into politics on this thread). Furthermore, even pharmas lose
sales - during 2008/2009 the number of doctor visits dropped significantly as
people lost insurance coverage and I am sure this also affected high margin
prescription drugs and med devices.

You can hold cash, but in his model it will be inflated like heck. You can try
to hold foreign currencies but you have to know how much of them are
uncorrelated. The best thing probably is to find self-sufficient,
(credit)-expanding economy and invest there (Brazil? India? probably not
China). You will still lose money since foreign investors sell assets in that
economy to cover their delevering. But you may come out quicker and with better
results if/when that economy outgrows the delevering one.

Overall though, the world is interconnected in a lot of ways and true
"uncorrelation" is very elusive. Plus what he calls interim "bear market
rallies" may yield great returns even in delevering economy. So there's no
simple way to "win". ;)

Hi J Mako -

Generally Pink sheet stocks typically trade with a large spread. When you buy
or sell shares you should use limit prices and most of the time you can
transact a trade somewhere in the middle of the price spread. This is important
especially if the Pink sheet stock trades on little volume (this is referred to
as thinly traded).

Therefore if I have a low ball offer to buy shares at the Bid, and a seller has
entered a "market" sell order, I will get the shares at my Limit Bid price. The
difference between the best Bid and best Ask is referred to as the spread. On
some of the Pink sheet stocks, this can be as much at 10%. That is why you must
use limit Buy orders or Limit Sell orders NOT Market orders when trading in the
Pink Sheets.

If you search GOOGLE with some of these key words described above, you will get
more detailed explanations.

There are two answers to that:

- Yes, you should have taken profits if your positions went from being
undervalued in 2009 to being overvalued in 2011. "Buy and hold" does not mean
"buy and hold forever". At least not in my mind.
- Alternatively, if you really believe in Buffett's maxim of selling never -
although he does not believe in it himself and sells all the time - you should
have invested in companies with such a moat and competitive advantage that
after current crash and eventual recovery they will reach much higher prices
than they have reached in spring 2011. There are very very few companies with
such characteristics, so you have to be very picky. But they are there.

Personally, I go with the first approach and hope that I may snag couple
companies of the second approach by chance.

re AAZ.L - i don't shoot this one down. it probably would be worth a small
position for me. Here is how I see it:

1) They operate a single gold mine in Aserbaidchan and are nicely profitable
2) Projected earnings are supposed to go down in 2012, I assume because they
have to pay a 12% royalty on revenues after recouping their investment
3) decent cash flow from existing mine allows them to prospect for new
concessions in a relative large area where they may have some exclusivity.

I'd say the homework would be to find out as much about the current management
as possible, in particular if they are trustworthy. I am not sure how much
background sleuthing you have done on this name but I would be interested in

AAZ.L - you got it pretty well. Here are some additional considerations:

- Part of their concession is in Nagorno Karabakh
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh , which is contested territory
with Armenia with Azerbaijan having no control over the territory. It is
probably a pipe dream to expect a mine there, but company is open about the
"occupied territories", so they are not misleading investors.
- Azerbaijan was very corrupt during Soviet times and it probably remains so.
This does not preclude a viable company there, since a lot of resource rich
countries are corrupt.
- AAZ has John H Sununu http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Sununu on their
BOD and as a significant investor. Sununu + Reza Vaziri and Khagani Bashirov
hold over 50% shares. Sununu's reputation is lacking, but perhaps he's better
investor than White House chief-of-staff... Sununu and Vaziri are connected
through US Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce. It's not clear how Khagani Bashirov

re: if you really believe in Buffett's maxim of selling never

The way I see it, Buffett's "buy and hold forever" is a strategy he uses to
convince would-be business sellers to sell him their treasured businesses. He
wants others to see him as a white knight. He knows too well if you look at the
individual holding alone, "hold forever" is irrational. But in the overall

Converting to Roth: I continue to bet on an eventual recovery of oil stocks
from current lows.

Some oil stocks seem low enough to me to where I'll move them from my ira into
a recently established Roth: I am converting some high-cost shares of SU,
MAUXF, and MHR now.

With an ira, the government is my partner (taxing my withdrawals). I look at it
as if they're sort of a partner in my losses too as the ira value goes up and
down with the market. With the Roth transfer, if there's a recovery gain in
stocks, I wouldn't have to share those gains with the fed/state governments .

(Fwiw, another other consideration for me: My ira is my largest portfolio; my
Roths are very small in comparison. Because we can't know what future fed/state
tax changes might affect retirement accounts, I'd like more of a balance

The Dow Chemical Company (DOW)
Black Hills Corporation (BKH)

I sold another lot of my BKH shares and plan to move the proceeds into DOW. DOW
is now yielding over 4% and it's a company I want to add to my AG basket. Not
too sure if it is the right time in the cycle (w/ potential of double dip) but
it looks like a good value buy at current price levels.

My last few shares of BKH (originally purchased 5/6/2009 @ $19.79), I plan to
sell and move into MDU Resources Group, Inc. Commo(NYSE: MDU ) on any move
below by MDU below $18.00/share. It's hard to let loose of BKH (I know you
bought some around the same time at $17.00/share) but it's been a good run and
I was able to peel off 1/2 at $38.00/share earlier this year.

FWIW, I increased my MHR holding by 30% today (@ $3.77/share) and I was able to
get the shares lower than my 8/11/2010 original entry price. I am buying these
shares based on the value of their Midstream Operation (perhaps worth $500M)
which could be operating earlier than expected (Q4 2011). If so, stock could be
50% higher as this subsidiary business is worth at least $4.00/share.
Shareholders should receive MLP units when spun off from MHR early next year.

I do expect MR Market to move lower (perhaps as much as 10%) but feel there are
enough good value stocks out there now that picking up a few shares now (and
possibly more at lower levels) will provide a good return over 2-3 year holding
period. Some of these value picks are also paying pretty good dividends so
holding them during any sustained down turn will still generate portfolio
income.

The key for me is to work on booking all my losses prior to year end to offset
a lot of the gains I took earlier in the year. I want to try to fill up my
basket of value stocks on continued market sell offs and/or year end loss
selling. I guess this is the nature of turning the portfolio over as some of
those 2009 bargains are being sold to buy the 2011 bargains (ie BKH).

PSR:

Well, short story is that for cyclicals (and even not cyclicals but low margin
etc. companies) sales fluctuate much less than earnings. So PSR is good metric
when you cannot evaluate P/E due to losses. Obviously this assumes that
earnings will recover, so it should be applied to strong companies, maybe
during recessions and market downturns when losses happen even to good
companies. It is less clear whether applying it to weak companies during
regular market turns good performance. In regular market low PSR usually means
weak company with low margins (distributor).

Ken says that PSR is not useful anymore because everyone started using it for
investments and the edge is gone. I disagree at least in part. IMHO PSR is less
useful because we have many more high margin businesses (in tech land) and
because we have not had many strong recessions until 2009. So there are three
issues. First, low PSR stocks during expanding economy are usually weak and bad
businesses, so low PSR does not work well. Second, in current economy recovery
of weak low-PSR company is harder due to international competition for low
margin, low value products. Third, with high margin businesses PSR becomes less
attractive as a metric, since even in downturn the PSR remains high and it is
almost impossible to buy good businesses using this metric.

I still suggest that you'd read the PSR story straight from the horse's (Ken's
;)) mouth though, since I have possibly quite misrepresented it. ;)

have to sell it if his ownership percentage increases due to stock buybacks or
similar. Maybe it's the same with FAIRX and BAC - he cannot buy more than 5%,
but he is not forced to sell if the percentage climbs above 5% due to asset
shrinkage.

However, if this is the case, then the problem is that he cannot buy more as

relevant to a lot of the value investment Buys I make (Note: SVU comes to mind
- Great cash flows but more new lows):

"...The other thing that’s required, I should say, is patience, because it’s
impossible to time it right. I know you’re going to get some lessons on
technical analysis. I’ve tried. It never worked for me. I’ve tried everything.
Chicken bones, technical analysis. <u>I just seem to always suffer from, what I
could call premature accumulation</u>. I would buy and I would buy too soon. I
would buy more, and more the way some people would buy their favorite product
on sale at the department store. This requires fortitude, courage, confidence
and conviction. And make sure you’re not in denial about what you believe the
cash flows of a company to be....".

When discussing their BAC investment there was no mention to the
"Mark-to-Market" accounting and when the bank might return to this accounting.
It is true that mortgages will turn over on average every 7 years but this
particular cycle is not normal. So, if those mortgages have turned over (and
were under water) how do they treat the "actual" loss and were these properties
reappraised? How is the bank fixing these loans: (1) re-amortizing them over 30
years, lowering interest rates, eating a portion of the loan balance to reflect
the actual value of the property, (2) foreclosing; selling property at a loss,
(3) providing temporary extensions (ie kick the can down the road).

Therefore, even if the standard 7 year mortgage turnover period passes, there
is still a large amount of these sour loans that still need to be written off
since they are based on an earlier unrealistic market appraisals. By not having
to adjust their loan portfolio to market (ie mark-to-market), the value of
their loans are significantly overstated (even if they are performing). To me
it's just a "black-box" for BAC.

I agree with Jurgis that the risk to the common share holder is dilution.
Buffet was smart to demand a preferred series that would not be impacted by
common share dilution. Any recapitalization will wipe out the common shares.

I would be an investor if I heard that the company was doing a work out where
new loans were marked-to-market and new appraisals were completed based on
current market values. If one could see where they were in the work out of sour
loans and/or those that needed to be adjusted based on the current market
value, one could have a better feel for how overstated the true value of the
loan portfolio is.

With Berkowitz saying that the number of loans they have in the portfolio is
too large to manage on a loan by loan basis ( he was comparing to what
insurance companies do for determining risk on all the policies they hold in a
region) is just foolish. That confirms to me that the bank is just too big.
Every loan in their portfolio 10 years or newer needs to be re-appraised. Those
that were interest only, liar loans and have equity of 10% or less needs to be
re-qualified.

The last time I went through BAC's report(s) I saw nothing along these lines.
When I scan my Credit Unions quarterly and annual statements, I know exactly
the make up of their mortgage loan portfolio, the outstanding loans vs current
market value of their collateralized real estate and the age, type and
performance of these loans.

It is true time will eventually make things better and as their extremely large
cash flows continue, it's the uncertainty of what their total loan liability
is. The pending litigation liability stemming from business they transacted
between 2002-2010 and the alleged fraud on applications and the bundled loans
sold to third parties (ie Fannie Mae Freddie Mac) adds another level of
uncertainty.

Berkowitz could be right in the long term but at the time of the article his
cost basis on BAC was $12.00/share. As of the close Friday, Bank of America
Corporation Com (NYSE: BAC ) shares were priced at $6.31.

Yes, this is the rule that Buffett bumped against with AXP, I believe.

However, I don't think that's the rule that Berkowitz is bumping against. There
must be another one that applies to mutual funds and banks and/or broker

Judging from GLW's recent price/volume pattern and the fact of its improved
balanced sheet since the last cyclical low, the $11-$12 dollar range should be
a good entry point for value investors.

re taking losses. I also believe that people are taking losses now. Many are
selling out for good - I have two colleagues that sold everything during the
last 2 weeks. I have started to cycle through my high tax shares. I did start
selling high cost shares in FLU.VI and several others with the hope of buying
back at the same price of cheaper after 31 days and booking ST tax losses this

re CAT and IBM during the great depression-
IBM survived and prospered because Watson kept the factories running building
up inventory. With his huge inventory of tabulator machines IBM was able to bit
on the huge newly instated social security contract that required processing
power.
CAT was able to keep themselves afloat selling AG machines to the Soviet Union.
The Soviet union was reorganizing their farming into huge collective farm and
CAT was able to supply them with big machines that they wanted.

Looks to me that both were more lucky then smart, or at least they know how to
grasp an opportunity under very adverse circumstances. Still CAT revenues went
from 50M$+ to 13M$+ If someone really believes that a great recession may come,
picking winners will be futile, the thing to do is so short the indices.

I might have a different opinion.

"...Ken's repeatedly stressed advice only to apply PSRs to Super Companies".
Otoh, he wrote an entire chapter on "Applying Price Sales Ratios to Nonsuper
Stocks", In my copy of the book, I highlight p. 82 and p.88 for his rules.

"PSR currently does not work well because we have been in a high ROE/margin
environment for a long time."

I use PSR. All the time. Currently it does not work. My explanation for why it
doesn't work now, is that there is nothing that works now. Everything is

Yes, but it does not have zero relationship with what you wrote. FWIW, the idea
of PSR is to use a ratio that does not include earnings,because earnings do not
work when there are none. I have seen some articles aout valuing based on
economic footprint, which includes, sales, book value, employee #and other
metrics. This works probably better than PSR alone, but is harder to calculate.

With my limited understanding of TA, I'm not sure how to interpret this
information or whether it's reliable on its own. For instance, if you look at
the trade volume on July 27, 2011. It was 44m, while the days before and after
it were in mid-teens. By this alone, can we argue "Volume picked up
significantly as generally everyone who wanted out got out and allowed the
trend to reverse"? The price has seen fallen from $16 to $12.35...

Or, would it be helpful to think in probabilistic terms? i.e. "the trend is

got out?"

I'm still trying to learn this stuff.

Paul, Value has the same voodoo as technicals for someone not familiar with the
terminology.

I explained in fundamental terms why GLW was at risk and I also explained why I
would never have looked at these factors if it wasn't for the technicals. And I
offered where Neff's philosophy of looking at stocks hitting 52 week lows, a
technical event, was a starting point for reviewing stocks.

Nothing exists in a vacuum. Value must take into consideration what else is
going on if it is representative of market conditions, but it is not. When you
posted earlier that nothing is working, how long does that apply to?

We've gone nowhere since the beginning of Aug. after a drop. And we are now at
the bottom of the trading range we've been in since Aug. Most folios have a
negative from the drop in early Aug. and had some recovery only to see it all
go back down.

So what's going on? If the market goes up tomorrow, we're most likely in the
same trading range. If we have a down day, let's look at the volume. A break of
the trend right now, specially with volume and I will be pushing my way to the
exit.

If you want to adhere to true Value, you just buy based on value terms and wait
and ignore the market and you don't say that nothing works right now because
its not about right now. Value waits for the market to find it.

I don't know why you keep associating Mr. Neff with technicals. Looking at 52
week lows is a value event. If you say looking at 52 week lows is a technical
event, esp. if one should look at volume at that time, so okay- it's technical
(too) -g-. Neff was never a technical analysis guy though afaik. In his book
"John Neff on Investing" 'volume analysis' is never mentioned. About technical
analysis, on page 44 - Mr. Neff's only reference to 'technical analysis', he
says about Windsor portfolio before he arrived: "Poor performance often
occurred as a consequence of a technical orientation that tried to predict
peaks and troughs in stock charts. It assumed that where a stock has been
implies where it is going. Many funds used charts to divine future stock
prices...Playing the technical or momentum game always has seemed misguided to
me."

If you've found your work with TA has been satisfactory for you, then very
good. I appreciate that you are trying to warn me or others of the risk you see
with GLW from your technical analysis perspective. You could be right. This is
a value thread though, and from my perspective of value investing, I'll not
change my opinion when to make a buy. Rightly or wrongly, volume on drops
almost always being irrelevant in my view for a buy decision when I'm focusing
on possible sales 2-3 years forward.

When a stock is hitting a 52 week low is when Mr. Neff would review the merits
of GLW and rather than assume that management will respond okay would look at
what's going on.

I reviewed the merits as well and found what the issuea are...and I do not rely

I am really torn what to do about BRK.

On one hand, it is cheapest in quite a while. And if they buyback, Buffett is
implying that he does not see better opportunities elsewhere even at current
low prices.

On the other hand, BRK is big. Huge. Which is tough to grow well. It is a
conglomerate and even with all Buffett's assurances that it's a conglomerate of
great businesses, I am not so sure it's easy to keep these businesses great as
NetJets example showed. We also know from Buffett himself that he holds some
crappy businesses that he won't sell because he never sells subsidiaries. So
it's not just great businesses. On the investment side I am not excited about
Buffett transitioning away. Perhaps the guys he hired are good. But are they
great? Can they manage huge BRK-size sums of money? Will they be happy in
coo-petition at BRK? I would give about 90% chance that they won't be as good
as Buffett. Finally, Buffett clock is ticking and I really don't want to see
him die, but it will happen. Every day sooner rather than later. :(

Following you out and selling almost all my BRKb shares now. Also am assuming I
might have an opportunity to buy back sometime later at lower price.

CAG. Have not been able to determine what might happen with CAG -- another
acquisition attempt, maybe CAG itself is targeted by somebody. I decided I'll
just sell my stub position and stay at sidelines for while.

AMNF,

The company is having strong results and doing all the right things, with a
nice divvy and buyback. Congrats to all shareholders, especially those with the
insight to buy last year. If I can convince myself that the last year and a
half of results can continue indefinitely, then it is a buy.

That being said, I continue to lean toward not buying (I looked at this on
earlier posts and probably missed a great buying opportunity). I have gotten
burned before buying microcaps at peak values when earnings are good and then
getting creamed when earnings drop back down, especially in this case when you
have a microcap stock with book value around 0.17 and that was trading under
0.50 for much of last year.

The earnings on microcaps can really bounce around from year to year. This is
where Benjamin Graham's suggestion of using many years to calculate earnings
improves the margin of safety. The PE on this one is roughly 12 off of 2010
earnings, 17 off of 2009 earnings, and 39 off of 2008 earnings. My concern is
that if, for whatever reason, the earnings revert to 2009 or worse levels, the
stock could revert back to the 0.50 range.

On the other hand, maybe the earnings will remain strong or even grow from
here. Does anyone have a strong view that earnings will continue to grow? If I
continue to wait long enough, maybe they will build up a low long-term PE :)

Thanks,
MC
