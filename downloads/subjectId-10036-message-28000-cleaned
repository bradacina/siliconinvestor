Hi Paul,

There are many ways to approach the market. I agree that value is keyed on
price and if the price is low enough, the value could be there. That doesn't
necessarily mean that the 52 week low list is a good place to find value imo.
Your PKX discussion back in April is a case in point. The 52 week low list is
definitely a place to find unloved stocks that have performed poorly over the
past 12 months. That's all we can say with certainty. As to saying why they
performed so poorly over that time frame, I think it requires more analysis
than most to find the turn arounds among that group. It's nothing like shooting
fish in a barrel. Whereas buying stocks that were at all time highs in early
July and 6 month lows on August 16 seemed to illustrate an opportunity that
reflected potential where one could employ more of a higher probability barrel
approach due to inordinate oversold conditions. Certainly there could be a few
values on the 52 week low list that will prove themselves out over time.

As to your question, I scan a database using custom software to find stocks
that are at or near 6 month lows, and will post a list of a few that I think
are worth a look. As always though, beauty will be in the eye of the beholder.

October 2002 was a great time to find value. Your OMG has had a nice ride since
then. What will be your determining factors on when to sell?

If the price is low enough, the value could be there.

I can't think of any great value investors who allocated their funds based on
"If/could" propositions instead of "Price is, assets are, earnings are, future
value should be" calculations.

Is it just me or does that sound speculative?

I'd like to believe I'm not buying stocks willy-nilly off the new lows list
merely because they are at lows.

I scan the lows list for possible opportunities. I consider such stocks because
they "could" be a value. I wouldn't know until I've checked further. "If" I
come to believe the stock at the price is a value, I'm interested in buying.
"If" the stock, even at its 12-month low, looks expensive to me based on my
models and judgment, then the stock price has to drop further before I'll once
again consider it.

Sure, some people don't want to get involved or don't want to consider stocks
that are hitting lows. At the lows, that there means trouble, and who needs
trouble? -- is one reason. And a good one too.

As it turns out, a database scan result for stocks at or near 6 month lows
during August looks something like this.

ACAT AER ALB AMT ARO ASCA ASI AVTR BAM BER BMC BNI CCJ CECE CENX CLHB CMS COLM
CPS CRS CVH CYBS DB DOV DRQ EME EOG EXP FCFS FISV FMX FPL GILD GLF HSII JOSB

TSCO TSO TTWO UNH UNT USPH VAL VFC WCN WLT WSH XEC XTO ZEUS ZNT

I’ll have to retract my statement that 6 month lows offer better opportunities
than 52 week lows based on actual results. Perhaps the August lows came and
went so fast that I’m still stuck in August 16th opportunity mode. Some of
these have rebounded a bit. I haven't looked at any in great length but would
be most inclined to take a further look at TSO GLF or TEX. Other than that,
small caps SYNL or ZEUS may be worth a look.

Of the near 52 week low list, NVS has some appeal based on their stronghold in
the Diabetes marketplace.

A scan of charts this afternoon that took about 2 or 3 hours gives me an eerie
feeling that a mixed and confusing bear market has already started. Too many
stocks are not doing well as a percentage of the total. Way too many moving
average crossovers to the downside, and too many failed rallies that can't seem
to get the market back in unison with an upward bias for the broad list. With
September being the worst month historically, and everyone on to that fact,
it's quite possible that September turns into a very good month for the market
and perhaps a last hurrah. I see alot of defensive postures put on currently,
and until they come off, and until the bias is towards greed in lieu of fear,
it’s not likely to draw in the little guy in. The market will have to rally
better and more impressively to get everyone back on board. Put call ratios are
still extremely high and there have been more high readings in that ratio than
at the 2002-2003 lows and more than the June 2006 lows. Maybe its true that Bin
Laden has been buying puts, or that we are ready to hit Iran. Given the
disintegrated nature of this rebound reflex rally, I probably won't buy
anything new for more than a trade attempt unless it screams at me and hits me
over the head with a bat.

CPO interests me here, but not so much from a stellar value standpoint as a
possible trade with a short fuse stop.

I guess there is no systematic approach that can really be used to find good
stocks in this environment. Seems it's a matter of hunting them down one by one
and researching each one individually. So much for systems.

I remember years ago after reading don't BUY until there's blood running in the

I looked at the PM market and said, WOW look at all these stocks selling for
.10c on the dollar.
It looked like I was in a buyers heaven, so I promptly placed my bids and
watched.
I watched all right as my new found wealth went from .10c on the dollar to a
penny on the dime.

What do we do now, ----- Boy, who really knows.

What I do know is that if I sleep well at night everything is generally fine.
And when I don't sleep well, as in just before this summers melt down, its time

homebuilder- i find and lev an interesting situation. i have not done any
analysis but i find their decision to offer 100 million rights to existing
shareholders to purchase shares at $2 an interesting one, given the fact the
the stock is currently at $2.20 or so. I would think that existing shareholders
would short this down to $2.08 or so and take the quick guaranteed profit while
they can, also curious why someone would pay $2.20 or $2.30 now. Does anyone
follow this stock? have an opinion on it?
It would seem that if they could end up with a cash infusion of $200 million it
would help them a great deal. on the other hand it also seems clear that they
had to do this cause they couldnt get anymore debt or issue preferred shares.

I don't know about the LEV arbitrage play; I've lost money betting on BFC as a
sum-of-parts play. (LEV being one of the companies BFC controls) When the
underlying securities decline, as they did (e.g. BBX, LEV), the value and worth
of the controlling entity can and did drop too, no matter that the controlling
entity to begin with was undervalued vis-a-vis the sum of values (stock price
market cap) of the securities held.

AIB is a rock solid bank, but you have to wonder about the Irish housing
market.

http://www.finfacts.ie/biz10/irelandhouseprices.htm

Also, SSIA scheme that provided incentives for borrowers in Ireland has now
expired. So some Irish deposits could be exiting. See explanation below.

The SSIA scheme opened on 1 May 2001 and entry to it closed on 30 April 2002.
The scheme allows savers to subscribe to their SSIA account on a monthly basis
for a 60 month period (minimum of €12.50 for first 12 months and a maximum of
€254) and the Government provides a top-up (tax credit) of 25% of the value of
subscriptions made in each month.

The accounts are due to mature between May 2006 and April 2007 depending on
when the account was originally opened. When an SSIA account matures, the saver
is entitled to the funds in the SSIA less Exit Tax at 23% on the profit made
from the investment of both the saver’s subscriptions and the Exchequer
contribution (subject to compliance with the conditions of the scheme). In
order for an account to be matured, the account holder will be required to make
a maturity declaration to his or her financial institution at any time within a
period of 3 months ending on the maturity date. Information regarding SSIA
maturity is already published on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.

Thank you for the helpful link. I am aware of problems with the irish housing

BZP. Every once in a while, there's a dink company with no earnings that
somebody makes a case for as a great opportunity, and the idea gets carried
throughout SI. People who don't know what they are doing get sucked into
believing and buying, and buying and believing. For me, I'd say I get caught up
not so much in believing, but more in crowd-following and buying. Such as with
BZP.

In reflecting, it seems my experience in doing this has resulted my becoming
mostly involved with companies that turn out to be losers. (Maybe, the SI
sharpies are just so much better than me in picking exit points, if these
stocks even go up.)
Otoh though , occasionally there are winners for me. My memory - selective as
it is for favorable events vs. more forgetting of unfavorable events - tells me
that while I've sometimes/often lost near everything bet on the losers, the
winners can double, triple, quadruple or more.

BZP might be one of the few (in my experience) where favorable event/events
(today's positive news) will result in positive expectations. That is, it could
turn out to be a company with actual profits or significant, verifiable
producing assets. If promise/potential seem to be turning to fact, sure, I'm
willing to increase my bet. Not by much, because I've been wrong many, many
times. (-g-)

Right now BZP/others are just small bets to me. Not much affecting my
portfolio. I don't know enough about such companies to take significant stakes.
Or have enough faith in the people who recommend these things. To me, it's more
like being at a bar and watching a sporting game with a bunch of other guys,
and having money bet on the game... just to put some interest/enthusiasm into
the discussion and outcome.

All jmo, others may vary.

that they did not yet cover BZP and a few others that were presenting but that
that would change over time. What also seems clear to me as a novice is that

ourt Gives Overstock.com the Okay to Proceed and Denies Prime Brokerages
Attempts to Derail Exposure

SALT LAKE CITY, July 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Overstock.com, Inc.
(NASDAQ:OSTK) (http://www.overstock.com/) announced today a favorable ruling in
the lawsuit pending in the Superior Court of California, County of San
Francisco against most of the largest prime brokerage firms in the country,
including Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Goldman Sachs & Co., Bear Stearns
Companies, Inc., Bank of America Securities LLC, Bank of New York, Citigroup
Inc., Credit Suisse (USA) Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc., Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., and UBS Financial Services, Inc.

On July 17, 2007, Judge John Munter of the California Superior Court for the
City and County of San Francisco ruled that Overstock and it co-plaintiffs have
stated viable claims for market manipulation under California securities law,
for common law claims for conversion and trespass to chattels, as well as for
injunctive relief under California's Unfair Business Practices Act against the
defendant prime brokerage firms based on those defendants allegedly executing
naked short sales of the stock of Overstock with the intent of manipulating the
market price for the shares of those companies' stocks. In addition, the Court
granted Overstock (and its co-plaintiffs) leave to amend other of their claims
for restitution under the Unfair Business Practices Act and for the common law
claim of interference with advantage, to more specifically plead the factual
basis of these claims.

In so ruling, Judge Munter rejected defendants' claims that Overstock's
complaint is preempted by federal law and that 'phantom' shares are not created
by naked short selling of a company's stock as a matter of law.

"This is a huge win for us," said Jonathan Johnson, Overstock Senior Vice
President of Legal. "We are eager to start discovery and move this case to
trial. The day we expose in detail the defendants' misconduct to a jury will be
a good day for Overstock, its shareholders and the capital markets."

"As I listened to defendants' counsel argue that phantom shares don't exist
because the SEC says they don't exist," said Patrick Byrne, Overstock Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, "I was reminded on Abraham Lincoln's favorite
joke: 'If you call a tail a leg, how many legs does a dog have?' 'Five?' 'No,
four -- because calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg.' Defendants create
phantom shares by facilitating naked short selling and other types of trades
which result in failures-to-deliver. This is manipulative and illegal --
regardless of what the industry's all-too-cozy regulatory agency says. The
battle to clean up Wall Street is only going to be won when it is brought to a
jury of 12 Americans. Today was a giant step towards that goal."

The suit alleges that the defendants, who control over 80% of the prime
brokerage market, participated in a massive, illegal stock market manipulation
scheme and that the defendants had no intention of covering such orders with
borrowed stock, as they are required to do, causing what are referred to as
"fails to deliver." The suit also alleges that the defendants' actions caused
and continue to cause dramatic distortions with regard to the nature and amount
of trading in the company's stock which have caused the share price of the
company's stock to dramatically drop. The suit asserts that a persistent large
number of "fails to deliver" creates large downward pressure on the price of a
company's stock and that the amount of "fails to deliver" has exceeded the
company's entire supply of outstanding shares. The company is seeking damages
of $3.48 billion.

Yes, I clip the CEO letters from annual reports. Don't find much value in going
back looking through them though. Given my opinion that these guys are mostly
salesmen, whether they do or do not accomplish what they say are their
objectives -- even if I can understand the general gobblygook that their staff
guy or consultant writes (I assume most of these CEO guys don't dare write and
edit their own material), they shift things and blame: weather caused it;
Interest rates caused it; we are in a transition year; I am proud of the
progress we've made (even though earnings aren't there)---- all the other
pablum.

----------

Value investors can be different in what we look for and the results we believe
we're getting from our searches. In theory, I should like reading and comparing
annual letters by the ceo. In practice, for me, I find it generally irrelevant.

Of course, just my way, and I could be very, very wrong in having missed some
great opportunities.

I keep trying to find a reason to buy won but having trouble. went to the web
site and found it cumbersome to use as a consumer. I was hoping for more from a
media company. I think it would make sense for a technology company like apple
to buy them.

I ve looked just a little bit at CFC and I just dont understand how theyve
gotten into so much trouble . could someone explain this to me? Only thing I
can think of is that they were holding on to an awful lot of loans that they
were not able to sell or that they had to repurchase because of defaults and
that they had to fund those repurchases by drawing down on bank lines. Is that
what happened? meanwhile i see that there is now a class action suit involving
their 401 k plan. I havent seen that before. I also saw some article expressing
curiousity that their ceo has kept getting options at the low for the year for
the past 3 years. Seems like things may keep getting uglier for cfc. I wonder
if anyone has looked at this and seen some warning signs other than the insider
selling and a steady decline in the share price. Will we see the same at WAMU?

Hi Madharry - WON is a very speculative play and would probably not fit in with
your new portfolio upgrade strategy. Keep your eye on these global natural
resource companies. I own BHP, AAUK, AU & RIO. The problem is that they are
trading near their all time highs.

I missed buying more RIO at $36 a few weeks back and it is now trading over
$53! It seems like the integrated oils, energy and natural resource companies
are still working and when they become under valued, small buys are in order.
These are core positions in my portfolio and my original starter positions were
acquired more than 20 years ago. They continue to pay good dividends and will
do well with a falling dollar.

I do continue to look at different media companies but I have found it is a
difficult market to calculate "value". One problem is that changes in
technology disrupts future ad revenue estimates. I watch CBS and DIS. I guess I
like CBS if it would trade below $25.

I am trying to be very selective on my new buys and prefer to hold cash while I
wait. My cash position has increased to 22% of the portfolio up from 15%. As I
peel off shares and find no compelling new buys, I suspect my cash holdings
will exceed 30%. However, there may be some good opportunities when tax loss
selling occurs in the next few months.

Patience and discipline are in order. I am still learning these attributes but
find that the portfolio does much better when I follow these rules.

While p/b is .6 now, it has been below .6 in '01, '02, '03. In other years

(imo) .6 of past years.

Well. You can look at earnings as your reason to buy a stock. I look at value.
The real estate at Dillards is worth over book in my opinion. That means that
the earnings are really just icing on the cake so to speak. The fact that they
have earnings is a bonus for me, as eventually the stock price will reflect the
real estate value.

Also, owner earnings, not accounting earnings is what I look at. For dillards,
they have substantial depreciation and cap ex for expanding to new locations. I
think this has to be looked at as a 400MM dividend that goes back to the
stores.

This isn't managed like Berkshire, but it is worth $30 a share. Just my
thoughts.

I don't know if you read the most recent MECA PR or listen to the most recent
CC, but it appears that they are serious about eliminating their debt. The Q&A
is particularly interesting as Frank bares his soul with an uncommon frankness,
no pun intended. Basically, their backs were to the wall and they were running
out of money, so he had no choice but to dismantle the "empire". No one really
knows how much they will raise with the asset sales and a future rights
offering could be waiting in the wings. The share price responded to the news,
but there are many questions about the implementation of the plan, so I expect
some retracement. Golden Gate, which is a very valuable property, sounds like
it is off-limits for now. Family money is also going into the reorganization.
So I'm intrigued by the plan and will probably put in some buy orders at lower
levels.

DDS. Junglekings, I've looked a little closer -- not much though - and here's
where I am now regarding Dillard's:

I vaguely remember something published about Dillard's having a hidden asset in
its real estate. I can't find any documentation or analysis though. I've gone
back to your website and don't see anything that gives me any further insight
as to how that value might be calculated, who has done it, or why or to whom
that real estate - which I assume is primarily big box buildings? - might be
valuable.

For me, given my lack of knowledge about this real tangible value vs. stated
book value, I'm going to stick with stated book value.

The question for me then is what return does the company get on its stated book
value? Answer: It has averaged a lousy 5.2% over the past ten years. The
significant thing is though, as you mention or allude, is that you can buy the
stock for a lot less than it's current stated book value/sh.

So I feed all this into my models, and I come up with the conclusion, that yes,
DDS is a value at current price. Somewhat confirming historically -- over the
past five years --, anyone who's bought at today's current price and held for a
while, has seen the stock move up -- and such a person has been able to get out
profitably if desired.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=DDS&t=5y

For me though, I stick with my view of the stock as being a glass
half-full/half empty situation where I take the half-empty (i.e. negative)
viewpoint. The stock has traded lower on it's book value, there's no evidence
the company can improve its paltry returns, forward p/e looks high, and a
takeover of the company/stock doesn't seem imminent. I'll put the stock on my
watch list for a better buy-in price.

----------------------------------
GOT. Yes, like several here, I follow GOT. GOT being a thread favorite in years
past when it was a net/net or near a net/net.
And recently again the stock has dropped substantially. Now again for me, it is
a value stock play at current price. And as with DDS, it's traded lower and
been a better value play. So I am guessing if I wait, I can get in at a lower
price.

-----------------------------

Fwiw, I have positions in these apparel retailers:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=ZQK+ROST+AEO+ANF+BEBE+LIZ+ABER+HBI+RCKY+KC
+SHOO+TJX+JWN+TLB+

I've been buying AEO at a couple of dollars lower. I purchased JWN (Nordstrom)
recently, not as a value stock, but rather because I believe the high-end
retail business will continue to do very well, even if we (USA) go into a
recession. I may add to a my few ABER (Harry Winston jewelers) if stock drops
under $35 again. I have a losing position in SHOO; reevaluating it now, and not
sure yet what I'll do. I like ROST here at current price (mentioned by you as
well on your website, I believe); I may up my position.

But wait!! There's more... (-g-)

I have varying amounts of these retailers too:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BIG,COST,NDN,CPWM,BBY,BBBY,TGT,HORT.PK,CULS,AVP,RA

I am not sure how you calculate "cash flow" for a banking institution. i think
it is nonsense to relay on cash flow (however that is calculated) for a banking
institution. If a bank indeed is floorishing and well managed it should show
negative cash flow, as it is i the business of lending money. For a bank i like
to look at PE, the risk in it's loan book. ROA, leverage, loan loss reserves
and other metrics none of which directly relates to cash flow.

In terms of most above metrics IRE and AIB looks cheap and well managed, IMO.

Madharry, for me from you, this is my learning once again:

If buying an insurance stock that's undervalued on its book value -- which is
the way many value investors look at insurance companies -- don't sell that
insurance stock just because it's moved up if it still is under book value.
(Especially if the book value is also rising.) Don't sell if it's under its
fair value - which should be and usually is, over 1.5x book value.

Be very cautious in selling one undervalued stock to buy something that looks
even more undervalued. Doing so provides two ways to err. Keep patience. Fight
anxiousness.

If the stock must be sold, do not exit all at once. Try to exit in stages. At
minimum, keep a stub position, at least for a while to see where the stock is
going.
=========================================
Just my opinion, and the way I want to play them. Not that I've been right on

For me, NWLIA was a buy in late 2002 when stock dropped on no particular reason
that I remember. I'm still holding those shares. ANAT too. My story: Buy under
bv, wait to sell above bv. Sometimes this works. Sometimes it does not.

CGI is the dominant auto insurer in Massachusetts. I've held a position for
many years, have sold it out recently. SAFT was a 2nd or 3rd in auto in Mass.,
not is well managed (imo) as CGI was (CGI also the AAA Club choice). Apparently
SAFT was attractive for their managers' expertise in managing SAFT's float
(junior Buffetts). Two things have happened: The hot-shot managers don't seem
to be getting press lately, don't seem to be doing so well or have become much
more conservative. Significantly, the Mass. auto market is opening up to
competition as state insurance rules are changing, and this has or will affect
the earnings of the locals - CGI, SAFT. This my understanding of the situation
anyway. I sold both, but reentered SAFT only because stock dropped below stated
bv.

One that's below stated bv that hasn't worked for me is CNO. It's dropped, and
I've added more recently.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=CNO

Others that might be looked at are ORI (p/bk =.94) with its very excellent
record of increasing dividends, and the GE spinoff GNW (p/bk =1.01 now). I have
shares of GNW and an exploratory few shares of ORI. I've been looking at PL
this weekend: I find its p/bk @1.23 relatively low (relative to its history),
but not quite so low as to hook me in.

While this method is simple - simplistic - for buying/selling insurance stocks,
it's not of course the only or maybe even best way to evaluate such stocks. I'm
attracted to low p/e insurance stocks: I have ZNT for example. I started a
small buy of BER on Friday. AFG's had a history of insider buying that's
eventually resulted in a stock price rise: After seeing recent insider buys at
AFG, I too have added to my position, hoping history repeats.

So value investors should invest in highly volatile speculative high fliers and
pretend that they are "value" investors? NFI has been very volatile, but that
is basically their business plan: to thrive when liquidity is loose and
property values are rising and then try an survive when property values
decline.

NFI is worthy of consideration based on price to book. Especially if one
expects a soft-landing in the current real estate debacle (because without a
soft landing they are toast IMO). Or as a short term play on a 50 bp fed cut.
Otherwise it is likely more of a value-trap than a value investment.

Value Investment Selection Criterion,

Pcyhuang, a large short position is an indication of a value trap to me instead
of a true value stock. Yes, sometimes the shorts are wrong and you do have
potential for a short squeeze, but I'd rather buy something with good long term
fundamentals and a large short interest is not indicative of that.

Further, I have found my best returns have occurred with stocks that are
unknown or not followed closely, not ones that are widely followed by
professional investors (and hated enough that they would short it --- do they
know something I don't, often the answer is yes).

I don't have any comments with respect to NFI, except that it is too risky for
me to consider either being long or short that one.

IRE - i like it too but not as much as AIB. I actually bought some this morning
but later sold and exchanged in more AIB after gleaning around more, the reason
being that I think AIB is more solid and much less dependent on Mortgages than
IRE (IRE has almost 50% of their loan book in mortgages compared to about 25%
for AIB).

I think both Irish IRE and AIB are oversold and very cheap, a country with 10%
savings rates should not go bankrupt and while there certainly will be some
problems with mortgages i doubt that the "median" Irishman is going to be a
deadbeat.
