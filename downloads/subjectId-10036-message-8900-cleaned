GPC vs. GRR and stock selection. Jim, I think they might be comparables. But
for me, not because of their business model similarities. Rather for how they
both trade relative to their dividend yield. I bought GRR last year for its
relatively high dividend yield and planned to sell when the yield dropped.
(-g-I've got another model that I use for long-established multi-billion dollar
companies where I can put some visual boundaries around the relationship of
price to dividend to the overall market yield.) Anyway, my model and
interpretation would show that a buy point for GPC would be about when the
dividend is around 2%. That'd mean a buy anywhere under $50/sh assuming the
current $1.04 dividend. I'd be in a losing situation now if I had followed that
model -g-. I have trouble even conceptualizing GPC @$50, let alone a buy point
there.

Sometimes though, the stocks in this model do take a while to work out. (For
example, I'm still holding JPM (1996 postings) for a target price - last time I
calculated- of $165). So, imo, a purchase of GPC now has to be undertaken with
some expectation that it may take several years for it to work out favorably.
That's why it might be a choice for a Mom account. Even if I assume my model is
outmoded or inaccurate or inappropriate, I believe GPC can trade once again on
a 3% yield (=$35/sh if div. is $1.04)

I'm starting a small position today.

ASIDE: I would like to say to the thread that I am NOT a person "who never met
a stock he didn't like." --g--. Even if I am buying a lot of different stocks
lately. It's just that in the kind of market we've had, given the amount of
thought that I've put into a stock like GPC, and given the ease of exit
(internet trading)--- I would rather be somewhat sure I'm correct about the
stock and be in it for a small amount, than risk time or opportunity by trying
to be 100% sure.

Maybe it's a matter of pain control. I'd rather lose a little money on GPC if
it doesn't work out, than have to whine and bemoan my stupidity because I was
lazy,scared,etc. and didn't buy the stock when I thought about it back in Nov.
'99 and it looked good (to me) at $26 but I just didn't act and now it's $36,
and how could I have been so wrong/stupid/etc or prejudiced against the co. not
to have bought even a little.

And while I don't expect a stock like GPC to make any kind of move soon
(there's no hurry to buy), I can buy it, monitor it, see how the situation and
my knowledge of it develop, and also still move on to something else. This same
idea carries through to Vulcan (VUL) another stock discussed here. An obviously
undervalued stock at current price that may take years to work out. I'm buying
a small amount to tuck into the value section of one of my portfolios.

Paul look at this one for me ,please.
http://biz.yahoo.com/p/e/elamf.html
Elamf is Mexican and has absolutely no following. They recently completed a
reasonable acquisition. Without debt, well run and improving prospects and ROE
of about 6 and p/b of .5 they are undervalued. Should be about p/b no less than
.8 which gives the stock a 60 % upside in the next year. How do you see the
valuation? I have been patient with this one and recently added to my position.

Allen, sigh, yes ELAMF. A big disappointment to all of us (I would guess)
who've looked, bought, and held. And I'm in there too with a full position. I
surely thought with the contract manufacturing boom, and it's so explosive it
seems - that a contract manufacturer in Mexico, one of the largest employers in
Mexico, involved in business relationships with GE, would participate.
Certainly not experience declining sales.

Stock is selling about $3 1/2.
You call the min value at about .8xbook or about $7/sh. (I'm using Yahoo bv
number.) I'm figuring about .7 book or a bit under $6/sh. If they could up
their profit margin and ROE, I'd upgrade my estimate.

I was surprised once before how quickly this stock moved. If I recall correctly
it once went from 7 to 11 or more in about 2 or 3 days (with no published info
or rumors). I wouldn't be surprised to see the same thing happen again - a
doubling to 7 in just a couple of trading sessions. Now if we could just get to
those sessions -g-.

Yeah, I skimmed the Buffett article. Not sure if it's worth reading. I'm not a
fan- sharp, rich, and correct as he may be. Scared people with another of his
Fortune missive's in late '70's maybe. Something about stocks weren't a good
investment because interest rates were so high. Maybe scared people out of auto
stocks stocks in early '80's with same auto comment then as now. Too bad, Ford
and GM were good buys at the price then. I'll take a Cramer expression: "Can
the man make you money?" I say no (unless you buy Berkshire). He does great
though for himself. And for followers into Berkshire too, I guess.

About his stocks: imo, seems like just what you might expect from a genius --
following him is not possible; anticipating him is not possible. About his
macro views, maybe he's right, maybe he's not. Maybe, given enough time, he's
both wrong and right.

Here is a "message" posted in 1932, at the depths of the depression, by one Ben
Graham. It absolutely fascinates me.

<<In recent years financial writers have been unanimous in pointing out how
unimportant are asset values as compared with earning power; but no one seems
to have realized that both the ignoring of assets and the emphasis on earning
can be - and have been - carried too far, with results of the most disastrous
kind.

The whole New Era and blue chip madness is derived from this exclusive
preoccupation with the earnings trend. A mere $1 increase in profits, from $4
to $5 per share, raised the value of a stock from $40 to $75, on the joyous
assumption that an upward trend had been established which justified a multiple
of 15 instead of 10. The basis of calculating values thus became arbitrary and
mainly psychological, with the result that everyone felt free to gamble
unrestrainedly under the respectable title of "investment".

It was this enticement of investors into rampant speculation which made
possible the unexampled duration and extent of the 1928-1929 advance, which
also made the ensuing collapse correspondingly disastrous, and which - as later
appeared - carried the business structure down into ruin with the stock
market.>>

And to put us in the environment he was in when he wrote this, the Dow was down
about 80% from its peak, and as Graham wrote:

<< More than one-third of all industrial stocks are selling in the open market
for less than the companies' net quick assets.

Scores of common stocks are selling for less than their pro rata of cash in the
company's treasury.>>

This can't happen today, right? Wrong. This kind of sounds like the Japanese
market last year. Mostly concentrated in the small cap arena. Now that there is
a whiff of recovery, Fidelity's Japan Small Cap Fun has more than TRIPLED this
year. Oh, but this couldn't happen in the U.S. market. Japan at the peak in
1989 was hardly considered some financial backwater, nor was it considered so
last year when it was not hard to find Japanese companies trading for less than
the cash on their balance sheets. And there were a million reasons not to buy
them.

Blair Corporation. Symbol BL. A gem of a net-net.

No one has mentioned BL yet. It's trading below Net-Net value similar to others
mentioned on this thread, but I would say that it has higher quality assets. I
think we can see the white's of their eyes. I am glad I did not find it earlier
because I would have pulled the trigger at a higher price.

They do mail order, catalog and internet sales. Mainly inexpensive clothes and
stuff. They have a couple of outlet stores and retail stores in order to dump
excess inventory, they say. Earnings are down a bit this year and the
explanation is not well communicated. It sounds like they expanded the number
of catalogues, mailings and inventory, but sales increases did not materialize.
With flat sales, margins dropped. But the company does not clearly point this
out to stockholders. And earnings are not as bad as they look. They're making
money!!

Profile http://biz.yahoo.com/p/b/bl.html
Internet catalogs. http://www.catalogcity.com/viewshop.cfm Very slow response -
beware.

NET-NET CALCULATION:

** BL has not published a balance sheet for Q3. Income stmt for Q3 was a loss
of (.08) per share. The Bal sheet data used here is June 30 from 10Q. So
subtract .08 per share from these numbers for the Q3 loss.

Let's compare BL with the other netnets recently mentioned. My numbers may be
off, but here's my calculation of Price/Net-Net:

MPP 88%
EBSC 79%
MAXS 90%
BL 72% i.e. trading at 72% of net net

Are the assets any good:
(1) AR $150 million (at $112 revenue/qtr = 1.34 qtrs = 120 days) Not great.
$35 million doubtful reserve 35/185 = 19% reserved

(2) Inventory $84 million (at $57 COGS/qtr = 1.5 qtrs = 132 days) Not great
here either.

Summary:
$260 Current Assets
(89) Liab
-----
170 netnet (/8.25 shares) = $20.7 per share
+47 PPE (LT asset)
----
217 Net Tangible Assets = $26.42 per share
+1 intangible assets
-----
218 OE = $26.42 per share

$14.50 Stock Price

Hmmm. Let's adjust the assets. Let's take another $30 million AR reserve.
That's 20% more of the net $150 AR. $170 netnet - 20 = 150 netnet assets -->
$18 per share adjusted. Not bad.

http://www.blair.com/announce5.html
Not much detail, but notice that last year had favorable .31 for insurance.
From 10K

From the 10K describing the NRE adjustments taken in the year:
"Quarter ended September 30, 1998 includes non-taxable insurance proceeds of
$2.8 million ($.31 per share). Quarter ended December 31, 1998 includes
additional net income of $2.7 million ($.31 per share) due to reductions in the
provisions for doubtful accounts and returns resulting from improved bad debt
and returns experience. "

Quarterly Earnings and Sales
http://yahoo.marketguide.com/mgi/highlights/1209A.html

Comps
http://yahoo.marketguide.com/mgi/ratio/1209A.html

Here's financial history from the company
http://www.blair.com/html/financ.html

They do not communicate exceptionally well. They do not break out NRE from
recurring items. Comments and outlook and plans are nonexistant. Also, there
are no analysts covering the company.

My take on EPS:
EPS was $2.49 in 1998, but .62 was due to the insurance proceeds and reduction
in doubtful reserves. Let's adjust the EPS down.
1997 $1.45
1998 $2.49 less (.62) = $1.87 adjusted for insurance gain and reserve
reductions.
1999 YTD is $0.79 But this includes a $1.6 million inventory pre tax write down
this qtr. (.13)

So perhaps adjust 1999 by $1.07 million after tax (= $0.13 per share after
tax). (I would certainly argue that inventory adjustments are a normal part of
business and that we should not adjust them out of the picture. But to
understand this qtr, I think we need to. Perhaps the adjustments could have
occurred in an earlier qtr or perhaps they should have been recognized ongoing
a bit every month???) So the Q3-99 just completed would have been .07 profit, I
figure, without the inventory write-down.

For full year 1999 EPS: My guess is that we get a bit less EPS this year than
last. Q4 1998 was .79. But we should subtract .31 for reserves which helped
Q4-98 (as mentioned above). So .48 is the adjusted Q4-98 EPS. Perhaps .40 to
.45 this year in Q4?? (I have not talked to the company yet for guidance help.
I have a call in to them.) With that number for the QTR, full year 1999EPS (my
guess) = .79 YTD + .13 inventory(?) + .43 Q4 = $1.35 EPS for 1999 (adjusted to
remove onetime inventory hit in Q3). $1.22 including the inventory write-down.

So earnings look to some people as going from 2.49 down to 1.22. When perhaps
1.87 down to 1.35 range might be apples and apples. A 28% drop. Ouch. But still
profitable. And at $14.50 / 1.35 the PE is 11, but Earnings are dropping
year-to-year.

Some tidbits from the SEC documents --

(a) Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased to 51.5% in the
second quarter of 1999 from 48.3% in the second quarter of 1998. Cost of goods
sold has been negatively impacted by the sale of excess inventory and by
increased shipping costs. Excess inventory has resulted from the Company's
adjustment to a larger catalog operation and lower than expected response in
the fourth quarter of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999.

(b) While customer accounts receivable have changed little, inventory levels,
though greatly improved, have averaged significantly higher in 1999 than in
1998.

(c) Net sales for the first half of 1999 were 5.3% higher than net sales for
the first half of 1998. Overall, response rates were approximately the same in
the first six months of 1999 and 1998. Gross sales revenue generated per
advertising dollar decreased 8%. The total number of orders shipped decreased
while the average order size increased. The returns percentage improved in the
first six months of 1999 as compared to the first six months of 1998 primarily
due to a change in return policy. The Company stopped refunding shipping and
handling charges on returns during the first quarter of 1998. This policy
change reduces returns by approximately 10%...

(d) Merchandise inventory turnover was 2.3 at June 30, 1999, 2.4 at December
31, 1998 and 2.6 at June 30, 1998. Merchandise inventory as of June 30, 1999
decreased 28% from December 31, 1998 and increased 2% from June 30, 1998.
Inventory levels have been impacted by the transition to a larger catalog
operation, by the continuing effort to improve customer service, by lower than
expected response in the fourth quarter of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999
and, most recently, by increased efforts to move excess inventory.

(e) Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment totaled $1,317,911
during the
first half of 1999 and $652,195 during the first half of 1998. Capital
expenditures for 1999, 2000, and 2001 are projected to be approximately
$5,000,000 a year in order to support the Company's marketing strategy. The
increased capital expenditures will result primarily from developing our own
internet commerce site, from maintaining a higher inventory level and from
expanding database capabilities.

(f) The Company recently declared a quarterly dividend of $.15 per share
payable on September 15, 1999. It is the Company's intent to continue paying
dividends

(g) The Company has, from the fourth quarter of 1996 through the third quarter
of 1998, repurchased on the open market 544,739 shares of its Common Stock. In
1999, the Company has repurchased 756,220 shares (500,000 in January, 100,000
in April and 156,220 in May) of its Common Stock from the Estate of John L.
Blair.

(h) Future cash needs will be financed by cash flow from operations

Help. What am I missing? Why are they trading so low? Will the internet put
them out of business? Or will they participate and prosper? That's probably the
issue. They have capital spending plans for internet and I bet they talk about
it every day. The balance sheet could support the effort. Hopefully AMZN will
leave something for Blair to sell. Maybe the story is like DLIA. Worry, worry,
worry... Or maybe Blair become very successful. Maybe the stock just returns to
Net Tangible Asset Value!!

I once read that you should not buy until you understand the seller. And you
cannot just say "he's a dumbshit". Who's selling? According to this:
http://yahoo.marketguide.com/mgi/performance/1209A.html
(a) Shorts are selling. Small potatoes however. Short int 10/8 21,000 shares.
(b) Institutions are selling. Net 229,000 shares in 3 mos 7/8/99 to 10/8/99
(c) Insiders are not active. Why not?

Ave daily volume 13,500 shares. There was a bit of volume last August which
might have been Institutional selling. 4 days with around 480,000 total volume.
(Isn't the reported volume really doubled up for one seller and one buyer?) So
is that 240,000 shares bought and sold?)

So why are they selling? Other than internet risk. One might argue that since
the company communicates poorly and no analysts cover the company -- that
individuals might act irrationally. But institutions usually are not dumb. Is
the only argument available here that this company is not widely followed buy
the brightest of institutions? We need to figure this one out. Or is this the
reason...

More on BL.

I chatted with the IR person -- the treasurer.

The company was an envelope marketeer until they developed the catalog business
4-6 years ago. They would do direct mailings and newspaper inserts. That part
of the business represents 1/3 of sales and catalog part is 2/3 now.

They also expanded their credit operation in 95-96 and extended credit to
customers. Earnings suffered and they since strengthened the in-house credit
operation.

He speculated that perhaps the catalog transition and the credit problems is
causing the stock to trade below BV. Maybe, but the stock has recently dropped
and these "problems" are older.

And the issue of transition to catalog is not an problem, in my view. He says
they got into catalog business because the mailing biz was dropping. Now
catalog revenue is 2/3 of total. He says credit is under control as evidenced
that they could reduce the reserve last december. So it is good that they moved
to catalog sales and good that they are moving to internet. They issue credit
because their customers need it. The ship on credit and invoice the customer.
Their customers are low-end to mid-range ecomomic level, he says.

I asked how internet would reach those folks. He said a lot of customers are
over 65 years old and a lot are on the net.

I asked for guidance for next qtr. He would not provide any. Said that sales
were strong and should be higher than a year ago. I asked if margins would be
down and got an inconclusive answer. Was told that the clearing out of excess
inventory is not complete and should not affect Q4. No guidance.

This last qtr they signed a contract for website development. Are now on
catalogcity, and you could see from my prior post. They will have their own
site and may or may not remain at ccity. Expect mid-year rollout, next year.

Supply. Direct overseas sources around 25-30%. Other sources manufacture over
there, but their source is domestic. Sounds like quite a few supply sources and
no issues here.

He spent some time describing the differences between the 2 businesses --
catalog and mail. They do printing in house for mailings but catalogs are
produced outside. Longer lead times for catalogs. Can experiment more with
mailings. More inventory required for catalog. Etc...

Hope this helps,

Tennessee Wildlife resources Agency Agent Joe Drunin said no one was injured in
the crash, but both vessels sustained damage. Durnin estimated eight people
were on board each boat when the collision occurred near Alcoa Highway's J.E.
"Buck" Karnes Bridge.
The occupants of both vessels had attended the Universtiy of Tennessee-Notre
Dame football game as part of a group of boaters dubbed the Vol Navy, Durnin
said.
The game had ended shortly before the collision.
Cynthia Moxley, a family spokeswoman, said Sunday that the damage to both boats
was minor, that no one was thrown from either boat and that Clayton has
contacted the other boat owner to discuss paying for damages.>>

I bought some LR today. Lanier World Wide has all the attributes of a
successful spin-out. It's been in business as an office machine company HQ'ed
in Atlanta since 1934. Operated as a division of Harris since 1983. It has an
identifiable brand name and continuity of management. The Form 10 shows annual
revenue of $1.4 with after tax profit of $44 million. They've been saddled with
$500 million of debt as part of the spinout. Half their business is
international. They represent good products - "best of breed"; they have high
quality longterm clients - MMM, Kinko's, Abbott Labs, NASA.

90% of the stock spun off to current shareholders. HRS holding 10%. Started
trading on a when issued basis at $6 last week. Formal trading began yesterday
on NYSE. Currently selling in the $3 range. All sorts of structural reasons for
Funds to sell. None to buy. Recent history of Danka and IKON sobering. XRX
languishing.

So here's a growing business system company selling at a PE of 6. Only missing

The negative is that Accounts Receivable has ballooned due to illegal

After seeing your post on LR I went through the prospectus today and decided
that, like Ikon, I just don't understand the financials nor the business. But
half of value investing is knowing where to look, and spinoffs like this are
fertile ground. You may have something big here, but it just didn't jump out at
me. Low margin, weak balance sheet, lots of weird financial assets on the
balance sheet.

Thanks for your response on LR. I'm curious about your reference to <<lots of
weird financial assets on the balance sheet.>> Do you recall what struck you as
weird?

Several years ago the owner of a business machine outlet in Chicago that had
been rolled up by IKON explained some of the economics to me. Aside from the
outsourcing of various document functionalities, he made a big point of
demonstrating that the copier business had gone from analog to digital in a
modular form such as: scanner->server->printer. Lanier historically has offered
products in the dictation area. That now becomes machine based language
technology including direct dictation and translation. Lanier becomes a
solution provider with the ability to choose the most effective combination of
hardware and software. My read of the prospectus is Lanier is in that
transition from analog to digital, but is meanwhile profitable.

I expected the market to price LR at $5-10. At $3, it's worth a gamble to see
some quarterlies, and fold if strategic focus doesn't sharpen.

The balance sheet is weird to me, but it seems you understand it - I readily
admit that I don't, and that is why I am not buying the stock. I think the odds
of you making money in it are quite high. As I said before (and as you alluded
to in your first post), the percentages are with you on a stock in this
situation even if you just took a blind leap. You understand the business, so
the odds should be even better if you apply your understanding of the business
to the valuation. I spent about an hour on it today and concluded that for me
it would be a blind leap, and I don't do blind leaps under any circumstances.

(OT) A growth stock PLT

I posted here last April of APCC. Which was then at $13+ and is now at $23 (I
just sold - one of my very few good investments). A few people commented
favorably here so I will post another allmon type growth stock which I just
moved my $$ to.

PLT - Plantronics
PE 18
Sales Growth (3 & 5 yr) 16%
EPS growth 3 yr 28%
CA/CL = 120/43 = 2.8
No Debt

They have 50% of the telephone headset market. LU largest customer. The company
issued a press release in Aug stating FY2000 EPS (ending 4-1-00) will be
$3.55-$3.70, or 18% - 23% above FY99.

I expect continued xx% growth with advances and acceptance of computer voice
recognition. Solid company. Stock price considerably off it's high, like APCC
was last April.

Hey, Grommit - your pickup of APCC was well timed. If you think about it, it
probably got a little boost from Y2K. I just purchased a back-UPS because a
good friend of mine's computer was totally fried by a lightning strike.
On another note, talked with another friend of mine this AM who owns a
restaurant. He is mandated to install a chlorinator on his well system. The
inspector who looked at his system said "these are being installed everywhere,
I wish I had stock in the company that makes them..." Well, you know what I

do further DD on this.

Ben Graham on market valuation, 1959:

"The record shows that declines have tended to be roughly proportional to the
previous advances..."

Experience gives us another measure of the possible bear-market decline. This
measure is based on the principle that the higher the market advance above a
computed normal, the further it is likely to decline below such normal..."

[Graham's calculation of the "normal" today would probably be about 4000 on the
Dow, maybe lower, given my reading of his writings. My own financial
calculation of the "normal" is about 6000. Sounds crazy, right? Read the next
Graham passage, and then tell me how crazy that sounds, given that I may be
what he calls "the most conservative observer".]

"There is a paradox in this economic law which makes it virtually impossible
for it to find acceptance in practice. For the almost universal optimism that
accompanies the great advances in the stock market precludes even the most
conservative observer from imagining a decline so drastic as these figures
illustrate."

The keynote of course is optimism. We are enthusiastic about business prospects
for the next decade...Hedodotus recounts a sayng of Solon the Wise that rich
King Croesus sadly recalled before his execution - namely, that no man's life
should be accounted a happy one until it is over. Perhaps the more prudent time
to characterize the 1960s [the following decade] would be when they are over
rather than when they have just begun."

[And what did Ben Graham think was ominous? He pointed out three market levels
that had proven to be peaks, one of them an historical catastrophe that shaped
his thinking forever.]

1929 High P/E 19.4 Yield 3.2% Bond Yield 5%
1937 High P/E 17.3 Yield 4.2% Bond Yield 2%
1946 High P/E 15.9 Yield 3.6% Bond Yield 3%

Today P/E ~27 Yield ~1.3% Bond Yield 6%

I'm sure Graham was called irrelevant in 1970 just like he is today. But the
market P/E fell below 10 even in those "modern" times. Call me paranoid, but
this stuff concerns me, to put it lightly. Warren Buffett obliquely said the
same thing in Fortune magazine last week and nobody seems to have paid any
attention to him. If you study your history, you will find that Buffett makes
market calls only when things are at an absolute extreme. I count three in his
entire career. 1) Liquidating his partnership in 1969. He was a few years
early, but absolutely right. 2) Buying like crazy in 1974 - that was when he
said "I feel like an oversexed man in a whorehouse" and "this it the time to
get rich". and 3) Now. He's been telling us with increasing conviction for the
last three years that he is concerned. I have never seen it laid out so
compellingly as in the Fortune article.

Does this tell me to sell everything? Graham faced a similar question in the
early 1970s when he saw the two-tiered market we see today. He said focus on
the stocks themselves and what they're worth if the indices reflect the first
tier of the market and you can fish in that second tier. I have pruned my
portfolio down to net-nets and stocks that I have total conviction that their
value is 50% north of where they are trading, plus a good deal of cash. But
other portfolios I manage demand to be in "institutional quality" investments.
Be careful what you wish for, because you might get it. "Institutional quality"
has always turned out to be an oxymoron in the end.

I don't know when its going to happen, but I know its going to happen. I'd like
to think that if I own real absolute value stocks it won't matter if the big
indexes drop 50%. But that might be wishful thinking.

This is not "Jim's semiannual market call" - it is only reiterating the one I
made in August. I am still very very bearish - and the more speculative the
market gets (this week was truly scary), the more bearish I get.

Graham quotes from The Rediscovered Benjamin Graham, edited by Janet Lowe. The
book is great. If you can get one of Amazon's coupons, please order it from
them - I'm short the stock. Add a few bucks to their losses for me.

On the subject of restaurants, What does everyone think of Avado Brands (AVDO)?
Mike and Paul are already aware of it, as I've posted on the Arbitrage thread
about it. Management led Buyout offer of $7.25 cash on the table (certainly not
a "for sure"), stock trading at about $5.50, so you could make about 31% if the
deal goes through as currently structured.
Wisconsin (state?) group which owns a ton of shares, and is buying more, is
raising a stink saying the offer is way too low (IMHO, they are probably right,
and mgmt. led group is trying to steal the company).
Raymond James analyst pegs value of the company at between the offer and mid
nines (I'll get exact figures on Monday). So let's say a compromise is reached
(there is a "special committee" in place) of 8-8.50, that's a pretty handsome
return, even if you have to wait around until second calendar Q next year. I'm
using my experience with SSI as a guide.

I am curious about your last statement " it is return on total equity that

willing to accept a lower return on the purchase price if it is backed by a
large book value of marketable securities.

My concern is what taxes are payable upon disposition of the nice portfolio of
marketable securities, because to my knowledge there is no way to distribute
that portfolio without paying taxes on it. Somewhere I read that corporations
do not pay long term capital gains the way individuals do. so presumably one
has to discount the value of the portfolio by about 30% for taxes. Then the
question becomes what will unlock the value for shareholders. Is there any
likelihood that the company will be sold in the near future or grow through
acquistions?

fall wipes out a 100% gain. And if you don't think any of these scenarios are
possible, well, all it takes now is a mid-high single digit PE on the S&P 500
(something that seems to recur through history) to create a 80% loss. Got any
clue what that wipes out? (hint: everything) Don't even get me started on the

according to his research. He of course advocates raising cash or adjusting to

Bill Miller's been long Amazon and hence pounding the table in the press (as he
did for Bank One, Waste Management, McKesson - he stopped pounding as they got
hacked to bits after his big buys) for a while now. He had a reputation for not
hyping his positions, and now that he's made a name for himself he is clearly
taking it upon himself to spread the word about the positions he takes. Now, he
has a reputation for hyping his positions. Or at least in my mind.

Now, for the article. First, realize that he is now actually writing the
article in Barron's rather than being quoted. Christ. The SEC should almost be
called in (yeah, I know, he acknowledges his big position). Second, he calls
himself a value investor, when in fact he is starting a second fund that will
allow him to invest in growth stocks unhindered by the value moniker.

Third, he says reward is commensurate with risk. So he basically abandons value
investing implicitly right there. One can just about write off the whole
article.

Fourth, he takes supranormal historic return as proof that stocks were
undervalued, and then takes it as proof that they could have been proven
undervalued before the supranormal returns took place. When even he admits he
couldn't see it in Cisco.

He then takes a long-winded approach to justifying playing the lottery. And he
uses this to justify Amazon.com. After all, you can only lose your entire
investment! He believes he'll win, but then admits there are two variables
here: his opinion of AMZN's future AND his risk threshold.

My opinion: Bill Miller is coming to the market rather than letting it come to
him. He has elevated his risk threshold in order to continue his streak of
beating the S&P 500. And he's fooled himself into thinking it's all logical.

Re: Amazon.com, the real premise that many bulls have is that it can turn a
huge profit in an instant if it just stopped marketing so hard. I say a) no,
they wouldn't be profitable if they stopped marketing so hard - just look at
the P&L and b) they need the marketing anyway when someone can just point and
click somewhere else.

Another point of mine: On my Explorer browser, I have this neat thing called
Favorites. In Netscape, they're called Bookmarks. That my friends is the mall
of the future. I'll go to the cheapest site for toys, the cheapest for
electronics, the cheapest for books...and the mall will be right there
programmed into my browser, not all at one site. Why AMZN is spending so
voracioiusly to become the web mall when everyone can just as easily create a
web mall on their browser is beyond me.

Someone stated that although the difference between the exercise price of an
option and the market price at the time of purchase is not charged to income
for accounting purposes, for tax purposes the company can record that
difference as an expense and deduct it from its taxes, thus the company
increases its cash flow from having options exercised by significantly more
than the option price. For example Smith has options for 5000 shares at $1.
Market price is $10. Company can deduct as an expense 5000X(10-1) or $45,0000
when Smith exrcises his option and buys the stock.Can someone confirm this?

http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=ELTX&d=5y

Based on my view of this non-value company, I believe the stock is in the early
stages of a major move out of a 3+ year consolidation. The fact that this
recent move (and other similar moves) has occurred while the Dow has not made
major advances leaves me with some small hope that this could be a harbinger
that smaller company stocks generally might be able to make good headway after

Responding to a message from a while ago. REITS are peaking my interest in what

At any rate, I have owned LHO off and on before stumbling on FCH. It would seem
that FCH has lower leverage and yet, I know that LHO seems preferred on this

much larger, is trying to rebrand (upscale) some of their properties. Some
question if they will be successful.
If, as you say, you want a comparison for your education, I defer to others who
can better detail financial or other aspects. If you want a comparison so as to
pick out the best value, that's not possible by me. For those willing to invest
in the hotel reit business I don't see it as an either/or choice. I have
positions in both. Have no opinion on your HRP.

I continue to hold my position in CTZ which I added to after the merger
announcement.

I've been too slow to add to my small position in TOY in the past few weeks. I
see TOY, selling near historical lows (not today though -g-), close to book
value, with okay relative p/sales, possibly and likely transferring its
building capital $$ to internet investments, unfavorably viewed by many (being
squeezed by Wal-Mart and Target and E-toys, maybe also kb.com)-- as a value
stock for me.

Hi Jim. Taking a little profit in SLOT. Transferring funds to J.

To me, business prospects for Anchor Gaming (SLOT) look so much better than for
Jackpot Enterprises (J). Anchor Gaming seems to have a future with their
programming, casinos, lottery biz. Jackpot, being a route servicer primarily,
is dull and apparently in a very no-growth business.

However, J's market cap ($72.7M) is almost equal to its cash/short-term
investments ($67.7M). Here again then is the real risk that the money which
management will invest, will be invested poorly. Stock near its stated book
value. There's no LTD. Company is generally profitable, and stock usually sells
for higher psr and p/e than currently. Looks like J might be a possibility for
value investors.

Made a big investment today in MRVC. Similar value play to ORTL. Company is
developing several divisions for future IPOs, but most interesting is a
Fiber-OPtic play called new access. Partners in this venture are Kleiner
Perkins and Juniper Networks- Although no official release on this from MRVC.
website of New Access lists strong management. IF any of you have an interest
in this suggest you check the SI thread on MRVC which is excellent. Also in
light of the CHina news I purchased a smaller interest for the first time in
MMG, which has telecommunication interests in Russia, Eastern Europe and China.
The company was getting lots of grief from the CHinese government about its
interests there, hence I believe this is an undervalued play, received detailed
writeup in Barrons awhile back and now a china catalyst may move the stock up
significantly. News COrp now has a 10% interest, and may will be a future
acquirer. Comments?

Have you looked at International Multifoods (IMC) as an investment lately. I

Didn't J (Jackpot) blow the cash to take over Players Club a year ago? Did that
deal fall through? I looked at J two or three years ago and almost bought it
for the large cash balance. Looking at the chart, good thing I didn't. I don't
think SLOT is the right sell, though. Prospects are getting better, and they
have a few aces up their sleeve. The stock remains cheap - when I bought it in

I originally bought LMVTX in 1996 as my first investment freshman year of
college. It has performed well for me, and I actually have withdrawn 52% of my
principle investment. I have been questioning for so many months what the heck
Miller is doing, particularly with AOL. Perhaps it is time to take the rest off
the table. It is hard to do though for something that has performed so well.

At my age of course, I also do not really have enough assets to make a
diversified portfolio with stocks of my own choosing (without incurring large
trading costs percentage wise).

I bought LMVTX because I liked the original top ten holdings at that time,
particularly Dell computer. Managers do not typically outperform for more than
a decade and Miller's performance has been driven by two stocks in particular:
Dell and AOL. Furthermore, it seems that of all the mutual fund managers,
statistically you will have 0 to 3 that will outperform the market every year
for 10 years. Lynch was one, now Miller is one. And Buffett is the best
investor because he knows the financials of every company on the NYSE in his
head. Lets say Buffett's knowledge is equal to ABCD. Four analysts of lesser
knowledge may have A, B, C, and D. But collectively in group discussion I don't
think they could come to better conclusions than Buffett on his own. Besides,
you have to multiply ABCD by E (Munger) :)

Armin,re MRVC, MMG. Congratulations on MRVC. Another excellent call. I don't
know how you do it. You seem to get results - stock increases or stock
breakouts- almost immediately. I'll give you that MRVC is a "similar value play
to ORTEL" -g-. I couldn't see ORTEL, and I can't even figure out what MRVC
does, what their customers do with MRVC stuff, or why it's important. And
forget about the financial yardsticks. BUT... based on your record here (imo),
it could be (or was) an excellent gamble for someone who's in the mood and
willing to take a flyer on the craze for fiber optics thingamajiggers.

I vaguely remember the MMG write up. A mishmash company I recall. What
investors are betting (imo, and if I recall) is that mogul John Kluge, who runs
it, can work his magic on the (wireless tele?) licenses he's assembled in
Eastern Europe (primarily) and China. It could actually be a value stock if
someone were able to analyze the business. Plus the political risks. I could
never figure even the US cable companies, but it "seems" now that if you just
went in early or at a low enough price, you eventually made out okay. Same here
I think. I defer to your expertise/luck/skill/knowledge/intuition/guts in all

I got a little lucky with MRVC they released news about new fibre channel
products yesterday. SOmething I was unaware of. However, MRVC has announced
their intention to be an incubator of high tech businesses and then bring them
public. Now that is a significant shift in the way they do their business and
is of additional value to shareholder above the value they are creating by
developing new business and just running them as divisions.
MMG I have been following for a couple of years but never purchased. I sense a
significant undervaluation there. I think the stock went public around 9-10
years ago and of that cheapskate Kluge has a controlling stake which means that
they did not overpay for their assets. The had a big merger with a russian
company controlled by Newscorp so now Newscorp owns 10%. It seems that with
China allowing increased equity positions in their telecom operations it should
make MMG's interests there much more valuavle. The also have ongoing
discussions with the Chinese regarding two operations that the Chinese have
terminated. I hope their cause wil be helped there too. This may be a long term
play. But then again I thought that would be true of Comcast.

Adding a little today to my long held position in Block Drug (BLOCA).

A company I can't really recommend. They buy up old brands (Polident, Lava
soap, etc.) and try to rejuvenate them. Also, they're in the business of
supplying products to dentists. They are very much family controlled and imo,
investors here experience all the problems inherent with such a setup.
Especially as many investors (I suspect) question the
energy/skill/priorities/abilities of that family. Plus, the stock itself is
very thinly traded with a large bid-ask spread.

Buying the stock here, what you get - besides very slow sales growth and no
per-share earnings growth, is a 4% (approx) dividend yield, an occasional 3%
stock dividend, a stock selling near stated book value and at a three-year low,
and as a potential kicker, a substantial interest in a company which has an
"innovative new treatment for periodontal disease". (A disease, if you are over
age 35, you maybe know about.)

I look for a 50% appreciation within 2 years. Saw it before. Maybe this next

the stock.

CLST -- Take a look. Distributor of cell phones along with CELL. (Cell had
problems overextending internationally but is recovering.) CLST looks like a
better buy to me. A big gain today for CLST prob due to 1/3 of revenue is
China. In last qtr earnings press release CLST stated:

According to First Call at the time of the publication of this release, the
range of the analysts' estimates for the fourth quarter was $0.33 to $0.37 in
net income per diluted share, apart from non-recurring gains or charges. These
estimates were based on revenue estimates ranging from approximately $725
million to $850 million. The Company believes its fourth quarter performance
will be within these ranges, barring negative factors beyond its control.

Consequently, CellStar currently expects to report record revenues and earnings
per share for both the quarter and year ended November 30, 1999; and expects to
carry strong growth and earnings momentum into fiscal 2000, when the Company
also expects to report another record year.

Catellus shares rose 1 3/8 to 13 5/16.

A spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based company declined to comment. So did a
spokesman for Memphis, Tennessee-based Southeastern.

Catellus holds income-producing properties and undeveloped land, and develops,

Welcome, Crow. Re: MOGA. Well, I just focused on it for a couple of minutes and
I'll offer up an opinion. Just my opinion - I'm no expert analyst and I have no
business knowledge of Moog (although I know they used to work some joint
projects with Allied Signal - a very good sign imo.) And we all have our ways
of analyzing and looking at things. With my ways, I've been wrong many, many
times before.

MOGA could be a value stock. First though, you'll want to recheck your numbers
(esp. if they came from Yahoo. Yahoo as I've sadly learned, does not treat
multiple classes of stock properly.) Try this:

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=moga&B1=Enter

In the past five years, Moog performance seems to have really improved. Maybe
they can continue that growth or sustain it. The stock has sold, imo, at
relatively higher avg. p/e's, psr's, and p/book values. So it seems possible,
maybe even reasonable to assume it will do so again. (I often invest where I
believe beaten down stocks will revert to their mean numbers.) On the other
hand, in those early years, the stock also sold for lower psr's, lower p/book
(but not lower avg. p/e). So if something negative does happen to the business
(perhaps it is a cyclical business after all), it's easy for me to have an
opinion that the stock could come down further.

ROE has been increasing over the past several years. It currently stands at
about 12%. Not so terribly exciting given that the price of the stock is about
at book value.

I don't see a margin of safety. (Again, that's my opinion after a quick look.)
There's no dividend. Not much insider buying that I can tell. Nothing to
comfort the investor if the stock slide continues.
For me, I'd monitor MOGA and see if I could get a better (lower) entry price.
Meanwhile, there are better value buys out there (imo).

All just my opinion; I defer to anyone who really knows something, and if Moog
receives a buyout offer tomorrow at $30 because it's a perfect fit for some
company's strategic plan, you can laugh at me on your way to the bank.

Thanks for looking at it....and helpful site.
And I am reviewing Moog's number and SEC stuff.
Two things quickly ---1. I accidently found a somewhat answer
or reasons why good companies have share prices that are low
or below the market. I was cleaning 'house' and found Stocks and Commodities
Dec98 lying around and naturally opened it and found 'Bollinger Group
Power'pg94. The second paragraph reads:
Academic studies have long differentiated between return and risk due to the
market versus those due to company capabilities. Analyst John Bollinger's
review of such studies places the return from stocks even more precisely:
50% is from industry group. He assigns the remaining return to the market at
about 30%, and the stock itself at 20%

The rest of this short article explains his methods (more precise industry
groups and the Bollinger bands) which lead me to one of his web sites
www.equitytrader.com... its new to me but I'm responding to your thoughtful
look.

Will look closer and report back Bollinger has an interesting graph with
several choices that I must try.
Then I will plug in 2 more choices- IBM and URS.

2. I may know the answer rather quickly-- Boeing just won a major missile
contract and may trickle to Moog or other companies that are contractors to
Boeing...

Don't worry....[your ways]I believe I have been MORE wrong and many more times
but will get better.
And will read previous post to get to speed so if I don't respond for a while
its because I have some homework to do.

Wallace, you state a valid concern. That's why I would (and do) diversify among
regions as well as between commercial and apartment.

These reits all make me suspicious. Been in too many situations where things go
okay for a long time -- good/very good div. $ year after year, not much stock
volatility -- then something happens and suddenly, the cumulative dividends are
essentially wiped out as the stock is halved or quartered or worse. I've just
extracted myself from a health care REIT which provided me with such
performance.

I found ARI by happenstance. I can't say it's the best REIT value out there, or
the best commercial reit or even the best S. Calif. reit. Since this r.e. is so
location specific, I can't readily compare it with other "similar" reits - say,
BXP (Boston) or SLG (NYC). Anyway, I follow ARI, and I like it at current
price.

I'm also a fan of Mills (MLS), a "destination" outlet mall. I believe I'm the

ABS - Albertsons.

I recently bought ABS. On the bottom, I hope. Some under $34, but most near

We gotta have groceries. Steady and predictable revenue and EPS is why I've
read that the grocery stores typically command a premium PE multiple. Well,
that premium is gone. ABS is trading at growth rate.

Some are concerned that super stores will take over the grocery side of things.
The Wal-Mart fear. Other see internet groceries taking a significant bite of
the groceries. The AMZN fear.

Wall street journal 11-8 had feature on internet groceries. Noted that WBVN
expects sales of $11.9 million this year -- about what Kroger or Safeway
achieve on a busy afternoon, says the journal. WBVN Mkt cap is now around 1/3
of KR or SWY!!!! Truely Amazing, eh? Well ABS has internet effort underway --
see below.

WSJ said WBVN expects $518 million revenue in 2001. KR has $50,000 million now
(50 billion), and ABS has $37,000 million now. Go figure.

Anyway, I've salted away my cheap ABS for the duration. It will withstand any
downturn.

The recent drop in ABS is attributed to the fact that ABS acquired Lucky Stores
and just changed the name of all the Luckys in calif to Albertsons. Figure it
will confuse and alienate the customers. I'll take my chances.

 LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10 (Reuters) - Supermarket giant Albertson's Inc. (NYSE:ABS
- news) said on Wednesday it plans to move into the online grocery business,
which has so far been dominated by smaller start-ups, with a Web site and
special Albertsons.com store in the Seattle area...The 31,000-square-foot
center, an aging supermarket that has been remodeled, is about half the size of
most modern Albertson's stores. Yet the company has high hopes that it will
revolutionize the grocery business as consumers, particularly women, continue
to flock to their computers to shop online....

<<It seems to me that in most cases the dividends offered cannot be generated
by the REITs cash flow. They must either sell properties, issue shares, or
mortgage properties.>>

Where did you hear that? That is absolutely not true except for a few very
distressed cases like SNH.

If that is the case I will look at some Reits that you have suggested on this
thread in detail over the weekend.

Grommit: some comments on Albertson's. (ABS)

I'm having trouble getting near the bottom on ABS too. My position is small;
would've liked to increase it substantially, but didn't buy enough when I had a
chance. I see where the famous Bill Miller has now come out saying he has a
position. That seems correlated with the recent sharp increase of ABS up from
its lows.

You said, "it will withstand any downturn". If you mean it won't drop in a
market downturn, you are wrong (imo -g-). If you mean that it will come back up
within or after a market downturn, then I agree.

I believe that Albertson's is a Buffett stock (more so almost than a value
stock.) Because, being the number 2 grocery chain, and with its very good
historical performance, I can envision the company being around and surviving
10-15 years hence. I so posted on the Buffett thread, but I don't believe
anybody agreed with me or that they swung for that pitch. Which seems to be
true for my other Buffett suggestions also. Nevertheless, for me, I will try to
hold for 5 years to see what happens. If I am correct that it's a Bill Miller
run we are seeing now, then I will have a chance to add more, perhaps under 34,
as buying abates.

Looks like we all have the same outlook on Disney: it just feels undervalued. I
bought it at 25 and change about a month ago for the same reason. I see
contrarian, value, and growth reasons to buy. But nothing Graham-like.

The mall of the future.

Thanks for the ROBOT link. I just bought my first books on the web. Your link
found the best price for me and the price beat AMZN by 16%. Each book was
cheaper and S&H was also cheaper.

Total with shipping:
AMZN - $54.84
http://www.AllDirect.com $46.31

I think there is plenty of customer inertia involved and people will buy
habitually from a known web-location. Also AMZN had more a better site in many
ways. But, as you all mentioned, it is easy for cheapskates like myself, armed
with a cyber-robot to comparison shop and move to another webstore.

I was most amazed that the internet price with shipping was lower than the
publisher's suggested prices on the book cover. This is either a short term
subsidy by the web-business or it indicates more trouble for brick stores than
I understood. Any comments?? I always assumed I would be paying for the
convenience of shopping on the web by paying extra for home delivery. We pay
extra for pizza delivery.

A bookseller of any scale typically pays the publisher about 50% of the cover
price for the book, so there is some margin to work with in between. The
problem for the guys on the internet is that their price is pretty close to
that 50% figure in an awful lot of cases, especially when you use the bots to
comparison shop.
