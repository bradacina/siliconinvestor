Looking at VE. I think its been beaten up by Euromess.

Co. is in all the right places. It's selling at cheap multiples, below book and
P/S is ridiculously low. Debt is high, but cash flow positive.

There's not enough details about their restructuring plan and there's plenty of
doubt about Euromess.

Chart says buy, but I'm on the fence.

Downside seems min. with big upside. Any thoughts?

Hi Clownbuck

I loaded up on EP shares in 2003 but over time peeled off a few shares to buy
WMB. EP has good assets but still carried a lot of debt which is now going to
be assumed by KM in the transaction.

I think it shows that these NG pipeline assets are worth more than the market
is currently pricing them at. I am now wondering if there may be a bidding war
for several of the other pipeline assets that are held as subsidiary companies
in companies like AGL, D, MDU or even WMB if they spinn off their E&P division.
I also wonder if any of the smaller MLP's might be in play including SEP, TCLP
or even EPD.

he watched the company for a long time and he things they are good operator and
the enterprise is legit. Their balance sheet and income statement from my
perspective does make sense - earnings are lumpy as you would expect but the
stock is very cheap. Earnings are in the 0.15-0.2HKD range and they do pay a
dividend once a year of 0.05HKD currently.

They have world wide operations in China, Peru (that is where the Andes in

I'll take losses on Veolia (VE) and the Gap (GPS) now.

I assume VE dividend will be drastically cut as company goes through a
significant restructuring. That already may be reflected in the stock price.
I'll bet the stock won't recover until more is known about how the
restructuring will work, and maybe until some dividend is expected to resume
(if it were to be eliminated this year or next).
I cut back my small position by about 1/2. Maybe the rest later.

Gap is closing stores in USA, moving to open stores in China. I don't see why
if there's underperformance in USA, why management would have much confidence
in success in starting up stores in China.
Reading about Gap on the internet, there are way too many comments about poor
quality of Gap clothing. Also high prices or the wrong styles/sizes. I'll close
my position. (Ot: And maybe consider a small short here, although I don't do
well with my attempts to short stocks.)

Apparently Statoil also found significant value in BEXP. The fields produces
20K BOEPD and they expect to increase to 80K BOEPD w/ a $700M investment. Their

the large Cap Buyers are willing to pay a higher premium now as production
ramps up in the area(s) where they are investing.

Statoil will buy all of Brigham’s shares for $36.50 each, a 20 percent premium

A good deal if they can get 100k boepd, mostly oil/ngls, imo. Not a good deal

El Paso’s exploration unit valued at $8 billion
Kinder Morgan plans to sell off deal target’s oil and gas business
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/el-pasos-exploration-unit-valued-at-8-billion-
011-10-17

From the article:"...Olsen’s estimated $8.1 billion sale price for El Paso’s
exploration and production business will help Kinder Morgan reduce its debt.

”El Paso owns high-quality Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Altamont, and Wolfcamp
acreage that many players in each basin would covet,” Olsen said....".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on this article, here are the E&P assets for El Paso which the analyst
has valued at $8B.

Exploration and Production
El Paso Corporation has both international and domestic oil and gas
http://stocks.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/2010/El-Paso-Corporation-Has-It-A
l-EP-CAGR-KMP-WMB-NI-PBR0202.aspx# . In North America, it has positions in both
the Haynesville and Eagle Ford Shale plays.

<u>I</u><u>n the Haynesville Shale, El Paso has 40,000 net acres under
lease</u><u>,</u> and exited 2009 producing 130 million cubic feet equivalent
per day gross. The company plans 41 gross wells here in 2010, and will spend
$248 million in capital.

Like other operators, El Paso has shown operational
http://stocks.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/2010/El-Paso-Corporation-Has-It-A
l-EP-CAGR-KMP-WMB-NI-PBR0202.aspx# as it has developed more and more of its
acreage. The company has reduced the time to drill and complete from 106 to 53
days over the last 12 months, and has cut drilling costs from $11.6 million to
$7.4 million over the same time frame.

<u>The Eagle Ford Shale is at an earlier stage of development for El Paso,
where it has 132,000 net acres under lease</u>. The company only has one
operating well, but plans to spend $62 million in 2010 to drill 10 gross wells.

In the international arena, El Paso has more exploratory plays in on shore
areas in Egypt and Brazil. I<u>n Brazil, El Paso has interests in three on
shore basins, which contains 65 billion cubic feet equivalent of reserves.</u>
Petrobras (NYSE: http://simulator.investopedia.com/stocks/PBR ) announced two
successful oil wells in the Potiguar Basin, where El Paso has a field, in early
2009.

I<u>n Egypt, El Paso has 1.5 million acres to explore in three different
blocks.</u> The company is currently focused on the South Alamein project where
it is drilling its fourth well. Apache Corp is the leader in Egypt where it has
11 million gross acres and production of 450,000
http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/BOED.asp as of the third quarter of 2009.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------

Not too sure based on the above how the valuation breaks down their Eagle Ford
and Haynesville Shale values but it looks like it is at the high end on a cost
per acre as EP has a limited amount of wells in operation.

If I knew they had such a large interest in an E&P operation, I might have not
peeled off any of my shares. I used the proceeds of my sale(s) to buy WMB. They
too have an E&P division that they have discussed about spinning off. The nice
part about having the pipeline operation(s) is that this component of the
company produces predictable cash flows that can be invested into the E&P
Capex. Now the companies want to break these divisions up as I guess they
believe they have more value as separate companies than as one large combined
operation.

Hi JMako -

In my AG plays, I try to stay away from a one product company. These are the
type of companies where you can have huge price swings because of the cyclical
nature of the input "feed" costs and the limited end product pricing power. I
am not sure if their 20% price increase for eggs will stick but at some price
point sales will diminish significantly.

Therefore, I like companies that have their operations spread across many
geographic regions and across several different products (both animal and
grain).

You can probably make an argument for certain niche products and/or markets
where end user prices are somewhat flexible (ie fish and shrimp farms).
However, we have seen many of the specialty salmon farms lose significant of
their market value due to falling salmon price and one large supplier trying to
buy market share at the expense of very low margins.

I used to watch the small egg producer<u> Cagle's, Inc. Common Stock(AMEX:
CGL-A )</u>and bought the stock when feed prices peeked. The bet is that the
company usually was trading at their low and once feed prices began to fall,
their profits increased.<u> </u>At today's price the company is selling at 62%
of BV. Is this a value Buy especially with the amount of money they are losing?
Maybe.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=CGL-A+Key+Statistics

Notice how the company peeked in price around Dec-Jan 2010 at $10.00/share. In
their quarterly period ending 10/2010, the company posted $0.66/share earnings.
If you look at the historical corn price (
http://futures.tradingcharts.com/chart/CN/M ) it more than doubled in price
from that period and the stock subsequently lost over 60% of it's value.

So if you want to speculate, buy the stock when you think corn prices have
peeked and if the price of corn falls significantly, usually the stock price
will move higher in about 60 days.

Therefore, assuming no significant change in their capital asset expenditures
and the price of eggs remain stable, the value opportunity is in the input cost
of the feed. When the feed cost is low (below $375), you could make a value
argument to own the company at a PE of 10 or less.

The better play is to buy the company when feed costs are very high (w/ the
stock near it's 52wk low) and then sell it to a value investor as feed cost
drop and the company is reporting good earning and selling at a 10 PE.

re: GLW and China

While I'm bullish on GLW, I do have a contrarian-contrarian thought on GLW's
medium-term prospect.

Research houses forecast demand of LCD panels will be flat in 2012. The slow
down in western countries will be picked up by the growth in Asian countries.
Apparently, the biggest factor here is China. GLW voted with its wallet by
building factories in China.

Can we count on growing consumption in China? China's recent growth has been
fueled by MASSIVE investment which has caused HUGE capital misallocation. Can
China shifts from an investment-driven economy to a consumption economy? That
requires increasing their wage level, which in turn requires a bet-the-country
correction to their capital misallocation. Will that happen? As we now know,
Japan tried but got into its lost decade.

they can either reverse or debit loan loss reserves (usually pretty rare
regulators don't like to see banks do that) or the more likely case they
significantly lower the amount credited to these reserves in the current which
lowers expenses in the current quarter.

>>Can anyone explain to me why all of a sudden all banks report higher earnings
on accounting gains? What is the logic behind it. Do they put aside less money
for reserves? And if this is the case why do they do that?<<

There are various aspects of accounting gains. Some have market to market gains
due to bonds appreciating in value. other show reserve releases due to the fact
that their non-performing loans have been decreasing. I have not issues with
that.

What I have an issue with are the accounting gains on the liability side that
run through the income statement. What happens is that debt spreads for banks
have been increasing rapidly during the last few month, which means that their
debt is worth less (they are essentially considered less creditworthy) and
since now the liabilities are worth less, the bank is booking an income gain
(even though these gains are highly hypothetical since they never could buy
back this debt and issue new debt at nominal).

This part is not an accounting trick, it is required by GAAP, but theose rules
I suspect have been set by the banksters who desire to show less income
volatility. While required by GAAP, it makes a mockery of common sense for most
of us.

I was lucky to get a sale on a few of my SVU shares at today's high when they
announced their earnings this AM. My plan was to sell some of my high priced
shares and book a loss. I think my previous buys around $6.50/share will stand
as the low considering management is positive about the future and earnings are
stable to higher and cash flows remain strong.

As time passes, they are paying down their large debt too.

I still see a lot of value in their logistics and distribution division. The
wildcard would be for the company to either sell or spin this division into
it's own operating company. There was some talk that Target or Sysco might be
interested in that division. I believe Target was building their own warehouse
and distribution network (specifically for boxed food, freezer/fridge items and
produce) to service their Canadian and Midwest stores. Previously SVU was their
exclusive distributor (in 2008/2009) but was cut back in 2010. Not sure where
it stands now and if Target got their logistic system in or went back to SVU.
Sysco was looking to expand their operations and the SVU logistics business was
a good fit. Barron's (or Fortune) did a story on this several month ago
but I have not heard much.

My quick analysis had SVU's logistics and distribution worth $3.00/share.

Not buying any more shares at current levels and not selling any more either.
If we see $10.00/share I may Peel off a few shares. The value story on this one
is still promising. Very satisfied w/ today's earnings.

re: WDC

WDC fell 15% this week because the flood in Thailand has severely interrupted
its manufacturing. I know WDC was discussed on and off on this thread. It's now
getting interesting on a contrarian basis.

* * *

I used to think HDD was crap business and was perpetually in price war. But I
was shocked when I checked WDC's ROE in the last 10 years. It has been in the
range of 14-40%. Now the HDD economics is getting even better this year when
Seagate is acquiring Samsung's HDD business and Western Digital is acquiring
Hitachi's HDD business. So 5 vendors become 3 and it is now effectively a
duopoly between STX and WDC, together commanding 90% of the market. And come to
think about it, its economics is actually better than things like PC, CPU and
OS. Every 3-4 years, you may not want to upgrade your OS, PC or CPU. But you
HAVE to replace your HDD even if you have no intention to upgrade anything or
increase storage volume, because it wears out. It is a recurring business.

The most obvious threat is SSD. SSD's advantage is in its speed, physical
reliability and low power consumption. SSD is at the moment 5-10x more
expensive than HDD. History tells us their prices will fall in tandem
exponentially with HDD prices. On a per GB basis, there will always be a price
gap between SSD and HDD. At some point, SSD will be cheap enough for some
applications which won't need forever increasing storage. This includes: mobile
devices and the cache tier in enterprise infrastructure. On the other hand,
desktop systems (think your forever growing video collection and size of the
apps) and enterprise data centers (think cloud services) all require forever
growing storage. So, HDD is here to stay, at least for a decade.

Between WDC and STX, I prefer WDC because the mgmt appears to be more
conservative. Far less debt. Didn't jump right into the SSD fad.

Now WDC is facing headwind at 3 different levels: (1) recession; (2) SSD worry;
(3) flood. I read the script of their conference call last night. The impact of
the flood sounds really gloomy. Damage to machinery is still unknown. Next 2
quarters will be in red. It sounds like it'll take them a year or so to get
back to normal operation.

As far as I can see, if the interruption doesn't damage their relationship with
their clients, the headwinds are all temporary. It sounds like a perfect storm
which will create tremendous buying opportunities.

Good Morning Clownbuck.

I decided on starting a position in VE because it's selling at ridiculously low
valuation for a company that is number one in the world at what it does. It's
selling at just over sales, below cash and below book. Despite the concern over
how the co. restructures, there is hardly any short position....so how much
concern is there?
I like what you said in an earlier post about companies being in Europe not
necessarily being European companies, or something like that. VE has an
international presence and has been beaten up by Europe's woes. So, I will take
a chance here as there's more upside potential than downside in my evaluation.

WDC/STX: You are right about the "So 5 vendors become 3 and it is now
effectively a duopoly between STX and WDC, together commanding 90% of the
market". However, the SSD threat is counterbalancing this - in essence WDC/STX
do not have great advantages in SSD field, although they have some and they
have some technology inhouse and from acquisitions. You are right that SSD
won't replace everything, but if the question is how much they can replace. If
the percentage is significant (20%+?) HDD manufacturers will suffer.

I disagree with "Every 3-4 years, you may not want to upgrade your OS, PC or
CPU. But you HAVE to replace your HDD even if you have no intention to upgrade
anything or increase storage volume, because it wears out." I have multiple PCs
at home. And I haven't replaced a single HDD yet (fingers crossed) due to
failures. I had to replace multiple PCs due to chipset, GPU, motherboard, etc.
failures. I have only bought HDDs for backup/volume increase. Of course, if I
buy a new computer I get a new HDD as well as new CPU/GPU/etc. Still I don't
agree with your conclusion that HDDs are more frequently replaced than the
PC/CPU/GPU/etc. Perhaps it's different in other settings or perhaps I was just
lucky.

I haven't read about the flood. If what you say is correct, probably it's too
early to buy. I am surprised that the things are so bad as to "next 2 quarters
will be in red... it'll take them a year or so to get back to normal
operation". What percentage of manufacturing is affected? How much the sales
will drop? If they can't fulfill orders for a year, this is bad in terms of
competitive position...

Looking forward to more info. :)

I don't replace my HDD when it fails. I replace it before that happens. (Just

Maybe I'm the minority and not everyone thinks like me...

IIRC, sales will be halved and they acknowledged they would get into negative
gross margin next quarter. And the quarter after will be worse because their
inventories will run out. The CEO emphasized a few times this will affect them
for "a few quarters". They have factories in Malaysia. But it appears there is
that much they can shift there. And they've decided they wouldn't use their R&D
capacity for manufacturing. They have yet had the full assessment of the damage
at this point.

I look at it this way. In a PC, you currently have RAM and Level 1 and Level 2
cache on the CPU. The presence of these high speed cache memories doesn't
replace your RAM because there is a persistent price gap.

In a similar fashion, in the desktop and laptop systems, I foresee it will be
standard to have one SSD and one HDD, (or a hybrid integrated drive), with the
SSD catering for system files and swap space.

In the data centers and enterprises, the exponential growth of data volume and
size will definitely require HDD. Probably the only wildcard is whether the
saving in power consumption, which is significant in data centers -- that's why
Google builds its data centers next to hydro power stations -- can compensate
for the premium one pays for the SSD.

I think the fear of SSD replacing HDD is overplayed.

Its product is something that will ultimately become cheaper over time and

Macquarie report makes it even more so. This is info from an 8-K relating to
the spinoff:

"Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors;
Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

In connection with the Spin-off, Messrs. David A Daberko, William L. Davis,
Charles R. Lee, Seth E. Schofield, John W. Snow and Thomas J. Usher became
directors of MPC and resigned as directors of Marathon Oil effective as of the
close of business on June 30, 2011.

Also in connection with the Spin-off, Mr. Gary R. Heminger resigned his

of the close of business on June 30, 2011.

In connection with the Spin-off, Mr. Clarence P. Cazalot, Jr. was appointed
chairman of the board of Marathon Oil in addition to his responsibilities as
President and CEO, and Dennis H. Reilley was appointed Lead Director. Both
appointments were effective July 1, 2011. "

At the time, the refinery business was almost dismissed by the investing
public. I have a feeling some insiders don's share in that belief - I wonder
how the allocation of shares was done among the executives? Let me know what

High is very subjective. Margins are better during periods of prosperity and
worse in situations like now.

Why wouldn't HDD get phased out? Hindsight is 20/20 however technology improves
terribly fast over time and as long as SSD technology continues to get more
popular and cheaper, there will be a point where HDDs are unneeded. After all,
programming is trying to make file sizes smaller although some things are
inevitably getting bigger. I believe we're going to hit a point where SSD will
take over. The next hot thing in computing is mobile. A market traditional HDD
companies are going to have a hard time competing.

Whether they'll be phased out in 10 years, 20 years or even 50 years we won't
know but there is a definite death clock readily ticking.

margins and revenue I'm thinking it's a pretty safe bet and the market is
underpricing it. I was playing around with the valuation on Vuru (they have a
pretty good tool for DCF calculations) and it looks like MSFT is about 15-30%
undervalued. http://www.vuru.co/analysis/MSFT#valuation

MSFT. Although it does seem like a safe bet, I suppose the potential for gain
is not a strong as for some of the other computer stocks. Given my age,
proclivities, and portfolio, this is fine by me.

That is, for part of my portfolio I'm perfectly okay with some MSFT and other
like stocks, just sitting there not doing much, paying the occasional small
dividend, and once in a while making a small up or down move where it's
attractive to trim or buy more. In any case, as MSFT profits continue,
eventually that will be recognized by the market and the stock price will get
pushed up. The p/e will only go so low as the "e" increases; I'd guess around
p/e 8 might be the low p/e number for such a large cap, well-established
company.

I have a few shares of SNDK, a competitor to the hdd makers, and if I owned
that one in quantity, the volatility would drive me out. It's hard enough for
me just to endure the SNDK price swings on my screen. I have steady-eddy MSFT
right next to it on my screen, which does make holding MSFT that much easier.

I agree on MSFT. The upside isn't as big, but combined with the 1-2% dividend,
having a small potential price gain makes it attractive for me.

For SNDK, I'd say the upside is much higher, but with less safety. They had an
awful year in '08 but they've recovered pretty well since then, in terms of
fundamentals. I would put a small amount in it, but nothing substantial.

Have you looked at Adobe recently? They're one of Vuru's top stocks at the
moment http://www.vuru.co/analysis/ADBE . Undeservedly beat down in August, but
have had a really strong baseline for a while now. I'm expecting the market to
catch up on this one pretty soon. They're my pick for Tech at the moment.

ADVC - Or maybe margin call. (Yes, I know ADVC is not marginable, but it still
can be sold on margin call). Tough to imagine margin call today though. ;)

The buyer got a 530% return within an hour.

The market maker or whatever they are called got a 530% return within an hour.
I am pretty sure no one got filled at .041 even if they had a standing limit
order. ;) Edit: hmm looking at better charts, it's possible that all limit
orders got filled before the drop to .041, so it's possible someone got in
there. I still think it wasn't retail orders.

Re: Re: (NYSE:MPC)

J Mako,

You're right, I didn't really elaborate on what I thought is interesting about
it and your points are all valid. Paul and I have been discussing refineries
for some time now - part of the discussion was spurred by the phenomenon of the
Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point, where refiners such as
http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=us:CVI ,
http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=us:DK ,
http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=us:HFC and
http://markets.ft.com/tearsheets/performance.asp?s=us:WNR have enjoyed margins
of more than $20 a barrel. (search for Western Refining in the forum and you
can trace back the discussion).

1. Refining is an ugly busy - some people say that retailers make more money on
the cigarettes and gums than the gas, which could be correct most of the time,
but sometimes unique situations like Cushing come about and the margins prove
very attractive. The business is also defined by high volatility based on
refining margins or crack spreads - in the case of Marathon those are based on
Midwest (Chicago) and U.S. Gulf Coast Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil over West
Texas Intermediate crude oil. In Q2 those spreads widened enough to bring
approximately $1 billion in free cash flow. Unfortunately, the pendulum swings
both ways.

2. The pipeline business is also interesting to me and you're absolutely right
that it's tiny - what interested me is that the segment income from
transportation was equal to the retail segment's income despite the fact that
transportation revenue is 0.5% of retail revenue. This doesn't make it a great
investment, but an interesting fact. What interests me is the potential
connection with the Canadian Oil Sands - that could be a game changer for this
small segment. A few years back I read a good amount about the pipeline
business in relation to natural gas and I still find it fascinating how
territorial monopolies can be created through this infrastructure.

3. The retail business in my mind represents real estate - I'm really
interested how the emergence of electric or natural gas vehicles would alter
the use and specifications of the existing gas stations. The latter is easier
to imagine than the former.

4. Of the refiners I have screened, Marathon sells at the lowest PE ratio, but
this is a cyclical business, so we don't know whether that's good or bad.

Considering all these facts only provides an interesting read, something I
think about and shelf away. I don't know whether this is a good investment at
these prices, but at lower prices it might become one - with time I've become
very picky with my investments, trying to know enough about a short list of
securities to have confidence to invest in them when prices fluctuate.

so. One of the better presentations I've come across lately. From the general
economic discussion to the specifics of each of the company's businesses.

ADBE. I'll pass on Adobe, valueguy99. (Jmo, and I've been wrong many, many
times.) Looks too expensive for me based on stock price and roe. High profit
margins though. Maybe for me if p/e were under ten. P/e expected (per Yahoo) to
fall from about 15 to 11. Yahoo shows small revenue growth recently. If sales
aren't going to increase, somehow/somewhere earnings will have to, if p/e is
expected to fall, based on current price.

If you use Vuru, is it working out okay for you?

Except for "most overvalued large caps" in which I have none of the five stocks
they mention, I do hold shares in at least one stock in each of their other
categories.

re: DAR

I value DAR as 2 entities: DAR and Griffin. Its avg capex matches its avg D&A.
So, reported earning is a good proxy of its FCF.

Using 2008-2010 3 year avg,

DAR EBIT = 80m.
Griffin EBIT = 108m
EV = 1.87B
EV/EBIT = 10
(equivalent to about P/E 15)

Including Griffin, DAR has bought 10 companies since 2004. Most of them were
small. The previous big one was National By Products in 2006. So, it looks like
DAR has been growing by acquisition.

The most obvious risk is another outbreak of BSE. Another risk is fluctuation
of commodity prices. But half of DAR's input cost and all of the Griffin's
input cost are based on "formula pricing". DAR is passing the fluctuation of
the prices of its commodity products to its suppliers to some extent. That
means DAR isn't that cyclical as compared to other Ag companies.

If DAR can maintain its growth, 10x EV/EBIT multiple isn't expensive. Its ttm
EBIT is 220m which includes only 1/2 yr of Griffin's profit. That's already 17%
above my historical average. What's hard to find out is how big the portion is
seasonal fluctuation.

armi, the cloud vs. consumer device is very difficult thing for me to see. INTC
results argue that the behind the scenes needed to power the cloud that makes
all these little consumer devices work is very healthy and growing - even
though it's somewhat out of sight. Understanding the branching / divergence of
cloud / consumer device makes understanding the different technical needs
important in picking winners/losers. I'm not there yet, but I'm thinking two
entirely different ecosystems could result due to extremely different end user
requirements - at least much more difference than we've seen in the past.

anyhow my $0.02 as I try to understand what's happening longer term. long intc,
msft, and wdc looked cheap to me before the floods. I've owned wdc in the past
and will continue to have an eye open for wdc in the future - it's priced for
near term obsolescence, and this is a good mgmt team that has capacity to adapt
evolve. all imho

MSFT pays a 3% div, and I expect that to continue to be regularly increased.
MSFT has had trouble getting out of the high 20s so there is price resistance,
but it's possible to make money on MSFT 10-15% price swings while collecting
dividends along the way until the market recognizes how lowly priced this is.
For some reason MSFT likes to drift back to the 24s where it runs out of
sellers for what seem to me to be very low risk buys.

re: WDC/STX

You're right. The story is still being unfolded.

-analysts/?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20

If there's one company to watch, it may be No.1 Western Digital (WDC),
according to IHS-iSuppli. "WDC, the world's largest HDD manufacturer in terms
of volume, has 37,000 workers in Thailand, and production in the country
accounts for 60 percent of the company's total capacity. WDC in the second
quarter made 53.8 million HDDs, giving it a 32 percent share of the global
market," said iSuppli.
