MEOH,

Sold some today on bad news about Peru cutting 30% of the supply to one of
their plants. I still like the stock, but think it could trade down on the
news, giving a short-term buying opportunity.

We will see. News follows (not on Yahoo yet)

MC

Chile, Jun 17, 2004 (BNamericas.com via COMTEX) -- Vancouver-based methanol
producer Methanex Corporation has reduced methanol production by 30% at its
Cabo Negro facility in Chile's southern Region XII due to gas supply cuts from
Argentina, newspaper Estrategia quoted Methanex's Latin America VP Rodolfo
Krause as saying.

The company has seen its gas supplies cut by 1.7 million cubic meters a day
(mcm/d), which is 30% of its total requirement.

"We don't have the possibility of using an alternative fuel so natural gas is a
non-substitutable supply for us, and if the restrictions are 30%, this means
our production decreases by that much," Krause said.

However, Krause is optimistic of a resolution to the crisis in the short-term.

"We expect that in [southern hemisphere] spring-summer the situation will
normalize completely. I would like to be more optimistic and think this will
happen in August but I don't have a crystal ball," he said.

The Cabo Negro facility, which started operations in 1988, is Methanex's
largest and lowest cost facility.

It employs 450 people and its three trains have a combined annual capacity of
three million tons (mt), which will rise to nearly 4mt when a new production
plant, currently under construction, is commissioned by year-end.

Methanex officials were not immediately available for comment.

believes coal business will do well, thus putting money in hands of local

There was an interesting SEC filing regarding BL. An activist shareholder group
bought up 5%+ and indicated interest in meeting with BL management to discuss
methods of enhancing shareholder value.

BL is conservatively priced at roughly Net Current Assets.

Here is a link to the SEC filing:

http://www.edgar-online.com/bin/cobrand/finSys_main.asp?nad=&formfilename=00008
 6017-04-000013&x=31&y=6

I've owned BL for several years and its been easy to hold onto because of the
company's continued operating performance and conservative pricing (usually
selling at a large discount to book and often discount to net current assets)

Would be interested in knowing your thoughts.

Also, Sold MAXS today. That was a great score and I have only this excellent

BL has been difficult for me to hold. Watching paint drying in a Mississippi
summer -g-

I am holding nonetheless. Just not following the company closely though. Here
are my reasons for holding:
Company, at current price, ought still be selling close to NCA.
They've spent money to upgrade/improve their warehousing operations. Soon (or
maybe now) they should start to reap efficiencies (costs) from this activity.
(So they hope and so do stockholders.) This improvement could eventually be
reflected in better earnings and higher stock price.

Please note, I've not reviewed any of my assumptions or conclusions above for
more than a year. So I could be very wrong here. Possibly I'm already wrong
because I've assumed the recent stock price rise was due to some positives
related to the efficiencies I hoped for -- I wasn't aware of the activist
shareholder group.

Thanks for your update. Appreciate your adding facts or correcting wrong
opinions that I might have regarding BL (or other stocks).

Based on what you point out now, I certainly won't want to be selling now, and
might even consider adding a little more to my few shares.

My safe pick of MRO I still own and it has done nicely. I have no intention of

My pick for a double, WSCI, is currently underwater. I still own it and expect
the earnings release at the end of this month to put it nicely into the green.

In selecting which one company to enter for this list, WSCI was a coin toss (in
my mind) with PMSI. PMSI would be my current selection. PMSI is currently my
largest holding and the largest percentage-of-total portfolio allocation I have
ever had in one company.

Prior to this, TRCI was my largest single company allocation and it was quite
rewarding in that position. I am hopeful that I can say similar things about
PMSI. So far the return on investment dollar for PMSI as a holding is 22.6%, if
I'm correct in my reads of the financials, the technicals and the business
model, this company could well double from here in the next year. Time will
remove the mystery.

AUO is very interesting because I look for stocks with good fundamentals to
sell covered calls. A premium of .55 on the July 17.5s is pretty good with the
pps about 1.5 out of the money. S&P rates AUO a hold. You might be interested
in the S&P valuation, which it must be noted was made when the price was 17.78.

Valuation - 27-MAY-04

We recommend that existing shareholders hold positions, as we view AUO as
fairly priced. We believe the shares appropriately discount the cyclicality of
the company’s business. Risks to our target price include the fact that the
company is subject to the high volatility of an emerging market (the
application of displays in LCD TVs, and the possibility of sustained losses as
it is subject to a cyclical industry with heavy capital investment
requirements. In addition, planned additions in industry capacity for 2004 and
2005 could cause the industry to suffer from excess capacity, which could
negatively impact earnings. Our 12-month target price of $25 is based on our
price to sales analysis. We believe the shares can trade at a multiple of
roughly 2X our 2004 revenue estimate, in line with AUO’s peers, and the
company’s historical range.

mid year portfolio updates:

My safe pick was TMR and I would still buy it here. I still think it will be
over $10 by Q1
2005.(http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=19913958).

My high risk, high reward pick was CORV and I am still holding (The bounce to
around $3 early in the year was overdone and I should have cashed out there).

My honorable mention high risk\ high reward was SATC and I sold earlier this
year at 2.80. Now that it has come back to $2.15 I think it is interesting
again. However the chart looks lower so I will likely wait until after the Q2
earnings release to see if it is still progressing. For Q1 2004 they cut the
operating loss from $5 million in 2003 to $1 million in 2004, and if they can
continue the trend it still has double potential. If I had to buy another stock
today to replace it I would take AGEN (Antigentics), as it is at long term
support and could put in an ELN type performance if Oncophage trial results are
positive.

Grommit, it almost seems like some of the ancillary stocks to oil have run up
further and faster than some of the oil stocks themselves.

I can't go for coal co. BTU psychologically because I just can't or won't get
myself to step up $30+ higher than what I sold BTU for. Ugh!

OTOH, I've bought several coal haulers, and I still hold them. (The railroad
stocks which have been discussed)

The tanker stocks still look good to me. OMM might still be a buy - I've added
a bit to my position recently. (Tanker stocks always seem to me to be cheap
with their low p/e's; maybe they still actually are, maybe not.)
I still like the refiners too, and I've mentioned several here over the past
few years.

I bought SU in April after it was mentioned in Barron's in an interview with a
fellow from John Herold Inc.

I continue to add to XOM (yesterday) as it hits new highs.

I'm considering adding to NGAS. A small company: I'm not sure of management's
experience; I'm not that knowledgeable about accounting practices in this
business or how conservative (or not) that NGAS is or how they structure their
sales (contract or spot) or how they capitalize (or otherwise account for)
their expenses. Here's the ruling reason for me buying (or holding) though:
""Our successful drilling continued at a record pace," said William S.
Daugherty, President and CEO of Daugherty Resources. "We were 100 percent
successful in our 53 natural gas wells drilled in the first quarter, including
15 new wells on our Leatherwood Prospect."" (5/17 PR)

Lot of opportunities still in the oil/gas sector. (I hope). Still, it's
difficult to understand the businesses therein. That's why I like a package -
whether it's within a subsector (e.g. pick a few integrated oils or a few
tanker stocks,or refiners, etc.) or among subsectors (pick a small cap, a
driller, a tanker, and one integrated, and etc.)

BMW many $'s or Euro. I consider Pitschesrieder dangerous and his current track
record at Volkswagen does not lead me to revise my harsh judgement. under his
helm, VW dodged the launch of the new VW Golf, it's bread and butter car.
Germans consider this car uninspiring and overpriced. This is going to be hard

Hi Paul,

I never really understood the ACAS valuation discount relative to ALD (other
than less followed \ shorter history).
Given that ACAS dividend, earnings and book value are 20% plus greater than ALD
isn't ACAS worth 20% plus more than ALD? (which would say if ALD is worth 24,
than ACAS should be worth at least 29?)

Area51, you could be right. ALD has a longer history and track record than
ACAS; I agree with you that investors discount ACAS a little because of that.

To me, it's not a matter of which is more undervalued. They both seem to offer
good yields and a chance for some capital appreciation. I own both. ACAS seems
to me relatively undervalued compared to ALD, and so I have made it my larger

OVTI - barriers to entry?
I think there are substantial barriers to entry. OVTI's market are image
sensors build using CMOS technology. CMOS is a standard technology used for
many semiconductor products (Memory etc.). Traditionally, image sensors were
build using CCD (charged coupled devices) which is a more expensive andf i
think they also consume more power. For low cost mass market products, CMOS
sensors should be cheaper. My understanding is that OVTI deploys a proprietary
method/design for its sensors which may represent a substantial hurdle for
competitors:

I think OVTI is an interesting story in an exlosive market (camera phones, low

unless it bounces back from an oversold position due to thin, after-hours

I had sold the last of my WM shares near the end of Feb. at just under $45. I'm
not surprised by the announcement but at the size of the warning.

Washington Mutual slashed its 2004 earnings outlook on Monday, citing rising
interest rates that are eroding its mortgage lending business.

It said it expects 2004 profit of between $3.00 and $3.60 per share, down from
$4.21 last year, and said its mortgage business may lose money.

It previously expected to make a profit of about $4.35 per share, spokesman
Alan Gulick said. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates, on average, had
forecast $4.05. The lowered profit forecast was the second from Washington
Mutual in seven months.

On a related note, Dale's Baker's new pick FMT looks interesting at first
blush. Any comments here?

FMT's PE has been under 10 since 2002, having lost money for a while prior to
that. So I used very conservative estimates:

Company: FMT
Date: 6/29/04
Next year's expected earnings: $4.00
EPS growth rate used for estimate: 8
P/E maximum used for estimate: 7
Graham Fair Value: $64.77
Current Price: $17.29

SI post on WM:

Monday, Jun 28, 2004 10:31 PM
View Replies (1) | Respond to of 15981

This press release was a huge surprise to me.
No, not that WM is going to warn, or miss earnings big time when they report
July 22, but rather the way that they sounded like it was a surprise to them,
and how little they have done to prepare for it.

Now I wonder about their portfolio. They were swamped by the big refi mania
that peaked July 2003, as well as the mini refi mania that ended around Jan
2004. As a result, they funded an unknown amount of loans that has to be at a
loss since rates had moved up since then. If they sold these loans, what is the
loss? If they decided to portfolio these loans, they are sitting on a paper
loss.

Regarding staffing,
http://biz.yahoo.com/rc/040628/financial_washingtonmutual_jobs_1.html

the story was supposed to be that they had cut staff, decided not to add staff
during the mini refi mania so they should have already downsized enough. That
is clearly not the case.

Having heard the last few conf calls, Killinger impressed me as a hard selling
shoot from the hip CEO, with more noise than substance. Now the guidance is $3
to $3.60 for the year? I am willing to bet that they will miss $3.

Unfortunately, WM has an out. They would probably put themselves up for sale if
it gets really tough. It is tough to short, without having a good understanding
what the takeover value may be.

This pronouncement by WM just astonishes me. I don't follow the company but
it's supposedly a blue chip performer with top quality management. The release
is vague as to how they are suddenly losing gobs of money in the mortgage
business. Does anywone know how they account for their servicing income?
Perhaps they have been booking a portion of it up front. It is quite possible
that the decline in revenue in new business booked as well as declining
interest spreads is now eating up all profits from the mortgage side of the
business but they should be experienced enough to know what their potential

Are you familiar with the terms of the Everalst/Active Apparel Group "merger" a
few years back? I owned AAGP back in the last millennium, buying from $3 down
to $1 and was the only bid @ $.50 for weeks without seeing a trade. Then one
morning in 1998 I saw it spike up to $4 and happily cashed it in. An hour later
it peaked around $20. Turned out they were going to have an online presence at
some now defunct online shopping mall.
Then there's this deal with Everlast. AAGP had licensed the name and it looked
better on a good looking lady's chest than it ever looked on a boxer's
waistband. So AAGP took on the Everlast name and what I see as a fatal
obligation, though they modified it somewhat in their favor recently.

11. Series A Redeemable Participating Preferred Stock and Note Payable:

On October 24, 2000, the Board of Directors designated the issuance of
45,000 shares (1,000,000 total preferred shares authorized) $.01 par value
of Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock (the "preferred shares"). These
preferred shares were issued pursuant to the merger agreement among the
Company, Everlast Holding Corp. and Active Apparel New Corp., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and are recorded at their fair
value. The preferred shares have priority liquidation and dividend rights
over other securities issued.

As part of the merger agreement, the Company is to redeem 5,000 shares
($5,000,000 redemption value) on every December 31 until all of the shares
have been redeemed. The Company has the option to redeem all of the
preferred shares at the end of any quarter or an additional amount greater
than the mandatory redemption at the end of any year (December 31st). The
Company is required to pay 105% of the redemption value for any optional
redemption that is made.

On January 13, 2004 we announced that we had entered into an Agreement
on December 14, 2003 with the Principal Preferred Stockholder, modifying
its annual minimum redemptions.

Under the terms of the Agreement, in lieu of a cash payment for the
redemption of a portion of their Series A Preferred Stock, $2,000,000 for
each of the four years commencing December 14, 2003, e through December 14,
2006, will be converted into four term loans ("Notes"). The Notes are
evidenced by four promissory notes from the Company which shall provide for
the payment of interest and deferred finance costs. Interest and deferred
finance costs are to be paid at the combined annual rate of 9.5% per annum
on the aggregate $8 million of notes during each of the years 2004 through
2007, and 10% during 2008 payable each December 14th until maturity on
December 14, 2008. The Company shall have the right to pre-pay the
promissory notes in full, with no prepayment fees, prior to December 14,
2008 together with all unpaid interest and deferred financing costs due at
the time of pre-payment. There are no changes to the existing preferred
dividend formula currently being used on the outstanding redeemable
percentage of the Series A Preferred Stock, mentioned below. As a further
condition of this refinance, the Company paid financing costs aggregating
$800,000 of which $700,000 was paid by December 2003.

If the Company fails to make a mandatory redemption payment within
thirty days after it is due, all licenses and trademarks obtained pursuant
to the merger will be assigned back to the former stockholders of Everlast,
effective 60 days following the assignment, if not remedied.

Commencing on the date of issue, the preferred shares accrue dividends
equal to two-thirds (2/3) of the "net after tax profits" multiplied by the
"outstanding redeemable percentage." Net after tax profits is defined in
the agreement as net income after taxes (pursuant to generally accepted
accounting principles) plus goodwill amortization as it relates to the
merger, plus compensation from the granting and the exercise of the
Company's employee stock options. Outstanding redeemable percentage is
defined in the agreement as the aggregate redemption value of the preferred
shares outstanding as of January 1st divided by $45 million.........

Madharry: I share your concern on WM. On various financial shows, WM was
criticised for lacking skills to manage risk over the rate cycle. Essentially
the claim was that they bought their way into the mortgage banking biz and thus
failed to develop the skill sets of those like Countrywide who grew it
organically and is considered a master at it. Fortunately mortgage banking is
only 15% of revenue or this could be a lot uglier. There was also some fault
finding about lack of integration - always difficult when large mergers are
recent. As value investors we look at price vs retrospective earnings...and on
this score WM has looked good. What's a helluva lot more difficult is
prospective evaluation of the above 'intangibles.' My tentative [It could
change by noon as I dig further] view is that 2004 will be used to bury a lot
of costs/issues and thus may see further writedowns, but the sun should come
out in 2005 when they are expected to earn in the $4's with favorable 03
comps...if they get their act together. One significant possibility would be
they get bought out by someone that CAN manage the rate risk and integration.
Speculation on this is likely keeping prices higher than recent performance
would imply.
Because Nygren owns so much, I wouldn't look for candor about his 'concerns.'
It's tough for folks with 'Skin in the game' to be publicly [or privately]

I have sold CDT yesterday and bought some OVTI. Analyses:

CDT is still cheap on PSR basis, however, it is unclear whether even the
combined Belden-CDT can raise prices enough to have a high return in the future
(recent ROE was ~3-5%). The merger eliminates one competitor, but there are
others. CDT-Belden production is located mostly in US, which implies high
costs. Customers bought a lot of product last quarter before the merger, so
next quarter may be low. CDT-Belden also benefited from weak US dollar. Both
companies are conservatively managed, they paid off a bunch of debt even in the
tough 2000-2003 years, so they may fare well. Option rewards to Belden
executives are quite high and comprise over 25% (!) of all options awarded. I
don't like this.

At the current price CDT-Belden is probably a weak hold if one expects the
pricing environment to improve. I would discount a recent speculation that the
combined company will be taken over by a larger company once the merger clears.
I see no substance to this speculation.

OVTI is cheap if the current sales, margins and ROE (19% last year, 27% last Q)
can be sustained. However, there is no obvious barrier of entry for competitors
and if the market does not grow fast enough, the margins will be squeezed.
There is some possibility that they still have lead over their competitors.
Furthermore, they are likely to be speculative and high volatility play, so
short term investors may find an exit point even if the long-term future is
unclear. It is rather risky play, so I would not suggest more than a small
dabble ("double" :)))) investment.

Paul,

At one time I had pretty high hopes for INLD. It seemed to me they were moving
in the right direction in a lot of places and it was just a matter of getting
over the hump. Unfortunately, management is a ball and chain around an
otherwise good concept.

They burned through a ton of cash acquiring profitable, cash flow positive
hosting companies, then did such a horrible job integrating the businesses,
they lost all the customers. By all rights, they should have hit profitability
a year ago, but as things stand, they'll probably be out of cash in a year.

I still check the price now and then, but haven't had a position in the stock
for quite awhile. IMO it's not even a good trading stock anymore.

For a long shot small position, it might be okay, but I wouldn't be the farm on
it.

This is one I bookmarked a few days ago, but haven't had time to research yet.
At the moment it looks like it'd be like trying to catch a falling knife. I

trade solely on my signals.

My primary investment strategy is value investing. I prefer to buy stocks below
book (or even
cash) value and the companies have large market share in a growing market
without debt. A good
example was ALVR in late 2002 – it was trading below $2 with $3.5 in cash/share
and no debt, it
also met my other selection criteria. I accumulated it over the course of
several months and it
became my largest holding in Feb 2003. ALVR went to $17 in one year. I sold
most of shares in Q1
2004.

The problem with value investing is what to do when market is overvalued – as I
believe it is now.
It is ok to sit on cash with personal money but it is very hard to do so when
you have a large
portfolio. I have tested other strategies such as “Relative Value” and
“Long/short pair trade”,
but I haven’t achieved 70% winning probability to certify them as viable
strategies in my arsenal.

My secondary strategy is based on several proprietary technical analysis models
that had 70% or
higher winning chances. Technical analysis is the process of analyzing a
security's historical
prices in an effort to determine probable future prices. Contrary to popular
belief, you do not
need to know what a security's price will be in the future to make money. Your
goal should simply
be to improve the odds of making profitable trades. I have studied technical
analysis since 1992
and found the winning odds are much better when applying technical analysis on
the market index
than individual stock –probably because individual stock price movement is
subject to
unpredictable earning surprises and human decisions such as big institutional
holders
buying/selling activities, while the market index can statistically cancel out
some of those. So
I focused on developing my own technical indicators on the market indices. One
“long-term market
top indicator” has been 90% accurate in the last ten years (I did not have this
indicator 10 years
ago but was able to back test with historical data). It gave a “Bull to Bear
market trend change
final confirmation signal” on 4/23/2004; the last such signal was in March
2002. Another
“short-term market bottom/top indicator” is about 70% accurate. I announced the
“short-term”
model anticipated a “sell-off” in my 6/15 email, the market went up 1-2% after
that, and triggered
a “final confirmation” on 7/1/2004. The probability to go down is 90% now
–highest in two years.
To limit the risk of that 10% chance, I use up to 15% of the capital to trade
on such signals.
Since it is leveraged, I expect some volatility in the monthly return numbers.
If NASDAQ goes up
above 2070, I will have to re-examine the model signal, and the portfolio may
suffer several
percentage losses.

Thank you for reading and I welcome any comments/questions, or simply drop a
line to say you read
my emails.

Happy Investing and Good Luck!

Added to my loosing position in ViaB - ViaB trades at the lower end of its
historical multiples. Fairly good balance sheet and ad recovery and strong
cable channel performance should power results going forward.

FWIW: I bought back a small trading position in AMAT.

very interesting show and comments on cnbc just now- very negative on the us
car makers, yahoo overpriced, not enough 3rd quarter guidance to justify
holding stocks in view of projected inflation. looks like a big meltdown in
internet stocks-probably wont be very good for semiconductors either.

OT FWIW paul looks like you were right on NRGN it can now be purchased below 7
if you are so inclined. I guess i should have sold more at higher levels. I
still think its a good buy. I am also looking at auo, icos and possibly
increasing positions in pze and tnt. anyone familiar with taiwanese accounting?

You still like NRGN? They never got anything past Phase II so far - this must
be more than just bad luck. I wouldook at NPSP and MLNM for biotech buys right
now.

NRGN and ICOS are just too expensive for me based on financials I see. They
might do very well on their business prospects, but that is something I'm not
capable of foreseeing.

I hold a losing position in AUO; I added a bit recently to my small TNT
position.

Madharry, yes perhaps with interest rates rising, this is not the time for car
makers. I'm holding bits of GM and NSANY - GM looks sickly. I'm more positive
on auto retailers, some of which are now hitting new lows. I'm considering
adding some shares.

fwiw, positive article on tortilla maker, GMK. (The stock is still attractively
priced on some measures, imo.)

GMK,

GMK came up on one of my screens recently. Although I hate buying after a
Motley Fool article, it looks not too shabby.

MSK is another one you might look at it. I bot it prior, and it seems to be
linked to GMK as in run by the same company but a different part of the supply
chain. GMK seems like it would have better growth prospects, but MSK has a nice
dividend.

Averaging up just a bit on my oil transporter, OMM position.

...hoping that the increased OPEC oil production which is set to occur
(presumably), is not already totally built into the price of this shipper.

I'm not sure where increased oil from OPEC will be going, but it seems that
demand will continue to be high in the USA. I believe that that means there
will be increased gasoline supplies produced. If so, then ADM, with its ethanol
(additive) production, might see demand sustained or increased too (and maybe
profits).

I also like that ADM's expanding its business line of zero/low trans-fat oils
and margarines. "The increased capacity will help satisfy the food industry's
demands as it moves forward to meet the January 1, 2006, FDA labeling
requirement."

Hard for me to see if there'll be significantly increased profits from these
particular activities - ADM's just such a behemoth with many businesses - but
if the stock market holds up, I'll bet that ADM stock will too.

I'll take some at current price.
