Regarding preferreds - I like REIT's preferred since they ae backed by real
assets. Many REIT companies have preferred's outstanding. My simple rule is -
if i like the balance sheet of the common, the preferred may be a buy.

i have not found a good way to find them, though. Quantumonline has an
alphabetical list of all preferred - that may be a starting point if you have
some time on you hand.

Another way to find preferred is simply to type in the stock ticker symbol
followed by a "-" in yahoo/finance. The Autofill/search function will show all
the stock symbols that begin with this string which usually will include all
the preferred of this stock.

Incidentally i bought a preferred today that cannot be found with this method -
AFC. It's a 6.875% preferred from infamous ALD,currently trading at 13.X$, so
the yield is almost 13%. Since it's a debt security it's much safer than the
common even though one could think otherwise looking at todays quotes.

One problem with preferred's and in particular REIT preferred is the chance
that REIT's can go private. While it is good news for the holder of common, it
is bad news for the holder of debt securities like preferred. this is not
something that is very likely to happen right now but if the economy and/.or
credit situation betters it is a consideration that needs to be taken into
account.

Spekulatius,
I am also buying preferred Reits. A person can purchase the best of breed reit
preferreds paying around 8.5% these days. I have invested in these for years
and (very much like MLPs) you can lock in some of the highest rates. I'm very,
very cautious on the market, so I'm sticking with MLPs and preferred Reits
until the financial mess straightens up. I believe it is far from over. If your

I don't understand how to view or predict the crack spreads - or lack thereof -

There are five bullet points that must be satisfied for us to take a
concentrated position in a stock. First, it must have a macro tail wind. That
means some trend such as demographics, geography or monetary policy must be
working in its favor.

Second, it must have an industry tail wind. That can be a structural change in
the stock's industry. That may take the form of reversing 20 years of
under-investment in extracting raw materials.

Or it may be some secular change like the Internet competing with traditional
media. Or it can be the battle between mobile handsets and landline phones.

IBD: Are any bullet points company-specific?

Gilchrist: No. 3 is. That can involve having a better product or management
team. It can be something that lets a company take better advantage of points
No. 1 and 2 to gain market share, grow faster than the economy or better than
its industry.

No. 4 is a change factor at the company.

No. 5 is something that is misunderstood or not appreciated by the market --
something everyone else is missing.

Those bullet-point stocks. I'd guess it would depend on when he figured the
particular stock met his criteria and when he bought. PBR might have qualified,
depending on when he bought it. That is, he may have bought before the big oil
discoveries were announced because apparently he may have discerned something
from macro and company-specific or industry-specific analysis, that good things
might be in future for PBR. Maybe same if he bought MA at its ipo. For now,
with these two, he's riding the gains I suspect, and maybe not saying at
current price they qualify for being bought because they meet his criteria.

It may be possible that American Latina meets the criteria now. With recent
opening of new Brazilian agricultural areas, the new trade agreements for
companies seeking Brazil's soybeans, ethanol,meats - you have macro changes in
Brazil. Delivering this is the railroad that I'm suspecting might not be known,

Well, maybe I am splitting hairs, but sure MA, PBR, American Latina do qualify

unlikely though that you can find a stock - or that he ever found a stock -
that qualifies for all five points. I.e. sure PBR and MA had tailwinds for
industry and the company and maybe they even were misunderstood, but was there
a change in the company itself? And for MA I am not sure there was ever some
competitive advantage over Visa. But perhaps in duopoly you don't need point 3.

it turns out to be a shade under .09. that resources is calculated I believe
for $700 gold so right now one controls $80 of gold per each share of plg.to.
Obviously there will be dilluton as the mine gets built and costs will be
anywhere from $450 to $650 depending on what part they are are mining. However,
if the price of gold goes to $1200, that number goes up to $108 and most of the
difference becomes pure profit. this is just based on

yes i would be interested in preferreds. i have been looking at a few of them -
i like HPT-XX and AFC. HPT has trouble with it's truck stops (TA) but is
solidly financed. The preferreds are yielding almost 11%.

AFC is indeed unsecured debt and not an equity vehicle, which makes it even
safer. ALD would have to get completely wiped out before AFC (together with
other unsecured debt) would loose principle. Considering that ALD has 50%
equity by design that is very unlikely to happen and if it were to happen, i
think ALD would go into runoff mode and simply be like a closed end junk bond

OMG, what are these guys smoking? Can I short them to zero if they are really

Get over it. The era of cheap airline oil is over. If you admit it, you may
survive. If you write idiotic letters, you won't.

------------------------------------
An Open Letter to All Airline Customers

Our country is facing a possible sharp economic downturn because of
skyrocketing
oil and fuel prices, but by pulling together, we can all do something to help
now.

For airlines, ultra-expensive fuel means thousands of lost jobs and severe
reductions in air service to both large and small communities. To the broader
economy, oil prices mean slower activity and widespread economic pain. This
pain can be alleviated, and that is why we are taking the extraordinary step of
writing this joint letter to our customers.

Since high oil prices are partly a response to normal market forces, the nation
needs to focus on increased energy supplies and conservation. However, there is
another side to this story because normal market forces are being dangerously
amplified by poorly regulated market speculation.

Twenty years ago, 21 percent of oil contracts were purchased by speculators who
trade oil on paper with no intention of ever taking delivery. Today, oil
speculators purchase 66 percent of all oil futures contracts, and that reflects
just the transactions that are known.

Speculators buy up large amounts of oil and then sell it to each other again
and again. A barrel of oil may trade 20-plus times before it is delivered and
used; the price goes up with each trade and consumers pick up the final tab.
Some market experts estimate that current prices reflect as much as $30 to $60
per barrel in unnecessary speculative costs.

Over seventy years ago, Congress established regulations to control excessive,
largely unchecked market speculation and manipulation. However, over the past
two decades, these regulatory limits have been weakened or removed. We believe
that restoring and enforcing these limits, along with several other modest
measures, will provide more disclosure, transparency and sound market
oversight. Together, these reforms will help cool the over-heated oil market
and permit the economy to prosper.

The nation needs to pull together to reform the oil markets and solve this
growing problem.

We need your help. Get more information and contact Congress by visiting

More importantly, neither index funds nor other speculators ever buy any
physical oil. Instead, they buy futures and options which they settle with a
cash payment when they fall due. In essence, these are bets on which way the
oil price will move. Since the real currency of such contracts is cash, rather
than barrels of crude, there is no limit to the number of bets that can be
made. And since no oil is ever held back from the market, these bets do not
affect the price of oil any more than bets on a football match affect the
result.

is there oil hoarding by the evil speculators?

Purchased GBL.BR
With that I am sort of buying back my Pargesa (Parg.SW) position sold a while
ago. Pargesa almost controls GBL.BR (they own close to 50%) and is their main
investment vehicle. The reason why i am preferring GBL.BR is that they have a
direct stock ownership while having the approx. the same discount to NAV then
Pargesa. Pargesa's NAV is calculated based on "look through" NAV which values
their controlling Pargesa stake not based on actual market prices but based on
NAV (which is higher). (NAT.BR which is the superholding of Pargesa does the
same thing) I believe that GBL.BR direct stock ownership justifies a smaller
discount to NAV than Pargesa's or NAT.BR which is why I choose GBL.BR.

Those minor details aside i generally like GBL.BR's holdings of Lafarge, Suez,
Total, Imersys and Pernod Ricard. Those are well managed business which over
the LT should outperform the European indizes.

Hi Grommit - I have been accumulating REITs the last 45 days and they seem to
be moving lower along with the financials. The vacancy rates are quite low on
the properties I own and the FFO's are good and increasing YOY. However the
market seems to be pricing in a risk premium for potential future dividend cuts
based on the small probability of a long entrenched deep recession.

The two positions I have been adding to are (1) HRPT PROPERTIES (NYSE:HRP) and
(2) BRANDYWINE REALTY TR (NYSE:BDN):
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=HRP,BDN&d=s

Both are trading at multi year lows, Each company has announced the payment of
their next dividend (which yield 11%-12%). BNDY already went xdividend July 3
but HRP goes xdividend July 25.

According to YAHOO they are selling below their book value and each have
positive increasing FFO. BDN recently sold some West Coast properties with the
proceeds used to reduce their long term debt. This move will help them weather
any significant slow down should a deep recession impact their FFO.

BDN is owned by a lot of institutions (major REIT mutual funds) and as they
sell there is limited price support.

It's still hard to see the prices continue to move lower and I hope a bottom is
established soon. I guess the key thing to watch for is some capitulation
followed by a significant amount of volume.

I am out of all of my financials except for NYB and have moved the proceeds to
REITs. If you go to each of the companies Web pages, you can see all of the
properties in their portfolio and their specific lease terms.

HRPT PROPERTIES (http://www.hrpreit.com/)
BRANDYWINE REALTY TR (http://www.brandywinerealty.com Properties/Map.aspx )

GE reports earnings tomorrow morning. Last quarter they missed and the stock
fell 11%. GE is expected to report a 1.9% increase in profit of $0.54 per share
and a 7.1% rise in revenue of $45.3 billion, according to analysts polled by
Thomson Financial.

The recent July option activity indicates the stock should trade around $27
with a small bias to the downside (new open interest on the July $26 Puts).

If the stock trades lower Friday (below $27) I will add to my position. If the
world economy really tanks, then we may see the stock test it's 2003 low of
$22.70. Todays dividend is 60% higher than in 2003, so if this low is ever
tested, GE would have to cut their dividend and see their global revenues
really fall.

Therefore, be alert on Friday's AM open . . . as GE goes, so goes the market.

DOW is somewhat interesting. It is cheap, but then the earnings have declined

GGB - I don't have a strong feeling about steel producers. It seems that with
iron ore price climbing and with coal price climbing they may be squeezed in
between like oil refiners are. But maybe I am wrong and they can pass the price
increases along. I have a tiny bit in PKX but I am not buying more and I will

attractive, but the unattractive segments weigh the whole thing down. Of
course, if they manage to sell off the bad segments profitably or turn them

I did not know about NVDA plunge when I was writing this. Now that I read about

However, I would wait until their Q2 numbers are released, since I think they
will be worse than expected with continued uncertainty about the replacement
cost of faulty mobile GPUs.

Of course, there is also a question of what is the long-term story with the GPU
vendors. It is pretty clear that even higher powered GPUs are needed for a
variety of PC applications, it is not clear though whether consumers are ready
to pay for them and whether margins can be sustained. This is of course the
risk of tech companies - the technology obsolescence and need to invent a
better wheel again and again and again. NVDA was on top for quite a while, but
there is not much to guarantee that ATI/AMD won't use the current situation to
regain some market and mind share. There is strong brand recognition in the
high gamer population, but the rest of the people could care less. And even
gamer population is fickle long term.

Just watching NVDA for now. Although it is arguably cheap.

Jayt: It's great to see somebody have any stock go UP in this market. Congrats
on a good call and sharing your idea here. I hope today's stock price does not
drift down or fall down as so many seem to do in this volatile market.

Regarding Bakken. I have several stocks of companies that have leases in the
area. I'm no expert in the oil business or knowledgeable about the Bakken to
where I can say each company is located compared to every other company. Or
whether one successful drilling operation can be presumed with any assurance to
be translatable to any other nearby area controlled by CLR or any other
company. Still, after your post I added a little more to BSIC and to ERF. BSIC
a dink dollar stock that's more of a gamble than most (I presume). ERF - at
least with this bet, you get the very good dividend yield. Which makes one
suspect that ERF might not have the capital resources to fund the exploration
of their properties. (I don't know.) So I suspect that ERF stock might not see
the capital gains of others. (Bakken only one part of ERF also) Offsetting
that, the good cash distribution from ERF might limit downside. I'd say dampen
volatility, but in this market, these high dividend payers 10-20% -- are almost
as volatile as anything else, it seems to me.

This stocks seems to be in "Value" area and if they maintain their dividend, it

I agree that financials are very scary. I remember a lot of people recommending
FRE and FNM over the years with the suggestion that they are government backed
and can't fail. Right now every one of FRE and FNM investors is under water
(OK, except 1991 investors ;)) and the ultimate outcome is unknown. I remember
looking at them numerous times and having no clue how to value them.

On the other hand, people who invest into financials that will survive this
downturn will get great returns. Of course, it is very hard to say who will
survive without huge dilution. I'll just ride Buffett's coattails on
BAC/WFC/USB/AXP and of course BRK/WSC. Note that BAC is possible the smallest
Buffett position and may not be really a "core" holding, so perhaps it should
not be counted as "Buffett approved".

CRDN is running up after their semi-equip company purchase. I am neutral on

Hi RWS - I own RAS but it is different than BDN or HRP as they have more
exposure to many of these CDOs and other debt obligation derivatives. To me it
is more risky but according to the companies most recent disclosure, the stock
is selling below it's tangible book value. Their BV is calculated a few
different ways so it's hard to tell exactly what the "true" mark-to-market
value is.

If the company has to write down another big chunk of their CDOs then the
current discount is not really attractive.

Just be careful to understand the overall risk of their portfolio and make any
buys accordingly.

Added to RCL - selling at considerably less than tangible book value and about
a 7 P/E on 2008 projected earnings, and is becoming less U.S.-oriented.

Purchased NXY which appears tremendously undervalued compared to current oil
prices - Merrill has a $61 Canadian target based on $70/barrel long-term crude
price.

Both of these generate significant cash flow from operations, and I easily

I see several analysts on TV and internet now saying they like CCL or RCL.
These two lines dominate the cruise business of course, and each has different
positive and negatives. I find that some analysts like one, others the other. I
say both stocks are undervalued.

As I understand it, these cruise ships are going out fully booked. People do
want their vacations; many have money budgeted for vacations, and cruise lines
offer a bargain in some respects.

I have shares in both companies, and I'll continue adding if/as they drop as
long as I don't hear any adverse news on their business prospects. (And if I
still have money left, which seems iffy at this point -g-) Perhaps with
airlines cutting back flights, and the pain of going through airports and
flying, maybe cruise business will suffer as people can't get to the ships or
won't be willing to endure the discomfort of airline travel to the ship
embarcation point. I do not know.

RCL trades at .63x stated book value (per Yahoo). Worst prior period in '01 and
'02 at .8 times. Are these stocks going to continue to fall to the point where
they trade at the ships' scrap values? One wonders.

I like NXY for its oil sands. And its North Sea: According to NXY: "Buzzard is
a world-class asset with more than a billion barrels of oil in place. It is one
of the North Sea's largest discoveries in 15 years and is expected to produce
approximately 200,000 boe/d (85,000 boe/d net to us) of high-margin production
at its peak." I hold a decent NXY position since 2005 (Wrongly bought in my
large IRA).

existing shareholders big time, or the fed takes them over meaning equity gets
wiped out and the fed runs the show which they are ill equiped to do. ok so My
guess is between the two of them they need to raise $15-20 billion in equity.
thats doable. only question is at what price. My guess is that if 30 banks and
investment banks chip in $500 million every body goes home a winner except for

AIB Group (Buy, Closing Price €7.60)
M&T Q2 results come in behind consensus

Analyst: Anna Lalor
M&T announced its Q2 earnings numbers yesterday. GAAP diluted EPS of $1.44 was
down 26% yoy and was 11% below the consensus mean of $1.622. However diluted
net Operating EPS of $1.53, although down 25% yoy, was 1.5% below consensus
adjusted EPS of $1.553. Net interest income was ahead 5% yoy, as average loans
and leases grew 14% yoy (including Q4 acquisitions). Deposits grew 6% yoy. The
net interest margin was down 28bps yoy to 3.39%, but was marginally better than
3.38% in Q108. Non interest income declined 4% yoy, with $21m decline in M&T's
portion of operating profit from Bayview Lending Corp (a privately held
commercial mortgage lender which has been affected by lower gains from
securitisations due to the CMBS market disruption, with the loss reflecting to
a large extent M&T's portion of severance costs). However, while this is
expected to continue to a lesser extent in Q3, M&T does not at this stage
believe that this business is permanently impaired. Expenses rose 7% yoy
leading the efficiency (or cost income ratio) to rise to 52.4%, from 50.2% in
Q207. The credit loss charge more than trebled yoy to $100m and net charge-offs
rose 4.5x to $99m and represented 81bps of average loans, compared to 20bps at
end Jun-07 and significantly up on 38bps at the end of Mar-08. The increase was
mainly due to the deterioration in the residential property market, with almost
40% of net charge-offs relating to residential developers and loans to builders
(up from 14% a year earlier), while net charge-offs from residential mortgage
loans and home equity loans (both largely affected by Alt-A loans) were
multiples of their Q207 levels. Non-performing loans amounted to 1.2% of period
end loans, compared with 0.68% a year earlier and 1% at the end of March. The
company believes that the Alt-A trends are stabilising, with a slight tick-down
in delinquencies over the last two months. However, it noted that 25% of its
c$2bn to residential home-builders is already in its criticised loan book,
while SME credit quality has started to deteriorate and is expected to continue
to do so. Tangible equity per share declined 1% yoy to $28.5. M&T accounted for
5% of AIB's PTP last year and is expected to account for 6% this year so any
changes M&T forecasts would only have a modest impact on our AIB earnings
estimates. M&T's shares fell 16% on yesterday following its earnings release.
Fitch changes outlook to Negative from Stable

Fitch yesterday changed its outlook on AIB from stable to negative, reflecting
"some uncertainty over the intensity and duration of the economic slowdown,
which could cause AIB's profitability and/or impaired loans to worsen more than
expected". This is not completely unexpected with the ratings agencies having
noted that any deterioration in the economic outlook for Ireland could see
changes to their outlooks for the banks. Fitch has reaffirmed its Long-term
Issuer Default AA- rating and it notes that a "good level of earnings should
make higher loan impairments manageable" and highlight's that AIB's current
ratings reflect its "sound profitability, good asset quality, limited market
risk and acceptable capitalisation". It expects to review the ratings of the

I added ACAS at 16.38 and won't buy any more until it hits 15, because I want
to get the purchase price back in dividends within 4 years.

Also doubled my FR at 24.83.

I've got order in for more ACAS if it'll drop back now to mid 16's. Somewhat
similar to you, I am looking for dividend in two years to cover 1/2 that stock
price.
