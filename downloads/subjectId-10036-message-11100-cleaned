Dumped my small GTSI position afterhours. Got $6.05 which is not bad from my
$2.72 buy price just 25 days ago.

News...value could reach as much as $857.2 million. Its being hyped like a big
dog. missed the $11 high, but I dont want to own it when the pump & dumpers get
done with it.
Looking to buy back around $3.50.

CEGE broke 30 today for about the dozenth time since i have owned it. i hope
this time it rallys up from here with the fall rally. LDP trying to break 20.
ALSC Seems mired at $25, and MRVC close to recent highs at $78. I took
positions in
ATHM and VOCL this week. VOCL is another of my business for free plays. it owns
a bunch of ITXC and has cash- on a combined basis that is more than the market
cap of the company last time i checked. Management quality is somewhat suspet
however. I purchased a small position because it looked like it had reach of
level of substantial technical support. ATHM is not quite as classic a value
play however the market cap seems quite reasonable at this level when you look
at the market caps of yahoo, and lcos, as compared to excite. and recognize
that athm will have almost a guaranteed pipleine into several million homes in
both us and europe. so it will have an additional revenue stream from providing
the service as well as additional advertising revenues via excite. At these
levels i really like my chances.

re: SPOR, GTSI

I was at the beach for a week and was horrified to learn that I couldn't dial
up the internet from the beach house. It was probably good for me, though.
Actually spent quality time with my wife.

So I get this call from a guy at the office Tuesday morning that GTSI had hit
9. I thought he was pulling my leg. Without the internet I had no access to my
accounts, but I knew I had to dump the thing. Immediately. I got a guy a friend
to log into my accounts and dump the GTSI. Got between 5 1/2 and 6 1/4 - that
bugger was all over the place that morning.

So here's a stock I bought at 4, sold at 7 1/2 the next day. Then bought again
at 2 3/4, sold half of at 3 3/4, bought it back at 2 3/4, and then sold all of
at about 6. Wow, what a stock. The reason it is so much fun to trade is that at
its lows it is deep into net-net range, and it seems to bounce off the same low
every time. Then you've got a management that loves to issue hyped press
releases. Plus it has a Linux angle, so the stock is on the screens of the
people who will bid a stock up 300% in one day and think nothing of it, then
sell it back to me again below net current assets. I can't wait for it to go
below 3 again. It will. Mike, did you ever buy this? I know it got as far as
your watchlist.

I also had a limit order hit on SPOR. Thanks for the heads up, rjm. I had
looked at this one at about 4 1/4, and thought it was a buy below 4. Then I
fell asleep (or I would have paid 3 7/8 instead of 3 1/4. I think I'll get the
chance to sell this one for 5 within a year.

I just wish I would have bought more GTSI.
But you know, when the shorts & the pumpers get finished with it, and toward
year end it may well fall to $3.
SPOR...I scaled into it last time, then scaled out..and have been scaling back
in.
Good news is they have authorized another buyback. Wont start till after the
10k comes out.(?)
I love the way they keep buying back stock but am a little perturbed at the
LACK of insider buying.
There was some last year but nothing since..

"TOMLINSON, ROBERT G. CB 50,000 B 7/19/99 $4.03 - 88,000 D 8/5/99
3. EVEREST, JAMES H. DIR 5,000 B 5/5/99 $4.75 - 40,000 D 6/7/99
4. NORICK, RONALD J. DIR 10,000 B 4/30/99 $5.31 - $5.16 - 63,167 D 5/20/99
5. EVEREST, JAMES H. DIR 10,000 B 4/29/99 $5.10 - $5.00 - 35,000 D 6/7/99
6. AUGER, STEVE S. TR 1,000 B 4/28/99 $5.06 - 1,100 D 5/11/ "

I understand they still keep in contact with the firm that was interested in
buying them so time ago so i suspect eventually they will get taken out.
From that perspective, I guess the share buyback means it may be awhile. They
cant be buying back stock if they are in talks can they ?
I keep thinking a big block is about to cross and they might mark it down to do
so. Other than not catching the exact bottom, I see very little risk here other
than "dead money" risk.

Sport-Haley (SPOR) fits a regular pattern for my net-net posts that those
watching me for the last few years will recognize. They almost always work very
nicely, and almost always within six months.

1) Below 2/3 of net working capital
2) Positive free cash flow (in this case VERY positive). A share buyback is a
bonus, and in this case a very big one.
3) Significant real estate assets outside of the net current asset valuation.
In this case we don't have that, but the share buyback makes up for it.

When you see a company trading at half of net working capital, you say "why
don't they just liquidate the thing and give the shareholders the money?" If
you study the balance sheet and cash flow statement of SPOR, you'll see
management is doing just that. The June quarter is usually their biggest in
terms of cash flow. I would guess that when the 10-K comes out, net working
capital will be even higher than in the latest financials. I think my exit here
is at about 5, probably in a management-led buyout. If that doesn't happen, its
hard to see much downside risk from this level.

Hi Jim:

Thanks for bringing SPOR to our attention.

Do you have any insight into those high inventory levels? Gosh, seems like 150
to 180 days worth. Of course, even if half of it is written off, still a strong
net-net indeed. Looks like much of the cash has come from reducing inventory
levels. Wonder if more reduction is in order.

I think it bears mentioning that they are having a bad year. If earnings turn

Found this commentary on Yahoo Board.

In the golf apparel industry it is not uncommon to have 6 months inventory on
hand. There are basically two seasons for the product, spring and fall (some
others, mostly high end do a holiday line). Most of the product is produced for
the merchandiser overseas (typically pacific rim and india) to his specs and
they purchase what they think they need for the season. The product gets
delivered by boat for the lowest prices. You don't want to get to midseason and
have to order 5000 pieces to fill an order, first of all it takes two months to
get here and it's too late or you fly it in and it costs you an extra $2.00
per.

Give credit where its due. Our newcomer rjm2 brought SPOR to our attention. If
this is the guy I think it is, I see him regularly on Yahoo and he is a very
savvy and bold buyer of net-nets. Hope to see more from him.

On SPOR, inventory is the story, though there is a whole bunch of cash in that
net current asset number as well. The company makes custom-embroidered golf
shirts. They got stuck with a whole season of inventory. What are year old
custom-embroidered golf shirts worth? Well, we're getting some idea because
they're liquidating them and getting good money. The company had the sense to
shut down production of new ones - i.e. when you find yourself in a hole, stop
digging. I don't know this for a fact, but common sense would tell me that
management isn't stupid. The inventory isn't custom embroidered. I'd think
they'd do that when they get the order, so I think the inventory is "blanks".
Do golf shirt styles change that much season to season? I don't think so.

Another issue here is you've got a family in control, with the son succeeding
the father. When I saw where the son worked before it nearly made me barf - he
was the marketing director for a company that was probably the worst investment
I ever made, about three years ago.

The size of the share buyback, and the impact of a share buyback at a valuation
like this, is what made me pull the trigger.

I will be buying another net-net aggressively on Tuesday and will post it after
I get my position.

Just noticed a little company called Ford Motors is yielding 8%. The stock has
been here before recently, and even a bit lower. We all know that auto sales
are probably coming off the mother of all peaks and they've got a little
problem with tires falling apart, but that's one hell of a yield on a blue chip
stock. I've never owned an automaker, and don't intend to unless the odds are
overwhelmingly in my favor. GM and Daimler Chrysler also look very very cheap.
Maybe "look" is the operative word there - I notice that Ford traded at way

Re: Ford

I was very lucky to have owned Ford over that period of time (the past five
years) and the investment has performed extremely well. I was always concerned,
though, about the inevitable cyclical slow down, which never occurred.

Recently I struggled in deciding to take the $20.00 per share cash dividend
completing the company's reorganization
(supposedly taxed at capital gains rates). I thought it might be a good time to
take some money off the table for a while although I am having some seller's
remorse with todays valuations. Five years ago the stock was yielding around 8%
and the pe was around 4.5x and, if I am not mistaken, the stock was trading at
a discount to book.

The balance sheet was dramatically transformed however. AFS (Associates
Finance) was spun off and recently VC (Visteon -- the auto parts manufacturer)
was also spun off. The company also shed $10 Billion off of its balance sheet
through its recent $20.00/share dividend.

Additionally, the company made large strides advancing its world
marketing/distribution strategy through purchases of Volvo, Jaguar, Range
Rover.

Nassar has proven his ability to out the underlying value of Ford Motor Company
that was dormant for quite a period of time. I was uncertain, given cyclical
turns and the restructuring and acquisitions how the company's performance will
hold up, so I opted for the $20 per share dividend.

Maybe fear from the Firestone crisis will provide extreme value opportunities.

I don't know about the timing to buy F, but I do know that I'm getting tired of
Ford making my taxes complicated.

After getting a spinoff of Visteon plus cash for fractional shares, and then a
special dividend that is not taxed like a dividend, both of these in one year,
gosh, I have no clue what the basis of my F stock is. Much less how to enter it
in Quicken.

Ford could try to be friendly to shareholders and give us a simple explanation
of how to figure out our cost basis after all this brouhaha, but they don't. If
you try to visit the F website for help in figuring it, you won't find any.
Other companies have done much better, after special events like this, in
explaining to shareholders how to calculate their cost basis.

I suppose Ford is distributing all this stuff to shareholders in an effort to
be nice to them. If you have a big chunk of F stock that's something to be
happy about. OTOH, if only a tiny part of your portfolio is in F, then it only
serves to make your life difficult.

Bottom line: if you decide to buy F, then buy it in a big way so that the
hassles are worth it.

Net-Nets.
I own & follow quite a few. I try to be a bit more flexable with them as I have
had quite a few turn out to be 2,3 & 4 baggers. So I do NOT follow the 50% gain
and sell it rule religiously.
Many of mine are very small caps which require patience & limit orders. The
good thing about these low float stocks is they can get pumped & dumped fairly
easily and that provides some good selling opportunities.
I was accumulating AVCC in the $1.12-1.50 range and last week it was pumped
like a big dog and they ran it to $5.75. That was near the top end of my 3 year
best case scenario so I was happy to feed the ducks. As expected, it quickly
fell back to earth ..$2 3/8.

I will list some of the net-nets I own and/or follow in case anyone wants to
discuss them further.

DIYH,EDIN,SPOR,FLD,EBSC,GISH,CRTN,SPZN,RCKY,JPSP,SIF,RAGS
NTRL,NATW,TMTX,MTIN,EZPW.

These kind of stocks have plenty of warts, else they wouldnt be priced where
they are.

Interestingly, DIYH, my largest holding, has thrown some cold water on my face
regarding the value of Inventory as well as off balance sheet liabilities. They
recently announced closing 2 more stores. This was expected. Where I was thrown
off was they are only going to net 64% of the wholesale cost of inventory in
those 2 stores. Also, a rather large liability was put on the pro-forma balance
sheet. This has lowered NCA a good bit and reduced what I thought was a really
large margin of safety. I still like the stock and believe it is undervalued
and I will make money. Its just not going to come from the NCA as much as it is
the real estate & buildings that they own.
Actually, I believe they will sublease the location and either end the lease
with a small payment to the landlord or offset the liability with sublease
income going forward. Also, they will sell and realize a GAIN on the owned
store they are closing.
Insiders continue to buy. Book value as per the 8-k was reduced to $4.22 per
share with $1.17 in NCA. They will pay off debt by year end and then, any
excess cash flow could be used for a buyback. Float is less than 2 million
shares.

An interesting real estate stock I own a lot of is HGPI.
Trades at just over a third of an understated book value.
Had a deal a few months ago (fell through) to sell 7 of their 13 outlet centers
for over $10 per share. That would believe it or not also generate a large tax
loss and they were planning on buying another business which would utilize the
substantial off balance sheet tax assets. Last I heard they were still working
on a deal to sell "several" of those 7 properties all of which they believe are
increasing in value. The remaining properties are also being marketed.
Insiders are restricted but have a history of being repeat buyers in the
past..even at higher prices.

And this from the latest press release does not sound like a company on the

Dr. Richard S. Post, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, ``As
previously announced, we see continuing strength in our OEM semiconductor
business, driven by the strength of our customers' businesses, the success of
our new products, and our progress in expanding our business internationally.
We have been working closely with customers over the last year to integrate our
products with their tools, and have succeeded in gaining 42 new design wins
which we expect will lead to continuing growth for our modular products. We are
increasing our R&D investments in ozone, RF and ASTRON to accelerate the
expansion of our OEM business.

``We are also accelerating our R&D investments in the systems business, adding
300 mm automation capability to the Nimbus tool for advanced packaging. We
believe that this investment will provide expanded opportunities for the Nimbus
in fiscal 2001 and help solidify the success of this tool in our markets.''

Dr. Post concluded, ``Fiscal 2000 has been our best year yet by far, and we
expect fiscal 2001 to be an excellent year, as well. We anticipate that our
significant R&D investments early in the year will lead to new business in the
second half. We are pleased that our strong financial position, which includes
$95 million of cash and investments, will enable us to continue to pursue our
expansion goals through internal growth as well as through potential
acquisitions and strategic partnerships, such as our recently announced
investment in Opnetics, a company developing Dense Wavelength Division
Multiplexing (''DWDM``) components and subsystems for optical networks.''

re: ANF. Its not like me to hold a stock that has doubled, but I went in at 11
with a price target of 25-30, then did the work to realize how conservative 30
was (when the stock was still at 15 or so). I still visit stores every week or
two to keep tabs on things. Its become a very large holding and I haven't sold
a share.

I was looking hard at GPS yesterday - great company down 50% from its high. I
think its in the range of fairly valued now. And it just blew my mind when I
thought of one thing - ANF is also 50% off its high - still! After analysis on
both stocks I concluded I consider ANF more attractive at 24 than GPS at the
same price. I would still buy ANF on a pullback if I didn't own it, and maybe
even if I do if its a pullback to 20. I think you will look back in 5 years and
the move from 11 to 24 could look like nothing. That said, I monitor it very
carefully. Not the stock price, the stores. I am not at all interested in
roundtripping this stock that has just made my year. GTSI was a double and LR
was a double from my second purchase, but they were tiny positions. ANF is now
about 19% of my personal holdings, and 40% of my baby's college fund.

Actually, if you want a portfolio you should follow, its my little 1 year old's
college fund. The kid has a long way to go and there's not much money in the
account yet. But so far Daddy hasn't given him a loser - he's like 7 for 7, up
about 50% year to date. If you've done college fund math, you know you want the
50% return in the last year, not the first year, but I'm not complaining. He
owns ANF, HBP, RAL and CMH. I'm about to buy another one for the little guy,
which I will disclose here after I accumulate the position. I think you'll like
it. And if you think the kid's a junior superinvestor (my wife vetoed the name
Warren...) his favorite word is cat. My wife thinks he's referring to the

James, I looked hard at ANF and GPS and came to a different conclusion.

Regardless of ANF's recent performance, I am not sold on their management and
inventory. It is more than likely that I missed the boat on most of ANF's
movement because they (IMHO) are reasonably valued.

Even with the distribution and Old Navy problems at GPS, they still are the
industry leader and deserve a premium much like Walmart. I have seen their
management react much better than ANF. In any case, my GPS position is really a
hedge against my wife's spending. I can only hope my profits can exceed her
spending at Baby Gap.

$5 1/32, since I saw the insiders buying. I am still under water, but it won't
take much at all to break even.

I know there are better stocks, and this one doesn't look great in all
categories. But jeez, is it a net net? Is it a value stock? Is it a problem?

I have not yet gotten into SPOR but it is on my watch list.

On a net-net basis it makes sense but I wouldn't want to hold it long. Also, it
is so close to new lows; at what price would your New Low Liquidation Law kick
in? Any movement at these levels is large on a percentage basis.

Just wondering - trying to refine my sell decisions.

I am a little late giving it to the board but I played BEBE at the summer lows

Good news on MAXS today.

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/000907/ma_maxwell.html

I made purchases after Jim suggested the company back last September. Shares
appreciated 41% since then. The value picks on this thread seem to be working.

I am still holding Blair. The company also reported good earnings last quarter
and I am thinking BL might continue to roll a bit.

I would say one of the large factors that keep me holding on to these stocks
even after they make a run is paying capital gains tax. When a business like
Blair or Maxes are begining to show good earnings, yet their valuations are not
yet to absurd levels, my tempted to continue holding and not settle for the
quick run up.

successfully bought out in lbo, now trying to buy bntt for 13.15 cash. Waxman
owns 44% of bntt and has agreed to tender. Their share of the cash will allow
them to pay off their most senior debt and they will submit plan bankruptcy
court to liquidate more junior debt at a discount. If merger goes through it
looks like waxman could come out of bankruptcy. Two years ago waxman is

Research Analyst: Christopher Conry (9/7/00)

Most investors prefer to buy stock in companies with solid business plans and
real earnings that don't carry outlandish valuation multiples. Others have a
soft spot for distressed stocks, especially ones poised for a big rebound.
When a stock's down 90% from its high, business prospects are fragile, Wall
Street is running for cover, and bankruptcy seems just around the corner - it's
the kind of contrarian play that catches an investor's eye. And the prospect of
capturing monster returns from a distressed stock's turnaround has an
undeniable allure.

Topic for discussion: Investing in a flat market.

The indexes have been up in the 20s in 1998 and 1999. 1998 was a pretty good
year for me, but I absolutely lost my shirt in 1999. I went about 12 months
where I could do absolutely nothing right, and plenty wrong. Fortunately I did
a lot of writing preserved on this thread and in my investing diary so I never
forget how frustrating that period was.

Since March it has just seemed very very easy to hit single after single, with
a few doubles sprinkled in there - and the big difference, no major losses. I
was so shellshocked after the past year that it took me a while to even notice
that things were getting easier. I have learned a few new analytical tools
since then, but fundamentally I don't think I'm doing anything terribly
different than I was doing last year (except I gave up shorting tech stocks in
early March - needless to say, that does not explain the turnaround).

I think many value investors gave up and went into tech (I guess by covering
shorts I bought the peak too) or just sold everything they had left in February
and March. I think this thread was a real asset then to help us all keep our
heads while everybody else was losing theirs. I don't think any regular
contributor to this thread gave in to the temptation in any big way. Anybody
who stayed the course has been richly rewarded in a flat market. This doesn't
feel like a bear market to me at all. If last year was a bull market and this
year is a bear market, I pray to God I never see a bull market again in my
lifetime.

I learned a lot in the last two years, but I don't think that accounts for 20%
gains this year in a flat market. Something really changed in my view.

The bigger question is this. And this is a question to the valued contributors
to this thread who are old enough to have watched the moon landing when I was
in diapers. IS THIS YEAR HOW VALUE INVESTING USUALLY FEELS OR IS WHAT i AM
SEEING NOW AS MUCH AN ANOMALY AS LAST YEAR WAS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION? THEY
SAY DON'T CONFUSE BRAINS WITH A BULL MARKET. COULD I BE CONFUSING BRAINS WITH A
BEAR MARKET? IS THERE ANY SUCH THING AS A "NORMAL" MARKET?

Great questions....

One thing I have noticed participating on the Anthony@Pacific site and around
on SI is that some of the very best traders have a chameleon like personality.
They change to reflect the fashions of the day. They are committed only to the
philosophy that works, not the one that is 'right'.

I'm the type that has worn blue jeans since I was a kid, and probably always
will. Sometimes I look great, other times way out of sync. I suspect you are
the same.

I can go so far as to apply my fixed mode of thinking to different areas, as
changing markets warrant. These days, that is clearly in the shorting arena.

IMHO this is similar to my own warped sense of thinking where as soon as I buy
an undervalued stock i want mr market to recognize that too and immediately
bring up to to a correct valuation. we can only buy undervalued stocks and hope
that the market recognizes it soon after we purchase the stocks but we cannot
control that. Sometimes it happens quickly sometimes not. Last year the
adjustment I am sure was slowed down by the tech bubble in the latter part of
the year. I fell for it too and unfortunately sold a very undervalued energy
situation that was stagnant. it subsequently outperformed all my other
holdings.
The good news is that you are up 20% this year and I am sure that you will
continue to do well but I wonder how much of that gain is due to amazon's
recent performence.<g>.

James, my wife brought home a photo album from her trip to my 39 year old
daughter. Who is that slim guy, could it be me? Believe me it is hard to
remember what kind of investment strategies I employed in the good old days.
However, I believe that value should be interpreted as good return for the risk
involved and that the strategy of outwitting other investors on the basis of
balance sheet analysis will have only mixed results at the best. Let me share
two examples of other strategies.
1) Arbitrage. I wish I could convince others to visit Mike's site. Only Paul
Senior and I seem to post and then not frequently. I have played the utility
mergers quite sucessfully this year and currently hold cg,fpc and mcn. For non
utility I like bocb. All of these situations are near maturity so the yields
may not support new positions. I wish I could get more interest on the
arbitrage thread.
2) Covered calls. This strategy gives you downside protection and an
opportunity for good yields. I like leaps against severely depressed stocks.
About two years ago I initiated positions in nsm,crus,coms,neta,esst, and madgf
when these tech darlings were severly depressed. If todays prices hold until
Jan 2001 I will have triples on all positions except madgf. As a current
example I took out position last month on lor by buying stock at 6 3/8 and
selling Jan 2003 leaps(strike 12 1/2) at 2 3/4. This is a triple if lor above
12 1/2 by Jan 2003. With all the option threads in SI none wish to discuss this
type of strategy because there is too much emphasis on get rich quick ideas.
Those are my thoughts and lets hope we can get more of a dialog on alternative
value strategies. Good luck.

HGPI...really a compelling real estate value. About $3.50.

What got me interested was the history of insider buying at prices even over
$5, and they KEPT buying. Then they hired an investment banker. Then they
announced a deal that later fell through. The deal was to sell just over half
of their properties, here were my thoughts posted at the end of march...before
the deal fell apart..."There are going to be closing costs and such which would
bring the net-net cash down to maybe $32-33 million after paying the related
debt off. That is to be divided by the FULLY DILUTED share count...nearly 3.4
million so it may be in the
$9.40-9.70 range net cash.
The gain on shareholders equity is expected to be in the $13 million range I
think. Its confusing because that figure might be for the corporations 83%
interest but the minority holders are convertable. So in any event, it brings
our reported book value to $13.70 ish or more again IF THE DEAL CLOSES.
As for the remaining properties, they are financed 3 on 2 different loans,
non-recourse. That means they could walk away from each group of 3 with no
recourse. He said the bank clearly thinks those properties are worth more than
they loaned. I dont know if this means they are worth what the balance sheet
values them for or not.
It sounds darn good and even though its not a done deal, I would have thought
the share price would have gone up more. I mean, a $13.70 book value with $9.50
in cash and a boatload of tax loss carryforwards would seem to be worth more
than $4.50.
I am holding. If the deal closes, I would expect the share to trade in the $8
range at least. If the deal falls apart, it might fall to $3.50. Risk/reward
seems favorable."

As it turns out, interest rates rose and the deal did not go through. And the
price fell. Well, shortly after the deal was announced a (now) 13-d guy started
buying...and KEPT buying....

Average Cost: $3.542 .

This is actually the second 13-d buyer. Its just a matter of time here IMO.
Remember, if the deal would have closed, this thing would have had about $9.50
per share in cash, the rest of their properties and a boatload on tax loss
carryforwards with which to use on whatever they spent the $ on.

Last I heard was they were working on a deal for "several" of the same
properties. I think there is a lot of money to be made here with very little
downside risk.

Comments ?

PS, yahoo has book value wrong as HGPI has some kind of limited parnership
arrangement such that one needs to use 3.4 million shares (fully diluted) out
to reflect the limited partners conversion to common. Actual book value is
about $9.80 but remember, they were going to book a big GAIN towards book value
on the sale. And, book a LOSS for tax reasons. Something to do with prior
accounting. A little confusing but worth the trouble to look into.

James,

My view is that the current environment is still an aberration of some sort. I
think some of it has to do with indexing becoming so popular and the rest has
to do with individuals that don't know very much trading for their own accounts
in large numbers.

I think the "buy any dip" mentality is still very much in place among the
latter.

What I've been noticing is that the "public" will buy almost any serious dip in
large cap blue chip stocks. (S&P500 members)

That will usually drive the price back up 20%, 30% or more quickly regardless
of the merits or fundamentals that caused the initial decline. Then, over time,
if the original decline was appropriate, they sink it again. Lucent is a good
example of that, but there are many others. One might say that "ignorance is
bliss" for a lot of traders that are playing the bounce.

On the flip side, small caps are getting little if any bounce regardless of how
well the company is doing.

So I think if you've been focusing on "real" good values among large caps
you've been doing better than is typically the case based on my experience from
the late 80s and early 90s. YOu've been getting the bounce almost immediately.

If you've been focusing on smaller illiquid companies you are having a tougher
time than is typically the case.

That's my observation and the way my own portfolio is acting.

James,

This year is so far going fine for me. Thanks to ANF,
a flip of GTSI, pharmas in 401(k) and furtunate flip
out of WCOM. I also sold LHO that I held since last
year and MAT (for loss). I also had one of long-time
ago mistake LEAPs expire worthless.

Otherwise, I am happy with my strategy and performance,
even though TSG and SYMC are currently under water,
and BRK is more-or-less flat.

Last year I had great 401(k) results due to surging
company tech stock. (Which I liquidated at the top -
but I also got stock options at the top, so there's
no big consolation). My portfolio results were so-so,
but not horrible. Had some luck with NKE. My worst
year was 1998, when I got caught on the wrong side of
CIEN-TLAB arbitrage and with worthless semi-equip
calls. Ouch!

So I can't really answer your question, especially
since this year our portfolios significantly overlap.
I can say that non-pharma part of the 401(k) is very
flat though.

I was going over the top holdings of Bill Miller in one of his Legg Mason funds
and found FINOVA (FNV)as a top holding. What a chart! Anyone know much about
this one? I think the p/e now is about 2.6. Is this going to be a turnaround or
a dead-in-the-ground?

In July, I and another person were accused of discouraging others (newbies)from
contributing. I decided to stop posting here because other peoples'
contributions and stock picks are likely to be much more valuable to me than my
own posts. That is, my own posts which deal with stock picks have little
utility for me in that they offer ME no new information. Whether they offer
anybody else any useful information is iffy. Right now I feel that my posts and
stock picks are mostly wasted. Doing my best work here seems stultifying. Can't
even be controversial or even in-your-face (which, imo, would go a long way to
improving all of our performances) anymore without people apparently yipping.
With my ego still bruised (-g-), I'd just as soon take from others what they've
got and be a lurker.

Some examples of mostly ignored stocks that shouldn't have been:
ANF gets mentioned over and over. And a good call it was/is too. But not so
much is said about Grommit's AEOS which at least a couple of us got in July @
13 (now 30). Armin mentions LDP at 21 as an undervalued play, but nobody here
wanted it when I was buying and posting last year when it was 60 points lower
(There was a 4:1 split.) I own all those shares and more - but I didn't see
anyone here getting interested in it then and I don't see any interest now. How
about Shane Milburn's ESRX? I got my shares @ 36 in May (now 74). Nike's been
discussed many, many times by a couple of regulars here and on Buffetology. Ah,
but it was Reebok that was the buy. Did anybody follow me on Dec 9, when I
posted I was buying? I'm in below 8 and still holding (now 21). If you bought
NKE then, you're under water. Anybody else here besides me still in JPM? LOL.
Okay I won't go there. (You had to have been on the thread in '96 when I
bought.) LauA's GAI was a winner. He's had a couple too. Nobody likes a 20% or
better annualized return on the Arbitrage thread? How many personal invites
does Allen Furlan got to give to get a response over there from some of you
guys?

And of course, speaking of ignored, I'm sure I've left out a few people who've
had some great picks that I've clambered aboard also. I apologize for leaving
such people and picks out of this post. (I'm referring to good picks that just
didn't seem to get the public accolade that picks of other posters here
get/got.) I've either forgotten such winning stocks, or more likely, wrongly
assumed they were my idea in the first place. -g- (Age does that to you.)

And, in my own case, although it's hard to see it from this post -- -g- I've
been wrong many, many times.

FNV is very interesting. Its late at night and my mind is not working that well
but the positives are that as far as i can tell there has been insider buying
throughout this price decline. on the negative side the bonds are selling for
.70 on the dollar but up from .60. the yahoo threads are enlightening in that
they point out that it looks like directors are holding out for too high a
price hence no sale likely right now and the window dressing period is upon us.
so it is unlikely that the fnv will go up before it heads further downward.
professionally i worked in credit and looked at finance companies at the first
job i worked at. I am a firm believer that you cannot know what is going on in
a company unless you look at the books and files yourself and see how the
company monitors its own borrowers. clearly this company has
been found wanting in this regard. the directors who have been buying most of
the shares may not be getting their hands dirty enough. I don't see how any
investor can get enough information on a company like this to make an informed
decision. if anything it may make more sense to look at the bonds as being the
safer play here. Good luck.

First of all - please post your suggestions. I *always*
check the stocks posted on this thread and appreciate
all suggestions. I don't respond with "yeah,

Second - yeah, I may have missed on your spectacular

liable to miss some winners, so what's the big deal.
If you got them all, more power to you.
(I already mentioned that I *should* spend more
time on my 401(k) mutual fund selection and not
on the free-standing portfolio. But that's a
separate topic.)

Third - yes, I am interested in LDP now, although
I wasn't XX points below. So what? I am interested
in MSFT, LU, BRK and others now, although
I missed them XXXXX points ago.

Have fun

Paul, please start contributing again, at least for my sake (!).

I do recall seeing accusations leveled here which accused the 'regulars' here
of being a bit too clubby. While there was a faint element of truth to it
(after all, each thread has its own 'atmosphere', the result of the blending of
the personalities of the 'regulars'), I did not and do not feel that it was a
"closed" thread in any manner (and this is in spite of the fact that I
personally took some shellacking over my suggestion of certain "value-based
shorts"). About the worst I think the thread could be honestly accused of being
is just the *tiniest* (and I do mean *tiniest*) bit too orthodox (by this I
suppose I mean "too strictly Grahamian"). Provided that a newcomer approached
the thread with an open honest desire to learn and the most minimal amount of
deference, I think the thread has been pretty open and accepting (though I
suppose it has perhaps done more ignoring of good ideas than it should have
done, as Paul has illustrated).

As a very regular reader (but fairly infrequent contributor) here, I suppose I
am at as much fault as anybody in letting the quality and diversity of
discourse here slip. When a seasoned regular (e.g. Paul Senior), or even more
importantly a totally new poster, puts forth a seemingly sound stock idea for
consideration, and I and others don't do our own independent research into it,
following up to the thread with either an affirmation of the original idea or a
well-researched critique of its weaknesses, then I suppose we are letting the
thread down. Of course it's neither necessary nor desirable to do this with
every idea here, but unless "semi-lurkers" such as myself keep the thread's
idea mill churning at critical mass (either by putting forth new ideas
ourselves, or giving some of the ideas of the more regular posters some good
stress checks), then this thread'll go to sleep and die.

And that would truly be a horrible thing.

All I can say about ldp is better late than never. I've always appreciated your

been going into ldp, on which i expect to do much better than 20% annualized. I
dont begrudge anyone for not investing stocks i mention. everyone has their own
personal circumstances, industry preferences and risk parameters.
I am leery of arbitrage because I can't tell when or what is likely to make the

Personally I think its the right thing to post your own picks if you benefit

KDUS is maybe a pink-sheets stock now, trading around $1.25. It just won an
appeal in the Federal District Court of Appeals reversing a jury verdict
against it in a patent infringement case.

About 13 mil. shares O/S and between $1.50 and $2/sh in cash, most of which was
in escrow awaiting the result of the appeal (probably will sit there for a
while until the appeal becomes final). They also have royalty income and a
large loss carryover. Carl Icahn owns 25%. Think the price range over the past
couple years has been about 9 cents to about $20!

Someone take a look (takes about 15 minutes of reading the last 20 posts or so

10Q showed a book value of $16.07/sh and a net current asset value of $7.93/sh.
Doing a little math and assuming they get their full allotment those figures
increase as follows. At a full buyout at a minimum of $4.50/sh BV= $19.37/sh &
NCA= $8.92/sh, at $5/sh BV= $19.23/sh & NCA= $8.77/sh, at $5.50/sh BV=

On EBSC, the market is saying that the price will be better than $4.50. In my
opinion, if the 13D holders do not tender it almost certainly will be better -
"micromayvin" on Yahoo, one of them, says they will not. Another reason that I
think it will be more than the minimum is my hunch that the typical kind of
buyer in EBSC does not want to take a loss. There just has not been that much
stock traded under $5 and change.

Best value play of the next 12 months = Insurers (Non-Life):

http://www.lbcapital.ckt1.com/pov__insurers_(non-life).html

IT IS ALWAYS DARKEST BEFORE DAWN

And dawn is here! The highly-cyclical insurance industry has finally broken the
shackles of 14 years of underwriting doldrums. Recent news of strong
improvements in commercial lines pricing are the first sign that the industry's
boom/bust cycle is finally turning up. This follows the worst year and worst
quarter -FY1999 and Q1 2000, respectively – that insurance stocks have faced in
a decade.

THE EVIDENCE

The tide started to turn in March, with news of double-digit rises in P&C
commercial line renewal rates. This strength accelerated into May and June,
culminating in a fabulous July. Industry sources are noting that January 2001
renewal rates will be even more impressive, as a lot of business needs to be
renewed at that time. The overwhelming majority of companies in the industry
are becoming wildly enthusiastic about a continued acceleration in rate
increases.

The segment exhibiting the greatest strength has been reinsurance. Several
bellweathers have boasted of 50% workers' comp and 100% retrocessional renewal
rates, and that's not to say that other RE lines are not recording double-digit
renewal increases as well. As of late, RE stocks have been rewarded
accordingly. The Bermuda-based entities have done exceptionally well.

Virtually all P&C companies, from the insurers and the reinsurers to the
brokers, are forecasting a continued 'hardening' in all lines, as renewal rate
hikes continue (in every region no less). In addition to renewals, new business
is starting to be written at increasingly favorable terms. While the upturn
there is not of the same magnitude, it is indeed a highly encouraging sign.
Strength begets strength.

Now, due in large part to cutthroat competition and excess capital within the
industry, two key factors which caused premium rates to fall for so many
consecutive years, industry officials believe that, at the current pace, it
will take at least five years for rates to return to acceptable levels. We
therefore believe that the upswing in the cycle will yield us a good trade or
two for at least the next few years. All aboard!

WHY THINGS ARE CHANGING

Recent heavy reinsurance losses appear to have triggered the price turn, as
reserves have finally begun to be consumed off of company balance sheets.
Additionally, one can argue that the early Q2 slide in the equity markets did
indeed contribute to recent premium hikes, as insurance company balance sheets
are far more exposed to equities than at any other time in history. That period
of equity market turmoil marks exactly when the premium hikes began. Insurance
companies favored Growth & Income stocks, all of which got hammered. Thus,
their reserve levels needed to be replenished! In our view, contrary to popular
belief, the insurance industry has, for some time now, been reserve deficient,
not only cash flow negative. Thus, P&C companies have decided to get their
houses in order over the last six months. The slide in the equity markets and
subsequent weakening in industry financial strength was the last straw.

So the cycle has turned, eh? Well, what else is industry data telling us? For
P&C insurance, middle market commercial, as a component of revenues, is
currently exhibiting the most strength. For the REs, the strength has been
across the board. Furthermore, in every segment, retention rates are good.
Globally, the international outlook has followed the U.S.'s lead. It is now the
case that the very same turn in the non-life environment has began to be
witnesses abroad. Bottomline - the fundamental backdrop is now in place for
increased profitability in the industry, and recent data suggest that, compared
to 1999, this year's results are beginning to look like nothing less than a
seachange.

THE STOCKS ARE LOOKING ATTRACTIVE!

Many P&C stocks are up big this year, having bounced sharply off of the
five-year lows of early March. The trigger was the famous 'cyclical rally' in
the latter half of March 2000, when every sleeping value stock on the NYSE,
from John Deere to CIT Group, was rudely awakened from their slumber by
stunning events in the derivatives markets. Specifically, a very large
institution had previously used the futures market to long the Nasdaq and short
the S&P 500, a trade in which they are simply betting that the Naz outperforms
the S&P. the trade was incredibly profitable for the first three months of
2000, so the institution decided to close it out – two days before a triple
witching expiration. The effect on the market was enormous. The media,
misinformed as always, ran stories trumpeting that 'investors' have soured on
growth stocks and were now hunting only for value stocks. Needless to say, the
lone stocks which have not gone back to their pre-insanity week levels are the
insurers and other financials. Insurers have in fact been the stronger of the
two.

P&C Insurers St. Paul (SPC) and Chubb (CB), Diversified Insurers American
International Group (AIG) and Allstate (ALL), Reinsurers XL Capital (XL) and
Partner Re (PRE), and Insurance Brokers Arthur J. Gallagher (AJG) and Aon
Corporation (AOC), bellweathers of their sectors, are all up huge since that
fateful week in March. Keep an eye on St. Paul - their captain, Douglas
Leatherdale, stands to make a killing should the stock rise another $10 (part
of an unusual performance-linked package granted upon the 1998 USF&G merger).
St. Paul is already over 100% off of its March low. We have a feeling that
after third quarter results, the stock will smash through the Leatherdale level
an continue into the $60-range. Out top picks are SPC, XL, NY Marine and
General Insurance Company (NYM) and Navigator's Group (NAVG). NYM and NAVG,
smaller plays which are into marine and aviation insurance, are especially
attractive at current levels. Rates are up handsomely in aviation, primarily
due to recent catastrophes, and are sharply higher in marine, due primarily to
strength in the shipping industry. While information is hard to come by with
NYM, we also like the stock as a takeover target. In addition, we like
Diversified Insurer CNA Financial (CNA) as a takeover target. Abroad, we like
Zurich Re and ING.

IS PERSONAL AUTO NEXT?

It is interesting to note that the turn in P&C was not entirely a surprise –
industry executives were talking about possible premium hikes over nine months
ago. Now they have backed up their words with actions. So, what are they
talking about now? Personal P&C premium hikes! Starting with Auto! We are
looking for the hikes to start at year-end. The best play? Allstate, which is
already well over 50% off of its March low. A higher risk play on a rebound in
auto is Progressive (PGR). They have had their share of execution problems, and
they are prone to disappointment, but the potential upside makes the stock
attractive on a relative basis.

We will close this POV with this little tidbit, as if you need another reason
to start buying the P&C group aggressively: You already know they are still
relatively cheap, but did you know that the insurance group has an EXTREMELY
low correlation with the Nasdaq? Were talking a dream beta! Now what better way
to hedge your portfolio, already overstuffed with B2B garbage?

Re, ebsc. Have not yet received proxy, but quick reading on edgar filing
indicates that an acceptance of cut off price is available(equivilent to
offering at 4.5). IMHO all shares required by the tender will be offered and
the price will not exceed 5. Since Mr. Market has such disdain for department
stores I would expect stock to drop somewhat from that price, therefore anyone
buying now may not get any appreciation of their purchase price versus a
weighted post tender value. However I plan to buy more shares after the tender
because the recent events on this stock are bullish in the long term.
Re, fnv. This company mentioned recently. I increased my position by adding a
covered call position at 6 1/8 net of the October 7 1/2 calls sold against the
stock. Also note this stock has takeover rumors and a buy out is not illogical.
If this occurs and a cash offer is made, selling covered leaps is a great
strategy since the long term options collapse under such a merger.

rjm2, re gtsi. Good show on the profitable sale. I guess it proves a theme
often heard on this thread that when you get your price get out. I had gtsi on
my buy list just prior to the up spike. In your opinion is the retrenchment
primarily due to the competitors lawsuit on the big contract? If so I may get
in during this opportunity. Bitter grapes lawsuits are almost a sure thing in
large competitive contracts. My concern would be that their potential profit on
DOD sales might be so razor thin that the company will not be very profitable.

DIYH update...
Spoke with the president friday. I found out the 64% of inventory figure
includes all selling expenses in the liquidation. Rent,and payroll too.
So, its not as bad as I originally thought. It actually bodes well for the p&l
going forward.
This conversation, he sounded very "guarded" so I could not get any more info
regarding how the subleasing is going or the sale of the owned facility.
It almost makes me think some kind of "extraordinary" transaction might be
ahead. It might just mean he is tired of me calling !

I would not be surprised if they tried to take this sucker private. Could
probably steal it. Hell, there are NO outside directors to even represent the
outside shareholders though.

I still suspect there may me tax loss selling on this one for the rest of the
year. But long term, I am optimistic, there is just TOO MUCH value here to
lose.

I see positive to flat cash flow from ongoing operations going forward...on a
12 month basis anyway. Meanwhile they continue to tweak their merchandise mix
and increase gross margins.
But, I admit that after 2 more quarters of god-awful SSS numbers, I am thinking
they will be much better by comparison. Not flat, but maybe single diget
decreases.

But who knows, maybe the worse it gets the sooner this thing is closed up and
shut down.

Does anyone have any experience with a public company going private with NO
outside directors ? They would have to get someone to vouch for the fairness.

I might go away quietly for a $2.25+ X-mas present !

When I bought in the first time I knew nothing about that contract. When the
news came out...the daytrader "easy money" mentality came into the stock so I
sold. So I knew it would come back as the easy money folks sell out in disgust
and for tax loss selling. The news simply made it happen sooner. It could fall
more, I have buy orders in in case it does. If the contract falls through, the
ASSETS are still there..and thats why I bought in the first place.

The 13-d industry insider is just icing on the cake.

But, I have a sell order in waiting at $5 31/32 in the event the daytraders
come back ! I love volitility in value stocks.

Re: EBSC

Jeffrey:

I was reading the offering circular last night for the self tender and was
wondering whether you were continuing to hold EBSC and what your thoughts were.

FWIW, I think Mr. G's next move will be to ease, and that may set up a rally.
Looking at EK after the carnage, still looking at ASO. INTC, though not a value
play, might be worthy of consideration, though I don't own it.
Good luck to all - this is a very tough, merciless market. In the "old" days
(5-6 years ago!) they would have punished the likes of EK for a warning, but
more on the order of -10%. Not the -25% pounding it received today.

Also Re: EBSC,

I too was reading my offering circular, and while the Board is taking pains to
say to shareholders "it's up to you to decide", I did note that "no directors
and executive officers" (except the axed president) will be tendering their
shares.

Now what I have not yet been able to figure out is whether PPM America (13%
owner, and the catalyst for this action) will tender?

David, on EBSC, note my recent posts on Yahoo. My overall view is that this is
a mediocre company, which is adequately discounted at $4.50. If they buy the
stock at $4.50 they use up less cash and add more value for the remaining
shareholders. Therefore, I do not feel too uncomfortable continuing to hold it,
in lieu of receiving $4.50. On the other hand, I would definitely take $6.
Therefore, I will probably tender at some price in between. (Of course if one
of the largest holders wants to get out at $4.50, that will most likely then be
the price - although they would be taking a large loss.)

Insiders own very little stock so them not tendering is nothing to jump up &
down over. I thought I read that Synder & PPM both planned to participate but
did not specify a price. They got access to material non-public info back when
they shopped the company all over the street and the best they could come up
with was $5.25 non-firm.
So these guys will be selling at a LOSS despite the value.

That worries me.

p. 18 of the 18-Sep-00 offering document: directors and executive officers own
803,450 shares, or approx. 5.39%. While $3.6M doesn't seem like chump change to
me, I do see your point.

Snyder & PPM ... got access to material non-public info back when they shopped
the company ... the best they could come up with was $5.25 non-firm. So these
guys will be selling at a LOSS despite the value.

I think your last sentence here is wrong -- could you re-check it and get back
to me if you figure out which one of us is wrong?

p. 5 of the document details this (believe it or not, I missed this on my first
read!). Since both PPM & Snyder, once they were in possession of this "material
inside information", decided that they were not interested in $5.35, I would
assume that they'd probably not tender in this $4.50-$6.00 tender offer.

I can't remember where I read it, but I seem to recall some statement
attributed to Snyder that he felt the min. value of EBSC was ......(over $9,
perhaps?) and that he didn't feel like accepting anything less (as I recall
Snyder Capital or whatever it's called owned a lot of EBSC). Anyone remember
seeing something like that, or am I dreaming it up? TIA

Insiders (less Muscovich) directly own 351,000 shares (this figure EXCLUDES
options which are out of the money anyway).
In relation to the $4.67 million or so that Fred has earned in total the last 3
years for runing the company into the ground, the 351,000 shares becomes
awfully minisule.

Synder & PPM both indicated that they would not be interested in a SALE
transaction at $5.25...but keep reading...they indicated they would be in favor
of a self-tender or repurchase program and Synder INDICATED THEY WOULD
PARTICIPATE in a self-tender and PPM indicated they would "likely" participate.

An example would be...I believe that HGPI is worth in excess of $12 per share.
I would be opposed to a buyout offer at $6 per share, and yet, I sold a small
amount of HGPI today at $4.72. Just because I lowered my exposure does not mean
I would be willing to sell my entire position at $4.72. In fact, I own a larger
$ amount of HGPI now than I did when I brought it to this board 3 weeks ago at
$3.56.
I was surprised nobody here was interested.
