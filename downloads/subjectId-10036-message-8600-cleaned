MOO, you are saying value investing feels like it's not working for you? I say
that feeling is normal. Buying and holding damaged goods (and, -g- for dented
cans- eating the stuff inside) - and doing it over and over again - that is an
uncomfortable proposition. (As opposed to buying growth stocks where you get a
lot of positives - analysts, media, posters--- -g-as long as such stocks
continue to rise).

If you are saying that "your" value investing is actually not working for you,
you might think of changing your style/methods. For example and for
consideration, it seems to me that every one of the stocks mentioned in '97 or
'98 and bought by three different posters on this thread has been profitable.
(Although it's true there weren't that many stocks-- I think about 6 or so
stocks that got agreement from 3 people.) Kind of early to conclude about 1999
(the stocks may take more than a calendar year to work out), but SLOT, CYM
which fit the category (3 thread buyers) have been good this year, MAXS is
about holding its own, LKI --oops I see it's actually up today- higher than
when it was talked/about bought by posters (mid Aug). Maybe there are others
having 3 poster buys. Don't recall. Food in this section of on-sale grocery bin
seems to be very tasty and safe though!

Conversely, I hold a couple large-cap stocks (eg: TYC) that are doing well but
I just don't watch them with the intensity that I do the smaller companies. I
realize that this is behavioral and that my portfolio (and stress level) could

Still, I owe a great deal to the discussions of this thread which led me to

Terrapin: re: "After all, didn't I pursue value investing so that I could sleep
soundly at night with a margin of safety?!?" LOL! Right! Lot of stock
performance seems to improve if a person almost treats some stocks with benign
neglect (i.e. ignores the stock for much of the time.) Especially for some of
the growth or GARP stocks.

Very strange, eh? Value investing is based on fundamental analysis. While that
means different things to each investor, the foundation for everybody is
analytical, reflective and logical -- as opposed to emotional, intuitive, and
reactive. We even have the quantitative, formulaic value investors who
purposely try to leave out any emotional aspects to investing in the buy and
sell decisions. But as you indicate, this is not possible. We are each a
prisoner of our emotions. And so logic just does not apply sometimes. Because
logically, for an example, if you are up 60% with value stocks in today's
market, then you "should" feel that value investing works very well for you.
There's really no way out of this feeling thing. Other than to realize it and
go on. That is why "investor know thyself" is a good mantra. What I try to
remember to tell myself is to keep investing based on my experience, not on my
emotions. In other words, if you're making 60%, keep doing what you are doing
regardless of the overall feelings you have for doing it.

Bringing Dr. Graham in to the picture, I don't recall anything about his saying
value investors get a good night's sleep. All you get is a margin of safety.
Dr. Graham had at least one mistress. Perhaps that diminished or alleviated any
sleeping problems he may have had. (I'm not recommending this as a solution.)

All just my opinion, (even if I was a professional organizational development
consultant in my last reincarnation, and I do think the touchie-feelie stuff is

And returning to stock picking, fwiw, I added today to my small position in
steel mill and metal fabricator, LTV Corp (LTV). Stock is at a new yearly low.
(Sales and earnings are down.) At $5/sh, we have tangible book value of $15 --
okay,okay steel company book value- we know what that implies -g---but also,
LTD/eq. is .2 (but will increase) and trades at under 3x cash and 4.3xEBITD.
Interesting thing to me is that LTV itself has a market cap of $500M but they
are buying Copperweld Corp. for $650M and another co. for $114M. From somewhere
in all that there may eventually emerge booked profits. LTV has often traded
between 10 and 15 (but not recently) since it emerged from bankruptcy. I expect
it will trade there again within the next couple of years. (Although I've been
disappointed in my expectations many, many times before.)

Also, FWIW, I'm trying to add to my small position in Catellus Development
Corp. (CDX) if the stock goes under 11 (yearly low). CDX is a real estate
developer (not a REIT) with large California land holdings, especially Mission
Bay in San Francisco and Fremont (Silicon Valley). Analysts say this stock is
worth more than $22. I am dangerously relying on reports of others both as to
the underlying value as well as to the several fund managers who have said they
own this stock (Cooperman, Whitman, Gabelli).

OT. And FWIW. I have taken a very small position in non value stock Quintiles
Transnational (QTRN). Lot of negatives. Disappointing sales and earnings,
insider sales, subsequent lawsuits. QTRN does research and sales for
pharmaceutical companies. QTRN is the big gorilla in its business. Stock at 17
is selling near a 4 year low. Outsourcing trend in pharmaceuticals (as well as
in everything else apparently) will likely continue (imo), and as the dominant
company (imo) QTRN ought to be able to grow and be profitable. And the stock
should recover. Of course, in the short term, the stock could continue on its
present downward trend and then stay there for some time also.

MIKE MOO: Every business has ups and downs, triumphs and screw-ups, is at one
time adored and another hated. As value investors we tend to look for events
that trigger overreactions that put decent companies into favorable price
range. If this were Dec 1974, Aug 1982, or Oct 1987, virtually all companies
would be in that favorable range. But after an historic bull run that has
valuations of many companies discounting Nirvana, it takes a negative event to
drive the price to bargain range.
If you had bought Coke in the early 80's after the New Coke fiasco [arguably
the dumbest marketing move ever made because it put at risk what would come to
be recognized as the most valuable brand franchise in the world], you would
have made out rather well. If you had bought in mid 98, when everyone knew it
was the best managed company on the planet, you'd have taken a bath.
Your point about catching investment salmonella with bargain buys is well
taken, though, because the internet has the potential to permanently alter
business models. Thus, in previously stable areas where you could have bought
on a bad quarter, it's critical to ask if some discontinuous innovation might
be about to take over the market.
An important key to being successful in investing is to choose a style that
fits. I like to shop for bargains at the grocery store and the stock market so
value investing suits me fine, but others, not keen on bargain hunting, will be
more successful buying growth or momentum. Do what fits you.

There isn't much of a market for Beanie Babies these days, but American Girl

<<The trick in buying fashion is to know what will last and what will not. In

sophisticated investor to know>> So true. IMO technology could be substituted
for fashion in the above statement. For every Microsoft there's several Novell,
Wordperfect, Wang type fallen angels and bunch's of promising wannabe's that
never delivered on the promise. The share price is a forecast of future
prosperity or decline. When that forecast discounts incredible prosperity...a
multi-year period of hypergrowth as it does in many tech stocks today, it is
suspect. When the forecast, if for a basically sound business that's hit a
rough patch, is to decline or perform way below long term trendlines for a
multi-year period, it is also suspect.
With the potential for profitable business models to be attacked from multiple
directions via the net, it's necessary to look hard at both optimistic and
pessimistic price/forecasts before taking short or long positions respectively.
Research by Dreman and others has shown that news/developments that support the
prevailing concensus/trend have modest affect on share prices, but
news/developments contrary to prevailing trend/concensus can produce dramatic
price moves in the other direction. In other words bad news tends not to be as
hurtful to beaten down value stocks, but can slaughter a high flier [Although
not so much in a market emotionally predisposed to a cheery view--but this
optimism isn't permanent] Conversely good news can really boost a beaten down
stock, but offer little help to one where expectations are already sky-high.
Given a mix of positive/negative news/developements [Not really predictable]
low expectations stocks should outperform. Recent market inclinations haven't
been as supportive of this view as longer term studies suggest, but market
moods and fashions, like the fashion oriented businesses mentioned in the above
quote, tend to be unpredictable and to shift unexpectedly.

Re: WILCF, CTZ.

Yes, from reading your link and scanning the Yahoo msg. board, I think WILCF is
worth a flyer. Price seems very low indeed. Perhaps because it's a foreign
company. One might expect that being a large (for Israel)food importer (and
exporter), the business volumes and profits would be sustainable. Maybe
expanding as the Israeli standard of living increases. Caviar for all the tech.
millionaires! Stock looks like it's been at much lower levels; maybe it will
drop there again. I'd say though, for a "reasonable" holding period (maybe
couple of years), stock could "easily" double or more.

re: Grocery stores. I've been watching Albertson's (ABS) also Koger (KR)and
Safeway (SWY). Waiting for better bargain on ABS. Maybe WILCF is the better buy
now.

CTZ. Yes, acquiring company (FNF)stock is down where I believe deal could be
cancelled. But FNF has a stock buyback plan in place (that might lift the stock
price), and the regulators will consume some time in the deal (perhaps a
negative too - they need to approve a combination that will have 30% of the
title market), but the time will give some leeway for FNF stock to maybe move
up. The entrepreneur running FNF is controversial imo; perhaps this might be a
factor. He has lots of ideas and several business ventures. Lots of money made
by him- not so much maybe by his company investors . As discussed in Forbes,

I have a question for you guys. I have received info that a now public company
is attempting to go private. Their stock price has been in a precipitous
decline because of recent losses due to expansion. Insiders own at least 45% of
the company.

My question is, what determines the buyout price if it does indeed go private?
Is it a vote of shareholders, and thus if insiders own over 50% they
essentially have say in what the buyout price is?

What happens if you feel the business is trading at < 50 cents on the dollar,
you buy a small number of shares and hold out for what you feel is a reasonable
price?

Is your fate determined by whether the owners have less than or greater than
50% of the company?

the following argument among other things:

"...... the current level of stock prices has unrealistic macroeconomic
implications regarding the future share of
corporate profits in GDP unless one assumes that there has been a sea change in
long run price-earnings ratios.
By not cutting off the stock market boom, the Fed has in effect gambled that
there has been a sea change."

premium, said that is too much, and sold NH at $17. I think Mike did too.

I agree with what you said but would put it differently. I see mergers of
similar companies where the acquirer is paying a much higher valuation on the
acquired company than its own stock is selling for as
a transfer of hard assets to the target's shareholders in exchange for good
will. That goodwill, in this situation, is only good for its full value when

Armin. Inventory Yield & WFMI. I have a position. Positives you probably
already know: specialty chain, room to grow, vitamin/health concept, building
internet presence, high profit margins compared to big chains, building their
in-store brands too. Negatives: others can come in. For example Central Market
right in WFMI's Austin, TX home. (I will likely make a trip to Austin to see
this concept -- and eat BBQ at Louie Mueller, the best (brisket, of course) in
the US-- but that's another story -g-) For a nice write-up on Central Market
(owned by HEB, a private co.)see article in 4/99 Fast Company Mag.

What's caused me to trim my full position is the short argument as explained by
Herb Greenberg (TheStreet.com). Which is a financial aspect I just don't know
enough about: inventory yield..."which some short-sellers view as the single
most important warning of trouble...Inventory yield is calculated by taking
gross profit, subtracting payables and dividing by inventories." For WFMI, he
reports that inventory yields have been declining for two years.
Also he notes declines in inventory turns, ROA, and ROE.

I have not heard of this inventory yield metric or of its importance before.
What do you guys make of it? (the metric that is, not my ignorance of it)

The stock has declined, while its competitor stock, OATS, is doing much better.
I made my analysis based on psr. I realize some of these "gourmet" items they
sell remain on the shelf a while, and there's plenty of expensive "gourmet"
food spoilage. But I thought if they are getting the store traffic, they are
expanding, and that if their price to sales were low enough vis-a-vis the big
chains and OATS, the stock would be a good investment. Sure seems like OATS
would have been the better buy though in retrospect - OATS moving way up to new
high (too high perhaps) while WFMI approaching yearly lows.

Still I like WFMI and will add more if it does get to new lows. Debt/eq same as
OATS (and both have lower ratios than a couple of the large "mainstream"
chains) Psr is half that of OATS.

Inventory yield on WFMI is an interesting issue.

A negative example here would be where the trend toward buying this kind of
product is deteriorating, but sales and earnings can be maintained by
inventorying more product lines. This reduces inventory turns, ROA, ROE and
inventory yield. In this example, this won't work forever, if the negative
trend to the products continues. (I don't have any idea whether this is
actually what is going on with WFMI.)

Using my rather dim memory of my days in the buyout business, I think that
public investors can be forced out only at percentage private ownership higher
than 50%.

The number varies by state of incorporation. I seem to remember that Delaware
was 80%, but not sure at all. Usually, a buyer-outer will make a tender offer
for all of the shares not already owned. Of course, not all the shares are
tendered. Lots of people just throw away their mail, etc. Then they get on the
phones to remind folks. The offer has to be high enough that they buyers will
garner sufficient shares to effect the forced merger.

The forced merger is how all of the remaining shares are brought into the fold.

I don't have the answer but I am in a similar situation (a shareholder in a
public company going private).

One of my value favorites, CNSO (Conso International), is being bought out by a
group sanctioned by management at a nice premium to the current market price
but still well below what the business is worth. While I'm making an acceptable
profit, I am disappointed because I think someone else is going to benefit much
more over the next couple years, once recent investments begin to pay off.

In CNSO's case, management already owns a significant stake and isn't selling,
just forcing public shareholders to sell out to a private investment group
(albeit at a premium).

I recall Wayne Crimi had a situation with Sbarro which may more resemble yours,
where mgt was buying out the company at a low price. Management is supposed to
act in the interest of all shareholders, but I don't know how strictly these

The the surrounding Hill Country is excellent for driving vacations and seeing

Inventory Yield. Thanks Jeffrey. Helps clarify a little. I just can't seem to
get a grip on this metric. But if increased inventory yield is a leading
indicator of poor stock performance and it also means at the same time reduced
ROA and ROE figures, those metrics I do understand (somewhat) and are easily
found, calculated, and compared. Inventory turns are fairly easy to understand
and calculate too.

Of course, given my way of investing-- lots of companies over diverse
industries, it's very much expedient for me to have and to see ROA and ROE
figures through internet financial data providers. Perhaps, for stocks like
WFMI, which really are not value stocks (more like GARP imo), I'll have to
consider keeping these additional metrics (inventory turns and inventory yield
if I could understand it). For value stocks, I'll stick with Graham and my past
experience. Doesn't seem necessary to go beyond ROE and ROA. What do you think?

I think there are some wonderful buys out there myself they are just not value
plays exactly- My favorite one right now is called Ortel. Ortel is not
profitable right now but they just reported that they are moving toward
profitability faster than expected and their stock is up about 50% in the past
2 days. They are in the field of fiber-optics but what is most interesting is
that they have an 18% interest in a privately held company which is made up of
some old Bellcore division, the other investors are very high powered I believe
INTEL is one. That subsidiary is called Tellium, and it already has a contract
for $250MM! with a company called Extant. Extant is closely held and equity
owners include SFE and Peco Energy, so there are some pretty sophisticated and
deep pockets there. It is my belief that if Tellium were to go public today it
would be worth anywhere from $2.5Billion to $6Billion-my best guess being
$5Billion making ORTL's interest worth about $900MM. Ortel's market cap is
about $260MM. Even if I am off by a big margin here I think there is an awful
lot of "relative" value here and I added to my position today even at these
comparatively exalted levels. The catalyst here may be the upcoming IPO of
Sycamore which is a competitor. Depending on high how SYcamore goes it should
give Ortel a pretty strong kick. Of course I have been wrong before and may
well be again.

Hi Armin,

I agree; there are some non-value stocks that I like also but they need to be
discounted a bit more for my tastes.

In the meantime, I think BEBE was discussed here. This is probably more of a
young-growth story but it appears that the entire specialty retail sector is
out of favor. Everything is being brought lower today in sympathy with ANF
which was hobbled by some confusing analyst comments which may or may not have
been retracted. There are some issues regarding inventories (good fodder for
Paul's discussion of inventory yield) but the bull argument there is that they
are preparing for a robust back-to-school/holiday shopping season.

Still the sector merits investigation at these levels, IMHO.

Stern: re: CCN. Yes, I bought 10/07/97 based on Mike Burry's analysis.

Value investors often have to suffer. And this stock was one that tests a lot
of us. A mental fight within me certainly. Over Siegel, a great manager, and
Siegel in 1997,1998, 1999- a manager who looks like he got old and lost it.
Milking the co? Doing apparently nothing while his 5th (or is it 6th?) rated
network flounders. Yes the value is/was there. But having to fight against the
mental state of "dead money" , "dead money", "dead money". Even though I think
people who deride stocks by terming them "dead money" are newbies, I can get
impatient too. Especially if I had this stock in a concentrated portfolio. And
for this dull stock - even a person like me who wrongly tends to hold way too
long to too many losers-- I cannot count the number of times I thought of
selling my small position as "better" opportunities presented themselves.

Here's where I said to Wallace Rivers, 6/19/98, that I didn't think I could

&#209;,

I've read your much earlier post on the value of the home building industry.
You analysis seems good to me. FWIW, Mr. Pink also likes LEN as a value play,
and at significantly higher prices. The industry seems to be unloved because of
the current and anticipated future FED rate hikes. New home stats also dropped
a bit, which I guess supports the fears of the investors. All that said, I see
that several of the companies have dropped pasted their 52 week lows. Unless
inflation goes ballistic and the Feds push the rates way up, these stock will
find a bottom and turn. As cyclicals, they will be darlings again, at some
point. I think one key indicator are the unemployment #'s. As long as people
are gainfully employed, and the job market is tight, salaries will raise and
people will buy houses. A lot of the new houses in California are not for the
first time buyers. Builders are targeting the trade up market. My wife's
coworker invited us to a housewarming get together last week, to show off her
$650,000 new home. It was elegant w/ modern architecture, reasonably spacious,
and one of 20 or so in a new tract of land. Each house is unique in
architecture. These are not the typical row houses, where every house on the
block looks identical. There will probably be another 50 or so built in the
near future. There is a golf course (being built), a club house and a pool, all
within 5 mins walk. The husband is a manager of something at IBM, and she is a
computer programmer at where my wife works. She recently quit her job to raise
their 2 infants. My point to all of this is that there are a lot of people with
decent jobs and salaries, and these folks will continue to be buyers of new
houses. The CA housing market is hot. I heard an estimate the other day
regarding the growth of 200,000 tech jobs in silicon valley in the next 10
years, and that there is only 100,000 projected new houses to be built in that
time frame. As to the markets in the other states, I can't say. I bought a
quite a few shares of LEN at 17-1/2. I like to add to the position, but not
until it bottoms. Any guesses? I remember ASYT from last year at about this
time. I missed the bottom by 9-10 points, and sold out 10+ points from the top.
I still made a few schekles, but better timing would definitely improve
results.

Chester, more on homebuilders:

from today's news release from DHI, which is trading nearly at its lowest level
in two years,

D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)
Thursday (October 14, 1999) announced that it expects to exceed First Call
consensus estimates for the fourth quarter ended September 30, 1999. .... a 10%
increase over the current First Call consensus estimate of
$0.69 per share. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999, D.R. Horton,
Inc. expects to report net income of at least $2.49 per share (diluted)

 my note -- this works out to a p/e of 4.56 

Speaking to research analysts today, Richard Beckwitt, President, said,
"Fiscal 1999 will mark our 22nd consecutive year of record revenues and
profits. Net income rose in the fourth quarter, fueled by a 39% increase in
revenues from homes closed. Revenues from homes closed totaled $936 million
(5,424 homes) for the three months ended September 30, 1999, compared to
$673 million (4,232 homes) for the same period of 1998."
Donald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, "We enter fiscal 2000 with
the highest beginning backlog in the Company's history and continued sales
momentum. New sales orders for the three months ended September 30, 1999
increased 11% in units and 27% in dollars. More importantly, sales orders
accelerated in the month of September 1999, increasing 21% in units and 38% in
dollars. Given our record backlog of approximately $1.4 billion, we are
poised for another record year in fiscal 2000."

 my note: this means that the forward p/e is even less than the trailing p/e of
4.56

SSI - which I own
The preliminary proxy is available on Edgar, and I have read parts of it. If
all goes as planned, shareholders will receive the proxy shortly, and vote
whether they want to cash out at about 10.35-10.39/share (more likely the
higher number). The stock trades at about 8 13/16. The payout is expected to be
by year end (again, if the vote is +, and all else is in order).
The market IMHO is saying
1) the deal is not a slam dunk.
2) the market, in general, and for REITS in particular, has been very poor.
I think the deal will happen (if I didn't, I would have sold my shares). The

I started accumulating more CMH little by little at 10, adding to the original

steal for a while, I am now actually putting even more money where my mouth is.
This is becoming a big position for me, and is starting to become a significant
position for my firm's accounts. Their quarter showed how far and away this
company outclasses its industry. I firmly believe the stock is worth at least
$15 and have no problem with it going lower from here because I am willing to
buy even more. I doubt if you see instant gratification here, but if you want a
quick hit, try owning Clayton from December 15 to January 15. I think you make
at least 10% on this stock in 30 days. Its heavily retail owned and has shown a
big January effect in the past. Their conference call may be available publicly
- try c-call.com. Maybe its just available to those with a password. But its
worth a listen.

USEC - they have the cash to pay the dividend, and all signals I have gotten
are that the Board's first priority is to pay that dividend. I'm waiting to see
the quarter - I believe they will make the EPS number. What you want to see is
a positive resolution of the Russian deal by the end of the year. The company
generated $180 million of free cash flow after capital expenditures in the last
twelve months. And that was with $100 million of expenditures for AVLIS, which
has been cancelled - that expense will probably be more like $25 million this
year. And there is a lump of uranium on the balance sheet worth about $400
million that they have just started to liquidate. The market cap is $950
million - actually its less than that, because the company has bought back
probably 5% of the shares since the last 10-Q. You do the math.

Any thoughts on HealthSouth?

Paul, on SEMI: The 4 biggest problems for the stock from my point of view are a
totally discouraged shareholder base, a family mgmt that actually is OK but
does not spend time doing anything promoting the stock, the obvious high
debt/equity ratio, and lack of a big-6 acctg firm (and the possibility that I
have commented on that they may have a too generous variable compensation plan
that eats up too much of additional gross margin dollars from increased sales).

I think the total capitalization/sales, total capitalization/gross margin,
price/tangible book, price/net-net (about 75%) make up for this. You don't get
these things without blemishes. Also, as I have posted, I suspect some other,
larger distributor will get around to them before Wall Street does in this
consolidating industry, where SEMI is probably the largest independent
distributor of semiconductors, a much more fashionable category than a year
ago.
However, because of the negatives mentioned I don't think you have to be
aggressive on the stock.

To add some perspective, on a scale of 1-10, I would rate NH at 9, which we all

Alan, re: CCN. I say forget it. The Journal wrongly switched stocks, imo. It's
not CCN that's worth the $3.5B. It's the value of the TV stations, etc. and
they are in BHC. (note: About $3.5B is what I've also seen reported as an
analyst's estimate of BHC's worth.) CCN is primarily a holding company of BHC
stock. Each CCN sh. represents. .44 shares of BHC. So CCN, trading now around
66, is trading close to a likely buyout price imo, should there be one.

BHC@$152./sh x 22.2M sh. outstanding = $3.4B.

For each CCN share: 152. x .44 = $67.

If there's a strategic imperative by CBS, or somebody else, that they must buy
out CCN, then the price might not be $67/sh. BHC has already zoomed based on
the CBS/Viacom deal to $3.5B. There still might be more room in the share
price, but I doubt much more than a few dollars.

I could be wrong. Siegel might a super adamant holdout and CBS/Viacom might be
desperate. Given that, then I say a likely final price can't be figured in

Hi Paul,

Well, I can't exactly claim the returns I posted last week anymore. While most
of my value-ish stocks lost less (TGX actually gained quite a bit) I was
blind-sighted by one of my growth stocks, Tyco (TYC). I am sure that people
here have heard the story by now especially since it involves a guy named Tice
from the Prudent Bear Fund. I bring this up here because I feel that this is a
case of market over-reaction which presents an opportunity to buy a rapidly
growing company at a discounted price.

The story goes as follows. David Tice of the Prudent Bear Fund also publishes a
newsletter called "Behind the Numbers". In it he printed a report written by a
guy named Meyer(sp?) who made certain claims against Tyco's earnings
statements. I have not read the report since Tice charges $10K for annual
subscriptions but from what I have read in secondary sources they go like this:
Tyco makes acquisitions and in some cases uses the pooling accounting method.
By doing so Tyco has inflated earnings through the use of one-time charges
taken during the restructuring. He provided numbers to back up his argument but
that is basically all he said. He has since stated that he never accused them
of fraud or any other illegal activity. I suspect that some posters here may
have access to Behind the Numbers and, if so, I would greatly appreciate any
information that could be added. I should also note that similar comments about
this type of accounting was made here on this thread several years ago and has
been repeated as a concern for the history of this company. Why does it scare
people now?

Now back to the story. Once this report hit the street it was transformed into
reports of accounting irregularities and fraud with comparisons to SOC, Cendant
and the likes. To his credit, Tice has gone on record as saying that he never
made those comparisons but the story had taken on a life of its own. The
shareprice started a free fall at about 3pm Wednesday. Within 2.5 hours the
management arranged for a conference call with the CEO, the CFO and some guy
from investor relations for early the next morning. This call is available for
replay but in it they vigorously denied any irregularities, stated that they
would exceed analyst expectations and maintained that their 'organic' growth
was still 11-12%. He defined it as growth from businesses held for a year
(kinda like same-store-sales). The CEO said that their would be no
restatements, and that their were no investigations and that their are no
irregularities. Every firm covering the company listened to the call and
reaffirmed their buy or strong buy recommendation some advising their clients
to make aggresive use of this downturn to add to their positions.

The price finally firmed on Friday but if Mike Burry's observations of October
Mondays is repeated hen it will likely correct with everything else. As for me,
I realize the dangers in pooling accounting and have watched other companies
founder and fail because of it. I am not an accountant so I won't even try to
crunch numbers on this one. Tyco makes hundreds of acquisitions but the vast
majority use purchase accounting. Cash flow from existing businesses looks
strong. I am glad that there are guys like Tice out there but his record at
BEARX doesn't help his credibility. Tyco management on the other hand has shown
an uncanny knack for making and integrating acquisitions with great success.
Tyco releases earnings next week and has arranged for a meeting with investors,
CEO, CFO, and accountants to educate investors on how Tyco accounts for
acquisitions. They just don't seem to be trying to hide anything.

Who is right? I don't know. But management has responded swiftly and
appropriately IMHO. The loss of market cap may become a self-fulfilling
prophecy however since their stock has been deflated as a currency to make
acquisitions. For my part I have put in an order to increase my position should
it trend lower with the market.

I realize this is a bit off-topic since even at these levels Tyco still does
not qualify as a Graham-type value but if anybody is interested in a
well-managed growth stock selling at a reduced price then this may be a stock
to look into.

Comments welcome,
Terrapin

LKI This news: De Beers slashes diamond stocks to gain value

JOHANNESBURG, Oct 18 (Reuters) - South African diamond giant De Beers on Monday
said it would more than halve its multi-billion-dollar diamond stockpile in a
move to boost shareholder value and take advantage of a buoyant gem market.

De Beers, which controls around 70 percent of the world market in rough stones,
said it aimed to cut its working stockpile of diamonds held in London to
between $1.5-2.0 billion from $4.6 billion at the end of last year...

Looks a tad bearish for LKI. I'm not a holder, but have been watching it with

Sometimes I wonder why everyone is endeared to make a market direction
prognostication and claim "you heard it here first?" Not trying to flame Jim
but every thread I travel, there is someone who is calling the crash first.
Which, for all the more reason, leads me to believe that it just isn't
happening, yet. Too much bearish sentiment. (Although, I did reallocate my
portfolio to 75% cash / 25% equities last Thursday on a TA basis) I preferred
to err on the conservative side this year with it being October, negative TA,
outlandish valuations.

I must also ask what is defined as a "crash"? The DOW is already down 13% from
all time highs. Have we already had a "crash" and it has been gradual instead
of 13% in one day? Are many defining a "crash" as one HUGE down day as in 1987?
Are we now bottoming? (I think not)

Although I find it hard to be true, sometimes I wonder if value investors are
incorrect in the belief that we are not in a "New Era" of valuations? Are we? I
don't know. Wish I did.

Enough rambling. How about lets start a discussion of what stocks will become
undervalued if and when a "crash" occurs? I, myself, am interested in large
caps that might become attractive on a valuation basis. But, if others prefer
small caps I believe all comers will be welcomed.

If one finds my post offensive or completely out of touch please let me
apologize on the front. Just trying to discuss some of the current thoughts

XRX Suffering from 'distributed printing'...instead of information being

Financially, the debt looks a bit heavy though not in danger zone. Barron's

be a situation where the market has recognized that the game has really

TwoBear: This is hardly an original thought, but we're already experiencing a
bear market [though not a crash] in the great majority of stocks. Certainly in
nearly all the stocks that we look at seriously as value investors. Take out
the top 10 or 10% of names in any broad index and I think you'll find the rest
of the list meets most definitions of a bear market down 20+% from high's and
so forth.
The distinction between a crash and a bear is how compressed the decline
is...opinions differ, but a one day drop of 10+% in the S&P [1000 dow points
from here] would seem to fit.
I'm also surprised the market has come down as much as it has considering how
broadly 'expected' the October selloff has been. Rarely does the market live up
to expectations.
High cash is a good and prudent thing, IMO, given overall valuation, rising
rates, y2k impact, and tax loss selling. But there are some names that are
already serious bargains.

Peter, VUL is interesting, sort of like a sleepy closed end fund is
interesting. After reading the 10K, I concluded that this is really
less interesting than it seems.

The cost basis of its assets is negligible, so they might have to pay taxes
before you could get your hands on the money. Its operating businesses are
unattractive. There does not seem to be ANY strategy whatever to eliminate the
substantial discount to asset value short term.

That said, they are gradually reducing the stock outstanding with a buyback,
cutting the O/S every year. Mathematically, this plus being able to buy the
stock at such a discount means that this is probably quite an attractive
alternative to buying an index fund, if you are willing and plan to hold it for
many years -- especially since it has fallen quite a bit under the S&P
trendline, for no apparent reason:

I would be surprised if we had a crash. In 1987, interest rates were three
points higher than they are now. P/E ratios are similar, however, in 1999, they
are skewed by some outliers such as AOL,and CISCO. This year, unlike 1987, all
of the over valuation is concentrated in the frothy stuff: internet, ipo's,
selected technology stocks, and concept stocks.

There is a tremendous amount of value being created from the EVERYTHING ELSE
category, The "smart money" is feeling pain right now, just as they were in
1994 when the fed took the air out of the economy. That includes Southeastern
Asset Mgmt, Sequoia Fund, Clipper Fund, Oakmark, and Davis Advisors. Rather
than a crash, I think you start to see the "smart money" beginning to
outperform from here, (even if the direction is DOWN) as well as the gradual,
water torture style deterioation of the fluffy stuff.

I think the focus on "the market" is misplaced. Value investors, especially
those not restricted to larger ideas, can and should do well from here.

Yes, jeffrey, I noticed all that in the 10-K. Extremely low tax basis, although
reflected in the deferred taxes, resulting in a Price to Book Ratio of 50%. I
ignore any residual value of their industrial plant and business, as well,
dangerously, as the Superfund potential liability. (Although this sounds like
it won't exceed $5 million)

The catalyst, if any, may be the age of the major shareholder, now in his

Peter, on VUL, I agree on the (lack of) value of the businesses but did not
ignore the $5M superfund risk. I seem to recall that the reference to "joint
and several" means the guy with the money pays? But even with that and taking
out taxes on gains, the valuation plus buybacks make it a good deal versus an
index fund.

My issue is more whether that is a stock we should be looking at in a weak
market, as others may get relatively much more inefficiently priced.

Jim, on Dana (DCN). Well, I don't like it. However, it's not a matter of what I
like and don't like. Or so I keep telling myself. It's about what works and
what doesn't.

Dana is way too diverse and too industrial for me to evaluate its specific
businesses. It sells "stuff" that goes inside of car/truck engines, and "stuff"
that goes under cars and trucks. A business that just doesn't seem to appeal in
1999. DCN seems more like a '60's stock - if it ever was even then. A company
with many competitors and perhaps just a few big customers. And a cyclical
business too. Maybe now we're close to the top of the auto. or economic cycle.
DCN earnings will be down next year, and the stock has been hit today by a
number of analyst downgrades. Two strategic goals of the company are to
diversify sales more internationally vs. their domestic exposure, and diversify
their customer base (replacement market vs. new). Plus develop more "other"
businesses vs. auto/truck. How successful they may be is difficult for an
outsider to speculate. I see no "catalyst" for this company.

Nevertheless, I've started a very small position in DCN today at under $28.
Company's past financials and performance show some very good numbers, imo:
There's high ROE (4 of past 7 years above 21%); increasing book value; and
relatively low price to sales compared to previous years. I see 6 years of
increasing dividends; a large cap company with a relatively high dividend (over
4%); increasing long term debt but debt/equity is generally decreasing; and low
relative pe compared to past years.

This company seems like it would hold very little interest for investors- value
or not. But for me, within a diversified portfolio, one focused on growth and
income, the stock could work out okay over a couple of years.

(Aside: purchased DCN with some funds generated today from selling last year's
purchase of the maintenance supplier/distributor Grainger (GWW), which no
longer qualifies as a value stock, imo)

Good info on VUL, Cary. Considering the age and likely (very low) cost basis of
the owner, and my view that the stock is a superior proxy for the S&P over the
longer term, I see no reason whatever for Gettler to do anything but maintain
the status quo and let his heirs benefit from a stepped up cost basis when he
dies.

If I am right, then a buyer should be happy with that outlook before he steps
up to the plate (using baseball lingo after watching 2 super
exciting Mets-Braves ball games - one a pitcher's game and one a hitter's

Paul - good analysis of Dana, both the risk (cyclicality, auto and truck parts
industry) and the bull case (valuation). What I think you might have missed is
the quality of the company. I do not like auto parts companies at all. As you
point out, I think it is a low return business mainly because the customers
have so much power over their suppliers. But Dana has always been the best in
the sector. The best managed, the most profitable. I think the only way an
investment in Dana turns out badly a year from now is if the U.S. goes into
recession, then we probably go to book value. I'm not sure if I'd buy it myself
- I'm just throwing it out there as a high quality large cap company trading at
the lowest p/e multiple it has traded at in the last ten years, with a 4%
dividend yield.

Eaton is another story entirely. Extremely well managed and highly profitable
company. This company is on the same level as an Allied Signal. Investors put
it in the truck sector, which is their largest business by by no means the
dominant business of the company. And what is their truck business? They have
something like 85% market share in truck transmissions - a nice business,
though cyclical. Most intriguing was the reason for the selloff today. They
missed estimates by 10 cents. This is a company that does not manage for Wall
Street. They don't do conference calls. Today management arranged a conference
call late in the afternoon because they were absolutely incredulous at the
reaction to the earnings report - the stock sold off 15 points! They made every
operating number - they considered it a good quarter. The "miss" came from a
throwaway line item called "other income/expense" that kind of moves randomly.
Management was ridiculing the sellside analysts on the call for punishing a
company earning over $6 a year for a 10 cent miss of a number that simply
doesn't behave on a predictable quarterly basis. I have to agree with them.
This game of analyst estimates was exposed at its most ridiculous in this case.
(Dana was also interesting in that they didn't miss their number - on their
conference call management simply would not state that they are "certain" of
the fourth quarter or 2000 numbers. Maybe that's a signal, but I might be more
worried about a management in a cyclical business that DID say they are certain
about what they will earn a year from now! A high quality stock falls 20% and
goes to 7 times earnings because management provides inadequate "guidance" to
those who call themselves "analysts". Incredible.)

Art Leavitt, head of the SEC, gave a wonderful speech a couple days ago about
the games being played by sell side analysts, companies and institutional
investors today. See if you can find it on the SEC site - it describes what I
see every day perfectly. It is an absolutely ridiculous way to invest, and
should provide many opportunties for value investors who ignore the game and
focus on fundamentals.
