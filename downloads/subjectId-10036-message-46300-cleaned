HOW TO PLAY IT: Natural gas falls near 10-year low
http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/20/us-howtoplay-naturalgas-idUSTRE80J207
0120120
"...How to play the natural gas industry's unexpected woes...."

Many of the companies mentioned in the article have been discussed on the
thread and are ones I own. Maybe it's time to peel off some of the profits
since many of these companies are at or near their 52wk highs.

-------------------------------------------------

E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Com (DD) -NYSE - peeled off 30% of my shares
originally purchased 11/19/2008 for $24.99/share. Company has a GN of $31.83.
Based on the current market price of $49.41, DD is 30% overvalued according to
Graham. Although analysts have 2012 earnings estimate much higher such that the
forward PE is 11.58, I am booking a few of my profits now so I can buy other
value stocks at a better bargain. (ie lower GN).

FWIW many of my other large gainers in the portfolio bought in the 2009 period
(lots of them are doubles or more) have very high Graham No.s based on today's
GN calculation and the current market price. All of those stocks at the time
originally purchased had Graham No.'s equal to or less than my original
purchase price. Therefore, I can only conclude that according to Graham, my
portfolio is overvalued so I continue to sell into the rallies.

Off set some of these gains by selling some of my losers (GMXR) and moved the
balance of the proceeds into the Vanguard GNMA Fund (VFIIX).

I checked today and it is 3%. Just over 3x what my Credit Union pays. It is not
w/o interest rate risk because when interest rate rise, the price of the fund
falls. Over the last 7 years the trading range has been between $9.50/share and
$11.20/share, so it is selling currently at the higher end on their price
range. For me, as long as the Fed is in their "ease" mode (ie holding the Fed
Fund rate at current levels w/ quarterly updates to the public), I am willing
to park liquid funds there until the policy changes.

We are in historical times for the current interest rate cycle so it is not the
time to become complacent about the world's economies. Otherwise, why would
interest rates still be so very low?

i EKS,

Thank you for the feedback.

I have always concentrated my investments in equities and dividends.

As a dealer excess cash can be used to offset our floor plan bill which gives
daily liquidity and just over 2.0 per cent low but good relatively.

If not for that I'd be looking in those types of accounts.

Thank you for the explanation - looks like a high yield place to park money in
a relative way.

>>Stocks Are Cheaper Than They've Been in Two Decades
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-cheaper-theyve-two-decades-195422624.html

From the article:"..."The S&P 500 is currently trading below its historical
average P/E and P/B ratios, and these ratios are also at their lowest levels in
the careers of a large percentage of money managers," wrote strategists Paul
Hickey and Justin Walters....".<<

The market PE and in particular the p/b ratio is very much skewed by cheap
financials where both earnings and book markets are questionable. Other
industry groups like Utilities, consumer goods and industrials don't look
particulary cheap to me (neither are they expensive IMO). Just looking at
averages is insufficient to characterize the market, it would be fairer if the

then the reader probably would have dismissed this as nonsense (or maybe not).

I can tell you, that with respect to small cap stocks there have been several

Maybe it is because I am lazier stock screens nowadays, but there were a couple

Hi TheBigLong -

Welcome to the Value Investing SI thread and hope to see more of your posts. As
your fist post, you raise a good value opportunity and for me RIO is one I have
put back on my radar screen.

You will find that most (if not all) of these mining/resource companies sell
well below their Graham No. That is why I think they hold a lot of value. I
used to own RIO and probably need to evaluate this one along with the other
natural resource companies I own and compare them to their current GN No.

Rio Tinto Plc Common Stock (NYSE: RIO) -
GN: $77.39 (Discount to GN 34%) Dividend= 1.9%
BHP Billiton Limited Common Sto (NYSE: BHP)
GN: $64.02 (No Discount Over Valued by 20%) Dividend= 2.8%
VALE S.A. American Depositary (NYSE: VALE)
GN: $38.55 (Discount to GN 57%) Dividend = 0.20%
ANGLO AM PLC ADR (Other OTC: AAUKY.PK)
GN: $34.22 (Discount to GN 65%) Dividend = 1.7%

--------------------------------------------------------------------

RIO is one I should look at as it is selling at a 34% discount to it's GN. I
recently added to my VALE shares and I probably should add to my AAUKY.pk
shares since it shows the biggest discount to it's GN at 65%.

For perspective, I loaded up on AAUKY shares during the 2009 crash on 1/13/2009
w/ shares purchased at $10.47/share. The stock hit a recovery high of
$25.00/share where I peeled off a few shares. I knew they were on sale but w/o
the reference GN number to look at, I missed a true bargain. I was planning on
selling a few more shares around $24.00/share but may hold off knowing that the
calculated GN value is $34.22/share.

I have found that these resource companies never really exceed their GN value
by much when compared to other non-resource companies. I probably should think
of peeling off shares of my BHP and buying some RIO, VALE and AAUKY.

I added RIO to my GN watch list along with VALE and AAUKY. If you notice any
other of these resource companies selling at a discount to their GN, please
post.

I think a lot of people share your views. And why mutual funds manager have
been pulling billions of dollars out of the market from 2009 through the middle
of 2011. But as profits at firms have soared the stock market has not followed
because of fear. Fear of another debt crisis, fear of Europe(greek, italy,
france, etc). IMO, the stock market is trading on news not fundamentals. I
agree it's hard to find a margin of safety that existed a few months ago in

Hi Segio -

For others who just want to review that list of stocks, here is a Yahoo link
that provides the detailed view for each of the candidate stocks in the
article.

http://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/AEP,DTE,EIX,FIBK,IDA,MAIN,NLY,PFS,POR,PRA,PRI,S

The one other very important screen that I use is my modified Buffet rule: That
is that the annual net income should be 4x or less than the company's total LT
debt. I will let 5X go through but in these times, companies with a lot of LT
debt is something I would rather not own. In fact, with such low interest rates
(ie low cost of capital), many companies have been able to pay down their LT
debt to more manageable levels.

Therefore, I want to invest in those companies where the stock is selling at a
discount to the calculated Graham No. AND at least 4x their net annual income
is greater than or equal to the company's LT debt.

From the list 5 companies meet this LT debt test: PRA, PRI, SYX, WRB & SRCE

You also want to be sure BV is tangible BV and does not include any significant
Goodwill, so adjust for that. I do notice that a few insurance companies make
the list so I am not sure if these types of companies need any other special
adjustments especially because of the potential liability in the policies they
write (perhaps those are re-insured).

Finally, I want companies that are selling near their lows rather than their
highs.

I still need to work through their list and then add those that look
interesting to my GN watch list. My long term strategy is on any significant
market correction, my filtered GN watch list will become my "Buy" list. In a
fast market you will not have time to do your due diligence but will be pulling
the trigger like a six shooter.

SRE will be one of the first 4 natural gas exporters via their Baja terminal

to be a good, well run company liked by value line. Don't own it though, lol.
Bought AVA this AM, but SRE
is on my list on any further sell off, likely not tomorrow after the APPLE

This AM the U.S. DOE authorized Cameron LNG, a subsidiary of SRE, to export
LNG, encouraging U.S. natural gas companies to send their resources overseas.
<u>The export permit is only the third awarded in the</u> <u>U.S</u>., and will
allow the natural gas distributor to ship up to 1.7 bcf per day of LNG to
countries possessing free-trade agreements with the U.S.

Sempra
has a large commitment to green energy that will hopefully
ensure dividends into the future. Despite being at it's high, Sempra
offers cheap price-to-earnings and price/earnings-to-growth ratios. Gross
margin of 31.39% and operating margin of 17.26% are both better than its peers
as well. With $802 million flowing into Sempra
during 2010, this company has plenty of cash to pay out future dividends, and
has a low payout ratio.

I DO own MAIN, and so far have no complaints.

Moj,

RIMM: Thank you for the response (also Clownbuck, and Jurgis)

I think clownbuck and Jurgis hit on the issues they are having technically.

And your points are also good ones. I think there is some flaws in your
rationale about it being 1/7th of its peak valuation - for me that seems to
have always got people in trouble especially tech plays.

Also, For me trying to cut through the clutter, RIMM best case scenario FOR ME
through my quick take on the valuation you are looking at it being taken out at
current price or slightly lower - maybe $5 billion market cap. For this to
happen you would need to the price to fall AT LEAST another 20-30% so they
could then be taken over by a decent respectable premium.

Maybe it would make sense to take a look at it then considering a company could
take it over and cut the crud - then it becomes a straight up private cash
flow/valuation project for someone with a patent kicker. There is value here
Moj, at some level but i would still think cash would be a better option at
this time.

I enjoy your posts and appreciate your opinion. I thought it was interesting to
note that the list was made up of stocks hitting or near new highs but
undervalued relative to their GN.

I really like your strategy of having stocks ready for when you want to reload
or rebalance your portfolio. Capturing undervalued GN and reviewing for
tangible book value are a good start as is setting a max for acceptable debt to
earnings ratio. I don't agree with eliminating stocks that are at or near highs
since this does not imply that the value is shrinking.

Stocks could be hitting new highs along with improving metrics similarly to
stocks hitting new lows could be experiencing a decline in value metrics. New
highs do not prevent higher highs and new lows do not indicate a bottom.

Hi Paul -

Where do you find the time series for companies with "Growing BV"? I can easily
find stated BV for companies but it is hard for me to see if BV is growing over
time w/o going through several of the old annual company reports. Do you know
of a site that shows several years of financials that also includes BV over
time?

My premise is to find those companies that have grown their BV over the last
five year. These companies should do even better in a low interest rate
environment (ie low cost of capital). Of course, I want companies that are
profitable and have been able to grow revenues, maintain and/or increase
margins but also have grown their stated BV.

I thought that starting a screen w/ companies that have grown their BV over the
last five years, I could then thin down the list w/ this other criteria to find
some good value "Buy" candidates.

Im known to luuuv a good short discussion. I think i actually had a write up
for you on why i disagreed with your COH short but agreed with some of your
ideas, but i think a cocktail or three got the best of me on posting go
figure...

Long story short i think its difficult to short on valuation alone, you need to
have a reasonable assurance there is a major flaw either within the company
(fraud) or the industry it operates in being that the relationship the industry
is operating under will not sustain itself.

You mentioned you liked it as a hedge... but if you were looking to hedge not
sure why you would use an individual stock to hedge your portfolio exposure
unless you had a decent amount of retail exposure.....? Volatility around 18
and realized volatility around 9 would make more sense IMO either with using
the VIX, or some of the etf options that is if you wanted to hedge.

re ABH - I have owned and sold this for a loss a while ago. I bought this based
on the assumption that the economy would recover nicely and asian lumber
exports would provide some gravy. I am not sure that either one is happening.

Facts as I see them:
1) ABH is a crummy business (newsprint, pulp) and has sold of the most valuable
assets during the bankruptcy (timber, hydro power assets)
2) They dramatically reduced debt through the bankruptcy process but they still
have 1.2B$ in net pension liability as of 12/30/11 (see excerpt)
3) Almost half of their "Tangible book value" is actually a deferred tax asset.
They need an enormous deal of earnings to make this deferred tax asset "real".
4) No dividends unless the pensions are at least 80% funded

Excerpt from Y2010 10K:

We record assets and liabilities associated with our pension and OPEB projected
benefit obligations that may be considered material to our financial position.
We also record net periodic benefit costs associated with these obligations as
our employees render service. As of December 31, 2010, we have pension and OPEB

Today: "Hess downgraded at Deutsche from Buy to Hold, Deutsche Bank said. $62

now at $55.73 - $1.58)

The stock has a puny $.10 quarterly dividend that it's kept for more than a
decade. Perhaps Mr. Hess, the apparent controlling shareholder, doesn't want
more. In this time of low interest, if this big company isn't going to pay a
decent dividend, then for me, I welcome welcome an "aggressive spending

Since I am now focused on calculating Graham Numbers, the 5yr BV and 5yr

"one-time" anomalies in candidate company numbers.

When I see 5 yr BV growing (as well as growing capital investments) and 5 yr
earnings growing, its another plus for me buying the stock. This is even more
important now when measured from the 2009 "crash". Companies that have been

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-23/abtech-s-rink-discusses-investment-in-

Of course it got overbought subsequent to the interview, but I'll keep it on
the radar for the next year or two. If you listen to the podcast, I believe
you'll hear value beyond what's presented in the financials. I tend to like an
interesting story told by intelligent people, which often fogs my investing

its stake to 51 percent this week.

Ivanhoe owns 66 percent of Oyu Tolgoi, which is located 80 kilometers (50
miles) north of Mongolia’s border with China. <u>The project will be one of the
world’s five biggest copper mines</u>, according to Rio, (RIO) which is

Difco. I closed Nalco last year after it got a buyout offer from Ecolab.
ABHT: The ceo sounds like a great salesman. Company might do very well. Not
anywhere near a value stock, but may be a good spec play. I agree, overbought
now, would watch for a lower entry point if I were interested. The stock isn't
for me though at this time. (Would like to see more quarterly results, lower
p/sales, etc.)

"I tend to like an interesting story told by intelligent people, which often
fogs my investing vision." I agree. And in my case, I have found "investing" in
story stocks to not be so profitable for me. I fall for the written stuff --
analyst reports, management reports -- I'm usually not persuaded as much by
articulate verbal encomiums. (Sometimes ceo's appear to me to be very slick
salesmen.) Doesn't mean I don't or won't succumb though and buy in for a few
shares sometimes. Mostly though I like to stick to basic metric numbers.

re RFE.AX - as a general rule, I avoid investing in upstart/small companies
that don't list in their home markets. I don't think it makes too much sense to
list in Australia and raise money there, while operating a upstart E&P in the
US. What's the reason - collecting frequent flyer miles, evade taxes, avoid the
SEC scrutiny or just screw unsuspecting investors far away from home, so you
don't crap you nest if things go wrong? Neither explanation appeals to me but
some are definitely worse than others.

I have money in several stocks of small companies that list in home market &
raise money in home market, but have operations elsewhere. That would be some
Canadian with their business interests elsewhere, Australian with their
business elsewhere, and English also. Doesn't seem to be an issue for me except
when some Aussie companies have issued new stock at below market price, and
they've made that offer only available to Australian citizens (Australian
stockholders).

Although your point is to "upstart/small companies", the US does have history
with these type of investments with larger companies. Dutch East India company
for example. And start-ups: 19th century USA eastern interests ("robber
barons") issuing stock to finance operations in USA western territories to open
mines, build railroads.

Well, I think in some cases there are legit reasons to raise money in one
market/country A, and start operations in market/country B. One example would
be when country B does not have well established capital & stock markets. That
is a reason why a company that start up ops in let's say Bolivia are listed in
the USA or Canada.
That may be understandable. But why would a company list in Australia, and
operate an upstart E&P in the US? The US has well established capital market,
and deep pool of investors that may invest in E&P ,so I cannot think of a
reason to do it that way that is positive for the respective investors.

New York Community Bancorp, Inc (NYSE: NYB) - started small position
Honeywell International Inc. Co (NYSE: HON) - closed out position
Corning Incorporated Common Sto (NYSE: GLW) - added more shares based on the
discount to their calculated GN.

Started a small position in NYB. Stock goes ex-dividend 2/3/2012 which yields
8%. Looking to use this stock to park some funds, collect the dividend and
maybe will see a small capital gain over the next 6-8 months.

Closed out my HON shares originally purchased 10/8/2008 around $35.00/share.
Based on today's price, the stock is selling 57% above it's Graham No value of
$37.06. When I originally purchased the stock it was selling at a discount to
it's GN. The dividend yield was dropping too, now only yielding 2.5%.

I am putting 50% of the proceeds from my HON sale into GLW, a position I
continue to add to at these levels. GLW has a Graham No. value of $22.93. At
the current price, GLW is selling at an 83% discount to this value at
$12.55/share. Stock also pays a 2.4% dividend.

GLW's BV has increased each year over the last 5 years.

One must be careful with the reported BV numbers on the Yahoo Finance site. I
have noted several instances where the number was overstated. On the ADVFN site
they also state the tangible BV which is the better number to use when
calculating the GN. (NOTE: HON has a -$3.01/share tangible BV probably as a
result of their recent acquisition(s) and the goodwill they paid in their

I feel most of us on this board like Volkswagen (FRA:VOW). A lot of you know
much more than I do about it and I just wanted to mention a couple of things
that interested me. Since 2008 I’ve been following events surrounding the
company and created a folder with paper clippings to keep track.

First, the beginning… Ferdinand Porsche found the Porsche design bureau in 1931
and was the original designer of the VW Beetle. He had two children, Ferdinand
Anton Ernst 'Ferry' Porsche, who held the helm of the new VW Company and his
daughter Louise Hedwig Anna Wilhelmine Maria Piech focused on the Porsche
Holding group. They each had 4 children, but only two of them continued the
family business: Wolfgang Heinz Porsche became the Chairman of Porsche (he's
the son of Ferdinand) and Ferdinand Piech became the Chairman of VW (he's the
son of Louise). Well, I guess the cousins didn't like each other too much, but
they sure liked each other's "das auto". So a few years back the far smaller
Porsche decided to use cash settled options (the banks effectively owned the
shares) to build a majority stake in VW. All of a sudden, in October of 2008,
Porsche disclosed that it holds enough options to purchase 70% of VW. (FT May
26, 2009 – Article called “Collision course) This resulted in a short-squeeze
of the short sellers of VW shares, who scrambled to cover their short positions
(one of them was actually short-champion and a personal hero, Greenlight
Capital). As a result of all this the VLKAY ADR price hit an all time high of
$122 (the ordinary VOW shares on the Frankfurt stock exchange actually traded
for a brief moment for 1,005 euros a share). Everything was well thought out
except for the fact that to purchase the shares, Porsche needed cash that banks
were not lending at that point in time due to the financial crisis. Soon the
options started to expire and Porsche was booking losses on these options.
Ironically, the only way to save Porsche was to have VW buy it, which it
partially did in the fall of 2009 and with the clear goal to become the number
one auto manufacturer in the world. So, VW bought 49.9% share in Porsche’s auto
business for 3.9 billion euros and received a call option for the remaining
50.1% (on the other hand Porsche received a put option for that same amount). A
caveat is that the options can’t be exercised until Nov. 15, 2012 or VW would
be on the hook for approx. 1.3 billion euros. But on the other hand, if the
carmaker waits until the second half of 2014, taxes on exercising the options
would shrink to zero.
(http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-22/volkswagen-says-process-still-ongoing
with-porsche-integration-decision.html). Finally, all the original short
sellers of Volkswagen are suing Porsche for about $1 billion for market
manipulation.

Usually short sellers don’t have faces, but in this story there is one – Adolf
Merckle. Merckle was a German billionaire, who was born in Eastern Germany, but
subsequently moved to the West and built an empire, which spanned from
pharmaceuticals to construction. At one point Merckle had an estimated worth of
over $9 billion. When everything is going your way for such a long time, you
sometimes get a crazy idea to push your luck – in this case Merckle decided to
make a big short bet on Volkwagen. This story has a tragic end, Merckle was
financially ruined and in January of 2009 committed a suicide. His body was
found on the train tracks near his house.
(http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/business/worldbusiness/07merckle.html).

I feel this story reads like a Shakespearean play – family splits, envy between
family members, sabotage, revenge and death. Whenever Volkswagen reaches
selling point, it will be hard to part with it.

ABB Nears Deal for Thomas & Betts for About $4B
By Zachary R. Mider - Jan 29, 2012 5:41 PM PT
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-29/abb-said-to-be-near-4-billion-purchase
of-component-maker-thomas-betts.html
"...Thomas & Betts, based in Memphis, Tennessee, would be the second large
acquisition for ABB under Chief Executive Officer Joe Hogan, who joined in 2008
from General Electric Co. (GE) He bolstered ABB in the U.S. with the January
2011 purchase of Baldor Electric Co. for $3.1 billion. That deal added
industrial motors and drives and gave ABB heft in automation, where it competes
with Siemens AG. (SIE)..."

----------------------------------------------------------
Definitely not in GN Buy territory (somewhere around $14.00/share). I did
notice that BV=$6.91/share but their Tangible Book Value is only $2.77/share.
This is most likely due to Goodwill as a result of their other recent
acquisitions (specifically $3.1B buy of Baldor Electric).

The positive thing is ABB has $5.6B in cash so if their proposed offer goes
through, it won't bankrupt the company. Also, they generate a lot of cash
($1.79/share cash flow) from their operations. On balance, it is probably a
good acquisitions as it provides a global footprint for the company in the
electric switch & connector sector which complements its other service
businesses.

I'm never quite comfortable with metrics that use FCF. And here's an example of
it. You have a positive "13% - 14% FCF yield", and positive "FCF margins"
whereas the sites I am using show a negative FCF number (which I assume would
make yield and margins negative). I don't know whether it's definitional
differences (Yahoo says "levered" free cash flow is negative) or what, but the
dichotomy -- an apparent plus FCF metric vs. a negative FCF number that I see
-- confuses me. No matter though. It's only important that you know how your
calculations stand in context as to what a value bogey is for you. . If you say
it's a value or value possibility or takeover possibility, it very well could
be. I don't see PMC as a value for me at current price, so I'll pass.

Re: Merck & Company, Inc. Common St (MRK) -NYSE
 Pfizer, Inc. Common Stock (PFE) -NYSE

You discussed your views 12/6/2010 on Health Care stocks (
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27007980&srchtxt=mrk ) and
were avoiding new buys on the major drug companies. Your focus was on specialty
drug companies (
http://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/COV,ABT,GILD,BDX,DGX,SIAL/view/dv;_ylt=ApQmhWMb
jZz.VNmha8rPyoLv7gF;_ylu=X3oDMTExYzFvNTI2BHBvcwM0BHNlYwN5ZmlUYWJsaXN0BHNsawNkZX
haWxlZA-- ), all have done well during the past year.

This was a pretty good observation since the Big Pharma stocks sold off in
August 2011, specifically MRK below $30.00/share and PFE below $17.50/share.
Both hit my Buy points but I never added to my core positions (deer in the head
lights syndrome). My avg cost on MRK is $28.55/share (mainly accumulated in
2008/2009) and PFE is $16.62/share (buys in 2009/2010). The dividend for both
companies has been steady yielding around 4%.

From your earlier observation in December 2010, several of these large Pharma
Companies have patent expiration issues that would impact their FCF and future
earnings. Two years down the road, some of these companies seem to have
maintained (or grow) their revenues in spite of these events.

MRK is now selling at it's GN value of $39.00/share. This is a moving target w/
analysts earnings at $3.76/share but BV at $18.07/ vs tangible BV at
$2.32/share. Using BV the GN is $39.00 but using tangible BV you get a GN of
$14.00/share.

MRK has continued their capital expenditures over the last 5 years and BV has
increased every year too (except 2011).

To me, it might be selling at the high end of their valuation especially if you
look at some of their patents as intangible assets w/ they expire. Drugs they
might (or have bought) also includes Goodwill that looses value over time.

Pfizer, Inc. Common Stock (PFE) -NYSE has a similar profile as MRK but their
tangible BV is actually negative (-$1.43) according to ADFV. The GN is $24.50
but much lower if you use tangible BV. Earnings were hit in 2010 due to patent
expiration(s). Even BV and capital spending has been erratic over the last five
years, only showing some increase from their low in 2008.

lue+PS&b_title=Cap+Invested+PS&cache_name=financialsusPFEI5'>

I have similar gains in PFE & MRK , both pay a 4% dividend or higher, both are
trading near their three year highs and their GN says they are both close to
selling at their fair value(s).

Didn't know if you had an opinion on the industry in general since on your last
post you had positions in JnJ and BMY (I own BMY but sold my JnJ in 2010 at
around the current price).

My thought was to look at a strategy of writing some "in the money" covered
calls on my two largest core positions PFE & MRK (the two make up 4%of the
portfolio) and on any market correction sell some naked Puts on MRK (below
$30.00/share) and PFE (below $17.5/share). If we get the market correction I
expect, both MRK & PFE will test their three year trading lows and would become
excellent buys.

It is typical of these large Pharma companies to have a large amount of
intangible assets (due to acquisitions, expiring patents etc), that it might be
better to view the GN values using their BV. If that is the case, then both of
these companies are probably selling at their fair value and I should not
expect too much more capital appreciation.

RSH. I am buying a few shares. If I look at the company from a business model
perspective and from what the media are saying, then this company may not have
a viable (growing) business. Maybe the company was hiding as a cigar butt
before, but it sure seems confirmed as one now. Margins are shrinking and media
mavens today say there may be no end in sight.

Just looking at the company's history, and its balance sheet, there are
positives, as benbuffett has mentioned. I'll view the company now as a cigar
butt with a still-okay balance sheet (cash= debt) and company is still
profitable. And so on that basis, I'll take a few more shares at $7.28. I
expect I may never see the stock hit my original cost basis (about $14-$15/sh);
maybe though I might see $10, if the company can maintain its profitability,
and doesn't just fade away like its old Heathkits (-g),

The pride/shame ratio feels very skewed toward shame today for anyone admitting

he was super long! We all know what happened then!

Anyways - the business model is cost intensive and it depends on how much they

Re: Kraton Performance Polymers, In (KRA) -NYSE

Added this to my watch list. Company selling 25% below it's GN (when using
tangible BV of $15.72/share and $3.50/share 12/2011 earnings; GN= $35.18). The
company could benefit from low NG prices too.

Rising BV and declining debt. Annual Net income is < 4x LT debt (3,22x).

Will start a small tracking position on any significant sell off. Company is in
a very cyclical business but seems to be undervalued at current levels.

Big pharma: Thanks for the update. I'm suspicious of the effect of upcoming
patent expirations on these stocks. I've not followed MRK or PFE closely ---
sorry I missed the lows at last year's sell-off. I have NVS on my watch list,
and have waffled on whether I want to buy or not. It's selling nearer 12-mo
lows than highs. Unlike PFE&MRK. The forward p/e is 9+, so I assume analysts
have baked expirations into that number. PFE forward p/e is 9+ also, and that
company is to have a very big expiration this year I believe, so I wonder about
relying on forward p/e estimates here. Maybe SNY, also forward p/e 9, a Buffett
pick, might be considered.

Meanwhile in pharma, I hold shares of these:
http://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/NVO,AMLN,AMGN,GILD

Only stock I like here currently is NVO, which imo is not a value stock. I'm
betting on the growth in obesity, the associated increase in diabetes, and
NVO's ability to treat that disease. If I didn't already own shares, I'd
consider it for as a buy for a growth-stock pick.

CB...

What are your thoughts on OVTI...?
(Current roadkill because they used to supply the sensor in the iPhone.. and
were was supplanted by Sony for the iPhone 4s..)

Trading near their 52 week low.
Net cash is about half of their market cap.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=OVTI+Key+Statistics

Still profitable (albeit less so..) supplying sensor's for Apple's older phones
and other makers. Potential for more customers in the Andorid market.

I picked up a few shares today for $13.31

Hi NikhilJog -

Everything I look at now (both past buys and sells) I am looking through the
Graham Number screen. It's not the only thing I look at but seems like a good
first view since it's easy and simple to calculate (use the ADFN Website for
tangible BV statistics Paul Senior posted up thread).

Do a Google Search on "Graham Number" and look at Wikidpedia for how to
calculate and the reasons for using it as a value metric. Some value investors
do not like to use it as it has its limitations when looking at certain types
of industries and/or sectors.

Since you are a knowledgeable MBA graduate go review the valuation formula and
report back to the thread your opinion on it's usefulness.

I am finding that for my longer term holds 18-36 months, If I can buy a stock
at a discount to it's GN, I will eventually get a chance to sell it as some
premium to that value. Check out HES. This is one Paul Senior posted recently.

This stock is selling between 35%-45% below it's GN (depending on the BV you
calculate- tangible and the earnings number you use current or analysts's
estimates).

I am very conservative in all of my new buys right now as this market is in a
tenuous position w/ the European/Greek default pending (1st default date
2/14/2012), historically low Fed Funds rate (to stay at this rate for at least
24 months) and still in a little to no growth (one can argue deflationary)
environment. Not really the best time to be buying stocks IMO unless you can
get them at a significant bargain.

re BTU @ 34.05$- decided to step up and buy a first lot of BTU at 34.05$.
Pros: Decent management and operational track record. Good position in
Australian coal resources. low cost operator.
Cons: Increased leverage (MacArthur acquisition), tiny dividend, headwinds in
product prices.

This is also a name I want to own and i am willing to average in.

KRA. I want to point out again where I believe use of the Graham number
overlooks a criterion:

Intelligent Investor ('73 edit.) , p. 182: "Price no more than 15 times
<u>average earnings of the past three years</u>"

KRA's been a volatile performer in terms of earnings. The past three years were
$3.50, 3.07, -.01

Plugging that average number into the equation results in a fair value number
close to current price.

If the argument is that earnings have improved and will continue to improve
given management's recent actions, that's well and good. That though for the
investor would be anticipating future good results on some basis different from
what I believe was Dr. Graham's intent with his number -- to use only
historical data to discern a value opportunity.

Fyi, Kraton's been a pick by richardred who follows several chemical companies

FCF: Yeah I vaguely remember those terms from fcf articles in the Financial
Analyst Journal back in the '70's.

Anybody can use any metric they want if it helps them pin down what they
believe will be a value number and a buy point. For "standard" fcf, a 15%
"yield" --- I get that that would be good or very good. For a fch margin of 3%
-- I've no idea what that is or its relevance. If it's important to the o.p
(original poster) though, then that's all that counts.

I assume we have at least a few people here who like and maybe use fcf in their
analyses and in making their stock buy/sell decisions. For me, I rarely make
such calculation, and find fcf as reported by Yahoo or other sites to be only
occasionally important for me in making a buying decision. I find not much
difference in results in basing decisions on the standard metrics (p/bk, p/e,
roe, etc) vs. on fcf.

There's really not much interest on SI in discussing fcf methods and
significance. I keep the fcf board on my subject list, and there's not been a
post there in .... eleven years (lol).

Sounds like the typical hedge fund approach. I am not saying it's bad but i
think it's hard to stand up with such an investment guideline.

Thank you Paul, the number is as only as good as the numbers you stick into the
formula. Therefore, I need to look at five years of growing earnings or some
earnings time series that has a low variance (YoY). Again I am trying to use
this calculation as a quick and dirty first screen other than just using PE.

The other thing that crossed my mind was with NG at historical lows could KRA
benefit from these low input prices. On the flip side, a lot of their products
go into the building industry which may continue slow.

Heresay is that Sony has the best camera sensors on the market, at least for
high end SLR and cellphone camera applications(for the latter size is a major
constraint). I also believe, based on Sony's history that it is one of their
signature products where they still have a technological edge (there aren't
many left) which means that they will spent considerable R&D $ to keep it that
way. I believe that OVTI may have a cost advantage, since they outsource their
manufacturing to TSMC very modern and well run plants but in the high end,
performance counts and Sony's sensors seem to be where this is at.

This is gleaned from internet sources as well as comments from a colleague from
work who follows this field. It's hearsay, so take it with a grain of work. The
mass market for Sensors is very competitive and low margin. if OVTI is stuck
there, they will have trouble achieve decent results.

Based on what I know, OVTI is not necessarily a riskless buy, imo.

Yes, I'm out as well. Hes is coming back after the downgrade though. Also have
a sizeable position in JBSS as margins are expanding and earnings are after
close today. If they beat last years $.48 we are off to the races I think. I
know it is a low margin business but if this market is earnings driven it
should get a bump up.
