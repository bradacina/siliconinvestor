Mike, how about a company called Nortek from Providence, RI, dealing in
residential building products, air conditioning and heating products,
plumbing, indoor air quality, etc. This company will earn at least
$1.75 per share this year ending Dec 31, 1996. It currently trades
around $14 per share for a PE ratio of 8. Management has successfully
turned this company around the last 5 years, but wall street analysts
continue to assign it a low PE ratio.

Valueline currently has this stock ranked as a 2. The company has
repurchased 2.2 million shares so far this year, and is now buying
back another 500,000 shares apparently between 14 and 14 3/4.
Mario Gabelli has owned 2 million shares for at least the last 5 years.
Prior to the latest repurchase, there were 9.5 million shares of
common and 0.5 million shares of special common (more voting rights)
still left. The reason for the buyback is that the company thinks its
shares are significantly undervalued.

Do you have any opinion on this company? Yahoo news has the latest
earnings reports ,etc.

Thanks, Harlan

Gents, How about a company called Beazer homes on NYSE,(BZH) trades at

(Probably undervalued since some of it is land purchased in early 90's)
Wait it gets better
CEO Beazer just named head of AmerHome Build Assc, they are buying
back shares and there is a convertible preferred which pays 8%.
Growing like crazy, seem to have a good product

Scott and Harlan,

I worry about BZH's LT debt load relative to available cash of
only 1 million. Most of current assets are inventories, which
are substantial, but is expected. I wonder why BZH didn't rally
with the other home builders earlier this year.

NTK blows me away. I'll be buying ASAP. Love the way they
are buying back shares. They too have lotsa debt, but also
have a significant cash position of about 4 bucks/share.

My pick, PRMO, gained like a point and a half today, so I wonder
about its value, but still it has 5.5 bucks cash and lotsa potential.
Good luck. I welcome any other views.

To all:

PROVIDENCE, R.I., Oct. 28 /PRNewswire/ -- At the Nortek, Inc. (NYSE:
NTK) annual shareholder meeting, Richard L. Bready, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, announced that the Board of Directors has
authorized a program to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of the
Company's common stock, subject to market conditions and cash
availability.

Citing a belief shared with Nortek's Board, Bready said, "At the
current market price our common stock continues to be significantly
undervalued and does not properly reflect the current or potential
value of our Company." Nortek shares closed Friday at $14.50. Bready
said the Company expects to make purchases in open-market or
negotiated transactions. This is the third buy-back program Nortek
has announced in the past 12 months. Altogether, 2.4 million shares
were purchased during the two previous programs.

In his annual address to shareholders, Bready reported strong
earnings gains for Nortek and an improving economy in 1996.
He also said he was "bullish" about Nortek's future, noting the
Company's leading role in indoor- air-quality technology and the
growth prospects arising from its presence in the global marketplace.

During the regular business portion of the annual meeting, the
following Directors were re-elected to three-year terms on
Nortek's Board: William I. Kelly, Director of Northeastern
University Graduate School of Professional Accounting;
and J. Peter Lyons, President of the J. Peter Lyons Companies.
A shareholder proposal to amend the By-laws of the Company,
which would have changed the current mechanism for shareholder
nominations of directors, was defeated.

Nortek, Inc. manufactures and markets residential, commercial
and industrial building products. This release contains forward-
looking statements relating to future financial results. Actual
results may differ as a result of factors over which the Company
has no control, including the strength of domestic and foreign
economies, slower than anticipated sales growth, price and product
competition and increases in raw material costs. Additional
information which could affect the Company's financial results
is included in the Company's annual report and on Forms 10-K and 10-Q,
on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

I marked NTK in the last Value Line report. Still debating a position. A pretty
decent report, but with some caution looking forward...

"However, the real test will be 1997. Given its cyclical nature, the company
often follows a strong year with a mediocre one. Nortek is attempting to combat
this problem by shifting its product mix towards higher-end goods and expanding
overseas. The company has gained access to a number of potentially lucrative
foreign markets through its 1995 acquisition of Best SPA, a range-hood
manufacturer headquartered in Italy. Best SPA sells premium Euro-style range
hoods throughout Europe, the Middle East, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.
Nortek also purchased two other home-furnishing businesses last year, Raingaire
and Venmar Ventilation. All told, these acquisitions have boosted revenues by
close to 15% this year, and they are already making a solid contribution to the
bottom line. Still, the company has yet to prosper during an economic slowdown,
a distinct possibility in 1997."

Decent upside potential, limited downside, FMPOV.

Fancy meeting you over here. I think we've met on several other

for me to be cautious; I bought in 1600 shares today. That
management has bought in 2.4 million shares and wants to buy
more back at current levels just blows me away. You just don't
see many companies doing that in this often overpriced market.

I am also counting on the overseas expansion -- another point that
sold me -- to help buffer any US recessionary sequelae.

Mike, according to ValueLine, Richard Bready, the CEO, bought 48,000
shares when the price was 12 7/8 on September 24, 1996. I presume he
exercised stock options, so I have no idea what he actually paid for
his shares. Nevertheless, I would view this as somewhat encouraging.

The view that Nortek will have to perform better next year than this
year is well taken. I'm confident they can beat last year's 4th
quarter this year, and for the first quarter next year, they only have
to beat $0.19, since the first three months of last year were a horrible
winter all across the country with a very adverse impact on home
building. Of course, they probably really have to beat wall street
expectations for their earnings, and I don't know what those are for
next year.

However, the major overridding concern might be whether the bull market
ends before Nortek's stock can get going. Some of the guests on
Wall Street Week are predicting that the small cap stocks, many of
which are under tax loss selling now, will play catch up to the big
cap stocks once the "January Effect" gets underway after Thanksgiving
or in the first quarter. I hope they are right. Clearly, the big
cap stocks seem to having a blow off right now.

Good luck on your investment. I am invested in NTK at $13 so I don't
have any huge profit yet. Since the company keeps buying back shares,
the liquidity gets less all the time, and I hope this doesn't scare
off all of the fund managers, who like to be able to move in and out of
their positions in a relatively short period of time.

Perhaps, the company will buy back more shares in the first quarter,
I hope so, because if they did so AGGRESIVELY, this would really
drive up the price of their stock, at least on a temporary basis.

Thanks for the info. I agree with your assessment of the
current market risk to NTK. The thing that I appreciate about
their buyback is it shows a definite interest in stock price,
and a lessening of the gap between shareholder and management
interests. If the management are big shareholders and highly
focused on return on equity, this can only be a good thing.

I like the thread.

Value investing...as in, buy something when "all is quiet". When the stock just
drifts along...when no one seems to like it...when the company is trying to
keep things quiet and insiders are accumulating...when the silence is designed
to shake you out of your position.

I am learning...you don't just throw money at an idea whatever the price. You
also pay attention to the cycle of silence (accumulation), markup, and
promotion. Some stocks scream accumulation when there is an almost unnatural
silence for a long time, and unbelievably low volumes.

Why buy a stock when it's expensive and noisy when you can get it cheap and
quiet?

This could be the smartest thread on SI if we keep working on it and make it
clear to people that "value investing" doesn't mean piling into a stock when
it's under promotion. So show off your favourite picks folks but don't by all
means insult us with "OVERVALUED" stocks when we are supposed to be talking
value (cheap) here.

To this end I will be checking out the charts of each and every stock
recommended on this thread, and if I catch somebody recommending a stock (like
Iomega or Amati) when it is expensive and undergoing distribution so help me,

Mike, Redwood Empire Bancorp, symbol REB, on the AMEX, is selling
currently at 10.75, slightly above its book value of about 9.50. The
bank headquarters is in Northern California in Santa Rosa, CA. After
the merger of its thrift operations into its commercial bank operations
as described out on Yahoo news, it will be the 8th largest commercial
bank in Northern California. There are about 3 million shares. The
bank branches are located in Northern California. The stock went up
1/2 point on Friday, after the restructuring was announced.

I think this bank is a candidate for a buyout, but I don't know if this will
occur in 1997 or later. Since bank buyouts occur at 2 or 2.25 times book
values approximately, it would fetch about $20 per share or more.
Note the book value is solid, with virtually no good will, which is
often used to inflate a company's book value.

For someone with a one or two year horizon, this might be worth
considering. However, this could easily overlap with a stiff market
correction sometime in 1997, so one must be very cautious.

This is another example of a value play. This bank company is covered
by Piper Jaffray, so they would be the brokerage house to contact to
try to get information on the possibility of a buyout.

If anyone has an account with Piper Jaffray, maybe they can let us
know what they currently think. I used to do business with them, but
I switched to a discount broker, Schwab, so I no longer have access to
their research.

I would not buy until I got an update to date research report from
Piper Jaffray, written after the current restructuring last week and
had a one to two year time horizon.

Benchmark Electronics (BHE)

About 46% of its sales are in Europe, 25% in the U.S. and the remainder in
Asia, he says. Most of its manufacturing is done in Europe. The company has a
strong balance sheet and "trades at very attractive valuations relative to its
peers and to its own historical record," Mr. Meyer says. "It meets all of our
value criteria."

Benchmark makes printed circuit boards used in electronic, telecommunications,
medical instrumentation and testing and measurement equipment products. No one
company accounts for more than 15% of its business, he says.

He calls Benchmark "a very undervalued growth play," because it sells for about
10 to 11 times earnings, compared with about 14 times earnings for many of its
competitors. He says its business is growing about 30% a year. The company's
pending acquisition of EMD Technologies will move Benchmark into the top 10
companies in its industry in the world, Mr. Kennedy says.

Re: Merisel I would stay away.

LT debt at 152 million, Short term debt at 665 million. Market
cap under 100 million. Near all time lows. $3.90/sh
loss for quarter ending 9/30 including write-offs. Undergoing
restructuring with a recent Moody's downgrade (11/21) of its
senior notes to Ca. "Moody's is concerned about the timing of an
operations turnaround and the company's ability to meet substantial scheduled
debt repayments in 1997".

This is really risky business, IMHO. Though on the surface its

Re: Open Text

Thanks for setting us onto this one. Looks like a good one, though
I feel it is more a tech/growth pick than a value play. This is
what I found out:

Based in Ontario, went public in early 96 at 15/sh. High price
26.5, now at 6.5, >50% up from its low of 4 1/8. Most recent
quarter was a .22/sh loss, 86% of which was an operating loss.
But revenues are growing quickly, with plenty of new contracts
being added. Lots of momentum. Also, has >2.50/sh in cash and
cash equivalents, so the business is valued at 4.

Optimistic statements from management abound. Couldn't find
a report on their debt load, probably because they don't have
any.

True. Merisel is risky. But it is also a huge company with billions in sales.
The feeling on the thread has been incredibly bearish at times...overly so
perhaps. If they can meet their debt obligations they are worth more than $2 a

Thanks for the feedback. Here's one that's recommended in Forbes

You can buy MDR for $1/sh excluding it's assets in cash and
JRM stock, according to the article. Yet that $1 includes
about 1.3 billion in short and long term debt, and accelerating
losses/flat revenues. Can a new CEO help? I am doubtful,

You are very right that they may trade at a discount for a considerable period.
One thing to look for is a fund trading at the upper end of its historical
discount, presuming that there are not reasons for the divergence from
historical ranges.

Nothwithstanding the observation that the discount may continue, to me, there
is some comfort to buying a fund on the cheap, and having that extra money
working for me.

I think that these types of stocks are not generally a trading vehicle, but
rather a long term hold.

And who knows, the discount may even disappear if you hold long enough,
particularly if the fund does well.

In summary not a fool-proof strategy, and maybe somewhat simplistic, but it
gives me some comfort, and should certainly be considered for part of a
portfolio.

Contra opinions also appreciated!

Mike,

Interesting article...

I do have a little experience in this type of situation where one big company
owns a lot of another big company and both publicly trade. I can remember
Petrie Stores owning quite a load of Toys R Us when, TOY was making a big move
in the early 90s. Petrie stock was low, the common logic was, and the value of
the Toys R Us stock in their portfolio was worth almost as much as Petries
stock was trading for.

I remember reading the business press and seeing this mentioned more than once.
Buy Petries and get the stores for free, because the TOY was worth so much.
Thank God I checked into this more at the time.

You see old man Petrie couldn't get rid of the stock because he himself was
somehow entangled as an owner of the TOY shares too. He would have to face an
enormous tax on selling. It was really difficult to sort it out - where did
Petrie Stores investment start and where did Mr. Petrie's start. I think even
two years ago I read they were trying to find a way for Petrie to sell TOY
without incurring a real tax mess between his company and himself. Maybe this
has been resolved or maybe he has died?

Anyway, I am always cautious in this scenario, especially the higher the
ownership position is. It is not likely MCD will be divesting anytime soon.

As always, I advise your own research into any situation, especially here. One
final tip, Martin Whitman runs the Third Avenue Value Fund, he has a tremendous
reputation as a value investor. I believe his philosophy is that he won't buy
unless the stock trades less than one-half of what he thinks it is worth. I am
going to see if he has a web page and see if it lists his portfolio as some
funds do show.

Will advise if I find anything interesting.

They have the holdings of the fund listed. I remember from his prospectus that
he does not hold a lot of stocks in his portfolio but instead buys deep when he

He calls himself a vulture investor-likes deep discounts.

I've purchased 6 or 7 closed end funds in the last 2 years with good
success.
I always buy at a 20-30% discount a fund with a reasonably good track
record in an area Im positive about.
In this time I have had 2 of the funds closed down returning 100%
of assets, the others have risen with the market.
One thing to keep in mind with closed end funds over open end,
the MER is lower and the fund manager has an easier job (No cash
inflows or outflows to manage).

2 I bought in the last 4-6 weeks have the largest discount in
the world (according to Barrons closed end funds page)
1. EVT,Toronto Economic Investment Trust 30% discount
2. UNC,Toronto United Invest Corp 30% disc (approx)
Everyone is bullish on Canada, their stock portfolio is pretty well
all Canadian big cap. I feel the discount will reduce, the stocks in the fund
will go up and I'm collecting dividend's on $1 which Im buying for 0.70.

Justin,

The semi-equips really do seem to bleed true value. They
may be starting to awaken. What is your opinion on
evaluating semi equips? How does one value them? The PEG
has been panned as useless on semi equips. Is this
valid, or just a sign of the extreme bearishness that
has gripped these stocks for the last year? Also,
any book value would seem to be a useless guide,
as the technology changes so fast. Inventories seem
truly at risk in this industry. Any comments?

MIke,the main thing mike is wall street over reacted to the news
that semi weren't going to grow as fast and the market would be
over supplied causing prices to drop and so forth.. I
what i look for in evaluating semi stocksand all other stocks
is growth..along with
earnings. NVLS and IMPX. NVLS just two months ago went all the way
down to 38 dollars, which is nuts..It is easy to sleep at night
knowing your stock earns 6 dollars a share and the stock price is
38. the only place the stock can go is up..
The stock had 6.oo in earnings..
Even take a look at MU and other semi about two months ago.. The
stocks PE's were below their five year moving avg.. Go to
www.stocksmart.com. When you get a quote on a stock it tells
you at what discount a stocks pe to the overall sector.. it
also has a list of instutions buying or selling the stock.. along with
other helpful info.. I believe that site list sectors of stocks..
some of the info is outdated but most of it is informative.. anther
cool site is www.investorama.com another semi to look into is asyt

right now it is at 19 3/4 it has been as high as 21 today.. very volatile
but looks to be promising in the long run..

I think in the next year or so health stocks are going to make
run just like the semi's are going to do for the next several month..
the PE. on the semi and semi manufacturers are still relatively low.
I believe the semi's will continue their upswing.. When PE multiples
get to be above the average sell.. best returns justin

Mike,

On your last note about the health sector....

check USDL... it is way undervalued and is starting to trade heavily.
It is at 11 5/8 that is about 2 dollar jump over a week.
I say there might be about a week left of trading before it hits about 13 to 14
dollars. It has a low PE of 14! They have 116 MRI/Cat Scan centers. The sector
has been covered pretty heavily and a few buy calls have come out from the
brokerages.

I think this sector and biotech as well are really undervalued...

On that I heard a great way to value biotechs...

1. Look at the Market Value
2. Look at the Amount of money spent annually on R and D
3. When you divide the R and D by the Market Value if the number is a large
multiple (say 5 to 10X) then that is an undervalued stock.

if the multiple is a decimal... they are overvalued.

The idea is the more money you spend on R and D the more likely you have
products in the pipeline. See biotech stocks go up and down based on news of
first, second and third level trials and finally FDA approval and eventually
buyout or distribution of lead products by a big Pharm. Company. Plenty of time
to make money on these stocks.

Also you have to temper your Value analysis by looking at how much the company
has in its coffers. Example being Chiron which has a billion in spare change to
do future R and D. Watch this stock freak out as mutuals devour it.

Comments and suggestions on value-ing biotechs and health stocks welcomed!

Michael,

Been monitoring NTK, but do not have a position in it yet. How did you
calculate the $4 cash/share? Also, what P/E should we expect out of a supplier
of building supplies/equipment?

I like what I see...company aggressively buying shares back. But are they
draining the cash to do so?

I guess what I am asking is where should this stock be trading?

John
%EOM----------------------

%BOM---------------------
Date:12/7/1996 1:18:00 AM
From:Harlan Huber

John: Since NTK has been purchasing most of their shares back here
recently between $14 and $15 per share, 500,000 shares will only cost
them about 7.5 to 8 million dollars, so that will not drain their cash
reserve that much, which,I think,is at least 40 to 60 million dollars.
The company has long term debt of about 250 to 280 million dollars,
of which 200 million is financed at 9 7/8%, and significant amounts
of repayment are not due for at least several years out from here.

Since the company feels their shares are significantly undervalued,
and I agree, especially when you look at how eagle hardware and garden
(EAGL) was recently run up to $30 per share before it dropped back down
to $20 per share recently, I think it would be very worthwhile if
someone could call Richard Harris, the VP who handles investor relations
for NTK at (401) 751-1600 on Monday, and try to find out from him what the
company thinks is a fair value for their shares in this market. My
guess would be easily from $20 to $25 per share at peak stock price.
I don't know if he can or would be willing to answer such a question,
but if someone has the courage to call on Monday and were willing to
post the reply here, it would be extremely valuable and reassuring.

Another question would be: "what happens after the company completes
buying back 500,000 shares and announces so in a news release?" Will
this cause investors to start selling, or might the company buy back
more shares?

But a more fundamental question which nows needs to be addressed is the
market risk to all stocks, growth and value. Since the market is
starting to show signs of cracking, could profit taking on the big
cap stocks cause pneumonia for all stocks, big and small cap. My
concern is that if the big cap stocks in the DOW 30 start to get hit
by profit taking, since the DOW 30 has such a powerful psychological
impact on investors, will it turn them into nervous wrecks that will
start selling all stocks or start to seek redemptions from their
mutual funds?

We can not take it for granted that the institutions will simply shift
their investing into the smaller cap stocks, it would be nice if they
did so. Also, I hope this overall market holds up at least until the
end of the first quarter earnings reports near the end of January,
1997, as NTK will report record earnings for the fiscal year ended
December, 1996, and their earnings should be reported near the end of
January, 1997. With these low interest rates, they should have an
excellent year in fiscal 1997, unless interest rates spike back up
significantly.

Does anyone have an opinion how long before a market correction starts
in earnest? After the earnings report near the end of January, there
is a vacuum until the next earnings report near the end of April, and
the market risk factor goes up significantly. However, that is normally
a period of heavy IRA money flowing into the market.

I don't think we can entirely ignore Alan Greenspan's remarks about
the market being overvalued, although that is a broad statement and
many of us feel that lots of it is overvalued, but some parts of it is
not overvalued.

I think most reasonable investors realize that this market is overextended. I
feel we've all made money and there's no reason to hold out for the bull's last
legs. As I posted before, I am in over 70% cash at the moment.
I feel very strongly that there is the potential for not simply
a correction, but a crash. Plot the monthly Dow back 40 years,
and you'll see what I am worried about. Interest rates are
saving this market for the time being, but for how long?
Interesting fact -- if you had put your money in the Dow in the
late sixties, even by 1983 you would still be at a loss.

>if you had put your money in the Dow in the late sixties, even by 1983 you
would still be at a loss.

That's not quite right, the Dow doesn't include dividends or reinvestment of
dividends. In order to calculate the rate of return, you should add in the
dividends; and the price appreciation and dividends generated on shares
purchased using these dividends. If you did, I believe the return would be over
5% per year over the period you mentioned (1969 to 1983). And this is for the
unlikely event of a one time lump sum investment. A more likely scenario is a
stream of savings and investments for most investors. For example, $2000
invested per year. Then the return for those years jump substantially.For more
on this, see some of the analysis at the Motley Fool site fool.com as well as
any number of books on long term market returns including the classic "Random
Walk Down Wall Street" by Burton Malkiel.

But your point is still valid. There could be a long period where the market
return is low.

The question now is whether the market is too high. In my opinion, not yet. The
current forward PE of 16-17 times next year's earnings is in line with LT
interest rates of 6.5%. We have inherently a far less risky world than we have
seen so far this century, so the risk premium stocks get over bonds should
narrow.

But most people say they have bought into the long term buy and hold strategy,
and are plowing money into the market at a record rate. The 401k accounts and
IRAs are channeling huge amounts into the market . There are hordes of salesman
selling things like variable deferred annuities or life insurance where the
payments are channeled into the stock market. There are sound reasons for these
accounts to exist and for people to do this. Manias often starts with a
fundamentally sound investment theme. But I believe that this huge flow of
funds will drive financial assets prices much higher over the next several
years. Stocks will be priced at a parity or a premium to bonds.

When the projected return on stocks is less than bonds or real estate (the
other major investment vehicles for individuals), people's behaviors will
change and we will get a lengthy period of down or consolidating market. I live
in California and have just experienced a cyclical period just like this in
real estate.

Thanks for starting this thread. I have been analyzing BHE and 13 competitors

Also I have been investing in closed end funds for some time, and I will share

You got me. What I meant was that if one was using the Dow as a
barometer for the market you would have lost money by holding 1969 - 1983
(during which one could die or any number of events could
occur). The broader market tends to more or less track the Dow,
and most don't have dividends.

As it stands, 5% annual return would still have lost money over that period
because inflation was so rampant. Most market historians
agree that the crash in the early 70's was worse than even 1929
because inflation was so high. People were losing money on two
fronts. Of course, no crash can stand with 1929 when it comes
to impact on the country.

I look forward to your analysis.

If we have indeed repealed the business cycle here in the US
then there is little risk in the stock market. Go ahead and
calculate the stock value by next-year's earnings estimates,
multiply by current-year growth rate, add inflation etc.
Stocks in the S & P have what, an average multiple of 24?
When the overall economy has growth of 2-3%, inflation at 3-4%,
something has to budge. The question for your cash today is,
when one of these PE=24 companies miss an earnings report,
maybe even two, what is the stock going to be worth, and at what
point would you open your wallet and buy in? Also when the
stream of earnings reports are not so rosy causing all anticipated

I e-mailed Nortek for an investor package, which I rec'd today. I have not read
it except that as of 4/25/96, Oppenheimer was very positive that the repurchase
of shares is a powerful catlyst for NTK's stock price. this was after the first
million, but before the second million was purchased.

"Should NTK complete its 1 million share repurchase program during 1996 (which
we know it already has), we would add $1.68 in value to our price target,
bringing our price target to $19-20 by year end." They assume a P/E of 12

John: As of 6-30-96, Oppenheimer owned 54,200 shares of NTK, so I
imagine they would be bullish on it. Seriously, I would like to see
NTK punch through 16 1/8 here pretty soon (the all time high for the
last 10 years) and get rolling toward 20. Today, it declined on light
volume down to 15 3/8 and then it was purchased on larger blocks (one
at about 8,000 shares) back up to 15 3/4 at the close. Thus, the
company was buying today or some other people. I don't know the rules
about a company buying its own shares, whether they have to buy on
down or flat ticks, or whether they can buy aggresively on up ticks?

I have seen NTK as high as 24 before, but that was about 15 years ago
or so. By the way, earlier this year, Mario Gabelli was calling for
a target price of 24, but since he owns 2.1 millions shares, he probably
is not unbiased.

I don't know how close the company is to completing buying their
500,000 shares that they mentioned on OCT 28, 1997, and what will
happen then.

The funds seem to chasing many of the same stocks today as they did
before Alan Greenspan's speech. If the DOW continues to run this hot
up to Dec 17, I'm afraid Alan might raise interest rates 0.25% to
back up his speech. I hope not.

Don't know what the rules are for re-purchasing of shares by a company. I would
assume that it would have to be on at least an uptick.

I have now read the entire packet..interesting comment by the Oppenheimer
analyst that the market would view their heavy cash differently if they did not
make accretive acquisitions or the stock re-purchases.

the thing that most appeals to me is the heavy share buybacks. This is one of
the most solid evidences that management believes in their company's future. In
addition, the management seems to talk a lot about getting the stock price up,
which most companies seem to give mild lip service to.

On the negative side, it seems that this stock is a slow riser. Maybe the stock
buybacks will hit the general market's radar screen and bump up the price
nicely.

stock has sold about this price (18) or better every year since '92
should be able to easily (???) make 50% gain in 2 years: 14 to 21
(and maybe it'll all come at once late in 2nd year!)

at 14 with .28 div., that's a market multiple yield
lotta smart people liked it at much higher prices (Better Investing, S&P,others

Can these guys make any money? I say yes.

You took me much too literally. I kinda flippantly said I was
desperate, but that was really a veiled market commentary more
than anything. I'm pretty much ignoring the market right now
because I'm starting to feel that no matter how much value
one can buy now, if one waits, there will be a better value
(that is, after the market corrects/crashes/collapses). After,
all, the Dow's up about 10% in just over a month. Given that
it's been around for decades and decades, and that it's grown over
40% in the last two years, When the slope on the Dow chart starts
to approach infinity I cash out and tune out.

In any case, what was the reason for the sudden loss last
quarter in OLS?

I'm a value investor, and one of my picks right now for long-term
value is Mackie Designs (MKIE), an audio electronics company. The price on this
stock (just look at the chart some time -- not a pretty sight) has been falling
steadily for many months. The price hit a new low yesterday. Yet this company
has no debt, very loyal customers, a solid industry reputation, and a whole
bunch of new digital products coming out in 1997.

The only big downside I see is competition from bigger companies including
Yamaha. More players, more slices of a pie that isn't getting bigger as fast as
the number of players is growing. And I think this is why people have dumped
MKIE stock. Mackie has shown it can successfully differentiate itself and its
products from the rest of the pack and the big challenge of 1997 will be if it
can do that again with the new product line.

The CEO/Founder owns 41% of the common stock, other insiders own a whole bunch
more. Institutions have all but dumped this stock. I think they're being too
harsh. MKIE's P/E is much lower than its annual rate of growth.

I own and use Mackie products (32*8 mixer) and MKIE stock and would love to
hear what others think about this company.

DSWLF (Deswell Industries) recently raised it's dividend from .38
to .50 annually (paid semi-annually). It has a P/E about 6 and is
growing at 15-20% both top and bottom line. It looks on track to
earn $1.60 this year. They also bought another factory and claim
that just internal use should double the sales. The Investment
Relations firm that handles this company can be reached at
212 838 3777 x101. I expect it to break through 12 some time in the
next 6 months. There are warrants also where 2 warrants can buy the stock at
$9.06 until the year 2,000. They are trading at or below a dollar now. The
warrants are a good buy if they get down to .75 since the strike price is
$12.06 so the warrants might not trade for too much more than $1.75 each if
they call the warrants. If they don't call them, I imagine the stock could
easily trade with a P/E of 10 if the consistent earnings growth for the last 5
quarters continues. This would be $16.00 stock and a $3.50 for the warrants.

There are 3 main advantages
1. Pays interest or a dividend (Usually the common pays 0%)
2. Has a maturity date(in the case of a bond)when you get the original issue
price back.
3. If the company goes belly up, you are paid off before the
stock holders.(You are a creditor,not an owner)

Deswell Industries is located in Hong Kong. The telephone number you give is in
NYC. I have several questions:
1. What happens during the transition to PRC rule?
2. How confident are you in the accounting practices at this firm?
3. Are you connected with the firm other than as a shareholder?
4. The stock dropped over 20% in one day this summer. What caused this price
action?
5. Does this firm face new competition from mainland competitors?
6. There is only a float of 1.5 million of the 4.55 million shares outstanding.
Who controls the rest?

To the thread:
I am moving money overseas, but I prefer to use Tweedy Browne Global Value
Fund. This mutual fund is run using Benjamin Graham value investing theory. In
fact the Tweedy Browne firm was founded in 1920 and served as Graham's broker.
The have never had an investment manager leave The Firm; they work until they
retire or die. They started two mutual funds about four years ago.

You can get information on the funds by calling (800) 432-4789. Call and get
the info even if you don't want to invest. The prospectus and reports they send
you are well worth reading. And you get a list of their current holdings.
Usually in every letter or report, they discuss several of their stocks to
"illustrate" their investment strategy.

I also buy closed end foreign funds traded in the US on dips. I purchased a
Czech fund CRF at a discount of 15% just prior the recent elections several
weeks ago, and I purchased Central European Fund CEE on the dip in the German
market last Friday at a discount of about 24%. These funds don't hedge back to
dollars, whereas Tweedy Browne does. Although they aren't as good managers as
TB, I bought them recently because I belive the dollar won't continue to rise
against most major foreign currencies, and because of the discounts.

Paul,
You ask good questions.
1. I have no idea what is going to happen with the PRC transition.
I imagine that the powers to be won't want to upset the apple cart,
but I'm definitely not an expert with an opinion to be valued. I do no that a
lot of negative assumptions are built into the price, and that I have a feeling
the worries are overblown.
2. I have no way of knowing how accurate the accounting practives are. I do
know that they purchased 64% of Kwanta for $929,000 US cash and they raised the
dividend from .185 semi-annually to .25. I saw the dividend payment credited to
my account. So, there is a good chance they do have cash, and maybe all the
profits the books claim.
3. I own a few hundred shares and a few thousand warrants. I posted a long
message on the other 'value investing' board, not realizing this one existed
also. Check out ELXS,BONT and BMLS also. I own each of these also to a much
greater degree. BMLS & ELXS have had almost no shares sold in the last 2 days
of frantic selling. Shareholders are pretty confident of the value there.
4 I have no idea what caused the one day selloff this summer. I imagine that
most stocks with small float will dive if a large shareholder has to sell &
there is no audience. Or, maybe someone bought the warrants and shorted the
stock for a quick play, since the warrants had almost no premium in them.The
good news is that it has recovered.
5. I'm sure they face competition. They seem to have established good
relationships with some major OEM's like Nam Tai and Mita Industries. Still,
the seem to grow 20% year over year consistently. Also, KWANTA (the new
purchase) had sales of 1.6 million in 1996. They expect to increase this
200-250% according to the press release just through Deswell's existing
customer base. In the April 10 release, it stated the machine they just
purchased was a state of the art injection molding machine with 1600 ton
clamping force. I doubt that there are too many machines like that out there.
6. I don't know who controls the float. A press release on Sept 30,1995 said
that inside ownership was 64.23% of 5,725,000 shares
(maybe including the warrants) The July 19, 1995 prospectus said that Richard
Lau, C.P.Li and C.W. Leung all owned 974,210 shares and Nam Tai owned 477,370
shares. If this is still accurate, then the relationship with Nam Tai should be
rather solid. I can check Telescan for insider trading as I don't have any
records on that handy.
Hope I answered you questions. Richard

John: Several months ago, ValueLine had an earnings estimate of
$1.75 for the year ending Dec 30, 1996. Currently, the company has
earned $1.35 for 9 months. As you probably know, the web site
http://www.wsrn.com/home/companyResearch.html
gives some very useful information about any company you desire,
and their stock smart estimate is $1.80 for the year. I believe
Zacks estimate is also in the range $0.40 to $0.45 for the fourth
quarter, but I no longer know where to find a free Zacks estimate on
the internet.

Also, if you look at the 10Q available at the web site I mentioned,
the 10Q filed on Nov 5, 1996, it shows that the company has a 21
million dollar capital loss carry forward, of which 17.5 million will
expire in 1997. I am not an accountant familiar with how the tax
laws have changed recently, so I don't know how much credit this would
yield against their income tax in 1997.

Ignore Granville. Try Lombard site for link to Zack's estimates.

I got into Zack's using a banner ad on the Lombard site yesterday. Today I went
back and used the ad again. If I go to the www.ultra.zacks.com/ site, they ask
that I sign up for free 30 day trial. But using the Lombard banner ad, they
just ask for my e.mail address, and it sends me right to the page where I can
select Company info then search for specific company earnings. Probably in 30
days, they will shut me off, but in the meanwhile I got the info on Nortek
earnings:

Only one analyst with a recommendation - medium buy.
Current fiscal year E = 1.80
Next fiscal year E= 2.10

Last Q= 0.64 Current Q= 0.41 (seasonal business?)

By the way, I think this thread is quiet for three reasons:
1.It is hard to find "value" investments.
2.Most investors at the SI site are "growth" investors; or GARP investors
(Growth At a Reasonable Price). Some are growth at any price. And a lot are
traders.
3.Readers are doing research and that takes time and work.

I definitely fall into the last category. I am spending a significant amount of
time chasing down and studying the leads I've gotten here. But I keep an eye on

Paul,
I have plenty of 'value stocks' as far as my definition of value.
Some trade below book.
Some have P/E's of 7 or less.
Some have 10% yields that are rising.
Some are turnarounds in progress.
Some are actually breaking out to new highs, but have very low P/E's

Here's a few samplings.
BONT - turnaround. Nov had 17% same store sales, though this is skewed
by extra Chrismas shopping in November. Next year could earn .75 - 1.00
Also, BONT is trading at a fraction of book. Will have store closings soon.
BMLS - turnaround. trading below book. Last qtr had strong earnings
turnaround. Company earned .92 in 1994 and may do the same next year.
Big news is the automated machinery they took delivery of in 1995 and
ate up profits through 1st 1/2 this year fine tuning it. Now labor is
off by more than 50% on jobs using the machine and re-dyes are way down.
ELXS- Huge, Huge, Huge accumualtion recently. Normally trades 10,000 or
less shares per day. 167,000 and 105,000 or so in last 2 days. The
company has restaurants and experienced a tough winter due to New England
snows. Now is experiencing difficulties in maintaining sales in an
acquisition chain that forced them to speed up conversions to their
Bickfords. probably will earn .75 or more this year and .90 next year.
Consistent mangaement for 5 previous years raising earnings from .49 to
.59 to .69 to .79 to .89. They also bought back 1,000,000 shares out of
6 Million in 1994/1995. I wouldn't be surprised if they are the ones
buying the shares in the last 2 days. P/E is 8 or so.
SNSR- new company hovering near high. P/E is 9 times 9 month earnings.
MLWL - trading near 10 or 11 times earnings, just broke out to new highs.

Dogs that are probably way oversold that look strong technically -
Be careful about one last wave of year end tax selling.
ADEX
OLGC
MNPI
HRT
BCU - One of it's competitors MEOHF is breaking out of a few year
trough, yet BCU is at it's low and looks like earnings are slowly
coming back. Yield may be 10% or higher this year.
FRP - Fertilizer prices are down. This yields 11-12%. POT- another
fertilizer company has seen it's shares rebound recently.

REIT's paying 10% or more with rising FFO.
REA-10-1/2% yield. Low payout rate of 70% of FFO. Most REIT's are 80-85%
Raises the dividend 1/8 cent every quarter. owns apartements. 4 in Denver
This is my biggest position.
MAL-11% yield. Owns a lot of strips anchored by K-Marts. Just released
an empty anchor last month. Still has 2-4 empty anchors.
GLR- 8% yield. Up 50% this year. They are apparently the only company
helping make deals for not-for-profits buying Nursing Homes.

more undervalued that are growing.
MAX-Great management in a slow growth industry. P/E about 10. I think
they may grow earnings 15% or more this year.
MODA- Need to see another quarter, but potential is huge. Earned .15 in
last quarter after only .01 previous. trading near it's high
DSWLF- already discussed. Hong Kong risk. P/E is 6. Dividend is 5%.
INT- P/E of 13-15. On a strong run.
LUKN- low projected P/E near high

OJ- P/e around 8 in a cyclical industry. Pretty good management.
RHT- strong move made recently, wait for a pullback to 4-1/8 or so.
P/E around 9. President keeps buying more stock every 3 months or less.

I own a small position in most of these. ELXS, BMLS, REA are the ones
that I like the best and have the biggest positions. ADEX, MLWL, and
OLGC may move the fastest when they move.

Richard

Rick, re: OLS. Yes, you bring up good points here. Don't know how long OLS in
medical temp field. I suspect some testing of the waters before the big
purchase of Lifetime Corp. in 1993. OLS provides home health care such as:
"nursing services, infusion therapy, home medical equipment,
physical/occupational/speech therapies, repiratory therapy, rehabilitation
services, and pediatric and perinatal care." Also management services for
hospital-based home health departments.

Yes, agree - - hard to assess risks and impact. Big contracts beget big
competition. Manpower (+16% ytd stock price change, per today's newspaper), and
Kelly Services (-4.5%) and OLS (-46%) compete here, so possible stability(??)
of large contract suggests(??) lower (or no??) profit margins for the winners
of such contracts. Also perhaps germane and significant: increasing numbers of
medicare patients being served by HMO's rather than service providers - Aetna
types - which affect cost reimbursements from gov't to OLS. Not a pretty
picture here! And of course, OLS's other businesses (staffing services) also
face competition, probably intensifying from previous years.

So! Where are we? Are the negatives known and reflected in the stock price?? I
see a company facing new challenges, but a company used to competition and
risks. Management owns a bunch of the stock. The company tries new things -
e.g. purchaser of a legal services company and of an information technology
company. There seems to be money available(?) (until debt ballooned!) and
resources (a large national and growing international presence). The stock is
near its lows of the past few years. I say the company - the stock - will come
back. (Paul Senior famous last words >g< !!!) It'll take some time, and maybe
the stock will go lower in the interim, but there is a case now to be made for
this stock to be included in a value investor's portfolio. Paul.

The Napeague Letter has just published a review of 20 small-cap stocks which
are followed in Value Line. Nortek (NTK) was among them.

The entire write-up on NTK is a bit long to post here, but my conclusions were
that "Although this stock appears to be the most undervalued of the four in
this segment, it is carrying a substantial debt load, which has increased in
recent quarters. A long-term view shows that NTK was priced in excess of $18.00
in 1986, and fell to under $1.50 as a result of the 1990-91 "recession".
Technical signals for this stock are currently ambiguous."

money management was on the sell side. Any ideas on high NTK can go?
I expect outstanding earnings to be reported in late January, but its
still a long ways away. At these mortagage rate levels, NTK should
have even a better 1997. The big risk of course is the market itself

Good luck Mike, you are doing what we should all do, focus on work

you, shorting NSCP is risky. I used to think the same way. Now I believe that
their Intranet business is going to make them major dough and the threat to
Netscape Navigator is even exaggerated. Navigator is faster!! (If not better.)
And MSFT hasn't taken over completely. The key is Netscape's cash in my view,
it's given them a nice window of time and free money to undertake various
acquisitions. Shorting them, like AOL (another industry leader which seems like
a good short) is too risky IMO. Short Prodigy or something like that!

To Mike....PATIENCE!

You may see the market tank after the first of the year. Astute investors are
keeping their eyes focused on interest rates and signs of inflation. Inflation
is currently under control, but Alan Greenspan has backed himself into a tight
corner...if he raises interest rates to cool the euphoria being experienced in
the equity markets he RISKS having the dollar RISE in value...hurting the
corporate profits of international conglomerates. Another side effect of
raising short term rates too much or too quickly is that the Fed chairman RISKS
having an inverted yield curve. An inverted yield curve is a leading indicator
of a recession. Remember the stock market is a LEADING indicator on the growth
of the economy. What Greenspan did is called jawboning. His words WERE
carefully chosen. You are a young man...focus your sights on a long-term
investment strategy. It helps to reduce the anxiety. Happy Holidays.

suppose in your scenario, the fed holds steady, money supply via m1-3 is tight,
bank lending is tight and the economny cools, do you the think the fed would be
able to lower rates given, Mr Greenspan's stance; could we see a recession if
the fed just holds steady--also , could you give other leading indicators of
recession thanks

Doc,

Buy and hold becomes mantra at the end of a bull market.
Buy and hold becomes anathema at the end of a bear market.
Thanks to the raging bull for those 10 years, everyone is preaching buy, hold,
patience.
However, if you had invested in the market in 1969, you would
be at a significant loss in 1983, especially given the high
inflation of the times and the down market. In the early 50's, the common logic
was that stocks simply don't go up, thanks to the doldrums market from the mid
30's to the mid 50's.
Why can't this market conceivably crash from these levels and not recover for
20 years? I guess I am just a bit of a contrarian.

Mike
