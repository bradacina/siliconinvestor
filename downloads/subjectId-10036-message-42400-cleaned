Found a Canadian micro cap stock close to being a net-net:

GAV.v C$ 0.49, Galvanic Applied Sciences

http://www.galvanic.com/

Trading at about liquidation value here.

Has 2 divisions: one based in Canada and another in US. Up until now the US one
was losing money but made an impressive turn around last quarter. Canadian one
making money but last quarter had one-time issue impacting earnings. At current
run rates excluding one-time issue, GAV will go at around PE of 5-6.

With a balance sheet so clean you could eat on it and being related to oil&gas
services which is booming, there&#180;s no way to justify the very low
valuation IMHO but for the low trading volumes ( trades by appointment only!)

Here&#180;s some further oversee of GAV&#180;s line of business by an O&G
expert:

http://siliconinvestor.com/nfvda/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=60282087

Interestingly, Jerry Zucker
http://www.canadianbusiness.com/ceos/article.jsp?content=20051107_72108_72108
owned about 5.8M shares or 37% of the stock of GAV, which is now in hands of
his surviving wife and kids through the Jerry Zucker Revocable Trust. Rumour
has it ( for what it&#180;s worth) that the Zucker family is planning to sell
out their stake now, which obviously would not go for anything as silly as the
current 0.48 X 0.54 quote.

I own some from low 40s but only now realized this was related to the "net-net"
concept which I discovered while looking into Jap stocks. This is as close to a
net-net I have ever seen in American stocks. Hope you like this better than my
lousy Ricoh pick. lol

US Energy says Thompson Creek terminates option to help develop Colo.

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/US-Energy-Thompson-Creek-apf-1602454171.html?x=0&

I thought the stock might sell off more but it could also be seen as a slight
positive since a new partner (and more option money) may be around the corner
for the Molybdenum mine development.

I believe they get to keep the original $500,000 in option money that Thompson
Creek paid them in 2008. I am not sure if TC paid the $1M (non refundable)
option fee each year from 2009 through 2011.

I know USEG was in the process of getting the environmental permits and were
more than 50% complete in the final permit process. I wonder if something came
up that made TC want to exit the deal.

Not too sure what the value is w/o the mine. USEG does not have the capital to
develop it on their own.

OSK. I didn't know that about OSK. Lot of good value investors in that one I

http://www.gurufocus.com/financials.php?symbol=OSK

Of course before I sold I did notice that OSK had good roe vs. p/e (my summary
interpretation of Greenblatt's work). Current high roe is of course
unsustainable. Average roe over past few years is pretty decent nonetheless
(for a government equipment supplier). (I usually like to use average roe when
I do my valuations.)

OSK has been very innovative in developing transport/armor vehicles for Afghan
geography. I'm just betting that military orders for OSK will decline if US
troops mostly depart Afghanistan. Given USA is an arms supplier, maybe OSK will
get new orders from middle east countries that are in turmoil.

For now, my preference is for electronic warfare related. So I'm still with

Anyway, he just told me Pierce is going to have a big layoff because nobody is

Perhaps I am deluded but the report to me is not as clear cut as it is to you.
i have been wrong before but I am not so quick to believe that Fidelity, Brean
Murray, the multiple CPA firms who looked at the financial books and other
data, are all misguided and someone I never heard of has come up with all these
" facts". Not to mention that GFRE has been working hand in hand with the
chinese govt to develop more bromine sources, and I doubt they want to end up
with egg on their faces. Having said that I certainly am not willing to put any
more into this. As it is I will take a huge hit if it turns out to be the fraud
thats implied. I certainly would like to see them buy back at least 5 million
shares at this price though .

As far as their being no legal redress for investors if in fact is a fraud I
think that is a very questionable statement to make. If the $68 million isnt
there the CPAs will be sued up the wazoo. if the company has knowingly overpaid
for assets owned by management that will be legallay addressed by the chinese
govt one way or the other. Since this statement is very questionable in of
itself it makes me wonder how many other questionable statements are contained
in this report.

The analyst from Bream Murray also visited each of the factories. Clearly he
was not aware of production variances from those report in the financials.

I just think if the fraud was so clear cut , the ceo would be in brazil by now.

Madharry,

I sincerely respect your investment ways. That you can hold on to what you
believe in. But with these Chinese reverse mergers there is a clear pattern of
fraud. If any of these "great" companies were not frauds their CEOs would be
mortgaging everything they have to buy every share that they can get. And they
don't need to announce share buybacks or anything like that, they would be just
doing it. I barely looked at the report. For me, the moment I saw the pattern I
got rid of everything Chinese. CCME, CCCL, GFRE is what I had. It just doesn't
make sense to me to hope that MY three choices are the safe ones. Maybe because
I don't have enough experience in investing. I have a lot of experience in
business in Eastern Europe and things there as far as mentality do not differ
much from China. There is no legal system as in North America. It is all
relatives friends and people with connections with the government. (remember
how they covered the tax fraud in Russia) Everybody takes a cut from what is
stolen. And if somebody has to go to prison he doesn't actually stay in prison,
just on paper.

Good luck to you and everyone invested in those reverse mergers. I am learning

Corruption. Well said. I don't need to be in the lead in picking countries that

companies a couple of years ago, and I took the USA bet.) There are plenty of
USA value stocks and dividend stocks to choose from.

Maybe OT: I just finished an enlightening book. "Backstabbing for Beginners"..

From amazon "Soussan, a former program associate for the United Nations,
provides an insider's perspective on the U.N.'s oil-for-food scandal in this
absorbing memoir. The author was a 24-year-old idealist when he went to work
for the U.N.'s recently launched program to provide aid to Iraqi civilians
suffering under the economic sanctions imposed after the Gulf War. He found a
culture of incompetence where there is no truth but consensus and initiative is
highly risky. Amid the turf wars and bureaucratic timidity at the U.N., Saddam
Hussein was able to subvert the oil-for-food program with a regimen of bribes
and kickbacks. Unable to persuade his superiors to expose the fraud, Soussan
resigned in frustration after three years. When the massive fraud surfaced
after Saddam's fall, the author published an op-ed piece in the Wall Street
Journal, which launched an independent investigation that uncovered billions of
dollars in bribes and implicated global corporations, sovereign governments and
U.N. officials...

me: Everybody was on the take. Saddam was allocating below market oil
deliveries to everyone -- france, turkey, russia, and who knows who else.
Example: putin's buddies got large allocations of oil. They'd sell them and
keep their share of the cash (and give some cash to putin, I am sure - not
proved) and they would send cash back to saddam via secure diplomatic pouch).
In a surprise ending, when you think that incompetence was holding the UN back
from exposing all the kickbacks, it turns out the author's boss, an honcho
undersecretary at the UN, was on the take too. He bottled up investigations and
exposure, and the author thought is was normal incompetence. It would have gone
on forever but saddam was overthrown and the kurds got some files and started
the exposure ball rolling.

The point is -- US executive are also greedy bastards, as we all know. But why
compound the investing problem by investing in areas that are even worse? Of
course, there are many large overseas companies that do not have such
corruption risk, TOT, BHP, RIO, and the like. Anyway, I avoid the foreign small
fry.

Good points Grommit -

My China & solar play is with EI DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD). It has taken
over three years but now they have over a $1.5B/revenue per year business with
a $500M factory in China. Most of their solar sales are in China but this year
they started to export their solar panels (manufactured in China) to other
countries too.

I suspect there were a lot of bribes made by DuPont & their Chinese partners to
obtain the necessary permits. Although at the time, their solar business was
not a pure play and in fact hardly moved the revenue needle for DuPont.
However, with time and timely capital investments by DuPont, their Solar
division is one of their fastest growing new business segments. Their solar
business generates almost 15% of their total revenues and continues to move the
revenue needle each year.

The stock has more than doubled from my first purchase. My only error was not
to buy more once they completed their manufacturing facility and began to
market their product in China.

Ford (another one of my small stub holdings) is building their business in
China too.

Jurgis, I skipped over Seiko 4963 because the revenue growth seemed to come
from an acquisition in 2003 or 2004. I don't think that the paper chemical
business is attractive either (paper demand is shrinking in developed countries
and Seiko PMC does not seem to have much export business).

M.O Steel looks better but you are correct that profitability is very low. I
basically passed over Mo tech because I was not able to glean any information
from my sources (everything is in Japanese PDF's that I can't translate). It
may be worth more work. I am looking for Japanese stocks that are cheap and
have a way to escape the shrinking economy, either via exports or foreign
subsidies.

Tsurumi 6351 Manufacturing sells their pumps all over the world, for example.
They serve the mining industries, utilities, landscapers etc. many of these are
pretty good markets.

I do think that the competitive standing and probably the management attitude
(difficult to gage) is more important than the net net valuation by itself.

My assumption is that many of them are value traps, but I think that is OK, as
long as the downside is limited. if you have a bunch of those and some go up,
while the other ones just sit there, the overall results would be decent and
the risk not that high. Such an outcome would be OK with me.

earnings of $1.49 per share, $0.18 better than the Thomson Reuters consensus of
$1.31; revenues rose 17.9% year/year to $12.19 bln vs the $12.1 bln consensus.
Outlouok: "In agribusiness, the favorable environment for our grain
merchandising business should continue. Global demand is good and farmers
around the world are responding to high agricultural commodity prices by
increasing crop production. Oilseed processing margins in South America should
benefit from higher utilization now that harvest is underway. Margins in Europe
should improve later in the year when stocks are replenished during harvest.
However, margins in the U.S. are likely to remain under pressure due to excess
capacity. In sugar & bioenergy, tight global sugar supplies and strong demand
for ethanol in Brazil should continue to be supportive of prices. Food &
ingredients should continue to perform well. However, pricing pressures in
edible oils will likely persist in certain markets, and wheat milling margins
will likely decrease as low-cost raw material inventories are replaced at
market prices. "In fertilizer, strong farm economics should result in increased
plantings and demand for fertilizer. Results in our fertilizer and sugar &

seasonality of the businesses."

Aero - I have followed the story of Steel Partners somewhat, when reading about
Japan. In my own weird way of thinking, it was a strong positive, because I
checked the prices of securities they were buying (Sapporo, Kikkoman etc.) and
the prices right now are way below what they paid.

I do think it is fairly naive for a Hedge fund to go into Japan, buy minority
stakes in some Japanese companies and think that they can run things the US
way. this would not work in Europe, probably most other countries in Asia much
less Japan.

I was reading up a book about the history of hedge funds (More money than
God's, the book is so so) and they have some stories about Germany (Hedge funds
buying stakes in German companies around the time and unification) that appear
to be factually incorrect. Also, the companies that they discarded (Bayer) have
outperformed comparable US companies as far as I can tell.

way. this would not work in Europe, probably most other countries in Asia much

It might be naive. However, it does show couple negative things. First, there
is no possible exit through activist minority shareholders. Second, there is
probably no exit through activist acquisition (buyout). Third, unless there is
a mentality change in Japanese management, things may not change for the
better. And the mentality change is quite unlikely (although you say that
things are changing in some companies).

These might not seem a big deal to you but in cumulative they definitely
depress the prices. Or in other words, we should put some discount because of
these issues. 20% maybe? And then Asahi is not so cheap anymore in your own
numbers. If you assume just 10% discount due to these, then things are still
cheap, but is 10% enough to compensate for loss of a number of catalysts/exit
options?

Now, US has its own set of issues, but then we didn't even touch the macro
Japanese issues (huge debt, old/shrinking population, no immigration, etc.) So
I'd say US-Japan is at par macro wise, maybe US is better. So I am still saying
maybe 20% discount for Japanese issues?

P.S. You cannot compare the situation to Europe. I was ignorant at the time,
but I should have realized that opening of Eastern Europe would be huge boon
for Euro cos/countries. IMHO most of the gains in Europe pre-2008/9-crash was
made based on unification/cheap Eastern Europe labor/growth of Eastern Europe
markets. Yes, Japan could/should have had similar effect with China, but
apparently it did not and I don't think the situation will change greatly in
the future. Part of the issue might be anti-Japanese sentiment in China.

Japan stocks as value traps? I maintain my opinion: the ones that are not
multinational like Toyota, Sony, etc -- are value traps.

That they are, or why they are, I guess depends on viewpoint. The linked author
believes that at least for the company he studied, the Japanese management
believed they were owners and that minority foreign holders were seen as
short-term traders and an "annoyance".

I've a background in the quality field and a decent stint as a student and
practitioner of Dr. W.E Deming, whom the Japanese idolized, and who many
believe is partly responsible for Japan's postwar rise as a leader in the
manufacturing of high quality products. Thus my perspective, which is this:

Deming speaking to Japanese leaders and government, whose country was in ruins
(1950):

What is the purpose of quality? High quality means lower costs (NOT HIGHER),
and thus, eventually (with lower production costs), more sales!

What is the result of more sales? More profits. AND MORE JOBS. Which is what
you (Japanese people circa 1950) need and want, that is -- jobs!

What is the purpose of profits? To recycle into more and better products and
quality. And thus MORE jobs.

--------
In my opinion this is still the mindset of many Japanese. In my view I see it
from the linked article about the Japanese government overruling or overriding
the hedge fund that owned more than 50% of the company. Namely, profits aren't
the goal of business - it's an intermediate step on the way to job creation or
continued employment. Profits may belong to the stockholders, but the profits
are there for economic welfare of the employees and the country. Profits are
not for the stockholders (controlling managers) to do what they wish (enrich
stockolders). Management is a caretaker of those profits. The Japanese
government is an overseer of the business, with the idea of nurturing and
protecting businesses (keeping jobs for Japanese). And individual Japanese know
this: one reason why very few Japanese invest for retirement in Japanese stocks
(except for some surges when markets rise and there's like a national interest
in options/speculating trading). (note to myself: and if I'm still right about
individual Japanese who won't invest in Japanese stocks, then why should I?)

---
Anyway, my view is there's little reason in general for any discrepancy between
asset value and stock price for these Japanese companies to be reduced. Thus,
in my view, they are value traps.

--
Just my opinion, I could be wrong. Or outdated. My outlook colored by a past
life experiences (1980's in the quality business)

Hello Jurgis,

Thanks for the NXY recommendation several months ago. I took my profits today
as I don't feel like it's as cheap valuation-wise as it was when I bought most
of my shares in the 22 range due to:

1) Increased taxes in the North Sea which seems to affect them more than
others.

2) Not great earnings this quarter making me question their projected p/e.

3) Questions on Yemen - Seems like their operations are still in place, but
will they be forever? And their lease is up for negotiations also? Tricky on
multiple levels...

So, with today's projected p/e and given the issues above, I felt ok taking
profits as I try to lighten a bit on oil. Thanks again for the idea here. I
will be watching this one.

Thanks,

Grant

Hi Grommit -

Followed you in on a starter position of Bunge Limited (BG). You are not the
only one bullish on commodities, check out what Jim Rogers thinks on the
subject when interviewed in Singapore yesterday.

An Exclusive Interview With Jim Rogers
By Brett Owens Apr 28, 2011 3:00 pm
http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/jim-rogers-james-rogers-chi
ese-renminbi/4/28/2011/id/34223

From the article:"...Agriculture is still his favorite, thanks to supply
constraints that are nowhere close to being solved – including a lack of
farmers.

“The average farmer in the United States is 57 years old,” Rogers shared
(providing me with yet another “how the heck did he know that offhand?”
moment).

“Who’s going to farm the land 10 years from now? These guys will be 67…if
they’re still around. And nobody is graduating with farming degrees today.”

“There are just not enough farmers in the world. There are vast stretches of
empty land in Japan, believe it or not – with nobody to farm them.”

<u>>He thinks this commodity bull market could continue to rock and roll for
some time because “little or no supply has come on line yet.” He points out
that the commodity sector was starting to attract attention pre-2008, as its
bull run began around 1999, but the 2008 financial crisis knocked a lot of
potential new supply offline. Which of course sets the stage for further price
increases...."</u>

------------------------------------------------------------------

Wasn't Michael Bury also bullish on U.S. farmland?

My investment theme for the year ahead is to find companies that have
businesses that are food related; specifically the production, processing and
distribution of food products. This also includes the value added businesses in
the supply chain that own the natural resource (ie land), mine & distribute
fertilizers, have emerging technologies (genetic seed patents) and design and
build efficient precessing and manufacturing equipment (necessary to feed the
masses). I expect the rising demand for food to come from the BRIC countries
especially China and their insatiable desire for protein.

Bunge Limited (BG) should be a good core holding to put in my commodity AG
basket.

These are the companies currently in my AG basket of stocks:

This is my value idea similar to AMNF. AMNF has been working out nicely. I
forgot who first mentioned it but thanks. Also I would like to thank everyone
on this board for all of the interesting and informative posts.

WILC is a simple boring food product business based in Israel. They develop,
import, manufacture, and distribute more than 1000 kosher food products mostly
in Israel.
Cap 101M (I like micro caps b/c it limits competition; Munger likes to says
that if he was just starting out, he would first look at small companies)
EV 50.5M (I like companies with little or no debt)
Cash 53M
Trailing PE 11
Forward PE 9.7 (On their website they have an analyst report which projected
$0.77 earnings for 2011; even cheaper if you subtract out the cash).
58% insider ownership (Interest aligned with shareholders; It would be nice if
they dividend this out like AMNF; they may in the future).
High cash flow business (I like businesses that generate lots of cash).
It's not growing very fast but it's still growing.
There may be some geopolitical risk with an Israel based company but Buffet was
OK with buying Iscar.

I guess you have not heard the story about disenfranchised workers even at
large companies (new college graduates earn way less than their peers starting
10 years ago). or did you read the story about the nuclear plant maintenance
worker making the same salary than workers at a local McDonald. Japanese
companies are not as nurturing to their workers any more than you think.

---
>> Anyway, my view is there's little reason in general for any discrepancy

I started to buy stocks in 1982 through my local bank. the guy behind the
counter was having trouble finding the order form (you had to fill out a form
back then, later you could do it via phone). He said I was the only one for
quite some time buying stocks. So I come to believe that it's not necessarily a
bad time to buy stocks when nobody else is buying it. I do acknowledge that it
could take a long time. Japan had a 20 year bear market - it could become a 25
year bear market , who knows.

I also agree that the economy in the USA is better for the foreseeable future
but that does not necessarily mean that Japanese stocks are worse when
purchased cheap enough. my believe is that it is better buy stocks which have
an international business and hence benefit from economic growth worldwide.
There are quite a bit of small size and mid size companies around that export
their products world wide.

>> Japan stocks as value traps? I maintain my opinion: the ones that are not
multinational like Toyota, Sony, etc -- are value traps. <<

Have you ever heard about Shimano, Keyence, Kurita Water or Shinetsu before?
Those are world wide leaders in their respective business. Sony is a has been.
They are not the leader in consumer electronics or else any more.

AN one more thing, if you compare US companies with Japanese ones: A Japanese
company with flat revenues during the last 5 years in Yen would have shown a
50% increase in revenues in US$. That is s consequence of the "clownbuck"
policy of our US leadership.

The problem with Japanese companies are real and my guess is that they won't
change quickly - but then again valuations are such that they don't have to. it
is quite possible to get better dividend yields in Japan than in the US
currently. the companies profit as measured in ROA is absymal but is is
actually improving. You can look at many Japanese companies website and look at
their profitability back 10 years ago, compared to know. back then their
profits were very small and their balance sheet were bloated with 10-20% equity
only. now the equity is typically ~40% and higher and the profits/share are way
higher than 10 years ago, yet stocks trade a t fraction of the prices back
then. I also see profits bouncing back fairly quickly after this great
recession, much faster than in 2002-2004 timeframe. So I think the Japanese are
cutting costs. My believe is that things are moving in the right direction and
if it continues, the returns are going to be substantial.

RMCF - Looks like a great nice Buffettology investment... at an expensive
price. A high ROE cash cow that pretty much pays out the cash as divvies. No
growth and no pretensions for growth. Earnings (or OCF) yield on EV about 6%.

It might be worth watching, but I am not sure what would make me buy it. If it
starts growing the price would shoot up even more. On the other hand, growth
could be risky since cash cow managers don't necessarily make good growth
decisions. For example, their new yogurt franchise idea might not be as good as
just geo-diversifying the original stores.

It could be taken private or LBO'd although the earnings yield is not greatly
attractive.

I found this on Bronte Capital blog

Glaucus - a small research firm - has had a dig at Gulf Resources&#160;-
another Chinese reverse takeover stock.

I hardly felt it was necessary. &#160;At Bronte we have been short Gulf
Resources (GFRE:Nasdaq) on behalf of our clients for most of the last year.

Its a bromine and industrial salt producer. Bromine is ugly stuff - highly
reactive: in this wikipedia page the bromine is pictured encased in perspex. It
will oxidize almost anything.

I knew it was suspect and you could tell off the balance sheet and the P&L. You
see in the 2009 annual filing on form 10K&#160;Gulf Resources show as having
$650,322 in inventories. They had sales of $110,276,908.

In other words they turned their inventory stock over 169.5 times per year. I
can't imagine how active a plant would need to be to turn over toxic and
dangerous bromine that many times - let alone low value industrial salt.

It didn't seem right to me so we shorted the stock.

But if you are the kind of person that needs a comparable have a look at the
last 10K of Great Lakes Chemical. Great Lakes was a super-high quality operator
(mostly and originally a bromine producer) with Berkshire Hathaway and Warren
Buffett as large shareholders. &#160;This was a mighty fine company as Jeff
Matthews relates:

I recall the CEO of a Great Lakes competitor telling me, with awe, about a
visit to Great Lakes’ bare-bones corporate office, where the lights in the
conference room were operated by&#160;an old-fashioned light timer, like the
timers that control heating lamps in hotel bathrooms.

These guys you see were hard-driving operators - likely to manage inventory
better than almost anyone in the business.

Now we know what arguably the finest bromine maker ever in North America did:
we can look at their last 10K. &#160;In their last year (2004) inventories were
$324 million. Sales were $1604 million.

The company turned its inventory stock under 5 times.

Gulf Resources claim to turn over their inventory 169.5 times per year looks
doubly suspect- and if it is suspect then the accounts are suspect.

I could be wrong of course. Gulf Resources may indeed be able to turn its
inventory over 34 times faster than the best American operator. They may. An
otherwise obscure Chinese company might be that good and the short might be
stupid.

But as a shortseller that is a bet that I was willing to take without any
further due diligence.

I admire the effort in the Glaucus report. But for us - we just keep it simple.

John

PS. There are several high profile asset management firms that hold large
positions in this stock led by Fidelity. As stated you only needed to look at
two pages of the annual filing to smell a rat: the balance sheet and the P&L.
Then the inventory turn jumped out.

Did Fidelity even look at those two pages? Really?

as good US companies. (Kurita Water and Shin-Etsu might be worth another look,
but they are not dirt cheap).

So although we can't say that all Japanese companies are value traps with
shareholder-hostile managements, I wonder if the cheap ones actually are. At
least there's a clear difference in ROE, P/E, P/B of your examples of leading
companies vs. the net-nets discussed before. The leaders may also have better

I answered to someone privately already. But GFRE is really a much different
company than great lakes. great lakes has finished product they can stock on
their shelves, i think they actually contract to purchase their bromine from
someonelse like a gfre. now the bromine is extracted and sent to the purchaser
directly. I am speculating that if they dont have a purchase order they dont
extract the stuff because it is so volatile, so if they have inventory it would
either be for their own use to make into an end product, or their end product,
or there is some shipping/production/timing issue. the real question is whether
the cash and accounts receivable are real. I am not concerned with the
inventory number and while Bronte capital might have profited, It doesn seem
like great analytical work but might be a good starting point to delve deeper
into the situation. but again I have never looked at financial statement that

GFRE answer that the customers pick up their product themselves (this was
regarding shipping cost) is laughable. This would imply that all their
customers are located near GFRE, which does not match with GFRE claim that they
are one of the largest producers of bromine China.

GFRE's bromine is produced by separating the element from low concentration
water well. the claim that it can be produced efficiently "on demand" only is
laughable. Everybody who has has seen chemical plants of considerable size
knows that this stuff needs to be run continuously, preferable 24/7. There has
to be intermediates and storage and hence inventory.

I think the Glaucus research is a pretty damning peace and the auditors and
Fidelity will look very stupid. My bet is that some of those people will have
to look into a career change.

re Japanese -

>>So although we can't say that all Japanese companies are value traps with

Didn't we have a discussion about efficient markets not long ago. The companies
like Shimano or Keyence are known leaders in their field. Everybody who rides a
bike and switches gears every once in a while ought to know Shimano. Keyence is
a leader in small sensors, particular proximity sensors. Tsurumi pumps (not a
field that I am very familiar with but I did do some research) are well known
and compete with industry leaders like Gould (part of ITT). Wholesalers in the
US carry them. it's of course a much smaller business than the one's I
mentioned, only 9000 shares trades this Thursday for example.

But still, I consider it pretty good for a 200M$ (equivalent) market cap
company to have worldwide distribution in a niche market. Their ROE is abysmal
(~4%) but if you strip out the cash and the LT investment (shares in other
Japanese companies), which are not necessary to run the business and contribute
very little to net earnings, then he ROE goes to ~7%, still bad but not abysmal
any more. Same applies to many other companies.

"Their ROE is abysmal (~4%) but if you strip out the cash and the LT investment

That's part of my point. You can't strip these out. As the hedge fund who
bought more than 50% of a Japanese company found out.

The interweaving of suppliers/customers (keiretsu) meant in my day that there
was a Japanese mindset against doing any such thing (to enhance shareholder
value or attractiveness).

You say it's different now or not significant; and you invest. Okay. For me,
the low price-to-value in so many of these Japanese stocks is an affirmation
that perhaps the Japanese mindset that I found, still exits. (Namely we
Japanese want market share and ultimately profits; how our stock price trades,
is of much much lesser concern.)

I think that a value investment is when you have a downside protection. When
you buy so low that the probability for permanent destruction of capital is
close to 0. The probability of GFRE going to 0 is 50% (fraud/not fraud). If it
is not a fraud it is a no-brainer, if it is it goes to 0. So, we are
speculating if it is or it is not, hence a speculation. Just my opinion.

Good luck in your investment/speculation.

I am not saying that Japanese markets are efficient. I am just saying that so
far I have not seen many (or any) incredibly cheap stocks that would not have
warts. Sure you can adjust for cash and LT investments although you have to be
careful, since I agree with Paul that these may be systemic rather than
temporary. Even then 7% ROE is nothing to talk about. OTOH if it's a net-net
then it might be buyable at these low ROEs as a Graham position to be sold on
runup.

Although I chided you about quick sell of your post-quake gains - with tongue
in cheek ;) - IMHO you hit the nail by buying on temporary panic and selling on
recovery. It may be that most of these Japanese companies are
panic-to-some-runup trades rather than long term investments. Although I still
hope to find some that would work long term.

And I appreciate your research and suggestions from Japanese market. :)

I disagree. What you suggest is just a part of value investing spectrum.

probability for permanent destruction of capital ... close to 0 may be true for
Buffettology investments and even there it's not necessarily true. Consider NOK
which I once considered a Buffettology investment or a number of insurance
companies that are favored by Buffett.

There has not been a Graham investment in years that had zero percent
probability of permanent destruction of capital - all Graham investments
recently have been dinky companies that could keel over. Consider GRVY.

IMHO there is a significant part of value investing where you measure
probabilities and you say: 10% of going to zero, 30% of staying here, 60% of
2-5 bagger. It's still investing and not speculation like you imply.

Now, where I agree with you is that assigning the probabilities is very hard
and very inexact job. So I am fine when someone says that they won't invest in
situations where you have to assign the probabilities. OTOH, I made huge gains
in such situations (dinky pref shares in 2008-2009 crash that could have gone
to zero), so I would not dismiss this approach offhand.

Arsenal Energy (AEI.to/AEYIF): Stock continues to fall. I'm adding more in
accumulating a full position.

Company has said net asset value is now (2010) at $1.36. That's down from
$1.47. Company also predicts 3000 boe/d exit rate in 2011; 85% oil. That's down
from 3300, their previous prediction.

With stock now about C$.85/sh (162M sh. out.), it's still a good buy. Imo.

I agree that it is a hypothetical exercise to strip out the cash bu it is still
useful. Cash on the balance sheet is a useful asset, even though it is unlikely
that the management decides to do something short term.

Not all companies are part of Keiretsu's. Somy, for example grow up out of the
keiretsu systems. I do not believe that DMW or Tsurumi Manufacturing are part
of a keiretsu.

We will see how it works out. I have bought value traps before and as long as
things don't get worse, I should be OK. Volatility may open up chances to
trade, opening up another route to profits. And if things change slowly for the
better, there is a very nice potential for long term gains.

In case it helps, I think AAB.TO may have sold off despite strong Jan 31st NAV

Hi reno4 -

Welcome to the Value Investing thread. Hope to hear more of your value
propositions in the coming months.

Re: G. Willi Food-International Ltd. (WILC)

WILC definitely has some value characteristics. I like the cash on the books,
very little debt, a unique (but limited growth) market that sells to the kosher
community (both a positive but could become a negative in a sour economy) and
is selling at 82% BV w/ a 10 forward PE.

It seems like a well managed company but I don't see any extra ordinary value
opportunity except one. That is a play on the $US to Shekel. The company buys
it's inventory in $US but collects Shekel's in it's retail stores. In fact
their 2011 earnings estimated are only positive due to their strong currency
(ie Shekel) which benefited from the weak $US. So, this one positive could also
become a negative if the currency conversion trend changes.

The company trades at a slightly lower PE (around 10) than the market (around
15 for grocery stores). This could be due to being a foreign company where
their products sold are subject to a currency exchange rate risk and they pay
no dividend where other competitors do.

If you assume a slightly higher forward PE of 13, the upward value might be
$10.00/share (13 PE x $0.77/share 2011 earnings) or a 30% potential gain from
the current market price.

IMO, the currency risk alone could hit next years profits if $US gets stronger
(especially when QE2 is completed in June). The company is also exposed to it's
niche kosher market customers which could be a detriment if the local economy
sours (product margins may fall when prices fall).

I just do not think the risk reward is there. This is a thinly traded stock
with low liquidity and could pose a problem exiting the position (25,862 avg
shares trade daily) vs SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU).

Since WILC pays no dividend and growth is constrained to it's niche market,
their strong balance sheet just isn't compelling enough for me to buy into it's
value proposition. I think I would rather speculate in SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU) or
Armanino Foods of Distinction Inc. (AMNF.PK) with lower PE's and both of these
companies pay a dividend (3% & 6% respectively) while you wait.

EKS,

Thanks for your analysis.

WILC
I agree that strenthening of the dollar will be a negative for this company. I
am not sure that even with QE2 ending the dollar will get much stronger.
Although Bernake and Geitner talk about a strong dollar, to me it seem like
they really want a weaker dollar/"clownbucks." WILC has been increasing their
earning in shekels and, with the recent decline in the dollar, their next
quarter earnings should be good. With this company I like the downside
protection of all their cash (PE 5 if you subtract the cash). I am hoping that
they will do something reasonable with thier cash like a dividend, a buyback,
or an acquisition.
AMNF
Like I said before, I too like this company.
SVU
Too complicated for me right now. I'll have to think about it.

TESS. Okay, I'll go for a few shares with a view to track it for a possible
larger buy if stock will fall.

Price somewhat above what I'd like to pay for a stock of an equipment reseller.
Otoh, history of increasing book value (stated bv), relatively low p/e and
relatively low p/sales. Profit margins are thin -- typical for this type
business. A dividend while waiting.

re TESS , valuation looks OK but not great. I compare this to IM (different
market but a similar business model) and it looks somewhat more expensive.

The takeout may be possible but difficult to bet on it. the customer
concentration (28% of the revenues from ATT) is an issue too. I would buy this
below 10$ potentially.

Hi Grommit -

Re: GMXR preferred

First time I have seen the GMXR preferred trade above par. A few trades today
above $25.00/share but on very little volume.

Rumor on the street that ConAgra Foods, Inc. (CAG) is interested in Ralcorp
Holdings Inc. (RAH). Seems like the Food/Commodity play is working.

ConAgra made unsolicited bid for Ralcorp: report
http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/29/us-ralcorp-conagra-idUSTRE73S60P20110
29?feedType=RSS&feedName=innovationNews&rpc=43

From the article:"...Shares of Ralcorp Holdings Inc (RAH.N) jumped on Friday
after CNBC said ConAgra Foods Inc (CAG.N) had made an unsolicited bid for the
private-label food maker and that talks were "no longer ongoing."..."

It looks like there could be more consolidation in this sector especially with
all the cash sitting on the balance sheets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Digital Realty Trust Inc. (DLR) is interesting especially if they meet their
Forward PE expectations of 13.86. That would be one of the lowest PE's for
companies that trade in this sector.

Also, some recent dividend increases which start to make the current yield
attractive at 4.6%. I would like to see something above 5% especially for an
REIT.

Do you think they have pricing power in this market? I like the growth
potential looking out 2 years vs some of my laggard utilities. I have added
this one to my REIT watch list with the idea of selling some of my over
extended utilities (w/ lower dividend yields) and buying into DLR for the
potential growth (and higher yield).

I have been selling utilities also. Was 16% of portfolio on 12/31, now 10%.

DLR - dividend yield is not my main focus here, even though 4.6% isn't bad. the
lower the dividend, the more $ avail for expansion and growth. Pricing power?

Re: RMCF

By coincidence I was in San Francisco yesterday taking my son to the aquarium
on Pier 39, a tourist trap, and happened to walk by a Rocky Mountain candy
store. First I'd ever seen, or noticed anyway. So I went in and ordered a
chocolate covered ice cream popsicle for $5.

The ice cream was okay. Not at all impressed with the store. It had no theme,
no organization, little enough product, and no business. Hard to figure what a
franchisee gets for the franchise cost. So I too will pass on this.

This highlights why I have trouble deciding on SVU. With retail stores or other
sort of business where I can examine the operation I feel much more comfortable
making an investment.

Nice. Nice recovery in BAX stock from lows relating to company's quality

Whereas I believe managements can resolve quality issues, in this particular
instance I lost confidence in BAX management's integrity, and I decided to
avoid the stock.

Reversion-to-mean bets in the pharma sector have worked out well when the
stumbling block has been quality issues. In my limited experience with them
anyway.
