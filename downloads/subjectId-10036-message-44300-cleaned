Jurgis,

CB is the only P&C that's on my watchlist right now, and I was seeing it as
more fitting in a conservative slot in my portfolio for diversification,
dependable results, and nice dividend. P&C is such a tough business that
there's not much else that stands out to me. I actually had a buy order in on
it at one point but didn't get filled... It's always on my watchlist though.
The other thing I'd keep an eye out for is who has some early success in
telematics and begins a successful countrywide rollout - it could be
Progressive coming out from there, but their business model seems more fragile
imho. I'd have an eye on them though.

GEICO is doing very well from what I can tell, but it's all mixed up in
everything else with BRK.

If State Farm were public... but being public would probably ruin them.

I can't speak to the more strictly commercial carriers.

Jurgis,

My investment in MDF is based primarily on 1) superior capital allocators based
on ROE, ROC, ROTC, and returns on marginal equity, and marginal retained
earnings. They're superior on so many measures. 2) technically the stock seems
to run out of sellers whenever the mkt gets overly weak. I've traded the ups
and down some, but it'll often move in ways that are stronger than the market -
at least it seems that way to me. Holders seem reluctant to part with it. 3)
Insiders are large owners and net buyers. I like that. 4) They're in the
process of purchasing CNU which is another company that I liked also and
thought was undervalued.

The negatives to me are the volumes are so low you've got to be careful with
moving even tiny positions. A seller needing to move a large number of shares
quickly can drive price large % (I think this is why you occasionally see it do
the dip-recover thing in short time frames). When buying/selling I typically
just put a buy or sell limit out there and let it sit all day long. My trades
often end up being comprised of lots of small 100 share blocks. An aggressive
buyer can move the P fast and that has resulted in some of my sells in the
past, I just have to be patient when getting back in. My position is small here
anyway. I don't want to deal with the logistics of such a small company where
my buys/sells can move the market. But as a small position it's been a fun one
for me.

That said, I'm not sure I understand the concern over operating cash flow. The
database I have and use shows them as having a long history of net free cash
flow generators. I am going to watch how the merger with CNU impacts the
numbers but I'm relying on mgmt to a degree to know how to keep up the RO*
figures.

at least that's my $0.02 on MDF. I have gaps in my accounting skills and have
to rely on screens (like free cash flow) to protect me from some of those
limitations/shortcomings.

Bank of Hawaii Offers a Safe Port 

The bank has conservative underwriting and risk-management.

Bank of Hawaii (BOH: NYSE)
By Sandler O'Neill + Partners ($38.83, Sep. 9, 2011)

Bank of Hawaii is an exceptional banking institution capable of producing
superior results even in a challenging environment.

It has among the most conservative underwriting and risk-management in the
industry, which helped it manage through the recent recession with few issues.
In fact, even at the depths of the downturn, it still posted high levels of
profitability and actually increased its quarterly dividend, which currently
provides a very attractive 4.6% yield.

In addition, Bank of Hawaii (ticker: BOH) has a solid balance sheet, a talented
management team and it operates in a uniquely-attractive banking market.

Adjusting for a flatter short-end of the yield curve and its impact on
reinvestment rates for Bank of Hawaii, we are trimming our 2011 and 2012
earnings-per-share estimates by one cent and 12 cents, respectively, to $3.20
and $3.25, respectively. Given this change and the sharp decline in overall
bank-stock valuations, we are also lowering our 12-month price target by $5 to
$45 (215% of our 2011 tangible book-value estimate and 14 times our 2012 EPS
estimate). This represents a considerable premium to other regional commercial
banks, justified by the strengths highlighted above.

With the stock having pulled back to below $40, there is now more than 10%
potential upside to even our lowered price target and, as such, we are
upgrading the stock to Buy from Hold.

Bank of Hawaii is a high-quality institution and market leader in its home
state. It has the most branches and ATMs as well as the highest name
recognition. It is second in deposit market share, just behind leader First
Hawaiian Bank, which is owned by BNP Paribas [of Paris]. While not of great
value today, the state has historically had a much lower cost of deposits than
the mainland U.S., and eventually that will again be a benefit to local banks.

The company has an attractive balance sheet with good diversification in its
$5.35 billion loan portfolio with approximately 60% in consumer (mostly
residential mortgages) and 40% in commercial. The commercial segment is also
well diversified with commercial-real-estate loans composing 42%; commercial
and industrial (C&I) loans, 39%; lease financing, 15%; and just a small amount
of construction.

Meanwhile, the $9.98 billion deposit base is almost entirely core accounts,
with noninterest-bearing deposits composing 25% of the total and CDs
representing just 10% of the total.

Even in the depths of the recession, Bank of Hawaii remained profitable,
posting returns on equity (ROEs) in the mid-to-high teens. And, historically,
it has recorded ROEs well in excess of 20%, putting it in the top-tier of all
banks.

Bank of Hawaii manages its capital levels well, returning excess capital to
shareholders by way of dividends and share repurchases. Its current quarterly
dividend of 45 cents per share represents a 4.6% yield, and over the past year,
the company has repurchased nearly 1.7 million shares. Furthermore, the board
of directors recently increased the authorization under the share-repurchase
program by an additional $120 million and, as of July 22, the company had
approximately $126 million remaining under the authorization (6.7% of
outstanding shares at the current price). Meanwhile, despite returning a
healthy amount of capital to shareholders it has increased tangible book value
to $20.58 and the tangible common equity (TCE) ratio to 7.4% (the Tier 1 ratio
is 18.0% and the total risk-based capital ratio is 19.2%).

The Hawaiian economy is outperforming the mainland U.S. with an unemployment
rate of 6.1%, which is well below the national level of 9.1%. Even after the
tragedy in Japan, tourism remains strong, with solid visitor arrivals and
increased visitor spending. Historically, much of Hawaii's tourism has relied
on visitors from the U.S. mainland and Japan, but Canada, Australia & China are
increasing their contributions (arrivals up 13%, 24% and 21%, respectively,
yr-over-yr in July), and China could become a very big source of visitors as
the number of available flights increases.

Thanks for the BOH report. Fwiw, in addition to BOH, I hold shares in the

WFC. A few shares to track. Following Warren Buffett with a buy.

BNPQY.pk. I am led to believe its Greek/Italian debt exposure is relatively

Off-balance sheet exposure though is a concern. Perhaps a big concern. This is

Thanks for your thoughts. I wanted to probe just one thing a bit more. If "P&C
is such a tough business" as you say, how come tons of companies show
annualized 10-13% book value (and book value per share) growth for 10 years+?
This is a good result, isn't it? So what is a good explanation for these
results? Is it just "very good" 10 years, i.e. luck/helpful winds, etc?
Something else?

Or am I looking too much outside of what you consider P&C business when I make
this observation? But even then, why did the expanded universe of P&C +
specialty (actually CB is in that expanded universe) + re, would do so well?

Any thoughts or comments welcome.

Shane,

Looking at Yahoo numbers, MDFs OCF was significantly lower than earnings in
2008 and 2010 http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cf?s=MDF+Cash+Flow&annual .
Looking at their latest 10Q:
http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=8072252-883
183668&type=sect&dcn=0001157523-11-004574 it seems that the same thing is
happening in 2011. In fact, after the capex and "physician practices acquired"
they produced almost no FCF in h1/2011. Apparently, in 2010 they got a big
boost to OCF/FCF in second half, so it's possible this is just periodic
fluctuations, but they make me concerned.

I think the fluctuations can be explained by understanding their cash transfers
to/from Humana. I am just not sure if MDF is playing games with this or Humana
is and whether the games are completely innocent. It's also possible that the
cash effect is due to some government paperwork/timing. Still, it would be nice
to know how come the earnings/OCF differs so much even over extended periods.

Personally I am not interested enough to dig further. Good luck with it.

What Mr. Gogo said.

I think you can make a pretty good synthetic S&P500 2x yourself without using
the SSO/UPRO if you think about it.

There are couple problems:
- Assuming S&P returns 0%, any levered fund will return less due to the
leverage costs.
- If you play around with scenarios - yeah, do it, it's enlightening - there
are more scenarios where 2x loses more than 1x
- Part of the issue is that with leverage you have unrecoverable permanent
losses. I.e. if you're just levered, you pay the interest on the loan, you may
have to sell part at the bottom due to margin calls (if you hold cash to cover
margin calls, then that cash should be counted as part of your portfolio and
your return is automatically lower). If you're levered through options, there's
slippage, time decay, imperfect rollover, and so on.

You might be able to do a bit better than S&P by levering up when it's "cheap"
and unlevering when it's "expensive". But not sure how much that would add.
Depends on how good you'd be at timing. ;)

I believe the 3x funds are only short term (e.g. a day) well-correlated to the
indexes they track. Expenses are high and the correlation does not hold up even
in the season-to-season time-frame.

I do recall a study saying the best long-term investment approach was to be
about 115% invested (meaning 15% into margin), but that always made me wonder.
It would depend on the rate. Margin rates are so high relatively for your
average investor. If the rate were low and you loaded up on dividend paying
stocks it might make sense. I believe some closed end funds issue a slight
amount of preferred shares that pay a fairly low coupon so as to get a little
leverage. If I could borrow 20% of my portfolio value at 3%, I'd be tempted to
do so. But I can't, so I sit tight.

If you want to be aggressive, go 100% stocks, and load up on micro-cap value
stocks. That's probably a 2 beta, so you'd do well so long as stocks did not go
into a Japanese style long term doldrums.

re 2x or 3X levered index vehicles - it's not just the expenses that are
killing these levered vehicles LT - it is the volatility that is doing it. By
design these vehicles are buyers if stocks when stocks go up and sellers when
stocks go down. They need to do this daily rebalancing to keep their leverage
ratio on target. Now imaging you do this with your portfolio in a month like
August 2011 - you will absolutely get killed in a zig-zag market.

Personally, I would just margin the SPY 50% if I really feel compelled to add
juice to my bet, or in a IRA (where you don't have margin) add some options.
But who need juice after all, if the market can move 3%+ from day to day?

Thank you all for the responses. You're all right... Expenses, volatility,
daily compounding all make these leveraged vehicles less appealing. I guess
what I'm really trying to do is juice up my bet over the long term i.e. my
lifetime without having to micromanage my portfolio. Historically, picking a
thirty year period of the CAGR of the S&P500 gets me fired up
(http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm)... as long as I ignore the
possibility of "japanese style long term doldrums". I guess I was just looking
for a easy way to "2x" those returns. In my ignorance (or naivete) I'd never
really considered using margin. I just have an aversion to margin which comes
from sweeping judgements about the dangers from the likes of the Oracle of
Omaha.

Here's a great case against leveraged ETFs for those interested:

"Margin rates are so high relatively for your average investor"

Not sure what "average" investor means in terms of number of trades made per
year or portfolio size ($).

I find margin rates to be very low both absolutely and relatively.

Just as a reference, I checked broker call rates on the internet. I see 2% (I'm
assuming that's now the correct current number).

Earlier this year, I got advert flyers from Muriel Siebert advertising their
margin rates. Going to their website now, they now say:

Debit balance: $15-20K: margin rate is 1.25% above broker call rate, i.e.
that'd be 3.25%
Debit balance: $20-25K: margin rate is 1% above broker call rate, i.e. 3%
Debit balance: >$25k: margin rate is .75% above broker call rate, i.e 2.75%

I believe though that an active trader with a larger debit balance could get
margin rates even lower than 3%. And at every discount brokerage firm.

My point though is that if you have $100K or so in a taxable account and are
serious about "borrowing 20% of my portfolio at 3%", there are brokerage firms
out there that will meet your requirement of margin rate no higher than 3%.

(Aside: Of course margin rates fluctuate with fluctuations in call rates and
with particular stocks held (i.e. some stocks aren't marginable or become less
marginable). However at this time, with the Fed saying interest rates will be
held down through 2012, I would expect broker call rate to remain about at
current level too.)

Jurgis, on P&C - I could be tainted some by the tough conditions at my company
over the past 5yrs or so, but what I see:

- largely commoditized product (my opinion I guess)
- slow growing market - fighting over fixed pie.
- many state regulators, at least in states I deal with, are difficult
- catastrophe exposure / risk of ruin (more trouble in property than in auto)
- some major players are mutual companies and are willing and able to run
certain lines at loss for extended periods, or at least aren't under pressure
to have profits (but just break even).

Your question about book value is interesting. I just scanned through several
co's in my database and some bvps are up, some bvps are down over the past 7yrs
of history I see - I can't tell overall what's going on there or paint the
industry broadly. Clearly some have done better than others. I found it
interesting that even w/ my co book value is higher now than it was 7yrs ago,
but I feel we're in a diminished position vs. 7yrs ago (and stock price
reflects that despite book value change). At least in my co's case I wouldn't
say the book value increase is equivalent to a healthier company.

Perhaps I'm not being fair when I call it a tough business - like most
industries there are winners there - there's just a lot to be concerned with as
I look at the landscape. Maybe I'm too close to it to appreciate the positives.
As I looked through there were a couple of players I was curious about, but I
don't have a consistent approach to evaluate them - maybe I should do that.
(part of the problem I have with looking at financials on insurance cos is the
operational metrics like production, retention, policy growth, avg premiums,
combined ratio, frequency, severity that explain the business well - don't
necessarily tie into the GAAP financials reported very well requiring alot of
manual digging around)

If I had to look at a few, after glancing through the database, in addition to
CB I think I'd look at Travelers, Fairfax and Zurich, but I could probably
refine a more interesting list if I sat down and thought about how to build a
good P&C insurance industry screen/filter. Financial companies have always been
difficult for me to do this and I've tended to stay away because things can
look OK and even good on the financials up until the point something goes very
wrong and it can go downhill fast - like the surprises that hit so many co
investment portfolios in 2008. But there were some companies that sailed
through 2008 almost like nothing happened.

RE: BOLT -FWIW- SA thinks it's
undervalued-http://seekingalpha.com/article/292889-bolt-undervalued-energy-serv
ces-play?source=yahoo

We recommend buying shares of Bolt Technology (
http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/bolt ) (herein, “BOLT” or the “Company”) at its
current price of $12.00/share with upside of $20.00/share within the next 12
months.

BOLT is the market leader in the manufacture of seismic equipment and control
systems used for offshore oil and gas exploration. Offshore energy and
petroleum (“E&P”) companies use seismic analysis of the ocean floor to locate
oil and gas deposits worthy of exploration. International customers comprise
78% of BOLT’s revenues, which make BOLT less dependent on the sensitivity of
U.S. E&P spending, which is particularly attractive given the uncertainty
surrounding the current lift of the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium. We
believe BOLT will see significant growth in the near future because of

<ol><li>a high level of offshore seismic activity around the world, given the
strong drivers for offshore E&P activity</li><li>geopolitical instability in
energy focused countries; and</li><li>energy demands from China, India, and
other developing countries. </li></ol>Business overview

BOLT’s business is levered to: 1) price of oil and gas; and 2) oil/gas capital
expenditure spending.

Our view is that crude oil and natural gas will sustain at $90+ per barrel and
$4/mcf, respectively, through 2012. More importantly, E&P companies have little
choice but to increase exploration activity due to depleting global reserves
and geopolitical instability, necessitating a diversification of energy
sources. BOLT will benefit directly as increased seismic analysis is necessary.
Also, there are only 150 seismic vessels around the globe and BOLT’s seismic
solutions are used in 80% of them.

Customers

Yr. ended June 30, (in mill.) Customer Country 2010 (%) 2009 (%) 2008 (%)
Norway $7.1 22% $13.6 28% $21.2 34% United States $6.8 22% $7.4 15% $12.1 20%

10% $5.9 12% $8.5 14% TOTAL $31.5 100% $48.9 100% $61.5 100% As can be seen
above, U.S. customers make up 20% of BOLT’s business, which is a quite
attractive diversification given that 80% of its business is levered to global
E&P companies and suppliers. BOLT’s customer base is diversified, yet without
significant volatility of revenue streams. Furthermore, its average customer
relationship is 8 years.

Opportunity

BOLT is operated as a private company. Management does not participate in any
road shows, set up public conference calls, and has no dedicated or acting
investor relations department. Quarterly earnings are typically conveyed via
press release. Management focuses on the profitability of the Company, the day
to day management, and is extremely disciplined with the use of its cash.
Management runs the company in a very lean way with only 123 employees. BOLT
has grown through acquisitions, and has never taken any asset impairment
write-downs. BOLT has no debt, and operating cash flow ($9 million normalized)
finances capital expenditures and operating expenses. Because there are no
analysts covering the company and BOLT’s dominance is in a niche industry, the
shareholder base is primarily index-hugging mutual funds, quantitative funds,
and some value-style investors. The Company’s low trading volume (25,500 shares
traded per day) also puts BOLT under the radar of other speculators and
traders. As a result, BOLT represents a great business at a good valuation.
Furthermore, we believe that if management is more active in putting itself in
front of institutional investors, its trading volume and market exposure will
be beneficial for share price appreciation.

Background

On January 6, 2011, BOLT announced a $10 million acquisition of Seabotix, a
manufacturer of remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV). BOLT generated
$8.6 million in revenue in 2010 and 2/3 of its revenues come from the U.S. and
foreign military. From 2005 to 2009 BOLT grew 232% in revenue with 48% gross
margins. Seabotix was ranked 342 out of 500 fastest growing companies by
Deloitte. Synergies of the acquisition are diversity of revenue stream (i.e.,
military/government) and the tie-in of Seabotix to BOLT’s energy customers,
specifically for marine surveillance of the seabed and BOLT underwater cables.
Our view is that this acquisition will be accretive because management has a
track record of acquiring private companies with 47-50% gross margins and
25-30% operating margins. BOLT’s management has steered the company to
profitability every year since 2004, including 2008 and 2009, during a severe
U.S. recession and energy spending falls. Management’s focus on high EBITDA
margins (24%) and the Company’s dominant niche in the seismic industry are key
drivers for this accomplishment, which we expect to continue as Seabotix will
experience significant ramp-up in 2012.

Market Opportunity

Energy exploration and production are capital intensive activities, with high
cost of equipment and high cost for skilled labor. The mining, oil, & gas
manufacturing sector generated $19.6B in 2011 and expected to grow 4.9% for the
next five years. The Exploration and Production market is enormous. Barclays’s
Capital estimated that 2011 E&P spending will be $529B, an increase of 16% over
the $458B in 2010. Anadarko ( http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/apc ) alone is
budgeting to spend $1.3B-$1.5BN towards exploration activities in 2011.

Value Proposition

BOLT’s technology provides high value. Exploration costs are a relatively small
part of the total cost of getting gasoline to the pumps. Exploration is now
approximately $3/barrel of oil (excluding production costs), which is up from
the $1.18/barrel cost a decade ago due to the challenges of finding oil today
in remote and extreme geographic areas. However, exploration costs are only
about 3% of the price of the $100 barrel of oil today, compared to 5.1% in
2001. Even if the price of a barrel of oil falls by 25% to $75, exploration
costs would only be 4%.

Valuation

BOLT trades at 1.8x EV/Revenue and 7.8x EV/EBITDA, with $3.50/share in cash and
no debt, as of 8/9/2011. Last twelve months (LTM) revenues ended March 31, 2011
were $38 million, EBITDA of $8.6 million and net income of $5.8 million. With
the Seabotix acquisition, my view is that full-year 2011 revenues, EBITDA, and
net income will respectively reach $45m, $11m, and $8m. 2012 revenues, EBITDA,
and net income are projected to reach $55m, $14m, and $10m, respectively. 2012
numbers are most appropriate due to the January 2011 acquisition of Seabotix
and time needed for management to integrate the company. At 10x EBITDA
multiple, BOLT’s EV is $170, or $19.70 per share (140 EV + 30 cash=170; 170/8.6
shares = $19.70). On a P/E multiple, peers trade between 20 – 50x P/E.
Comparables are seismic units within bigger companies such as ION Geophysical (

International ( http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/oii ). BOLT’s 2012 net income of
$10m or $1.16/share at a P/E of 20 represents a share price of $23.20. Although
BOLT is a specialized seismic player, my view is that a P/E of 20 is a very
conservative measure given its industry dominance and the oil producers urgency
in diversifying their E&P activities for crude production.

BOLT Comparables

Compared to peers, BOLT’s valuation is in line and capitalization is better
than peers. Median EV/EBITDA and net cash per share are 7.6x and -4%. BOLT is
trading at 7.4x and 31% net cash per share. Although companies such as
Schlumberger (SLB), OII, and IO produce a wider suite of E&P offerings, we
believe BOLT’s niche position, solid balance sheet, and Seabotix accretion is
undervalued by the market.If management can find a way to get itself in front
of more investors via conference calls, more press releases, and by attending
energy conferences, trading volumes can easily rise up to to 3-4x from the
current 24,000 per day average volume.

Shane,

Though I am an industry outsider, I agree with a lot of your points:

- largely commoditized product - yes. Every company claims they have special
brand/relationship/niche but overall it is a commodity.
- slow growing market - fighting over fixed pie. - yes
- many state regulators, at least in states I deal with, are difficult - I
don't have insight on this. Some of my investments are reinsurers, so maybe
this applies less to them.
- catastrophe exposure / risk of ruin (more trouble in property than in auto) -
yes. Potentially this is a bigger issue for reinsurers. Question though: do you
think that insurers don't reinsure enough?
- some major players are mutual companies and are willing and able to run
certain lines at loss for extended periods, or at least aren't under pressure
to have profits (but just break even). - I don't have insight on this. Less of
an issue in reinsurers?

Perhaps you are right that the book value increase is not enough to say that
the company is healthy/doing great. Obviously if policy pricing sucks while we
get couple more cat years like this one, the book values of a bunch of P&C
insurers and reinsurers will suffer. And then even 10-year 10%+ average
annualized growth can disappear really fast with yearly losses.

You are also right, that deep analysis is very hard. I am guilty of the fact
that I mostly look at p/book + longer term book value growth + some reputation
analysis and go with that. Perhaps it is too risky approach. Like I said in
other posts, there are issues not captured in my analysis:
- Is this year a "new normal" on cat frequency?
- Will cos suffer from the superlow interest rates on fixed income? (And were
the past earnings inflated by the treasury runup while yields dropped?)
- Will cos invest into risky paper to bump up low yields and then collapse as
that paper defaults?

From our discussion, I am inclined to keep/add to my Fairfax position, although
I don't agree with deflationary thesis Prem Watsa is pursuing. I may buy some
CB. I did not like the very slow book-value-per-share growth at TRV, so I
skipped it. I have not looked at Zurich yet.

Portfolio Management & Portfolio Turnover Rate?

Is your portfolio turnover rate still holding around 18 months? As the market
drops and new bargains begin to appear, are you noticing an increase in your
the portfolio turnover rate?

I have been working on moving my average cost for all of my lots lower
especially with the recent volatility. I have also been moving money into new
value opportunities which have resulted in the portfolio to turnover a bit more
than usual. I suspect my turnover rate has decreased from 36-48 months down to
18 months. I have been booking a lot of the gains from the 2008-2009 lows and
working this money into new value buys.

I am also more apt to book more of my shorter term gains (but not fully valued
IMO) because I will find better value bargains to put the monies into.

Finally, when I review my different buy lots, I have more of them especially
for the companies I like long term. My average has moved from about four
different buy lots to six. I am finding that my new buys are smaller in size
but I am making a few more over the same period of time. On rallies I have been
selling my higher priced shares too, reducing my average position cost.

Have you seen any changes in the way you manage your portfolio during 2011?

EKS, yes, I'm finding somewhat similar to you.

I have large capital losses yet to carry forward. That makes me quicker to take
short term gains for the offset. And it makes me less willing to take long-term
gains from '08-'09 buys. Because IF those gains hold up (i.e. the particular
stocks don't decline), the gains will be taxed at low rates if I sell after I
use up my loss carry-forwards. Assuming I am ever able to get enough gains to
use up those carry-forwards. And that the state/fed governments don't increase
my tax rates.

I find I am trading more. Both trading around some positions I hold, and also
just in-and-out on a few stocks. Coupled with being somewhat quicker to take
smaller gains, and quicker --- but not quick enough --- to take some losses,
that means my portfolios turnover rates have increased. I'd guess closer to
what you might be experiencing -- 18 months, maybe less.

I too am making more separate buys of each stock as I establish a position.
More buys for a stock, but each of these buy orders is smaller in size -- much
smaller than buys I would've otherwise made in 2010 or up through mid 2011. Or
in '06-'07. It may be one thing to "be greedy when others are fearful"; it's
something else to be be greedy when you yourself are in the 'fearful' camp and
the market is falling around you. So buys, but smaller buys.

In general I'm not trading out of losing stocks that seem to me to be value
stocks in order to just replace them with stocks that seems to be better
values. I've found that doing that doesn't work well for me. Sometimes value is
realized at different times, so for me, I'd just as soon keep what looks like a
value stock, than to sell it and to try something that I might be more
enthusiastic about. My preference is just add the new stock to my portfolio.
And right now I still have some cash I've built up, so I can do this. That all
said though, I've a few stocks in my taxable account that show large short-term
losses (as much or more than a 50% loss), so I'm guessing it could be a long
time before they might recover. So I have reduced positions in my high cost
shares in some of these (keeping the lower cost shares), with a view to maybe
adding back in 31 days, or using the proceeds elsewhere.

Your post is an education to me. Per my broker TD Ameritrade, they say that for
an account sized 100,000 to 250,000, the margin rate is 7.25%. So what I had
not appreciated before was how much TD Ameritrade overcharges for margin if
other brokers are charging more like 3%.

I have never used much margin, usually using it for a trading position only.
Now most of my money is in tax-sheltered accounts, so I cannot use margin there
anyway, and I am somewhat gun-shy to take on margin anyway in today's market,
especially when rates can go up on short notice.

But if I do get a few bucks ahead and decide to take a significant and lasting
margin position in a taxable account, I guess it will have to be with a broker
other than TD Ameritrade. What a rip. Give you like .01%, but charge you 7.25%.

Hi Geoffrey -

Re: Margin Rates

Here is a link of several brokers and their margin rates (look at bottom item
in Fee Section).
http://online-stock-trading-review.toptenreviews.com/

You can see that margin rates are all over the board. I have Schwab and their
margin rates are equivalent to TD Ameritrade. So, if you are one that uses
margin in managing the portfolio, it's best to shop around for a competitive
brokerage account.

FWIW, Schwab Bank has a very competitive Home Equity line of credit rate.
http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/home_equity

They gave me a special rate of 2.99% when I set it up a few years back. I have
this set up for emergencies and bridge financing that I use for buying

I wonder why you consider PGR business model as fragile - it's the same as
Geico's - directly sold cheap car insurance. The problem with both Geico and
PGR insurance business is that they don't offer a package,of
car/property/umbrella insurance that other insurance companies do. With the
discounts, the bundle is often cheaper than obtaining the coverage with direct
insurers and much less hassle, imo.

I wonder why WEB has not bought a property insurance company yet, or let Geico
offer property insurance. They do broker property insurance but that is not a
coherent product for the customer.

What makes the property insurance tough is the shrinking pie due to lower RE
prices and many houses in foreclosure which may not be insured for a while.

Re: Gastar Exploration Ltd New Ordi (AMEX: GST )

With many of the smaller E&P companies testing their lows, this one continues
to hold it's value. The true value of their reserves should be confirmed over
the next 12 months. All the drilling costs are pretty much all financed by
their JV partner based on their 9/22/2010 agreement..

McNicoll Lewis & Vlak Starts Gastar Exploration Limited (GST) at Buy; Marshall
& Wetzel Catalysts - Price Target is $6.00/share
http://www.streetinsider.com/New+Coverage/McNicoll+Lewis+%26+Vlak+Starts+Gastar
Exploration+Limited+%28GST%29+at+Buy%3B+Marshall+%26+Wetzel+Catalysts/6781471.h
ml
From the article:"...MLV analyst says, "Gastar is highly levered to the
Marcellus Shale play, and
its initial Marcellus wells had superb results. These two wells are located
within its 6,700 net acre position in Marshall & Wetzel counties in West
Virginia. The wells exhibited a surprisingly high condensate component now
producing at a combined 720 b/d. The IP gas component was a strong combined
15.5 mmcf/d. Geologically, the Company believes results in this area should be
consistent. Gastar has about 75 additional identified locations on this small
acreage position in the liquids rich regime." ..."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------

The company is still highly leveraged but analysts expect the stock to deliver
40% upside in the next one year with a buy rating of 80%. <u>The stock is
trading at 12 times its estimated 2012 earnings. </u>

The value proposition is that they deliver on their drilling 2011 & 2012
program in the JV deal made with Atinum Partners Co., (a leading investment
firm located in the Republic of Korea) announced 9/22/2010. The nice aspect of
this deal is their JV partner will carry them on all of their drilling costs
(over $40M) for a 50% interest in the 34,200 net acres of their Marcellus Shale
rights ( I believe that reflects 44% of their total acreage).

<u>The essence of their deal:</u>
http://www.gastar.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=509884
"...Pursuant to the agreement, Gastar will assign an initial 21.43% interest to
Atinum in all of its existing Marcellus Shale assets in West Virginia and
Pennsylvania, approximately 34,200 net acres, and certain producing shallow
conventional wells in a transaction valued at approximately $70 million.

Under the terms of the transaction, Atinum will pay Gastar $30 million in cash
upon closing and an additional $40 million in the form of a drilling carry.
Upon the completion of the funding of the drilling carry, Atinum will own a 50%
interest in the 34,200 net acres of Marcellus Shale rights currently owned by
Gastar. Gastar will continue to serve as operator of all of the Marcellus Shale
interests in the JV. The transaction is expected to close within 30 to 45 days
and is contingent upon the receipt of certain required approvals from
government agencies in the Republic of Korea and other customary closing
conditions.

<u>The terms of the drilling carry call for Atinum to fund its ultimate 50%
share of drilling, completion and infrastructure costs along with 75% of
Gastar's ultimate 50% share of those same costs until the $40 million carry has
been satisfied. Gastar and Atinum are pursuing an initial three-year
development program that calls for the partners to drill one horizontal
Marcellus Shale well during the remainder of 2010 and a minimum of 12
horizontal wells in 2011 and 24 horizontal wells in each of 2012 and
2013....".</u>

You realize that they bought back tons of stock while keeping the tangible
equity the same. Since 2006 TRV reduced their outstanding shares from ~680M to
~420M now and equity is around 25B$. So book value has grown substantially per
shares.

I like what they are doing - they realized the overall market is stagnant (soft
market since 2007) and rather than hunt for market share, they are just buying
back shares, keeping their equity roughly constant. not a bad capital
allocation strategy, imo.

I think there is a chance that TRV ends up on BRK shopping list. They already

This also enhanced their book value but you could argue that it is misleading
in terms of value creation, since they basically got rid a business with a high
return on equity (Lorillard) while retaining those with a much lower return on
assets (CNA etc.), hence the increase in book value for L stock is not

 catastrophe exposure / risk of ruin (more trouble in property than in auto) -
yes. Potentially this is a bigger issue for reinsurers. Question though: do you
think that insurers don't reinsure enough?

Actually I think reinsurers are in a better position to control risk of ruin
than insurers. Most reinsurance deals that I've seen place limitations on how
much the reinsurer will pay - but there's no way for an insurer to put a
maximum cap on losses. For example: Reinsurance deals I've seen might be where
reinsurance kicks in for a single hurricane after the first 2 Billion in
losses, and the reinsurer might cover losses from 2B to 5B, but then the
reinsurance is used up, and the initial company is back on the risk for any and
all loss beyond $5B. There is no way to reinsure your way out of risk of ruin.
So I guess in many ways being a reinsurer is "preferred" in my mind in the
property area as maximum losses are known.

I think insurers utilize reinsurance where they can - but the extraction costs
are high. When you need reinsurance (often after a significant capital draining
event) reinsurance rates often shoot through the roof. Reinsurance might not be
the best way to approach some of the risk management issues out there - I've
heard of CAT Bonds being floated as alternatives but don't know how that is
going.

- Is this year a "new normal" on cat frequency?
- Will cos suffer from the superlow interest rates on fixed income? (And were
the past earnings inflated by the treasury runup while yields dropped?)
- Will cos invest into risky paper to bump up low yields and then collapse as
that paper defaults?

Every year it seems like new catastrophe models come out calling for increased
"normal" cat loads. The degree to which this is company driven (i.e. do the
companies select CAT models that call for ever increasing CAT indications I
don't know - but I think probably it occurs. I doubt most CAT models are
scientifically unbiased - but are shaped by what the desired outcome of the
industry - just my guess though).

Yes - in low rate environments companies have to take rates to achieve desired
ROI. All the bad debt on balance sheets has hurt earnings for alot of cos. I
can't gauge if we're truly past the write-offs or if it's all "pretending" that
the investment debt is better now.

I'm not sure about taking on risky investments - my feel for it at my co is
they got burned so bad with the bad mortgage and commercial paper that they
were happy to climb out of that hole still in tact and don't have a flavor for
more risk at all. But yes - in the past I think games were likely played to
spike earnings on the investment side. The degree to which they understood what
they were doing - not sure.

This is an area where CB impressed me - look at what happened with them in
2008-2009 vs. many other carriers. Also look at CB in major hurricane years..
Very impressive to me how they weathered things when other cos. were literally
on the edge.

Clownbuck,

my perception is Geico attracts a more valuable type of customer. retains
better - not as likely to shop. I can't recall where, but when retention levels
between the companies is compared Geico's retentions have tended to be
considerably higher than Progressive as I recall.

by "more fragile" - PGR seems to have to pedal harder (replace the churn) in
their book to keep up. Based on AM Best data that I've seen Geico seems to be
gaining share at a better pace right now also.

All of the direct companies appeal to shoppers which tend to remain shoppers -
so retention will always be a big concern there I think.

As it's been explained to me, Property business is undesirable for reserve
requirement reasons at present. States require you to keep large reserves in
place to cover property exposure written. At present it's very difficult to
achieve decent rate of return on those reserves. Having property on the book
often just pulls down overall returns. It seems to me PGR and Geico have been
able to grow because they don't have property. Most multiline carriers can't
achieve adequate rates on property so have to subsidize property with auto.
This creates ability for auto only carriers like PGR and Geico to cherry pick
the books of multiline carriers without having to carry the property reserves.
(PGR and Geico will hook you up with a 3rd party brokered property carrier in
many places though). If I recall Geico tried a test writing property in a
(western state?) market and quickly shut it down after bad results. It's just
tough to make property make sense right now. I'd guess it's even tougher for a
company like Geico who'd be trying to do property online. I'd say they'd want
to be extremely tight on risk mgmt and approach it very slowly/carefully with
low volume. I think money can be made, but be very careful about selection.

re insurers.
PGR insurance life has increased over the last few years (they state that in
their last 10Q), so I am guessing that they are closing the gap to Geico.

I went ahead and had my insurance needs quoted online.

1) While PGR does not do property (homeowners) they have that integrated in
their quoting process so it's not visible at all (like it is with Geico) that
you are dealing with a separate company. They state in their 10Q that they work
with 3 different insurance providers.
2) The online quote process was smooth and very well thought out. Many fields
were already pre-populated (they know our cars for example and the size of our
house after i provided an address
3) They were not able to beat the price of my current insurance, which is with
MCY. ( Amica and Geico cannot beat the price of MCY package deal either)

PGR acquisition cost appears to be much lower than for other insurers. I also
think they are doing a good ob with their advertising campaign. I see
online/mobile online presence and capability to serve the customer as a
customer major differentiation point and PGR seems to excel there. At 1.8
tangible book and 12x earnings PGR is not cheap but my guess is that their
stock may beat most peer stock over the years.

I would gladly buy some at 15$.

As for CB, I agree they are well managed. I think there was some luck involved,
since they are concentrated in high value housing Katrina was not that much of
a factor but Irene could have been, if it had been stronger. Their bond
portfolio has performed well during 2008 but so has TRV's.

My issue with the property insurers is that the fat lady has not sung yet. I
believe the song that the fat lady will sing is "No more reserve releases from
the fhard market years 2003-2007. For example TRV had over 1B$+ in annual
reserve releases - that is more than 1/3 of their nominal earnings. Others are
probably in a similar boat that they releases reserves in a controlled manor to
boost earnings. However that can only go on for so long. So far the day has not
come yet when the reserve releases are no longer justified but it ought to be
close.

OK, I looked at my calculations on TRV. I actually calculated the growth from
2004 when the big jump in equity happened. So you are correct that they have
grown book value per share 10% annually. This was all due to the share buybacks
that reduced shares by 30% since 2004. Although book value growth is distorted
by share buybacks, the book value per share growth is much less so. So we can
use 10% annual growth. This is average and not outstanding. TRV results this
year are also average. Their buyback is actually the biggest of all companies I
have looked at, so that's impressive.

I still probably won't invest in it.

re L Loews - while I like their value conscious approach, I believe that most
of their business management and results are below average:

CNA: perennial underperformer, although they have picked up a bit in the last
few years, still below average ROA
Pipelines: ~750M$ in cost overruns forced the GP to buy secondaries at above
market, below average distribution growth and that is why BWP currently yields
8.4%. Now after years of emphasizing fee only business (regulated pipes) they
want to go to the wellhead (gathering and processing business which is more
volatile)

Highmount E&P: really really bad timing for acquisition, unforced error in WEB
lingo - right now HM earns 100M$/year and the acquisition price was 4B$ (plus
assumption of debt).

DO: rigs look rather old.They have a good strategy to refurbish old rigs in
slow times and modernize them but is that enough against some new high spec
competitors from Norway etc?

I think they have a sound approach with a hard asset bias, which is good but I
think they need to spiff up their management. At a high enough discount to
book, I'd take another look, but right now L stock looks like it's only a so so
(meh in new lingo) value.

They began this position about 5-6 years ago.

We lost Progressive as we told them they had to pay what State Farm paid.

They left and went to another shop.

After having us re repair several bad jobs - they begridgingly came back.

State Farm can only be called a straight up insurance company.They have evry

require the best of tools to be used to confirm an additional add statement for
damage that can not be seen in a very hard hit.

"Their people in vhicles is expensive vs the internet."

I believe Progressive went to vehicles because they found that if they could
respond quickly -- like arriving at the scene of the accident and showing
legitimate concern -- people in the accident would settle claims more quickly
and more inexpensively than if they (the people) had a few days to consider the
situation and maybe get legal advice or legal representation. If so, it may be
that Progressive finds agents with vehicles are ultimately less expensive than
the internet. I don't know.

If I had to choose one, ROST looks interesting. I know Madharry shops their for
his bargain shorts (as do I). I find that they have very good discounts through
out the year. In fact, I have fitted many a bathroom with new bath towels and
other related bathroom supplies from Ross shelves.

My one concern with the results from their screen is the PE's all seem high
when compared to the current S&P PE average. I did not check forward PE's which
could be lower. I do not pay too much attention to forward PE's from analysts
at this point in the cycle because I feel they have not factored a slowing
economy and/or double dip.

I have tightened up my value criteria and want companies with PE's around 10, a
dividend near 4% and their LT debt when compared to annual net income to be no
more than 4x. I will probably miss a lot of potential Graham/Buffet value Buys
but I want to error on conserving my capital rather than missing the possible

This stock got clocked after the dividend cut and looks like a buy here.

Jurgis, do you think there is much risk the royalty income goes away or do you
think it is more likely than not to continue on indefinitely or at worst
decline gradually?

I am inclined to buy some more (own a stub position), but not back up the
truck. The negative net worth makes me somewhat antsy and the stock trades like
my typical roach motel stocks (you can check in but in a bad market you can't
check out). That being said, the earnings, dividend, and cash flows look

product that uses Unilens patent.

Hedge fund guy (Vadim Perelman, Baker Street Capital) bought up 26% of shares (

did not buy more, he did not sell. It might be a peanuts position for him
though (<$2M) + opportunity to have "director" position. Or he might do
something after 10K comes out. I was thinking that he will take UVIC private,
but I'm not so sure now. I would not base your investment decision on him doing
something though.

The dividend cut was motivated by new product line / manufacturing buildup
plans. If this is successful, the company may be a great bargain. If it's not,
then they threw away cash when they could have paid off the debt...

Obviously, you cannot buy this if you plan to trade or sell in bad conditions.
So far there has been very little selling (or buying ;)). I guess a lot of
stock is just closely held.

a major chunk of ROC. Furthermore, the company has great management, cash flows
and business model. Firm has been consistently paying down debt over the last 5
to 6 years....Great company! HOWEVER - It does not fit UTX business model or
its segments...

GR on the other hand has a Market Cap of USD 11bn. They are into aviation- so
very much a possible buy and the company fits into UTX business profile.
However, I am not sure if they want to sell. At a PE of 17, the company is
pretty debt heavy with low FCF......

Thats leaves TXT - good business, something UTX might be interested in,
however, their matrix suck, in terms of FCF, yield, leverage and so on..

ROC is the best of all of these, however, it does not fit the UTX

Hi NikhilJog -

From what I read they are looking at something in the $20B range. Some of the
analysts suggested that it would be a company that would complement their Jet
engine and/or military division(s) as they see a cut back in military/Gov
spending and want something to replace that cash flow. So I suspect that an
acquisition would sell into the public sector (non military) but use some of
the manufacturing processes from their current military driven businesses.

Goodrich Corp. (GR) would provide a lot of synergies especially if they could
build a subsidiary that manufactures and services the public airliner sector.
Specifically, I am thinking Boeing and that new $1T contract they landed with
UAL for the new 737 aircraft.

It appears that it will be no value buy and they may end up paying a large
premium to do such a deal.

As market continues to gyrate up and down, my purchases and sales start to feel
the same way. Some people might say that I am rebalancing the portfolio. Others
may say that I am improving its quality. Still others may find it pointless
exercise of losing the commissions and spreads while thrashing around. I think
it's the mixture of three. My cash level has not changed substantially, not
counting a large non-investment cash withdrawal that I had to make recently, so
the sales and purchases mostly balanced out. Hopefully, the portfolio has
indeed improved.

Fixed income. I decided to sell IGK and AEF as they approached par. Did not
rebuy them yet. Kept MHRprefs, GST-A and ARY.

In energy, I swapped some NXY for APA, MHR and TOT. Still not sure if it was a
good swap, but we'll see.

After discussions here on the thread, I decided to sell L. I also reduced my
position in DSX since I am not sure how much it is exposed to Euro crisis. As
IDCC price continues to dance around the somewhat-reasonable sellout value, I
reduced the position again. Possibly weak UFPT's position lead to partial sale.

I added some CTEL and PWRD. PWRD was recently discussed here after big price
drop.
New positions in PETS, ENI, ETN, AXP. All of these seem like good companies

cheaper price, but decided to return now.

In terms of errors of omission, I should have held CSR to the $6.4x current
value. Might have been better gain and better sleep than a lot of other
positions this year. At least one Chinese small cap that worked out for me and
other holders who bought it below the buyout price.

re UBS Adoboli / Societe General Kerviel case - did anyone notice that these
rogue trading accidents always occur in bear markets and they always involve
losses, but you never hear about a rogue trader in a bull market or one that
makes unauthorized trades and earns huge amounts of money.

While there may be valid reasons for this - a rogue trader very likely is one
that tries to cover up bad trades, so he increases position size, circumvents
the safety mechanism etc. I still wonder why all the reported rogue traders are
loosing and none of them was ever reported as winner.

Well my guess is that a winning rogue trader is not a rogue trader, he is "Da
man" who has balls, follows his instincts and don't let himself slow down by
bureaucracy and controllers. He get's promoted, makes gazillion of bucks and
probably runs a proprietary trading department.

FWIW UBS investment banking had accumulated losses of 40B CHF in 2008 and 2009,
made 2B CHF in 2010 and apparently lost it all in 2011. Moreover, the fallout
from the trading accident this year creates incredible image damage to UBS
wealth management division. If I ever seen a business that needs to be wind
down or sold (even if it fetches only one Clownbuck) it's probably UBS
investment bank.

>>Do any of these possible candidate acquisitions appear to you as value
buys?<<

IR for sure was at around 30$ - i bought it and I sold it already. I do think
it will be impacted by a slower economy.

re UVIC - looks like this company should cease production and convert into a
royalty trust instead. They made almost 3M$ in royalty income, which is not bad
with a market cap of only 6M$. The main patent 5,754,270 was filed in 1996 so
barring other patents, the royalty income stream could cease once the patent
expires in 2016.

Their market share is tiny relative to industry leaders like Ciba Vision
(Novartis) or J&J - I don't think they can win on innovation and those industry
leaders have access to better lens materials which is where most of the
innovation is in contact lenses.

They claim proprietary software for Lens design but lens design software is
readily available (Zemax, Code V) - there is not much proprietary stuff there.

I don't like large hedge fund ownership generally. Sort of a tough call as an
investment, imo.

re DL.AS - I decided to sell (at a loss) to reduce portfolio risk. I am taking
a 20% loss on my position.

I had some doubts before but grew really suspicious after reading through AV
(Delta Lloyds former owner and they still hold ~35% of their shares). States
reason for the majority sell was to reduce risk (not regulatory trouble like
Einhorn claimed) - Delta Lloyd has about 4B Euro in "equity exposure", which is
more than their stated book. This means that in addition to the expected spread
widening (which also reduces stated book) their book value must have taken an
additional hit from falling equity prices.

Their equity exposure is partly hedged as I understand, but partly means it's
not all hedged and hedging is expensive in volatile markets. I wonder if
Einhorn is buying more. It might be a super bargain at this point but I decided
to move on and reduce my risk potential for permanent impairments.

I might actually go long AV again (I did so last year), since I believe they
are fairly safe for an European life insurer (they boosted their capital levels
through sales of DL.AS and other divisions quite a bit). So far however, I
rather stick with industrials.

they mentoned on fast money the other day -" what do you call a rogue trader
who makes $2 billion for the bank?"

"a managing director".

Kind of like that the Packer kickoff returner who returned one from 8 yards
behind the goal line for a touchdown. The coach said he was cussing him till he
hit the 20.

When I worked in credit review for a major money center bank, there were
favored units that received kid glove treatment by senior management. Even
valid criticisms were discouraged. I am sure that environment exists elsewhere.
The only time I was aware of management clamping down was when some trading
unit in Norway made a ton of money buy buying norweigan bonds. they made so
much money that the bank sent in an auditing unit to norway to see exactly what
they were doing. Dont forget when rogue traders make money all their
supervisors benefit through larger bonuses. And everyone is aware of how much
money there are making. no one wants some two bit auditor pointing out that
such trader is exceeding limits or whatever until the sh** hits the fan then of
course its too late. I never understood why auditing functions at banks dont
report to someone who is appointed separately by the board from the staff
running profit centers.

I guess these trading departments are all black swan events waiting to happen.
yet another reason to stay away from major banks as investments.

Previous to that I worked for a small bank with around 20 branches in new york
city. The largest branch manager was an up and coming young guy, favored by the
chief lending officer, who once bragged to me that he could always find away
around the banks rules and regulations in order to get things done. He
subsequently was indicted for multiple counts of money laundering.
