Re CMO--They're very exposed to interest rate swings. Oddly, they're hit both
ways it seems, because of their funding mismatch (which may be better than it
was) and borrowers right of prepayment. Of course, $4 is much better than
$10--where I got in a couple of years ago. No position now, thankfully.

I wanted to own an energy (especially natural gas oriented) stock in my
portfolio and this seemed like a good choice. This may be simplistic but it
seemed like this stock was in the 20s in the past when oil and gas were at
these prices, meanwhile the company continues to grow reserves. Also it looks
like insiders are exercising options but not selling so they think its
undervalued. Believe me there are a lot of companies I wish I owned or bought
more of 6 months ago. BYW THQI continues to look just great fundamentally and
technically. I hope we will have a great couple of months with that one. I sold
entirely out of my ICGE. I decided that I was just uncomfortable owning a stock
at 50x book no matter how great the prospects were.

Reference <#3 will be when they find something to do with the cash. Either a
massive share buyback, a special dividend, or more likely an acquisition.>

It would seem to me that if management is competent, and elects either the
special dividend or an aquisition and does not do a stock buyback, then:

1. there is either something wrong with the stock or
2. there are better deals out there than the case you/others have made for maxs

Also, you left out the fourth thing they could do with this cash which is leave

TwoBear, et. al. Fertilizer business looks like it's pretty stinky.

We've talked about GRO before. I own it at higher prices. Rather than just add
to the position here which I had been thinking of doing, I decided I would
reduce the business risk (NOT the market risk or the industry risk)a little by
starting a position today in a somewhat comparable company - IMC Global (IGC).
I chose IGC because it's a bigger play - geographically more diverse (which
could be a plus or a minus) and having a much larger capitalization. The JR
Simplot Foundation has taken a substantial position in the stock recently.

I'm one who is acting on the assumption that the fertilizer industry is
cyclical, although I have no facts/figures/charts/ to support this- and that
we're perhaps somewhat near a cyclical low. I offer the following long-term
chart on IGL:

http://www.bigcharts.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=igl&sid=0&o_symb=igl&fr
q=2&time=20

In my opinion, it is really not long enough to draw conclusions that are valid.
But for indicative purposes, it looks like about lows every 6 years. (If past
repeats, we might see a low at 10-12, down from today's 16 price,) On the other
hand, every few years the stock has been about 30, and in most 12-month
periods, the stock hit 20. Very dangerous assumption though to read this chart
and presume there's a pattern and that the pattern will continue.

We also have the stock selling below tangible book value now (it usually sells
above), and a little bit of insider buying. On the other hand we have flat
sales over the past couple of years and erratic earnings. There's a change in
top management- maybe they'll be able to do better for the stockholders. I
notice this morning, that a larger IGL competitor, POT, is permanently closing
two plants and cutting earnings estimates in half. The stock is down 4 points
to about 53, which perhaps "reflects continued tough market conditions in
nitrogen and weakening business trends in potash and phosphate"

I think an IGL buy now could be about a two or three year waiting game
proposition. (That's not so appealing -g-.) Perhaps though with an 'escape
hatch' within 12 months if the investor could again see the stock at $20.

I have always thought this was a good company and certainly will start watching

-The size of the restructuring charge was startling for what it supposedly
covered.

-The health care system seems generally to be under a lot of financial stress.
Slow pays everywhere and particularly by HMOs to them is quite a concern. I

Homebuilders LEN, DHI and CTX are looking cheap now. Really
out-of-favor.

LEN, for example, is trading at a p/e of 6.4, compared to a
previous five-year low of 7.2.

Yet the companies are in good shape financially.

Here's a table I made:

p/e p/b debt/equity

LEN 6.4 1.1 0.9
DHI 6.3 1.2 1.3
CTX 7.2 1.3 <1

I computed debt including short term notes. CTX is not a
pure play: its financial services division accounts for
most of its debt, and if you exclude that, the debt/equity
for the homebuilding part appears to be considerably below
unity.

I own LEN, and I'm looking to add to the sector.

See the discussion by analysts for this sector in the next
post.

Thursday September 9, 1:29 pm Eastern Time
Company Press Release
SOURCE: The Wall Street Transcript
The Wall Street Transcript publishes Homebuilding Industry Report
NEW YORK, Sept. 9 /PRNewswire/ -- Four leading analysts examine the
Homebuilding Industry in the latest issue of The Wall Street Transcript
(212-952-7433).

In a vital review of this sector for investors and industry professionals, this
19-page report features an in-depth roundtable forum on the Homebuilding sector
(15,000+ words), four leading analysts: Robert Curran of Merrill Lynch, Timothy
Jones of Ryan, Beck & Co., Samuel Lieber of the Alpine Real Estate Equity Funds
and Stephen Kim of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown examine the current disparity
between strong sales, revenues and margins versus the low P/Es for sector
stocks, inventory levels, mobile home fundamentals, interest rate horizon,
low-and-no down payment plans, pricing power and labor costs.

The expert panel explores the competitive horizon, M&A activity, growth
segments, investor sentiment, management performance and investor concerns.
They analyze specific sector firms, and each analyst offers their
recommendations with some stocks receiving a consensus of positive opinion,
with the outlook for others disputed.

After recently raising his estimates for sector stocks by 10% and watching the
stocks subsequently fall 10%, Jones states, ``The P/Es are below the low
multiples of the last six and a-half years virtually across-the-board. In 31
years, I've never seen the stocks so cheap with the outlook so good.'

But, while housing inventories are near an all-time 30-year low, Jones
forecasts, ``We expect an inventory correction in the mobile home area that
could be quite painful. There are too many retailers, with too much inventory
per retailer, and an unhealthy increase in inventory at the manufacturing
level. In addition to severe price cutting, the securitization market continues
to be unstable with spreads widening. Our outlook is for a nine-month inventory
correction. You could see mobile home shipments dropping over 10% in the coming
months. Oakwood (NYSE: OH - news) intends to get rid of $50 million of
inventories this quarter and another $100 million the next year. Whatever the
estimates for this group are, they are too high across-the-board. This is in
sharp contrast to the builders, which I believe are going to increase earnings
28% this year and 11% next year.'

Many public homebuilders are broadening product lines and price points, Curran
cites, ``A prime example is Pulte Corporation (NYSE: PHM - news). Even if the
entry level segment should slip a bit, some of these public companies are
capable of increasing market share, perhaps offsetting a decline in industry
demand in that category. Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation (NYSE: KBH - news)
and M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: MDC - news) have redesigned homes in various
markets and are now delivering product priced well below that of their
competition. Market share is increasing.'

But even in the lower-priced segment, there has been a shift in demand for more
perceived value in features and amenities, Lieber asserts, ``Crossman
Communities (Nasdaq: CROS - news) builds basic entry level homes, yet they put
cathedral ceilings in many models, adding just little touches of luxury.
Obviously, more elegant bathrooms, better-appointed kitchens, preferably with
eat-in facilities, add appeal at a price, and you can go up the ladder to a
Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL - news) home if you're looking for three-car garages,
media rooms and spacious master suites.'

The aging of the baby boomers is causing some firms to shift focus toward
building retirement communities, Curran states, ``Del Webb (NYSE: WBB - news)
is the premier developer of retirement communities. U.S. Home (NYSE: UH - news)
derives a substantial minority of its sales from active adult communities,
which tend to be considerably smaller in scale than the retirement communities
of Del Webb. More companies are, although somewhat tentatively, committing
capital to this market niche. In particular, I would single out Pulte
Corporation and Centex Corporation (NYSE: CTX - news).'

The panel offers recommendations about which sector stocks are most likely to
reward investors.

Lieber shares his evaluation of homebuilding managements, ``Among companies
that are generating superior returns, Lennar (NYSE: LEN - news) has certainly
blossomed over the last few years, spinning off its commercial real estate and
finance operations and acquiring several smaller homebuilders. Now it is one of
the leading companies, in no small part because it has positioned itself very
well in terms of its geographic mix by expanding into California several years
ago with a significant operation. Ryland (NYSE: RYL - news) is a company that
had stumbled, and added new top management that is gradually turning that
company around.'

Singling out a manufactured housing management team, Jones adds, ``Clayton
Homes (NYSE: CMH - news) is the only manufactured housing company that I am
recommending. Its management does stand out. The management record is
unequalled in its sector -- consistent double-digit increases in profitability
every year since FY1980. The company's stock price continues to undervalue
Clayton's consistency and resiliency.'

Due to the present obsession with large-cap stocks, Kim states, ``Three, four
years out Centex (NYSE: CTX - news), Lennar, D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI - news) are
going to be the big cap names, and for that reason I like those stocks as
well.'

Lieber concurs, ``Kaufman & Broad and D.R. Horton are quality major players.
While no homebuilder trades for over 7 times earnings, some of the small caps
like Beazer Homes (NYSE: BZH - news) and M/I Schottenstein Homes (NYSE: MHO -
news) have p/e ratios under 5 times. I see a lot of cheap companies of quality,
but if I had to pick one, it would be Lennar.'

From:Michael Burry

Jeffrey,

I agree completely. HealthSouth is the low cost operator if things come to a
head, but I wonder at the size of the restructuring charge given what's covered
too. I believe this was really an attempt to lay out all the bad news in one
swoop, and the charge will cover a bunch of other things too.

Their AR is way up (at 1/4 of annual revs), but this is no manufacturing firm
stuffing the channel with unneeded product. HealthSouth provided needed,
documented services under contract with major insurers, and those major
insurers are simply not paying. Smaller doctor groups are going bankrupt
because of this widespread refusal of insurers to pay despite contractualy a,
and I believe this situation will break soon. There has to be some relief from
somewhere. That HealthSouth is actually producing free cash flow of about $640
million after cap ex, taxes, and interest coverage and despite the increasing
AR is tremendous. It's now going for about 7.5 times that very free cash flow.

I think it's important to focus too on the CEO's claim that Medicare will
become more profitable under PPS. For years, rehab prospered as one of the only
specialties free from the PPS bugaboo. They (and pediatrics) got a
cost-plus-profit-based reimbursement because nobody could figure out a good way
to measure the average cost of different illnesses from a diagnosis-related
perspective. For instance, Medicare would pay only X dollars for a broken femur
repair, and it was up to the hospital to provide the services for under X
dollars. This occurred via TEFRA of 1982 and the Social Security amendments of
1983 which established so-called DRG's, or Diagnosis-Related Groups.
After the femur was repaired (or stroke occurred, or head trauma occurred,
etc), the patient would be shipped to a rehab facility soon in order to get the
cost-plus-a-profit-based reimbursement and minimize the days under the
prospective payment plan. The sooner one could get the patient out of the acute
facility and into a rehab facility, the more money one could make. Rehab
facilities flourished from the mid-80's to the early 90s as many acute care
facilities built their own rehab adjuncts in order to take advantage of this
reimbursement loophole. 1987 was the first time the DHHS mandated a PPS for
rehab. But the deadlines passed without action because people were having a
hard time developing a measuring tool (most efforts centered on scoring the
physical ability of a rehab patient and paying a certain amount prospectively
depending on the numeric score, but there have been problems converting
phsyical qualities into numbers in a reliable fashion).

While working at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago during the summer of
1994, I wrote a paper entitled "The Coming Revolution in Rehabilitation
Medicine," which detailed the financial dynamics of the rehab industry for the
first time. I'll see if it's still around, and post it on my web site when I
get a chance.

Health care is a very very complex business. How the Medicare PPS will affect
rehab is uncertain, but due to the measurement difficulties associated with
rehab, it is possible it could turn into a decent profit-center again. Whatever
the situation, I am confident HealthSouth will be the one that can best take
advantage of it.

Rehab is absolutely one of the best things to hit medicine in the last 2
decades. If you want a pure play on the aging of the population, this is it.
And HealthSouth is the biggest, but by no means dominant. There is still room
for growth, both internal and external.

I took a smallish position before the crash, and quickly doubled the next
morning when I signed on. If I had been up when it opened in the 4's, I might
have tripled up. This is as contrarian as contrarian gets.

Jim, my number one priority right now is to read the "Art of Short Selling" by
Staley one more time. I am not short anything right now, but ache to do so, if
I can do it right.

Just two pitches for my way of doing things (feel free to ignore and move on):

Having a fairly diversified long portfolio worked wonders for me yesterday (and
kept me from doing anything rash ;)) I was down a minimal 0.35%. But I had been
up so much the previous two days in relation to the indices that I was
surprised to see that despite HealthSouth I outperformed the indices ('cept the
Nasdaq of course) over the last three days. My pitch for diversification to
15-20 value stocks: something will be moving up for you on average. Over the
last few mos I've had to deal with Fair Isaac's 44 to 26 fall and HealthSouth.
Because of those two stocks, I'm not up much since the end of June, but I am at
least up.

Also, I think HealthSouth points up a big difference between a value investor
who uses technical analysis to help find bottoms, and a contrarian investor who
just uses technical analysis. I have a rule that I sell when a new low is hit.
But I also have a rule to either add more or sell the position when I'm off 33%
since initiation. No waffling. When a stock trickles to a new low, despite the
fundamentals I'm going to exit. The reason being it can turn into a New
Holland, Deswell, Fruit of the Loom or Champion, and a screaming bottom might
be in the works later. But when a stock falls 40% through its old lows in one
day on 35X average volume with 8 broker downgrades, a technician would be
paralyzed and sell. A value investor would find it an opportune place to buy if
the original fundamental story is intact. This is just my pitch for how a
minimal degree of technical analysis doesn't hurt and can help. Pepsi is a
losing position for me now because I called it a Buffett stock and hence
justified buying "for the long-term" and didn't wait for the stock to fall to
its trading range lows (12.5% lower). BTW, technically Pepsi is now in no-man's
land,and I wouldn't buy again unless it gets to the high 20's.

Just rambling,
Mike

Wallace: Some thoughts/notes on toys.

I'm not much of a toy shopper, toy buyer or game (electronic/computer) player.
I don't particularly follow these businesses. But here's what I see:

Electronic game companies are at, or approaching, new highs.

Eidos (EIDSY) - about 66, up from about 10. Lara Croft expands to cartoons,
clothing

Electronic Arts (ERTS) - 76, up from 33. Per Yahoo, that's 30x Mar. '01
earnings. All 14 analysts rate it a buy!

Midway Games (MWY) about 16, up from 7. From their 9/9 press release: "With
four titles at launch and a fifth on the way before Thanksgiving, Midway is
supporting Sega Dreamcast with more titles than any other third party
publisher. "

THQ Inc. (THQI) - about 32, in a yearly range of 13-34. PE about 14 per Yahoo.

Jakks Pacific (JAKK) - 36 in a range of 7-36. "Action Figures" (i.e. Wrestler
dolls) for boys.

Play By Play Toys (PBYP) - about 4 &#189; in a range of 1 to 11. Very
interesting to me. Was on my watch list as a value stock. Book value about 9. A
real microcap. Stock was steadily dropping, dropping to about 1 two weeks ago.
Looked like very iffy investment or business. Then, they announced they got a
license for Pokemon products. Stock shot to 11.

Toys R Us (TOY) - 15 in a range of about 13-24. Hovering around book value.
Market cap $3.6 B.

eToys (ETYS) - 53 in a range of 28-85. Market cap about $5.0B., psr 48.0.

(As I've posted before, I've got positions in TOY, MWY, and THQ, and (-g-),
I've got a negative attitude on eToys )

Mike, you may not recall but I spent a career as an actuary in Group Insurance.
All the time we had to deal with cutthroat competition that undercharged for
the coverage provided, either because they did not do the very difficult job of
estimating future costs very well, were shady operators who did not care if one
day reserves for unpaid claims were totally inadequate, or whatever. Providing
coverage for health care, which is ultimately where a lot of the money comes
from to pay providers like HRC, has always been a high risk, low margin
business with too many competitors.

My hunch is that except for the huge drop last week which may have taken HRC to
a low that will hold I would wait until; some of their
AR goes bad and we have some press about some HMOs going under. I don't see
enough blood in the streets yet.

I do think companies like HRC are further along in getting to a bottom than the
manufactured housing ones, but the business is also less attractive.

Correction according to Barrons FTL debt which sold 6 mos ago at close to par
is now at .37 to the dollar, I think the par yield is around 8.75%, almost
seems like buying the bonds would be the way to go here. If the company
survives you triple your money and get 27% annualy while you wait. I know
nothing about this company but sure would be interested if someone feels like
doing a full blown analysis or has done one. I know my bank had a big loan to
Farley and FTL in the late 80s and the stock was in the 9s at the time. Perhaps

Next time you enthusiastically support a stock, remind me to jump in with both
feet.

My take on this and not specific to HRC is that the health care business has
really been under a lot of pressure and no one wants to be investing in an
unpredictable quagmire. Unfortunately when something falls 40% there is no
assurance that it won't fall another 40% a week later. I see that OXHP and has
not really recovered from its debacle, and Beverly Enterprises seems to post
new lows annually despite some insider buying and periodic bullish write-ups in
Barrons. HRC may turn out to be a gem in this thing, but it reminds me of
something Buffet once said and I may be paraphrasing- it was about being in a
business where you do not have to be too bright too make money at it, right now
it doesn't seem to pertain to health care. How could we tell when this industry
starts to turn around?

BTW there was a plug for GZSP in last week's Barrons.

Armin, the debt at that level is definitely the way to go if one has to buy
into the company. I would not touch the stock with a 10 foot pole. The debt
will give a superior return to the stock if the company recovers and probably
superior if it does not.

The Moody's review is very helpful reading:

http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/990903/qf.html

I personally would buy the 7's of 11, if I were interested, as they are a
higher ranked credit, and publicly traded on the AMEX. You get close to 17%
return and a potential 140% gain.

Armin, GZSP in last week's or this week's Barron's?

On health care, I am not sure it will turn around in the sense that it will go
from being a lousy business to being a good business. It seems to be
politically correct for providers to remain at death's door and for
HMOs/insurance companies to be unable to charge enough to have no problems
paying their obligations. That is why I have always stayed away, as these firms
are too dependent on government reimbursement, and government has conflicting
constituencies here.

Earlier in the Clinton reign I thought the HMOs would end up ruling the world
but be regulated like utilities with an allowed rate of return. So far it
hasn't happened.

Mike:

My number one priority right now is to read the "Art of Short Selling" by
Staley one more time. I am not short anything right now, but ache to do so, if
I can do it right. 

80% of my trades are short sales. The bull market has created a huge number of
opportunities - not because the market is over-valued, but because the mania
produces enough greedy fools to make obvious scams successful.

For example, in July I shorted Uniprime UPCA. Stock quadrupled in a day when
they said they had a cure for AIDS. Uniprimes main business is auto
dealerships, I kid you not. CEO in jail now.

How about FSTW, which I owned long for 18 months until the day they said they
had a deal to sell their enterprise software to Microsoft. Stock ran from $1.50
to $9 in a day. The deal is that a 100 employee unit of MS did buy the product,
for internal use. Value of deal $100,000.

How did I find out about these things? I am a member of Anthony Elgindy's
private membership site. http://www.anthony @pacific.com 150 people working
together to find facts fast on the big movers of the day.

Current opportunity - Amplidine. Check the thread here. Stock has gone from $3
to $16 in 2 days - now $12.

It is the twin brother of Value Investing, Un-Value Investing.

We don't usually do this on this thread, but two of the posts I just read made
me think so much that I just want to repost both, with full credit to the

out and post at eye level above my desk at work. Thanks Mike and Jeff.

Mike Burry (re: HRC's plunge days after he bought it)
<<When a stock trickles to a new low, despite the fundamentals I'm going to
exit. The reason being it can turn into a New Holland, Deswell, Fruit of the
Loom or Champion, and a screaming bottom might be in the works later. But when
a stock falls 40% through its old lows in one day on 35X average volume with 8
broker downgrades, a technician would be paralyzed and sell. A value investor
would find it an opportune place to buy if the original fundamental story is
intact.>>

Jeff Bash (re: my experience having an internet short run 40% on me in a half
an hour, and I shorted more because I physically felt the "kick in the gut". I
mean it, I was almost sick. I posted a much more detailed message, which Jeff
apparently caught, and then had second thoughts about posting that publicly and
diluted it significantly.)
Jeff: <<I know myself that the hit in the gut feeling is always a contrarian
indicator. The only one better is the "I don't care, I have to get out, I just
can't take it any more" signal, which unfortunately took me out of (instead of
into) some stock at the bottom last Fall.>>

Well, what is value worth these days, look at the performance of those value
funds. Growth has seemed to outperform value every time, that is why we
officially use the GARP (Growth At a Reasonable Price) method for discretionary
portfolios. In my modelportfolio for the US you will find names like MSFT, WMT,
GE, T, etc.

The thing we all hope for is that in the future the trend will turn from growht
to value stocks, when will it happen? It will take a while. We need a clear
change in investment style.
All the institutions follow the growth method, look what companies are in the
indices and those are the companies invested in by people like me. I cannot
deviate from it too much otherwise my bet against the index is too big.

I like value plays, but also try to look to trade them right. The risk with
HDWY is IMO low (except for a large economic slowdown off course), but we have
no triggers with this company, it misses momentum. I am sure it will trade will
above 6 again, maybe with the next numbers, which is still a good return from
these levels. In the meantime it is still a take over candidate, but the
company I was hoping for (Brunel, a dutch company) recently merged with another
Dutch company. So, I don't think this company will be doing the acquisition.

Hain is expensive of course, but I think it will be taken out above USD 30, so
it is not a value play.
But the risk could also be that it only gets an alliance with a bigger brother
(like Kellog). Who knows.

Sorry for not coming back to you sooner, I am working too hard these days, have
to give several investment presentations in Lat. America soon.

If I have time I will look more into the stocks mentioned here, don't know when
this will be.

Mike, I can see a relaxation of the pressure on the healthcare stocks, for the
ones like HRC (perhaps) which get truely oversold, giving a decent return,
especially on a risk adjusted basis. However, the truly extraordinary returns
come from that combined with a relaxation of the pressure on company

Peter, interesting post on shortselling. I think the idea of a cooperative team
effort to research candidates is a good idea.
(It seems that Uniprime is delisted as I can't even find it -- 100%
in 2 months is great!)

However, from the point of view of full disclosure, anthony@pacific
appears to have been thrown off Silicon Investor for something which evidently
violated their view of Terms of Use, with respect to his postings on NTOP, if
my memory serves me right. Anyone who shorted it when he was posting got
killed.

I will repeat my view of shortselling. You don't short either strong charts or
strong fundamentals unless you like to gamble. You short weak charts combined
with weak fundamentals. I guess I would make an exception for scams like
Uniprime. The following chart is instructive:

http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=XICO&d=5y

Xicor had both strong fundamentals and a strong chart from early 1995 to late
1996 and would have been a poor short. The fundamentals started turning south
in late 1996 and the chart confirmed it, but it still was not a great short
until late 1997. This company is in the notoriously cyclical semiconductor
industry and even then it took more than a year for the stock to totally roll
over. Most companies are less cyclical. (By the way, both the fundamentals and
chart are strong now.)

The problem with the so-called value funds is that they mostly buy large caps
with big dividends. In other words, no growth and possibly declining
fundamentals.

Most of the value we talk about here resides in the mid-small-micro caps. I
don't know that many of the traditional value funds mirror what we pick here.

Yeah, I'm gonna toot my own horn...For a picture of a value-oriented portfolio,
that is doing pretty well without the techs and the MSFT, WMT, GE, T, etc.,
take a look at http://www.valuestocks.net ...
Value doesn't always have to lag, and can actually work, even with the country
crazy on growth stocks.

What the value funds did in the second quarter way underestimated how most of

Ntilda: Thanks for the posts regarding home builders.

Seems like on this thread, as on Wall Street, they don't get too much respect
-g-. Except maybe for manufactured housing, not much discussion here.

From what I can tell, almost all of the stick home builders are undervalued.
We'll know in about 18 months - if not sooner. I've recently posted that I've
added to my positions in SPF and to WBB. I'm looking now at KBH. (I like the
way they operate and that they - like SPF - are strong in the booming
California market.) I've passed on Schuler (SHLR)-- they are a good play for
the Hawaiian market, but that market is apparently or allegedly depressed and
SHLR profits seem like they might be coming now from a merger with a firm
strong in the booming Denver market. Occasionally, I'll review HOV as an East
Coast play, but I've not bought. Similarly, I like UH as a "national" home
builder, but I've never stepped up and bought. It looks attractive now too -
especially I'd guess, if it could maintain its current volume. BZH gets
mentioned here once in a while. Since I've already got some exposure to the
group, I've not really considered LEN, DHI, or CTX.

I do also like ancillary businesses to the home builders. For example, raw land
holders in California. This thread has discussed Tejon Ranch (moved up very
nicely from its recent lows), Newhall Land (finally starting to build homes on
its big tract), and Catellus Development (which I own and which stock has
languished). Also in Florida, St. Joe has been mentioned several times by at
least one knowledgeable person. Couple more were mentioned briefly on this
thread also.

And the stuff that goes into houses, I'm interested in too. I'm passing on
Pulaski Furniture (PLFC) for now even as it has a low pe and the stock is
hitting new lows. Also passing for now on carpet manufacturer Mohawk Industries
(MHK) which is near its lows and reporting good quarterly earnings.

And then there's property & casualty and mortgage insurance. But that's another
story.

Re: home builders, I've gone with Crossman Communities at 25 1/4. I like their
return on investment characteristics, inventory management both of which seem
to be near the top of the industry. Still small but significant, with good
roomf or growth come hell or high interest rates. Sells lower-cost homes in
midwest and southeast, and to me for this reason has lower exposure to higher
interest rates (for both the low-end reason and the favorable long-term
geographic reason).

Bought it today. Added Maxwell Shoe, and more Ross Stores. Also trying my luck

OT I have increased my position once again in IDTC after it dropped to 21 3/4.
I do not know if this will be the end of the decline, but my current assesment
is that NTOP is worth at least $30 a share. 57% of that is $17.10 and that
interest would probably sell for a premium. At these levels I believe that
means the rest of the company is free, and hence I am a buyer at these levels.
Also listening to the president Couter.sic. I realized he is personally pissed
off at the way his own stock is doing and sounds determined to push for some
action to be taken to increase the valuation. so I have decide not to take a

To COO holders, of which there have been some on this thread: I post regularly
on the subject on YAHOO. In my opinion, there is too much
"smoke" in terms of price/volume for the odds not to be fair to good for a
takeover at $40+ in the near future. I am holding my position

As I said If NTOP were at 30, irrespective of what the market might value IDTC,

alone. I am not on margin so if the price of IDTC continues to decline I will
probably just increase my position and wait for sanity to return. FYI Jules

10,000 verses 6 million...

Do you really think that 10,000 shares of insider selling is a problem? The guy
is only listed as a shareholder. The way I see it the Company has already
bought back almost 4 million shares so I tend to believe them when they say
they plan to buy back the rest (I don't usually believe most buyback
announcements because most never happen).

Have you seen this quote... "Fidelity National Financial, which sells title
insurance through agents and offices across the US, will leap into the nation's
top spot when it completes its acquisition of larger rival Chicago Title."

Real estate is looking up in Southern, Cal and in other regions. Also, FNF has
been listed as a possible takeover candidate for insurance firms...

Mike - I have met with the management of Crossmann several times, and they are
absolutely the best of the best. A gem of a company. But when people panic,
what they sell first are small cap homebuilders. Crossmann winds up near book
value when that happens. My buy price would be close to book value in a panic,

at downside risk of about $15, so be careful.

Monte Friesen: regarding FNF and value. The simple answer is yes, FNF is a
value stock. The more complicated question is: should it be bought? I do not
have a good answer for that. For anybody who is thinking of simply buying FNF,
he/she should carefully consider some alternatives.

I have posted on this thread a couple of times about CTZ. Which now is in the
process of being acquired by FNF, as you mentioned. But what you didn't say,
and what is important, is that the buyout is for FNF stock valued at $52. This
while CTZ trades today for $40 per share. IF, that's IF, one believes the offer
will be completed and at the agreed upon terms, in my opinion, anyone and
everyone who wants FNF should buy CTZ. I'm betting the deal will be
consummated, maybe for a lower price than 52 but at a higher price than 40.
I've posted here that I have upped my CTZ position. (I'm still not sure though
if I'm going to keep all or even part of the FNF stock if/when the deal
closes.)

Another stock in the title insurance business should also be evaluated by
potential value investors, imo. And that's FAF. There are other companies out
there too, but I've focused my attention on FAF. FAF is (per Yahoo) selling
about at book value, has (right now anyway -g-) a very good ROE, sells at its
lows (they all do), has some cash and not too much debt. It's also twice as big
($3B sales) as FNF and more diversified (outside of just title--which may or
may not be a positive). (I've posted here that I've started a position in FAF.)

Possibly all this is irrelevant. These stocks all seem to have fallen together.
Maybe when the cycle turns (assuming it does), they will also all rise, so
trying to determine which is the best may not be helpful to investment
performance.

All just my opinion,

Re: Crossman, it's a stock well off its lows, and its lows were last fall,
below book value, so your observations certainly seem valid. When I'm buying
it, I'm betting that we are at a nadir in sentiment on homebuilders. That may
not be the case, and the interest rates (which are very much out of my control
and predictive ability) will dictate that to a large degree. I can choose to
exit when it breaks 25 or 20. Or I can hold, hold, hold, and crucify myself on
it like I did with Deswell (yep still got it in all accounts). If it does fall,
I hope it spares me the grief and just crashes quickly to 15 so I can just buy
more.

IDTC, I think I forgot to publish my message yesterday. I wrote a piece about
IDTC.

If you value the core business at USD 10 (which is very conservative because
CIBC Oppenheimer values the core business at USD 15). That leaves about USD 14
for the value of the NTOP stake. If there was no price mismatch NTOP should be
trading at about USD 18, it is now trading at USD 65, talking about a price
mismatch.

One of the brokers I talk to saw the CEO on TV lately, at that time he was not
making such a good impression, but in the end of the interview he said,
investors will one day realize that NTOP is for real (today's news was also
great) and then they will realize that we have a 58% stake in that company.

If I were the management of IDTC I would be thinking about the fact that the
58% stake in NTOP is worth far more than their own business. Why not lower your
stake and bring the rest to the market in a secondary. If the price is right
(let's say USD 60) IDTC stock will take off. Now I think the stocks
appreciation will be limited to what NTOP does. If this stock goes back to 80
IDTC could go back to 29-30 level. If there comes speculation about selling the
stake the stock will fly.

Just my opinion, I bought in today for myself.

Rene, I believe that some of the NTOP stock is pledged to banks who have loans
out to IDTC. Also it is very important that IDTC retains a controlling interest
in NTOP because NTOP will be a major user of IDTC's infrastructure and lease
commitments. It is very difficult I think to place a realistic value on NTOP as
so much will depend upon the competition and growth in Europe, Latin America
and Asia. But I Believe that IDTC other assets are worth at least $15, and its
interest in NTOP at least $20 so I bought back as I can see a return in excess
of 40%.

I would appreciate your thoughts on NITE if you have any. It is the one stock

Comment on builders--A couple of reasons they don't "get much respect" are (1)
their accounting is suspect, sometimes. As a former commercial banker, I can
remember the problems in some balance sheets and income statements we received.
Sometimes a little over-creative. Unfortunately, there seems to be a fair
amount of room for that in the building process. (2) exposure to both the
economic cycle and interest rates. They can get a double-whammy hit with a big
rise in rates with inflation and economic retrenchment.

By the way, Paul, I think I was the one who warned you off ALL some time ago.
Unfortunately I still have it! I've got to learn when to sell. :o(.

Interesting after-hours movement in Oracle. They made estimates but not the

My take on Oracle: it was a screaming buy at 23-24, where I bought all my
shares. I sold a portion at 36 9/16, and then sold the rest at 38 15/16.
Reasoning: The stock was coming to old highs, and had moved tremendously well
for me in a short period of time. I try very hard not to get greedy when I have
big short-term gains in a touchy market, and Oracle was an example of me
forcing the rule. Fair Isaac was an example of not enforcing the rule, and it
round tripped from 34 to 45 to 26.

My opinon on Oracle hasn't changed since I wrote this:

Armin, I can't let those NITE sentences go by me -g-

"I would appreciate your thoughts on NITE if you have any. It is the one stock
that is hurting me right now. The consistent downward trend has me mystified."

I suppose value investors would be mystified why you wouldn't be surprised in
experiencing some tumultuousness, given that NITE's stock is selling at 6x
sales and in a wild range of 2 to 82 (now 34) and 33x earnings and it's being a
NASDAQ market maker too.

It's that you ask the wrong question, imo. You should be asking why are all my
other stocks doing okay? Because if none of your other stocks are hurting you
now, my opinion is you are too concentrated either in industry or number of
positions, or your style is very momentum correlated.

Well, that's my opinion anyway. Although for me, that must mean I'm doing the
right thing since I'm hurting in so many places. -g-. Lol.

Ambac is looking very attractive as an add for me at 50 and change, 13 times

double in two years or so. It dropped today with other insurance companies even
though Ambac's business has nothing whatsoever to do with hurricanes.

You want safety if things get rocky, Ambac is it. Their business is long-tail,
and the profits are booked year by year. And unlike other insurers, there is
virtually no risk of permanent loss of capital on default. This is a special
business, and it is a bargain at 50 IMHO.

Shane, TSG is on my watch list thanks to your heads-up. I looked for insider
activity -- http://www.insidertrader.com is a good source -- and saw primarily
option exercises. If we were to see any insider buying now that would be a very
bullish indicator that there is less than meets the eye wrt recent CEO
resignation (ie, he really did choose to leave for personal reasons, etc.). If
I see such activity I'll post. Otherwise, still watching.

In a similar insider vein, DAB as I mentioned in earlier posts has been
pounded, and insiders bought 2 days after the pre-announcement (insiders
typically must wait 48 hours after a PR to trade the stock). The fact that a
few jumped in right after the 2 day "blackout" [the PR was 8/27, trades made
8/30 amd 8/31] is a bullish signal IMO. Plus I did some recent Peter Lynch

Thanks Armin, I will check your view with my brokers. NITE, I think this stock
is a buy (not value but growth) when the market is at very low activity. Today
there were several downgrades in EPS from two different brokers. The downgrades
were not minor to say.

So, if you expect that the coming period will be a slow period for internet
brokers (like Schwab, who had 14% lower commission income in one month) I would
stay away. The stock has no momentum, but will get it again if everything turns
positive again.
In the long run I think Internet trading is at the beginning stage and will
continue to grow fast. So, in the long run the stock should be able to
outperform big.
I have it the stock on my first screen with US stocks and keep following this

J. Bash: re COO, SEMI

Okay, I'll go with your opinion, and try to continue holding my remaining
position in COO.

Have reviewed SEMI per your mention here. There's something odd about it, but I
can't put my finger on what. Maybe too family controlled, too few profits,
something. Also, very small- both as microcap and being 5th "largest"
distributor in its industry.

Nevertheless, positives for me outweigh negatives. Stock below book, co. has
increases in sales, and doesn't look like insiders are bailing out. Net-net is
$4.6 (I figure). Stock is under 4. Additionally there is also perhaps another
way of looking at SEMI - the J Bash factor-- which I interpret at some good dd
was done which concluded the business model was viable, there was some
margin-of-safety, and a J Bash position in the stock was taken.
So for me, total picture = it's a buy.

Float is very small- tough to get good entry points here. Still, I've started
to accumulate. Will buy more (well, I'm positive now-- we'll see about later)
if stock drops to mid-3.

SWS worth a look. Has dropped to 11 times current years projected earnings,

re. homebuilders, I calculated an average p/e of 7.1 for the 7 stocks
recommended by Merrill Lynch. That's based on trailing 12 months, at today's
price.

The Sept. 9 ML research report on the sector says these 7 stocks will have eps
growth of 32% in CY99 and 12% in CY00.

The valuation looks very good to me, with a p/e of 7 and double-digit growth
rates.

It seems that Mr. Market is pricing the sector assuming a scenario that is a
lot uglier than ML's.

the ML seven are: LEN KBH DHI MDC TOL CTX PHM
http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=LEN+KBH+DHI+MDC+TOL+CTX+PHM&d=t

Earlier this week I added KBH and DHI to my existing position in LEN. One
attraction to LEN and KBH is that they have a high exposure to California.

I agree with Michael that CROS has superb management and business model. The
disadvantage I see is that I just don't want to pay a premium in p/e and p/b
for a smaller cap company where the differences in ROE compared to the bigger
players are not that great.

I've had a change of sentiment on the homebuilders. We all agree they're
cyclical. And one of the oldest rules of the market is to buy cyclicals when
the PEs are high or nonexistant, not when they are low. Low PE's in the
cyclicals classically call market tops, and if so then sans wealth effect all

For still more opinions about the pros and cons of homebuilders as value
stocks, here's a column from Individual Investor Online where several analysts
are interviewed:

Industry Analysis

Aug 17, 1999
Other: Why Homebuilders are Dirt Cheap
Bob Hirschfeld (8/17/99)

Wondering about the effect of rising mortgage rates on the homebuilder
industry?

On August 12th, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate went over the 8% level for the
first time in two years, reaching 8.17%, according to the Bank Rate Monitor, as
compared to 6.75% at the beginning of February, and about 6.95% at the end of
April.

Mortgage rates are rising in synch with bond market rates. Because 30-year
mortgages typically last only 5 to 10 years -- as homeowners move or refinance
-- the 10-year Treasury is a better proxy for mortgages than the 30-year. Of
course, both 10- and 30-year Treasury rates have been rising in recent weeks,
on fears that the Fed will raise rates when it meets August 24th.

Higher mortgage rates tend to dampen the housing sector by increasing monthly
mortgage payments, which tends to scare away prospective homebuyers. However,
higher rates generally take a while to impact housing sales, since the
home-buying process typically takes 30 to 90 days.

Right now, the average consumer is still filled with a lot of 'so what?' when
it comes to rates. Consumer confidence is still super-high. The National
Association of Home Builders looks for 1999 housing starts to reach 1.62
million, a new record.

Mortgage rates have been climbing since mid-January and home buying has
remained strong. As analyst John Stanley of Warburg Dillon Read points out,
despite the 130 basis point rise in mortgage rates so far this year, in July
new home orders rose 19% overall and about 10% on a per community basis.

And homebuilders are making good money, virtually across the board. For the
second quarter, according to Stanley, the group turned in average earnings per
share (EPS) gains of 50% over last year, and exceeded the consensus estimate by
25%.

Looking ahead, Stanley says he is looking for a 35% EPS increase for 1999,
year-over-year. If you compare that to the S&P 500's approximate 10% EPS
increase, you'll see one reason why many value investors have found the
homebuilding sector so attractive.

Another reason why homebuilding stocks look great is that shares are trading at
historically low multiples of 6 to 7 times 1999 estimates, while the S&P 500
still sports a mid-twenties multiple. And the potential upside is huge. As
Stanley writes, during times when 'cyclical concerns have been in remission,'
homebuilders trade at 10 to 15 times earnings.

However, here's a case in which the value argument has gone largely unheard on
the Street. For example, an average of the four homebuilder stocks mentioned in
this article is off 17% year-to-date.

Are rising interest rates a death knell for the homebuilders? Stanley thinks
not. On August 11, the analyst wrote that he was 'cheering along' rising rates,
in hopes that the Fed might engineer another soft landing, which, he believes,
could set the stage for a 'dramatic expansion in multiples.'

Del Webb

Stanley said his favorite stock in the group is Del Webb (NYSE:WBB - news) ,
which is building a national network of retirement communities for baby
boomers, a segment Stanley claims is recession-resistant. Stanley says the
stock is very cheap at 6.8 times current 1999 earnings of $3.11 (which is up
37% from one year ago), and at 6 times the analyst's June-fiscal, year 2000
estimate of $3.50 per share. Stanley has a Strong Buy on shares and a $38 price
target on shares. The stock closed Monday at $21.

Homebuilder analyst Bill Crow, at Raymond James, is less sanguine than Stanley
about interest rates. On August 12, Crow told us that rising interest rates
over the past thirty days were prompting a 'macro call,' and leading him to
downgrade three homebuilders: Crossmann (NASDAQ:CROS - news) , Lennar (NYSE:LEN
- news) and Pulte (NYSE:PHM - news) . All were dropped to Accumulate from
earlier Buy ratings.

Crow said, 'we're already fighting negative sentiment,' adding, 'now that
investors are questioning the duration of the economic expansion, we're facing
a double whammy.' Crow noted that, 'we've reached historically high levels of
home ownership,' which is another negative, in its implication that the market
may be close to saturation. Crow conceded, though, that the fundamentals remain
intact. In Crow's words: 'if you look at the numbers alone, there's no reason
to be negative on the sector, given the companies' strong market shares and
gross margins.'

Reiterating a theme he sounded in May, Crow said that most builders show strong
backlogs, which provide a revenue cushion, noting in particular that, as of two
weeks ago, Lennar's cancellation rate on ordered homes had not changed one bit.

Crow added that inventory levels continue to be low because the builders 'can't
get in front of themselves,' given the still-very-strong demand visible in
certain markets, like California, where it's not unheard of for prospective
buyers to wait overnight to sign on new homes.

Crossman Communities

Crow's favorite builder, despite his recent downgrade, is Crossmann, a company
he believes will do better than others in a rising rate environment, given its
specialty of building lower-cost homes (Crossmann is the top builder of
low-cost, single-family home in the Midwest and Southeast).

According to Crow, the rate-related mortgage payment differential on a mortgage
for a $90,000 home is 'a lot less' than on one for $200,000. The company's
average sales price is $117,000. In addition, the analyst likes the firm's
rapid turnaround time. By turning inventory an average of six times per year,
Crossmann delivers a return on equity (ROE) that is at or among the top of the
industry. For the second quarter, it was 24%.

Crossmann's second quarter earnings of $0.75 per share were 63% higher than a
year ago, and $0.09 ahead of consensus estimates. As Crow notes, the company's
backlog augers a solid second half.

At $26, Crossmann trades at 7.7 times Crow's recently raised 1999 estimate of
$3.39 and 6.4 times his year 2000 estimate of $4.07. The analyst rates
Crossmann a Buy and writes that 'outstanding financial results and strong
backlogs essentially assure that 1999 results will be impressive, with
year-over-year EPS growth expectations of 32% for Crossmann.'

Bottom Line:

Homebuilders continue to be an extremely undervalued sector, which makes it
hard to counsel selling shares. While higher interest rates are seen as a
threat, higher rates, as Stanley points out, might serve to reduce the
economy's excess steam, rather than turn the engine off. We recommend that
investors stick with their picks in this sector, and perhaps add to their
holdings by including shares of the two recession-insensitive companies
mentioned here -- Dell Webb and Crossmann.

My understanding there's some 170 million shares of priceline getting unlocked
by February. Also understand their whole story is their patents - but they're
controversial, since they're basically trying to patent a business model and
many think it won't stand court challenges. There was a whole Forbes cover
story on it. There's virtually no barriers to entry otherwise. Now Microsoft
Expedia is getting into the act, as is TSG. There's really no reason to buy
them, since the basic replacement cost is so little, so I see buyout risk as
low but there. That said, the stock just crumbled under support and I'm
shorting into the dead cat bounce. That's my logic anywho.

And re my flip of Crossman (in and out in one day after it broke support at

re. <<Got out of quite a few stocks today as support was violated.>>

I would humbly suggest that perhaps you got out at a bottom on Thursday.

Yesterday looked like a market bottom to me, based on VIX and put/call ratios.

VIX is the best intraday indicator for a bottom. It peaked at 30 intraday
yesterday. Lately, values in the high 20's have marked intermediate-term
bottoms. The peak at nearly 30 yesterday called the bottom intraday. When I saw
it, I begin looking for a few new longs and to close a short or two. If I had
thought of it, I should have bought index calls.

The VIX peak was verified at the end of the day when the CBOE put/call was
reported at 0.81. This also suggests a bottom. Even last October, when the
ratio went above unity, it did so only a few days and the ratio 0.81 occurred
within a few days of the bottom.

I don't have much confidence in most TA, except for one thing: there are
several excellent sentiment-based indicators of market bottoms. We just saw two
of them yesterday.

Plese tell me more about VIX. My take on yesterday was that a lot of the
morning decline was overdone and somewhat manipulated. I also suspect that
today's advance is somewhat manipulated. Triple witching , friday short
convering into the weekend. I am discountng today's action for the time being
and we shall see what next week brings.

VIX is a sentiment indicator. It is a measure of the implied volatility in
certain index options traded on the CBOE. I think the data comes from CBOE:
http://www.cboe.com/tools/statistics/summeriz.asp

As options traders get more panicky, they start paying greater premiums and VIX
goes up. As they get more relaxed, it goes down. Like other sentiment
indicators, it offers more precise indications of a bottom than of a top.

The thresholds for what represents a high value of VIX can vary; lately an
intraday value in the very high 20's indicates a market bottom. During the Oct
98 panic they got higher, though.

VIX is quoted by stock quote services as if it were an index, for example:

To get an idea of how VIX indicates market bottoms, you can look at this chart,
which is plotted on an inverted scale:

Wallace,

After further review, I added SWS yesterday. They may come in below estimate
this Q, but IMO it's undervalued at the current price. It's one of my long term
holds and I'm comfortable here - guess that's all that really matters. Besides,
I made so much off the run-up that my position is well below zero -g-

I've gotten my best returns trading the brokerages - SWS, AMTD, JWG, JBOH.
There seems to be constant upgrades and downgrades making them overbought or
oversold. SWS is the only one I've considered worth a long term position. (One
must always remember that brokerage insiders are all scoundrels -g-)

Consider the analyst's gradings. A downgrade from Buy to Accumulate on 8/20.
Prior to 8/20 SWS had dropped from over $80 to $38. His downgrade comes late
and is part of the continued fall to below $27 yesterday. It would be
interesting to see if he put out the Buy rating after the price had gone up
from $16.50 where I bought. I began reducing at $28. By $38 I had sold most of
it, but watched it go over $80 because the analysts kept upgrading it.

Saw the same on CMDC. It started falling from over $30 on rumors of financial
problems for an affiliated company. THEN the analysts started downgrading and
the funds starting selling. I bought at 7.50 because it was selling at BV and a
PE around 6 - it rebounded to 9.50 - another analyst downgraded so I quickly
took profits and it fell to 6.50. This morning I raised my limit order because
it appears there's funds accumulating at this level.

Very much appreciate your input,
Ron
