For example, it doesn't ring true to me when they say they can't disclose a
holding's margins for "competitive" reasons.

I disagree. That is the advantage of being private. If it is not public
knowledge that you have significant economic rent that could otherwise
disappear with more entrants to the market why would you disclose this
information.

Businesses don't need to be secret to be successful. That's a rationalization

Moody's, Symantec, etc, whatever you want to name have large sustainable
margins for a reason even if they are public. I am speaking of smaller private
companies with low costs of entry. Sometimes, a small private company can have
excellent margins in a real commodity business if the public is not aware of
the nitch. At least that is my impression.

Stocks don't yield 10% in a 2% divi environment

I understand your reservations about financials and know the comments you are
referring to from Buffett and Munger. But that is why you choose management
teams you trust. I hold WM and ALD. And of course BRKB. Return on equity is too

Re: Glassman article

I just have to comment on that one.

<<<Remember that prices are set not at random, but by the actual buying and
selling of thousands of investors, who rely on all the public information they
can glean.>>>

Did this fellow just fall off the turnip truck? The only certainty in the stock
market is randomness controlled by total anarchy. Most private investors
wouldn't recognize a 10Q if one came up and bit them on the leg. And while the
majority of stock analysts would probably recognize a 10Q, maybe 1 out of 4
might actually be able to understand the information they contain.

<<<An excellent place to start is the Value Line Investment Survey, which each
week lists stocks with the "widest discounts from book value.">>>

Seitel (SEI) was discussed here briefly a few months ago. Oddly enough Value
Line had recently issued a glowing report on the company and gave it their top
ranking. The stock has lost over 75% of its value since that report was issued.
A quick look at PHSY mentioned in the write up suggests a company at least as
bogus as Seitel. From the article:

<<<And this is a company that in 1999 earned $6.27 and continues to have a
powerful cash flow.>>>

The only problem is that the "powerful cash flow" appears to come exclusively
from issuing new debt on a regular basis. If earnings are so great, what keeps
happening to all the money? I know. They "reinvest it in the future growth of
the company". Poor Glassman is going to be horribly upset when he finds out the
truth about cash flow, Santa and the Tooth Fairy.

NPK might represent some kind of value, but it's hard saying what kind. 7 years
ago the stock was trading around $30. Today the stock is trading around $30.
The dividend yield is approximately what one would expect from a FDIC insured
money market account. What's the point of accepting stock market exposure for
money market returns? NPK might play well as a slow moving rolling stock, but I
don't see a lot of upside potential in a company that is only able to show $6
million in profits on $1.2 billion in sales. Not to mention that buying near,
or at, the top of the chart can hardly be considered "bottom fishing".

Glassman looks to be the classic example of the old saw, that, "He who attempts
to appear wise among fools is himself considered foolish among those who are
wise.". In his case a person would only have to be wise enough to recognize cow
manure when they step in it.

From:Don Earl
<<<What do the shorts know that we don't know?>>>

I took a quick look at the last 10Q, and ALD looks kind of twisty. I'm not a
big fan of seeing preferred outstanding as it usually turns out to be debt that
doesn't go on the balance sheet as debt. In the case of ALD, it looks like an
extra $80 million worth. It also looks like there's about $200 million in notes
being counted as assets which they are not receiving payments on. A big chunk
of their assets are in junk bonds. The majority of their assets are
unregistered securities which don't have an active market, and are valued at
management's "estimates". There's a ton of debt coming due over the next few
years and it looks like their favorite way to raise cash is to dump a lot of
stock.

I'm not convinced it's the perfect short play, but there are enough red flags
where even a little bit of DD suggests it's a good one to avoid for anything
long term. The yield is attractive, but the assets look flaky.

Companies with reasonably clean balance sheets tend to have fairly brief
quarterly reports. When you see a 10Q the size of a full length novel, it
suggests the company is attempting to bury the bodies in a paper storm. IF/when
the class action attorneys show up, the company proudly points to the filings
and tells them "it" was fully disclosed on page 487. Reading a Yahoo profile is
NOT due diligence. All publicly held companies should be considered guilty
unless the SEC filings give them a clean bill of health. ALD doesn't pass the
smell test.

The short money is almost always right. The short money is also almost always
early.

I seem to recall seeing a trading strategy mentioned where the idea is to go
long on high yield stocks just long enough to be a shareholder of record for
the dividend, then bail. If I'm not mistaken, there is or was a message board
devoted to the topic someplace on SI. I've never tried it myself, but the
theory sounded interesting. ALD might be worth tracking to see if that kind of
approach would work on it.

Nice going on GSB, Grommit.

I had been following that one for the last week, after I picked up a NYT Sunday
Business article (from late Jan '02), which I had previously put aside, in
which the investment firm interviewed reported that they liked GSB because GSB
said it would do something to enhance its value, like put itself up for sale.
Stock was then about 27. Didn't buy then, didn't buy last week. So it goes.

Clarification: I said I was close to buying CEGE. I didn't buy then, and the
price moved up a bit. I have come in though by starting exploratory position
@14+ area.

FWIW, I'm buying CYGN, which has developed a glucose monitoring system that
maybe might be successful and profitable.
(I wouldn't call CYGN a value investment.)

Also, today I added to my small SGP position.

I don't see any great values anywhere right now - banks or financials or not. I
still hold all the banks/financials I've mentioned here previously. I notice
I've not mentioned PFBI before. I own this thing.

ALD Sold on negative Greenberg article: Not because the substance was so

article will interest other shorts. I'm gonna stand aside and see how this
shakes out. The essence of the issue Greenberg brought out is that the omission
of auditor language, "We have reviewed the procedures used by the board of
directors in arriving at its estimate of value of such investments and have
inspected the underlying documentation, and in the circumstances we believe the
procedures are reasonable and the documentation appropriate." is NOT mandated
by a rule change as ALD's Sweeney claimed on the CC. She indicates she was
following Andersen's guide. The concern implied is that the auditor isn't all
that confident in the valuation methods. Greenberg cited a previous firm where
such language changed that eventually blew up bigtime. This is reacting to a
whiff of smoke rather than waiting for the fire....but waiting for the fire
hasn't worked well for me recently so I'm going the other way. I'm out with a
modest profit...if it sells off, increasing the margin of safety, I'll probably

Cable television stocks look too beat up, imo.

Even though problems abound. Adelphia may not be the only family controlled
cable business where there's off-balance sheet items that come out to bite the
investor. I'm not able to understand the financials of this sector or the
continued lack of profits these companies exhibit. I will assume though that
cash flow will increase when big capital expenditures cease (if they ever do).

I'd like to bet this business will eventually come back into favor. For me, I
figure the best way to play it is to buy a package. To my losing position in
CHTR, I've now bought CVC, COX, and ICCI.

Hi all,

I've subjectmarked your board about two months ago and been a regular reader of
it since.

I've made some value investments in lowpriced techstocks over the last 18
months and all of them were succesful for an average profit of over 100%. (Be
sure, I lost a fair amount of money on other strategies also)

My strategy for buying them was mostly based on a serious discount to cash
assets, low price, small cap, no debt, low cashburn and business potential or a
catalyst of some kind.

MYPT (Mypoints.com - acquired)
TMNT (Telemate net ventures - acquired - presumably only for its cash)
NTPA (Netopia - takeover offer ran the price up, was canceled afterwards when
bidder's stockprice collapsed)
ABTL (Autobytel - turned EBITDA profitable)

I recently established a small position in OBAS at 2.35$ ( Optibase, active in
MPEG decoders for streaming media and video on demand, Israel based company
with operations all over the world, never recovered from the sep 11 panic drop,
no debt, trading at about 70% of cash, trimmed their operational cashburn down
to zero, significant rev's)

My rationale is that OBAS's cash (and absence of cashburn) provides a nice
cushion for the time being. Video on demand and highspeed streaming media is a
potential high growth field in the years to come and I would be very surprised
not to see this market heat up somewhere in the next years.
Any ideas anyone ?

I also own IDT as a value play (I came across IDT mid 2000 and today it is
about the only one left standing in the midst of the telco meltdown with no
debt, over 1B$ in the bank, growth and an impressive mgmt) Anyone holding this
one ?

I am also looking at cheap biotechs but I am not sure whether a discount to
cash is sufficient for a good investment decision in this field. At least some
of the companies are far from fully funded and will run out of money some day
without fresh capital. I want to do some more research before going in.

Hello, xdimitri. You asked about IDT: I've had a position since 1999. Recently
I've begun to take some profits in it (and IDTB). I agree that the potential is
still there for IDT. I bought most of my shares when (and because) they were
around cash value, and now that that's no longer true, I am not as willing to
hold as many shares.
----------

Nice moves in those cash-rich stocks you've bought. And it looks like OBAS, up
from your purchase price, still might be a buy for people looking for cash-rich
companies with potential.

Thanks for posting.

re. GAI: Xdimitri, I believe some of us might still have that one from 1999
when it was discussed here as a net-net or undervalued play. If I remember
correctly, it seems like the stock was about 4+ and then they announced a
special cash dividend of $1 (or more?) which popped the stock to 6 range. I
recall taking some profits then, but I held on to some shares also, which I've
still got.

I've been following GAI news announcements, but I didn't realize the cash level
is up to where it is now.

That makes the stock more attractive to me. I may add more to my small
position.

Some time ago I posted that EP in the low 30's seemed to be a reasonable value,
but EP seemed too difficult to analyze. In the low 20's, I'm not sure that you
need to analyze it.

Folks are worried that it could be an Enron. I would bet against that. If for
no other reason than the fact that MidAmerican chose them to buy 50% of their
CE Generation, LLP to maintain their status as a QF under PURPA. (The BOD is
composed 50:50 MEHC:EP)

EP owns a bunch of pipelines, including a big one to SoCal that accounts for
45% of the Natural Gas used there. Since ALL of the new electric generation in
CA is gasfired, they won't lack customers. ie, EP has/had a trading component,
but owns hard cash producing assets vs. Enron.

EP's treasurer just committed suicide, but this appears illness related.

If you believe their numbers EP has a cash flow of ~3.5X and a free cash flow
of ~8.5. Plus a dividend ~4%.

All the steak joints - low end to white tablecloth - seem to have moved up. I
missed out on STAR and RYAN, discussed here. As I recall, I bet on LNY in 1998
over STAR because seafood, being more perishable than steak, would be a more

EP is being sued by the state of California, along with Enron, etc. Governor
Davis may have his political future depending on the outcome of these lawsuits,
so he won't back down easily.

As to the merits of the suit, my feeling is that there is not much there. But
still, being bogged down in a lawsuit for many years, and probably paying a
heavy nuisance value settlement, is going to drag on EP I'd suppose.

IDA, utility with no nuclear power, warned of earnings today because of the
drought, and is down $7. If they keep the dividend, it would be yealding 7%. I
think they will keep the dividend at least a year, since they have had very
high pay-out ratio before, even over 100% I believe. If the drought continues,
though, it would be problematic. IDA has also been sued by California, but this
is probably not significant for them.

EP is NOT being sued by California as you post. The suit is against El Paso
Electric which has NO relationship to EP.

Red Davis may get elected because the Republicans are running Bill Simon who
appears to be a right wing wacko.

These lawsuits are problematic. At the time Davis was doing electric deals I
happened to be working on an electric generation/storage/transmission project.
Davis 'freaked' and behaved the way any rookie investor would. The 'old hands'
took advantage of his hysteria the way market makers will do. Pricing is all
screwed up via these contracts. I doubt that the lawsuits will be settled by
November. I don't think that Davis will push real hard because he behaved so
badly during the energy crunch, and he should want voters to forget.

What do you say about a governor who is able to blow a huge surplus by
subsidizing everyones electric bill? Today poor folks go hungry because they
kept my rates low. Sad. Very sad.

LauA, since you investigated EP, I am guessing you looked also at EPN. Do you

but then there's the higher dividend with the partners lp structure.

There are some EP asset sales to EPN.

With all the convoluted deals that have come out about energy companies, would
such sales be a concern to investors of either company?

About two months ago, EP made a "private purchase" of over 1.2M sh @$37+. Given
that EPN's stock is about $33+ now, maybe EPN is undervalued - if EP is a
knowledgeable, insider buyer making a pure investing decision (i.e. not
providing a perk to some company insider by relieving him/her of a large
unwanted EPN position).

spread, with an average of $1.84. At 4th Qtr's $0.46 EPS, times 4 that gives
$1.84, so it looks very possible. At a price of $21, that's a forward PE of
11.4.

They own & operate 61 restaurants and franchise around 20 additional. A couple

chance of stepping in multiple potholes are WM and BMY (I own neither). Just my
gut.

I hate to be a yield pig, but I am getting interested again in CMO, with a
yield of over 30%!! I sold a while back at about $25, it has retreated to below
$19 (granted with some big haircuts on ex dates). I don't foresee vast, rapid
fire increases in rates that would absolutely decimate earnings, the dividend,
and the stock. Nor do I think that the dividend will hold at these levels. In
this environment, were the dividend to be even cut in half, that's still a good
yield, and still above what the stock has historically yielded. Book value is
about $14.50, and current management has it a lot more together than the past
regime IMO.

Any owners or those familiar with the situation, comments appreciated.

MCsweet, regarding your ALPH, it doesn't look too bad. No debt and cash covers
burn, at current rate, for several years. Enough to see company through to a
turnaround maybe. I guess these consulting companies should be able to adjust
their p/l and balance sheets fairly easily by quickly reducing non-productive
assets - consultants who can't bill enough revenue because of lousy business
conditions.

I have trouble evaluating consulting companies in general because the valuable
assets are the consultants. I don't often do discounted cash flows, and with
the consulting business, making assumptions about the future seems to involve
risky assumptions about the types of expertise that will be in vogue in the
future. For example, the demand for consultants and consulting companies
regarding ISO registration or TQM or the self-directed work teams of the '80's
and '90's seems to have evaporated (based on my limited reading and
understanding); now maybe we are seeing sustained (?) diminished demand for
internet developers, or internet advisors.

I am trying to come up with a metric to quickly screen for possible consulting
companies that might be worth further investigating. What I am using for now is
the criterion of a price/sales ratio of 1.5. Anything under, I'll consider
looking closer. Over, and I'll want to see something special before I look
further. I'm doing this by guess - I have no empirical evidence to back up my
metric.

ALPH fits that metric.

One large cap that fits that I'm looking at is EDS. Their size means they can
tackle the big jobs that the smaller players might not have regarding breadth,
skills, and resources.

Anybody here have an another opinion to share regarding this subject or these
stocks?

CMO - The yield is too high to be sustainable, of course, and these guys have
more knowledge of the situation than you or I do. So I will let them be my
guide:
http://biz.yahoo.com/t/c/cmo.html

However, I've also been a yield pig for the past 2 years. But I do not hate to
admit it. First in traditional REITs, then in other high yielding securities.
Stocks like ALD, various preferred shares, and even a few utilities.

On utilities, if you're interested, I owned LNT earlier in the year and just
bought it back on Friday. There were/are (?) a few issues on allowable rate
increases but at this price I think it's factored in. I'll take a 7.7% yield
that looks sustainable, insiders are buying, and the stock has 15% to 20%
upside according to my sometimes defective crystal ball.

I also especially like ATG among other utilities.

I think INLD still looks like a steal at current levels. They're basically debt
free, with plenty of cash, and have moved up their projections of free cash
flow positive to before year end. Their most recent acquisition puts them in
the top spot in their market. To add a little icing to the cake, they'll also
be getting a $60 million tax refund due to some recent legislation. The stock
carries two "strong buy" recommendations which is unheard of in the under $5
category.

I've been watching this one since last year and so far they've been delivering
on their projections. The last bounce broke through resistance, which looks to
confirm the up trend. It has the flavor of being one of those stocks that
eventually gets pretty expensive, and so far seems to be bucking the down trend
in the rest of the market. It's one of the few stocks I like in a market where
I've mostly been playing put options. Nice returns this year on the Seitel
contracts I mentioned awhile back.

Grommit, I still have LNT. Maybe should have sold when it was higher, but I did
not. Am considering adding here as well though.

Looked at LAF. Seems too expensive to me. But I've been wrong all along on it.

Grommit, if you've gone for CAG, and you're looking for dividends...

(and I have and am)

now might be the time to review HNZ. 4% yield and dividend raised every year
since '67.

I have no HNZ position, but I'm considering starting one.

BNHN: Looks like it could be a viable performer, Grommit.

I'll pass on my idea of BUNZ -- too much negativity on Yahoo, and I'm leery of
restaurant stocks like BUNZ that are selling near lows now. Something's not
right. Every other restaurant chain (stock) I see (and I'm not implying I've
looked at them all - or even carefully) is trading closer to highs than to lows
- BUNZ is too much the exception.

Benihana (BNHN) has a stockholder base different from most chains. Institutions
(15, by my reference) own only 7.8% of the outstanding shares whereas in the
restaurant industry overall, institutions average over 50%. BNHN is closely
held, with insiders owning more than 5.6M shares of the 7.37M shares
outstanding. Maybe institutions can't get a big enough slice of the company, so
that's eliminated a source of demand, hence kept the stock price relatively
low.
(??)

Looking at some metrics, BNHN does look inexpensive compared to other
restaurant stocks. On the other hand, looking at BNHN's p/e, p/sales - those
are on the high end of BNHN's past years' averages. Which is reasonable or okay
by me if BNHN's earnings increase next year as analysts predict.

BNHN - so different from burgers/fried chicken/tacos/red lobsters/pasta
palaces/sandwiches - looks a little too specialized to me. OTOH (I have a lot
of hands here -g-), it's selling at a value or "riskiness impression" no worse
than many other restaurant stocks when I bought them. (And now that some have
seen multiple expansions, there might be more risk just in holding them than in
making purchase of BNHN.)

If I don't get discouraged or distracted by a crashing market on Monday, I'll
likely take an exploratory position in BNHN.

Thanks,

Paul Senior

HNZ and BNHN --

The fact that HNZ can squeeze out a 4% dividend is good, and their earnings
press release reads well in terms of growth plans with new products and
acquisitions. Having a growth story while paying a nice dividend, is
compelling. I wonder, however, how much upside there is to the price. At
$2.50-$2.70 EPS, their PE might be closer to "fair" than to "undervalued". And
their debt, ROE, and a few other ratios are cautionary flags. But there's
enough here for a good solid look. Thanks.

BNHN -- I also wondered about the low institution ownership. Even compared to
another lower mkt cap restaurant like DAB, BNHN is low. From this ort in their
last press, I think they imply that they'd like to increase the institutional
ownership. Which, if successful, would certainly be a booster-chair for the
stock price.
"We also successfully raised new equity capital, which, in addition to
increasing market liquidity for our shares, helped to further enhance our
already strong financial position."

regarding shoes: Any interest by anyone here regarding VANS at current low

Martin knight, acknowledging the very nice move in SHOO that began after you
mentioned it here. Sorry I could not see to buy.

For comparisons, here are some shoe stocks that have previously been discussed
here (if memory serves):

OTOTOT: Classic Radio

I have a few close posters on this thread. I thought I would post a link to a
regular Harry Nile site. Harry is a private eye, based in the '40s/'50s -- in
Seattle, WA. Living in Seattle for awhile -- and this is where the show is
produced -- I grew to like the show. For anybody out there who likes private
eyes, mystery radio, etc., it is an interesting radio program show. There are
weekly programs -- not all Henry Nile.
