I suppose you can draw some interesting conclusions from the report, a few with
a positive spin when compared to the same qtr. last year. Personally I haven't
bitten on this yet, although I think it has some potential, given more time. So
for me, it's a stock on watch and will likely remain so for at least another
qtr. The real value probably lies in buying it down here, but I decided to wait
a bit. In short I'm a chicken. Stockholder's equity decreased this last quarter
by about 130 million, so from my perspective there was a little balance sheet
deterioration. Not including the intangibles it decreased from 1,488,711 to
1,358,928. That's still a tidy some on a per share basis, and yet the bulk of
decline was due to less inventory owned, which is probably a good thing. Orders
were up as opposed to a year ago, and this is a very good company with good
management from what I know about them. I think they will come out of this OK
and it appears they are really focusing on strategic regional markets now. My
problem with an investment here just now is that the macroeconomics of the
entire industry will take a good while to improve. The stock appears to have
discounted the worst already, but I think its gonna be a long wait for real
positives to surface.

I don't mind a long(ish) wait. I do think that risks are still there, even
though they have been somewhat alleviated. I listened to the conference call
and management does sound like they should come out of it without BK. But then
they still have joint ventures and bad things may happen there. They also may
do something stupid... not because they are idiots, but because they may make
mistaken assumptions. E.g. they are talking about paying off 2008 notes by cash
flow before they are due. But the notes are very cheap now, so they might buy
them off by using revolving credit line. Which is good if it works, but what if
they need that revolving credit for other purposes? It's easy to make a misstep
in such bad situation and the punishment is rather harsh.

So yeah, I hold, but I may play short term volatility to decrease my share cost
and/or shift into ITB. I believe SPF is interesting play, but it is risky. :)

Hi Paul - thanks for your kind words. One of my picks posted on SI (Trefoil
Inc., symbol TREF.OL) has gone nowhere for 1 year; it is actually down 10%
since I recommended it here. I am still holding it as I think they will
increase production in Q4, be assigned better reserves in Jan 08, and/or taken
over by a bigger entity.

Too bad you did not follow me on BPHX. I recommended it below 12 and is above
20 today after a great earnings report.

Regarding HNR, Jefferies out this AM with a BUY reco:

Event
Harvest received final approval in the "conversion" to a mixed company. As a
result, we are raising our rating to Buy and price target to $17 from $11.

Key Points
• Upgrading shares and raising price target...upgrading shares to Buy from Hold
and raising price target to $17 per share from $11. Conversion clears the way
for renewed investment in Venezuela. Drilling set to commence in Q4 and
production should respond. We have not considered potential returns from
diversification efforts being vigorously pursued in our price target.
• Risky? Sure, but less than thought...unlike most E&P companies, Harvest will
generate free cash flows denominated
largely in $US. The ~ $4 per share of cash (assuming recovery of receivable)
will rise through the life of the program. In contrast, most domestic E&P
companies are based on reserve valuation rather than scarce free cash flows.
Harvest should be able to meet our growth assumptions while generating these
cash flows.
• Remaining steps to renewed development concludes in Q4.
1) oil and gas sales agreement should be signed imminently,
2) PDVSA will be invoiced within weeks,
3) 1st workover rigs should be on-location in Q4; in Q1'08 another workover rig
and 1st drilling rig (750 hp) will arrive; 2 more drilling rigs still going
through bidding/selection process.

Valuation/Risks
Our price target of $17 is based on proved and probable reserves and a price
deck of $66 per barrel of oil and $1.54 per mcf natural gas. Our prior $11
target assumed proved reserves only. We believe investors will recognize 2P
reserves as drilling and a 3D seismic program commences in fields with
historical production. Proved reserves are worth $8.40 per share + $4 of
probable value + $4-$5 of cash and investments. Primary risks are: 1)
political, 2) currency, 3) contractual stability, and 4) unavailability of
rigs.

GNW,

I may do an about face on this one. Still seems like a good value, but I
noticed an analyst who was covering it mentioned his surprise at the lack of
subprime writedowns and the occurrence of some one-time gains in the quarter.

I thought this quarter would have been a great quarter to writedown subprime
and get it out of the system. Since it appears there is potential for this to
be a problem later, I'd be a little less aggressive buying GNW right now.

The negative is that insiders have sold shares in the mid fifties and overall
YOY revenue growth is low compared to its competitors.

My portfolio is lite on health care stocks so this purchase allows me to add
new money into this sector. The value proposition is that over the next 24
months, I believe the health care sector should outperform the S&P and UNH
specifically should trade at prices more closely to its pears. My price target

Added more shares to my Intel (INTC) position at current levels. I was
motivated to buy more based on this recent article that describes their next
generation chips that go into production later this year.
http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/oct07/5553
From the article"...In January 2007, Intel made the first working 45-nm
micro&#173;processors using these revolutionary high-k plus metal gate
transistors. One was the Penryn dual-core microprocessor, which has 410 million
transistors. Different versions of Penryn will be optimized for mobile,
desktop, workstation, and server applications. The quad-core version of this
product will have 820 million transistors. Penryn was followed a few months
later by Silverthorne, a single-core microprocessor with 47 million transistors
that is designed for low-power applications, including mobile Internet devices
and ultramobile PCs. There are more than 15 new chips under development at
Intel using our new technology. Production of Penryn and Silverthorne will
start later this year at Intel plants in Oregon and Arizona. Next year, we'll
start up the process at two other high-volume manufacturing fabs, in New Mexico
and Israel....".

Their new design leap frogs the industry, utilize much lower power (which runs
cooler) and increases their lead over AMD. Apple now uses their chips in their
new line of IMAC PC's so overall (Global) demand should be quite good looking
forward for the next 24 months.

The stock is selling at a forward PE of 17 and pays a pretty good dividend at
1.7%. http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=INTC
Stock should approach it's previous five year high of $36 and could go even

I am interested in some more motivation why INTC is a good investment. Their
ROE is boggled in 15% even counting optimistically. At that ROE, their expected
return at current market cap is like 7% annual, which is low.

Going forward the CapEx is going to continue to cost a lot. The benefits of
their new chips post-"frequency-wall" are not clear to users OR professionals.
I read what you say about Penryn and it does nothing to excite me. If anyone
asked me about purchasing new computer, processor brand or subbrand (Penryn
what?) would be the almost non-consideration: who cares? (Memory and video
cards for gamers are probably the only two things worth thinking about anymore.
And Vista vs XP vs Apple. Everything else is so whatever...)

Yes, they have beaten AMD again this year somehow according to financial
results. But is it a real lead? Does anybody care? AMD now has ATI (while
Nvidia is flying superhigh), while Intel has what?

The positive is that INTC is still the head of huge duopoly market that no one
else is planning to enter. I am not sure what's the long term picture though.
BTW, almost all INTCs side ventures into other markets seem to have been
unsuccessful.

Maybe I am being devil's advocate here, but tell me, where's the BIG BEEF? :)

Hi Jurgis - I believe Intel will beat the S&P over the next 36 months and could
do much better with several new products to be released in 2008 & 2009. The new
low power microprocessors are a big deal especially in the big enterprise
server farms where heat and power are an issue. Intel is also a leader in the
development of the emerging new WI-MAX technology.

Shrinking devices key to Intel WiMax vision
(http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/01/17/HNintelshrinkingdevices_1.html )

My motivation for my purchase is based on the Global reach that Intel has and
the increased productivity their products and technology provide. It is amazing
the historical margins they can sustain for such a large company (between
48%-55%).

I have done quite well with Nokia over the last 36 months and wanted to buy a
company that would complement Nokia's proven success.

Intel, Nokia team up on WiMax (http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=6414 )

I believe Intel will play a much larger role in the wireless smart phone market
(integrating Wi-Max and their low power mobile processors). Their products will
be cost effective in a growing global market especially if the U.S. dollar
continues to fall. The areas where Wi-Max is planned to be deployed first are
Brazil, India & China, all huge growth markets. Many of these users will
purchase a smart phone that includes one of Intel's low powered mobile
processors integrated with their Wi-Max chip set.

My position is quite small (less than 1% of the portfolio) but provides me good
diversification into the tech sector. Intel is much safer than a similar
position in a small cap tech stock. Part of my value proposition is that Intel
has very little debt, pays a 1.8% dividend and is ready to enter a new product
cycle that should result in annual revenue growth of 15%-20% per year for
several years. (Part of this growth is due to a falling U.S. dollar).

Finally, management continues to implement its productivity restructuring
program to reduce their costs. They plan to cut 2,000 more positions by the end
of the year. The cuts will bring headcount to about 86,000 by the end of 2007,
compared to 94,000 in 2006. That's just under a 10% reduction in head count.

My WAG is $2.53/share and $85.2 Billion in gross revenues for FY 2009. This
assumes that revenue growth continues similar to last quarter (up 7.5%) and
continues through 2009 at a 15%-20% per year annual rate and gross margins
remain at a 50%-52% (accomplished with decreasing SG&A expenses and competitive
global product pricing based on a falling U.S. dollar), earnings per share in
2009 at $2.53 could justify a price of $50 at a 20PE (a 36 month time period).
Of course, I will be happy just to beat the S%P in three years however I can
justify a stock double in that amount of time too.

I don't have a strong opinion about WiMax. Might be a huge thing, might be a
non-event. Tough to say although I would lean towards it being a non-event or
taking much longer than techies expect. But you are right that you are getting
it more or less for free.

I think I would have bought MSFT in tech area if I wanted exposure rather than
INTC. With last week's runup in MSFT, it might be a bit late though. ;)

I offer you kudos for your selection of DRYS in which probably nonone else
participated. I think this must be the biggest percentage gainer posted on the
thread in the past 2 years. I dont think i ve ever seen a 15 bagger here
before. off a splendid
quarter i computed my CAGR for the 12 years that I have been an active
investor/speculator. it has been in the 15-16% range. Having said that I should
quell the implicit illusion that the gains have been steady. It was
characterized by one drop of 35% and one drop of 87% peak to trough. I wonder
how this compares with others experience?

Thank you Madharry - I originally purchased shares as a value opportunity when
the stock IPO'ed 18 months ago but when it lost half it's value, I was not sure
if I made the right decision.

If you search the thread for "Drys" you can review my posts and decisions on my
investment strategy. I doubled my position at $10 believing their fixed assets
(ie ships) were selling below book value and their divided at the time
generated good income while I waited for day rates to increase. Since that time
day rates increased from $87,000/day to $187,000/day and the company was making
fists full of money.

The CEO continues to leverage the company using large amount of debt to replace
their old ships with newer and larger ones and utilizes the spot market to
maximize their current revenues ( a risky strategy). The company has decreased
the average age of their fleet from 12 years to just under four years while
increasing their earnings eight fold. At the current day rates, their entire
fleet should be paid off in 36 months from their current cash flow.

I have peeled off shares at various prices to pull my seed money out and book a
healthy profit leaving 1/3 of my shares to run. Based on the current demand for
their ships and the limited supply of new ships entering the market, Drys could
be valued in the $250 range by the end of 2008, earning $25/share.

This is a once in a life time run for me but it helps as I have my share of
losers (ie WON) which offsets the huge gain. The key is to let your winners
run, try not to trade too much around your position and evaluate the potential
earnings prospects from time to time to validate that it is not a company
specific event but a sustaining industry growth trend. Buying more at the low
helped too.

Madharry, I believe that when there's a parabolic rise over a short time frame
during which a stock is discussed here, that rise is easily noticed. Made more
evident to everybody when the stock itself sells at an absolutely high price -
over $100/sh. for example.

There have been a number of stocks discussed here that people owned that went
on to become 15 baggers or more. These may not've been very noticeable (unless
you owned the stock -g-) because:

1. The rise has occurred over several years.
2. There's not a continuous stream of posts on the stock to keep readers aware
and informed of progress.
3. The stock has split several times. So harder to spot a 15x gain. Example:
somebody aware a a stock selling between $25 and $50 during the past 12 months,
maybe sees a double if stock's at $50. Not realizing unless looking at a 5-10
year chart, that the stock has historically done a few 2:1 splits when the
stock is up at at those high prices.
4. The company got acquired at a high stock price, and the buying company's
stock also performed well subsequently, or the buying company itself also
eventually got bought out. So it's difficult for an observer of the stock
market scene to see the success of the first company's stockholders (assuming
these holders kept shares they received of the acquiring company/companies).

Some areas that I'm aware of that have seen 15x gains over the life of the
thread are homebuilders, refiners,
maybe some healthcare, some tech stocks. (Madharry, you do not want me to
mention that fruitly-named stock again -gg-. (I've recently sold 1/3 of my stub
shares)). A few net-net or below-cash plays became tech stocks and once their
rise began, the ascent was very rapid. SINA and another Chinese portal cash
play were discussed here by somebody who wound up making a small fortune on
maybe a 30+ bagger.

I've yet to see here or experience a 100 bagger. (I still occasionally pull out
my '72 copy of T.W. Phelps' "100:1 in the Stock Market" for a little
motivational read.)

IEA May Show `Much Higher' Oil Price Assumption Next Week

Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- The International Energy Agency is likely to show ``much
higher'' oil price assumptions for 2030 in its World Energy Outlook next week,
compared with its previous view on long-term prices, the agency's chief
economist said. Should governments fail to limit oil demand growth or fail to
find alternative energy sources, especially in China, India and developed
nations, ``we may see price levels much higher than we conventionally believed
in the past,'' the IEA's Fatih Birol said today at the Oil & Money conference
in London. He said those assumptions will be reflected in the outlook. The
Paris-based agency, an energy adviser to 26 industrialized nations, will
publish the outlook on Nov. 7.

World oil output struggling, say Arab experts
Alex Lawler and Peg Mackey, Reuters

Leading figures from the Middle East oil industry added their voices on Tuesday
to those warning that the world is struggling to sustain rising oil production.
"There is a real problem -- that supply may not be possible to increase beyond
a certain level, say around 100 million barrels," Libya's National Oil
Corporation chairman Shokri Ghanem said at an industry conference. "The reason
is, in some countries production is going down and we are not discovering any
more of those huge oil wells that we used to discover in the Sixties or the
Fifties." Sadad al-Husseini was a key architect of Saudi Arabian energy
production policy for more than a decade whilst a top official at state oil
firm Saudi Aramco. He was even more pessimistic, saying world oil production
had already plateaued. "We are already three years into level production,"
Husseini also told the annual Oil & Money conference, a gathering of top
executives. (30 October 2007)

.............

Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Crude oil rose to a record $94.50 barrel in New York
after an Energy Department report showed that U.S. inventories fell to a
two-year low. Oil has advanced 15 percent this month. Stockpiles dropped 3.89
million barrels to 312.7 million barrels last week, the department said. It was
the lowest since October 2005. A 400,000 barrel gain was expected, according to
a Bloomberg News survey. Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for
New York futures, fell 17 percent. ``We've lost a lot of oil at a time when we
should be building supply for winter,'' said Phil Flynn, a senior trader at
Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. ``Nearly all the analysts expected inventories
to rise, making this an extremely bullish number.''

> A U.S. Energy Department report today is expected to say that crude oil
stockpiles rose 400,000 barrels last week, according to the median of 16
responses in the survey.
.................................................

...former head of Saudi Arabian exploration & production Sadad Al-Husseini told
the world that he now believes that the current level of world oil production
will likely never be exceeded. Al-Husseini's view coincides with that of T.
Boone Pickens, who stated at ASPO-USA's Houston conference that the world oil
production peaked in 2006. The 85 million barrels per day of liquids available
to the markets now is all we're ever going to get

Sadad I. Al-Husseini, an oil consultant and former executive at Aramco, Saudi
Arabia’s national oil company, gave a particularly chilling assessment of the
world’s oil outlook. The major oil-producing nations, he said, are inflating
their oil reserves by as much as 300 billion barrels. These amount to
hypothetical reserves that are “not delineated, not accessible and not
available for production.”

Mr al-Huseini did not specify which countries had inflated their reserves in
this fashion, but the number is strikingly similar to the size of reserve
additions recorded by OPEC members in the mid-1980s when countries were vying
for quota share, although no new discoveries had been made.

However he did go on to question the production potential of some Gulf states,
pointing out that 75% of Iranian production comes from mature fields that are
more than 50% depleted. “That is not sustainable. When you hear officials
saying production is going back up to up to over 5 million barrels [per day],
that is not do-able”. He also noted that the 38 giant fields in the Arabian
Gulf with reserves of over billion barrels each are on average 41% depleted.
“These are the fields that in many forecasts are supposed to crank up and
double production from the Gulf – again, very questionable”.

dont know if they insure all of the $70Billion or just a portion of them but I
could see them getting their equity reduced to the point where they are out of
business.
So i think that is a legitimate concern. I am particularly concerned about
California, where i think people have a huge amount of house relative to their
incomes and therefore they are much likely to walk away if their equity turns
negative. reading stuff they printed it sounds to me like they accepted the
agency AAA ratings too, which is an added concern. I am passing for now.
I heard RIVLIN on bnn . she was surprised that they cut rates given the gdp
numbr but believes they did it out of concern for the housing market and
because the market had priced it in already. I wonder now that they had the

Deals With Hedge Funds
May Be Helping Merrill
Delay Mortgage Losses
By SUSAN PULLIAM
November 2, 2007; Page A1

Merrill Lynch & Co., in a bid to slash its exposure to risky mortgage-backed
securities, has engaged in deals with hedge funds that may have been designed
to delay the day of reckoning on losses, people close to the situation said.

The transactions are among the issues likely to be examined by the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The SEC is looking into how the Wall Street firm has
been valuing, or "marking," its mortgage securities and how it has disclosed
its positions to investors, a person familiar with the probe said. Regulators
are scrutinizing whether Merrill knew its mortgage-related problem was bigger
than what it indicated to investors throughout the summer.

SCRAMBLING BULL

• The Issue: Merrill Lynch & Co. has been off-loading some of its
mortgage-related assets to hedge funds as part of an effort to cap its
exposures.
• Backdrop: Merrill's mortgage assets fueled a $7.9 billion third-quarter
write-down, leading to the forced retirement on Tuesday of Chief Executive Stan
O'Neal.
• Regulatory Question: Did some of Merrill's recent mortgage asset sales
effectively postpone the reckoning for some write-downs?In one deal, a hedge
fund bought $1 billion in commercial paper issued by a Merrill-related entity
containing mortgages, a person close to the situation said. In exchange, the
hedge fund had the right to sell back the commercial paper to Merrill itself
after one year for a guaranteed minimum return, this person said.

While the Merrill-related entity's assets and liabilities weren't on Merrill's
own balance sheet, Merrill might have been required to take a write-down if the
entity was unable to sell the commercial paper to other investors and suffered
losses, the person said. The deal delayed that risk for a year, the person
said.

In a statement, a Merrill Lynch spokeswoman said, "We don't comment on specific
transactions and we are confident in the appropriateness of our marks."

At issue with any hedge-fund deals is whether there was an attempt by Merrill
to sweep problems under the rug through private transactions kept out of view
from investors. Some previous scandals, such as the collapse of Enron Corp. and
the troubles of Japan's financial system in the 1990s, involved efforts to hide
problems through off-balance-sheet transactions.

Ground Zero

Merrill has become ground zero of mortgage problems in the U.S. Last week, the
firm announced a $7.9 billion write-down fueled by mortgage-related problems --
one of the largest known Wall Street losses in history -- after projecting just
a few weeks earlier that the write-down would be $4.5 billion. Merrill also
took a $463 million write-down, net of fees, for deal-related lending
commitments, bringing the firm's total third-quarter write-down to $8.4
billion.

A few days after the announcement, it ousted Stan O'Neal, its chief executive.
Some analysts and others say they expect Merrill to take additional write-downs
of roughly $4 billion in the fourth quarter.

The rapid widening of Merrill's losses has led investors to wonder whether
other banks and brokerages have a good grasp of their exposure to bad debt.
Bank shares fell sharply yesterday, contributing to a 2.6% fall in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average. Merrill's shares fell $3.83, or 5.8%, to $62.19 in 4
p.m. trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Merrill's deals have attracted the interest of some mortgage investors and
specialists.

Making the Rounds

"Merrill has been making the rounds asking hedge funds to engage in one-year
off-balance-sheet credit facilities," Janet Tavakoli, who consults for
investors about derivatives, told clients in a recent note. "One fund claimed
that Merrill was offering a floor return (set buy-back price)," she said in the
note, "so this risk would return to Merrill." Ms. Tavakoli said such
transactions would explain how Merrill's mortgage-related exposure dropped in
the third quarter.

In recent weeks, Merrill has been scrambling to line up hedge funds to take as
much as $5 billion in mortgage-related securities, people close to the
situation said, part of what Merrill executives refer to as a "mitigation
strategy." Under the strategy, which started earlier this year, Merrill has
tried several means of lowering the risk of its exposure to mortgage-backed
securities, these people say.

In accounting for such transactions, "the general guiding principle is whether
the benefits and risks of ownership were transferred," says Charles Niemeier,
former chief accountant for the SEC's enforcement division and now a director
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Legal questions can arise if
the seller retains some exposure to the risk of the assets losing value, and if
the deal is designed to disguise the picture of a business's financial health.

FROM THE ARCHIVE

• U.S. Investors Face an Age of Murky Pricing
10/12/07Jay Gould, a securities lawyer at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP,
says if a firm is unloading securities from its books "without a real
commercial purpose other than to create a value for pricing purposes, that can
be a problem."

Other big securities firms with mortgage-related losses have arranged similar
deals with hedge funds. As disclosed in a recent page-one article in The Wall
Street Journal, Bear Stearns Cos. sold $1 billion of risky mortgage loans to a
hedge fund under a one-year pact known as a "mandatory auction call." Bear
Stearns agreed to participate in an auction for the loans that provided the
hedge fund with a guaranteed minimum return.

Three big U.S. banks are assembling a group of financial institutions to create
an investment pool to buy some mortgage-related securities from "structured
investment vehicles" that are being forced to sell. That effort, which is
backed by the Treasury Department, has also led some investors to question
whether the goal is to delay the point at which banks recognize losses on
troubled assets. The banks say their aim is to forestall forced selling of the
assets.

In mid-July, before the credit crunch worsened, Merrill reported
better-than-expected earnings with little impact from exposure to
mortgage-backed securities. Asked about the firm's mortgage position on a call
with analysts, Merrill Chief Financial Officer Jeff Edwards said: "Proactive
aggressive risk management has put us in an exceptionally good position." Two
weeks later, Mr. O'Neal personally sent an email to Merrill employees assuring
them the firm had such risks well in hand.

Source of Problems

One source of problems was the First Franklin mortgage company, which Merrill
bought in December 2006. First Franklin catered to subprime, or less
credit-worthy, borrowers. Subprime loans have fallen sharply in value this year
due to rising default rates.

Another source was Merrill's underwriting of collateralized debt obligations,
which are securities backed by pools of assets including mortgages. Merrill
ranked No. 1 in the area from 2004 through 2006.

By the end of June 2007, Merrill had CDO exposure of $32.1 billion and a
subprime-mortgage exposure of $8.8 billion, totaling $40.9 billion. Much of the
CDO exposure was in triple-A rated "super senior" slices. These were supposed
to enjoy strong protection against defaults, but they began to decline steeply
in price in late July.

By the end of September, Merrill says it reduced such positions through sales,
hedges and write-downs to $15.2 billion of CDOs and $5.7 billion of subprime
mortgages, a total of $20.9 billion. The write-downs totaled $6.9 billion for
CDOs and $1 billion for subprime mortgages.

( I wonder how long this has been going on and whether these hedge funds have
been shorting merill and citi.

Now merill is acting like enron great. I wonder if it might not be a bad idea
to have a couple of weeks of cash lying around just in case the government has
to declare an extended bank holiday. )

interesting article from august about cfc here:

(what i found especially interesting is that the CEO in the past 20 years has
sold over $400 million of stock. what he had retained was worth $29million as
of the date of the article, i also hear that cfc is giving great cd rates on
for 9 months. I just dont the rules when the fdic takes over a bank. do they
guaranty the interest too or just the principal?

In one deal, a hedge fund bought $1 billion in commercial paper issued by a
Merrill-related entity containing mortgages, a person close to the situation
said. In exchange, the hedge fund had the right to sell back the commercial
paper to Merrill itself after one year for a guaranteed minimum return, this
person said.

That sounds startlingly similar to the Enron barge deal. I guess being able to
win on appeal is the standard for acceptable practices on Wall Street.

I agree with your comments about RAS and am not interested in buying any of the
financial bargains out there. Another WSJ article summed up the current
situation with some more realistic, in my opinion, on when housing declines
will end. Buying opportunity? How about December of 2009?

In CDOs, risk is portioned out to different groups of investors. Those willing
to take the biggest risks buy securities with the highest potential returns,
while investors who want more safety give up some return to get it. Already,
the riskier "tranches" of CDOs have sunk dramatically in value. An index that
tracks risky subprime bonds has fallen to a record low of 17.4 cents on the
dollar, down 50% from August, according to Markit Group.

That decline, while worrisome, hit investors willing to take risk. But the
recent turmoil stems from declines in the market for the safest securities.
Rated triple-A, they should be affected by mortgage defaults only in extreme
circumstances. An index that tracks triple-A securities is trading at 79 cents
on the dollar, down from roughly 95 cents just a month ago.

At the top are "super-senior tranches." It is a decline in value of these
supposedly safe securities that is hurting many banks and brokerage firms.
Because banks must value many of their securities holdings at the price at
which they could be sold -- called marking to market -- many banks have had to
report losses.

In October alone, Moody's Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard &
Poor's downgraded or put on watch for downgrade more than $100 billion in CDOs
and the mortgage securities they contain. In a glimpse of how much banks have
at stake, UBS holds more than $20 billion of super-senior tranches of CDOs.
They're among the reasons UBS, which reported a third-quarter loss of 830
million Swiss francs ($712.8 million), has warned that its investment bank is
likely to face further losses in the current quarter.

"There was some widespread miscalculation when it came to estimating the credit
risk and market risk of the super-senior tranches," notes Ralph Daloiso,
managing director of structured finance at Natixis, a French banking group.

Specialized funds known as structured investment vehicles, affiliated with
banks and independent managers, invested in the top-rated tranches of CDOs.
Banks set up the funds as a way to derive income from securities held off their
balance sheets. The SIVs borrowed money from outside investors by issuing
short-term and medium-term notes, then used the money to pay for the
securities. Now, though, investors' reluctance to lend to SIVs has raised
concerns that the funds -- which hold some $300 billion in assets -- could be
forced to sell en masse.

The SIVs are the focus of an effort by major banks to raise a rescue fund that
could reach up to $100 billion. The intent is to calm markets by buying good,
highly rated securities from the SIVs. But the fund is still weeks away from
coming into operation. And the deterioration of even the most highly rated
securities will make it increasingly difficult to differentiate between good
and bad investments.

The large Wall Street firms weren't alone in believing triple-A-rated debt
securities were safe. In the last few years, bond insurers such as MBIA Inc.
and Ambac Financial Group Inc., as well as financial guaranty units of American
International Group Inc., PMI Group Inc. and ACA Capital Holdings, aggressively
wrote insurance on super-senior tranches of CDOs that were backed mainly by
subprime mortgages. These companies effectively agreed to bear the risk of
losses on these securities.

Shares of Ambac and PMI yesterday fell 19.7% and 11%, respectively, and along
with MBIA hit new 52-week lows, on growing investor worry that they may need to
hold more capital against the risk they are insuring and could be hit with
sizable claims down the road.

Over the past two weeks, some of the insurers posted significant net losses for
the third quarter because of adjustments on credit derivatives they used to
provide insurance on the bonds. The bond insurers have said, however, that they
don't expect actual losses from the CDO tranches they have insured.

The Federal Reserve has said its recent rate cuts were designed in part to
forestall damage to the economy from "disruptions in financial markets."
Officials have acknowledged that credit-market conditions aren't back to normal
but believe they are improving.

Some gauges of financial health are sending mixed signals. One measure is the
difference between the expected federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans
between banks, and longer-term interbank rates, such as for three months at the
London interbank offered rate, or Libor. This gap has been narrowing. That
signals less hesitation by banks to lend for more than a few days. Still,
traders say hesitation has not disappeared, one sign of this being a low volume
of lending for three-month terms or longer.

The Fed's task of keeping the federal-funds rate close to its target has been
complicated by Europe-based banks, which have been driving the rate upward by
borrowing heavily during the early part of the U.S. trading session -- a sign
the banks are facing difficulty borrowing elsewhere. To keep the rate down, the
Fed must pump money into the market. Yesterday, for example, the Fed lent $41
billion to money-market dealers, the largest amount since the credit crisis
developed in early August. That amount, however, was roughly equal to the
amount of short-term loans coming due, and was thus not seen as a response to
new strains in the market.

When the Fed on Wednesday cut its target for the federal funds rate to 4.5%, it
said it saw risks to growth roughly in balance with risks of higher inflation.
That statement -- implying the Fed didn't expect to cut rates again -- prompted
investors to lower their odds of additional rate cuts. But Thursday, odds of
another rate cut shot up again in the wake of the stock market's fall. Futures
markets now perceive a December rate cut as slightly more likely than no
change.

A choppy stock market alone is not likely to be enough to get the Fed to ease
again. But the Fed would have to take into account the possibility the market
is signaling economic weakness to come.

One reason the markets are jumpy is that there's no sign of a turnaround in the
U.S. housing market, which has been weakening for some two years after a
frenetic boom in the first half of this decade that more than doubled prices in
some areas. Foreclosed homes, which lenders try to dump quickly, are adding to
what was already a glut of houses and condos on the market in much of the
country.

The number of detached single-family homes on the market is enough to last 10.2
months at the current sluggish sales rate, the highest since February 1988,
according to the National Association of Realtors.

In Florida's Miami-Dade County, the supply of condos is enough to last about 57
months at the current sales rate. An ad on Craigslist.org touts a beige stucco
home in Las Vegas with the headline: "Owner desperate -- need to sell asap!
easy terms."

Some economists think home prices won't start to recover before 2009 or 2010.
House prices, as measured by the S&P/Case-Shiller national index, are likely to
decline about 7% this year and a similar amount in 2008, contends Jan Hatzius,
chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. He expects a further small
decline in 2009.

"they dont expect actual losses from the CDO tranches they have insured"

As far as I know, the terms of the insurance agreements are not publicly stated
or else not easily found or understood for the various tranches.

1. What is a loss? What is an "actual loss?"

2. What is being insured? If there's a default, is it the principal that the
insurers are required to pay, or part of the principal (if the insurers have
offloaded some risk to reinsurers) ? And when - after x number of late
payments, at foreclosure, after foreclosure when the houses/commercial
properties are resold? Or is it only the payments on the mortgage that the
insurers have to come up with? If it's the payments, for how long are the
insurers on the hook? Some fixed number of years of principal/interest payments
- say ten years' worth, or is until the entire loan is paid off, what?

Regardless though, there's no comfort feeling for me with "they dont expect
actual losses from the CDO tranches they have insured" Sounds like denial of
the situation at worst, lying next worst, or gibberish-for-the-media at best.

If they've destroyed $1B in book value with their SIV/CDO or what ever junk

years) and sell at a better p/bk.

Just seems like company confessionals though START at a minimum of $1B and work

It's a cash-in-search of a business play. They are moving away from credit/cash

Roughly, looks like OPMR may still have a dollar or more in cash (per share)
and no ltd after deal is done. Enough to give them some opportunities to grow
their new business.

in about 16 months which is probably not unusual for the sector now. (Heck,

GNW,

Aside from potential subprime losses, the Citi analyst thinks their mortgage
insurance unit will be a drag on business for awhile and comps in that biz are
trading well below book, so GNW's overall low Price/Book is not totally out of
line.

I think ultimately you make money on this, but the rebound may not come so
quickly. I am tempted to buy some here, but will probably hold off for now.

I don't believe the correction in the commercial market will be as severe as in

Otoh, even if commercial lenders don't go bk., it doesn't mean the stocks of
