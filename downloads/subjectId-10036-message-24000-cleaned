Wallace Rivers. I'll put PDS on my watch list. I'm not too knowledgeable about
trusts as how to report trust income to IRS or best where to hold these stocks.
Any suggestions or links?
Because I take several small positions I try to avoid limited partnerships
where I would have to file several K1 forms to USA state/fed. Also with royalty
income, I don't want to have to file state tax in the state where the royalty
income comes from (i.e. Oklahoma for HGT) or watch for income limits in an IRA.
Trust stocks I don't know about.

I'm averaging down (read: adding to losses, -g-) in RCL: added a tad more

Bruwin, my comments relate to info. from interviews published on Mr. Greenblatt
and his book. I have not read the book (and won't until my library gets a copy:
I don't need a rationale for the methodology; I just need the screen (which is
freely available)).

He says he wrote the book for his kids who are teenagers or maybe younger.
Something simple that works and beats 'the market'.

Tackling the toughest problem first - when to sell - it seems reasonable to me
that for kids - and adults with little patience - an arbitrary, mechanical
holding period of 12 months should be enough to see profits or to move on. And
for this group -to be socially acceptable, to conform to current academic
wisdom, to be somewhat practical for kids and others who have a life - 25
stocks chosen over several months, mostly randomly from the screen, will be
okay, I guess. The premise is that the winning stocks among the 25 will do much
better than the losing stocks lose. And presuming that the kids aren't going to
delve into the financial reports, there WILL be losing stocks. Likely losing
stocks even if they do.

My opinion differs from yours and most everybody else's in that I believe 25
stocks is not diversified enough for the risks to be undertaken. Also, if there
is one great stock among 20-25 selections, then for me, I prefer to increase my
likelihood of finding one among such a bunch by buying more bunches (i.e. maybe
get 2 or maybe 3 great stocks in a basket of 50 or more stocks.

A $1M investment started 20 years ago has now grown to $836.M at 40% compounded

after about 10 years ought to be able to attract $100M (and maybe MUCH more).
That $100M has returned $2.89B now from 10 years ago. Greenblatt's firm takes 2

Nice pop in EBAY as you know, Spekulatius. I've put MXIM on my watch list now.
(I have a very very few shares of EBAY.)

Okay, based on a Ben Graham looksee neither stock qualifies as a value play.
Rather than focus on the balance sheet though, one might look at the income
statement. Kinda/sorta what "value investor" Bill Miller might be doing. In
that regard, some of these high p/e, high p/sales, high p/bk value companies
are growing their sales and and are able to take (as measured by profit margin)
money to the bottom line. Whether they can sustain this good business
performance though, one has to wonder. (For MXIM, those numbers look VERY good
for the past decade. But of course a very high p/sales to pay for those good
profit margins too.) I see EBAY as having a franchise. Others might argue we're
talking tech stocks, and one can be king-of-the-hill only for so long with any
of these. For me, based on how I look at these things - a formulaic approach -
I'm willing to pay the stock price (p/e) for the growth numbers I see. Few
shares only though.

Thanx for that Paul. Contrary to yourself I have, in fact, read the book after
it was brought to my attention. It may have been directed to those less
inclined to spend much time in in-depth, fundamental stock analysis, but,
ultimately, if a theory or methodology cannot achieve its primary objective,
then it’s not likely to "stand the test of time", wouldn’t you say ?
As previously mentioned, it’s my understanding that his method of analysis has
a lot going for it, but doesn’t encompass enough to be more concise and
reliable. But that’s JMO.

As is often the case, when it comes to personal methods of stock analysis,
often built up over a long period of time, there will generally be differing
opinions and conclusions. I suspect the question of "diversification" may be
one of them. Personally I’m not a great fan of the principle of
diversification, purely for the purpose of averting "risk".

The way I see it, if a company’s current financial state, as determined from
clearly definable areas within its financial statements, shows that it has what
it takes to be profitable and is providing value for shareholders, then, in the
medium to longer term, an investor must benefit. By adopting this process we
haven’t found it necessary to garner 25 to 50 stocks in order to increase the
likelihood of finding 2 or 3 great ones.
Needless to say, the 2 or 3 "great ones" don’t "fall off trees", so it takes a
fair amount of screening and homework before one uncovers them !

With regard to compounding $1m, or more, at 40% for 20 years and making several
billion dollars in the process, I believe the following should be borne in mind
....
Front line Fund Managers generally have millions of dollars at their disposal
to invest. As such, were they to uncover the quality of stocks that could
provide a return of 40%+ per annum, it’s not likely that those companies would
readily have enough traded volume to absorb purchases of many millions of
dollars.

Therefore it’s not uncommon that Fund Managers, traditionally, have to target
the Very Large Cap (VLC) stocks in order to be able to invest several millions
in a purchase. But as we know, a spread of these VLC’s are not usually likely
to give an ongoing return of 40%+ per year (in addition, were they to have made
a wrong choice, with many millions involved, they cannot retreat too quickly
without their relatively large stake further compounding the problem).

Conversely, were they to spend less on each purchase, but still have to buy a
greater number of stocks in order to spend their "allowance", then the 40%+
that some stocks may earn will, in all eventuality, be diluted by those poorer
performers.

This can be borne out by the fact that, on average, over a period of several
years, the more successful Fund Managers don’t average much better than 15% to
20% return.
If, as you say, one defines Mr. Greenblatt as a "professional fund manager". I
suspect he could be faced with a similar predicament.

On the other hand, the individual investor would not necessarily be faced with
the aspect of sufficient traded volume. His/her $50000, $100000 or whatever,
"investing allowance", wouldn’t cause a ripple in the grand scheme of things.
Therefore, should one uncover 2 or 3 "great ones", there should be no reason
why 40%+ per annum could not be achieved on a reasonably regular basis, using
sound fundamental analysis.

60%+ since they started up in the 80's. The reason for this is that the design

PVD , i checked PVD's annual reports going back a few years. I do not find much
evidence of high commissions. PVD charges a fee of 2.25% for contributions to
its pension funds. This is less than what many financial advisers of load fund
companies charge and it includes the life insurance premiums (the cost of those
runs at about 1% i think). I believe PVD lowered it's fee from 2.6% to the
current 2.25% in the late 90's or Y2000. PVD's earnings have been stagnant for
about 4 years and only recently they have started to increase again.
Chile's private pension system is generally considered a success.Of course all
this does not prevent a new government to change the rules in the regulated
business to the detriment of companies like PVD. However, i believe this is
already reflected in the recent decline from almost 30$ to 25.X since Bachelet
go elected. So far, I am not aware of any substantial changes and based on the
current fundamentals, I think we are looking at a stock with a PE of 8-9 and a

Management announced both their regular dividend ($0.45) and a special dividend

Even more interesting is that the company has already secured their minimum
revenue growth target for 2006 based on new long term management/lease
contracts signed this year. There is discussion that the company may expand
their financing activities into oil drilling rigs and container ships.

This stock appears to be at a bargain price as all of my previous purchases
have been at higher prices. I have been able to reduce my average cost by
selling covered calls and writing naked Puts while collecting the nice
dividend.

If the rumor deal for financing oil rigs is accomplished in late 2006 (or early

Seeing as you ask Marc, here’s my 5c worth based, primarily, on CTB’s last
Annual financial statement...

1) Quarterly and Annual Turnover up, BUT EBITDA down. Not a good sign if a
company can’t improve at this level.
2) LOTS of long term debt ... very high at 52% of Equity. What’s worse is it’s
costing CTB over $50mil., after tax, bearing in mind it’s already losing
-$9mil. at Bottom Line.
3) Negative pre-tax Return on Capital Employed.
4) Its latest Quarterly reflects the same negative qualities as (1) to (3).
Therefore things don’t appear to be improving.
5) Bearing in mind its current Bottom Line losses, it does surprise me that CTB
still continues to pay a Dividend. Maybe it has something to do with the
Director’s equity !

CTB. I've followed this one before. If I owned it now I'd keep it. (That'd be
me; others might cut their losses and move on.) Company generally goes against
better financed competitors. It's been profitable though for most of the past
ten years. P/sales is low. I say the company and stock will recover - but the
stock might recover from even lower levels -g-. Company seems to have problems
passing along high raw material costs. Eventually they will I presume, and the
earnings and/or stock will recover. Looks like lows in the stock over past
eight years were in 2000 and 2001 around high 9$ or low $10. I might add or buy
around those prices again if they are hit, and look for a cyclical recovery to
maybe $18-20 range.

Further, for me, it's mostly not been a good idea to carry the reasoning logic
a little further, which is: sell stock now, take losses, buy back stock if/when
it hits $10. That just doesn't seem to work (for me). I either miss it,
disparage buying, or otherwise don't get back in. So for me, I'd hold and just
add a bit more at lower price.

Of course all jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times.

BHS : Based on BHS’s last set of Quarterlies, which, after all, contain those
sort of financial facts upon which one can draw conclusions, we see that BHS is
reflecting virtually the same numbers that appeared in the same Quarter 12
months ago.
Everything above EBITDA is much the same.
Its chart, at the moment, is only about 12% different.

The question could be asked, "Is this a cyclical situation, or is it a
reflection of the current homebuilding and home buying market ?"
Based on its chart, if we go back 24 months we see that BHS’s price was much
the same as it is now. However, it fell back by over 32% in 6 to 7 months. The
opposite was the case 12 months ago, when its price climbed over 35%.

In the previous 3 Quarters, BHS’s Gross Revenue climbed by over 260% from
$152mil. to $558mil. Needless to say, this was reflected in its price movement.
In the present climate, can BHS repeat that performance ?

IMHO I suspect we may not see the same degree of upward price movement we had
in the last period. In this regard, I believe Interest Rates may be the main
culprit. Borrowed money is getting more expensive and this is impinging on the
home bond market, as well as in other areas of Credit.
Of course, time will tell.

In this regard, I see a fairly high long term debt ratio on BHS’s Balance
Sheet. This last cost them about 20% of EBITDA. I see their Interest Expense is
now zero. I wonder why that is ?
Should that "expense" return, it will certainly not enhance BHS’s current
Bottom Line.

IMO potential investors in BHS may want to regard the company’s next set of
Quarterly Results as very important, and also as being very informative and
incisive as to its future medium term prospects.

BHS owns land for houses. Primarily, houses in California, a state where home
demand is strong. That land is worth more than what it shows on the balance
sheet. However, if housing demand slows the value of land will of course
decline too.

It's not, imo (I could be wrong), a matter of whether debt exceeds or doesn't
exceed net worth as regards creditors. For creditors, it's a matter of can,
does, and will BHS pay its debt as specified by its loan agreements. I don't
know the specific covenants, but as long as BHS can pay its bills, I assume
creditors cannot subject the company to liquidation. You make a point though in
offering that BHS does a high d/e ratio, certainly higher than other
homebuilders, and that that could be a problem going forward.

For investors, it's a matter of the future probable trend of the business. Most
people seem to me to be seeing a bubble, and less demand for homes at current
prices, ergo, less profits ultimately for BHS and a lower stock price.
-------------------------------
If demand is indeed that weak and the future bleak or bleaker, then one may
ask, why hold any homebuilder? I have DHI. Here's a company with maybe 28 years
of increasing revenue and earnings. That may be the best record on the NYSE. It
sells at a p/e of 5+. Yes, the e in p/e could disappear, but the stock's
already near 12 month lows, and with a 28 year history, geez, I want to bet
that they can continue the streak or at least recover from an earnings drop. I
hold my shares. For me - and that's just me; others may vary - I figure if I'm
a value investor, I have to look at the numbers and results in front of me, and
weigh them more than the oh-my-gosh, it's so obvious -everybody says so- that
real estate sales are sliding , prices are coming down, and sales will be oh-so
scarce.

Of course, I could be very wrong. As I have been so many, many times. That's

2Penny, what you are showing is ShareHolder’s Interest (SHI) of $264.65mil. and
Long Term Liabilities (LTL) of $744.45mil., of which Long Term Debt (LTD) is
$691.4mil. As a matter of interest, the latest Balance Sheet of BHS shows SHI =
$279.5mil. and LTL = $724.5mil.

The fact that LTL is greater than SHI is not the full picture.
In this regard you may want to consider the Balance Sheet in the form of an
Equation. In the "old days" it was written as :-
SHI + LTL + Deferred Taxation = FA + CA – CL
i.e. Capital Employed = Employment of Capital,
where FA is Fixed Assets, CA is Current Assets and CL is Current Liabilities.
SHI is, in fact, Share Capital + Reserves.
These days the USA, and others (not the United Kingdom), use the following :-
SHI + LTL + DT + CL = FA + CA.

The one advantage of putting the Balance Sheet into the form of an equation is
it enables one to do a bit of mathematical "juggling", as one side of an
equation must always equal the other. So we can then have :-

SHI + DT = FA + CA – LTL – CL
SHI + DT = (FA + CA) – (LTL + CL) .... (A)
SHI + DT = TOTAL ASSETS – TOTAL LIABILITIES.

Therefore a company is in REAL trouble when the right hand side of this
equation is NEGATIVE, i.e. TOTAL LIABILITIES exceed TOTAL ASSETS. In other
words, it’s Technically Insolvent.
(According to Wikipedia, "In most jurisdictions, it is an offence under the
bankruptcy laws for a corporation to continue in business once it is
Insolvent")
If we put your numbers, from the Balance Sheet of the period you referred to,
back into equation (A) we would have :-
264.65 + 0 = (53.3 + 1276.6) - (744.45 + 320.8) = 1329.90 – 1065.25

So everything still "Balances" and BHS is still Solvent.

Like yourself, I’d also be "nervous" about this company. After all, Debt costs
money, and according to BHS’s Year End for 2003, its debt was costing it over
$33mil., before tax, bearing in mind that its Bottom Line was only $88mil.
However, in the last two periods, BHS is no longer showing an Interest Expense
on its Income Statement. I’m not sure why not. Maybe others can enlighten us.

Hi Spekulatius - You are probably right. I like WON because it is more of a
"pure" play in the media sector they service. If they can stabilize their
business, cut costs, and have some success in providing new services to new
customer platforms (Internet, mobile & PDA devises and cell phones), they could
grow their revenues again.

WON's dividend is a bit better than CBS but it probably will not survive if
management can not achieve new revenue growth in the future. My bet is that WON
may have a better than equal chance of fine tuning their media business model
to take advantage of the transitioning digital technology. Because the overall
revenues are much smaller for WON than for CBS, the marginal revenue
contributions from new digital media will have a bigger impact to WON's bottom
line than CBS's.

FWIW I do own a small position in CBS and believe any portfolio should have
some exposure to the media sector specifically in the distribution and content
creation areas.

It appears that DCNAQ (DANA Corp.) was a bargain at $0.66 on 3/6/06 and at
$1.62 when I posted my observation on 3/16/06. I see that it hit a new recovery
high of $3.10. I guess the lesson learned is to see if the risk/reward premium
has any value even if the speculative buy has a probability of becoming
worthless. Also, any speculative purchase would be a very small percentage of
the portfolio and the buyer should have a pre-planned exit strategy to at least
recover your initial seed money.

Still 300% in less than 3 months isn't too bad. Even at Vegas that's an
excellent return.

AUO as a "Value play" ?
Well, personally I'd be surprised.
Latest Annual and Quarterly Turnover has fallen off, and this has also been
reflected in a decline in Bottom Line profit. Operating Margin is down and TTM
pre-tax Return on Capital is only 10%.

According to the AUO link, we see a "5 Year expected PEG" of 1.21. Well, I
believe it’s difficult enough trying to project 1 Year ahead in most factors
related to stock markets, let alone 5 years !

In addition we see AUO’s Long Term Debt is currently 54% of Equity !! The fact
that this is not adversely affecting AUO's Income Statement is a puzzle to me.
Maybe others can explain why we don't see a greater "Interest Expense".

IMHO, for this stock to be a current "Value play", all of the above factors
should be reversed and the stock should be trading at a low P/E.
If a company cannot, currently, show above average numbers in specific areas of
its Financial Statements, as well as above average specific financial ratios,
then what might, or MIGHT NOT, happen in the future is surely a matter of
speculation, uncertainty and risk.

The fact that its share price has been moving sideways since July 2004 should
come as no surprise.
I can't imagine it will be that much different in the future, unless AUO's
fundamentals should warrant ongoing purchase of its stock by informed
investors.

I did not sell OSHC to make a macroeconomic bet against the US$. I simply
believe that RBS.L is a cheaper stocks and less vulnerable to higher short term
interest rates. The local thrift live on interest income and more specifically
on the spread between loans and deposits and are bound to suffer with the St
interest rates as high as they are now. RBS is cheap, has a diverse income
stream (Fee's, investments, loans, insurance) and as a large bank (operating in
GB, US, Europe and Asia) and subsequently can cope much better with diminishing
loan spreads.

I also believe that online/money market savings accounts could threaten the
ability of thrift's to collect cheap deposits in the future. That's a very long
term trend and not a reason to sell those stocks today or tomorrow.

Dividend keeps coming along every month.

"As of March 31, 2006, the Company owned 2,009 properties held in the core REIT
portfolio of which 97.7% percent were leased based on carrying value. The
weighted average remaining lease term of the Company's real estate investment
portfolio was approximately 10.6 years, with more than 80 percent of the
Company's lease expirations occurring after 2011."

The rents seem to be there. I just hope the div. continues as steady as in past

The US$ was very overvalued in 2002 relative to the Euro but since 2004 the
Euro/US$ remained more or less unchanged despite the recent losses. The trouble
with the US$ crash theory, is that the US$ has a pretty good buying power at
current exchange rates. If you don't believe me travel to Europe or Japan and
you will find that the US$ does not go very far there. On the other hand, the
US is quite cheap for visitors from these countries, so in my opinion the US$
is undervalued in this respect.

to be improving, they should benefit further in coming months

I have a good size position in CHK. I just bought some shares in pxd for the
following reasons:

1. repost from yahoo:

activity in late May. Let's try to think this through, and post your
well-thought-out and supported comments.

Open the link below to see that Mr. Sheffield (CEO) exercised options for
332,000 shares of pxd on 5/30. Also note that he transferred 5,000 shares of
phantom stock to pxd shares on 5/25. That's about $13.5 million worth of pxd
stock that he has converted to liquid assets. Could it be pre-sale house
cleaning, or is it just yet another in a string of perplexing coincidences
witnessed in the last few months?

Let's recap; in recently board-approved amendments, management/directors now
have insulated themselves personally from possible pxd shareholder litigation
against them; and a review of insider stock activity confirms a very consistent
pattern of feathering their own nests at the expense of their shareholders.
Then, add the 13 month failure to file a defense in the $1.2 billion lawsuit,
the recent drop in pxd share price resulting in a market cap decrease in the
approximate amount of that undefended lawsuit liabiliity, and the recent pxd
buyout rumors.

I can't read the fine print, but as Dan Rather said during Watergate; if it
looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck; you got a duck!!!

After reading the "Business Week " link below, what are your alls' thoughts
regarding a buyout of pxd by xto soon?

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1034316/000103835706000074/xslF345X02/ed
 ardoc.xml

2. the company is heavily owned by value funds such as southeastern.

3. I own lots of units in MOSH.OB which is the subject of the major lawsuit
against pxd alluded to by the yahoo poster.

As always do your own dilligence!

Also picked up a few more shares of QEE on the drop today. Golds continued
increase in dollar price seems inevitable to me as the dollar stops being the
international currency of choice.

I've been looking, but haven't stepped up yet. Always difficult to call the

I understand that Bill Wrigley Jr. is much more aggressive than his old man and
my sense is that he is quite entrepreneurial. They've recently moved into their

all I got a better (lower) price for the replacement shares at the slight cost

-gg-, just joking.

As I understand this: "will acquire 2.74 million shares and 242,500 options of
Class A common stock, representing all of the shares not held by the Shaker or
Muller families", the shares being bought are everybody's who are not Shaker or
Muller family. So the insider Shaker/Muller clan are offering to buy ALL the
float.

Dink company, shouldn't be any antitrust/legal impediments, and if deal goes,
it should close this year, I guess. (I hope in a few few months.)
$2---->$2.30 (less commissions). You can figure the expected return.

There are risks. I didn't see where the Shaker/Muller clan has obtained
financing. In rising interest rate environment, interest costs could maybe be a
deal breaker. I suspect though that they can get financing. (They finance
cars/they ought to be somewhat savvy in getting financing and making financial
decisions.) Stockholders are too minor to mount real opposition to the deal,
and it is a premium offer. So the deal will be done, imo.

However, I've been wrong several times on these things. These deals go well
until they don't. Get okay returns a few times, then one of these deals just
collapses and the stock plummets 50-60%, wiping out gains from previous deals.

I'm no expert on the company or the stock or the deal. Still, I'll take the bet
here.

Historically, it looks like you have two major sell-offs, not including the
current. The big question is will this look like the one in the 90s or the
correction in 2003/04. It appears, at first glance that the CEF becomes a buy
when the discount is narrowing. Of course, figuring that out is the trick.

Re: Timing-based adjustment,

I was two months early in lowering the risk on my portfolio - impossible (for
me at least) to perfectly time the market, but I did think caution was called
for.

It sound like some people, who who were and still are doing fabulously, could
have done a bit better by taking their risk down a notch as well.

I would just remind folks that risky assets are not cheap here. High yield and
emerging market bond spreads are still very tight, Russell 2k is still
overvalued in my view, and central banks are trying to take liquidity out of
the market.

I'm not advocating a move to cash, but I'd continue to tread carefully.

spek - i think ebay in the sub-$35 level is a good entry point - currently
$30.58 - the paypal product is absolutely a profit making machine & growing
every day - lots of reasons for ebay to go higher - i don't think google can
touch ebay - we'll see - in summary - i think ebay goes higher - but may have
to wait for earnings

On day's like today, it's important to remember that stocks are neither pieces
of paper or lottery ticket's but represent an ownership stake in a real
business. If one does not like this ownership stake any more because the chart
looks bad, one should not have bought in the first place.

As much as I like FMD, I sold half my position at the opening today. The two
day run-up in the stock price and the market sell-off prompted me to take some
money off the table in a non-taxable account.

A bit off topic, but my brother, who runs a public company says the hedge fund
managers that he has recently talked to are very negative going well into 07
because of high deficits and higher interest rates. So I agree with MCSweet
that this is a time to be cautious.
