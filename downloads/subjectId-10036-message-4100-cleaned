Paul (or anyone), are you aware of any simple ways to estimate the impact of
options issuance to employees on company valuation? How do they figure options
into EV/EBITDA analysis? I've always ignored this issue because it's so
complex, but I'm starting to think this is potentially a big mistake.

You've left out the cigar companies ... I'm averaging down on General Cigar
(MPP). You get low PEs, some likelihood of excellent growth, less liability
exposure.

What do you know about UST management? I thought the company had a good track
record ... but up until recently I haven't watched too closely.

jeffrey,

Re: TAIT and excess inventory. I agree that the inventory is a big question
mark, but in the company's reports it states that a large inventory is required
because buyers demand immediate delivery. Management downplays the risk posed
by inventory:

From the 10K
"Taitron's competitive edge is its ability to fill customer orders
immediately from stock held in inventory. Thus, management has structured
inventory levels in such a way as to poise the Company to take advantage of a
recovery in the discrete semiconductor market. At the same time, if the
market recovery is slow in taking place, inventory levels should not impose
an unwarranted financial burden on the Company's earnings."

On obsolesence:
"The discrete semiconductor products distributed by the Company are
mature products, used in a wide range of commercial and industrial products
and industries. As a result, the Company has never experienced any material
amounts of product obsolescence. The Company also attempts to control its
inventory risks by matching large customer orders with simultaneous orders to
suppliers. Nonetheless, the high levels of inventory carried by the Company
increase the risks of price fluctuations and product obsolescence."

The inventory is what scared me off of the stock, but management seems to
downplay these concerns. That the company has been consistently profitable
since 1994 (as far back as I have numbers) with net margins between 5% and 12%
seems to add credence to these statements.

Brendan Watt: I'll defer to the finance guys here for options. But I want to
add:

In my stockholder proxy statements, there seems to be a vote at some point for
approving executives or employees or (geez) directors options plans, I
invariably vote no. Let them buy stock same as rest of us. This (my voting)
does absolutely no good, but I feel better about it -g-.

I read somewhere that of the largest US companies there are only two that do
not award options. Buffett's of course, and I think (not sure and too late and
lazy to look up) Provident Insurance.

My three pet peeves regarding options are:
Options for directors. I detest that, especially if & when I own (purchased of
course) more shares than some of the directors.

Option plans that get changed to let the executives buy at lower prices because
the stock has tanked, and because the prior option plan had the exercise prices
at these higher levels.

Stock buybacks to fund option plans. That is my clue to be careful- that stock
options are or could be an important consideration in investing in the company.

Personally, I don't believe that the current warnings we seeing here (Crimi's
alert on this thread, his internet letter, Forbes headline story, etc.) are
significant for either value investors or growth investors.
We are talking about a "potential" problem -- only one of many "potential"
problems. Option issues will not derail the market IMO, nor do I think we need
to make any adjustments in the ways we currently evaluate growth or value
stocks. Of course, that's my opinion. Someone could say if I knew more about
such a danger, I'd be more careful or more thorough in my analyses. Maybe I
should be. But it certainly isn't making any difference to my performance now -
or to anyone else's as far as I can tell. Paul Senior

Well, with the debate on the Senate floor today,
I went and bet on tobacco.

The bill looks fairly hideous for cigarette
makers, especially with the provision that
nicotine addiction sans disease can be a basis
for liability, so I steered away from MO.
I just don't know what the impact can be.

Instead, I bought UST. It has been absolutely
slammed, and after comparison with the
similarly slammed SWR, felt that UST
was the way to go.

UST now offers a 6.4% divided, trades
at a PE of 10 and a P/Cash Flow of 6,
with ten years of share repurchases and
dividend increases at its back. Growth
is hard to see, but I don't see where it
is necessary at current prices. In any
case, long-term growth in the 7%
range appears attainable and is its
history. Debt is the most manageable
of all the tobacco companies at just
1/4 of equity. This is a business I would
like to own, so now I do. It just
bleeds cash. The stock goes ex-dividend
June 1. Lousy management aside, I love
a business that can thrive with lousy
management, and it's hard to find
a better definition of value IMO.

Physiologically, I see a harder path
for lawmakers determined to make
Skoal and Copenhagen the sins of the day.

This was for my personal account.
I also went and bought Telebras at 110
this am. It remains the cheapest
and most value-laden tech stock in the world
at these prices, IMO. St. Joe and
Deswell also made it in to round out
my favorite trio.

o Mike, where are you getting your coverage on the tobacco bill?

o Re: SWR v. MPP ... I believe MPP has less debt, and has better brands on the
large cigars. I'm following the conventional wisdom that the large cigars have
the long-term growth and that the oversupply of non-premium large cigars
depressing the volumes of the premium large cigars is a temporary inventory
correction thing.

o I'd rather buy UST's brands than Swisher's discount chewable tobacco. My
entry point is lower on UST because I'm concerned what might happen if the
dividend is cut in the uncertainty.

My tobacco bill coverage is just Reuters and
cable news - no better than anyone else.

I guess we see the oversupply two different ways.
Swisher's mass market business hasn't hardly
missed a beat - its problems are its
overinvestment in premium production
facilities at the wrong time. But looking
at the numbers I must say that MPP looks
better to me now. I hadn't looked at it
in a while, and I had the numbers wrong
on Swisher when I originally compared
the two.

Re: UST dividend cut, the market
is acting as if it expects one. Financially
strong equities don't often offer 6.4%
in an era of the 6% 30 year T-bond
without some expectation of a breakdown
built into the price. Given the
cash flow, low debt, capital access,
and history of buybacks and dividend
increases, I'm betting they won't cut it.
Even if they do, I'd take this stock with
a 5% yield easy.

I notice from your posts that you were
pretty pro-Adaptec at one time. Are
you still in it? It's on my watch list,

Wow, I just spent some time over at the

Gabelli has been helping himself to this stock -
last bought 15,000 shares at 15 1/2. And it
has been absolutely savaged over the last
weeks, now just under 11. The least debt
among the big three cigars, all recently

Evidently they own some land which has
a sizable contrbution to the book value

I haven't read the MPP Yahoo thread. I'm working my way through the threads on
stocks I own but there's so much c**p it takes forever.

By the way my options valuation question stemmed from my investment in Lonestar
Steakhouse (STAR). I made money on it without realizing (I hear) management
repriced its options ... this where the board is dominated by management. I
mention this because I see it on your www.sealpoint.com list. I have yet to
come up with a workable approach for estimating how much of a ceiling this
should be for the stock.

I'm VERY long Adaptec (although I sold half at $48). If I understood the
technology better I'd probably double down here. It's hard for me to understand
what SCSI's longevity is going to be. Without significant SCSI contribution,
Adaptec is not cheap in any sense. If it's a one or two quarter inventory blip,
ADPT is a great value. Adaptec management voices a lot of confidence in the
future of SCSI and that's enough for me to hold because I think fear has ruled
the stock recently.

things look on the up and up. Interesting to read
about their former drug smuggling employee suing
them for wrongful termination. Sheesh. But all in
all, not nearly the potential penny stock the burnt
investors over on Yahoo seem to believe. And with
Gabelli's purchase price some 45% north of here, that
makes me more comfortable. I think it would be
as ridiculously cheap as UST is now if/when it hits $9
based on a rough estimate of 10X minimum earnings.
This is a big capital expenditure year for them. Can
they settle into a lower-cost groove in the future?
At just about 1.5 times book, I hope even more disgusted

the strike prices of the options issued now are going to be lowered by the

Have initiated a small position in OEA. Lots not to like with this company--
controlled by founders sons, hard to estimate what ultimate market and/or
market share could be, price is still high on absolute basis for price/book and
price to sales. Looks to me like earnings interruption may be temporary
though--if it's caused primarily by manufacturing issues as some people are

and div's each of past few years. Stock price is trending down and near to it's

Shane, on another post you indicated you had a list of net nets from a year or

AAII data base which I will use to rank companies purely on basis of each
company's likely-hood for survival.(primarily financial but product risk also a
consideration). My theory is that for net nets trying to rationalize the future
is nearly impossible but rather some random event will cause some proportion of
these companies to perform well. Therefore simple survival is the only
selection criteria. Diversification using the topped rated probable survivors
should outperform the S&P if business failures can be eliminated. I want to do
this as a blind test(dont want to know successes so I wont peek at your other
posting). I will share the rankings (and criteria used) in approximate
quartiles along with price at time of AAII data base posting. Will be out of

My largest investment now is Morgan Stanley Asia Pacific Fund, a closed end. I
paid 7 1/2 for it a couple months ago. I figured Asia is about as contrarian as
I can be, and unlike a sick company, entire markets don't go to zero. In other
words, I didn't expect to catch the exact bottom, but I don't think I have to.
If Asia regains its footing sometime within a five year investment horizon, it
won't matter much whether I paid 5,6,7 or 8 for the shares.

Also, it has the sponsorship of Morgan Stanley and trades at a 18% discount to
its net asset value. In comparison, Asian country closed end funds trade at
crazy premiums to NAV. Its also a way to play Japan and the dregs of Southeast
Asia at the same time, since 40% of its investment is in the Japanese market.
The pure-play Japanese closed ends also trade at a premium to NAV.

It drifted down to 7, but then the signal to buy more was last week, when
rioting broke out in Indonesia, and APF only fell to 6 7/8. I didn't buy more
because it was not that far off of my basis, and because I bought a lot the
first time. But that is a classic sign of a bottom, when awful news doesn't do
much to the price. But it bounced off the bottom this week back to 7 1/8 and I
would guess it will be up a little more tomorrow with Suharto's resignation.

Not for me James. I wouldn't know what or why individual companies are actually
in the fund, who really manages this fund, or what capital gains or losses are
given to me or when. In addition to stock market risks and business risks, the
fund manager has to contend with currency risks. Nothing like making money on a
stock and losing it all back when it's translated to dollars -g-. The fact that
these Asia fund managers all seemed to have missed the Asian debacle does not
give me ANY reassurance that they know what they are doing with my monies.
Also, since these fund managers are paid by the amount they invest, there is a
very strong incentive for them to issue new fund shares so they can have more
funds under management. But in issuing new shares, they decrease the ownership
of current holders (unless current holders pony up money to exercise their
rights). This action drops the share price (when offering price is below share
price on announcement date). Not sure, but isn't MS well-known for pulling this
tactic?

Doesn't everyone believe these Tigers with their hard-working, well-educated,
disciplined and dedicated workforces will come back, and come back strong --
surely in five years time? Didn't you say that most people you know - the

Mike, I think RJR won't go bankrupt because it has current assets that exceed
or about equal current liabilities, and long term debt that is about equal to
equity. That's marginal, but the company has some pricing flexibility, so if
new taxes are levied, it can raise prices. But judging from the conflicts in
Congress this week, legislation won't pass and it will be back to business as
usual. Someone said that RN was losing to MO internationally, but it grew 15%

Ok, Paul, why AMP? I see a company that looks just about
perfectly valued. The 12 year uptrend in the stock price
remains intact, though I can't say that it's been stellar.
For long-term holders, it's been steady, and if you want
to buy into that I guess now might be a time. But I don't
see any reason for the PSR or PE to expand. Looks like
they mainly plan to grow by cutting costs and waiting for
Asia's troubles to pass. 50% US, 50% overseas business
mix. 3% dividend. Just looks perfectly valued to me. But I know
you have a hook, right?

Mike re: AMP. No, have no hook. PSR is high, that's true. But relative to its
recent past (6 years), it's at low end. Dividend yield is excellent (3%); AMP
is showing a buy signal based on relative dividend model I sometimes use to
value these large caps. Furthermore, rising dividends and increased sales
(that's assuming historical continuation of trend of course) indicate that that
price will be higher in a couple of years as either sales or psr, or both,
increase. Very consistent 15% ROE it seems.
In bull markets in the past, this stock has sold higher than current pe
multiple. That was then though, and this is now with lots more competition
(Molex, for example). I don't own the stock, but I am trying to weigh the
upside/downside possibilities. Paul

But communcation companies normally claim PSR of 3-5 with the 5-6% net profit

Speaking of components, Smart Modular crashed to 13ish today,
giving it a PSR of 0.75. Earnings today show gross margin up,
inventories and receivables down, sales up 45%. They've
been consistently doing well in a tough computer components
market. Today they trade at half their price 1 week ago.
Estimates are falling because of "uncertain" guidance over
the next two quarters. I guess my question is will sales
reverse from 40% growth to negative growth? Managment has

Smart Modular is losing biz to Asian competitors.

Their biggest customer is hurting (Compaq), they are losing sales to an Asian
competitor, Tanisys, and their profit margins are under pressure. Also the
growth in sales in the sub-zero PC segment will hurt SMOD as I believe these
PCs don't have the memory modules SMOD makes.

Lots of fundamental business reasons for SMOD fall, but the stock certainly has
a lot of the bad news priced in. I'd give it some time to settle out.

But what impresses is me is that despite

was no inventory bloat (inventories

I've made money on it, but am not currently in. APF also
seems smart given the discount compared to premia in other
Asian closed-ends, though it is good to worry about Morgan
Stanley's rights offerings. I have plenty of Asian exposure,
from too early, so I'm not keen to jump in, but I may exchange
some of my mild-premium Asian CEF's (FPF and JOF) for some if
the premia get too wild.

Notice you like St Joe (SJP).... do you believe the $32/share

Re: SJP

This is my notepad valuation that I did back

Realize that James Clarke here is the
expert on St. Joe. He sold his position because
in his opinion the easy money has been made.
I agree, but I feel that the downside is limited,
and that right now at $30, the stock
is a solid core buy for me.

Anyone looking at SJP now should really look
at FEC. In the opinion of many, FEC is
more undervalued now. This may be the
case, but I am interested in owning the
majority holder. As FEC's stock increases,
so does SJP's net asset value. The company
told me it is "very happy" having control
of FEC, and is not inclined to make another
offer for FEC. SJP had offered just over
100/share, which to me would have been
to good to be true, and it was rejected.

Re: the India Fund

It has performed better on a NAV value basis than the IGF over the last few
years. Net asset value as of March 31 was 8.75. The stock's now around 8 1/8. I
was looking for diversification into countries with low correlations with the
US market. Thanks to the 15 year US bull, you end up in just a few crummy
places, India being one of them. It's a country with serious problems. I happen
to work with a lot of people from India, and I talked to them extensively.
Basically, the new government is bad news and the banking system stinks. But
they have excellent schools. development is at a breakneck pace. Many of my
friends feel that the "next Silicon Valley" will be in one of certain cities in
India due to the relatively cheap but highly educated tech workers
there and the schools. The India Institue of Technology is one of the world's
premier graduate-level technology schools. There is an exploding middle class
according to the people I know. The middle class IMO is what creates stability.

In sum, I looked at the India Fund, thought I was getting it at a discount, and
figured it would be a&#255;good long-term investment I first checked that I
wasn't liable for any taxable capital gains distributions, which is one of the
first things I look for in CEF's.

I made one major mistake. I relied on http://www.trustnet.co.uk/data/ind00.html
for my discount info, since I didn't have any way of getting current NAV info.
DON'T do this. A lot of their data is in error. So in the high 8's I ended up
paying NAV. A subscription at http:/www.icefi.com may be worth it if I'll be
investing in CEF's, but I don't think I will too much due to the reasons Paul
mentioned.

Other countries I want to invest in - South Korea via the Korean Fund (my wife
is Korean and I can get info through her family), and Japan. In Korea, people
kill themselves if they don't get into the best schools. Like Japan, it is an
incredibly proud country, but IMO even more so. That pride got them into this
mess, but I can't imagine that they won't right themselves and come out much
much stronger.

The big risk in Korea is North Korea. If South Korea ends up having to bail out
North Korea when North Korea falls, South Korea will hurt.

Michael and James,

Why APF and not TDF?

http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=APF+TDF&d=5y

APF discount is larger than TDF (17% vs. 14%
on April 3, check for current one).
Expense ratios are similar. Holdings are APF 42% Japan,
TDF 70% Hong Kong. Turnover rates are similar and pretty
low (from Morningstar Mutual Fund Manual).

But historically TDF performed better than APF. I think
it's a faulty logic to buy a fund that went down
through its all carrier like a rock and to think that
it will rebound with the SEA countries. This logic holds
for WEBS but not for mutuals. Who can ensure that APF
management won't screw up and hold cash or some
Nepalese equity exactly when the recover in SEA and
Japan occurs? So, in case of Mutuals, management is
important unless you buy index funds. I believe that
James's reasons to buy were:

- Contrarian action to US.
- Discount to NAV.
- Belief that Morgan Stanley will "push" this fund.

I think that these reasons would apply to TDF
too and I am wondering whether discount and Japanese
exposure is worth lackluster management. BTW, I don't
think the fund holds net-nets of Japan. E.g. it has
Sony and Nintendo which are not exactly value
stocks.

I heard good things about Mark Mobius but haven't
read any of his own prospectuses. I get info from
Morgan Stanley, so I take their endorsement of APF
with a grain of salt.

On the philosophical note, I have trouble
investing in any fund that has lower asset value after 5 years.
Presumably, management should be able to figure out
ways to invest in any economic conditions and to hold
cash or something if there are no values. E.g. take a
look at TBGVX. It has good three year results even though
it's a global fund. I know that their success is partially
due to holding US bank stocks, but then US banks
were better bets than Japanese banks. :-)))

Good luck

Try calculating PSR looking forward.

The company did $181M this last Q, and in their press release, are forecasting
155M and 180M for the next two quarters. Assuming the next two Qs average
(which includes an historically weak quarter) is 180M, then forward 12 month
revenues are about $696M. The market cap at 14 is about 672M using a fully
diluted share count of 48M. A good forward looking PSR is about 0.97.

There are a slew of companies in the electronic contract manufacturing sector
selling at forward PSRs of about 0.50 to 0.60, that are less susceptible to
Asian competition. If you were sure that the market for SMOD's products will
heat up again, then the stock is attractive now. But given the weak pricing,
increasing competition, cautionary words from management, I wouldn't bet on
seeing historically high profit margins again. My guess is that the company
will earn about $1.00 over the next year on flat sales, and lowering margins.
Then we may see a company that grows 15% a year after that.

SMOD is a growth stock, that has seen the company's fast growth in its niche
market peak out. The last several quarters have shown decelerating growth, and
the next Q will see a substantial revenue decline. Just be careful this time
around- the market segment is much different than in mid-96 (two years ago).

They have problems, no doubt, but I'm buying it at sales,

screaming at daily price moves. No second guessing. Just sleep well, and hope
that contrarian/value investing actually works. The way I see it, I am making a

increase my position at lower prices.

Just keep telling yourself that entire markets do not go to zero. Read The Bear
Book again. Markets down 60% do get cut in half again, but eventually they come
back. Maybe not enough to make the guys who bought at the peak happy, or
probably not even enough to satisfy the idiot, sorry - investor, who "bought

"Anyone looking for the next big market moves has got to look
overseas," says Michael Landry, president of Ivy Mackenzie,
international investment specialists in Boca Raton, Florida. On
that point, at least, the dozens of money managers, financial
strategists, economists, and analysts in the United States,
Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa interviewed for this
story were in agreement. Not one of them said the U.S. would
deliver the world's highest total returns over the next one to three
years, if only because overseas markets have so much more
headroom. "

So of course to me, the contrarian bet is to bet on USA.

I am not saying an investment in Asia CEFs won't work out very well, and I'm
not saying the US will be better or worse. I'm just saying, betting on Asia is

about 2% of all institutional money pulled out due to redemptions.
In just 3 days. That explains to me at least why my big, liquid

What an ugly, vicious cycle you describe. If funds have to sell to meet
redemption requests, they forgo opportunities to pick up good values. Even
drive these good values to lower prices as they sell to meet more redemptions
requests - which seems to be occurring as people see prices go lower and lower.

Re: CDWC

I buy from CDW and Computability primarily. I am not sure that CDW

it being a new market with few competitors. The competition is heating
up. No doubt, CDW is one of the leaders, but I don't think the
business economics add up to any kind of guaranteed longevity and
sustainable high ROE.

So it's not a Buffett stock, IMO. Is it a value stock? Well, it's
still growing pretty significantly. Looks like a stock that has
been creamed, but both the industry and its leading position in that
industry will continue to increase sales. So the PSR's less than 0.7,
and sales are growing 30%. Turns its inventory 20 times/year. I
noticed that they are chronically out of stock of many products,
which limits next-day delivery, but allows easier inventory
management. As long as it doesn't turn the customer off - they lost
my Sony monitor buy because it wasn't in stock - and overall
it doesn't seem to.

I see a business that looks well-run, controlling costs, at the

struggling. Insight is the closest direct competitor I can find,
but it does nowhere near as well at controlling costs. That its
margins are less when it charges more for the same products is
also notable.

Then again, Insight's PSR is 0.4 and it's also growing, even
faster than CDW. It too turns its inventories >20 times.

I would think that an investment in CDW is a bet that it will
keep growing its sales and that it will maintain its margins, or
at least stay profitable while the others sink.
Looks like Wall Street is betting that slow PC demand will
crimp those margins and the growth as well. Still CDW is the
leader. Of all of em, I'd buy CDW because it looks like management
has been doing a good job and as Dell proved management in these
kinds of businesses may be everything. CompUSA just seems to
have the wrong model. Thanks for bringing it up. Goes on my

When I read the redemption numbers for Latin America - listed
on the same page as the inflow numbers for the US - it was
pretty shocking. The traders in Latin America keep saying that
it seems like the stocks only react to bad news, and that
sometimes the falls make no fundamental sense. What that tells
me is that you are having irrational redemptions from people
back here and elsewhere yanking money out of emerging markets
regardless of the specifics of the various countries. Telebras,
as the most liquid ADR for Brazil and a benchmark in both
Brazil and Latin America, sees its liquidity and size drive its
amazing volatility because of this, which is of course the
opposite of what you see in a flight-to-quality country like the

Mike,

Thanks for the comments on CDWC. Since you mentioned slow PC demand I
thought I'd post this as a follow up since this was a concern of mine also.
Desktop PCs only make up around 15% of their revenues, and I figure add-on
peripheral sales may compensate nearly fully for the drop in avg selling price.
Now a drop in laptop/notebook computer prices would be much more
significant IMO. I am unsure of the probability there, but have the feeling
that
it's coming at some point.

Asia. Whenever you want to debate whether something is contrarian or not, there
is an easy way to settle that:
1) Is the price down big. YES
2) Is coverage in the financial media overwhelmingly negative. YES

To go beyond that is splitting hairs. Sure there are smart investors buying
Asia. But look at the price movement. A lot of people have sold low and are
still selling. And of course they are not admitting it.

I lived in Asia for two years not that long ago. The price of these markets
kind of makes me want to go back just to make sure everything is still there.

Asia and Japan are in the tank, so it seems is much less important Russia. I
think the Fed will fall all over
itself to avoid raising rates. In fact, to paraphrase the first article, I
think it will tolerate a reduction in real rates by permitting increased
inflation. Does anyone really think they will be the agent of a US recession,

Jeffrey,

If the Fed increased interest rates, it would further strengthen the dollar
against other world currencies and likely precipitate the disaster you refer
to. If anything, the Fed must hold and should lower rates to benefit US
business because the US is looking at a sharp decline in exports. Every dollar
out is a dollar that doesn't circulate through the economy.

The ASEAN countries are in the tank and IMO Russia is on the edge, Japan is in
serious trouble. Only HK/China has any stability left and will likely lead any
recovery. Taiwan could have come out a winner, but they failed support currency
and are preventing companies from taking advantage of investment opportunities
outside of Taiwan.

I'm afraid of Russia. Some of the companies I've looked at are using some very
creative bookkeeping.

Hi,Allen:

The ROC fund is scheduled to have an annual meeting next week. One
item on the agenda is to vote on whether to turn the fund into an
open end one. For some reasons, I receieved notice from the broker
only about the meeting, but didn't received the proxy voting material.
Last week, when I checked, the fund had net asset value of US$9.65
compared to current market price of <US$7.50. In the past, the
manangement would sometimes reduce the number of shares outstanding
by purchasing the shares in the open market. In conclusion, I believe
that the shares is one of the few better managed Asian funds.

International market. US industry is trying to compete with export companies in
other countries that pay virtually no taxes and receive subsidies in addition

Clayton is a Buffett pick, not a Graham pick. The company is in the
manufactured housing business, a unique industry which takes some time to
understand. Hint - think beyond "trailers". And Clayton is the gem of the
industry. Over a decade of return on equity in the 17-20% range, through a
cycle. What is that worth? Considerably above book value, and considerably
above a "value" P/E ratio. The business trades at about 16 times earnings,
below its usual level, especially relative to the market. Using the model from
Buffetology, which Mike knows well, the stock is worth 25-28 in my estimation,
and trades at 18 and change.

The stock has been trading in a range for almost three years, though the growth
rate has continued to be 16%. If the growth keeps up, these growth stocks which
pause for a while tend to be huge winners. What you want to spend your time
researching is whether that growth rate can continue. I think it can. There is
nothing wrong with buying growth, as long as you're not paying for it.

This is not a net-net, but that's not the only game I play. I have owned this
for a year and a half and it has been good to me (my basis is about 13). Common
sense, frugal management with a long term track record. And Wall Street doesn't
get it - they think "manufactured housing? who would buy that when they can buy
a Toll Brothers home? I wouldn't buy that" Of course they wouldn't. And that's
why I have been able to steal companies like Clayton, Greyhound and Red Roof
Inns.

Don't shop where Wall Street shops.

This is a buying opportunity, but I'm not looking for a short term gain here.
This is one I will never pay taxes on as long as they keep being Clayton.

That's a pretty broad brush you are using to paint Wall Street's housing stocks
IMO. Looks to me like in the time period you describe, I can see no housing
stock that has failed to appreciate in price. Many can come close or surpass
the 50% performance of CMH. (Although I seem to own one that is up only 10%
-g-.) So IMO, good call and good advice by any Wall Street analyst who
recommended housing stocks 12-18 months ago.

And some of these stocks look like they still might have some room for
appreciation. UH for example still near book (per Yahoo). Perhaps HOV still in
the hot NJ market. We see a 3 point jump in Kaufman and Broad today attributed
to the hot CA market. (I own none of these stocks.)

Regarding suppliers to non-stick home builders, KVCO is too expensive IMO. PATK
might be okay, but it has offered better buy in points. As discussed here on
earlier posts, although CMH has their own finance arm (a big advantage compared
to independent manufacturers and/or dealers and a big profit center for CMH), I
have been partial to Greentree.

Can't argue though with long term success of CMH under Mr. Clayton's

Offshore, Inc. Rights Offering May 28, 1998 8:18 PM EDT

HOUSTON, May 28 /PRNewswire/ -- DeepTech International Inc. ("DeepTech")
(Nasdaq: DEEP) announced today that June 12, 1998 has been set as the record
date (the "Record Date") for its planned distribution (the "Rights Offering")
to DeepTech stockholders of rights (the "Rights") to acquire the stock issued
by Tatham Offshore, Inc. and held by DeepTech. The Rights will be distributed
to stockholders as of the Record Date upon receipt of all necessary consents
and government approvals, including lender consents and the Securities and
Exchange Commission's authorization of the effectiveness of the related
registration statement. The Rights will expire and the Rights Offering will
close on a date to be determined by DeepTech. In no event shall such date be
later than the earlier of 50 days after the Rights are distributed or September
30, 1998.

DeepTech is a diversified energy company primarily engaged, through its
operating subsidiaries, in offshore contract drilling services and the
acquisition, development, production, processing, transportation and marketing
of, and the exploration for, oil and gas located offshore the United States in
the Gulf of Mexico and eastern Canada. DeepTech has ownership interest in two

El Paso Energy to Acquire DeepTech International's Interests In Leviathan Gas
Pipeline El Paso Energy to Acquire DeepTech International's Interests In
Leviathan Gas Pipeline March 2, 1998 7:23 AM EST

HOUSTON, March 2 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG)
announced today that the Boards of Directors of El Paso and DeepTech
International Inc. (Nasdaq: DEEP) and the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of DeepTech have approved definitive agreements for El Paso
to acquire DeepTech's interests in Leviathan Gas Pipeline through a series of
transactions. Leviathan Gas Pipeline Partners, L. P. (NYSE: LEV) produces,
processes, gathers, transports and markets oil and gas located in the offshore
Gulf of Mexico.

As a result of the transactions, El Paso will own 100% of the general partner
of Leviathan and a 27.3% effective interest in the partnership. The net cost to
El Paso for the Leviathan partnership interests will total approximately $450
million. Subject to the receipt of required approvals and other customary
conditions, the transactions are expected to be completed by the end of the
second quarter 1998.

Leviathan is the largest independent gatherer of natural gas in the Gulf of
Mexico, with interests in pipeline systems which transported more than 2.8
billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 1997. The pipeline systems, which cover a
large portion of the Outer Continental Shelf and access the prolific Deepwater
Trend of the Gulf of Mexico, include: the High Island Offshore System, the U-T
Offshore System, the Stingray Pipeline system, the Nautilus/Manta Ray Offshore
system, the Viosca Knoll Gathering system and the Poseidon Oil Pipeline. In
addition, Leviathan produces oil and gas from several offshore blocks and owns
interests in several multi-purpose offshore platforms which process oil and gas
for producers.

"Leviathan's offshore assets together with El Paso Field Services' existing
offshore assets will create the first offshore header system encompassing all
areas of Gulf production -- from Matagorda to Mobile. El Paso and Leviathan
will be uniquely positioned to benefit from development of the growing
Deepwater Trend and ultradeep opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico," said
William A. Wise, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of El Paso
Energy Corporation. "This acquisition is expected to be neutral to earnings per
share for the first 18 months and accretive to earnings thereafter. This
transaction increases the income contribution from our non-regulated businesses
and enhances long-term upstream supply opportunities for Tennessee Gas
Pipeline.

"We view the Deepwater Trend and the ultradeep as the most exciting new
frontiers for the development of large scale oil and gas reserves in the United
States based upon the significant discoveries to date, continuing technology
advancement in deepwater drilling and production, and the substantial capital
commitments of the E&P industry. Leviathan has been a leader in the past few
years in the expansion of pipeline and platform infrastructure to gather these
new supplies. We look forward to continued growth in the earnings and cash flow
of Leviathan which will benefit both Leviathan unit holders and El Paso
shareholders."

The series of transactions includes: (1) DeepTech's disposition of its offshore
drilling rigs by contribution to Tatham Offshore, Inc. (Nasdaq: TOFF), (2)
DeepTech effecting a rights offering to DeepTech shareholders of the Tatham
Offshore common and preferred stock currently owned by DeepTech and its

WOSI: Very interesting stores - mostly intellectual novelties. They have things
like fossils, ant farms, telescopes, chemistry sets, radio kits, Rubic's cubes,
stress toys, nature music/posters, etc. The ones I have seen have been located
in malls, and although lots of people browse, I've never seen much buying
activity. Somehow they've been making some money though.

Here is an interesting company that could be worth a look. Baltek Corp. is in
balsa wood, PVC foam, & shrimp farming, with operations based in Ecuador. It is
trading at less then book, about 1/2 of sales, PE of 12.9, less then 7 time
cash flow, with reasonable debt. Earnings over the last 5 months have grown at
a fantastic rate (see below). They use hedging to offset currency fluctuations,
have been expanding the shrimp operations, have no one customer accounting for
more then 10% of sales, and equity increased 6.3% in 97.

Last 5 quarters earnings

Q1 98 .20 vs .09 +122%
Q4 97 .31 vs .08 +287%
Q3 97 .19 vs .11 +72%
Q2 97 .14 vs (.05) n/a
