WOW. MWY is offering shares. This is the most unexpected, perplexing thing I've
seen. They have $28 million in cash. The offering would raise only $2 million.
And they are supposed to be in the middle of a buyback - and the latest
quarterly report says that they indeed have been buying back shares.

http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/990304/bf6.html

So what gives? I'm guffawing right now. Anyone with insight please let me know.
This company continues to perplex. All that knowledgeable outsider and insider
buying, the cheapest video game company, and the price sinks to ridiculous
levels. So offer a miniscule amount of shares for no reason?

I don't get it,

Dear deeno, Orbital Sciences: I looked a little at the material and the three
amended 10Q's. I can't judge the lawsuits mentioned somewhere, for hyping the
stock. But I do know a little about “Percentage of Completion” Contract
accounting as I ran a little engineering company for 18 years.

The alternative method is the “Completed Contract Method” which we liked better
but which the IRS makes almost impossible to use now. In it you post your
profit on completion of the contract, when you passed the performance test and
are sure you get all your money from the customer.

Naturally, you only owe taxes on the profit at that time. The IRS likes to see
your money earlier.

In the percentage-of-completion method, if you have $ 1 000 000 profit and it
takes 10 months to complete the job, you have to post $ 100 000 of your profit
each month and pay tax, at least once a year. We built plants that took 2 years
to build, and then fiddled some, with the punch-list (the customer withholds
money until you fix) . So, the difference was substantial.

Now, if during the time of executing the job, you find that your estimate was
too low, then nothing happens under the Completed Contract Method unless you
now project a loss on the contract. You post a “Provision for anticipated loss”
but it has no tax effect until you actually spent the money. This is always so
with provisions, and rightly so, because the temptation to postpone taxes would
be too great.

Under the Percentage-of-Completion Method, obviously, a lot fiddling has to be
done. Reversing profits previously posted. Maybe that is what is going on here,
although, what I saw is not as clear to me as it seems to the Merrill Lynch
guys. But it is hard to read the stuff on the screen, I am too far away for
hard copy.

I looked at the 100-months Chart and ORB hung around $ 18 for years. Maybe they
just want to keep it there :-)

From a Value point, this stock is risky and I will study it some more with a
view of trying to justify a buy at a lower number. Satellites and launches are
still iffy and there may have to be a larger number with a good success rate to
sort of see the space business the way you do those on the ground. Just look at
what interest rate they have to pay for project-related borrowed money.

Furthermore, as you may have gathered, in this kind of contract business, it
all depends how honest and / or accurate your estimate was. You should never
buy an engineering company unless you could check the estimates.

And ORB themselves say under “Risks” that a lot of what they do is novel. I
built plants where the original inventions happened in 1895 and 1907. A 10%
tolerance in the estimate of the cost of turnkey contracts (with field
construction) is normal there. Hell, I hope they have a lot bigger margin of
pretax profit.

Which brings up the “Tax asset” another gimmick. But they do have Retained
Earnings, so it may be OK.

I was impressed by the Board. Pretty seasoned guys. So, thanks for bringing it
to attention. I hope the stuff above is of a little use.

My reservations about the NH would be that the company seems to be around a 50%
agricultural finance company, and I have seen little discussion on this thread
regarding this aspect of the company. How adequate are the reserves for losses
relative to the exposure in various countries?
The company apparently securitizes some of their receivables. Is it with or
without recourse? If with recourse, how much is out there? What are the current
delinquencies in the portfolio and what is the trend? How much of the portfolio
represents long term financing and what is the geographical make-up of the

Called Midway. Here's my understanding:

As part of its spin-off, Midway had an agreement with the IRS to offer 1
million shares. The spin-off
was last April. They have already offered 750,000 to employees. They waited but
the stock price never recovered and now they have to offer these 250,000 shares
at current low prices. I get the impression they'd rather not. BUT the IRS
required them to offer these shares prior to any acquisitions. Acquisitions are
not necessarily in the works (although one has to wonder), but MWY wanted to
get this out of the way.

I clarified that this does not affect or reflect on their current
buyback, and MWY agreed with that statement.

Overall, this puts me at ease, but represents a terrible blunder
by the company's PR by not putting out a more informative press
release. That is, unless an acquisition is being sought and they
want everything under wraps.

Mike, on CPU, I have followed this for a while and avoided. There was decent
insider buying at double the price. The store near me is quite crowded whenever
I go.

I think the problem is a bad business model. Dell and Gateway is the best
business model for selling computers. MicroWarehouse is another superior one.
Free standing stores is the worst by far. The guys who buy this stuff are
typically much more sophisticated than average. It is no big deal to window
shop at CPU and buy over the Internet. This kind of stuff is quite vulnerable
to Internet shopping, as opposed to the fashions that fill most stores in
malls. It is no coincidence, in my opinion, that none of the malls near me have
any computer stores in them.

They probably overpaid for the Computer City chain as well, creating debt that
in effect won't fully service itself. (1 + 1 = 1).

I think that at $6 it might be a good trade, but I am skeptical of its long

I agree with Jeff, that CPU is particularly vulnerable to Net competition and
their customers will go to the net quicker than other, less sophisticated
customers. They even encourage customers to do so by having thier own online
store and a build-to-order PC program in the stores or from the net. Meanwhile,
other big box retailers like Best Buy will take potshots at best selling items
while not stocking a lot of the slower stuff.
On Computer City aquisition. They buy a bunch of stores then close a fair chunk
of them... Let's say there were 6 chain stores competing for computer business
in a 5 mile radius: Compusa, computer city, Best buy, circuit city, Office
depot and office max. Compusa buys and closes the computer city store. Do all
of city's customers automatically default to compusa? Nope, Compusa gets 20% -
40% of them while the other guys get a boost at no cost.

There are definitely problems at CPU with the Computer City
purchase but I think your comparison of the chain stores is
missing one important fact. CPU and Computer City are the only
2 100% computer specialists. The other 4 are probably 5 to 20%
computers with lots of other stuff (either office or consumer
electronics). So I don't think losing sales to them is a real
problem. The real problem is losing sales to the net and the
overall slow-down in growth of PC sales plus slimmer margins
on high growth segment of sub-$1000 machines.

Actually Best Buy, their biggest competitor of the bunch is closer to 40%

CPU is left as sole 100% computer chain, but the items stocked at the other
stores are the 20% of the products that drive 80% of the volume. Their presence
and advertised specials severely constrain CPU's margins. Despite the growth in
the net, these chains still represent the largest source of competition for

Just wanted to chime in here on CPU. Have been following and think there will
always be a place for the local computer superstore, especially as PCs further
penetrate households who generally will prefer to buy local IMO. I hope the
business model is workable because I really like going to their stores. They're
especially good for smaller ticket items ($200 or less). I've bought things
like software, sound card, speaker system, software, mouse, printer supplies,
etc, and find that the price advantage of the internet is reduced to near
irrelevence for the smaller ticket items. The way PC prices are dropping, soon
the computer itself may be a small ticket item.

Something left out of the discussion is that a good portion of CPU's business
is services: training and classes. Much better margins than retail.

Walter in HK. regarding Weitz Oct. interview and "is it possible nobody

Weitz Partners, or Weitz Hickory, then of course you realize that the publicly
reported holdings are in companies where Weitz can bring some specific
analytical and business acumen to the value analysis. That is, most of these
companies in my opinion-- CYCL, TDS, VCI, ICII, DTLN, VCELA, et. al. - are not
your standard issue value companies. Buying these companies IMO, requires or
required either faith in Weitz or some heavy duty business knowledge. Since
October, all of these Weitz companies increased in price (except DTLN). But my
opinion is that back in October, either people were selling as the market hit
new lows, staying put to see what was developing, or buying other companies
that were much easier to understand. Many regular posters here I'd guess would
have subjected the Weitz stocks to a cursory screen, and gone on. That's what I
did anyway.
A further comment is that you've classified Weitz as "a WEB type fund manager".

Steve: Limited selection on PC's is kind of a plus for retailers...A
contributor to Best Buys success was cutting way back on selection. Those
puppies depreciate faster that ripe tomatoes. This is part of the problem with
CPU's business model - The inventory depreciates far faster than other
categories of retail goods. The diversified stores dodge the bullet by just
carrying key items...easier to get turns even if you miss a few sales.
If, however, the price depreciation slows as has occurred in memory recently
[Big chunk of PC cost], then CPU is at less of disadvantage. The cost of
offering broader selection would lessen markedly. This might at some point be
part of a solid value case for CPU. I agree with Shane that these stores offer
consumers needed alternative and that many folks just prefer to go local rather
than order on the net.

Regarding local vs. net buying of computer supplies, I agree that local has

I don't think this argues in favor of CPU, though. Computer parts retailing
seems to be the one area where local mom & pop stores out-compete the chains.

If you are buying parts, then better prices and better service are to be found
at the Mom & Pop's. You don't need the high cost of a massive store and a
high-traffic location in this industry and you don't want to carry a lot of
inventory. And finding a salesperson you trust (distrust less?) is a high
priority.

I don't know if this holds for complete systems or software.

jeffrey,

I didn't mean to imply that NH isn't a good buy at it's current level, only
that one must think long term. In a couple of years it could be making new
highs.

IMO- This market is only thinking short term. Any news can bring forth a major
buying or selling spree on a company or a sector. Value investors should be
looking at those sectors and areas that are down and thinking long term. Oil
and Ag quickly come to mind as do foreign companies. Oil is a continual use
commodity, price controlled by a small group of Arab countries (remember 1979).
Ag prices are influenced by global weather, ag machinery does not last forever
and must be replaced. Some very good foreign companies have been sold down
simply because they are foreign, but that's where the growth will be.

On Nightline Buffet said (paraphrased), "chose those companies that will be
highly profitable in the good times and still make money in the bad" Seems like
good advise to me.

I don't agree Ron that oil is "price controlled by a small group of Arab

they have been in free fall for a while now, and substantial producers have
come to the fore who are not central members of OPEC--i.e., Venezuela, Nigeria,
Kazakhstan. Today, thank goodness, oil prices are "controlled" by supply and
demand, and there is oversupply in relation to the demand. Prices now are
barely above production costs. Indeed, many believe that the current robust
economy has in large measure been fueled by "cheap oil."

My premise for further research into CPU: Leverage (operating, not financial).
CompUSA has the right name, and in many places the right location. The stores
are fun to shop (I rarely leave without buying something), and many regular
people think CompUSA when they need a part tonight, tomorrow, or early this
week. From a customer's perspective, I find the prices comparable and in some
cases better than the first placesI look on the internet. There's a lot of
sales there. There's also an internet presence which is not insignificant. For
smaller-ticket items, CompUSA is a first or second thought for a lot of people.

From a contrarian investor's perspective, I like that everyone hates the stock,
and that there is a specific event (the computer city acquisition) that
everyone points to as the reason to hate the stock. It is not hard to imagine,
5 years from now, people looking back at this price shakeout and saying, "how
could people have thought that COMPUSA would disappear? And why did they let
the Computer City acquisition scare them off? Didn't they see that balance
sheet?"

From a business perspective, I see an inventory nightmare. Economies of scale
would seem to be very important in this business, and hence the Computer City
acquisition doesn't bother me too much. The right manager, the right concept,
and I can see CompUSA earning just a few percentage points higher margin on all
that revenue.

I'm waiting for a steal on this one - <$4.80. I want it at less than book and
6-7% of sales. But further due diligence is ongoing, and my target may change.
This may be a case of buying crap at half the going rate for crap, but I like
the wildcard of potential margin expansion at these levels and am balancing
that against the competition factor.

re: CPU, DBRN, IGT, HSC, reason #6545 to hate the government...

Are there flaws in CPU's business model and do things look bad now? Yes. Is the
internet a threat? Yes. These things would have been nice to know if one owned
the stock at 19 last fall, or if one were into shorting at that time. But now
with the stock at 6, analysts bailing, and institutional investors in what
looks like a panic sell, I would be asking different questions.

My first would be what is my downside risk here? Specifically, is it zero (i.e
bankruptcy)? With $400 million of cash on the balance sheet offset by $200
million of debt (the market cap is about $550 million), I would have to think
that this company is going to be around for a while. That's not to say you
couldn't lose a lot of money here - only that if CPU is a terminal case it is
going to be a slow death. Then I think, these guys are the leader in their
business and do an awful big portion of industry volume. Don't you think the
manufacturers might need these guys around? I don't know this business well,
and what I do know I don't like, but what I do know is that when I want to buy
something for my computer this is where I go. If the balance sheet is as solid
as it looks, we're fishing in the right pond here.

Any thoughts on another of last week's roadkill? International Gaming
Technology (IGT)? Something like 80% market share in slot machines, now trading
at its lowest multiple since 1990. I haven't done much work on this one yet,
but is there anybody out there who knows it well? Its probably worth a look if
you're into weird businesses like I am. (Especially weird businesses that make
huge returns on equity, mint cash, dominate their markets, and are down over
50% from their high.)

Also in Barrons, Dress Barn (DBRN) sounds too good to be true. But its true. I
looked at this one last fall but picked a couple other small cap wrecks. Its
pretty close to the price I looked at it at (though that might change at the
open on Monday). This one is worth a close look as well.

I figured out my taxes today and I found that I have to do some selling
whatever my view of the market. Hmm, which of my undervalued securities should
I sell to pay my fair share for all those government services I value so much?

Jim, re IGT. Well, I follow it (sold my position in '97), but perhaps I may not
know it well enough for your needs. Until last week, I had been looking for a
buy point again about 19-20. But with this new possible legislation being
introduced in Nevada whereby casinos or Nevada, will garner a larger share of
progressive jack pots-- I've stopped to reassess. IGT now gets a cut of the
revenues on their progressive slot machines. (IGT has had some power here over
the casinos because they've tied the machines together over many casinos to
enable larger jackpots -- the progressive).
If the legislation fails to pass, or there's only minor accommodation to the
Nevada casinos, then I'd reconsider being a buyer. However, at this point I'm
not astute enough to either assess the final legislative outcome or any
potential impact on IGT if such legislation passes. Big long term holder and

IGT popped up on my screen just a few days ago as hitting
possible value territory. My concern, since we're supposed
to be discounting cash flows and such back to the present (
with one methodology or another), is even if this legislation
doesn't pass, there's the risk it might in the future. That
risk should materially diminish the current intrinsic
value of the firm. Since I don't recall anyone ever bringing
up the possibility of this law during IGT's hayday, I'd say
that the framework for valuing IGT is markedly changed even if
the law doesn't pass very soon.

That said, should the law matter? IGT and Anchor discount
their machines in return for a cut of the revenues. Those machines,
if priced entirely in the present value, would be worth much, much
more, and IGT's average selling price per machine would go through the roof.

BUT that makes IGT more cyclical IMO, with less reliable earnings.
The market, again, will make the stock more volatile, and discount
the stock for not having as consistent earnings.

I think the market may be overdoing it here, but I'm interested
to see how low an otherwise company like IGT can go. It and CPU
go on my acute watch list.

is a shell game to hide expenses - an attempt to appease the street, provide
stock price stability, and through both of these retain employees. With the
tech companies, stock options and stock price performance are crucial to
employee retention. Because options are a large part of many employees
compensation, poor stock performance can become a "self fulfilling prophecy" if
you will for company performance. The best employees can move quickly to
another company in the valley.

I bought PSFT before the recent poor quarterly report, and sold immediately
after - shocked at the poor results. The recovery in ERP seems to me to be out
of sight right now, so I see no danger in holding off on the ERP sector until
later this year or even into 2000. There's no hurry. And even then I'd prefer
to get SAP or ORCL should they fall enough.

Paul thanks for the Weitz input. The 6 you mentioned I looked up the SI Charts,
as a starter, and noticed 4 don't have a thread which may be a good sign. The
other two have a last post which is 2 mo and 2 weeks old.

Five sound like they are hi-tech, all are in SI's data base.

One successful stock investor quoted in John Trains book years ago says if
broker report appears in some index, he won't bother.

The point is, everything is so picked over today, Values are so hard to find.
Why, I put four kids through MIT by studying Value Line for two hours on Sunday
in the 70s and 80s. You could trip across a good company where you can buy cash
at a 55 % discount. Them were the days.

This is why I look for someone to help. And I would like to study what Weitz is
holding some more.

Where can you find it on the internet ? Would appreciate info.

I also looked at the 100 months charts (not all the Weitz Funds are that old of
course) and perhaps there are funds with greater gains.

But some respected professor has this theory that fund results of the future
are random, you have no better chance going by past record. In other words even
Peter Lynch was just lucky.

I think there is some truth in this because when someone comes up with a
certain screen etc and the trend for that year or decade happens to favor those
criteria, then the fellow will look like a hero - until the trend changes.
Lynch wisely retired at the top. Maybe he knew.

So, how do they behave in the long run, in a downturn ? I don't mind if
somebody can find a track record better than Weitz . Or if Weitz has one less
glorious than somebody else in the future. I just would feel safer for the
future, precisely because Weitz bought “with a margin of safety” (see Ruckeyser
transcript of Oct 9)

For this reason, I think the investment criteria (and the person applying them)
are at least as important as the track record.

I quoted the criteria of Weitz in my earlier post #6198 because I like them.

How do they really vary from what the “Value Investing” thread is after?

You said in your answer “ ,,,CYCL, TDS, VCI, ICII, DTLN,
VCELA, et. al. - are not your standard issue value companies. Buying
these companies IMO, requires or required either faith in Weitz or some
heavy duty business knowledge” Yes, I might develop that faith, after some more
checking. Looks great, so far.

and “ ..you've classified Weitz as "a WEB type fund
manager". If he is, then value investors might not be looking for the same
stocks Weitz is."

Mind you, I will concede, if you let someone else do your picking (because of
“heavy duty business knowledge” for which you and I presumably don't have the
time to develop) then we can't have some of the fun, like discussing it with
others on the threads (after ignoring some garbage)

But what are we after ? I am an investor and I take money seriously. Frankly, I
think there is more money around than talent to administer it. Real talent.
Just think of Long Term Capital. Why, that guy only had to report once a
quarter when at Salomon. Salomon was careless. More money than talent around.

If you don't mind, kindly look at my post

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=8158333

which quotes one page from the Weitz prospectus.
If that isn't “Value Investing”, what is ?

Shane, Re: ERP crash and PSFT, SAP, ORCL

Warning: long post

The fact that ERP is down to the point that I get asked all the time
about PSFT and SAP by people who know me to be a value, non-tech guy made PSFT
interesting for me. I started out with a bullish bias thanks to my contrarian
nature, but the more I explored the MMTM shell via the proxy and talking with
analysts, the more I saw problems. Incyte, a biotech company I like, made a
similar spin-off maneuver, but I don't think it had as desperate implications
as the MMTM trick. I get this mainly from weighing the proxies, ERP consultant
and analyst comments. PeopleSoft really has fallen behind on several
significant next-gen apps/strategies thanks to a lackluster R&D effort, and it
seems to me that MMTM is a much weaker shell than the typical biotech outfit.

After the article one guy e-mailed me to report that the customers due PSFT's
research in the industry-specific higher ed app because of all the bugs. PSFT's
motive is clear - satisfy the average tech/PSFT shareholder enough to keep the
share price from reflecting the true value, and hence stem any potential
employee migration to Oracle or smaller, mid-market an niche competitors.
PSFT's employees, by report, are its biggest asset at the current time, even
more so than its installed base, which may not be "vertical" enough to act as a
backbone to generate enough additional sales to continue growth near historical
rates.

As I see it, and as I posted on the Yahoo thread in vain, there are several
issues that PSFT must resolve if it is to regain its wings:

1) proprietary PeopleTools; susceptible to standards if implemented; this is a
familiar theme in tech which typically has not worked out well for those not
simply leading but dominating the pertinent market
2) difficulty porting current PSFT products too far into the mid-market given
current sales, support, design, and really no chance at the micro-market. A
significant amount of the growth in ERP (of which you speak) will be in these
two areas.
3) PeopleSoft is actually now #3 in ERP; Oracle has surpassed them. And PSFT
software largely runs on Oracle databases; Oracle is simply vicious and PSFT
knows that
4) PSFT has not been successful developing industry-specific products from the
ground-up on its own, yet its future depends on this; management knows that it
is heading into uncharted territory here and acknowledges as much
5) Despite perceptions of MSFT agreement, PSFT is behind in e-business relative
to the two already ahead of it in the ERP market, and lags especially Oracle
6) Brain drain if the stock/prospects lag too long; PSFT has never had to deal
with employee layoffs or a low stock price, and this introduces a new,
challenging dynamic into PSFT's pool of talent. Here's an area where being in
the Bay Area is really a double-edged sword.
7) Keeping up an R&D effort on par with Oracle and SAP. Oracle and SAP have a
lot more revenues with which to leverage their research. This has been many a
perpetual second-banana's dilemma.

PSFT is half as expensive as SAP or Oracle on a ratio analysis. Still, one
analyst with a buy on PSFT noted that it really should be cheaper, because of
its lesser competitive position going forward, He had a buy on it because he
felt traders would react to those ratios anyway.

One bearish issue that may not be worthy but needs watching - the increased
selling of shares by the Duffields of late.

I agree with you. I'd prefer SAP or ORCL if they fall far enough.
Knowing what I now know, wish I could have another shot at ORCL in
the low 20's.

Good investing,
Mike

You inspired me to repeat some observations on stock-picking that I believe
many on this thread would agree with:

Number one the market is NOT efficient. Number two the Street is not willing to
look beyond its nose at companies currently doing poorly, but with more
interesting longer term fundamentals. Finally the Street has a distinct
preference for larger, more liquid companies for reasons that have more to do
with liquidity than with advantages that larger companies do have.

Therefore, I believe the way to make good money on a risk-adjusted basis is to
take advantage of market preferences which are not relevant to the actual
investment merits of a company -- by buying smaller companies or larger
companies that are currently in a down cycle, like a NH. This has not worked
recently, but I believe is still
a sound strategy for the long term.

Hello Walter in HK. Well, we again come down to the likelihood that there are
many definitions of 'value investing'. Any or all of which might be effective
depending on the practitioner.
I look at value investing from a Ben Graham perspective, I think. This would be
a method that IMO, focuses on safety of principle and gaining an adequate
return. Unlike Weitz's, it does not test for honesty of management or attempt
to determine "franchise" value or other intangibles. From what I garner
rereading your quoted Weitz material, Weitz seeks capital gain, primarily from
a few investments where he/his analysts have detailed knowledge of the
businesses. In Graham's writings IMO, and with my investment approach
certainly, there's more of an emphasis on diversification rather than
emphasizing detailed business knowledge and thus holding fewer issues.

Anyone looking at the Weitz stocks I mentioned will see they are not houshold
names -- not in any households I'm familiar with anyway -g-. To have come
across such companies in Oct. of '98 - anyone buying them had to have some very
good insight and knowledge of their business and their business prospects. Or
spend the time getting that knowledge. There were just so many other
statistically-and-obviously cheap companies that value investors could have
bought. These Weitz companies didn't and don't look like the value companies I
am looking for. But... if they are the "value" type companies you are seeking,
they might be winners for you.

As far as what value type companies people on this thread are looking for, I
speak only for myself. May I suggest though that you also check out the
"Buffettology" thread here on SI? It was created in recognition of the
difference between the Buffett style and the Graham style.
Regards, Paul Senior

ps: If I might politely inquire, do you have any HK stocks that you like at
their present prices? I'd be interested in ones that would be listed on our
NYSE or NASDQ.

Mike-

Thanks for posting the PSFT article link as well as your good "long post".

My opinion is that the ERP uncertainty is not over, because newer technologies
(thin clients, web-based interfaces) make it harder to charge immense fees for
this software. In a 5-10 years, ERP should become as straightforward to use as
QuickBooks Pro and Microsoft Office, reducing customization fees.

SAP is indeed the gorilla in this sector, but they have not had to change their
business model on the fly, and I am thus hesitant to put them anywhere near the
MSFT/INTC category of survivor. It will be interesting to see who makes money
in the next wave of ERP. I think the whole ERP sector is rapidly approaching a
strategic inflection point, as Andy Grove might put it.

The only company I own in this sector is Datastream Systems (DSTM), which I
have posted on here in the past. I still like DSTM, but am wary of the entire
sector due to the uncertain future outlook.

Michael, let me add myself to list of those who think you are dead on wrt PSFT.
One wonders whether a put position on PSFT is not unreasonable now. Further,
IMO those 2nd/3rd tier ERP firms that _do_ have the vertical competencies that
PSFT lacks might be potential takeover candidates going forward.

I have thought about possible "indirect plays" on ERP slowdown: First, what
about Gartner Group (IT)? It's their job to interpret tech uncertainties such
as these ERP developments for us right? Second, business intelligence
stocks...companies may focus efforts on getting some useful info out of their
ERP systems they have paid so dearly for. Two thoughts: Cognos (COGN) trading
around 16x earnings on the face of it seems a good play but I need to do more
DD. Also Hummingbird's (HUMC) recent acquisition of PCDocs has drawn analyst
boos; at first blush I do see synergy. Cheers

Interesting article on oil prices:

***************

Hopes of Opec intervention keep crude oil prices firm

Oil prices held firmly to recent gains on Friday following signals that
producer club Opec might consider fresh action to support the glutted markets.

Hopes that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries may solve a
dispute blocking attempts to make further output cuts have pushed prices up 70
cents over the week.

International benchmark Brent crude for April delivery in London ended two
cents higher at US$11.55 a barrel, some $2 above December's 12-year lows.

The possibility that Opec might decide new production curbs at a meeting later
this month lured buyers back into the market at the middle of the week as US
investment funds sought to cover positions.

Opec heavyweight Iran is embroiled in a dispute with other members of the
cartel over the production baseline it was assigned last year when producers
agreed to a series of output cuts, arguing it is much too low.

But a recent flurry of Iranian diplomacy has raised sellers' hopes that Opec
would go beyond the 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in output reductions it
agreed last June.

Iranian diplomats say Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi will visit fellow Opec
member Venezuela on March 17 for two days to discuss the coming group meeting.

Kharrazi has already visited Opec members Saudi Arabia and Libya to discuss the
March 23 gathering, and has called for more production cuts to lift prices from
their current trough.

I don't deny that OPEC can still influence prices, but they are a paper tiger
now compared to their strength 25 years ago. Had they been able to control
prices, we never would have seen the absolute plummeting of prices over the
past year or so. Unfortunately for OPEC, many cash hungry OPEC nations do not
adhere to the organization's guidelines, and many nations now produce oil who
will not be dictated to by OPEC. The cartel has often been metaphorically
referred to as a "sick man." I doubt that it will ever return to its former
state of "health."

Be well.

"The fact of the matter is that right now the way the world works is investors
are very focused on things like earnings per share and price/earnings ratios.
No matter how the analysts try, I don't think they are going to have a lot of
success in adding these things together and creating a set of metrics that
don't match PeopleSoft's earnings releases.

I find that a fundamentally difficult proposition, given the models they use
and the guidance they receive. How could PeopleSoft go on record projecting any
earnings at all if it's not obligated in any way to do what the analysts
expect?"

Food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. (Nyse:RN) said Tuesday it
will sell its international tobacco business to Japan Tobacco for $8 billion
and plans to split its U.S. tobacco and foods businesses. Investor Carl Icahn,
who holds a 6.6 percent stake in RJR, has been pushing for a split of the
company.Industry analysts have said the shedding of the international tobacco
unit will shore up RJR's business overall and help defend itself against any
proxy battle. RJR, maker of Camel, Salem and Winston cigarettes, said Japan
Tobacco will buy all business and trademarks from the international unit.

Any announcement of an RN breakup into food and tobacco units isn't new news.
The company has always stated that that is their eventual aim, but has also
stated that substantial legal obstacles prevent them doing so--referencing the
tobacco litigation.

A slight bounce seems to be in order--as seen the past few days--because the
international sale makes a splitup more feasible. But it still doesn't remove

investing for the long term, what is the business worth? Period. If you're
talking about a $50 million market cap, you're dealing with a perpetual
discount, but if you're talking about a reasonably sized company either the
market will come to its senses or you're going to get acquired in the long run.
I don't lose sleep over market cap, and it is a constant fight I have at work.
It all comes down to whether you are buying a stock or buying a business. I buy

Though don't get me wrong, today the premium for size is huge. So if I believe

Paul:

The liquidity in Nasdaq stocks is often an illusion. Volume can easily be
pumped up to create the mirage of liquidity as the same stock changes hands a
couple of times on way from seller to buyer. I remember reading a study which
indicated that many Nasdaq stocks actully only trade about 30% of their
indicated volume as market makers etc get between buy and ask. (I believe it
was in Forbes a year or so back)

At any rate, the illusion will become more so for insanely valued stocks as
their will be few buyers once momentum players lose interest. Presstek was a
good example of this. (all this imho)

Allen: And so for some perspective, I'll mention that none of my Latin American
stocks is working out for me.

ELAMF. Stock still going nowhere and near its low. I continue to hold.

UBB: Up. Nice recommendation by Arrnin Sternberg and Mike Burry. I lost
confidence and sold at a loss. A Brazilian bank stock with fundamentals that
still looks good, but I wrongly gave up on it.

BLX: Another ‘bank' stock. It loans money very short term for trading/shipping
co's. I figured it would NOT decline with Brazil problems, but I didn't have
enough courage-of conviction to buy. Stock is up without me. I may revisit this
stock yet.

UNMG: still holding, but still a loser for me. A fruit juice company which I've
posted on here before. They are selling below private market value (that would
be by my comparable analysis). I thought they might do well also because their
North American citrus crop competitors were hurt by bad weather. Looks like I'm
wrong in that idea too.

I'm 0 for 4. So I think if I'm going to invest in individual Latin American
companies, then I'm going to have to have to change something. I think I will
need something that's somewhat isolated from specific country exchange rate
fluctuations. Something with a long term positive perspective or else something
dramatically and drastically undervalued. ( But I can't find anything
drastically undervalued because I can't figure out the valuations, or the
implications for the associated currency.) But what I really want- for me- is
something that will help me sustain my belief in the company when/if things go
bad with the political situations, the currency risks, etc.

I believe I have found a Buffett stock that will work out short term (3 years)
, and that I might bet will be ‘okay' long term. It's PB – Panamco -
Panamerican Beverages - largest soft drink bottler in Latin American and one of
the world's largest Coca-Cola bottlers. They are an ‘anchor bottler' for KO.
Revenue and dividends are on an uptrend, but of course earnings are hurt by
Latin America problems. Stock is a value stock on some measures (esp. by
relative p/bv and psr) – but I think I will try to look at it as if it were a
Buffett type stock (which it is)—so maybe I won't scare myself out of it if
/when it drops lower.

Stock is near its low--- I figure most all those who want out have departed the
stock-- for now. (until the next ‘problem' -g-) So if things don't get worse,
and with the inexorable rise of population (aside: unless Mr. Buffett himself
is able to arrest that—I read he likes the Zero Pop. Growth charities) and with
perhaps a rise to better living standards in Latin America—I think Buffett's
managers at KO should be able to work their stuff on Latin America too (KO owns
a chunk of PB) and get those people to upgrade their tastes to the caramelized
carbonated fructose liquid that folks here in the USA are so fond of. And for
me, at least it's a product or consumer item I might be able to fool myself
into thinking might endure or persevere in bad times (unlike UBB, ELAMF -
companies whose business and output are hard to see unless you are actually
right there in the country).
So I'm altering my focus a bit and starting a position in PB.

Jeffrey, that's already a large part of my rationale for moving all my ag equip

Paul, keep the faith on ELAMF. I don't see any reason to sell my shares, and I
am just as confident in it as I was in UBB (which I continue to hold with no
thought of selling). I refuse to believe, even with the DOW for all practical
purposes at 10,000, that fundamental analysis principles have been repealed.
And if they haven't, ELAMF is still a steal.

Mike,

I agree on ELAMF and continue to hold.

Since foreign equities are being discussed...
I'll refrain from mentioning DSWLF at it's current price because it's been beat
to death on this thread, but I will re-suggest HIHOF & HIHWF (warrants). It's a
Hongkong based company listed on the Nasdaq now selling a little above net cash
liquidity, about 1/2 BV, and a PE around 4.

I won't go into the financials. The story: Highway was a metal stamping company
that branched into cheap and disposable cameras. It's CEO is German and they
did a lot of business there. In 1997, they bought out a bankrupt German clock
company (well below value) that had been doing $50M in revs and moved the
entire factory to China- writing off the costs to move (reflected in earnings).
Their intent was to move out of supplying OEMs on metal stamping and
concentrate on clocks and cameras. Outside revenue from metal stamping has
fallen off, but they are showing excellent growth in the clocks and cameras.

They just announced a deal that effectively acquires their competition in
Germany. This company was doing $60M revs. It is likely that there will be a Q
or two of poor earnings due to the acquisition, then earnings should
substantially increase. The acquisition gives them two recognized, respected,
and marketable brand names.

Clocks and cheap cameras are not a glamour product, but this company has made
some excellent moves and should become highly profitable starting in the Sep Q.

I own stock and warrants.

JMHO,
Ron

Paul, thanks for your Ben Graham views. Sorry I was off-line (HD warranty) and
have to catch up.

What you say about Weitz intrigues me: Graham, applied to non-household names.
Makes sense as all is picked over, but I will check the record. Still waiting
for Weitz material via Florida - they won't send abroad.

And I have to find an internet way to see which stocks they own at their latest
reports. Do you know which SEC form shows it ? They download awesomely fast
here, but are harder to read than hard copy.

No, I own no Hong Kong stocks yet. I am an investor and don't understand it
yet, 18 months here. Found a wonderful Developer (70% of HK market cap is Real
Estate - or was) at 20 % of book. And book in HK is based on appraisals, the AR
being signed by a US Auditor (so, my guess, not off by more than 100%) and this
Co, Lai Sun Development, has a Sept FY, so it was much more recent than
calendar year companies.

I have access here to some biggies (my wife runs a tertiary institution) and
first thing I hear, the tycoon is in jail (out on bail) in Taiwan for bribery.
He bought the Furama Hotel at the top of the market etc.

With respect to Real Estate, the other uncertainty is that I don't know how
long land will be kept so scarce. The Government owns all and only "sells"
leases, a max of 125 acres a year, since the Joint Declaration of 1984, and
they have't even fulfilled that. If I ever find out the tycoons cut in the
Beijing big party boys (via their children) then I will understand it.

So, I haven't found much here. Missed Hutcheson Whampoa which is run by Li
Ka-shing the biggest and best of the tycoons here. He has an uncanny nose for
jumping in when things look depressed. The banks: You don't know anything about
their loan portfolio until the stock is up again.

But generally, the HK market is the only one I would look at. British
disclosure requirements and you can read the stuff in English. The rest of the
region, including Japan (except maybe those meeting US disclosure as ADR) are
just one crapshoot. You find lucky people who happen to have made money there
and you won't find the ones who fell quiet because they lost their shirt.

Since yesterday I am Ethernet connected to the net of the Institute my wife
runs and have learned how to get my e-mail out of sympatico.ca (Canada) and
Aol, get the NYTimes real fast now. Happily retired and have no time.

Does anyone have opinions on Computer Hardware/Peripheral distributors? I am
particularly looking at Tech Data Corporation (Nasdaq:TECD). Their P/B is 0.86,
P/E is 6.77, and P/S is 0.08. At first glance, a value stock if I have ever
seen one.

TECD distributes microcomputer-related hardware and software products to
value-added and corporate resellers, computer retailers and direct marketers.

This whole sector has been very hard hit in the past few months. Is this the
time to buy? Others which are worth a look are CHS Electronics, Inc (NYSE:HS)
(P/B 0.51; P/E 4.83; P/S 0.05) and Comp USA (NYSE:CPU), the last being in a

I have not bought any yet, but at these valuations they may be hard to pass up.

>>volume can easily be pumped up to create the mirage of liquidity<<

While stocks and volume can be manipulated, the phenomenon you describe here is
seen in many stocks with no evil scheme behind it. The "inflated" volume you
see in many NASDAQ stocks has to do with NASDAQ's unusual volume reporting
system. On NASDAQ, one broker may buy from another simply to increase
inventory, or to fill an order when no member of the public is selling, or none
is selling at the desired price. Thus if I put in to buy 10,000 shares of
"ABCD", an illiquid stock, the filling broker may have to buy from another
broker just to fill the trade. Volume would then show up at 20,000 shares, even
though the only public order involved 10,000 shares. Sometimes this does
involve a broker getting in between the bid and ask, but this is permitted.
Schemes are schemes and quirks are quirks, and the "inflated" volume on NASDAQ
stocks is more usually just a quirk of the system NASDAQ uses rather than a
market maker manipulation.

The point of the matter was that volume is inflated which can create the mirage
of liquidity when it actually does not exist. Whether "evil" intentions are at
work was not my intent. The bottom line is that in tough times, when you sell,
it may be more difficult to unload stocks or "apparently the same liquidity" in
the Nasdaq vs the NYSE. (imho)

to Mike (My opinions *only*): First, thanks for the URL. I wasn't aware of that
CDA insider site. Regarding restaurant stocks, I did not or do not know of any
specific increase in insider buying for any of the restaurant stocks I own.

Immediately after I established my current position in DINE as a value stock,
the $5 stock jumped some, so I decided it was too late to post on it. FWIW, the
stock has retraced in the past month (I don't know why), and I still own the
position. I also own LDRY, BUNZ, and DANB. None of these stocks is working out
for me. My highest hopes for 1999 are with DANB. (It's not a value stock
though).

Regarding Ingram announcement, it has affected (IMO) ICO, which I own.
(Aside-- I like distributors- electronic components, office supplies,
janitorial services, food - when I can get them at what I think are good
prices. But so far, I'm not doing too well with this area either.) The Ingram
announcement has also affected me, in that now I've got to decide whether my
ICO position is worth adding to at its current low level. (My original reason
for buying ICO- they are going to focus on garnering profits as a
consulting/service provider rather than from box selling-- remains intact. So
I'm holding on.)

Jim,et.al.: Ah hah and ah so. Let's grab a Jenny Cream Ale and talk. Because of
GENBB, I now know why I'm so reluctant to invest in CSE, NH, and those other
ag. stocks. In my mind -- these stocks are perpetually undervalued. Genessee
Beer--- it's like a rite of passage for value investors. That's my zen
enlightment, struck-by-lightning thought. A person just cannot call
himself/herself a value investor unless he or she at some point comes across
and considers investing in GENBB. That stock has been in the undervalued class
for 25 years at least. A person cannot not know about it and call
himself/herself a dedicated a value investor -gg--.

But of course, that's just the one side of it. At some points in those past
decades -- it did go up. So people did make money by buying low. Same with ag.
stocks. But I don't know of any enthusiastic and happy campers with that beer
stock, or anybody who made good money in ag stocks either. Still, maybe they'll
all work out okay. I just think they entrap more value investors than they
benefit. That would be my opinion. Paul

Paul, are we talking about the same industry?

From late 1986 to early 1998 Deere's stock went up roughly 10 times in almost a
straight line, with only a two year sideways consolidation. A friend and I are
discussing only how much of our portfolio we want to put into NH over the next
year (if it remains under $9), not whether it is a good idea.

In my opinion, NH will double (from 9) sometime within the next 5 years, while
paying a 6% annual dividend. Assuming that it takes the whole 5 years, that
would be over a 20% compound annual return - which I do not expect the market
averages to achieve - and with less risk, with about 30% of the return from
dividends.

Paul, Re: Deere max chart,

To me the stock is doubling quite regularly, albeit in a jagged pattern with
long pauses. It bounces from 4-10 for four years, then moves to 10-20 for 3
years, then 20-25 for 1 year then 25-30 for 6 mos, now it's 30-60 for 2.5 years
and counting. And bouncing now at the low end of its range. You really have to
look at a logarithmic chart as in Yahoo to see that it is moving. Appears to me
there's plenty of money to be made there. Case, NH, well there's only a few
years trading history in those charts, and if DE is to be any lesson, the true
mistake in ag stocks has been to look at the last few years' worth of stock
performance and believe it will continue.

I consider NH, DE to be two of the surest things in the market. Oh yeah, and

I agree with you on MAT. Also still holding Timberland and will continue no

I'd love to get into Oracle at prices less than 20 as a long-term hold. Or

The problem with DE in the near to medium term is the general ag market, low

tractors...(etc.) But in the longer term, DE will still be here when lesser
competitors will have pulled in their horns.

There are portfolio reasons for an investor to be in the heavy equipment
sector. Among these companies, you want to be in the biggest and best, I think,
and plan to hold for the long pull. I've chosen DE, and the current price looks
like a good entry point.

"From late 1986 to early 1998 Deere's stock went up roughly 10 times in almost
a straight line, with only a two year sideways consolidation."

Any patient long term investor would have done exceedingly well on Deere buying
at any point during a ten year period. I wish I had owned more stocks like
that.

A much fairer comment would be that the extraordinary performance of recent
years will not be ready to recur after only a one year correction, or that it
may never recur. I actually subscribe to the latter view, that it will never
recur. However, looking for a double by NH in 5 years (after a 70% drop to
about 75% of book value) is only a pale shadow of former DE performance.
