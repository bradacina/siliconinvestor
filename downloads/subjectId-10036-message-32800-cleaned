Hi Spekulatius - I have found that the commissions are quite high through
Schwab to trade individual corporate bonds unless you buy $50K or more of the
issue. The bond desk also make their money on the bid/ask spread which are
typically at the high end (ie 5%) again on large orders they may split the
middle.

You might look at individual preferred shares as I did quite well with a hybrid
preferred offering that had a guaranteed payoff after two years. They were 7.5%
Albertson preferred shares which were paid at the coupon value early when the
Super Value acquisition was announced.

If you find anything interesting, update the thread as I am also interested in
value priced (but low risk) corporate debt. My credit union pays a pretty good
rate at 3.5% but the majority of my fixed income is held in the Vanguard GNMA.

Jurgis, thanks for the update. A rated does not mean much if it's a financial.
I think I'll pass on trying with bonds for now. I do hold some minor position
in preferred debt - DLR-pb and HRP-pd. Both are REIT's, a sector which looks
like a disaster. I don't think that any of the two above will default, though.

Speaking of REIT's, I did get out of KIMCO as well with a small gain. I am
looking at SPG, the bellweather but I think it's going to be a long drought for
commercial real estate. After X-mas there are going to be a lot of stores
closing for good (Circuit City did not even make it that far) and at that point
the carnage will be far more evident.

Hi Paul - Took my small profit on Aqua America Inc. (WTR) collected my 2.7%
dividend and put the proceeds into SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU) which now yields 6.2%
(xdividend date 11/26). This is an IRA account so dividends are important for
the portfolio.

However, SVU keeps hitting new lows so my strategy may be wrong especially if
SVU cuts their dividend.

Pretty sour market but held my nose and doubled my small position in
Ultrapetrol (Bahamas) Ltd. (ULTR) after I read their earnings report released
11/12/2008.

Here are some of the highlights that caught my eye:

-- Recorded net income of $15.1 million, or earnings per share ("EPS") of
$0.46, for the third quarter of 2008, compared to a net loss of $4.7 million,
or EPS of ($0.14), in the third quarter of 2007;

I believe their River business will see excellent growth even in a global
slowdown as the regions soy beans harvest is growing at 9% and has to be
transported (via river barge to the ports). Just hope for rain so the river
levels remain high.

From their most recent report:

"...The Company experienced a 14% increase in the volume of cargo loaded in the
third quarter 2008 as compared with the same period of 2007...

...The latest 2008 USDA estimate for the Paraguayan soybean crop of 6.8 million
tons suggests production growth of over 0.6 million tons, or 9.7%, as compared
with 2007, and USDA further projects 2009 crop in Paraguay with a production of
7.2 million tons or an increase of 5.9% over 2008. Industry sources indicate
iron ore production at the three mines located in Corumba, serviced by this
river system grew substantially in 2008. However, the present global economic
crisis as well as low water levels in the High Paraguay River may reduce the
volumes transported in the fourth quarter of 2008.

The Company continues with the progress in the setting up of its new barge
building yard, which is planned to be in production by second quarter of 2009.
The Company's yard at Ramallo is currently using 70% of its capacity for
refurbishing the existing fleet in order to have the maximum number of
operational barges for the 2009 season. We expect that with only 30% of the
capacity devoted to this task during the first quarter of 2009 the pace of the
130-barge enlargement program will slow down but we still expect to be able to
complete the program by end 2010..."

======================================================

ULTR seems like a great value buy at $2.31/share. According to YAHOO BV is now
$7.35/share and the forward PE is a screaming 1.69!

At this point, the market does not seem to care about value, earnings or the
future prospects of many of these small very profitable companies. A shrewd
investor will look over the deep canyon ahead and out to the much greener
pastures in the distance.

I have been wrong many times but I doubt this company will go BK.

Okay EKS, I'm following you.

I've cut WTR by 1/3.

I continue to add today also to SVU.

I continue to add today also to ULTR.

ULTR: I just wonder if there's more problems with ULTR non-barge business than
I comprehend. My understanding is their cruise ship, which is for sale, has no
takers, and is currently in drydock (or whatever the correct term is) at some
minimal cost (according to management). Also maybe their ocean business is not
doing well - similarly poorly to other shipping companies. They may have some
competitive advantage here though:

"In our Ocean Business, we currently operate nine oceangoing vessels, including
four Handysize / small product tankers, which we employ in the South American
coastal trade where we have preferential rights and customer relationships,
three versatile Suezmax / Oil-Bulk-Ore, or Suezmax OBOs, one Capesize vessel
and one semi-integrated tug / barge unit. Our Ocean Business fleet has an
aggregate capacity of approximately 744,529 dwt., and our three Suezmax OBOs
are capable of carrying either dry bulk or liquid cargos, providing flexibility
as dynamics change between these market sectors."

Hi Paul - SVU has the most debt per share of the three major grocery chains
(KR, SWY & SVU). This was due to their acquisition of Albertsons almost two
years ago. The large debt (including goodwill) results in a negative Tangible
Book Value for the company. SVU pays this debt with the cash flow they generate
from operations which has been more than sufficient to cover this expense.
Remember that depreciation expense is an accounting book entry and the extra
cash can be used to pay down debt.

Of the three companies their percentage of cash flow used to service their debt
is the largest and therefore in any significant economic downturn (ie lower
revenues) may cause them to violate their bank loan covenants.

SI has a detailed financial profile screen that shows a host of detailed
company statistics and ratios. Take a look at the "Financial Structure Ratio"
and "Per Share Figures" section for each company and you will notice SUV has a
negative free cash flow per share and the other two companies are positive.

SVU
http://si.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&cb=1227140491&symbol=NY ^SVU

SWY
http://si.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&cb=1227153782&symbol=NY ^SWY

KR
http://si.advfn.com/p.php?pid=financials&cb=1227156849&symbol=NY ^KR

By market cap SVU is the smallest of the three but one of the most efficient
operators and are know in the industry to have very good warehouse and
distribution logistics. SWY is 4x larger and KR is 8x larger but SVU is the
most profitable on a per share measure. In fact, they earn almost as much per
share as SWY with 1/4 the amount of sales!

SVU should be able to manage their current debt situation and in fact could
sell additional stores if they were forced to do so. The ones they cherry
picked from the Albertsons purchase are quite profitable and both KR and SWY
would be willing buyers since the individual stores are so profitable.

I suspect SVU could reduce their dividend if they felt they needed to preserve
cash. According to this article, grocery store revenues are in fact increasing
as customers are shopping more and eating out less due to the recession.

Grocers are retail's bright spot
Wednesday, November 19, 2008
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/19/BU4A1477HP.DTL

From the article:'...Grocery stores have emerged as a bright spot, posting
steady or increased sales at a time when almost all other areas - including
auto dealers, furniture retailers and department stores - reported significant
declines.

In last week's Commerce Department's monthly retail report, food and beverage
stores saw a 4.8 percent increase in October sales compared with the same month
last year..."

================================================================
My position is small in SVU but if it fall much more I may have to buy more
shares as I believe they will be a survivor.

I did buy some more DD today as it continued to sell off especially at the end
of the day. This is my solar play which is supposed to be a conservative way to
invest into the solar industry. With the way the market is falling, it feels
like their is no one conservative approach other than to sit on cash.

I now think that many of the super low PE's is Mr. Markets way of telling
everyone the the "E" is going to fall significantly in the future.

I don't have a clue. the European bank preferreds are propped up by politicians
that don't want them to default. if the politicians decide the preferred do
belong to the equity category (if new equity injections are necessary etc. )
then the preferreds could be toast.

HRP-pd and DLR-pd seem to have a lot of equity cushion before they default so i
hope they will hold and keep paying. Both are small bet's in REIT debt for me
and so far i don't like it one little bit. KIM down by 20%+ in one day seems
insane. I certainly feels like commercial RE is the next shoe to drop (or has

One big issue with RBS-N or most other bank preferreds are that they are non
cumulative. The bank is allowed to skip the dividend if they so choose without
triggering default or any other penalties. They do not owe you the dividend
later. There are certain protections in these such as that the bank cannot pay
common stock dividends if it skips preferred dividends. But common stock
dividends are already toast.

There are a few cumulative preferreds by HSBC and JPM where they can delay the
dividend but not skip it but they do not pay close to RBS-N.

Hi Paul,

A coupe months ago we discussed DSWL. You wrote this:

"DSWL. I agree with Jurgis Bekepuris.

The stock is at a very good buy point. As are so many stocks.

I've followed the company off and on for several years. I'm holding a few
shares now bought at higher prices. I'm not so willing to add more though now.

You're wondering how low the stock can go. In this market, it can go below net
cash. My guess guess though is that it won't. (Stock price being $2.40/sh., net
cash/sh per Yahoo being $1.45/sh.)."

I agreed with everything that you and Jurgis wrote. I can hardly believe it but
DSWL reached an intraday low of $1.91/sh. I have been a holder for some time
and bought more when we last spoke. This is getting ridiculous! It seems that
people are now pricing The End Of The World into their valuation models.

Unfortunately I also purchased some CIT at what I thought was a low but that
has proven to be incorrect. They recently announced that they are filing to
become a holding company which would allow them access to Treasury Bailout
Money but the new requirements might be a strain and who knows what the
surviving company will look like.

As far as my value picks I am holding/buying IR, TYC, TEL, NOK. These are all
companies that I had owned at higher prices and I have decided to simply trade
out the expensive shares with cheaper ones and continue holding.

Anyway, just thought I would check back in with a stock that we have discussed
before. Good investing.

I view SVU as being in a very competitive fight for grocery dollars. No one
company (among the three - KR, SWY, SVU) can be innovative enough or smart
enough to get a sustainable advantage over the other. There 'ought' to be
enough business and profits to sustain all of them though.

Paul,

If you really want a day job, try working with young school children as a
teacher, substitute teacher, bus driver, para professional, monitor, etc.

After the real estate market left me holding two units ( and tying up all of my
capital ), I took the plunge and reentered the job market at a old age.

I looked all over for a job to no avail.

As I was looking for a job in downtown Denver, I spied a school bus advertising
"Drivers needed". Since I drove a truck part time at the airport in an earlier
life, I had driving experience (and a CDL) and decided to apply for a school
bus driver job.

Boy was I pleasantly surprised, the children are the country's most precious
resource. I was tested by my middle school students. But I passed the test. I
threw a few of the hard cases off the bus about 3 miles from their drop off
location -- their attitude changed the next day. The bus bonehead was tossed in
addition to sent to the vice principal, he now takes another bus. I remembered
my awkward early teen years so I give most of the kids the benefit of the doubt
and only make them clean the bus when they misbehave.

The elementary students are a joy. I have a group that really like me. In
modern America, that is a serious lack of fathers and grandfathers. I noticed
when I coached my son's football team 10 years ago. Matters are worst now.
These boys and girls really become attached to older men. So I do my best to
teach them correct behavior and the difference between right and wrong. And
respect for others.

Paul, I worked in finance for 10 years and information technology for 15 years
and nothing compares to working with our youth. If you can not do it full time,
try part time volunteer work in your local schools. The children will
appreciate you. While the market is abusing you and me.

Best regards,

Carey Thompson

1 day left.

What I did today:

- Sold HRAY, CHNG and one micro cap.
- Bought some GU, GLW, SDTH, GPOR and SU.

I find myself agreeing a lot with Jim Rogers. IMHO, China is good, oil is good.
USA is tough to judge, but I am not as negative as gloom-and-doomers, so I
don't exclude it. It is a great time IMHO for China to find their own groove
and really decouple. Russia won't do it, they are essentially screwed. Brazil
probably won't do it, although there is a chance that they may. China has a
strong opportunity. India also although their path would be very different.

Thought a bit about strategy. At these prices, I am looking to buy stocks that
could go up 3X and not be overvalued. I may sell "safe" stocks that do not seem
to offer 3X appreciation potential (e.g. MMM, HANS, PEP) although these are
such "fortress" stocks, that I am not sure if I want to do that. Still need to
think.

Let's see what we get on Monday.

BRKB - good choice for safe stock, but not a huge return stock. Not going to
make 3x from here even if market bounces back. One risk is Buffett dying. Even
with his assurances, I cannot trust his successor. I still hold a little of BRK
and medium position of WSC.

I'll comment on your other suggestions later, need to get to another computer

I agree that BRKB is an outstanding buy at the moment, though that window may
be about to close and it will go back to being merely a good buy.

I stay out of ANF because Jeffries, the mad genius, scares me. I'm worried that
some day the "mad" part will bring him down. In retail, the stocks I really
like right now are AEO and URBN.

In banks I like WFC and EBAY. I'm only 10% kidding on the latter. I think that
the PayPal model is going to work well for them in this climate. BTW, I just
read somewhere that BRK and WFC are now the #1 and #2 financial institutions by
market cap.

In tech I like AMAT (another outstanding opportunity right now) ORCL, MSFT and
DELL. I'm terrible on short term predictions, so I should probably be ignored
on this but... one of the many reasons that AMAT is being beaten down is
because of the troubles in solar. I think that's about to change as the new
administration lays out its spending plans on alternative energy. That should
help AMAT and I think today's price is one that people will drool over within a
couple of months. As for ORCL and MSFT, at these levels they don't need to grow
- those license revenues just need to keep coming, and they will. With DELL
there are more fundamental questions, but there is a huge upside that
compensates for the moderate risk.

This is the first time in over 10 years that I'm really excited about the
opportunities in the stock market.

How many of those REITS are going to have to roll over debt this next year ?

none.

DRE
we already have enough liquidity to meet our needs for the next 18 to 24
months...Second, we have solid dividend coverage... our existing tenant base
remains extremely diversified and financially strong, as our delinquencies are
at near historic lows...

HRP
We continue to believe HRP's strong tenant base, limited near-term lease
expirations, strong balance sheet, current high annual dividend yield make HRP
a logical choice for long-term, income-oriented investors... I think we're
pretty stable in our markets, in those free markets in terms of where we are
with occupancy, we don’t have a lot rolling and the stuff we do have rolling I
feel pretty good about the renewals except maybe in Boston... It's always been
very important to the company to maintain its dividend.

CLP
Question: could you give us a little bit of color on the $340 million or so
that does mature in 2010; is that early in the year or late in the year and
what is that?

Answer: It’s essentially is one mark-to-market $275 million bond issue that
matures in February and then series of medium term notes that mature throughout
the rest of the year. As I mentioned we are pursuing this line with Freddie Mac
and Fannie Mae right now, that would cover those bond maturities...

We have a lot of capacity in our line right now and even after looking at the
unfunded construction commitments and still have almost $150 million of cash to
spend on either buying back securities are buying assets, and right now as we
look at it these preferreds that are trading at $13 a share, almost yield of
13% to 14% look ridiculously cheap and very attractive from a return
standpoint.

Their debt/equity ratios are 1.5 1.0 1.2 Those are low numbers for reits. A few
months ago we would all kill to have the chance to buy companies like these.
But that is true everywhere. I think the idea is that if the economy does
crash, I'd rather own the building than the company that went bust and moved
out of the building. These will still be good companies to own in 6 months when
things become less uncertain. The risks will be lower, but the prices will be
higher.

"At Joann Fabrics, the parking lot was full Monday afternoon, and lines were

Mark,

AEO is priced much less attractive than ANF. Furthermore - I will agree with
Morningstar - that AEO has no moat, while ANF has some. I would not buy URBN at
current price. It is priced for perfect continuing execution. Let me stress
this: I probably would not have bought URBN at current price even in regular
market. It is just a hold for "reasonable" markets. In the current market where
tons of profitable companies are selling below book and below net assets, I
will call it overpriced.

WFC - at this point I'd rather buy BRK/WSC. WFC is obviously a survivor, but I
don't think it is very cheap, so IMO it has a lot of risk if herd turns against
it. Bank is always only as good as the talk about it is.

EBAY - I never understood excitement about this company. It never earned more
than 11% ROE, while presumably having a press to print money. Sorry, I don't
see attractiveness now either. One could make arguments for and against it in
tough economic times, but I'd rather not spend my time on it.

AMAT and solar - I'd rather not base my investment on presumed policy. I
believe that oil companies are much more attractive than any solar investment.
But then you can call me biased. AMAT is a good company, but I don't think it
is very underpriced for current economic situation. I'd rather buy something
else.

MSFT and ORCL - both are solid companies and OK investments. Neither looks like
a 3X investment at this point. I have some MSFT, but I will just hold it (or
even sell it to buy something more attractive). They are safe as safe can be in
this market.

DELL is a bit tough to value since they bought back so many shares and their
equity is so small. Still I would agree with you that it may be an attractive
investment.

"MGA and TM are worth a look too as the two best balance sheets in the
automotive industry."

They might work as a bet on the auto industry. Assuming that GM and/or others
either go into bankruptcy and/or that new car sales continue at low levels,
these companies have the balance sheets to survive. One presumes there will be
demand for new cars and somebody, esp. TM, (maybe even MGA) will step up to
produce those vehicles.

My preference though is to take on a package of down-trodden suppliers given
that they are all risky (lots of debt), but on the assumption that if they
survive - or a few of them survive, the stocks as a package will outperform
either MGA or TM.

I have LEA, ALV, and now GT too. Just a few shares. If LEA makes it, for
example, it'll be a multibagger. That's a big IF, of course.

I am also partial to auto retailers - they have geographical diversity, company
and brand diversity, and several possible income streams (new car sales, used
car sales, repair work, collision work). I reentered

Hi Paul - Added a bit more SFL too. The company reports earnings 11/28/2008 and
should go xdividend @ $0.58/share. Their dividend is comprised of a fixed
amount (past several quarters was $0.50/quarter) and a profit sharing amount.
The company should continue to pay their fixed amount each quarter but the
profit sharing component may be less or even zero in 2009.

It will be interesting to see what their average fixed charter terms are. As of
June 30 2008 their gross fixed-rate charter backlog was in excess of $6.5
billion, with average remaining charter term of 10.2 years, or 13.4 years if
weighted by charter revenue. Some of their charters have purchase options,
which, if exercised, will reduce the fixed charter backlog and average
remaining charter term.

I am willing to bet that the BDI shupping rates will improve substantially from
the current all time lows and the stock will reflect a much higher value for
their locked in long term contracts.

The stock is still quite cheap especially if they benefit from an Obama
administration. The dividend still yields over 6%.

I only have a small position so a 30% gain is minor noise to the portfolio but
it's nice to see something work.

================================================================

I have been balancing the portfolio to generate a healthy dividend stream
ranking my holdings based on dividends generated and adjusting for future cuts.
I expect about 6% of my dividend payers to either cut or eliminate their
dividend in 2009. My strategy is to load up on companies that pay consistent
dividends and are historically undervalued using standard value measures (etc
PE). 20% of my top holdings make up about 90% of my dividend income. My equity
portfolio has a net yield of around 8% and when combined with my fixed income
and cash component my overall yield drops to around 6%.

My strategy is to over weight the portfolio with dividend paying stocks
(replacing non dividend or very low dividend stocks with those that yield 5% or
higher). I plan to maintain healthy cash and fixed income reserves so I can
continue to add shares over time. Periodically I will pick up a small cap non
dividend payer but feel that as long as these other opportunities exist, I
should focus on these first.

Therefore, I continue to sell off my non dividend losers (other than some
special situations) and focus on pruning a lot of my stragglers. This should
result in less stocks held and a more concentrated portfolio of undervalued
dividend paying equities that generate at least a 5%-6% dividend yield (up form
my previous 2%-3%).

Now that we might actually have four up days in a row (general market as
measured by DJI), I find myself unwilling or unable to step up to buy shares of
companies that have moved up from their lows. I am now so used to volatility, I
just expect to be able to get chances to make buys once again at stocks' lows.

I'm saying I agree with your comment:

"FSP is more attractive, but I am neutral on FSP at these prices."

I just look at the stock price now somewhat over $12/sh. and see that it was
$8-$9 just a few days ago. Figuring volatility isn't gone and I might get
another chance at this and other stocks, it is just too tough for me to really
look at it or step up for it, or for most other merely attractive stocks that
have jumped up.
===============================
I reread Grommit's quote on HRP and looked at the transcript. As of Nov 5
anyway, management says:

"We currently have about $2.9 billion of debts outstanding, which represents a
conservative 48% of total assets. We have no significant maturities until 2011.
We continue being compliance with all debt covenants, and we currently have
ample room under these same covenants.

As of September 30th, we had $303 million outstanding on our $750 unsecured
revolving credit facility. This facility is provided by diverse group close to
30 participating banks and matures in August 2010. We currently paid interest
at LIBOR plus 55 basis points. At our sole option, we have the right to extend
this revolver to one additional year through 2011...

...Assuming all the (in-process) sales occurred as scheduled (Edit: That could
be a wrong assumption these days -g-) and we used the proceeds from the sales
to repay our revolver. We have the full $750 million available under our
revolver in 2009. Unlike some of our competitors, the HRP is in excellent
liquidity position and we are well prepared to take advantage of unique
opportunities to build long-term value for all stakeholders in our company."

=============
Although I'm not so sure exactly what I am reading in the above paragraphs, it
does (as designed) leave me with the impression I don't need to be worried
about HRP's leverage through '09, maybe '10.
----------------
I sense that all these commercial property company stocks are beat down to
levels not seen in a decade or more. They can't all go out of business. (??)
Otoh, maybe they all can eliminate their dividends. I'm betting that stock
prices are so low that business declines and dividend cuts are mostly baked
into the prices. HRP I'm not so familar with. FR, FCEA -- I just can't believe
or can't comprehend that they'll go under. Although Mr. Market says there's a
probability that they will.

ASH. Does seem odd, although...in this market so much is.

Hercules shareholders were fortunate to have received cash for most of their
shares instead of ASH stock.

I'm not sure I've got this correctly, but here goes: ASH valued the Hercules
deal at $2.4B. ASH spent their large cash balance and also incurred debt of
$.7B to do the deal. With ASH stock down now, ASH enterprise value is maybe
(market cap + net debt) approx. $.67B + $.7B = $1.37B. So the combo ASH +
Hercules at $1.37B is worth about 1/2 of what Hercules itself was valued at
earlier ($2.4B)?

Of course, value (strategic value, esp.) is in the eye of the beholder. Maybe
ASH needed glasses. Or perhaps an operative word is "earlier": Everything was
valued higher a few months earlier.

I'll consider ASH, but I'm skeptical of the business prospects, the synergies,
the debt. "Small starter" would be the way for me too, if I do anything.

I searched the reit universe and these have the lowest debt ratios, and all
claim to have no unusual occupancy issues. That may change, but I can handle a
temporary dividend reduction, if needed.

Most residential REITs are paying under 10%. CLP (80% residential) at today's
18% is a steal. A bigger steal over the past few days. I bought a ton. Same
thing with office and mixed reits. Some have similar yields but their debt
ratios are much higher. Few (if any?) have as low debt as these. I figure
residential is much less risky than office, and deserves a lower yield. That's
the way they always have traded.

Here is more detail for the lazy: CLP earned 41 cents last qtr based on rents
alone (excludes property sales & development). So the dividend of 25 cents is
well covered. Additional special dividends are expected. The other two reits
dividends are not as well protected with earnings. But again, they say that all
is well. We will see in a few months when 2009 outlooks are issued.

Forced selling or something made these steals last thursday. They still are.
Prices might get whacky again, but even if they do, locking in a nice 18% or
32% yield is something that does not come around often.

column one is the div yield based on closing price last thursday.
two is yield based on todays price

you can borrow 80% of NAV). The concern with commercial real estate is that the
default of the weaker companies or REITS sets up a forclosure cascade that
brings down RE values, similar to what is happening in residential RE.

So I am not buying the totally irrational market. Even if a REIT is home free
for two years in terms of financing - if RE prices fall until then such that
mortgages are not available (due to lack of coverage) it is going to be game
over for a lot of those entities we are looking at.

FWIW I expect this XMAS season to be abysmal. CNBC today was talking about -5%
GNP growth in the 4th quarter (annualized). -10% would constitute a depression
per most definitions so we are almost 1/2 way there. If -5% is the bottom than
we are fine but if things spiral down from here we do have a real risk of a
depression that is closer to a 1930's depression style than a 1982 or 1974
recession which were deep but short lived.

I hope it never comes to this, but the recent rally does not dispel my
concerns. I raised quite a bit of cash during he last 2 days because I think we
are going to bear quite a bit of bad news soon.

" I am not that sure that Armageddon will not come. The concern with commercial
real estate is that the default of the weaker companies sets up a foreclosure
cascade that brings down RE values, similar to what is happening in residential
RE."

good points. i'll have to consider it...

the cause/effect of the current residential housing mkt is falling values (and
other issues) cause defaults, and then a cycle. I think you are saying that in
commercial, that vacancies would cause value drops, then defaults, then a
cycle.

but if a debt burdened entity defaulted, some other entity would pick up the
pieces and carry on. they do not automatically lower the rent, and the bankrupt
stockholders get liquidation value. i am finding huge tangible book values in
excess of stock prices -- over 4x for CLP and HRP, for example. I am not sure
that covers armageddon, but for that scenario, cash is the only investing
option.

commercial values only fall when occupancy / rents / and profits fall, not with
a liquidity default. so i do not see a cycle of defaults causing more and more
value drops. ownership change does not produce a reduction of rent and property
value. And residential occupancy rates are not at risk of huge occupancy swings
as office property is. People move out of apts all the time and they are
replaced as a normal course of business. Maybe at lower rent or other
incentives. An economic contraction shrinks apartment demand less than office
demand.

I believe the debt ratios of these companies provide a cushion. HRP at 1:1, for
example, can survive a huge slump. They have $2.9B of debt and $2.9B of equity.
They could borrow another $1 billion and be 1.3 debt/equity. One year of rents
is only $800 million. They could collect no rents for a year and still pay the
dividend. [That's a joke, but theoretically possible.] The point is, they will
not be one of the bankrupt entities.

who knows?
I still have 21% cash and 14% utilities.

Thanks for the note. Everything up in the air on ASH. For me, its merely an
attempt at an oversold bounce play, not a long term investment as I'm
unimpressed with ASH management, and the latest report shows a real potential
for continued demand destruction in some of there markets. I'll likely get out
rather quickly if the current market rally doesn't lead to some gains in the
stock soon. If it does, I'll likely take some percentage gain relatively soon.

I'm very tired of trying to trade and bottom fish in a market that so far
remains bearish, and is punctuated by nutty rallies where a stock gains 40 or
50 or even 100% in a few days. Maybe seasonably we are in the right time for a
rally, but those I listen to say its still a bear market rally, with which I
agree. How far and how long it can go is open to question, but when they do
roll over again, it aint gonna be pretty. Never is.

Jim Rogers was also on TV and his words for our Government were extremely
harsh, calling the bailouts an unmitigated disaster and total complete

it might not be as nutty if you look at the price, if a stock goes down from 10

Hi Grommit - Colonial Properties Trust (CLP) looks interesting but I do not
like their regional exposure for their real estate holdings, specifically for
their residential portfolio ( http://colonialprop.com/residential/ ). They
appear to have heavy exposure in Texas and North & South Carolina . Their mixed
use and commercial property exposure also includes several projects in Florida
which may be impacted more than other regions if we have a prolonged recession.

It's hard to determine from their web page their costs and revenues on their
different projects to determine if any one region is impacting their total
portfolio holdings. Finally, from a cursory inspection, many of their projects
seem to have been built within the last five years which indicates that the
company has a relatively high acquisition cost when compared to other more
established REITs like HRP. Therefore, BV may be overstated for CLP and
significantly understated for HRP.

That said, I did notice some very large and recent insider Buys for CLP (
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=CLP ) which indicates to me that management
believes the stock is quite undervalued.

Both FIRST IND RLTY INC (NYSE:FR) and HRPT PROPERTIES (NYSE:HRP) are of
interest to me as these companies have several properties that were acquired
years ago with a very low cost basis. http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FR,HRP&d=s

Although these companies have levered up on debt in the last five years, they
are working down their exposure to more reasonable levels. So far, rental
incomes remain stable w/ good (staggered) long term leases while vacancy rates
remain low (about 5%).

The only insider buying I have seen is for FR of 1 million shares by SHIDLER
JAY H a director during November 2008 ( http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=FR ) at
prices between $5.50/share and $6.00/share. That's a lot of skin in the game
for a director.

I have CLP on my watch list. When calculating my dividend income for 2009, I
have cut my REIT income amounts by 50% so I will not be too disappointed on any
future dividend cuts.

My understanding is that the bailout money comes from thin air and is created
as needed. There is no accountability on those receiving the money, never will
be. Just AIG getting more and throwing a couple of extra parties here and
there. We are led to believe that we are all now shareholders in these
companies, us, the taxpayers. I still have not received my stock certificates
though. In any event, it matters little whether I receive them or not. Forced
stock ownership in weakling Companies that have poor managements and could
never have survived without aid is not my idea of a good investment. Many think
that also matters little, because value is what the Government decides, not
what the market decides. Something about unlimited capital and bailouts just
not sitting well with me. Temporary band aids at best with long term fatal
consequences at worst.

REIT. Here is some data I have on a few reits. TBV is tangible book value. Pls
let me know of any errors in the data.

I am avoiding FR and LXP due to debt levels. BDN may be OK. BDN says that the
new lower dividend is "very secure", financing is secure thru 2009, and that
lease renewals for 2009 are on schedule. (Others say 2009 lease renewals are
minimal, which sounds better.)

I agree with not being thrilled by CLP's geographical concentration, and their
retail exposure. But their payout ratio is grand. Nothing is perfect.

If you are going to invest, you have to assume that there will not be an
economic meltdown. Otherwise, hold cash.

BDN - discussed here many times before. Ages ago i compared BDN with CLI, the
less leveraged sister stock and pointed out that CLI is cheaper when accounting
for leverage (based on EV/EBITDA) and that is still true: CLI trades at and
EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.7 while BDN trades at 10.0. So unless you are very bullish
on commercial real estate I recommend CLI over BDN. On an unlevered basis BDN
could go to zero and CLI would still be cheaper <ng>.

NNBR: A buy imo. Sorry I've not spotted it few days earlier at lower prices.
I'll chance it'll drop back from Friday's prices and I'll get a shot at the
lower prices. Timken's worth watching too, now I see. (So many companies could
be on a watch list, it's overwhelming -g-.)

These are specialty steel companies - I categorize them as bearing
manufacturers (ball bearings/roller bearings/etc.). They are generally
profitable and generally (except now, NNBR) pay a dividend. The thing with them
- imo - is that their components are necessary in a wide variety of
manufactured products but these components are only a very very small part of
the overall cost-of-goods of their customers' finished goods. My operating
assumption is that this means the bearing companies don't get beat up so much
on bearing prices by their customers. I suspect customer relationships -
ability to delivery quantity &quality and ability to design or to meet special
technical requirements are often more significant than cost (in normal times).
That has been my assumption in buying these companies in the past, anyway.

Of course as we see, when manufacturing is down or expected to be down
everywhere, demand for bearings is reduced too. A cycle that eventually - I
hope and expect - will have an upside.

I'll place an open order for TKR and NNRB at lower prices.

I'm considering the high-yield ("junk") bond market now. Is there anybody here
following any of the funds in this sector with an opinion to share regarding
these?

Right now I'm considering Fidelity's FAGIX and looking to compare it to its
competitor funds. Opinions/suggestions welcome. Here's what I posted on the
Fidelity Subject thread:

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25214686

If the fund price will just stabilize (majority of bonds not deteriorate
further), and if the fund managers continue their investments and get the
distributions they are getting from these bonds, the yield to me (cash return
on fund purchase) seems to be about 13.5%. I would live with that in this
market. If the economy would ever get better, and inflation not be roaring, the
yields shrink of course, but the fund price could/should/might revert to mean.

REIT's there is something wrong with commercial real estate and it's not just
the REIT prices.

http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2008/11/26/a-90s-flashback-for-commercial-prope
ty/

Some where I read in the WSj that some AAA mortgages were yielding 14% ! I do
understand that AAA probably does not man much at this point. I also found that
senior debt of prime REIT's trades at almost 12% yield. So there is clearly a
substantial cost of capital issue with REIT's. Since most REIT's operate with
cap rates in the single digit's it is apparent that REIT's cannot earn their
cost of capital if current conditions persist for a significant time.

If commercial real estate indeed goes downhill there is a lot of pain for banks
ahead as well and this time it's going to hit many smaller banks as well. I
have no idea how this is going to work out.
