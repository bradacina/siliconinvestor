Profits are good,yes. But no one on this thread should've profited from ABIX
because there was no good reason for a value investor to buy this stock. (imo)

A value investor couldn't have anticipated the exclusive agreement, let alone
the effect of its announcement tripling the stock. (Or perhaps I am missing
clues from the 10K? If so, no one here or on Yahoo (as I recall) reported this
opportunity at the time the stock was mentioned here.)

I can say though that if there is anybody in this stock, congratulations on
your good luck!!

Paul Senior says: <ABIX>... there was no good reason for a value investor to
buy this stock.

I disagree. If a company with consistent positive earnings and numerous years
of over 15% ROE trading at 0.15 PSR (before jump) is not a value buy, I don't
know what is. Maybe biotechs and other companies mentioned here that never had
any income.

However, since I did not buy it, I will shut up from here.

The way I look at it is that all distributors have low price to sales ratios,
so if a psr number is used as a measurement metric with distributors, it has to
be looked at in the company's historical context. In that regard, the psr
number you mentioned is okay imo - there were some years where the psr number
was higher, some years lower. For me, the .15 number is not low enough to
interest me. (I don't much use psr numbers with distributors - only a deciding
event if the psr figure is outstandingly low.)

As regards ROE, the company does have a good ROE history. That's a big
positive. No question. Those good numbers have to be weighed against the stock
price though. Because otherwise companies with high ROE and a history of it,
would be considered value stocks at any price they sold at.

I concluded after I scanned the company and weighed the things that I saw that
interested me, that for me the buy price I determined I'd pay would've been
somewhat below the current price at the time- as I stated essentially.
Otherwise, I was aware of no good reason or information to influence a decision
in the buy direction.

But you are right: Perhaps there were value investors who did have good reasons
to buy. I only should speak for myself, and because I see it one way, doesn't
make it the correct way.

Sorry, maybe I was a bit jumpy on you.

I thought that the expected return as measured against stock price and ROE was
good. However, I did not understand the business enough to figure out whether
current downturn was temporary or not. That's why I did not buy. Now hindsight
is 20-20. :/

BTW, I don't think ABIX is a distributor... :) But I don't use PSRs much anyway

Interesting story in NYT on Diller going after Cendant's Silverman. Cendant
(CUC) trial starts tomorrow.

Snip:

Now Mr. Diller is on the offensive. He is taking aim at the heart of Mr.
Silverman's domain: residential real estate. Having bought LendingTree.com and
RealEstate.com, Mr. Diller's company, InterActiveCorp, has linked mortgage
brokering on the Web with Internet real estate referrals, using commission
discounts as a lure. No one has more at stake from real estate commissions than
Cendant, which controls more than 25 percent of the brokerage business through
its Century 21, Coldwell Banker and ERA franchises.

It is a clash of two of the country's most energetic and creative deal makers,
both now in their early 60's and running unconventional conglomerates from
offices a block apart on West 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan. They took very
different paths to get to this fight over several of the same businesses. Mr.
Diller, flamboyant and impulsive, is a college dropout and former Hollywood
executive who was born and raised in California. He is using his experience in
selling jewelry on television and concert tickets by phone to find a way to use
the Web to sell hotels, houses and more. Mr. Silverman, more serious and
disciplined, is an Ivy League-educated lawyer who was born in New York City. He
built and must now defend a conglomerate that has become a master at finding
new ways to wring cash from old businesses with established brand names like
Avis and Howard Johnson.

At stake, in addition to personal pride, are lucrative slices of a very large
market. About $1.5 trillion worth of homes changed hands last year; each
percentage point of market share that LendingTree can get is worth $150 million
a year.

....

"The real story of the Internet," Mr. Smith said, "is not how you displace the
real estate broker, but how you displace classified advertising."

That is much the same lesson learned by most of the other online real estate
ventures. "Microsoft, Yahoo, everyone and their brother poured a lot of money
into real estate," said Brad Inman, a longtime publisher of real estate trade
news. "They come in starry-eyed and say these Realtors are idiots. They spend a
lot of money. And they realize they can't unlock the role of the Realtor. So
they get out."

The Web has a role in real estate. Three-quarters of home buyers do turn to the
Internet, studies show. But they look at listings and learn about
neighborhoods. Then they turn to brokers to visit homes and negotiate their
deals. Mr. Diller wants to build a business hooking up Web shoppers with
brokers.

....

"No amount of big thinking I have ever done prepared me for how big they think
at IAC," Mr. Lebda said, referring to InterActiveCorp.

It's a classic falling knife, sometimes we know what happens with those.
Pros:
A very high quality blue chip, market share (still) leader, in a growing
industry. Excellent balance sheet (over 2:1 current ratio, a very small amount
of debt on the books). About $3/share cash on the books. Introducing multiple
new models by years end to plug holes in the product portfolio.
By virtually any technical measure, the stock is deeply oversold.
Cons:
Missed the boat on the clamshell craze, and needs to ramp up new models to fill
in the gaps on this miss - can they do this in a timely fashion? This will most
likely result in at least two more quarters of declining sales and EPS, and
contracting margins.
Can't think of too many other cons (the aforementioned are certainly daunting
on their own) except for the standard external shock possibility which would
curtail consumer spending.

Some nice moves in many of your stocks mentioned, Grommit.

I'm interested in HKF now. Do you (or anybody else here) have a current opinion
on it? It's still not in the bargain range (for me), but close.

Although same store sales have been down, the company seems to be making a lot
of good moves (imo):

"TUPELO, Miss.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 27, 2004--The Board of Directors of
Hancock Fabrics, Inc. ... increased the quarterly cash dividend to 12 cents per
share, a 20% increase from the previous dividend rate of 10 cents...
Larry G. Kirk, Hancock's Chief Executive Officer said, 'Hancock Fabrics' cash
flows have historically been sufficient to fund the necessary investments in
our store and distribution operations, while also paying meaningful cash
dividends and purchasing substantial amounts of treasury stock. The most recent
year was no exception, even though the $22 million in capital expenditures in
2003 was the Company's highest due to the new distribution center and the
implementation of store point-of-sale systems in 160 stores. In addition,
Hancock opened 28 new stores, repurchased almost $10 million of treasury
shares, paid over $7 million of cash dividends, and temporarily increased the
level of high-turn basic inventory to ensure that stores would be replenished
during the relocation of distribution operations to the new D/C.'"

Maybe cap expenditures and p.o.s. systems outlays will now be substantially
diminished, thus increasing bottom line earnings.

I don't know this business well enough. It seems to me that for home sewing and
fabrics associated therewith, that there are basically two prime choices?? The
person goes to their local Jo-An or Hancock which have a national (more or
less) presence. Or else the choice is a local mom-n-pop - if there is one.
Maybe we're dealing here with a duopoly in a declining market?

Sold remainder of my TSU position, bought TMB.
Switched to TMB since TSU has been strong while TMB has been weak. TMB also has
a strong balance sheet, and generates stron FCF. It is one of the few
independent local operators (TCN is another one) with one of the highest market
shares (58%). From Q4 2002 to Q4 2003, TMB had a FCF of about 300M Real,
equivalent to roughly 100M$. Based on roughly 600M$ market cap, this is a FCF
yield of 16.7%!. Currently, the company is investing very little, obviously but
the migration to GSM is imminent about 350M Real need to be invested in the
Network. I don't think it will be a problem for TMB to do this. I think the
shares have been under pressure because TMB decided to accelerate the
depreciation of the existing network from 12%/year to 25%/year due to the
migration to GSM, which affects net profit but not cash flow. I think this will
be temporary as the network will be depreciated in a very short time and since
I tend to value FCF more so than net earnings, I consider this not that much of
an issue.

All in all, this seems to be a good bet on its own, even without the takeover
appeal. I plan to add to my position , if the stock goes down some more.

Snips:

Sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2004, totaled $20.8 million,
compared with $20.9 million in the same quarter last year. Net earnings for the
second quarter were $1.1 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared with net
earnings of $1.2 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the same period a year
ago.

 As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 42.8%, compared to 38.8% in the
second quarter of fiscal 2003. Product mix, which included strong sales in the
parts and upgrades product lines, contributed to the increase in gross profit
percentage in the second quarter compared to the prior-year period.

"Despite the year-over-year decline in orders for the second quarter, we do not
believe that this indicates a fundamental degradation in our markets or our
competitive position. During the quarter, we experienced a sizable increase in
quote volumes compared to last year. The quote volume is encouraging, and we
believe the delayed order placements reflect our customers becoming more
conservative as the year has progressed," said Morton.

"We have customer commitments for a number of trial installations this summer
that will allow us to prove the performance of newly developed products or of
current products in new applications. Some of these placements could become
orders this fiscal year pending successful performance and are important tests
of future prospects for new revenues. In addition, the Company is finalizing
plans to add sales and service offices in certain international markets,
including China. We continue to believe that a local presence is critical to
capitalizing on international opportunities, which are an important part of our
growth strategy."

Oops, not a good day for GTI holders. This carbon electrode supplier to the

here.

I'm underwater on my yr. 2000 buys, but still in positive territory with my
10/2001 buys. Overall, losing now.

I'm considering adding. With steel booming, GTI's products have to be in
demand. They say in their press release, "all of our graphite electrode
manufacturing facilities, including Brazil, are currently running at capacity
and we remain sold out." However, earnings disappointed, and for '04 they say,
"We expect annual earnings, excluding restructuring charges, antitrust reserve
adjustment and other expense, net, to be in the range of $0.55 - $0.65 per
share."

I suspect at current price now ($11.40), that's still a bit high. Fwiw, GTI has
a technical component that has a relationship to Ballard Power, so this stock
could bloom if battery power vehicles grab investor attention again. They also
have something to do with Sony laptops where GTI supplies a "thermal spreader
product". Whatever that is. (Sounds like a manure spreader to me -g-)

If there's anybody here who'll look at this stock and like it at the current

Bought TRO another wireless Brazilian telecom. A very strong FCF generator (FCF
yield >10%), modern CDMA network (TMB has still the upgrade to GSM in front of
them), part of the nation wide TIVO network. TRO is net cash positive. The
downside is that it operates in an region with higher wireless penetration, so
growth prospect are less than TMB. On the other hand the company seems to
defend it's market share well and should be able to grow going forward. I like
the Brazilian wireless telecoms and buy them on dips.

SPOP.OB one of Crossy's picks. Dinky little company in the health food sector
with checkered past. Situated in my neck of woods in Petaluma/CA. Strong top
line growth but bottom line lags. The company needs to improve it's operating
margin, plain and simple. So far I consider the company mismanaged. I am
betting that may be able to ride the health food wave and do better going
forward. Or may be the stock will just do me a favor and spike like so many
other microcaps and allow me to make a profit :-).

OVNT - no changes there. Stock has been creeping upwards, while fellow truckers
ABFS and YELL have not done well. I think OVNT is a better company but it's
hard to tell, given the limited operating history. I wanted to sell something
and a worse risk/reward ratio than my other stocks, IMO. I would like to get

positive news (such as capture of Osama?) to test and trigger a final
confirmation of a 15-25% sell-off, we shall see...

Grommit, what follows is an update to a post I found on car "manufacturers" as
I was checking posts here today for Honda info. (I'm considering adding more to
my exploratory HMC position.):

DaimlerChrsler had a nice bump Friday. Still, it wasn't enough to let it beat
RACN's performance over the past year.
(Thread note: RACN changed name, & symbol became RCRC)

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=RCRC&t=1y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=dcx

I don't have DCN anymore. I was late coming to RCRC; to me the stock seems like
a maybe-hold at this point: I'm not willing to add more shares at this price.
Be interested in seeing what value investors here who bought are doing with
their RC2 shares now.

RCRC - sold 1/3 of mine last week. I think it's a decent "hold".

Since I mentioned ERES last week, they came out with nice earnings and outlook.
The conf call was exceptional. In addition to the 2004 outlook below, the board
is confident in 50% revenue and earning growth in 2005.

"The company also raised its estimates for the full year. It now expects
revenues of $114 million to $116 million, exceeding the company's previous
guidance of $107 million to $109 million. The revised guidance represents at
least a 70% increase in revenues from the full year 2003. It also expects full
year diluted earnings per share of $0.88 to $0.90, exceeding previous guidance
of $0.82 to $0.84."

The FDA is recommending that clinical trials in the future be monitored by this
technology. ERES is the mkt leader.

from company website:
The Company is a market leader in providing centralized electrocardiographic
(diagnostic) services and a leading provider of technology and services
designed to streamline the clinical trial process by enabling its customers to
automate many parts of a clinical trial.

In October 2003 the FDA urged companies to include QT studies during Phase I
trials. The FDA also recommended that ECG data be funneled though centralized
ECG processing labs. This is exactly what ERES does.

Not a value play. And at $34 now (was under $30 when I posted last week), I
don't know if it is a good deal. But I am happy to be holding it -- as a long
term growth stock holding.

HoyaSaxa, reflecting a bit on your idea of HINKY which spurred my look at BUD,
I decided I do like BUD around current price.

Of course BUD is the dominant American brewer with about 50% market share. I
was surprised to notice that BUD hasn't really participated in the market rally
of the past year,
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=BUD&t=2y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=
yet there's been no glitch in its string of good performance numbers.

Price to book is outrageous (high), and price to sales is high at under 3.
Certainly a current p/e of 21 doesn't indicate any bargain. It seems, further,
that profit margins which have moved up from about 8.6 to 14.7% over the decade
are now back down at a bit over 12%.

Putting those numbers in some context, Bud's average p/e has been over 21 from
'98 to '03 (but about 19.8 in '03), and its psr has averaged over 3 in '00
through '03. The forward pe estimate (per Yahoo)is 17 - that would be a number
not seen as an average since '95-'96. BUD has had eight years of consecutive
earnings growth and 22 consecutive years of dividend increases.

Perhaps BUD is in the process of receiving a permanent p/e revision (down). On
the one hand, I'm not surprised; I've suspected the beer market is saturated
(-g-, sorry). OTOH, I remember studies in '71 that said that (& that kept me
out of beer stocks), and BUD has done just fine since then.

I see now that some value type investors have positions in BUD, and they may
have started those somewhere around the current price. (Nygren of Oakmark Fund,
Eby of Torray.)

I will bet that Bud will continue its dominance, that regardless of inflation
or deflation beer drinkers will drink (and BUD will supply them world-wide with
its diverse brands and various brews - low carb, etc), and that at some point,
good profits, good profit margins and other good numbers will attract people
(more funds) into the stock, and a 24 p/e number might return. It's my guess
that unless the market crashes, if a person wanted to be in this brewer,
somewhere around the current price is a reasonable entry point.

Jmo, and I've been very wrong on beer stocks before (sold RKY too soon, failed
to buy LQU too many times), and I could be very wrong again.

Excluding one-time items, Sonic posted earnings of $22.4 million, or 53 cents

Analysts had expected the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company to report
earnings of between 45 cents and 51 cents per share, with an average estimate
of 48 cents per share, according to Reuters Research, a unit of Reuters Plc.

Sonic attributed part of the earnings gains to its efforts to cut costs,

I bought a small position of UTMD though I probably missed most of the upside.
I had it for some time around 97 then got tired waiting and sold.

Right now it is a cash cow. They are raking in profits, buying back shares like
hell and not doing much else. I think that at some point they will just go
private. Is there an upside until then? Unclear. It is not very cheap and tough
to evaluate. For example they just got ~$4 per share in cash from Tyco patent
infringement settlement. It is not clear whether they will use it to just buy
back shares or whether they will do something more. On the other
hand the cash inflow is high, especially if they don't squander the cash they
already have.

Overall I wanted to have a position to see what happens from here. It is
somewhat a bet on management integrity, since they could waste all cash or take
company private at discount. From the last couple years though I think
that they are treating shareholders fairly.

A sell-off is underway ...

The model reached "critical level" the day after Microsoft released earning
report. It held
well and clearly told me that was the technical top. Now we are confirmed on
the downtrend,
however there could be rallies and my model will continue to detect the
strength of those, it will
give me signal way before any significant reversal of the big downtrend.

Shorting stocks is the most difficult task in stock market and has unlimited
risk. I am still
practicing the skills and far from mastering it. It is not for people who don't
manage investment
full time, and not for most of the people who do investing fulltime. However it
is the best way
to achieve long-term outstanding results since we will be in a trading range in
the next decade or
two. The 25-50% move we saw last year will be typical every 2-3 years, both on
upside and
downside. That's why people entrust money to those great hedge fund managers. I

Steve168,

Just my opinion, but your model and your approach are too risky for my
appetite. I know that at some point you said you were looking for investors ---
I would be very careful applying this approach to other people's money. You are
buying and shorting extremely volatile stocks based on very short term factors.
Mechanized technical models are quite risky if used by themselves on volatile
stocks, and markets can change such that a mechanized model that has worked
well for years may no longer work in the future.

Stocks may be overvalued right now, but the basic value approach has proven
time and time again to work. Black box approaches to investing have proven time
and time again to blow up.

Your market calls seem to have been basically right so far aside from a glitch
or two (for example, your model was short term bullish on Feb 5 and the market
dropped from there), so maybe you will prove me wrong. I actually tend to agree
with you that tech stocks are overvalued (I thought they were when you were
still touting ALVR), but I am not going to short them --- I like to sleep well
at night, and I can do that with value investing.

Not trying to discourage you, just trying to provide a word of advice ...

MC

PS: In addition to my personal value investing, I work separately for a hedge
fund. We short stocks, but would never take naked short positions like you are
considering, trying to predict the market.

• as of 12/31/03 - equity of $1.2 bill; or book value of $2.67/share
• from 12/31/02 to ’03 - total revs increased from $180.5 to $226.4 mill; net
inc from $22.0 mill to $71.9 mill
• for 1/4 ending 3/26/04 - repurch 3.3 mill shs of stock; part of $263 mill
since ’02; or 29.7 mill shs; avg of $8.86 per sh
• projected eps for ’04 of .59 to .79
• as of 3/26/04 - customer margine bal of $3.8 bill
• for 1/4 ending 3/26/04 - eps .19 vs. .02 last yr; for 6 month - eps of .35 vs
.07
• me - i think amtd’s eps continues to grow; both from trading commissions; and

MC, I sincerely appreciate your word of advice, a caution note is very helpful
when my model is working so well (I bought several hundred contracts of QQQ May
39 puts average $2.05, as I mentioned in my other posting a week ago, as well
as shorting RIMM, SOHU, etc), and that's what a friend should do.

First of all, I have to admit that I was fooled by Mr. market for couple weeks
early this year, and had a few small miss-steps. I was swamped by the
enthusiasm around ALVR, WiMax and EONC, and made some relatively small
purchases of those stocks at high prices. But after it went nowhere on the
positive recommendations by media, I start to realize this excitement could be
a trap, and when it started to trend down, I started selling. My year 2000
experience (too late to sell) is also a big contributor to the sell decision.
So I sold most of ALVR starting at 15, and as low as 12. Given I have only 20%
long position now, I think I have escaped the big trap if the market continue
to go down.

Secondly, I agree with you, and I have been managing OPM very conservatively,
without shorting those individual high volatility stocks such as RIMM, SOHU,
CA, PCSA. That portfolio is 80% cash now waiting for opportunity to go long. I
still keep several personal accounts that I test and fine-tune different
investment strategies, and I did short those stocks and buy QQQ puts there. I
have developed 10 disciplines in past 5 years regarding shorting, such as only
have very diversified small positions in each stock to reduce risk. I have keen
interest in studying short since it is very closely related to market top, and
very helpful to determine the top. Short squeeze (as we saw in TASR, RIMM,
ZIXI) is the most obvious sign of extreme speculation, and market most likely
top when those bubbles burst, as we saw in past couple weeks.

Regarding my "black box model" - I am referring to a very specific model that I
developed over the years to determine a market top. You may have seen I turned
bearish in late 2003, then a reversal. Those were the minor signals, just to
tell me to be careful and nimble. There was never a "sell-off" signal until
April 23, 2004 the day after Microsoft reported earning. That's why I sent the
email "We are approaching a serious sell-off" on 4/19, and notified investors
on 4/24 regarding the confirmation reading of the serious sell-off. This
model's last "Self-off" signal was March 2002.

In the war of money, I use different weapons in my arsenal depends on the
market situation. For example, I am a hard core value investor when value is
easy to find, such as putting 25% of my money in ALVR when it was trading at
1.86 with $3.3 in cash, no debt, and I went to China to see their operation and
talk to customers, know they are the market share leader in a potentially
explosive industry. You may remember I told you ALVR was my number one holding
in a post on this thread on Feb 18, 2003. The positive development keep coming
in 2003 and I was able to hold on due to the model had no top signal, and those
leaders normally continue to run in a bull market. When it comes to Q1 of 2004,
there is no value in the market and I don't do value investing any more trying
to pick the "relatively undervalued stocks", because past experience taught me
those 80 cents dollar could easily become 50 cents dollar in a down market. I
hoarded cash in the conservative portfolio, and shorted QQQ and some individual
stocks in aggressive portfolios. In the overvalued market, I give more weight
to technical analysis, and several models including that "market top model". I
know I am trying to do something that seems impossible but I simply liked the
challenge, and so far I am sitting on over 200% return in 2003 and a positive
2004, if market continue to go down as my model told me, I will continue make
money while it go down. I have done some very difficult things before,
including scoring the highest in China's SAT in a city with 1M population and
being the only high school graduate (in that city) admitted to one of the most
prestiged university in China - Tsinghua Univ. in Beijing. Later in college I
was honored as one of the most outstanding student and reported as a cover page
story on Beijing Daily, as well as China Youth Daily and other media. I like
competition and challenge, especially in a fair one such as US stock market,
and I could potentially be on something big here.

I hope you don't see me as arrogant or bragging, I am trying to be as sincere
and honest as possible since you are giving me a very sincere advice.

Good luck investing in the tough 2004!

Madharry, do you get free Level II with Fidelity? In my opinion, unless you are
a very active trader, even a $5 difference in commissions is immaterial. It is
products (free Level II) and service (when you have a problem) that make a
difference worth far more than a few bucks on a trade. I have Ameritrade Plus,
which is the successor to National Discount Brokers, which they acquired some
time ago. I pay a negotiated $15 for any trade (limit, market, or through a
live broker) and have an assigned personal broker to handle any issues - and he
does a good job. I also have negotiated a margin rate of Prime - 1/4%, which is

Buffett always has said wait for the right pitch. He has also talked in the
context of 20 such pitches in a lifetime of investing. That means one every 1
1/2 to 2 years. That is my standard. I don't give a cr*p what the overall
market is doing. I look for that one every two year idea, that really appeals
to me and is worth investing a meaningful amount of money into. I also look at
it as a long term investment in the company and will do nothing as long as the
company performs to expectations and does not get ludicrously overvalued (sell
some) or undervalued (buy some more).

My style is to buy a XICO between 1994 and 2002 various times with an average
cost under $3, sell a little here and there and write some calls, and finally
get an exit strategy handed up by ISIL in a buyout near $15.

Buffett Joins Kerry Campaign as Economic Advisor
52 minutes ago Add Politics - Reuters to My Yahoo!

By Philip Klein

OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett (news - web sites), the world's second
wealthiest person, said on Sunday he had joined Democratic presidential
candidate John Kerry (news - web sites)'s economic advisory team.

Buffett has long been a critic of the tax policies of the Bush administration,
which he believes favor the wealthy and big corporations over the middle class.

"I'm available if anyone wants to ask my view of anything," Buffett said of his
involvement with Kerry at a news conference in Omaha, Nebraska, a day after the
annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. .

Buffett said Kerry had asked him three weeks ago if he would be part of an
economic advisory council that includes Robert Rubin, who was Treasury
Secretary in the Clinton administration. Buffett said he had accepted.

Buffett, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at $42.9 billion, said he was
not likely to have much contact with Kerry and expected to play a limited role.

He said that he believed the election would be more about Bush than about
Kerry.

"I personally think our election will be a referendum on George W. Bush,"
Buffett said. "The Kerry campaign is much less important than how people feel
about Bush."

Buffett's support of Kerry is the second time in the past year he has entered
the political fray. Though a Democrat, Buffett was an economic advisor to
Arnold Schwarzenegger (news - web sites), a Republican, in his successful bid
to become governor of California.

NTE. Down sharply today. I'm not doing well on my recent buy- ouch. I'll add a
bit more here though.

Seems to be a decent tech play, suffering now as many Chinese stocks come down.

Plenty of cash, very little ltd, 3% div. yield. Reasonable p/e if earnings come
through as company forecasts.

A good bet at current price. Jmo - although I have been wrong on this stock at
least a few times.

Fidelity,

i have fidelity activetrader and i love it. fidelity lets me do directed
trading to ecns with reserve limit orders and discretionary limit orders. i've
got level ii quotes. fidelity lets me specify my tax lots when selling shares
(although not with directed trading, fifo in that case), with the cost basis
downloading into turbotax at tax time.

fidelity provides good month of the end reconciliation of p&l. i get lehman
brothers research, and i have my own brokerage team. i also get to participate
in certain private placements and secondary offerings (haven't yet, tho)

however, you may not get all of this unless you have a fair number of trade or
fair size of assets. i don't know what you get at lower asset and/or trade
levels.

Grommit, I see some of the railroad stocks you follow are approaching an annual
high (e.g. your BNI). I'm re-looking at the large RR's whose stocks don't seem
to have participated in the sector rally. Two I spot are UNP and CSX. Anybody
here have an opinion to share on these two vis-a-vis the sector? I don't see
why there's such a discrepancy between these stocks' performance and the others
in the sector. Apparently intermodal business is good for all, and my guess is
that all should participate to some extent in any rally. Just wondering if it
might be a decent play to bet that those not participating are merely lagging
and will move higher by-and-by.

Paul, I kind of like a stalwart like AIB trading at the lower end of its
trading range with and undemanding valuation. What I do not like is the fact
that 48% of AIG's profits come from real estate. It seems to me that British
and Irish RE is totally overheated (much more so than the US) and may be ready
for a correction soon. This could become a problem for most British and Irish
banks and that's why i stay clear, despite the seemingly attractive valuations.

regarding defense stock ADG. recap.: They preannounced they would have lower
earnings and to a level they said was more normal level for their business: the
stock blew up (weak pun/wry grin). Slowly the stock came back over the past
weeks. Yesterday, they announced those poor earnings, and they were indeed poor
(imo). The stock has dropped sharply today.

I've begun adding back to my position.

The stock's now below book value (the only defense play I know that is). Debt's
manageable (imo), and the stock goes for a bit over 2x cash. The company's
profitable, and maybe there's some hope that the company's diversification away
from artillery shells might be working. (An electronic security subsidiary
reported receipt of a small (imo) order today.)

If the market isn't going to drop to lower levels (It seems to be today!), I'll
bet ADG stock will eventually rise again from today's $17.43. (OTOH, the
stock's thinly traded, so I'm guessing it could go much lower on just a
relatively few shares.)

Area51, re. AINV which you posted elsewhere on, I like it at the price $13+,
and I started a small amount yesterday.

As I see it: AINV will become a Business Development Company employing close to
$900M which they raised in an IPO @$15/sh. Similar BDC's ALD and ACAS trade at
prices above book value. Also these two pay a "dividend" of about 10%.

recap for the thread: BDC's pay out their "earnings" directly to stockholders -
they don't pay fed. income taxes. These companies loan money to other companies
sometimes in complex transactions -taking warrants, fees, etc.

They are controversial - shorters consider these BDC's Ponzi schemes because
they continually issue new shares, the cash from which maybe ultimately winds
up paying those "dividends". Further, these stocks are bought by "unsuspecting"
people looking for high div. yields, and with BDC's a possible significant
amount of "dividends" are from capital gains in the underlying companies'
warrants or shares. These gains are arguably unsustainable and/or misleading
because of the way capital losses in the portfolio of loans are treated or not
treated (not recognized) by the BDC's management.

I hold positions in both ALD and ACAS. I like ALD's more than 40 year history,
and I hope its business is real, or at least as real as it has been those many
past years. Things may be different now; there certainly seems to be more
competition to loan money- to wit: AINV.

I'm not sure yet exactly what I'm getting with AINV, so my position is small
and exploratory only now. I am hoping that the company can deploy funds
successfully and "earn" for stockholders a similar 10%, say $1.50 on $15 book
value. Although I don't know the total outstanding shares so I only hope $15/sh
is close to the book value that the total shares translate too.
Getting the stock under the IPO price, seeing that ALD and ACAS trade now a bit
over 1.5x their stated book value, and with some confidence (wrong though it
may be) with these latter two companies, it's my opinion that AINV might be a
decent investment for me.

I think AINV paid about 6% to the investment brokers so they should have
started with a book value of about 14.10 (a post on bdcinvestor.com which is a
good source of info on these companies said $14.06).

I added to ACAS yesterday myself and wouldn't mind adding again on ACAS under
$25 or AINV around $13 as an improving economy and increasing interest rates
should not be detrimental to these companies IMO. Per ACAS:

 Our plan also anticipates an improving economy and a rising interest rate
environment. Because our portfolio is hedged, changes in interest rates should
have little impact on our marginal yield. And, with $569 million of equity
interest in portfolio companies, an improving economy bodes well for future
capital gains.

They also addressed the competition concern and I think the impact should be
non-material
 We do not believe the new BDCs that have recently gone public and those that
may follow will have a meaningful impact on our business. Private equity and
mezzanine partnerships raised over $26 billion last year, one of the lowest
levels in years, increasing the pool of available capital to over $90 billion.
The amount of capital that may be raised by these new BDCs represents a small
fraction of the capital with which we compete and will likely be replacing
capital that would otherwise be raised by partnerships." 
ACAS quotes are from http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/040504/dctu086_1.html

But I'm a recent investor in these and have done nothing but lose money so far
so don't listen to me <g>,

one opinion... these three are all leveraged 30+ percent. I don't know how the
rates on their debt work (i.e., are they fixed for the long-term or float like
on a margin debit?).

They shouldn't do particularly well in rising rate environment, but the NAV

There is an article in "the economist" magazine April 24 page 78 on the recent
public offerings of private-equite firms. The speak of Apollo, KKR, Blackstone,
Keslo and Evercore. They mention the old hands ALD, ACAS. They criticize
Apollo's high management fees and incentive fees. "none of this seems to have
deterred investors" they say. The are critical of the capabilities of the new
firms.

They also mention that a lot less money has been raised by private-equity funds
(so there should be room for the additional firms, but they mention that the
industry has matured so that hitting "a home run" on an investment is much
harder now.

IMO the sharp sell-off in REITS may be overdone. I just ran across Amerivest
Properties Inc., symbol AMV. They are an interesting combination of a small,
micro-cap growth company and a high-yield REIT.

http://www.amvproperties.com/company/

Incorporated in Maryland but based in Denver, they own and operate upscale
office properties catering to small businesses, those generally needing less
than 4000 sq. ft. of space. They offer amenities such as key-card entry, shared
conference space with the latest technology available at no charge,
individually tenant-controlled heat and air conditioning, etc. They own
properties in Texas, Arizona, and Colorado.

Started in about 1996, they are still small but steadily growing. Their sales,
assets, and dividends have grown steadily since founding, and their current
dividend of 0.52 annually offers a yield of over 9% at the closing price on
Friday 5/7 of $5.59. ($5.52 as I write this.) The price range since 1995 is
about 3 to 7.

Browse their web site a bit and see what you think. I'm not sure if this could
truly be considered a "value" stock, but I like their track record, the tenor
of the company's mission statement, and the yield.
