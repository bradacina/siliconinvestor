Just exited FLYT at 3 7/16, as I think it has nearly reached cash value. It
will be interesting to see if it reaches the $5 or so potential it has if
operating loss tax benefits can be converted.

Jim,
How do you back out the impact of Dupont and IBC from Ralston's EPS?

Here's my attempt to add value ... recent buys:
o I bought MAT the same day you did
o working my way into Tenet Healthcare (leading hospital mgmt company)... P/B a
shade under 2x, 5/00 PE around 10x.
o property casualty and defense large-caps are starting to look interesting...
Allstate and Lockheed Martin PE is around 11x and LMT has a significant
goodwill amort. component
o working my into Compusa. It's up today but when I bought I think yesterday at
11 3/16 the EV was $1.3B and the market cap was $1.05B. I think my numbers are
right and it doesn't seem right for a category killer with 200+ stores
operated.
o buying Service Corp ... '97, '98 and '99 eps around $1.30 so the PE is around
12x at $16. BV is a shade under $12.

Thanks for any help on Ralston. Also, what happens to the equity on the balance
sheet as they sell Dupont and IBC?

Don't have the Ralston financials in front of me, so I can't help you there.

Service Corp...I've been mucking through the 10-K. What a strange business. The
financials scare me in a way, because the historical numbers do not look like
they "should" in my experience. Its hard to specify, but just a suspicion I
get. Your risk here is that there is massive accounting fraud - that would not
surprise me at all. But with it already down 60%, how bad could it be? That's
what Oxford looked like at 20 on the way to 3, and that's what Cendent looked

Dan M. And to tweak the thread, I'm starting to take profits today in another
former net-net: ICOR @ 8+. This stock was first posted here by me about 7/24/97
as a net-net @ 2 9/32; it showed up later again on a Mike Burry screening list
as noted by me 2/5/98 (post # 3147). Most of these net-nets get no comments,
unless someone deems them "decent". This one was typical ("indecent" -g-); but
it worked out very well, mostly because its business became associated with
"internet". I don't think the business model association or subsequent stock
rise could have been predicted a priori (i.e. in '97 or '98). That's why, IMO,
it's best to try to buy a package of net-nets, if they are available. JMO, Paul

very nice on ICOR. You play a different game, the classic Graham game of buying
them all and playing the odds. Sometimes the crappiest looking ones are the
ones that go up the most, so maybe I am doing exactly the opposite of what I
should be doing. (But if you are playing a basket strategy, you can't just post
the ones that doubled without posting the ones that went to zero. I'd be
interested to know what are the worst ones - not to reflect badly on you - it
is perfectly consistent with your strategy to have some losers - but I'm
interested in how bad a hit could be on a net-net, and also in when you cut
your losses and sell a loser under that strategy.)

I am trying to play net-nets in a different way, by culling through them and
buying a select few that meet other more qualitative criteria. So far that has
worked very well for me - I find one about every six months, and haven't failed
to get a nice move yet. Both strategies are intellectually sound, and I don't
think Graham would have a problem with either.

Thanks Paul on the note about ICO. Dealing with these small caps sometimes you
wonder if the value will ever be recognized.

One very positive sign that I've picked up from recent research is that
institutions have stabilized in their market share of the equity sector - and
individuals are flooding into the market and starting to make stock specific
decisions on their own with on-line trading.

With regard to Internet stocks I don't think these individual decisions are too
well placed, but sooner or later many will look past this hyped up sector to
buy more value oriented growth picks.

Check out these articles to support my theory that individuals are going to
have a bigger say in where money gets allocated in this market - an it very
well could be smaller companies:

***
"On-line transactions now make up 27 percent of all retail investments these
days and are up dramatically from even a year ago, meaning this is no longer
just for thrill seekers," said Lisa Nash, vice president of customer management
with the E*Trade Group on-line brokerage firm in Palo Alto, Calif. "The
Internet has leveled the playing field between the individual investor and the
institutional investor." New accounts have simply been coming in too fast and
it will probably take another two years for the on-line industry to expand its
capacity enough to solve most of its service problems, On-line trading is
growing with all the speed of the Internet, boosted even more by tried-and-true
inducements such as signing rewards, frequent-flier miles and telephone service
discounts.

They call it ''Market Storm 1999.'' And it's Charles Schwab's version of
sending in the Marines.
Nearly swamped by an unprecedented surge in stock trading, the world's largest
discount and online broker is taking emergency measures to keep customer
service from breaking down. Even though the firm keeps shoveling new computer
capacity into its network, its online system, which now handles nearly two out
of every three stock transactions, has buckled.

Joe, I do not think increased public participation in the market will help
value stocks much if at all. My view is that the stocks we like are typically
non-sexy stories which require the ability to perform traditional investment
type analysis to appreciate their value.

If I am right, the major underperformance of value stocks will, unfortunately,
likely continue. I think public money will continue to focus on highly visible
areas, like the Internet. For example, if
Video On Demand catches on, stocks like SFA will get tons more money
from the public.

From:Joe Dancy

I'm not so sure Jeff I agree with your analysis - but then again I've been
wrong before :). I do agree that the individual investor tends to gravitate to
the "hot" areas - that's just the way most people think who are not value based
guys like us.

Not that they are right, but a couple of Harvard types just completed a study
and concluded the massive cap stuff has done so well over the last decade
mainly due to the increasing share of money the institutions control going into
the market - and the institutions can't get their boats into the shallow water
surrounding small cap stocks.

I wrote this last week for the IFC site on SI, but then again maybe it is just
wishful dreaming :):
**
Why the vast differential in performance? Harvard professors Andrew Metrick and
Paul Gompers recently completed a study that indicated that much of the
dominance of large cap stocks was due to the increasing share of the equity
market controlled by institutions. Institutions had a 30% share in 1982 -
increasing to around 50% in 1997.

But some claim that after growing strongly for the last 15 years the share of
equities controlled by institutions in the market may have stabilized. In 1998
"we completed the transition from institutions to individual investors," said
Laszlo Birinyi, a research consultant and money manager in Greenwich, Conn.

On the New York Stock Exchange, Birinyi noted that $63 billion of net buying
was in blocks of $10,000 or less. In comparison, $44.7 billion was in
"big-block" trades. "It's the people standing in Charles Schwab who are running
the show," he said. On-line trading has exploded as individuals are beginning
to take responsibility for investment decisions.

* Individuals Drive Small Cap Market

And this fact is not insignificant. For a variety of reasons - including
restrictions on what percentage of a company's outstanding stock such investors
can hold - only a tiny amount of institutional ownership is in small caps. This
has hurt the performance of small caps by reducing the demand for them relative
to large cap stocks.

But if the share of the market controlled by institutions stops growing as
Birinyi noted, small caps could outperform larger companies for quite some
time. And compared to large caps, the small cap returns could be quite
impressive.

And make no mistake, individual investors, many trading on-line, are making an
impact on some sectors of the market - especially Internet related companies.
If on-line investors move past their current obsession with this segment, and
invest in more traditional technology small cap plays that display growth
characteristics and reasonable valuations, the small cap sector could do quite
well.

Newsletter publisher Mark Hulbert recently noted: "The good news for small-cap
investing is that this trend [of increasing institutional ownership] can't last
forever. And when it stops, or reverses, large caps will no longer enjoy their
performance advantage. No one can pinpoint when this will happen, but the
longer it takes, I believe, the stronger the small caps' subsequent
performance."

* Small Cap Indicators At Record Undervalued Levels

One wildly bullish indicator for small cap stocks is the relative
price-earnings ratio of the T. Rowe Price New Horizons fund to that of the S&P
500. The New Horizons fund is widely regarded as a proxy for the small cap
sector. New Horizon's estimated relative price-earnings ratio is sitting at a
38-year low in relation to the S&P 500's price-earnings ratio - meaning that
the small cap sector is grossly undervalued.

Another indicator that can be used to evaluate the small cap sector is the
ratio of the Russell 2000 index to the S&P 500. This ratio is at a 12-year low,
signaling a compelling case for smaller companies. "I think small and mid-cap
stocks are going to have a tremendous year in 1999 because we're coming into
this tremendous undervaluation," says Richard Driehaus, President of
Chicago-based Driehaus Capital Management Inc.

Gerald Perritt, who holds a doctorate in mathematics and has spent years
tracing small-cap returns, also likes the outlook for small cap stocks. He
figures that small caps have added an additional 6% annual return over the past
half century when matched against the stock market in general, unexplained by
risk factors alone. Assuming a relatively efficient market, small-cap stocks
must outperform large caps over the long term in order to reward investors for
the greater risk and lower liquidity.

Further, the recent market strength has been led by technology, which has
tripled as a percentage of the gross domestic product over the last seven years
according to well-known Wall Street analyst Abby Joseph Cohen. She noted that
U.S. exports increasingly consist of high-technology products that are not
easily duplicated - and are often sought-after - thereby insulating the U.S.
economy from some of the global instability.

Barron's had a note on Service Corp this week on how they missed earnings, and
I had lunch Friday with a senior Northern Trust investment strategist and he
told me that the management made some misleading statements a few weeks or
months ago in his opinion to calm fears - then the quarterly report just
confirmed the fears and issues were a real problem. People were not happy.

I don't follow, but he said I might look at it now as undervalued. I doubt I

I2:

ICO provides computer consulting services and hardware for larger companies -
most of those services are getting outsourced these days. The management is
well respected in the articles I've found by both competitors and analysts -
and they have been responsive to me when I've called with my questions - a plus
that they care about dealing with the little guy and treating us with respect
IMO.

Services make up a relatively minor portion of the ICO revenues but a major
portion of the earnings - so management several years ago began expanding the
services side of the business very aggressively with acquisitions and internal
growth strategies (cross selling).

As you know Y2K issues are a problem, and ICO is a service provider for this
area also.

They missed analysts earnings estimate by a few cents if I recall last quarter
- the first time in 16 quarters if I recall - so got beat. Is a very
competitive segment (isn't all technology so) and margins are thin. Also some
question/confusion as to the short term accretive or dilutive nature of a
recent acquisition - but long term should do well.

But I like the revenue growth, the plan to move into services, and management
for the long term.

I have a somewhat dated review of ICO at http://members.aol.com/LSinvestor -
click on the "Portfolio Analysis" button and scroll down to ICO - have a lot of
good links to financial and other information - or go to the "Model Portfolio"

Interesting article on value investing:

The objective of stock-picking, wrote Warren Buffett in one of his annual
reports, is "to purchase, at a rational price, a part interest in an easily
understandable business whose earnings are virtually certain to be materially
higher five, 10 and 20 years from now." That, anyway, is how Buffett himself,
chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and America's most successful investor,
does it.

"If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years," he wrote, "don't even
think about owning it for 10 minutes."With such a distant horizon, you can
afford to look for companies that might be temporarily in trouble, with their
prices depressed. Given time, these firms can bounce back and start producing
big profits -- which translate into higher prices and dividend

Re your comment on TOY inventories, I would appreciate your comments on this
situation. J Baker(jbak) has a 7% convertible note due 6-01-2002 with a current
price of about 75. Yield to maturity about 16%. Wall street is usually correct
and the consensus is that the bond is super junk. My review of the 10Q shows
inventories rising from 159 million to 187 million and quarterly sales about
138 million. This inventory seems excessive to me. Another negative is long
term debt at 211 million ,including the 70 million convertible,and equity of 80
million. On the plus side the company has positive earnings, current assets of
218 million and current liabilites of 61 million. They are in the big and tall
and uniform retail sales and I suspect that inventories would be much higher
than typical soft goods retail. I do not believe the stock is a good value but
certainly do not see signs of imminent disaster implied in the bond price.
P.S. I find your posts very well informed. Please continue to give us your

I recall looking at this when it first came up on board, and I don't recall

years ago my boss ran two units, mine and an auto leasing one. There are lots
of tricks and traps in that business that even DD on their financials can't
disclose to an investor.

If I wanted to invest in a leasing company based on value investing, I'd look
for one that has a good, stable history of volume and losses but has switched
away from gain on sale accounting and had the market bash in their price. These
companies have had no change in cashflows, as they are still securitizing, but
they are less aggressive in their accounting. Some of these have probably taken
75% haircuts.

Jim: about my net-nets

I find this a trying and discouraging way of investing. But I am doing it for a
component of my stock portfolio. Myself-- I am having difficulty in selecting
from among the choices occasionally presented here. So in some way, I am also
discriminating about which I buy. I'm more concerned about cash-on-hand than I
am of the company's business model or prospects. (Although of course, the cash
burn-rate is related to the business model/prospects.)
I've had no failures with the net-nets which I've purchased since '96. ALL have
been profitable when I sold them. (This seems similar to your success I think.)

I'd better qualify this though. First, I've not bought that many. Perhaps about
2 each year. Each has been posted here. Secondly, in every other endeavor, I've
been wrong many, many times. I've bought PFG about 12 and below, it's now 1,
RGFX @3 it's now maybe .3, RACC @3+ now .01. Those are just some of the buys
that went south. (They weren't purchased as net-nets though.) I try to give
each company about 2 years to work out - overcome its problems. If they are
unable, then by that time my percentage losses are humongous. Paul.

Vacationing in Vegas for a few days.

Bought SHFL this morning. Played BJ with a man from Minnesota in the Gold
Strike Casino in Jean NV. (Circus Circus owned casino) The table we were
playing at had a 6 deck Shuffle Master machine they were trying out. If it
worked out, they would continue the lease and it could develop into a major
contract with CC.

While sitting there, I got into a conversation with the man next to me. We
began discussing the machine and it turns out he is from Minnesota and very
familiar with the company. He tells me that the company is being bought out by
Bally and the announcement should come out soon. Definitely got my interest.
Turns out his son-in-law works for the company.

I talked further with the pit people about the machine and they thought they
would be keeping the machine because it definitely sped up the game (more
hands, more profit). The company also has a game called 'Let It Ride' that is
gaining popularity.

The company replaced the CEO a few months ago.
Company has been buying back shares.
The most recent news item is the VP of Sales for Bally just became the VP of
Sales for SHFL. The price has not risen, but there have been some large block
buys this week.

SHFL has a lawsuit against it that is to be settled soon. If there is a buyout
in the works, it may depend on the outcome of the suit. The company has issued
PR confidence they will win.

I researched and decided it was a decent buy based on fundamentals without the
'street rumor' and a very good buy if the rumor is right. Should know in a few
weeks.

Lawndale calls for QSII board changes/increases 13-D position

In a filing with the SEC on February 2, 1999, Lawndale Capital Management, LLC
amended its Quality Systems (O-QSII) 13-D filing, requesting changes to improve
Quality's Board of Directors. Lawndale's filing also disclosed that it had
boosted Lawndale's ownership in Quality Systems to 9.96% of QSII stock. Quality
Systems, Inc., is a Tustin, CA-based health care information systems company
with over $2/share of net cash, substantial recurring revenue from its core
dental practice management systems business and two start-up subsidiaries,
Clinitec Intl and MicroMed Healthcare Info. Sys that develop and provide
electronic medical records systems and enterprise practice management systems,
respectively.

The filing can be found at SEC EDGAR dataproviders or at
http://www.freeedgar.com/search/WL.asp?C=929870&F=SC_13D/A&D=2/2/1999

Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.

Subsequent to their filing of this Schedule 13D and its amendments, the
Reporting Persons ("Lawndale") have been in contact with management and members
of the Board of Directors of QSII and other QSII shareholders and third
parties, to discuss the strategies QSII plans to employ to maximize shareholder
value, including, but not limited to, changes in the composition and
functioning of QSII's Board of Directors (“Board”).

Board has failed to do its job.
---------------------------
According to Lawndale's research, Lawndale believes that QSII went public at a
split-adjusted $8.50/share on December 1, 1982 and last traded at approximately
$4.25/share on February 1, 1999, a decline of 50%, over a 16 year period. Three
of QSII's seven current directors have served on QSII's Board for this entire
period. Lawndale believes that no board should allow such a long-term record of
lost shareholder value to exist without taking decisive and meaningful actions.
Lawndale believes that the track record of QSII stock (down over 80%) since its
Chairman/CEO sold shares on March 5, 1996, (reducing his stake from a majority
position to approximately 25% of QSII) is the result of a non-independent,
inactive and ineffective Board.

Lawndale believes that responsibility for such poor stock performance is
directly related to inconsistent and mediocre operating performance and asset
mismanagement combined with the Board's failure to hold management accountable
for such ineffective leadership. Lawndale believes the Board has failed to do
its job largely as the result of dysfunctional board composition and the lack
of or poor corporate governance practices.

Shareholders have sent a message that the Board apparently failed to hear.
------------------------------------------------------------------
On September 9th, 1998, Andrew Shapiro, President of Lawndale Capital
Management, LLC attended QSII's Annual Meeting in person. As disclosed in
Amendment #4 of this Schedule 13D, Lawndale voted against a Board-proposed
option plan that two institutional proxy advisory services, Proxy Monitor and
Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), also analyzed and recommended a vote
"against". As disclosed in QSII's 10-Q for the quarter ended 9/30/98, 42% of
those voting, voted against the option plan and over 25% of those voting voted
to “withhold” on the reelection of QSII's directors. Following this Annual
Meeting, Mr. Shapiro addressed the Board regarding its lack of independence and
failure to hold management accountable for QSII's continual underperformance.
The Board did not and has not adequately responded to these concerns.

Lack of Board Independence.
-------------------------
Lawndale believes that boards lacking independence are more likely to avoid
taking necessary actions to put a stop to bad managerial decision-making and
poor performance resulting therefrom. Lawndale believes that the proper
framework in determining the "independence" of a director in an
under-performing company such as QSII should follow at a minimum widely
regarded guidelines promulgated by either the Council of Institutional
Investors (CII) or the California Public Employee's Retirement System (CALPERS)
which Lawndale provided to QSII in July.

Lawndale, as QSII's second largest non-management shareholder, in April 1998,
introduced a highly qualified and independent director for QSII's consideration
to fill a vacancy on QSII's Board. By the end of July, (4 months later), QSII's
Chairman informed Lawndale that QSII had been unable to fully evaluate
candidates in time for nomination and election by shareholders at the upcoming
September Annual Meeting but that the candidate introduced by Lawndale was
among several under consideration for appointment to the Board. The Chairman
represented to Lawndale that QSII's Board intended to continue the evaluation
process and to appoint new Board members in a timely manner. Under the CII &
CALPERS guidelines, it is Lawndale's belief that 4 of the 6 nominees for
election to QSII's Board at the annual meeting and subsequently elected were
not and are not “independent”.

Regardless of the independence or lack of independence of QSII's board, a
company with QSII's very poor performance needs quick and decisive leadership
changes at the Board and management levels.

Lawndale believes that QSII's Common Stock at current market prices is
undervalued. Lawndale intends to actively monitor efforts by the Board to
increase stockholder value. If Lawndale believes that the Common Stock
continues to be undervalued and/or the Board fails to timely take apparent and
necessary decisive actions to restore and enhance shareholder value at QSII as
listed below (see, “Necessary Actions”), Lawndale may propose a transaction
whereby all or a portion of QSII be sold, and in connection therewith Lawndale
may seek to participate in such transaction or seek to acquire control of QSII
in a negotiated transaction or otherwise. Lawndale may also seek in the future
to have non-management shareholder representatives appointed to the Board, by
agreement with QSII or otherwise, including by running its own slate of
nominees at an annual or special meeting of QSII. Lawndale may in the future
propose such other matters or support other shareholder's proposals for
consideration and approval by QSII's shareholders or the Board.

Necessary Actions
------------------
1) Changing the composition of the Board such that a substantial majority of
its members are independent through:
1a) adding independent person(s) with operating depth and experience in QSII's
industry(ies) and/or
1b) adding representative(s) of non-management shareholders.

2) Adopting a formal policy requiring the appointment of either an independent
Chairman or independent Lead Director. That Director shall be selected by the
Board from among the independent Directors. His/her role would be to coordinate
with the other independent Directors, chair Executive Sessions of the
independent Directors and act as a liaison between them and the Chairman/CEO.

3) Adopting a formal policy for each Board meeting, whereby at the end of each
meeting the Board meets in Executive Session, without members of management
present, to discuss such matters as they think appropriate, including
management performance.

Lawndale does not have any present plan or proposal which would relate to or
result in any of the matters set forth in subparagraphs (a) - (j) of Item 4 of
Schedule 13D except as set forth herein or such as would occur upon completion
of any of the actions discussed above. Lawndale intends to review its
investment in QSII on a continuing basis and, depending on various factors
including, without limitation, QSII's financial position and Lawndale's
investment strategy, the price levels of QSII Common Stock and conditions in
the securities markets and general economic and industry conditions. Lawndale
may in the future take such actions with respect to its investment in QSII as
it deems appropriate including, without limitation, purchasing additional
shares of Common Stock or selling some or all of its shares of Common Stock or
to change its intention with respect to any and all matters referred to in Item
4. To the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing, Lawndale incorporates by
reference the material in Item 4 of its previously filed Schedule 13D and the
amendments thereto.

Timberland as a company is changing. Over a year ago people were talking the
brown shoe trend down. But Timberland IMO has hit upon some brand equity. It is
not just a brown shoe, but a very premier brown shoe. I see people wearing them
to work all the time. If/when the "fad" switches back to tennis shoes, will
these people stop wearing Timberlands? I wore one pair nearly every day for 5
years, and I'm working in two more pairs now. And now I've added two Timberland
shirts for work. The quality and comfort is high, and it's more than a fad,
IMO.

I thought it was an obvious, 10 minute analysis type of stock in
the mid 30's. This earnings report is sterling, making me think it still is
undervalued in the mid 50's for a ompany that is really a growth cyclical
starting to hit its stride.

The stock price shows really two price peaks, but the company itself has been a
steady grower over the 30 years of its existence.

All my opinion - this isn't one that is so obviously a value if you just look
at the balance sheet. To me, there's obvious value in the brand that gives it
high ROE, and makes it worth 11 times current earnings.

Thanks guys for mentioning it. I stopped following after selling for a nice

particularly poor report, because of problems in Brazil or something. Also
interest rates are higher than last time it was under $10, and rising, and the
dividend might be perceived as less
secure -- thereby acting as somewhat less support. Maybe the stock can hit

Regarding the oil industry:

I know a bit about it, and IMHO now is not the time to buy. Nobody projects oil
to get over 13-14$/barrel b4 Y2K, most aim lower and most say there will be no
sustained recovery in price for at least 2 or 3 years. This is a once or twice
a century severe problem with the oil glut. Saudi Arabia has HUGE debt problems
and so they continue to pump as much oil, as they can. This is why OPEC can not
seem to come to an agreement on lowering production. Saudi Arabia is the
biggest producer and is generally the leader of OPEC as well as sporting the 2
biggest religious holy cities of Mecca and Medina.

For this reason oil stocks will not have a sustained rally for quite some time.
With the economies of Asia, Russia and now Brazil tanking, the once bright
future oil consuming prospects of the the 3rd world are now looking dim. With
more weak economies probably to follow, it could be a long time until sustained
demand for oil picks up. Note how long Japan has been in recession/depression.
Do we hear one decade, maybe 2?

I am looking to buy oil in 2001 or so, unless the world economy looks even
worse than now. In the mean time I expect a lot of weak oil
producers/drillers/servicers to go under as well as a lot of consolidation.
Hope this helps.

Hi Bill,

I'm not an expert in the oil industry but it seems to me that with a limit on
natural resources, someone still has to poke holes in the ground to look for
more. Everything I've seen points to over production as the problem, not a lack
of consumption. I wouldn't think that oil services would take the kind of hit
to margins that the oil companies are. To me the whole idea of value investing
is to move on beat up issues while everyone still hates them.

Take a look at EGEO. The stock is trading at 1/2 of what the company has per
share in cash and the revenue growth sure doesn't look like any kind of slow
down.

http://www.marketguide.com/mgi/snap/A159E.html

I'd have to agree with Bill on the short term outlook for the oil industry -
but I really am interested in the numbers on EGEO at your link - selling at a
p/b of 0.3 and a PE of 4 with revenue growth of 70%+? Only thing I don't like
is the debt - many a good oil company has sunk on its debt servicing
requirements.

The 3-d seismic is a very hot technological area, and while the description of
the company is not specific if they have their finger in this segment they
might do well on weak oil prices.

How did EGEO grow revenues like this, by acquisition? I assume it would have to
be - you can't grow that fast with internal generated growth.

Do you have any idea whether they are into 3-d seismic and if so, in what
capacity? (do they shoot the lines, buy the data, process the data, interpret
the data, or all of the above?)

Nice post. The situation as you describe it reminds me of what happened after
the oil bubble burst in 1981. Having made a lot of money on oil stocks in 1980,
and giving most of it back in 1981, I do not have fond memories, and have not
followed the industry since. Your outlook for the industry is exactly what
happened then. Only the large cap companies and the best of the smallcap
companies survived, and the smallcap ones were in doubt and in the low single
digits for a long time.

Based solely on your outlook, anyone interested in buying smaller ones should
avoid any with material debt outstanding, and plan to average into a position
over a 2-3 year period.

Hi Joe,

Here's the most recent quarterly report on EGEO:

http://sec.yahoo.com/e/l/e/egeo.html

There was an earnings warning in December that they were expecting a loss of
.13-.15 per share for Q4 and they are working to trim expenses to contain
losses going forward. Several ANALysts cut their ratings about the same time. I
always tend to suspect ANALysts use their rating systems to create buying and
selling opportunities for themselves.

The link in the previous post is a fairly decent resource for doing quick
research and there are some screening tools that are pretty hard to beat for a
free service. The information tends to be a quarter behind current events so
it's a good idea to double check anything you find there. What I've been doing
is screening for value, then using the site to eliminate the really ugly stuff
and whatever is left over I do the more in depth research like SEC filings,
news, insider trading, etc. I also play around with TA a bit and I like to see
those low volume flat spots at the end of a ski slope type patterns. Usually
2-3 months into the bottom isn't too bad an entry point. Double bottoms, and
upside down head and shoulders, are good patterns to look for also, although it
usually means trying to hit a fast moving target.

There aren't any blue chips showing up on my list.<G>

My experience has been that the market tends to over react to bad news and if
you add bad news to funds cleaning out their portfolios in December, the result
tends to be beyond what is reasonable. A minor correction in the "dog" stocks
I've been picking up over the last month or so translates into fairly healthy
percentage gains. I'm not in love with any of them so it doesn't break my heart
if I have to sell something at a profit. And I don't have a big enough
investment in any of them where it's a big deal if they trade sideways for
awhile.

This seemed like a good thread where a person could get more objective ideas
for value investing than the "I bought this for $40 5 years ago and now I hate
everybody." commentary I see most places where there is any kind of fundamental
value in a company. Sure would hate to own YHOO if they sold their assets to
pay off share holders.

Don

First of all, let me thank you for bringing EGEO to my attention. I have added
it to the list of the Oil stocks I follow and I like it for a big pop when the
sector recovers, (if it is still around). Now, unfortunately I have to disagree
with your two main points.

1. The oil problem is not simply over production. It started with the aisian
problem and has continued right on along with it. When all those economies
tanked, they immediately quit using significant amounts of oil. Asia was the
fastest growing area of the world for oil consumption, and the world's oil
producers were enjoying the supplying of their pumped up demand, which is now
deflated. Russia and Brazil have also cut back consumption. How many more
countries are going to implode and simularily quit using as much oil. If people
are broke, they don't buy cars. I can remember hearing an analyst saying 1 1/2
years ago, "pretty soon everybody in China is going to want a car, that's gonna
use a lot of oil", as he was predicting $40/barrel prices in the Y2K.

2. I have looked at EGEO. There are solid reasons why the stock has tanked way
down into the 2's. In the last 2 months, with the stock price already, way
down, they were cut by Prudential and Southwest, and Moodys is worried enough
about their long term solvency, that they are reassessing their debt rating.
Sure a lot of their current numbers look real good, but what about 1 year from
now? EGEO's estimate for '98 is .52, the consensus estimate for '99 is .02, one
analyst even had it as low as -.50 for '99. The fact of the matter is that with
EGEO as with many other oil servicers and drillers, they will eventually loose
money, when this downturn in oil continues. That's why this stock is so beat
up. Book value, past earnings growth, and revenue growth mean nothing if a
company is going to lose money and eventually go out of business. EGEO is not
under valued, it is just trading at future earnings like all stocks do, and for
EGEO that happens to be almost nothing, and hence the price.

Please for your own sake, read and consider post #5946 by Jeffrey Bash. He
describes well the kind of carnage that can hit the oil industry in a major
downturn from personal experience. EGEO is the perfect type of dinky company to
go belly up in this kind of slump. You won't think 2 or 3 dollars is a good
price then.

Thread:

This stock (EGEO) brings up a good point. All of the stocks I see posted on
this board have good price to book and other valuations. You guys are good at
looking up stocks like that, but the crucial issue is: WHY? There is always a
reason a stock gets beat down. This question must be successfully answered with
surety before you can consider investing. As I have looked for the answer to
this question on all the stocks that have been posted for the last few weeks, I
have yet to find one that doesn't have darn good reasons for being devalued.
The perfect stock is the issue that has been beat up by short term earnings
fluctuations, or something like that which is soon to be resolved. This truly
is the rare gem. May we all find just one or two of these.

Re: Oilpatch

Among the small caps, hard to see one. But among the mid caps I see quite a
few. "Small cap sector leader" to me is an oxymoron. Among the mid-caps I see
Tidewater (TDW) as a leader of its sector, with the only strong, debt-free
balance sheet among its competitors.

Among the drillers, Diamond Offshore (DO) and Noble Drilling (NE) have strong
balance sheets and are sure to survive until the next cycle. Transocean
Offshore has a weaker balance sheet relative to these two but which is still
nevertheless strong enough to survive a lengthy downturn, IMO.

These are all $1 to 4 billion companies. And the market, IMO, despite
overselling them, is still placing relative odds on their ability to survive.
You can see this by simple PE on average earnings. TDW seems the most expensive
of its competitors, but it's the only one that definitely will survive a
lengthy downturn. Even among DO, NE, and RIG I see the market valuing them
correctly in the relative sense if not the absolute. NE is more "expensive"
than DO which is more "expensive" than RIG, which is how I see them as far as
safety.

Disclaimer: I own all of the above, having recently bought them at prices a
little below the current levels. DO I own via Loews (LTR), which owns a 50%
stake.

In the portfolio at ValueStocks.net, I own LTR, NE, and TDW.

I've heard that it's hand to hand combat in the supply boat business, with day
rates dropping precipitously. Of course, the rates are pretty much dictated by
the biggie, TDW (that, and supply and demand, of course). One brokerage firm
absolutely feels that HMAR's (HMAR being a TDW competitor) earnings will come
tumbling down this year. Numbers were taken down from somewhere between
.50-1.00 to, I believe, .03 for this year by this one firm. Sorry I don't
recall the exact figures. That's some downward revision!
And, of course, if day rates do improve, those numbers will need be adjusted
upward.

Thanks everyone for the discussion on oil stocks. I mostly follow tech stocks

Although after the last two days it might not be that long before they go back
where they were in October. A person could have just about closed their eyes
and picked out a three bagger four months ago on just about anything related to
computers.

I think there are a lot of similarities between oil stocks and disk drives
about a year ago. Everyone was saying that all the smaller DD companies were
going to go under but here it is a year later and they're still in business and
most of them are well off their lows.

One question that came to mind while filling up the car this morning. In winter

"There aren't any blue chips showing up on my list.<G>"

I agree Don. I can't buy the blue chip stuff at the prices they sell for. With
the small and micro cap companies there is no correlation between the value of
the underlying business and the stock price in quite a few cases. Long term,
that is playing into our hands.

Just got Merrill's Global Research Review for January. Of the 20 domestic oil
field service companies they cover 16 were buy or strong buys for both short
and long term. Most sold for under 2 times price to book.

Then again, with oil prices it may take some time to see value out, but it
will. But I still think we are a bit early - then again I'm a terrible market

Your post brings up an excellent point. A lot of the stocks we mention are
value stocks for a reason and TOO OFTEN it is not truly clear when
that reason will go away. I personally find I largely own a portfolio which has
seriously underperformed the market both because smaller stocks have
underperformed larger ones AND because the reason for value is some issue which
lasts much longer than we would ever have dreamed.

MWY, which three of us who write regularly on this thread own, is a case in
point. It sure looked like good value at $10, with very large
insider buying at that and higher prices. Here it is now at $8 with more
insider buying and maybe going to $6.

I am beginning to wonder if our strategy is faulty. If we were to require that
a stock both be a value stock and clearly be able to see that the issue was
about to go away, we would own almost no stocks at all. On the other hand, if
the rest of the market had not made advances that were not merited, perhaps
buying value stocks where we could see the issue eventually disappearing (but
not next week) would have shown better relative returns. But not in this
market.

Have been doing much more DD on IDTC, b4 posting on this esteemed thread.
Funny, how I have bought not just shares in the stock but call options without
doing as much DD! Anyway here goes:

The best current value play I know, IDTC. It is not only a low priced tech
stock, but has the extra bonus of being a sexy PROFITABLE internet play at only
roughly 1.5 book value.

Core Business: IDT is an international telecom. They are currently building
their own network complete with fiberoptic bandwidth and POPs. CEO is Howard
Jonas, former AT&T top dude from b4 dereg. He has built the company from 11
million to 600 million dollars. Revenues have sequentially increased for as
many quarters as I can get info on. They offer low cost long distance to
compete with the big guys, and often serve as a wholesaler. They are and have
made a lot of money in the lucrative phone card business. All projections are
for earnings to continue on an upward spiral after they get their network
completely built out.

Core Business Innovations: The research departments of one of their recent
acquisitions has invented a switch that will cost 1/6 of the switches made by
Nortel and Alcatel. It works and they are actually installing it in their
network.

Internet Business: IDTC has an ISP, (of which I am using right now for
$10.99/month), which is in the top ten for customers. However, they are
deemphasizing this aspect of the business. IDTC's biggest future asset is
internet telephony. They have a product called Net2Phone which allows any
domestic call anytime for 4.9 cents a minute through internet telephony. No one
can touch this, and their intl. rates are also the lowest. The internet
telephony (IT), is only slightly less quality than regular phone lines. There
are currently over a million users, and with Net2Phone direct neither the
calling party or the called have to be anywhere near a computer. With this same
technology they also have many other products. Last monday they launched an
internet portal, (http://www.ezsurf.com) that allows shoppers to speak directly
to an etailers live customer rep while surfing the web through a product called
Click2Talk. A recent survey said 89% of people are still uncomfortable with
transmitting their credit card number over the internet. This innovation could
be huge. IDT has already signed up dozens of big name companies and etailers to
use this technology.

Internet IPO/Spin-off: Recent excitement in the investing community centers
around the emminent IPO/spin off of the internet business. It is doubtful the
market has priced this into the stock as of yet, because no one really knows
how it will benefit shareholders. All is currently secret according to SEC
quiet rules. Company could retain IPO shares as well as gain huge cash pay off
for initial sale, and may even issue 1 IPO for every 5 or 3 shares of IDTC in
some kind of combination IPO/spin off.

Next Post: Why the price is depressed.

Why IDTC is near it's 52 week low:

IDTC became profitable back in 1997, and this combined with extreme excitement
about their number one position in IT drove the stock to $40. Then in April of
1998, the FTC and congress began investigating the possibility of regulating
and taxing IT. This news sent the whole IT sector, (NSPK, VOCLF, FTEL and
others) into a down spin all the way till October. Even though IDTC is mainly a
telcom, it was most widely known as an IT play, so even though their earnings
kept increasing with skyrocketing revenues the stock fell into the mid teens in
sympathy with IT. The most amazing thing about this, is that as far as I
understand, IDT will not be vulnerable to a regulatory tax like other ITs
because IDT's technology originates the call with a regular phone line unlike
others like Vocaltec (VOCLF) whose IT is all over the internet. So, basically
IDTC dropped from $40 to $15 for no good reason!!

I have heard it suggested in my extensive reading that investors may have been
reacting to the possibility that calling cards may eventually become obsolete,
(not likely to happen for some time, IMHO), and IDT's number one revenue source
is currently prepaid calling cards. I have also heard it suggested that AT&T's
announcement last year, that they were going to enter IT may have scared
investors, (not a real concern, IMHO as they are so far behind IDT and so big
and slow that they may never catch up).

Whatever the reasons, they don't seem serious enough as to cause a fall from
$40 to $15.

Reason For Recent Lows: A few weeks ago IDTC pre-announced a .10 cent hit to
current quarter's earnings. Several analysts cut it and lowered earnings
estimates to .06 from .16. The stock hit 9 1/2 in one day and popped back up to
$14-16 in about a week. The reason given for the earnings shortfall was that
vendor and operations delays in the deployment of their network caused them to
have to use much more leased capacity and spot services than expected. The
problem will be corrected in 2 or 3 quarters. Also, the money they have been
dumping into the internet side of the business has been causing a drain on
margins. This will be solved by the eminent IPO/spin off. IDT has also hired
some very experienced new mgmt to help speed up network deployment.

The jump back up to current levels from the 9's is probably due to all the
excitement about the internet news forthcoming. IDTC has been on Steve Harmon's
ISDEX for more than a year. They have huge internet potential and you can still
get in on the ground floor, unlike as you all know, most internet stocks.

IDTC has a book value of 10 1/2, $6.50/sh in cash, a asset/liability ratio of
almost 4 and a debt/equity ratio of .046. At 16 1/8 with such huge internet
potential I see VERY little downside risk, and I look for the low 20's in 1-3
months and $30 b4 Y2K.

All IMHO Do your DD's

Looked into FLC and TIA. TIA is some kind of new telecom and there is almost no
info out on it. It is not a value play as it is trading right near it's high.

FLC looks real shakey. They have alot of debt with a debt/equity ratio of 1.63,
(too high!) and an assets/liability ratio of 1.24, (too low!). They have had
sequentially falling earnings since 6/98 and may eventually loose money in this
oil sector slump. May not make it if slump is prolonged, and this is reflected
in the price.

Bill,

Re:
There is always a reason a stock gets beat down.

Yes. But I don't take the following reasons as valid reasons not to buy the
stock (in fact I find them good reasons to do the opposite):
a)the cycle is down so sell the cyclicals to absurd levels
b)the nifty 50 and internets are in, so sell your small caps
c)you've lost big in a stock so sell to pay less taxes
d) your stock didn't perform well this quarter, so join the institutions in
selling to window-dress
e) the outlook is poor the next two quarters so sell as a proxy for pre-emptive
window-dressing
f)a beaten-down stock gets more beaten down out of frustration (e.g. Midway)

Oil, commodities and farming are no doubt facing horrible outlooks. No doubt
these industries are prone to devastatingly long and deep recessions. However,
given your stated style -

"Short to mid term in companies I think will pop. -

I find it hard to take you taking us to task seriously. Playing the sentiment
surrounding 1 or 2 quarter earnings fluctuations may be your game, but to me
does not constitute a sound, safe investment strategy.

Some of the posts on this thread from seemingly sound individuals have struck
as something I might read in Barrons, that noted barometer of popular
sentiment. Mattel should be avoided because Barbie is out. Oil should be
avoided because there is no near-term good news expected. These statements
strike me as asinine, and reflect the growing frustration among value
investors, who, like Jeffrey, are doubting their strategy.

This only leads to less support for the most undervalued situations. I'll
continue to scoop them up as long as I can.

The fundamental flaw with your advice IMO seems to be that you believe we can
accurately predict the timing of both the fall and the redemption. Moreover,
you would like to do it on terms lasting less than 6 mos or so.

The flaw in me, which I recognize, is that I can't do that reliably. So I'll
stick to investing in the spirit of Graham rather than Pilgrim.

Jeffrey:

I will have to check out some of the suggested mid caps I have read here today.
I like Pride Intl, (PDE) and have been holding some shares for about a year
now. I am down almost 50%.

They have a half decent debt to equity of 1.09. All their debt is colateralized
with their ships and rigs, and they are trying to get more debt to set up more
rigs. They will keep making money through all this because they have long term
contracts. They just recently broke an upwards sequential earnings pattern in
9/98. They will still make good cash flow and should weather this storm.

Nice flame, but seriously, do you think it is impossible to see out on a stock
or industry 3 to 6 months? Long term, eventual, should be value is easy to spot
in low PE, Price to book, etc. but that is not what moves the market today.
Don't you think it wise to buy stocks that have all that value and long term
potential, but also have a visible chance for a quick pop in the near future?
After all, havn't you seen a repeated pattern with so many under valued stocks:
they get hammered down over a long period of time to a real low price, and then
when news emerges that the turn around is near, BANG!! It triples in a month!
This just happened with TRID.

Why buy an undervalued stock if the only forecast one can discern is for more
indefinite gloom? Why not wait until you have a STRONG suspicion that things
are going to turn. There's more than fundamental analysis involved in making
good investment decisions.

I am not trying to talk this thread out of value investing, but rather trying
to correct what I see as an over-emphasis on pure number crunching, and a lack
of concern about short, mid and long term forward looking circumstances for
companies.

I just don't see this over-emphasis. The short and long-term prospects are
nearly always considered in any good analysis posted

"There's more than fundamental analysis involved in making good investment

To what are you referring? Maybe you've gotten the mistaken impression that we

Thanks Bill. I like FLC partly because any time I can purchase shares of a
company for less than Soros or Buffet paid, I'm intrigued, and Soros is a large
shareholder of FLC. Their debt concerns me, but on the other hand FLC has 150
million in cash, which is a lot more than some of their peers on a cash per
dollar of market cap basis. Bye the way, my intended meaning for "TIA" in my
last post was an acronym meaning thanks in advance, not "TELECOM ITAL A",
although it would be ironic if in the next year, TIA outperformed FLC <G>.

Hi Bill,

Re IDTC

I agree there are a lot of things that look attractive, but I wouldn't touch
that chart with a long stick. Stochastics are at close to 100%, the trend lines
are all down, and the recent volume down with the increase in price is bad
news. Any short term play would be like trying to catch a falling knife.
Nothing encouraging in the form 4s and 144s either. The increased short
interest in January might favor a squeeze though. If it doesn't break out in
the next day or two, I'd look for a retest of recent lows.

Don

Don't be so hasty. The poster may have implied that buffet owns this but i
doubt it he does. I think you read more into his statement than intended. And
Soros doesn't own it. One of his HUGE pools of money MAY own it...but so what.
They HAVE to buy stuff to stay in the game, unlike Buffet, who drops out
occasionally. And Soros long ago gave up pulling the trigger on stocks and was

bill, you make this sound wonderful<G>...but we should start from a sound
factual basis.

>>IDTC has a book value of 10 1/2, $6.50/sh in cash, a asset/liability ratio of
almost 4 and a debt/equity ratio of .046. At 16 1/8 with such huge internet
potential I see VERY little downside risk, and I look for the low 20's in 1-3
months and $30 b4 Y2K.<<

1) From the latest 10q I see about $245 million of equity on the books. I see
35.7 million diluted shares (weighted average). I use this because this is one
of those option loving companies apparently. When I divide this, I get $6.90 of
bv per share. Where do you get the $10.50? Please don't say Yahoo.<G> Never
mind that $75 million is goodwill, and $31 million is other assets. This is why
I think those of you who even look at bv are barking up the WRONG tree. And
don't count on bv per share staying even there. This company, after all, LOVES
to issue shares.

2) You state that the company has $6.50 in cash. Well I see about $151 million
of the good stuff on the books. Divide that by 35.7 mill and you get $4.20 of
cash. Not bad, but far from $6.50. But before you think you have hit the
motherlode here, take a look at the RIGHT side of the balance sheet. Over
there, you will discover $105 million of debt and interest payable, and $14
million of capital lease obligation, a debt equivalant. Add those two and you
get $119 million of obligations. Subtract that from $151 million and you get
all of $32 million. That leaves you with less than $1 a share of NET cash,
which is how ONE should look at a company. We haven't even looked at potential
OFF BALANCE SHEET liablilities.

But wait. This company is a voracious USER of cash. So does it really make
sense to, in essence, BANK that < $1 a share of cash because it is EXCESS cash
and therefore distributable? Or are we to believe that management can use it in
a value enhancing way? Or could an acuirer use the cash as part of a bid for
the company? Nope. Nope. And Nope.

So Bill, as much as I want to call up my broker on Sunday and put an order in
on this thing, I thought it only appropriate that we start from a FACTUAL
basis.<G>

>>I see VERY little downside risk, and I look for the low 20's in 1-3 months
and $30 b4 Y2K.<<

Bill, over here on the value thread, we don't pretend to be able to PREDICT the
future, and don't expect others to be much good at it either.<G>

Now can I interest anyone in a petroleum stock of some sort?<G>

Bill, if you can find cheap stocks where you can see the light at the end of
the tunnel, and that tunnel is only a quarter or two long, God bless ya. Just
hope you post them here too. I usually (not always) find that catalysts are
very expensive. If I can see it, usually everybody else can too. Once in a long
while, I find one where the catalyst is there but the stock is still sitting
near its bottom. And I buy it.

So don't think our goal is to find very cheap stocks with no visible
fundamental turn in site just so we can enjoy watching them do nothing for two
years. But I assign value to catalysts too - sometimes that catalyst is
overvalued, and sometimes its undervalued. Its what Buffett talks about when he
says you have to think in terms of probabilities. And if you think in terms of
probabilities, I would assert this: Those very cheap stocks with no visible
fundamental turn in sight have some probability of turning much sooner than
anybody thinks. What is the probability of agriculture stocks turning in 1999?
I'd say about 25%. 50% in 2000 and 25% that we're in for some very long term
frustration. What are the probabilities on oil prices turning soon? I have no
idea, but I know its a lot more than zero.

I'm not quite sure what ticked Mike off, so I'll leave his statements alone.
But I too get very annoyed when investors I work for decide they don't care
what the valuation of a stock is if it has no visibility for the next quarter
or so. Once that visibility materializes, the price is usually already up 25%
or more.

Just my thoughts - they don't contradict what you said, only add a layer
alongside it.

I also think that in a more normal market, we will better understand what
Warren Buffett means when he ridicules the idea of thinking about quarters. I
have no problem whatsoever waiting two or three or even five years for a
double. There are so many investors out there who don't want to buy anything
unless it is going to go up 50% in the next quarter. That is not reality, and
we are going to miss an awful lot of opportunties for big two-three year plays
if we too fall into that trap.

Thanks for the techy tip - I'll pass that along to our telecom/tech analyst
tomorrow for a reality check.

Twister, well done. I checked too and you're absolutely right on the numbers.
Could Bill really have missed that the company has two classes of stock, and
only counted one class of shares? I still don't see how one could possibly make
the claim that this company has "NO DEBT" if one had glanced at the balance
sheet. This is why God created SEC financials. We're not talking a lot of work
here - Twister's analysis took all of about two minutes to check. I guess Bill
did ridicule our obsession with fundamental research, so we can't accuse him of
hypocrisy. I would love to hear where he got those numbers though, just so I
can avoid that source in the future.

Good critique on IDTC. Good use of the g's. Lay it on me! I want to know every
possible reason why I should not own the stock I own. "Faithful are the wounds
of a friend".

As far as book value goes. I understand that good will makes up a part of it. I
really believe as obviously did whoever made up the value, that good will
matters. Most of good will is your customer data base and that has a very real
value. Look at the incredible amount of money they sold all those cable
customers for. Somebody correct me if I am wrong, but is that not simply "good
will" that they are throwing around for billions of dollars? Yes I did get
IDTC's $10.50 book value from Yahoo!, but if you count good will, is that
number wrong? I confess, " I use Yahoo!" <G> I am coming out of the closet. As
far as cash per share, I guess Yahoo doesn't count all the unexercised options
or something.

You said:

"Bill, over here on the value thread, we don't pretend to be able to PREDICT

If what I said about IDTC's price forecast comes true will I change your
mind?<G>

Seriously, you guys on this thread are obviously a very learned bunch, and
perhaps I should not have dared to bring up any criticism, especially since I
just came in on Post # 5000something. Oh well, I can take a flame.

You guys are right to point out my weakness in tending too much toward the
short term. Even God agrees with you, "he who hastens to be rich will not go
unpunished", Proverbs 28:20. Maybe between this esteemed Value Thread, and God
Almighty Himself, you all can talk some sense into me.

2-3 years down the road, whereas all the complainers on YAHOO have a much
shorter timeframe. To make any difference in his net worth, Redstone has to
have that kind of time frame since he can't accumulate a big position in two
weeks.

Also, I recall that Buffett hopes a stock he buys drops 50% so he can buy more.
I just wish I did not own so many of these obliging value stocks, from his

Paul & All: TMO, BTGI, UWR thoughts

Paul, I assume you disagree with TMO's level of exposure/vulnerability in Asia
(AFAIK that was a key reason for the co's underperformance in 1998). Also
restructuring (at least acc'g to VL) is moving slowly and no spinoffs or
acquisitions are planned until it is completed. Here too, if your perspective
on TMO is different and more favorable pls post your counter point. I believe
TMO also has a convertible issue with a nice yield right now. With TMO's $1B in
cash maybe that is the way to play a TMO turnaround.

Also to all, any thoughts on BTG (symbol BTGI), IT consulting firm, heavily
weighted towards IT for Fed gov't). There is an SI thread and I'm doing DD now.
The stock appeared in Worth-March 99 as a stock recommended by mgr. Of

BTGI is selling at 10x 1999 forecasted earnings (!). Any thoughts on this one
most welcome.

Finally speaking of value I am considering United Water Resources (symbol UWR)
as the next strong candidate for acquisition in the public H2O business. The
co. has water ops in several states, is turning its business around, and
recently raised its dividend for first time in years. It seems to be a similar
profile to Consumers Water Co (CONW) which will merge into Phila. Suburban
(PSC; another water utility on the move) this quarter. And in the meantime UWR
is yielding 5% or so.

Thanks all
Mike

>>I suspect a better play is to hope that one of the three might be mispriced
right after
the separation and offer an opportunity to a knowledgable and nimble buyer.<<<

I would look at the semi cap piece for that.

>>Call me highly skeptical<<

You aren't the only one.<G>

Well, if you take some time and look at each business, and then compare what
comprables are trading at or have been taken out at, you will discover that the
health care bussiness is a $20 business, the instruments business is a $15
business and the semi is a $10 business. The most upside will be in semi which
will probably be dumped. The company is doing a restructuring this quarter to
take cost out of the operation so as to mitigate costs of three overhead
structures. But a lot of corporate costs, i.e. corporate salaries, corporate
jet, etc. will NEVER be added. There is also excess real estate that is being
sold. This is a terrific event for Varian shareholders.

Hi Bill,

<I know the technicals look bad, but don't they always on most value stocks?>

Well....I normally don't look for an over bought condition as an entry point on
a value play.<g>

Don

On Varian, why don't shareholders agree with you? The stock is selling near 12
months low?

because they're dupit...and I'm not.<G>

Mr Bash, with all the proper respect due you and that is a lot, you should know
better than to ask that question, especially here on the value thread where it
is a GIVEN that a stock is under a cloud of some sort. Of course that's what
creates OUR opportunity.

You don't find it odd that I brought up a company at its 52week low on the
VALUE thread, do you? If you must know, MY answer its that I can wait six
months, or a year or two and everyone else wants instant gratification.

If you think about the current structure of Varian, you will understand why the
split apart is such a great idea. Most investors will come to this conclusion
sooner or later.

Grins all over this post..

I don't deserve so much respect, but my comment had a point. Varian is an
institutional stock, not some obscure stock like we talk about some times.
There are plenty of institutions who have considered the segmenting of the
company and have chosen not to pay any more than near the 12 months low. I do
not take issue with the idea that it makes sense, but that it may take a while
to realize your target.

GZMO: Note my post 5899 and today's announcement

http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/990208/ma_genzyme_1.html

which is a perfect illustration of the parent company's position and prestige
leveraging this division. Value is where you find it!

jeff, don't give "institutions" so much credit. I don't. They don't deserve it
for being less than average with zero creativity.

Jeff, this is a small cap stock. out of favor. conglomerate. bad management.
there is uncertainty. it is not dell, i.e money in the bank. it is not cisco.
therefore thinking is required and money managers aren't good at that, as a
rule. Just read what James says about the people he works with. And THEY"RE
probably the good ones. Few of them are like us Jeff. They hate uncertainty.
And, shareholders still need to approve, as does the SEC. there will be a lot
of flailing around PRIOR to the spin and just after it too, as people will be
dumping two or one of the babys. so, institutions, which don't ACT like proper
owners, are SIDESTEPPING the uncertainty by selling shares BEFORE the event.
Once the spin happens, you will see people who like instruments buy the
instruments piece, people who like semi cap buy the semi piece, people who like
hc buy the hc piece. After the spin, the wall street types won't have to THINK
TOO HARD to understand the company, and three pure plays are created that the
sell side analysts can easily follow. That means the buy side will hear about
it. Now there are three chances for a take out when there was one before. now
employees can be properly incentivized when before they couldn't. All this good
stuff will make the price EVENTUALLY move higher. It is physics Jeff. Shall I
go on?...

you got me on a roll...<G>

One that I have been watching for awhile is CLCX. I don't have a position in
the stock but have been watching it for awhile since the bottom fell out of it
last summer. I noticed it this afternoon when it took off for no reason on no
news. Looks like day traders got a hold of it which can beat heck out of a
stock on the pull back but I'm kind of curious what anyone else might think of
it at current levels. Seems to fit the general idea of value investing. Here's
the snap shot look at it:

Just dug out FGI while surveying a couple of hundred oil stocks today in an
effort to build a watch list of solid companies that could be in for a huge pop
when the sector recovers. Out of the 200 companies I looked at, FGI was my
third favorite! It's nice and small, but not too small. Market Cap somewhere
between 200 and 500 million if I remember right. The most compelling thing
about this stock I saw was that they have such an impressive streak of
sequential earnings increases from quarter to quarter and it appears they will
continue this, even through this slump. I will be following this one and doing
more DD.

The other too oils I found today were MEXP and INT. INT has no debt, pays a
dividend, (1.83 yield), and is less than 1.5 price/book. They are still
profitable and look to continue through the slump. INT services the specialty
high tech fuel industry. Nice small cap.

MEXP is perhaps even more fascinating. MEXP is an oil explorer/producer in I
think 3 states. MEXP is a micro-cap with under 100 million cap. They are still
profitable and earnings are expected to rise significantly in 99 and 2000 by
analysts. Best thing about MEXP. At 3 1/2, it is way under Yahoo book value of
4.94, and insiders have been buying heavily all the way down from 8. I may have
to buy some shares tomorrow. I have to find out why it has come down so far
first. Obviously not even the insiders know, so it may prove to be difficult.
