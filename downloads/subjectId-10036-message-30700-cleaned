Spekulatius,

Received the HTWC annual report in the mail today. The letter from the CEO was
not encouraging, hinting at poor performance coming up in the short term. He
also seemed pretty unapologetic about the performance since IPO.

Have you checked out the website? They have items such as a Home Equity special
at 4.99% and, under their lending center, 100%+ financing. I don't like,
especially with the loss reserves that aren't very high.

This stock is still too dirt cheap to sell, but it doesn't feel like anything
positive will be helping anytime soon, despite the Fed rate cuts.

What do you think --- I'd love to be told I'm wrong.

Oblomov, I totally botched EOG.

My decreasing brain cells with old age maybe. Certainly one problem with being
so diversified as I am, is the classic issue --- that a person who has so many
stocks can't keep track of them properly - can't really follow - what they own.
My case may be worse: so overly diversified that I missed understanding what I
DON'T own.

I'm a follower of Kurt Wulff who has long been recommending EOG. I believed I
had bought EOG shares based on my following his reports. Recently I noticed
though that I couldn't find EOG within any of my portfolios. I either didn't
buy any, or forgot somewhere that I sold shares I did buy.

I feel I'm sort of stuck now. The company now has a big $33B market cap, the
stock's doubled since July and is at highs. So I am reluctant to step in to
start a position. Seems too late. OTOH, Mr. Wulff still recommends it as a buy,
and the company does have a Bakken exposure. Further, I am adding to Bakken
stocks that are near highs now anyway, so I'm not understanding my reluctance
to step in for a few EOG shares. Mr. Wulff says buying is okay -g-, so maybe I
will start with a small buy of this one too. Not sure.

Fwiw, Mr. Wulff as of April 1, was recommending these "independent gas and oil
stocks" as buys

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=EOG,ECA,XTO,OXY,APC,DVN,CNQ,BRY,EAC,EPL&d=s

I hold varying sizes in all these except I have no EPL and no EOG
(unfortunately).

Apparently EOG has a larger % of its recoverable reserves in the Bakken trend
than any other midcap E&P company. And it has a lot of domestic gas exposure,
which is a positive. The ST bear case for energy stocks counts on a global
recession, but given the high demand for grain and beans right now, the
fundamentals for gas plays are excellent.

What about picking up EOG with a buy-write? The May 135s are trading at 5.70

HTWC - well it is true that the outlook did not sound all that optimistic. the
results for 2007 however were Ok and asset quality was excellent.

After you mention it, i found the link to the 100% plus financing as well. it
does seem to contradict what they are saying in the 10k:

 We will make loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 95%; however, we require
private mortgage insurance or other credit enhancements for loans with a
loan-to-value ratio over 80%. We require all properties securing mortgage loans
to be appraised by a board-approved independent appraiser. We generally require
title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Borrowers must obtain hazard
insurance, and flood insurance is required for loans on properties located in a
flood zone. 

What can I say? Most thrifts do not seem that shareholder friendly. Annual
reports are always very bland. I judge them by how they are doing not what they
are saying. I am keeping HTWC for now, it's a small enough position that it
does not bother me much either way.

No stock IMO is too cheap to sell - if you believe you can make more money
elsewhere you should sell, IMO. based on past experience, my enthusiasm for a
stock does not correlate performance however.

The HTWC letter actually had some pretty good information on interest rate
spreads, types of assets and liabilities, etc. If they have negative earnings
due to marks on their loans worsening, I have no problem with that. If they are
going to take a bath on bad loans and claim bad market conditions, that would
bug me, but there is still a great deal of cushion in the stock.

I disagree that no stock is too cheap to sell. There can be stocks too cheap to
sell. Cyclical stocks, stocks with significant bankruptcy risk, stocks bleeding
cash, etc are NOT among those. On signs of seriously deteriorating
fundamentals, one should get out, even at a large loss. Solid, under-leveraged,
below-book values plays with margins of safety can be too cheap to sell IMO,
for the following reason.

Value stocks can often languish and then move up quite dramatically at the most
random of times (ANS a recent example). Forecasting short-term performance is
notoriously difficult, and I think a true value investor should be prepared to
hold for at least a couple of years. Dumping based off short-term results is
generally a mistake IMO.

That being said, it is preferable to see a positive catalyst coming up. Fed
rate cuts should help lower their borrowing costs over time (as cds and other
borrowings reset lower), but with deteriorating credit conditions we will see
how the business goes. If management instituted a dividend or buyback that
would greatly help, but they haven't made any mention of those.

At any rate, if LTUS' numbers are correct/real/accurate, then it's undervalued

For a dirt cheap Chinese company, look at ETLT. But I definitely don't trust
the accounting. If the financials are legit, this is a no-brainer buy. I don't
believe they are legit. Company has legal issues and the market price (way
below book with low PE) is telling us that there is something fishy going on.
Whoever is trading this stock certainly knows more the situation than I do.

IMO the accounting on micro-cap US companies is much more trustworthy than for
Chinese companies. There are obviously some bad apples everywhere, but I think
you have much higher potential for corruption in Chinese micro-caps.

Rice Shortage Prompts Costco Calif. Rice Rationing

My wife told me that Rice was sold out at Costco as well as in several Asian
markets. This is pretty much unheard of since the 70's. many people are
obviously hoarding - the price of rice has doubled so far in Y2008. More
instances of this with some other goods and we have runaway inflation. Folks
will think that they can't buy what they need any more which basically means
that money is worthless.

This sort of reminds we off an incidence when i was visiting East Germany. I
was walking through Leipzig downtown, when we noticed a line started to form in
front of a store probably about 200 yards away. Nobody could see what store it
where the line was forming to and much less so why the line was forming.
All of a sudden folks around us started to run. A lady next to me was saying
"Look, there is something to buy down there..."

I guess you are right about bsic going up. from a poster on a different thread:

"The Bakken is THE hot spot in the US and we own part of over 13000 acres. 12
Oil prices in Co. are over fifty percent higher than Ray projected when he said
we would net over a million on those new wells and nat. gas prices are over
100% above his estimates. 13. Bad for the nation, but for BSIC- oil is heading
over $120- that is pure profit on all existing production 14. No dry holes in
CO., as Ray predicted. 15. Come up with your own- lots to be grateful for.

Now my speculation on the Bakken release.

First: The main reason I stay in BSIC is that Ray is a man of integrity- when
he says something will happen it will- we should drill in the Banks this summer
or soon after if there is some kind of mild delay.

Second, I heard there is production equipment hooked up at the Conoco Phillips
(COP) well on our doorstep- 2 miles south of our Banks field. I do not know if
it is our former scout of the area from about 2 years ago who told me, but it
may be. So this is my request:

Can our former ND scout confirm this on the board and let us know if they have
started clearing land nearby where some recent permits were requested? What are
you seeing out there at 31-152-97?

See I was trying not to say this and fuel speculation, but our old scout was
100% accurate two years ago. But I think it is true because as I wrote a few
weeks ago: It's On! There are a bunch of permits going off around the new COP
well. I listened to the hearings but have not seen permits, so I doubt there is
land being cleared nearby, yet.

All indications are that the Bakken is productive near our Banks field. The
wells cost $7 million. I am guessing, based on other Bakken wells to the west
of Mountrail at least 200bbls/day for this COP well near us- pure speculation,
but a recent COP well four miles to the east of this new well in the Bakken
just came off confidential status and produced over 19,000 bbls in its first
three months- over 200bbls/day for the first three months!. That the well near
us is a producer is a very logical guess, which I made before hearing of the
equipment. This well will come off confidential status in about two months and
then I will post its production numbers and the speculation will end. Until
then, be thankful for what we do know: we are kicking A.

Some deeper, ridiculous speculation: we were trying to reduce partners at our
Banks well, maybe Marathon will be a big partner there and maybe that is why we
got a little piece of their well, maybe more of those to come as a thank you-
about ten percent chance of being right here, but wondering. Maybe the new
partners are shaping up and planning on this summer because they know and like
the numbers on the nearby COP well- some people have to know these numbers-
maybe Ray knows them. I don't know sh-t about all this, just guessing. Spec at
your own risk. There is enough to be excited about without me speculating."

I know nothing about analyzing oil and gas companies so I tend to rely on
others opinions and analysis.

Its funny I always thought of bsic as a pretty minor position but with the
recent price appreciation and the decline in sil price the two are equivalent
now. Since bsic is a microcap, it looks like the potential to this novice is
substantial.

DryShips Inc. Acquires 33,254,576 Additional Shares and Launches Mandatory
Offer for Ocean Rig ASA
http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/080422/0389106.html

---------------------------------------------------------

This will give DRYs a total 4 UDW rigs with the option to acquire an additional
2 w/ delivery in 2011. If they are able to acquire the additional Ocean Rig ASA
shares at the offered price, the acquisition PE is around 4x expected earnings
if all new rigs are contracted at current rates.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DRYS,OCR.OL&d=s

The combined companies should generate 50% revenues from dry bulk shipping and
50% from UDW drilling. Assuming UDW day rates are contracted at the current
$600,000/day each UDW has a pay back of less than 2 years.

The value proposition is the combined company should have a more predictable
long term cash flow past 2011, they enter a tight market for UDW rigs where day
rates could go much higher based on global demand (especially in Brazil), the
overall dry bulk fleet has been trimmed and ship age is less than 5 years, and
free flow cash is substantial which can be used to reduce debt. Once management
consolidates the operations, I believe PE expansion will occur from PE 4 to PE
6-10.

Brazil leads world in ships that drill for deepwater oil
http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/bus/stories/042008dnbusdeepwater.2c

From the article:"..."We have renewed the contracts of five rigs for $4 billion
for five years," Mr. Barbassa said. "Nine others are being built in many
different places to be delivered starting next year. We're going to the market
to get more rigs because we're going to need them."

Petrobras says it expects to spend $112.5 billion over the next five years to
find and develop more oil and natural gas. ..."

There are opportunities for Texas companies to provide drill ships, tugs,
wellheads, pumps, undersea robots and lots of other gear, he said."

As much as I am energy bull, I think that most companies in the sector are
becoming fairly valued in this runup. This does not mean much, since bulls tend
to overshoot as bears do. I think companies are being valued for ~$80-90 oil
now though and no significant recession related consumption drop. I think that
gas plays may be even more overvalued, although it may be hard to say with the
huge runup of agro commodities that may require more gas.

I would be cautious adding here. Most Bakken and Marcellus plays you mentioned
look very fairly valued or even overvalued in some cases. Some Canadian
oilsands may still be cheap, some are quite expensive and most are very tough
to value. PBR is not cheap, but may be still attractive based on all the oil
they are finding.

The really cheap plays are mostly the companies with big refinery component. I
am not convinced refiners will do well and market agrees so far. However, we
may be wrong and then MRO, COP would be great plays here. PTR ran up with
Chinese plan of "subsidizing" refiners suffering from price controls. Although
I have position in PTR, I really don't like that it depends so much on the
government whim, so I won't add and may even sell.

I bought today a small position in GPOR mentioned on oil sands thread. I may
buy a bit of BSIC if it decides to swing down again.

anializer's pick here of Brazil's TNE.
There still might be some opportunities with these.

I continue to hold. Also AMX.

I guess the emerging telecom play most attractive to me now (today, at this
instant)would be the Indonesia Fund, in which I have a losing position.

http://www.etfconnect.com/select/fundpages/global.asp?MFID=3883

With IF you get Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk, which when I looked, is not
traded on our USA exchanges or in the pink sheets (i.e. with K or Y letters).

IF's portfolio weighting is 17% this telecom.

That's a main reason I bought the fund. And of course for the build-out/growth
of Indonesian infrastructure as a consequence of its large population and its
oil/gas/mining wealth.

All these (according to Yahoo) now have no debt and are trading close to, or

of other things going on. I am not sure I want to play them again. Although
HRAY's big loss is fake, since they just wrote down the goodwill and
intangibles. Otherwise they would have been close to breakeven.

Making some coin on SGP. Thanks again. This is from the yahoo board today...
---
Probably the best independent stock analysis firm is Morningstar. Morningstar's
analysis of SGP as of April 23, 2008. "Schering Plough posted strong first
quarter earnings Wednesday that were inline with our expectations. We are
holding firm with our fair value (Morningstar's fair value for SGP is 38).
Total sales surged 56% year over year as the company reported the first full
quarter including the Organon acquistion. As Schering continue to integrate the
Organon business, we believe the company can greatly improve its margins
through cost-saving synergies. Additionally, while Schering's cholestrol drugs
Vytorin and Zetia posted slight declines in the USA, they continue to generate
strong growth internationally. The international strength supports our belief
that the negative Enhance trial will weigh mostly on the US market. Further, we
continue to believe the overreaction to the Enhance data offers a reasonable
entry point for a company with minimal patent exposure and a robust late stage
pipeline."

Jurgis Bekepuris, what I like about ENI http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=E is
twofold:

Their aggressive engineering and construction subsidiary, Saipem.

"Saipem, a company listed on the Italian Stock Exchange (Eni’s interest 43%),
operating in offshore and onshore drilling and construction, and in the field
of engineering services to the oil, refining and petrochemical industries. It
is a world leader in the laying of underwater pipelines and the installation of
offshore platforms, thanks to exclusive state-of-the-art technology and a
world-class fleet of vessels."

I expect them to benefit from the Brazilian build-out.

Secondly, to be viable, ENI have decided that it's necessary for them to be a
player and with that, ENI has determined they need to be more accommodating to
oil-rich nations/national oil companies. (For example, they are going back into
Qatar after pulling out.) Therefore I believe we will see them do more deals
with countries like Iran, Venezuela, etc. -- areas where other large integrated
companies are loathe to make new investments or work as junior partners or
where such other companies are reluctant to work as contractors, or share share
technology. (I don't know the specifics of what E will or will not do. What
seems different to me about ENI is their realization that the national oil
companies now have clout and that they - ENI - have to deal with that in some
sort of accommodating way - not just walk away.)

Of course, with E stock showing a forward p/e under nine, and an almost 4%
dividend yield, that is all to the good as well.

TGS - decided to buy a little of TGS - the largest Argentinian pipeline
operator. Y2007 earnings were about 30c/share so the current PE@ 4.2$ is about
14 which is not particularly cheap. However earnings would have been higher if
not for currency losses - last year earnings exceeded 70c/share.

Further negatives are that the government is meddling in their affairs
(regulation) which obviously prevents them from raising prices. on the plus
side TGS has a fairly solid balance sheet is strong FCF (they have been
reducing debt).The company does not pay a dividend because of regulation.

Valuation is 5-6x EBITDA, 1B$ EV for 4000miles of pipeline, storage assets.
they probably could sell of the assets as scrapmetal and exceed the current
stock price. this could be dead money for a while but it is a cheap and if (big
if!) let's them operate in a reasonable framework they will be a multibagger.

AHD - is the general partner for APL. that's going to mean filling out a K-1.

While i have not done so, i do not think it's going to be that bad. All MLP i
am aware of will give you the k-1 info through their website. if you have less
than 1K UBTI income (not distributions and many MLP produce negative UBTI)
total in an IRA you go not have to worry about K-1's at all.

AHD is an interesting play because of the leverage of IDR (incentive
distribution rights), specifically in AHD's case. the current math works out
that every 1% increase in MLP distribution is equivalent to a 3% increase in
AHD's distribution. the problem I am having with AHD (and APL) is this
partnership has a history of sub par growth due to bad execution. Most mergers
in the past have not work out well for this MLP. however recently APL (and AHD)
have shown better growth, so maybe things are turning around.

As far as Marcellus shale is concerned, APL gas output from this area is only
<20% of their total, so it would have to grow a lot to become a big factor for
the performance of this MLP.

FWIW , I bought a little more MGG (the GP of MMP) today - 5.6% yield now and a
5% distribution growth QoQ. MGG/MMP is a refined product pipeline which us not
commodity price sensitive. Most midstream MLP have shown good growth recently
due to higher NG prices but that works the other way round as well.

Speculatius, I've found that K-1's can be pretty difficult.

1. Some companies make it easier by keeping track of your purchases and sales.
AHD and ATN do this (I believe). That is,as a shareholder, you can go to their
website and see how helpful (shareholder friendly) they might actually be. AHD
and ATN say the k-1 info they supply is in the form recognized by Turbotax, and
can be imported directly into Turbotax. This makes federal USA taxes filing
easy. I am expecting this to be so anyway, and is a reason I'll step into these
companies for shares. Note that MGG site, does NOT say they do this with their
K-1's. For me, unless I found the stock so very, very attractive, that is an
avoid signal.

2. I'm no tax expert. So my opinion is near worthless here: These oil/gas lp's
get their income from a variety of geographic plays over many states. It's
possible that each such state requires a state return filing as well,
especially if dollar amounts of 'income' are over a certain minimum. I see
small dollar amounts by state on the K-1's I receive, but my holdings such in
past have been very very small.

3. Before you linked to the the site earlier, I did not realize that the
dividends or returns provided by the limited partners could be quite a bit
greater than the calculated UBTI amount of $1000. Going greater than $1000
UBTI, in other words, might be a hard number to achieve. (Repeating here: if
lp's (i.e. K-1's) are held in an ira/401k and UBTI calculated from them total
more than $1000 per taxable year, then the ira/401K MUST (according to the
fed's) pay taxes on that excess. I.e. no tax deferral on the excess amount.)
I still don't find though where the calculation is that determines UBTI number
from the distributions received. I'll guess everyone
buys/holds/adds/reduces/eliminates positions at different times, and so the
calculation which figures UBTI I believe (not sure though) must take some
account of depreciation/royality/dividend/return of capital. I'll guess the
UBTI calculation is complex and/or a pain. And for someone with a small k-1 or
several small k-1's in an ira/401k -- say $30,000 worth getting maybe 7% or
$2100/yr. "income" therefrom -- I'm not so sure the UBTI calculation(s) can
just be safely ignored - either by wrongly assuming UBTI is going to be under
$1000 or wrongly assuming that the Fed's will never match up the company, the
company's k-1, and the stockholder with the 401K.

All jmo.

Thanks for the additional info. on AHD. I'm betting that as Marcellus is
drilled and gas transported, AHD with its pipelines, will be a viable
beneficiary.

Paul re K1 -
all larger MLP's are supporting K-1 via website. you typically need to type in
your name and SS (they receive this from the broker, I assume):

the interface does seem to look similar in all cases:
for MGG:
https://www.taxpackagesupport.com/MGGMultipleLogon.htm

So all is left to do is wait until March next year and then download (and pot.
edit the entries) in Turbotax.

Regulated pipelines without commodity exposure are relatively safe to own in an
IRA since they are very likely to produce negative UBTI, you have to be careful
with gatherers and Midstream companies (like AHD, APL etc.) that may have
hedging gains to smooth their commodity pricing exposure which can produce
large UBTI's.

for spotting telltale details in regulatory filings and earnings reports.

O'glove, 73, said he "learned to be even more cynical" through the
collaboration. "I used to spend some time talking to management, and Bob always
said that was a waste of time.""

I'm a fan of Olstein too. Especially if/when I can find reports of his
dissecting a company's financials. Past couple of years though Olstein seems to
me to have lost his touch for picking stocks that go up (Refer to his eponymous
funds.)

WWY - my hunch is that WEB is interested in Mars. it's a private company now
but if the owners ever want to sell out they know where to go to.

Mars is a company with a strong culture that would be easier to maintain under
BRK's umbrella than as a public company.

Olstein's picks from the article - Tribune. This may have worked out well for
Olstein, but one thing that I started to internalize even more from Buffett is
the importance of the long term macro trends. Even though Buffett still holds
his newspaper stocks - apparently he does not want to abandon them by selling -
I think that swimming against the current is hard. I got rid of GCI and do not
plan to reenter.

It's much nicer when the wind is blowing into the back than when they blowing
into the face. ;) Of course, for most industries this is not as clearcut as for
newspapers or for airlines ;). However, I am somewhat vary about such companies
I own as US retailers (though I expect a rebound), US defence (CRDN), HOG,
steel (PKX), and patent-based research-intensive pharmas. I still that oil E&Ps
still have a wind behind their back although a lot of them becoming fairly
valued. I also like China internal-facing plays such as medical and top
entertainment companies.

MLP - purchased EPE and some TLP. EPE is the general partner for EPD and TPP
and also owns a stake in ETE. it is constructed as a GP holding company (56% of
cash flow from EPD, 21% from TPP and 22% from ETE).

I bought it based on the strong results from EPD. i think this could become a
very LT holding. TLP is a much smaller MLP with a fee based business (oil
terminals, pipelines) which has shown strong distribution growth.

both of these are in my roth IRA and i believe that they will produce very
little or negative UBTI. I sold my WMZ as the price has appreciated from it's
lows. I believe the above two are better buys at this point.

I watch Cramer for entertainment purposes as I stir the pots for dinner, and I
think he may have come up with an idea worthy of a look see - APOG. Good PEG
and excellent forward looking growth, average to above average financials. It's
now on my watch list.

APOG - I don't see much exciting either in business or financials. ROE is low
to average. I'll skip.

If you buy into the Cramer thesis, their product line, particularly in
architectural glass, is a significant grower.
It's the company's "green" product line, which offers significant potential for
energy savings. Some of its window products offer blast protection, which is a
product for a different market.
