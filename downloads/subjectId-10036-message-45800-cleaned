Re GLW - another thing I failed to mention, does anyone have thought on the 25%
revenue slide for the Gorilla glass? I thought that product was at the
beginning of it's life cycle and if so, it should not shrink 25% qoq. I know
that both Schott and Nippon Electroglass have a competing product, so maybe GLW
is loosing market share? I don't know but it seems that GLW has issues on

OT The MF global bankruptcy is not exactly a macro event. Its a real problem
when investors have cash stolen out of their accounts and are then forced to
either come up with more cash or forced to close their positions and the CME
and the regulators all stand around going- we are looking into this, instead of
making investors/speculators whole. If most people did what the folks at IMF
global did they would be arrested and maybe out on bail if they could come up
with the cash. Why isnt this happening here?

It sounds to me practically this adds one more more wrinkle for investors and
more uncertainty in the market.
If your broker goes bankrupt, your cash may disappear, if you are on margin
your position may be liquidated at a moments notice and it may take years to
see a penny of your money. someone forwarded me some excellent interviews but i
cant post the link. i imagine you can find them at puplova/ financial sense/

I am not sure how much you can rely on these pre-spinoff numbers, but assuming
you do, the $2.1B net deficit is a big burden. Without it, E/EV is ~15% (350M
annualized / (1.7B market cap + .7B debt) ). With it, you are down to 8% (350M
annualized / (1.7B market cap + .7B debt + 2.1B) ), which is much less
attractive. Obviously, you can quibble about these numbers and how much they
are real, but they give some kind of estimate...

Re XLS,yes I agree that XLs 2.1B$ pension deficit is a big deal. I am miffed,
because the pre-spinoff numbers were in the order of 1B$ and 8 sort of relied
on that. I think part of the deal is that the pre-spinoff numbers are post tax
and the numbers now are pre-tax ( they mention a 800B$ deferred tax asset in
their latest numbers, which is roughly equivalent to income taxes on the 2.1b$.
Their latest presentation does not mention any of this (earlier presentation
did ), I found this in their first 10q.
I found this pension accounting to be very arcane, these liabilities don't run
through the income statement in the regular way, nor do they show up on the
balance sheet in a straightforward manner. I may have to consider my investment
in light of this obfuscation, as I see it.

I think you cannot generalize on these dinky stocks. Some of them are closely
held and barely budge on the market downdraft. Some have "weak" holders and
drop more than markets irrespective of their P/B, P/S, P/E or even P/cash.
Longer term P/cash gives you some protection, but depending on the company it
can trade below cash for extended period of time.

The biggest issue IMHO is the "roach motel" problem. If markets drop hugely and
you want to improve the quality of your portfolio by selling the dinky
companies and buying the quality bigger caps, you might not be able to do it
fast or at good prices. So IMHO you have to be comfortable with the fact that
you may not be able to sell that part of your portfolio for extended period of
time. For some people this would be 2%, for some maybe 80%. Personally, I'd
probably not put more than 20-30% into dinky stocks.

In case of microcap banks, I'd be more conservative, since IMHO there is always
a risk that they have one or few bad loans that can kill them.

EDIT: sorry, I see you asked about a single dinky company position size, not
about total size of dinky companies in a portfolio. Hmm, IMHO, this is even
more difficult to generalize. I had/have couple of dinky "roach motel"
positions above 3-5% of portfolio and most of the time I regretted it. But it
might be just me and poor choices. ;) If you have a strong conviction, you
could probably go to 5-10% in single position. But it is risky in multiple
ways.

XLS

Clownbuck, there was an adjustment to the amount of retirement obligation spun
off to XLS:

<as a result of third-quarter amendments to the U.S. retirement programs, ITT
Corporation re-measured its projected benefit obligations and plan assets for
certain U.S. and international pension plans. The re-measurement was as of
September 30, 2011, and resulted in an increase to ITT's net pension liability
of $661 million. The re-measured plans were primarily the salaried retirement
plan and excess compensation plan, which will transfer to ITT Exelis upon
completion of the spinoff on October 31. This increase in pension liability is
not expected to result in a material impact on the future ITT Exelis financial
condition. >

Again this is sort of obfuscating the issue, I think. The pension plans were
not significantly changed within the spinoff process, the benefits are not
different except that new employees are not eligible for the pension any more,
which hardly would change the obligation. So, the spinoff may have triggered a
-re-evaluation of the pension benefit but is not the root cause of the
increase.

What I think is not fair is doing the roadshow pre-spinoff with one set of
numbers and then executing a spinoff and posting substantially different
results somewhere hidden in the 10Q text (while leaving out entirely our of the
presentation for investors). And then claiming that 661M$ in obligations are
not significant for a company with a 1.7B$ market cap is just making a mockery
out of the new shareholders.
 This increase in pension liability is not expected to result in a material
impact on the future ITT Exelis financial condition . This may be one of the
cases where a company uses the spinoff of subsidies to dump unwanted
liabilities. Also keep in mind that the ITT stub got the asbestos obligations,
while they got a cash injection equal to the estimated asbestos. This is fine
of the pension obligation estimate is correct, if not they got screwed as well.

The CEO went with Xylem, which got the majority of the debt but otherwise has
clean books.

Accor: I've no good reason I can articulate to buy. I don't claim it's a value
stock. I'm buying because it's France's leading hotel company in all segments,
it got rid of ancillary activities to focus on hotels -- and they are good at
the hotel business. I guess to be expected given their size: "Accor, the
world's leading hotel operator and market leader in Europe, is present in 90
countries with 4,200 hotels and more than 500,000 rooms."

The stock is near a multi-year low (maybe nine year low), yet business seems
solid.

Commercial Metals Company Commo (NYSE: CMC )

Sold January $15 covered calls on the shares I purchased yesterday. I like what
Carl Icahn is doing by breaking out the recycling division and combining these
assets with his other steel recycle company PCS Metals Inc.

Icahn goes to Commercial Metals holders with bid
http://online.wsj.com/article/APf979e912536743669ab951e3a3681d29.html

From the article:"...Icahn had wanted to combine Commercial Metals with his
existing metals recycling businesses and sell off the rest of its assets,
refocusing on its core North American operations. Icahn already owns PCS Metals
Inc.

One obstacle the tender faces is that Commercial Metals' board would need to
lift a "poison pill" that's in place. Poison pills are typically implemented to
try to prevent hostile takeovers.

But Icahn said if Commercial Metals decides not to lift the poison pill and
waive a particular section of Delaware General Corp. law after hearing from a
majority of shareholders, he would leave the tender offer open and seek a court
order to get Commercial Metals to comply...."

-----------------------------

I believe the new company (if he can obtain the approval from the new board)
will be worth a lot more once the non core assets are sold (perhaps at some
discount). The new company should have much better growth prospects and deliver
higher unit margins. As a result, the PE for the new company should be higher
maybe in the low teens.

What ever happens it will be several months so selling covered calls awaiting
the decision of the shareholders is my strategy. Eventually, if a new more
profitable company emerges, I want some of those shares. If it appears that his
bid may win the approval of the shareholders, I may step up and add to the
position selling some naked Puts or just buying more CMC shares. PCS Metals is
not public but Icahn wants to merge his company with CMC, strip out the non
core assets and end up with a very profitable recycler.

My current position is small. The new company does fit in with my
garbage/recycle and natural resource theme as it may be more profitable to mine
steel and aluminum from recycled materials than virgin ground. There is no
"resource" tax on this material like what Brazil and Australia is charging the
miners in their countries.

Somehow, all the spinoff parts of the former ITT (ITT stub, XYL, XLS) look
worse than the entity before the spinoff <g>. Somehow, the cost of the spinoff
(>500M$!) the increased pension (~660-1B$ depending how you look at it - this
affects mostly XLS) and ITT stub having asbestos liabilities (offset with cash

XYL is machinery company (water pumps and systems) not Google. I have taken the
numbers that management represented at the time of the spinoff. They show some
good growth right now, but a lot of it seems to be recovery from the 2008/2009
slump so the current growth rates cannot be extrapolated into the future. XYL
management indicated that the estimate a mid single organic digit growth rate
(3-5%) with a little bit on top of that with acquisitions. Acquisitions in this
sector or generally not cheap, so it's difficult to generate shareholder value
from that part of the growth equation, so i assume just the organic growth
rates to value the business.

From what I can see, XYL looks fairly valued at around 24$, which i assume is
because water plays are currently fashionable.Obviously, if you are more
bullish and think that management can exceed it's the stated goals than this
stock will be a GAAP stock but i have a hard time making a valuation case here.

With respect to the macro picture, i expect the austerity trend in developed
markets as well as the building slowdown in China to put pressure on the growth
rates going forward, since much of XYL business depends on public funding.

clown - i guess time will tell. But i will only comment on two things -

One - water is not a commodity you can cut your budgets on. Austerity measures
might have affect on your food spend, but it will not affect your water spend.

And second, even discounting a 10% further decline in XYL Chinese business, i
am still north of 1.7 per share. I would build a small position and then buy
more on declines. But thats my take on this.

its def. a machinery business, but don;t forget, their foray into analytics and
treatment & testing technology.

>>One - water is not a commodity you can cut your budgets on. <<
Yes you can. Capex is always somewhat discretionary and you can cut it.

Austerity measures might have affect on your food spend, but it will not affect
your water spend.

It depends. Industrials may cut their water consumption if end user demand is
not there. In addition, water consumption/unit produced in the industry comes
down over time, which represents both an opportunity as well as a threat.

I still think that overall, XYL business is cyclical, as they mainly are in the
Capex - they do not have a significant percentage of their business in the
consumables, which follow more the razor-blade model and are not a
discretionary expense.

From that perspective, I like Kurita water (6370.T), which generates the
majority of their business selling water chemical and services (operating water
treatment plants and the like. This company has not had problems even during
the great recession but they don't grow much either, since 80% of their
revenues are in Japan, which remains stagnant. However their business model
seems great.

The closest company to that in the US was Millipore which I sadly never owned
and was taken out by Merck KGA (not related to US Merck any more)

Accor - AC.PA- earnings are about 1.3 Euro, dividend is 0.6Euro and the shares

significantly higher earnings power based on earlier results.

The sale of their prepaid business fixed the balance sheet and they are close
to debt free, except lease obligations. The stock used to carry a substantial
growth premium but that is not the case any more. I think they are good hotel

Industrial cut their water consumption - true. However, can you tell me how
will it exactly affect XYL in terms of its segment exposure, what it does and
how that will affect XYL reveneue and EPS? The only downside i am seeing right
now is in Building services which is approx. 23% rev in total and i have

You think XYL is a cyclical business - you might true. However their major rev.

Nikhijog -
I agree with you that XYL customer base itself is fairly stable and the
business is not as cyclical than other, my opinion is that Capex is always
somewhat cyclical. As for XYL, their revenue went from almost 3.3B$ in 2008 to
2.85B$ in 2009 (down ~14%) which is not as bad as other machinery companies
(Down 20%+) but not exactly non-cyclical either.

I am located on the left coast (NorCal) and definitely not from NYC. I use
EV/EBITDA as a quick and dirty way to value a business as an acquirer would do.
I bought into this idea since I read Greenblatt's book. I believe EV/EBITDA is
valuable, to compare companies across different countries, which have different
rules for taxations, depreciation and amortization. Since EBITDA is before all
these expenses and EV account for debt, it is a reasonable way to look at
valuation, besides FCF, earnings etc.

Nikhijog- Since you like riddles here is one (or two) related to XYL. In XYL's
corporate presentation, they reference these competitors:
Competitor A : 50% of their business is water related. They are of similar size
than XYL and with similar profitability metrics. The company trades at <10x
earnings, 6x EBITDA, >10% revenue growth YoY and a 3% dividend yield. (I bought
some shares this morning haha), They are located in a really nice country in
Europe.
Competitor A: Most of their business is water related, You probably never heard
about them unless you have a garden pont. It is a small micrcoap company
located in Asia and the stock was discussed in this thread this year. The stock
trades at ~10x earnings and is almost a net-net. it has an ~3% dividend yield
as well.

Hi Grommit -

Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. (CDR)
Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. Prefer (CDR-PA)

This is a pretty good find. I noticed that all of their property is back East.
Not sure I would nibble at the common just yet simple because I believe we are
not past the credit issues w/ Europe that could affect the U.S.. This preferred
is interesting especially if it sells off in any liquidity freeze up. In 3/2009
it sold down to $8.50/share (like many of the other REITs) so it becomes a
candidate in my market melt down scenario. It also looks like they did a 1M
share secondary on these preferreds on 4/11/2011 which probably included some
type of debt/equity restructure on the common too.

I like turnaround stories especially when management takes a large equity
position . B. Schanzer made a large bet in August (Aug 8, 2011
http://biz.yahoo.com/t/11/8576.html Officer50,000DirectPurchase at $3.91 per
share.195,500). The key for me is to be able to buy at a deep discounted
"value" price.

CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR)

Great news on CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR). This one is on my Buy list buy
I probably now need to up my target buy range. As you know, when the market
sells off, this one usually gets trashed too (my last buy was around
$13.00/share). My last sale (of my high priced shares) was right around this
price, so maybe I am a buyer again below $15.00/share.

STAG Industrial, Inc. (STAG) is just too new of an issue for me. I need to see
how management does over the next 18 months. I have added STAGpA to my
preferred watch list.

Of the REIT group, I still prefer the Data Centers as this is the sector that
is getting the growth (as evidenced by COR). I have no problem adding more (DLR
& COR) if/when prices drop into my value range.

IBM To Buy DemandTec For $440M In Latest Cloud Software Deal

<u>DemandTec's flagship product analyzes data to help retailers decide how much
to charge for their wares. </u>The company has added capabilities to track
promotions and work with consumer products companies.

IBM agreed to buy DemandTec for $13.20 a share, a 57% premium to its Wednesday

applications to help customers make business decisions. It's also the latest
purchase of a company providing software via the "cloud," which is installed in

~3% dividend yield. 350MCHF in net cash but they are spending ~600MCHF on an
acquisition.

Only 50% of their business is associated with water but the other business
lines are comparable in terms of economics . 40% of their business is in
emerging markets versus ~20% for XYL. Order intake is up 17% YoY in CHF not in
clownbucks! They survived the great recession very well

SUN.SW is a much cheaper (by about 30% in terms of EV/EBITDA), less leveraged

looking at the value case first, it's a no brainer to buy shares in SUN.SW

Position Buying - When to Average Up vs When to Average Down

My plan for AGL is to build a core position. It's my 2nd largest NG utility
holding at this point, MDU is my first. My last Buy on AGL was 12/07/2010 @
$35.40 right after the announcement of the NI merger. I had other buys in
5/2009 at $28.54/share. So now you continue to add to AGL at $40.00/share which
I see is at the higher end of valuation (at least from my take). The Forward PE
of 12 and a 4.4% dividend are still attractive as a value buy. I see $45/share
as fair value and at the top of the fair value range. So today's buy is perhaps
at a 12.5% discount to the fair value range.

How do you determine then to average up? Do you begin to peel off shares when
the PE approaches 15 (that is what I figure the peers sell for) and/or the
dividend yield falls below 4%?

When I follow your Buys and sells you do a very good job of buying at or near
lows. I just have a hard time averaging up my buys but I guess this is a good
thing in the long run as it means the stock is moving higher.

In the case of MDU, I have been acquiring shares in the $17-$19 range and
selling my higher cost shares at the $22.00 level. As long as the company stays
in this range, I am able to build a core position and even average down my
cost. Eventually, I see MDU breaking out (similar to AGL).

I see both companies building value but I have a hard time building a large
core position especially as the stock moves higher in price. <u>I guess the
best strategy is to buy enough lots staggered at different price levels (say
every 10% price level as long as it remains in the "value" range). On market
surges, sell and/or hold highest priced lots and on significant down days add
shares.</u>

On any negative significant company events, sell and move on.

Is this the way you set it especially if your goal is to turn the portfolio
every 36 months?

FBN presenation looks like they are improving many aspects of their
manufacturing operations in order to reduce costs.

They don't say, but based on past analyses of furniture business here (this
thread), it's the Chinese who have or have had lowest costs and largest
increases in production capability, and who have decimated Western
manufacturers.

I'm looking now at NTZ, the Italian leather goods --furniture-- company that
several of us bought back when it was a net-net. If I could get it at cash&cash
equiv value ($98.6M/54.2M =$1.82) or at 2/3 nca = 2/3 ($145M/54.2M) = $1.78,
I'd consider a buy again. Stock closed $2.25.

re FBN - the problem from my point of view is not just manufacturing cost, it
is the fact that their brands are dying and the furniture looks hopelessly
outdated. I am be biased due to being used to European style, which has become
heavily influenced by scandinavian style furniture since the 80's.

In any case, I believe they will be eaten alive by competitors like Ikea,
Target and others that offer modern styling. Another aspect to consider -the
furniture market follows more and more the hourglass market segmentation too
where there is a low end (sometime cheap chick, sometime but ugly) and a high
end with less and less in between. The middle will probably disappear and that
is where I see FBN brands.

I think my wife would laugh at me if I told her, I invested in a company that
makes furniture that looks like what they show on FBN website. The home
builders are at current level a crapshot too, most have been working hard to
stay liquid but the losses continue to eat away their equity. This might be a
case where most end up going into bankruptcy and where it pays how to play the
