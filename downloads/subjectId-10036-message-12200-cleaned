my dear bob- Look at hard asset values of these companies. They were built from
ground up and not from goodwill laden acquisitions. As development projects
that are now coming on-stream your cash flow analysis is a rear view look in a
mirror that is completely inapplicable. The value trap was the fact that this
was a complex empire of small piss-ant companies that had related party
transactions that were illiquid. However, the combination of all these
companies into one removes this main 'value impediment'.
a) reduction of complexity and creation of simplicity;- which one to buy?-
there will only be one to chose to buy or not;
b) reduction of related/affiliated party transactions and rebuilding of trust
with investment community;
c) combining several small companies into 1 larger company- better chance to be
on someone's-anyone's radar screen.
d) Also substantially increased liquidity. (If cdl shares are issued at mkt
value of both crg and rdge, less all the shares of CDL already owned by CRG and
RDGE there may around 20 million CDL shares outstanding).

There are few ways to play this as it evolves- appealing to arbs and value
investors alike
a) immediate arb between crg and crg pfd- these securities are economically
equivalent (but for voting rights). Yet common shareholders have always been in
minority to cotter anyway. In addition, Cotter has been on record several times
saying there is no difference between the two and a few years back issued crg
pfd to crg common holders as equivalents. Also, crg pfd has $6/share
liquidation preference over common. If the securities are getting CDL stock,
its no different than cash deal. Thus until they are in parity, arb of equal $
DOLLARS short common and long crg pfd would create net long shares of CDL on
completion of deal for free. Note, once the definitive terms of ratios are out
crg and crg.pfd spread will vanish in a heartbeat.

b) value long play- Stub CDL on combined company is extraordinarily cheap (note
release- combined book value of $100MM at 12/31 does not include the likely
gain from acquiring 'minority interests' of crg/rdge at market price far below
their book values- that gain will add to the $100MM) but its always cheaper to
play stub via owning target. Thus RDGE and whichever is cheaper of crg.pr or
crg common are best way to play this as value long.

New suggestion: CATS Catalyst Semi

that are done, and certainly the industry decline will hit them, but at these

Took a look at CATS. I get a NetNet value of ~$1.34/share based on the data in
the most recent 10Q I found at EDGAR(up from ~$.34/share on 10K), this is well
below the current market price of $3.28/share. The Beta is 2.2 so the stock
price of this company is over twice as volatile as the market.

A brief look at their numbers from previous years(as reported in the recent
10K)indicates that they go into the red very quickly in slow business climates.
However, they seem to be quite a bit more profitable for the same revenue
dollar in the door than they were 4 years ago. Although you point out that they
had some tax loss carryforwards from previous years, the profitability that I'm
referring to is reflected in the much lower cost of goods sold.

The company appears to be CFO and FCF positive on both the 10K and the 10Q(with
data for 6 months since fiscal year end).

Overall, since the price is well above the NetNet valuation and it has a very
large Beta, I would say it does not hold the "margin of safety" referred to by
Graham. However, if you take FCF and divide it by 6%(my approximation of stable
risk-free rate of return), the FCF I derived from the data in the 10K would
indicate a value of $4.35/share. I get a much higher valuation if I use the
higher FCF indicated on the 10Q, but in this slowdown, I don't think it would
be prudent to use the higher number as it is probably fleeting.

The price to book is interesting in this company because tradition book value
calculations are based on stockholder equity and stockholder equity was
negative 2 years ago, was ~$10 million on the 10K, and went to ~$29 million 6
months later. This appears to be quite manic to me and confirms the extreme
volatility of this company's price.

As a long term value investor, I think I would like to see how the numbers look
after this current downturn in business climate before committing any money to
it.

Brendan W., fwiw, I'm trading out of a couple of the stocks we both own or have
owned:

I've sold my position in SKO. Stock is still undervalued imo, but I've lost my
confidence. Seeing the business as half empty vs. half full. Their difficulty
in being a Wal Mart competitor. SKO stock is up from lows (but way down from
past high). Taking what profit I can now in this tough environment for
retailers.

Sold my UNM position. I've got my double or so, and I don't see now where the
company or stock is going. Further gains possible with UNM, but I believe I see
better values elsewhere. (And I've been wrong many, many times.)

--------------------------------------
I'm starting an exploratory position in SKP. They're a physician insurance
operation based in California. SKP sells at about 21 with a book value of 32
and not-so-great profits. Of course, it's in a competitive business and one
that seems to engender policy mispricings that can have devastating results to
a company's earnings. For SKP, I'd be looking for maybe a good year to show 10%
ROE and the company stock to be selling then at book value.

CATS: I would not consider it. First place, some people I know who have spent
careers in the industry don't like it. Second, on an objective basis, they
spend 5% of sales on R&D. R&D is the life blood of a semiconductor company. Try
to find another one with that low of a %. That suggests they make low end
commodity products for which demand and pricing falls off a cliff in tough
times. If you normalize R&D to perhaps 15% of sales and normalize taxes, what

Paul, added to my position on AAPL on Friday.

It is not a NetNet, but I believe it's size, cadre of loyal users, new
operating system(OS-X), inventory reduction efforts over the last 6 months, and
current price levels offer a reasonable margin of safety.

I'm in this time at 22 5/8.

From a technical perspective, the 10DMA has crossed the 200DMA to the upside,
and the price has exhibited a long rounded-bottom basing pattern which it
appears to be ready to break out of to the upside.

I equate Apple users to Harley riders. A small portion of the overall
population that loves the product and are loyal beyond expectations. To me,
this constitutes another type of "barrier to entry" and, in the box makers, I
just haven't seen any other brand loyalty that is as intense.

I am recommending a close look at SFP, Salton, not SPF,
Standard Pacific. For buy and hold investors, SFP is a humongous bargain!
Closed Friday at 16. Book is over 20.
Earnings were down for last quarter and will be down for
its 3d Q but will be up for 4th Q ending June. Average
estimate for its FY ending June is $4.84. For FY 2002
starting 7/1, average estimate is $5.04. SFP said last
Nov. it will dedicate $50 million to buying back its
stock. Spent only $5 million of that as of 12/31. There is a huge short
interest in SFP stock that is going to get
squeezed when earnings turn.

I don't know how close a look at SFP(Salton) you want.

I calculate a NetNet value of ~$1.86/share with a current price of
~$16.00/share, I would not call it "...a humongous bargain..."

For the latest 6 months, Cash from Operations(CFO) was a negative 32 million
dollars; Free Cash Flow(FCF) was a negative $3.07/share.

With a slowing US economy, and new and much tougher bankruptcy laws about to be
finalized(which will seriously curtail consumer spending, IMO), with the loss
of the George Foreman arrangement(I saw a story about this a while ago, but I
forget the particulars now)which was behind their successful sales of outdoor
grills, I just think there are better places to invest.

I just don't see the catalyst for this issue to sustain any increase in
valuation. Do you? I mean, just because it is low relative to where it was,
doesn't mean it now has to go up.

I've owned SFP in the past. Have made money on it, and lost money on it. Until
I see a turnaround in the business climate, and the impact of this new
bankruptcy law on consumer spending, I think I'll take a bye.

It's true that SFP's cash flow from operations for the
last six months was -32 mil. But it had 79 mil more in
receivables at the end of December that it had at the end
of June. It also spent 5 mil more on capital expenditures
tooling up for new product introductions, spent 5 mil more
on marketing (including a Super Bowl commercial for the
George Foreman line which it STILL has) and bought in 5.4
mil of its stock and made significant acquisitions.
For "true believers" in the net-net evaluation of book
value, it's also true that SFP is trading a little over its
"net-net" book value. But to get to your "net-net" valuation you have to
exclude not only $45 mil in good will
but also $133 mil in patents and trademarks that, for a
consumer goods company like Coke or Salton, have "real" value.
In any event, there are several "catalysts" for SFP
stock to rise significantly over the next six months. Any
adverse impact from revision of the bankruptcy code will,
in my opinion, be NEGLIGIBLE relative to the beneficial
impact of the Fed rate cuts made to date and those yet
to come (Fed is widely expected to cut rates another 1%
at least over the next six months), as well as the tax
cut that is in the works. Just from mortgage refinancings,
consumers will have more money in their pockets six months
from now than they do now.
Moreover, SFP itself is a direct beneficiary of the rate
cuts, inasmuch as it was carrying $145 mil in fluctuating-rate, short-term
debt. ($145 mil x .015 = $2.175 mil +
$1.45 mil for 1% rate cut yet to come). So I see $3.5 mil
in interest cost reductions annually on its short-term debt.
Plus it has over $220 mil in long-term debt, and I have to
believe it will be able to refinance or restructure some
significant portion of that favorably as well. Even exclud-
ing any savings on renegotiation of its long-term debt,
a $3.5 mil saving on its short-term interest costs seems a given and will go
straight to its bottom line.
Of greater significance in my view is that fact that over
40% of SFP's stock float has been shorted and will have to
be bought back in. In November, SFP said it would spend
$50 mil to buy back its stock. As of end of December, it had spent only $5.4
mil of that warchest. Since there were
only about 12 mil shares outstanding as of the end of Decem-
ber, the stock buyback alone will dramatically shrink the
share base over which its earnings are calculated even if
it does not stampede the shorts into covering.
Finally, the company is launching several new products
this year that will start shipping in significant volume in its 4th Q ending in
June. The Company already has warned
that its 3d Q ending this month will be weak (average
estimates are for .73 v. .95 last year), but is anticipa-
ting an upturn in 4th Q earnings (average estimates are
for 1.12).
All things considered, I am very comfortable buying SFP
at 16, having George Foreman as a significant "partner,"
and holding it for long-term growth. If SFP can earn $4.84 in its fiscal year
ending June 30 after a LOUSY Christmas,
what can it do if we have a good Christmas next year after
the Fed rate cuts to date and those to come have had six
months to work their magic?

Steven,what do you think of immunex(imnx) after the recent collapse. FWIW my
strategy was to buy 1000 shares and sell 50 vyjal(Jan 2003 60 calls) to
establish a position at$6 per share. This gives you 50% downside protection and
forces you into a long term hold. If the stock climbs over time you add to
position at 100 shares every 5 points. This augments the position on dollar
cost averaging basis and virtually eliminates any upside risk. Biggest risk is
a whipsaw performance on the stock. This can be moderated by using a larger
increment for example 10 points per buy. IMHO the options would be at no more
than 10 dollars if the stock does a five fold advance in one year. If so the
position would be positive even without augmentation(60-5*10)=10. If stock
collapses as the bear market progresses you can close out the position with a
significantly less costly loss than buying uncovered shares. I think that imnx
will be in the low 20's in two years and if so this is a very good yielding

Oops. My pick of USI collapsed a bit. First, Bill Nygren of Oakmark funds, who

sometimes do with dividend payers), I would've sold out my position at this

However, given that USI is a substantial and diverse manufacturing company, I'm
willing to believe that when (if) its businesses recover, USI stock will too.
USI has sold for better than book value many times in the past, and I will bet
it will do so again within a couple of years. Given that the stock's about 6

I'm starting a position in Manpower today. MAN's earnings estimates were just
cut and the stock downgraded by Goldman Sachs; as a result (imo), the stock is
trading now near its low for the year.

MAN is still expected to post earnings gains this year and next. MAN has showed
revenue increases for many years. Accompanied with increases in ltd though. D/e
ratio (.73) is now relatively high. Another possible negative: For those
watching insider buys, I see only sales. (some at 34 in Feb. MAN's trading for
about 28.6 now). There's a dividend - growing but tiny.

From my perspective, MAN, at its current price, offers an opportunity to
upgrade a portfolio (mine anyway -g-). One gets a dominant, multinational
player at a decent and relatively low p/e, and with a relatively low p/s also.
ROE in most of the past few years has been roughly in the 25% area. Book value
is growing and now about $9. According to my interpretation of Yahoo's report
of institutional holdings, several value funds are or were holders of the
stock.

It's a buy now for me too!

Chris,

I sold my shares this morning on the open at $7.81.

The after tax proceeds wound up being about $3.00 per share less than I had
anticipated. I think that removed whatever margin of safety existed. It wasn't
a total surprise to me. I think SFN pretty much got stiffed based on the what I
have heard about the market prices of their competitors in Europe. But it was
sort of a distressed sale and the management blundered by putting themselves
into a position of having to go with the IPO even though the London market has
been tanking with the US and the price was very poor. It was bad management
plus bad luck IMO.

I never did see a prospectus on what the remaining operations will look like,
but I was able to make some rough guesstimates based on the the numbers I saw
for Michael Page in the various releases.

I annualized the "cash earnings" (added back the amortization) of the 4th
quarter minus a rough estimate of MP's contribution. Then I worked out various
scenarios for the cash.

I still believe the stock is a decent value, it's just much less certain and
there is less margin of safety at the lower proceeds. The operations are almost
certainly going to weaken further during this year.

My own feeling was that over time there was a decent possibility that they
could cut expenses and get margins up from the depressed 4th quarter level even
if the business shrunk a little. So I wasn't really viewing the long term value
as being a function of the current earnings level or the predicted poorer
results over the next few quarters.

I had a few better and more comfortable ideas so I ate my $1.50+ per share loss
and moved on.

I intend to continue following the situation. I always learn more from my
mistakes than my winners.

I am with you on this one. I am in process of liquidating as well.
Unfortunately, this is one of those that I should have known better. Unlike
you, I wont follow this one again, I think this line of business is low margin,
cyclical with virtually no barriers to entry. Not the makings of a good return
unless it is a net net. This makes 2x I have lost money on temp agencies.
Hopefully, I wont do it again.

On a different note, would you care to share some of those better ideas. I am
at a loss for new investments and so I am predominantly in cash now. I happen
to like bamm and awx at current prices and will probably add on weakness. I

Little early on ldp. Love their business model and unless there are shenanigans
in their insurance operation IMO this one will be a two or three bagger in 2
years from present price of 4.6. Added a little today and will pick up another
3 or 4 hundred shares every 3-4 weeks over the next many months.
For those who are vulture investors, look at vert. The company seems to have
good partnering instincts. I added 600 shares at 1.66 today and sold 20 Jan 03
10 calls at .5 for net cost of zero. Strategy will be to add slowly to shares
if price should rise above 5. Obviously no downside risk except for holding
costs and very little upside risk unless buyout occurs( a cold day in H).
For arbitrage investors I still think bche may work out.

crg/rdge looks better today

When you say 'how it looks', I am not sure whether you refer to stock chart or
balance sheet.

can't/won't discuss stock chart as this is value board and discount to hard
book has gotten much larger.

As for balance sheet, over past two years cash has been deployed in purchase of
land and contruction of theater exhibition properties in australia.
Carrying/operating costs while contructing and an unprecedented decline in
Aussie dollar have primarily reduced book value. Current balance sheet also has
the mildly profitable 2nd largest thater chain in puerto rico written off. So
today, it looks BETTER to me as I get bigger discount to book which has upside
of
a) nearer term cash flows from finishing build out of austrailia and new
zealand;
b) any value from puerto rico chain
c) upside on aussie dollar vs. us dollar

fwiw, regarding ALLC: This one's been discussed here several times before. As
well as on other SI value investment sites that I'm familiar with - dividend
plays and 50% gains threads.

In looking closely at ALLC's past stock performance record, the company has
been an EXCELLENT performer if one has reinvested one's dividends into the
company. ALLC, as well as a somewhat similar company, ACAS ought to be reviewed
by those who are looking for value picks. (That's imo of course, and based on
my evaluation of ALLC's past performance.)

ALLC has afforded investors opportunities at stock prices below today's closing
near 20. However, given ALLC's past good business results (a recent brokerage
house downgrade though might be an indication the future will be a little
tougher), and ALLC's rising and near 10% dividend yield, I'll likely be adding
to my already full position in this stock on Monday if I can get near today's
closing price.

Whoops. I see I can still buy ALLC at a reasonable price in after hours
trading. So I'll pick up a bit now.

I need some help !

I have bought a bunch of smallcaps over the years and know anything can happen.
But this is a situtation I have NEVER experienced and I dont know what to do.

I had bought & traded with some sucess EDIN over the years.
I had thought they were on the verge of an earnings breakout because I kept
seeing insider buying.
Then, things kind of fell apart. They canned the president, brought in the old
guy who the president had replaced and they had a bad year. The stock was
killed falling about 75% but it is trading at about 1/4 of book value and a
fraction of NCA.
The stock was under a buck so I anticipated a reverse or being sent to the
OCTBB.
I was shocked when last week they announced that EDIN
" will not pursue its right of appeal to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel
regarding its potential delisting"

I was even more shocked when today..."Educational Insights Files for
Non-Reporting Status
CARSON, Calif., March 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Educational Insights, Inc. (Nasdaq:
EDIN - news) announced today that it has filed a Certification and Notice of
Termination of Registration under Section 12(g) of the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934 on Form 15, seeking to terminate the Company's reporting
obligations. As a result of the filing, the Company's obligations to file
quarterly, annual, and special reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) have been temporarily halted.

Reid Calcott, the Company's President and CEO stated that: ``In view of the
Company's pending delisting from Nasdaq, as well as the low trading volume and
the limited number of shareholders, the Board unanimously agreed that the
benefits of reducing the costs and management's time associated with preparing
and filing the forms required of a reporting company far outweigh any
drawbacks. Without the obligation of filing these reports, management can focus
all of its attention on returning the Company to profitability.''

Unless the Form 15 is rejected by the SEC, the Company's obligations to file
any reports with the SEC will permanently cease within 90 days. If the
de-registration is successful, the trading and liquidity of the Company's
common stock will be significantly diminished as the Company's common stock
would no longer be eligible to be traded on the Nasdaq stock market or the OTC
Bulletin Board. However, the Company's common stock would be eligible for
trading on the pink sheets.

Educational Insights, Inc. designs, develops and markets a variety of
educational products, including electronic learning aids, electronic games,
activity books, science kits, board games and other materials for use in both
schools and homes. The Company's product line, including its most popular
product, GeoSafari, appeals to children as well as students ranging from
pre-kindergarten to adult and is designed to make learning fun. "

What the HELL is going on ? I have NEVER experienced this and I am no stranger
to little stocks.
Are they TRYING to run the price into the ground so they can buy it back cheap
or what ?
How can this be consistent with their fiduciary duty ?

What should I do ? (Other than express my concerns to the company and the SEC
?)

My heart goes out to you on this one!

Looks like lost money to me. If their situation is so dire that they can't
afford the basic costs of remaining listed, then they appear to be in severe
financial straits.

You're a pretty savvy person, what would you advise someone to do if they wrote
to you with the message you wrote to us?

I think you'd urge them to get out of the stock and salvage what little of
their original investment they can. And to try to learn whatever they can from
the situation. And to not dwell on the loss as it is part of the price exacted
when risk is assumed. It wouldn't be risk if it didn't sometimes exact a toll.

As far as what you can do with the company or about the company's situation,
I'd have to ask: "How much of your time and money are you willing to throw away
in the endeavor?" I'm sure there are a lot of options open, shareholder
revolt(but what good would it do if the majority of shares are owned by the
folks that made these decisions?); shareholder lawsuit(but where would that be
prioritized if the company goes belly-up, and how much would it cost to get
there?); file a complaint with the SEC(but would they investigate a company
requesting to be removed from their requirements?); etc

If it was me, I'd look at the amount of money I could recover from disposing of
the shares. If I couldn't get enough to cover the transaction costs, then I'd
get the certificates issued in my name(as opposed to "street name") and throw
them in my memorabilia drawer(who knows, maybe someday they bring the company
back from the brink). If I could recover enough money to pay the broker and
still get some cash, then I think I'd do that and move on. I would, in either
case, include the loss in the results I use to analyze my performance using
whatever investing/speculating strategy that I was using that got me into that
trade.

That's my two cents.

Again, sorry to see you have this loss!

Hi Paul and Board!

Thought I'd share the results of the following screen that I ran this morning.
I've not had time to research any of these, I'm just providing the whole list.

The screen was done using "Market Guide", I used one of their preset screens
and then modified it by deleting some of their parameters and adding some of my
own.

Here are the screening parameters:
ROE >= 25 AND ROI >=20 AND ROA >= 10
ROE/ROI <= 1.2 (this was one of their presets, and I'm not sure of its
implications)
OPmgn5YR>= 5 AND OPmgnTTM>=OPmgn5yr
SALES%chgTTM > SALES5yrCGr
PE TTM<=SALES3YRCGr AND PE <=12

The companies that met all of the above criteria were: ACLNF, AMK, ASMI, AVX,
BELFB, CAMT, DRAM, DIOD, DHULZ, ESIO, HELX, IVIS, MKSI, PLT, SBR, SNDK, SAWS,
SILI, MARY, TELOZ, TER, TIRTZ, TOPP, VSEA, WSC.

Using the "details" and "profile" views on Yahoo, they look pretty good
preliminarily. A couple of them appear to currently be Bulletin Board stocks
and I didn't look any closer at them. A lot of Semiconductor-related stocks,
which makes sense given the hammering that sector has taken.

Madharry: re: LDP's div. yield.

about: "there is no evidence that the dividend yield is 6%."

You might be right; as I review my file, I can't simply confirm or define what
the current yield is.

Here's stocksheet's stuff:

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=ldp

I see from the 3/13/01 press release that the final dividend will be 18 cents
per share gross. There are two issues for me here in trying to calculate a
yield: the timing issue related to semi annual payments when a dividend is paid
in one year but possibly related to (and also reported in the financial
statements???) in the prior year. More significantly, that "gross" amount is
before a 20% Jersey Income Tax (and a 2 cent per ADR fee). According to LDP's
annual report, "The Jersey tax deducted is not a withholding tax and therefore
there is no corresponding foreign tax credit." So that tax is not recoverable
for us American taxpayers, as I understand it. The ADR dividend is reported net
of the Jersey tax amount, and it was .928 in both '98 and '99. That's pre the
split; so I make the dividend in those years to be .232 post split. Because I
can't now trust the Stocksheet figures, and by association, the Yahoo figure
(it shows .29 current), I have to back off on my statement that the yield is
6%. I'll just guess that the yield currently is closer to .232/4.5 or about 5%

And as is typical with European and particularly (in my experience) British
companies, the dividend amounts often vary up AND down among years. I interpret
their policies as providing their stockholders with rewards commensurate with
the performance, or lack thereof, of their companies. In good years you get a
share of the good profits; in bad years the dividend is less to reflect less
profit. This is in contrast to our USA companies of course, which, if they are
companies that pay dividends, usually shoot for consistency in dividend amount
or in dividend increase.

I added some AREM Monday too. A key point from their March 28 presentation -
when AREM closes a deal they don't book all the license revenue up front. It is
distributed over the length of the project based on quarterly performance
milestones.

So AREM never backloads its quarters and sweats closing deals the last few days
in hopes they can make their quarter. The license revenue backlog gives them
forward visibility over several quarters for some projects.

From what I can see, AREM is one of the best-run software companies out there.
But the deluge of rumor and hedge fund shorting has really pounded the price.

It may take several months to get back to a reasonable value for AREM.

I was surprised you mentioned hedge-fund shorting. The short interest has been
low [1%]. Do you know anything specific as to who's shorting.
I've suspected the selling is coming from funds facing redemptions and Driehaus
[was largest institutional holder, whose website indicates proclivity to sell
on weakness]. Brandywine is largest fund holder, but I see them as
value-oriented and unlikely to sell based on price weakness without fundamental

To me, AREM's recent drop is proof that all the hot air on Wall Street about
fundamentals and earnings is total crap, at least for the small caps.

Auric Goldfinger slammed AREM several times on SI - it is widely known that he
runs a hedge fund. And the hedgies tend to run in packs. Of course, Goldie
couldn't read the 10-K accurately concerning AREM's geographic distribution,
but hedgies only care how the share price moves.

The selling has been peculiar in that the sellers sit on the ask through INCA
and dump thousands of shares without moving up. If I were a trading desk trying
to work large blocks for a fund, I would move up the ask to maximize my average
price. OTOH, if I were shorting the stock and wanted to keep the price down, I
would do just what I have seen on INCA.

The short interest numbers are too old to be useful.

It's likely the funds are selling some. This is the only business I know where
major players systematically undermine the value of the assets they need to
generate revenues from customers (i.e. funds dump large blocks and crater stock
prices).

I plan to hold AREM for as long as they execute well and remain undervalued.

shorters would hang their hat on that. While I never shorted LHSP, I followed
the situation and it was very different from AREM.
If there is a large short position and AREM continues to perform, they're going
to help fuel a helluva rally once the market finds the elusive "Price too low"
Your first comment on fundamentals rings true - I had sold half my prior

the markets for many years precisely because of the crazed herd instinct that
takes over from time to time.

To all: it wasn't long ago that COMS was discussed here and got a number of
favorable opinions at the $6
level. I admit that I was one of the supporting voices. While most of us seemed
to think it was uncertain in
the short term and should be good long term, it is now down a quick 20% or so
to about $4 3/4.

So, what does everyone think now?

Buy more, hold , or bail?

I'm tempted to buy more, but the way the NASDAQ is reacting, not even CASH is
creating a floor for prices
(COMS and many others).

Luck to all...............Eric.

I didn't buy COMS despite the favorable cash position because it looked like
negative CFO & FCF would chew thru it in about 1.5 - 2 years. I suspect they
will hunker down and conserve cash, but still it didn't and doesn't look that
attractive to me. I haven't studied COMS very deeply so could be off base.

I took a position in COMS, using margin money.

Probably would have been alright as a trading move if the whole market had not
tanked big time.

Like you, I thought cash would be a floor. They certainly have some technology.
Great time to buy stocks, but I'm all out of cash, and won't go more into
margin.

Greenspan wanted something like this to happen. When asked if he should not
have reduced rates sooner, he said no, because that would have impeded
necessary financial adjustments. In other words, kept technology prices from
falling hard. Maybe he was right to do it. I suspect there will be a lot of
history written on the subject. I think he lost track of his own stated goal:
to keep the currency stable. Would not doubt we will soon be into deflation, as
soon as oil prices drop (presuming they do with the world economy down, and the
unity of OPEC becomes frayed).

part of the economic slowdown is due to higher energy costs. It is interesting
in that energy service stocks, E&P, etc are showing weakness now due to
thinking that slower economy = less demand for energy. But that is only
thinking halfway through. When/if energy prices drop, that in turn stimulates
the economy, creating demand. Hopefully, in the interim the necessary
infrastructure can be cobbled together to get the gas, oil, methane, etc to
those who need it. Just think of all the btu's being created by the burning of
sheep and cows in Europe. Why burn them in ditches or fields? Give the dead
cows to families to burn in their wood-burning stoves. Most Englishmen own
chainsaws anyway - cut their legs off first, then the head etc., drain the
blood and let the carcass sit in a sunny spot just next to the window to dry
out. A couple weeks later, you have fuel for the winter.

FWIW -- I am just looking into this one. I will report back when I have further
info.

PRDS -- Someone came to me with this "Hot Tip" quite a while ago -- I think it
was trading for around $18.00 per
share at the time. The 'rumor' was that it was supposed to be bought out. I
passed on it (as I have trained myself to
do after many tips -- bad ones!)

I continued to watch it only out of curiosity and today the stock trades at
$1.25 per share.

Per Yahoo, the company holds $83.9 million in cash. There is no debt. The
company caps out at $36.7 million. i.e.
it trades at 43% of its cash position.

The company is some sort of Telecommunications consulting company and grosses
$88 million per year. I believe
they lost around $4 million last year.

I am unable to verify the above info because I am having trouble finding their
10K (I will look on their web site for
it -- just thought of that).

Just thought I would pass this one along for anyone who might be interested.

I am not buying yet.

Hi Eric,

I bought, posted about and held COMS for the past couple of months. At this
moment it looks like a bad play.

They are restructuring (cutting jobs and product lines) but I am not yet
impressed with the predicted cost savings. I do not have the number in front of
me but they managed to burn through more of their cash hoard than I had thought
they would. Despite that I believe they are currently trading below cash.

The only thing that I have done well in the past few months is to buy stocks
and sell them into the next small rally. This has given me 15%-20% gains on
high-risk, small positions.

I am currently considering whether to buy more of take the remaining loss. I
have cash but perhaps not the conviction.

PRDS looks pretty decent to me at this price $1.32 or so.

$2.50 per share cash at 12/00. No debt. Not much, if any, cash burn. Hopefully
able to scale down to meet spectacularly reducing demand for network

We need to know what has happened in the quarter just ended and if the $80
million cash is still there.

If there is a clue that the new CEO plans to rein in costs quickly, then this
might be a nice asset play.

That cash looks good. But there are red flags everywhere. CEO & CFO both jumped
ship. A boatload of goodwill. 29 cent loss for the last quarter. No insider
buying & lots of selling over the past year.
Positives are the $3.96 tangible book value, their $3.52 per share in net
current assets and the $2.06 per share in net cash.

Its worth keeping an eye on certainly, but I have a feeling sizable losses
could continue to be reported in the next few quarters. "``The effects of the

D.I.Y. Home Warehouse, Inc.
Reports Net Loss

D.I.Y. Home Warehouse, Inc. reported a net loss of US$8,392,000 for the fiscal
year ended December 30, 2000. Included in this year-end results was $1,241,000
in inventory markdown costs and US$2,245,000 in net store closing costs. In
comparison, the company reported a net loss of US$1,632,000 for the fiscal year
ended January 1, 2000, which included US$1,773,000 in inventory markdown costs
and US$2,083,000 in net store closing and development costs.

Net sales for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2000 decreased to
US$75,646,000 from US$128,478,000 during the same period a year ago due to
additional competition from national warehouse retailers in the company's
markets and fewer company stores. The Company's gross profit percentage
increased slightly to 26.5 per cent during the fiscal year ended December 30,
2000 from 26.2 per cent during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2000, though
both periods were negatively impacted by the aforementioned inventory
liquidation markdowns.

CRG/RDGE- few responses

1) The lack of coverage presents value gap opportunity. Do you want to own
something before or after analysts discover any investment? I don't contend
analysts will come running to this investment but only that the factors that
have turned off both you and others are being remedied and one can buy
investment before or after such event. Before the value-unlocking event is
always more costly.

2) If the value were more clear to the 'casual reader' then the 'value gap'
would not be as deep. Look there are companies with visible catalysts and there
are companies with less visible catalysts. The more visible they are, the more
the value will already be in the price.

So you want analysts and clear value for anyone casually to see and then have
it not already reflected in the price? Nothing is free here. How resourceful
and less casual you are will determine how much profits you may earn. The rest
is just plain luck. For that you can go to vegas and put your money on black
and at least get a free drink and a show!

3) The small cap nature of these individual companies ensures a large index
population. However, reviewing the holder list on bloomberg, I would consider
the institutional ownership of the components pretty impressive value players.-
First Pacific Advisors (Bob Rodriguez) Pacific Asset Mngmt; Artisan partners;
Lawndale Capital Management; Wachovia (Special Value); pine asset (hoefer &
arnett) Private Management Group and First Manhattan

While Beauty may be in eye of beholder, riches will be in pockets of the more
diligent. The merger transaction is intended to mitigate your issues. You can
wait for the transaction to be completed this summer and then wait for a few
10-Q's or even the 10-k. My belief is that the stock price of the combined
entities in CDL will be lower or higher than today's $2/share price? (combined
tangible book will be around $6/share or more); IMO- RDGE and CRG's are cheaper
way to own the CDL stub.

Hi, Grommit. Nice moves in a couple of our stocks today! Grommit, do you have a
current opinion on JBX that you can share. It's been downgraded due to its
Calif. energy exposure. It was an old Mike Burry pick (at lower prices, I
believe), and I know you've had a position in JBX also.

Looks relatively undervalued to me compared to its fast food peers, but price
still might be too high to begin accumulating a position????

I bought more GLW, an initial position of ORCL, and more TXN yesterday. Not bad
timing, eh? :o)

I bought CAG last week, to get quality in a non tech sector. I decided "no" to
IBC due to legal liabilities.

There are so many quality companies screaming to be purchased. My portfolio is
gaining class every day. But I think I have done all the reshuffling I need for
awhile. I will sit back and wait for the setiment to rebound.

(I sold off all my BARR, which I had a lot of, to fund my recent buying binge.
And I sold a couple of losers which came back some/most of the way, after many
months.)

I hope you still have NWPX. I wonder what's up. I started buying at 13, and
added more in the $7s and $8s.

Grommit: I also have GLW (having swapped NT for it to capture a tax loss). Have
become a bit cautious with this sector though. Here's an interview with Ravi
Suria, discussing funding issues for the sector:
http://www.thestreet.com/markets/marketfeatures/1359535.html
I think GLW is as good a play as there is in the sector due to diversification
in areas like LCD screens...but there still could be pain ahead.
Regarding restaurants, I really liked the look of OSI but got cold feet when I
saw the huge amount of insider selling, including Peter Lynch, who I beleive
owns or has owned several of the franchises, apparently dumping his entire
position.

Affirmative, Grommit. Still holding NWPX; also CAG, APPB, OSI, LNY among stocks
which you've mentioned.

In addition to looking at JBX, I'm also considering IHP. Make a lot of their
money from franchisees. Plus they own real estate that's worth more than book
value (or so I have been told). Both just seem iffy to me though at current
prices.

The WSJ had an article, mostly about LU, in which they mention that fiber

Thanks for the tip on OSI. I was looking at the insider selling and thinking of
selling, especially with "steak" in their name and the cow problems. I was
going to sell the OSI and buy more JBX. I think I will now.

At least 2 of us are here, Paul.

Picked up VCLK last Tuesday at $2.90, a Michael Burry pick on the MSN site. The

Re ALLC, you may want to review it's exposure to telcoms through it's loans.
JJR1998 on the Yahoo! ALLC thread has documented it quite thoroughly. His view
is rather more cautious of ALLC's near term future and the safety of the
dividend.

Paul, my recent activity is ...
Added to Kroger (KR) at 22... this is a Bill Nygren pick. PE of 15 on expected
earnings growth of 15 percent. I added to positions I picked up last year at
$14 and $20. The company has a lot of debt but it is investment grade. I like
the competitive position of Safeway and Kroger against the rest of food
distributors, especially their affinity cards.

bought picks suggested in this thread: Valueclick (VCLK)... a net/net that I
think has a sustainable business and Jakks Pacific (JAKK)... toy manufacturer
selling below book value with rapidly growing revenues but some margin
deterioration and a PE under 6.

Bought Acxiom (ACXM) at $11. Previously it took a 50 percent haircut on an
earnings warning. At that price the PE was around 11. The company "…is engaged
in customer data integration in support of customer relationship management."

Bought Mellon Financial (MEL) at $36. The forward PE was approaching 15.

Added to Wendys (WEN) at $20. I started a position last year at $17. The PE was
under 12 and expected earnings growth is about 10 percent. I still hold YUM and
Diageo.

Added to my Manpower (MAN) position at $28. (I still hold my $22 position that
I acquired in 1999 at the same time I bought Robert Half at $12. I am watching
RHI.) As you know the MAN is selling at a PE under 12. In the last day or so
there have been earning warnings on the staffing companies.

Added to International Flavors (IFF) at $21. This is a former Berkshire
holding… the leading flavor/fragrance company, I think. I added to a losing
position started in the $30s.

Added to Etrade (ET) at $5.XX. The company was below book. I mentioned this one
before.

Bought Novell (NOVL) at $4. At that price and subsequent to the Cambridge
Technology acquisition the EV is approximately $1.4 billion. The company has
consistently generated $300 million in operating cash flow the last 3 years
which I hope won't be hurt by the acquisition. The company has over $600
million in cash and short term investments with no debt. The company has an
additional $400 million of (for me unidentified) "long-term investments". One
fund manager estimates there is $300 million of real estate FMV which is not
reflected on the company's pre-acquisition book value of $1.2 billion.

Today I bought Medallion Financial (TAXI) at $9. Per Yahoo: "Medallion is a
closed-end management investment company whose principal activity is the
origination and servicing of commercial secured loans. TAXI also operates a
taxicab rooftop advertising business." The company's book value is around
$10.50. It's trading at a five year low. 90 percent of earnings are distributed
as dividends and the yield is approximately 10 percent. Last year the company's
debt was investment grade, but it has been downgraded to BB+ by Fitch. In the
past the company has been able to issue commercial paper against its taxi
medallion loan assets. The Yahoo thread is pretty good on it and the company
recently released its 10K. A corporate officer appeared on CNBC today, hence
today's price action.

I sold Burlington Northern at $30. This was discussed here last year at $20.
Also, I threw in the towel on USG common at $12 (along with Bill Nygren and
Marty Whitman). My average cost was in the thirties.

Most of this is quick and dirty analysis... please do your own due diligence
and offer any corrections.
