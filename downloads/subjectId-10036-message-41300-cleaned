Arsenal is a Bakken shale oil developer that looks undervalued to me if it

Hi Geoffrey - What do you do when your company's stock is selling at a 23 year
low, sales are declining and analysts rate your company at "underperform"?

You promote the executive that continues to generate the majority of free flow
cash for the company, runs a very efficient state-of-the-art supply chain
business, and may have some "new" fresh ideas for integrating the "supply
chain" & store vendors w/ in store merchandising to move more product.

Supervalu names new merchandising exec
http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9KJM22G0.htm

From the article:"...Haugarth will be responsible for all merchandising
activities across the company's traditional retail and independent retail
businesses. This move consolidates the leadership of all of the company's
merchandising activities, with the exception of Save-A-Lot, under the
leadership of a single executive vice president.

Haugarth, who the company has said has been with Supervalu for more than three
decades, will continue to oversee all supply chain and logistics
operations...."

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Integrating the successful Supply Chain Business into the merchandise store
retail side should bring the efficiencies of the Supply Chain closer to the
customer. The key is to get the store vendors "linked" into the company wide
store supply chain system(s) so point-of-sale logistic information (including
vendor sales statistics) get transmitted back to the vendors. This will make
sure product is on the shelf especially for units serviced through the vendor
directly.

I envision that the larger vendors will utilize Supervalue's supply chain
warehouse and fulfillment services in place of their own out-of-date
inefficient delivery trucks. This will take some costs out of the system that
allow lower customer prices and higher margin to Supervalu.

This will take at least 12 months to integrate through out their stores and
will only impact a few of their top tier vendors. The promotion of their Supply
Chain executive Janel Haugarth as its new executive vice president of
merchandising and logistics is a real plus. Many of the analysts did not even
mention this division or the promotion of Ms Haugarth when they issued their
recent downgrade.

I sold more of GPOR today, but I bought NXY and ESTE.

IMHO, a lot of small cap E&Ps are getting priced to perfection for continued
high oil prices. I'm also concerned that both this thread and some others are
getting dominated by small cap E&P "opportunities". People are throwing money
at any E&P that haven't made any money and are not even close to making money.
But sure it's all because they have great resources, so what do I know... ;)

On the other hand, IMHO Peak Oil is pretty much here, so it's possible that
marginal plays will 10-bagger from here even though they look overpriced.
(Somehow, people were much less excited when oil was at $40 and prices were 1/5
to 1/10 of current...). Personally, I would rather buy the cos that still don't
look overpriced at all. NXY is still a buy and a huge underperformer so far. E
and TOT are still buys although I hate the refining/distributing parts of these
super majors.

So, no, I would not sell at your prices. And GLW is also still a buy, though
not as cheap as before. I should have bought more of it, and I hate chasing it
up, but I might.

A correction might be nice, but it's possible that we won't get it this year if
economy continues to do fine. We may be climbing another bubble based on
economic recovery and easy money. It's not a bubble yet though, so the climb
might be pretty easy.

Hello Jurgis,

I agree with you about E&P's. I'm much more comfortable holding the big caps
(TOT, E, NXY) these days than the smaller ones at these levels.

But, if Egypt takes the prices of those companies up to my target levels here
in the short-term, I would trim my position to some extent and take profits.
But, if Egypt calms down and the price slowly heads up to those levels in the
medium-term, I would have to reassess.

I agree with you about GLW that I wish I had bought more GLW under 20. Too late
for me now to add, in my view, but definitely holding.

My overall concern is that the stock market is continuing to head up without a
correction. I'm feeling less and less comfortable at only 5% cash and I'm
looking to take some profits, even in oil.

Thanks,

Example 1: Broken TV. I did a google search and found that culprit most likely
would be a bad Electrolyte capacitors. I went to shack and got 4x1000uF

discounted toy for 10$ a well. I was able to fix the broken TV the same day.

Example 2: Smartphone purchase. I decided to jomp on the Optimus V deal with
Virginmobile. This is an decent Android for 150$ that works well with the
prepaid 25$ plan (300min, unlimited text and data). The phones sell well and
other locations were running low on inventory. I checked online RSH inventory
checker, which indicated that a RSH store around the corner from work would
have it in stock. Picked up a 10$ coupon from the net, went there and a very
nice clerk set me up with the phone, sold me an Airtime card (25$ for the first

Peeled off a few shares of COP as oil approaches $100/barrel. On the last cycle

Picked up close to a full position in Penn Virginia GP Holdings, L.P. (NYSE:

I am focusing on several of the mid-cap domestic oil companies or other large

Yeah, I'd like to see that too. Might reduce my dismay at what I perceive has
been the one-sided nature of Korea/USA trade.

I found it very difficult to buy small amounts of Korean stocks -- the fees or
expenses that had to be paid to the Korean intermediary broker and/or exchange
just prevented a buy. Symptomatic imo of Korean protectionism vs. USA more open
market, which the Koreans fully take advantage of.

Haven't looked lately, maybe things have changed. I'll be surprised. Until
then, I hold the opinion that the only practical option for the USA retail
investor is to buy Korean stocks through a fund.

Imo to take advantage of what seems to be consumers' desires for many Korean

It appears that Target is building their own Supply Chain business and its
impacting Supervalu's business. Target also whats to expand into Canada and
will need a supply chain vendor (or build their own) to provide services into
that region too.

It will be interesting to see how Supervalu responds (other than shutting down
warehouse facilities). From today's news it appears this is exactly what they
are doing but it's only a 10% downsizing rather than a complete shutdown.

Lots of negative news and analysts downgrades. Yesterday huge OI expansion in

auditor should be held responsible by the SEC, because if we cannot trust

GFRE is also one of my top holdings and along with other Chinese small-caps
took a "CCME" hit today. I estimate a forward PE of 5 at todays close because
bromine prices appear to have increased alot since their 3rd qtr report where
they said prices averaged $2,700. Both the published bromine spot price and
ALB's 4th qtr. report indicate current pricing of at least $4,000. I presume
GFRE's realized prices don't exactly follow spot due to fixed priced contracts,
but they did mention in November they are re-negotiating contract prices.
Together with the latest salt field purchase that wasn't figured in their 11/10
guidance, the forward eps estimte by analysts of $1.67 is probably low and
possibly very low. A wild card is their cost of production which increased in
the third qtr on flat sales.

Increased bromine prices plus increasing production less increased cost of
sales equal at least $1.80 eps next year? If so, GFRE is selling at 5x forward
earnings, has a sqeaky clean balance sheet (no AR or inventory issues), has a
share repurchase program and Big 4 Deloitte is looking them over.

I added more today at $9.15. What's your current thinking on GFRE?

I have a pretty large position in GFRE, so though the stock is pretty cheap, I
have not been adding. There have been some short accusations against GFRE too,
but so far they have not been taken seriously. Nobody knows whether there will
be a big bear raid on GFRE some time or if it will be spared. If the company is
clean, the price is very attractive. If it's not or even if there is a
concerted bear-smear campaign, the price will plunge.

You have to evaluate for yourself what kind of position you are comfortable
holding. After yesterday a number of value investors threw in the towel on
Chinese small caps. I did not, but I understand their reasoning.

I also think that the shorts are helped by supply-demand imbalance. The number
of US-listed Chinese small caps is increasing all the time while the percentage
invested in such companies across mutual funds and possibly private investors
is not rising at all. Most funds are still USA focused and even the Chinese
focused funds are mostly not buying USA listed small caps. Also remember that
Chinese indexes were level to down last year, so the momentum crowd also left
Chinese equities. So the supply-demand balance is not good for bulls. If China
liberalized listing on Chinese exchanges, the situation would change a bit, but
right now small caps have very tough time to list in China so they go for the
pretty bad market here.

As far as I know, GFRE has announced a share repurchase plan but has not done
any purchases yet. Why?

Deloitte is reviewing their procedures. This is not the same than auditing
their financials:
per press release Sept 10:

The objective of Deloitte’s engagement is to assist the Company with an
independent assessment of the managerial, operations and internal controls of
the Company. The independent assessment will cover the areas of the Company's
Corporate Controls, Anti-Fraud Program and Financial Reporting and Disclosure
Controls. In addition, Deloitte will provide suggested recommendations to
improve any internal control weaknesses, if identified.

I am not aware of any results from this audit either. Correct me if I am wrong.

The way I look at it, GFRE has failed to follow up with anything they said they
would do last year in September. "Watch what they do, not what they say"!....is
my rule. Red flag, imo.

reason why GMXR stock is at the bottom too. That said, at an EV value of a

volatility and most inexperienced investor and many experienced ones panic when

Here is my take on the situation (lifted from gunnar @ investorhub because he
summarized it better than I could). I can understand your disgust with the
situation. Even if the MW/citron reports were deisgned to help shorts cover I
doubt it was illegal (MW for example compares old published information against
recent company information and wow of course it doesn't match up). I think they
can just claim sloppy research (who knew?). But its a reason I don't like to
way overweight an issue even if fundamentally it is undervalued (any one stock
can always have problems or be manipulated)

 This is a great, a short who is supporting CCME in strong terms. He calls out
Muddy Citron more effectively than we longs can in a some ways - very cool.

"I find very little difference in the quality of work Citron Research did with
CCME and the average penny stock promotion email I get countless times daily.
The biggest differences I assume are Citron Research is short CCME and that
CCME is traded on NASDAQ."

---

"Looking at the work by Muddy Water Research and I find in my opinion the same
level of research performed. "

---

"Top institutional holders include Goldman Sachs, Ardsley Advisory Partners,
Morgan Stanley and Vanguard Group. The amount that institutions are holding is
growing as well. It’s possible that CR and MWR are the smartest guys in the
room compared to the institutional CCME stock holders but given the choice I am
going to place my bet on Goldman Sachs over Citron every time."

---

"Saving the best for last we see the mother of all numbers. CCME short interest
is a whopping short squeeze nightmare for anyone who is short of 6.44 million
shares. With a float of about 10 million shares this means that more than one
out of every two shares out there is shorted. Fourth quarter 2010 earnings
report is expected to come out next week. If the numbers beat expectations it
could kill the shorts as they scramble to get out of the burning inferno that
would be cooking them alive. How do you get out of a large short position right
before earnings without taking a huge loss? One idea is to issue a “research
report” on why you believe the stock is a total fraud. Prices fall and you get
out just in the nick of time. There are no coincidences on Wall Street."

---

There is much more, he does a point-by-point rebuttal and goes over insider
buys as further evidence of a phony 'fraud' story... a great read and an
important voice on the short side.

There are market mavens calling for pops, drops, and anything else you can

Spekulatius summed it up nicely. Management does not have a very good track
record spending their previous money very efficiently. They do have excellent
land locations. I expect more experienced JV partners will be used to develop
these wells.

Their cost of capital seems a bit high (higher than MHR) but they were able to
sell these notes through a private placement offering w/o too much of a
problem.

I would like to see how they re-structure their current credit facility and if
they use any of the proceeds to pay off other LT Debt. There should be some
announcement(s) on other JV ventures (perhaps w/ XCO) where it will be clear
where these funds will be used.

I would welcome more NG gathering infrastructure development. In 11/2009 they
monetized their previous investment by selling a 40% interest in their Endeavor
Gathering LLC. subsidiary to Kinder Morgan.

Deal Watch: Kinder Morgan, GMXR Close Pipeline Transaction

http://currents.westlawbusiness.com/Article.aspx?id=af9f1b64-f38b-4b7c-adf7-6fc
f7e834aa

From the article:"...GMX Resources (GMXR) announced that it has closed a
transaction in which GMXR and Endeavor Pipeline Inc., a subsidiary, transferred
mid-stream gas gathering and compression, to a newly formed company, Endeavor
Gathering LLC. Kinder Morgan will subsequently purchase a 40% interest in
Endeavor Gathering LLC from GMXR for $36 million....".

The article shows the financing they paid off and the loan rate & terms used to
finance the deal. Notice that they incurred a $5 million prepayment penalty to
unwind their previous financing arrangement. That works out to be about a
1.5%/year interest expense penalty for their deal which totaled $181 million.

Their new notes total $200 million w/ 11.375% coupon and are non callable for
48 months (4 years). The new equity offering of 20 million shares will double
their outstanding shares and provide $100 million of new working capital.
Basically, they need to show their road map for deploying these funds to
produce a similar size mid-stream gas gathering venture for their new wells
under development w/i four years.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is where they probably will do some of their new development:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Even with all of this, I have lowered my long term price expectation from
$30.00/share to $19.00/share. A lot depends on the price of NG (long term which
I believe will be higher) and how efficiently they deploy the $300 million in
new capital. The risk reward is still quite positive a potential 2 bagger IMO.

GMXR is less than a 1% portfolio position (and is one of 10 E&P in my basket).
I have a low cost basis and hedged 25% of my shares by selling the May 2011

Re GMXR notes

I believe they were a private placement and not available yet to the public. I
have a pretty large position in the MHRpC that yields 10.125% and distribution
are paid monthly.

Many of these E&P companies since my buys, have issued more shares and/or debt.
It's a very capital intensive business but these announcements really hit the
stock price in the short term.

Yesterday Callon Petroleum Co. (CPE) announced a secondary of 9 million shares
(about 35% dilution) w/ no price announcement! Stock cratered down 18% then
back up 10%... who knows what it will do when they announce the final price. It
seems that if you pick up shares at or below the secondary offering(s) it's a
pretty good entry point. Then if the company had previously traded options, you
can hedge your bet on any run up higher by selling some covered calls. Many of
these smaller E&P's do not trade options so your hedges are limited.

My strategy is to focus on the mid cap and smaller cap E&P companies (rather
than the very large integrated oils especially for new buys). Some of the
companies that provide support services to these E&P companies look interesting
too. Complete Production Services, Inc. (CPX) & GATX Corp. (GMT) (GMT suggested
by Paul Senior http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=27146427 ) are two
that come to mind.

Many of these companies are benefiting from the domestic growth in shale
fracking and their new well development (including NG gathering & processing
operations) have a much larger impact on their current & future earnings (when
compared to the lare integrators). To generate an appropriate dividend income
from my sector buys, I have bought preferred shares and have hedged my bets by
selling some covered calls.

So, basically no interest in the GMXR debt especially if it is thinly traded.

re CHL - took a starter in CHL @48.3$ today. I like CHL because they have the
largest market share in China (60%+) and adding customers at a decent clip
(10%+ net additions).

My investment thesis:
1) Smartphones will come to China and ARPU will go up
2) Their huge market share and the economies of scale that go with it will give
CHL a cost advantage that translates into a high profit as it has in the past
3) Slow RMB appreciation will provide some extra appreciation since all of CHL
revenues are domestic (for those that calculate gains in US$ that is)
4) Attractive valuation (11x earnings) and very robust balance sheet no net
debt
5) Proven management

Negatives:
1) Government interventions almost a possibility
2) Investment in Banks (Pudong Bank, see above)

I don't think that markets are in cloud cuckoo land. I think they are in the
Value Investor's no-man's-land though. I.e. we are not in crash cheap area
anymore and we are not in the bubble where everything is super expensive. But
we are way up from lows and value investors don't want or like to chase stocks
up. We are on the wall of worry: should we buy stocks that are still somewhat
cheap or should we wait for correction? It's hard to pay up for stock that was
10-20% cheaper couple months ago, so there's a lot of self-justification for
not buying because "stocks are not so cheap anymore".

Since I see a lot of megacaps at pretty cheap valuations, I think that market
will continue to climb. I am not a market timer or random event prognosticator,
so I don't know if it will climb pretty straight or if we are going to get a
correction like last year. I have some cash and positive cash flow, so I mix

opportunities.

Not sure this answers your question and concern. :)

CSCO: I sold Jan 18, 2013 puts, 17.5 strike for 2.10/share
I will keep adding if the price continues to fall. I also have a full position
and will double it if the price falls another 20%.

Preferred stock fund: I hold a good-size position in two Flaherty & Crumrine
preferred stock funds, PFD and PFO.

The Flaherty and Crumine operation does more in-house work than I had known --
they run their own credit ratings which I knew, and also though, their own
trading desk (which apparently is unusual):

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Investing-In-Preferred-twst-2917407911.html?x=0&.

"Mr. Crumrine: In terms of our philosophy, we begin on a bottom-up basis and do
all our credit work internally. We have a credit group in our office in New
Jersey. As a relatively small shop, which we certainly are, we are able to do
this because the preferred market is so concentrated by industry. It is
somewhere in excess of 95% banks, insurance companies and utilities. These
three industry groups constitute the vast majority of the preferred market, and
we have very experienced analysts focusing in each, in addition to the other
small percentage of the preferred market that is not in those three industry
groups. So it's bottom-up, credit driven.

In addition, we manage our portfolios right on the trading desk, which I think
is a little unusual. In a typical investment advisory firm, some portfolio
manager will make a decision regarding investments in a portfolio and those
transactions will be executed by somebody else. We don't run money that way; we
actually run the portfolios right on the trading desk. Two of our four partners
are traders. They make the portfolio decisions based upon input they are
getting from our research group. Hence, I think it's a little unusual in terms
of how the firm is structured."

I view a preferred-stock fund having their own traders as a positive.

$35 million of the proceeds will go to pay down their LT debt (13% senior notes
due 2016). Company paid a $4 million prepayment penalty to restructure their
old debt. Good for the long term as they now have sufficient cash to drill a
few more wells and will save over $5 million a year in interest payments w/ the
lower LT debt.

Good point. I need to adopt your perspective and care less about short-term

Hi Paul -

Re: Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred I(NYSE: PFD )

Maybe it is time to get back into PFD. I cleared out of my position in 9/2010
at $12.95. Bought my original position @ $ 11.85/share in 5/2010.

The new dividend rate for PFD is $1.08/year which yields 9% at the current
price of $12.00/share. I just don't like paying those annual management fees
(.625%) and the leverage they use to juice their yield. However you do have the
flexibility of instant diversification and the liquidity to enter and exit the
fund.

EKS

FWIW - Finally closed out all of my BDNpC bought at 1/2 price in 2008. Trying
to peel off shares of FRpK & FRpJ (which currently yields 8.5% price adjusted).
Therefore, these funds will be looking for a home and the PFD fund may provide
a good parking place.

Hi Madharry - Price target of $10.00/share. Lot's of unrecognized value still
in this stock.

Jefferies Finds Ultrapetrol To Benefit From Estimated Increase In Soy
Production (ULTR)

http://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/11/02/850733/jefferies-fi
ds-ultrapetrol-to-benefit-from-estimated-inc

From the article:"...Jefferies is reporting that Ultrapetrol's (NASDAQ: ULTR)
growing river business is expected to have a strong year after the USDA
predicted soy production increase in 2011.

“Yesterday, the USDA Foreign Agriculture Service updated their monthly world
agricultural production estimates to include a substantial increase in
Paraguayan soy bean production for 2011, which should result in meaningful
growth for Hidrovia barge trade, the report notes.

“With Ultrapetrol controlling the only barge building facility of any size in
the Hidrovia region, we believe the only incremental capacity likely to enter
the market will be ULTR vessels. Assuming no older barges are scrapped during
the year (likely scrapping should actually be close to 50 barges),
Ultrapetrol's jumbo barges should add about 4% to total market capacity in
2011.”

Jefferies reiterated Ultrapetrol's Buy rating and $10 Price Target...."

re NOK - down 14% today after the decision was made to dump their own software
platform (Symbian) and use Windows Mobile instead. This is an interesting
decision since Windows Mobile has only a very small market share (2%) and
suffers from the same problem that Symbian had - lack of apps.

I think NOK is going to have a tough road ahead for themselves.

FWIW, I recently jumped on the Smartphone Bandwagon. I purchased an LG Optimus
Android phone (~150$) and signed up for the 30min/unlimited data/ unlimited
messaging with Virgine Mobile (Sprint reseller). So far, so good - the phone is
great but Sprint service so so (coverage, data speed). Worth the 25$/month I
pay for it, imo.

It's going to be tough for the Handset companies to differentiate themselves.
Only Apple has done this successfully but those countless companies that are
offering Android phones are basically in a commodity business (Motorola, LG,
Samsung). I think the Koreans (LG, Samsung) are used to that but I am not sure
about Motorola.

It will be interesting to see if NOK and Windows Mobile can gain some critical
mass -if not NOK is toast.

IMHO CSCO is still not cheap and I am personally not sure whether they have
bright future in front of them. I may relook at them if stock falls to ~$16
area. (Not predicting the fall, just saying that I won't buy above that level).

This is why I sold the put and didn't buy the stock. This way if it gets to 15
I will get the stock if not will keep the premium. I think CISCO is undervalued
at 14 PE. They are the leader in the high end equipment. The acquisitions they
made and the investments in new fields will pay off very well. At least the
probability is good IMO. I cannot see in the future too :)

Good Investing,
