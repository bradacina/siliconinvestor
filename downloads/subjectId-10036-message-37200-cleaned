Thanks - just some ideas that I needed to research a little more:

Timberland - no debt, >15% RoE over 5 years. I think you're right on this PE
being high - it is unlikely to go anywhere and be re-rated by the market, so I
will leave it for now.

DJCO - certainly a cigar butt, with 23% 5yr RoE, no debt, market cap of 96
against cash and ST investments on balance sheet of 63. On closer inspection,
20.7 of "other equity" has just cropped up in the past full year and did not
arise from operating cashflows. I can't work out what they are playing at -
amateur investors?

Book value 12/31/09 - $12.32

But - In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued accounting
guidance that requires the consolidation of certain special-purpose finance
entities into the Company’s financial statements, when adopted by the Company
on January 1, 2010. While we have not completed our evaluation of the effects
that this change in accounting will have on our financial statements, we
anticipate that our net worth, leverage and book value per share will be
materially adversely impacted as a result of the reversal of previously
recognized sales of notes receivable, the recognition of the related,
non-recourse receivable-backed notes payable, and elimination of retained
interest in notes receivable sold. Accordingly, we expect to record a one-time
non-cash after-tax adjustment to shareholders’ equity in the first quarter of
2010 of between approximately $35.0 million to $55.0 million as a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle.

Hello Dr. I,

Well, I've sure been thinking about this as the market has continued to climb
and I've been finding less promising value stocks/prices. I don't know if a
correction is coming, but as we've gone up, I've been hedging a bit by:

1) Taking profits and putting them into closed-end funds selling at a discount
including CET, CHN, HQH, and PEO.

2) To hedge for inflation, I've been trying to find some values in
Oil/Copper/Gold stocks.

3) I have a couple of foreign stocks selling around cash value with growth
prospects.

And that's basically my entire trading portfolio. I'm not raising cash. That
being said, I feel like if we go up, I still participate, but if we go down,
I'm hoping that my stocks/cef's will go down less than individual stocks. And
if we go down, I would then leverage back into individual value stocks as they
got to be better priced.

I guess this is my way of being defensive.

Thanks,

cw

FWIW, there was an article in the Chicago Tribune last week
http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/kfsm-news-nwa-taxes-turbo-tax-internet,0,570
110.story
indicating a strong trend away from traditional tax prep services in favor of
online preparation services. The gorilla in that space is TurboTax, which
showed a big bump in market share.

The article mentioned that tax prep at H&R Block was down 9% while Jackson
Hewitt was down 18% (confirming what you cite as Jackson Hewitt being in
disarray.)

My own experience with TurboTax the last 3 years is that it is pretty
impressive, the way you can download your 1099s from your online broker
directly to the program. Not too impressed with the live community responses to
unusual situations, but if you fork over a fee to talk with a tax expert, in my

welcome. i finally saw the 60 minutes piece and got to see what Mike looks

point of spending several hours listening to Geithner and Paulson defend their
bailout of AIG, or should I say Goldman Sucks via AIG and as far as i m
concerned they were not convincing at all except to say that the aig's
insurance subsidiaries were intertwined with the london branch that provided
the credit default insurance. The new york commisioner of insurance who audited
the insurance subsidiaries has gone on record many times stating that the
insurance subsidiaries were sound. Someone is either mistaken or not telling
the truth and I dont know understand why congress has not gotten to the bottom
of this. The amazing thing that i did not realize before seeing the 60 minutes
piece is that Goldman Sachs were instrumental in helping aig to set up the
insurance on default swap product and then purchased the product themselves.
How many conflicts of interest can there possibly be here? Its a joke, here the
governor of new york gets investigate for getting ticket to a world series
game. probably more attention is paid to that then the theft of $150 billion of
taxpayer money. Its scares me that anyone with Geithner's track record is

a joke frankly.

As usual the government is clueless and asleep at the wheel just like they were

run things like healthcare yet they don't even manage the responsibility that
they have today. They want to be able to wind down big banks if this happens

re 60min piece - i have not watched this one yet. While I agree that some of
things that happened around Sept 2008 were outrageous the things that have been
done are a fait accompli and there is not much we can do about it. What I am
worried about is the future - I think the financial regulation (derivatives)
has stalled and worst of all we are trying to reflate the balloon that has
popped to many time, using the central banks favorite helium (or probably more
fittingly hydrogen) zero percent interest rates.

Zero percent interest will punish low risk orientated savers and funnel savers
into all kind of assets. The value of those assets will inflate beyond
reasonable values and cause a gigantic misallocation of capital. it will not
only hurt those that buy these inflated assets, sooner or later it will hurt
everybody. So for example the inflated RE market hurt prudent savers who were
competing to bid on houses with folks without any income or anything too loose
with liars loans. Eventually the banking system blew up , causing the economy
to blow up which essentially hurt almost anybody but smart people like Mike
Burry.

Even the internet bubble, while less harmful, hurt many people that hat to
compete with people (at least in the Bay area here) with respect to housing and
other goods. By definition when the market cap of those inflated companies
get's large enough the stock become eligible for market cap weighted index
funds so almost anybody with 401k funds get's hurt when these stocks deflate.
So in my book it's a gigantic redistribution and misallocation of capital that
hurts the vast majority of people.

I see this cycle will get repeated and probably faster than we think. The US
central bank wields enormous power since it controls the major reserve currency
of the world and the interest rates for the US serve as an anchor for interest
rates in the rest of the world. For me saying that the interest rates stay at
zero as far as the eye can see (my interpretation of the the Fed's statement is
irresponsible, as it will cause new assets bubbles to pop up allover the world.
There is not much we can do about that.

What we can do and where the collective wisdom of this board could help is
spotting the bubble for what it is and finding a way to benefit from it blowing
up. This is what Mike Burry did, and we can do that too. This is what Mike's
Story taught me. End of my rant.

Nokia says wins China deals worth over $2 billion

Thursday, April 1, 2010; 9:19 AM

HELSINKI (Reuters) - The world's largest mobile phone maker Nokia <NOK1V.HE>
said on Thursday it had won handset deals with distributors in China worth over
$2 billion.

A spokesman said one agreement was with China PTAC, worth over $1 billion, and
the other was with Telling Telecommunication Holding Co. Ltd., also worth over
$1 billion.
===============================================================

Nokia continues to take advantage of their market share inking more deals in
China.

I still look at this company as a value opportunity w/ excellent growth
potential. The stock is trading with a PE of 12 and pays a 3.6% dividend. When
one compares this to an Apple or a RIMM, it provides good exposure to wireless
technology w/o paying too much.

Nokia also operates a division (w/ Siemens as a partner) to design and build
wireless networks in 3rd world countries (including China). This division is
marginally profitable (it's getting more profitable over time) but allows
Nokia's phone division to bundle their low end phone products w/ local
telecommunication service providers. As a result, Nokia has maintained their
35% market share worlwide.

Yes, they have their silicon crucible business that may recover somewhat with

Their other businesses are even more unproven. They purchased some semicon

RE: Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG)

Hi Paul -

The article you posted 09/11/2009 titled “The #1 Oil Play in the Country”
profiled NOG. This NG explorer & driller continues to make new highs. I tried
to buy around $10.50/share on the pullback in February 2010 but missed it. The
stock hit $17.00 today.

http://www.stockgumshoe.com/2009/09/the-1-oil-play-in-the-country.html

From the article you posted:"...This one is Northern Oil and Gas, a company
that was created to capitalize on the Bakken and that rode the fortunes of that
basin up and down over the last two years — spiking to $15 a share in 2008 and
collapsing to $2 earlier this year. The shares are right now slightly over $7,
but close enough. Market cap is now a bit over $250 million, but it’s certainly
still small relative to some players, and it’s in the early days of production
— the trailing PE is 106, but analysts expect their earnings to double this
year and jump a couple hundred percent more in 2010, to 45 cents a share (and
no, I have no idea what oil price they’re using to make that 45-cent guess …
the low estimate for 2010 is 24 cents, so there’s a wide range). Bloomberg
profiled the NOG guys (with a nice swashbuckler photo) back when the Bakken was
on the tip of every investor’s tongue in the Spring of 2008, so that’s an
interesting read if you want some of the background.

And that 120,000 shares that insiders have purchased over the past two years? I
wouldn’t put too much weight behind that, most of the insiders have been rabid
sellers whenever it got up to $10 a share or so, and they have definitely sold
— and been given — a lot more than they’ve bought.

And other than that, whatever you think about oil prices is probably something
close to what you think about the Bakken and these two “growth plays” —
Enerplus is a bit more nuanced, but NOG and BEXP are bets on high oil prices
and continued success with horizontal drilling and profitable production in the
Williston Basin … more prescient investors would have jumped in when they were
in financial turmoil back at the market bottom, but back then most of us
thought the world was coming to an end, so jumping on a Bakken wildcatter
wasn’t exactly at the front of our minds — the guys at the $12 Trillion Report
have been pushing these same companies in previous Bakken teases, and this
latest updated version has been circulating for a few weeks now … I never wrote
about them before, but I know a good number of my readers tried to ride the
Bakken wave, so perhaps they can share their wisdom (hopefully not too
hard-earned)...."

Vallejo Goes for Broke
Can bankruptcy save California’s cities from staggering pension obligations?
31 March 2010

As California cities and counties struggle to fulfill the generous pay and
pension commitments that they made to public employees during flush economic
times, some politicians have taken comfort in a usually forbidding word:
bankruptcy. Top officials in Los Angeles and San Diego have raised the B-word
in recent weeks, and almost everyone is paying attention to developments in
Vallejo (population 117,000), on the edge of the San Francisco Bay Area. The
blue-collar port city filed for bankruptcy in May 2008, after it couldn’t pay
its bills. Now, observers are watching to see whether Vallejo—the biggest
California city to file for bankruptcy so far—offers a road map out of the
mire.

Blame Vallejo’s politics, dominated by public-sector unions, for the city’s
sorry fiscal situation. “Police and firefighter salaries, pensions and overtime
accounted for 74 percent of Vallejo’s $80 million general budget, significantly
higher than the state average of 60 percent,” reported a 2009 Cato Institute
study. The study highlighted a shocking level of enrichment: pay and benefit
packages of more than $300,000 a year for police captains and average
firefighter compensation packages of $171,000 a year. Pensions are luxurious:
regular public employees can retire at age 55 with 81 percent of their final
year’s pay guaranteed, come hell or a stock-market crash. Police and fire
officials in Vallejo, as in much of California, can retire at age 50 with 90
percent of their final year’s pay guaranteed, including cost-of-living
adjustments for the rest of their lives and the lives of their spouses. And
that’s before taking advantage of the common pension-spiking schemes that
propel payouts even higher.

When a city spends so much taxpayer money on retirees, it doesn’t have much
left over for services that might actually benefit the public. That’s why
Vallejo has been slashing police services and has even warned residents to use
the 911 system judiciously. “Since 2005, the number of police officers has
dropped from 158 to 104,” a San Francisco Chronicle editorial about Vallejo
pointed out recently. “In 2008, Vallejo had a higher violent crime rate than
any other comparable city in California.” And it isn’t just public safety that
has suffered. A 2008 Chronicle article reported on a budget plan that “cuts
funding for the senior center, youth groups and arts organizations, to the
dismay of residents.” Citizens complain about an increasingly decrepit
downtown.

All this thrift could go only so far, however. Hence Vallejo’s bankruptcy,
which could theoretically remove the city’s crushing obligations to retired
employees. Unfortunately, it isn’t clear yet whether the pension promises will
actually wind up rescinded. Yes, a judge has ruled that “city labor contracts
can be overturned in bankruptcy,” reports Ed Mendell on his well-respected
CalPensions blog, but a “ ‘workout plan’ approved by the City Council in
December, described as an opening position in labor negotiations, cuts nearly
all general fund spending, except for employee pensions.” Though the city
eventually voted to reduce firefighter pensions for new hires and to require a
larger pension contribution by firefighters, it did not touch existing pensions
or pensions for police officers. Vallejo’s avoidance of the pension issue makes
it less likely that other cities could declare bankruptcy and then easily
dispose of their burdensome pension promises.

That’s unfortunate, because plenty of California cities are in similar straits.
For years, local elected officials in Vallejo and throughout the state (and the
nation, for that matter) have rapidly fattened pension benefits for public
employees, worrying more about the next election cycle than about the ability
of their municipalities to make good on all the lush promises. Once these
contracts are approved, they become binding and must be fulfilled on the backs
of current and future taxpayers.

True, the Orange County Board of Supervisors, which granted massive pension
increases twice in the past decade, is making an unusual legal attempt to
reduce its pension obligations: it’s pursuing a lawsuit claiming that the
retroactive portion of one increase was an unconstitutional gift of public
funds. That’s a worthy effort but a long shot. Most California jurisdictions
think that bankruptcy is a more feasible alternative if salary and pension
costs push them toward insolvency.

The Chronicle editorial, taking Vallejo to task for entering bankruptcy,
prescribes two alternatives: more “help” from Sacramento (a nonstarter, given
the state’s nearly $21 billion budget deficit) and higher local taxes. That’s
certainly what California’s muscular public-sector unions would like to see.
They backed legislation that would make it nearly impossible for localities to
abrogate their labor contracts in a bankruptcy. Now they’re advocating
tax-raising plans and railing against the two-thirds vote requirement to pass
budgets and tax increases in the California State Legislature.

Cities across the nation should pay close attention to Vallejo’s workout plan.
If bankruptcy isn’t a fix for past profligate spending on public employees,
then more debt and higher taxes may be inevitable—a sobering thought in an
already-struggling economy.

Steven Greenhut is the director of the Pacific Research Institute’s Journalism
Center in Sacramento and the author of Plunder! How Public Employee Unions Are
Raiding Treasuries, Controlling Our Lives And Bankrupting The Nation.

As I read this is it doenst seem like anyone has the political will to do the
right thing and cut these ridiculous retirement obligations. Unless the
government bail out the state of california which in turn bails out these
municipalities, i guess the banks or maybe the fed will continue to be very
large homeowner in california. Looks like California has nothing on Greece.

RE: Citigroup, Inc. (C) - Is this the sign of a bank in recovery mode?

I maintain a Citi Bank Savings account that I use for ATM access and to deposit
paper checks that I receive (mainly from non-electronic rebate programs). I
keep the minimum amount required on deposit (I think it is $500.00) and fund
the account from time to time via Schwab electronic ACH deposits. It's nice to
have access to cash through their wide ATM network.

Upon entering my local branch today for a cash withdrawal, I see this sign
posted on all the teller counters.

"Deposits in checking, savings, money market and certificate of deposit
accounts at FDIC-insured institutions are insured up to $250,000 per depositor
through December 31, 2013. On January 1, 2014, the standard insurance amount
will return to $100,000 per depositor for all account categories except for
IRAs and other certain retirement accounts which will remain at $250,000 per
depositor.

<u>Note: Beginning January 1, 2010, Citibank will no longer participate in the
FDIC's Transaction Account Guarantee Program. Thus, funds held in
noninterest-bearing transaction accounts (non-interest and interest-bearing
checking accounts) will no longer be guaranteed in full under the Transaction
Account Guarantee Program, but will be insured up to $250,000 under the FDIC's
general deposit insurance rules.</u>"

I am not too sure what the "Transaction Guarantee Program" is but to not have
it any more as of January 1, 2010 does not provide much assurance to me than
Citigroup has fully recovered and is a stronger bank now than it was 18 month's
ago.

I suspect they stopped providing this coverage since it cost them more to
provide it through the FDIC. It may have been overlapped coverage but as an
investor it is less coverage now than before.

I am not sure if the other major banks have the same new policy or if this is
specific to Citigroup. This is just another reason I plan to stay away from C
as an investment.

"FDIC announced its temporary Transaction Account Guarantee Program, which

transaction account guarantee applies to all personal and business checking
deposit accounts that do not earn interest at participating institutions. This
unlimited insurance coverage is temporary and will remain in effect for

it was a temporary program to calm markets by the fdic. The program ended Dec
31st 2009. So yes I do view it as a recovery sign for banks. If they still
needed it the FDIC would have kept it in effect.

EDIT

looks like it was extended for banks that need it until June 20th 2010.

* Any insured depository institution that is currently participating in the TAG
program may continue in the program during the extension period that ends on
June 30, 2010.
* The annual assessment rate that will apply to participating institutions
during the extension period will be either 15 basis points, 20 basis points or
25 basis points, depending on the Risk Category assigned to the institution
under the FDIC's risk-based premium system.
* Any institution currently participating in the TAG program that wishes to opt
out of the TAG extension must submit its opt-out election to the FDIC on or
before November 2, 2009. See page 2 for instructions on how to opt out.
* Any such election to opt out will be effective on January 1, 2010.
* Every institution currently participating in the TAG program should review
its disclosures and modify them as necessary to ensure that they will be
accurate after December 31, 2009.
* The maximum interest rate limit for NOW accounts remains unchanged.

So yes I still view this as a very positive thing for C. They don't need it and
so have elected not to provide it. It is going away for all banks it looks like
June 30th.

Hi blastedwand -

Thanks for the clarification. When I asked the teller they had no clue what the
sign was all about.

My credit union has their insurance with the National Credit Union Association
(NCUA), a federal agency which administers the National Credit Union Share
Insurance Fund (NCUSIF. They never had a TAG Program.

My credit union provides an updated page on their web site showing their
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, links to their annual reports and independent
Star Ratings provided by Bauerfinancial Inc. (
http://www.starone.org/home/about/financial ). Credit Unions are local,
generally lend locally and are not very big (but well capitalized) and easy to
understand.

I can understand their balance sheet and financials.

I tried to go through the 10K for Citigroup. It was just too hard for me to
understand, the numbers were huge and it was not clear to me where all the
different "risks' were. I suspect the average investor does not understand
their balance sheet either. It's hard to value something you don't understand.

At some point a company gets too big to manage effectively (ie ENRON). Remember
when ENRON was referred to as having "Black Box accounting" since the analysts
could not follow the cash flows from all their different operations? I would
like to see all of the huge Mega Banks broken up into operating geographical
pieces. Perhaps we need to look at the credit union model and maybe even have
industry overview similar to how local (regional) utilities are regulated.

If we eventually get some type of new bank regulation, it must address many of
the non-banking activities (derivatives, trading, investment banking etc.). If
we don't we will probably experience another melt down. I doubt if Congress has
the fortitude to pass anything substantial.

Thanks again for the FDIC TAGP clarification. It should have never been
necessary in the first place if things were better regulated.

Star One is a good credit union - 4* rated. Their Saving account rate used to

Not all CU are financially that strong - some of my local CU are 2* rated
(Redwood CU, Addison Ave). I am located in the North Bay and the local banks
are suffering too - the largest ones are 2* rated only.

I agree that FDIC insured banks should be regulated more and their banking
business should be completely separated from other activities (capital markets

or even better with no ties whatsoever.

I agree that end of the TAG program is a sign of normalization.

Thanks for pointing that article out. I agree that there is a trend away from

I hesitate to call it a strong trend. It might seem strong at the moment mainly
because people are trying to save money, but I think once employment starts to

there will continue to be a slow gradual shift from using a tax preparer to
doing it yourself.

For me, HRB is a very safe bet on a company with a history of outstanding
margins. I see little to no downside and the chances for a very good return on
your investment is very large. HRB is also a bet that the managers will be able
to turn around the business and make it even more profitable. Plus there is the

Saw the author on bloomberg last night. He was very enlightening and an

whatever reason ignored it. ( not surprising since they have ignored everything
else of note for a decade. Now that I know more about Geithner and Blair Im not
at all surprised. As soon as the author realized the regulators were clueless
he lost interest in that side of the story. B. The rating agency people were
either out of their league or so incentivized that they were desperate to look
the other way and place total reliance on a poor model. C. The CEOs didnt
understand the product except that it made a lot of money. D. The people within
organizations who recognized this would be a problem down the road and voiced
warnings were drowned out by the more powerful people making tons of money
selling the product. E. what exactly happened at aig that they allowed Goldman
SUcks to persuade them to put on a risky product sell $60 billion worth of
insurance that eventually would wipe out shareholders was not clear from his
discussion.

He mentioned that he was asked to speak at a book club of Republican
Congressmen and as they listened and he explained he could practically see

Imo, the stock's for capital gain more than dividend and is okay for someone
willing to hold for a couple years expecting that stock price might move up
with continued earnings and consequently, further growth in book value.

Insurance accounting to me is very arcane, and not well understood (by me).
Each subsector - health, property & casualty, specialty, reinsurance -- also
has its own business issues and sometimes special accounting aspects. In
summary though, many insurance managements rate themselves by growth in book
value of their company and by their loss ratios.
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_ratio), and that's what I like to use as
well. (Intricacies of accounting here being too tough for me).

Walter Bagehot. Yes, read. I'm following that thread.

Good points you've made.

The shipping sector is a dangerous place to place money.

Some companies seem to have long-term charters (time-charters vs. having lots
of ships on the spot-market), and that for me ameliorates some concerns. I like
SBLK and esp. NM for that, esp. as NM have gov't insurance for some of their
contracts (if the contracting party should default on payment to NM. Which is a
distinct possibility if trade craters.)

I'm willing to hold ULTR for its barge business in Brazil. I've been buying
TOO, and may buy more. It has ships that store/move oil from offshore to ports
(where drill rigs are too far offshore for there to be pipelines to shore.) The
good TOO distribution may help me to hold on to this stock. I like off-shore,
and for shipping I also have HOS. (For other off-shore transport, I like couple
of helicopter companies.)

Have several others. Very small positions. In general though, will agree with
you: tankers/dry bulk/commodity --- a dangerous area for the small
investor/speculator: One fights overbuilding, raw material costs affecting
buyers/sellers and therefore how much is being shipped, and the ship owner
insiders who are mostly and closer to almost-all (it seems) not aligned with
shareholders.

Rather, he believes H&R Block has been hurt by the weak economy because more

28.) As the economy recovers, people will start filing again. Taking splits

Vallejo is just the beginning instance of California state and city problems.

Unions give to politicians. Cannot get elected, especially at local level,
unless you back unions. So union members get absurd pay and benefits. And those
are locked in even now. If there are cuts to the budget, it goes to number of
employees, not to pay scale. And the amount of unfunded pension liabilities is
scary. There is no way the state and cities will ever be able to pay what has
been promised, unless the marginal tax rates are increased greatly, and at some
point that does not work.

Some years back (before the recession) the City of Oakland needed to hire four
firefighters. The day of application they closed down after taking something
like 5,000 applications, figuring that was enough. So they got sued by those
who did not get their applications processed. In this absurdity no one bothered
to ask why firefighters are paid so well that they get over 1,000 applications
per opening.

When Vallejo went bankrupt, the unions tried to stop the bankruptcy. They
argued that Vallejo could keep it going. they figured the city could tax more,
cut spending other than payroll. Bankruptcy court would not go for it. Shows
the union thinking.

Now unions are trying to pass a law that Cities cannot file bk without approval
of some board. No doubt a board loaded with union sympathizers.

Public service unions will ruin the state, same as unions ruined the airlines
and ruined the automakers. Unions figure that costs can be pushed on to the
consumer (or taxpayer). And that is true for awhile, even decades, but at some
point there must be a major adjustment. Right now states cannot go bankrupt,
but I suspect that within 10 years that law will be changed.

They were slow to book expected losses on mortgages; they took 2 years to raise
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts to 10.23% from 0.25%. At 20.23%, delinquency is
16 points higher than in 2007. Significant potential exists to sink the firm
with losses here on the 700M+ portfolio of mortgages.

Litigation settlement on RAL cost 70M+ in 2006 and pending litigation on POM

A piece from a Barrons Article this week -

Well-respected value investor Bill Nygren thinks stocks are still cheap. Two
favorites: Liberty Media and H&R Block

Another of Nygren's misunderstood stocks is H&R Block (HRB). Wall Street thinks
its tax outlets have lost customers to TurboTax, but the people who use the
online system never went to professional preparers in the first place, he
asserts.
Rather, he believes H&R Block has been hurt by the weak economy because more
people either don't file -- because their income is too low -- or because they
can't pay the taxes. (H&R estimates IRS filings are down about 5% through Feb.
28.) As the economy recovers, people will start filing again. Taking splits
into account, his cost basis is about 10. The stock trades at 17.80. Analysts
estimate 2010 earnings at $1.42 and 2011 at $1.59.

Hi Paul -
Playing on your earlier theme for Bakken shale, this article points out a few
local business that are benefiting from the boom in NG exploration.

Natural gas boom brings riches to a rural town 
http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6341Y420100405
From the article:"...The freight railroad, which runs 35 miles north to
Corning, New York, had its busiest year in more than two decades in 2009,
fueled by demand from a booming natural gas industry, which uses sand in
hydraulic fracturing operations.

Revenue doubled last year for Wellsboro & Corning Railroad, owned by Tom Myles
and sons Tom Jr. and Bill, and the sand-hauling contracts that began a year ago
are due to double revenue again in 2010 and make up 80 percent of business...."

There have to be several other "value" investments yet undiscovered. It looks
like the Myles brothers were able to pick up the Wellsboro & Corning railroad
at a big discount. ( http://www.wellsboroandcorningrailroad.com/ )

Too bad that the Myles group LLC is privately held:
http://www.mylesgroup.net/index.html

Citizens & Northern Corp. (CZNC) was also mentioned in the article and could
benefit from the Marcellus Shale drilling boom.
http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=CZNC

Local lands values are now worth more with new drilling leases. I wonder if
much of this new revenue will flow back through the local bank? At 6x next
year's earnings it still seems cheap. All operating divisions would benefit
from the in flow of monies from the new NG leases especially their trust and
financial management services department.

The CEO has been buying a lot of stock around current levels too.

Airline: To be expected that with oil up, airline stocks might stall or drop.

I closed out my AMR position today. Added back though -- very late to this
flight -- just a little more ALK. With Alaska Air, I am following analysts who
suggest that IF Delta is one of the USA carriers that gets flight approval from
Seattle to Japan, IF Japan finally opens its market to foreign airline (only
because Japanese airlines need foreign assistance), then
ALK May be be a beneficiary as a feeder to Seattle of business people and other
travelers who're heading for Japan/Asia.

Sin Stocks. Upped my very few shares of tobacco company PM and added to money

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PM,WRLD&d=s

PM's one of the stocks I just have tucked away. Its business rolls on, I have a
few shares, the dividends drop in my account. Doesn't require any close watch.
Drawback is that stock price has increased gradually enough that I've not paid
attention. At this point, if I'm going to keep shares, I figure I might just as
well have a bit more. More anyway than the very few I'm holding.

Paul- have you taken a look before at CCLTF (and its warrant CCLWF). The stock
is extremely thin but shares are trading at a very low single digit P/E with
relatively solid growth. The big drawbacks are the illiquidity of the common-
CCLTF and the fact that the company's shares are not publicized at all.

Paul, if you are interested in airlines, I suggest checking outing Ryanair
(RYAAY) if you haven't already. They are the world's largest carrier of
international traffic and have the lowest fares in all of Europe. They are
relentless cost cutters and always seeking to get more efficient in their
business, but not at the expense of safety. They really have no competition in
Europe and not a week has gone by since the beginning of the year where there
was not a news story about a competing airline either going bankrupt and
liquidating or employees going on a strike. All good news for Ryanair and they
just recently upped their guidance which gave the stock a 10% boost. If the
price pulls back, I might look into buying some more.

strange day for me. market is down but most of my stuff is up with the
exception of berkshire hathaway. slw at new recent high. at the moment looks
like my buying of the dips has worked out nicely. getting a little action on a
couple of small semiconductor names i own zarlf and ikan. Dont really know know
much about them. thought I was following smart money into them. still waiting
on release of numbers on mfcaf. As I seem to be owning more and more different
securities I am going to need to learn how to keep track of more names. going
on a small vacation for a few days to florida. might check on a real estate
company out there, if my friend is so inclined. OT very freaky happening, on
Sunday afternoon I saw a satirical big puppet show by a Vermont troupe "bread
and puppet theater".. they were very entertaining did a show about the economy
and bigwigs profiting at the expense of the working class. they did a little
skit showing coal-miners losing their heads while suits collected gobs of
money. the suits had flags labeled Massey attached to them. Then on Monday I
hear about this coal mining disaster involving Massey.

RYR are a nice business, but far from Graham-based value in my view:

- Multiple is too high
- On too many people's radar
- Huge competition in Europe (it is not not existent as your characterise -
there are businesses such as Wizzair, airBerlin, easyJet (to some extent),
transavia, jet2, flyBE etc among many others who compete in the European
market)
- Airlines make losses and have done so repeatedly over history
- The brands are absolutely not enduring - easyJet was non-existent at London
Gatwick 9 years ago, and is now its largest operator. The same could happen to
Ryanair and easyJet in a blink. This is a busy airfield that has been the
busiest single runway in the world for many years, and yet easyJet has made
"easy" inroads.
- Ryanair made a great deal of money from asset trading rather than operating -
a huge Boeing order that was flipped in peak demand years to keep their fleet
young and make asset gains. Airbus now refuse to deal with them, and Boeing are
hardly going to make the same mistake again of permitting them such large
discounts on a mass order that dilutes their control of the market
- Personality - I simply don't want to do business with a man like Michael
O'Leary, the way he presents himself and the way he is perceived. He is a good
manager, but I would check for my wallet after leaving the room.

Outlook for 2010
Lithia reaffirms its 2010 earnings guidance as provided on February 3, 2010.
First quarter earnings guidance is projected within a range of $0.04 to $0.06
per diluted share. Full year 2010 earnings guidance is projected within a range
of $0.55 to $0.63 per diluted share. This guidance includes approximately 18%
additional dilution related to the equity offering completed in October 2009.
Specific reference is made to the February 3, 2010 release for assumptions upon
which this guidance was given.

Looks like 2010 is .63(top estimate) cents a share vs the .74 you quoted. In
addition, they missed guidance the last two quarters so i am not sure how solid
the guidance is to begin with. Even if you take them at their word of .63 cents
it seems to be fully valued to me on the surface of the numbers. Obviously I
know little or nothing about the company so if they have aggressive growth
targets or something along those lines maybe it is worth it.

Not that this is not a good investment because maybe it is and I would see that
if I dug deeper but I do not see the "value" play. Maybe it is a growth play
after all?

LAD. A reversion-to-mean opportunity with a company in a sector that seems to
be viable. I'm not very much depending on 2010 estimates indicating overvalue.

Cars are going to be bought. Somebody's going to be selling new and used cars,
and fixing and repairing them. As complexity of vehicles increases, dealers may
increase their advantage over independents.

As new auto sales numbers improve from recent past annual lows, I'll bet LAD
once again sells closer to its stated book value (p/bk now is .58, per Yahoo),
and at a higher p/sales ratio than its current relatively low .10.

What's hurt these auto retailer stocks -- other than the complete fall-off of
customers for new/used cars in the this economic recession, is, imo, the fear
that the debt levels of the publicly-traded retailers could not be sustained or
refinanced. That seems not to be true now. However, the debt levels ARE high --
last time I looked d/e ratios are maybe 2:1 for all the publicly traded auto
retailer stocks. Rightly or wrongly, that just seems how they all operate. At
least they don't have high capital expense or fixed high salaries as do the
auto manufacturers.

I also like the auto retailers because they sell brands from diverse
manufacturers, and their stores are regional (LAD) or national. My preference
also is to buy a package of these stocks.

As I've mentioned before, I have three now --- LAD, GPI, and PAG. I also like
other aspects of the automobile sector and hold stocks therein (not suggesting
these are value buys now) -- subprime auto loan or or just plain loan
companies, nat. fuel conversion companies, Chinese diesel company, truck
manufactures. Currently I'm looking at lithium miners to see if any are
attractive for me for what I perceive to be a surge in hybrid vehicles because
of the new USA mileage requirements in 2016. (Lithium stock buys would almost
assuredly be a speculative bet for me, not a value play.)

Based on the last report, it seems that if Chrysler were to get their house in
order, it could have decent upside potential for LAD. Im inclined to think in a
recovering economy, something could actually go right for vehicle sales.

"Lithia's Chairman and CEO, commented, "Our fourth quarter results were
impacted by weak new vehicle sales at our Chrysler stores. This was caused by
the delay in the release of new products, like the 2010 Ram heavy duty pickup,
and lower advertising and incentive spending by Chrysler which slowed floor
traffic. In response, we focused on increasing used vehicle sales at the
affected locations. We also improved new vehicle sales of our other brands.
Excluding Chrysler, we had approximately 18.5% new vehicle same store sales
growth over the fourth quarter of 2008. On an adjusted basis, we were
profitable in the fourth quarter, despite significant headwinds."

DinoNavarre, welcome to the thread. I'd say FLY might work out okay over the
next year or so. I hope so, I have a few shares.

Some aspects concern me, and why I'll keep my position small. First, there's
not a lot of public history to the company (stock) -- about three year's.
Secondly, although current trailing p/e is about 4, the two analysts (at Yahoo)
have forward p/e much higher, maybe to be 12/.8 = 15x. I know the aircraft
leasing business has been profitable for the big players who have access to
cheap money (e.g. GE). I assume Babcock and Brown has that too. Not that
analysts are to be depended on to be correct, it's just that I don't understand
why they believe the earnings will falter.

Just looked into the business a little more:

- Revenues are not unstable, but management seem to have kept on good staff to
take advantage of upturn, hence poor earnings in most recent period, and
potential for large pop in earnings when it rebounds
- Products seem to be more focussed on audio markets, which require greater
expertise than a bog-standard plastic-injection business - they mention Peavey
and others as clients that they continue to diversify
- Cash growth is great, and involvement of founders and management over a long
period is positive
- No news will come out of the business until June given earnings schedules
- P/E is around 4 or 5 based upon last three years (as Graham advocates),
rather than the inflated figure that a straight look at the past year appears
to be

I have just gone into the stock
