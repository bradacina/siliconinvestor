I don't know whom they invited or didn't to speak at graduation however they
are a Catholic Institution and in that respect are controlled by you know whom
so I doubt that they are very mendacious or subversive if that is your
thrust...

OTOH I just thought it an interesting assessment...

boston college and catholism imo has nothing to do with each other. same as one

graduating from bc i would be upset that a group of people would ruin or use my
graduation a political game. the sources i used were articles in boston globe,

Hi Madharry - It's not that hard but the difficult part is when to sell the
losers and move on to the new value propositions. The other challenge is to
learn to take profits especially on the multi-baggers. My typical holding
period is 18-36 months as this provides enough time for an out of favor value
stock to turn around.

Finally, I do have a set of core stocks (and index funds) which do not need too
much attention.

Hi there E_K_S. Firstly thanx for that extensive reply. For a personal
investor, you certainly appear to have a very expansive stock management system
!

To reply to your questions and comments, let me begin by briefly outlining my
stock selection and investment criteria, originally formulated by my good
friend and mentor, Dr. Karl Posel Ph.D. D.Sc.(Eng.)., who regards himself as a
Mathematical Investment Consultant, incorporating an in-depth understanding of
Financial Statements, over 30 years experience in stock market investing,
combined with his academic proficiency in mathematics.
A good example of this combined approach is to regard the Balance Sheet as a
mathematical equation. In this way one can see the relevance and reliance of
its various components with one another.

At the risk of repeating myself, because I have referred to the following in
previous messages on the SI Board, here’s how I approach Stock selection :-

1)STEP 1 : Using freely available, web-based screening facilities, I use
screen(s) based on about 8 or 9 fundamental criteria obtained from within a
company’s Income Statement and Balance Sheet. These criteria, and other "Laws",
are combined into financial ratios with pre-set percentage targets. Approx.
10000 US Industrial company’s can be screened in a few seconds and generally
produce a list of 30 to 50 companies. Needless to say, the web-based facilities
don’t always contain the exact criteria one is looking for, however they are
close enough. Further, minor selection may still be required. After some
further "pruning" we only take forward those companies that MEET or EXCEED ALL
of the criteria, SIMULTANEOUSLY. Any company that defaults on any of them is
discarded.

2)STEP 2 : From this shorter list we determine which of those companies are
undervalued, based, primarily, on studying their P/E ratios, plus one or two
other criteria. Those that are, in our opinion, currently Overvalued are put
onto a watch list for the future.

3)STEP 3 : From this even shorter list we do some "extrapolating" based on
several components of the Income Statement. We look forward a maximum of 6
months in order to reasonably conclude which of these short-listed companies
show the greatest potential for price increase. Those are the ones we would
invest in.

4)STEP 4 : Once we have purchased these stocks, we don’t regard ourselves as
"married" to them. There is an ongoing process of monitoring their performance
via their most recently published Financial Statements and any other pertinent
announcements, such as profit warnings etc.. It is these Fundamental
considerations which determines whether or not we hold or sell, and not rumour
or speculation.
As long as a stock continues to meet our criteria, or nothing better appears,
we will hold it. We don't do any " annual spring cleaning" just for the sake of
it.
One has to eventually learn to have the "courage of one’s Fundamental
convictions"!

Now the way I read your reply, you expressed two concerns.
FIRSTLY, you asked about the "risk" related to a portfolio of so few stocks.
My answer to that would be "what risk" ? Because if a stock is satisfying ALL
the Fundamental criteria, SIMULTANEOUSLY, that are a reflection of a QUALITY
company, producing ongoing profits and value for shareholders, then is there a
major risk involved ?
Any "laggard" company could NOT, SIMULTANEOUSLY, meet or exceed these criteria.

The problem, I believe, lies in the criteria that many folk use, in the first
place, to search for, and choose their stocks, viz. P/S, P/BK and P/CF etc..
Because of that very reason, I attempted to raise debate on this forum with
regard to the nature and content of these ratios. However, I didn’t meet with
much of an enthusiastic response. In fact, at times, it was mildly abusive !

Personally, I cannot see the relevance in a P/S ratio, where one is using the
first line of a company’s Income Statement as the denominator. Surely what is
of far more Fundamental importance in a company’s performance is what happens
AFTER the first line in the Income Statement.

It goes without saying, that whatever you put into a mathematical equation or
ratio, is what you get out of it.
This is why we advocate the use of P/E, AFTER deducting any Extra-ordinary
Items, because these are generally not related to the ongoing business of that
company. In so doing, the denominator now becomes a meaningful number, which
reflects all that occurred within that company’s last 12 month’s operating
period.

Much the same can be said about the relevance of P/BK. In most Market sectors
the Book entry into a Balance Sheet is an HISTORICAL number. Once entered it
stays like that. Therefore it’s often the case that it’s current value may have
little to do with its past value. So how can one be sure that a company is
currently selling at a "premium" to Book Value ? It may very well be the other
way around, especially if that once prime property is now a swamp after a
catastrophic hurricane !
And also, why would it be that relevant if a QUALITY company’s apparent
liquidated value per share is higher than its current price ? Because, surely,
to realise that value the company would have to be liquidated, and how likely
is it that a really QUALITY company would be liquidated in the near future ?!

Another tool of company analysis that we believe is overrated is Discounted
Cash Flow, primarily for mathematical reasons. As we know, DCF relies quite
extensively on inserting future interest rates into its formulae in order to
determine present value from likely future performance.
Now we believe it’s difficult enough to look 1 year down the track and conclude
what interest rates are likely, or not likely, to be. In DCF it’s often the
case that rate predictions are made for several years hence. These figures are
put into the relevant equations, a "handle is turned" and out comes an answer
which folk accept as Gospel ! Like I said before, in mathematics, what you put
in is what you get out.

Anyway, it’s up to the individual to choose his/her own methods of analysis.

The SECOND concern you expressed was related to getting a dividend income from
one’s stock portfolio. This, I believe, depends on whether the individual is
investing for Capital Gain, Dividend Income or a bit of both.
In the case of HANS, for example, I have invested for Capital Gain due to the
performance of the company. As it happens, HANS does not pay a dividend. Nor,
for that matter, does Mr. Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, whose stock
price is in the tens of thousands of dollars !
If one wants a QUALITY company that pays a dividend one can include that
requirement in the stock screens I previously mentioned, and go through the
same process.

The fact that one may only have 5 or 8 QUALITY, dividend-paying companies in
one’s portfolio shouldn’t be a problem. After all, if you have $1mil. to invest
in 50 companies or in 5 companies, you will receive the equivalent of 1/50
compared to 1/5 of the overall dividend from each company, all things being
equal. However, based on your own contention, there’s likely to be a certain
percentage of "duds" in 50 companies, which will reduce your overall dividend
payment. I wonder how many of the 5 QUALITY companies won’t continue to pay a
dividend ?!

We have also believed that an individual investor, armed with the know-how to
read, understand and adequately analyse a company’s Financial Statements, will
do a lot better for themselves than entrusting their money to Fund/Portfolio
Managers. One of the hurdles that Managers have is in which stocks to allocate
many millions of dollars based on the fact that they need adequate traded
volume. Quite often they have to target Large Cap stocks to do that, and these
stocks may not be the best performers.
In addition, if there’s a large holding in a poorly performing stock, a Manager
can’t just exit with many millions of dollars worth of stock without further
worsening the situation.
An individual investor does not, necessarily have that "traded volume" problem
He/she can still make a very good return from a stock with a lot less traded
volume. He/she can also exit the stock "without causing a ripple".

And finally, we are not too concerned about basing our investment decisions on
Sectors. An exception to this rule can be with regard to Resource based stocks
whose performances are very much determined by the price of their Resource and,
as such, is out of the company’s control. We have found very profitable
companies in Sectors that "Analysts", and the like, are discouraging investors
to enter into.

At the end of the day, it’s the Quality of a company’s Financial Fundamentals
that will determine its stock price over the medium to longer term, not the
opinions of "Analysts" and market commentators.

From:E_K_S
I have monitored your postings and do find your financial analysis quite
interesting. There are some things that just can not be uncovered with any type
of mathematical screen or even extensive due diligence that can lead to a
company to lose significant value over night (i.e. specific stock risk). Many
of these items have been mentioned in this forum like unfunded employee pension
and medical liabilities, possible litigation issues (environmental, product
liability etc.) or even management fraud.

The value investor must evaluate these potential liabilities when considering
the overall value proposition. It's a simple risk reward analysis.

Therefore, there is still the potential of (unexpected) stock specific risk
using your very methodical screening system. The best examples I can provide in
the last few years where I both benefited and got stung are with HAL
(Halliburton) and MRK (Merck).

Both companies had unexpected potential bankrupting law suits. Halliburton with
asbestos and MERCK with their controversial drug Vioxx.

I purchased a starter position in HAL at $9.00/share a few years back when
their asbestos law suit was announced. If I had owned the stock a few days
earlier at $45.00, I would have lost over 80% of my investment. I jumped into
the stock as it was a very compelling value proposition. The stock did recover
and I still own a few shares from my original starter position now trading
around $75.00.

However with Merck, when their Vioxx trouble started in 2004, the stock
cratered from $45 to the low $20's in just a few days. I had a core position in
the company (around 7% of the portfolio) at a good entry point around $37 but
lost it all and more when the stock tumbled to the low $20's. I did exit the
position around $28 and after about 12 months began a new starter position
around $24.00 but at a much less percentage of the portfolio (around 2%). Here
again there was unexpected litigation that over night cut the value of the
stock in half.

Therefore, there is stock specific risk always in the market and the only way I
have found out to minimize it is to stay with a diversified portfolio and limit
any one position in the portfolio to less than 10% of the total assets.

You do give up a portion of your potential portfolio's total return by limiting
your exposure to a smaller position in any one security but I have found that
it is worth it especially if you have modest long term growth requirements. I
am satisfied if I can achieve a long term growth rate of 10% per year. Anything
over that is gravy.

Needless to say, E_K_S, what I have presented in my previous Message is not the
full list of stock selection criteria. What I tried to emphasise were those
aspects related to a company’s stock screening criteria related to their
Financials.
Dr. Posel’s original criteria consisted of 9 major items, or "Laws" , as he
referred to them, which needed to be considered and investigated. These have
since increased to 12. The majority of these items consist of critical
financial ratios, while others are more general considerations.

One of those states that an investor should "Have some knowledge of the company
concerned. Satisfy yourself about its history, track record and actual modus
operandi."
That may sound like a fairly obvious observation, but it’s meant to direct
one’s attention to a more thorough and in-depth analysis of what one is buying,
especially with regard to who is managing the company, and any other aspects
that may impinge on future profitability.

I’m sure you’ll agree that for a company to have had a fairly consistent, and
well established record of profitability, achieved against competition and
possibly against sometimes adverse market conditions, it very likely has a very
competent Management team, of some integrity as well. You can't, generally,
achieve well above average returns in a company if its Management doesn't have
a thorough grasp of ALL that is required to achieve such positive returns. In
our experience we have never encountered mismanagement or any form of financial
"scandal" originating from a well managed, Quality company. Of course, that’s
our experience. Others may disagree.
However, as I mentioned in my previous message, constant vigilance regarding a
company’s state of affairs is always required, especially around the time that
results are due.

I’m afraid I couldn’t go along with your long term growth rate of only 10% in
the stock market. I, personally, have never achieved less than 45% per annum
from a selection of between 5 to 8 stocks in the USA or South African stock
market.
In fact, investing in only 3 stocks in the South African market in the past
year, we achieved an average of over 120% in DAW, DGC and WBO, and much the
same in the previous year. I have kept a public record on these stocks on
another financial channel, so if you’re interested, drop me a line and I’ll
give you "directions".
All I can say is that we must be "swimming in gravy" !!!

I'm saying that using the stock selection and analysis criteria I have referred
to, I, and others who have used these principles, have been able to achieve
returns of at least 30% per annum.

My good friend, Dr.Posel, has managed 3 to 6 company stock portfolios for
retired businessmen back here in South Africa for many years. He has
consistently managed returns of +/- 40% per annum.

If you see that as a generally unattainable objective then maybe you need to
re-assess your modus operandi.

Just wondering what I would do if I were making 40% a year consistently on my
investments, and didn't feel any risk in doing it, and believed I could
continue this way for the foreseeable future.

I'd margin to the hilt. What's 6.5% interest if I'm comfortable that I could do
30-40% every year? Yes! That'd take me up to 60-80% every year. Yippee!!

I wonder if I'd sell my house and put the money into the few stocks that are so
superior investments? Not sure what housing appreciation might be going
forward, but it isn't going to be 30% each year. Take my house sales proceeds
and invest it in stocks and just live in an apartment. Or maybe, otoh I should
step up, trade up, and buy the best house I can afford - get my dream house -
with lowest down payment. What do I care what I have to pay in mortgage
interest (and principal) if I can do at least 40% on my stocks. That'll more
than cover the monthly nut.

Fighting new car fever. I'd have even more trouble figuring if I should get a
new car or pass on it. First of all, like any adult (person with assets)who
can't write off the car expense, I'd normally pay cash, but that'd be giving up
30-40% stock gains for a depreciating asset (the car). So I guess I'd want to
get the biggest loan I could to keep as much money as possible in those great
stocks. OTOH, I've still got to pay the bill: A $60-100k car still has to be
paid off. If I do nothing and don't buy a car now, but instead invest the
money, that money doubles in 2-3 years - giving me a chance to by a little
Ferrari at that point (and the same conundrum 2-3 years hence). OTOH, that '07
XK Jag coupe I like now for $75K that will depreciate so so fast... what should
I care, I could buy it now, and I'll be making up the ownership costs up with
30-40% gains from the stocks I own.

Ah charity. I'd now be in a position in which I've been critical of Mr.
Buffett: Namely in past, he seems like he's given nothing to charity. One
argument for him is that maybe he shouldn't be giving money to charity: he can
make 20% on his money, so he can really cum up his assets and then when he
stops and does do something, the pile will be so big that it will benefit more
people than if he just gave money along the line. So I'd guess I'd stop making
any charitable deductions (unless my tax advisors or wife said otherwise.)

Ah, perhaps a personality change for me. Normally I don't care what other
people do, and I don't go to any trouble to convince them to do something (buy
or sell a stock). But... - based on what I see or believe I see - not that many
people claim these sorts of stock market gains, so maybe it's best if I
capitalize on these 30-40% or more gains while the capitalizing is good --- and
just start a newsletter or money management firm or hedge fund. That'd multiply
my incoming funds and the profits I get from the stocks I buy/manage for
others. With not much risk to me. Yes!
But it does seem like work. Setting up, selling, dealing with nay sayers.

Gee. A lifestyle change, a personality change. Maybe more work. STILL being
concerned about whether or not to buy "stuff". Somehow making 30-40% on my
money every year with no risk almost doesn't seem worth it to me. -ggg-

the problem with leverage is that markets are inherently chaotic and one can be
leveraged have a good run for several years and then lose it all before the
market gives you time to recover.
to take an extreme example the price of silver in a matter of days dropped from
$14 to below $10 wiping out who knows how many speculators. Or take a look at
the sudden decline in emerging markets. Im sure these areas will come back but
that will be of no solace to leveraged speculators who have been wiped out. In
my own case SIL dropped from over $24 to $12 in a short time. I think its worth
$65 not including expropriation risk but had I been on margin I would have been
wiped out pretty much.

I believe 30-40% annual returns are doable if one is leveraged with a
concentrated portfolio but one can also get wiped out.
WEB's record is just awesome, and i doubt too many mortals will ever do better.
This weeks barrons has a commodity hedge investor who has done 18% on average I
think for the past 8 years but one of those year had a price appreciation of
over 60% probably when the portfolio was quite small.

Paul,

If you could make 30% per year, you would not worry about optimizing the return
by leveraging your house or your car. I would also say that you might need only
make 30% per year for a few years in order to put your nest egg out of reach of
nastiness. Depends on where you start.

In addition to EKS saying that 30% or more is a piece of cake, I have seen many
TV infomercials touting how is is easy to make money in either an up or a down
market. (So let's trade foreign exchange!) So we know it is true, right?

Anyway, as us mortals know, I have screened for this or that ratio, and
blacklisted for insider this or that, for moat or not, for CEO pay, for ethics,
for debt levels, for many things that nailed me in the past. I have discovered
that no matter what, there is always something ready to nail you. You cannot
sleep at night with 5 or 6 stocks no matter how well you study. And if you
think you can, you haven't been around the block enough, IMO. And a lot of
times it does not matter which stock you own, it is the industry or sector that
makes the difference.

Anyway, that's my 2 cents.

..........................

FYI. OT. Speaking of sectors -- As a friend, I manage the portfolios of a few
friends, many with over $1 million of assets. I don't track my own returns as
closely (but it's about the same, prob more), but here's the returns of my
largest friend's nestegg -- as compared to the NYSE, REIT index, and to SU
stock. (2006, is 6 months, of course).

My higher returns lately (since 2004) are totally due to severe overweight in
energy (50%) -- particularly oil sands. SU as an indicator of oil sands is up
28% YTD. I am also heavy into REITs. Over the years I have posted my moves,
before the fact.

<pre>
year 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006
portfolio 3.1% 32.9% 26.3% 23.0% 18.0%

NYSE -8.3% 36.7% 12.2% 6.9% 5.4%
REITs -4.3% 29.2% 23.5% 2.2% 10.5%
Suncor --- --- 41% 78% 28%
</pre>

My short answer here. I do believe the EKS has done well in the past, but I
have no idea if it is repeatable. No matter what EKS thinks now, I don't think
he will think the same if he has a bout of bad luck. Let EKS tell us his
portfolio investments now, and we will see how he does it going forward. And
there is no substitute for luck -- good or bad. :o)

EKS? I don't recall EKS saying he was in that "30% is a piece of cake" camp".
Please check that. To me, he seems to have been around the block a few times -
doesn't seem like he'd be characterizing investing so cavalierly. But if people
are doing 30%, I'd guess he would be one.

Here on the internet we don't know what anybody is really doing vs. what they
claim. If somebody is going mano-a-mano with their performance records, for me,
I'd like to see depth of performance - how many years, and I mean over a full
business cycle; breadth - what part of the totality of monies managed are we
talking about; and rough amounts - are we talking somebody "investing" $25k
over the past few years, $250K? $2500K? All these make a difference in risk
assumptions.

For example, I'll occasionally read on other threads about people who are doing
great - high percentage gains year after year. But when pressed, one finds
these are trading accounts, with the bulk of stock monies invested elsewhere in
funds (sometimes index). Or else they do have their only stock portfolio but
their asset allocation puts them heavily in bonds. I mean, if somebody is
claiming huge percentage gains on 35% of their assets, yet making 5-8% on the
bulk, I don't see bragging rights. Perhaps the person's just making risky bets
or dumping money all on one sector, and the person's making these bets only
because he's got bond backup, and he's not confident enough in his abilities or
luck to risk making maximum performance bets.

And of course, a kid with $25k is going to (and maybe should) try for higher
performance by making different bets from someone a lot older who's got $2500K
to work with.

---
Grommit, this is my opinion without knowing you or having much facts: You seem
to have been investing for a long time. If you are a managing a few million
dollar or less portfolios, I'll guess you are managing for friends/relatives --
maybe some or all of them retired. You likey really do not want to screw up and
mess up these peoples lives, and so you are pretty careful in the methods you
use and the stocks you choose. (OTOH, maybe all these people are very rich, and
you only get a tiny fraction of their monies to work with. -g-) If these people
are indeed retired, then it's my further opinion that they might not be asking
you to do what I call beat up on their money. That is, the person/couple with
$1M maybe is of the generation where they have defined benefit retirement
plans, medical/dental plans, maybe (as stated here by somebody else) making
more in retirement than when they worked. They don't need (I guess)and
shouldn't want (I assume) their $1M invested or worked so hard that they risk
losing a lot of it just to quickly make another $1M which they don't really
need at this point. (Okay, lots of assumptions and presumptions by me.)

Heading toward a conclusion, it's my opinion that these people are very
fortunate (as of today anyway -g-) that they've entrusted funds with you. I
know (or suspect) from your posts here, you are concerned with dividends,
value, etc. To me, having been around a zillion years, having seen the oddest,
strangest, damndest ways a company and and investor can lose money, it's my
opinion that if one looks at risk and reward and if these people are indeed "of
the older generation", it sure seems like it's a very fine performance record
you've delivered for them.

Of course, all jmo.

Grommit, I'm really surprised that you, and others, on this SI Board are also
so "surprised" and un-believing that one can achieve a reasonably regular
return of 30%/annum on the stock market !!

After all, one of your "sister Forums" not only apparently achieves in excess
of 30%/annum, it even calls itself "50% GAINS INVESTING" !!!

Personally, it certainly doesn't surprise me that Baker can achieve that level
of annual return, based on what I've read on his web site with regard to his
adoption of certain Fundamental Analysis principles.

The only comment I would have in this regard would concern some of the
specifics he would use in choosing his stocks in the first place, as well as
the overall size of his portfolio. By his own admission there are a number of
stocks that have, and still apparently do, lose money. It would be interesting
to know why, on what basis, he originally chose them.

I believe the key to making good returns on the stock market lies in the
criteria by which you ORIGINALLY choose your stocks for further analysis. In my
humble opinion, from what I've read on this Board, the majority of folk are
using largely irrelevant criteria. As a result the eventual performance of
these stocks reflects this.

I suspect that many folk have been caught up in the hype of all these ratios
that proliferate the web these days. It's "P/this" and "P/over that" and
"P/just about everything", with very little consideration about what the
underlying contents of that ratio is actually telling you.
I strongly suggest you just use P/E, and forget the rest. But that’s entirely
your business and your choice.

And in my humble opinion, once again, I would strongly recommend that folk
refrain from spending too much time on "Sector Analysis" and spend a lot more
time on INDIVIDUAL COMPANY SEARCHING AND ANALYSIS. As I said to E_K_S, a
possible exception in this regard would be the Resource sector, where price of
Resource is largely outside the control of company management, however
competent that management may be.
Needless to say, Resource price WILL affect stock price !

And one last thing, you folk have very little knowledge as to how I invest my

Paul, seeing as you’re, so obviously, directing your comments at me, why don’t
you, at least, have the courtesy to post me directly in the open forum, and we
can discuss or debate the issue(s) in an adult and constructive manner ?
I fail to understand your reluctance to communicate with me directly.

I mentioned to Grommit that folk, who have very little knowledge as to how I
invest my money, and what my overall strategy is, are yet prepared to publish
their own, preconceived ideas in this regard. A somewhat presumptuous attitude,
in my opinion.
I also mentioned to E_K_S that I invest in the stock market, primarily, for
Capital Gain and, by inference, not for a regular monthly income via dividends.

Yes, I do, regularly make 40%, or more, per annum from my stock market
investments using the strategy I’ve often referred to. I also know, for a fact,
that my good friend, Dr.Karl Posel, has regularly made +/-40%/annum for his
clients over many years. I know this from discussions with those very clients.
Now, if you are not willing to believe that, or find it difficult to
comprehend, for whatever reason, then that’s your business.

I’ve kept an open, public record at another Discussion Forum, for over 17
months, of 3 South African stocks, viz. DAW, DGC and WBO, that have had an
average Capital gain, in that time, of over 180%. My own web site has charts of
these stocks that show price increases of between 90% and 150% in periods of
between 9 and 15 months.
SI Forum rules preclude me from providing web site addresses, but if you’re
interested I’ll supply the information via an e-mail.

I’m somewhat surprised that you’re "in awe" of a regular 40%/annum, considering
that your fellow Moderator, Dale Baker, has a web site devoted to just that
sort of achievement.
No doubt your answer to that will be that Baker has a large, comprehensive
portfolio, with all manner of Calls and Puts, and whatever else, to mitigate
risk, while I advocate a far smaller number of stocks. Well ... that’s just the
way it is.

With regard to my investment strategy, I invest, primarily, for Capital Gain
and not, necessarily, for regular dividends. However, the latter is always
welcome !
On occasion I will liquidate profits and will invest those profits in Income
Generating investments such as rentable property. I purchase sectional title
apartments and obtain a regular income from their monthly rentals.

I certainly wouldn’t advocate, as you seem to allude, to leveraging oneself to
the eyeballs in the stock market. Only a reckless gambler would do that.
However, a Capital sum, built up over several years in the stock market, can
provide adequate "seed money" to earn future investment capital in a more
secure, income-generating environment.

bruwin: You seem to selectively pick the stocks you want so as to show the
results you want. That is, you've mentioned several other stocks here, and at
least a couple of those stocks have not done so well subsequently. And have
disappeared from inclusion in your remarks. I note AOB for example.

You can tell me over and over that 30-40% stock market gains are achievable and
are being done and being done consistently. If it is true, then I have to
conclude it's a fact with little substance. It's somebody investing a small
portion of their assets. Maybe, paradoxically, somebody who's not really
concerned with maximizing their net worth. Because if they were, then to my
mind, since I know of no investment vehicles - bonds, real estate, businesses,
commodities - that can deliver 30-40% profits consistently and safely - it
would behoove the investor to maximize this stock venue and minimize all
others.

I've never heard of any reputable money manager who has suggested to their
clients that they will make 30-40% or more per year on their stocks if they
follow the manager's advice. I don't know of any concentrated mutual fund that
delivers 30-40%per year, either consistently or over a business cycle. I don't
know of anyone else on this thread who claims to be making 30-40% on their
stocks year after year.

Well Paul, let me respectfully suggest that whether or not You, or I, or anyone
else for that matter, is or isn’t aware of something, has or hasn’t heard about
something, or does or doesn’t believe that something is possible, in no way
means that such isn’t the case.
Several centuries ago the apparent intelligentsia of the Western world believed
that the Earth was the centre of our Solar system. However, that didn’t make it
a fact, it just made it a common belief.

You state that 30 - 40% consistent stock market gains are a fact with little
substance. Well, that’s your opinion, and you’re entitled to it. I happen to
disagree with you. I say it is possible, PROVIDED you base your stock selection
on criteria that will positively identify companies that CURRENTLY REFLECT,
within specific aspects of their Financial Statements, their ability to make
ongoing and increasing profits and are thereby providing value for their
shareholders. I referred to several of those criteria in past Messages of mine
(See 22853 and 22946).

In my opinion, if you base your selection on those criteria, and a combination
of other Fundamental considerations, you will go a long way towards minimising
risk and maximising Capital Gain. This will also negate the need to have a 30,
40 or 50 stock portfolio in order to realise an above average return on your
money.

You also stated that I "selectively pick stocks to show the results (I) want".
In the past, you and other Board members have also "challenged" me to put
forward my own stock purchase portfolio.
Well ... let the facts speak for themselves ...

I first mentioned HANS and PDX on the 18/6/05. I expressed an interest, ONLY,
in AOB, ANST, MPAD, RAVN and RIMG on the 7/11/05 (22447). I purchased ANST for
$15.50. Before I decided to purchase AOB, there was a private placement which
caused the price to drop. After things settled I purchased AOB for $4.25.
In my Message, 22830, I clearly stated that I had HANS, PDX and BRY in my
portfolio.
In my Message, 23755, I also clearly stated that I had IPS and NATH in my
portfolio.
I also had TWIN in my portfolio at one time, but I’ve since sold it.

Here are the details of : STOCK/ PURCHASE PRICE/ DATE PURCHASED/ CURRENT PRICE/
PERCENTAGE GAIN/ APPROX. GAIN PER 12 MONTHS :-

AOB = $4.26 .. 4/1/06 .. $5.70 .. 33.8% .. 66%
ANST = $15.50 .. 15/11/05 .. $20.86 .. 34.5% .. 64.6%
BRY = $24.58(post split) .. 2/6/05 .. $34.11 .. 38.8% .. 35.8%
HANS = $48.65(post split) .. 27/7/05 .. $198.21 .. 307.4% .. 300%
IPS = $55.40 .. 2/8/05 .. $96.78 .. 74.7% .. 81.5%
NATH = $10.30 .. 9/11/05 .. $13.11 .. 27.3% .. 41%
PDX = $33.20(post split) .. 4/2/05 .. $45.65 .. 37.5% .. 26.5%

Capital Gain in 12 months = (66+64.6+35.8+300+81.5+41+26.5)/7 = 87.9%
Capital Gain in 12 months excluding HANS = (66+64.6+35.8+81.5+41+26.5)/6 =
52.5%
Capital Gain since purchase = (33.8+34.5+38.8+307.4+74.7+27.3+37.5)/7 = 79.1%
Capital Gain since purchase excl. HANS = (33.8+34.5+38.8+74.7+27.3+37.5)/6 =
41.1%.

As they say in the Classics, Paul, "I rest my case".

bruwin. If I am going to look at somebody's record, then I'd like to see both
what they like that fits their criteria, and also, what they actually buy.

AOB was first mentioned by you favorably 11/7/05. The price that day varied
from $6.15-6.79. It closed today at $5.70. Neither in your first post, nor in
any of your subsequent posts until now, although you spoke favorably of AOB,
did you actually state you purchased the stock. So I can't give any credit for
any gains you may be claiming now for this stock. Based on your published AOB
posts, you only recommended the stock and it turns out at higher prices than
currently.

NATH's interesting. A good recommendation by you, and at least one other person
is in. Looking over your claimed record with this thing though - it's not
understandable. Today you are saying you purchased NATH on Nov 9, '05 and post
percentage gains from that day? Is that perhaps inadvertent data mining?
Because you never mentioned the stock here until 2006. Even then it becomes
hard to determine if you are "expressing interest only" (in which in you choose
to exclude those from your performance record)or you have bought the stock.
(Post 23076, gives purchase price but conflicting heading as a 'watch list').

I like things simple and straightforward, and I guess I'd expect that to be
easy from somebody who has a very, very concentrated portfolio. But with stocks
sometimes included, sometimes excluded, sometimes categorized as watched,
sometimes categorized as bought, and not all of it clearly stated at the time,
plus claiming purchase prices well before posts on them... that is just too
much rigamarole for me to have much confidence in the performance numbers you
put forth.

I did a mutual fund screen on total annualized returns for one, three and five
years. Any hot sector can generate greater than 50% returns for two or three
years. This has been the case for the precious metals group. Emerging markets
and Energy stocks were a close second. The trick is to achieve these results
for five or more years across different market sectors.

There were 26 funds that achieved these returns:

One year >50%
Three year >50%
Five year > 30%

There were only two funds that achieved these returns:
One Year >50%
Three Year >50%
Five Year >50%

As a value investor my main goal is the preservation of my capital. It's not
the return "on" my capital that is so important, it is the return "of" my
capital.

My other main financial objective is to compound my money over time. At
10%/year my money doubles every 7.2 years...at 15%/year it doubles in 4.8
years. This is only true if I can minimize my equity losses and avoid specific
stock land mines that may lead to Total Portfolio Annual Losses.

I have found that buying undervalued companies is the easiest way to obtain
double digit returns over a long investment period (> than 5 years) w/o taking
on significant market risk. There are many different opinions from investors
and speculators as to what methods work the best but in order to stay in the
game, you must preserve your capital so you can be around for the next market
cycle.

LOL the story changes by the hour, who could possibly keep up?

NATH...supposedly purchased in 2005, but mentioned in early 2006 with a note
that says no DD has been done, worth watching though

AOB...mentioned at 6 or 7 bucks, told you that you were crazy to sell some up
there, but then supposedly bought at the low of the year a couple months
later...this person made only one singular buy of this stock he was so enamored
of, and it just happened to be at the low of the year? lol

various other stocks mentioned, but months later, amazingly, only the ones
which have risen substantially were purchased, and of course there is the
persistent mention of HANS, but only when it is up significantly, never when it
drops 25% from its high, to say that confidence is still high, and the price
dip is an opportunity...of course if HANS were then to take a big drop, said
poster would have sold at the high <g>

various posts claiming a 30, 40 or 45% return EVERY year (if a person had a 45%
return as claimed in one post, why would they claim "only" 30% in another post)

few if any mentions ever such as today i bought XYZ stock at such and such a
price, or sold a particular stock at some price

references to 3 south african stocks that were supposedly bought months ago,
and apparently we are supposed to believe that these 3 stocks comprise the
entire SA portfolio

said poster never has a losing trade, never has even a mediocre year

sorry, but i don't have a shovel big enough to get through all of the BS, but
i'm sure there is plenty more if one wanted to attempt it

i remember when he suggested AOB was rising ahead of earnings, yet earnings
were something like two months off...when i mentioned that fact, he blamed a
web site...people who can't even take the blame for a simple clerical error on
an earnings date, probably aren't to be relied upon for any accurate data
regarding their supposed track record

it's quite possible to achieve 30% or more for several years in a row, but to
claim to do that EVERY year, is absurd...EVERY year includes years such as
2002, the only fund i know that made over 30% that year is the prudent bear
fund, run by a buffoon who can't even get his fund up to its original starting
value of 10 bucks, even in the worst bear market in decades <g>...other than
being short, which of course this poster never mentions, 2002 was a year in
which it was a victory to achieve any gains at all by year's end

heck, i made over 30% last year, and i need more than my own fingers and toes
to count the number of mistakes i made in that one year alone <g> i've NEVER
seen a successful investor or trader who doesn't admit his or her mistakes, to
me success and denial are mutually exclusive

JMHO of course, and i'm sure i will hear back that i just don't understand the
subtle nuances of this posel system, and how it picks only the very best of
stocks (apparently it also identifies the point to buy said stocks at the low
of the year <g>), blah blah blah...rest assured, i understand quite well....lol

Okay, E_K_S. I see where we do have several funds which claim five-year 50%
annualized gains. They do seem to be sector funds. So how does a value investor
play them? Back five years ago, maybe a purchase for a small amount. Somewhere
along the line maybe taking profits. OTOH, maybe after seeing the success,
doing the opposite and betting on continued success by putting more money into
one or a couple more of the funds. Hard to imagine an investment counselor
advising somebody to put a large percentage of their monies into more than a
couple of these though. Unless it was a do or die situation.

You bought one of these funds, you do get bragging rights. Having one of the
top performing funds over the period of time you have held it.
So if you are saying making 30-50% on your money for several years is doable
and somebody is doing it, I have to say yes. For a normal person, or a normal
risk averse investor --- though I'm not sure I can give definitions for
"normal" -gg- ---, my bet is this would be one fund out of several owned, and
in that several would be maybe an index fund, or a USA growth fund, or a value
fund, or maybe a bunch of individually chosen stocks. And if so, and if one of
the sector funds you mentioned was a perhaps a normal 10% overall portfolio
weighting (at most), the portfolio has benefited. But not by itself has it got
the portfolio to a 35% per annum gain. For that to happen, the other 90% has
had to do fabuloso, and that - for value investors (people who somewhat weigh
risk vs. reward) - that is a blessing that only occurs infrequently.

Again, jmo and experience, which as pointed out, might be limited.

Hi Paul - It's not always VALUE that wins out but also luck and timing . I
bought IFN (India Fund) a close end mutual fund in the late 1990's. I paid
around $10.00/share in 1998 because it was selling below it's NAV. It had a
brief run up towards $20.00 but started to lose value and by 2002 all of my
gains were gone.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=IFN&t=my&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=

I held the fund for a long time but decided it was dead money and closed out my
position. I recently revisited this fund and noticed that it had traded as high
as $65.00 in 2006.

How was I to know that this fund had a chance to move that high. I bought
because the market price was less than the NAV and eventually sold for a small
loss when the NAV was at a premium to the market price.

I have to keep reminding myself that this is suppose to be a value forum. I
sure don't see any "value" in the picks by whoever Mr. X is.

What ever happened to value plays? Am I the only one still looking for them -
sure haven't seen any posted hear lately.

For those of you who have forgotten or never knew; Here is one example of what
a value pick might look like:

Market Cap $90 million
Tangible BV $165 million
Total CA 125 million with 25 million in cash/ST investments

Total C. Liabilities $25 million

Executive salaries are modest. Sales stable but not growing.
Old line business, been around forever and a day.
Positive (but small) cash flow.

I believe the Boston area real estate is substantially undervalued on the
balance sheet as much of it has been around forever and would have been written
off over the years.

The real thing I don't like is that management controls the voting stock so the
common shareholders can never really control the company. Of course, the same
could be said for most any Fortune 500 type of company as the good ole boys
network controls the corporate Boards.

It is thinly traded so it takes time to get a position, but I've been buying
SCX over the past month around the $14 area so take a look and see if it meets
more of what I believe a value stock should look like. If not, please show me

bruwin,

HANS is most certainly not a "value" play, as is defined in the U.S.

Most value funds here seek long-term capital appreciation by investing in the
equities of well-financed, well-managed companies believed to be priced below
their intrinsic values.

I view HANS as more of a concept or fad stock, which is much more appropriate
for an aggressive growth fund. Based on P/E and P/S ratios, HANS stock price is
certainly expecting robust growth in the coming years. Is there opportunity?
Yes. However, it is not clear to me that HANS has a significant competitive
advantage over other beverage makers. So to me, this is a high-risk play.

HANS has certainly had outstanding returns over the past couple years. However,
at this point, I do not know whether HANS would be a buy, hold, or sell here.
And since I don't know, I will stay on the sidelines.

A value stock to me would be something like COP.

I encourage you to post your future purchases and sales on this thread for

While I do have bruwin on ignore, I must say that he has been absolutely

I view HANS as more of a concept or fad stock

Perhaps that is the same view people had of KO in the 50s or 60s.

Looking at the financials of HANS, it isn't capital intensive and cash flows
have grown quite handsomely YoY.

Moreover, on the Income Statement, Revenues have doubled, Gross margins have
expanded slightly, but where they've shown the most leverage is on the Op.
margin line from 24.5% to 29.0%.

Remember, the definition of "value", it is purchasing an asset at a discount to
its intrinsic value. Where some find "value" in the assets, HANS value is in
its future growth.

SCX appears maybe mildly undervalued. I see it as a possible revision-to mean
play as I look at current p/sales and p/book because those numbers look lower
now than over past seven years. The current numbers seem similar to '03, also
when the stock seems like it was same price as now. As the business got a
little better the stock moved up. Maybe that'll happen again.

I don't see it as a value stock that's so much more appealing than many other
stocks that show up here. Is it because "tangible BV is $165 million" and
market cap is "$90 million"? Stated book value hasn't improved in nine years
(Was $25.99/sh.,moved up some, and now at $24.86/sh.) I use book value in a
couple of ways: one is to see how the stock price and book value dance. For
SCX, for the past seven years, the stock price approached book value maybe one
time. Maybe it'll do so again. There doesn't seem to be a catalyst to make it
happen though. Management doesn't seem so motivated. Secondly, I like to use
book value to measure value (where the business allows that, e.g. not
consulting, IT, etc.). This decade, the very best that SCX could earn on its
equity (or assets, because there's no long-term debt) has been about 6.1%. This
when it even could claim profitable years. To me, I won't pay anywhere near
book value for 6.1%. If 6.1% is the best roe they can deliver, their stock
SHOULD sell for below book value. Every cigar butt imo has value, and at some
price below book value, the stock is a value. I have my methods for
calculating; I presume others have there's. At somewhere around current .55
p/bk, the stock might be a small bet. Prospects going forward don't seem so
great; there's no catalyst. So I look backwards. As a revision-to-mean play and
a with dividend while waiting, that could work. Otoh, low trading volume,
management that won't or can't do better than bond returns with the assets they
manage, it could be a value trap.

Well, well, well ... Dave !!! What a welcome dissertation, considering the past
Board reactions to my posts !! Of course, whether or not you read this is
another question, seeing as my "name" resides on your personal Ignore List !!

Yes, you’re 100% correct in your comments. Rather than to try and base one’s
stock selections on a popular definition and "conform" to those tenets, I
believe one should rather identify those criteria, similar to what you
indicate, because those aspects reflect the current, ongoing ABILITY to MAKE
PROFITS. Your reference to "Operating Margin", IMHO, is a VERY important one.
As you quite rightly state, I couldn’t care if the company sold soft drinks,
car parts, novelty goods etc.. etc.., just as long as it made MONEY !!

In my opinion, making ongoing Capital Gain is very closely related to "VALUE"
!!

As an aside ... a recent Client of mine asked me to assist him in a problem he
was having entering, into the web site, one of the stock screens I supply. To
test the system, I entered this screen, which incorporates the criteria I look
for, but emphasises "GROWTH RATES". After searching every sector of the USA
Market in a matter of seconds (free of charge), excluding Finance, it came up
with the following 11 companies. In brackets is the percentage Capital Gain one
would have achieved in the last 12 months ....

BJS(37%), BOOM(75%), CRDN(150%), CRED(45%), ENDP(23%), GRMN(150%), GRP(60%),
MCO(22%), SAY(40%), SLB(62%) and TGE(64%). That's an average of 66% per annum.

I wonder how many well-paid Fund Managers, with their multi-stock portfolios,
earned even 50% of 66% for their Clients, over the same period, after deducting
their "Management Fees" for all their "hard" work ?

Of course, Fund Managers cannot operate as individuals can, considering the
funds at their disposal, plus other restrictions. This is why I encourage
individuals to obtain the necessary know-how to analyse stocks for themselves
and be the "masters" of their own investment destiny.

P.S. I wonder if I'll ever find out who the other "17" SI members are who have
me on THEIR Ignore List ??!! {;-)

a bunch of them are energy stocks, you say you don't buy resource stocks
because they are subject to the price of the resource, but now you highlight
oil stocks? LOL...wow there's some genius, oil went from 40 bucks to 75 bucks a

pick a date, and post a portfolio of 5 stocks (or 10 or 12, whatever) that you
would buy THAT day at the CURRENT price on THAT day, not a bunch of could's and

Firstly, let me say that I'm most surprised to see that you're not one of the
"18" that have me on their "Ignore List". For someone who thinks so little of
what I have to say, why do you bother with the likes of me ??!!

Secondly, you're obviously missing the point behind my post.
What I was trying to convey was the FACT that companies that exhibit or reflect
certain criteria within their Income Statements and Balance Sheets tend to be
the ones that make profits and are thereby sought after by informed investors,
which in turn, causes their stock price to rise.

Those criteria that my stock screen targeted obviously didn't appear there
overnight. Therefore one would have been directed to them quite a while back.

Yes, I don't advocate Resource stocks for reasons I've explained before.
Needless to say, the stock screening process is but the first step in choosing
stocks to invest in. There are other factors which one should also consider
before making one's final selection.

Anyway, don't worry yourself about my "trivia", I'm sure you have far more

yes i'm sure others can see right through your nonsense as well

you said your screen emphasized "growth rates," but what it appears to find is
past strong growth...of course we have no idea what criteria you are using, or
what results you might have actually gotten, since it's just another of your
nebulous black-box type posts...no doubt that finding stocks that were fast
growers in the past year may clue you in to companies that may continue to post
strong growth, but to then give trailing 12 month stock gains for those stocks
as if you participated in those gains is laughable, and just another of your
distortions showing how your "system" is supposedly so superior...and now you
say well of course you would screen further before actually buying these
stocks, and apparently exclude the resource stocks, so why post the gain for
stocks you wouldn't even buy? that's the thing, without real buys and sells,
everything is just hypothetical, and in hindsight, we can all make trillions of
dollars...what value is that to anyone?

once again, post 5 stocks you would buy now, at current prices, you won't do
this because you might be wrong, and that won't serve your ego...the rest of us
post ideas when we buy them, for all to see, not every stock we buy, but
certainly enough that if we were to then claim we had no losing trades, and
made 40% a year EVERY year, we would at least have something to show as
evidence (not hindsight, misinformation and outright nonsense, but real
facts)...of course none of us claim such absurd success rates, since we live in
the real world, where some of our trades turn out to be losers, and we all have
years like 2002 where being in the black at all is an accomplishment

VCI, which creates those newspaper advertising inserts, is part of a duopoly in
the business. Their competitor has been very aggressive in seeking business,
and this has hurt VCI. Profit margins and roa, which have been good in past,
have come down.

I don't know what the correct strategy would be for VCI --- for me, I'd guess
I'd want to somewhat counterpunch with beefed up sales and marketing, and
continue or start to manage the company as a cash cow. Management though has
made a decision to diversify by "lessening its reliance on inserts". This to me
is not a VCI shareholder friendly option. I'd rather they give us shareholders
money in form of dividend and let us diversify or not by re-allocating these
monies. I've no assurance that VCI has any management history of, or skills in,
a secondary business or in integrating such a business or that they can earn an
adequate return on the premium price they've paid.

VCI stock's down, rightly so, and at a multiyear low. The insert business isn't
going away though, and VCI may yet do okay again. I've been wrong on the stock
buying under $30/sh. -- and it's drifted and fallen to under $20. For me, my
shares are very few, and I'm willing to add (and did) a bit more at current
price on the assumption that maybe the carnage is near an end.

CHS is close to getting interesting to me, though their SSS numbers haven't
been stellar the last few months. ANN seems less expensive in several metrics
(particularly P/S), and seems to have regained some momentum in SSS. And the
limited time I spend in the malls, ANN stores seems to have more traffic than
CHS stores. I've never understood how CHS is so much more profitable than ANN.

Watching both, but don't own either currently.

Also interesting to note, I think the impact of higher energy costs are finally

Mr. Jonson, first of all, I feel, in no way, obliged, to comply with any of
c.worth’s requests.
I never intended to join this Board as a "stock tipper". I believe I’ve made my
reasons, for attending this Forum, clear in recent Messages.

As a general rule, I don't jump into, and out of, stocks as often as some on
this Board may do. I prefer to invest in a company's stock on a medium to
longer term basis.
I generally base my buying and selling decisions of stock that I own, or am
considering to buy, after that company publishes its Financial Results (that's
when you know most about its Financial "affairs"), OR if there is some major
announcement that will have an obvious detrimental, or positive, effect on its
price. There have been some exceptions to that rule, but not often.

At this point in time, I can do no better than to refer you to my Message 24223
which details my current USA stock portfolio. I have no PRESENT reason to sell
at least 4 of them because I have not seen anything within my required criteria
of their Financial Fundamentals that gives me any reason to sell them. Two of
the stocks, PDX and NATH, have done well in the past, but I wouldn’t be
surprised that the time may be close when the Fundamentals may indicate it’s
time to sell. I’m just waiting for confirmation in their next set of results.
As a resource stock, BRY will always be a "risk" for me. Its Annuals are very
good, but its Quarterlies fluctuate.

Therefore I can presently do no better than to suggest :-

FAVOURED STOCKS :-
HANS
IPS
ANST
AOB
UNDER REVIEW :-
PDX
NATH
RISKY :-
BRY

Take your pick.

Bruwin,

Yes, HANS was a good call.

As you quite rightly state, I couldn’t care if the company sold soft drinks,
car parts, novelty goods etc.. etc.., just as long as it made MONEY !!

True, but....

The key to understanding a business is its "entry barriers" or "moat" that
protects the franchise. Companies that reside in industries with little to no
entry barriers earning high Returns on Capital (or high profitablity) will
fairly quickly see competition. Thus, competition will erode profitablity and,
perhaps, returns on capital.

The question then becomes, does HANS have a franchise with high barriers to
entry? I recall in the early 90's, Snapple was, yet another, interesting
franchise that was purchased by Quaker Oats. Of course, Quaker bought Snapple
at its peak and it was downhill from there. Therefore, what does HANS do that
no one else can copy? Is it in their distribution system? What causes them to
earn those returns? Where can I purchase their products? etc.

I wonder how many well-paid Fund Managers, with their multi-stock portfolios,
earned even 50% of 66% for their Clients, over the same period, after deducting
their "Management Fees" for all their "hard" work ?

You bring up another interesting point. Some (or perhaps many) active managers
are actually "closet indexers". As the saying goes, "It is better to fail
conventionally, rather than unconventionally." Of course, the "pros" face what
is called "career risk" if they lag an index for a period of time. If you are
interested in learning more about closet indexers and career risk, I'd read
what Jeremy Grantham has to say.

One thing you should do and you don't have to post the results on this board is
run your screen looking for stocks today and check back a year from now to see
how they did.

RE: Clothing Retailers - TLB (Talbots Inc.)

Does anybody have an opinion on TLB Talbots Inc.? They hit my five year low
list recently and a brief review of their financial shows very little long term
debt, positive free flow cash flow, $1.80/share cash on hand and a book value
of over $12.00/share. The stock closed at $17.86.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=TLB

The PE is at 11 and they continue to pay their dividend which now yields 2.80%.

On Feb 6, 2006, Talbots announced that they had acquired women's clothing
retailer J. Jill Group Inc. It looks like this impacted last quarter's earnings
and maybe the market is discounting another hit on this quarter's earning too.
For the year they still should earn close to $1.00/share.

At the end of 2005, there were 1,083 stores in the United States, Canada, and
the UK. The company operates a product development office in New York City, a
computer center in Tampa, Florida, and a call center in Knoxville, Tennessee.
The corporate headquarters is still in Hingham. A majority of the outstanding
shares of Talbots' common stock is owned by Aeon (U.S.A.), Inc.

Talbot has a pretty good WEB Site and it seems to complement their brick and
mortar stores.
Here is what their customers think
http://www.epinions.com/content_94867000964
WEB site
http://www1.talbots.com/talbotsonline/index.asp

Is this stock considered a buy at current levels? A $30 to $40 price target in
a 24-36 months may be possible if earnings get back to $1.80-$2.00/share. If
management can integrate their new J. Jill Group purchase w/ good results, the
market may also reward TLB w/ a PE expansion to 15-17.

STNR :- Based on our criteria, STNR's Fundamentals are quite good but not
exceptional. A few brief comments I have are its Annual T/O percentage increase
is down from previous period, as is its EPS.

Its Operating Margin is not as high as we would require, and this would keep it
off our Buy list.
Positive factors are its Debt seems well under control and is not impinging on
its Income Statement.
It has a good Pre-tax Return on Capital Employed.

There's not much major percentage increase in its Quarterly and last Annual
Bottom line. In fact, its Quarterlies have been quite flat. I suspect this has

Several of these retailers are attractive imo. Perhaps there's a macroeconomic
situation: less discretionary money available to people after paying higher
mortgages, gasoline, etc. Or the clothiers are suspected to be over malled.
Perhaps people expect the retailers' SSS to drop. A difficult macro environment

Thanks Paul - I will get some HD Put to me in August. This will be my first

in late 2004 and 2005. I owned Sears, Target, JC Penny and Home Depot.

I like HD better than TLB as their merchandise is not as discretionary and HD
owns many of their service companies and distributors.

Maybe you are right that it might be a good time to start to accumulate a small
basket of these retailers as they sell off and move lower.

I do own shares in SVU but I see it as a defensive position and they are not
considered a niche retailer like TLB. Notice that all of these retailer stocks
are below the S&P 500 average other than JCP.

That's OK Robert.
I'm afraid I prefer not to overly advise folk on what or how they should
invest. Which stocks you buy and how many of each is really up to you, and what
your own personal stock analysis tells you. You have my e-mail address should
you wish to discuss anything further.

A point to remember is this .... quite often good, QUALITY companies are
targeted by Short sellers who have seen Value in those stocks. They usually
have fairly "deep pockets" and will use their financial muscle to "force" the
price down, having sold ahead at a higher price.

So what you have is a stock, that over the longer term, has an upward price
move with occasional fall off in its price. On my web site I show three
examples of S.A. companies that display this quite clearly.
Therefore one needs the "courage of one's Fundamental convictions" to hold onto
this stock because one is confidently aware of its Fundamental Value due to the
integrity of one's stock analysis.

It has happened to me in the past, that no sooner had I "recommended" a stock,
then coincidentally it suffered from selling pressure, probably for the above
reason. I was then "confronted" by an irate buyer !!

By all means buy those stocks if you wish, but bear in mind that, in my own
strategy, I don't get "married" to my stocks. Whether I hold or sell them
depends on an ongoing scrutiny of their latest published financial results.
When they fail to meet or exceed specific criteria, obtained from within their
Income Statement and Balance Sheet, I sell them.

Dave, I have two screening operations. The first is a stock screen (one of
several), built up on a particular web site, incorporating financial ratio
targets and one or two other criteria.
The web site searches 9000 to 10000 USA stocks for those that match my
criteria, as best it can. The web site can go back to between 3 and 5 years,
depending on the screen item.
However, most of my items are for current figures.

From this short list of between, say, 40 to 50 companies, further "pruning" is
required because web site screening data doesn’t always give one exactly the
financial ratio etc.., that one is looking for, so one has to get as close as
possible with what’s available.

To narrow the list down even further, I import a company’s Income Statement and
Balance Sheet directly from the web into my EXCEL spreadsheet for the second
screening process. This contains a further screening mechanism which tells me
whether a stock, SIMULTANEOUSLY, meets or exceeds ALL of my required criteria.

From those stocks that pass the test, I consider which are currently relatively
cheap or expensive. Those that are currently on the cheap side are examined in
terms of their possible greatest, medium term percentage price increase. The
companies that top that list are the ones I would target.

My current overweight position is SIL which very few regulars on this thread

its in a foreign country whose leader would like to nationalize everything.
yet when I look at the company projections the company looks like its worth
around $65 assuming the company mine gets completed, they meet their
projections and the mine doesnt get nationalized. since the current price is
$15.60 I feel the returns here outweigh the risks. If metal price continue to

I like your idea of posting five stocks you would buy at current prices. I will
post five stocks that I mentioned on this board. Some are not buys, but I still
hold shares in all of them. I usually have a concentrated portfolio of five or
six stocks, so I am posting ninety percent of my portfolio outside of sector
funds in gold and oil.

BEL 2.77. My average price is 3.00. There has been interesting news on the
stock lately with a changing of the majority of the BOD and the resignation of
the CEO.

CKSW 1.70 My average price is 1.55.

FMD 47 My average price is 22. I recently sold half my position.

IMOS 6.00 My average price is 5.40.

NPTH 11.50 My average price is 7.00.

One stock that I am buying that doesn't fall in the value category is MEDX. It
is similar to other stocks mentioned here (Madharry's SIL) only in the sense
that it has a tremendous risk vs. reward ratio. With all the agreements,
partnerships and large cash horde I consider the risk minimal. But like any
biotech stock it is no value play.

The others I mentioned are mostly small cap stocks which is an area that I

cordial and constructive. I don’t believe the same could be said for C.Worth’s
approach.
Rest assured, I can take any heat in any kitchen.

If you believe that my returns on equity are "unusually high" and are
"unsubstantiated" then that’s your opinion, to which you're entitled. I told
this Board, quite a long time ago, what were the contents of my USA portfolio.
I made reference in Messages 22830 (23/12/05) and 23755 (16/4/06) as to several
of the stocks that I owned and when I purchased them, and others.

In my humble opinion, as long as individuals continue to use ratios such as
P/S, P/BK and P/CF as their primary means of stock selection, then they stand
the risk of choosing stocks that will not necessarily reward them with, what
you refer to as, "unusually high returns on equity".
I suspect that the reason why I have achieved "unusually high returns on
equity" probably lies in the criteria that I use to screen for and choose my
stocks. None of the above three ratios form any part of that stock selection.

I’m not sure why you included reference to SIL in your message to me. If you
want me to comment on the stock, all I can say is that this company hasn’t made
one cent of profit in over 5 years ! I’m not sure for how long you’ve held this
stock, but surely there must be better places to put your money, until such
time that SIL can prove, via the numbers within its Financial Statements, that
it can make ongoing profits and provide value for its long-suffering
shareholders ?

Your sentence, "IF metal price continue to appreciate which I EXPECT they will"
goes some way to supporting my contention that Resource-based companies can be
risky ventures as the price of their Resource, on which they are so dependent,
is completely out of the control of company management.

The "IF" and the "EXPECT" indicates that the Resource price could possibly
rise, and there again, it could possibly fall .... not to mention the fact that
this mine hasn’t even been completed yet ! I must say, you certainly have an
appetite for Risk.
I wish you all the best with your investments.

i don't pretend to always be cordial or constructive, so if you don't like that
fact, maybe you should put me on ignore <g>

if you presume that you are cordial and constructive at all times, i would say
that (a) you are way off base, and (b) that assumption on your part has about
as much credibility as your purported investment success...as in, you can't
back that statement up either

how many times have you used this thread to take shots at dale baker? were
those posts cordial and constructive? in many cases the comments therein might
have had value, until you decided to add the parts where you took a shot at
him...he posts EVERY trade he makes, you post basically none...i may not always
agree with him, especially when it comes to politics, but there is no disputing
his investment record, nor his contribution to this site...the same cannot be
said for you

i could cite many other examples, but the point is the same...your posts come
across as pompous and dictatorial, far more often than cordial...by the way,
what happened to the friend you invented to respond to one or two of your posts
here after dale banned you from his thread? LOL...full points for that one,
that was hysterical as well, did we already discuss the fact that i love to
laugh?

you stated in one post that you don't like the kind of dialogue that i attempt,
but you don't want a dialogue of any kind...you want to come here and
pontificate to us about your supposedly superior system from dr. posel, and yet
you are never willing to post any real time buys or sells, you just cite stocks
you already supposedly own and which have gone up, or you give a list of stocks
that are of interest, and later you say you bought one or two of them, and they
have risen X%, etc...you've never admitted a mistake or a losing trade, you
claim that you make 30, 40, 45%, whatever EVERY year, and you play this i'm
better than you/him game with people like dale baker...is it any surprise that
you are treated with disdain?

perhaps what you should do is start your own thread, since while everyone has
their own idea of "value," it's clear that your perceptions of value are much
different than most people on this thread...there are many stocks that i buy
which i wouldn't discuss on this thread, because they are not what most people
would consider "value" ideas, especially as described in the header of this
thread...instead of trying to bend the thread to your definition of value, why
not begin your own thread called bruwin value discussion, or something like
that? you can even ban me if you want, right off the bat <G>

Okay, Madharry, following you into CHEUY.pk for a few shares.

Fwiw, I am still holding a few shares of port operator Hutchinson Whampoa, also
controlled by this man. The stock has stalled. I continue to hold it as a play
on commodities shipping into China. And in some sense, from China.
They have a tie-up with railroad company KCS in Mexico; and, as posted
previously, I've purchased that stock also for that reason as well:

http://www.forbes.com/global/2006/0619/034.html?partner=yahoomag

A Marty Whitman fund apparently increased its purchases of CHEUY last quarter,
so somebody there believes the stock is "safe and cheap". I suspect it will be
a couple of years before purchasers of CHEUY will know if they made the right
decision in placing their bet now on the company.

E_K_S, I'm very wary of any company whose business is very dependent on the
price of a Resource over which its Management has no control.
My strategy is based on Investing in a company for the medium to longer term,
and not Speculating on its price performance due to particular circumstances at
the time, such as "Will Oil stocks go up this week because of a bomb blast in
the Middle East ?"

In my opinion certain Oil stocks would fall into that category probably more
than others. Those companies that refine oil may not be that sensitive to the
oil price than are others.
After all, we currently MUST have our oil on a daily basis, so refiners WILL
always be doing business. So it's a case of how well they run their business
etc.. etc.., and that we can determine from what we see within their Income
Statements and Balance Sheets.

And, Yes, I do have BRY in my portfolio. I liked the look of the company at the

I believe I have made very few references to Dale Baker on this Board. I would
be more than willing to repeat them on his own Thread, but needless to say I
cannot do so.

I don't believe I resorted to derogatory remarks about him in this particular
thread. I just questioned a strategy that incorporated a very large portfolio
of stocks, some of which, by his own admission, were impacting negatively on
his portfolio.

I would have thought that it would surely be better to be able to choose,
analyse and hold one's stocks in such a way that one took maximum advantage of
those better QUALITY stocks, whose Fundamentals indicated that they were
currently making ongoing profits and providing value for their shareholders.

Dale is very much a proponent of doing one's OWN company analysis based on
Fundamental principles. In that regard I'm with him all the way.
IMHO, it's just a question of how one implements that principle.

Cheung Kong - difficult to analyse. Holding company (mostly a 50% stake in
Hutchinson) and on the operational side a real estate developer in Hong Kong
and China. The stock is trading at a small premium to book. (P/B around 1.05)

Both HK and China's real estate market have been booming but the Chinese
government is clamping down on RE speculation, which could hurt companies like
Cheung Kong. If i remember correctly the 97/98 crisis hurt Cheung Kong quite a
bit.

On the other side, Templeton owns 6.5% of the company stock, so I consider this

Large cap tech is cheap nowadays. I own EBAY, MXIM EMC and ADI (bought today).
All those stocks have strong balance sheets with substantial cash on hand. For
example ADI does not look that cheap on a PE basis, but if one subtracts the
7.2$ in net cash to get to the EV value (around 23$/share), the forward PE for
2007 is <12.
the company may be involved in the backdating scandal but i think the financial
fallout from this will be small. In the meantime, the company is increasing
it's dividend (Yielding 2%), option grants have been falling substantially and
the current accounting rules overstate financial expense from option grants
anyways. So unless the semiconductor market falls apart, ADI (as well as MXIM)
is a pretty cheap stock, IMO.

Another tech stock i would consider a good value is AMAT, but i do not own a

My rationale:
1) NATH P/S ratio is only around the median for food companies
2) Strong revenue growth (mid teens) and strong growth in operating earnings
3) 20M$ in net cash (>3$/share)
4) Strong brand name

I like the strong brand name relative to it's small market cap. As it is, NATH

I went to Amazon.com and looked for Dr. Posel's works. I did find two books,
but one of them appears to be irrelevant (Investing on the JSE). The other,
"Enjoy Investing on the Stock Exchange" appears to be written for a beginner (I

by Greenblatt also has a "cheesy" title).

As such, can you point me to his works?

Hi Madharry - The two things I look at for "Value" when evaluating Resource
companies are (1) the net cost to the company for the resource (cost of land
plus cost to get it out of the ground) and (2) The current & future market
value for that resource.

Many times you can find a company that is sitting on huge resource reserves
that are significantly undervalued to the market rates even after you discount
the capital expenditures necessary to get that resource out of the ground and
to market.

This is true for many types of resources both above and below ground (Lumber,
minerals, oil, natural gas, coal etc.). Land resources also include the
utilization "rights" including right of ways (both under and above ground),
building zoning regulations by City, County, State & Federal authorities all
which may include hidden real tangible value not reflected on the company's
balance sheet or by the stock market (i.e. stock price).

A few examples - Williams Company sold their "right-of-way" access next to and
below the ground of their natural gas pipe lines to telecommunication companies
building black fibre digital networks. Some of the railroad companies did this
too.

Wall Mart has been land banking agricultural and low use acreage later to get
them rezoned or traded for high use commercial parcels where new stores and
shopping centers are constructed. This is true for many of the home builders
that have land banked acreage for future development but may not develop it
until they can obtain city approval that may take years to get. These assets
are booked on the balance sheet at cost and in a lot of cases understate the
true economic value of the resource.

Finally, One's worthless asset may be anther's crown jewel and the market does
not price the potential value correctly until new buyers show interest. This is
the case for James River Coal Co. (JRCC). Pirate Capital LLC, a hedge fund
company has been acquiring shares and now owns 14.6% of all shares (as of Feb
2006) and is replacing board members so a sale of the company can be made "to
increase stockholders value".

http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/060707/james_river_proxy_fight.html?.v=1

Natural Resource Partners (NRP) apparently finds more value in these coal
reserves than the market sees for James River Coal Co. (JRCC)NRP has been
buying up all the small coal acreage in the area. Maybe James River Coal will
be forced to sell NRP.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=2y&s=JRCC&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=nrp

In Summary, there are loads of hidden value to be found in many of these
resource companies or companies that own many of these "hard" land assets.
Value is not only the discounted stream of cash flows generated from an on
going business but is also found in underutilized assets that management
neglects or worse does not recognize the potential market value.

Yes, Madharry, there may be greater scarcity today in terms of Oil, due to
known reserves nearly equating with global demand. However, newer technologies
in terms of going deeper in offshore exploitation etc.., may boost reserves,
albeit at greater cost. This could reduce the price of oil over the medium
term. And certain metals may or may not be in sufficient supply, depending on
demand due to industrial output.

But their prices can also, suddenly and dramatically, be influenced by
political factors or other aspects which are out of the control of a company’s
management, irrespective as to how competent that management is in running
their company.
The recent move of the gold price from over $700/ounce down to under
$600/ounce, in a relatively short space of time, is a good example. Needless to
say, gold mining stocks felt that volatility.

Personally, I believe that experienced and informed Fundamental Analysts are
not folk who will go chasing after "fad" stocks. I also believe that they will
be more inclined to target companies where that company’s Management has far
more control and influence over the components of their own business plan.
Speaking for myself, when I interrogate a company’s Financial Statements, I
like to think that they are reflecting the ongoing ability of the company and
its Management to provide value for their shareholders, without too many
question marks related to factors outside of their control.

I also prefer to wait until I can see adequate PROOF, within a company's
Financial Statements, that they are currently able to make ongoing profits and
are currently providing value for shareholders. This may mean "sacrificing"
some early Capital Gain because I was not prepared to speculate on what may, or
may not, happen. But, in my own experience, once a company has achieved this
profit-making ability, there has always been good future profits to be made,
with far less Risk involved.

I’d go along with much of the initial comments in your message E_K_S.
You may be interested in the following, which my good friend Dr. Karl Posel
included in one of his books, entitled "Investing in Gold on the JSE"
(Johannesburg Stock Exchange).

He concluded that there are 5 variables that need to be considered when
evaluating a Gold producer.
Before detailing these, he made, what in my opinion is, a very relevant
observation .... "There are bound to be many differences between a gold
producer and an industrial company of the manufacturing type. The CARDINAL one
is that the gold producer does not determine the selling price of its final
product."
I suggest the same could be said for many other metals as well.

The variables he outlined were :-
1)Cost per ton of ore milled.
2)Grade of ore, eg. gms per ton
3)Revenue received per ton of ore milled
4)The Time Rate of Change of the Revenue/Ton
5)The Time Rate of Change of the Cost/Ton

The values of the Revenue/ton and Cost/ton unfortunately do not necessarily
remain constant from quarter to quarter. To further complicate matters, the
Time Rate of Change of each of these two quantities is also to be different.

Needless to say, to come to an meaningful evaluation when having to consider 5
variables requires some "adequate mathematics" !

I'll use recent drop in MMM (They lowered earnings estimates.) as an

Their lowered low estimate is $4.55 for the year. That gives a p/e estimate of
16.3 on current price. That's relatively low: Going back ten years, the lowest
average annual p/e for 3M was 18.3 in 1997.

Of course, 3M might yet cut its estimates further. And if the erstwhile growth

Basically Tyco is being hurt by commodity costs. But I like their businesses

due in 2008 after the split up. By the way I also gave up on EMS which has
turned out to be a good idea. I couldn't believe it when JBl got to 40. Way
overpriced compared to its peers. Basically though the midtier EMS companies
