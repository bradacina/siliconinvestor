Paul: <<I feel like I'm in quicksand.>>Good analogy. Many of these sinkers
illustrate Soros' reflexivity concept, where price and expectations not only
describe, but impact, fundamental value. Despite the price likely being below
fundamental value, bad news impacting price feeds back thru credit and possibly
customer relationships to hit fundamentals. This fundamental impact is then
reported and price is impacted. At some point either the Co. goes BK or the
market recognizes that all actual & potential ugliness has been discounted.
Decreasing reaction to negative revelations would be an important indicator of
that latter condition.

Wallace Rivers, re: SGH, SGU. SGH's dropped a bit today, as you likely know.
May indeed be a buy opp. now. I find that sometimes these structures, where it
takes a bit of work to find and understand what an investor is getting
(subordinated issue, K-1), discourage me. So I assume others too have a
tendency to avoid such things, and therein possibly create a discrepancy
between price and true value.

I'm likely to still pass on SGH. Fwiw,here are a few stocks in Lehman's natural

From:- with a K
Bullish Fool story on ALD. Snip:

Allied Capital has been around since 1960, and has had 38 consecutive years
without a lowered dividend payout (current yield is just shy of 9%). When most
people think of private capital, they think of the big-risk/big-return venture
capital game, but in actuality that's just a small part of the private capital
world.

Allied provides equity to companies in illiquid situations so they can factor
receivables, restructure balance sheets, fund expansion, or to finance a merger
or acquisition. Additionally, Allied Capital holds about 25% of its funds in
commercial mortgage-backed securities, which it seeks to buy well below face
value. In exchange for its money, Allied Capital takes notes that average about
14% interest, an occasional equity kicker (adding a few more basis points to
overall returns), and it will generally demand oversight over the recipient
company's board of directors. Almost all of Allied's loans are fixed rate.

Allied Capital deals in some fairly risky situations, but it does so in
situations where it has a level of compensation that balances out the higher
risk. The company does not expect perfection. In fact, there has been some
controversy surrounding its carrying value of an impaired loan made to
Velocidata, which led to questions about the company's valuing techniques for
less-transparent holdings. According to the company, they rate their portfolio
components from 1 to 5, with 1 being for companies in which a capital gain is
expected, 2 for ones performing as expected, on down to 5 where a loss of
principal is expected. At present, more than 90% of Allied Capital's portfolio
is rated 1 or 2. The recent controversy surrounding Allied's carrying values,
in no small part, has opened up an opportunity for you now: a lower stock price
on a long-term performer pushes the odds in your favor.

I like the dividend, I like the company's 17%+ return on equity from last year,
I like the fact that this is a company that practices disciplined pricing
first, followed by growth.

TA is a minor factor at best on this board; I mentioned the ACN formation as an

If your focus is short-term trading, you may do very well shorting stocks
mentioned here. The discussion here is about long-term value investing over
months or sometimes years. Often the good prospects are currently out of favor
and suffering in the bear market.

SI seems to break down pretty neatly between the traders and the investors.
There is plenty of room for both.

I do have to say that unlike some posters here, I like buying stocks that are
going up after already going up a lot - and I limit my bottomfishing and
"falling safe" plays to tiny slices of my portfolio.

ACN is a negligible part of my overall portfolio. You are right, it would have
been a good short breaking through support a few days ago.

The question for me is where it will be 2-3 months from now, or longer.

<<<TA is a minor factor at best on this board>>>

I've noticed that. There hasn't been much focus on FA lately either.

On trading vs. investing I've also noticed nearly everyone who posts here is
buying or selling something on nearly a daily basis. As close as I can tell,
the "long term investments" are those that are so far under water it will take
years to break even, if ever.

This is still one of my favorite threads on SI, but lately it seems like
everyone has thrown all the basics out the window. Instead of solid research,
the new strategy is to keep averaging into the latest falling knife to make
headline news.

I hate picking apart any particular stock mentioned on the board because it
tends to create hard feelings, even though that is never my intent. Usually I
just lurk and keep my opinions to myself. Or pick up a few puts if it looks
that bad. IMO, it should be a healthy exercise to pick some of these apart on a
regular basis. Virtually everyone who posts here on a regular basis has been
investing/trading for years and has spent considerable time studying the
market. It's kind of a shame to see this kind of information pool not realizing
more of it's potential.

I'll use ACN as an example. I took a quick look at it and this is what I saw: A
twenty dollar stock with a book value of .28, debt to equity of .63 to 1,
trailing twelve month losses of $1.14, earnings for the most recent quarter of
.02 and a chart pattern that looks like a reversal top. Pulling up the
"highlights" section of Market Guide, the pro forma earnings combined for the
last 2 1/2 years are $2.77. My view is if they are telling investors how
profitable they are, why is book only 28 cents? While I'm well aware of how the
market likes to discount certain types of losses, it isn't a practice I'm
impressed by. Where does the long term upside potential come from in a company
that is chewing up shareholder equity by leaps and bounds while playing make
believe with the numbers?

So, maybe it's time to get back to basics.

<<<my approach has produced a decent profit (around 10% YTD)>>>

I'm up over 300% this year, which would be real nifty if I hadn't gotten
clobbered good over the previous several years. There's something about getting
clobbered that makes certain lessons hard to forget. It also seems like every
time I've been clobbered, it was a direct result of breaking my own investing
rules. When I stick to what has worked most of the time in the past, I usually
do okay.

Negative growth is a bad investment. Too much debt is a bad investment. Not
enough cash or too much cash burn is a bad investment. Negative momentum is a
bad investment. Buying stock with the intention to keep averaging down is a bad
investment.

On the flip side, you can't lose money taking profits. There's always another
trade and missing out on one is not the end of the world. As a defensive play,
nothing beats holding cash. The best time to stop out of a bad trade is within
the first week. Good due diligence and a lot of patience will eliminate 99% of
the stops.

I also think it's important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of
being a private investor vs. a fund manager.

The disadvantages are a private investor doesn't have the time or staff
resources to do quality research on an unlimited number of companies. Spreads
and commissions chew up too large a percentage of investable cash to build a
hugely diversified portfolio. And a private investor isn't likely to have the
connections to create opinion where opinion doesn't already exist.

The major advantage to a private investor is the amount of flexibility to
respond to changing market conditions. I don't have to stick to any guidelines
as to what, how much or how long to invest. I can move relatively small amounts
of stock in and out of the market on short notice, and without being noticed. I
can spend any amount of time I wish to research a particular company's stock or
options. I can sit on cash indefinitely and wait for a trade to come to me
rather than having to go after a trade. I can over concentrate my portfolio in
a few issues when my targets show up and I can trade the market in both
directions.

For myself, I think it would be a mistake for me to study what the money
managers do and try to beat them at their own game. If all I was after is
slightly better than money market returns I think my interests would be better
served by placing my bet on a mutual fund and letting a money manager do what
he is paid to do. So, like the man said, what I'm looking for are "obscene
value plays". The only chance I have to beat the odds as a private investor are
to try to identify those issues where the down side is limited and the upside
is not. It's a lot easier to say than it is to do, but I think it's possible to
shade the odds in my favor by being ruthlessly selective about what positions
I'm willing to hold at any given time.

One that doesn't quite fit in with my own objectives, but might work for those
with a more diversified style is AMD. I was looking at it real hard last fall
when it briefly dipped below 8 and it's starting to tease around that level
again. If it retests support and holds, it might be worth a shot. I think
there's some value there, but I haven't been able to make up my mind if it's
obscene or not. Good luck all.

And I wasn't clobbered in previous years - so your 300% may just be regaining
ground you lost as a trader in recent years. My last losing year in the markets
was the mid-90's when I still let a broker mess up my accounts. I am up well
over 200% since then thanks to a fat year in 1999 and decent defensive play in
other years.

If you manage your portfolio for steady gains and avoid major losses, a steady
increase will outperform the boom-bust trading cycle in most cases. The
majority of traders I have seen go through periods where they lose significant
amounts of their capital. Most value investors do not.

Just ask Warren Buffett. If you weren't on a hot streak at the moment, I doubt

Paul,

<<<I don't understand if you are talking about investing or trading or both.>>>

To be honest, I'm not convinced there is a difference, and if there is, where
the line is drawn between the two.

I probably should have added an "IMO" type disclaimer on my last post. It
wasn't meant to be critical of other strategies, but more just to toss an extra
opinion into the mix since I had extra opinion handy to toss in.

<<<Your brief mention doesn't seem to be congruent with your previous post
wherein you seem to want to see evidence from others who post here of more

AMD is one I tend to spot check to see if I can figure out what it's doing.
Since I don't have a position in the stock, I probably don't think of it as a
"pick". Debt to equity is .4, which is at the maximum of what I'll consider for
my own investments. AMD tends to fall in sympathy to INTC profit warnings, but
it looks like at least some of the time INTC warns because AMD took away
another slice of their pie. They have plenty of cash and so far have managed to
avoid any accounting scandals. It's trading at a discount to book which "might"
be perceived as "value", or at least approaching that point. The only real
reason I mentioned it is because it's priced about where I'd start doing DD if
I had time to research a new position right now. Since I don't, maybe someone
else can do something with it. No recommendation either way other than I think
it's similar to what several of the folks on the thread like to at least look

<<<To generate a 300% return in one year, you have to take a risk profile that

Actually it was a combination of put options on a company I had been studying
for over two years, plus the fact I was almost all cash on September 11 and had
my pick of cheap stocks to look at. Money managers seem to like to do most of
their window dressing in the fall ahead of tax loss selling, so my focus at the
time was to go to the side lines and wait for a market bottom. Market news on
the economy was looking pretty grim, so it seemed like a good idea at the time.
I've noticed the market seems to go through some kind of "crisis" about every
12-18 months and the usual result is you can just about close your eyes and
pick something out of a hat for at least a double in the following 3 months.

Which is more risky? A diversified portfolio with total market exposure 365
days a year, or a portfolio that is all cash most of the year, except for heavy
concentrations of a few issues immediately after a major market event, then
back to cash? I realize it's an unorthodox approach, and I'm open to
discussion, but my theory is it involves less risk, and past experience has
told me it's what I should have been doing all along. I don't think it's
contrary to a value oriented strategy other than it adds cash to the definition
of value.

As far as the put options are concerned, you're welcome to read some of the
analysis I posted on the SEI board. Everyone knows options involve a high
degree of risk. And everyone knows they should NEVER have a high concentration
of options in their portfolio. In the past 6 years this is the only time I've
ever had more than 5% of my account in options. I suppose you could call it
dumb luck that after studying the company for several years I accidently bought
too many options at the right price and time to see a nice return on trades
that took place over a 4 month period. Risk is nothing more than a way to
calculate the degree of ignorance involved in predicting future events. The
higher the level of uncertainty, the higher the risk. If there's a point to any
of this, it's my belief that ignorance is a generally curable condition and
cash is a good investment at times when there is no cure.

Thanks for the links. I noticed the second article didn't mention any PTRN
products being used in Ford's planned vehicle though. So far my impression is
ethanol will end up being the alternative fuel of choice unless someone can
figure out a way to recharge an electric car in less than 5 minutes.

PTRN sounds like it might be an interesting one to watch, but I think I'd
rather see a believable road map to profitability and insider trading reflect a
higher confidence level.

Paul, re: ILA. I see it's dropped $5 or so since you posted you were adding
some, and it has now shown up on a screen of mine. Even with the bad news for
the whole sector, I am interested for the following reasons:

trades at a lower trailing PE and sales multiples than industry ave.
low book value (.47)
forward PE of only 4.7 and PEG of .42
yield of 9.8% (but the board hinted this week that may be lowered)
company announced plans to reduce costs and has identified $100 mil in savings
debt lower than industry average
5-yr EPS growth is faster than industry average

But then there's this from yesterday:

The company also announced that it had received an informal data request from
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding potential round-trip
trades of electricity and natural gas. Aquila has already responded to various
requests by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by stating that it
did not engage in round-trip trades and that all its trades were conducted for
legitimate business purposes. Moreover, the company has repeatedly stated that
its trading practices are proper and in full compliance with FERC regulations
and standards. None of its trades have been conducted for the purpose of
increasing volumes or revenues, impacting market prices, or for any other
improper business purposes.

Anyone have any input here? Is this a silly time to consider buying ILA?

-with a K, regarding ILA. I'd say an investment now in ILA would depend on what
one's goals were. I've been in for the dividend.

To me, a potential investment now is iffy, because management is suspect.

ILA are considering now altering their dividend amount, and that's dropped the
stock. From the annual report (2/28/02) though, they say, "We set the current
$1.20 annual dividend rate on our common stock four years ago. Each year since
then, our earnings available to common shares have increased. This has caused
the dividend payout ratio to decline to its present level of about 48 percent
of diluted earnings per share. The trend is likely to continue as we
concentrate on long-term earnings growth. We remain committed to paying the
dividend at the current level of $1.28."

Apparently these people have a different idea of the meaning of "commitment"
than I do. (Or else the outlook has changed so drastically in 4 months, that
the company is VERY desperate)

My reason for buying was that I want that dividend, and I want it maintained at
least. I don't expect the company to be a barn-burner, but I want the
steadiness provided by the dividend to offset some volatility in my portfolio.

The company says they're good guys, although they're being investigated by the
Feds. But now, after the notice they are looking at making a change to the
dividend, the leadership just does not provide me with a feeling that they're
credible with any of their pronouncements.

When a company grows sales a huge 43.7% annually (10-year avg.), but diluted
eps only 4.8%, book value only 5.6%, and market price (year-end) per share
grows only 2.9% (all 10-yr avg. figures), I say then I don't know why they
bother to pump up sales when benefits to stockholders don't seem to result. The
company - with its potential trading problems and governmental investigations -
does not seem to be in any better shape now with $40B in alleged sales, than it
was four or more years earlier when it was a 2 to 10B company. In other words,
I'd rather have the dividend in my pocket than give it up so these clowns can
muck up the business even further.

I'll hold my shares - for now - , but at current price ($10+), I'd not be a
buyer. If dividend is eliminated, stock could drop sharply. If div. is cut from
the current $1.20/sh to say .60 (a 6% yield on $10), that might stabilize the
stock at $10. If there's no change, the stock will recover quickly from today's
price. Almost a crapshoot for short term holders. Longer term - couple-three
years, maybe the stock will recover from lows. There's a real business in there
someplace, I am guessing. We'll see.

FR-d: you said -- "but I want the steadiness provided by the dividend to offset
some volatility in my portfolio."

I do not want to appear to be hyping a stock, but if you're interested... I've
been following and investigating preferred stocks for a year or so and
presently have around 15% of my stock mkt portfolio in preferred stocks (for
the reasons you cite). Most preferreds are trading at a premium to their call
price. Of course, premium or discount -- who cares -- as long as you factor it
in. I've seen quite a few of the preferreds which I follow be called a week or
so after the redemption date.

This one which is at a discount is FR - D shares.

http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=fr_pd+fr&d=c&k=c1&t=1y&a=v&p=s&l=on&z=m&q=l

Presently yielding 8.2% (at $24.3). The redemption date is 5/14/02 and the
redemption price is $25). That's another 2.7% in 8 months, which is worth 4+%
annualized if they redeem it on that date. So who knows the final yield? But
maybe 10-12%. And if they never call it -- 8.2%.

This is the company that was in Buffet's wallet when he sold it to raise money
for some charity a year or so ago. He has since exited the stock, but the
preferred is quite secure, in my view. And 10-12% secure yields are nice to add
to the portfolio. I happened to buy this one a short while back, under $24. I
suspect it will go up and approach the redemption value as time passes -- so
you can get the higher yield +/- whether they call it or not. (I'm guessing).

I think I may have convinced myself to buy some more -- if I can find something
I want to sell... :o)

enjoy,
grommit

PS to anyone -- let me know if you like this concept, and if it's appropriate
for the thread, because I sometimes feel like I'm writing to myself. I've
investigated most preferreds and know which are the pick of the litter. I think
I own 10 different ones right now.

Funny you mention preferreds now. I am just looking at my first one in eons.
Maybe since the markets have dropped and keep dropping, we are all looking for
some idea how to figure or reduce or limit the downside risk with our
investments... or maybe we're all just getting older and more conservative and
gravitating to this asset category -g-.
Possibly though, there's a lot more realization by everybody that 20%
year-over-year portfolio growth is too high an expectation, and even 10% may be
unreasonable. In which case, given the low bond yields we are seeing, high
dividend stocks that offer a priority in delivering a good dividend (like
preferreds), may be an attractive source for an investor's funds.

I don't recall ever owning a straight preferred, and I haven't owned a
convertible preferred in more than 20 years. The convertibles are often
mentioned as providing less volatility than common - one gets some of the
upside if the common moves up, and the dividend limits how much the preferred
drops if the company or common stock stumbles. I had found that "dividend
limits the downside" not to be so. When the companies I watched stumbled, the
preferreds fell just as significantly as the common. And they had their own
problems just being in that asset class "preferred".

In any case, I too am interested in what you might be looking at or have bought
as regards preferreds.

Thanks for your response and analysis, Paul. FWIW, I always appreciate your
honesty and straight-forwardness in your posts, which is one of the reasons I
frequent here.

You bring out some valid points, but in a bullish (naive?) response, one could
argue that the "informal data request" by the SEC is benign and the cloud will
soon lift. I am also encouraged by management's denials and actions, as opposed
to some of their energy brethren. Finally, James Stewart (of SmartMoney and

FR-d redemption.

I mistyped. The redemption date for fr-d is 2/04/03, 8 months from now, not
5/14/02. The rest of my yield calculation/speculation is correct as typed.

(The redemption date of 5/14/02 was for the fr-b which were called in by the
company. They announced that call-in on 4/11, if my notes are correct. They did
not waste any time in redeeming those shares, you'll notice.)

I limited my search for suitable preferreds to those with higher yields than
the sometimes available 6% +/-. I found a few in the 8-9% range and some in the
10% area. My investigation is pretty basic -- I look at the common stock and do
the usual sniffing around -- EPS, dividend coverage, insider activity, press
releases, sometimes I check S&P or moody's rating, etc. Of course, I don't care
how overpriced or underpriced their common shares are -- or maybe I do -- if
they are underpriced, I'd better see some insider buying, if overpriced, then
the insider selling is accepted as a sign of intelligence and common sense. And
I calculate the ROI based on the redemption of the shares and based on no
redemption. Of course, I need to understand and have confidence in their
business in general. I like real estate more than oil for example. And I like
apartments over retail malls. And I like REITs because they have a huge common
dividend that they can cut in order to make the preferred dividend payment, if
cash got tight. Banks and others might be OK, but I haven't found many high
yields there. If anyone has any better method, lemme know.

A few of my preferred preferred holdings are -- clp-c, ddr-c, nnn-a, cwn-a.

I haven't gone thru the whole list yet, and so I would appreciate a note if
anyone finds any nice yields which look well protected. And I haven't found a
screener which will do preferred shares.

Interesting value criteria column. Any reactions or comments would be
appreciated. Anybody follow this approach or something similar? (I sometimes
do, albeit haphazardly, but don't assign points.)

- Kris

Snip:

Piotroski's solution wasn't rocket science. He figured that the companies with
the best prospects might show some early signs of a turnaround. So he devised a
nine-point rating scale based on balance sheet analysis. First there's
profitability, which can earn a company up to four points: one point for
positive return on assets (a hurdle that eliminates almost half of all value
stocks), one for positive cash flow, one if return on assets improved during
the past year and one if cash flow exceeds reported income (a measure of
earnings strength). Then comes capital structure, three points: one if the
ratio of long-term debt to total assets declined over the past year, one if the
current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) improved and one
if the company didn't issue any more common stock. Finally, there are two
points for operating efficiency: one if gross margins improved over the past
year and another if asset turnover (revenue divided by total assets, a measure
of productivity) improved.

There's nothing magic here. Piotroski, who teaches balance sheet analysis, just
wanted to see if a few elementary accounting yardsticks would make value
investing more profitable. His results, published in the Journal of Accounting
Research, are compelling: The higher a value stock scores on Piotroski's
nine-point scale, the better it performs. Most important for investors,
one-year returns at companies with his top ratings (eights and nines) beat the
market by an average of 13 percentage points annually. As indicated earlier, my
numbers were even better when I tried Piotroski's approach last year.

OT Amusing article:
REMAINING U.S. CEOs MAKE A BREAK FOR IT--
Band of Roving Chief Executives Spotted Miles from Mexican Border
San Antonio, Texas(Rooters) Unwilling to wait for their eventual indictments,
the 10,000 remaining CEOs of public U.S. companies made a break for it
yesterday, heading for the Mexican border, plundering towns and villages along
the way, and writing the entire rampage off as a marketing expense.

"They came into my home, made me pay for my own TV, then double-booked the
revenues," said Rachel Sanchez of Las Cruces, just north of El Paso. "Right in
front of my daughters."

Calling themselves the CEOnistas, the chief executives were first spotted last
night along the Rio Grande River near Quemado, where they bought each of the
town's 320 residents by borrowing against pension fund gains. By late this
morning, the CEOnistas had arbitrarily inflated Quemado's population to 960,
and declared a 200 percent profit for the fiscal second quarter.

This morning, the outlaws bought the city of Waco, transferred its
underperforming areas to a private partnership, and sent a bill to California
for $4.5 billion.

Law enforcement officials and disgruntled shareholders riding posse were
noticeably frustrated.

"First of all, they're very hard to find because they always stand behind their
numbers, and the numbers keep shifting," said posse spokesman Dean Levitt. "And
every time we yell 'Stop in the name of the shareholders!', they refer us to
investor relations. I've been on the phone all damn morning."

"YOU'LL NEVER AUDIT ME ALIVE!"

The pursuers said they have had some success, however, by preying on a common
executive weakness. "Last night we caught about 24 of them by disguising one of
our female officers as a CNBC anchor," said U.S. Border Patrol spokesperson
Janet Lewis. "It was like moths to a flame."

Also, teams of agents have been using high-powered listening devices to scan
the plains for telltale sounds of the CEOnistas. "Most of the time we just hear
leaves rustling or cattle flicking their tails," said Lewis, "but occasionally
we'll pick up someone saying, 'I was totally out of the loop on that.'"

Among former and current CEOs apprehended with this method were Computer
Associates' Sanjay Kumar, Adelphia's John Rigas, Enron's Ken Lay, Joseph
Nacchio of Qwest, Joseph Berardino of Arthur Andersen, and every Global
Crossing CEO since 1997. ImClone Systems' Sam Waksal and Dennis Kozlowski of
Tyco were not allowed to join the CEOnistas as they have already been indicted.

So far, about 50 chief executives have been captured, including Martha Stewart,
who was detained south of El Paso where she had cut through a barbed-wire fence
at the Zaragosa border crossing off Highway 375.

"She would have gotten away, but she was stopping motorists to ask for marzipan
and food coloring so she could make edible snowman place settings, using the
cut pieces of wire for the arms," said Border Patrol officer Jennette Cushing.
"We put her in cell No. 7, because the morning sun really adds texture to the
stucco walls."

While some stragglers are believed to have successfully crossed into Mexico,
Cushing said the bulk of the CEOnistas have holed themselves up at the Alamo.

"No, not the fort, the car rental place at the airport," she said. "They're
rotating all the tires on the minivans and accounting for each change as a
sale.

Bob, I agree with your recent assessment on LTBG, and would add one more
intangible positive. Their new President, from IBM, presumably did some due
diligence of her own before giving up the benefits of a senior job at a big
company for a small one, including an option package probably based on the
price when she started 4/08, which was around $11.50.

Another plus is that I believe shortly your phone number will be portable
between carriers, like on regular long distance service. This will tend to
increase churn since you will be able to keep your number but get rid of a
carrier you do not like. A long term minus is that plans with zillions of
minutes tend to reduce churn, since you do not need to switch for a better
deal.

I do not yet own the stock, but may in October. A number of months ago I sold
equal amounts of uncovered puts at $10 and $7.50 strike prices, when the stock
was around the lows of $10 at the time. With this strategy, I will own stock at
an average cost in the low $7's, if is under $10 in October.

This is not risk free. However, in the low $7's I am paying very little for the
business. I think LTBG is about the best way to have exposure to this industry,
if you want any. I did not want any of the carriers because of debt and because
I am certain that the industry must consolidate, and did not want to take any
acquisition risk.

re: AHO and Dutch stocks. I've occasionally looked at AHO, and have passed each
time. I'm guessing they are very, very smart and strong competitors, with a
long term business outlook. They are the world's third-biggest retail and
supermarket group by sales, according to a Reuter's report I see. Because there
are so many on-going activities in the countries they operate in, I'm not able
to grasp possible major inflection points that might affect the stock, so I've
just limited my grocery chains to American based for now. (I'm not more
competent here, just more comfortable with the fewer variables.)

I figure if the "grocery" sector in the US improves, it will likely be with all
these firms' shares moving up (including AHO) to a greater or lesser extent.
And even if the American firms' stocks continue to languish or decline, it's
not clear to me that AHO will do any better considering the European and North
& South Amercian stock market malaise I believe I'm seeing. OTOH, it looks like
an investor buying AHO gets a reasonable dividend for being patient. (I've not
looked at the dividend policy or history to see if that dividend has been cut
before - as some European firms are sometimes quick to do.)

Regarding Dutch stocks, I know you've been buying some. Fwiw, I still own Akzo
Nobel (I like its pharmaceutical component), and I recently started a small
exploratory position in AEG. (I like its size, geographical diversity and good
dividend yield.) So here's wishing us gouda luck with our investments. (-g-)

Dale,

First, I never stated that ALD is "better" than MCGC.

Instead, I stated that I, too, was eyeing MCGC; however, I chose not to invest.

I don't understand the mentality of averaging down in broken stocks mired in
controversy and asserting that is a safer value strategy than buying stocks
with a steady up channel over time.

To each their own, but I should caution you. In this type of market, one day a
company is better than "sliced bread". The next day, its mentioned in the same
sentence as Enron.

My reasoning is simple on this one. I am reading that many VCs are hurting
right now b/c many of their portfolio companies may go bankrupt. Therefore, if
this is true, how can MCGC stay profitable when many VCs are worried?

MCGC is not a value stock as defined by Graham and Dodds. Instead, I view it as
a risky company.

Let me ask you this question in a different way. If I theoretically put my
money in the bank, I will receive 1-2%? Utility stocks are yielding
approximately 3-5%.

If MCGC is yielding 10%, one is taking on risk and alot of it with respect to
what the market is willing to pay with respect to Dividend yields.

Fine, Dave, I miscontrued the implication in your post. I don't buy the
argument that any company in the universe may turn out to be another Enron
tomorrow - it's a fashionable sentiment but it doesn't apply to the
overwhelming majority of stocks on reputable exchanges. It's a Chicken Little
argument.

You draw a straight equation between VC firms and MCGC because they both
finance other companies. Given there are probably thousands of VC firms and
partnerships in the US, it's another assertion that is so broad it is
meaningless.

Regardless, the issue is always where an investment firm puts its money. I have
a small MCGC stake because they invest in a slice of the economy (small media
firms) that I want to own right now. They are not so different from ALD in that
respect; if MCGC is not a value play then neither is any mezzanine-investment
play.

If your main concern is whether to step outside the 1-5% return world and take
on more risk, you should not own any stocks at all for the foreseeable future,
period. The risk level will be too high for you in almost any market.

However, your total returns over any longer period like 5- or 10-year
increments will be drastically lower than a careful investor in stocks. (I am
not talking about playing the indexes or large cap growth fund-type investing,
I am talking about careful value investing, so the bubble and crash since 1998
doesn't negate my point).

Good luck.

When consulting firms were mentioned, I chimed in with my recent ACN buy

My favorite value stocks sell at near or less than book value with solid assets

All's well that ends well, my friend.

Now for a word about stocks that definitely ARE NOT value plays:

Bottom Fishing in Techs
20-Jun-02 00:08 ET

[BRIEFING.COM - Robert J. Reid] So you want to go bottom fishing in technology.
You say to yourself: look how cheap these names are. If XYZ Corp is trading at
$4, it would need to go only to $8 for a double and $12 for a triple. That may
be true, but many of these names can go even lower when you consider their
still expensive valuations.

Busting the Myth
Growth companies rightfully command higher multiples than cyclicals. If you
were to normalize (smooth out for recessions and recoveries) growth rates for
cyclicals, the line would be fairly flat. That does not deserve much of a
premium.

Myth: Techs are pure growth companies and they are going to change the world
and they are just down right now and they're on their way back and just wait
until the Nasdaq comes roaring back. And, and, and.... .

Reality: These are not pure growth companies. There may be no such thing. Even
the purest growth companies have a degree of cyclicality to them. Stop pricing
them as if they are pure growth. You could make a good argument that most tech
names are more cyclical than growth.

New Paradigm
The degree of cyclicality in the tech world varies by industry. It's clear
semiconductors go through cycles as economic cycles fluctuate. Optical stocks
are probably less clear as as they lack the history of semis, for example.
Also, there have been so many startups popping up over the last few years that
it is more difficult to say for sure. Software companies have a degree of
cyclicality as enterprise IT spending ebbs and flows. Listen in on any
enterprise software conference call and this becomes clear. These same calls
2-3 years ago made it sound like IT spending would be robust for the next
decade, but they have slowed as the economy has slowed.

The purpose here is not to rank which tech sectors are more cyclical than
others. Nor is it to argue that they deserve the same multiples as true
cyclicals like General Motors, Deere, Burlington Northern, Exxon Mobil, UAL
Corp. The goal is to encourage readers to challenge the way they think about
many tech stocks. Many tech stocks still have high valuations. We argue that
some cyclicality needs to be priced in. Granted, optical stocks are not
railroad companies, but they are not so different as to justify the huge
disparities in valuations. Here are some examples of the growth / cyclical
disparity:

Technology
Company Ticker Stock Price Market Cap (bln) 2002E Sales (mln) Price/Sales 2002E
EPS Price/Earnings Year Ending
JDS Uniphase JDSU 2.77 $4.2 $943 4.5x (0.07) N/A June 03
Sun Micro SUNW 6.03 $19.6 $14,754 1.3x 0.18 33.5x June 03
Yahoo YHOO 16.02 $9.6 $898 10.7x 0.10 100+x Dec 02

True Cyclicals
Company Ticker Stock Price Market Cap (bln) 2002E Sales (bln) Price/Sales 2002E
EPS Price/Earnings Year Ending
General Motors GM 56.34 $31.6 $167 0.2x 5.83 9.7x Dec 02
Norfolk Southern NSC 22.11 $8.6 $6.3 1.4x 1.17 18.9x Dec 02
Wausau-Mosinee Paper WMO 11.60 $0.6 $0.9 0.7x 0.45 25.8x Dec 02

One More Thing
Be nervous about warning season, look at AMD. A rational person could have
concluded that all of the bad news had been factored into this chipmaker

First, Intel recently issued a fairly sizable warning. With AMD being its
largest competitor in the PC space, it did not take a brain surgeon to connect
the dots that AMD may be seeing similar conditions. As expected, the stock
traded lower back then. OK, bad news priced in.
Second, the valuation on AMD has been pretty beaten down. It has $1.3 bln in
cash/inv, or $3.72 per share. (Granted, its debt-to-equity ratio is up to 24%
from 16% at year-end, but still pretty cheap.) While the forward p/e was still
high at a 20x, it was trading at about 1x sales and 1x book value.You would
think that much of the bad news was priced in.
So what happens? AMD warns and the stock still gets hammered 16% even with
Intel, even with the valuation, even with the overall market in a slump. Our
point here is that maybe not all of the bad news is priced into techs and they
can trade to head-scratching levels. It was a similar story with Apple (AAPL
17.12) which traded down 15% after a warning.
Conclusion
It's tempting to go for these beaten down names, but do not be surprised to see
them go lower. Yes, they have more growth characteristics than the obvious
cyclicals. However, ask yourself is it that much better? Is Cisco ever getting
back to 40% growth? Probably not. But investors are paying 5x forward sales and
a forward p/e of 28x to find out.

EMC trades under $7, but it still has a market cap of $15 bln and a price/sales
ratio close to 3x. Sure, it'll post decent growth again, but just be sure
you're comfortable paying these multiples when you compare them to true
cyclicals. Our point here is not to be all out bearish on tech. There are
likely some names that will post great returns over the next year or so. We
just want readers to be cognizant of valuations and factor them into the buying
decisions.

regarding: "Why would ALD be a better bet than MCGC given the track record
since March?"

The time period you pick is an important factor. MCGC hasn't been a public
company long enough for it to qualify as a Ben Graham value stock. ALD, on the
other hand, has a strong record going back decades.

Regardless of the controversy surrounding it, ALD does qualify as an investment
operation, imo, because I believe it meets the criteria of "promising safety of
principle and an adequate return, after thorough analysis". That thorough
analysis can be seen and studied on the very good Yahoo thread. OTOH, it is
true that there are astute people who have concluded from their thorough
analyses that that the safety and dividend are not assured, so for them, the
stock is neither a Graham value nor a buy.

Imo, an important reason for considering MCGC as a value play (but not a Graham
value) is the implied long-term success of the management team in doing these
deals in business sectors they've specialized in. One hopes and assumes they
can be as successful on their own in their public company MCGC as they imply
that they were when they worked within large companies and could draw on the
support and resources of those firms.

GSPN is hitting my value screen. Global leader in DSL chipsets suffering from a
severe marketslump and trading at <0.5 of book and at a discount to its
cashposition of over 600M$. Forward cashburn seems limited vs cashposition.
There is still a lot of room for long term DSL growth with broadband adoption
growing at the consumer level and only a small percentage of all copperwire
DSL-ready.

Too early to call a bottom but there are some reasons to believe the stock
might find some support or at least a tradable bounce :

Mgmt announced a 100M$ buyback which might support the stock from here.
Rev warning didn't hit the stockprice very hard anymore after the drop during
the last weeks.
EOQ windowdressing also might have added to the recent drop.
Overall market sentiment is very bad.

Still might get cheaper though...and maybe safer to wait for a supporting

Almost defaulted on its working capital line but new financing put in place by

sale of company to Birks Jewerly was contemplated and terms offered extreme

MYR was founded in 1910 and operates nationwide approximately 40 stores (22
stores in Florida). Fiscal 2001 gross sales revenue was $163.7 million.
Operating loss was $80 million (ouch)! partly due to large goodwill writedown

This market sure is spooky. OT.

And with good reason. The CEOs and accountants seem to be operating without
fear of discovery of fraud. Totally amazing. As a former financial manager who
has once or twice had to refuse to play accounting games, I think the
prevalence of large stock options in the lap of the financial officer is a
conflict of interest. And nothing can be done from where I'm sitting.

It sure looks like the only defense is buying a WELL diversified portfolio of
companies with no blackmarks anywhere. They need to have a nice history of
earnings. And many investors are now leaning toward the notion that even
earnings can be risky, so they'd better put the earnings in your hand with a
nice dividend. It's hard to restate dividends already paid. I have been leaning
heavily toward companies with a real product, solid earnings, nice dividends,
reasonable executive compensation and insider buying. I am pleased (and lucky)
to report that I can view this market meltdown as an almost unaffected
observer. I made my move to safety with the idea of protection against the
economy cratering due to anything from consumer confidence to terrorist
activity, but those selection criteria seem to protect against accounting bozos
also.
