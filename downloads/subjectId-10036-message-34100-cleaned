 So then you wind up with idiot savants making huge bets with no common sense.
And the presidents of these companies having no real clue what these people do
or how they do it. (e.g. Robert Rubin of Citi who allegedly incouraged
risk-taking while later claiming no real knowledge or understanding of the
workings of the cmo's in his company.)

I think this is exactly how it happened. GS started the proprietary trading
boom and later the dumper kids on the block went along as well. I cannot
imagine that managers really understand those math models but they did
understand when they said, we are making such and such and our model says the
risk is only that high. SO they got their bonus and danced as long as the music
played (ex CEO Prince words).

Now the really question is why did and still do pay people so much to supervise
things they have no clue about? it must be as you earlier stated that they are
type "A" people that do just about anything to make money.

I am shifting some holdings to reduce my average cost basis and raising some
more cash since I believe there could be another buying opportunity soon.

I expect some selling into April 15 (Tax season) and then perhaps some type of
10% correction into May but who knows. I plan to have sufficient cash to nibble
at several of these beaten down stocks so I can establish some very low cost
positions.

I have had a few recent buys that I have held into rallies with over 30% gains
which round tripped on me. Better to book the profits now and try to re-enter
at lower levels.

I am also skeptical on the Treasury's stress tests which are to be released
shortly. There may be some surprises which could spook the market.

Finally, the housing sales numbers are grossly understated by the shadow
foreclosures banks still own. It's just going to take more time for the air to
come out of the bubble.

From the article"..."We believe there are in the neighborhood of 600,000
properties nationwide that banks have repossessed but not put on the market,"
said Rick Sharga, vice president of RealtyTrac, which compiles nationwide
statistics on foreclosures. "California probably represents 80,000 of those
homes. It could be disastrous if the banks suddenly flooded the market with
those distressed properties. You'd have further depreciation and carnage."...".

I think those restaurant stocks I mentioned a while back would have made a good

I did not have funds to invest but pointed out what I considered to be a
recession free industry. Look at Buffalo Wings. I cannot eat wings as I have a

recovering.

My favorite always has been MCD but I wonder whether Checkers has a viable

cars in line there. I love their dollar milk shake. I know it is lactose free
so I am safe.

CMG continues to fly. I know know know it is over valued but
it was in the forties at one time just recently. I eat out a lot so restaurants
are something I continue to do in this downturn. I wish I knew what symbol for
Outback as it is
a place I loved then grew to dislike but went back for a test run and they

Known for its fried appetizer the Bloomin’ Onion and its ostensibly Australian
d&#233;cor, Outback was taken private in 2007 at the peak of the private equity
buying binge, even as the casual dining sector was struggling with sluggish
sales. Outback’s owner, OSI Restaurant Partners, now finds itself saddled with
debt and declining customer counts.

“Because of all the debt they took on, there’s limited cash available to fix
the stores,” said Howard W. Penney, an analyst at Research Edge, in New Haven.
“The structure for the company is disastrous right now.”

In early March, the rating agency Moody’s included OSI Restaurant Partners on
its list of “bottom-rung” companies that are most likely to default on debt
payments. A company spokesman, Michael Fox, said the company had recently
significantly improved its financial position by retiring $300 million of debt
at a discounted cost of $85 million.

Hi Grommit - Nice job on staying with the REIT pref. I still have not loaded up

price around $8/share. I do not know if we will get another chance at the all
time lows but if the Bank Stress Tests are not up to market expectations, we
may get another buying opportunity for many of the beaten down stocks.

Wow, those REIT common stocks you listed are all up over 20% for the day!

I took a little off the table today for DU PONT E I DE NEM (NYSE: DD). This
stock has had a super run ( up 65% from it recent low of $16.05/share on
3/10/09!). I plan to buy back some shares before their next xdividend date
3/11) at prices between $23-$25. At $23.50/share it pays a 7% dividend.

I am looking to error on the conservative side and will play a bit of defense
until I see a summer rally.

BLACK HILLS CP (NYSE: BKH) is one Paul has been buying which I like. It has had
a very good run for a utility up 26% from its recent lows. I am looking to
start a position at $15-$17 which would yield 9% if they maintain their
dividend.

Good work on your YTD returns. I have not checked my YTD totals (I still may be

Interesting idea. Has some potential but I do have reservations that will hold
me back from taking a large position at this point. A smaller speculative
position might be in order.

Pros and Cons:

This stock sells at tangible book, so while not extremely under valued, its
priced OK.

They did 6 cents a share in recent Quarter and if I were to extrapolate that,
its 24 cents or a PE near 2.

Chinese micro caps under $1 can be subject to manipulation easily.

Chinese micro caps listed on the bulletin board have even more fraud risk.
Chinese accounting is always a question mark.

I note that the main competitors aren't exactly doing stellar. Chemtura already
filed Bankruptcy and ALB is moving with the market but well off its highs in
the mid 40's, has missed estimates the last 2 reported quarters, and analysts
project a 15% revenue decline this quarter.

All in all, not greatly excited but a small position should be OK. Just my
thoughts, and thanks for kicking out the idea.

RICHARDSON ELECTRONICS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2009 RESULTS AND DECLARES
CASH DIVIDEND

LaFox, IL, April 8, 2009: Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (NASDAQ: RELL) today
reported net sales for the third quarter ended February 28, 2009, of $110.3
million, a 20.6% decrease from net sales of $138.9 million for the third
quarter of fiscal 2008. The net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 was
$11.4 million, compared to a net loss of $2.2 million in the prior year. The
net loss of $11.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 includes $9.7
million of significant charges primarily due to the write-off of $5.8 million
of software development costs as a result of the decision that it would be too
costly and disruptive to proceed with the related system implementation.
Excluding the $9.7 million of significant charges, net loss would have been
$1.7 million. A complete reconciliation of these items is provided within this

A very bullish biased post from yahoo on wfc. I am also long wfc but not quite
as bullish:

" Regardless of your opinion over how the rest of the year goes, over what
write offs are left, over how much interest rates are helping what we learned
is this - and some of us already knew it (including the best investor of all
time with 60 years investing experience) -

Wells Fargo + Wachovia = tremendous earnings power.

It's always wise to be critical and cautious. There are a lot of questions the
answers of which will have bearing on this year's earnings. How much will there
be left to write off? How much lower might the commercial real estate business
go? What is left of the merger related expenses?

The long-range picture is much less cloudy though.

$20 billion in revenue and $9.2 billion in pre-provision profit in a quarter
smack in the middle of one of the worst recessions of the past century. There
will be ups/downs in the coming 2-5 quarters but when you look at the big
picture the combined earnings power of two top ten banks being run by one of
the best management teams in the business is going to be extraordinary. There
will be $5b/year in savings from merging the banks assets and employees and
improved cross-selling of Wachovia's customers. Plus less competition as other
banks have gone out of business or been bought out. We're looking at earnings
in the $5-6/share range in a few years growing at 10-15%/year for longer than a
decade.

This is as close to a guaranteed 10-bagger as there is.
You can still buy WFC cheaper than Warren Buffett paid in 1991 and you get
Wachovia too - and run by a more competent management team than previously.

The best investor of all time gave his opinion already.
"I would expect $40 billion a year pre-provision income. And under normal
conditions I would expect maybe 10 to $12 billion a year of losses … So, you
know, you get to very interesting figures." And he also bought stock in his
personal accoutn for the first time in decades. What did he buy? WFC at
$22/share. Why would he do that? WEB has made his living betting big when the
odds are overwhelmingly in this favor - as they are with WFC. We should do the
same. I put 15% of my entire portfolio in WFC at a little under $10/share. I
plan to stay in WFC for a decade or longer as it continues to grow and improve
its market share.

Go long, stay long - and don't "take profits" along the way. You should make
10x your money back within a decade - even with conservative growth figures. "

Barrons also came out with a positive article on WFC this week, and Cramer also
made positive comments. It wouldnt surprise me to see another quick 20% upward
move from these levels, I think a short squeeze here is very likely.

re WFC - there is little question that WFC can generate very strong profits.
However I am somewhat curious about how the generated such a strong profit.
They did take in a lot of iffy loans with the Wachovia acquisition (hence the
strong reserving) and I also wonder if they can hang on to all the Wachovia
customers as well. WFC's CD rates are very small while Wachovia was more
competitive, so i think quite a few deposits might go. On the asset side WFC
fairly large home equity book may not be adequately reserved since the
unemployment just exceeded 10% in CA (where WFC is big) and housing prices made
another leg down (more than 10% just in the last 2 month). I think they want to
push the stock up to issue more stock, that's just my guess.

Im sure that at some point they will want to raise more capital so they can

it before they release the actual Q1 numbers so I think its more likely that as
soon as they realized how far analysts estimates were off that they had to step
in and say something before the figures were finalized. I have no idea as to
whether wfc is adequately reserved or not and to what extent they can foist
toxic assets off on the government. I mean if I i understand this program
correctly the banks may well end up losing a very small amount on this stuff
and the government/taxpayer will end eating most of the losses. on the other
side they are going to make billions from the spread between rates. despite the
comments from analysts about how banks are reducing credit lines to consumers I
receive solicitations every other day for new credit cards, and checks that i

made. Even if the outcome of a fraud case would negative, it would be helpful
to show in much detail how the sausage was made. Court cases are good for that.
That could lead to either nobody wanting those sort of sausages any more or
better sausages in the future.

I had the same hope after the Y2002/2003 Enron/Worldcom disasters where rating
agencies played a role as well. Obviously more head on sticks are needed.

Negligence is not a crime under the First Amendment; only if you have an
actual, direct fiduciary responsibility to one party in a contract can you have
a liability for negligence.

And there is no collaboration for fraud if you can't prove BOTH actual
collusion and benefit from fraudulent transactions.

This is a case of the classic line, "Face it, you f***ed up, you trusted us!"
No other recourse out there under the law.

Maybe a former ratings agency employee will write a tell-all book one day.

Why wouldn't the ratings agencies have a legal obligation to the financial
institutions they provided the opinions to. If the financial institutions were
sued, why couldn't they 3rd party the ratings institutions. I have no expertise

Ratings agencies are legally classified as media outlets, no different than Jim
Cramer ranting every day on CNBC. They aren't registered investment advisors,
hence they have no fiduciary responsibility to anyone, now are they regulated
(unless they tried to start trading for themselves while they kept issuing
ratings, which would bring the SEC down on them pretty quickly - ).

no disrespect intended but if they are legally classified as media outlets,
could legal documents tying collateral, interest rates, and debt repayment
schedules to ratings by media outlets be legal enforced? I can tell you the
money center bank that employed me for seven years treated the rating agencies
as god like figures. We were told that we were not to review AAA rated credits,
as by definition there was no chance of default. of course this was in the 90s
and before the days of loan slicing and dicing.

It's no different than a library that refuses to carry any book that hasn't
been reviewed in the New York Times; the library's purchases are clearly linked
to NYT reviews, but the NYT isn't offering anything more than their opinion on
the books, good or bad, not a specific buy or sell recommendation.

That's why ratings agencies use terms like positive and negative instead of buy
and sell. They are simply guessing at future creditworthiness. What you do with
their guesses is your business.

I don't have a legal background but I remember when this question first came
up, I was shocked to find out the ratings agencies were not a regulated part of
the investment advisory world. It's a very stupid system.

Actually there is a case for negligence under the guise of free speech, which
is shouting fire in a crowded theater to stampede the patrons, or any extreme
act deliberately aimed at inciting panic that could lead to damage.

But that would be hard to prove here since the ratings agencies just used
sloppy work to facilitate a bubble. If they had pumped things up then suddenly
changed most of their ratings overnight (or vice versa) then plaintiffs and
prosecutors might look more closely at some kind of action.

Berkshire: Jurgis Bekepuris has summarized some of my reasons leading to my
negative opinion of BRKB:

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25428441&srchtxt=AAA

My current opinion remains: BRKB is not a value stock. Further, given the size
of the company, its stock's past five-year performance,

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=BRK-B&t=5y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=

and that there seemingly are so many undervalued stocks out there now, many
with high dividend yields (e.g. preferreds), it's difficult for me to see how
BRKA stock can move up to previous highs without also expecting and seeing that
these undervalued companies will also move higher - by multiples. Because so
many better opportunities in stocks seem to me to be available, I say BRKA is
an avoid or short. Of course, jmo.

Dale Baker has the best post I've seen regarding Berkshire now:

"In my 12 years watching BRK, there is always someone who thinks it is
undervalued by 30-40%. It's hard to put a clear value on such a diverse
operation, and whether the market will pay up for that perceived value is
always at issue.

In the last decade, BRKB was a buy under 2500 and a sell over 4000, FWIW."

From:Madharry
you and i disagree. perhaps you are much better than buying preferreds than I
am. also in my opnion all those people who put their money into hedge funds and
many other mutual funds would be better served buying shares in bershire
hathaway. showing a a chart of previous performance doesnt tell us much about
the companies prospects, in the meantime the company has presumably been
increasing both book value and annual cash flow. If you anticipate eventual
recovery of stocks and opportunities that WEB can take advantage of like 10% on
goldman sacks preferred + warrants, this is a good place to put money that one
doesnt want to speculate with or trade daily. I really believe that when all
this money that is sitting on the sidelines returns a big chunk is going into
berkshire hathaway.

an opposing view to yours can be found here:from doug kass who had been short
BRK but turned long recently:

My current estimate of Berkshire's investment portfolio value is now in the
neighborhood of about $73,000 a share, so I am paying less than 3.5 times
after-tax operating earnings for the non-investment assets of Berkshire
Hathaway.

If we triangulate Buffett's own view of intrinsic value of Berkshire (in the
letters to shareholders in the 1990s), the intrinsic value of today stands at
about $115,000 a share , or nearly 30% higher than its share price. And, as I
expect the world's stock markets to advance smartly from current levels (and
for financial stocks like Wells Fargo to lead the way), the value of the
company's investment portfolio and its intrinsic value will likely be much
higher by midyear. (This morning's $3 premarket rise in Wells Fargo's shares
equates to more than a $1 billion increase in value in Berkshire's investment
portfolio.)

Moody's move yesterday was classic in it's timing; the horse has already left
the barn.

BRKB. Okay we have differing views and outlooks.

And we're not going to change our minds here now about whether BRK is a buy or
not.

I'll comment on Kass's analysis though:

"My current estimate of Berkshire's investment portfolio value is now in the
neighborhood of about $73,000 a share."

This conclusion follows from no provided information. I wonder how many people
who buy BRK rely on other people to do the portfolio value analysis and tell
them it is a buy. I certainly can't figure BRK's "investment portfolio value".
I'm not even sure what that means. The current value of BRK's publicly traded
portfolio is $44.5B:

http://www.cnbc.com/id/22130601/

"If we triangulate Buffett's own view of intrinsic value of Berkshire..."
-------I have no understanding of what "triangulating a view" means, so I'm
unwilling to go along with Kass and just presume he's correct that the
intrinsic value is $115K/sh.

You are certainly right that betting against overvalued stocks can be futile. I

I do think the idea to bet on some earning disasters has value, in particular
