<<From what I've seen, it looks like it'll be a one quarter event>>For
companies that report on calender basis it'll be this quarter, but those with
other fiscal years may be hit at different times: The SAB defers the
implementation date of sab 101, revenue recognition in financial statements,
until no later than the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1999.[Earliest would be quarters beginning in Oct 2000 ending Dec
2000, latest quarters beginning December, 2001, ending Feburary 28, 2002.]
Some of the revenue recognition games have had the goal and effect of
'smoothing' earnings. To the extent that this is reduced earnings will jump
around more and so will prices. Regulation FD will exacerbate this in some
cases where the companies clam up and disclose all at once. This will produce
overreaction opportunities for value investors but it may also increase overall
risk premiums.

TwoBear, re. 3 buys, BAMM.

Yes, I'd rather just work with this year's ideas because it'll put us all - old
timers and new posters, on an equal footing. For me, it's not a matter of who's
got good ideas vs. who's ideas aren't so good, it's more about the number
three.
Since each person sees value differently - and some of us even quite
differently, my explanation or justification for the success of 3 buys has been
that if three different value investors look at a company and come to
independent conclusions that the stock is a buy and then so state that they've
bought, then there must (assumption!!) be enough value, enough margin of safety
so that the value is there from whatever corner you look at it. (It's just a
theory!)

When I did up my original tally, it seems, if I can recall correctly, that
there were only one or two companies that four or more people on the thread
said they were buying.(WHX was one, and perhaps it was also one of the Ag.
equip companies being another --fwiw, they worked out well imo.) But it was not
enough of a sample for me to be comfortable with (or for me to wait around to
get four people here to agree about -g-).

---------
I'm somewhat puzzled as to my own reaction to BAMM. If we've got 3 people here
saying it's a buy, then imo, it's a buy. And several more people here are
buying. Okay, but... we've now got a much higher number than 4 who are buying -
a higher number than I can recall for any other stock mentioned here in quite a
while. I'm just hoping on BAMM that we're not all feeding off each other and
maybe each other's enthusiasm, and just getting sucked into this thing. Or
maybe it's just that I'm suspicious that I myself am getting sucked deeper into
this thing than I ought to be (I've bought more).

Bob, your actions may suggest that not only do value investors only
infrequently agree on the same stocks to buy, but just as seldom perhaps, do
they agree on the point to sell. So it's going to be iffy to keep a thread
performance record for stocks when the buyers are getting out of their
positions at different times.

Nevertheless, an important point could be that you had 4 for 5 winners in being
one of the 3 or more who bought and posted on CMH, MAXS, SKO & VCLK.

Thanks Bob,

I was thinking along the lines of just the plot and hadn't considered it as
including services and products that haven't even reached the inventory stage.
Interesting concept. Buy up a vacant lot, sell boxes to live people without any
overhead for inventory, take the company public, and sit back and count the
money. Hmmmm....

One that caught my attention today was RDRT, which someone mentioned on the
board recently, when I saw it in the top 10 advancers on NASDAQ. I still think
it's a train wreck waiting to happen but I was curious enough to pull up the
10K. By the looks of things, their fiscal year falls into a crack where SAB 101
misses them by almost an extra year. As I remember from following DDs a few
years ago, there tends to be a lot of shipping out and taking back in the
industry, plus big write downs as an incentive to keep product already shipped.
It makes me a bit skeptical about their recent "surprise".

Another reason is that the portfolio will allow the many lurkers out there who

How about adding a cost basis upon the third buy (price at that time) just to

rhess, thanks for the kind words. Re EIX and related.

On the one hand, I saw the debacle coming, and I decided not to ride it out,
and so I exited my small EIX position.

On the other hand---dang! Maybe Jim Clarke is now proven way right in our
several discussions of bond insurers - (his) Ambac vs. (my) MBIA. I hate to
admit that -g-.

Both stocks have been winners now for anybody who bought when Jim and I were
buying or discussing them. I didn't buy ABK, and I don't want to go looking at
comparative charts now (and maybe make myself feel worse -g-), but I'll give
that ABK possibly has performed better than MBI -- I'm just going to count my
blessings here and say that I'm happy for my profit, happy for Jim's profit,
and I'm only sorry I didn't buy more MBI each time I averaged down or buy both
stocks instead of just MBI.

Here's the relevancy now: MBI has a big exposure to the EIX problem. ABK has
lesser exposure, plus its exposure is fully secured (if these are the correct
words). MBI's position is not fully collateralized: "only about two-thirds of
MBIA's exposure is secured by first mortgage debt, while Ambac's is 100 percent
secured by first mortgage liens."
MBI says that that is not a problem. I say, "Oh, really?". Seems to me ABK is
in a much safer position.
(I'm interpreting all this from news articles - I'm no expert - and I certainly
will defer to others who can speak more knowledgeably.)

Meanwhile, MBI has come down somewhat from highs. I am suspecting that as EIX
suffers, so it will cast a similar pall over MBI, thus dragging MBI down
further.
Reluctantly, I'm therefore selling most of my MBI that I worked to build up.

Perhaps there are or will be some opportunities in all this, such as starting a
position in ABK (I see ABK is down today also) and/or shorting (too risky for
value investors!!) MBI.

Shorted BBY again. This time @ 39 7/16. If the PC biz is punk - and despite a

of it's sales from "Home office' and 19% from 'Entertainment software' [Not all
of Home office is PC's - but a chunk is PC/PC related, and PC software is
probably less than half of 'entertainment software'] but PC stuff is probably
about 30 to 40% of of BBY's total.
Yes the Fed raised rates - but look at average lag time for rate cuts to turn
the economy - the more important message of the extent and timing of the cut is
that AG thinks the econ is in the dumpster - and that torpedo is headed into
BBY's numbers now.

If auto insurer MCY in California can sell for what it sells for, then there's

Well, okay, we're talking two different regulatory bodies. Maybe between CA and

business models of CGI and MCY, they are actually two different types of auto
insurers. Nevertheless, both companies are powerhouses (imo) in their

This is an open letter to the thread and I ask for comment from all who have
opinions.

This is likely to be a very long post, so please be forewarned!

I have "lurked" here for years, following the postings faithfully. At first, I
knew very little about the concepts. I had read much and since, have read much
more. I selected from the reading lists and recommendations posted here and
elsewhere, and endeavored to understand every concept on every page....which
for me, is sometimes no mean feat! I have occasionally posted here, I think the
most recent was quite a while ago regarding the thinking of cruise passengers
and how that related to CCL.

Finally, I have learned the only true way I have learned anything in this life,
I got hurt really badly....repeatedly. Suffering major financial setbacks in
the market.

I believe I have it in me to be a successful investor, and if it turns out that
one day I come to the decision that I just don't have what it takes, then I'll
move on to whatever else awaits. But until then, I must give it my best shot.

All of the above is sort of a "qualifying" introduction.

Now to the issues I'm facing:

Through no great feat of mental acuity, I have decided that since the market
has been in decline for quite a while, I might be able to find a few companies
which are selling at great prices. Those who have a built in margin of safety.

I will outline my evaluation process and ask you for insights and suggested
improvements.

First, I did a scan for all companies with a Price-to-Book(P/B) maximum of 1;
with a Return on Equity(ROE) of at least 10; Trailing Price to Earnings
ratio(P/E) of a max of 8; and finally, a forward P/E of a max of 10.

This came back with something like 100 companies....I chose to manually write
down the symbols(sort of a getting in touch with the earth kind of thing), and
as I did, I screened the list and eliminated all banks, finance companies,
mortgage companies and some others because they seemed to me to be "fad"
companies. This left me with a listing of 46 companies to research.

These companies I went through and weeded out all those who had poor current
ratios(current assets divided by current liabilities of less than 2) and those
whose net profit margin was less than 2%. I figured these companies would get
cheaper if the economy is slowing down and competition forced margins even
lower.

This winnowing process left me with 18 companies.

Then I went to the balance sheets.

I added current assets and cash together and subtracted from that total all
liabilities. I divided the answer by the number of shares outstanding. The
answer I got I am calling "Net current value", but it probably has been labeled
better somewhere and I would appreciate someone letting me know what it is.

Then I took the Property, plant and equipment asset value and added to it all
other remaining assets. I discounted that amount by 50% and divided the answer
by the number of shares and got what I call "Net hard value"....again, there's
probably a better name.

Some additional thinning occurred during this process which drove the list down
to 16 candidates.

I will continue this on the next post, as this one is getting a bit lengthy.

Then I went through the rest of the financials looking at many things like:
What was the pattern of revenue over the last 5 years, was it increasing for at
least 4 of them? I noted the net profit margin, interest rate coverage,
dividend pay-out ratio, book value(although I don't value this figure very
much), and listed the dividends of those who paid them and observed the
patterns there over the last 5 years.

Next I went and got the average daily trading volume and current price of the
stock as of Friday's close.

Then I added my derived figures for "Net Current Value" and "Net Hard Value"
and compared that sum to the current price and noted whether my value was a
discount or premium to the current price.

Having arrived....where and at what, I'm not sure....I'm uncertain as to what
might be the next step in the winnowing process.

Some questions:

1).What is the belief of the board regarding "Current Assets".....is this
number usually a solid enough figure that I wouldn't need to discount it in
this evaluation process?....I know that I can get better insight by reading the
10Ks, but in preliminary screening like this, I wanted to get down to those
companies worthy of spending the extra time first.

1a). Sort as a corolary to the above....I'm assuming that inventory is usually
considered a "current asset"....is this usually carried at cost? And should I
attempt to devise an adjustment to it for inventory turn-around
frequency?....or for quick sale value?

2). This is really stretching, but I don't know, so I'll ask: the "Other"
assets figure I lump in with PPE and discount them both 50%, is this a "fair"
treatment on my part of "Other" assets? The reason I discount PPE 50% is to
simply quantify the myriad issues (and their impact)regarding the liquidation
of property and equipment: sales commissions, sales time, uniqueness of use,
etc. I am assuming, for now, a relatively liquid and somewhat favorable market
for real estate.

I know that "Other" can mean virtually anything, I just wondered if anyone out
there has gotten a feel for this area and how to quickly account for it.

3).Now that I have arrived at a number that represents, to me, a close to rock
bottom value of a company, what do I do with it? I mean, should I try to factor
in "enterprise value" (which I haven't really gotten a good formula for). What
I guess I'm trying to ask here is: Having arrived at this number, is there a
further way to refine it so I can measure more clearly whether the current
price is a discount to fair value or a premium to it?

I hope I haven't been as confusing as I have sounded in my mind with this last
question!

I thank all of you in advance for your input.

My brief comment is that I think you have to look more carefully at PPE and
other assets. Recently built plants might be worth more than 50%, whereas
goodwill might be worth little - if, for example, it resulted from an
acquisition at peak of the market prices of a "goofy" tech company. I'd also be
wary of inventory which is an unusually high percentage of sales, especially in
any "trendy" business.

Thank you for your reply!

I agree that each situation has to be ultimately evaluated in and of its own
particulars. I'm just using this method to cull through a host of names to get
to those worth spending more time on.

Goodwill is always a tough issue for me to evaluate. On the one hand, one of
the definitions of "fair market value" for appraisers is "the most probable
price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all
conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and the seller, each acting
prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue
stimulus."

On the other hand, having been a mortgage broker, I know both the rigors of
appraisals and the abuses that sometimes occur when less adept appraisers are
intentionally used to support a pre-determined valuation need.

My point, though, is that a company did pay a premium to book value(or goodwill
would not exist in this context)and that price is also a factor in fair market
valuation. I usually don't have the familiarity with the data of any company to
know otherwise, so I think I must assume there is no less than 50% less value
in "goodwill" in a company that otherwise exhibits sound behavior.

I don't know whether it is the recency of the plant building or the uniqueness
of its design which would have the greater impact on marketability or, I guess
more to the point, the resale price it could command.

In any event, the companies in this listing have(percentage-wise) very little
"other" assets....was just looking for feedback like yours to help spur my lazy
brain cells.

Thanks again

Timba,

Just a few IMO type comments:

First there is NO substitute for reading the filings. Screens are a great way
to sort some of the wheat from the chaff, and checking Market Guide generated
profiles can be useful for a quick glance, but the stuff you really need to
know are in the filings. The main reason for using any kind of screen is to
narrow down which filings you want to study. If you've put as much effort into
studying the market as you claim, you should be able to spot "red flags" in
filings in a minimum amount of time. If "red flags" don't show up in the usual
places, keep reading to see if the company matches what you expected to find
with your screen.

One of the things that crossed my mind on your post is why a company trading at
book, with a PE under 10 have a debt/equity ratio of .5. If a company is really
generating that kind of net earnings, debt should be almost nonexistent. My
guess is that if you go back over your list, most of the companies on it don't
have any cash to speak of until the ratio starts to approach zero.

As a rule of thumb, I automatically eliminate any company with preferred stock
or convertible notes outstanding. I'll also generally avoid companies with
senior notes outstanding for anything other than VERY short term trades or
unless they have VERY high amounts of cash on the balance sheet. Good
management doesn't cut their common shareholders throats by leveraging assets
again and again while cutting out another level of equity holders each time.
Those type of companies are in business to sell stocks and bonds to the public
and any stated business purpose is just smoke and mirrors, as are often the
reported EPS numbers. "Related Party Transactions", insider trading, and
compensation are also good touch stones to get a feel for the quality of
management.

Cash flow not including borrowings or sales of securities is probably your best
indicator on how profitable a company is. EBITDA strikes me as a flawed way of
looking at a company. Interest is a fixed, recurring cost and so are taxes.
Depreciation and amortization, with the exception of goodwill write offs, are
also fixed costs on equipment or assets that eventually have to be replaced and
are an essential part of the business model. While goodwill is a nearly
worthless asset in a liquidation, in a company with positive earnings it's
worth a third of it's value in tax savings and "free flow cash".

In the same vein, PE can also be a misleading indicator. A company could report
zero earnings, write off $30 million in amortization of goodwill, and see $10
million in positive cash flow as a result. It's also important to understand
"Generally Accepted Accounting Principals" as they apply to a given sector.
Some sectors rarely trade above 10 times earnings for the simple reason that
GAAP skews the earnings picture. A "red flag" would be those places where what
a reasonable person would consider a normal operating expense is "capitalized"
as an asset and never reaches the bottom line. For example; energy companies
can be pretty bad in that area. You can just about figure book value to be
secured line of credit, plus cash, less unsecured debt.

Something else I also believe is worth looking at is management. Everyone in
the market knows management can make or break a company, but I doubt most
investors ever get around to looking at the DEF 14A filings to see what sort of
background is behind officers of the company. What kind of experience do they
have? Does their length of stay at other companies suggest loyalty, or do they
tend to bounce around in an opportunistic manner? Are they running a bunch of
little side businesses that would tend to divert their energy away from the
company? Pretend you are a personnel manager and ask yourself if you would hire
these people to run your company, because if you buy the stock, that's exactly
what you've done. Listening to conference calls are also a good way to get a
feel for company leadership.

Probably the hardest thing to judge is if a particular company or sector has
potential "sex appeal" to investors. Like it or not, the appreciation of a
company's stock is eventually going to depend on investor sentiment. A
company's fundamental value let's you know if it's a going concern, but
somewhere along the line there has to be something to push investor buy
buttons.

From reading some of your comments, you appear to have been in the market for
awhile and have spent considerable time finding out what works and what
doesn't. Perhaps most important is that you know how you react when an
investment goes with you or against you. For every loss I've taken, or profit
I've missed, there has usually been a place where I knew exactly what I needed
to do at a certain moment and didn't do it. That's also true for every profit
I've taken or loss I've avoided. I'm a firm believer in doing the research and
reading the filings, but the best system of research in the world won't teach
you when to pull the trigger. Some events are impossible to predict, but there
are always ways to improve your position, cut losses or take profits when
something happens you don't expect. Last weeks rate cut would be a good
example. Reading the news items on the NASDAQ site, it looks like a bunch of
folks at Reuters are eating sour grapes because they got caught with their
shorts around their ankles. The moral of the story is that even those with
access to worldwide news services to hype their opinions can't predict when the
market will bounce 14%. You can bet they're hedging their bets as a result of
the new information though.

DISCLAIMER: All of the above is my opinion and is subject to change without
notice. In my opinion, opinions should be viewed for entertainment purposes
only and not treated as investment advice.

Thanks Don for such an detailed post!

First there is NO substitute for reading the filings
I couldn't agree more with that statement and that paragraph.

If a company is really generating that kind of net earnings, debt should be
almost nonexistent.
Actually, that's exactly right....most of these companies have very little to
no debt....I just used the .5 debt ratio to screen out the worst of the
offenders....sometimes heavy debt can be justified in the capital intensive
enterprises....CCL comes to mind, it takes 400+ million to build a new ship, so
they borrow the money and pay it off when the ship is operational.

You make an interesting point about long-term structured debt like preferred
and convertibles....I'll have to mull over that for a while....I mean I see
your objection to the dilution of common shareholder rights that happens here,
but the leveraging of assets isn't always bad for the shareholder.....

Cash flow not including borrowings or sales of securities is probably your best
indicator on how profitable a company is.
Again, you're absolutely right....in fact, I think you've given me the next
step in the process....determine Free cash flow....Thank you!

I never thought to look at the Def14A as a management evaluation tool, I'll
check that out.

I, too, don't think much of P/E, BV, or PEG as evaluative tools. I mean if I
see a company has a P/E of 800, chances are I won't spend too much time looking
further, but otherwise, these are too "slippery" for me to have any security.

Probably the hardest thing to judge is if a particular company or sector has
potential "sex appeal" to investors.
Well, I guess that depends on my investing objective and time frame. This batch
is for a potentially long term holding. Over the long term, quality net nets
will provide decent returns if purchased at a good price. Some of them will
develop that "sex appeal" maybe, and provide outsized returns.

Yes, discipline is the key to maximizing returns and exercising good money
management practices. I am learning, I am learning.

Thanks for your list. I still have WAKB, discussed here last year, and I see at
least one other owned by others on the thread.
------------------------
I don't want to let statements that I find to be motherhood go unchallenged.
That would be "there's no substitute for reading the filings".

I usually find that if I have to go read the filings, then the stock is too
controversial or too "sophisticated" to be a good investment. Or that the
filings will cause me to become overly concerned about potential issues facing
the company. Rather than read through the filings on every stock I'm interested
in, I find I am better served by reading what the insiders are actually doing -
instead of what they are saying.
Ben Graham methods do not require file readings. Maybe they weren't readily
accessible in his day, and maybe he would favor it now, but there's no evidence
that reading and studying the filings is in any way a necessary requirement for
value investing.

Thanks again for the list; some interesting stocks there. While I do not know
anyone else's objectives/goals/financial position, my opinion would be that no
matter how well stocks chosen from that list turn out (and they may be
excellent investments), the fact they they all are similar (screen survivors)
and mostly all very small cap, this indicates to me that anyone who builds a
portfolio solely of such stocks takes on added risk that such a concentrated
portfolio entails.

....this indicates to me that anyone who builds a portfolio solely of such

Well, Paul, I appreciate the heads up on this, but I don't think I'll be
building a portfolio solely of these issues. I, too, observed their small cap
nature and their extremely low trading volume which means illiquidity. I didn't
want to focus on any specific company which is why I didn't print the list
originally. Rather, I want to get my thinking and analysing techniques more
refined for this type of stock selection, if using a company or two for the
purpose of examples is helpful, then I'm all for it.

I have other criteria that I use to build other portfolios, but a discussion of
them would not be appropriate here. I have seen some attempts at that here in
the past get roundly criticized and feel no need to bring the house down on
myself for being off-topic.

I can see your point about the potential for getting lost in the issues, rather
than focusing on the performance data, but still, in the context as I read it,
reading the filings was to used as a clarifying tool for issues like: What is
included in "Other" assets, "Other" liabilities, and whatever hints of business
direction and outlook may be gleaned from "Managements Discussion."

Rather than read through the filings on every stock I'm interested in, I find I
am better served by reading what the insiders are actually doing - instead of
what they are saying.
Are you referring to insider stock transactions only, or do you have some other
source also in mind?

Regarding WAKB, although my calculations have it at around a 32% discount to
liquidation value as I calculate it(the lions share of the valuation coming
from the "Net Hard Value" of the equation due to large "Intangible" and "Other"
assets, which I haven't researched the filing on), I am concerned by their .8%
net profit margin in a slowing economy. They reduced their dividend from .29 in
'98 to .15 in '99 and I wonder how long they can pay at all if competition
heats up, as it's sure to do in a tightening economy.

that is one terrific post. thank you. A couple of caveats though. I would say
that sometimes seeing a preferred issuance means that at somepoint in time the
company has had a major shortage of cash. it could also mean an opportunity.
especially if the company is in the technology business. FYI Most major banks
have preferred issues outstanding.
Usually companies are cheap by historical standards for a reason. Assets are
only worth something if they can generate future earnings. if a company has a
product that has become useless, the assets used to produce the product are
generally useless. earnings reflect what has happened in the past not the
future. There may also be some threatening litigation- see the asbestos
companies. Lastly management may be particularly unfriendly to shareholders.
For example most people who have invested in shares in companies controlled by
Icahn, Pearlman, Trump have fared poorly, although at times the shares have
looked like bargains.

Finally, as one who has suffered from this form of myopia.
shares in other companies valuation is too often in the eye of the beholder and
have been volatile. What has looked like a huge margin of safety in a stock has
evaporated when the price of a major holding has tumbled by 50-80%.

TimbaBear, re: WAKB. Possible we both could be right on WAKB (or that I could
be wrong). I say that WAKB's okay for me for an investment. I'm not looking for
an absolute margin of safety that might be provided by buying the stock below
its liquidation value. (My margin of safety is augmented somewhat by having
this stock within a diversified portfolio.) Nor am I comfortable even
calculating its liquidation value. I do calculate fair valuation of WAKB though
at about $14+ based on its book value, ROE, a capitalization rate, and sales
growth. (Stock's now about 8 11/16). $14+ might be a reasonable and doable
price -- the stock's been above 15 for the years '96-99, but not this year.

Holding the stock back imo are the poor margins (they've been low historically)
going into a difficult economy (as you point out), and possible readjustment of
current and prior earnings due to SEC rule changes. Elimination of dividend
also is a big negative, imho. Maybe the biggest negative is the mishmash of
stock types - WAKB, WAK, WHC. In 2001, perhaps we'll see potential investors
avoid WAKB because of a concern there might be less outsourcing of the
prison/corrections business given the escape of the Texas 7 in a facility
controlled by the public sector. Plus the uncertainty of a new President and
Congress regarding health care (for the hospital management business).

Factors that could propel the stock are the continuing good growth (new
contract wins, add-on contracts, extended contracts), and the management skills
under the Wackenhut family. (I am assuming their egos and reputations as well
as their name are on the line.)

For me, I am trying to focus on the value that I believe I see. An historically
low price/sales ratio (at a time when sales are still growing)-- and it may be
absolutely low at .05, a relatively low price to stated book value which itself
is growing, not too much long term debt, not too bad a price to earnings.

WAKB has provided guidance that they expect 2000 year's earnings to be $1.19 to
$1.28. Last year, I was expecting better numbers than we will see here, so I'm
disappointed. Nevertheless, imo, if the performance remains at the $1.28 level,
I can foresee (or fool myself -g-) into believing that a price of $14-15 is not
unreasonable for this stock, if one can be patient to wait for it.

Paul Senior
There! My take on WAKB without reading any of the SEC filings -g-.

VOXX is a great example of recent discussions. The Yahoo profile shows book at
$14.92. Unfortunately for those who don't read SEC filings, there's an
additional 2,260,954 shares of convertible stock not factored into per share
numbers. Book is actually $9.60 per share using the company's "estimate" of
asset values. Earnings are also affected by the convertible shares to the tune
of .04 per quarter and the PE numbers do not take into consideration the
frequent "one time charges" for inventory write downs. If inventory has to be
written down twice a year it is NOT an "extrodinary item". It's a part of
normal operations. Convertible stock and recurring "one time charges" makes the
PE of 6 look closer to 12. A careful reading of filings gives a good example of
a company whose primary business is selling stock and other securities. The
chart gives a good example of what happens when a ton of debentures are
converted in to stock and hit the open market along with issuing additional
stock. I'd rather pet a rattlesnake than buy into that kind of downtrend.

It also happens to be one of those few companies which get an extra year before
SAB 101 takes effect due to their fiscal year not matching the calendar year.

Is Audiovox a bad company? I hardly think so. It's a brand most people should
recognize without thinking too hard. At the same time they are highly exposed
to the economy, declining sales of autos, and the yen. Their reported earnings
and assets are also highly subject to GAAP spin. For a company with over a
billion a year in sales to be unable to generate positive free flow cash
without issuing stock and debt strikes me as unforgivable.

There IS a reason I believe reading the filings is a critical part of not only
value investing, but investing period. There are too many times when those who
have read the filings are only too happy to sell their stock to those who
haven't.

"as an investment vehicle, the convert is also interesting"

Since 1 share of class B convertible can be traded in for 1 share of class A
common, it's virtually identical to the class A. The only advantage to issuing
it at all is it's asset and EPS spin value. It makes for a dirty balance sheet
in a company that already uses too many tricks to pad the numbers. For a quick
acid test, check how many shares the CFO owns in the company.

Hi Don!

I would not buy Audiovox at this time, so please don't take my comments as an
attempt at anything other than a discourse on some of the pros and cons of this
stock.

Unfortunately for those who don't read SEC filings, there's an additional
2,260,954 shares of convertible stock not factored into per share numbers

Actually, the 10Q for the period ended 5/00(the most recent I found on EDGAR)
shows 20,262,558 common "A" and 2,260,954 common "B" for a total of
22,523,512.....Yahoo shows total shares at 22.6 million.

....the PE numbers do not take into consideration the frequent "one time
charges" for inventory write downs. If inventory has to be written down twice a
year it is NOT an "extrodinary item". It's a part of normal operations....

According to the most recent 10K, they wrote inventory down 11.8 million in
1995 and had another write-down of 6.6 million in 1998. The one in 1998 it
appears was the result of the "Asian Flu"(my supposition, not their
statement)and it's impact on prices due to Asian companies deeply discounting
goods to export their way out of their financial crises. Given the rapidity of
miniaturization of semiconductors and integrated circuits over the last 5
years, I'm surprised that there isn't more of this type of write down....Even
with "just in time" ordering, I suspect the write downs still might increase in
an economic slowdown as companies producing for a vastly greater order flow
suddenly find themselves with cancelled orders and now inventory on hand (that
has a rapid obsolesence factor) that they can't move due to demand drying up.

The write-down in 1995 I haven't researched.

A careful reading of filings gives a good example of a company whose primary
business is selling stock and other securities

I came to a different conclusion. Their sales of merchandise have exploded in
the last two years. And from 1996-1999 they converted $63 million of $65
million 6 1/4% convertable debentures into 9.7 million shares of stock.....but
the net effect of that was the elimination of debt, not the creation of it.

Also, they borrowed $93 million in 1999 to finance their rapid sales increases,
but apparently have paid back $67 million in the first two quarters of 2000.

Toshiba bought a 5% stake in one of their subsidiaries, which resulted in an
increase in outstanding shares in 1999, but that is somewhat common practice.

Is Audiovox a bad company? I hardly think so. It's a brand most people should
recognize without thinking too hard. At the same time they are highly exposed
to the economy, declining sales of autos, and the yen.

I definitely agree that they are highly exposed to the economy. The trend that
most concerns me right now with them, and why I am not yet buying, is the rapid
rise in receivables to levels that are astronomical when compared to a few
years ago. With this kind of increase, a company must have sound credit issuing
guidelines and collection practices and the experienced personnel to implement
them. Audiovox may have these, but since I don't know, this adds a measure of
risk that is not quantifiable for me at this time.

A review of their cash flows indicates that their flows have been severely
impacted by this rise in receivables; both on the 10K and the most recent 10Q.
If these receivables are indeed largely collected, then the positive impact on
cash flows will probably make this stock price take off.

They also have a huge rise in inventories as a result of their explosive sales
growth. Have they learned from the previous lessons, or is there another
write-off coming down the road?

If I could get a handle on the answers to these two issues, I would have an
easier time making the decision to purchase or pass.

Terrapin, thanks for pointing out the Barron's article. I had missed it.

I've had SBLU (the old SII) a while - have ridden it up and now down. It's
undervalued now imo, so I will not be selling.

The Barron's article mentions several of these beat up stocks. Imo, unless
somebody is one terrific analyst regarding a particular company and technology,
the stocks ought to be owned as a package deal. (Which is not the same as
saying they all should be bought right now.)

In owning a package, I am assuming that this enables one to minimize risk yet
make a decent overall profit, as opposed to taking on more risk by betting on
just one of these companies for a larger potential gain.

I have, from the Barrons' list, NSI, EFII, CS, BMCS and ADPT in addition to
SBLI. These have all been discussed before on the Value Thread; I figure
there's at least one other poster here who has NSI or EFII or BMCS bought at
the time of discussion when prices were lower than now (if I recall correctly).

I have COMS on my watch list. (Had sold COMS and PALM in the spin-out play)
Nice move on your part to pick COMS up below cash. I hesitated too long; now
I'm waiting for a second chance.

I don't know Viant. I look at Novell every once in a while, and I always wind
up passing on it. (And so far, I consider myself lucky about skipping it.) I'm
still smarting from '96-'97 disk drives and SEG in '00, so I've skipped Maxtor
(a lousy reason-- I'll have to go back and look at it.) I have AAPL, Mike
Burry's successful pick of a couple of years ago, also on my watch list. Same
problem for me with AAPL as every other time -- I cannot make up my mind about
it -- I'm waiting now to see if it drops to lows to see if it tempts me then.

DCLK --- aaii carumba -- Some of us - I'm not the only one! - missed a good
recommendation by Twister mid Oct. But now DCLK is back down near lows. Maybe
we can get Twister to give us an updated DCLK opinion at this point???

Don: Excellent post. I generally do it in layers - yahoo profile, market guide
quarterlies - always checking AR and inventory vs sales growth as well as FCF.
I also look at insider activity and what funds own it - ownership by top
performing value shops is a big positive since these guys not only do good
investigation, but they get interviewed. If a stock has big short position -
that's a red flag. While there may be a squeeze, it's usually more important to
understand why the shorts hate it.
Then I look at the filings to fill in the blanks or find other red flags.

Timba and all,

I don't want to get too carried away with discussing VOXX since while I don't
think it would be a terrible investment for someone else, it doesn't fit the
kind of profile I usually look for. On your comment about AR, it looks like
they had a large prepayment that got shuffled around as unearned revenue and
the amount was added to AR even though it's already been paid. Things that can
be done, and are done, with GAAP never cease to amaze me. Actually, days sales
outstanding was one of the few things that impressed me with VOXX. It looks
like it usually runs at around a month. My only real objection, and for me it's
a big one, is the way they spin their numbers, plus cash flow seems to come
mainly from selling stock or debt. If I see a company spin the numbers even a
little bit, in my mind it casts doubt on virtually everything else on the
balance sheet. There are so many companies with very clean balance sheets to
pick from, that I don't waste much time looking at those that play games with
the numbers.

My focus is normally on potential turnaround situations where a company has a
clean balance sheet, with little debt and strong cash positions. The time I
broke that rule, the company went Chapter 11 and it pretty much cured me of
looking at book value where cash isn't a large part of assets. It also caused
me to look a little harder at management. If they're crooked and the only cash
laying around is yours, they'll figure out a way to get it. My theory is that a
company with lots of cash can weather a temporary downturn in their industry
and stage a comeback when conditions improve. Especially if they don't have a
lot of debt to service. I also believe if management has fairly substantial
positions in the company, they can't cheat shareholders without shooting
themselves in the foot.

Like Bob recently mentioned, there's usually a reason the price of a stock is
down. The trick is deciding if the reason is good, bad, overdone, temporary, or
permanent. IMO, one of the best places to look for value is where an entire
sector has been hammered to death on negative sentiment. Perfectly good
companies get clobbered along with the bad ones, and it usually isn't that hard
to figure out which is which. I also think it's a lot easier to get a feel for
the quality of management when things are bad than when things are good. When
market conditions are perfect, a chimp could run the average company
successfully and no one would know the difference.

This is kind of off the topic, but I was cleaning out my bookmarks and ran
across this item. http://www.geocities.com/sputnick55/OTC.html I figure I may

Don and others:

On your comment about AR, it looks like they had a large prepayment that got
shuffled around as unearned revenue and the amount was added to AR even though
it's already been paid.

I, too, don't want to get too caught in VOXX since I don't want to own it
yet(if ever) however, your comments sent me back to the 10K, as maybe I
overlooked something major, possibly indicating accounting incompetence or
worse, which I need to know I overlooked, if I did, as the recognition of those
kind of improprieties can be costly to me as you so eloquently stated.

I didn't, however, find what you were referring to. If you would be so kind as
to point out where in the 10K you are seeing the "large prepayment" getting
bounced around, I surely would appreciate it.

I did, however, find this note to the balance sheet:
Included in accounts receivable at November 30, 1998 and 1999 are trade
receivables due from its equity investments aggregating $1,035 and $1,057,
respectively. Receivable from vendor includes $833 and $3,741 due from TALK as
of November 30, 1998 and 1999, respectively, which represents prepayments on
product shipments and interest. Interest is payable in monthly installments at
6.5% on amounts due from TALK. Amounts representing prepayments of $3,500 were
repaid via receipt of product shipments in December 1999. 

TALK is a subsidiary(partially owned, I think)and what I think VOXX does, is
they prepay an amount on orders for goods from TALK. VOXX charges 6.5% interest
on the amounts prepaid to TALK. Evidently VOXX has a category in their
accounting that is "Receivables from vendor" in which they list the amounts
prepaid for goods and the interest accrued to this category until they receive
shipment of those goods and payment of the interest. Throughout their
financials, as nearly as I can tell, this is always the context they mean when
they use the word "prepayment"

Whether the interest on this prepaid amount should be included in Accounts
Receivable is kind of "iffy" in my mind. On the one hand, it seems like an
investment return entry would be more appropriate, on the other hand, if they
pay interest on their payables should they break that out separately as a
financing activity? I think, as long as the interest amounts are relatively
insignificant, so is the issue for me.

The issue does bring up a good point though....how much of their receivables
are due to product prepayments and how much actually due to the sale of
merchandise?....If I were more interested, I think I would try to quantify
that, because receivables from vendors in which VOXX has an ownership stake are
less worrisome in some respects than receivables from enterprises over they
have no real control.

As far as cash flow seems to come mainly from selling stock or debt....I think
I'll just have to agree to disagree with you on that one for reasons previously
stated.

The notes on the increase in AR are in the most recent 10Q and the cash used to
pay down debt came from a secondary offering of 2+ million shares of stock at

The notes on the receivables on the recent 10Q are:
The Company's cash position at May 31, 2000 increased $17,777 from the November
30, 1999 level. Operating activities used $20,287, primarily from increases in
inventory of $56,507 and decreases in accounts payable of $4,009, partially
offset by a decrease of $35,076 in accounts receivable. Accounts receivable
days on hand decreased to 50 days at May 31, 2000 from 51 days at May 31, 1999.
Inventory days on hand increased from 30 days last year to 54 days this year.
The increase in inventory value and days on hand was primarily in the Wireless
Group. Investing activities provided $5,484, primarily from the sale of
investment securities, partially offset by the purchase of property, plant and
equipment. Financing activities provided $32,611, primarily from the proceeds
of the follow-on offering offset by repayments on the line of credit agreement.
In addition, financing activities were further offset by the payment of a
dividend of $859 to Toshiba Corporation, a 5% shareholder of Audiovox
Communications Corp..

And I still don't see the switching around you alluded to.

The note referring to the sale of the stock is:
In February 2000, the Company completed a follow on offering of 3,565,000 Class
A common shares at a price to the public of $45.00 per share. Of the 3,565,000
shares sold, the Company offered 2,300,000 shares and 1,265,000 shares were
offered by selling shareholders. Audiovox received approximately $96,623 after
deducting expenses. The Company used these net proceeds to repay a portion of
amounts outstanding under their revolving credit facility, any portion of which
can be reborrowed at any time.

Now selling stock and using the proceeds to pay down debt is not an
irresponsible move. Especially when you sell the stock at the price they did.
If they now buy back that same stock for its current market price, it has all
the earmarks of a sound move. Please see this news:
http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/001213/ny_audiovo.html

The press releases you refer to are:

http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/tech/telecom/1164812.html

Marking down inventory that is less profitable and has become obsolete because
you are concentrating on a higher volume product line is not necessarily evil
intent.

The same 10Q you referred me to as well as the press releases show that sales
have increased $269,455,000 to $761,790,000....when you stack that against the
96 million they received from the stock offering, it is apparent at least to
me, that they are not primarily in the business of selling stock.

By rebutting some of your arguments, please don't feel that I am saying your
hunches about the investment risk of this company are anything but right on,
your intuition here may very well be proven to be prophetic. All I'm saying is
that I don't find the support for the arguments you make solely in the
submitted financials.

Books-A-Million, Inc. Reports Lower Holiday Store Sales
Expects Decline in Fourth Fiscal Quarter Earnings
BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 9, 2001--Books-A-Million, Inc.
(Nasdaq/NM:BAMM - news) today announced that sales for the nine-week period
ended December 30, 2000, totaled $102.3 million compared with $106.0 million
for the same period in fiscal 2000, a decrease of 3.5%. Comparable store sales
for the same nine-week period decreased 9.1%. Excluding the sales of Pokemon
collectibles, comparable store sales decreased 2.3%.

For the first eleven months of fiscal 2001, sales increased 1.9% to $379.1
million from $372.2 million in the year-earlier period. Comparable store sales
for the first eleven months of fiscal 2001 decreased 2.6%. The final results
for the year ending February 3, 2001, will be released as scheduled in
mid-March.

Commenting on the results, Clyde B. Anderson, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, said, ``We were comparing against a very strong holiday season last
year which was driven by a number of factors, including the Pokemon craze, the
turn of the Millennium and a very strong economy. This season saw no equivalent
trends develop, and sales were below last year as a result. Management expects
that comparable store comparisons will continue to be adversely affected by the
Pokemon collectibles sales through the second quarter of fiscal 2002.''

Anderson continued, ``We are encouraged, however, by the general strength of
the core book business and the continued growth of our e-commerce businesses.
We estimate that net income for the fourth quarter will be approximately $0.27
to $0.30 per diluted share compared with $0.36 per diluted share for the same
period last year. Despite the downturn in earnings for the quarter, our balance
sheet continues to reflect the Company's overall financial strength.''

Books-A-Million is one of the nation's leading book retailers and sells on the
Internet at www.booksamillion.com. The company presently operates 188 stores in
17 states. The Company operates four distinct store formats, including large

Timba,

From form 10Q filed 10/16/00:

(12) Unearned Revenue

During the quarter ended August 31, 2000, the Company received $43,874
from a customer representing prepayments for future product shipments.
The prepayment has been recorded as unearned revenue and is included in
accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2000. The Company will
recognize the revenue as product shipments are made.

For the nine months ended August 31, 2000, the Company exercised its
option to convert Shintom debentures into shares of Shintom common stock. The
Company then sold the Shintom common stock, yielding net proceeds of $12,398
and
gains on the sale of investments of $1,850 for the nine months ended August 31,
2000, respectively. For the three and nine months ended August 31, 2000, the
Company also sold 100,000 and 200,000 shares, respectively, of CellStar common
stock, yielding net proceeds of approximately $271 and $852, and a gain, net of
taxes, of approximately $70 and $333, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's cash position at August 31, 2000 increased $55,059 from
the November 30, 1999 level. Operating activities provided $60,630, primarily
from a decrease of $24,217 in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts
payable and accrued expenses of $31,425, partially offset by increases in
inventory of $13,626. Accounts receivable days on hand decreased to 42 days at
August 31, 2000 from 47 days at August 31, 1999. Inventory days on hand
increased from 28 days last year to 33 days this year. The increase in
inventory
value and days on hand was primarily in the Wireless Group. The increase in
accounts payable and accrued expenses is primarily due to $43,874 received from
a customer as a prepayment for future product shipments (See Note 12).
Investing
activities provided $5,160, primarily from the sale of investment securities

From the PRE14A proxy statement:

On May 9, 1995, we issued warrants to purchase 1,668,875 shares of Class A
common stock at $7.125 per share. The warrants were issued to the beneficial
holders of approximately $57,600,000 of our debentures. The warrants expire on
March 15, 2001, unless sooner terminated under certain circumstances. In
connection with the issuance of the warrants, John J. Shalam, our Chief
Executive Officer, granted us an option to purchase 1,668,875 shares of Class A
common stock from his personal holdings. The option from Mr. Shalam is only
exercisable to the extent a warrant holder exercises its warrants described
above. The exercise price of this option is $7.125, plus an amount intended to
reimburse Mr. Shalam for the tax impact, if any, should the exercise of this
option be treated as dividend income rather than capital gains to Mr. Shalam.
During 1998, we purchased approximately 1,324,075 of these warrants at a price
of $1.30 per warrant. In connection with this purchase, we cancelled our option
to purchase 1,324,075 of Mr. Shalam's shares. As of November 30, 1999, 344,800
warrants remain outstanding and we have a corresponding option to purchase
344,800 of Mr. Shalam's shares.

You might want to have a look at the 424B1 filed 2/4/00 where the President and
CEO
was the "selling stock holder" to the tune of 1 million shares. Related party
transactions in the same filing is also interesting. It seems the CEO's little
private companies receive approximately $1.7 million a year in rent from the
company.
Also mentioned in the proxy filing, there's a new bonus program where
a number of directors receive a total of 6+% of pretax earnings exclusive
of "extrodinary items" as a year end bonus.

Let's add it up real quick. The CEO gets a bunch of free stock which dilutes
shareholder equity and sells part of it to the public for $45 million. He sells
warrants to the company for around $2 million and the company cancels the
options.
The numbers get padded, but one time charges don't come out of the bonuses. The
more the books are cooked, the more he makes. His share of the pretax bonuses
comes to about another million. Then we add in the $1.7 million a year in rent.
The bottom line is I wouldn't trust this man as far as I can throw a bus. If I
found myself in an elevator with him, I would keep my hand on my wallet until
he got off. And I sure wouldn't buy stock in his company.

Last post on VOXX. I've already spent considerably more time researching a
company I would have automatically rejected as a suitable investment in the
first 10 minutes of looking. It's those "red flags" I spoke of. The pattern
is always the same and it tends to make me cranky to see that kind of abuse
of fiduciary duty.

Thanks for the URLs!

Had put aside the list for a bit, because I've been studying up a lot on Cash
Flow Analysis.

Although I am comfortable with the components of the Statement of Cash
Flows(SCF), and I understand that the higher the Cash From Operations(CFO) the
better off the company, I am wrestling with coming up with a usable formula for
converting the CFO into a valuation tool. For example a company with CFO of $90
million, with "X" amount of shares, is worth what?

I understand that the time value of money has to be taken into account and that
I have to discount future cash flows as part of this value hunting process. I
am just uncertain what length of future(2 years, 3 years, etc.) to use and how
to remove as much guessing from formula as possible. Or, if I can't remove it,
what would be a conservatively prudent future estimate of revenue growth and/or
CFO growth that would still allow a fair evaluation of todays value.

I think I have found a good formula for discounting cash flow in an old
financing book I picked up somewhere, and I have an HP12C that I use for
mortgages that is capable of the same thing. But the rest is more difficult to
arrive at. I've looked back at Security Analysis, and Intelligent Investor, and
a host of other sources in my library but I haven't seen anything yet that
specifically addresses the idea I have.

I think I can only project 2 years growth for any company without really
getting out there on my guesstimations so I think I'll try to work out
something based on that length of time.

Also, the cash from financing activities and the cash from investing activities
are areas where I haven't finalized my thinking. If a company is selling
widgets, then that should be the business I am evaluating and not the cash
flows from elsewhere. I think those flows(even though for some companies it can
be sizable) I'll just put on the side of the ledger that evaluates what they do
with the profits they don't pay me(ROE, etc.). However, if they apparently put
CFO to "bad" use, I will deduct accordingly from CFO and use the net for
whatever formula I can come up with.

Do you have any valuation formulas or methods that you care to share that are
based on cash flow?

madharry, while I do not like such arrangements, I think it is just one element
in the investment picture, and I believe your apparently blind sale of SEMI on
the basis of one is questionable.

In the first place, from the Def 14A you appear to have significantly
overstated SEMI's deal, as the percentage seems to be 8%, and limited to 2
times base salary:

"Under the Goldberg Agreements, Paul Goldberg and Bruce M. Goldberg are
entitled to receive, in the case of Paul Goldberg, an annual cash bonus equal
to 3% and, in the case of Bruce M. Goldberg, an annual cash bonus in 1999 equal
to
4% and in 2000 and thereafter 5% of the Company's pre-tax income, before
nonrecurring and extraordinary charges, in excess of $1,000,000 in any calendar
year. Such annual bonus compensation for each of Paul Goldberg
and Bruce M. Goldberg is limited in any year to an amount no greater than two
times his respective base salary for the applicable year."

Second, you have to look at the big picture. Is mgmt on the same side of the
table with you or not. SEMI's mgmt owns more than 10% of the stock plus a bunch
of options, and benefits far more from 10 points on the stock than from any
other compensation.

Third has the company delivered. SEMI probably had top 10% earnings and stock
price performance in 2000, which is pretty good for a tech related business. If
I had had all my money in SEMI on 1/1/00 I would have a hell of a lot more
money than I do today.

Regarding cash flow. Hows, Whats, and my favorite, Why.

TimbaBear, you will likely get replies of a methodological or analytical nature
in regards your inquires about cash flows. Certainly that's what one could
expect from a value thread. I offer:

for getting company information from SEC filings, I prefer
http://www.10kwizard.com/

for detailed discussion, I prefer the thread entitled, "Free Cash Flow as a
Value Criterion"

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/subject.aspx?subjectid=17762

The bigger issue though is why make such a detailed evaluation and study of
cash flow? If one says it is part of a desire to learn and/or will make an
investor more knowledgeable, more, informed, better balanced - that I certainly
understand. However, my opinion is that it's likely not a fruitful pursuit if
the objective is "coming up with a usable formula for converting the CFO into a
valuation tool."

You will see on the SI cash flow thread what you already know - that people
have different ideas as to the components and relative importance of those
components of cash flow. You will also notice that the thread is moribund. The
reason is not because no agreements could be reached about cash flow analysis,
but, imo, because there could be no translation from accounting discussion to
application. That is, you will see few or no stocks discussed as "good buys"
because of their cash flows. Nobody there (as I recall) admitted to making
money from picking stocks by using cash flow analyses as a prime selection
(valuation) tool.

You have already also seen that Ben Graham does not even discuss cash flow in
"The Intelligent Investor". Although people attribute some or much success of
Warren Buffett to his cash flow studies, there's also been reports that Charlie
Munger has said he's never seen Mr. Buffett actually do a cash flow analysis.

TimbaBear, your post reads to me like you are attempting to find the Holy Grail
as you drill down into the depths of the how to's, assumptions, relationships,
and relevance of cash flow. What I'm saying is that I just don't believe all
that is so necessary or important in making an investment decision.

Any thoughts on DITC?

Announced lower financial expectations yesterday, dropped dramtically..

however company has 3.5 dollars in cash which means the the furrent share price
is more like 3.5 than 7 and forward p/e is also about 3.5 even after reduced

Ben<<I would not suggest buying voxx based on earnings grwth at all. All I care

coming after the CDMA market. Their phones are designed to have common parts so
costs will be lower. Their margins are dramatically higher than VOXX. They have
a very strong brand & reputation. VOXX is either going to lose market share
rapidly or lose market share more slowly by meeting price/marketing challenges
at the expense of already skinny margins. Either way profitability declines.
This [and the accounting issues mentioned by Don] is why the price is so low,

Hi Paul!

for detailed discussion, I prefer the thread entitled, "Free Cash Flow as a
Value Criterion"

It's funny you mention that thread, I just discovered it this morning. I intend
to read all 250 posts, or at least those that look like they have meaningful
content.

TimbaBear, your post reads to me like you are attempting to find the Holy Grail
as you drill down into the depths of the how to's, assumptions, relationships,
and relevance of cash flow. 
Well, Paul, I don't happen to think that there is one Holy Grail, I think there
are many. I hope I'm not in search of it, but am able to craft my own at some
point. I would like to have one for each area of investing and speculating that
I become interested in.

Imagine a set of guidelines for each type of investment that have been so well
thought out (for that vehicle specifically)and tested that they will always
give a superior performance. And to have these guidelines internalized. Perhaps
that is "To Dream the Impossible Dream." But what's wrong with that?

The worst that can happen, that I can see, is that I walk away from the effort
a more informed investor who maybe understands a little more deeply some more
of the forces at play in the economic universe.

If I'm able to integrate CFO and FCF more completely into my investment
decisions, I don't think I'll be hurt too badly financially in the process, and
will probably add a better margin of safety to my value portfolios. Don't you
think?

PAUL: I always look at CFO, FCF, and components AR & inventory as a check on
quality of earnings. It takes less than 5 minutes. This indicates if there are
problems that might soon result in an earnings surprise. I don't do
full-fledged DCF valuation runs, however, as the cost: the time to fill a DCF
spreadsheet, doesn't appear to yield sufficient benefit given the number of
names one looks at to find a keeper.
I use 10kwizard because of the alert and search capabilities, but their

Paul,

I go back and forth on the issue of FCF vs earnings.

What I think the whole valuation issue comes down to is the "cash earnings",
the "return on capital" the company can get from reinvesting it, and the
business position (risks).

If a company is generating a lot of free cash by standard definitions, it can
simply mean that there aren't any reasonable investment and growth
opportunities available for it at present. (and vice versa) This is something
that is constantly changing.

There are also disagreements on what constitutes FC.

If a company has NO internal growth opportunities at all, but uses all of its
earnings plus more to make an acquisition, then in reality it generated no free
cash. Its future growth will come from that form of investment instead of the
usual capital spending. Yet I see companies like that referred to as high FCF
companies all the time. The food group comes to mind here.

I simply try to get at the "real earnings" of a company (accounting) and its
prospects for deploying that cash on favorable terms.

My 2 cents. :-)

David D: I have a modest DITC position with average cost around 9.75 after
averaging down on the drop. Listened to conference call and will probably hold
on at least until mid-Feb projections. The degree of the revenue drop was a
surprise, but a substantial portion of it, the OC-3 delay is already corrected.
They have the cash to weather a dry spell and at this point the projections
aren't calling for significant losses. My tentative guesstimate is this could
go as low as cash [-3.5], but within a year could recover to more normal
earnings expectation [01 concensus was 1.86 with 40% growth rate: cut that by
1/2 and you have .9 @20%, give that a 20x multiple and you have 18, +11 from
here] Thus upside/downside about 3x with a big chunk of uncertainty.

Imo, this thread would be about the best place to come for a balanced look at
cash flow. We've got a goodly number of people here who, IMO, can and do use
cash flow in their analyses and importantly (to me anyway -g-), who are able to
pick and hold stocks that go up (and share those picks with the rest of us).
They possibly attribute some of their success to cash flow analyses (I am
guessing - I don't know). I will include in this group "the usual suspects" --
Wayne Crimi, Twister, Jim Clarke, Mike Burry, maybe Bob Rudd -- and others who
can and like to take apart a balance sheet. And I know there're more out there
whom I forget, who are equal to the task, but don't post so much on the topic
that I can remember -- maybe Madharry, LauA, RJM, or J. Bash, S Emmerich, one
of the Davids, others.

I have a question for you cash flow-ers: Why are you guys not doing the
detailed work and study that TimbaBear proposes for himself? Or if you have,
give him the darn formula already that relates cash flow to valuation. (And
send me a copy too.) Because I am saying it's too much work for too little
reward. Nothing against the learning experience, but the effort ignores a large
body of literature.

For example, in Tanous' "Investment Guru's" the only mention of cash flow is
the discussion with Mario Gabelli, where Mr. Tanous says, "EBITDA...also
sometimes loosely referred to as 'cash flow'... Most private market purchasers
look at EBITDA multiples in preference to pirce-earnings multipes." And Mr.
Gabelli says, "Ideally, EBITDA margins will grow, but you don't need that. In
that framework (aside: discussing a business franchise that grows), cash flow
is used to reduce debt, enhancing the enterprise value."

In Marty Whitman's "Value Investing", he says "The common definition of cash
flow as EBITDA is a mere start. A good analyst then has to examine the use of
proceeds from EBITDA..." But a page prior to that I read the confusing (to me)
statement, under "Do earnings and cash flows have primacy?" section, "In value
investing, earnings and cash flows are not the main focus. Resource conversion
and access to capital markets at superprices are at least as important."

If I am correctly understanding David Dreman's chart "Four Flavors of Value
1970-1996 (p. 155, "Contrarian Investment Strategies, The Next Generation")
which uses Compustat supplied data for the 1500 largest publicly traded stocks,
we have, "Average Annual Returns" for four types of investments as:

Low P/E 19.0
Low P/CF 18.0
Low P/BV 18.8
Low P/Div 16.1
Market 14.9

Which gets us to his Rule 14: "Buy solid companies currently out of market
favor, as measured by their low price-to-earnings, price-to-cash flow or
price-to-book value ratios, or by their high yields."

Isn't that what we are trying to do here? And aren't the cash flow numbers
given by various internet sites as EBITDA a decent approximation or a very good
start for cash flow? And some sites even give "better" or adjusted cash flow
numbers.
-------------------------
TimbaBear's discussion topic is a subtopic within my overall issue and confused
state about why value investors seem (imo) to feel they must put a personal
spin on value investing---- why not many at all seem to want or are able to
follow methods in the ways they are documented by the superior investors whom
we admire.

I believe that with the tech stocks, cash flows are very difficult to predict
from one year to the next, let alone several years out. its is much easier to
try to analyze the balance sheet and decide which of those numbers make sense
or need adjustment as well as to try to get a handle on managment and their
ability to execute once in awhile.
then one hopes that the assets dont suddenly deteriorate in value. with respect
to cash flow i think it has to be looked at in the context of the specific
business.

"Buy solid companies currently out of market favor, as measured by their low
price-to-earnings, price-to-cash flow or price-to-book value ratios, or by
their high yields." David Dreman

A different opinion is expressed by Ken Fisher, author of "Super Stocks", that
Price to Sales is the ticket. This was seconded by James P. O'Shaughnessy in
"What Works on Wall Street". JPO is a "quant" who tested 45-55 years of data
and found that the best performance was turned in by a portfolio of stocks with
a PSR < 1 and which had a high relative strength in terms of price. That last
fact may seem counterintuitive (especially to this thread--it is to me), but
that portfolio bested the runner-up by a good margin. The second place
portfolio consisted of stocks with an Earnings Yield > 5 and also had high
relative strength. Apparently the momentum boys are onto something. If I
remember correctly, Dreman's strategies did well in O'Shaughnessy's results.

I am under the impression that the publishers take much of the risk. Indeed,
they even have a discount store here where there are (used to be...havent been
in a year or so) thousands & thousands of books, many with the covers removed
for sale for $1. This suggests that if they return the covers, the publisher
eats the cost.
However, I would think that a lot of them would be on the balance sheet as an
account payable.
Clearly they should stop building new stores and focus on making their
remaining stores profitable. But they opened a new one about 3 miles from my

Pete Kocmalski, I generally use PSR to compare a company with itself; sometimes
to compare a company with its industry peers. Also, for tech stocks, I try to
watch that I'm not paying more than 3 or 4 (which if I recall correctly, is
unsustainable per Ken Fisher in his PSR book). Although sometimes, I do step up
and pay more than 3.

One problem with Ken Fisher and PSR is that Mr. Fisher doesn't seem to use PSR
at all in his work anymore. He's in favor of high p/e's (per a '99 Bloomberg
article) for at least some stocks (holding on to them even if the pe is high),
and in his Forbes writings, recommends choosing reasonable (my word) pe stocks
from among the largest large caps, especially foreign at this time. Or so
that's what seems to me his methodology now. It's as if he's disavowed anything
to do with PSR.

The Ken Fisher PSR thread here on SI that was started in '96 died within a few
years because none of us could use psr effectively in selecting stocks. Well...
okay, that's just my opinion. (I should speak for myself only.) It just didn't
seem to work, or work as well as other methods that thread posters might have
been evaluating. (Or if psr worked, none of us could convince any other of us
that it did -g-)

Problems for me with O'Shaughnessy's methods include: several alternative
methodologies, difficulty in relating risk to reward with some models (high rel
strength) even if there was a 40 year history, requirement for yearly
rebalancing. In an article in Bottom Line newsletter, 7/1/99, he mentioned two
factors "to consider when hunting for value stocks"

ratio of price to sales (no more than 2.5)
high dividend yield

with a recommendation at that time of 75% value stocks & 25% growth, and within
value - a 50/50 large cap/small cap split.

Reading from a Barron's interview (I don't have the date) he said, "If you want
to be a bottom fisher...go for fundamental values like low price-to-sales, low
price-to-book, low price-to-earnings. Don't try to be a bottom fisher on price
(i.e. buying the year's biggest losers)."
Later though, just what you've posted Pete: "What i found was you are best off
when you use these macro strategies like low price-to-sales ratio, high
relative strength, regardless of market capitalization." (aside: During the
time frame of these articles, there was much media discussion whether large cap
stocks would continue to totally dominate small caps and if/whether small caps
were doomed to mediocrity.)
His number 2 method was the high dividend model (ala his Cornerstone fund),
which appealed to me much more.

I'm not current on his models or funds. (I believe he's given up managing
public funds to try a venture in a new thing of individual
self-developed/self-managed mutual funds); I defer to anyone with current or
better information on the O'Shaughnessy models.

In my own investing research, I've used O'S methods more than anything else.
Maybe its the engineer in me but the data analysis that he's done struck a
chord with me. Over the last few years, I've put together many O'S type paper
portfolios that have performed very well. Of course, then I do exactly what O'S
says not to do which is cherry pick from the screens.

That's why my pet peeve is value investors who won't buy a stock at $10 if it
used to be $5. A stock drops from 20 to 5 then rebounds to 20 and meets 'value'
criteria at 10. If you can call the bottom, that's great. If you can't, you'll
get a better return buying at 10 on the way up than at 10 on the way down. As I
said, I haven't really developed the investing discipline to implement O'S as
analyzed in his books but I'm working on it.

The reason free cash flow is so much a part of my analysis is that it is real.
You can't buy a pizza with GAAP earnings. Where it is most valuable in analysis
is when free cash flow doesn't match earnings. Xerox and Armstrong World come
to mind there. Negative free cash flow was a huge warning flag which was there
for anybody to see long before the stocks collapsed.

Earnings are not always in cash, and it will save you from a lot of mistakes to
understand why and to check that before buying a low P/E stock. A company with
free cash flow has options that a company without free cash flow doesn't. They
can buy back stock. They can pay down debt. They can bottom fish and acquire
competitors on the cheap.

An important warning. Free cash flow numbers that come through screens or Yahoo
or similar databases are notoriously wrong. Sometimes I wonder where they're
getting their numbers. I firmly believe that you've got to do the calculation
yourself.

I own one company with a roughly $100 million market cap which generates $30
million of free cash flow per year. I own another with a $170 million market
cap which generates about $35 million. I don't worry much about these - I just
check the cash flow statement once a quarter and wait for them to double.

As for valuation, there's no formula, just judgement. I like to take the
inverse of the free cash flow multiple to make me think like an owner. Rather
than saying the stock trades at 12 times free cash flow, I think in terms of an
8% free cash flow yield. i.e. if I owned this whole business I could put 8% in
my pocket in year one and not harm the franchise. For some companies 5% might
be enough, for others I might require 10 or 12%. Unless that free cash flow is
obviously a peak number that will never be repeated again, I rarely require
more than 10% yield. And that usually provides a good deal of downside
protection because at 10% the company can buy back a lot of stock and makes an
obvious takeover target.

And then we have Apple, which somebody asked about. Here is one where a very
simple cash based analysis comes together beautifully. $17 stock price, $11 of
cash. So you're paying $6 for the business. It generated approximately $2 a
share of free cash flow each of the last three years. Obviously they hit a
rough spot, and I have no idea how long that will last. But the stock is just
too cheap. I just think we have a case here where the people who bought the
stock at 60 had no comprehension of valuation, and now they're selling at this
level having lost a lot of money and demonstrating that they learned absolutely
nothing from the experience.

is somewhat counter-intuitive to a value investor, O'Shaughnessy's rationale
makes sense. You have found a "cheap stock". It could get cheaper. The relative

changed or been corrected.

Like Steven, I'm building portfolios based upon JPO's screens; actually,
they're more like lists at this point, since I don't think we're anywhere near
the bottom. I still remember 1990 and buying good companies with a PE = 3. I
