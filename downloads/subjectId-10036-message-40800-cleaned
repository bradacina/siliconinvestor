i ve owned a very small piece of this one for years. its been so long i cant
remember why i bought it in the first place. it seemed to be a perenially
undervalued stock in the market place i guess. I'm trying to be very selective
when i buy individual mining companies. I think its very difficult for
non-experts to adequately assess the risk reward ratios and when you can buy
expert advice at a cheap price by investing in the investors-slw, aab.to ,
cmp-un.to, als.to and now ttt, I would rather put most of my eggs in those
baskets. the exceptions i am willing to make are situations where the junior
has participated out a lot of the risk to a major, or where the grades are
good, or where i am stuck from an investment/spec made years ago. I am still in
DGC.to with a large position mostly because of Paulson's confidence in it, and
i own px.v because of my previous meetings with management and their success
with detour. then i have about 20 small positions with different miners and
majore ones with slw and axu. however, when i am objective its a lot easier
just to invest with these smart managers when you can get them at reasonable
prices, let them find the projects at great prices and hold on rather than have
to monitor whats going going with all these small mines. in 2010 my basket of
smaller miners were up maybe 30% with most of that gain coming from px.v.
All the management names except for ttt outperformed that.

I am in process of moving some business over to fidelity. they are offering a
pretty good deal and they also have something called a gift giving account. you
can donate stock to the fund in a given year and then i guess at your leisure
make contributions out of there to charities of your choice by writing checks.
at least thats how i think it works. minimum contribution to fund the account
is $5,000-minimum check to an individual charity is $0. I dont understand why
everyone else isnt doing this.

Best wishes to all for a happy holiday. I am rereading Klarman's Margin of

It says interest rate and not desired return or whatnot. What do you think is
an appropriate interest rate?

Although it says interest rate and not desired return, the meaning of it is
still a return that you could get at that time on that dollar amount. In
essence you are calculating a dollar amount that would return the same amount
of money over person's as the earning differential between educated and
uneducated earnings. But what is the return rate?

If you go with interest (risk free?), you'd probably take a long bond rate,
since you are discounting for a person's lifetime and 30 year bond is pretty
much what you can get kinda guaranteed for long term. Buffett is
(intentionally?) simplifying a lot here, since obviously there is no (risk
free) single rate that you could use for the whole person's lifetime.

You can use average rates or whatever else you want to use. :)

I was just addressing the example you provided. In case of a company, some
people use WACC ( Weighted Average Cost of Capital -
http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp ).

You have to realize that there are two very different ways to use DCF.
"Threshold" DCF tries to establish the price at which company purchased now
would provide a threshold return (let's say 15%) based on its future cash
flows. "Intrinsic value" DCF is what Buffett talks about. It does not predict
the price at which you will get some specific return, but rather calculates
what is the "intrinsic value" of the company at the present moment based on
future cash flows and some kind of cost of capital.

I personally don't use Buffett's method. I look at DCF very infrequently and
when I do I use a "threshold" DCF, i.e. I use a return threshold (e.g. 15%
return) to calculate what would be a good price to pay for company right now.

The problem with any DCF is that it's almost impossible to predict the future
cash flows, especially in 5-10 years. Read "Buffettology" and you will discover
that they suggest that "great moat" companies are preferable because it is
easier to predict future cash flows for them. Then look at what their year 2000
10-year predictions would have been for KO, PEP, MSFT or WFC and compare that
to actuals in 2009. This exercise might be eye opening. ;) I don't even talk
about their "case studies", which are Gannett and Freddie Mac - both Buffett
holdings in 1990s... :P

Hi Madharry -
You always got to plant some seeds so you can harvest your crop in the Spring.

What do you know about "Rare Earth Elements" (REE)?

Discussed on NPR today. Used in Green Technology. Here is a summary from this
article.

MarketEye: Rare Earth Elements - not so rare, yet
http://www.ttiinc.com/object/me-valliere-20101222.html

From the article:"...China currently supplies more than 90% of all REEs. Total
world demand in 2010 is estimated at 130,000 tons while total world production
will be about 120,000 tons. The shortfall is being met with recycling and
depletion of existing stockpiles. Demand is expected to rise to 180,000 tons by
2012 and more than 200,000 tons by 2014 while Chinese production is expected to
top out at 160,000 tons By 2012 or earlier China's internal demand will exceed
their production. In July 2010, China announced they will reduce exports by
72%. Today there effectively are no other sources for these REEs. Headlines
were made recently when China allegedly halted shipments of REEs to Japan to
protest a fishing dispute. Japan reportedly quickly capitulated and released
the fishing crew to resume shipments. This may be a preview of the next few
years as China reserves its supplies for internal production and the rest of
the world scrambles to develop new sources...."

Stocks mentioned in the article up big today.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MCP,AVL&d=s

Seems like a good Value theme developing if some of our vast U.S. Federal lands
start providing mineral permits for the mining of these REE.

Have you run across any mining companies that could produce REE from their

Depends on the company and what they have been accomplishing in the past.

For example, JNJ has been growing at 12% Owner's Earnings for the last 9 years.

I'm using 8% growth rate(Buffett's definition with college edu),
4.25%(definition without college edu), discounted at 20%. Now I just got to
slap on a multiple. I'm using 11. JNJ averages at 11 times FCF. Owner's
Earnings are pretty close to FCF. It equates into approximately $85 a share.

I figured if I buy it today, the only thing that is guaranteed is the 30 year
T-Bond hence the 4.25%. 8% is just a conservative number I came up with over
the top of my head.

I figured since I was going to hold my investment for "perpetuity" I might as
well us 30 years as the benchmark cause its the longest bond there is.

As you say, each company is different. If I look at JNJ as a value investment
similar to other value investments, then for me, the best (highest) value I
come up with is that fair value for JNJ is about $67. Of course JNJ is not your
typical value company. Maybe it isn't a growth company like it once was, but
it's perhaps more growthie than value. Plus you have the increasing every year
dividend and the the company's super long business history and good
performance. Stuff that I can't or don't value quantitatively.

I have shares of JNJ, and will consider adding more if stock drops to near $60
or below again.

OK, you totally lost me with your example here. I can't understand what you are
doing and how and why. For example, if you're doing DCF you shouldn't have to
use any multiple. If you're using a multiple, then you're probably doing
something closer to Buffettology spreadsheet which is not a real DCF... :/ How
about a walkthrough of your calculations? :)

JNJ. Here's how I would do DCF:
Earnings ~15B based on 9 months of 2010 ( =11392/3*4 )
Assuming 10% growth for 5 years and flat after that and 15% threshold discount,
current value is 145B. I got this by plugging numbers into
http://www.moneychimp.com/articles/valuation/dcf.htm

Since the market cap is ~170B, we won't get the threshold return (15%) by
buying JNJ here.

Assuming 10% growth for 10 years and flat after that and 15% threshold
discount, current value is 182B. With this assumption we would get 15% by
buying JNJ here.

IMHO, 10% growth for 10 years is too optimistic for such a large cap, so for me
JNJ is a lukewarm buy here based on DCF. Using other approaches though
(Buffettology spreadsheet, P/E, etc.), it is a good buy. Myself, I hold a
position, but I'm not buying more here.

Throughout our discussion about 'intrinsic value' we've found out two things
about Buffett that he has been displaying throughout his career.

a) We will not find the same 'intrinsic value' for the same stock.
b) Buffett isn't your typical deep value investor.

I'm looking to buy JNJ under $60 as well but JNJ is at a good price right now.
I wouldn't hesitate to buy it even at $61.

I do value quantitative factors into stocks but I don't put a monetary value on

Hi Jurgis,

Lets get away from the stereotypical 'DCF' name and just call this a
'calculation'.

How I do it:

1) Figure out the growth rate of a company by using historic fundamentals.
2) Determine what's the remaining life of the company. (I need to find a way to
determine this)
3) (I use Owner's Earnings, FCF works well too!) Starting from the most latest
Owner's Earnings, multiply the Owner's Earnings by what you predict will be the
growth rate will be in the future. You do not need to multiply it by (A). I
would strongly suggest against multiplying it by (A).
C) Do what you did with C but multiply it by a known fixed rate (ie. 30 Year
T-Bond)
D) Subtract it and you have 'excess cash'
E) Discount the 'excess cash' by what you want to earn.
F) Add up all the 'excess cash' discounted.
G) Divide it by shares outstanding (I need to fix this too. I can't keep
pretending there will be the same amount of shares forever) This will be the
Owner's Earnings Per Share.
H) Multiply it by a historical Owner's Earnings/Share multiple.

Are we good (: ?

From:Jurgis Bekepuris
Hmm, I have one minor and two major issues with this.

Minor issue. In 3 and C (Note: there is no "A", you counted 1-3 then switched
to C...) for how many years you keep multiplying? Is that 10 years like in
Buffettology or "remaining life of the company" or what? What about the
terminal earnings after that? Depending on the company, this may be a large
number.

First major issue. You are discounting future cash flows twice. Maybe you don't
realize this, but you do it by first subtracting "base earnings" of your 30
year bond and then by doing a threshold discounting. It doesn't make much sense
and you get something that is difficult to understand what it means from
economic point of view.

Second major issue - even more major one. :) I strongly disagree with your
steps G and H. The number you get in F is the value of all future cash flows.
It makes no economic sense to multiply it by P/E. It's not earnings at one
point in time.

Look: according to economic theory the value of the security is the sum of all
its future cash flows. Assume you have an ice cream machine and you make money
selling ice cream. The machine's economic value is all the money you gonna make
selling ice cream until it breaks down. So the value of JNJ is what you get in
F (actually it's the number of all future cash, not "excess cash", but still).
What you do in H makes no economic sense at all. It's like saying: "I am going
to make $100 by selling ice cream from ice cream machine until it breaks down.
Let me multiply it by 10 and now I will make $1000." No, you won't. And nobody
will buy your ice cream machine from you for $1000, because they will never
make money back from this purchase price.

If you don't believe me, walk through some simple example, like an ice cream
machine that makes $10 per year and breaks in 10 years. :)

I am not sure where you stepped away from what Buffett (supposedly) does, but I
am sure he doesn't do what you described.

EDIT: Ah, I see, you are using this: For this exercise, we will ignore the
important non-economic benefits of an education and focus strictly on its
economic value. First, we must estimate the earnings that the graduate will
receive over his lifetime and subtract from that figure an estimate of what he
would have earned had he lacked his education. That gives us an excess earnings
figure, which must then be discounted, at an appropriate interest rate, back to
graduation day. The dollar result equals the intrinsic economic value of the
education.

The issue is, that this gives the intrinsic economic value of the education,
but NOT of the individual with the education. In case of company, it gives the
intrinsic economic value of the moat of the company, but not of the company
itself. There's a huge difference!

Obviously, you can do any calculations you want. It's just what you do right
now makes no sense.

so funny to see mr. kurt wulff recommending after my announced buys :

Six buy-recommended global energy stocks flow cash at a rate that exceeds stock
market cap and debt in less than five years. Unlevered cash flow multiples
(EV/Ebitda) below 5.0 identify the gushers. U.S. Integrated buy recommendations
Marathon Oil (MRO) and Chevron (CVX) regenerate in an estimated 4.9 and 4.5
years, respectively. The measures for European buy recommendations Total (TOT)
and Statoil (STO) are 4.3 and 4.1. Rounding out the six are Russian buy
recommendations Gazprom (OGZPY.PK) and Lukoil (LUKOY.PK) at 4.1 and 3.4.

Cash flow responds to an uptrend in long-term oil futures price quoted for the
next six years. In the past week, one-year futures have seized leadership by
crossing above six-year futures in a trading condition known as backwardation.
Refining margins are also strengthening with a diesel fuel shortage in rapidly
growing China and strong demand for heating fuel with cold winter weather in
the Northern Hemisphere.

Among the six cash generators, CVX is most concentrated on oil at 71%. Gazprom
is the natural gas leader at 82% while Lukoil is the refining leader at 34%.
TOT and STO are high dividend payers at 5.9% and 4.6% a year. Lukoil’s dividend
of 2.8% is supplemented by the recent repurchase of stock. All of the stocks
are in price uptrends compared to 200-day averages except TOT, which may soon
join its up-trending peers judging by recent market conditions.

Tax loss selling: Closed NOK position, sold some UEPS and CLLZF.

E&P runup continues: sold even more GPOR and GEOI. Although I am Peak Oiler at

reinvest some money in the unloved supermajors.

For individual buys/sells:

CHL - not very cheap, but I decided to start exploratory position after

CYOU, CELM, AXS - valuation based adds.
FR-J - the yield is not so attractive anymore while the risk remains. Cut
position to pretty small.

Bear with me, i'm still figuring this out.

In regards to your minor issue, I am still figuring it out. 10 years if you are
comparing it to a 10 year bond and 30 years for a 30 year bond but the numbers
are different. I'm finding a solution for this still.

I guess you answered yourself for the first major issue so i'll move onto the
second major issue.

Your arguement for the second major issue is valid. It felt wierd when I was
doing it. Let me explain myself:

The answer is a 'future cash flow'. At the current moment we keep hearing
stocks trading for x times FCF. Future Cash Flow would be the equivalent to FCF
and therefore we will also be required to pay a premium for the future cash
flow for a particular company.

There is always ways to scrutinize this calculation. I do feel the last steps
are awkward but i'm looking for help to fix this.

Thanks

Sorry armi, but you just cannot put a multiplier on a total future cash flow.
The reason there is a multiplier on a current cash flow is that the multiplier
is an estimate for the future cash flow. In essence the market is saying: "your
ice cream machine produced $10 this year, so we believe it will produce
something like 8 x $10 (discounted) through eternity". The 8 multiplier is just
an estimate for all the future cash flows discounted.

You could put a multiplier on the all future 'excess cash' discounted, since it
is different from "all future FCF". However, such multiplier has to be very
different from a multiplier that market puts on this year's FCF. Again,
assuming $10 in this year's FCF and let's say $20 in all future 'excess cash'
discounted, why do you think there should be the same multiplier on both? And
if it's a different multiplier, how do you know it's a "good" multiplier? IMHO
there is almost no intuitive meaning for your "all future 'excess cash'
discounted" number, so it's very hard to say what multiplier is good for it.

I pretty much remain with my opinion that you are going in direction that will
not yield useful results. Either use regular DCF or use something like
Buffettology calculations, but what you are doing now IMO is not productive.

Best luck though. :)

Hi Madharry -

Re: REE (Rare Earth Elements)

The problem with many of the REE specific miners I have looked at so far is
they continue to lose money. None are profitable or have any earnings to speak
of. They do not have the economies of scale (in their operations) to make
enough money just mining REE.

I would be more inclined to invest in a company that was profitable with a PE
of 12 or less, paid some type of dividend and mined REE as a side business
and/or as a new product line.

For example I own a platinum mine - Anglo Platinum Ltd. (AGPPY.PK) that pays a
7% dividend (they skipped their dividend in 2009) but more importantly provides
a good hedge against inflation for the portfolio. The stock split 6:1 in Nov.
2010 so it is more affordable. Holding the stock works out better for me than
owning the coins with better liquidity and I do earn an annual dividend.

I will have to see if any of my other miners have a REE component (ie BHP, AU,
AAUKY, VALE or even my USERX fund). Who knows, maybe some of my coal companies
could start a REE division.

FWIW - Molycorp, Inc. (MCP) up big again today (over 7%) w/ China rumored to

Quite a few of my accounts have cash inflows and outflows which make return
calculation unreliable (IMO - although IRR formula is supposed to take care
about inflows/outflows, etc.)

My 2009 return is here: http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26212212

My 2010 return is not calculated yet. It will be approximate, since I had to do
couple of account transfers that always mess up brokerage return reporting.
I'll go with Quicken reported return, which previously has had its own issues.
They might have been corrected in Quicken 2010.

I do not calculate intermediate returns throughout the year, since it's a pain
and IMHO do not provide any useful information except for **nis envy. :P I am
not sure even one year returns are useful.

The only number I have for long term returns is what Quicken reports and that
is ~12.5% annualized for 15+ years (just for fun the return is ~13% annualized
from 1/1/2000). The caveats are: very different amount of money in beginning
vs. now; much more involvement in recent years; 401(k)s where I am restricted
to a handful of funds are included; substantial withdrawals for house purchase

Live Oil in Markwells Wood-1 Core - Interim Statement

12/23/2010

PR Newswire (UK Disclosure): Northern Petroleum announces that live oil has
been encountered in the Markwells Wood-1 well in the primary reservoir target.
A core was taken and the well drilled to 4584 feet sub-sea level, and various
logging tools are being run to aid the assessment of results. There will be no
further comment until log evaluation is complete.

======================================================================

A very interesting area
http://www.northpet.com/news/detail/2010/11/northern-drilling-well-in-west-suss
x

The Markwells Wood-1 site was assessed with a mean potential of 35.0 million
barrels of oil in place, with an upside potential of 61.4 million barrels with
a ten percent probability.

The Licence Partners in the Markwells Wood well are:

Northern Petroleum (GB) Limited 50%
Magellan Petroleum (UK) Limited 40%
Egdon Resources U.K. Limited 10%

Stock traded as high as $3.00/share on more than 4x it's average daily trading
volume.

Do you have a fair value target for this company? This find adds at most
$0.50/share or about $27 million over the life of the production well.

Hi Dan

Peeled off some shares in EI DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD) on stock I purchased
11/19/08. This one worked out to be a double in 2 years. My next price level to
peel off shares is in the $55.00-$58.00 level.

I also, sold some higher cost shares in SVU (to offset my gain in DD). I like
the company and would like to purchase the shares back in 31 days. The only
problem is they will have announced their sales & earnings by then and the
stock could be 20% higher. I did pick up more shares 32 days ago below
$9.00/share.

re Rare Earth metals, Molybdenum, Tantalum.

I think that certain metals in a bubble. I have watched Ta (Tantalum) since it
is commonly used in the business I work in. There have been spikes in 1980,
2000 and now 2010. They happen and they go away.

For Ta in know for fact that there are swingproducers in Australia that are
going to start their mines again in 2011, I think and then prices will go down.

Consumers also started to replace Ta with the more abundant sister metal Nb.
These rare metals (Mo and Ta are not technically rare earth but the economics
are similar) are nor really that rare. There are sources in many different
countries especially in the USA. it just seems to me that is has been cheaper
to let the Chinese do the work. We have got a wakeup call now, so instead of

MRH - let's have another controversial discussion :)

What's there to like?

I am not an expert on insurance companies, but MRH violates almost all
principles on which I'd buy:

- Periodic losses. Not good. (This can be somewhat explained by reinsurance
business, but see other issues below)
- Wild fluctuations of revenue. Well, you'd think that means they avoid writing
unprofitable business, but not really - see above.
- You can somewhat value insurance companies by book value growth and even
Buffett somewhat endorses it. MRH? Wide fluctuations up and down in book value,
practically no growth for recorded history...

OK, so it trades below P/Book, but so do tons of other insurers which look much
better (IMO) on all the points above. I personally own and I'm still
periodically buying L, FRFHF, FSR, AXS.

Tell me why you like MRH?

How can you say that when the revenues were back down to 360M in 2008 and of
course they lost money? With such wild swings in revenues and profits you
cannot look at a single year and claim that it's cheap on that year's P/S or
that its margins are great.

Even taking 800M, the revenues have not grown in 7 years and neither have
profits. Where did they put all this money they supposedly earned? The earnings
per share did not grow either, so it's not like they bought back 50% of the

Re: Venoco, Inc. Common Stock (NYSE: VQ )

I thought there was an off shore drilling moratorium on the CA West coast after
the Gulf incident. However, if their wells are onshore but along the coast,
they may work out as long as they can get the appropriate drilling permits from
the the rigid coastal commission. Also, there has been scheduled insider
selling which I guess is normal but I see no buying.

From the article:"...TER: At a slightly higher price is Venoco, Inc. (VQ) is

ND: Venoco's pretty interesting. In a sense, you are really betting on its core
gas position in the Sacramento Basin. It provides nice baseline cash flow
because it's gas and is well hedged for the next couple of years. One would
say, "well that's not very exciting." But the really attractive upside is
Venoco's Monterey Shale play. Venoco has a couple of thousand acres there, and
it's just Venoco and Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) in this play.

This Monterey Shale is a very interesting oil play on the coast of California.
Estimates say there could be more than 100 million barrels in place, though the
estimates could be extremely high. This play is almost like an offshore. You
have a lot of upside, but you've got a lot of risk because we just don't know
about the timing. The company's only going to drill four or five horizontal
Monterey Shale wells this year and probably 15–20 next year; so, you're not
going to see a ton of results. But as those results unfold, I think you're

Company seems to proceed at its own pace in development of Monterey. Maybe
they're hanging back a little waiting for OXY to prove out the play. OTOH, VQ
have other producing properties, so I guess they have to allocate capital to
these too.

I'm figuring I'll have to hold the stock (VQ) a couple years to see how things
develop. No hurry to buy now, except that oil prices seem to be moving up (VQ

>>Spekulatius, what do you think is the best valuation method?<<

Basically, earnings and earning growth. Looking at the balance sheet and the
cash flow (or free cash flow) statements serves the purpose of checking the
headline earnings numbers for shenanigans (accounting tricks) to make the
headline earnings numbers better than they otherwise would have been.

You basically want to understand if management is able to increase the value of
he company or not. Generating FCF (which means generating a surplus of cash) is
just one of the means to do that. For a energy company, it could be to generate
a surplus of reserves in the ground ( reserve growth) or an utility it would be
great to invest in new equipment (Power plants, power distribution facilities)
that are going to generate an even larger stream of cash in the future.

For a bad way to spent cash (IMO), look at INTC purchase of McAfee, spending
48$/share for a company/stock that makes a little more than a 1$/year in
earnings after, for a <3% after tax return.

twelve months, and some short-term plays that may be just a few days.

I thought it would be helpful to provide an example of the short-term plays I
look for. I live in a small town outside of Bellingham, Washington. Bellingham
has a small airport served primarily by Alaska (Horizon) and Allegiant Travel
(ALGT). I know some people that work for Allegiant so in April I decided to dig
deeper into the company. The more I looked the more I liked it.

Allegiant has a $500 million market cap, so it is relatively small but has
enough liquidity for the small investors to get in and out, but not enough for
the big Wall Street firms to care about. It is covered by four analysts, which
is important. It means that any earnings surprises will likely result in
immediate stock price movement. Additionally, the company provides enough
information that earnings are somewhat predictable. This is a key point. I am
not a guesser, I want a high probability of being right.

Allegiant reports monthly statistics on everything from fuel costs, number of
departures, average fare, load factors, etc. All I need to do is create a
spreadsheet model to predict what the end result will be and compare it to
analyst expectations.

Model creation typically is a two hour process for me. I usually enter in
results form the last two years and look for what costs are fixed and what are
variable, and what are the drivers of additional cost. For example, with
depreciation, I can look at past cost versus number of planes in operation and
estimate current and future costs based off that. For fuel costs, which are
very significant for an airline, Allegiant provides most of what I need.
Allegiant releases their monthly average price per gallon so all I needed to
figure out was how much fuel they used. By comparing the number of available
seat miles in the current quarter to prior quarters, I am able to approximate
change in miles flown, since their stage length (average flight distance) had
not changed much.

For Allegiant it resulted in earnings per share beating the market handily. I
looked at the stock price and found it reasonable at about $20. My estimates
put earnings for the March quarter at around 45 cents versus analysts 34 cents.

The end result

I purchased shares in my Marketocracy portfolio for $20.13 on April 25.
Earnings were released on Monday April 28. Allegiant earned 47 cents per share,
well over the 34 cent estimate. The stock climbed from $20 to about $28. On
April 30, 2007, I sold all my shares at $27.29, for a nice short-term profit.

Some may ask, "Why sell if they beat earnings so easily?" The main reason was
that when I put the higher projected fuel cost estimates into my model it
revealed that the June quarter will be tough for the company. So I decided to
take the profits. The stock will stay on my watch list because it will benefit
greatly from any drop in oil prices should that occur.

EKS,

What is your opinion about Conoco Philips?

I watched an interview with James Chanos where he says he is short the big oil
companies, because they are not spending enough on renewing their assets. At
least this is how I understood his words.

Here is the interview I am talking about:

I don't think this is the case with COP.

Good Investing,

Yes, I agree with what you're saying for the most part. I definitely think the
political environment is heading for even more stress in 2011.

I do have a good chunk of gold, so I think we're still going up there (though
I'm not expecting a huge move). But, when interest rates rise and/or if the
U.S. actually starts moving towards austerity, I will probably reduce my gold
position.

From a supply/demand perspective for next year, I think Copper and Coal look
pretty tight and will go higher in price. Oil I think goes higher also, though
it's a different animal from a supply/demand perspective and less tight in
2011.

But, heading into 2011, I'm not seeing a ton of values and I'm not preparing
for a big year. I've got about 95% in stocks, but I'm as defensive in those
stocks as I've ever been.

2011 is going to be pivotal in the U.S. as we see what happens with employment,
the debt, and oil prices. Going to be a lot of tough decisions to make.

Thanks,

Grant

this is one guy's stock picks. curious that he reported on his portfolio
results for 2009 and 2010 when one could have thrown at a dart board and made
money but not for 2008 when most of us lost big time. a list like that is
pretty useless as he doesnt explain the basis so its a starting point for
individual research

My take on ALGT is different.

What it really boils down to though is how much money did you actually make? If
someone runs a concentrated portfolio, then to buy ALGT, they had better have
strong confidence in their analyses. Mr. Eriksen apparently does in his; I'm
too cautious with mine.

I'm not sure how much ALGT he bought back then, but with position sizes like
this, it would be a lot more that I would bet on ALGT:

http://marketocracy.com/mds/investors/teriksen

I entered ALGT in '08, sold, and reentered in '09, and have added more shares
in '10 as I've posted here.

ALGT doesn't operate with the same business model as other airlines. '08

==================
"...it is relatively small but has enough liquidity for the small investors to
get in and out, but not enough for the big Wall Street firms to care about."

I'm too cynical to believe this about size and liquidity. I believe Wall Street
guys are craven and crass and would at least consider selling their mother for
another 10% gain in their stock portfolios. And thorough...leave no stone
unturned. If they can figure that a small cap will do well, one way or another
they will be in there playing it. And that's just the big firms. The small and
medium size are in there too, looking at every stock. Jmo.

Don't know ALGT stockholders in '07-'08 when the article was written, but now
in '10, there certainly are several big WS firms involved with ALGT:

Re: bullish ag sector outlook: The stocks mentioned are too expensive for me.

I will go though with the conventional wisdom that ag commodity prices will
increase. That will lead to an increase in actual and perceived wealth by
farmers. How farmers will spend this wealth and when, I do not know.

1. If ag commodity prices increase, this should be reflected in increases in
prices of stocks of companies/funds that bet on such commodities. We'll see. I
intend to play this by pyramiding my position in DBA for every .50 or $1 that
DBA rises.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=DBA

2. If farmers have money, I assume not only will they be able to pay their
mortgage loans, but they will be interested in increasing their acreage by
buying more farmland. I'll play this by holding Federal Agricultural Mortgage
Corp. (AGM)

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=AGM+Key+Statistics

3. I continue to hold shares of several fertilizer companies. I find for me,
they are too expensive for me to make additional buys of now.

What about COP, Paul? I don't care about ALGT. Just wanted to share what I read
about it with the other members in the thread that might be interested. After
loosing from PNCL I don't like the complexity of airlines. So for me that is
it. What do you think about Conoco Philips? Why is it 9 P/E? Why not 13 P/E as
most of the others? Why Buffet bought it? Why he sold it?

Well if you're not interested in the stock or even the airline sector, and I'm
the only person here who's posted on the stock and indicated any particular
interest in the stock in the past two years, then essentially I feel I've just
wasted my time responding to a two-year old post that nobody cares about that
you needlessly brought here.

I love how the return of his picks is 49%, yet he owns only 3 out of his 40
recommendations. I wonder what's his return was in 2009 instead of what his
recommendations' return was.

If he has a method to pick stocks that return 49% a year why doesn't he use it?

And if he does not trust his method to invest according to it, then why does he
post the method's picks? Is that like "look how smart I am, why am I not rich"?

I don't know the guy or even follow him. The article appeared because of stocks
on my watch list. I think it was because I have St. Jude on it, but don't own
it. I guess we can see next year how he did Jan. 2012. I do have a liking
myself to STJ, but not as a value play. It's been on my watch list for a long
time. Just maybe I'll buy some in 2011?

BTW- The guy had MATK & ACET on his list for 2010. I own both. I did not use

Richardred,

I'm not sure why you feel that you have to be defensive or justify anything. My
comments were about the guy who wrote the article, not about you. Since then I
read a bit more and apparently he does not stick with his recommendations but
rather day trades, so his "2011 portfolio" is not really a portfolio. At least
he's honest that his trading did not beat the single shot 2010 portfolio.

We can also discuss the stocks that he mentioned - thanks for the pointer - but
I just found it interesting that he's one of the people who advise others but
don't eat their own dog food.

Re: Large Integrated Oils

Meter Reader
A Weekly Analysis of Large Cap Oil and Gas Stocks
December 14, 2010

A Few Good Contrarian Buys Left

http://www.mcdep.com/mr101214.pdf

I would suggest you look at the latest McDep report. COP is still one of the
best values for the Large Cap Oil and Gas Stocks as measured by the McDep
ratio.

Of course, it has been at this level for quite some time. In fact it seems like
every time I go through the McDep reports, the ratios have not changed too
much. COP is up from .68 (when I was making my buys in 2009) to .76 in the most
current report.

All are still undervalued by 25%. It seems like the best indicator is the
(future) price of oil.

Anadarko Petroleum Corp is the only larger Cap that is close to a McDep ratio
of 1. Isn't it interesting that BHP is rumored to be looking at it....

Betting that BHP’s on the prowl again
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bhp-anadarko-story-has-its-believers-2010-12-3
From the article:"...As far as rumors go, this is a good one.

Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC 76.16, +0.57, +0.75%) shares surged nearly 7% to
$75.59 Thursday on a single report in London’s Daily Mail that claims BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP 92.92, +0.02, +0.02%) is mulling a bid for the Texas-based
oil company. Read about BHP's possible bid...."

Here is the link to previous McDep reports.
http://www.mcdep.com/

=====================================================================

I would have to agree with Paul Senior that there are still some significant
values to be found in many of the smaller E&P companies that have virgin land
and proven reserves. Many of these companies could be valued 2x (200%) their
current market price.

COP is No. 3 in my top 10. CVX is No. 2. BHP is my No. 1 holding. I made five
buys in 2009 for COP w/ prices ranging from $42-$50. My last buy of CVX was
1/03/06. My most current buy for an integrated large cap oil was XOM with two
buys in 2010 at prices around $58.00/share.

My new money is focused on the smaller E&P companies, many of the mid cap NG
drillers w/ gathering systems and pipeline & storage subsidiaries. The key to
making money with this group is finding companies with the capital (or JV
partners) to drill new wells that will generate future cash flows and has
company owned land (not leased) that can be developed in the future.

It gets more difficult as oil approaches $100/barrel because the prices of many
of these companies get bid up in value. When the price of oil falls, so does
the stock price. That's why those companies with NG reserves that can break
even (w/ such low current NG price) should do extremely well when NG prices
rise.

Hope that helps.
