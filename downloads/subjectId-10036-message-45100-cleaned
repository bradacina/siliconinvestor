I am really wondering where the whole consumer market will turn out to be like
as we keep advancing to the future. When everything is all put into the cloud,
(despite the cloud concept being around for so long) are our current CPUs too
weak to handle it?

I would agree your longs on INTC, MSFT, and WDC are good bets. I'd like to add
NVDA to the list if the stock was a tad cheaper, its Tegra 2, I expect, to earn
a decent return for NVDA if its integration with Windows 8 works out.

re: NVDA

Is it a bet on its ARM chips?

I don't see moat in the ARM market. Android's programming api is essentially a
port of JVM. That completely shields the apps from the details of underlying
hardware. e.g. If Samsung suddenly switches to Intel Atom, if I understand
correctly, all it existing android apps will still work. It's opposite of the
Wintel platform. We saw how Sun demised indirectly caused by its own Java. Java
doesn't lock app developers onto its Sparc platform.

Just my 2 cents.

Windows 8 is going to support ARM. Tegra is a play on tablets and NVDA has a

I'm looking for it to continue to grow once there are more alternatives for

re UBS - I have been following the news about UBS after the trading scandal. I
am interested in a long position, at the right price - target price is about
10$.

The trading scandal has lead to leadership changes and the new CEO Sergio
Ermotti plans to dramatically reduce the investment banking arm (as I suspected
earlier). This will make UBS essentially a wealth management institution with
some Swiss and international retail banking. Essentially it should be a much
lower risk (and lower return) operation. For now, they are targeting a 10-15%
ROE which would be around 1.5-2$/share. I think they should be able to generate
higher returns going forward but they need to repair the damaged wealth
management operation first which is suffering from outflows since the financial
crisis.

new preferred paper to replace them. Frankly they are paying through the nose

You asked a specific question, which I answered directly , without regards to
the callable aspect. The average over the year of premium bac.x over cfc.B is
less then one. Its currently over 2. IOW If I had X, I'd sell it to buy B. In
fact if I had CFC.a (and did) I would sell that to buy B as well. BAC has an
assortment of more than 20 PFD's of different names. The liquidity, or lack of,

I don't like stepping up for stocks in a volatile market, esp. when we might be

I'm willing to buy MPC stock at today's price. Not many shares, but a few to

"...it's almost up 50% from it's low just a few weeks ago." There are a lot

Well, partially. In essence, almost everyone in the industry has used ARM cores
and designs for years (if not decades ;)). There's huge number of tools for
dealing with ARM cores, adding them to your designs, debugging your designs (HW
and SW), simulating the behavior, performance, etc. And as you imply engineers
in all the companies know the tools, the designs, the capabilities, available
subsystems, so anything done with ARM is probably 10 times more familiar and
easy than shifting to something else. And when I say ARM that's not just ARM
per ce, but the whole stable of companies that build on top of ARM, so you can
get ARM based processors or subsystems from them: TXN, STM, Freescale, etc.
(some examples: http://www.nokia-tuning.net/index.php?s=processor ). Some Intel
embedded cores are (were?) based on ARM cores, I haven't followed the latest

FWIW, I am moving money into real property (about 10% of the portfolio) and

to 8%. This is equivalent to the yield on many of my preferred stocks and my

Like with buying value stocks, I am probably early but these numbers have never

Hi JMako -

Intel is a good company especially in their R&D and manufacturing efficiency.
However they missed the ball with ARM and the development of the ultra low
powered processors. They seem to be back on track as they were as much as 18
months behind the curve with Nvidia

The real future threat is now Apple. Jobs knew that to leapfrog the industry in
smart phones and tablets a super efficient multi core low powered processor was
necessary. He hired 10,000 engineers over the last 18 months to design and
build this next generation processor. In April 2008, Apple bought P.A. Semi for
$278M to develop the next generation of ARM chips. In May 2011 Apple was
talking to Intel to fabricate their new processor(s).

Therefore, it still shows that Intel is the preferred manufacturer but on this
cycle, they will not gleen the high margins from their production as Apple will
get those 70% margins.

Still, Intel is a value buy at less than 10 forward PE especially with MSFT and
NOKIA needing ARM technology for their next generation phones.

<u>Insider Monkey: Wilbur Ross Buys More EXCO Resources, Ticker XCO </u>
Tuesday, October 18, 2011
http://crudeoiltrader.blogspot.com/2011/10/insider-monkey-wilbur-ross-buys-more
html

From the article:"...Wilbur Ross’s Invesco Private Capital (WL Ross & Co) filed
Form 4 on October 17th for its insider purchase in Exco Resources Inc. (XCO).
Invesco Private Capital is XCO’s insider and largest stakeholder, and the firm
reported 26.78 million shares, or 12.5% activist stake in XCO in its last 13D
on August 31th. According to the Form 4 disclosure, Wilbur Ross bought 7,900
shares at $9.99 on October 13th. Although this is just a small purchase he made
recently, Wilbur Ross has filed totally 4 insider purchases in XCO since
September. XCO is now trading at $11.62, still near its 2 year low....".

XCO. I'm out. I tried following Mr. Ross and other "astute" outside people who
were buying at higher prices, but the stock dropped too far for me to keep my
confidence.
Especially as I find I have no idea how to build a value case for XCO. If
anybody here has a value case for it, I'll listen.

My preference is toward small oil e&p's and an avoidance of gas e&p's (like

MET. Added to position on today's early drop.

Met announced that its annual dividend -- "payable on Dec. 14 to shareholders
of record as of Nov. 9 -- would remain unchanged at 74 cents a share, because
the Federal Reserve had rejected the life insurer's plan to increase the
dividend and resume share buybacks. The problem is that even though MetLife is
primarily an insurer, the company is considered a bank holding company and
regulated by the Fed because it holds a relatively small banking subsidiary..."

TAXI has a simple biz plan and they are executing it well. They borrow money
and lend it out at a higher rate. And they boast no defaults. Nice div.,

EKS, another ag stock. ANDE looks attractive to me on its p/e and ten year
history of profitability and steadily rising stated bv. It's a diverse company
-- maybe too diverse for its size. I don't care for some of its operations -- a
few retail stores in Ohio or its ethanol production operations. I like it for
its grain division and rail car operations, where it seems it might have some
strength vs. competitors.

Reluctantly, on a strong up market day (Dow +246), I'll raise my buy order and
step up for a few shares. With a view I'll add if/when market gyrations bring
the market and ANDE down again.

Re: The Andersons, Inc. (ANDE)

Paul this is a good one based on it's fundamentals. Low PE (7.5) , total LT
Debt to annual net income below 6x (5.5x), lot's of real estate assets bought
in the 50's for example their grain division; so cost on the books is very low
(ie BV probably understated).

I too agree that they have other divisions that really do not focus on their
original line of business (ie. grain division). This could result in an
eventual spin off of one or more divisions to extract shareholder value. I do
like the way management will take a risk and step outside their core business
to grow the company.

Dividend has increased every year since 1996 as well as a 2:1 stock split in
June 2006.

I do believe the World will eventually recognize the U.S. for it's exceptional
agriculture lands and the infrastructure we have built around that (grain
elevators, rail & ports, processing). It's just a matter of time before these

does not matter that Dow is up 400 points, there is no reason to sell. Now, if
you assume future to be the same as past four months, then yeah, there will be
another violent reversal down and selling today is great idea.

I sold a bit of BRK and my BBD position. Neither one is strong valuation call,
both will probably go higher. Both were weak conviction positions for me, so I
sold. Still around 20% cash as I was through most of this year (20% cash still

Hi JMako -

What's your 10 year view on inflation? A high inflation rate would skew the
blue line lower perhaps by one square. Look where it was during J. Carter
period. I expect double digit inflation some time in this decade based on the
amount of U.S. deficit spending and total cumulative U.S. debt. Corporate
balance sheets are the best in decades with lower leverage LT debt, high
amounts of cash, little to no pension liabilities and very efficient operations
that use computer and enterprise networks never available before 1990.

Therefore from a fundamental "Value" look, I am very bullish on many U.S.
corporate companies. The important thing for me is that as our currency is
debased (there is really no stopping this trend based on Congress inaction),
what asset class would want to own? U.S. Cash, Foreign currency, Bonds,
equities, hard assets (gold, land, oil) or some combination of all of the
above.

My plan is to hold equities of companies that own hard assets (like oil &
minerals) and/or have solid non leveraged balance sheets that generate
excellent FCF and reoccurring revenues w/ the ability to raise prices. I want
to buy them w/ PE's of 10 or less and close to BV. I am also buying high
yielding preferreds that generate income which are collateralized by companies
that own hard assets like Oil & NG (not real estate or fancy financial
derivative products - no financial stocks). The third leg in my "Value"
investment theme is to buy real estate investment property deeply discounted
that provides the portfolio an inflation hedge for the double digit inflation
that is bound to raise it's ugly head during this decade.

Most of my sales are stocks that move up outside my value target range. I am
looking to move the proceeds into other stocks that meet my value measures or
just park the money into high yielding preferreds and wait until other equities
fall into my buying range. Therefore, I am pretty much always invested in "the
market" and do not hold much cash.

I would love to play the swings in the market but I am lousy at timing when the
right time is to buy and when the right time is to sell (other than using my
simple value metrics). Therefore, if the market tanks and certain equities are
"buy" candidate, I sell my high yielding preferreds and buy the stocks.

I do become extremely bullish on certain sectors when I see certain hard assets
priced at historical lows (like Oil below $40.00/barrel or NG below $3.50 a
bargain at today's value). I will load up and play a reversion to the "mean
historical price level". I see this with borrowed money now (where it make
sense like w/ income property) as interest rates are at 50 year lows.

Hi EKS,

I'm lousy with macro economics. I read arguments from both sides, inflation vs
deflation, and dunno who to believe. But if you put a gun to my head to pick
one, I'd say inflation.

I buy what Buffett wrote in the 70's that one of the best protections against
inflation is to invest in companies with pricing power. Another thing I do is
to invest in companies with significant foreign revenues.

Look back in history, the after-shocks from a financial crisis and deleveraging
could last for decades. I buy Vitaliy Katsenelson's thinking that we are
getting into a prolong sideway market. I want to study bear markets. I'm going
to read Russell's "Anatomy of the Bear" in the coming weeks.

So, I'm getting more selective in my stock investment. I don't mind to keep
cash to wait for the fat pitches.

Real Estate makes a lot of sense.

Oil at $40/bbl, that will be a no-brainer. But in general, Oil and Mineral
companies, I said this before, I don't know how to value them. (I'll be
delighted if someone can show me the light. :-)

I'm constantly worried about China...

I find myself more more trading the sentiment rather than valuations, it's a
crazy world out there where a stock can move in value by 20%+ without any
change in fundamentals or news. I agree with Jurgis that stocks are not
expensive here but it seems to me that all these buyers and sellers have no
conviction whatsoever and just try to outrun the rest (sell before the others
do when bad news hit) so they don't get stuck in loosing positions in a 2008
like downward spiral. This is actually a game where we small guys can outplay
the big investors because our sales or buys don't move markets. What tomorrow

I am self aware, more so than the automated buyers that seem to be driving this
market. Or at least I hope so...

I think I would still call myself a value based buyer but certainly not a value
investor any more. I came to the conclusion in 2008 that the value (even in the
Graham tradition of using the net present value of future cash flows as a
valuation metric), the value is a strong function of macro.

Take for example an crude oil producer. Let's say they production cost are
30$/barrel - a recession can drive the barrel of crude to 50$ (the producer
makes a net margin of 20$/brl in this case) while economic growth can take a
barrel to 100$/brl (the producer makes 70$/brl). Now all of a sudden, guessing
the right crude oil price is much more important than choosing the right crude
producer stock. Energy company are an extreme example but even industrials have
a lot of leverage to growth and value and earnings can vary by a factor 2x
easily, depending on the economic scenario. Because I believe that the economic
scenario is and will stay way more volatile than in the 80's or 90's I believe
that investors should logically assign a higher risk premium to stock and
guessing the right macro might beat making the right stock calls in most cases.
Not that either one is simple to do, but I think it does make sense to look at
the macro picture and make decisions based on that, with a value component as
well.

The other thing I am haggling with (so far without luck) is a long /short
portfolio, similar to what hedge funds do. you could for example, if you truly
believe in a crude producer and it's valuation but don't believe the macro is
favorable, either short an index of other crude producers or maybe short the
crude in futures market (not easy for small investors). That way, you decouple
some of your macro risk and find out if you are truly generating beta with your
picks or ride along the market.

the value is a strong function of macro.

Even for the examples you gave, price is very strong function of macro, the
value isn't. So it is actually easier to be value investor rather than harder.
You buy when macro sucks and price is down. You sell when macro is rosy and
price is high. You don't have to guess or predict macro. That is impossible
anyway. You just have to follow the valuation discipline. The same way it was
done for last 70 years+ by Graham and others. ;)

You only think that "this time is different". :)

You can find examples where neither price nor value are strong functions of
macro, but that's a different discussion whether such companies are better
investments. If such companies have high value, then you usually can't get them
for cheap price.

You can find examples where both value and price are indeed a strong function
of macro - e.g. overleveraged companies that don't survive high interest rates.
For these companies you do need to guess macro pretty precisely, otherwise they
are bad investments. Personally, I would not buy such companies.

I don't like Market cap/ GNP. Market cap/ GNP is strongly dependent on the
fraction of the economic activity that is related to companies that trade in
stock exchanges. It is entirely conceivable that market cap/ GNP is a
relatively small number, yet the companies that trade in the stock exchange are
expensive by traditional metrics (like P/E, P/S, EV/ EBITDA) How could this
happen? It could simply happen, when a vast amount of the economy is
nationalized or in private hands and thus not related to companies on the stock
exchange. To some extend that is true in Europe where the state tends to own a
lot of commercial enterprises or private companies avoid listing on a stock
exchange. That does not make the companies that trade on these stock exchanges
cheap.
