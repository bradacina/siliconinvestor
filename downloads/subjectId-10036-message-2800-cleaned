Re: YUM

Yep, Greenblatt stimulated me to look more closely at
spin-offs. The most publicized one I saw after
finishing the book was PEP-YUM. I've been waiting for a good
price, and when it ran to 36 I thought I'd lost my chance.
Now it's back at 29. I'm very very interested, but then
I eat Taco Bell every 3 days. I am not sure my information
services are accurate with regard to YUM, but if management
is predicting 660M operating profit that is expected
to grow at 10-15%, then the stock looks cheap. I'm still
trying to get a handle on its debt.

What's your analysis?

UST recently announced a price increase, and its stock has
been responding. If it goes up another half point, it's hitting
all time highs in a down market. The stock still appears to
be value by dividend, ROE, buyback, and other characteristics.
The price increase seems to argue against overly competitive
pressures in its moist tobacco products. In fact, this ability
is something that Buffett would look for. I didn't buy in

James, Re: SJP

I've been watching it closely - it's been near the top of my
list, but I'm always waiting for it to get a little cheaper
and a little cheaper and a little cheaper... Now it's falling
on very high volume. Due to the 4 million share offering
by the majority holder? If I'm reading it right, all this
will do is increase the float, along with that 3 for 1 stock
split. An attempt to increase institutional ownership over
that 20% hump? Is the market reading this as dilutive and hence
dumping shares for no reason?

At 90, I'm oh so very tempted. However, I started cashing out of many
of my stocks (85% to be exact) in November because I have
big fears about the effects of Asia's cheap currency on US multinationals, the
flood of cheap imports competing with US
companies, and hence the market. A time of great opportunity
for the value investor may be at hand, and I don't want to squander a
cent prematurely. I'm pretty sick of prospecting for poor
businesses at cheap prices during a roaring bull and look
forward to buying great businesses at discounts during a true bear,
even if it is a modest one.

But it's worth 150? I look forward to your analysis.

Re: family/trust-controlled permanent values

CCN, VO. You can add Dow Jones and Readers Digest to that
list, but that hasn't stopped Michael Price from trying
to wring value out of them. The idea I guess would be
to wait for a stimulus. CCN jumped from 40 to 50 after
Viacom exercised its option to buy 50% of UPN.

SJP looks like a trust controls the bulk of it, but it has started
selling assets and buying growing businesses, and distributing
liquidations to its shareholders, and the stock has done hugely well
for our friend James Clarke here over the last year or two.

TRC spiked from the teens to 45 after it was revealed
Marty Whitman had bought a large interest from the Times
Mirror, which was doing nothing with it, and had
hired real estate experts. Problem is, the
stock was in the teens for many many years. And it's now
back at 25 as the speculation faded. As an aside, a 9/8/97 real
estate appraisal prepared for AB Edelman Value Parnters is now in
my hands and indicates the SoCal 271000 acres have a value of
around $115-130 million before bulk discounts. That should help any further
analysis here. The market cap is around $325M.

TRC and SJP were both brought up here just months before their
runs. VO down again today. I'll wait for some stability in VO
as the patient looks cold dead. At least TRC, SJP, and CCN have
shown signs of life in the last year, and had based within

The mind set of the Bronfman family is that VO is the crown jewel of the
dynasty. The family is stitting a mountain of assets of which VO is only the
1/10th of the iceberg sticking out of the water.

They actually might have a huge winner in Universal, however, but in 30 years
majority interests of VO will still be with the family.

VO is a total waste of time for a stock investor. Why should this Canadian
family want to do anything except collect dividends and have shareholders money
to now finance movies.

Howard Hughes taught them this.

Despite all the negative press about "the opportunity cost" of the acquisition
Universal will actually be a goldmine for the family.

Despite what I posted earl;ier I do view Edgar Jr. as a visionary businessman,
one of the only one's around. The problem is that no one in the business
community will probably ever understand either Edgar Jr. or Richard Branson. I
confess to being put out sometimes by Edgar's odd visions. Hell, that's what
makes a horse race.

Worswick: re: VO and MCA. Funny how people can look at the same thing and
interpret it differently. Like that old Kirasawa movie. The heart of it for me
re: MCA is: what were we looking for in this stock in relationship to the
company's intrinsic value? I've trudged out to my garage to try to find my old
files on MCA, but I can't find 'em -- so let me try it from memory. Stein and
Wasserman were/are very sharp business people. They built a terrific business
from booking acts (Stein) to radio, to movies, etc. This was done over a period
from 20's to the 70's. Now in the early '70's a person could buy the stock
--never get controling interest of course - basically for the land value alone
(too bad James Clarke - the resident real estate guru -was only a li'l kid
-then -g-). Even by the late '70's it was undervalued for land and film
library. Meanwhile these guys were working hard - or their employees were - to
create value. It may or may not have been reflected in the price in the early
'80's. You had to wait a long time for the stock to rise. But rise it did --
and not just because of a final buyout offer. There were two reasons for this
slowness IMO: 1) Entertainment business was seen as 2nd rate, faddish, subject
to whims of audience, run by creative types or dictators (even though MCA was
considered the class act among movie companies for their businesslike
approach). 2)Stocks of many good companies did not do so great in this time
period '73-83. For example I had to wait I believe about 2 or more years to get
a decent profit on FOX (I think it was FOX) after Star Wars came out - and that
was THE movie at the time.
So, if you are saying it's a problem because the stock price rises too slowly
or only after a LONG wait, you may be right. However this may not be because of
controlling owners. In a Buffett model - IMO he would say: who cares?
Stein/Wasserman are building a business with a great margin of safety, a great
moat, and the value gets greater and greater every year. And the price does
eventually come to fair value. The stock MCA was a buy and hold.

That was then. Now it's more iffy. Bronfman Sr. is a businessman who creates
value. Maybe his family can do something more with VO and Universal. If they
are not billionaires maybe they want to be -g-. Chris Craft - here your case is
stronger IMO. Segal's a sharp businessman, stock is not moving much, and it's
harder to see where he's going with the value or dollars ($1.5B) that he's
amassed. Also with CCN, they are not as diversified or recognized (franchise
and liquor) as VO, so there's some risk there. I've bought an initial small
position in VO today, and I own CCN (also a small amount).
What stocks are you buying or recommending now?

I am getting more constructive on the market based on this weeks action. Note,

Re: the market

Yeah, I see too much pessimism in the short term as well -
it's everywhere, including my web site. So this combined with
the end of the tax-loss selling should provide a great January
bounce. Especially the techs appear oversold temporarily.

But economists expect
a massive trade gap throughout 1998 as the Asian currencies aren't
about to bounce back to "normal" levels any time soon. In combo
with slow Asian economies, it sure looks like there will be an
"export or perish" mentality on the Pacific Rim. The multinationals
and blue chips are still very rich, and official estimates for GDP
growth are still 3% or so.

Once those cheap imports hit, there'll
be tech and blue chip earnings disappointments, and it is hard to
imagine GDP really growing at this past year's rates in the face of the strong
dollar.

The Dow really has hardly budged in percentage
terms , and on an absolute level the Dow along with the S&P are both
still way up there - thanks to continued mutual fund inflows
according to news today. That the market will go up indefinitely because money
is flowing in seems like a house of cards to me, though
99% of people seem to believe it true. When demographics are
driving the market rather than value, I know it's out of hand.
Not to mention good values are still rare.

Especially once the January rally is over and done with,
all those short-termers that control the Street will have
not much to look forward to for, say, 9 mos. That would strain
their brains. More downgrades. More earnings disappointments.
Etc. I think the pessimism we're seeing now is only a minor
prelude to what will happen around March and April.

The market is still above where it was when Buffett decided to
pull money out and put it in zero bonds. Just copying him
would probably be a good strategy.

Of course, this is all phooey, and the house of cards
will grow ever taller forever. After all, those 1000 people
on Wall Street that are getting $1M+ bonuses this year
are really earning it. It is awfully difficult to balance all
those cards.

One last point: does anyone know of a graph of real interest
rates? I understand that inflation is now at an annualized
rate less than 1.5%. Wouldn't that mean real rates are higher
than they were earlier this year despite the fall in the long
bond?

I agree with you almost 100%. But have a few questions to stimulate further
discussion.

-interest rates at 5.0% would mean what for the general market and specific
sectors/stocks - run out and buy FNM at an all time high and 20 p/e? can you
think of any reasonably valued, leveraged interest sensitive stock that would
be good in this environment?

-Except for a handful of tech stocks, like IBM, MSFT, etc., tech stocks have
seen a 1990 style correction. about the only thing worse would be a 1973-74
correction. Do you see it THAT bad? (I was there.)

-severe rolling corrections have characterized this bull market. You do not see
the possibility that large stocks could move sideways for an extended period,
supported by the effect of declining interest rates on the capitalization of
mediocre earnings - while the massacred smaller stocks gradually recover?

-I see no excesses in the economy or stock market, except in the key S&P 500
category of stocks. I also see much of the money supporting these stocks as
coming from company 401-K type plans where there is a great deal of inertia to
making changes. What would drive a change?

-Since i see the economy as without excess, if the market really started to
cave in, it might precipitate a recession, which would have Greenspan driving
short term rates to 3% again to avoid. (We have a lot further to zero than
Japan did.) What companies would benefit from 2% cut in short rates - same ones
as from cut in long rates?

-Have you heard of any price cuts yet on products from Asia?

I think that will do for a start :-)

In a traditional bear market the best stocks to buy for a bear market rally
were the smashed speculative leaders with large short positions and good
fundamentals - witness JBIL, up 50% from the low to high of this week! In a
bull market suffering a severe intermediate correction
the best stocks to buy are probably the secondary stocks which got whacked much
worse in the correction, because they will eventually have the better
percentage recovery. However, in a real bear market
secondary stocks will have little recovery before the next downleg.
These secondary stocks are generally what we talk about on this thread. Should

Jeffrey,

Gotta get some sleep, but here's some response

tech stocks have seen a 1990 style correction

Though I would say they started higher this time. For instance, 88-90
Intel's PE ranged from 8 to 16. This year PE hit 24, and even now 18
is the high end of the 86-96 historical range. Seagate was often
in the 3-4 PE range 88-90, with highs around 10-15. This year,
we were valuing it around 25 times strong earnings - for a known
cyclical that is gross error. Compaq same deal - PE 7-14 then,
15-30 this year. So there is a way to fall to hit historic lows on
a valuation basis if things get crunchy this year. It may get
that bad, but not like 73-74 where inflation in the face of
stock market losses made for excruciating pain in real terms.

large stocks could move sideways for an extended period, supported by the
effect of declining interest rates on the capitalization of mediocre earnings

If inflation is only going to be in the 1% range, we're looking at
< 1% change in real rates if not an increase in real rates. This
would be a hidden double whammy along with decreased earnings. The
same factors that are causing the decreased earnings will be
causing the low inflation/nominal rate decreases, which makes it hard
for one to truly offset the other.

while the massacred smaller stocks gradually recover

What a difficult call! Smaller stocks - since so many of them are
valueless techs these days - are so incredibly vulnerable in this
indexing world. They don't participate in the upswings very well
except at the end when institutions are desperate for stocks, then
when things get bad everyone sells them and the rapidity and
illiquidity combine to create disaster. I can't see them recovering
in the face of serial disappointments from the big names, but
that's my guess only...

Ironically, the US taxpayer via the IMF may be supporting the
very import glut that might doom earnings here! An odd form of
double taxation, but I digress...

If we really believe interest rates are going to keep falling to 5%,
there is only one thing to do - go out and load up on 10 and
30 year zeroes like our hero Buffett. It's a leveraged pure play that
will even offer diversification if disinflation plays out against
corporate earnings. If only I had the guts...

On the bright side, if a bear does result from this, you can
bet it isn't the end of the world because currencies will eventually
revert to the mean if not above it and the dollar will once again
get weaker, and those with a long view will truly have an
advantage over the short-termers.

How's that for top-down investing? I'm trying to get it out of
my system but I can't...need someone to slap me around with either
some great value stocks or some great logic that says I'm full
of it.

Good Investing,

That's what I was saying :

Wouldn't that mean real rates are higher
than they were earlier this year despite the fall in the long
bond?

The important point is not that real rates are coming down, but
that they have jumped due to recent disinflation, so we are actually
higher now. Thus, a fall in real rates is necessary just to get
back to where we were the last few years, and hence we do not
and will not have ultra-low real rates to stimulate the market.

In my last post, when I said that we would get no change
or even an increase in real rates I meant in the present and
near future, since nominal rates have not yet caught up. I
was wondering why Jefferey was using capitals, since I agree
with him on a nominal basis.

To read Graham, value investors must always be
comparing stocks to bonds, as they are in direct competition.
All I can think of are long-term Treasuries or zeroes - does
anyone else have any suggestions on how to play bonds/move
funds into bonds if one feels stocks are too pricey relative
to bonds?

My Lord! Has everyone seen this am's Barron's? Nearly every article

Jeffrey and I worked through most of the same stuff early this am. But
I must say that the volume of people in agreement is mildly
disconcerting for this bear.

Paul - I posted this on Nike the night of its earnings release
over on the Buffettology thread - relates to our previous discussion
of Nike on this thread:

Nike in many ways meets many of Buffett's criteria, but
is suffering currently. Looks like its hitting $40 after-hours.
One thing that strikes me is the ballooning AR and Inventory,
their stock buyback in the face of shriveling cash flow, and
their commitment to a $1 billion two-year capital investment
program, all while they tout their financial strength by
pointing to a current ratio of 2.5 that is based on poor quality
assets. I see charges in the future and a management that is
not willing to own up to everything just yet due to fear
of frightening Wall Street even more.

This stock might get really cheap. But Nike won't
stay down forever. Just an idea: file away Nike as a buy
in the $20's and buy in when it gets there. This year
should prove to be an aberration, and there will be less
shares out and improving cash flows/balance sheet once
it is all behind us. Here's hoping the market
gets really inefficient.

Mike and Jeff,

Great discussion. I had been thinking about these things two months ago when I
made posts about building cash and revising thinking about this market. I've
stopped trading, totally revised my market strategy, put monies into a good
place, and am thinking long term.

IMO-
The US is in the early phases of a deflationary cycle.

Interest rates will be lowered by the FED.
Bonds will be falling due to the money flow.
We will slowly see a weakening of the dollar.

We will see a bear market on the DOW and S&P and all stocks selling at lower
PEs. There will be more emphasis on the small and mid caps because the larger
stocks are so overvalued. Companies that have made major expansions this past
year, particularly those that added debt, will have the largest problems
because they've failed to plan for a poor economy. We're entering a new period
of corporate restructuring with the poorly managed companies weeded out.

It is no longer a time to speculate on the market and a time to lock monies
into long term investments. Companies with strong balance sheets and proven
management. More than ever, a time to be in Value Stocks and forget about
playing the games of the last couple of years. I'd forget about diversification
and get into a few really well researched companies that can ride things out,
however long it lasts.

JMHO,
Ron

But what about the large amounts of cash still flowing into mutual funds? By
charter many of these funds must invest in stocks. I've heard financial
commentators claim that the reason for the historic PEs of the past few years
was due to this.

I agree with the points you made and I realize that the "Mutual Fund Inflow"
theory of market expansion can be pretty weak but where does this money go? Can
we have a true bear market without mutual fund outflows? Or merely a
continuation of the sector-specific corrections we've been seeing?

Just curious,

John,

We agree on the rates, but I disagree on debt laden stocks, particularly those
in highly competitive sectors. Any company that is highly liquid can ride out a
poor economy better than one with debt. The US rates have been high compared to
the rest of the world as countries kept rates low to stimulate economies, yet
it is the debt that's causing the current Asian crisis. They were able to
borrow cheaply and they did. The overexpansion from the borrowing has caught up
with them and will soon be a major factor in the US.

I would be very leery of any companies that have shown major growth from
borrowings and look for companies that have grown, yet maintained liquidity. I
would also avoid companies that have used stock for acquisitions as they almost
always paid too much.

The current situation in the market has no economic basis, but we will see a
major fall off. It's mental and, just as it's caused the recent bull market,
when investors run scared the market falls and the economic problems follow. I
don't know if it's going to happen or not, but I believe investors should be
prepared for the worst. Of course, it's this thinking that causes it to happen.

John,

Where is the money that's been put in? Paper profits. And it can go into real
losses.

Can everyone that has money in the market cash out for the amount of their
stock or mutual fund? This is the reason for the flow of monies into bonds. You
don't get the return, but you can get the cash.

IMO - this is the "house of cards" Mike was referring to. How many companies
are paying dividends? What happens when the baby boomers start retiring and
want to convert their growth stocks to income producing assets? Will the
selling of growth stocks be picked up by new investors? Where does the money
come from to replace the money being pulled out?

Another point - with all of the money going in tax free, what will be the tax
rate when those people have to sell assets because the monies isn't in income
producing? Companies deep in debt don't pay dividends!

Another point to consider, though it is somewhat off-topic,
is consumer credit card debt is at 1.2 trillion, which is $4500 for
every man woman and child in America. That is absolutely
staggering. So like half the population has credit cards, and
they on average have 9-10K in high interest debt. How a low
rate/slowing economy will affect that and vice versa will be
interesting. I admit I'm an offender, and I'll welcome lower rates,
but then my job is secure and my wages are pretty sticky. I get the
feeling that people are playing the market with blood money, which
sets us up like the 1920's if th e market crashes severely. This is
just food for thought...

I'm only concerned about this issue because I am having difficulty
finding good values, and having read too much Fisher and
Buffett-stuff lately, I'm reluctant to invest in crappy illiquid
businesses. As of now I hold Deswell (7%) and SJP (10%), and am
coming off a week in which I was short several stocks for several days
and closed out an arbitrage position with some small gains, so
I'm biased - with all this cash I would be lying if I didn't say
I'm rooting for the market to fall.

Mike,

I believe your point about consumer debt to be a big one, I would include
corporate debt that is also very high. The Asian problems can flow to US banks
causing them to tighten policies. The biggest concern now is asset
depreciation. Companies have borrowed against assets that could be greatly
devalued. An Asian company forced to sell a certain asset will devalue that
asset to a US company. If the asset is devalued, the borrowings against it
become overleveraged and the bank gets concerned. This forces the company to
liquidate further devaluing the asset and problems over every company deep in
debt. The highly liquid companies sit around and make the good buys. Anytime
there's a downturn in the economy, those with cash gain while the companies
with debt lose out.

If you are sitting on cash, I give you a lot of credit. Very few are in that
position now. The hardest part will be patience and putting it in the right
places.

I need to clarify an earlier comment about diversification. I strongly believe
a person should NOT concentrate assets into any one area. This might seem a
strange thing for me to say considering my Deswell position, but my market
portfolio is only a small part of my assets. The majority is in a business I
own and income producing properties. Because of the low interest rates, there
are very few good buys around so I decided to put some cash in the market. I
own bonds and other negotiable assets.

After the early '80s experience, I try to stay liquid myself.

For what it's worth,
Ron

Paul I was sincerely touched that anyone remembered the Stein/Wasserman
connection. Boy. FOX. Do I remember that one.

Until Marvin Davis and Marc Rich bought the company nothing got realized from
FOX.Then Rich and Davis got ten dollars for every dollar the sharholders got.

Another media ream the share holders was Metromedia ala Kluge. Shareholders got
one dollar for every share: John Kluge got $10 for every dollar invested (from
Rupert Murdoch). No one seemed to notice. At least in MCA everyone got out on a
level playing field.

I'm not invested in anything except OXHP now. Down 50% in my position in a
month. Bascially, this market is terribly hard to find value in right now. One
tries to find some value but it is tough.

I'd suggest the biotech's when they crash next year: that is, after they go
down from their cyclical highs, where they are about now. Buy a biotech for the
cash in the bank plus say, a 10% premium. IMHO it is still a gamble, however.
But try and get a stock that is really sold down wwith a rproduct in stage III
trials like Xoma.

Asia is a great buy. Where is the bottom in Asia? I think it will come back. I
am close to prayer that it will stabilize.

But really you have to watch what happens next year.

Will the Asian flu spread? I am haunted by the example of the crash of the
Credit Anstalt in Vienna in the 1930's and what that wrought. No one is
mentioning the terrible historical precedent of the Credit Anstalt in regard to
the "Asian flu". So goddamn dismissive, this pop shrug off of the problem in
the financial press...."the Asian flu". Bascially, all credit must be repaid by
the person borrower, or the lendor. Right? I think that is the single immutalbe
fact of economics. With a debt of $5.5 trillion the US can't let this credit
buble burst. This is our ex-President/Movie Star's Alzheimer's legacy to us
all. That is why I use the world haunt. I am haunted by the fact we might not
be able to wriggle out this time from all this debt. Us. The USA. NO Korea. Not
Japan. The US.

Returning to the movie stocks I think all these companies have just about run
out of and beyond their income streams. UA made a $40 million movie that
crashed and burnt. It went down in flames. With a couple of $200 million dollar
movies that go down... even a Time Warner could be in deep trouble. Bascially,
in an economic slow down can you see paying $9 to go to a movie? Hey, you can
count on cable revenues right? But LMDS technology is going to eat cables
lunch.

Gosh. They're going to eat their dinner too.

St. Joe Corp. After doubling my position last week on news, this is now half of
my portfolio. It is a classic asset value investment, even though it is up
about 50% in the last year. It now trades at 90 (52W hi 116, lo around 60) I
think its worth well above 120. A little homework on this one in the next few
weeks would be well worth your time.

The valuation is the key, and I will post that at the end. St. Joe was formerly
St. Joe Paper, a sleepy company controlled for years by a DuPont Trust. The
Company amassed a collection of assets in Florida 50 years ago, then never did
anything with them. Operating businesses and literally 3% of the land in the
state.

The first thing to understand it that this is not a paper company. Most
operating assets, including the paper business, were shed two years ago. The
second thing is that it is no longer a sleepy asset play. The controlling
shareholder announced in May of 96 that it wanted to realize the value of their
holdings. They shed the operating businesses and dividended the cash to
shareholders ($10 dividend in January 97) Then they brought in new management.
The new CEO came out of Disney (a company which knows something about Florida
real estate), and proceeded to replace the entire management team with Wall
Street savvy real estate guys. He has also been purchasing and partnering with
prominent Florida developers.

You could say that's all old news, though I don't think its in the price yet.
But now there is a new catalyst. This is a $3 billion company with no Wall
Street coverage. The stock is so illiquid that only a few institutions
(including Michael Price) own it. So what makes that change? Last week the
company announced that DuPont is going to sell a chunk of its 75% interest in
order to diversify its holdings. There will also be a 3:1 split. What this does
is increase liquidity for both institutional and retail investors. The DuPont
sale is also big enough to require the help of Wall Street. Three of the most
respected firms on Wall Street (Morgan Stanley, Merrill and DLJ) are
underwriting the deal. The have big sales forces and research influence.

OK, here's the valuation. I'll start with the most certain.
1. $19 a share in cash. No debt.
2. SJP owns about 50% of Florida East Coast, which is publically traded. A
little math shows that this trades for $15 per SJP share.
3. An agreement was just announced to sell a parcel of otherwise useless land
for about $4 a share.

OK, so we've got what, $38. The stock trades for $90. Nothing to get excited
about so far.

4. St. Joe owns roughly 900,000 acres of timberland in Florida. There is much
argument about what this is worth, but the figures seem to center around about
$1,000 an acre. That's $30 a share.

Now we've got $68. That leaves $22 to account for. What's left is the fun part.
St. Joe owns 50,000 acres of development land, all in Florida. Much of it is on
the panhandle, but they also own urban land. Nobody really knows where it all
is or what it all is, but its not worthless swampland. For example, they own
miles of prime beachfront on the panhandle and hundreds of miles of inland
waterfront property. I just found out they own at least 6 underdeveloped blocks
in downtown Miami.

Multiply the $22 of the stock price attributed to the land by 30 million
shares. That gives you $660 million. Or $13,000 an acre. Then look at
transactions for development land in the state of Florida. I don't think you
are going to find many for $13,000 an acre. The ones I have seen are $80,000,
$40,000, $120,000... Do your own homework, but this is the story. Florida has
among the best real estate demographics in the country, and we are at the point
in the real estate cycle where quality land prices are about to take off. And
St. Joe is the largest landowner in the state and just starting to milk it.

If you have access to AOL, go to the Motley Fool board for St. Joe and you will
find the best quality research in existence on this stock. Get the financials
and check my facts. If you don't have AOL, contact me privately by e-mail and I
would be happy to send you some key posts from the last year as this story
developed. You will be able to see the dates on the posts and check against a
news history and chart to see that these were not written with 20/20 hindsight.

If I had to put a number on this now, I would say $150. I prefer to think of it
as worth at least $120 - possibly much much more. I would welcome a discussion
from the many knowledgeable, and always skeptical, investors on this board.

James, Re: SJP

Thank you thank you. I bought based on a thumbnail valuation
that almost mirrors yours, although I didn't know about those
Savvy Wall Street Guys and all those details about the land.
I am particularly attracted by the low institutional ownership
at only 20% (and who they are), the activist managment that
cares about the shareholders, and the >tripling of liquidity.

Moreover, it looks like Wall Street is punishing this stock
because in typical knee-jerk fashion they see dilution where
there isn't any - just increased liquidity. How else to explain
the drop upon the positive news? I put part of one trust into it,
and now I'm putting part of the other into it.

Thanks again Jim. Re: my Nike expectations, I have been
very impressed in my experience with the fact that an intelligent
investor can see balance sheet/income statement problems that Wall
Street hasn't yet reacted to or management hasn't owned up
to. By waiting for the news to break, one can often pick up
the shares cheaper. Whether the shares will go up in the meantime
and only fall back to current levels or higher after the news
breaks is up in the air, but I'd rather wait for the cat to
be out of the barn. Nike has troubles brewing that isn't owning
up to, so I think I'll wait.

More on St. Joe's land. Remember, Mr. Market is willing to sell it to you
tomorrow for $13,000 an acre. Raw land is roughly 1/6 of a house price, rule of
thumb as I recall it from my real estate days. Florida home prices for $85,000?
I don't think so.

Disney is selling 1/3 acre lots in its Celbration development outside Orlando
for about $80,000 a lot. That's not raw land, so you've got to adjust for
development costs, but take half of that as a benchmark for, granted, a top
quality property. St. Joe itself is already selling half acre beachfront lots
on the panhandle for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Six blocks in downtown
Miami? You think you could buy that for $13,000 an acre? In addressing the
inevitable counterargument, even if a lot of those 50,000 acres are swampland
(which I don't think is true) these parcels more than make up for it. How about
this - St. Joe closed a condemnation sale to the state of Florida for $120,000
an acre last year. They just announced another sale to the state - I don't have
the figure in front of me, but it was several times the $13,000 benchmark.

[Just a note - in valuing this land, forget about the book value. The company
purchased the majority of its assets in the 1930s. Much of it is still on the
books for like 50 bucks an acre.]

The new CEO (came from Disney) hired a well respected CFO from Promus and a
completely new top management team from Disney and prominent Florida
developers. You'd have had to talk to the old management to really understand
how eager shareholders are to pay these guys whatever they want. Their
background is real estate, Florida specifically. A lot is still unclear, but
the pieces are coming together. Rummell (CEO) will probably take an ad-hoc
approach. Some hotels, some premier housing developments, some office
buildings. He just bought a golf course developer. He has bought one of the top
master planned residential developers in Florida. He has a JV with one of the
top private commercial developers. AND HE OWNS 3% OF THE LAND IN THE STATE. (I
like assets that nobody can replicate - either you own it or you don't.). All
the pieces are now in place, the real estate cycle is perfect for a landowner -
and now we have Wall Street's attention.

(And I suspect that the exposure to Southeast Asia is somewhat less than
multinational darlings that dominate the S+P. Somebody provided me with a link
last week between Southeast Asia meltdown and Florida real estate, but it would
have required the rest of the market to crash first. So if you want to sell
everything, sell this too. But if you'd hold onto one...)

A somewhat more likely scenario, because you can never forget
that this kind of thing can happen, is that big-company stocks will
fall sharply and take the rest of the market with them. Believe
me, if a large-stock correction happens, small stocks will go down, too.
The third and, I think, most likely possibility is that large

James - I am a bit fuzzy on facts here. However, I believe that I am correct
that in most market periods assets like trees, or land, or oil and minerals, or
even stock in other companies tend to get valued at a discount.

The theoretical reason is that the earnings stream from these assets will occur
over an extended, often very extended, period of time. Therefore, the present
value of future earnings from these assets at a reasonable discount rate is
much less than the nominal present value, as if all the value could be realized
today. This is even more important of an issue in times of low inflation, or
deflation, where you can't count on inflation in the value of the asset to
materially reduce the effect of the discount rate.

For example, what do you think the per ounce value of gold in the ground is
today versus 5, 10 or 15 years ago. That is an extreme case
of the timing importance in realizing the value that makes my point, I believe.

OK, I see what you're saying. Obviously a gold mine is not worth the value of
the gold in the ground. There are extraction costs and time value of money to
discount. But it should trade at the value of other similar gold in the ground.
Compare apples to apples. All I am saying is that you can buy St. Joe at a deep
discount to the value of its assets. As long as the company is moving in the
right direction to create shareholder value, I don't much care when they sell
the assets. Florida land is probably going to keep appreciating. Don't read St.
Joe as a liquidation story any more. Now its turning itself into a developer,
for which the net asset value could be treated as a floor, with the value as a
company considerably higher.

The thing is, we only hear about the "asset plays" that trade at big discounts.
There are plenty of others trading at premiums or at the value of their assets.
But in investment lingo, we don't call those "asset plays".

I am leery of stocks that have nearly doubled in the last 12 months,
sell at p/e's of 75, and require "undervalued assets" to justify purchase.
Reread my recent post on the subject. I might add cable TV companies (or HMO
companies) to the list of supposed undervalued asset companies, when looked at
on the basis of so-much per subscriber; or
those Gabelli EBITDA special value companies.

I have nothing against Hyde, especially if Mike can answer my questions
favorably. I might buy some. (But each of my questions is important and for a
reason, especially since this is not a leader in the industry.) I might add one
more question - Is Asia a source of supply or risk of supply interruption for
Hyde or its competitors?
I think you want to understand how Asia might cause its relative competitive
position to change.

To Jeffery and all

Anyone has any ideas what Copper prices will be next year. AR is selling at a
multi year low and half of its book value of $ 42 with over $10 of cash on
hand. AR is also buying back its
stock. Copper may be a better play than gold if US market tanks next year.
However if deflation comes or the economy turns down AR will become cheaper.
See AR CEO's discussion of its prospects.

Re: WDC

I've been following the dd makers for about 6 mos now. I'll save you some time
looking at WDC, SEG & QNTM threads; price erosion has been nasty in the 1 - 4
GB arena and seems to be creeping up to the larger drives as well. Fujitsu,
Samsung (?), & Maxtor have been accused of dumping their drives at less than

the worst shape because they are the last to switch to MR head technology while
QNTM has already succesfully done so. Everything I've read says flat earnings

Jeffrey,

Net nets are played as a basket of them as part of
a diversified portfolio and held for two years and
let go if they haven't moved up 50%. There doesn't need to be
a catalyst. Value guy Nasgowitz of Heartland Value has been
buying and now owns like 24% if I remember right.
In this case there is something of a catalyst, as the company
has been selling off non-core business and concentrating on
the specialty high end triathlete sports along with your
average runner. These serve the same general distribution
channels, and hence profitability is improving. There's
a lot to like here. At a 40% discount to net net any
risk from quality of inventory is negated.

I tried to buy at 3 3/4 today but didn't get it, so then
I tried at 4. Now I'm gonna check and see if I got it.

It has not dropped much more than PD. This says the industry has gotten cheap
not just the company, which means that you have to review the whole industry to
decide the best investment. I read the reference. The only things that turned
me off was initiating a stock buyback program when the stock was very near all
time highs, the dependence on China to keep the industry from having a lousy
tone for the next few years, and the apparent short term dependence of earnings
on recent futures contract sales. Major investment in South America
deserves some haircut.

Copper price is consistent with poor worldwide economies. If you think that is
too pessimistis, then any of these companies is probably a buy. The level and
trend of interest rates in arguably the best economy, the US, suggests that
buying this stock or stocks in general is more speculative than usual. But
there always comes a point where that is reflected in the price. I would
probably prefer to see a few poor earnings comparisons together with some
stability in the price
before buying.

Jyoti Sharma: re copper stocks. I don't believe anyone can predict accurately
copper prices next year. Analysts have recently downgraded at least two of
these stocks - AR and CYM, and one fellow is predicting a further fall in stock
prices about 10-20% from current levels I believe. Nevertheless, current stock
valuations discount a lot of bad that will or could happen. I bought CYM today-
I like that they are diversified (with coal), that they are paying off debt,
and that they pay a good dividend - which I'm expecting will be cut. AR would
also seem to be a good bet (in some ways --a better bet -g-) in which to start
building a position. As you say, AR is at a multiyear low --in a couple of
years stock will (or could or should -g-) be 50% higher. I don't see a
deflationary environment that would really impair the long term viability of
these companies. Paul Senior

Mike - I have been around the market a long time and as you know have spent a
career evaluating more complicated risks than most companies offer.

My biggest problem in picking companies is that I see most of the wolves hiding
behind the bushes and, particularly in technology, do not have the special
expertise to decide which ones I really need to pay attention to. (I am
gradually steering away from such stocks for that reason or concentrating on
electronics distribution or ECM companies where you substantially reduce the
product risk.)

My style is eclectic. I like sound balance sheets. However, I look for
something special that I think will give extraordinary returns and which is
unappreciated by the market. I hate poor mgmt and prefer some sort of
leadership position whereever the company operates. I am very fond of strong
insider buying by many people.

An example. Probably my most successful investment has been COO. I saw
several things - new mgmt restoring profitability, a leading position in its
niche, exceptional insider buying, a balance sheet which was mediocre at the
time but I estimated would look a lot better in one year, accessible mgmt and
astoundingly detailed public reporting. The kicker was 250 million of NOL's
which I saw as giving the company not
just tax free income but a material competitive advantage.

On PD, will look at tomorrow, but generally stick with my last paragraph on AR.
I generally prefer commodity stocks when they have little earnings and these
expansions (that AR talks about) have been shelved/cut back. The current price
of copper is way above the cost of production for the big companies, which has
always been the standard criteria for considering this kind of company. By the
way, if I were to consider them, I would force myself to do a comparative
analysis on the merits of competing natural resource companies, such as paper,
lumber, oil, aluminum, etc. (But not including gold which I never thought had
much merit as a commodity investment.)

Jeffrey Re: HYDEA

1. No insider buying
2. A historic underperformer - current value is at low end of
historic range, but it is an oscillator.
3. relatively little impact from Asia vs peers esp Nike Adidas

I like companies with great management and insider buying -who
doesn't? But there is also a portion of my portfolio for bad
managements mismanaging assets (such as the Saucony and Hind
brands) that would be worth more under different management.
As you know, that one of about 3 things acquirers look for.
If I had 28 million and knew the shoe marketing business, I might
want to take a shot at acquiring the Saucony brand and the Hind
brand on the cheap and improving on them.

But the story here is it is a Graham net net strategy - we
are not counting on better management or acquisition, but rather
that it will fluctuate back to net quick assets as it has in the past.

Looks like net nets wouldn't fit with your style of investing.
I basically agree on PD - profits are still too fat and the PE
is still too low, but I
am interested because PD seems to be the class outfit, and long-term
copper supply/demand characteristics are favorable. Just trying
to time my buy.

HI Jyoti; AR is a good buy at it's present levels. Unless the
whole American Market falls, even then AR is the clear leader
in copper. The other one I liked was PCU of which AR owns
a lot..but it just ran back back from 13 to 14.
The wait Jeffery is talking about, for AR to show stablity in price
is going to be a long long wait..AR don't do that !
AR is played strongly by the same people
who play copper futures. It's a copper play,. so the question
is how long can the Bears keep the price of copper down to
what is now ? and If I wait for copper to
go up, then AR is going to cost more. There is a chance she
will go to 20..but I would not bet on that, odds are
she will make 24 before 20. Even a small move up in copper will
send her up nicely..her hedge position is not there to show
profit..it's there to make it tough on the compeditors..
and to consoladate her leader ship. She can dump copper on the
market after she hedges future contracts ( and does )
the one offsets the other..but puts compeditors at a
disatvantage. I'd rather play copper any day than gold.

Thank you for your views. I agree with your thinking on AR and PCU. My own
'feeling' is that copper prices are down mainly due to perceived lower demand
for copper from Asian countries. I intend to establish position in AR as soon
as Korean situation is stabilized. The problems of Asia are mainly in Korea,
Indonesia and Thailand. China and India are doing okay. Eastern Euorpe, Latin
America and rest of the world will have their normal need for copper next year.
Unlike gold there is no overhang of large supply for copper. I am still hoping

Southern Pacific Funding Corporation is engaged in the business of

Results benefitted from increased gains on the sales of loans, and

E Newman: SFC could very well be undervalued. I looked a while ago and got
scared off (that could be a good sign to buy -g-). Too tough for me to figure
the risks and safety factor(s).
First, it's a small player, and as you know, the big regionals or other banks
are sniffing about for this business. Second, I don't understand or like the
one-to-four family residence idea. Duplexes and fourplexes are tough to own
profitably - in my limited experience - and there are just too many owner
walkaways when things get tough. I don't know how this is covered in the
loans/selling or purchasing or how it might affect SFC. (Not saying that we're
going to have a lot of landlords giving up their places - but rather I lived
through it in Texas, and like generals who fight current battles like they
fought the previous war, I'm too limited in my thinking to be very positive
about multifamily housing like these.) Third, Yahoo says they earn 50% on their
equity. NOBODY can keep those margins. NOBODY. Competition or something (maybe
they'll run out of things to securitize -g-?)will lower them. When (okay,
if)this happens, I figure the stock is a buy at maybe a little down from book
value - say $5, down from current $9 price. And finally, I already have enough
on my plate with "securitization" - I'm sticking as best I can with GNT. Them's

Company also announced that senior management has committed a
significant percentage of their year-end bonus to purchase shares of the
Company's common stock.

''The board of director's decision to institute a repurchase plan
provides an opportunity for dramatic returns on capital invested in our
common stock and increased earnings per share over the long-term. The
Company has significant cash liquidity and believes an investment in its
common stock to be a sound use of capital. Moreover, the decision to
purchase stock with 1997 year-end bonuses reaffirms management's
confidence in future expectations for the Company and the industry,''
commented Robert W. Howard, Vice-Chairman and CEO.

Certain statements contained in this press release, which are not
historical fact, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements under

cause Southern Pacific Funding Corporation's actual results to differ
materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Such
factors include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions,
interest rate risk, prepayment speeds, delinquency and default rates,
changes (legislative and otherwise) in the asset securitization
industry, demand for Southern Pacific Funding's services, the degree to
which Southern Pacific Funding is leveraged, its needs for financing,
and other risks identified in Southern Pacific Funding's Securities and
Exchange Commission filings.

I am no accountant, but bankruptcy in most cases is because of cash flow which
in the formal meaning of the word has really nothing to do with how much debt
(LT or even ST) a company has, or how it specifically compares to a comapny's
cash reserves. This has to do with being able to meet immediate operational
expenses. Technically speaking, a debtless company can go bankrupt. In other
words, the question should be how liquid is this company is in the short term
in its efforts to meet their operating costs.

One aspect of this with a given company is how does working capital compare to
quarterly operational expenses, and then to current liabilities as a measure of
their liquidity, in other words the company's ability to meet necissary current
expenses. Part of this depends how liquid their current assets actually are.
The other more important aspect of this picture relates to how the company is
managing its operational expenses in relationship to income. This refers to the
company's ability to generate cash beyond that of their operational expenses,
or how quickly they can arrive at this place before their cash reserves runs
out. Their cash generation ability is impacted by their ability to manage A/R.
This IMO is the "acid test". Next comes generating cash to meet current
liabilities. If they have good credit with their suppliers, they probably can
have their credit extended with them. Low debt can also help here which will
help make the cost of servicing debt manageable, for if they default even on a
comparatively small debt paymernt, that creditor can force the company into
bankruptcy. Still, there is room for negotiation here. So this aspect of the
picture at least for the near term is not as important as being able to manage
immediate operational costs and A/R, given the current revenues that they have
to work with. Cash in the bank helps here since it is unlikely that the company
is efficient enough in their cash generating capability where they can survive
strictly on the cash they can generate from their revenue as they do business.
The next avenue for cash is aquiring ST debt which is not easy to do unless it
has been preestablished such as in the form of a revolving credit line with a
bank. Also, there is the higher cost of servicing ST debt. Otherwise, it is
much easier to have suppliers extend credit to the company.

Finally comes the consideration of generating new sales. This costs money.
However, if the company cannot manage to sustain itself on its current revenue,
then the company is forced to fight a losing battle. Thisis because generating
new sales costs money and time, both of which the company may not have
available to it. Restructuring may help here, but there are costs to the
restructuring process itself, both in terms of money and opportunity costs of
being dificient of resources that may be needed at a date in the near future in
order manage the results of a successful marketing campaign which once again
come at a later time.

In summary, determine operational expenses seperate from debt servicing costs.
Compare this figure to the cash the company can generate from its current
revenue which relates to the current revenue compared with A/R turnover. Next,
look at cash and compare this to the comapny's quarterly operating expenses. If
the company's financials make it this far, then add in the costs to service
debt. The actual figure for this will depend on the arrangement they can make
with their suppliers and creditors. One assumption can be the interest expense
of current LT and ST debt. Another is the coversion of ST debt into interest
free longer term debt through extention of favorable credit terms from their
suppliers. Finally, look at the prearanged lines of credit currently available
to the company.

Just some thoughts. Notice how current ST and LT debt figured peripherally into
this analysis? Comments anyone?

The numbers you have quoted are from Yahoo? Yahoo often has major errors in
data. For another look at the PCU's recent performance try:

http://www.dailystocks.net/data/P/PCU3.html
http://sec.yahoo.com/e/97/11/13/pcu.html

PCU has increased it's debt load from 166 mil. to 255 mil. Company's
fundamentals have not changed significantly over the last one year. Increase in
debt load may due to a significant number of environmental capital
expenditures.

PCU is a copper stock controlled by AR. Stock Price is a call on future copper
prices. The dividend is not secure. They have a history of adjusting dividends
based on copper prices. Personally I think it's a good buy now even with the
expected declines in earnings next year. Wall street however punishes stocks
when the earnings decline. I am still looking to buy this stock below 12.

Good investing and happy new year.

James, sorry, I didn't mean to imply the 2 were the same, I was following LA
about a year ago with the intent of buying their convertible bond, even did
some "field research", fortunately for me I didn't pursue LA. As a runner I am
interested in the different shoe companies (It really is a fairly small
family), which IMO are just marketing companies, pushing their brand names. Yes
I agree that Hyde is much much stronger and a good "Value Investment", its
interesting to me how their finacials can vary so much from a basket case(LA)
to a fat cat(Hyde). Scott

Mike & Jyoti, Thanks for the response on PCU.

I did wonder about the numbers for this on Yahoo.

On the + side, they have had +ve earnings and the PE is reasonable.

thanks again.

Bob,

Excellent post about importance of cash flow reserves and debt.

Too often overlooked and crucial, particularly in growth companies. One of the
big problems facing many tech stocks is borrowing to make expansions into a
declining market. Banks can be very understanding when loaning monies and
collecting interest, but make a complete reversal when a company starts to
struggle.

Good post,
Ron

E,

IMO - JWC is a $16 stock selling below $12. They brought in $4.5M cash from the
AGRO acquisition in addition to the $8M they already had. This money has been
invested and, from their track record, one can assume they have put it in good
places. They likely won't realize the gains until there's more market recovery.
I had sold mine at 13.5 and just bought back at 11.75 looking for 18-20 end of
June.

For what it's worth,
Ron

Thankyou for your feedback. I am just relating here what I have been able to
observe and learn for myself. I have not found a book yet that covers the
"practical" aspects of evaluating a company's financial position, such as some
of the issues that I have adressed in my previous post. Most books provide a
"fomulistic" approach without providing any context to understand what is
behind those figures and what the financials can reveal in terms of how the
business is being run. I have found a couple worthwhile books that do cover
detecting some of the "creative" accounting techniques that many companys
appear to utilize in their financial reports, particularily the high-tech
companies.

Any accountants or auditors that can help me out here?

E,

Additional comment on JWC.

Listed 34th Forbes best managed companies in US.

Over the last 5 years:
Rev growth of 222%
Earnings growth of 178%
EPS growth of 405%. Over 80% per year average EPS growth!!
BV over $6.00/S, Cash over $3.50/S
It's now selling at 1.8 BV, PE of 7.4, 3.24 x cash

They have historically managed cash extremely well. End of September they
acquired AGRO for shares, adding $4.8M cash to reserves. Doing this at that
time, they diluted earnings 10%, but had not been able to put the cash to work.
They got control of the cash just before the market fell and have been
investing it. All indications are that they will not only continue growth, but
at a faster rate than in past.

In addition to this, they are prime for acquisition or quality merger and it's
likely they will declare a stock dividend within 6 months.

Compared to other similar companies in the brokerage sector, they are
undervalued. Considering their historical growth, a real bargain.

Last Q they reported .62 EPS. It is very likely they can have '98 calendar
earnings of at least $2.50 or 4.6 PE to current price.

Price ran up due to an article in some magazine (forget which) and there's now
some selloff for taxes. There will be renewed interest in it early next year
and we now have a good buy opportunity.

For what it's worth,
Ron

1998 Outlook.
FWIW, here's my predictions for the new year. There's no guarantees, so don't
bet the ranch or anything.

1. Electric Utilities will be hot (on a risk/reward basis), with total returns
of 20-35%.

Over the next few years, industry consolidation and deregulation will unlock
tremendous shareholder value and generate tangible savings to customers. The
coming wave in utilities will be similar to what's happened to banking and
telecommunications, but of much greater magnitude. Look for utilities with
strong management, large economies of scale, aggressive strategies, strong cash
flow, and minimal nuclear exposure.

2. Internet stocks will be one of the hottest sectors of 1998.

Microsoft's purchase of HotMail (and its 9 million email accounts) for a
rumored $400 million in stock is a powerful sign of the value being created on
the Internet. Internet ad growth should at least double (1997's ad revenue was
triple 1996's), driving valuations in the search engine companies. As bandwidth
inevitably increases due to 56K, xDSL, cable modems, ISDN, or whatever,
Internet companies look better and better.

3. The Nikkei, surprising almost everyone, will surge to 20,000.

Japan's Nikkei is very close to the bottom now, and Goldman Sachs' recent deal
to purchasing Japanese loans will prove to be extremely prescient. Reforms and
increased disclosure will do much to address Japan's financial ills. Moreover,
Japan's central bank will finally wise up and increase the money supply,
lifting the economy out of its multi-year malaise; this would help Southeast
Asia, too.

4. Secondary stocks will have a very good 1st quarter.

Year-end tax selling and window-dressing pressures are now over, and many
quality NASDAQ midcaps/smallcaps are oversold. Fund managers will be looking at
tantalizing bargains as we enter 1998, and strong fund inflows will provide a
nice boost.

5. The Dow will reach 10,000.

Overall market reaction over the last few months to SE Asian events has
demonstrated that the U.S. is relatively resilient. Low interest rates, low
inflation, strong fund inflows, strength in Japan, and stabilization in SE Asia
should provide a sunny market environment.

6. My favorite company for 1998 is Checkpoint Software (CHKPF). 

It appears to have outstanding growth potential, dominant market share in
Internet firewalls (42+ %), superb net margins (50+ %), cutting-edge
technology, smart management, and a spotless balance sheet. The future of
corporate intranets, Internet commerce, and corporate websites are the
fundamental underpinnings for Checkpoint's outlook.
