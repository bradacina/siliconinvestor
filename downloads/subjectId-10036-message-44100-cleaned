Diversification -

Well, after all the warnings I was giving people about diversification early in
the year (I'm not initially going to go in much detail here, unless someone is
interested as I'm not proud of it) but let's just say that I managed to build
up a 40% portfolio position in an E&P, buying at what I considered 'crazy
prices' on the way down.

This somehow worked for me (as of today at least...), getting me back to index
performance for the year (still at a loss, yes), but it was a nasty roller
coaster and drove me to drink extra beers on my pergola on more than one day
this summer.

So, when I keep talking about rotating into some diversified cef's trading at a
discount instead of individual stocks, this is one of the major reasons why. I
need to step on the diversification pedal...

Selling my higher priced shares of ERF and plan to reenter at lower prices (You
mentioned $22.56 on 8/10 was your last purchase). That's my target range. I am
finding more attractive, high dividend payers in other sectors. This seems like
a good opportunity to harvest the losses and move the proceeds into these other
value buys.

Other candidate buys I am looking at do not have the Foreign Tax withholding.
Money will probably find a home in another sector.

From my quick review of their quarterly report, Solar accounst for about 13% of
their business. Sales were off YOY but everything else was too. They
restructured the division writing down some inventory and/or equipment so that
impacted their overall margins.

I had owned this company about 18 months ago with high expectations that their
Solar division was an undervalued hidden asset. I was basing this on what
Cypress Semiconductor did in Solar several years earlier. I ended up selling
out my tracking position as it never accounted for any significant sales.

Now that I revisited their financials, I am a bit impressed that their Energy
and Environmental Solutions business now accounts for 13% of their total sales
up from 10% last year.

With a Forward PE of 8.38 and the possibility of higher margins (after the
restructure) from their Energy and Environmental Solutions division it may be a
value candidate. I do like the company's LT debt profile (very small LT debt
compared to their annual net income).

My value Tech investments are MSFT, INTC and CSCO. I recently sold a few shares
of INTC thinking I can reenter at lower levels. I have yet to start a position
in CSCO but it is high on my watch list. After my review of AMAT, I see it as a
value candidate (similar to CSCO) and may add a tracking position on any
significant sell off.

I like to move money into new sectors and Tech is looking interesting (at least
several of the legacy tech companies) again for me.

I have added AMAT to my tech watch list.

AMAT. Haven't listened to conf. My opinion is different from yours though.
Solar was down this quarter in reading their quarterly . I believe they may
have outlooked better -- outlooked improvement -- going forward. Solar only a
relatively small portion of AMAT's business.

My interpretation of what's happening is this: China gov't is forcing Chinese
companies to produce solar "stuff" in excess of what demand currently is. Which
means no company can compete and make a profit. Which maybe (?) means demand
for AMAT solar equipment will not improve unless demand somehow improves enough
to catch "excess" supply.

It's one of the reasons though that I gave up on AMAT now. (Even though solar
is that small portion of AMAT's business.)

I acknowledge I may be totally wrong on what's happening as regards
China/solar/AMAT.

Hi Paul

My only other solar play in China is EI DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD). I have
had a pretty good run with this one. DD has Chinese JV partners in two new
Solar manufacturing plants located in China. After several years manufacture
solar panels, they finnaly have a good foot hold in China. It's still a small
percentage of DD' total revenue maybe 5% (up from less than 1%). It could
approach 10% or about $3B in 18-24 months especially w/ this new China "build
solar" directive. Pretty much every panel produced in these two new facilities
are sold to Chinese customers. The earlier thought was panels manufactured in
China would be shipped to Europe and/or U.S.

My thinking with AMAT was their SOLAR sales now approaching 13% with expanding
margins (after the restructure) and a lower overall Forward PE of 8 from the
analysts might make it a possible GARP "value" Buy. I thought they actually
shut the division down because of their inefficiency in their first generation
equipment w/o any positive outlook. I guess things changed.

I believe SOLAR will eventually be a disruptive technology as efficiencies
increase and the price of energy increases (especially coal in China). If the
U.S. is going to be the leader in the technology advancement, companies like
AMAT IMO must innovate the next generation equipment.

I think at somewhat lower prices it may be worth a tracking position. That was
one of the reasons I have kept 50% of my DD shares. It's off 22% from my
earlier sales but still up 80% from my buys in 2008 (thanks to their Solar
division).

Maybe AMAT can be a player here.

P.S. I also added HPQ to my value tech watch list but it's still smells
especially w/ the current BOD (they showed all resign) and new management. This

EKS and Paul,

again, I'm just trying to understand events here, but my impression from the
call is AMAT feels they are close to "maintenance" levels of spending - close
to what companies have to spend just to stay in the game. I think I had
previously just seen a summary of the call but just read through the call just
now. Alot it I didn't understand, esp the technical details, but just trying to
catch the theme and spirit of the responses.

In solar there was a comment regarding just to sell panels anymore you've got
to be able to reach certain efficiencies and that also drives alot of the older
equipment out. I got the vibe that several of the analysts were surprised by
AMAT's strong outlook for solar - lots of the questions around that. AMAT was
confident in both US and German spend - noting several concentration based
solar installations (focus sun energy with mirrors) were being changed to PV
given change in economics, and they were also still strong on Germany. I got
the impression they felt China would pick up installations also.

The other theme was - customers are pushing out orders reluctantly. This
doesn't look like a deep hard crash to them - more of a shallow dip with maybe
bottom around Dec or early 2012. They think there's too many cool products out
there that consumers want in the mobility space.

again, just my interpretation based on reading through - but AMAT mgmt sounded
more upbeat than I think folks were expecting. just my $0.02 though - --- I am
looking to catch the next upcycle on some of these though. I'm in ASML right
now, and am long INTC - but could easily see myself adding a few more - perhaps
AMAT, but there's lots of these showing up on my screens right now which led me
to start looking into them again. FWIW - it doesn't hurt that AMAT seemed to
bottom somewhere in the 8s in the crash of 2008 - not far from there right now,
and this doesn't feel anything like 2008 to me.

just a brief update on aab.to- they have a concentrated investment in sullidan
sue.to which is very active in peru. peru has recently been beset by political
issues but it sounds like the mining industry is close to agreement on new
royalty rates which will restore some stability to that country in dealing with
the miners. It sounds to me like aab management is confident that the stock is
way undervalued or they would not continue to hold so much of their capital
close to $28mm out of $117MM in one company. I hope they are right.

I find it interesting that Barrons which has never been bullish on gold or gold
mining stocks, has produced 2 or three negative articles about gold in this
weeks issue. I have no idea what will happen with gold over the next year or so
but I dont see why people would sell except in response to the commodity
xchanges raising their cash requirements for future positions. just looks like
another boon for insiders to capitalize on non public info.
however it seems to me that having a another commodity market in china will
still lesson the impact of that.
I guess the popularity of the gld etf comes at the expense of investments in
gold miners, which to me seem way undervalued relative to gold itself.

Venoco CEO's go-private offer values co at $770 million
Mon Aug 29, 2011 9:10am EDT
http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/29/us-venoco-idUSTRE77S2C420110829?feedT
pe=RSS&feedName=innovationNews&rpc=43

BANGALORE (Reuters) - Venoco Inc's (VQ.N) chief executive and top shareholder
offered to take the natural gas producer private, valuing the company at about
$770 million at a time when low gas prices and higher costs are weighing on the
sector.

From the article:"...The proposed price of $12.50 a share by Venoco's CEO
Timothy Marquez, who owns half the company's shares, is 44 percent below the
stock's 52-week high of $22.46 in February.

However, the proposal is a 39 percent premium to Friday's closing price.
Marquez shares rose 34 percent before the bell on Monday on the New York Stock
Exchange.

The stock's weakness mirrors that of other companies as natural gas prices have
slumped 6 percent to $3.88 per million British thermal units.

Marquez's proposal comes when Venoco looks to offset low gas prices by
investing heavily in the oil-rich Monterey shale formation. It spent about half
its capital expenditure on the shale in its most recent quarter...."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------

You were correct in your valuation analysis but Mr. Market just did not see it
the same way you or the CEO did. Stock is only getting back to the June 2011
values, still off 50% from the highs of $22.00 earlier this year. In
perspective, stock is still trading at late 2009 levels.

My take away is there is value in the accumulated assets the company owns. CEO
shifted strategy to more oily shale plays from earlier NG ventures. That's not
to say that the proven reserves they have in NG are worthless but rather they
are being priced at the worst case scenario while the capital invested in the
new oily shale areas are seen as producing dry holes (primarily because of the
drilling moratorium in Monterey).

FWIW I gave up on PVA and sold 75% of my very high priced shares and may
reenter the position in 31 days. The PVA story reminds me of VQ as the company
is spending new monies drilling in nw oily shale areas and have quite a few
producing NG properties. Both stocks off more than 50% from earlier year highs.

I think we may see more of these sold off small E&P companies get picked up buy
private equity or larger developers because it is the value of their
in-the-ground assets that make the acquisitions so attractive.

This one caught my attention too. Although they do not pay a dividend, they
have a low PE, are in a good sector that will allow future growth with their
value added process technology and before their recent acquisition had an
excellent LT debt profile when compared to their annual net income ( close to
1:1).

Also, I was not sure if the recent acquisition impacted how their BV was
calculated. The recent acquisition equals $993M and probably includes a lot of
goodwill w/ no direct tangible value. It still looks like a good fit but for
them to accomplish the recent purchase they had to take on some debt. The new
long-term financing includes:

* a $200 million multi-currency revolving credit facility, due 2016, which is
undrawn at closing
* a $100 million Term Loan A due 2016
* a $350 million Term Loan B due 2017
* and a 175 million Euro Term Loan B due 2017

Until I can see the combined financials, their excellent long term debt profile
is now only OK with a 7:1 ratio LT Debt/ net annual income. Before the purchase
it was 1:1. Still in an acceptable range but does this close to $1B purchase
lower their Forward PE and/or increase revenues substantially and/or open up
new markets for the company.

From the article:"...Randolph McDuff may be the best stock picker the world has

"Discipline" and "patience" are probably the two most valuable words in value
investing. It stands to reason, then, that few places would serve as better
incubators for a value investor than The Pas, in Manitoba. Close to polar bear
country, where Hudson Bay winds chill the air to 40 degrees below zero and the
wait for spring lasts eight months, The Pas is the hometown of Randolph McDuff,
a stock picker with an astounding record.

Since McDuff began running his RMG ValueCatalyst small-company fund eight years
ago, he has earned a compound annual return of 36.4%. Not a single diversified
stock fund in Lipper Analytical's universe of 1,555 mutual funds can match
that. Ken Heebner's CGM Focus Fund comes closest at 32.2% a year over the same
period. McDuff's RMG Value Oriented Growth, which buys large companies like
Bayer (nyse: BAY - news - people ) and Fresenius Medical, comes in third at
25.5%. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (nyse: BRK - news - people ) has
returned a compound annual 11% over that period; the s&p 500, 1.1% (including
dividends)...."

You were right that the company had good assets with a smart family owned
operator/management team. The company continues to be profitable w/ a trailing
PE of 15 and no debt even as they expand their mining operations. Stock is up
over 60% since you first mentioned it back in March 2011. Unfortunately, I sold
my small tracking position for a 35% gain recently when gold prices reached all

I own many other producing gold mining stocks (some even pay dividends) but
none of the Jr miners like RIC. RIC has been one of the best performers I have

mine expansion. Gold hitting new all time highs has also helped.

I assume the plan is ltb&h. She does not trade (unlike most on this thread :P).

She likes it for Peter Lynch reasons. She shops at Stop&Shop and she says that
it's always crowded. Shaws next to us closed last year - it was empty most of
the time - and now local Stop&Shop has pretty much zero competition in about
2-3 mile radius. Obviously, this is just a small part of AHONY, so the reasons
are a bit simplistic. :)

Personally, I also like the stock. They cleaned up the balance sheet well, they
bought some of the Shaws closed stores at probably cheap prices. Europe-side is
doing OK, although I don't know much about competitive pressures there. So I
may even buy more in my portfolio. :)

re Groceries - i'll pass on SVU for the following reasons
- tough sector that is suffering from what i think is permanent margin pressure
- unionized grocers fight with one hand tied to the back
- I am not impressed by the Albertson and Ralph's market close to me.

I believe DEG or AHONY are worth a look. Much better balance sheet and lower
EV/EBITDA valuation. At least DEG is not unionized as far as I can tell.

TESCO is still an international growth story. If it falls below 18$, i'll buy a
first lot. As for food companies, I am currently in China and really like how
Nestle (NSRGY) is positioned here. They get a fair share of shelf space in
supermarkets, their products are prices somewhat above local competitors but
not excessively so (more like 10-20%). Since there are so many food scandals in
China (newspaper are full of reports), i believe foreign brands can easily hold
their own against local competitors because consumers will trust them more. I
still own most of my NSRGY shares bought in 2009 and those in 2003. I think it
is just a great LT growth story.

Have you run across any value added food processors/distributors not in the
retail sector? I am looking for something that may process either generic or
banded products but also have niche distribution markets. Anything
international would also be a plus.

As I investigate the AG food process chain (from farm to retail), I think there
is opportunity for more consolidation in this sector as evidenced by the recent
ConAgra Foods $4.9 Billion proposed Acquisition of Ralcorp Holdings. Cargall
has been the one that seems to be buying many of these value added processors
but they are privately held.

The only companies I have been able to come up with are ADM and CAG. Maybe
Nestle may be eying some of these acquisitions.

<u>Nestle May Aim to Rebuild in Chinese Baby Food With Pfizer Unit</u>
By Dermot Doherty - Aug 8, 2011 3:00 PM PT
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-08/nestle-may-aim-to-rebuild-in-chinese-b
by-food-with-pfizer-unit.html

From the article:"...Nestle has made 19 acquisitions since the end of 2009,
according to Bloomberg data. The company has said it plans to use its cash of
more than 16 billion Swiss francs ($21 billion) to invest in existing
businesses and make “bolt-on” acquisitions....".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------

The valuation on Nestle looks reasonable with a trailing PE of 4 and forward PE
of 13. An excellent debt profile of 2:1 where total LT debt is only twice
annual net income. According to the article they have $21B in cash to deploy
for acquisitions.

Although the company is not at a screaming BUY level but still below it's 200
day MA, I will start a tracking position and throw it in my AG basket.

WILC came in with a solid q earnings report and the stock price hasn't budged.
The cash per share is now at about $4 and they have quietly initiated two new
product launches that will add to the bottom line in the
next quaterly report ( a deal with Del Monte and another with an Italian ice
cream co.). The cash makes WILC a takeover candidate but based on the
conference call its more likely that WILC be buying back their shares,
initiating a dividend or acquire another company in the near future. Meanwhile
the shekel keeps gaining against the dollar and the potential for another round
on Fed easing is growing.

WILC's small float makes it attractive
for me to hold and wait for news to develop. The acquisition angle is now six
months old and hasn't come around but while waiting the underlying fundamentals
have become stronger.

G. Willi Food-International Ltd. (WILC)

This one is an attractive Value Buy IMO. Stock trades very thinly and one must
be patient when buying or selling shares. That said the stock has one of the
best debt profiles I have seen with net annual earnings 3x that of their total
debt. Stock selling below BV and has an attractive PE.

Although not a direct intermediary food processor, they do service the
wholesale distribution chain with specialty value added food products. It's
also a niche play on Israel and provides a modest hedge against a falling
dollar.

I am not too interested in their retail and/or wholesale distribution network
(except for their niche regional market), but with the cash in the bank and the
profitability of their operation, I could see a larger integrator scope this
one up. A company like SYSCO could be a potential candidate.

This one was mentioned in April 2011 at $7.50/share. Based on their most
current earnings report and the drop in shares value (23% drop) I will put A
GTC order in at somewhat lower levels.

Total revenues are still under the radar screen for most of the conglomerates
but they continue to grow them (10% YoY) and are now nearly $100M. A small
tracking position will allow me to watch how this one develops. Upside w/o an
acquisition could be 38%, downside appears small.

re MDT

MDT suffers from the Pfizer disease <pun intended> - they use their FCF to
acquire companies, take costs out, milk them - rinse and repeat. What they
cannot do any more is innovate and grow organically. What Pfizer and MDT do is
a very expensive way to maintain their business (they don't grow any more
despite the acquisitions). The FCF number is misleading since the funds are
spent for acquisitions. Also note that MDT debt has been rising steadily.
I think it is a value trap or worse - unless they have a new leadership that
pursues innovation and organic growth, I take a pass (and yes I did own it in
the past).

I am targeting around ~20-25% cash at the prevailing conditions. I have gone as
high as 50% in march 2011 and as low at 10% in the May 2010 to Sept 2010
timeframe. I feel that shareprices are a lot determined by macro and sentiment
so I adjust my cash level to take advantage of market swings.

I feel that there is a pretty much a binary situation - If Europe goes to crap
- we are going to breach the 1000 level with the SP500 - if things stay calm
for a while, we should at least go to ~1350 (the former top), muddling along
will probably keep us where we are with a shallow upward bias.

My sense so is that the question is not if but when a default occurs in Europe
and I do not know how contained that situation will be and what the outcome
will look like. We also have some macro risk coming from China (overheating
followed by a RE bust) that needs to be watched carefully. The Chinese

Earnings down 35%, Dividend cut to follow. A- credit rating at risk and they
need to keep it, otherwise their merchant energy buiz is toast (my take). They
intend to sell treasury shares worth 2.5BEuro to beef up the balance sheet , in
addition they plan on selling several energy business units ( grid networks,
stakes in power plant, the oil exploration business) for 11B Euro and reduce
Capex to 4B Euro annually. All this will reduce the earnings power of course.

Their gas merchant business with Gazprom is sucking wind big time because
prices are indexed to crude (boy who agreed to this idea) and they are now
renegotiating. Improvements on this end not expected before 2012....

Well these are my notes. They forgot to give an earnings forcast - my guess is
probably 3-4 Euro/share. if one is willing to hold for quite some time, this
may work out but it's a longer shot. EON may be in better shape but I have not

I have not come across any new ideas in the food value chain. Since I am here

reading about more investment in the seed industry which may include foreign
investment (= joint ventures). With the IP issues in China, I think it will be
hard to convince foreign companies to put their know how into joint ventures
though.

I also read the other day that they want to consolidate the fragmented grain
and rice processing business to make it more competitive. My take is that they
want to keep both the see and the processing business in domestic hands.

As for Nestle, I am very sure they do not plan on backwards integration - they
have done away with it over the years and getting rid of bulk business but
strengthening the customer facing value aspects. Unilever has done the same - i
don't think they will do a 180Deg turn on that.

Nestle is not cheap but it's simply the best managed food company out there,

Seadrill Limited Ordinary Share(NYSE: SDRL )

Fredriksen expands his empire into well drilling and services through Archer
and the acquisition of Great White Energy Services. Great White Energy Svs
looks like a "pure play" for U.S. energy shale drilling in the Eagle Ford
region. Today's buy by Seadrill (aka Fredriksen) gives them a 39.81% interest
in Archer Ltd. The buy was done as a private placement by Seadrill and Archer
Ltd.

Seadrill seals $80m in Archer shares
01 September 2011

Rig owner Seadrill has upped its holding in well services player Archer after
snapping up a raft of shares in a private placement.

Web site of well service companies:

Archer The Well Company: http://www.archerwell.com/page/2/who-we-are.htm 

Archer is the well company, a global oilfield service company specialising in
drilling services and well services. We employ over 7,000 people unified by a
single purpose: building better wells to help our customers produce more oil
and gas.

Formed in 2011, Archer is the coming together of two well specialist companies,
Seawell and Allis-Chalmers Energy, and several complementary businesses, each
with a deep heritage in delivering wells and improving well performance.

Great White Energy Services: http://www.greatwhiteenergy.com/ 

Great White Energy Services is a diversified oilfield service company that does
completion and production, horizontal and directional drilling. Headquartered
in Oklahoma City, Great White provides industry-leading pressure control
service, directional drilling, and pressure pumping.

Pretty cool video explaining Great White Energy Services:

I recently started a position in Seadrill on 8/1/2011 and have my eye to buy
more shares on any move below $30.00/share. I like their position in Archer Ltd
(a 39% interest) and the services that Great White Energy provides. So you
participate in the FCF that these service companies generate while earning a
nice dividend from the parent company. Archer LTD is traded in the pink sheets
but I saw no trades and suspect it is thinly traded. It looks like SDRL is a
better one to accumulate and hold.

The value proposition for the combined companies is quite nice. You can buy all
of them through SDRL at a Forward PE of 9. SDRL also has a good debt profile
with LT debt to Annual net income at a 4.72:1 ratio, just outside the 4:1 ratio
I like.

Hi MCSweet -

Possible REIT regulation - I wonder what impact this might have on the
preferreds. I would think it would be a positive as any reduction in leverage
and/or common share dividends would make the probability of the preferred
income stream stronger and less likely to default. It's still a company
specific thing. I have noticed that some of the REITs preferreds I follow have
sold off a bit in the last few days (maybe 2-3 %).

Annaly Capital Management Inc C(NYSE: NLY ) might be one name that could be
impacted. They have a preferred Annaly Capital Management Inc P (NLY-PA) 7.67%
but it sells above Par and I would have no interest in it. Do any other Reit
Mortgage names come up?

It will be interesting to see if their proposed regulation extends past REIT
mortgage companies and into any REIT that exceeds certain maximum leverage
amounts.

The SEC's regulation is too little too late as usual.

years dividend.

No position yet but I am strongly considering. They have good management, IMO.
Stock is way cheeper than comparable US companies.

re BAYRY @60.2$ - well with Germany down 3% tonight - i bought some, so i
better like it :0. Another one I am looking at is HENKY (HEN.DE) a german
consumer products and adhesive manufacturer (Loctite, UHU etc.) The HEN.DE
nonvoting shares trade at a PE of ~11 (voting shares around 14). I did buy some
in 2008 at lower prices and the company performed quite well. if the shares get
a little closer to 30 Euro, I will buy some as well.

HENKY has a great LT track record and also is cheaper than comparable US
companies. They have worldwide operations and the adhesives operations, while
cyclical is a secular growth story, since more and more stuff is being glued
(cheaper than welding,using fasteners or alternative methods of
bonding/connecting parts together).

Hi EKS,

I think this only impacts mortgage REITS, and their preferreds are mostly above
par (except a convertible preferred of ANH which is more tied to the stock
price), so nothing to do there.

This should not impact regular REITs.

Best,
MC

Anybody here following/own First Niagara Financial (FNFG). Obviously not in a
go to place for the moment. However, yields north of 6%, and the dividend has
been raised consistently, albeit slowly and in small increments, since 2003. It
was dropped in 2002, do not know the reason for that.
I do know the company has acquired branches from HSBC in western and upstate
NY, as well as making other strategic acquisitions throughout the northeast.
A very quick scan has indicated it is a well run bank, non performing loans at
3/31 were at .75%.

Bayer AG (BAYRY.PK)

This is one I have not followed too much but the name has come up when I was
looking into AG crops as well as Animal drugs. They carry a bit more LT debt
than I like when compared to their net annual income (5.6:1) but with a forward
PE in the 8's it is in my Value range. When I derive a price based on a 4%
dividend return, I come up with a stock price of $51.00/share. Therefore, I put
in a GTC order for a tracking position at this price.

After I do a bit more research on their AG subsidiaries and find more positives
than negatives, I may step up and move my entry price higher. I do recall some
cross contamination of genetic rice strains that the company had to settle. It
was pretty large around $750 million.

<u>$750 Million Settlement Reached in Bayer Cropscience Rice Contamination
Litigation</u>
Attorney Don Downing of the St. Louis law firm Gray, Ritter & Graham, and Adam
Levitt of the Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz law firm in Chicago, were
the court-appointed co-lead Plaintiff’s counsel in the multi-district
litigation in U.S. federal court.

http://www.prweb.com/releases/personal-injury-law-firm/best-attorneys-Missouri/
rweb8605142.htm

From the article:"...July 07, 2011

A three-quarters of a billion dollar legal settlement (case no. 4:06 MDL # 1811
CDP U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri) has been reached between
Germany based Bayer AG and its affiliates, and U.S. rice farmers. This
settlement relates to legal actions filed beginning in 2006 in response to
contamination of the U.S. rice supply by Bayer’s experimental and unapproved
genetically modified Liberty Link rice.

Bayer has agreed to pay up to $750 million in damages to U.S. rice farmers,
plus all administrative costs. According to court documents, this settlement is
in addition to previous settlements in which Bayer has already agreed to pay to
some plaintiffs in the litigation, which include farmers, rice exporters, rice
importers, rice mills and rice seed dealers. ...".

As a result I am not sure where they stand on their future development/research
in this area. There was some speculation that they were going to get out of the
seed business altogether but I just do not know.

Bayer was one of the other drug companies that was looking at Pfizer's animal
health business. They have a better chance of negotiating a deal than LLY since
LLY was only looking at a few specific pieces where Bayer would take the whole
business as long as the price was right.

Therefore, Bayer has several positive things working for them but when I ran
across their recent experimental rice litigation settlement, I felt it was
better to wait to see how things sorted out before I stepped up and started a
position.

FNFG. Have looked at it. It's okay at my surface check. I'm suspicious though
of the business environment it has branches in -- upstate NY, so I'll pass.

KBW Finds 16 “Safe Haven” Bank Stocks

By Avi SalzmanInvestors without a healthy appetite for risk have likely been
shying away from banks stock for the past couple of weeks. But it doesn’t
necessarily make sense to avoid the sector altogether, particularly as strong
companies get sold off along with weak ones. Banks that return cash to
investors and generate consistent earnings could be worth buying, note analysts
at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods.

“In this context, we are interested in safe haven ideas that offer attractive
dividend yields, have steady earnings streams and generate solid returns in
excess of their cost of capital to investors,” the analysts write. “The stocks
that we are highlighting in this note are not necessarily cheap stocks, but we
believe these franchises can justify higher valuations given the returns they
generate above their cost of equity.”

The KBW analysts only chose banks with healthy dividends, buyback plans (or
expected buyback plans), and no TARP overhang.

The bank stocks include: BancFirst Corporation ( http://quotes.barrons.com/banf
), Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation ( http://quotes.barrons.com/bmtc ), Bank of
Hawaii ( http://quotes.barrons.com/boh ), Cullen/Frost Bankers (
