Brendan,

if you're going to pull out lease/rent expense out of your ROIC nominator,
shouldn't you just pull out the after-tax portion? 

Actually, I'm looking at how to add it back to the nominator. It's already been
pulled out.

Paul

 am I understanding that you are making EVA calculations about a company to
identify 'fair value'? 

I don't know squat about EVA other than what I've portrayed of my knowledge
here - maximize ROIC and minimize cost of that capital.

So for now, I'm just content trying to figure out the mathematical definition,
meaning and utility of ROIC. And I'm only on the first step: how to calculate
it. I haven't even tackled how relevant cost of equity really is, and how
precise we can pretend to make it.

BTW, I could just look it up in a book or even a web site. The problem is, I
don't believe anything unless I understand it inside out. And even once I
understand something, it is not uncommon that I disagree with accepted view
(even if it's a Nobel laureate). So I struggle pretty mightily with my own
perceptions and definitions every once in a while. That's where I am now.

" If the stock is weak but the business isn't, that's a good thing, not a bad
thing."

Agree completely. That is the main tenet of value investing. However, it is
very rarely that simple. It is much more often the case that the business is
weak and the challenge is to determine if the stock has
over discounted that or not -- i,e., where is the bottom in the business, or
does the business have some core value which makes it worth more than the
current price no matter where the bottom is.

Allen, another area which seems to be having its difficulty is 'agricultural
chemicals', specifically fertilizers.

These things are cyclical (very) of course, and I do not know the cycle. But we
are seeing a rebound in basic chemical companies on one end and a sharp rebound
in ag. equipment stocks on another end. So... perhaps fertilizer stocks might
get pushed up too.

Regardless, I've started today a small position in GRO, which is Mississippi
Chemical. Here we have a small fertilizer co., selling at what I believe might
be tangible book value and near its 5 year low, and at a relative low psr. The
dividend is being maintained although the company is not currently profitable.
There's a bit of insider buying now also. Negatives include- not knowing the
extent or severity of the down cycle (and historically it can and has been
severe),lots of competition, only a five year public history on the company,
the unknown effect of its international exposure, and more.

LSCO that supplies to the golf (course) industry. My screen and opinion shows
GRO to be the best buy now. (But, I've been wrong many times -g-)

Also I do not know if it is important to know if these fertilizer plants must
(for economic reasons) be located near the farms they supply. If geographic
location is important, this would tend to limit (perhaps) competition and give
a heavier weighting (imo) to companies that are broadly dispersed.

My intent with GRO, as a value investor, is to buy the smelliest company I can
find (-g---Sorry, I just couldn't resist -g-)- but yet I want it to be a co.
that's got some reasonable chance to survive until the up cycle (assuming there

just the Internet but easily usable CDROMs like Greetings Workshop, which are
hitting the industry with erosion which I would guess swamps any small
traditional positive trend. It is pretty nice to produce a card for zero versus
$4-5. This materially undercuts the purchase by or on behalf of secondary users
like children. I do not like to invest in businesses with a major negative

IMHO, he and his group will be activists in getting the share price moving
upward. If it were to include sale of the company, I would think that Mr.
Lebow's group would encourage that.
This stock is trading lower than it has as far back as my Value Line array goes

"I'm looking for opinions here on how value investors assess retail
chains when so many seem to be destroying economic value."

Mike, porc hasn't given it a lot of study. Maybe he should. But on the face of
it, what he sees with chains, fast food, etc., are real estate empires with one
(low-margin) tenant -- themselves; financial pyramids built on a foundation of
massive, and ever-growing, debt; many awaiting court supervised
"re-organization" come the next recession, and sometines sooner. But, unlike a
straight real estate deal, the tax benefits don't get passed through to the
owners and there are no generous dividends.

EVA is too complicated for porx simple minded brain. Instead, he looks at every
business like a laundromat. Hence, the most important (though, admittedly, not
the only) question to him is how many quarters could he (theoretically) take
out of the machines at the end of the day, and still leave the business
healthy. With chains, he can't find many quarters, so he just moves on. Maybe
they're really there, somewhere in the financial statements, or hidden in
filings with regulatory bodies, etc. But, unlike Graham, if porc has to look
too hard to find the quarters, he figures it's probably because they're not
really there.

Yes, there are always exceptions, like Claire's Stores, but they seem to be few

Wallace, Jeffrey and Bob raise valid points...but I disagree that the greeting

instead of online encyclopedias is simply newspapers. They were expected to
fall by the wayside too with advent of the net...has not happened. I use
http://www.bluemountainarts.com every now and then, but that's been in addition
to buying cards, not instead of. Plus cards are used to write a letter/message
on too...no, the greeting card industry will survive and do OK.

However, that said, the question becomes whether Gibson will make it. They are
clearly a weak competitor to Hallmark & American Greetings. LeBow may have
something up his sleeve re a business combination of some sort, but IMO if you
buy Gibson, it is based on speculation that such a deal will happen, not based
on company fundamentals. Suggest watching it and buy on a significant upside in
volume, again as a speculative move, not a value-based move. My .02, good luck.

I couldn't agree with you more. porx rubric for this is "the 3rd Era of Value
Investing". Anyone who doesn't think "this time is different" has to explain
why productivity is rising, rather than falling (see:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=9460745 ), after 8 years of
an economic expansion, even though low productivity labor is being dragooned
off the welfare roles to take the jobs that illegal immigrants no longer want.

"The general theme here is that when looking at ANY
investment, one must ask: What is the net doing to this
business model?
and, What will the net do to it in 5 years when virtually
everybody with money to spend has access at
bandwidths that will allow far more content-rich
products to be delivered at lower cost than today?"

To the continued wonderment of his colleagues, porx "Model Dow Value Portfolio"
is, for the third year in a row: T, BA, GM, and IBM.

To begin with, porc gets dizzy contemplating all of the quarters this quartet
of modified laundromats generates (see:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=9463099 )

As to how they relate to the Internet:

For starters, the Internet is a network of computers linked (mainly, so far) by
telephone lines. It doesn't take Nostradamus to foresee that T and IBM will
increasingly benefit from the growth of the Internet.

And, BA is also being revolutionized by the 'Net. Besides its stake in the
Ellipsos satellite network, the entire airline industry has been incredibly
rationalized by the 'Net, as well as operations software, that means that every
flight is virtually booked solid, and every passenger pays whatever Mr. Market
charges at the margin. Unfortunately for the airlines, the fact that anyone can
start an airline means that their margins still get squeezed. Nevertheless,
their increased operational efficiency means that they won't all go bankrupt
when the next recession rolls around.

This means that BA has a much more stable customer base, and therefore will be
much less cyclical itself. And, not everyone can build a jumbo jet (they
contain over 4 million parts). As much as China and Japan would like to, they
both have far more economically pressing matters to attend to. This leaves BA
and Airbus to divide up the world. And, BA has a half century of corporate
corpulence to shed. As productivity climbs, so will BA's margins.

But, the most radical change from the 'Net will come to GM. I'm not even
talking about GM's 80% stake in GM Hughes (i.e., DirectTV), which now appears
to be AOL's way around T's way around the Baby Bells.

Henry Ford revolutionized the auto industry through standardization ("You can
have any color Model T you want -- as long as it's black.") However, if you
want to know what GM's business model will look like in 10 or 20 years, look at
DELL's today. That's right. 100's of millions of third world labor market
entrants will be looking to buy their first car. They'll be buying them right
off the 'Net, made-to-order. And, GM will be stamping them out in a few days,
at around 8 or 9 thousand dollars per, with a profit margin of 10% (anyway,
that's the plan). (Not good news for the local auto dealer.)

To top it off, GM is -- yes! -- a stealth online broker. GMAC is already one of
the nation's larger pools of low cost capital. Plans are already underway to
market GMAC mutual funds to the public. (I know, it sounds like the final
stages of Tulipmania). Could e.GM be far behind --???>

while wine consumption is not growing, that premium and near-premium wine

I have meant to look into SVIN more, but still have not had the time. But it
occurs to me possible that they might actually be good businessmen in this
field. If so, like Wal-Mart, they could find good possibilities ahead. The
problem with even public wine companies is that they are so inefficient. Take
Chalone for instance. They bored into a mountain to make their cellars. But the
mountain was volcanic, so hot. So now they air condition their cellar in the
mountain. Go figure. I think I would like a wine company where the people who

Jeffrey: I would say the impact of technology in the future would be anything
but off topic for value investors. One of the major negative impacts on value
investing approaches is the potential of tech changes to make toast out of what
had been robust business models. Now you have to ask if a sell off isn't an
indication that a meteor from cyberspace is about to have deep impact on a
previously stable and isolated business ecosystem. We've recently discussed
book stores, greeting cards and encyclopaedia's, but in fact virtually every
business will be impacted by the net and technological changes.
I think we all have to ask, when analyzing whether a business is an oversold
bargain, just what impact current trends and future twists in technology might
have on the basic earning power of the business.
There will certainly be times that the investment community overestimates the
impact of the net and technology on businesses, but it's important to

I do not like it with NH as acquirer and have sold my NH stock. The Street
obviously disagrees. My simplistic way of looking at it is that at the well
defined lows NH was selling at about 1/2 of CSE. If anything I think NH is
relatively more valuable now. However, it would probably cost at least 2 1/2 NH
for one CSE now. In other words NH would be overpaying.

I also don't much like the market generally and NH has doubled in a very short
period of time.

I can't cry too much over a 70% gain. Merger synergies rarely justify the
acquisition premium [Mark Sirower offers data for this in "The Synergy Trap"
BTW] and I was already concerned about the possibility that the boost in
receivables was responsible for a big chunk of the recent favorable earnings
report. If a company wants to make a big acquisition, it helps to boost the
stock beforehand. Perhaps this might have been additional incentive for
possible earnings manipulation thru aggressive financing.

Still holding NH in all my accounts. I look at these as growth cyclicals, and
in my original analysis of NH found it to be worth over $35/share, Case over
$60. So to me you have a merger of two still-undervalued companies that will be
a stronger competitor, with the added bonus of a consolidating market.
Distribution synergies are expected to be large, in my understanding.

Re: Acquisition premium and "The Synergy Trap" (which I have not seen). I
absolutely agree where you have a couple of large companies where both are
fairly valued, and one goes and offers a premium for the other. Not only have
you created a large financial hurdle to overcome with synergy benefits, but
their might not even be such benefits when all is said and done.

There are some exceptions, however, in my opinion. Acquisitions of any real
business make sense when your stock is vastly overpriced relative to the
target, as with the conglomerates 30 years ago and the Internet stocks today.
AMZN should run not walk to buy Barnes and Noble. Second, there is the concept
of critical mass to be an effective competitor in an industry or get
recognition on Wall Street
(which has implications relative to the cost of capital). Merger of smaller
companies for these kinds of reasons can make sense; but these often are
non-premium or small-premium mergers.

Re: NH and CSE as growth cyclicals.

Mike, I consider these rather like the auto industry. The USA is pretty much a
replacement market.

Furthermore, I find the idea that NH is worth over $35 when it did not reach
that at the recent peak of the business cycle hard to follow. Also, look at
your own figures, if CSE is worth over $60 and NH $35,
then for NH to pay perhaps 3 times its price for CSE (based on current market
pricing), is way overpaying. My fear was and is that NH offers 3 for 1 for CSE,
and NH is soon trading at $15, with worries about overpaying surfacing.

I feared that anyway because of the huge short term advance. Have you forgotten
your post that you would not consider selling any until it got to $18-19 (or
something like that). My long experience is that when it gets to your short
term target ALWAYS sell SOME.

well positioned in emerging markets around the globe. There's the growth.

Case has a big construction component. Now think about distribution. Can we get
more of Case's construction stuff to the same emerging areas in which NH has
already carved out explosive ag potential? Why not?

A lot of times with mergers synergy is just a catch phrase. But I really see it
here. Of course, if you look at these as simple no-growth cyclicals, then there
is very little value in the stock, and you should most definitely run with the
quick near-double. My opinion just differs.

"Synergy Trap" research showed 70% of the time acquisition premium wasn't
recovered. The reasons include managerial hubris and desire to rule larger
domain overuling shareholder interests, the difficulty seeing problems & issues
[Cendant], and difficulty integrating culture and systems. I would agree with
exceptions you noted and add that any merger that fills a critical strategic
gap may indeed yield accretive synergy, provided the acquiror doesn't overpay.
A related issue in competitive multi-bidder acquisitions is the "Winner's
curse" [Richard Thaler wrote of book with that title] the tendency of high
bidders in auction sales to pay an excessive premium.
No excessively long preachy post on overpaying in mergers would be complete
without this Buffett quote:
<<Many managers were apparently over-exposed in impressionable childhood years
to the story in which the imprisoned, handsome prince is released from the
toad's body by a kiss from the beautiful princess. Consequently they are
certain that the managerial kiss will do wonders for the profitability of the
target company. Such optimism is essential. Absent that rosy view, why else
should the shareholders of company A want to own an interest in B at a takeover
cost that is two times the market price they'd pay if they made direct
purchases on their own? In other words investors can always buy toads at the
going price for toads. If investors instead bankroll princesses who wish to pay
double for the right to kiss the toad, those kisses better pack some real
dynamite. We've observed many kisses, but very few miracles. Nevertheless, many
managerial princesses remain serenely confident about the future potency of
their kisses, even after their corporate backyards are knee-deep in
unresponsive toads.>>

Berkshire Sees Drop in Earnings

Filed at 7:57 p.m. EDT

By The Associated Press

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Smaller gains from
investments and lower earnings from insurance
resulted in a 25 percent decline in first quarter
net profit at Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the
holding company of veteran investor Warren
Buffet.

Net earnings in the three months ended March
31 were $541 million, or $356 per class-A
share, compared to $722 million, or $582 per
share, in the same period a year ago.

Much of the decline in net earnings came from
a drop in realized investment gains to $247
million from $470 million. But the company
cautioned in a statement that such gains can
fluctuate significantly without impacting
underlying operations.

This year's first quarter includes the results of
General Re, the largest reinsurer in the United
States and third-largest in the world. Berkshire
acquired General Re, based in Stamford,
Conn., in December.

General Re's first-quarter earnings from
operations, before accounting charges, were
$151 million compared to $250 million. That
decline is due to significant underwriting losses
in both its international property and casualty
business and is life and health business.

The company's largest operation, car insurer
GEICO, broke even from underwriting in
1999's first quarter compared to a pretax profit
of $61 million in the year-ago period, an
anticipated lapse given the last two years' rate
reductions and increases in advertising
expenses.

The earnings were announced after the close of
stock trading Friday. Berkshire's Class A
shares, the highest priced on the New York
Stock Exchange, fell $2,300 to $74,300. The
''Baby Berkshire'' Class B shares, the second
most expensive on the NYSE, were down 50
cents at $2,398 each.

Mike, I do not own it any longer, but am absolutely appalled at the takeover
price of $55 cash for CSE by NH. Fiat must be absolutely stupid:

-Fiat had a $250 million authorization from their own Board to buy more NH
stock when it was $10 (but did not buy a lot), and now think it is better for
NH to buy CSE at more than 3 times the low.

-It would not have been quite so horrible if it were a stock deal as they would
have been paying 3 times CSE low with NH stock at 2 times its low. With cash
the 3 times is cooked in the books forever.

-Cyclical companies should never load up their balance sheets with
debt. Before this deal NH had about $1.6B of equity and $2.7B of debt.
Now it will be $6.7B of debt! How can any analyst make a case for the stock now
with this kind of balance sheet?

Mike, I think we see here one of the pitfalls of a controlling owner.
As I pointed out earlier today, an acquisition for stock would have been less
terrible. However, the big holder's interests would have been diluted
significantly.

To re-emphasize one point, NH at $10 was not good enough for Fiat to quickly
buy up its $250 million authorization last Fall and Winter, for its own
account. However, they have now decided that 3 times the CSE low in cash is now
a good idea for all NH shareholders, including them.

If you take, as I do, last year's lows on both stocks, traded at for a very
long time as the proper value relationship -- roughly 2 to 1, CSE/NH (or the
all time highs which have a similar relationship),
paying 3 to 1 in a $4B deal now in effect pays $1.3B or nearly $9 per
current NH share over fair value. That is not that much below the current
equity of NH!!

Fiat mgmt should have read that study on synergies versus the price paid that
we were recently discussing.

Mike, there is no way that you could view this as a value stock now.
I am just glad that you had the opportunity to get out at a decent price today,
if you have a policy of getting out of stocks when the company nature changes
materially.

Price comparisons are highly dependent on initial time chosen. I used a
charting program to peg AG, CSE, & NH to DE [The big kid on the block] 1 year
ago. At that time, all three were dancing together for 2 or 3 months...as
opposed to a crossover which doesn't usually say much. Fast forward to Friday
and there was again a convergence of CSE, NH, & DE though there had been wide
underpricing of CSE & NH in the interim. AG is still well under the rest...it
hasn't recovered based on that frame.
Looking at book: AG is still selling well below book while Case is being taken
out at nearly twice book. If AG is bid to just book, that's a 50% jump from
here.

There are a lot of companies doing show booths and similar....Might not the Web
also make purchasers of booth exhibits more aware of range of choices and thus

I think you'll find that, if the buyer's shares are selling below its intrinsic
value, as you imply here, that a cash purchase is MUCH more desirable and less
dilutive than a stock deal. This is basic buffet here. (sorry to bring TAHT up
on the value thread!).

Also, I think you'll find that the best way to judge whether this was a good
deal is NOT to look at these stocks from a "technical" view, for example, 3 x
its low, 2 x its low, but rather from a fundamental view. to understand the
dynamics, you have to understand both businesses, the assets being acquired,
what those assets will earn for the acquirer, and the price paid for the
assets.

It doesn't really matter where the deal was done in relation to how "far off
the lows" each stock is. Because one or both of them may have been misappraised
by investors at that time. This is too simplistic an analysis for a merger.

I repegged my chart converge CSE, NH, & AG with Deere 3 months ago. At that
point the lows of all four converge for a period. But the prior 2 years+ then
shows that CSE, NH, & AG were far more highly valued than Deere. I thing the
lows reflected the markets unwillingness to take down a premier name and
nuclear-winter pessimism for the ballance of the group...especially AGCO. By
contrast the year ago period, while off the highs, looked like it represented
an equilibrium period where the group danced together. This is the situation I
feel we're going to return to. Farm prices and world economies will recover and
this will be reflected in the valuations of these companies..our original
thesis on the group.
<<Of course you should also use traditional measures of value like book,
earnings, and sales >> Definitely agree on using traditional value measures,
though averaged figures for earnings should probably be used rather than more
recent shock-induced data, if the thesis of return to normalcy is basis of
strategy. Incidentally, I see the pricing of this takeover as validation of
that return to normalcy hypothesis, though completely agree with your
assessment that NH overpaid.
<<although many would argue that the stock price data reflects that>>
There are times when EMH has it right and times when overreaction, animal

NO! Basic Buffett would be that you do not load up a cyclical company
so that debt equals four times equity. My point about using stock was from that
perspective. We now have a company that might not survive a serious world wide
recession. In my opinion, NH should have offered
2 1/2 shares of stock for 1 and sold CSE that the synergies at that price would
have caused both stocks to rise dramatically. THAT is a Buffett deal that makes
sense for the balance sheet and both companies' shareholders. Had that been
done, CSE might now be the same price and NH several points higher.

What was done was just stupid and reflects the conflict of interest Fiat has
versus NH shareholders in not wanting to give up contol.

This reminds me of a true story. Mutual Benefit Life was a large old line
mutual insurance company of excellent stature. In the 80's they loaded up their
balance sheet with real estate that in the ensuing real estate depression
caused the company to go out of business. In effect they ran their business
ignoring the low probability "tail" of a really adverse environment. Similar
situation here.

As far as stock prices go, your point is well taken. However, these are highly
analyzed institutional stocks. While the absolute values
change with the market prices over time, I really do believe that going outside
historical price relationships is asking for trouble. Note the study that was
referred to on this thread last week that most premiums paid never are
justified by the synergies achieved.

solid balance sheet, etc. It does not change a bit if this happens when NH has
doubled if you pay in stock.

However, if when NH was $9 and CSE $18+, NH offered $55 cash, the analysts
would have fallen all over themselves saying what complete idiots NH was, blah,
blah, blah. It only changes very slightly if this happens when NH and CSE have
risen dramatically (relating to possible future NH equity offerings at better
prices to reduce the debt).

Enough said.

You are asking the wrong person.

On AAPL, there is a difference between $44 and $34 for a value investor.

Furthermore, the BIGGEST investment mistake I have ever made BY FAR
is to buy value in technology instead of the leader. I believe the only
investing strategy in technology that achieves consistently
good results is wait for some decent correction and buy the best.

Too often, technology turnarounds don't turn around or turnaround twice, ending
up where they started. A second tier value technology company is more likely to
end up third tier than first tier.

OT...OT...would someone help me help a friend study for an Econ test...please
answer the following..

20) If the supply of a product decreases and the demand for that product
simultaneously increases, we can conclude that equilibrium;
(a) price must rise, but equilibrium quantity may either rise, fall,
or remain unchanged.
(b) price must rise and equilibrium quantity must fall.
(c) price and equilibrium quantity must both increase.
(d) price and equilibrium quantity must both decline.
(e) quantity must decrease, but equilibrium price may either rise,
fall, or remain unchanged.

21', Given a downsloping demand curve and an upaloping supply curve for a
product, the imposition of an exercise tax on this product will:
(a) increase equilibrium price and quantity.
(b) decrease equilibrium price and quantity.
(c) decrease equilibrium price and increase equilibrium quantity.
(d) increase equilibrium price and decrease equilibrium quantity.
(e) have no impact upon equilibrium price and quantity.

(Advanced analysis) Answer the next question(s) on the basis of the following
information. The demand for commodity X is represented by the equation P = 10
-0.2Q and supply by the equation P 2 + 0.2Q.

22. Refer to the above information. The equilibrium quantity is:
(a) 10.
(b) 20.
(C) 15.
(d) 30.
(e) 45.

2311 The income and substitution effects explain why:
(a) the elasticity of demand can be unity.
product demand curves are downsloping.
(c) product supply curves are upsloping.
(d) equilibrium is always achieved in a competitive market.

48) Which of the following is not correct?

(a) Where marginal product is greater than average product, average product is
rising.

(b) Where total product is at a maximum, average product is also at a maximum.

(c) Where marginal product is zero, total product is at a maximum.

(d) Marginal product becomes negative before average product becomes negative.

49:~ Average fixed cost:

(a) is intersected by marginal cost at its minimum point.

(b) may be found for any output by adding average variable cost and average
total cost.

(c) graphs as a U-shaped curve.

(d) declines so long as output increases.

50) Which of the following is correct?

(a) Average variable cost intersects marginal cost at the latter's
m . inimum point.
(b) Marginal cost intersects average total cost at the latter's
minimum point.

(c) Average fixed cost intersects marginal cost at the latter's minimum point.

(d) Marginal cost intersects average fixed cost at the latter's minimum point.

51) Assume that in the short run a firm which is producing 100 units of

output has average total costs of $200 and average variable costs of

$150. The firm's total fixed costs are:

(a) $5,000.

(b) $500.

(c) $.50.

(d) $50.

52) If the total variable cost of 9 units of output is $90 and the total

variable cost of 10 units of output is $120, then:

(a) the average variable cost of 10 units is $12.

(b) the average variable cost of 9 units is $10.

(c) the marginal cost of the tenth unit is $30.

(d) the firm is operating in the range of diminishing marginal returns.

(e) all of the above are true.54) Economies and diseconomies of scale explain:
the profit-maximizing level of production. why the firm's long-run average
total cost curve is U-shaped. (c) why the firm's short-run marginal cost curve
cuts the short-run average variable cost curve at its minimum*point. (d) the
distinction between fixed and variable costs.

55) Diseconomies of scale arise primarily because:
(a) the short-run average total cost curve rises when marginal
product is increasing.
(b) of the difficulties involved in managing and coordinating a large
business enterprise.
(c) firms must be large both absolutely and relative to the market in
order to employ the most efficient productive techniques
available.
(d) beyond some point marginal product declines as additional units
of a variable resource (labor) are added to a fixed resource
(capital).

56) If a firm increases all of its inputs by 10 percent and its output
increases by 15 percent, we can say that:
(a) it is encountering diseconomies Of scale.
(b) it is encountering economies of scale.
(c) the law of diminishing returns is.taking hold.
(d) the firm's long-run ATC curve will be rising.

57) Which of the following is not a basic characteristic of pure
competition?
(a) considerable nonprice competition
(b) no barriers to the entry or exodus of firms
(c) a standardized or homogeneous product
(d) a large number of buyers and sellers

58) Price is constant or "given" to the individual firm selling in a
purely competitive market because:
(a) the firm's demand curve is downsloping.
(b) of product differentiation reinforced by extensive advertising.
(c) each seller supplies a negligible fraction of total supply.
(d) there are no good substitutes for its product.

60 A competitive firm in the short run can determine the
profit-maximizing (or loss-minimizing) output by equating:
(a) price and average total cost.
(b) price and average fixed cost.
(c) marginal revenue and marginal cost.
(d) price and marginal revenue.

61) In the short run a purely competitive firm which seeks to maximize
profits will produce:
(a) where the demand and the ATC curves intersect.
(b) where total revenue exceeds total cost by the maximum amount.
(c) that output where economic profits are zero.
(d) at any point where the total revenue and total cost curves
intersect.

62) Assume the XYZ Corporation is producing 20 units of output. It is
selling this output in a purely competitive market at $10 per
unit.
its total fixed costs are $100 and its average variable cost is $3
at
20 units of output. On the basis of this information we can say
that
the corporation:
(a) should close down in the short run.
(b) is maximizing its profits.
(c) is realizing a loss of $60.
(d) is realizing an economic profit of $40.

63) A purely competitive firm's short-run supply curve is:
(a) perfectly elastic at the minimum average total cost.
(b) upsloping and equal to the portion of the marginal cost curve
which lies above the average variable cost curve.

The demand curve in a purely competitive industry is while
the demand curve to a single firm in that industry is
,(a) perfectly inelastic, perfectly elastic
(b) downsloping, perfectly elastic
(c) downsloping, perfectly inelastic
(d) perfectly elastic, downsloping

It seems to me that AAPL is incredibly undervalued 

I don't know you at all, and while I agree with the endpoint of your analysis,
I don't agree with the means with which you got there. I like AAPL because it
IMO is now a bona fide value stock on an enterprise value/ratio basis, and is
generating tons of cash. I see loads of opportunity, an extremely strong
balance sheet, and little downside. And I see a huge contrarian play because a
generation of security analysts have been trained to think that whatever is
wrong with this world, AAPL is a part of it.

What the price will do in the next 12 months, I don't know. Whether day traders
will ever mature, I don't know. Whether value will even become more important
over the next year, I don't know. I just see an absolute value in AAPL at
recent prices.

I do feel the greatest margin of safety was back at 34 when no one ever thought
it would move, but that there remains a margin of safety for longer-term
holders.

For other tech value, I'm now a proud shareholder in Oracle at 24 3/8. 30X
earnings, so you gotta understand the business. After consulting with some
techie friends and family and doing some DD, I finally do. It goes in the
long-term hold, Buffett-like stock for me. Pairs to my AAPL and my APCC as
Buffett-like tech stock long-term holds.

OK, Jim, now you can call the end of the bull market. I've gone into tech.

some folks that can be persuaded to go for stylish colorful boxes in place of
greater functionality, software availability, compatibility, and assured
survival of the Wintel standard, but their numbers may be limited. This thing
could still flip and die. That's what the PE is saying.

I tend to doubt you consider most investors that well-read either.
If someone plans to invest in value tech stocks, they had better understand the
dynamics of lock-in and standards. If a guy understands this, as I'm sure you
do, and still chooses to bet against the standard, that's cool. But if a guy
hasn't read Gorilla and doesn't understand the power of standards, he's
definitely buying cows in the moonlight with stuff like AAPL.
This turnaround so far is amazing...maybe Jobs can keep it up, but it looks
like a real longshot.

Depends what the odds are, now, doesn't it? That's what's so elegantly
beautiful about investment analysis. Everybody knows Microsoft is the swiftest
(and everybody may even be right about that) but this is your 4:3 odds horse.
(I might argue a lot of these are 1:2 horses now...even if they win, you
probably still lose money.) What odds is Mike getting on Apple?

I would suggest finding Charlie Munger's comments comparing stock investing to
pari-mutual betting on horses. It got me thinking.

I understand the Gorilla theory, but I think you sell short the installed

sure that my vote hasn't been counted in recent years. Each platform has its
advantages; I own Dell, Compaq and Apple machines. Keep in mind that Apple's
present visible strength increase is in first-time computer purchasers; I
expect there to be some residuals from this.

CSE has a right to expect full value for their shares. ANY seller would agree.
When YOU sell some stock, that's what you want.

It MIGHT have been a good deal for nh to offer stock if its shares were trading
at full value (or above) as well. IF nh wasn't, and all I read around here was
that nh was WAY undervalued, then it would have been value destroying for nh to
issue stock for cse. As it stands, it looks like nh IS selling SOME equity to
finance a part of the deal. That may account for a portion of the drop
yesterday, if it indeed closed down.

stocks with temporarily high roe's do not a buffet stock make. There is
something vexatious about seeing his thinking reduced to this kind of
simplistic comparison. It's just too easy to wave his name around a stock as if
it was the national flag. Well it shouldn't be that easy. aapl, for example, is
about as FAR from Omaha as you can get. We are talking Antartica here. It's a

Twister,

Give me a break. If you really knew what a Buffett-like stock was,
I'd expect to see your real name and a record to prove it. Buffett-like
investing as defined by people like you has been reduced to a set model by
people such as yourself. To me, a lot of the thought and intelligence has been
taken out of it.

I wrote about this on my web site under "Buffett Revisited." To me, his spirit
of investing with intelligence has been lost in a sea of those simply trying to
be pure imitators.

When he bought GEICO, AMEX, the Buffalo News, any number of his investments he
was being as much contrarian as anything. He saw value in a a market dominance
or a brand that others didn't. And the 10-year record of high ROE with earnings
not skipping a beat wasn't necessarily there to prove it when he bought. But
there was nonetheless a margin of safety.

IMO, the biggest impediment to investing in the spirit of Buffett is the idea
that somehow we can be a 100% imitator of him and see the same success. That
anyone could be a perfect imitator of his approach strikes me as ridiculous.
Try compounding the 10% difference between even your best imitator and Buffett
over 30 years.

I don't have it down yet. But in terms of investing in the spirit of Buffett
(rather than in his mirror image), neither does anyone else here that I can
see. I'm young. I'm reading a lot and continuously reviewing and updating my
approach as new revelations occur. Remember I said "Buffett-like stock for me,"
not you. If it was that easy for you to see, I'd be disappointed. I'm certainly
glad I can't find anyone to agree with me on this. If anything, it indicates
I'm headed in the right direction.
