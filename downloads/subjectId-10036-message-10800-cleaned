AMZN is a lousy value play because there is NO shareholder equity. The huge
bond overhead with convertables and losses means current shareholders have less
than $0.05 per share equity. I like cheap stocks like PCOR, SOFN, and EPRE.
These companies have big cash positions and upside potential. They all involve
some risk but all offer substancial reward.

Expected some controversy here. I lost a lot of money shorting Amazon, but that
is sunk now. What is important is what made me cover at 70-80, which of course
was also a mistake in hindsight. But what made me question my assumptions was
the following:

1) They are the best in the world at what they do. I am a delighted customer.
2) What they do is growing like a weed, but others who do what they do are
dying
3) Internet retailing is a lousy business model as long as people are throwing
capital at it, but thats not the case anymore. If anybody is going to emerge as
the Walmart of this business, we know who it is. My plan was to cover Amazon
and short another internet retailer - EToy was the one I had in mind. That
would have been a great trade. Unfortunately I only did half of it.

So now with Amazon down 60%, but with the story better (the plunge last week on
the "news" about the balance sheet was nothing new to anybody who had been
short the stock before. I know the balance sheet has problems and that they are
burning cash.) But...

1) Amazon's pricing is clearly up at least for their core product of books.
2) The fear that they would have to price to the lowest common denominator
turned out not to be true. As a customer, once I wasted 45 minutes trying to
execute an order at Buy.com I stopped going there. I have never once had a
problem with Amazon's website or delivery. They return an e-mail within 24
hours. These guys are very good at what they do.

Now as for valuation, that is tough. I see an exponentially growing retailer
trading for about 5 times this year's sales. Bezos said today he thinks they
will be operating cash flow positive this year. The warehouses have been built,
so cap-ex should fall. And they've got a billion dollars in the bank for a
rainy day. They are not profitable, but they should be. That's lame, I know.
But if they do turn cash flow positive, then make a dime of profit, the stock
will explode.

Bill Miller of Legg Mason Value Trust has not sold a share of his position. In
fact he started buying aggressively again this week. His logic is that this
could be a bankruptcy. There is no margin of safety here. But he thinks in
terms of probabilities. If it is not a bankruptcy, you stand to make a lot of
money. 3x, 5x, 10x, whatever if this is Walmart in 1979. I know three things. I
know Bill Miller is a great value investor who makes his biggest money on ideas
other value investors ridicule. I know that he knows this company's economics
as well as anybody. And I know that he is buying at this price.

I wouldn't make this 10% of my portfolio - there is clearly downside risk. But
it seems appropriate for a small position and see if it germinates.

The language of margin of safety and downside risk and multiples don't apply
here. If you've read Quest for Value, you recognize that Amazon is a "Z". (And
if you haven't read it you should.) And one thing that book convinced me of is
don't short Zs. I wish I had read it earlier.

One last point. When Bill Miller was buying AOL, I had the annual report on my
desk. I was a customer of AOL, and a delighted customer. I was inches from
buying the stock, and knew why, but didn't. I think I was looking for one point
lower, then one more point lower. The signal to me should have been that all of
a sudden the bottleneck cleared and I could log on again on the first try. But
I didn't recognize the signal that was staring me in the face. That would have
been what, a 20 bagger?

Paul,
I am in agreement with you - as a long term investor, no chance I would touch
AMZN - as a trader, absolutely.
I truly question the survivability of AMZN, what with the cash burn rate and
creative financing. The financing is, to me, somewhat reminiscent of another
company which had a lot of things going for it - a company by the name of
Boston Chicken (Market).
I have a friend who lives in Seattle, who lived in Denver in the boom/bust days
of oil. He says what is happening in Seattle right now reminds him a lot of
those days in Denver - large cranes all over the place, doing large amounts of
construction, supporting mostly internet companies. He sees a lot of vacancies
to be filled up in the near future.
I respect his intelligence and acumen tremendously, he scoffs at AMZN.
I wouldn't want to invest in a company which loses, by some accounts, 1 million
bucks a day.

Jim, that takes guts. Not to buy it. To post that you bought it. I won't buy it
at all. I don't see a margin of safety, and I do believe margin of safety
should apply in all cases. But on the other hand, I think we should all
remember AOL when everyone was thinking it was little kiddies internet. Then it
became baby boomer's internet all of a sudden and the stock was off to the
races. When all those people were quitting the service, someone was looking at
how few were quitting relative to how many people should have been quitting.
That someone got rich. Visionaries can get rewarded, and I see your point on
Amazon. But if baseball is a game of inches, then investing is a game of tenths
of percents across the portfolio. And hence it is hard for me to justify buying
a lottery ticket, which is exactly what Bill Miller does from time to time.
Granted, the lottery is somewhat rigged in his favor by his design, but it is
still a lottery ticket.

Good investing,

Speaking of lottery tickets, although the odds seem very favorable to me, what

possibility of being acquired. Has cash too. I have owned SGI before and loaded
up to get the MIPS spin-off last week which allowed me to reduce my cost basis

no weird accounting, respected in the industry. Visited a store - liked what I

On AMZN...I shorted that at $45, I covered June 23. My concern remains the
same. The shorts have generated a tidy profit on information that was already
in the market. AMZN is a dog. The ONLY reason that AMZN commands such a high
market cap is because institutions are still throwing good money after bad. The
shareholders in AMZN have no equity and are subject to heavy dilution IF this
company EVER becomes profitable. Otherwise bankruptcy occurs and the covertable
bond holders get all the stake that is left in the company. This company has an
TON lot of leverage out there for a company with a limited amount of assets. I
am appalled by ANALysts that call AMZN the gorilla in this space because it
simply is not true. This is a highly leveraged enterprise that represents a far
greater risk than almost any other e-tailer. Take ETYS for example, the market
kicked them because of the refinancing deal that they did. The deal at ETYS is
alot better than the deal at AMZN believe it! I have used ETYS and there is no
peer, I am not invested in it though. AMZN will NEVER be able to get financing
again so those bonds are all the money that they will ever see IMO.

I must laugh because PCLN is another short that I may well cover today. They
are similar IMO. They are darlings of fund managers because they are big and
known. PCLN has been given tickets to sell for stock, which long term will not
be profitable...lol!

My other short is a newly opened short of LUV as a hedge on my DAL long.

From:JSwanson

I bought EFII about a week ago at $22.625. Below is the text (minus charts) of
my research before purchasing.

<snip>

Reason for the big drop from the recent 52-week high?
At the time of the company's first quarter earnings announcement, April 12th,
the NASDAQ market decline began to accelerate. This general market sell-off
initiated EFIs drop from its recently posted 52 week high. Roughly two months
later, June 5th, the company warned that second quarter EPS (new guidance $0.38
-$0.42) would not meet analyst estimates ($0.51) and that second half 2000
revenues would fall short of previous company guidance (FY 2000 revenue growth
revised to 10% - 13% down from 20%). The revisions were the result of weaker
demand due to delays in new product introductions. The EPS warning and Revenue
growth revision caused the stock to plummet 31% in one day.

Positives
&#250; Consistent positive cash flow. Over the past five years the company has
generated over $275 million in free cashflow. EFI has generated positive
cashflow since 1991.

&#250; Leading market position. Excluding OEMs, EFI dominates its identifiable
competitors with approximately 50% of the market in the trailing twelve months.
The closest competitor, in terms of revenues, is the Imaging Division of
Imation. However, Imation does not compete head to head in the print server
business and its revenues have been declining over the past three years while
EFIs have been growing.

&#250; Copy and printing industries moving to color and digital. The
advancement of technology is making less expensive to produce documents of all
nature in color and as was with photographs, movies, televisions, computer
monitors, document printing and copying will inevitably move to color. Further,
digital copying is quickly replacing standard methods of copying because of
added versatility and speed and reductions in costs.

&#250; Valuation. Based on a historical relationship to earnings per share and
on a discounted cashflow basis the company looks attractively valued.

Negatives
&#250; Concentrated sale. The bulk of EFIs sales are to copier and printer
OEMs. Canon, Ricoh and Xerox make up roughly 68% of sales. Because the sales
are concentrated in one industry and more so to a few large players in the
industry, the company's EPS have been, and likely will continue to be, highly
erratic due to the decisions of OEMs concerning new product development and
introduction. This has been the driving force in the company's two most recent
selloffs.

&#250; Management Strength. All of the key executive positions within the
company were recently placed in the current position. Guy Gecht, CEO since
01/2000, with company since 10/1995. Fred Rosenzweig, President and COO since
07/199, with company since 05/1993. Joe Cutts, CFO since 04/2000, with company
since 03/1997.Janice Smith, VP Marketing and Human Resources since 05/1998,
with company since 05/1993.

Recommendation
Purchase share at a price in the low $20 range. Maximum purchase price of $25.

Business
Electronic for Imaging ("EFI") develops products designed to make high-quality
color printing in short-run productions easier and more accessible to the
broader market. Its Fiery(R) products incorporate hardware and software
technologies that transform digital copiers and printers from many leading
copier manufacturers into fast, high-quality networked printers. The Company's
Fiery products include stand-alone servers, which are connected to digital
copiers and other peripheral devices, and Fiery controllers, which are embedded
in digital copiers and desktop color laser printers. The Company sells its
products primarily to original equipment manufacturers in North America, Europe
and Japan.

The Company has a model for almost every major digital printing technology
today, including:

&#250; desktop color laser printers,
&#250; high-end desktop ink jet printers,
&#250; wide-format printers,
&#250; mid-range color copiers,
&#250; mid-range digital black and white copiers,
&#250; production color copiers and
&#250; high-speed digital presses.

Customers
EFI has established relationships with leading copier and printer OEMs, in
order to benefit from the OEMs' products, distribution channels and marketing
resources. These OEMs include domestic and international manufacturers,
distributors and sellers of digital copiers (both black-and-white and color),
wide-format printers and desktop color printers. The Company works closely with
the OEMs with the aim of developing solutions that incorporate leading
technology and which are optimally suited to work in conjunction with such
companies' products. OEMs that the Company sold products to in 1999 include,
among others, Canon, ENCAD, Epson, Fuji-Xerox, Hewlett-Packard, Ikon Office
Solutions, Konica, Minolta, Oce, Ricoh, Sharp, Toshiba and Xerox. Together,
sales to Canon, Ricoh and Xerox accounted for approximately 68% of the
Company's 1999 revenue, with sales to each of these customers accounting for
more than 10% of the Company's revenue.

Competitors
The Company competes directly with other independent manufacturers of color
servers, independent manufacturers of embedded solutions, copier manufacturers,
printer manufacturers and others. The Company also faces competition from
copier and printer manufacturers that offer internally developed server
products or that incorporate internally developed embedded solutions or server
features into their copiers and printers, thereby eliminating the need for the
Company's products and limiting future opportunities for the Company. In
addition, the Company faces competition from manufacturers of desktop color
laser printers which do not utilize a controller (relying instead on host based
processing of data) and which offer increasing speed and color capability.

Miscellaneous
Number of Employees: 758 full time employees, 213 in Sales, 91 in Management,
68 in Manufacturing.
Research and Development: Approximately $180 million invested in the past three
years and roughly half of full time employees (386) were involved in R&D.
Manufacturing: EFI utilizes subcontractors to manufacture its products.

Growth Initiatives
Wireless Fiery. Developing mobile Fieries, which are connected to wireless LANs
and are utilized as routers for other wireless devices and printers. Current
EFI technology is able to achieve distances of up to 300 feet.

Reduced Chipsets. In an effort to continue reduce embedded technology price
points, the company is researching and deploying the latest technology in ASIC
design (i.e. system-on-a-chip). Already the number of ASICs per board has been
cut by 25%. This initiative will help the company further penetrate the low-end
laser and ink jet markets.

Professional Services. A Fee for service consulting business that will help
customers understand their printing needs, assess current system needs and
implement new technology platforms.

Core Products. Recent and expected announcements associated with both high-end
black-and-white devices (Danka and Ricoh) and color controllers (Xerox).

Valuation
Based on EPS Growth and historical P/E multiple, EFI looks to be undervalued.
The chart above best-fits the companies estimated EPS to its stock price. Based
on this relationship the stock price should trade in the mid $40 range (note
the chart is still estimating FY2000 EPS of over $2.00. Plugging in the revised
$1.70 roughly equates to $45 per share).

In addition, using the P/E multiple and EPS growth model, an expected value of
$40 per share is calculated based on a P/E range of 10.0x to 30.0x and an EPS
growth rate range of 15% to 25%.

Finally, based on a discounted free cashflow basis, the valuation came in at
roughly $52.50 per share based on operating cashflow growing in a range from 8%
to 30% and capital expenditures growing in a range of 4% to 60%.
Averaging the three above calculations results in an estimated value of $45 per
share.

Applying a 20% discount to account for a relatively young executive team and a
concentrated customer base results in a value of roughly $35 per share.

Re: EFII

Interesting historical chart. What was the reason for the steep drop at the end
of 1997? Did this precipitate the management shake up?

Also, I do not put too much faith in the numbers from Yahoo! Profile but it
lists institutional ownership as something like 124% - is this possible? If not
then do you have a better figure?

I am considering EFII. FWIW I started a tiny technology portfolio that includes
PALM, RIMM and NOK for wireless devices, ISIL and CRUS for device chips, and
CSCO and LU for infrastructure. I managed to start or add to most of these
during the spring retreat so I was still able to satisfy the abused value

In December 1997 EFII announced that 4Q profits would only be about 1/8th of
what was expected. The lower profit was due to the beginning Asian Crisis
(Canon and Ricoh are two out of three customers accounting for over 60% of
EFIIs revenues).

The company is much stronger at this point and has a very solid balance sheet.
The latest 10-Q shows just under $500 million in cash and short-term
investments (before recently announced $100 million share buyback) which
equates to roughly $8.80 a share.

Armin, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions on ALSC.

First, is there an explanation for the significant insider sales for over the

Does their DRAM product compete with Rambus? And, if so, is the drop from the
31 range in anyway associated with Rambus's recent licensing agreements with
Hitachi & Toshiba. And does their flash memory chips compete in the same arena
as Sandisk?

I don't have answers to the technical questions. Insiders own almost 50% of the
company and I imagine they would be selling more shares at 25+ than at 2-6.
Can't tell you why the price has gone down as much as it has- could be a
combination of insider selling being published, a downgrade based on price
(although the target had been raised from 27 to 34) and dram pricing dropping.
I would point out that most of the filings are notices of intent to sell. it
doesnt mean that they have sold now.

Ludwig & Clarke: you guys make me crazy (-g-)

re: SGI: I've traded it unsuccessfully about 3 times since it was discussed
here in '97. My congratulations to you, Ken Ludwig, for staying the distance
through the MIPS divestiture. (I lost patience and lost money.) Your post here
requires more meat, imo. To state that the company has "cutting edge"
technology doesn't translate that the stock is undervalued. To state the any
company has "excellent people" - that's a whole topic in itself vis. a vis.
value stocks. Regarding beat up tech stocks (SGI in particular) where options
may play a role in keeping talent, there will be some disagreement, imo, about
the 'excellence' of the people who remain.
It seems to me, glancing at where you've been on SI, that you are not a value
stock picker per se. (as posters on this thread might define value or as SGI
might be a value stock). Therefore SGI might be the only "value" stock which
you are holding now??? If so, then my opinion is that holding only SGI (even if
it is a value stock) and no other value stocks is an error in portfolio
management.

What spins me about is that it's not about what one doesn't own, it's about
what one does own. So if SGI shoots up to 10, SGI owners are heroes.

My same opinion for Jim Clarke: EFII looks okay for a tech-wreck value stock.
Looks like their Fiery engines that Xerox, Cannon have used will continue to be
a part of both companies' important product lines. And even though EFII has now
missed earnings (and cratered) twice, it "should" bounce back. But again, if in
two years on SI this is the only tech wreck stock somebody's found and bought--
that's an error in portfolio management in my opinion. Forgetting the past with
all the good tech value stock recommendations on this thread that were passed
by, EFII is now no better than any of a number of other tech stocks that have
been mentioned here recently. Imo, focussing on and owning only EFII in the
tech/value category is a mistake.

Although, once again, maybe all it takes is one - EFII - to make a portfolio
bloom. I tell myself and others (-g-) that it's what you ultimately own that
counts, not what you don't own. Except.... sometimes where I/others never
bought QCOM or AOL-- those never-boughts could have made a real difference,
maybe all the difference to a portfolio's growth and performance.

small companies in disasterous situations or with fast growth problems and as a

Bought CAT, CPQ and added to TRN today.

Sold 1/2 of CD.

CAT just seems like too compelling of a value. I might be the only one to see
that their business should grow with a slight recovery in the farming industry
as well as the strong heavy highway business.

CPQ might be a stretch, but they have used 24 1/2-25 as support before, and
quite frankly, as a matter of relativity a much better value than Dell. I'm not
convinced that Dell will surpass CPQ in worldwide sales anytime in the next 5
years.

TRN, many have mentioned before. And I just don't see how they can be valued
like a private construction company (which typically trades at 4-5 times
historical earnings). The most exciting part of TRN's business right now has to
be in the aggregates business, look for good things to come.

<<I might be the only one to see that [CAT's] business should grow with a
slight recovery in the farming industry as well as the strong heavy highway
business.>>

No, there's two of us. Farming isn't the story though it may be a small part of
it. Highway, mining and oil & gas are. These are three businesses which are big
drivers of CAT earnings which are virtually guaranteed to grow from here. But
all anybody focuses on is housing construction, as if that is all CAT does. CAT
makes its big margins on mining equipment and energy related engines. They also
have a rapidly growing engine business related to standby power - the same
thing that is now being hyped in Emerson.

The valuation discounts a recession, I bet if you asked portfolio managers 2/3
would say CAT's earnings are at a peak even though they peaked in 1997 and are
off 40% from there.

The biggest reason to buy CAT now is that third and fourth quarter earnings
should be well above expectations. Simply because CAT took down inventories
significantly in the second half of last year. i.e. underproduced retail
demand. So follow my logic, even if retail demand is down a little bit this
year, holding inventories constant, production will be up a lot. CAT's margins
are based on production levels, not retail demand. And CAT goes up alot when
margins expand. If I want to dream of riches, I ask myself what happens if
retail demand turns up. Then inventories have to increase and production (=
margins) explodes to the upside. CAT's domestic retail sales have been down for
16 straight months. At some point that turns around.

I have a large limit order in on CAT which hasn't hit yet. Hope I'm not being
too greedy on my price that I miss it.

Trinity - there is no reason to buy it except that it trades for half what it
is worth and has a rock solid balance sheet. That's reason enough for me.

I consider OCLR a tech value stock.

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=oclr

Increasing year-over-year revenues, high ROE, ROA, little ltd., low trailing
and expected pe.

They have said backlog is increasing and they are having problems with
"manufacturing constraints"

http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/000420/ca_ocular__1.html

OTOH, several of the posters on Yahoo suggest the current price weakness is due
to a quarterly earnings shortfall to be announced soon.

OCLR had agreed to a buyout offer from Wesley Jensen for about $18 in stock.
But that offer was overturned when Wesley Jensen itself was bought out. (OCLR
just received a 'consolation prize' of $25M before taxes - not factored into
the stock charts above.) If there are other strategic buyers out there, it's
conceivable that OCLR, now @12, could go out at 18 or better. I am hoping this
notion limits the stock's decline.

I follow the group a bit and would not buy in advance of earnings news, no
matter how low the price. That is because I see the downside risk (7-8) versus
upside potential (18-20) over the next year as not particularly favorable.
Whenever that happens and I know a so-so quarter is ahead I always wait.

Dag nabbit. I missed LANC by a few seconds. Nuts.
Earlier I added to Whirlpool (WHR) as it crashed. I sold some OCAS (Ohio
Casualty) at a loss (aside: They cut their dividend last month. What a shame.
My notes say they had paid HIGHER dividends for 49 years --until now.) I added
to REY (Reynolds and Reynolds) as it dropped. I sold a little IDTC (to buy
LANC.. grrrrr.). I sold off a tad of Abbott (ABT) and bought more Speedway
Motor Sports (TRK). I added a mite to Carnival Corp (CCL). Also to Trinity
(TRN).

I started a small position in Chattam (CHTT) near the day's lows. A marketer
and manufacturer of "branded consumer products". My limited experience with
this business (Block Drug, which I've mentioned here several times) suggests
this is a viable business that works if it's managed correctly and has the
right creative marketing. Which CHTT may have. There's some insider buying- I
can get stock at same or lower price. There's not much backing this stock in
the financials (imo)-- negative tangible book value and d/e on stated bv is 7.1
(per Yahoo). Price/sales looks pretty good to me although sales are down about
3% in the current 6 month period. The stock is down from much higher levels,
the company is buying back stock they say, and they are introducing new
consumer products. Imo, this stock is suitable only for someone who will make a
small speculative buy in an otherwise well diversified portfolio.

jmo, I've been wrong many, many times,

I am surprised you can follow so many stocks. I am already getting confused and

profits in CRGN and sold my PAP to buy ORCT. Not happy with the decline in
value of ALSC but its once again very close to the value of its portfolio net
of taxes, so I would hope downside is much more limited thatn the upside. Of
course I thought this way at 27 when I added more shares. UTSI has rebounded
nicely but I expect more. It was above 40 when some nasty news was released
about the CHinese govt suspending new roll outs of their main product. the
stock opened at 27, dropped all the way down to 18 and closed around 20. Now
the CHinese have completed there review and everything is fine but the stock
price which has only gone up to 31 or so. I am hopeful that there is at least

I looked at my watchlist today at 3:45 (June 30th, last 20 minutes is probably
the most inefficent market of the year due to Russell index shifts, so it
behooves you to be awake and alert at that time). I knew I hit my first LANC
trade at 19 1/16, but when I realized that one hit I threw in a couple other
limit orders on the chance they might hit. Strange things were going on with
SNH trading and it was showing 7 15/16, so I threw in a "what the hell" limit
order at 7 3/8 - a crazy price, which I didn't expect to hit. Then I threw in
another LANC order. When the market closed I checked the orders and they showed
up as pending cancelled, and then didn't check again. Figured alright, I got
one. SNH was such a ridiculous bid (10% below the market quote) that I didn't
expect it to hit.

Now I'm looking at my account again and I notice that the orders both hit well
after the market closed. I added significantly to my already large position in
SNH at 7 5/16 - so much for a limit order at 3/8 - that shows how crazy the
market is at this specific time. And my second LANC order hit as well. Thank
you Russell index. After watching what happened last year at this time, I would
expect that LANC opens at 22 or so and SNH at its usual 8 and change on Monday
morning. And if they don't, fine - I know what I own and am delighted at the
prices I got. That may have been the most profitable 15 minutes of my life -
unfortunately for me, time was so of the essence that I only traded one account
and that was my mother's, where there was a pile of cash until about 4:15
today. So actually it might have been the most profitable 15 minutes of her
life. Not counting chickens before they're hatched, but watch these two stocks
Monday with these prices in mind.

And mark your calendar for June 30th next year and have some cash on hand -
this makes the January effect look like nothing if you know what you're looking
for and have done your homework so you are prepared to pull the trigger
instantly.

I'll post my outrage just as I did last year. It makes a joke of value managers
of concentrated funds trying to make a representative showing at mid-year. Last
year it spiked my returns irrationally, dooming the third quarter. This year it
decimates the returns irrationally. I'm sure it will come out in the wash, but
it doesn't help for marketing. I congratulate you, Jim, on being awake and
tuned in when it happened. I signed in right on the market close (I guess I had
thought with Thursday's strong showing I had little to worry about - if
anything, the spike would be up) and couldn't believe my eyes. And why it would
deteriorate so much further AFTER the market close is beyond me. Actually, I
can understand the mechanism, but I don't understand why someone hasn't fixed
the mechanism so this doesn't happen. All I can say is that as I begin my
professional money management life, it would sure help if now these stocks
would stay this low for the next month or so. Let's see if this predicts a good
showing for tech stocks in the third quarter, just as last year's mid year
close predicted a tech slump in the third quarter.

Looks about right, I can see 90K and 50K trades after market on SNH. I was
concerned that there was some bad news lurking out there which might have
leaked causing a drop, so did not step in and add to my position but may be I
should have. Looks like 350K more shares traded than avg volume on SNH,
assuming all ths extra volume is from instituitions which hold about 1.8M
shares, this resulted in churning of 17% of insitutional holding wich seems
rather significant...hopefully not much of the 50% insider holding got sold.

I would like to bring IDTC to your attn. as the company is debt free, has 200M
in the bank, and is about to take in a Billion 117M from ATT by selling them a
stake in NTOP (Net2phone). IDTC has 37M outstanding shares and trades at only
$34

July 6th. is a higely important date for NTOP and IDTC. On that date at 9AM the
shareholders of NTOP will vote to approve the issuance of 4M new shares to be
sold to ATT for $300M and to approve the purchase of 14.9M shares of NTOP for
$75 per share from IDTC to ATT. The approval at this meeting removes the last
possible obstacle to the ATT deal closing on August 1. Note, the boards and
shareholders of IDTC and ATT have already approved this and last week the SEC
granted their approval. ATT will at that time pay 1 Billion 117M to IDTC or
about $30 per share and as I said, 300M to NTOP. At the close of the ATT deal,
IDTC will still own 10M shares of NTOP and 5M shares of TRRA. The company is
debt free and has 200M in the bank.

Here is my worst and best case analysis:

I believe the core business is worth maybe $18 right now. If they go ahead and
do the deals we expect with ATT as outlined in the MOU on freedgar, income
could actually increase by about 1 Billion per annum and it could actually be
profitable. That could then make the core worth $40.

The expected increase in business from ATT is outlined in this post.

http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=13402217

In addition to the core, IDTC is debt free and has about 200M in the bank.

August 1 they will complete their deal with ATT and sell them 14.9M shares of
NTOP for $75 per share or 1 Billion 117.5M dollars.

That will leave them with 10M shares of NTOP values today at 350M and 5M shares
of TRRA valued today at 182.5M

So, a conservative valuation would be

$18 for the core business
$ 5.40 for cash in the bank
$19.63 cash from ATT minus 35% taxes

Total $43.03

Add to that

$9.45 for NTOP
$4.93 for TRRA

Total equals $14.38 plus $43.03 equals $57.41

That is the minimum I expect IDTC to be valued at after August 1, 2000 based
strictly on value.

If IDTC simply invests their money at 5% earnings will increase by 30 cents per
quarter.

If they invest in Fiber say a billion in Fiber, the company will receive a
valuation of 3 times that asset if its a good one.

Assuming they roll out coverage with major houses etc. and do the ATT deal for
new business, this could be a $200 stock easy IF management doesn't screw it
up.

who want an entry point into a Buffett/Munger stock (assuming WSC stays down

what I can dig up on WSC.

I've never owned it. Always seemed too expensive. I notice you sold WSC to pick
up BRK which was then right at its lows. And now you're back into WSC as its
dropped to its lows. Several nice moves there on your part. (So far anyway -

But I own some Freddie in my IRA that I might swap for wsc if the price stays

Also starting to buy Regal Beloit (RBC). A typical, small-cap, heartland
industrial 'old economy' company which garners little interest in the market
(trading near its lows). Sales and bv have doubled since '94, but ROE, ROA have
come down in spite of increased debt levels. (Debt increased since '94, but has
been dropping in past couple of years.) I have that it's trading 7x Fcf/sh. IF
they can get profit margins back up to previous years' levels or IF pe reverts

$1776/acre. They've got 415M sh. outstanding per Yahoo (not updated for for

Flipped half of my new double position in LANC today at 22 1/4. I was tempted
to hold the whole thing for a monster gain, but I had bought too much to
stomach the risk if something went wrong. So now I still own a full position at
what I might argue is an average cost of 16 1/4 due to this "day trade", and
I'll hold onto that for a while. LANC at 19 1/4 Friday at the close was the
clearest example of short-term market inefficiency I have ever seen. I'm just
glad I wasn't sitting in a meeting or something so I could take advantage of
it. With 20/20 hindsight, buying a double position was too timid. But that was
a decision I had to make in ten minutes, while very concerned that Fidelity's
website was going to crash like it does half the time when I try to make a
trade.

I'll throw two more ideas on the table. Boring, but pretty good companies

OT. CA: 29 11/16 down 21 7/16. I would just like to be an observer today at the
meetings at Capital Research and Management, Mass. Financial Services, or
mutual fund MFS Emerging Growth. According to Yahoo, they own CA in the amounts
of 28.5M sh., 25.4M sh, and 11.9M sh. respectively. For Capital Research,
that's a $600 million dollar loss today. What would be these investors'
strategy and tactics now? Sell? Can't dump the stock. Slowly reduce position?
Hold - the stock might come back. Buy more - it was good enough at 50 to have
millions of shares of it. Would they buy more? With Capital Research, they
already have 5% of the outstanding shares. Would it be a Buffett thing for
these guys--- be willing to up the ownership from 5 to 10% or more--makes
little difference since if the company is undervalued, as an owner be willing
to buy the whole company? Or maybe these institutions or funds don't really
lose so much because they anticipated the decline and have hedged with options?

If it were me, and I had 5% of the company, I'd hold. But if I were a mutual
fund that had a large position in CA relative to other stocks in my portfolio
(large until today that is -g-), I don't know what I'd do. Probably try to
listen to the guys who advised me to get in or stay in the danged thing when it
was up. If they say it's now a mistake or too risky, I'd want to sell.

SNPS - Synopsis

Paul I believe you said you initiated a position in SNPS a little while ago?

I'd like to throw SNPS into this thread. I believe today's drop was in sympathy
to the software industry bloodbath. It's my understanding that revenues and
income are going to struggle just a hair this year, but they should remain
profitable. I also believe most of the negative news has been built into the
price. In any case a line by line comparison with CDN (I believe to be their
main competitor) leads me to believe SNPS to be undervalued.

CCL: I'm planning on adding to CCL if/when it drops. I'll just guess that it'll

for a long time imo, (but of course I don't really know), because there will be
the strong negatives of fuel costs plus there are just too, too many new cruise
ships coming on line. It's therefore obvious or conventional wisdom that
business will either be less profitable than in the past or more difficult or
conducted differently. My bet is that demographics still favor an increasing
demand, that if Las Vegas can build and find ways to absorb its hotel space,
there's got to be a way for CCL. Three years from now, there's going to be a

in. It could easily jump 7 points a day after it falls 6 the prior day. This is
one that I could end up crucifying myself on, because I think I know something
about the company that others generally don't. Gives me a sense of bravado in

Jeffrey Bash. re: CA and pe. Forward pe may be about 10 after today's price
decimation. But even so, I agree with your question "what's to like ... for a
value investor?". Not much. I would like to give these institutions credit for
purchasing CA at much lower prices when it was or could be considered a value
stock and so, even with today's drop, they would have done great with this
stock. But I can't give these guys any credit because I'm guessing they didn't
buy when it was way cheap. Maybe it's never been a value stock. I don't know
when Capital Research got its 28M shares, but if they bought any time after Jan
1996, they would seem (from my Yahoo chart) to AT BEST be at breakeven now.
That's not so hot for tieing up close to $800+M for 4 years during a great bull
market.

If I put on my value hat, it's very hard for me to see how these guys could get
themselves into such a lousy situation. How they could buy and have bought 28M
shares of CA. (Happens all the time though, e.g. Janus buying tons of HLTH at
61, now 14+.) I just wonder what they might be considering to extricate
themselves, if anything.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ca&d=5y

OTOH, the last time CA crashed, it got to this (29) level and recovered fairly
quickly. Maybe it will do the same again.

Unless someone offers a compelling reason why this might happen or a good value
analysis of the stock, I say CA's an avoid. That's imo; I defer to anyone who
has any knowledge of the situation.

Yes, cpabobp, I did buy a very small amount of SNPS. I'm not sure that it's a
value stock. Actually as I consider CA, SNPS looks like it's just too similar
to CA. (Totally different businesses though of course) Similar chart pattern.
Difficult to determine value base for either. Even MFS Emerging Growth is in it
big like Yahoo says they are in CA. That's all scary.

I bought because I consider SNPS a play on the continued development of
semiconductors. A stock at a reasonable pe compared to the semi industry which
it supports. SNPS, until now, has had very good year-over-year revenue gains.
ROE and EPS were looking good recently. A brokerage firm has said they may
change the way they account for licensing charges(revenue)and if so, the change
will hurt reported earnings. Which may have been part of the reason for the
downward move in the stock recently. The company has no long term debt, and
plenty of cash/sh. Still, the stock could easily pull a CA and drop another 50%
imo.

Paradoxically and inexplicably perhaps, I am willing to add to my very small
position in SNPS here as it approaches 5 year lows and yet I'm unwilling to do
the same (start a position) for CA.

re: CA

This company generates enormous free cash flow with very little capital
investment. They've done it for a very long time. I kind of know this company -
in that I know people who know it, but not enough to invest without further
research. What I do know is that I would not have bought it at 50 and would not
be selling it now. I think the value is somewhere in between - but probably
closer to the 50 than the 29.

Actually the tech I have my eye on is EFII, though I still haven't bought it. I
just need to find some time to read the financials. I was happy to see the tech
downdraft take this one down some today.

I'm still not in tech, though I'm close to buying a couple. I've been buying

Regarding CCL and capacity....I am a frequent cruiser, so I'm bringing that
perspective to this issue....I'll leave the public statements on valuation
analysis to those who have demonstrated more proficiency at it than I have.

Paul, most new ships that CCL brings on line do not end up in a net increase in
ships for the line....they sell the older ones. Yes, it might be argued that
even though CCL doesn't own the ships, they are still afloat and still booking
passengers, but that issue is one of which market is being served by those
older ships and do they have a negative impact on the current flow of bookings
for CCL....I don't think it hurts them, but the reasoning is a bit lengthier
than I want to get into at this post.

When looking at CCL's percentage of capacity booked, you will note that they
are still over 100% and increasing, so I don't think the capacity issue is
germaine just yet.

People who cruise the first time and like it, cruise a LOT....most ships that I
have been on lately we're talking in excess of 70% of the passengers are repeat
passengers and I would guess that over half of those are on their 5th cruise or
higher.

The fleet that has the newest ships will draw more first time passengers and
therefore will get the higher residual repeat passengers. The newer ships have
internet capability that will be even more of a draw and they are developing
other value-added services as profit centers in an effort to maximize the
profitability of each cruiser.

The sector has been out of favor since oil prices started to rise.

I think oil prices have peaked and you may be right about CCL going to 16, I
don't know, but with a P/B of 2.0 and Operating Margins of 26%, I don't think
it is a bad price to buy the leader in this industry.

You know you bought a stock right when it goes up 23% in one day on what looks

4% today and the stock jumped 2 3/4 to 14 3/8. I bought a good deal of stock at
11 a month or so ago on the way down. Actually bought a few more shares today
at 13 1/2 - I rarely average up, but this one is special. I think you're
looking at a $35 stock trading at 14. This company's financials are just
incredible. Very favorable cash flow dynamics. You don't find too many
companies with a 20%+ growth rate that throw off free cash flow. And 99.9% of
those trade at above 10x earnings. I don't think there is a single analyst with
a buy on the stock - they've got to be sweating today - and it is still trading
below 10x earnings, even after a 75% move off the bottom in the last couple
weeks. The stock is still a screaming buy in my book, though not without some
risk. I'm kicking myself for not adding at 8-9, though looking at the chart

And I admire your courage to buy and to have held a large position in it. (I

I believe I'm better able to talk about SEMI from an intuitive/paradoxical
standpoint rather than from a rational one. I have upped the number of shares I
have just a little more today. For no good reason. SEMI just looked like it
should have been trading higher than the price I saw it at this am., given
their good news announcement. So I bought a little more. I intend to try to
hold all shares. At least until next quarter's earnings

I defer to your judgment and analytical skills regarding the possible earnings
gains SEMI could sustain. To me, SEMI's basically a distributor - although a
distributor of parts that people believe may be in short supply. I do not know
what sustainable earnings might be, but the business clearly has improved and
this is reflected in its increased value (the increasing stock price). I do not
like stepping up to pay more for the stock (but I did nonetheless) when I could
have paid less any week in the last 12 months. I can't now offer up SEMI as a
potential value stock for review, nor would I recommend it for anyone on this
thread who's already passed on the stock for reasons of their own (too small a
company, unattractive business, etc.) OTOH, some people here who are quick,
flexible in their opinions and able to take advantage of changing situations,
might see what you see -- "$25-30 on the stock" - and such people might very
well see SEMI as an attractive risk/reward bet now (@20).

many average investors to understand the complexities of the science involved.
Although Cell Genesys currently has one of the largest patent portfolios in the
gene therapy field including more than 230 issued or granted patents and over
320 pending patent applications, Briefing.com continues to like CEGE less for
its patent portfolio, but more for its cash position. Briefing.com highlighted
this company a month ago in a stock brief. Although the stock is up 27% since
then, CEGE continues to offer an inexpensive way to buy Abgenix (ABGX 137 11/16
+7 5/16) which has been a biotech darling. CEGE holds about a 12% stake in
Abgenix, which is valued at $665 million, or about $19.71 per CEGE share. Add
in CEGE's cash position of approximately $250 million, which when divided by
33.7 mln shares outstanding comes to roughly $7.40 per share in cash. Add the
two together and you get $27.11 in cash and l/t marketable securities. In other
words, you can buy CEGE's patent portfolio and ongoing operations for just over
$4 per share. -- Robert J. Reid, Briefing.com

think to myself that if I have had success on the longside why should I try
something new which may tie up funds and be less successful.
Personally I think it is very dangerous to short something that is going
straight up. Many of us felt that NTOP was very overpriced and it went up to 90
or so before falling back to reality. I would appreciate any strategic input
you have to offer on this topic. In retrospect I think there are solid

I was mostly a long player until late last year when I saw ADSP go through the
roof the day after Thanksgiving. I decided to short it at 37 15 minutes before
the market closed. The next day it opened at 15, I covered a few days later at
12ish. After that I became very interested in shorting. I don't know if many of
you follow Anthony Elgindy or not, www.anthonypacific.com, but I have learned
an amazing amount about shorting in the past 6-7 months on his site, and the
rewards have been phenomenal. I know he is very contraversial, but after
following his trades and meeting him in person, I realized he has abilities in
shorting securities that I have yet to see reproduced.

Getting off topic...I agree that shorting is much more risky, but the rewards
far outweigh the risks, if you play shorts properly. Allocation is the key to
shorting, I have seen many people not properly allocated in a position get
destroyed when a short doubles or triples in price, basically they just got
greedy. Properly allocated means allocated right so that if the stock doubles
or triples in price temporarily, you will still be able to pull through and
make a profit. Example: if you have 50k for a short position, you may take 10%
of that to start a position at, say 55. If it hits 75, take another 10%, or
whatever you feel confortable, until you are fully allocated as it rises. If it
never rises above your initial 10% position, then you make a small profit, but
high percentage return. If you feel strongly enough and have researched the
stock properly, I would average up, starting with a small position, and
averaging up from there. Stop losses have to be followed though as well. It's a
fine line between knowing when to average up and when to stop out..

SCON, started shorting it at 24, was fully allocated when it hit 40, covered at
44 for a pretty hefty loss, watched it hit 105, and then shorted it all the way
down to the 50's and covered for pretty good profits.

Bad short currently in, KREM. I started a position at 37, it's at approx 80. It
has a P/E of over 100, pathetically overpriced. I am properly allocated and can
ride it out. Of course, I should have placed stop losses, but am still
learning...., but not over allocated, and will not loose my shirt.

Another reason for shorting, it to protect oneself against market downturns.
During those few weeks when the market tanked from 4,000 to 3,000 on NAS, was
my best weeks in profits ever. All the high priced stocks eventually come back
where they belong. Just make sure you don't pick an ebay or yahoo:). SONS,
ELSI, ECNC, COII, ZERO, STMP, GSTRF, ENBC, SINA, KEI, the list goes on and on..

Re: "I agree that shorting is much more risky, but the rewards far outweigh the
risks, if you play shorts properly."

Ridiculous.

This is what happens when you combine someone who doesn't have much investment
experience with a technique (shorting) where you can read tons of articles on
how to do it and also get psychological support with the observation that there
are plenty of people out there who short every day. Shorting - a very logical
technique to employ, plus the benefits are rather quickly seen when it works.
(Stocks go down a heck of a lot faster than they go up, usually)

The question not much asked though is: SHOULD this technique be used and by
whom?
Here on the value thread, I've argued that I do not see where value investing
gurus have written that they have employed short selling either as a technique
to hedge a downturn or as an opportunistic way to make profits. I recall only
one article from a value fund manager who admitted to it. I've pulled down now
the books of Graham, Klarman, Dreman, Train and Tanous ("Investment Gurus").
There're only a couple of paragraphs about "shorting" and "hedge funds" in
Train's "The Craft of Investing". Not much, if anything, in the other books.

Now none of this may mean anything to you. But it means something to me and it
might to value investors here also. I'm one who tries to do what works. What
works for the majority of people, into which category I likely fit. That's to
whom these authors address themselves. I don't doubt that there are especially
flexible, brilliant, astute, steel-nerved, well-capitalized people who are
tremendous short-sellers. Or just forgetting the adjectives, there ARE
successful short sellers. Maybe you are one. (Although, with one year's
experience and early success, you remind me of the first time craps player who
wins $30K and says, 'Wow. Where have I been all my life. This is great.' And
promptly becomes addicted).

Most people should try, imo, to follow what successful people who have gone
before them have done and said--- leave short-selling to the professionals.

Funny how this is. One would initially suspect that value investors- presumably
astute enough to find bargains- ought to be among the best sources for
employing short-selling since they ought to be able to tell when something is
grossly overvalued. But, as I say, walking backwards is not the same as walking
forwards. And short-selling, although obvious, is not so easy a technique to be
used successfully. But it's insidious in that NOBODY believes that or listens
to the experts. It has to be experienced. As I've often said, I encourage
people who are just starting to invest to try everything - don't miss
short-selling! Because the earlier and quicker they try it-- and lose money,
the easier and quicker they can recover. Then they can discern those techniques
that make them money and don't tear at their guts while doing it. For the vast
majority of people who will become millionaire stock investors - that means
buying and holding common stocks. And not using short-selling as a tool to
allegedly augment their progress.

Paul, the only reason shorting was brought up was someone mentioned shorting a
stock, I forget even what it was now, and then the dialog continued from there.
I am not arguing that shorting is not part of the "value" strategy, I have
indeed read Graham and Train's books.

I agree that short selling is not for most people, it takes balls of steel
sometimes. And maybe I have been lucky, but I doubt that is the case. I didn't
succeed in long investments over the past 7 years because of luck. It was hard
work and DD. I don't spend several hours after work each night investigating
Short Sell candidates for fun. It's paid off for me in the past year more so
then my long positions. If it continues to pay off, I will continue to use the
technique. I won't mention % returns, but longs have done nicely, shorts are
even better. When and if it doesn't continue to pay off, then I will stop
shorting.

I agree, I would never, ever even attempt short selling if I had just started
investing, that would be insane. Most people can't make money in the market
going long, let alone going short.

I am a polite guy, so I won't comment on your statement about investment
experience, except to say that I believe that you do not have enough experience
unless you have lost virtually all your money at some point. However, it sure
sounds like you are playing with fire on shorts. As I have posted before, you
short bad companies in bad industries with bad charts. THAT is how you control
your risk. Shorting overpriced stocks is a fool's game as I think some of our
posters could tell you with respect to AMZN. Who is to say that a ridiculously
overpriced stock won't get twice as overpriced?

There is another better reason for not shorting. The very most you can make is
100% if you hold for a long time and the company goes broke. Conceptually it
takes just as much homework to understand that a company is a good short as it
does that it is a good long. With the long you can make 100's of percent for
the same amount of effort. For example, I recommended SEMI on this thread more
than once in 1999 as a traditional value play at $3. It is now $22. Why should
I bother to try to find some company that may go from $22 to 3.

As far as anthony@pacific goes one of the reasons I did not buy NTOP at $20 or
so was that he was trashing it so hard that he evidently got thrown off SI. It
subsequently went to $90, before settling back to a price well above $20.

I know this is getting way off topic.

I would rather learn from other peoples mistakes, then make the same ones. So
no, I don't believe you need to have lost all your money to have experience. I
might as well go make sure I "loose" all my money so I can have that
experience, sure.

I've seen many overpriced stocks go 2x from where I started a short, even 3x,
allocate properly, average up from there. If you are not prepared for a stock
to 2x or 3x on you when you are shorting, you are over-allocated in the short.
When I short I am always prepared that this could potentially 2x or 3x, and
start my position based on that.

I'm not saying I only short, I would say I am 75% long, 25% short, just
depends.

I agree that shorting isn't part of a value investing strategy, so this is
completely off topic. But done right, money can be made shorting, even "non
professionals".
