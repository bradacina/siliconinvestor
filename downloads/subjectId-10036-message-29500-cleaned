I don't understand how people can put up performance percentages for '07 so
quickly. Are these pretax numbers?

Am I the only person around here who's likely going to pay the USA Fed. AMT tax
because of making outsize sales and incurring large net long-term capital
gains? A tax which is near impossible to prefigure just using IRS forms and/or
not knowing what the new - presumably reduced - AMT rules will be?

I'm outlooking that my taxable portfolios total value will drop maybe 8-9% or
more just having to come up with cash to pay this tax. I've already moved that
money out of stocks and into a bank to pay estimated taxes due Jan 15.

Hmm. I guess put that way though, 8-9% is not such a bad drop. Having to pay
Uncle Sam 25-30% of the net gains incurred seems the much more painful way to
look at it. And looking at the total chunk of money actually disappearing, is
the most painful.

I can't match your performance this year. I don't know about year 2002 being
especially difficult. 2002 doesn't seem that bad to me in retrospect. I don't
know what I should've learned from the market from that time. Perhaps for you,
it's to now "hunker in the bunker", which seems to me about what you say you
are doing.
For me, I see tons of great buying opportunities, more so than usual, and I
have open orders all over the place. Assisting me is that I'm not so much
worried about 2008 as a down year and I don't have clients I have to report to.

"Cramer ran a hedge fund, which has to be audited and send out statements to
clients at least once a year, any one of which could disprove an exaggerated
claim."

I've been mulling this and have decided I need to see what all is included and
excluded in an audited statement and in "%gains" before I change my opinion.
I've never seen a hedge fund statement. If the auditor attests to the
financials - the balance sheet, cash flow statement, the p&l, that is one
thing.
If the auditor also attests to the verbiage - e.g. "we were up 125% this year",
that is a second thing.

In theory, it's possible to take the balance sheet bottom line from one year's
statement and compare it to the previous year's, and calculate percentage
change. But that could be much different from the verbiage of stated gains. For
example if the fund uses an October year-end date on the balance sheet, but
reports performance % gains on a calendar year. Or maybe uses the calendar year
for balance sheet but inception date for the performance year-over-year figures
that management speaks of. Maybe they switch between 'em depending which shows
the better gains. Or if, with people coming into the fund at various times of
the year, and maybe also being allowed to exit at various times, the percentage
gain is a composite -- calculated by management, not audited -- of the
gains/loss % of all participants for the calendar year. And maybe they use the
median percent vs. the mean percent -- whatever is more favorable to
management.
Anyway, I need to know a lot more before I come to believe performance figures
as reported.

---------

This somehow reminds me of funds that are able to state, "if you invested
$10,000 with us in 1980 at fund inception, you would have $xx,xxx now, a
compounded gain of over yy%. Once, just once, I would like to see the fund
managers state exactly how many people bought the fund in 1980 and are still
around now for the yy% gain.

Bought New York Times around $18 (now $17). You get a 5% dividend (supported
weakly by a forward PE of 15) while you wait with infinite patience for the
controlling owners to express economic rationality with asset sales. Stock is
trading at a 10 year low (not surprising for a newspaper stock). The case for
the company selling below break-up value is put forth:
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119300645463466373.html

Bought Brinker International around $20.50. Currently, the forward PE is under
10. The stock is selling near a 5 year low, yet over that period share count
has been brought in 29%. This $900m buyback has mostly been funded with
long-term debt which has increased $600m over the period to $953m. I figure
2003 EV was about $3.3B versus $3.0B now. Operating income looks to be weak for
FY ending 6/2008 which is concerning. I’m betting the company’s earnings
capacity is substantially higher than it was in 2003 as revenues in 2003 were
$3.1B versus $3.8B forecasted for FY 6/2008.

Bought Pool Corp @ $24 (currently $20). The company is the leading distributor
of swimming pool supplies. The stock is at a 4 year low with a forward PE of
12. Share count has been bought down 10% over that period. Assuming there is no
long term damage to the industry from global warming and water issues, it seems
like a good bet to me.

Bought FTD, the leading florist, at $13… having sold it last year at $18.
Forward PE is about 10… this was an LBO so there is risk from the debt.

Bought United Natural at $27 (currently $31). This is the leading distributor
of natural foods (with large market share). Natural foods has demonstrated
long-term growth trends as an industry. UNFI has doubled revenue and income
over the last five years and I think it’s organic growth (about 15% per year).
The runrate PE is around 20 which I think fair for its growth and my perception
that they are maintaining a disproportionate share of the growing natural foods
market.

Bought Masco @ $23 (now $22). This is near a five year low for the stock price,
yet shares outstanding have been reduced 26% over that period with long-term
debt flattish. The dividend yield is over 4% and the forward PE is about 12.
This company has some real names in cabinetry (Kraftmaid, Merillat and Mills
Pride), plumbing (Delta, Hans Grohe and Peerless), and paints (Behr).

Bought AIG at $61 (now $58). Current valuation is 1.4 P/B and a forward PE of
about 10. I take a leap of faith in their accounting and that book value won’t
be impaired materially by the sub-prime writedowns.

Bought Costplus @ $3 in November and subsequently sold at $5.67 in December… an
87% rise on no news. There has been a breathtaking deterioration in operating
income in recent years, but at $3 the company price to sales is under .07. It’s
in the mid 4’s now.

Bought Asta Funding @ $34 (now $27). The company buys/sells/manages
non-performing consumer debt. Over the last four years revenue and earnings
have grown annually in the 40+% range. Total Assets unfortunately have been
growing at 50+%. With a forward PE under 10… I’m in for a ride.

Bought Bed Bath & Beyond around $29. This is a 5 year low. Over that period the
company has reduced share count 10%. It has no long-term debt. Forward PE is
around 12. Return on assets is around 15%.

Bought American Eagle Outfitters (again) at $23 … now $20.50. Return on assets
is a blistering 24%. Forward PE is around 10. The company has no long-term debt
and some excess cash.

Bought Sealy at $11.50. I think this was an LBO. It has no equity and
significant debt. Forward PE around 12.

Corrections or warnings are appreciated...

I agree with Dale that pre-tax gains is pretty much the only game in town.
Unfortunately, providing after-tax gains is not necessarily possible or better,
since tax consequences will vary a lot per individual.

I am surprised that people even can calculate their percentage gains. I have
only one portfolio that had no inflows and outflows for the year. And that's
the only one where I would claim a certain percentage gain (~11% this year).
Calculating gains for portfolios with inflows and outflows can be IMHO quite
misleading. Unless inflows and outflows are really small compared to the whole
portfolio, there are tons of things that would influence the calculated
returns: you have to adjust for when the inflows and outflows occurred, since
you cannot say that the money was held from January if it got into portfolio in
December. But if you adjust for the time, then you can get into games that the
new money earned outsized gains. You can get better (or worse) numbers by
getting the money in when portfolio is down and getting it out when portfolio
is up and so on...

All this is very unfortunate, since I would love to calculate my returns, but
everything I tried in the portfolios that get money in and out was IMHO very
unreliable.

The only other way that I tried to calculate my returns was comparing how my
investment did to what I would have gotten by investing into SP500, BRK, TAVFX
and LVTMX at exactly the times when inflows and outflows occurred. I do not
adjust for dividends though, since it would take too much time and I also do
not count commissions to buy them. In any case, after this year BRK is on top,
my portfolio is marginally worse (it was better last year, but BRK did >20%
this year compared to my ~11%) and the other three comparative investments
(SP500, TAVFX and LVTMX) are much lower. This method does not give a percentage
gains though.

I think the best value is ELP based on estimated earnings and potential growth
of their different business segments.

I also like Ultrapar Holdings Inc. (UGP) but it is expensive. I have watched it
more than double over the last two years but never started any position.

I am thinking to just average into iShares MSCI Brazil Index (EWZ). I am hoping
that as the dollar rises over the next six months (dead cat bounce), it will
provide me an entry point to build up my Brazil holdings.

I am very bullish on this sector and like you stated it is very volatile.

believe the payment is equivalent to $0.80/share after converting to $US

Ah yes, the famous case of the Beardstown Ladies.

Fame and fortune can disappear when you "forget" to account for the monies you
added to your portfolio during the year, when you calculate your balances at
year end.

At the time, I never could figure out how their % gains were possibly as great
as they suggested, given the typical stocks they were buying/recommending.
Further, I understand the power of compound wisdom and group knowledge, etc.,
but how a bunch of old lady amateurs could consistently - consistently - beat
(reported as percentage gains), professionals - professionals who are among the
brainiest people around, working min. 40 hours/wk at it, with their contacts
and their group knowledge -- well, that was too hard to believe. And that they
could outdo me too by such a great percentage, that was tough too!

You may need a subscription to WSJ to read the above. It's a "where are they
now" column dated May 1, 2006. Apparently the group (with new members entering,
older leaving/dying) is still buying and holding stocks for the long term (WMT,
CAKE, BBBY, types). Maybe doing very well at it. Because when they were
properly audited, the results did show that they did produce pretty darn good
results (well, imo): "... while a shocked and disappointed public turned its
back on the Beardstown Ladies, nobody really paid much attention to another
number the outside auditor had discovered: that the club's average annual
return from 1983 to 1997 was 15.3%, outpacing the Dow and the club's own
pedestrian 1984-93 returns." Plus, the club never got sucked into the dotcom

Jurgis - I rarely add or withdraw funds from my portfolios except for this

balance on 12/31. That includes commissions but not taxes, which vary widely

This year I am figuring results as if I hadn't made a withdrawal and simply
held those funds in cash since October. My overall portfolio is flat since the
withdrawal so it shouldn't make any difference.

What I am interested in is what the auditor calculated as their returns. IMHO,
if initial investment was $1000 and $25 (2.5%) is added every month, which ends
up being $300 yearly or 30% of initial investment, all kind of fluctuations
will affect the rate of return more than the "actual" investments. At least for
couple of years. At least possibly they did not allow withdrawals...

I have looked at various rate of return numbers in Quicken, which I assume
would be similar to what auditors use and it showed really crazy percentages.
So I gave up... Maybe I should relook it again...

Here are some things which complicate the rate of return calculations assuming
inflows/outflows:

- Start with $1000. Add $10000, earn 4% = $400, withdraw $10000. End with
$1400. 40% return? Not really, IMO.
- Start with $1000. Earn 20% return = $200. Add $1000 in December. End with
$2200. 10% return? Not really, IMO.
- Combine the two above and your head starts to spin.

It seems that Quicken calculates the return using something like the following:

-In = Sum initial amount and all inflows
-Out = Sum remaining amount and all outflows
- Divide Out/In.

This somewhat takes care of the first issue, but does not take care of the
second issue. It also does not take care of the following variant of the first
issue:

- Start with $1000. Earn 20% on it. Temporarily add $10000 for two days, earn
nothing for 2 days, withdraw $10000. Quicken says: 1000+10000=11000.
1200+10000=11200. 11200/11000=1.018 = 1.8% rate of return. Is this
fair/correct? Not really, IMO. You only invested $1000. But if that $10000
earned anything, you have to account for it too...

All examples are exaggerated for clarity, but all of them occur in reality.

I2 Some ideas coming up for you:

If I were giving stock to someone - like a young person - with no real interest
in the stock market, I would look for a stock that represents a company or
product the person might be familiar with and might see and remember the gift
when he/she does see the product/service/company. Jmo of course.

Anyway here is a bunch of suggestions. I own all these stocks; I've no idea or
opinion if these companies will be around and/or thrive in the next ten years
though.

HED: skiing/sporting equipment. An occasional dividend.

RUTH: The steakhouse. (If you can step up for $884 or go with just 50 shares)

RAD: The drugstore chain

GCT: College dorms/military housing. Great dividend. Stock trades though like
company's going out of business. And maybe it could.

GW: Oil service co. Maybe a little too esoteric a company for a gift of its
stock. Not a junk company though (imo).

GHS: community newspapers. Great dividend. Again, trading like it's going bk.
(And again, maybe it is)

CNTY: Gambling casinos. Maybe a fun annual report to read.

EVDVF.pk: Owns a lot Canroys. It's not quite a mutual fund. The person receving
this gets a dividend every month as a remembrance/reminder. Maybe some safety
in its diversification although it's sector bound (Canadian trusts)

not as safe because of higher leverage. those are not much fun for kids,
though.

For a kid i would probably go with DIS shares but of course you would not get a

hold VCP and it is still pretty cheap assuming cellulose market does not tank.
Everything else seems either expensive or not very attractive on ROE basis or
both.

Also Brazil seems to be a commodity proxy and I am somewhat hesitant about
commodities after significant runups as I mentioned in my posts about the
global growth cycle. My friend thinks that Brazil is the country most decoupled
from USA, but I am not sure it is very decoupled from China...

Peter Donohue/EKS/et. al. Regarding Brazil/CGM Focus Fund.

I prefer to pick the individual stocks at my price points, so I'll pass on EWZ.
Terrific results from DXZLX fund (Direxion Latin America Bull 2X Inv); I'll
pass on it too. I'm not understanding it, but it certainly could work for a
sector bet for others who want that. Apparently it holds ishares from several
Latin Am. countries and uses leverage to amplify the fund's results.

I'm a fan of Ken Heebner. And he's put up tremendous results this year in his
concentrated portfolio (and his other funds too). He has great ideas and themes
to bet on; he makes big bets, and when they work, they work. A big problem (for
me) in following what he does, is he can change his mind in an instant and sell
out twice as fast. Which somebody looking at his holdings doesn't see (since of
course, his holdings are reported only quarterly or later). In a Bloomberg TV
interview a couple days ago, he said he was already selling out fertilizer
stocks (The fertilizer story is already well-recognized in the market, he
said.) He was still very positive on Russian telecom, and on Brazil and PBR and
PBRA, and was hunting for more opportunities in Brazil.

Citigroup to Sell Shareholding in Brasil Telecom, Valor Reports

By Adriana Brasileiro

Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Citigroup Inc. and pension funds that own a controlling
stake in Brasil Telecom Participacoes SA, Brazil's third-biggest telephone
service provider, plan to sell their holdings in the company, Valor Economico
reported, without saying how it got the information.

The sale might pave the way for a merger with Tele Norte Leste Participacoes
SA, Brazil's biggest phone company, the newspaper said.

Citigroup owns 2.6 percent of Brasil Telecom's voting shares and an indirect
stake through Techold, a holding company that owns 62 percent of Brasil
Telecom's voting shares.

Speculation over a merger of Brasil Telecom with Tele Norte Leste arose early
last year when Brazilian media said the two companies were in talks.

Hi Jurgis - I noticed the same thing. My "value" screens are almost all red
today except for the beverage companies, a few utilities and one or two of the
health care companies.

I am looking at some of these beverage stocks but none pop out as good value
plays.

I have my eye on Companhia de Bebidas Das Americas (AMBEV) (ABV) but it is
still expensive.

My best performer today is JnJ and it is up only marginally.

I suspect many of my "value" picks on my watch list will become better buys as
this sell off proceeds so I am going to hold off on any new buys for a few
weeks.

The one positive is I am sitting on the most cash reserves in a long time so I
am ready to deploy these funds once there is more blood in the street.

look at this chart on TVIN. I bought 50 shares at .05 in 1998 and some more
around 11 cents. I traded out around 33 cents or so on the spike -- only to
watch it go to over $5.00!

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=TVIN&t=my

today its trading for less than my last sale.

with SPND my first buys were at 18 cents in 1998 and managed to hold for what
seemed like FOREVER since it didnt move much for YEARS. Then at the end of 2006
and beginning of 2007 I let go of the last of them in the 5- 6 dollar range.

I also had a biotech company that I bought for 2 cents when it was trading at
.001 x .02 . I later went to dollars but I sold the last of my shares around 30
cents :(

I'm probably a bit like you in that oftimes when I buy them and they dont work
out I ride them to zero more often than not.

otoh - I'VE NOT DONE WELL WITH BIG CAPS. Now and then I get lucky with them,
but I dont really have the grasp on big caps that I do on pennies. For one

"Although we are disheartened by the size of the offering, we note that most of

$45.25 each], somewhat mitigating the dilutive effect of the offering," said
S&P equity analyst Stuart Plesser. Sallie Mae had agreed to that "equity
forward purchase contract" in the hope its share price would rise, but the
shares have lost $15 billion in value since the collapse of the buyout.
Analysts estimate the contract could ultimately cost Sallie Mae $1-1.6 billion.

Grommit - OSK is an interesting pick. Formidable growth for many years due to
successful execution of a rollup strategy. the downside is quite a bit of debt
on the balance sheet and a negative tangible book value (due to high goodwill
from takeovers). I'd say it looks like a buy. GEHL of course is not as well

Well, as I mentioned it seems that most value purchases are not holding well.
And so far it seems that Buffett is the only one from "value" investors (there
is a paper characterizing Buffett as "growth" investor, which is partly
correct) who is doing well or at least somewhat OK in this market. Last year
was tough on Miller (down couple %), Whitman (close to S&P?), Pzena, Jim Clarke
:) and others. This year seems to be shaping pretty similarly so far.

So far I am not rebalancing. I don't think it is good idea to sell quality
companies predicting that they will not perform well in recovery. I would
rather sell some of the more dinky holdings, but most of them are so cheap by
now that switching also does not make much sense. I got rid of TLB and NUTR
last year and I may try to rebalance this year too.

My purchases so far are coming from selling mutual funds that I was holding in

Thanks for reminding me. I had forgotten that discussion and if was mentioned
in the Nov 26 Barron's article which was bullish on the stock when it was
selling at 17, I didn't include it in my notes.

But it makes me wonder, if YRCW book value is purportedly $40.50 and the stock
is selling at 12.62 as of close Friday, is it possible YRCW could be bought out
(If credit were available) and the new owner could repudiate or re-negotiate
the pension obligations? Or would the co. have to go the route of threatening
Chap. 11 to bring the unions to the bargaining table -- (I'm thinking of the

another consideration for your IRA account is a "self-directed IRA".

I put some money in one of these and have purchase tax-lien properties, first
trust deed, etc.

for example. I bought 5 pieces of tax lien properties for a total of about
$10,000 in my IRA - then a broker sold one of them for $15k. The same broker
who sold that one has two others listed for $15k each. when these properties
sell the profits go back into the IRA tax deferred. i call these "penny
properties"

I also had a friend ask me to purchase a first trust deed he inherited. My IRA
custodian purchase it for just over 50% of face value and the the monthly
payments go into my IRA account tax deferred (it would be tax-free if it was a
ROTH).

Re: JNJ and quality companies in this downturn.

There is pretty good article in New York Times arguing that large cap growth
may outperform value this year too. Search for "Going for Growth, Even in a
Slowdown" on NYT site or Google. Main points are that tech and pharmas are more
recession proof, while other large-cap growth stocks have not run up much in
the last 5 years underperforming S&P (KO, PEP come to mind) so they may not
decline much. Or looking from other side, the bull was driven by cyclical and
value stocks mostly, so they may decline a lot. Apart from pharmas being
"growth" stocks - they have not been such in quite a while IMO - this does make
sense.

Of course, it all gets into definition of "value" and "growth" stocks too.

JNJ - Jurgis you may well be correct. JNJ is a high quality company and may
indeed to resistant to decline. i just believe it's fully valued right now and
don't see much growth for at least 2-3 years, so i think there are better large
cap values out there, one of them being GE which seems on track to grow at
least 10%.

Barrons also has an article arguing that the industrials may be vulnerable
going into a recession or slowdown as they only declined a few % so far. Those
safe stock market havens may be in jeopardy as well.

A few ideas I have been tossing around,beyond GE:

CAH - pharma distribution (I own some already).

Japanese large caps (CAJ SSUMY etc, discussed here)

EWT, Taiwan ETF (low PE of around 12-13, China growth), TSM is a taiwanese
holding in the Semi sector that i own already as well and is worth buying, IMO

TYC: industrial and somewhat cyclical, Security business probably recession
resistant.

TAVIX reopened late last year, so I am adding it to my TAVFX holdings. Was

decided to hold so far. I don't think China and India are cheap anymore, so I
would not hold any significant country-fund positions there, but some minor

pointing out how difficult they are to analyze, and/or how dangerous they might
be, and how for you, you'd at best not be interested in them and at worst would
avoid them. -g-

I know I know. :)

Of course, this is the risk and the curse of mutual fund investing. :)

On one hand, if you invest in a fund that plays in the same vein as you do,
then either you are acknowledging that the manager is better than you - and you
should not invest yourself, or he is worse than you are - and you should not
buy the fund.

On the other hand, if you invest in a fund that plays very differently from
you, then either you don't trust your own investing method and his method is
better - so you should not invest yourself, or he is worse than you are - and
you should not buy the fund. :))))

I made very good gains on IIF, TDF, and IGE. But looking at the stocks they
hold... hmm, I am not sure I would want to be there, except for IGE. :) If I
subtract IIF, TDF, IGE and BRK (which is a fund too in some sense) from my
portfolio performance, I am not sure I am left with much positive. Maybe this
is an indication to switch to funds and stop active investing. :) On the other
hand, this does not stop people like FAIRX from investing 20% into BRKA and
becoming great, finalist, Morningstar 5-star, stock manager of the year
managers. ;)

Maybe the positive way to look at holding mutuals is if you believe that there
is some area that you have to invest into, but you don't have expertise in that
area. Then it may be worthwhile to buy a fund that has a manager with expertise
in that area.

i had put my wife in oakmark select and pulled out of there after being
concerned with wm being something like 18% of the portfolio. I didnt feel like
paying for all those unrealized gains.

That's what I'm doing. For example Indonesia Fund and India Fund, where the
individual stocks don't trade easily for me, and also importantly, are tough
for me to get financial info. about or come to some comfort level with. (aside:
I do like the heavy weighting in Indonesia Fund's telecom stock though.)

http://www.etfconnect.com/select/fundpages/global.asp?MFID=3883

And some of these funds do mysterioso things with their holdings. Such that -
for example - RIT can yield out 15% when none of its holdings (that I see --
and I could miss a lot) has such a great yield (and the discount of RIT to nav
doesn't seems so great as to give that great yield by itself I am suspecting.)
So fund guys are leveraging somewhere in there, I presume. Ergo risky. The
yield, etc. attract though.

--------
For me with so many positions, buying most funds now I'd be looking at now
means I'd just be adding to a bunch of positions I've previously established at
earlier prices. I'm not willing to do that (add) en masse. I suspect that might
be so also for others here with some funds too - like FAIRX. Somebody here who
might look at FAIRX now already might have a position in BRK. Maybe also CNQ,
mentioned here a few times at lower price than now. (I'm in.) Maybe LUK too,
mentioned here before and on Buffettology thead. (I have LUK too.) LUK owns a
slug of EMN, so FAIRX double owns it by itself (EMN) and by having LUK. PWE too
FAIRX has, and PWE has been mentioned here several times. So somebody buying
FAIRX maybe isn't exactly late to the party (unless the party (market) is
crashing), but the person here who's considering buying FAIRX now already had
many opportunities to buy these stocks, maybe has bought these stocks. So
FAIRX's attractiveness - with its nav consisting of roughly 50% in these stocks
- is diminished now. (Not criticizing FAIRX - just is an example for me, why it
holds no buying attraction. Although I am interested in what they next purchase
or sell.)

I think you hit the nail on the head there. :)

Just a OT question: IIF has underperformed IFN and INP last year. Any thoughts
about shifting to one of them? INP is trading premium over NAV though...

Some recent changes, additions

Sold some VTV, LM , SNY
Added EWT and CAH, AB

AB is an asset manager that was mentioned in Barron's. Well worth a look
(decent valuation and strong asset growth). I redeployed funds from the partial
sale of LM into AB.

An old thread fav perhaps from years back - BONT - may be in buying range
again...also perhaps.

That's now some drop in stock from recent highs:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=BONT&t=5y

Stock on new low list at low $6's, I see. I wouldn't be surprised (but I would
be disappointed) to see the stock in $3's (or lower) again as when it was
discussed here 2000-2003. Price/sales ratio per Yahoo is just .03 though;
that's lower now than it was then. A positive, assuming sales don't dry up if
there's a recession.

I'm in this a.m. for a few shares, but just a few.
