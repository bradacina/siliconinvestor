I'm buying AXAS all the way down today.

=========
I read AXAS managers' bonus depends on the increase in company's nav. So maybe
there's some incentive to present number in most favorable light. Company has
reported 1pnav is $2.57/sh and 2pnav is $16.37/sh.

That 2p number does make the stock attractive to me at current price.

Moderating some of my concern (The stock's being sold down to a 12-mo low on no
adverse news that I see), is that AXAS is in several very good prospective
shale plays: Eagle Ford, Three Forks, Niobrara. Wolfberry too, may be one that
could prove to be good.

RGA: Averaging up once again on my small position with a few share add today.

I like that this is a reinsurer of life insurance, rather than being a property
& casualty reinsurer. I am guessing this will mean less profitability than the
p&c guys, but also less volatility and less risk. A steady-eddie I expect, as I
mentioned in an earlier post. Stated bv has come back after a drop in '08; p/bv
= .87 (per Yahoo); p/e 7-8 with a teeny dividend.

Aberdeen International update (AAB.TO, AABVF),

I am buying back some trading shares I sold at 0.83 and 0.84 CAD (after the
undesired election results). I have always liked the stock, but I thought the
discount might widen after the Peruvian election results, which it has.

The stock is now at 0.77 CAD and its major holding Sulliden (SUE.TO, 2.22 CAD)
seems to be recovering on news that the new Peruvian president Humala is acting
moderately so far.

To save on currency costs, I am keeping sales proceeds in CAD, so I don't keep

June 10, 2011 8:48 AM EDT

Canaccord Genuity maintains a 'Buy' on Voyager Oil & Gas (NYSE: VOG), PT $5.50.

Canaccord analyst, John Gerdes, said, "Our conviction is strengthened based on
insights from our recent marketing event and improving capital productivity in
2011/2012. At present, we believe the market is undervaluing Voyager’s Bakken
position and we believe the stock is too cheap for a company with its liquidity
position and relative growth potential. In our view, the company’s acreage and
development strategy should drive material NAV accretion in 2011. The most
important upcoming catalysts include a potential Niobrara divestiture and
continued organic leasing activity."

<u>7 Commodity Stocks to Consider on Current Weakness </u>
by: Alex B. Gray June 12, 2011
http://seekingalpha.com/article/274409-7-commodity-stocks-to-consider-on-curren
-weakness?source=yahoo

From the article:"...Terra Nova Royalty (TTT) is coming off a year of
tremendous change in 2010. For an explanation of the events that have
transformed Terra Nova into the company it is today, please read this previous
article by Clemens Scholl. I believe that confusion over what the company
really is and where it plans to go have held the stock price back. However, the
company is starting to shed light on its current and future direction. After
some positive notes from the year-end earnings release and conference call at
the end of March, the stock got a nice boost jumping from under $8 per share to
$8.88 before settling at $8.61. Since that time the stock drifted lower,
falling below its preannouncement share price. The company then announced first
quarter results and the stock again popped over $8 per share, but has drifted
lower ever since.

The company's primary driver of revenues is its commodities trading business,
however it also has a royalty interest in an iron ore mine in Canada operated
by Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF) as well as other investments. I believe the
recent sell-off is not as much related to any specific commodity, but rather
concern about the overall demand for commodities in the face of some weak
economic reports...."

Terra Nova Royalty (TTT) might make a good add to my other natural resource
commodity stocks.

TTT,

I still own some TTT at a 5.05 (spin-off adjusted) cost basis from a rights
offering situation I recommended here last year.

I have one comment on management that may or may not be helpful. Michael Smith
is a smart CEO, but his companies often have complex ownership structures and
transactions. I think he and his top investors make out well, but you have to
be careful to look out for your own interests. (I have joked that Smith seems
to me to be a mixture of Warren Buffet and Jeff Skilling.)

For example, TTT had a rights offering and a couple spin-offs of KHDHF shares,
then a merger with MFCA (I think that is the ticker), apparently to the
detriment of MFCA. What's more, KHDHF shares then had their own rights
offering.

Participating in all these worked out, but those not paying attention got
heavily diluted.

And then in Q1 this year management had 7.3 million of share expense for newly
issued stock options.

On the other hand I like being able to own smart managers at a reasonable
price. A commodity sell off is not necessarily bad for them, as it might allow
them to buy a company/royalty on the cheap.

Hi Jurgis -

Been going through the Sprott Resources 2010 annual report and from what I see
their vast collection of partnerships began from 2007 forward. They did make a
substantial gain from the sale of their coal assets.

Their 83% ownership in Waseca Energy is an Oil & Gas development company that
Paul Senior might find has significant value. They have grown their production
by over 100% from the prior year and are on schedule to completed 62
developmental wells in 2011. Their development is on 45,000 acres located in
central Alberta and Saskatchewan Canada.

This is a very interesting company w/ a collection of "hard" assets ranging
from Agriculture land, fertilizer operations, gold and Oil. That I like and
each generates their own revenue stream. The way the company is structured w/ a
separate management company earns a base fee of 2% of the NAV (paid quarterly)
plus a very liberal profit sharing arrangement (as much as 20% of the net
profits from each partnership). It's almost like a hedge fund. You give a lot
of the upside away with such an arrangement.

Lots of things done w/ warrants & stock options in 2007 to raise capital to
arrive at today's company structure.

As I make my way through their annual reports I am sure I will learn more about
their operations and profitability. At least I should get some new ideas on
companies to but especially in the Ag area.

I probably would not invest in this group because of the way compensation is
made to the management company. I do like their collection of assets. I have
been trying to build a similar collection for my portfolio.

Thanks for the info. I agree that it's a public hedge fund and that the
renumeration scheme is a negative. I guess it might be a buy if they were
really good at what they do. That's also why I'd like to know the reason of
their collapse in 2000's: was that before current management? was it the same
management, but different approach to things/holdings? was there some
(reverse?) takeover by current management of existing company/assets?

Anyway, keep us posted on your discoveries. I may get to digging through the
Sprott info sometime, but not sure when that will happen. ;)

company saying that they had been advised by legal that they could not buy back
shares seemed ridiculous to me . especially given all the option repricing that

Trading at a 20% book value and near the lows for the year is nothing special
for a reinsurer.

FWIW PTP is an OK buy in terms of valuation and track record but again nothing
special. AGII, TRH, AWH, ALTE, PRE, XL and many others are valued fairly
similar and fairly comparable. It is a good time to establish a position in a

Energy Transfer Equity (ETE) said today it has agreed to acquire Southern Union

debt.

The company owns and operates one of the nation’s largest natural gas pipeline
systems with more than 20,000 miles of gathering and transportation pipelines
and one of North America’s largest liquefied natural gas import terminals.

Southern Union’s interstate pipeline interests operate more than 15,000 miles
of pipelines that transport natural gas from the major producing areas to major
markets in the Southeast, Midwest and Great Lakes region. Southern Union’s
natural gas transmission units include Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company,
Trunkline Gas Company, Sea Robin Pipeline Company, Trunkline LNG Company (one
of the nation’s largest LNG import terminals) and Southwest Gas Storage.
Through CCE Holdings, LLC, Southern Union also owns an interest in and operates
Florida Gas Transmission.

The $7.9 Billion price tag for SUG is 70% of the Market Cap of Energy Transfer

ETE is up almost 6% on the news.

Hi Keith -

My bet is with Intel but I also own some MSFT and NOK. Intel to me is a value
buy anywhere below $20.00/share. They are supposed to be working on an ARM low
powered processor that will be used in the next generation smart phones and
tablets. They missed the 1st generation chips to NVDA. Apple is also talking to
INTEL for the manufacturing of their own proprietary chip (developed through
their own subsidiary company recently purchased).

Therefore, based on the intrinsic value in Intel, it might be the best value.

I also have a small bet in the NOK & MSFT alliance owning shares in both of
these companies. My basis in these companies is at higher prices. I think with
NOK now at $5.94/share, the worst it priced into the stock. The new NOK Mobile
7 smart phone (MSFT Mobile 7 OS) s/b available late this year early next year.

EIfvMIkLv7gF;_ylu=X3oDMTExYzFvNTI2BHBvcwM0BHNlYwN5ZmlUYWJsaXN0BHNsawNkZXRhaWxlZ
--

So I own 25% MSFT, 25% NOK and 50% INTC. The mix nets a 4% dividend (If NOK
maintains their 7% annual dividend) too. The three stocks represent a 1.8% of
the portfolio so it is still a small bet for me.

P.S. RIMM out w/ earnings which miss. They warn for the future " fiscal 2012
w/b challenging". Stock down over 16% in AH to $29.50/share (in active
trading).

Agree w/Clownbuck about those days (daze).

Then as now, I remain fully invested. Late '08-'09 I reduced my 100% equity
risk by moving from some equity positions into bond etfs and also into some
preferred stocks. The preferreds were those that were mentioned/recommended by
others on this thread at the time.

I again followed some others here and sold almost all those preferreds as the
market recovered; I have kept all the bond etfs.

=====================================

As I look back at the stocks I bought during that time, I seem to have bought
the stocks that looked attractive to me based on my value criteria. These seem
to have been 2nd or 3rd tier stocks. In retrospect, maybe I should have stepped
up for more 1st tier stocks (e.g. MCD,PG), because these were beat down as
well, and buys then could provide a basis for long-term buy-and-hold. (Whereas
the value stocks were sold if they just recovered in price.)

I seem to be in the same mode now as then: I continue to buy small e&p
companies which have downtrodden stock prices, and which appeal to me. VOG is
one discussed here that keeps falling to new lows. I'm buying more of such dink
companies -- some days for some of these, I am the only buyer of shares. I do
scan the low list, and if/when I see some of the S&P 500 there, this time, I'll
consider such more carefully.

The main thing for me is that I am trying to not let a low stock price or a
falling stock price determine my SELL decision.

I did add 20% to my significant position in Itochu 8001.T tonight. It's a
pretty cheap basic material (minerals, energy) and infrastructure play. I
decided to average up because it looks very cheap - furthermore their plan is
to increase the dividend substantially to 33Yen/share in 2002 - not bad for a
stock trading at 780 Yen currently.

This is a company that is still not the most efficiently managed but it's
getting better and strong since i first looked at it in 2008. They were smart
to buy mining assets (iron ore etc.) in 2008/2009 when they were available at
attractive prices and used their ability to issue cheap debt in Japan at very
low rates at a time when the credit market were frozen. Now instead of the 3

the problem with this is that nobody goes to jail. all this means is that the
sec gets a judgement which may or may not be collected upon. the ways that
shareholders get screwed are many and the only reason these people got nailed
is that almost everything they did was illegal. I once made a value investment
in an ase traded semiconductor company. the company then sold its most valuable
division to another company for a pittance. the ceo and large shareholder of my
company, got an extensive long term contract as well as signficant shares in
the new company, when i asked why this sale wasnt voted upon by shareholders I
was told that the company did not deem it a material transaction. Im sure I
complained to the SEC about it at the time and got some form letter response.

Then there was my investment in Sepracor. the stock dropped from $50 to about
$4 when some drug they thought would be approved by the fda wasnt because the
fda suddenly changed the information they were looking for in a study. the
stock reversed course and went up to about $12, and then the company announced
that they had repriced all employee options from $50 to $6. A few months after
that the company got approval for some insomnia medicine and it was off to the
races again but without me and other former shareholders i suspect.

These shareholder abuses will continue as will government fraud until they
start putting lots of people in jail for it.
I think very few people have gone to jail for all the mortgage fraud that was
done, unless they sold property or took loans against property that wasnt

The overvaluation of the Real should already be baked in the earnings forecasts
and should not be an issue. Vale sells their product allover the world
denominated in US$. So if the Real falls, their costs will fall and with
everything being equal, their earnings (measured in US$) should rise.

A falling real will be a problem for those holding Brazilian financial stocks

Clownbuck,

I annualized the first quarter results - based on my assumptions, VALE's stock
is trading at 8x free cash flow, which could be a steal. It could be a good
overall hedge against inflation in the developed world.

The way I view the real is similar to the Australian $ - they are both
commodity currencies.

How do you view government's stake and meddling into the deals of VALE?

Watch this Eike Batista interview - his father was once president of VALE. It
might make you feel better about the investment.

Dico - regarding Vale - there is no question that a stock with 5$/ share in
earnings, trading at 30$/share is cheap. There is a risk that prices for their
products (foremost iron ore) are in a bubble and could tumble, taking Vale's
earnings with them.

On the other side, Vale's net debt of only 11B$ (<10% of their market cap)
makes their balance sheet robust enough wi withstand just about downturn
without having to issue equity.

the fact that they operate their own fleet of iron ore bulk careers to move
their product does not bother me. 18 ships will probably only cost ~1B$, which
is chicken feed for a company with 150B$ in market cap. They have a strategy to
be an integrated player, having their own shipping logistics and power
generation, which i feel is probably an advantage and makes sense, since they
are not capital constraint. I do think that they should pay a much higher
dividend.

Overall it's a small starter position, nothing more. there may be opportunities
to buy share cheaper.I would be willing to do so, provided fundamentals stay in
place.

Hi Dan -

Isn't it interesting that the Enterprise Value for NOK & RIMM are the same,
both around $12.5B.

Nokia's hidden jewel is the Nokia Siemens Networks. This division is a joint
venture between Nokia Oyj (50.1%) and Siemens AG (49.9%) Germany. They design
and build cellular infrastructure & equipment. Revenue € 12.661 billion (2010)
Operating income € 686 million (2010)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Siemens_Networks

I am not too sure what the hidden assets for RIMM are (perhaps their
proprietary email delivery system). It looks like Stephen Jarislowsky (formerly
the company’s sixth-biggest investor, with 10.2 million shares of RIM at the
end of the first quarter) has sold more than half of his stake.
http://noir.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aPOqXHChirB8&pos=6

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am not too sure if either company is a good value based on the market share
each owns. My bet continues w/ NOK & MSFT, however my last transaction was a
sale of 20% of my NOK shares on 5/11/2011 for $8.52/share. I am not tempted to
buy any of those shares back at this point even through the stock traded in the
$5.98/share area last week.

At some point The Nokia Siemans Network JV could be spun off but I am not sure
what value it would bring to NOK shareholders. This partnership contributed
almost 20% of NOK's $61.5 B in revenues. Maybe it's worth $1.00/share on it's
own especially with their telecommunication Infrastructure contract(s) in
China.

At least w/ NOK there is some hope (and a vision towards transition products)
with two very compelling partners Siemens and Microsoft. The initial recovery
in handsets for NOK could be w/ MSFT Enterprise customers as these devices will
provide a secure extension to the office which neither Apple nor Android
products can claim.

This will be an interesting transition to watch. Keep tuned.

re NOKIA - I would not buy a failing company like Nokia based on the dividend
it used to pay. it is very likely that Nokia will reduce or entirely eliminate
it's dividend going forward so safe cash. this company is fighting for
survival.

RIMM is in a similar boat - they are run over by Android and Iphones. No
competitive phones until next year. They announced 500k shipment of their
playbook but did not talk about how many they sold. I suspect it's a bust,
there is no buzz around the playbook. Motorola's Zoom (which was overpriced
when it came out) is a bust too.

Wayne Gretzky once that that you have to run where the puck is going, not where
it is right now.

This is the problem with companies like RIMM and NOK - they are cheap based on
what their financials were 3 month ago but they are probably not cheap based on
where their financials are going to look like next year. Declines in the tech
business can happen very fast. this is from a bagholder of a few CSCO shares

I've been looking at NOK recently.
This is a Morningstar analysis I read the other day:
Thesis 05/31/11

Abandoning its failing Symbian and Meego platforms and partnering with
Microsoft MSFT to develop handsets for Microsoft's fledgling Windows Phone 7
platform may be a longshot, but we think it is Nokia's best hope.

In our view, Nokia has three strengths: handset design, scale, and
distribution. Although Microsoft hasn't had a decent share of the handset
market for many years, we are impressed by what we've seen from Windows Phone
7, and think that it may have the chance to grab a niche of the high-end of the
smartphone market (perhaps starting with businesses, given its Office and
Exchange support) and build from there. Arguably, Windows Phone 7 has been
hobbled by the lack of a competitive flagship phone.

Despite its failure to gain share at the high end of the smartphone market,
Nokia still knows how to design hardware. High-end phones like the N8 and the
older N97, along with Nokia's Booklet 3G netbook are marvels of hardware
design, in our view. The specifications are amazing and the design is
beautiful; where they fall flat is with the operating system and applications.

Another thing that Nokia brings to the table is scale, as the firm commands
roughly a third of worldwide market for handset devices. Manufacturing products
in 10 countries across Europe, Latin America, and Asia gives Nokia a lot of
flexibility. It can react to changes in the mix of products demanded by its
customers by shifting production to different facilities. It can also shift
production to regions where component prices (and exchange rates) are most
favorable to Nokia's cost structure, and it can quickly switch suppliers in
order to get the best possible pricing.

Nokia's other key advantage, in our opinion, is its deep distribution channels
in most parts of the world, including rapidly growing markets such as China and
India. While it is not yet clear whether this is a real long-term advantage,
Nokia has recently demonstrated a notable advantage in markets where consumers
demand entry-level (less than EUR 50) phones. In such markets, the firm holds
roughly 50% share and still earns decent margins. We expect sales volume in
emerging markets to continue to surge, but we think emerging competition from
the major Asian handset makers, along with smaller niche companies targeting
specific local markets using custom-built (and sometimes even counterfeit)
phones, could weigh further on prices. For this reason, we think it is critical
that Nokia gain share at the high end and midrange of the handset market.

Nokia has dominated the mobile phone business for nearly as long as that market
has been in existence, but more recently it has been on the defensive against
Apple AAPL, RIM RIMM, and the makers of the Android handset. Its partnership
with Microsoft at least gives Nokia a chance to change that dynamic; while it
is a slim chance, it is still a bigger chance than Nokia had while clinging to
Symbian.

Valuation

We are lowering our fair value estimate to $13 from $15. Although we had
boosted our fair value estimate to $15 from $13 earlier in the year to reflect
lower operating expenses, management's announcement that sales are declining
more rapidly and that gross margins are contracting more sharply has led us to
change our views. We now think that the company is likely to post negative free
cash flows in 2011 due to a combination of lower operating margins and higher
inventories.

Our five-year revenue forecast now calls for a 1.6% compound annual revenue
growth rate, which is down from our prior estimate of 3%. We don't assume that
the Nokia/Windows partnership sets the world on fire; we merely assume that it
allows Nokia to stabilize its market share and its gross margins, and to
generate marginally positive economic returns as a commodity handset vendor.

The Nokia Siemens Network and NAVTEQ businesses are immaterial to our
valuation.

Risk

Now that Nokia has announced it is abandoning its own operating systems and
switching to Windows Phone 7, Nokia's future is closely tied to Microsoft's
future in the mobile device market. Given that Microsoft has not had a
significant market share in that market in quite a while, and given the
enormous head start that Android and iOS have, we think that Nokia and
Microsoft face an uphill battle.

In order to reflect these conditions, and to reflect the risks of betting on a
currently unreleased product line, we are raising our uncertainty rating to
very high from high. Once we have better visibility into Nokia's Windows Phone
portfolio, we expect to return to a high uncertainty rating.

Management & Stewardship

Nokia recently replaced CEO Oli-Pekka Kallasvuo (who held that role since 2006)
with Stephen Elop. Elop, a Canadian, is the first non-Finn to take the helm at
Nokia. Elop previously headed Microsoft's business division, which houses the
Microsoft Office suite. Additionally, he formerly held high-level positions at
Juniper, Macromedia, and Adobe. His absence of telecom and handset experience
signals to us that Nokia realizes that it needs more software experience to tap
the rapidly growing smartphone market.

Overview

Financial Health: Nokia is in solid financial shape. The firm is sitting on
around EUR 11 billion in cash and investments versus under EUR 4 billion in
debt. Despite the declining demand for its products, Nokia has continued to
generate positive cash flow, but we could see free cash flows falling into
negative territory in 2011.

Profile: Nokia is the world's largest manufacturer of mobile devices and a
leader in mobile network equipment and software. The company's mobile phones
provide consumers with experiences in voice, video, gaming, navigation,
imaging, and music. Through its 50%-owned Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture,
the company provides equipment and services to network operators, service
providers, and corporations.

Seriously, some people here might think that they know where the puck is going,
but they only look at small (cheap) pucks. Or they try to follow twenty pucks.
Or they jump from one puck to another. Or something.

Sure, I agree, NOK is crap, RIMM is crap. And I am totally sure that Apple in

Rosetta Resources http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ROSE : positive article in

I liked the original Rosetta write-up in Barron's last June, and this new
update gives me some confidence to continue holding shares. If Rosetta does

if stock resumes its uptrend and goes over $50.

ml

Things just keep getting better and better at Rosetta Resources.

As readers of these pages may recall, Houston-based Rosetta (ticker: ROSE) is a
smallish oil-and-gas outfit run by a team of seasoned execs who left top jobs
at industry giants like ConocoPhillips to strike out on their own. What they
were eager to build, as Barron's explained in a thumbs-up story ("Resourceful
Rosetta," June 14, 2010), was a company that could exploit unconventional
energy sources like shale. At the time, the stock was 25. It got as high as 51
earlier this month and closed Friday at 42.98.

The juice for the strong performance has been Rosetta's remarkable
transformation from a run-of-the-oil-patch producer into a potential
powerhouse, thanks to the speed and efficiency with which it is moving to
exploit its vast acreage in two of the country's most promising shale plays.
One is the Southern Alberta Basin in northern Montana, conceivably the next big
thing if it proves an extension of the enormously productive Williston Basin to
the east. Rosetta holds 300,000 acres.

An even more important catalyst has been the astonishing pace of development in
the Eagle Ford in South Texas. From virtually nothing a year ago, output last
quarter spurted to 89 million cubic feet equivalent a day, almost 60% of total
production. Even after divestitures, year-end output should jump to 185-195
MMcfe/d—with the Eagle Ford chipping in a whopping 80% of that.

Production from these wells has put them on a pace to outstrip early estimates
of what they will yield over their lifetimes, a benchmark already ratcheted up
from four billion cubic feet equivalent to 7.2 Bcfe. Output is low-cost and
liquids-rich, so margins are expanding apace. And it's just the beginning:
Rosetta has drilled only 7% of its prospects in a field that accounts for less
than half of its 65,000-acre Eagle Ford stake. Moreover, while current wells
recover a mere 14% of the hydrocarbons in the ground, Rosetta believes that it
eventually might recover as much as 25% by drilling more wells closer together.

Fueled by the Eagle Ford, earnings are expected to hit $1.80 a share this year
and $3.30 next, while cash flow is pegged at just under $6 a share this year
and close to $9 in 2012.

Meanwhile, in the Alberta Basin, Rosetta has drilled 11 vertical test wells
spread across its vast acreage. John Clayton, its vice president of asset
development, says that the company has found "large accumulations of oil in
every well." Significantly, Rosetta has shelved the idea of a partner, choosing
instead to drill three horizontal wells on its own dime, says CEO Randy
Limbacher, because "we like what we see so much."

Rosetta's stock is going for about seven times this year's estimated cash flow
and under five times 2012's. It sells well below a net asset value of $60 to
$65, which by no means fully reflects the terrific potential of the Alberta
Basin. Should that play pan out, the stock could double.

re AAPL - I agree with regards to Apple Apple had Jobs at the helm who steered
Apple towards new products, like the ipod and itunes. I remember that Apple
started to rise when itunes announced their download numbers from itunes. I
failed act on this, as I did not understand the business implications.

But I learned from this that you need to look at the new products and their
potential first to detect a turnaround - financials are going to move way later
(although not too late in the case of AAPL to make good money). Based on what I
see, neither RIMM (which delayed their newest phones by 6 month, as I
understand it) nor NOK has anything up their sleeve. If they do bring out
products that generate excitement, they could become a buy.

I believe that with respect to new products, GOOG looks pretty good. I think
their existing products do well (Search, Gmail, youtube) and Android secured
them a space in mobile that they can monetize. I think they should also offer
online storage (like Dropbox), it would be a natural fit.

As for the Wyne Gretzky thing it's one thing to guess exactly where the puck is
moving but it's quite easier know if it's moving in one direction or the other.
My guess is that it's moving away from RIMM and NOK for at least 3-6month
(which is an entire generation in the phone business). NOK manufacturing, which
was very integrated with seen as one of their main advantages and I see that
this will become a liability, since they have nothing to fill their factories.
This will result in a substantial restructuring and writeoffs, hardly the stuff
that causes a stock to rally. Once their new windows phones come out, I am
going to maker a new determination, probably based on the vibes I see in forums
like howardsforums (Cell phone message boards).

Hi Paul -

Re: Rosetta Resources, Inc. (ROSE)

It looks like the company has profited from the development of the Natural Gas
resources on their Eagle Ford properties.
http://shale.typepad.com/eaglefordshale/rosetta-resources/
05/31/2011
<u>Rosetta Resources Moves Forward On Eagle Ford Shale Program During First
Quarter Of 2011</u>

Rosetta Resources (ROSE) reported on its Eagle Ford Shale development activity
during the first quarter of 2011. The company is putting 90% of its 2011
capital budget into the Eagle Ford Shale and plans to drill forty wells here in
2011.

Rosetta Resources completed nine wells, and reported production of 89 million
cubic feet of natural gas equivalents per day during the first quarter of 2011.
As of 5/1/2011, production from the Eagle Ford Shale was 120 million cubic feet
of natural gas equivalents per day.

Rosetta Resources has completed 31 wells since entering the play and is
operating three rigs. The company is planning to drill between ten and twelve
horizontal wells during the second quarter of 2011.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

They seem to have divested themselves from their other high cost properties
selling holdings located in Sacramento CA. and Yuma County Colorado (Rosetta
completed the previously announced sale of its DJ Basin properties in Yuma
County, Colorado on March 31, 2011 and the divestiture of its Sacramento Basin
assets in California on April 15, 2011. The combined sales price for the
properties totaled $255 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.)

It appears that their recent strategy at Eagle Ford is to build out a midstream
NG collection system(s) or at least partnership with one or more companies as
the company will invest $325 million in midstream capital in the Eagle Ford
Shale area. (
http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/midstream-development-vigorous-eagle-ford-
hale-play?page=2 ).

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Is this why you originally purchased the company? Did you value their assets
based on their NG and midstream operation(s)?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have noticed that many of the small E&P companies that have experienced huge
growth recently bought and/or developed inexpensive NG resources and built
Midstream operations to service their new wells. This strategy adds significant
value to the company and allows them to be a low cost producers when using the
new horizontal fracking technology (especially when upgrading the current
producing wells w/ horizontal laterals).

540,000 MMBtu per day of natural gas, ETP will significantly expand the
previously announced Rich Eagle Ford Mainline (REM) pipeline in South Texas and
will construct a new processing facility in Jackson County, Texas....".

I wonder if this is their strategy for their Southern Alberta Basin properties?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

My take away and an emerging long term value proposition is to identify low
cost producer of NG resources that can also develop a profitable Midstream
operation. Rosetta Resources seems to have found a strong midstream partner in
ETP.

I am currently researching another company that has a similar strategy and has
made investments of over $140M in the last six months accumulating the
necessary assets (on the cheap) to build such an operation.

Here is a hint for a company doing the same thing. They bought their core NG
assets in a bankruptcy sale February 2010 for $81M (
http://www.mariettatimes.com/page/content.detail/id/519755.html ). I love it
when they can buy very profitable assets for $0.50 on the dollar.

Hi EKS. Re. ROSE, I've primarily liked that they were in several geographically
diverse shale oil plays. And for a small company they had relatively larger
market cap and more net acres than the other similar small multi-play shale oil
companies I was buying at the time. I viewed their gas production as an
impediment to their oil shale possibilities. I was sorry to read of their sale
of their Niobrara assets. (Non-core asset sale, they said.)

Apparently, their significant gas production is positive for them as they
concentrate on their Eagle Ford properties. (ROSE has 15k acres for dry gas,
50K for liquids there.) And of course there's their opportunity with their
holdings in the Alberta Bakken.

Hi Paul -

Re: Pengrowth Energy Corporation (NYSE: PGH)
Enerplus Corporation Common Sto (NYSE: ERF)

Have you ever looked at PGH? Here is an interactive Map of their operations in
Canada: http://www.pengrowth.com/operations

I was thinking about starting a position and perhaps peeling a few shares off
of ERF and buying PGH.

After checking out the McDep report ( http://www.mcdep.com/rtweek110520.pdf )
it shows that ERF (0.89) is still undervalued even when compared to PGH (0.96).
My only argument is PGH has more exposure to NG and if NG moves higher relative
to crude oil, then it should out perform. The dividend yield is a about .5%
lower.

I have listed the <u>The Bottom Line Cash Payers</u> according to the McDep
ranking here. Note: Most over valued to lowest)

Adding shares of Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao (CBD, NYSE- $41.73)

Speculation has been put forth in the investment media suggesting that
Carrefour is interested in selling/merging their substantial retail business in
Brazil to CBD.

http://brazilglobal.net/2011/05/23/carrefour-merging-in-brazil/

Shares of potential acquirers typically decline on news of mergers or
purchases. The recent share price movement in CBD, down approximately 9.3%
since May 2nd, is not inconsistent with takeover valuation movements.

CBD is Brazil's largest grocer and electronics retailer.

Until 2010, the firm grew organically. In 2010, a colossal acquisition took
place. CBD merged with privately held Casas Bahias, Brazil's leading furniture
and electronics retailer. The combined CBD/Casas Bahias now holds a commanding
#1 market share in groceries, consumer electronics and appliances in Brazil.
Carrefour, with roughly an 11% market share in grocery items, is a distant
second. Wal-Mart remains in 3rd place, and has been unable to close the market
share gap with Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao.

A merger with Carrefour and CBD could be WILDLY accretive to CBD in the medium
term.

Assuming that CBD were to complete such a merger, and assuming that Carrefour
sells the Brazilian unit at roughly 11x EV/EBITDA, CBD would wind up issuing
about 200 million shares in an exchange. Potential synergies could approximate
$500 million US per annum, or potentially $1.06 per share within 36 months.
More importantly, CBD would increase its footprint outside of the Sao Paulo
area of Brazil (where it is the dominant grocer by far) and extend its strong
advertising budget (CBD is Brazil's largest media buyer) to encompass the
Carrefour units.

http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2011/05/23/carrefour-doubling-up-in-brazil/

A merged company would also increase CBD's global profile with institutional
investors, mutual funds and ETF.

A combined CBD and Carrefour Brazil could result in a business with a market
cap of almost $20 billion. Companhia Brasileira de Distribuciao would be more
than the first choice as a retailer within Brazil; it could easily be one of
the top #3 picks globally among grocery retailers.

Carrefour's longstanding history of poor management prevented the firm from
effectively competing against Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao.

Accounting irregularities and massive inventory write-offs were taken at the
Carrefour unit in Brazil in 2010. The write-downs occurred in almost every
quarter during the fiscal 2010 year and have clearly brought Carrefour's French
management to the breaking point. That said; Carrefour had made some rather
significant capex over the last 3 years in Brazil. The store base is sizeable
and relatively modern. At this juncture, and under the assumption that CBD is
serious about adding the division, to purchase Carrefour after a balance sheet
purge makes prudent fiscal sense.

Bears are quick to suggest that should a merger would create monopolistic
concerns with the Brazilian government.

I hear such an argument, but don't concur with the conclusions inferred.
Outside of the top 3 Brazilian chains, the grocery store industry is highly
fragmented. New entrants from Chile are currently consolidating some of the
smallest firms, and German retailers appear keenly interested in developing a
presence in the industry. CBD also has the Wal-Mart fear card that it can use
to trump any monopoly concerns ("we MUST be much larger than Wal-Mart or they
will squash domestic competition").

Many in North America consider the Brazilian government to be left wing and
somewhat meddlesome in domestic affairs. I would counter with a view that
suggests Brazil models their domestic economy after that of China and
Singapore; a form of structured capitalism whereby the nation is allowed to
build domestic monopolies at the expense of foreign competition. The goal is to
have a series of flagship businesses that are the best in class, and that are
capable of competing against any on the planet. If my views are to be believed,
then there should be no issues of a badly run foreign firm selling out to a
very well managed domestic firm.

RMG#1 will be adding more shares of CBD to the account to round out the
portfolio position.

Should the merger not take place, CBD still looks to be growing its business at
the same brisk pace as in the past, and I consider the shares to be a fair
value at current prices. In a merger of equals, I envision a rather significant
acceleration of growth potential. Cost savings could free up sufficient capital
of some consequence; a combined firm could be capable of outspending Wal-Mart
Brazil by more than twofold on an annual basis and still strengthen the balance
sheet.

Madharry,

I took a quick scan through the financials of GFRE. I noticed that the 3/31
10-Q had unaudited f/s and there was an amended FORM 12b-25 on 5/23 stating
that they won't be able to issue 3/31 audited quarterly results. The numbers
look excellent, but I don't know if we can trust them. Are you aware if they
have a listing in China, HK?

The 8-K on 6/8 states:"On June 7, 2011, Gulf Resources, Inc. (the “Company”)
issued a press release announcing that it will convert its production of
wastewater treatment chemical additives to production of pharmaceutical and
agricultural chemical intermediates and the formation of a subsidiary to
explore bromine and crude salt resources in Sichuan Province."

Is this a natural conversion for the industry?

Good luck.

gfre response:

1. i dont understand that at all. who issues quarterly audited financials?

2. if people trusted the financials they would be well over $10.
I am not the least bit happy that that they have not repurchased any shares
despite the announcement of a buy back program months ago and umpteen
suggestions by shareholders that they do so. that to me is the biggest question
mark. right now i am a holder as its undisputed that they raised some $85
million by selling shares in the last couple of years. I believe that had the
company bought back shares the stock would be about double from where it is
today. I will say that I have encountered companies that have cut their
dividend and hoarded their cash despite the shares plummeting to the point
where it was in the shareholders best interest that the company repurchase
shares. so this is not rare just annoying.

there is no listing in china.

3 the conversion of the wastewater treatment to something else is a project
failure. thems the breaks.

4. My guess is that the Sino-Forest debacle will really hurt the market for
chinese stocks for quite awhile in the US.
Its distressing to find that these chinese entities can pull the wool over the
eyes of experienced well heeled fund managers to the tune of hundreds of
millions of dollars not to mention experienced analysts. Sino Forest had a
market cap in the billions and had issued public debt as well.
OTOH I think this will force the chinese government to act to clean this mess
up. In the current environment I would not be willing to recommend any chinese
stock for a new purchase, as it seems clear that you cant rely on any of the
audits to be accurate. Yesterday I read some detailed report on the latest scam
some fruit juice maker, who probably fabricated both production facilities and
sales. There is no way a us investor can pick this stuff up without going to
china and doing the footwork shortsellers are doing. I am restricting new
investments to US and Canada pretty much.

Here is my Gas_Pipeline watch list but I really need to update it w/ new

Any forward PE under 13 becomes a Buy candidate and over 15 is a Sell

Companies I have recently sold (or trimmed) include: SE,UGI,ATO,LG,NI,CNP,SUG

These are not pure pipeline plays but they have some type of pipeline operation
in their company. I am focused on the pipeline operations that deliver product
from the U.S. Shale fields to distribution points around the U.S. & Canada.
More recently, I have been attracted to NG gathering systems (Midstream
operations) in combination with storage & processing infrastructure.

I have been studying the growth in NG wells in the Marcellus Shale area,
specifically in the Virginia Appalachian region.

http://www.pipelineandgasjournal.com/%E2%80%9Ccolonel%E2%80%9D-drake-marcellus-

From the article:"...<u>Transmission</u>
The list of major pipelines projects planned, representing greater than 6 Bcf/d
of new capacity include Tennessee Gas Pipeline’s 300 Line Expansion Project;
Spectra Energy’s Texas Eastern Transmission TEMAX and TIME III Projects;
NiSource’s Marcellus Pipeline, Columbia Penn, Line 1804 Expansion and 1711
Pipeline Corridor; Dominion’s Appalachian Gateway Project; Williams-Dominion
Keystone Connector Pipeline; and National Fuel Gas Supply’s Lamont PA
Expansion, Line N Expansion, West-to-East (W2E) Project and Appalachian Lateral
Pipeline. These are just some of the new pipeline and expansion pipeline
projects in the works. Others are being planned to meet demand from producers
across Marcellus...."

Note: This section of the article discusses several companies w/ projects
and/or operations key to capacity expansion in this region. IMO, this is the
"Honey Hole" where the values will be found.

There are a lot of new projects from both small and large players. I believe
there are better "pure" plays in this group.

I am still making my way through this article and picking out the companies in
their list. I plan to update my Gas_Pipeline watch list once i complete this
review.

FWIW Triad Hunter (the new operating division for MHR -

Hi and welcome. CW looks like a value stock (to me). Three aspects I consider:

1. Affect on CW of the presumed cuts in military spending. CW seems to have
attempted to diversify from pure defense. I didn't check to see to what extent
though.

2. Market is down, and so are defense stocks. As I glance, NOC, LMT, RTN --
prime contractors, they've all fallen similarly to CW it seems to me. Thus,
rather than look at CW in isolation, maybe better to look at all such for the
best bargain or best prospects. At my glance, none (including CW) seems
outstandingly attractive. I tend toward RTN for its missile business.

3. If bought now, and if downturn in stock market or business lasts, then the
issue is what am I expecting from this stock (Just a short-term trade? A return
to highs seen in '08 or '09 or '10? Growth in earnings over next few years?).
In other words how long would I be planning on holding the stock? (RTN, which,
if it doesn't cut it's dividend, yields 3.6% vs. 1% for CW. So I suspect RTN
would be an easier hold for me than CW, although I'm not recommending RTN nor
buying it.)

To summarize, at current price, for me, CW is just not attractive enough for a
buy. Jmo, and I've been wrong many, many times.

----------
Fwiw, my defense-related stock holdings are small: a few shares of LLL, VSEC,
ULBI. I couldn't wholeheartedly recommend any of these for a buy now. Maybe a
very small bet on VSEC if one wanted to bet on success of its recent and
most-significant acquisition.

Yes, should be a big fear among shale OIL e&p shareholders also. (Article was
about shale gas.) We just don't know yet what these shale oil decline rates are
for the oil/liquids produced, or how truthful or careful the oil companies may
be in reporting them. Or accurate, because some of the smaller e&p's that are
just starting drilling are saying they expect decline rates to be similar to
what the big, early-movers in their areas have started to report. But within
shale areas, I assume it's about location, location, location, and some
companies are extrapolating from some other "nearby" company's or companies'
guesses. Imo.

One of the reasons I prefer companies that are in several different shale oil
areas. I hope that mitigates some risk. I also though do have a bunch of small
e&p's that are shale oil specific. Could be dangerous.

"Chou Associates Management Inc., a Toronto based mutual fund headed by Francis
Chou, manages $800 million in assets...Mr. Chou is widely regarded as a
Canadian investment giant. A business acquaintance of Mr. Prem Watsa of Fairfax
Financial, another Canadian investment veteran, both Mr. Chou and Mr. Watsa
immigrated to Canada from India. Mr. Chou famously, with just a 12th grade
education, worked as a telephone repair man and technician for seven years at
Bell Canada and came across Ben Graham’s Security Analysis in the late 1970s.
He started an investment club with seven co-workers and $51,000 in capital and
by 1986, it had grown to $1.7 million when the investment club was converted
into a mutual fund, Chou Associates."
=====================
If this guy can do it, one or more of the new guys here (or those here with
still enough of a lifespan left) ought to be able to get this kind of success
too, it would seem. =g=
Maybe some here are-- 14% compounded rate over 15 or 15+ years. Having a
concentrated position surely helps that, IF those picks are chosen correctly

I don't know much about the topic. The Barnett shale started to get developed
in the early 2000's, so the first wells ought to have a reasonably long
operating history, to estimate the LT flow rates.

The most credible concerns about decline rates are related to Bakken Oil. Some
wells have been real gusher only to decline faster than anticipated - at least
that is what I have heard.
