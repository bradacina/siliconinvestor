When you say bottom, what's your time frame? Nevertheless, you may be right
about the market. I readily admit I don't know how to call it, and I'm
realizing I sleep better if I don't try. I just know that I've sidestepped
several individual bombs (and had opportunity to buy in cheaper - I just bought
one back today) by getting out as old support was violated, and paid for it
just about every time I held on thinking the violation was minor.

Mike, re. <<When you say bottom, what's your time frame? >>

Using sentiment indicators allows you to pick a bottom that will hold for an
intermediate time scale, generally at least a few weeks, and often for several
months or more. The time scale here is determined by the inertia of the
greed/panic emotions of people. Investors change from one to the other on a
time scale of weeks or more.

Sentiment indicators are useful only when they reach extreme values. They are
most precise, in their timing, for indicating a bottom. They are much less
precise for a top.

Comparison of sentiment to price-based indicators, such as support: There's no
real limit (other than zero) to how low a price can plunge, but there is more
or less a limit to how panicky investors can get before they sell. Once they
reach that panic level, anyone who is going to sell has already sold. That's
the bottom. Price charts show you how far the stock has fallen, but not how far
it still can fall. Sentiment indicators show you how far you are away from a
level of maximum panic.

Indices by necessity drag a lot stocks, but IMO most individual stocks not in
arbitrageur-ruled indices don't respond well to much but basic
support/trendline technical rules. Futures and hence indices yes. But not so
much individual stocks.

Waste Management at new low today, Crossman and National RV making new
intermediate-term lows today. All are badly wounded in terms of support. Newly
wounded Ross Stores struggling to keep its nose back above 40. But the indices
and most stocks tied to the indices were up today, as VIX and you predicted.
I'm still glad I made my sales.

Every time a favorite of mine enters the no-man's land below significant
support, I just try to remind myself how General Cigar got to its current
valuation. That way I sell and keep my eyes open for other already-slaughtered
stocks rather than "good prices on good businesses" which as Shane and I

Several days ago I was reading the Wall Street Journal's take on things, and I
didn't particularly like what I heard. There's too much conflict of interest to
suit my taste at the moment (but if it goes much lower I probably will buy at
least a little <g>). I want TSG to be run by Sabre for the benefit of Sabre,
and optimizing value for Sabre shareholders. I don't want AMR to be so heavily
involved in calling the shots. Right now, the profit maximization function
involves both AMR and TSG, and the CEO's resignation and subsequent stock
action gives me the feeling TSG is being held back for the benefit of AMR.
Here's to hoping there's a spinoff.

This is about as ugly a move as I've seen a stock take in a while. TSG is

We are in a bear market. CNBC isn't reporting it yet, and they won't until the
indexes finally crack. I look at the stocks I own and say hey, I'm not stupid.
The leaders of industries - very high quality companies (ABK, CMH, GPC, BRK,
CR) - are in what Mike Burry would call "technical no-mans land". Yet the
indexes are within 5% or so of record highs. What stocks are at record highs?
Can you name one? If you put a gun to my head, I could name two quickly - Intel
and Cisco. After that, given that IBM and HWP collapsed last week, I'd get
shot, because I can't think of another. Can you name 5? 10? I'm sure there are
a few more than that...but isn't that the point?

There is something very very wrong here, unless there is going to be some
announcement on Monday from the guys calculating the index: "Oops. There has
been a little problem with our computers for the last 18 months. Actually the
S&P is at 950, not 1300. Sorry. By the way, we're going to close the market for
two days to correct this glitch. No hard feelings. And, psst...buy the dip."

I'm going to attempt some analysis on this because it absolutely perplexes me
that the stock I look at (and I look at a lot of them, and not just "value
stocks") are steadily drifting down while the indices are in a trading range
near their high. Something just doesn't compute here.

Here are two sectors I follow:

semiconductors

You can pick as many stocks as you like from them that hit 52-week highs in the
last 6 trading sessions.

I might add that stocks in these sectors were tremendous out-of-favor value
plays earlier this year and last fall.

Nevertheless, you are correct that the broader market as a whole is nowhere

Not sure what you mean by "at record high" or its importance.

This week I've taken profits in the following stocks that have: (1) been
mentioned on this thread, and (2) are "close" to yearly or to all time highs:

Michael's Stores (MIKE) closed Friday about 29 in yearly range 15 1/2 to 32
1/2, but sold close to 40 in Jan. '98.

King World Productions (KWP) closed about 40. Yearly range: 21-41 9/16. And
that 41 9/16 is the all-time high and occurred this week.

First Aviation Services (FAVS). Ended Friday at 6 5/8. In a yearly range 3 1/16
to 7 1/16. Stock sold between 7-11 in 1997. (But in 1997 and half of '98 it
wasn't a value stock and wasn't mentioned here until about 5 1/2 I think.)

EG&G (EGG). Ended Friday at 37. In yearly range of 20 1/2 to 38. All-time high
this week @ 38.

And Olsten (OLS). Closed 10 3/8 on Friday: in a yearly range of 4 1/2 to about
11. Sad to say for me though, I started buying somewhere around 17 in 1997,I
think.

Looking through some other stocks that were discussed on this thread, some are
way up and also close to yearly highs (My quote screens just crashed, so I
can't get exact numbers now) Midway (MWY), La Salle (LHO) and Cypress Amax
(CYM). Jim, bear market, shmear market-- you were buying CYM, as were I and
others on the thread, around 11-12. A cyclical business and stock. And it
"cyclicalled". Just like we expected. (Maybe a buyout had something to do with
it, yes). But still, it's close to its yearly high of 18. Not the all-time
high. Right now, I'd say I'm very happy with a 6-7 point gain on a 11-12 dollar
stock in under a year. Right now, I could care less about CYM's all-time high
price. My thinking similar with MWY and LHO.

Lot of stocks are near lows too, of course. Some that were mentioned on this
thread (and some of them by me and that I own. ouch)

I'm saying though, a diversified portfolio of stocks most of which are chosen
at good buy points and allowed to cook for a period of time will have some
stocks rise to highs (maybe not record highs, but high enough) where they may
be removed and sold. Sometimes regardless of whether we're in a general bear
market.

Or so it appears to me.

Well, the S&P 500 hasn't been tearing up the charts this year. Some articles
are even appearing regarding the 75% of managers beating the market. The Nasdaq
has been relentless in its push higher. It took a hit from the internet fallout
and steadied itself and started moving again. I must admit that I'm not sure
what stocks are doing it there. I do see Cisco, Intel, and Microsoft all
recently pushed to new highs. Beyond that, I'm not that familiar with the big
names in the Nasdaq. The Dow got its cyclical boost and has been helped big by
its few technology names. Take a look at the R2000 - up only 2.96% this year,
down from 8.46% as of June 30th. As well, the S&P 500 is now up 8.62% vs up
11.67% as of June 30th.

So what's going on here?? In the S&P, if it isn't tech, it ain't up, and in
fact there is some big underperformance going on in the non-tech names to
counteract the sizable tech weighting in the index. And if it's small cap,
well, if it isn't tech it has been simply creamed. I suspect that this is where
the frustration of the value investor lay. Compare to the 2Q, when most value
investors cheered and the R2000 was up over 15%. That 2Q was also when the Dow
got its cyclical push and moved up 12.11%.

Every once in a while I pick up on something and start to feel bearish. It can
get overwhelming. I see a lot of stocks not acting right, as you said. But the
money has to go somewhere. Liquidity continues to drive the market. Hence the
increasing narrowness of the advance. And when the nets faltered, first
cyclicals and then traditional tech stepped up to the plate to carry on. I see
the potential for a continued rotational bull, with the indices representing
less and less of the actual market performance.

Perfect example: You want football? (I do :-) There is no better website than
going to the source, www.nfl.com. As bandwidth gets wider, NFL.com can offer
more video clips etc. than they do now. They currently offer a live gamebook
which is a text page being updated with play-by-play in real time. Wider
bandwidth means they could offer some clips of the last big play, etc. Quokka

REITs are so out of favor now that there is no reason I can think of to stretch

the tried and true - an EastGroup, a Colonial Properties, even though the
stocks have held up OK. The dividend is what makes these worth your while - If
you start looking for homeruns in real estate land, you are asking for trouble.
If you want to take on more risk, go to the hotel sector, and look at LHO or
HMT. Just recognize that their dividends are not nearly as secure as those of
more conservative property types.

MOO,

Re: ANLY, I actually bought back in today at 10 1/8 after selling when it
started to crumble last week. The price to me discounted this news when it fell
from 30 to 14. The extra push down to the current level is just disgust. But we
all knew this was happening - just as we all know things will improve when Y2K
passes. We still have decent insider buying at prices above this. It may be
dead money, but sometimes the wait (e.g. Midway) can be worth it. It also may
go back to its old lows, at which point I'd buy a little more.

This was predicted by the price action last week. I also bought Crossman again
after it dived 4 points from my sell price just a few days ago. Ross (another
buy and sell for me) continues its fall, as does Mesaba, Washington Mutual.
I've got targets to buy Ross in the low 30s, and Washington Mutual in the high
20's. There's credence to support levels and their relevance.

Did anyone else notice MO's general counsel selling a large portion of his

I actually thought we would see the lions share of the slowdown in Q4 of C/Y
1999...when companies have a lockdown on any new implementations. That the
first two C/Y quarters of year 2000 will be slow as well (OK maybe Q1 year
2000) is something of a surprise to me.

The yield on this stock remains incredible, perhaps unique in any category
within the tech sector. If they don't screw with the dividend I think we will
be OK. I think we will see single digits thanks to tax loss selling whereupon I
will probably add as well. No hurry for now. BTW, I see similar tech services

I think maybe the overreaction today may well be due to people seeing your read
of things. They pre-announced for
fiscal 2000 first half (which is 3rd and 4th quarters of Calendar Year 1999),
and say they see strong numbers resuming in the second half of FY 2000 (which
is 1st and 2nd quarters of CY 2000). No surprises here for me - and evidently
not for you if you read it again.

IMO, I just see a sector that is crushed and nobody wants to own, not unlike
commodities and oil stocks at the beginning of the year. ANLY just took the
mystery out of the numbers - most people knew they would miss, but didn't know
by how much. Now it is clear it ain't all bad, and BTW they can still cover
their dividend.

It may already be recovering as people read the release more carefully ;)

Re: ROE/PE and other stuff

ROE/PE: I've often thought of it, and always note it in my "Buffett" picks. To
me, it is kinda of an "organic" PEG ratio. But I believe it is too simplistic,
and as long as it is used to apply to stocks without proven ability to sustain
that ROE, it is just as misleading as a PEG. In cyclicals, of course, it can be
downright deadly. And in leveraged firms, useless. I just prefer to look at
cash return on capital instead.

On that note, I've noted cyclicals at their peak in earnings but down in price
because everyone's predicting doom can be very sexy. I mean, four or five times
earnings and three or four times cash flow for a stock that grew earnings
20-30% the last 4 years and has a 15-25% ROE and 10-12% ROA. Seems that if it
can just hold on and not cycle down for another year or two, you've got a
double. And if sentiment changes just a whiff, you've got a three-bagger or
more. I've yet to be successful buying into this particular sex appeal, though.

The homebuilders and banks look good at these prices until you see where they
were in 1990-91 - and we're only looking at the ones that survived.

And every cyclical stock that we've thought would never hit October 98 lows
again - they're either on their way, or already there.

Another deal: when every cyclical in an industry heads to new lows except one
or two which seem to hold up better, is it ever prudent to buy that leader or
those leaders? I've just noticed that eventually they topple and head to new
lows too, and hence there's often a better price waiting .

N, This time there's a lot going against VIX. All kinds of broken support
and/or trendlines both in stocks and indices. The S&P held above 1296 yesterday
on tech strength alone. Too narrow to really provide support.

All: Microsoft has an interest in deflating the market, remember.
Their employee stock and option programs have been hurting them the last few
years, and the reason is the inflated price. People don't go to work for MSFT
for the salary - they do it for the stock and option plans. So Microsoft
long-term must be a big buyer, and as any Buffett fan knows that means they are
rooting for it to go down - any break, however temporary, helps.

Why this spilled over into the financials (which were having a good day) and
others - well, you just need to look at the technicals dragging down the S&P
500 futures, mandating selling in the underlying securities. The S&P now needs
to go to the low 1200's.

Jim, what's this about your colleague Miller wanting to buy Amazon.com? He says
Bank One is worth twice what it is now. And says Waste Management should be in
the low 30's. Well, isn't that where he bought it in the first place? What kind
of guy is he? Also says Washington Mutual should be 30-40% higher, which puts
it back where it was when he first started buying loads of it.

Wow, yesterday I bought YUM at 38 5/16. When the news came of the halt, I
thought, "geez, my timing of late just went from poor to ludicrous." Turns out
to be lucky, saving my portfolio today.

Homebuilders hurting again today. Hard to find refuge in any sector today.

In case anyone was wondering, the Russell 2000 just turned negative for the
year, and with tax-loss selling looming, has virtually sealed its fate. Good
luck next year, Russell

In their SEC Filing 10Q, they noted "moderating demand for unsecured consumer
debt products."

That was the warning . Growth is dependent on the bond community receiving
these things well. This can get ugly, since finance companies often support
their securitizations by backing them, making them "semi-secured."

We're looking at $70 billion + in credit card debt that is an asset on Bank
One's balance sheet. They'll earn 2+ Billion this year. The question is how
much will have to be written off from here (given that once the bubble is
pricked all manner of consumer leverage will become a sledgehammer on their
heads), and how they will ever grow from here?

I think Bill Miller might be early here, too. It just made a new low today.

this the beginning of a period where there are no individual buyers and and the

I expect tomorrow CNBC will be full of the guys who say dollar average in,

With respect to "INTRINSIC value of the business", beauty is in the eye of the
beholder. I would like to see someone try to provide a precise definition that
everyone will accept and such that it could be used in stock selection and
tested empirically. Even with the stocks we discuss which are clearly selling
for prices closer to intrinsic value (as we would define it) we rarely agree on
what is a good buy.

Furthermore, the guy at MSFT is hardly any old "someone" with respect to a
public comment that his own company's stock is grossly overpriced. It will
certainly change SOME perceptions of what the intrinsic value of MSFT is, and
in my opinion it should.

If you fancy a dividend what is wrong with USU?
RE: the credit card exposure. Some of this is smoke and mirrors. If you recall
when credit cards first came into being the term of repayment was 36 months. In
the interim the term has increased to 60 months in some cases, and if you go
over your credit line you just get an increase.
Of course people who owe credit card debt that they do not pay off have
probably already maxed out on their home equity loans or do not own homes. Then
of course we don't know how much credit card debt is financing speculation on
margin into internuts. Sounds to me like ONE's equity is not as secure as one

What institutional investors were talking about after the close today wasn't so
much the Microsoft comment, but rather that the Dow went through a significant
support level like a hot knife through butter. And the S+P went through a minor
support level. This is what may spook institutions from buying at the open
tomorrow. If the market opens down tomorrow, or turns down in the first hour,
we bears are going to have some fun for a change.

I'm picking my levels for stocks like Clayton Homes, which is already at an
absurd level but probably has not bottomed yet. We need some huge volume to
finish this one off. I'll buy into that and make my stand. I'm also starting to
pick my dream prices for things like Gillette and Wrigley. They're still 20-30%

Re: ONE

I'm just wary of stocks that every investor is calling a value stock. The spin
doesn't match the price action.
The last thing I would buy ONE for is its dividend. By my reading the
securitized market just turned off ONE's credit card growth spicket.
Equity/Capital at 10%, but is probably misleading. We're talking equity of 12
billion, and credit card debt (as an asset) over $70 billion, most of which has
already been securitized with implicit back-up from ONE. ONE can possibly be on
the hook for more than its legal requirement if the loans go bad. What we do
know is ONE's equity ain't secured. That dividend may have very, very low
priority at some point in the near future.

Then of course we don't know how much credit card debt is financing speculation
on margin into internuts. 

This is the wild card that just makes my head spin. A few years ago, before net
mania, there was 4000 in credit card debt for every human being in the US. I
doubt many of them paid that off before they went and invested in the stock
market. This bubble was created from liquidity, and it isn't all coming from
retirement money.

Too big to fail maybe, and maybe we should look at what Citibank got to in the
early 90s as a guidepost for a safe buy point.

As a value investor and an avid fan of graham, I see precious little I would

I crack up when investors get excited by a modest decline in the market and
begin to target stocks to buy when the general market is arguably overvalued by
>200%. (pe, pb, dividend, take your pick) If this truly is the beginning of a
bear market (i have my doubts as the FED has made it clear with the wide open
credit spigots) then you ought to target stocks to short. That being said, one
of the first areas I am considering is the newly minted internet "spyders"

With global overcapacity in virtually all markets and our corporations
attempting to leverage themselves to the mooon issuing bonds for stock
buybacks, pricing/margins are going to continue to worsen. Yes we may play all

to work (keeping their employees overpaid and happy), they need to have a stock
that is more or less constantly rising. Even though a MSFT dip/crash would help
lower the cost of Microsoft's stock buyback, that is just the tail of the
problem: the body is that they *NEED* their stock to appreciate, in order to
successfully transfer wealth to their options grantees.

The net is that they have to buy in stock to prevent dilution thanks to their

Hi Robert. I took a position in UDR last year after discussing briefly with
Richard Barron on his REITS thread. I have seen both positive and negative
media writeups on the stock since. I hold it still - along with about five
other REITs. Paul Senior.

Losing interest in the market? Or losing interest in new stocks to buy? Or
losing interest in SI after the facelift? Dunno.

Manu. Housing: Positive Barron's article may yeild a bounce, but I suspect tax
loss selling produces lower lows ahead. One fundamental issue is degree of
vertical integration - ownership of dealers: IMO a no-profit zone of the first
magnitude with net disintermediation looming...lower cost, 'bricks & clicks'
ways of reaching consumer.

Clearly "everyone" is not planning on a major hit this fall or the indices
would be down a hell of a lot more than they are.

As for how value investors are doing in this drop - this one is getting
creamed. Internet shorts have not been quite the market hedge I thought they
would be. They were up last week!

Jim,

I thought of you this week as I looked at the stocks on my some-25 watch lists,
and noted that of the hundreds of stocks, the net stocks are doing quite well.
I had thought you covered. Ouch.

For the last week I've been carrying "The Art of Short Selling" around with me
just about everywhere. Every time I get a break, I just open to a chapter.
Doesn't matter if I've already read it. I just read it again.

If there's one thing that keeps hitting me in the head about that book and its
cases is that there's a lot of time to short and still come out ahead. The
problem with net stocks is that they appear as if they require constant capital
infusions, which makes them good shorts. But they're getting these infusions at
will. That makes now now a good time. When the capital spicket is turned off,
the stocks will react downward, but won't fully account for how bad the news is
then. They'll be terminally wounded but the price won't reflect it. That's when
IMO you'll be able to grab a lot of the net stocks on their way to zero. But
before that, a lot of smaller companies will pitch themselves to larger
companies. So the wild card is that they get taken over by a bigger, stupider,
more capital-rich, company, a la Yahoo of GeoCities, which stands out as the
single most characteristic action of this era. The AofSS describes this risk as
the thing that keeps ss's sweaty-palmed and awake at night. I think for good
reason.

For my next, more certain short, I'm taking a long, measured look at Pre-Paid
Legal (PPL). I posted why over on that thread. I think I finally understand
that one.

Obviously, 'everyone' is an exageration and maybe it's just
where I hang out on SI but I hit a lot of different threads -
not just value and bearish-themed ones. I read a lot of
internet stock related threads also. And a lot of people
talk about raising cash, buying puts, selling calls, etc.
So I agree with you that it should have happened already
but it hasn't. My best guess on what will happen now is
that October will surprise people by being a non-event.
Then the indices get a mild bounce before the market
screws everyone by collapsing toward the end of the year
when everyone feels safe and ready for the Christmas rally.

Or maybe we're staring at Black Monday in 2 days.

Either wayI'm around 2/3 in cash, 1/6 in S&P500 (only fund
in fed retirement program), and the rest in PZN (huge div),
PROG (just bought), DH (for my wife), QCOM and MU puts, and
a few internet IPO stocks that I flip as quick as I can.

A very good point on timing of internet shorts. I haven't been hurt too
bad...yet. Amazon has hit me hard again, but the other two have behaved
themselves. But so far it has clearly been an error thinking these would hedge
my portfolio if the market hit trouble - they have done just the opposite.

I find it interesting that you are honing in on a short of a stock you
recommended just six months or so ago. Did something in the business change or
did a light bulb go off that didn't before? To be honest, I wish I shorted most
of the stocks I was recommending six months ago!

Nice articles in Barrons on one I had been waiting for a price on - Wrigley (it
still wasn't close) and one I almost added to on Friday but didn't - Clayton.
The case for Clayton was laid out pretty clearly there, except for the
valuation work, which gets me well above $15 a share. Well above, actually.
There are probably at least two shaky quarters between here and there though.

Probably not much consolation to you but Someone else noted that the die hard
gamblers are the last to leave the burning casino- so I expect the the
internuts and IPOs to be the last to cave.

After picking up Barrons and seeing articles about Wrigley's and mfg. housing
back to back I concluded that some lurker from Barron's editorial staff must be
one of your avid readers.

James Clarke! This: "To be honest, I wish I shorted most of the stocks I was
recommending six months ago!" is definitely not the thing to be posting for me
to see on an up-late-with-not much-to-do, hot-chocolate Saturday night!
Because... let's just see exactly what you WERE recommending -gg-:

Six months ago between March 15 and April 16, you were recommending on this
thread(to buy)the following stocks at the then price (rough price
interpretation from Yahoo chart by me based on your posting date)vs. today's
(rough) price:

MO, then 33, now 34
ANGLY, then 35 now 53 (Yahoo sym.= AAUK)
CMH, 11, now 9
ABK, 54, now 49
USEC, 13, now 10

Assuming I bought equal $ amounts into each of your picks, say about $3300, I'd
have invested about $16,500. That investment would be worth today about
$16,600. The money would've been made on the long side. You might not have
wanted (in hindsight)to buy the stocks at the buy points they were posted at,
and you might not have wished to have recommended those particular stocks. Of
course, 3 of 5 (or most) stocks dropped, but to have wished to have shorted
most of the stocks, you'd also want to have wished that if you did short most,
they were those exact three (avoid shorting Anglo).

I claim short-selling thinking contributes to the turmoil investors face when
times are tough. If a person thinks he/she always has or had the choice to
sell-short, then in hindsight, that option frequently looks attractive. A stock
goes down, just too easy to say "I should have shorted, not bought. Next time
I'll think more about shorting." And I claim such thinking detracts from
overall investment performance. Especially for value investors: finding, buying
and holding undervalued stocks. That's my opinion anyway.

Paul.

Interesting analysis. I draw a different conclusion, namely that the one stock
that soared had a catalyst that we were all aware of at the time of the
recommendation. So perhaps by adding a criterion of a defined catalyst to value
selections we can improve performance. Comments?

Jim, can you comment on Abby Cohen's comments about market being undervalued.
Trailing P/E of S&P500 is in upper 20's (much higher than p/e level of low 20's
before 87 crash) compared to historical levels in the teens. Even forward p/e
is well into the 20's. Why does Abby think its undervalued?

thanks,

My view on Abby is that she is a one trick pony. As long as the market goes up
she is a genius. If she calls the top, I will have some respect for her. For
now, I just see her revise her estimate of the market's value up 10% every time
the market goes up 10%. Just my very humble opinion - she's making a lot more $
than I. The problem she has is that she can't call the top, because there is
the risk that that might crash the market 500 points. I have no idea what she
is thinking privately, but she's not stupid - she's got to be a little bit
uncomfortable. I have met many of these market strategists (though never Abby
Joseph Cohen) and my perception is that they are marketing tools just like 9
out of 10 sell side analysts. What passes for analysis on Wall Street today is
an absolute disgrace.

From Lehman Brothers dated 9/24:

---------------------------------------------------

We are lowering our FY00 EPS to $1.28 from $1.56 and our FY01 EPS to $1.49 from
$1.88.

WE VALUE RITE AID'S STOCK AT $18 TO $38 PER SHARE. To value the core drug
retailing
business, we used two methodologies based on historical M&A multiples. On an
EBITDA basis, we used a
conservative multiple of 10.55x, which is the average M&A multiple over the
past five years excluding CVS'
highly-priced acquisition of Arbor. We value PCS at the price Rite Aid paid in
January 1999, which was
$1.5 billion and add the market value of Rite Aid's 22% stake in drugstore.com,
which was worth $456
million as of September 23. If we include the Arbor acquisition, the average
multiple of EBITDA is 12.38x.
Leaving our estimate for PCS and the stake in drugstore.com the same, we derive
the value of $38.80.
Since there is considerable uncertainty about earnings, and less about sales,
we've done a similar calculation
using historical M&A multiples of sales. Excluding the Arbor transaction, the
average multiple is 0.6x, and
leaving the other assumptions the same, we derive a value of $18.30. In cluding
the Arbor acquisition, the
average multiple of sales is 0.77x and that produces a value of $26.80. We
believe the higher valuations are
more appropriate given Rite Aid's broad geographic breadth, close relationship
with managed care, and the
value of
the Rite Aid brand name.

The Florida attorney general has filed a suit against Rite Aid accusing the
company of overcharging 29,000
prescription drug customers between 1989 to 1996. At present, we believe the
company has good defenses
against the suit, although the matter is unlikely to be resolved for several
years.
Based on historical M&A multiples within the industry, we calculate a value for
Rite Aid between $18-38.

At the current price, we think this stock is undervalued and reiterate our
1-Buy rating.

State to probe Rite Aid, too, Lockyer says: Prescription pricing questioned By
Cathleen Ferraro Bee Staff Writer (Published Sept. 25, 1999) California
Attorney General Bill Lockyer is opening an investigation into Rite AidCorp.'s
pricing policies on prescription drugs, his office confirmed Friday. The
inquiry comes after other states announced similar probes Thursday. Florida
sued the nation's third-largest drugstore chain, saying Rite Aid overcharged
customers who lacked prescription drug insurance. On Thursday, New York
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said his office also was launching a statewide
probe against Rite Aid for alleged racketeering. Adding to Rite Aid's problems,
on Thursday bond-rating agencies Moody's Investor Services and Standard & Poor
Corp. said they would review the company's credit. Rite Aid officials did not
return phone calls on Friday regarding the new probe in California...."
