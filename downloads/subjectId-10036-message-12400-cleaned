It was luck. I sold the WBB because everyone said that the sky was falling and
I expected housing starts to fall off. I think that people are recognizing that
the economy will not be much worse, and maybe we are on the uptick. So I bought

clearly it is not subtracted. perhaps the wording on "other income" is a
misleading title. I dunno, but I would rely that they did their arithmetic
correctly.

The more important message is that (unless further revised downward), they will
make decent EPS in the year and have a PE of around 10.

`Based on the impact of a slower economy, particularly in North America, we
believe it will be difficult for our annual revenues to exceed last year's
level. We now estimate that full-year 2001 earnings will be in a range of $2.15
to $2.30 per share versus $2.14 per share in 2000."

Bob Rudd, Dale Baker: Nice move in AREM since your posts here.

I've started a small position this afternoon based on the positive outlook that
is expected to continue for AREM and their apparently successful business
model.

I really don't like stepping up to these things, but since April earnings were
positive, they've got new contract wins, there are some interesting
institutional holders whom I now notice, and the stock's come 'round in the
positive market.

Oh the stock market - only place in the world wherein after something doubles
(or in this case goes up 50%), people THEN buy it because THEN they believe
they're getting a bargain. And it looks like I'm one of those very people.
Arghh.

If either of you guys still consider AREM a 'value' stock (I'm not sure that I
do, but it surely looks pretty "GARP"y to me), and if there are no thread
objections, and if you guys say you still have AREM positions, then I'll add
AREM to this thread's list of stocks at today's higher price of $15.24 (my
price). That'd make the criteria of three thread posters who've posted here
that they've bought the stock.

fwiw, I took profits in EK. Because the company has reduced its growth outlook,
I've therefore reduced my position also.
---------------------
On the assumptions that the last couple of days were just routine profit-taking
times for the oil/gas sector (most stocks I follow have dropped), and that the
trend for rising prices continues, and that there might still be further focus
and interest on the sector/industries if there are summer shortages, I
increased my exposure a bit as follows today:

Added to FRONY (averaging down on this one)

Started a position in GI. Giant Industries is the only refiner I can find that
hasn't really moved compared to every other one I looked at. GI is small,
regional, and has a money-losing retail business (that they are trying to
divest). Book value for this stock is $14.27, and I am betting that at peak
earnings or peak interest in the stock, GI will once again sell near book value
or higher. The stock's at $9.20, down a bit from yesterday. But I still had to
step up from the 7-8 range of the past couple of months. Grrr.

Paul: I still have AREM with avg cost 14.90, but it's grown to a large position
for me [Though still less than 5%]. The case for AREM as value stock rests
somewhat on WEB's assertion that growth is NOT separate from value, but a key
determinant of it. I see very good potential for 35 - 45% growth for 5+ years.
With a PE on '01 of 12 [based on 15.24 & 1.27 EPS] This kicks out a PEG of .3
vs Ent. software universe with PEG 1.2. And while the valuation of the group
may have been high a year ago, the Nasdaq drop has brought it to earth - a PEG
of 1.2 isn't stratospheric.
One problem with buying 'value' techs is whether growth will continue. Two key
aspects of this are inventory [software companies have none, while hardware
guys are writing it down like crazy] and customer base. Some tech sectors like
telecom and internet that were part of the over investment bubble will take
quite awhile to absorb that. OTOH, AREM's customers are ordinary businesses
that weren't subject to the bubble.
Another risk factor is integrating acquisitions - their track record has been
excellent on this front, so I'm not that concerned. The deal structure on their
recent Globalsoft acquisition was fantastic for AREM.
This isn't a simple, run the numbers, buy the stock situation, IMO. If you're
going to build a significant position, it's important to read the K, check out
the presentations on their web site and the conference calls. Get a feel for
the open-ended potential of their strategy.
Bottom line: I still consider it a value stock, with growth an important
component of that value, and would be buying it today if I didn't already have
a full position.

Paul, I just read the NYT article about CA. I don't know how you can feel bad
about a winning trade. No sooner did I post that message than CA's stock
started to run. Frankly, I envied your move.

Actually, what turned me off about CA was its purchase of the hated
Islanders<g>. I don't follow hockey any more (too many teams), but I always
backed the Rangers.

I've always admired Charles Wang. Of course, I've kinda admired Bob Brennan,
too. The first time I ever laid eyes on Wang was in the 70s. At the time, CA's
HQ was the trunk of Russ Artzt's car. Artzt and Wang were visiting the company
I was working for, trying to get the rights to market a piece of software
written (by us) in-house. CA hasn't developed anything itself since, except,
possibly that piece-oh-sh*t, Unicenter. But Wang has gone from operating out of
the back of a 70s Chevy to becoming a billionaire. His brother, Anthony, a
lawyer, was a large cheese at CA for a while, but he left just before I did so
he could play with his Ferraris (that was his car in Ferris Buehler's Day Off).

I worked on one of their mainframe security packages. After six months on the
job, I was the senior guy on the product! Everybody quit. The company just
didn't seem to care a whit about employees or customers. I'm grateful to CA,
though. When I resigned after only 18 months on the job, I did so effective
immediately and I haven't held a real job since (1991). Of course, the bull
market had something to do with that.

Work is so-o-o-o overrated.

It's kind of amazing, though, the way this asbestos thing moved back to center

Armstrong was nowhere on the radar screen.
Also in the legal risk area, is the resurgence of tobacco companies. I've seen

ancient history. Now it looks like one leads to the other. Talk about long
tailed liability. And these companies weren't doing anything wrong or nefarious

I started a position in ALLC on 4/24 and added to it yesterday with average
cost of 22. The recent CC reassured that true telecom exposure was negligable
[3% or so, I think]. I've seen several comments that management really knows
their stuff, and I came away from CC with that impression. They're into some
risky stuff, but they seem to know what level of seniority [of debt] offers
favorable risk reward and they're well diversified. One thing I really like
that differentiates them from most financial entities is that they have
relatively little leverage. Many finance/bank entities are teatering on 10 - 1
debt ratio which leaves nearly no room for error. These guys are very
conservative with 1/1 debt/equity. The $2 dividend [9% @ 22] should grow 10%
over time with earnings growing a bit faster than that. I read an Alex Brown
report that knocked them down, and didn't see anything to worry about [They
might not grow quite as fast as we'd expected - that sort of drivel]. Merrill

Warren Buffett said last week that he'd looked at a lot of companies that were

I almost got sucked into USG at 14 after I saw Buffett buying it. (he would not
comment on what he is doing or has done with that holding) My better angels
prevailed, as I have learned that when I put a small amount of money into a
high risk stock because "that's what I can afford to lose" I usually do just
that.

Asbestos, lead paint I have come to just say no. There are too many other cheap

Bob, ALLC should work out okay long term. I meant to add to my position also
but did not get a fill because I goofed and entered 19.90 instead of the 21.90
that I wanted. When I realized my error I used the funds instead to add to my
REITs by taking a new position in CLI. (I don't suggest that CLI or any other
REIT would be a substitute for ALLC though.) I like CLI's high and growing
dividend, large size (suitable for institutions and funds), and broad in-house
capabilities. Also, my other REITS predominate in the California market and to
a lesser extent, the SW USA. CLI, primarily in the NE, gives me a little more
geographical diversity, especially adjacent to the NYC market (I wonder though
if New Yorkers might be right if they were to tell me that there's NYC and then
there's everything else - adjacent means not being a contender -g-.)

--------

I gave up on my exploratory position in ITW and used proceeds to buy CLI. I
went in ITW 8/00 @ 58+ and out today about 5 points higher. I like
conglomerates, and ITW is one of the best, so they say. Very good, very
well-managed company (from what I read). However, the stock has danced between
50 and 65 (roughly) for almost two years now, and with the company expecting
earnings $3.00-3.20 this year (down from recent prior years), I expect that
trading range to stay intact. (Well, actually it would except that since I
sold, I of course now have the dread feeling that a breakout is imminent -g-).
Anyway, I will bet that if I'm still interested in ITW, I can pick some up
later at lower prices than current.

"It doesn't look like things are going to get better anytime soon," says Brian
Overstreet, president and cofounder of DirectPlacement.com. "We've already seen
a pretty active PIPE market this year, but it is going to pick up even more
into the second quarter."

Death-spiral deals allow a company's PIPE investors to reprice the conversion
rate in the face of a declining stock price and thereby acquire more shares.
Although these deals already have received a large amount of negative publicity
because of the impact on existing investors, Mr. Overstreet expects their
volume to increase in 2001 as private investors look for downside protection
against companies that are struggling to turn around their operations.

....

This was the case for Log On America (Nasdaq : LOAX), a regional Internet
provider and competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC), after completing a $15
million convertible preferred stock PIPE offering last February. Rather than
marking the turning point for Log On America, the stock subsequently fell 89
percent from the negotiated investment price of $16.31 to close Monday at
$1.66.

With the stock well below the conversion price of $24.615, Marshall Capital
Management, HFTP Investments, Fisher Capital, and Wingate Capital were able to
adjust the number of shares eligible for conversion. The initial stock price
decline could be attributed to any number of company-specific problems, but Log
On America management alleges the drop was due to market manipulation on the
part of the investors in the deal. As such, the company filed suit last month
against Credit Suisse First Boston, the parent of Marshall Capital Management,
to seek recovery of $100 million in damages associated with the PIPE.

George, re. toxic convertibles, there are a lot of tech companies who need them
now, to stay afloat.

That situation is the result of an earlier wave of companies that had no
prospect of profitability but went public through IPOs or reverse mergers
anyway.

In contrast, during the ~9 mo. period leading up to early 2000 when we quit
searching for toxic converts, there were very few of them. Presumably small

LENS is nearly a net-net, and might be worth a look.

It's a maker of disposable cameras and other imaging products. Net current
assets (=current assets minus all liabilities) is $5.00 per share, and the
stock trades at about $7. It has a larger market cap, $190 million, than most
stocks that trade this close to net-net.

Stocks trading this close to net current assets always have a big fat wart
somewhere, and for LENS it is a loss in the most recent quarter, as compared to
a consistent string of profitable quarters previously. The company blames this
on "economic conditions," meaning cyclicality I suppose.

It has a ton of cash from a secondary offering last fall, when the stock traded
for much more. The sole analyst estimates earnings of $0.51 for the current
year, which gives a p/e of about 14. If you figure that the $96 million that
they raised in that secondary is "excess cash", and subtract it from the market
cap to get a value on the underlying company, it looks like a p/e of about 7.

Well, phooey. I will just go ahead and mention now NPK, one of my favorite
sucker value stocks. A stock with just sooo much cash behind it that amateur
value stock buyers always seem to be buying into the cash, getting the
dividend, and getting the houseware company for free. And to me, never seeming
to make any real money on the deal. That's my impression anyway. However, with
NPK at 26.75-27, and assuming the good dividend is maintained, and that there's
not too much bad news forthcoming, and that there's a continuing supply of
value investors who will buy this thing at even higher prices, then MAYBE NPK
is now, at this price, a buy for a 20% gain + dividend capture within 12
months.

Any comments or suggestions or interest now with the stock vs. its price? I'll
try to improve my negative attitude if anyone here will consider/or is
considering buying this thing.

Doug: Thanks for the link to the Whitman inteview; it has some good insights
related to recent current asset discussions on this thread. I had inferred that
Marty bailed on USG stock from several of his comments, but the interview shows
him to be a reluctant owner:
<<Still, you bought the stock and then changed your mind. Why?
When I bought the stock it was just a flawed analysis. I figured after all
these years people probably have their hands around asbestos liability. But I
don’t think now that anybody can get their hands around what ultimate asbestos
liability will be. USG is an extremely strong company. The asbestos taint is
against only one subsidiary, US Gypsum, and there are two other subsidiaries
that have substantial earnings. The stock is a big bargain. But once we can’t
know the liabilities, my feeling is it isn't safe. If I have no conception of
what the liabilities might be, how can I call the stock safe? We still own a
million and a half shares, though.>>His comments imply that only one division
is subject to the asbestos exposure, but I've read nothing to indicate there's
an inpenetrable corporate shield preventing that divisions problems from taking
the whole thing into BK.
On the date of the interview, USG was at 19.05, so it's now a 'bigger bargain'
but I would still consider the debt a better bet...and Marty's fund a much
better bet.

Other than valuation aspect, I'm piggybacking on Dale's recommendation as I

I like seeing some sort of a margin for error in every investment I make. On

"LPAC management turned down a $4 per share offer in 2000". They should.
Without looking at comparable takeouts, I'd guess this should go for not less
than 6 to 8 EV/EBITDA, it's at 3.2 EV/EBITDA now, 4 would be 4.35 EV/EBITDA or
a 23% enterprise yield. So my price targets based on conservative takeout would
be 6 to 8. A year from now, if HDTV is kicking in and they're showing solid 10
to 15% EPS growth on fairly easy comps, the price of poker will be higher, IMO.
That said, there may be another strike speedbump ahead - the Screenactors Guild
- SAG. Talks are starting soon: http://www.sag.org/inthenews/news_010508dv.html
At this point, this is a very minor position for me and I may add some to it if
there's big dip. But given that I don't have such a good feel for the industry,
I'm not going to make it a major one.

Doug, Thanks for posting notes on Mungers comments. He's nailed it. As an

assessment must be given extra weight.
From the notes, "I regard what's happening to USG as a dishonorable mugging of
an honorable place. I don't think they should be driven out of business, but I
don't want to make predictions about this."
I really doubt they'll be driven out of business, as the demand for drywall
will continue and nobody makes flat stuff that goes on walls like USG. It's the
shareholders that may be wiped out, with the bondholders and litigants fighting
over ownership of the company.

Jeffrey, I think asbestos litigation had subsided until victories in the
tobacco battle - blood in the water - drew attention to other potential
windfalls, such as asbestos. Tactics learned in the tobacco wars were then
applied to asbestos. This and other factors have lead to a resurgance of
litigation and claims in recent years. It's probably this resurgance that
Munger is referring to. When I traded USG in 99, asbestos was considered
ancient history - no big deal, for example. Now it'll probably push it back
into bankruptcy.

Starting a small exploratory position in CJR.

I've taken small profits today in another "diversified broadcasting company",
SBGI, purchased 5/25/00, by selling half my remaining position as SBGI moves up
from recent lower prices. Issues with SBGI are that they are family controlled,
and their business is difficult to understand. I have the same issue in
comprehension with CJR, but at its current relatively low price, I'm willing to
make a small bet that CJR will do as well or better than SBGI.

I also added to my position in KT today. A firm which was organized to take a
significant minority position in KT common at 8, is now and once again
reevaluating its terms of cash and/or convertible stock, and so KT stock has
dropped (again). KT is having another lousy year, they are selling off part or
parts of their business (at a loss), and they eliminated their dividend.
Tangible book value is about $7.7/sh, and insiders have bought $1M worth of
stock over the past couple of years (none this year though) in 9-12 range.
Given that KT's a conglomerate (fairly easy businesses to separate and divest),
that there's interest still in parts or all of its businesses, that the company
has been profitable in several recent years, that the stock's near a ten-year
low, I'll bet that KT might recover to 8-10 range if the economy improves or a
decent offer for the company materializes.

What I like about CJR: first: the stock is not analyzable by mere mortals -
it's Canadian, data is sparse, trading history is not even one year long,
comparable metrics (to other media companies) are esoteric (imo. for example
the people who like to analyze broadcast companies using total debt to
"adjusted" EBITDA) -- and I have to totally defer with these things to those
knowledgeable, like Twister, et. al. In short, this is a stock that certainly
screams 'don't mess with what you don't know'. And I admit I'm one who doesn't
know --- but it won't stop me. -g-

If we look at institutional holders we see a cross section of holders whom we
might assume to be smart value investors: Gabelli Funds, Neuberger Berman,
Liberty Acorn. They are either selling out as I buy in, or if they're holding,
I'm getting a better price than they got.

I will hope the risk of total business screw-up is small with CJR. The radio
stations and tv programming ventures ought to provide decent cash flow. It
seems like everybody (I include CJR) ought to now be aware of the dangers of
internet ventures becoming financial sinkholes. I hope CJR are able to control
and cap the funds they are investing in their many ventures.
The stock's at its lows. It could go lower. But given enough time - say a year
or 18 months, it's also possible the stock could receive more investor
attention and could rise also. I bet on the rise.

Cruise ship stocks:

I'm still tracking CCL and RCL. I've started a position today in AMCV. I say
this one's a real cigar butt.

Negative earnings now and in most of the past few years.
And not doing better now. With gas prices high, they will suffer still more.
Outdated ships mostly; they are generally small, so economies of scale don't
seem to work for them.
They're American registered vessels. The more expense that that entails is
offset by one great feature - they have a lock on USA's coastal market
(including between Hawaiian Islands.

I haven't a clue how or if AMCV will ever make money. I'm disappointed in how
Samuel Zell has not managed his investment here. While he gets media credit for
doing great in his real estate stuff (Equity Office Properties, others), and
he's supposed to be a great value investor or vulture specialist (he's the one
who's referred to as "The Grave Dancer" in media accounts), he's done very
poorly for investors with AMCV. And he also has done very poorly for
stockholders of his Chart House restaurant chain. He, as the controlling
shareholder and chairman of AMCV and CHT,just doesn't seem to have a business
plan that works or even that anyone (I) can understand.

I'm going to bet that there's a pony somewhere in the pile though. The stock's
at a multiyear low, and so p/bk and p/sales look very good. Maybe the stock's
as low as it's ever been ---- until the market opens on Monday (ouch!). The
issues with AMCV are not new or surprising (as far as I can surmise), yet in
past years, people thought enough of the company to value the now $5 stock at
prices $15 or more. It seems to me that there ought to be a market for US
coastal cruises, and that if it's decimated now because of recessionary or fuel
issues, MAYBE at some point business will recover enough to enable a
better-managed AMCV to show profits.

To me, either AMCV is going to crater (maybe bankruptcy??) or else the stock at
some point is a double from here. I'll bet the latter.

Started a position this week in TUG.

Sells for just under $9.00/share; (all following numbers are based on my
peculiar manipulation of the data contained in their most recent 10K
filing)...it has Free Cash Flow of $2.90/share; pays 40 cents in dividend; has
a price to Free Cash Flow of about 3 (for the more traditional types, you'll
have to do your own P/E, cause I don't use it); it has a price to book of just
over 1 (I don't use this either, but for giggles I have added the calculation
to my spreadsheet so I can see how it compares to what I consider more "real"
numbers); it is selling for about 2.5 times its NetNet or liquidation value; it
is buying back its own shares (this is based on the Statement of Cash Flows,
not press releases); Insiders are buying a lot at these prices.

Technically, it looks like it is in a long consolidation pattern after more
than doubling. The MACD has crossed over to positive territory, so an upside
move from here appears to be indicated.

The dividend and share buy-back indicate (to me only) that management is very
aware of shareholder return on investment.

The current policies in Washington that promote exploration and development of
energy reserves over conservation, appear to me to indicate high energy prices
will be around for quite a while, which I interpret to mean a good business
environment for TUG.

I have private targets for the stock, but don't wish to state them.

I suspect FAF, FNF, others are coining money now. Whether this will be
eventually reflected in higher stock prices for title insurers, I do not know.

I'm looking at FAF, FNF, and STC in this arena. Others I've rejected. I can't

I've gone back into FAF with a small exploratory position today. I'm

Hi Jeff -

A couple of comments since I started the LPAC interest. If LPAC sinks back to
$2 it could be dead money for sometime. The break and hold over 2.50 is crucial
in my mind to the stock's eventual progression to fair value over $5.

LPAC was dumped viciously in December for tax loss selling. The institutions
would have started dumping at $10 and finished once LPAC dropped under $5. This
is not a fund-held stock, at least not for now.

Forward growth - I expect minimum 10% and up to 20%. It is not a business where
you can ramp revenues tremendously without personnel and equipment additions -
growth is also not easy to digest.

LPAC's virtue is an established, profitable business in a stable industry (no
matter who is hot and who is not, TV shows and movies are always made and have
to be post-produced). Sooner or later, I expect a triple from my position
averaged in at $2.

Good luck.

Wayne C. Oops. Looks like I took profits too soon in ALCO. Perhaps you've read
the positive write-up in latest issue of Barron's which caused (imo) the very
nice pop in ALCO stock (18 to 24) this morning. The article mentioned an
investor who recently wrote to Barron's telling them of an ancient Barron's
article (-g-, written in early 1980's) which described ALCO's very undervalued
land values. Funny, but I do remember that 1980's article. A Florida
stockbroker/investor I believe named Robert Lily, who liked Fla. land plays,
was the prime interviewee then who provided a sum-of-parts valuation, if I
recall correctly.

As the current issue of Barron's points out, ALCO's been a tough one to hold
for seeing intrinsic value realized. That is, for seeing the corporation take
steps to monetize and realize the land values.

Although, occasionally over the years there've been a couple of run ups in the
stock with subsequent retracement. I never bought nor sold until I established
my position after it was announced a couple of years ago that Warren Buffett
had a position in a similar (imo) Florida land company. And I'm still holding
that one.

Congratulations to your broker, others who've recommended the stock. I haven't
an opinion on what long time investors should do. On the one hand, some real
estate is being sold and going to be reflected in the earnings. Maybe more will
be sold. The patient long time holders could see this as justification and
encouragement to hold. OTOH, the stock has always dropped back from its spikes
(and Barron's inspired spikes can be temporary). So I'd be betting that now
would be a good time to sell some shares. bwdik.

Yes, Dale, we know JOE on this thread. And FLA.
JOE's a stock I've been watching intermittently for maybe 25 years. Never did
take a position until some folks here about a couple years back convinced me it
was not too late to start. I did, stock moved up smartly, and I sold (4/'00 @
maybe $27.5 and before the 10/'00 $9.39 div.) Looks like I should've held on.

I say if anybody's in JOE now and they've got patience, they should continue to
hold. Stock ought to do well over next few years, just as it's done well for
patient investors over the past many years. Maybe value will be even more
quickly realized since they are trying to develop land holdings and, with the
new management of the past couple of years, are more stockholder oriented.

I muffed chances to reenter JOE at prices under 20 (vs. today's 25). I'll try
again if it gets near lows.

I'm responding to requested opinion on JOE, but I must state that there are
people on the thread who've met or spoken with management, visited JOE
properties, and looked really closely at the company's assets and the company's
strategic plans and potential. I've done none of these things. So I defer to

Hi TimbaBear,

I have been trying to value CDO. I listened to the conference call and have
been very familiar with the company for years. Nick, who resigned, left the

The company has a tremendous amount of debt (I believe about $5 billion), and
has enormous write-offs from its venture investments and Prism unit.

On a positive side, 1) GS is trying to find buyers, 2) CDO has two profitable
business units, and 3) the new CEO is experiened and hard nose.

Based upon everything that I know about CDO, I believe the risks outweight the
rewards. I just don't have a true sense on the remaining intrinsic value.

$13.16 as I write.

This is awe-inspiring to watch. Kind of like a 100-year flood. Awesome to
behold, but you don’t want to be in the way. Unfortunately, I'm in the way!

Hi, Paul:
I am interested on a PB, PS basis. Compensation of senior management seems to
be an issue, given such p#$$ poor performance.
It's one of those stocks I would trade because I use the product (other
examples being LUV, MCD, DIS). I'm a runner, and I love Saucony Grid Stabil
shoes. Recently ordered two pairs, have another 2 pair on order - probably go
through 5 pair/year. The new model is great.
That being said, something is not working in SCNY land. I will talk to a very
good friend who used to rep Nike, who currently does team sales and retail at a
local sporting goods store.

Wallace

Your Welcome Paul. I sold MOBE at 3.70 after entering at 2

Need some cash to build initial positions I have taken
recently in AREM and LENS. Aremissoft is a grossly under-
valued sofware/IT company under attack by short sellers.
LENS emerged last week from a long, boring base under 7

Hi, Paul... been relatively quiet recently with the indexes appreciating. I've
added some to existing positions. I sold Wild Oats just shy of $8 with an
average cost of $5.62... about 28% gain over 6 months. They received a going
concern warning from their auditors. I don't know if I have seen that on an $8
stock before. I sold Kmart just shy of $10... I bought at $5 and $6 in
September of last year. Threw in the towel on JCP at $20... about a 20 percent
loss. Closed out most of my Service Corp for a slight gain at $4.75. Sold
Parker Hannifin at $49 to become more defensive... held it 3 years for about
14% annualized.

I started positions in:
Cadbury Schweppes (CSG) at $25... makes and distributes Dr. Pepper, 7Up,
Hawaian Punch, Snapple, Schweppes, Canada Dry, Mott's apple products and
Cadbury chocolates. I bought on the basis that it was valued around 15x free
cash flow.

Monsanto at $32 ... the leading agbio company. I bought it based on liking
agbio, a PE of 18, and the fact that the EU has already softened on
"genetically modified organisms" because the commercial importance is becoming
apparent.

Hi Paul,

I recently took a position in MT at $5.00. It's a good turn around story,
trading at well below book, and currently gaining some momentum.
www.valueinvestorsclub.com has a good write up on it. I've been following it
for some time, waiting for a pull back, but once it became clear it wasn't
going to pull back, I had to pull the trigger. It's up already 100% since last
years lows. 3 years out, things look very good. The Bass family has placed new
mgmt to fix things; bankrupcy seems a thing of the past, the rise above $5.00
brings new buyers into range, good insider buying. There's still plenty of room
to move for this one.

Also have CAT, picked up during last summers discussion led by James Clarke and
others - up well over 50% at the moment ( in at $34.5 ). Not sure what kind of
target price to set for this one. At the moment I see it as a play on power
generation ( IT/California in particular ), which has been growing close to 30%
a year for them. That's probably not going to stop any time soon. Any ideas,
comments, or suggestions?

ALLC could be ready for a pop with their recent dividend increase and move to
the NYSE.

Currently fretting about AREM.... Probably not necessary, but that's my nature.
Give me those sleepy value stocks like USG...LOL!

Just my late night ramblings....

Good investing!

I'll add a little CLRN today to somewhat average down my losing position.

Looks like CLRN will be going into the government market with signing of
General Dynamics as a reseller.

CLRN stock goes for twice cash. There's no LTD.

CLRN is expected by analysts to have positive earnings by next year. That might
mean cash drain could be minimized.

Irwin Jacobs has taken a position (5/10/01 13D filing).

To me, this stock is very volatile.

Paul,

I am in the IT field, have been following voice over ip for about 18 months
now. Let me tell you, voice over ip is going to be huge over the next 3-5
years. I have invested in several voip companies, ININ, ATGN, and CLRN. ATGN is
selling for less than cash value and no long term debt, just announced stock
buy back as well. I am averaged down to about $2 a share for about 15k shares.
CLRN is my biggest holding right now, started at about 28ish a share(I know, to
expensive, my mistake), but now with about 5k shares at 13ish average. Jacobs
knows what he is doing, I am looking out 2-3 years.

I'm considering ACAP also, Doug. Imo, these physician insurers should - as they
have in the past - sell near or at book value. So imo, there's a lot of share
price movement that could occur with ACAP before I would consider the stock
fully priced.

My first choice in this sector is SKP. SKP is struggling more than ACAP. Maybe
that's because SKP is concentrated in the more litigious California market.
(ACAP being strong in the midwest) SKP has a longer trading history; ACAP only
has traded for a few months.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=c&c=acap&t=5y&s=skp&l=on&z=m&q=l

I'm considering either adding a bit more to my very small SKP position or
diversifying in the sector by adding ACAP.
Given the right pricing environment - IF that should ever occur, these stocks
will go higher (imo).

Sport-Haley says SEC conducting formal investigation
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Reuters) - Sport-Haley Inc. (NasdaqNM:SPOR - news), a maker
of golf apparel and outerwear, on Monday said the Securities and Exchange
Commission is conducting a formal investigation into the company.

The Denver-based company did not provide details of the formal investigation
but said the SEC was looking into whether the company or officers, directors,
or employees violated any U.S. securities laws.

The formal investigation was disclosed in a quarterly filing made with the SEC
on Monday. Last November, Sport-Haley disclosed that the SEC had opened an
informal inquiry.

``The company previously provided documents requested by the commission and
voluntarily provided testimony,'' the company said in Monday's filing. ``The
commission has not brought an action against the company, but it may do so in
the future.''

No details of the informal probe were provided in the November filing.

re CAT: Very good move in that stock. I couldn't see it.
I don't understand if CAT is a growth stock, a cyclical stock, or a value
stock. Maybe it's been all of them. (And maybe I should go back and read Mr.
Buffett's opinion -something about it's not an either/or situation between
growth and value.) CAT is selling at the high end of its recent p/sales. Looks
like over the past few years sales have grown from 16 to 20 billion. But
debt/equity has doubled. Shares outstanding have come down somewhat. ROE has
worsened.

I suspect the critical issue though is as you point out - that the likelihood
of an increase in government spending - power generation, maybe other
infrastructure - roads, bridges - and the concomitant attention this brings to
investors - might be enough to continue to propel CAT's stock price. I say yes,
because it seems to me that just as construction company stocks are up at new
highs in anticipation of new business, I expect construction equipment stocks
like CAT to see new highs too.

Of course, I defer to the thread expert on CAT, who I believe to be Mr. Clarke.

I continue to hold my construction-related stocks in anticipation of further
gains.

Date:5/21/2001 7:37:31 PM
From:Craig Bartels
True, there is a lot of players, a bunch of small players. That's why I picked
CLRN as the one with the greatest potential to suceed, IMHO. Some reasons as
follows:

1)CLRN leads China in VOIP minutes, 37% compared to something like 13% for
Cisco, and all others are below that. China is a huge opportunity, more so than
the United States at the current time. Reason being is there is no network in
place in most of China. voip is cheaper to deploy, cheaper rates, and allows
easier management of telephony and data. China online has some good articles
regarding the deployments.
2) CLRN leads the world in Voip minutes, was at I believe 25% for 1999, and at
31-32% for 2000. Clarent is beating Cisco at their own game. Red Herring had a
good article about an internal email that said "Beat Clarent". It may or may
not be true, but wouldnt' suprise me. Cisco has been spending all it's time and
resources trying to keep afloat, Clarent is smaller, nimbler and has inroads
that Cisco currently doesn't have.
3) Soft switches later this year with approx 2,000 ports, this will be huge
when it's announced.
4) The market is huge over the next 3-5 years. there is many competitors, but
the pie can be split among multiple participants and can still generate a large
amount of sales, profits for all involved.
5) CLRN is trying to move away from hardware and more to software/support
sales. Much higher gross margins.

What worries me: Burn rate of CLRN, still have 230-250mill in cash, no long
term debt, but when are we going to be profitable? It's been pushed back to
next year, could it be pushed back further?
Will price wars pretty much kill all profits in voip? I guess time will tell.
I'm sure the same could have been said about Cisco 10-12 years ago.
I follow technology a lot, and believe Voice over IP is the next killer
software/application/hardware in the future. I realized the internet was big in
1993 when I started college, but didn't realize the potential of some of the
companies deploying it. I feel this is the next part of the puzzle, all IMHO...

I think Jacobs getting involved is good news for CLRN. I just don't want to see
them bought out and ruin the stock/company like I have seen in the past.

I have followed voice over ip like no other technology/investment before, we'll
see if I have to eat my words in the future, or whether things come about as I
envision.
