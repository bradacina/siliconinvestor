PLT. Paul, you know I like Plantronics.

I sold them last August and bought them back in March. I think I posted here
both times. And, I bought some more PLT yesterday.

I sure like the REITs. I bought more MAA and UHT. This article mentions a few
factors why they may still be undervalued.

These are my favorites. I am weighted toward the apartment sector:

re TGP arb;

I think the high dividend in combination with a 'pending private letter ruling
from the IRS' discouraged the arbs from shorting PCL to narrow the discount.
Now that PCL said they will close (in light of the IRS policy re real estate
spinoffs), I would have expected the discount to narrow. But I don't think it
has.

Another potential positive is the inclusion of PCL in the REIT index announced
this PM.

Grommit, re: PLT, REITS, SCZ.
Regarding PLT: Oops, I forgot to search the site thread, and now I see you've
discussed PLT here. Looks like nice timing on your buy yesterday (stock popped
a bit today). I need to do some more consideration of PLT before I step in.

re: REITs. In general they have performed very well, imo. In the sense that for
most, their stock prices are at highs rather than at lows. Nice capital gains
(plus good dividends) in some that were mentioned here in the past couple of
years.
For now, I've got BED and MAA on my watch list. (I have no positions in those
two.) My difficulty in stepping up to these after I've wrongly passed them buy
at lower prices right now outweighs my desire for their high and apparently
stable or growing dividends. My mental issue.

I will be making a trip to NYC this week to count cranes (and shop and eat in
fancy restaurants). If I don't see a construction boom, I may step up and buy
VNO. The assumption being that the supply side of real estate there is not
being increased. For the demand side, I'll check with my sorta-real
estate-knowledgeable relative to try to see if rents are coming down or
stabilizing.

I like SCZ. Maybe because I've started a position recently and I'm still
enamored of the possibilities it has. I'm in the honeymoon stage -g-. Its charm
is it doesn't pay a dividend, and it is not trapped by rules that REITs have to
follow. Yet, in its corporate body it operates REIT mutual funds, and it owns
big chunks of CARRAmerica (office properties), ProLogis (distribution (aside:
with a big Silicon Valley presence --oops)), Regency (shopping centers), and
Storage USA. Plus SCZ are overseas.

SCZ has some interesting value investors - Baupost, Franklin, Wellington,
Clipper, Templeton --- geez some of the smartest value investors. Well, most
famous anyway. I am hoping they still see value in this stock and that they
haven't been in it at its lows so that they aren't just waiting to sell out now
to the likes of johnny-come-latelys like me.

Paul.

not trying to tout SCZ the stock or SCZ as a substitute for REITs. As sort of
pointed out by Dale Baker here - I too believe that with SCZ one likely needs
to be very patient -- for sporadic real estate deals and gains to occur, be
transferred to bottom line, and be reflected in a rising stock price. Whether
that will happen and whether I have the patience for it are TBD.

I don't think it's too late for PLT at all.

Maybe it's a mental thing with me too, since I timed a good buy and sell of PLT
a couple of times over the years. I follow the company closely, and previously
thought that computers with voice recognition would provide the
killer-application to take the company off the charts. But maybe car telephones
is the killer-ap. NY is the first state to outlaw hand helds, but California
can't be far behind.

I will be buying more PLT. No debt, market leader, huge ROE, reasonable P/E,
and now a good story that will spread and be featured in investment articles,
no doubt. I would suggest avoiding looking at the stock's high and low price
for the year if that causes you to kick yourself for not doing this or that.
The stock exists at the present price. If the stock price was at $21-23 for the
past year, and then the NY law was passed, would you buy the stock? The fact
that the price also went to $56 and $16 in the recent past is water under the
bridge. Excuse the preaching.

Plantronics: Not So Fast!

http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/herbonthestreet-rm/1475989.html

Herb Greenberg wrote the below column excerpt from today's realmoney.com. Herb
is one writer who has saved me significant amounts of money: by pointing out,
ad nauseum, problems with Lucent, LHSP, Cree, etc. -- all in the past year.
This is one person's view, but Herb has a lot of respect from short sellers and
money managers. Just another perspective.

____________________________________________________________

"One-hit wonder?: Don't look now but Plantronics (PLT:NYSE - news -
commentary), the headset maker, has been rapidly rising on the hype that New
York's new ban on using cell phones while driving will boost demand for
headsets. And who is the likely winner? Among public companies, all fingers are
pointing to Plantronics.

Maybe it will be a winner, but not the winner.

Reality, for Plantronics, is that its cell-phone headset business last year,
while up 200%, accounted for only about 12% of Plantronics' sales. The rest of
its business includes sales to telemarketers, which have been hit by a sharp
slowdown, and sales to offices, which a spokeswoman says "is difficult to call"
because of the economy. In fact, sales have been slowing so much that
Plantronics issued two earnings warnings in the March quarter, with a big
reduction in guidance for the current quarter.

Not good for a company like Plantronics, which Tom Chanos, of Badger
Consultants, calls a one-hit wonder. Sure, it makes more than one kind of
headset, but "they are all still headsets," says Chanos, who has a sell rating
on Plantronics. ( Other notable sells by Chanos, in this column, included Dell
(DELL:Nasdaq - news - commentary), before its big dive, and Teligent
(TGNT:Nasdaq - news - commentary), long before it filed for bankruptcy. )

Making Plantronics extra vulnerable are its gross margins. While falling for
two years, they're still a respectable 50%, which means they have plenty of
room to drop as competitors with lower prices enter what may very well evolve
into a hot market for a commodity product.

A spokeswoman, however, says Plantronics isn't worried about competition
because it has "very strong and long relationships with a very broad range of
distributors," including exclusive agreements that could block newcomers.
Maybe, but that doesn't preclude cell-phone makers (under pressure themselves)
from striking deals directly with competitors, or those same competitors from
going to distributors that don't have nonexclusive deals.

And as for the New York cell-phone law, it doesn't go into effect for several
months. The whole situation is strangely reminiscent of the big run up in Bell
Sports, the bike-helmet maker, when it was thought that every state was going
to create laws making it illegal for kids to ride bikes without helmets. Turns
out competitors cashed in on the craze with cheap knockoffs, and Bell's booming
stock turned into a bust. The company, deeply in debt, eventually was sold..."

Bob- I am a lot less favorably inclined to CCK now. as a result of the asbestos
scare this last winter and the subsequent downgrades, there cost of funding has
gone way up. plus the performance of their business operations have not bounced
back as quickly as I hoped. it is not clear at this point if their funds from
operations are going to be sufficient to cover interest costs for an extended
period of time. I still own some but would probably sell the rest back in the
$5 range. of course if they do pull out of this, the upside is quite
significant.

I have also exited out of the OI I bought in December. I do own USG (from

NITE....the bad news of lower trade volumes and slower overseas enthusiasm
(i.e. EASDAQ) for trading have already been priced into the stock at these
levels.

If one believes that we are heading into an upswing in the US economy, I
believe that there is enough trading volume potential left for a hefty increase
in revenues. Yes, many day-traders and high volume traders got wiped out over
the last few years, but many just learned how to play the short side and are
still trading.

I believe we'll see an increase in on-line trading (which NITE gets a decent
share of) and an increase in the brokerage businesses. Maybe not anywhere near
the old levels, but high enough for NITE to give a decent return. Addition
source of revenue from heavy options playing as they have acquired that ability
over the years as well.

JMO, I have traded in and out of NITE many times and am currently back in. I
was a little early (about two weeks), I'm in at $12.30/share.

I view this as more of a trading stock (good for quick 30-40% pops) than a long
term hold though. I think it has a Beta of about 4, so it is not for the faint

# of Holdings & % of Cash Questions:

I, admittedly, am partial to Mr. Burry, Paul Senior, TimbaBear, and the other
thread posters who post intelligent thoughts and rationale.

I'm curious to how many individual securities you typically hold; do you hold
any mutual funds; do you hold any long-term securities (vs. value plays); and
do you typically hold a certain percentage of cash?

I recognize that one's philosophy will change with the market's valuations and
one's strategy. But it would be interesting to note your general investing
actions.

(To answer my own questions: I typically hold 10-15 individual stocks; I have
about 30% of my portfolio in Vanguard securities; 10 securities are long-term &
5 special situation plays -- this is typcially what I do; I have about 5-10%
cash at the present time.)

NITE is a market maker's market maker. If trading activity in BB stocks is
(relative to recent past) heavier than normal, the income generated from those
trades will appear to be higher proportionately. However, if trading volume in
NASDAQ issues picks up, as I expect it will throughout the remainder of the
year, then the income generated by those trades will show the most improvement.

"....now that the speculative fervor has abated...." I'm not sure that the
speculative fervor has abated as much as it might appear from the trading
volumes. I believe that there is a lot of speculation occurring on the short
side. The desire to gamble is as strong in this country today as ever it was, I
don't see a moratorium on new casinos.

It won't be too long before we discover whether my feeling is right or not. I
expect by the end of the year either the stories will include an increase in
trading volume or the story will be that the investors fail to return to the
market.

Right now, a lot of investors/speculators have thrown in the towel and gone
with more traditional full-service brokers and that has had a dampening effect
on volume and on on-line trading. But as the market recovers, the same factors
that drove these same investors to enter their own trades (the cost savings)
will likely serve to drive these folks back to doing their own trades. Maybe
not as exuberantly as before, but more than they are now. And NITE and the
other market makers and ECNs will all benefit.

Yes, NITE is selling higher than its BV, and yes, it is selling at higher than
its NetNet value. I didn't recommend it as a NetNet play, (although at these
levels in this market, it might be considered a value play of sorts) I was
responding to someone else's discussion of it. In my response, I called NITE a
"trading play" and that "bump" you refer to, is what I usually play for a
30-40% short term gain.

I like NITE from a little longer term perspective too. NITE has a market cap of

that NITE could earn as much as 80cents/shr even in the current environment.
That's not bad. They are the market leader and should be the consolidator of
this fragmented business. Plus as their margins are shrunk by decimalization,
they have the option of no longer paying for order flow. this would do wonders
for their bottom line. Let's face it, as the trading margins shrink, this is
where the business has to go. the end result will be higher real commissions
for everyone. There are certainly some risks to this scenario and the current
business model; but the balance sheet gives you the strength and time to wait.

Regarding holdings....I own stock in about 15 to 20 different companies for my
individual and several jointly owned accounts. I am currently fully invested in
those accounts. In my wife's accounts, we tend more toward mutual funds, UITs,
and long term holdings which are divided among about 6 companies and she likes
to keep about 15% cash.

I also manage accounts for several other people and in those accounts, I have
maybe 10 different companies, no mutual funds or UITs and about 10% cash.

Most of the holdings I have acquired over the last 6 months will likely turn
out to be very long term holdings because of how cheaply they have been
purchased. However, some of the companies I own and will own in the future are
trading vehicles in which I try to take advantage of short term movements in
prices. These represent maybe 40% of my personal holdings and, maybe 15% of the
managed accounts.

As you qualified in your question, these numbers are fluid and I am not averse
to going 100% cash or even shorting if my view of the situation deems it

more so than my holds. I almost expect now that most of these sold stocks will
move up after I sell 'em. Painful though after I've held for quite a while at a

Fash is up 15% on announcement of a share tender offer. You could say this is

Grommit, okay, joining you today with JBX; I've started a small position.

It's still not very cheap on p/e and p/sales, imo. But they are cutting debt,
have a very good ROE, and over past few years have increased sales. I don't
know how they do all this in such a competitive environment, but they do. Or
they seem to anyway.

Imo, worth a small bet for people who would try to have a 12 month or more

RWY, Post 10k filing. I posted this on Yahoo

3756&mid=4756&n=1
What is the investment case for this?
Looks like income and cash flow are negative before extraordinary items, so
it's hard to make a DCF case without assuming a dramatic turnaround.
Lenders are going to extract substantial concessions IF they don't force it
into BK as indicated by the 'going concern' warning [Which are rare and dire
contrary to comments on this board, IMO]. The increased borrowing costs won't
help already negative earnings.
It's hard to make a net net asset case when one considers that rental furniture
inventories must be marked down on close out and goodwill is questionable at
best when dealing with 'going concern' assets.
Buyout: I got an EV/EBITDA [not including Dep for rental furn as that's
ordinary expense in this biz] of 19.5. Given the distressed situation an
EV/EBITDA of 10 would be high - there's plenty of good businesses selling below
that. EV/EBITDA based on net debt only, 0 Equity, would be 12.9. So it's
unlikely buyers are going to line up to pay a premium to current levels.
I know, it sounds like I'm ripping this to shreds, but I'm not short and I am
looking to find the 'PEARL' in this ugly looking oyster...if there is one.
I sincerely look forward to hearing from informed longs on why this is a great
buy at these levels.

Does anyone know what "run-off" means in the context below ?
I have never heard that term.

The Enstar Group, Inc. Announces Joint Venture To Acquire Reinsurance Companies
MONTGOMERY, Ala., June 28 /PRNewswire/ -- The Enstar Group, Inc. (``Enstar'')
(OTC Bulletin Board: ESGR - news) and Castlewood Limited (``Castlewood''), a
private Bermuda based firm which is experienced in managing and acquiring
insurance and reinsurance operations, announced their intent to acquire River
Thames Insurance Company Limited, based in London, England, and Bermuda-based
Overseas Reinsurance Corporation Limited, from Rivers Group Limited and
Sedgwick Group Limited, respectively. The purchase will be effected through a
Bermuda holding company, Revir Limited (``Revir''), which was formed for the
purpose of the acquisition and is owned 50% each by Enstar and Castlewood.
Revir has signed a definitive agreement with Rivers Group Limited and Sedgwick
Group Limited, UK-based subsidiaries of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., for
the purchase of the two reinsurance companies.

``This venture, our second with Castlewood, expands our role in the insurance
industry and our focus on managing insurance and reinsurance companies in
run-off. We are interested in finding additional run-off opportunities to
pursue together,'' said Nimrod T. Frazer, Enstar's Chairman and CEO.

RJM - In response to your question:Does anyone know what "run-off" means in the
context below ?
I have never heard that term.

The likely meaning of the term is as follows:the company acquired is not
actively writing new business, i.e. it is in a runoff mode. Hence the acquiring
company needs to make an evaluation of reported liabilities and future cash
flows, based on claims made and an assesment of IBNR.

rjm2 run-off [Here are some definitions from reinsurance glossaries - Hope this
helps] Cancellation - (a) Run-off basis means that the liability of the
reinsurer under policies, which became effective under the treaty prior to the
cancellation date of such treaty, shall continue until the expiration date of
each policy; (b) Cut-off basis means that the liability of the reinsurer under
policies, which became effective under the treaty prior to the cancellation
date of such treaty, shall cease with respect to losses resulting from
accidents taking place on and after said cancellation date. Usually the
reinsurer will return to the company the unearned premium portfolio, unless the
treaty is written on an earned premium basis.

Run-Off Cancellation or Termination
A provision in the termination clause (or endorsement) of a reinsurance
contract stipulating that the reinsurer shall remain liable for loss under
reinsured policies in force at the date of termination, as a result of
occurrences taking place after the date of termination, until their natural
expiry (and often that the run-off period may not exceed twelve months from the
date of termination). See Cut-Off Cancellation or Termination. (Editor's Note:
Runoff is one word when used as a noun, two words as a verb transitive, and
hyphenated as a compound adjective e.g., a runoff runs off insurance business
in force on a run-off basis.)
Portfolio Run-off - The opposite of Return of Portfolio - permitting premiums
and losses in respect of in-force business to run to their normal expiration
upon termination of a reinsurance treaty.

I haven't heard the term, but it might be one of those terms that are different
in the UK than here. (i.e knock-up vs. call).

If I were to guess, I'd say the term is used to describe the act of placing
excess insurance needs with another insurer, a re-insurer. The re-insurer could
then be said to be handling the "run-off" from the insurer.

Re-insurers are not retailers by definition, so an association with a source of
supply would make sense.

If this interpretation is correct, then I gather that they are looking to put
together more combinations of insurer and re-insurer.

Just a guess though.

I bought ESGR a few years ago as a shell with a boatload of cash & NOLs hired 2
hotshots from Goldman Sacs, One of which invested $15 million. They looked for
deals for a long time and then found this reinsurance thing. Invested $9.6
million in July 2000 for a 1/2 voting and 1/3 economic interest and so far have
gotten capital distributions & dividends totaling $10.2 million with the
principal still on the balance sheet.

There is no disclosure of excess liabilities in the filings and it SOUNDS too
good to be true.

I just cant see who would leave this kind of $$ on the table like that.

Interesting thing is they earned $1.55 a share last year with only 14% of their
assets in insurance stuff. The rest was in cash.

Book is about $17 but with their NOLs & these smart guys on board, I suspect it
could continue much higher than the recent $20. Just hard to figure how they
can find deals like this when the rest of the world cant.

re your mention of CTO. This stock was brought up on the Buffettology thread
when (if I recall correctly) it became apparent that Mr. Buffett (or his
surrogate --- Twister will point out I sometimes have gotten confused as to
who's behind Mr. Buffett's picks) had a position in Baker, Fentress. At the
time, Baker, Fentress was attempting to sell or otherwise monitize its assets
to get its stock price closer to its (higher) intrinsic value. There was some
indication - again if I recall correctly - that maybe Mr. Buffett was keeping
some of his resulting position in CTO. That's when I looked at CTO and took my
position.

I will reiterate that anyone buying these land development companies ought to
consider taking them on as a package. Anyone buying has got to figure on being
in for a very long time. (aside: Keith, as you know, Alico (ALCO) has done
fabulously since it was mentioned in Barron's a few months ago. However, for
decades, there was nothing close to its recent performance. I call this recent
upsurge in ALCO a strange and wonderful gift for recent and long-time holders.)
It's not possible - imho - to predict when these companies' stocks will move.
Being diversified increases the likelihood of benefiting from a serendipitous
event with one of these companies - imo.

I'll add that in Barron's mutual fund section this week there's a positive
discussion of Catellus Development (CDX)by two Oakmark fund managers. I'm long
this stock as well, and I've mentioned that it's a favorite of Marty Whitman.
(He who doesn't like diversification -g-). Imo, it's an example of a
land-developer stock which might be considered by somebody in conjunction with
a purchase of CTO.

*** for distressed Bond Buyers only ***

After careful consideration, I just bought the Transwitch 4.5% of 9/12/2005
bonds.
There are $460,000,000 of the bonds outstanding; this bond issue is all of
TXCC's long term debt. The bonds are convertible into 16.1492 shares of TXCC
stock. Or the conversion price is $61.92 ($1000/16.1492). Also, TXCC has the
option to call or retire the bonds early at 100 by
9/12/2003 if the common trades higher than $92 for 3 months.

The price of the bonds were 71.5, I bought thru E*Trade.
You may be able to get a better price if you have an account with Merrill Lynch
(see below).
The bonds yield to maturity is 13.70% so the bonds are trading like junk.
Although the interest is covered 524.880 by the cash flow. And the discriminant
anaylysis z-score is 5.695, which translates into the bonds and the company not
being distressed or in danger of default. As of Dec 31, 2000 there was
$564,123,000 of cash on the balance sheet, more than enough to repay the bond
and pay the 5 years of interest payments. I see very little risk in buying the
bonds.

Debt is 64.111% of the capitalization of the company which is a bit high
compared to the average company BUT not too high for a profitable technology
company. Also, in the 2 years before this issue there was $0 long term debt on
TXCC's balance sheet. Again, remember the company usually has no debt; this
debt was issued recently for "general corporate purposes".

The company has stingy, strong leadership in Dr. Das and their SONET business
is solid with growing revenues and earnings. TXCC will survive the current
economic weakness in the technology sector. The CFO, Pete Tallian helped me
find the market maker, Merrill Lynch, for the bonds, so he is at shareholder
friendly.

Press Release
Broder Bros. to Acquire Full Line Distributors, Inc.
Agreement Advances Focused Distribution Strategy
PLYMOUTH, Mich. & BALL GROUND, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 10, 2001--Broder
Bros., Co., the nation's largest wholesaler of imprintable sportswear, and Full
Line Distributors, Inc. (AMEX: FLD - news), a wholesale manufacturer and
distributor of decorable sportswear, today announced they have entered into a
definitive merger agreement.

Under the terms of the agreement, a subsidiary of Broder Bros. will promptly
commence a cash tender offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock of Full Line Distributors at a price of $2.95 per share. Any
shares not tendered in the offer will receive the same price in cash in a
second-step merger. The Board of Directors of Full Line Distributors has
unanimously approved the transaction and recommended that shareholders tender
their shares in the offer.

Shareholders holding approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Full Line
shares have entered into a stockholders' agreement to tender their shares in
the offer. Full Line has approximately 4.2 million shares outstanding.

Upon closing the merger, Broder Bros. intends to integrate Full Line's six
distribution warehouses into Broder Bros.' national network, effectively
doubling the geographic reach of the combined company. Broder Bros. also
intends to explore the possibility of divesting Full Line's manufacturing
business, but plans to continue marketing the proprietary Rabbit Skins and LAT
Sportswear brands of the combined company in upcoming catalogs and product
guides.

``This transaction drives the long-term strategic plan to maximize our core
distribution business,'' said Vince Tyra, CEO of Broder Bros., which is based
in Plymouth, Michigan and had approximately $440 million in revenues in 2000.
``With the addition of Full Line's geographic presence, the combined company
will be well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities while enhancing
our high standards of customer service.''

``Full Line and Broder Bros. share a very similar, customer-driven
philosophy,'' said Isador Mitzner, CEO of Full Line Distributors, which is
headquartered in Atlanta and had approximately $100 million in revenues in
2000. ``We are pleased to be part of Broder's future, and look forward to
quickly and successfully integrating our two companies.''

Consummation of the tender offer is subject to certain terms and conditions,
including the tender of at least 50 percent of the outstanding shares
(determined on a fully diluted basis) and the receipt by Broder Bros. of
sufficient financing for the acquisition. Broder Bros. has obtained commitments
from a bank group led by Bank One to provide the funding necessary for the
acquisition. Broder Bros. and Full Line were advised by Bain Capital, LLC and
CoView Capital, Inc., respectively.

About Broder Bros., Co.

Founded in 1919, Broder Bros., Co. is the nation's largest wholesaler of
imprintable sportswear. With headquarters in Plymouth, Michigan and
distribution warehouses throughout the country, Broder Bros. offers the largest
combined one- and two-day shipping services in the industry. Carrying a broad
collection of basic tees, golf shirts and sweatshirts, as well as a full range
of corporate casualwear including outerwear, wovens, sweaters and denim at all
locations, Broder Bros. ensures that the product customers want is available
from a nearby location. Broder Bros. was acquired by Bain Capital, LLC., a
global private equity firm with more than $12 billion in assets under
management, in 2000.

Hi Paul!

Since that list, I have refined my analytical approach quite a bit. In the
list, the only company I invested in was ARWM.

Other investments that have met my criteria lately are: TUG, REF, SLS,
HAKI(especially at the lower levels), AAPL, W, NITE(as a speculation only), and
KAB.

KAB has been and continues to be a fascinating play for me. I did the analysis
based upon someone's recommendation on this thread. For purposes of discussion
I'll say I bought 300 shares (which I did, in multiples). Now, a month or so
later instead of 300 KAB, I have 300 XNR and 100 KSL. I am up about 12% overall
in this purchase and the KSL shares are still not valued properly by the
market. The reason for this is that KSL is going to pay $1.20/sh. dividend but,
because the listing for that symbol is so new, none of the popular sites (like
Yahoo) list it as having a dividend (it doesn't show up on my Reuters feed
either). This is about an 8% yield at the current stock price. And this on a
company with very sound fundamentals and a very nice cash flow. I figure we
have until November when the first 30 cent dividend is paid before the stock
price starts climbing to reflect a more appropriate yield. My WAG on a price is
in the $20 area.

Overall, I think that this may be a contrary indicator as is put-call ratio.
Insiders in general are NOT great in predicting stock moves and are NOT great
investors. In the bull market, almost everyone held their company shares. Now,
with the stocks tumbling and slowdown in business, people are locking in
"whatever is left".

On one hand, this may herald a long recession and bear market if people are
scared to expand their business and to invest in equities. On the other hand,
with Fed rates dropping, there is a point when money market is not attractive
either.

" Insiders in general are NOT great in predicting stock moves and are NOT great

That's simply not true. Insider selling isn't especially reliable, since
insiders may have many reasons for needing cash. But insider buying is very
often an indication that the company is doing better than outsiders think.

But actually I came to this thread on the suggestion of Papaya King with an
entirely different question. There seem to be very few people on SI following
isnurance companies of any kind. There seem to have been some insurance company
IPOs that have not done very well, and I find myself caught up in one and would
appreciate any information.

Years ago I bought a straight life insurance policy with a mutual insurance
company that is now known as the
Principal Group.

They are "demutualizing" which means they are changing from policy-holder
ownership to stockholder ownership, offering stock to policy holders and doing
an IPO.

They are a huge company, handling more 401K plans than anyone else.

I can take money at the IPO price that is long term capital gains or take
stock. It's a good bit, about 25% of the
face value of the policy.

Does anyone have any feel for how good insurance stocks are?

Yeah, I've got a feeling how good insurance stocks are. They're very good.

But - unfortunately - what I don't have a feeling for is what insurance stocks
to buy now that will go up in price in future. -g-
I'll have to leave that to another or other posters.

In my review of insurance stocks, I found that the large mutuals that went
public generally worked out well for investors in those stocks. (I'm doing this
from memory, I can't provide facts, and I could be wrong.) Here's my list:

4% on a money market is a lot better than minus 50% on the next warning, or the
one after that. In my opinion, until the warnings stop NASDAQ at least is going

Without commenting on the merits of Principal, I was in the same boat with MET
and took the stock. It subsequently doubled. I think John Hancock was another
one which did well. I suspect that these are being priced like the new S&L
stocks, so that a good gain is almost in the bag - although it could have just
been the timing on the others, before a major drop in rates. What I suggest you
do is compare the stock proforma data with others on a Price/Book and P/E basis
to see if the valuation looks low.

Yeah, that's what I meant with the "scare" factor. Unfortunately, it's as
self-feeding as a bull market. Business is down, so let's not buy
widget-midgets from my supplier, so his business is down, so they don't buy

Thanks very much. This is the great thing about SI, isn't it? I don't know how
I could have found such good advice for any amount of money.

It's hard for me to analyze the information they provided because there is so
much of it. They do have a ton of assets that seem to work out to about $140 a
share, and the IPO may be something like $19. But of course a lot of the assets
are to cover policies.

I think I will take the stock and hold it for a while.

Thanks. I think Principal is a pretty good company so I think I will hold the
stock.

Now I am worrying that the very large loan I took (at 5% interest) may have
reduced my share in the company, but it's too late to do anything about that.
They said the shares were calculated on something like "the value of your
policy to the company" ! Getting a cheap loan doesn't help the company a lot.

Incidentally, the example they give suggests an IPO price of $19 and the IPO is
to be late 2001 or early 2002. Maybe I should cash in my policy as soon as I
get my shares and buy more of the stock.

re: "Maybe I should cash in my policy as soon as I get my shares and buy more
of the stock."

Yikes! Way, way too frightening a statement for me. You might do okay coming
here imho to get some ideas about taking stock or not taking stock. To make the
decision though to cash in the policy, that requires expert assistance from
someone who knows you and your family and your financial situation.

I'll step out and give my opinion once again. I hope it sounds good, but
regardless, the one thing for sure is that it should be taken in the light that
it is just coming from some opinionated jerk (me) who has no qualifications in
financial planning or the insurance business.

Insurance is to be bought to protect a stream of future earnings. (We are
talking about your straight life type policies). If there are no earnings to
protect, then straight life policies should not be bought. (I'm giving MY
opinion here). So, if a wife doesn't work, doesn't have an income stream, then
there's no need to have an insurance policy on her such as a life-insurance
policy. Selling insurance policies on children (who don't work) is a vehicle
for sales by insurance people, but I'm saying it's not in the best interests of
most buyers (again, that is my unqualified opinion). I carry this as well to
retired people or wealthy people who don't work. (Their assets provide the
future earnings stream if that is required by family members).

And the insurance need only cover the required future earnings stream. (again,
imo). One doesn't overinsure if one focuses on the primary (imo) purpose:
protect a future stream of earnings.

If the person needs the forced savings that some insurance policies provide,
that could be another matter. Since the savings component in insurance is low
(from what I understand), a little discipline by the buyer in other areas
(TIPS, mutual funds) might serve the person better. I have read where some
people who have said they want insurance have decided that they are better off
(in accumulating some savings) by buying stock in the insurance company on
regular intervals, rather than buying the insurance itself.

My point, after all this, is that if a person doesn't need to protect a future
stream of earnings, then no insurance is necessary (again, just my opinion).
But if one needs to protect a stream of future earnings, then that's what
insurance is for, and the person should not make a decision to dump such
insurance without careful consideration of the risks associated. (If we are
talking swapping insurance - straight life for term, for example, that is a
different story. Here's where a unbiased professional helps)

Thanks, Tommaso for your kind comment.

Insurance was my business and my opinion is that a policy loan would not affect
the amount of stock you get. I am sure you have a phone number to ask any
question about the demutualization that you want. Ask them. As far as trading
in your policy to buy more stock goes, you should remember that the policy is
to protect your survivors against your untimely death. Making money on
investments is a distinctly different issue.

On another subject, a couple of money losing companies have been brought to me
as trading below net cash on the balance sheet, which have also been mentioned
by some money managers - SSSW and TALR. I took a look and have a couple of
observations to show how I look at these. Both companies pass the acid test in
my opinion of being able to live on their cash until the next recovery. Neither
pass the acid test that a huge increase in sales is not required to reach break
even. Both require major increases, determined by comparing current gross
margin dollars from current sales with current operating losses. Therefore,
this makes such companies worth more dead than alive - to an acquirer in the
same business who can keep the cash and get rid of the expense keeping them
from profitability now. Some of these will indeed be bought. However, I think
that is an insufficient justification for investment.

Asset value is Paul Koether & friends. I think its owned via KENT. He also has
control/large positions in PURW & GISH. Also shells CRTQ & TEEE.
They tried to take control of AVCC years ago but ended up selling their block
back to the company & signing a standstill.

I just found out in the last 2 weeks that they even bought into STRZ. I saw
their market maker (TRWN) on the level II for STRZ for a big chunk recently.

My guess, without having talked to either parties, is he bought the position
just on the cheap but cant get and/or doesnt want control or a 10% position
forever.

Not sure how they go from 9.59% to 3.49% by selling only 11,000.

Anyway, they bought a chink at $2.50 so they are up 28% in short order. And
frankly, the stock doesnt have liquidity so they probably realize they have to
sell some WHEN THEY CAN.

Thanks--I am 63 years old and worth more dead than alive!

Wife and I are fully vested in high-paying retirement programs and I was able
to get TIAA nursing home unlimited coverage for both of us; this insurance
policy was something I bought many years ago immediately upon getting married.
It was a real pain to come up with the premiums for several years, but after a
while it became more or less self-funding.

I certainly would not recommend any younger person using cash value of an
insurance policy to speculate, though I am afraid that many people in the 40-55
age range may have done just that.

At this point I am glad I never wasted money on term life insurance. It wasn't
easy to save up those premiums, but the money still belongs to me.

A Value Technology Fund

Are value and technology incompatible? Not according to
Craig Callahan who has compiled a sterling record the last
three years.

According to Morning Star, the fund that he manages, has a 45%
annualized return over the last 36 months placing him second
among all technology funds. What's most impressive to Forbes is
his recent performance. Last year, he was up 14% and this year
he's down only 8% - a remarkable achievement considering what
Nasdaq has done in the last 18 months.

Much of his recent success is due to the fact that he only
invests in stocks with a history of earnings. He's attracted to
companies with a lot of cash and little debt - not the typical
thing the average technology analyst looks for.

Callahan is a former finance professor who takes a disciplined
approach to investing. He looks at earnings going back as long as
ten years and looks into the future as far as five. He then
calculates an intrinsic value for the stock based upon a custom
discount rate that is a function of bond yields and the
credit worthiness of the company.

Forbes observes:

"The Icon Information Technology Fund pays a price for
being a little more conservative than other tech funds.
In 1999 it lagged its peer group by 25 percentage points,
with a mere 111% return. It's a price worth paying".

Some names that he currently likes are: American Management
(AMSY), Applied Materials (AMAT), Computer Associates (CA),
Compurware (CPWR), Microchip Technology (MCHP), and NCR (NCR).

Compuware's chart looks especially good to me from an
intermediate to long term perspective <Editor>.

This discussion on insurance IPOs is timely. I'm reviewing my father's finances

My parents also got into good long-term-care policies years ago. However they
just got hit with a whopping big premium increase. As a new retiree myself, I
have a one-time shot at starting an ltc policy. I'm debating whether to take

Unless I misunderstood badly, my TIAA policy is guaranteed against premium

policies to those not in education. If they don't, there must be some other
company that does.

My mother dropped a policy when the premium went from an initial $2,000 a year
to something like $16,000. It would have been better to go on paying the
premium as it turned out. Her care expenses in her final years were running
close to $50,000 a year and went a long way towards totally depleting her

Net income 5,559 6,375
share outstand'g 84,619 86,206
earns per share 0.07 0.07

Revenues are growing and earnings are stable. This company
is an asynchronous transfer mode ATM enabler. Or TXCC connects wide area
network participants on company intranets
and the world wide internets. There model is sound; TXCC led by Dr. Santanu Das
achieve profitability in 1997 and has been profitable each quarter since then.
Basically, TXCC's business model is to provide ATM connects to networks and
receive payment for this product. Currently, the connection is through ATM
cards. TXCC has spearheaded industry wide conferences between suppliers and
customers in this market, so they are well connected. TXCC is not immune from
an recession in technology or the national economy but they have many current
contracts, and continue to hoard design wins to survive the storm. If you wish,
I will email you parts of my Excel workbook covering my 5 year holding of TXCC
stock. Again, based on its current earnings, future prospects, and steady
leadership -- the TXCC bonds offer good value at the current price of about 70.

Here's what they claim they will do, on the Principal web site:

"The plan details the process for converting Principal Mutual Holding Company
from a mutual insurance holding company to a stock company, including
distribution to eligible policyholders of 100 percent of the pre-IPO value of
the company."

If they really do that, it would certainly seem fair. I would assume that the
company officers themselves hold policies, and therefore have an interest in a
fair conversion. There also should be timely disclosure of an insider buying
following the IPO, which would indicate more value than was allowed for.

I think I'll go check the insider reports for some of the comanies that have
already demutualized.

A quick perusal of your Yahoo list of insurance stocks shows a great deal of
insider buying for most of them, though sometimes the amounts bought are not
very large.

With the example of many of these companies, following demutualization, it
appears that the life insurance business on average has a lot of assets that
have not been valued highly enough.

At some point there could be a series of acquisitions or mergers now that they
are stock companies, much as banks have been merging and acquiring one another.

Because I think that the general stock markets are badly overvalued, along with
the dollar itself, I am worried that the stock prices of insurance companies
might take a while to benefit from these circumstances. Having been able to buy
Royal Dutch Petroleum in 1974 at a P/E of 3 and a high yield, I know that the
best companies can be terribly undervalued in a serious market decline.
