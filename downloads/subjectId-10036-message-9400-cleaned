One last point on EBSC. After this quarter's earnings of about $.70,
book value will be about $16.00 and "net-net" $8.30. A strategic buyer could
pay double today's closing price of $5 and get the company for
"net-net" plus 22% of depreciated fixed assets.

I like this post of Jim's:

Paul,

Thanks. I was very upset that he didn't say Crimi and Buffett instead of the
other way around. Just kidding of course. :-)

The whole idea of being fully invested or not is a tough one for me. I can find
enough reasonable values right now to get fully invested. However, my general
view of the market is that it is extremely high. When overvalued markets break,
the good, the bad, and the ugly all generally get killed. So I think it is
prudent to be more cautious and have ammunition available to take advantage of
better opportunities if they present themselves.

<<What I am trying to say is that if someone invests in REITs and thinks they
are going to get more cash back than
what is stated by the dividend, that is not correct-- at least in my
experience. There's no "extra". But some of that
cash you get is usually (depending on the specific REIT) not taxable.>>

I'll second that. To make it perfectly clear, further understand that the
entire dividend is taxable, but a portion of it is taxable as capital gains
(not current income) when you sell the stock. i.e. you would reduce your basis
by that amount.

Example. You Buy REIT ABC for $20 and they pay a $2 dividend, 50 cents of which
is a return of capital. You would be taxed on $1.50 of current income. Then you
would reduce your basis by 50 cents to $19.50 and pay tax on that 50 cents when
you sell the stock at the capital gains rate.

James, your last point on EBSC is well-taken. While the numbers do speak for
themselves, traditionally, when the value is realized in one of these
"net-nets" is often uncertain. Having several activist shareholders with half
the stock (and mgmt with little), is a little extra margin of safety that EBSC
has over others on your list, or that we discuss.

It would be nice if the whole quarter's sales were up 6.5% (only November
reported so far). Then they would blow the numbers away and we would not have
to "work" real hard for our gains.

Another catalyst for EBSC would be a buyout by another department store chain.
Over the last couple of days LA Times is suggesting that the low price of
retail stocks is creating an environment where it is attractive to buy rather
than build. The EBSC territory literally surrounds the HQ of Federated.

As a TA non-believer, I would guess that BRK.b is about to break through 1700.
Is the 100's mark a barrier that the price would smash, or will it wobble down
as it has since penetrating 1800? I'm convinced that disgruntled General Re

I've never known a company to buy back shares without announcing it in advance.
There are two possible explanations for that:
1) There is an SEC rule to that effect; or
2) Managements typically want to announce the buyback to make the stock go up.

The way Buffett thinks is totally different from the way most CEOs think
regarding #2. If I were an owner, I would not want the stock to go up. I'd want
to execute the buyback at a cheaper price, THEN announce it. As this may be
considered material information, you're probably not allowed to do it that way,
but if there is no such rule, it would not surprise me at all if Buffett is
buying beneath the radar.

Wow. Now I really hope this one works!

My best info (its tough to get a retailer to talk between Thanksgiving and

November was well above expectations, so putting two and two together that
tells me they are still on track for beating estimates for the important fourth
quarter.

I'm surprised we didn't get a devil's advocate on this one. Maybe I'll have to
do it myself. Did anybody look at the composition of net working capital? Its
very different from FIT. You've got a credit sub here to keep an eye on. I've

The risk is much more likely to be in the inventory rather than the

evident and the consumers constitue a broad diversified geographically base.
The inventory could be stale and insufficently marked down or worse have a

the "artsy-knickknack" home furnishings area there was a bunch of stuff that I
remember thinking they could not give away. But it does not overly bother me at
this price level. I also agree on the receivables, absent hard times. Also, I
would guess Midwest folks might be better credit risks generally.

The stock was improving at the very end of the day, when the company can't be
in the market buying, so we may have successfully tested the $5 level again
today.

1. Let's assume that the above example is repeated year after year. After a

Yes, Archi., I'm looking at SEI also. Difficult co. for me to scope. My limited

the company took payment in terms of options or partnerships in oil/gas deals.
(I'm not sure of any of my "facts" here). In reading Yahoo thread, there seem
to be several posters' concerns.

1) I thought once a parcel of land is seismically (sic) drawn, it stays that
way and the maps aren't obsoleted. Some Yahoo posts give me the impression that
my assumption that the maps can be sold over and over is incorrect.

2.) The oil/gas E&P business is being spun off. It may or may not fetch the
price that will be attractive to SEI stock, according to some posters.

3) The people running the company are self serving. (Not unexpected if true,
given the entrepreneurial nature of the guy who started it.)

4) There's insider buying all right. Just not sure that the insiders are at
risk with the bank loans they are getting to finance those buys.

I suspect the company will come back from the $6 level. There does seem to be
some effort to try bring out value. Company has always been too expensive for
me, but now that the stock has come down to lows, I'm more interested, esp. if
it breaks below $6.

I was in the El-Bee store in the Fairfield Mall yesterday, and I have been in

crowded with people returning or exchanging gifts and shopping the sales. I
asked my mom to park at the end of the mall El-Bee is on so we could walk
through on our way in and out. The quality of the store is outstanding in every
way, as good as any department store I've seen. Beautiful decor, marble floors,
clean, shiny, nice displays. No cardboard boxes lying around, piles of junk,
etc. My mom noticed that the computer player piano they have had there in the
past was not there, one of those baby grands that plays pop tunes all by
itself. I would not say that Lazarus or Parisian, other department stores in
that mall, looked any better. Crowds were good, people at most registers,
though I could not say whether they were buying or simply exchanging. Fairfield
is the area's newest, biggest mall, so all the stores there are new and first
rate. It would not be fair to compare them to stores in older locations. Still,
my mom shops at the older, smaller Upper Valley Mall location, and says it is
fine. Bought some towels there the other day. I haven't been to the Courthouse

Thread, to bring us into the popular telecom. arena, I bring to your attention
a value stock more of the GARP class or relative value class. That stock is:
ECI Communications, ECIL

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=ecil&B1=Enter

Revs moving up every year since '93. EPS increasing too. Relatively little LTD.
In the past several years ECIL has been a consistent 20%+ ROE'r. Trailing P/E
is 27, but with forward P/E of 13.

Some negatives:

1) An Israeli stock. With all that political risk and accounting, finance,
business differences.

2) An analyst who has said the stock suffers because they have no business
presence in the US.

3) Stock has already moved up in past few sessions from 24 to about 30.

Some positives:

1.) ECIL is almost a $1B dollar (in sales) company with 4000 employees. If
there is a contingent of employees working on new technology - and with 4000
employees in a tech business, I know there is- so there is a possibility that
some successes could lead to spinoffs or subsidiaries that could catch
investors' fancy. At least one manufacturing operation is being outsourced to
SCI Systems. I conclude from this that that ECIL is focusing on its core
strength (which I assume is technology development).

2) A security/firewall corp. spinoff has been announced.

3) 30% of the company is owned by another Israeli company, KOR. KOR is
controlled by a member of the Bronfman family. The Bronfmans are well known,
successful Canadian investors. KOR purchased over 1M shares of ECIL for $37/sh
in mid '99 (I'm reporting this from memory- may have facts slightly wrong
here). ECIL buyers now ($30+ per sh) get stock cheaper than the Bronfmans' KOR
last purchase.

Seems to me ECIL offers a growing business at a reasonable price when compared
to its financials and to its peer companies. Plus there is chance for some very
good extra price appreciation if ECIL technologists or marketeers can deliver
some good products.

I'm nibbling at current price.

FWIW.

The fact that berkshire is being ignored by investors should be no surprise,

going to be a problem. Wallstreet has demonstrated an amazing capacity to suck
up capital faster than it can be fed into the market. ie the broad market is

In spite of Greenspans efforts to increase liquidity flows to the market
through daily coupon passes, it will not be enough. He will have to scale back
after the new year and even then, I dont believe that will stop the 30yr bond

RE: "The fact that the averages are being held up by a few stocks is going to

That seems to be the conventional wisdom. However, the same could have been
said a year ago and look what the market, as defined by the S&P 500 or a total
market index fund, has done since then. Many people have made much money by
merely investing in the US market as a whole.

Re: "The fact that bond yields are heading up is also going to be a problem."

Did you see the guest commentator on CNBC this morning? (Sorry, I didn't catch
his name.) He believes that the increase in interest rates is not due to
inflation concerns. Rather, it's due to the fact that people are finally
realizing that bonds have been a terrible investment for the last 100 years,
when compared to stocks. He stated that a quarter or half percent increase in
bond yields does nothing to change the relative attractiveness of stocks, which
have averaged 6% HIGHER returns for 100 years. Now, if the long term bond yield
increased to 11%, bonds might might be competitive with stock returns. ----

deja vu all over again. remember when investors ignored rising rates in 1987?

Rising rates are not just an "alternative" to stocks. This is from Buffet's
recent Fortune article that everyone has managed to ignore. <G>

To understand why that happened, we need first to look at one of the two
important variables that affect investment results: interest rates. These act
on financial valuations the way gravity acts on matter: The higher the rate,
the greater the downward pull. That's because the rates of return that
investors need from any kind of investment are directly tied to the risk-free
rate that they can earn from government securities. So if the government rate
rises, the prices of all other investments must adjust downward, to a level
that brings their expected rates of return into line. Conversely, if government
interest rates fall, the move pushes the prices of all other investments
upward. The basic proposition is this: What an investor should pay today for a
dollar to be received tomorrow can only be determined by first looking at the
risk-free interest rate.

Consequently, every time the risk-free rate moves by one basis point--by
0.01%--the value of every investment in the country changes. People can see
this easily in the case of bonds, whose value is normally affected only by
interest rates. In the case of equities or real estate or farms or whatever,
other very important variables are almost always at work, and that means the
effect of interest rate changes is usually obscured. Nonetheless, the
effect--like the invisible pull of gravity--is constantly there.

I wonder if the importance of interest rates has more to do with particular
industries and for individuals, where they are in their investing.

I'll agree that interest rates are as a gravity pull. But I also believe I see
that most people who want to invest are investing in stocks. Stocks are the
place to be. Not gold, not oil/gas partnerships, not real estate, and not
bonds. Specifically tech stocks. And the companies that many people are
investing in, are imo, mostly immune from rising interest rates. These tech
companies are cash rich. With very little ltd. Unless their customers get hurt
by rising rates (and so curtail purchases orders), I don't right now see how
many of these tech companies can be hurt if rates go up another percent.

I had to dig into Barron's to see the latest interest rates. Here's what I
found: One year changes.

Fannie Mae 30yr. fixed conventional: 8.04% now vs. 6.86% yr. ago

Merrill Lynch 5 yr. certificate 5.36% vs. 4.41%

Savings Bonds (EE) 5.1% vs. 4.6%

Prime rate (base) 8.5% vs. 7.75%

I say if you are a house buyer or house seller, you care about interest rates.

And if you are an investor in value stocks, you care about interest rates.
Because maybe you use discounted cash flow calculations or maybe because many
value stocks have debt that needs to get rolled or else because these companies
are on thin margins that really suffer when variable debt is adjusted or
customers reduce their purchases. But for tech stock investors, if they don't
succumb to the media hype about Fed tightening, they are in pretty good shape
if interest rates continue to rise. And for me, continuing with my thesis
earlier, I see interest rate increases as one more reason why there is/could be
a movement of investment funds from value stocks, from garp stocks and into
tech stocks - whether that is into conventional stuff like Sun Micro, MSFT or
into internet e-tailers or B2B or broadband stuff. When there are so many
stories of so many people making so much money in tech, right now my opinion
would be that if rates go up another percent in January, people would still be
pumping money into tech on their dips, while value stocks will drain and
arbitrage plays (with which I suffer as rates climb) will blow up.

Aside: gee, 5% on a EE Bond doesn't look too bad actually. Some fed. tax
deferral and free from state tax too? Hard for me to give up 8-13 percent in
reits for it though.

For each SVE sh. ($5.6/sh. at today's close) I expect to get (.67 x 9.25,

Theoretically, interest rates SHOULD affect tech stocks, inuts, and all the
rest. Some would say EVEN more so since without much PRESENT earnings, analysts
have to look to the "out" years for earnings.And that's where the discount rate
would effect the valuation. But I also agree with you that these, can we call
them investors?, could give a hoot. They just could care less. But I also think
that THIS can't continue for much longer. For my reasoning, check at Sam Zell's
interview in this week's Barron's. I see it is now happening in Europe and Hong
Kong and Japan. So I think to stop this speculation, rates may have to go up A

Since these earnings 'estimates' are for 10 (or more) years from now, all you

James,

Made me look - hadn't paid that much attention to decline in cash flow. I paid
more attention to debt structure and growth strategy.

As I see it, operating cash flow corresponds to growth in inventory and A/R - a
result of sales growth. Most all if the long term debt is fixed at 7.5%.

I bought a medium sized position as a long term investment. I looked at the
acquisitions and thought 'goodwill' to be reasonable - they bought some
companies with asset values greatly depreciated.

They are buying a large successful distributor that has been handling many
brands of heating and air conditioning equipment. That distributor will now
only handle Lennox brands. They needed more capacity, so they buy out a growing
small competitor and get their modern plant facilities. I consider these to be
good moves. They're gaining market share thru the acquisitions and doing well
in international expansion.

James,

IMHO there are a few things holding back BRK.

One is that General Re is having a legitimately bad year and almost all the PC
and Reinsurance stocks are taking a beating.

Second is that both the bond and equity portfolio are nowhere this year.

Third is that interest rates have moved from 5.06% to 6.45% since late last
year.

Fourth is that most of the articles I've seen don't understand how great Geico
is doing because they are focusing on GAAP earnings instead of the growth of
policies in force. Expect Warren to talk about this in the Annual Report.

Fifth is that I think some in the media are enjoying tearing him down a notch.
(jealousy)

Sixth is that there are a lot of complete idiots out there that think if you
buy a stock at 75x earnings and it goes to 100x earnings despite slowing growth
you are a genius and if you didn't you are an idiot. I can't believe that
Warren is taking heat for avoiding technology.

Seventh is tax selling.

General Re's problems are most likely cyclical and could even partly reflect
more conservative reserving. Interest rates are up so that is legitimate. The
rest is nonsense.

I still think it's a value at this price. Maybe not a screaming value but
better than most.

<<And the companies that many people are investing in, are imo, mostly immune
from rising interest rates. These tech companies are cash rich. With very
little ltd. Unless their customers get hurt by rising rates (and so curtail
purchases orders), I don't right now see how many of these tech companies can
be hurt if rates go up another percent.>>

In terms of finance, the exact opposite would seem to be true. Value stocks
(except those whose business is directly effected by rising interest rates,
like homebuilders for example), should be the LEAST effected by rising interest
rates. Here is why. Let's discount two streams of cash flows, one for a low-P/E
stock, and one for an internet company.

Low P/E: 10, 10, 10, 10, 100
High P/E: (40), 0, 0, 0, 220

With a discount rate of 10%, these two earnings streams are worth the same,
$100.

Now let's play with the discount rate. If we move it up to 12% (interest rates
rise 200 bp), then the low-P/E stock's value falls 7% and the high P/E
valuation falls by 11%.

I believe it is a myth that utilities and other dividend plays are "interest
rate sensitive" except in the sense that any financial asset is interest rate
sensitive. The concept of long and short duration in bonds should tell one that
these are far less interest rate sensitive than a high multiple stock.

Its not the effect interest rates have on the business - its the effect they
have on the valuation.

re: "Its not the effect interest rates have on the business - its the effect

I hadn't thought of it that quite that way. For a lot of the businesses I own
by holding their stocks, - reits, banks, insurance, homebuilders, auto
suppliers, distributors, - if the business itself isn't hurt with rising rates
(and thus the stocks, I assume), the stocks themselves will be hurt through the
general perception that rising rates are bad. So, while agreeing with you about
'dividend payers and utilities' I'll use an example of banks. Banks may well be
anticipating and hedging an interest rate rise (so that their earnings won't be
hurt), yet every time there is a rate rise, market commentators reinforce the
presumed association (interest rates are bad for banks), flash bank stock
prices on the tv screen, and generally let people know they better get out of
bank stocks. And bank stocks decline.

"Let's discount two streams of cash flows, one for a low-P/E stock, and one for
an internet company." Okay, I see it by the numbers, but why discount cash
flows for an internet company? I tried to search through SI to see just how
many times I could come up with people posting that they've done a discounted
cash flow analysis. I saw nothing. (Could be my laziness or incorrect
searching.) And why go out five years? I mean who's going to buy one of these
companies now figuring to hold on for five years? (Unless of course, if
somebody figures they go up 5x every year, hold for 4 years and get out a
millionaire.)

I have an excellent dentist. He's not a stock market expert, but he assures me
I should buy Cisco; it's a fabulous company with a great future, and the stock
goes up every year. Maybe it's an internet company, maybe not. But there's no
cash flow analysis necessary by his reasoning (and by mine too -g-) And the
hold period is (I guess) until the stock no longer goes up or his patients or
patience say switch to RedHat or whatever. He might be worried about interest
rates - because his business will be affected if we go into a recession, but
he's not worried about Cisco, its business or its stock price. Unlike me, who
is worried about rates affecting inventory carrying charges for distributors,
car sales for parts suppliers,banks, debt for reits, and everything else that
these value stocks of mine are subject to with interest rate increases.

So I see your point, but it just doesn't seem to apply to what I see around me.

Tech stocks will start to crash when the marginal buyer decides to get out.
I'll tell you a little bit about that marginal buyer. He is an institutional
value investor who feels he has to be in the big tech names or "risk
underperforming", though he knows full well the risk he is taking. And he is
telling his clients he is taking little risk in an overvalued market.

Then the next group of investors will sell. These are the guys who will sell
when price momentum slows down a little bit (i.e. they only go up 2% in a
week).

With that many sellers, now the prices start to fall, which is the signal for a
whole bunch of other holders to sell. These are the guys who, when they want to
sell, they dump regardless of price. At this point, we are down about 15% in
the Nasdaq index (read: the price two weeks ago, and a panic ensues when the
individual investors start to say "This isn't fun anymore."

This could happen over three months or it could happen over three hours. But
what I am not going to do is let the behavior of these "investors" affect my
analysis. If they're gonna buy Cisco regardless of price, let them buy Cisco
regardless of price. The point of my previous post is that rising interest
rates lower Cisco's intrinsic value. Paul points out that that may not change
what some idiot is going to pay at the peak, but it will reduce the level where
true investors step in to buy the stock when it crashes. Real investors (i.e.
those who care about the price they pay) have no role in deciding where a stock
(or a market) tops, but they sure do have a role in deciding where it bottoms.

The Nasdaq 100 index of the biggest 100 Nasdaq stocks traded at 120 in October,
and that was hardly a panic. I considered it significantly overvalued then. Now
it trades at 180. How hard is it to take an index down to the level it traded
at less than three months ago? That would be a 33% "correction" in the Nasdaq.
CNBC doesn't call that a correction, they call that a bear market. I call that
what I'd call 100 lawyers chained to the bottom of the ocean with the fish. A
nice start. And if anyone on the thread takes offense to that metaphor, I
apologize to fish everywhere.

This should be fun to watch when it happens.

Invests for total return by holding a large portfolio of equities. Earnings

I don't have a complete answer for you, but I can offer a couple of ideas.
Their business model hasn't remained constant.

They've been transitioning from being just a capital goods supplier to also
owning the downstream retail channel. The latter is being accomplished by
buying up the mom and pop heating/a.c shops around the country. As a result of
this growth, their inventory and A/R have been growing, so that eats into their
cash flow from operations.

I don't know if that fully explains what you've observed, but I assume it must
be a big part of the answer. I suppose it is also possible that there is some
kind of disguised deterioration in the underlying capital goods business, as
there has been in the retail chain that they are acquiring, although in reading
the latest 424B3 prospectus I didn't notice any indication of such a thing.

I am mindful that the unusual scheme for growing the business probably provides
the company various opportunities to be creative with the financial reporting.
I have no way of knowing whether they are doing that, but just to be safe, in
buying the stock I didn't give much weight to the earnings numbers or the p/e.

If you have other thoughts on this, I'd like to hear them.

But the balance sheet looks scary to me, especially considering the addition of

Jim, as I posted on YAHOO, I do not regard that new filing as "news".
Mr. Bennett's intentions were disclosed in his October 15 filing, and

Mr. River's question on inventory is interesting. Over the holidays
I spent some time with a friend who knows retail a lot better than I do. He
said that companies who properly account for inventory will, for example, mark
the Spring clothing that is leftover down to next to nothing after the season
and Spring clearance sales are over. This avoids buildup of inventory valuation
on goods with essentially no value. With department stores moving ever more
toward soft goods from the old hard goods days, this is important to be sure
EBSC does this.

I could not answer my friends question about inventory valuation policy and the
10K paragraph on it is not detailed:

"Merchandise Inventories -- Retail inventory is determined principally by
the retail method applied on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis and is
stated at the lower of cost or market. If the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
basis had been used, inventories would be higher by $886 at January 30,
1999 and $6,657 at January 31, 1998. The decrease in the LIFO reserve in
fiscal 1998 occurred in the fourth quarter ended January 30, 1999, as a
result of increased inventory levels primarily due to the acquisition of
Stone & Thomas."

I'm considering buying Qualcom today at 661 for target price of 1000.

That's a 51% expected gain for a 12 month target. It seems easily achievable,
especially as we're seeing the strong momentum and sharp runs with it in the
media. It's a gorilla with a bulletproof lock on technology that will impact
many people's lives (or so I read). It's a word - qualcom - that's entering our
daily financial lives (much as we try to ignore it)

Problem is that I see World Fuel Services Corp. (INT) coming on strong to
challenge QCOM.

INT "markets aviation and marine fuel services, and recycles used oil." The
stock is down for a number of reasons: 1)a customer defaulted on the money INT
fronted them to buy INT's aviation fuel (loaning the customer money, and
occasionally getting stung is "normal" (my opinion) in this business), 2) they
made an acquisition and are having some trouble digesting it (a heck of a lot
of fuel was stolen out of Nigeria). So of course, the stock is bouncing around
its yearly lows.

At some point (assuming people still travel by plane and aren't all just
talking on their ASICs cell phones), it's reasonable, imo, to assume that INT
will overcome its current problems, maybe not face such difficult new problems
and as result-- return to earning 15% or more on its stated equity ($8.3/sh)
and again (as it has in almost all past 5 years) trade at 1.5 times stated
book, and at a price above $11 /sh. That's a 52% gain (which could be achieved
in 12 months)from the approx. $7 1/4 sh. price. Which beats qualcom.

I just have to go with INT. Don't really like being in the crowd on this one,
but I'll go with what I assume everybody is saying, which is... INT will beat
QCOM.

There is a certain fallacy in the argument you are making. you are assuming
that that if long term interest rates changes today they will remain at that
level for the infinite life of the cash flows but that is not true either.
Investor expectation may well assume a different long term interest rate for
the cash flow life of their investment that exists today, and it may be change
at a much slower rate than a change in interest rates today. For example
although the 30 year bond is now say 7.5%, the investor may already be assuming
a long term discount rate of 8.25% and only if the bond goes way out of whack
is it likely that panic will ensue, or that investors will switch portfolio
allocations. big way. The exceptions being homebuilders, financials and
insurance companies, which are more sensitive to immediate rate changes. I am
also hypothesizing that investors in high growth vs. low growth investments may
even have different assumed long term discount rates and I would surmise that
the high growth investor has a much higher assumed discount rate because of the
greater risk of the cash flow assumptions. So that a reit investor may be using
discount rate of 8% but the high growth investor is using a discount rate of
12-15%.

Armin: QCOM vs. INT

You have a point about the tax efficiency of holding a growth stock (QCOM) vs.
having to sell a value stock (like INT). Talking about a 20 or more year period
for comparing investments though is too much of a stretch for me. Firstly, I
have trouble visualizing that QCOM or its ilk will be around that long. And
secondly, I have trouble believing today's investors are long enough long term
holders to stick with such companies.

I've gone back to my Dreman references, but I can't find what I'm looking for,
which is a Forbes' article where Mr. Dreman talks about the performance of high
pe stocks. You know it's one of his top/bottom quintile-kinda comparisons, but
his point is (I believe) that yes, there are companies that will increase
earnings year after year, they are growth companies certainly, but... in
looking at these companies over time, their stock market performance does not
continue to increase. At some point (3 years from peak eps?? I need article for
backup) with these high pe stocks, the stock performance decreases, regresses
even as the company earnings keep increasing.

Now maybe with a monopoly things are different. But I don't know that qcom is a
monopoly. Sure "they" say it is, but I don't know. Of course, I also don't know
that much about INT either, but I'd rather assume it is what it appears to be,
and not assume about qcom that "they" are right about its monopoly position or
future prospects.

Looking back this year, I believe there were times a couple of these
high-flyers could've been considered value plays. For Yahoo, that was when it
was selected for the S&P 500. As was posted here by somebody, that selection
materially increased the immediate demand by funds for that stock regardless of
Yahoo's price. Anyone realizing this could've made a "value" play imo. And for
qcom, the inflection point was when Nokia gave into qcom on the standards
brouhaha. Qcom's franchise value then materially increased. (It didn't increase
before the capitulation, imo, because it was not at all certain or clear when
or if qcom would prevail.) But now, as we both agree, it's too late to buy
qcom. You've chosen VARL; I picked INT.

If it's now a comparison between INT and VARL, then based on your superlative
record (every stock you've mentioned here seems to me to have performed Very
Well after your call) vs. my uh, not-so- superlative value picks, then I will
also look at VARL.

it is not a comparison between INt and VARL Paul, I do not know INT at all, and
I am in VARL at lower levels, but I do believe that conceptually it is
important to distinguish between companies that have high growth rates and
between monopolistic companies with high growth rates. Qualcomm I believe is
such a company. I am not willing to pay the premium for it though, and I am
willing to take my chances that VARL will hold its own for awhile and it is a
much much lower market cap. While I thank you for the superlatives I do not
believe they are warranted. Few of the ideas that I discuss here are of my own
discovery. I am fortunate to be able to mine the wealth of ideas contained on
this thread and on many others. I do think that the buy and hold tax advantage
is one that is frequently ignored by the value camp, but Warren Buffet has
really based his fortune on his ability to purchase companies that have been
able to grow for decades and contain properties that make them monopolistic
such as the Washington Post and Coke. That is really his genius that is
difficult to duplicate. Happy New year to one and all.

<<You have a point about the tax efficiency of holding a growth stock (QCOM)
vs. having to sell a value stock (like INT).>>

If you're just focused on taxes, by all means buy Qualcomm. Nothing like a nice
75% capital loss to offset gains in your value stocks.

I'm convinced that BRK will merge them out this year.

LauA: WSC. others. Yes, I looked at WSC a couple of days ago after I saw it
written up in Dick Davis Digest. According to W. Baxter of World Economic
Service, the intrinsic value of Wesco is $295/sh (vs. today's $245/sh close).
Mr. Baxter "wouldn't be surprised" to see WSC bought out upon Charlie Munger
retiring and he is "nearing retirement age". I passed on WSC-- I've got more
than enough insurance stocks right now, some of which I believe to be better
values than WSC. (IPCR comes to mind)

Also in that same issue, BRKB itself was recommended. And First Data (FDC)
which was spun off from Am. Express and about which "it was recently disclosed
that Berkshire Hathaway brought 5%... over the last year". FDC looks to me like
an excellent long term growth prospect. But share price too high for me now.

LauA: Also thanks for posting here. I was able to catch your net-net GAI when
you posted on it in early Nov., and I'm taking some profits on it today (56%
gain!). IMO congratulations are due you. To me, these net-nets -- even ones
like GAI selling after all debt is out and still below cash - they are not so
easy or simple layups. I'm taking some profits this week in TCSI and some
"profits" in DAIO ("profits" in quotes since I don't really consider 1/8 of a
point on DAIO bought @ 2.5 eleven months ago a "real" profit). These are
net-net stocks bought also at below their cash-in-hand, but they burned through
much of it in a quest to develop new products. And now their stock price is
much dependent on the success of those products.

Sorry I was not quick or astute enough to get LR. I missed it after its quick
rise from your post at under 3 up to about 5, and yet again I didn't buy when
it dropped back to under 3. It's close to 4 again. I hate it when the same
stock keeps tantalizing me that way -g-.

Anyway, thanks, congratulations on some good work, and Happy New Year!

James, thank you for mentioning Blair (BL) as a net/net, because you caused me
to look at it more closely. Here are the numbers I found: market
cap=102,625,000 ; current assets=272,188,000 ; all liabilities=102,591,000 ;
net working capital=169,597,000 (60% of market cap). Is that about what you

been buying back shares for years. What's not to like?

I just spent a lot of time looking at Blair.

The financial values are obvious. The disadvantages are less obvious:

1. Their (catalog) appeal (according to 10K) is to lower-middle income folks,
who tend to be older. A lot of their assets are in receivables that might be of
questionable quality in the next recession, as would be the outlook for their
catalog response rates at that time. Their product is mostly clothing and their
client base will just tend to make do with what they have in a recession.

2. The stock has been in a downtrend since 1993, which tends to confirm my
fundamental point of view, and institutions hold a lot and have been sellers.

3. They are about to embark on spending a bunch of money on developing an
Internet presence thru IBM. For those who hold the stock,
publicity surrounding this is probably the catalyst to get you out with a good
return. However, their client base is probably the last people to use a
computer for shopping.

4. Lastly, a personal observation, my wife is my consumer products consultant
for these kinds of things. She does not have a clue about the stock market, but
her judgment is excellent on this kind of stuff,
and I am usually wrong when I go against her. Anyway, she gets literally pounds
of catalogs per week. (I know since they end up in recycling and I tie them up
and lug them out <ggg>.) She knew Blair right away and said they are junky and
she throws them right out without reading - which says something about the
company that she still gets them, never ordering anything.

I don't think anyone will get hurt buying at $14 and some Internet press in
2000 might boost the stock. However, my considered opinion is that the basic
business is not very attractive and not likely to change for the better.

Based on the financials of EBSC, your comments on their stores, and the active
new controlling shareholders as a catalyst, I much prefer that one (except for
the debt level). Roughly speaking, I think both
are selling at similar levels versus asset values at current prices and have
the potential to earn about $2 per share, which would do a lot more for EBSC
price than for BL. (Federated earns about 17% on tangible book value, which
would be way over $2 on EBSC book, but perhaps requiring different management.)

Yep. I'd add a few bucks a share to the net-net valuation of Blair to reflect
real estate that they own free and clear. And to kind of address Jeff's
concerns, which are on the mark, yes they sell cheapo stuff and probably make a
lot of their income through ripoff customer financing schemes.

In that way it looks a lot like Fingerhut did two or three years ago at about
$13 a share I believe. Same exact business, same reputation. Fingerhut at the
time owned shares in another company that were worth more than its market cap.
I looked at that one very carefully, then never took the bat off my shoulder
because the business looked yucky. That was the bottom, and I think the stock
tripled.

Jim, one point I forgot on BL. It seems thay cut their provision for doubtful
accounts by 12% as a percent of sales this year (to boost earnings?). I don't
like things like that, but forgot to try to quantify it.

Am I correct that you do not like EBSC "much better" than BL as I do? I must
admit I was surprised at the persistence of the yearend selling of EBSC, and
would have expected the company (if not the large holders) to be more
aggressive buyers at this level.

Jim (or others), would you have an updated opinion on UCR?

I'm considering it once again.

New management.
Some indication steel industry is recovering.
Because they sell necessary consumables to mini-mills and Mr. Buffett added (in
1988 apparently)to his Nucor position (Nucor being the mini-mill leader), then
perhaps UCR has a good chance also of moving up from its lows and prospering as
NUE prospers. (I'm assuming UCR sells and profitably to NUE.)

I agree that Blair's products are unappealing. I saw one of their catalogs and
it looked like polyester pants suits for blue-haired old ladies. Same crap as
Fingerhut (and who ever thought of that name? Makes me picture a finger and a
little hut....). But since I am doing quantitative as opposed to qualitative
analysis, I try not be put off by a boring, unsexy line of business. Since we
are all intelligent, tasteful folks (aren't we?), it's easy to forget that what
we hate, other people may like, and their money is good too. Unless that
recession you mentioned hits, then that would be ugly for a lot of companies. I
vaguely remember what a recession is like.... I guess I'll keep an eye on this
one. Thank you for your excellent comments.

Robert, I did not mean to discourage you from buying Blair. I think the stock
will probably work out fine, inspired by some possibly misleading publicity on
their Internet activity in 2000.

For me, I try to make a point of differentiating between a cheap stock
whose business is not particularly likely to change for the better and a cheap
stock where there is a reasonable chance that the business could improve. That
is one kind of margin of safety (over and above the pure numbers) I try to find
in such an investment. As noted above, the Internet factor could contribute to
a perception that BL business will change for the better - which is often just
as good as reality, even if false.

I have always liked UCR's business. I don't like the balance sheet post

think steel is the place to be, buy BS - perhaps the most leveraged steel

don't). A less aggressive play might be AKS.

Happy Y2K all!!
I do like EBSC, but would question what the catalyst would be to get it off its
butt.
Management doesn't seem all that eager to do too much; how about the big
holders, such as Bennett? An assault on management by the big holders would
appear to me to be the most likely catalyst for a higher price.
Comments?

On EBSC, I would think the catalyst would be better than expected current
quarter earnings, "or else" - the large holders effecting change, either in
mgmt of sale of the company. Since they own half the stock, and mgmt owns
little, a sale could be effected with or without management involvement.

That said, I find today's action disappointing. I was looking for action more
like that other value stock I have mentioned here in the past (SEMI) has shown
today.

Here are some statistics I gathered off the insidertrader.com screens
on FD and EBSC, which is in its backyard:

P/Sales-0.6/0.1
P/E-14.6/3.5 (based on ttm earnings for EBSC of $1.48, which disagrees with
Yahoo)
P/EBITDA-4.6/1.7
P/Free Cash Flow-13.8/--
P/Tangible Book-2.4/0.3
P/Cash-17.8/7.7
Debt/Equity-0.8/0.8
Current Ratio-1.6/4.2
ROE-13.0%/10.2%

It seems pretty obvious to me that Federated or anyone else could pay double
the current price and still have a bargain.

I expected EBSC to do well moving into January too, but I still am optimistic
here. It is rare you find a valuation like this with any positive catalysts at
all. Here we have one with both a likely positive surprise for the Christmas
quarter, and large aggressive shareholders with the power to make something
happen.

Blair showed several more insider buys at the end of December. That makes
eleven separate insider buys since November 1 with no sells.

The Abby Cohen Update

I just wanted to give everyone the "Abby Update".

In this week's Barron's Abby Joseph Cohen is quoted as saying that stocks are
roughly fairly valued right now and should climb in line with profit growth.
She says they were undervalued going into last year.

Gee, isn't that exactly what she said at the end of 1996, 97, and 98?

In fact, I clearly remember her saying at the end of 1996 that stocks did so
well that year because they were undervalued at the end of 1995, but they were
fairly valued at the end of 1996.

So let's see.

End of 1996

S&P500 - 740.74
Reported Earnings - 38.73
Operating Earnings - 40.63
30 Year Treasury - 6.55%

Current

S&P500 - 1450
Reported Earnings - 43.96
Operating Earnings - 49.38
30 Year Treasury - 6.59%

Does anyone see something I don't see?

On EBSC, per my post on Yahoo, who is still selling, after yearend, and why? I
can figure no logical explanation as the company could and would have taken any
quantity in a block before yearend under the existing buyback authorization -
which has 3 million shares to go at the current price level.

On the Blair insider buying, it is somewhat puzzling that they are all
relatively small amounts - almost as if the Chairman told the boys to go buy
some (like Polaroid did a while back).

Wayne - BRK: One other concern may be weighing on this -
Gieco Vs the Net: Presently Gieco is taking share from tradtional insurance
players like Allstate by selling direct using advertising and call centers
instead of direct sales force, thus have lower selling cost - a big contributor
to 10% cost advantage they enjoy. It's not difficult to envision a future, 2 -
5 years from now, when most consumer insurance is sold on the Net with sales
intermediated by insuremarket type web sites. Auto insurance policies are
pretty standardized commodities that lend themselves to this. While I would
expect traditional players to be slow to change, once they see the handwriting
on the wall there's going to be a rush to this model to try to get a lead and
perhaps prevent commoditization thru web site intermediaries. This could result
in Gieco being on the wrong side of commoditization and lower cost competitors
unless they move to lead the move to the Net. WEB isn't exactly known for his
fondness of new technology and this could be viewed as slowing progress toward
direct marketing on the net.
The market is looking at potential downside of net impacts on traditional
business models and the above might partially account for some of BRK's recent
disfavor.

Bob,

I've been contemplating the same issue. I have no conclusions.

I just upped my position in Mecury General (MCY) and they use independent
agents so it may be a bigger factor for them.

I'm not certain how much you actually save via internet though. You still have
to advertise/spend money to get business or links to your page. I wish I could
find some numbers.

One part of the equation (at least in MCY's case) is that agents can act like a
front line underwriting process and increase the quality of the business.

If you gain any insights let me know.
