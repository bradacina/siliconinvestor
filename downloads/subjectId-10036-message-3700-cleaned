First from the release:
Day rates for all the Company's offshore vessels, both domestic and
international,
continue to show firmness, which indicates an improving performance in the
quarters
ahead as the Company continues the process of integrating new vessels into its
fleet.

The Company's other business segments - offshore & harbor towing, chemical
transportation and petroleum product transportation -- are meanwhile performing
satisfactorily.

Well since dayrates seem to be strong there goes one problem.
Secondly there has been concern about a dropping of day rates in the gulf with
all the new boats coming online. Since HMAR has 67 boats in the gulf and 117
internationally they would be hit somewhat less than TMAR or TDW in this
respect. These declines would hopefully be offset by a continued increase in
international day rates. Also there is more to HMAR than just oil service
vessels. Their consolidation and leadership in chemical transportaion and
harbor tug service are also interesting in a longer term setting. And finally
here is a link that will put you to sleep but will give you more insight into
this comapny than I could.

Ron,
I am new here but let me render an opinion on TSEMF using what
I call inversion theory. TSEMF at 81% of book, with lots of cash, and
little or no debt is a great value. However, these conditions will not
necessarily lead to immediate profits. If you buy now you must endure
significant operating losses and massive restructuring. I would think
that this stock will drop into the 38-50% of book range( perhaps it will
turn earlier) but ,I would put this one on my radar screen, verify all
essential data and wait for that buying range.
Note: when the time comes, the negative news background will
make it really difficult to buy. But that's where a systems approach
is needed.

Kent & Count,

I posted (#3676) that I bailed out of TSEMF the morning they reported an
expected loss. Took my beating and ran. Good thing as it's far below where I
sold.

I have not owned a tech stock for over a year until I erred in buying TSEMF
based on financials and supposedly good management. It will likely be longer
than a year before I look at another one -g-.

Bill, the best source I know of Is Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis. But be
forewarned, there are no easy roads to deciding what numbers or ratios are good
or bad. As a financial analyst I look for trends, and I always try to find out
if the ratios make sense in the context of the business. For example,
ordinarily you might think that the higher the current ratio (current
assets/current liabilities) the better. But too high a number implies
inefficient use of resources. That's the same kind of thing with days in
inventory (Inventory/(COGS*days in the period)). Too high a number may mean a
lot of "dead" inventory and high inventory costs. Too low a number may mean
that the company is losing sales because it is running out of good.

Hope this helps,

there's a book that can discourage you from investing in stocks in the late

read Graham's Intelligent Investor, I presume.
You raise a good question about determining financial ratios and their

Hi Ron: re WBB, others. WBB said it was potentially in receipt of an offer for
it in low 30 range. The deal fell through, although sometimes the players do
get back together or another party comes in. However, I figured that at about
30-31, IF it happened, it would be about 32-34 at best, and maybe at the 30-31
level as first announced. If no offer, I thought a good likelihood that stock
could drift down into the 20's. So I thought it best to take some money off the
table, and I sold half my position.
When buying these value stocks it's always (IMO) easier to make the buy
decision because that's a value/numbers statement. Although there are some
people here who apparently use (or recommend that others use -g-) present value
calculations and who might suggest that the sell decision is consequently a
numbers decision (also), my opinion is that it is a much more judgmental issue.

I am finding this weekend about the same numbers as you reported last week. I
looked at about 125 companies, found about 7 potential value stocks, one
relative div. play, one misc., and one Japanese growth co. Of the 7 value
stocks, I have an order in on 1 (a microcap, under $2/sh) which I will post on
if I can get a fill), and will watch the others for now. Of these 7 value
stocks, 2 were mentioned on this thread -EMITF (#3333) and REMI.
In addition, I am looking to increase my position in EX, a company I've
mentioned here too. A company with many problems and a terrible reputation in
several areas (just small things like management and quality -g-). However, the
business is (or should be -g-) okay, and as price comes down to near book
value, I'm more interested again. Paul

Ron, I just bought tech stocks, ironically.

I bought Broadway & Seymour (BSIS, 500 shares at 7 3/4), Applix
APLX(600 @5 5/8) and MapInfo (MAPS, 300 @ 11 5/8). I did this
this past Friday. They are all small software stocks with loads
of cash, near historic ratio lows and ratios well below their industry
norms. If you add them up, they amount to one full position in
my Lancelot portfolio. Though I would normally take a larger
position in one stock, like BSIS, and I know three does not
diversification make, I am taking small positions as a possible
prelude to larger positions. IMO, small software stocks are
in their own severe bear market now.

BTW, Microsoft Investor has an awesome screening tool, and it's

it's a great investor asset.

Ron,
I'm glad you took the hit early TSEMF; it is so easy to jump on these value
stocks too early. Once they drop below book ( what I call the inversion point)
it is as if the ship has capsized. It can take even the best of managements a
long time to get things straightened out. Taking losses to me is a good sign
that they realize that they must trade at a premium to book in order to avoid
liquidation.
There will be a time to buy TSEMF, and it will probably get very cheap. Do you
have any others trading at a significant discount to book and with debt to
equity under 30%? I had AWII but they are being acquired and I need a new
parking place.

Interesting, I live near Albany, N.Y. where Map Info is located. Remember the

everybody was singing praises of the company at the annual, then they shortly
thereafter had a fairly disastrous Q which decimated the stock.
I've been monitoring the stock, but I'm just curious why you like it/what

This response is to the frequent mention of book value. I had book value in my
model but took it out. I may need to know more about the effect of BV on a
stocks price. IMO, with the exception of banks, BV will only be used if a
company were liquidated. I see you use it as a bench mark. I don't understand

ALI,
I can appreciate where you are coming from, almost every text
out there will go to great lengths to downplay bookvalue claiming it
is obsolete or misstated. Yet in the next chapter they key in on return
on equity , which uses book value in the denominator.
I think the big problem is that most folks don't understand what happens
above and below book value. To me the price of the stock relative
to book determines the proper financial strategy for the firm. You are
correct, I use book to measure ( like a yard stick) or benchmark value.
My original work on the subject started in the early 1980's when I
owned lots of shares (for me at least) of Mattel ( the toy Maker). They
were in big trouble when their intellivision product became obsolete.
I proceeded to write a letter to the board of directors suggesting that
they buy back some shares- in the letter I made a bold statement which
went like this, " Earnings vary as a function of stock price rather stock
price varring as a function of earnings". I got a very interesting reaction-
they called me up and said the board had talked about this particular
statement for several hours. The financial VP suggested that this was
something that I should research further. Shortly, thereafter Mattel
took a $800 million write- down and struck an equity deal with a firm
I have since forgotten. As a result They survived.
That event started my work/research into book value and it's
relationship to corporate financial strategy. If you know the Price to Book
ratio, you can pretty much figure out ( at least conceptually) what is
happening
in the board room. As far as I am concerned , this is the most important
financial ratio that exists.

" Earnings vary as a function of stock price rather stock
price varring as a function of earnings".

Yes, I use PE and EP in my formula. Also, PSR, profit/sales ratio, free cash
flow, price/cashflow ratio.
There has been discussions on cash flow. Mine is as follows:
Cashflow = net income plus depreciation and amoritization
Free cashflow = cashflow less dividends and capitalization

Actually, I use the numbers right off Valueline. Well a picture is worth more
than me trying to explain.
INPUT
PRICE 10.00
SALES PER SHARE 15.00
CASH FLOW 0.80
EA. PER SHARE 0.20
DIVIDEND 0.00
CAPITAL SPENDING 0.70
BOOK 1.95

PR/BOOK REF ONLY 5.13

That's what I input. The fomula does the ratios above etc.

For the heck of it, give me your thoughts on this one. Overvalued ? Under ? I
don't get Valueline so I have to run to the library. I haven't learned how to
get 'capital spending' and the cashflow I use from the Hoover etc yet.

ac,
This is a high growth stock with a price to book of 5. In my approach
I very simply avoid this type of stock- here is the reason:
The market is paying a huge premium for growth and management must
deliver with new produces and higher sales. One bad quarter and the price
goes in the tank, the risk is too high for me. Speaking of risk, I note that
there is no entry for capital structure ( debt ratio) built into the input
figures
My theory is that not many leaders can deliver growth for an extended
period of time. Eventually the produce line and market matures causing
the growth rate to waver. I thus prefer the situation where the revenues
are mature and the path to profitability is through the reduction of costs.
It is much easier to redeploy assets and cut costs, than it is to increase
the revenue side of the equation.
Let me clarify here, I am not saying that the price of this stock will not
rise or that one cann't make money here. I am saying that the volatility
and downside potential are something that I like to avoid. I have seen too
many of these types of stocks drops to the $.88 range when things turn
sour.
Let me guess, the news background is great- The company is rolling
out one great produce after another; Everyone is saying Buy, Buy, Buy!
Management is enjoying great success, everything they touch turns out to
be a winner.
I prefer something in the .5 times book range, where everyone hates it.
I think JBM was down there not long ago.
Hope this helps a little.

My model says it should be a $5 or $6 stock. Price to book is then 2.56. To get
to .5 the price would be $1. Based on my non-scientific formula that is. I will
pay more mind to book. Of course, if i find an undervalued one, I look in the
fundamentals etc for the reason.

Two examples of undervalued stocks that this formula noticed some time ago,
were Nortek and Fieldcrest. Nortek had about $9 cash per share and I think was
at 11. Fieldcrest was down waiting to see where cotton would end up.

TSEMF - Make a mistake, get rid of it and put the money into something better.
The earnings pre-announcement surprised me as I thought they would do better,
but I wasn't about to hang around and find out. Took the $500+ beating and got
outta there. Could have been much, much more the way it worked out.

I'm not finding much I like in the way of new. I just doubled position on HIHOF
and have a buy order in on more DSWLF. Seem the ones I own are better than the
ones I find.

HIHOF is selling near BV at +/-$4.375 and will earn near $1.00 this year. The
BV is greatly understated to actual value.

Anyone on the thread that doesn't own DSWLF isn't paying attention or doesn't
like 'F' stocks.

I research every stock posted on this thread by the long time members. Don't
always agree with them because I have different criteria and motives and often
find it to be a mistake. I bought WBB when Paul recommended and sold WAY too
early. Didn't see what he saw.

Ali, I've been wrestling with the problem for some time. I think there is a
good analogy to be made here to the leasing business. Suppose you lease an
asset to another individual, and you want to sell that lease to a third party.
What is the lease worth? Answer:

Case 1: if bankruptcy is not an issue it is the capitalized stream of payments
called for under the lease.

Case 2: if bankruptcy is a potential issue, it is the sum of the capitalized
lease payments likely to be received plus the liquidation value of the asset.

Now here's the point. In neither case is the historic or carrying value of the
asset an issue. It is irrelevant.

I believe that it's exactly the same in a company. What I care about most are
the capitalized value of future free cash flows. But if the value of those cash
flows is exceeded by the value of the assets that generated them I suspect that
such a business is ripe for liquidation.

Paul

You may be right. When I read the documents available three weeks ago, I did
not feel I could understand the risks in foreign real estate and the financial
structure. Speaking for myself, I put some time into this one and rejected it.
If you want to convince me, you've got to tell me what I'm missing - not just
tell me to read another 10-K. (and that probably goes for the others on this
thread). Given the foreign real estate, I, speaking for myself, would probably
need a 50% margin of safety to invest. Does it qualify under that parameter.
This has got to be an asset play, right?

You have enough conviction to keep pursuing me on this one (and of course
invest your own hard earned money in it), and that alone tells me something.
Tell us why. This stock has every characteristic of a value investment - it is
difficult to analyze and looks risky on the surface, though it may not be in
reality. If you can cut through the garbage and tell us why you have such
conviction in this stock, you might get me to do a little more homework.

Book value is obsolete. Yeah, and 23 times earnings is normal. If your
back-testing goes back more than five years, I think you will find (I know my
firm did) that low price/book is not a screen you want to ignore.

With a big caveat. You've got to look at the balance sheet and the historical
writeoff history and make some intelligent conclusions about what that book
value is. Book value does not equal value. But it is a very productive first
step. Just my opinion, but some of my best investments have been stocks trading
below book value.

James,

You have proven that one must look at BV in initial screening of stocks. It can
often find a stock beaten down for the wrong reasons. BV alone can, at times,
find very good buys.

My example: company bought out a company that went bankrupt. Wrote off the
costs to move the equipment to a factory with lower labor costs plus they had
much higher costs due to the R&D and marketing without offsetting revs. Caused
two Qs of losses and the stock fell below the understated BV due to a high PE
on trailing quarters. But- forward PE was under 4. Stock screening doesn't find
companies like this and these are the ones we're trying to find.

What found St. Joe & WHX? Wasn't the PE.

a low price book screen because the valuable assets were on the balance sheet

You seem to place emphasis on book value in your fair value assessment. How do
you determine whether a company's assets are being carried on their books at

Some of these value picks could do very well, but they are just too tough for

such individual stocks. To get me interested anyway, I, too, have got to be

To All,

I am so glad you guys have an appreciation of book value, it is sure nice to be
in friendly territory for a change.
My criteria is pretty simple but my supporting calculations are
fairly complex. I start the screening process by looking for something trading
at around .5 times book; from here I pretty much look for low debt situations
usually under 25% debt to equity. Then you have to dig in and check out the 10K
and annual report to see if the management is doing the right things and find
those hidden debts( leased stores, etc.)
I am less concerned about the market value of the assets. But;some liquidity is
good and I figure goodwill will be the first thing to be written off.
Let me put two stocks I currently own up for your analysis- First is the much
hated PARL- About .5 times book and no debt, it is currently buying back shares
and taking losses on its losing product lines.
Second is HOLO- A $3 dollar stock trading at 30% of book, it has some cash and
little or no debt. However I don't think management has
a real good grasp on what needs to happen.
Be glad to share my equations in some later post.
Ron, your analysis of these stocks will be much appreciated. I got in low and
am waiting for a jump into profitability. I realize these are

Kent,

IMO - Companies with a history of making money (and I mean cash) will continue
to make money. Companies that have a history of losing will continue to lose.
It's a matter of good management that will increase shareholder value - this is
not the price of the stock, but the value of the company. I don't think the
ones you listed fall into that category.

I look for the companies the market has dumped for the 'wrong' reasons. e.g.
MAX (one of Richard's) had a customer declare bankruptcy. They wrote off the
receivable because of it and it resulted in a large loss. The bottom fell out
of the price. 1)They will recover most of the write-off, 2) they are generating
$2.5M per Q and growing fast. I bought at 6.50 and sold 1/2 at 8.50. (thank you
RB) It has fallen back and I placed a buy order this morning. I feel it to be
an excellent small position long term hold.

IMO - a low P/BV may be an indicator of a good buy, but it may also indicate a
company that's actually in trouble. I have a long list of companies selling
below BV, no debt, and a lot of cash that I've rejected because they aren't
going anywhere.

that BV is carried on acquired cost. That is, bought 50 years ago. Someone else

Deswell, but you might look at HIHOF (threaded- off for the wrong reasons) and
AEHCF (I seem to be alone on it - IPO'd last Fall, has fallen and has promise)
for small positions. IMO- both likely to double from price this year.

To something you mentioned in a post: Have you noticed a deterioration of

find a stock, go to the thread, and find no analysis of the company, just
discussion on market value. I recently went to a thread and asked about

Ron,
I would love to see your list. Picking through the trash ,is lots of fun
for me and has proven to be amazingly profitable.
You may be more interested in a higher quality stock, trading at a
discount and paying a dividend----- ROU a steel company.

Now to the Math: Frank Block did some work in the 1960's where he
demonstrated what a good management should do to maximize shareholder
returns( financial Strategy focus). Above book retained earnings yield
the highest return because the market price of the issue will generally
rise at P/B * eps: so for a stock trading at 3 time book and earning $1 per
share the investor is better off seeing the $3 per share price appreciation
rather than a $1 per share dividend. Below book the firm maximizes return
by going to max payout. In other words a $1 per share dividend is worth
more to the shareholder than $1 retained and resulting in less than a $1
appreciation in share price. I'm not doing justice here to Mr. Block, as he
quite the article on this in the March- April 1964 addition of the Financial
Analysts Journal. Worth a look.

Going a step further, I have found that stocks that are maximizing
shareholder return will behave according to the following equation:

1. P/B =(1 + g ) ^ T Where g is the growth rate of book value
and T is the investors time horizon to
convergence of price and book( in year T, p=b)

2. solved for g
g= (P/B)^(1/T)- 1

3. solved for T
T= log(P/B)/log(1+g)

Everyone following this? Good now look what happens if we assume
g is the dependent variable. Pick a P/B < 1, for any positive T that is
choosen g is a negative number ( losses) as solved in equation 2. I
would think that Paul Seniors stocks- UCR, WES, UNMG fit this model
perfectly. I will check this out and report back. ( oh, please keep in mind
that losses/ write offs are lumpy and the magnitude of the losses
is not the objective here, anticipating them is)

Ali,

James can give you more educated answer, but I look for certain things when
considering BV.

Overstated - they have made an acquisition and are carrying the acquired
company on the books at the price they paid for it. One must determine if they
overpaid or underpaid. I usually deduct 'goodwill' from assets to determine BV
because it's the amount they paid over and above the BV of the company they
acquired. Sometimes I leave it on because it was a very good acquisition
(bought out a competitor).
Also - they are carrying R&D as an asset, carrying L&B at a high value and it
may be worthless, have large EPA or other liabilities that aren't on the books,
have litigation that they are likely to lose, they have debt secured by stock,
warrants, options, etc. There are many things that can cause the BV to be
overstated and it's sometimes necessary to look deep to determine what they
are.

Understated - They have purchased equipment and are using a fast depreciation
schedule (Deswell), have made a good buy of another company and have put it on
their books at BV, taking a writeoff on the amount overpaid, they have
extensive R&D that they have written off but the patents are valuable, L&B
purchased years ago and has become very valuable (St Joe), etc.

One doesn't find any of this in a stock screening. I look at BV to analyze
management and I consider management to be the most critical aspect of
investing.

For what it's worth,
Ron

Paul,
I took a look at your three. UCR, WES, and UNMG-- Here is my quick
review:

UCR- It is very unclear what is happening with this one. It is high priced
with a high debt level- I pass based on the leverage.

Wes- The new chairman is cleaning things up by taking losses. A new broom
sweeps clean. This is a good strategy since they have a debt to equity
ratio of .69 which is on the high side. The new man is keeping the stock above
book.
and this is a wise move as dropping below book could result in liquidation
to the debt holders. I look for the new man to issue stock when the price gets
up
to pay off debt. Overall this looks like a pretty solid company that will
flourish under the new leader.

UNMG- Checked this one out. I love it! And have picked up a few shares.
The bad news is over, the recent writedowns have reinverted the stock.
Sorry I missed this one at $3 ; but I see some profitable quarters coming
in the near term. Thanks for the Tip

Ali, book value is always historic (with the exception of assets acquired as
the result of purchasing another company), and that's one problem. A second
problem is that depreciation is an estimate based on an estimated salvage value
and estimated useful life. A third problem is that securities are not marked to
market. A fourth problem is the fact that BV depends on such things as
inventory accounting conventions (LIFO vs. FIFO), estimates for bad debt,
knowledge of how the company recognizes a sale, etc. etc.

While some fixed assets like land may appreciate over time (and thus the
underlying BV is understated), others assets like hi-tech equipment decrease in
value very rapidly due to obsolescence.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that in order to accurately adjust book value
to reflect market conditions requires an audit.

Paul

Book value. Very very difficult topic. If it were so easy that you could just
invest in low p/b stocks and make a fortune, the market would quickly figure
that out and it wouldn't work any more. Forget the screens - you've got to
THINK. When you look at a low price/book stock, put the balance sheet in front
of you. Ask yourself, what are each of these items really worth. Cash - thats
worth the number on the balance sheet. Inventories, fixed assets - those you
really have to do some homework on. Goodwill? You've really got to be careful.
Investing is not so easy that there is some magic formula. If you don't
understand the business and don't understand what those numbers on the balance
sheet really are (I'm not talking accounting - I'm talking receivables -
receivable from whom? inventories - what are they and what are they really
worth? factories - when were they built? are they worth anything to anybody
else?)

Mike, I didn't respond to you on UBB because I was having computer problems.
The bottom line on this bank is that I believe it sells at close to adjusted
book after factoring in credit for its money management assets and a very
conservative reserve for bad debts, which if I recall is something like 6% of
the loan portfolio. I get the impression that it is extremely well run, that
they do not overpay for acquired assets and that the growth potential in Brazil
far exceeds that in the U.S. This offers the opportunity to acquire a core
holding without paying a premioum in an industry which in the US you have to
pay anywhere from 2-4 times book and this bank has better growth prospects and
good management. If I were to place a value on it it would probably be $50,
because I wouldn't pay that much for it but I would not be a seller there
either because I have few companies that I can see holding for 5 years + that I
can afford to own and this and TBR, whic I see as a screaming buy right now,
are two of them.

Re: TSEMF sorry that ROn took a hit on it, I believe that two years from now
the company will be a lot higher, because rumor has it they turned down $17 for
the company, but I chose to purchase DSSI which has a 24% interest in TSEMF and
a very promising electric meter reading business as well. It is speculative,
but I see the rewards as way outweighing the risks.

BTW I got the annual report on ELAMF. I like what I read seems like a well run
company with $2 a share cash, and they earn $1 on the other $5 of my equity. To
me that means that my capital at risk earns 20% return on equity. I think I can
live with it. <g> and I expect to see this stock at $10

Below book, I welcome losses and even anticipate them. I consider
write downs and restructuring below book a sign that mgt knows
what to do. UNMG seems to fit this, with the last set of charges probably
completing the liquidation process.
Of the two stocks you listed WDC and APM are a concern. Losses here
could mean a big drop in price ( especially for wdc, since it is trading at
8 times book). APM is struggling the stay above book but revenue declines
and fixed debt charges are a big concern. Actually mgt should sell some
equity to deleverage but there may not be time. APM may enter the
liquidation phase. APM mgt has got to be nervous.
ATXA bounced off book in July, I think that good news is on the way and
earnings will be booked shortly.
DRKN is also a good value: but, you will see some more losses. Financial
position is good as there is little debt. Good time to be accumulating ; but
don't be surprise if it is available at lower prices for a while.
Thanks again for Umng. I am putting DRKN on my watch list along with
DSSI which was also mentioned on this thread.

Robert , there is an extensive TBR thread and Mike Burry has written a write-up
on it as well. I purchased it at 88, 100 , 102- sold some at 118 and
repurchased at 124. I believe that the breakup will be more like the ATT
breakup than the Hanson Breakup. Yes, some people will sell the small ones and
hold or buy into the larger ones. But ultimately Brazil is a country with a
large population, and natural resources, the government seems to be getting its
act together and there is a shortage of telephones. The privatization will be a
significant catalyst for the price of the shares and I believe people will be
surprised by the premium that some of the properties will go for. As I am not
smart enough to know which ones will go at the premium and what the when issued
prices will be I am holding to my present position since I believe that the
price now is a bargain, I plan to be just like Mike, be a long term holder now,
and wait three years and see what happens/ Of course if TBR or the combined
units go to $180 I will probably take some profits <g>.

On the tobacco side, I personally have a moral issue with investing in thses

I would update my position as an avid buyer below 120. The situation

says that all 12 will be NYSE ADR's. A knowledgeable poster on
the TBR thread doubts this, but nevertheless the privatization
is going as scheduled. 3 years from now, I can't imagine more
of a lock than buying TBR at 120 or below now. Brazil is growing,

To add to this important point, we can't know, usually, whether management is

In fact, we can't know whether we are able to evaluate management - it is quite
subjective, I think. Past performance is no guarantee.

Management is quite portable, as well.

I used to be in the business of buying businesses. Only after truly working
directly with managers over a period of months, even years, would their quality

Ron,

Re: tech

And in a sure sign the market is topping, I bought even more tech
stocks. Today, I pulled the trigger on HWP at 60 3/4.
That's normal. I also bought more DSWLF at 19. Also normal.
But the abnormal is that I bought Ciena at 40. Geez, no way. An
honest-to-goodness momentum tech stock. There are no value parameters that
could describe it except its high returns and financials
and hey a PE less than 30 isn't all bad -g-.This is in addition to my three
small cap software stocks, BMC, TBR. Looking across tech, I see a lot of wasted
stocks 33-60% off their highs with valuations that are approaching Earth. But
the businesses aren't all bad. I'm trying
to keep an open mind and not be locked into the Buffett-like
never-invest-in-tech mentality.

Just in case my actions indicate the market is indeed topping,
I raised a ton of cash today by selling off every last drop of
mutual funds.

On another subject, anyone else here looking at Eagle Hardware
(EAGL) and liking what they see?

Congrats Paul on the Green Tree pick. Yet another takeover for
the thread. Did anyone else even buy it? Well, it's money out of
my pocket - it was to be my next Investor story. Well, well. Glad
tho to see another winner. So let's see, a stock should be
valued at what the private market would pay for it? Recently,
it's what the public market will pay. Another all stock swap.
Hmm, hmm good for someone. Are you taking your money and

Re Eagle, Im a long term holder of the converts(EAGLG)(2.5yrs) and the story
just keeps getting better and better. Compared to HD its a steal(of course its
not HD)but its holding its own..

I also bought some Homebase(HBI)about a month ago, its a real value play,
(M.Price has a position)..

Re undervalued techs, I like Unisys, I had bought in Sept and sold about a
month ago, its come off and looking to get back in. Good value based on P/Sr,

Mike thanks for remembering: Also thanks for not mentioning others that I own
that are not doing so well which include (but are not limited to -g-) SFLX,
NTAIF, WDC, APM, RACCQ --that Q = bankruptcy :>(
vvtv (almost a takeunder - and it may wind up that way) and HDCO which I was
wondering what the market knew that I didn't (--and I found out today after
having averaged down a full position's worth). Seems that I own larger
quantities of the ones that go down than I do of the one's that go up. That
hurts. (I need to do some better portfolio balancing with some of these recent
buys.) Still holding SWR - ouch- hurts to see it on the new lows list when
market is at 9000.

I am averaging down now on TIMT -- another one where I can not see why the
stock seems so underpriced compared to its locked-in potential (long term
contract supplier to Boeing for titanium.) And I hope this will not wind up
another HDCO for me.

I post these just to confirm to anyone who might actually follow me into some
of these positions that have been successful recently -- that I've got plenty
that aren't so successful too. That is: BE CAREFUL (-g-) Paul

(ps Mike: not sure yet what I'll do. Conseco, very aggressive co. with good
stock performance. I don't know enough about its business; I would like to hold

Re: Swisher

What can I say. The market really really hates cigar

I'll open a full position at 11 in another account if I can resist
the urge to pour more money into Telebras. The market is
treating Swisher like a tech IPO when it's a 110 year old
operating business with 20-30% ROC. It's now well below its IPO
price and the price of previous insider open market buys. Not
worried here.

Today was my worst day since October, down 1.91% with
only 3 stocks breakeven to up - HYDEA, ALR, and BMC,
the former two of which are arguably the doggiest stocks
in my portfolio. Got creamed for nearly a 10% fall in BSIS
today - though on half normal volume. Even mighty Pacificare
took a 2% step back.

Mike, thks for the kind words,
re Eagle, debenture EAGLG is 6.25 of 01 convertible into common at $18,
callable if stock trades at 27$ for 20/30 days. I am unhedged on my position
right now, however over the last 2 years have shorted and written calls on my
position when Eagle was in the $20's. Needless to say I still like it..

Re UIS, I bought for a number of reasons...
1. Nbrs looked good relative to IBM etc
2. Turnaround had been underway
3. Lawrence Weinback came on board in Sept, truely a leader from everything
I've seen before and since.
4. Financial incentives to make the turnaround happen
5. Low P/SR
6. I had extensive dealings with a senior office who was at UIS(a real lying
as_hole) and he was forced out. Had to be a positive :)
7. A fondness for Burroughs and Sperry(was a minor point)

...because the valuable assets were on the balance sheet at cost 50 years ago. 

OK, I've seen mention of finding companies with assets that substantially
exceed their balance sheet value (usually real estate)

My question is, how does one ferret out balance sheets that could stand a bit
more scrutiny, and then how does one essentially "audit" the balance sheet in
order to mark up/down such assets?

Is this the sort of thing that is only practical in limited "special
situations" (e.g., personal familiarity with the company and its assets)?

For example, how could I have dug up St. Joe, since don't live in Florida? If
someone had told me a year ago that there is great hidden value in this company
(but gave me no more information than that), how could I have done my homework
and been able to confirm or deny that?

What sort of clues help steer you toward undiscovered value plays?

- Daniel

P.S. It has been suggested to me that Inco may be a very solid long term value
play. I would like to get a good solid understanding of Inco, and must admit
that I am somewhat stumped on how to proceed. Hidden assets? Hidden
liabilities? Quality of assets, earnings, etc? Has anyone dug up anything here?

That's your most persuasive argument for me. I had a similar

Michael: There is an article in the new issue of Forbes magazine....
page 248 (April 20th),titled "Reality Check"...it lays out the
method used by Ernst Institutional Research - to evaluate earnings
clients such as Fidelity Investmts., Colonial Funds,atc. Ernst's
formula starts by comparing a co's growth in net worth over the
course of a year to its growth in operating assets (basically plant,
equip.,inventory). You subtract the latter from the former. The re-
sult is a crude measure of...free cash flow...(putting a poss. dividend
this is the amount of cash that has piled up. Then take this fig.
and subtract the growth in liabilities...(in the ex. used - no change
in liabs.). Divide the free cash by sales to get a percentage fig.
In the ex. = 3% (ratio). This figure, in and of itself, is not meaningful.
What is important is an upward or downward trend...One way to
use the trend is to compare a co's.cash flow trend to its valuation.
They give tables showing good p/e versus trend stocks and
overpriced ones, too.
Hope I'm not intruding here, with this.
Best,

Thread,

I don't see sales growth as a major consideration discussed by many on the
thread here, and I was wondering if posters would mind commenting on how they
view sales growth in a value context.

To me personally, it is so crucial that I will rarely consider a company that
doesn't have a history of positive sales growth, preferably 10%+ annually. On
historical screens that I run, low valuation stocks with decent sales growth
tend to consistently outperform the market.

Opinions?

That is not a conclusive remark. How do low valuation stocks with sales growth
compare with low valuation stocks without it?

(The latter group might be sufficiently cheaper to give comparable average
results. However, I would take a guess that there is greater
dispersion of performance among the second group - some languish or go down,
others are taken over, etc).

Jeffrey,

I agree with you that my home-brewed research has it's problems, but in general
after running screens and removing the no-grow to very slow growers historical
returns tend to improve in the samples I work with.

Admittedly my data does have problems (AAII Stock Investor):
-The database is not complete in that it only includes companies present today.
Companies that have been bought-out or gone-under would not be weighted in the
screen.
-It is likely biased by other screening criterion I use, such as ROE
requirements, debt level restrictions, market cap requirements,etc.

What do you think would be a "fair" test to run to isolate value stocks with
and without sales growth? I'm interested for input here, because I'm needing to
develop some new screens with superior historical performance to generate some
new investment ideas.

I haven't had much luck finding under valued stocks with screening. I don't
believe there's a math formula for finding good buys. Seems the only way I can
find anything is pure hard work - looking, looking,...

I scan every symbol I see mentioned on this thread and those mentioned by
certain people on SI. I also 'bottom fish' because sometimes there's a company
that's fallen off for the wrong reasons. Have picked up my best buys from
'biggest losers' list. I also decide what sectors will be performing well and
look for good buys in the sector.

I disagree with the discussion on the importance of management as I consider an
evaluation of management the most critical aspect of a company. This has to be
a historical evaluation, usually based on company performance, but sometimes on
biography. Buying Chrysler when Ioccoca took over as an example.

How does one find a St. Joe? Read the reports and company PR, do the research,
then get an article in IBD or WSJ after you buy. It was a great long term
investment that became a great short term. I've had this happen on 3 companies
in the past year. Luck in timing.

For what it's worth,
Ron

I guess the most basic approach would be to take a all stocks of a given

and then divide them into quartiles based up recent 12mm sales growth.

Something similar could be done based on Price/Book to catch stocks with

The measurement variable would price chg in the stock 12 months after the

Sunbeam might be worth a look.

An IPO called Global-Tech Appliances (GAI) has signed a four year deal with
Sunbeam to be the sole supplier of select products. Company is HongKong based
with China manufacturing. Don't really care for GAI because of the one customer
concentration, but they will put out product at much lower costs than US based
Sunbeam manufacturing and this could result in good Sunbeam profits going
forward.

Why would anyone here care about Sunbeam SOC? At psr more than 2.5, price/book
greater than 5, being in a very tough, competitive business, with all attention
focused on one person -- Al Dunlap, with all power in one other person or firm
(Mike Price-- granted though...THE Mike Price)-- any positives for anyone
thinking about going into this stock are still outweighed, IMO, by alternatives
in other - value - companies. Just because this stock has dropped quickly and
very publicly from 50 to 30 roughly, doesn't mean it's anywhere near being a
value stock, IMO. But then again- I thought the stock was overextended at 14

2)TPL (Texas Pacific Land Trust). I know virtually nothing about TPL but am

From:Chuzzlewit

Daniel, I know of no easy way to answer that question, and many of the
implications that go with it are indeed troubling. One very important ancillary
problem is that balance sheet values are inextricably entwined with management
estimates-- an these can lead to very nasty surprises for the unwary. For
example, there was a computer leasing company in the 70's (the name escapes me
now) that was extremely profitable for a number of years, until IBM came out
with its next generation of mainframes. The problem was that management chose
to depreciate the assets (mainframes) over an unreasonably long period of time
and assigned unreasonably high salvage values to the hardware. This means that
the assets values were substantially overstated on the books. As I recall, the
company filed for bankruptcy about six months after the new generation of
computers was unveiled, and was subsequently liquidated .The only way you would
know these practices is if you had detailed knowledge of the computer business,
and knowledge of the product life cycle.

The other issue I find troubling in a balance sheet approach is that even if
the value of the asset really is significantly understated we need to figure
out what chain of events would lead to unlocking that value. For example, a
railroad may own land carried on the books at only a few dollars an acre, but
is currently worth $100,000 per acre. This land may be a right of way, so what
unlocks this hidden "value" to the investor? Probably only the demise of the
business.

That's why I think that a cash flow approach may be a better first step in
valuing a business then looking at book value.

Paul

Great. I needed that. So St. Joe is fundamentally a "creative"

Joe's present is felt - and apparently, somewhat feared.

Re: TRC, James Clarke sure did bring it up. Made a few
of us profits on its August ride. I have an appraisal of the
land done by one of the major investors. It made me much
less interested in the stock above $20-25. I don't think
that TRC has quite the flexibility or the potential of St.
Joe. TRC truly holds land that will never ever be developed,
except for a few specific corridors along 5. I'd rather
