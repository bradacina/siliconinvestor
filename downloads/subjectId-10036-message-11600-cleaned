re ANF: <<they USED to wear Tommy Hilfiger too. Now they wear Fubu. This isn't
to say that it's not a cheap security. It just not a "buffet" company. >>Point
taken - nothing is etched in stone - even solid brands. The fickleness of youth
works against this brand, even as peer envy helps build it. Consequently I
didn't and wouldn't pay a premium for the brand. Nevertheless, branding has
value and the more closely a customer base identifies with a brand, the more
resistant to competitive inroads and the more time to fix fashion missteps.
Didn't WEB pick up JNY and another branded fashion apparel company recently?
And I suspect ANF's branding is closer to WEB's tradtional, Coke, Sees Candy,
approach than his more recent forays into bricks, carpet, paint, and drywall.

Marc F. re: building materials companies. Yes, agree that MAS at the right
price ought to be of interest to Mr. Buffett.

also, fwiw:

I have a position in BMHC. This building materials company is similar to HBP,
which at least a couple on this thread have endorsed. HBP trades at a low
price, as does BMHC, imo. HBP has interesting institutional support though with
Baupost, Royce, Gabelli, and Ruane, Cunniff, who are all holders (assuming I
have the latest, correct info.). I chose BMHC because its price/book is lower
(better) than HBP.

I find it odd that building material supplies companies are stuck at their low
levels while the various homebuilders mentioned here so often, have all (from
what I can tell) risen substantially (imo).

<<i would put jny in the category of "cigar butt." besides, i'm not convinced
"he" bought it. >>By "cigar butt," do you mean he bought it strictly because it
was deeply undervalued, and would then sell it when it gets back to reasonable
valuation without consideration of ongoing sustainable growth [As opposed to
Coke, with strong consumer franchise, and presumably unlimited growth]? I tend
to think the stable of fashion brands @ JNY would fit the 'consumer franchise'
theme. The only problem, is predictability/sustainability - Coke has it,
fashion doesn't. But if a diversified 'portfolio' of fashion brands are managed
skillfully, and bought when out of favor and offering a decent margin of
safety, they may offer a similar or even better risk reward than the more
predictable product: http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=KO&d=my&c=jny

I would define brand as a promise perceived by the customer, differentiating a
product from others possessing similar physical attributes. It's what makes
Coke or Bayer aspirin different from generics and what enables ANF to sell $8
Logo'd T-shirts for $25 to $35 over a period of years. Not to you or me - I'm
unwilling to pay a premium to make a fashion statement, but to a substantial
customer base. I value a brand by looking at the premium customers will pay
over reasonable generic alternatives. This premium will fluctuate over time and
may eventually disappear due to social trends or bad management. I would agree
that brand loyalty, how long customers can reasonably be expected to pay a
premium is a critical and difficult to forecast element. Fads soar and sag -
usually within one or 2 years. Many fashion styles come and go as quickly - but
that's not the same as brand - ANF has weathered several style changes - cargo
pants come to mind - the brand cuts across style changes and fashion fads.
Ralph Lauren introduces new styles every year - it's an attribute of that
brand. Does this mean branding lasts forever, or even decades - nope. But is a
brand that can't be assured of weathering decades, not a brand? Is it without
value?

I sometimes view fad retailers similar to entertainment companies or electronic

theatrical hit or top-selling game CD or hot fashion item. That it's better to
buy the company with the cheapest stock in the sector, wait for its turn for a
'win' and sell as the stock moves up. Sometimes this works. (And sometimes it
doesn't.)

regarding fashion brands: I'm out of my AEOS position, and have moved into PERY
(at higher levels). I'll likely add a bit more to my small position.
PERY looks to me to be the cheapest of the fashion brand stocks. Now if they
could only come up with some hot selling fashions.

Frankly, I (as well as the market) question their ability to grow earnings at

IF they do, then certainly the shares will go higher.

Comparing the valuation of ANF with GADZ, particularly price to book and price

The whole industry scares me in an economic slowdown because kids will not be

expected for ANF: 22% vs 13% for RL. Maybe this was onetime hot IPO that came
out too high [I haven't studied RL, so my impressions may be naive &
superficial]. My contention with Brands is to buy them 'on sale' where you get
a substantial portion of the brand value for gratis - even if estimates for
growth prove to be 50% too high, 14% instead of concensus 22%, this could still
kick out 18+% annual return based on conservative PE OF 14. At the same time, I
recognize that I have no edge when it comes to recognizing and forecasting

From:Bob Rudd
The latest 10-Q has operating earnings (=EBITDA, since no DA) @ (97,056) but
the earnings press release shows this 2-step: <<Income from Operations

Second quarter income from operations was $87.4 million, before restructuring
and special charges, driven by gross margins that were on plan resulting from
better sourcing and a larger mix of luxury apparel in the wholesale group. This
gain was offset by the strategic decision to take earlier markdowns in the
company-owned retail stores that resulted in a reduction in gross margin for
the retail segment.

Restructuring and Special Charges

As previously announced, the Company recorded an after-tax charge of $111.6
million related to the write-down of the assets of a number of stores to fair
value, the closures of non-strategic and under-performing retail stores, the
write-down associated with the acceleration in the reduction of aged inventory
and operating initiatives including consolidation of overseas sourcing
operations, as well as employee-related costs. Including the previously
announced restructuring and special charges, the Company reported a net loss of
$62.8 million, or a loss of $0.65 per diluted share. The charge will be cash
flow neutral in fiscal 2001.>>
So if you used the 87.4 and yahoo market guide used the SEC (97.056) in the TTM
EBITDA (=EBIT), then that might account for the difference.
Although Yahoo/Market guide appears to take the numbers right out of the SEC
reports without making any adjustments for extraordinary charges and such, it
probably is more appropriate not to include those charges. Merrill shows
operating earnings for 2000 [not TTM) @ 257, and projects 01 & 02 @ 294.9 &
330.6 respectively (With the 111.6 net restructuring charge specifically
excluded).
If I take my EV of 2,373 and Merrill's moderately prospective 01 EBIT(DA)
294.9, we get EV/EBIT(DA) OF 8. That's higher than ANF's 6.8, but far better
than the 15.9 I originally posted based, apparently, on inclusion of
restructuring charges.

NTAI has been discussed here several times. They design and manufacture

been much discussion on threads as to whether the founder, Mr. Koo, is

RCOT is somewhat similar. I like that they are diversified in

Well, I don't like your post, jhelmers. It just shows up too many of my
shortcomings -g-.

long reply--->

I'd say there's still room for more appreciation in CCK. But (dang!) I didn't
buy at 3 so I'm reluctant to put money on it now at 5 either. Crown Cork is a
company with a tremendous history - I surely hope they can get their businesses
back to where they were when they were so respected for their financial and
business acumen.

LMG/A. I don't follow this one. I do know that it's somewhat related to T, and
I've just sold my losing position in T. I believe the sum of the parts total
for T is (even after this market decline)greater than the current price for T,
and I believe I would've held for a while had T not cut the dividend. They
announced that they were slashing their dividend; I see that as breaking an
implied covenant with stockholders, so I've exited the position. In the cable
television business, I've had CHTR this year (sold at a loss), and I continue
to look for an entry point for CMCSA, a favorite of mine in past years.

WCOM should recover. Unfortunately for me, I'm playing it with the ICIX buyout.
ICIX stock I had at 30+ , mid 20 and 17 is now under 4. If the deal goes
through, and if there's no price/terms renegotiation (or renegotiated with
terms not too onerous), I'll recoup some of my losses if/when I get WCOM stock.

NITE looks attractive. I'll have to look further. I have SWS which holds some
NITE shares. I made the classic beginner's mistake -- it is amazing (and very
irritating) to me how I can make the same types of mistakes again and again --
of buying SWS for a short term trade, and, having it go against me, turning the
trade into a longer term investment.

I have CLRN at much higher prices. A company I had was taken over by CLRN for
CLRN stock. I kept the CLRN stock and have watched it drift ever lower since
summer. And I passed up an opportunity to add to my position when it was
suggested here couple of weeks back. It scooted from 12 (if I recall
correctly)to 18; now it's back to new lows at 10. They're a leader in a growing
business segment (IP telephony, with their first mover advantage); revenue is
increasing rapidly. Problem (for me)is they are not making any money, yet. I'll
hold my small amount, and I am considering just adding a bit more here to
average down on the position.

ALV, I don't know this one.

HABK looks like a wonderful opportunity. I'll have to look further. At first
glance it's just what I'm searching for. If it's a company that primarily
focuses on financing trade with Central/South America. That would make it a
competitor of BLX, a stock Mike Burry and I owned and discussed here maybe 3-4
years ago. I slipped up on BLX and sold too quickly and at a loss (believe I
got scared out of it during Asian debacle in '98), and I've been kicking myself
since. And looking for a good reentry point. (I missed a good buying
opportunity with BLX again in Dec. of '99). Price relative to financials for
HABK looks MUCH better than for BLX. (BLX has a solid reputation with customers
and analysts, and a good history for delivering results - HABK may be a
relative newcomer in the business.) These bank financings are a niche market
where business relationships count (that is my impression anyway), and because
their loans are somewhat complex (imo) but very short term in nature, there is
lessoned chance of monetary devaluations/defaults, but good profitability
potential.

all just my opinion
I've been wrong many, many times
(as you can easily see)

probably would have if Buffett hadn't splashed Holy Water on another asbestos
play. Despite misses like this, I'm overall comfortable with 'don't chase em up

below] major uptrend.

Bob,
I guess I don't see it as chasing it up. What if you just discovered it at 5
and hadn't looked at it at 3? Or maybe you had no extra cash when it was at 3?
Or you saw a more attractive option then that's gone now? What if there was a
false rumor on the Internet that spiked it down to 3 for just a day?

Have you looked at O'Shaugnessy's studies of decades of market data where he
concludes that the ony way to outperform buying cheap stocks is to buy cheap
stocks that are already moving up? I could understand disbelieving him and
saying cheap is cheap and I don't care how it got there. But not being willing
to buy a dollar bill for $0.60 because you turned it down at $0.50 yesterday?

I think we all struggle with that one.

Hi John,

I am currently holding LMGA. I bought TCI Cable (TCOMA) which spun-off TCIVA
which was then merged with Liberty Media as a consequence of the TCOMA/T
merger. So if you thought valuing LMGA was difficult try holding onto it as it
is transmogrified over the years. I shouldn't complain since it has been very
profitable on paper but I see now that I should have sold earlier this year (as
with everything).

The assets appear valuable and the management (John Malone) is shrewd and
intelligent. However, I have no idea how much it is worth. If you learn
anything I would love to hear it.

On another note: is anybody interested in COMS for the spin-off play? Until
today COMS was trading close to the cash in the till. Granted they will not be
profitable for another 2 quarters if management is to be believed but the
spin-off may be worth enough to make up for the uncertainty. Thoughts? I own a
medium position currently most of which I bought in the last two days.

Happy Holidays,

To all:

I'm hoping for some help here on how to calculate inventory yield. I read a
recent analyst report on using it as an indicator for future performance of
retailers. I was intrigued enough to want to add it to my spreadsheet, but
unfortunately the analyst chose not to share how he does the calculation. He
did provide some graphs with inventory yield numbers for Costco (among others)
so I thought I would be able to back into the formula. So far, no luck. By
checking a few books and searching the web I was able to find a few references,
and I've tried a few different calculations which seemed sensible to me, but
nothing matches his numbers. I asked my broker to see if she could find out how
he does the calculation, but she got no response.

I was able to glean some clues from the report as to the components of the
calculations (and, of course, the concept is obvious). To quote a salient
passage: "Inventory yield is our measure for assessing the investment return
being earned just on capital devoted to inventory." He goes on to name three
factors which affect inventory yield; gross margin, inventory turn, COGS.

To my simple mind, the most logical formula for inventory yield is:

Gross profit / ((End Inventory - Begin Inventory) + COGS)

If I use this formula, I do not match the numbers on the analyst's report. I'm
not obsessive about these things, and I don't care if I match the guy' numbers
exactly, but I would at least like to be confident that what I'm doing is
sound. It especially bothers me that my numbers seem to be less volatile than
his.

Does anyone have any insight on this? TIA to anyone who cares to chime in.

Fred "I'm a gutfeel voodoo kind of investor" Andrews:

rambling response.... and long too:

I seem to be having a head/gut issue with TXT myself. Not even sure I can
separate some of the "rationale issues" between head and gut. Consider TXT
management. I've watched TXT for a couple of years - the leadership are tough,
committed, results-driven businessmen/women. Is that a demonstrable fact or
just my gut feeling? ROE performance (a measure of management performance for
me)is generally only okay, not great.

Every once in a while, I'll take a substantial position a company. Which is
maybe put 15-20% of a portfolio into one stock. I'm considering doing that with
TXT now, and that is gutfeel investing to me. The issue is how much more to buy
and when. (Stock rose a bit Fri, but could drop again to retest lows. OTOH, as
you point out, TXT has, and maybe may again, move up very quickly on positive
analyst comments.)

There's something not quite right with TXT - the price/value anomaly compared
to its peers. TXT "should" be selling at higher prices, but it isn't. Quicken
lumps TXT in "conglomerate" category, and many stocks in Quicken's list are up
closer to highs than lows, but not TXT.

http://www.quicken.com/investments/comparison/?symbol=TXT

(aside: PPG in that Quicken list seems to me to be out of place there. DOV, a
favorite of Jim Clarke in the past - may be worth a look now again.)

I put TXT more in the aerospace category. And that, as you know, has been a
very rewarding area for investors lately. NOC and RTN.b, discussed here at much
lower prices, for example. And I seem to recall NNS, a steady double since
mentioned here when a Barron's article had a write-up on it as a strong value
buy. Plus BA, a double from when people here or on Buffettology thread were
discussing it in '99, if I remember correctly.

Something seems to be pulling TXT down. Perhaps something much more significant
with the recent news that we just don't know about? That 2nd Osprey crash
killing those Marines and having the crash jeopardizing TXT's important
aircraft business? Or family of Mel Carnahan, the senatorial candidate who died
in a Cessna, who are now suing TXT? Maybe there are recession related problems
in Textron Financial that haven't been publicly disclosed? Or a general
downgrading of the stock because of its automotive exposure? Maybe, now that
NOC is buying LIT, the gov't won't be so willing to approve any more
consolidations (assuming the gov't still wants to keep competition and
alternative choices among its military equipment vendors)- so value of TXT to
an acquirer is now less? And since TXT, after the merger of others, will be
even a smaller player, TXT now has lesser value to individual investors? I do
not know.

OTOH:

TXT has delivered improving results for 11 years:

http://www.textron.com/investor/index.html

Dividends up, book value up. P/e down. Stock price at '97 level.

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=txt&B1=Enter

Imo, TXT certainly could be attractive for anybody who likes DRIP accounts, or
will consider the stock for a diversified portfolio. For me specifically, if I
come to believe that TXT can just maintain its earnings in the next year or
two, and can keep those dividend increases coming, then I will consider taking
a substantial portfolio position in the stock and holding for what I perceive
to be the stock's inevitable rise.

I want to issue this special disclaimer: Not only have I been wrong many, many
times, but I can be, have been, especially wrong if I place relatively big bets
on a stock. There is no positive correlation that I can see between my
confidence in a stock or my best stock idea(s) or the size of my bet, and a
subsequent rise in the stock. In other words, the results of my gutfeel
investing are iffy.
-g- Actually, in this market, a lot of my investing seems iffy.

Paul- Let's not forget that I first bought CCK in the mid teens and again at 6
1/2 on the way down. After buying a bunch below four, I have my average down to
4.4. If I had not been a frustrated owner who kept doing research as I lost
money on the way down, I would not have had the conviction to make the position
material earlier this month. I have found that some of my best investments have
started out as big losers on small positions. Also, the CCK position is not a
winner 'til I get out and I am hoping for more from here.

ALV is a UK auto air bag maker which has gotten caught up in the vortex of auto
maker troubles. I like the fact that they produce a high tech product in which
they have a leadership position and are gaining market share. It has a
relatively clean balance sheet and is at a fairly low multiple to earnings and
cashflow. The problem here is any investment may be dead money for a while.

Glad to get your input on HABK. The steady insider buying is a positive. If
their problems are not terminal, it should bounce after year end.

Terrapin- LMGA, as you said, is Malone's media investment vehicle. He has the
vast majority of his net worth tied up in the operation. It currently trades at
a discount to the sum of the publicly traded parts (22% discount was my best
estimate the last time I calculated it).

The problem is ascertaining the value of each of those investments. LMGA is the
largest single investor in News Corp., a large shareholder of AOL/Time Warner
(which I am not enamored of at these prices); owns stock in USAI (which I am
enamored of); and owns quite a bit of CD as well as a multitude of other mostly
media and communications type holdings. If one could get comfortable with the
valuations of majority of the underlying companies he owns, I think this is a
great way to get a diversified exposure to the media sector. Currently, this is
a small position for me if only because of the complexity and my lack of full
understanding.

I do fundamentally believe that difficult to understand securities often are
misvalued and thus provide the greatest opportunity. I just have to get a
greater comfort level.

I took a brief look at COMS and it certainly looks cheap at first glance. I
just don't know anything about the viability of its various businesses.

Mark Inventory Yield: Here's some takes on it:

D/5026B6556C0416878625673C005B8DB5/$File/info9info.html
inventory yield:"Simply stated, it is the company's profits for the last four
quarters, taken as a percentage of its total spending on *new* inventories in
the same period. The concept is used to help analyze companies future growth
because their future growth is often a factor of the inventories they have
invested in rather than the sales it has just experienced"
http://www.fortune.com/fortune/investor/1999/07/19/inv.html
"Inventory yield is calculated by taking gross profit, *subtracting payables*,
and dividing by inventories."

I also saw Inventory yield described as equivalent to GMROII, a widely used
measure of retail performance
<<GMROII: "Jim Roy" 'Gross Margin Return On Inventory Investment. A common
ratio index for evaluating the payback on an item, brand, sub-category, or
planogram. GMROII is most often calculated by retailers as: GM% x Turns =
GMROII.>>
I suspect all the above are aiming at same target: a measure of inventory
productivity & trends, but there are variations where people have added their
own twists. You might try plugging some of the above variations to see if they
match the results in the report. Or just pick one of the measures that you like
- since each of the variations will kick out pretty similar results when used
to evaluate the trend in a company or compare trends between companies as long
as you consistantly use the same measure.
Two boards on Fool.com: 'Reading Financial Statements' & 'Security Analysis --
the book' often respond well to such questions.
Good luck on your quest.

Inventory yield - I don't know quite what that refers to, but with retailers I
look very hard at inventory turns. But not really the formula, but the concept.
What I am looking for are companies like Abercrombie & Fitch, where the
inventory sells before they have to pay for it. Think of it this way. If a
retailer has to pay its suppliers in 60 days, but can turn those inventories
more than 6 times a year (60 days), they have a float. And if the company is
growing, their major capital investment (inventories) will be financed for free
by their suppliers. Contrast that with a retailer which grows fast but only
turns inventory 3 times a year. They have to finance the inventory investment
with debt. The 3-turn retailers that want to grow usually blow up eventually,
but the 9 turn retailers are your Gaps. Look at the cash flow statement of Gap
or Walmart or ANF over the years. And then look at Dell. Same dynamic. You sell
the product for cash (a retailer has virtually no receivables, neither does
Dell) before you have to pay your suppliers. Dell does this better than
anybody. When you find one of these - they are very rare - you forget about the
multiples for a few days and study the company recognizing that you might be
looking at a gem.

not tempt Jim Clarke et. al. again, but the company is profitable - more so
than in our earlier forays into it. From their Nov 1 press release: "The

I'm glad they got rid of their cycling business that they had bought only a

Hi Madharry. I'm playing catch the falling knife with a few knives:

Today, I added to my small exploratory position in CA.

http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CA&d=5y

Here's a blurb discussing somebody's list of undervalued stocks (which includes
CA). Some of the stocks have been mentioned here or on Buffettology (INTC,
SYMC, MSFT):

http://hmt.hoovers.com/EC/2000/11/13/doc3.html
--------------------------
I've been considering downtrodden Circuit City and/or Best Buy. Instead, I
decided to start a small exploratory position in Tweeter Home
Entertainment(TWTR), who are up-scale and less diversified than CC or BBY. I am
hoping these are all friendless, beat-up stocks, near their low, but with a
business model that still works okay. TWTR financials show no ltd, price near
book, mediocre ROE, not a lot of history.
--------------------------
MGM- (It's the movie business, different from MGG, the casino business, a
separate entity)

http://biz.yahoo.com/p/m/mgm.html

Who can know which of their films might be successful enough or exciting enough
to propel MGM stock from its lows? And who can tell what their apparently vast
film library is really worth? For that matter who can say how low this stock
will go or what its fair value is? Here the bet is strictly on management.
Buyers now get to purchase at a price below which Mr. Yemenidjian has made open
market purchases. He runs MGM for Kirk Kerkorian. My impression is (I don't
know the factual record), that people who've followed Mr. Kerkorian into his
investments have done very well (Chrysler being the prime example). Another
sign is that Priscilla Presley, MGM director, has made her first open market
MGM purchase. (159 shares according to Yahoo). What THAT sign might indicate
though, I do not know. -g-
Still, I've started a small exploratory position in MGM as well.

Hya Paul, re TXT--thanks for your analysis. I like it here, seems to have lost
the bottom (hate myself every time I don't buy because of a couple of points)).
IMHO, the best value to the shareholders would be if they spun off the aircraft
business, which could be a nice fit for UTX or BA. Also, the land systems,
could be a nice fit for GD or United Defense (Carlyle Group). Then, we may see
another NNS phenomenon. The two spun-off businesses would sky-rocket while the
remaining portion would find itself where TEN is today. DISCLAIMER: This is all
pure fantasy and I am not the CEO, nor the investment banker <GGG>.
I did, though, buy a ton of NNS after the spin-off from TEN. Invested, and
traded that one a ton, but very sadly missed a lot of the last rise. That one

BAMM negatives:

Could there be off-balance sheet items that negate the net-net value?????

Borders is hitting new lows as well. Book business has become ever more

TPR positives:

Insiders consistent buyers, i.e. no sales

Franklin Value and Gabelli are holders per latest public (Yahoo) reports.

Price/sales and price/book very low compared to past years.

They've cut back ltd.

NCA = $6.9/sh.
(I'm saying NCA= $6.9. Anybody with better or correct info. for calculating
these net-nets, please let me know.)

TPR negatives:

Earnings loss this year and expected next year (per the one analyst covering).

Sales are also decreasing. Radiators - replacement/oem parts for cars - would
seem to be a less attractive business to garner investor attention.

I'm picking these stocks from the daily new lows list. TPR has low trading
volume. (I couldn't get lowest prices on either BAMM or TPR; I stepped up and
bought TPR @ 2 3/8 and 2 7/16 for example. May be better buy opportunities for
TPR if it retests low, 2 1/8.)

Re: net-nets. R, you are just too tough for me.

As I say: I would like to believe - but I'm not quite sure - that I'm buying
these net nets because they fit a model and are part of a package of net-nets.
You got me, They fit the financial model but not my mental model. Man, some of
these net-net stocks are cigar butts that are just sooo difficult for me to
pick up. Doesn't mean they're not good or great investments, just that I'm a
little weak here in buying and holding such micro micro caps.

I'll put JLMC on my watch list. They're in the bridal gown biz., and they've
generally been profitable. They may possibly be somewhat recession resistant.
Lots of cultures demand expensive weddings -- it's a cliche, but some folks in
some cultures (and we've got such cultures in this diverse country) face strong
societal pressures to hold an expensive wedding, even if the family has to go
into debt to do it.
The giant in the industry is David's Bridal. And if I recall correctly,
undervalued also for quite a while until finally taken private (at a nice
profit to patient value investors).

ROSD - I just can't right now go for a one-store, wall covering place in
downtown Toronto unless I understand more. They've been in business a long
time, maybe they've got hidden assets (real estate?) or maybe they're a
similarly good business like Mr. Buffett's Furniture Mart. I do not know.

Okay though, here're two for you:

IDTC with $30 sh. cash, very little LTD, selling for about $20. Imo, they very
possibly are going through some, maybe all of this cash, -- looks to me like a
risk with IDTC is that it's a cash-in-search-of-a-business proposition.

AWX- Is not profitable now, but Chairman picked up 168,000 sh. @ 3 in open
market in Aug., and other insiders have bought this year @5. Net-net AWX trades
for about 2 5/8 today.

AWX is very interesting. $14.11 book with $5.34 NCA, insider buying and a
company buyback for $2 5/8. Sounds great.

I don't know much about either ROSD or JLMC but they are both PROFITABLE which
makes the discounts to book seem overdone.
It will be very interesting to see how it all shakes out in the microcap world.
SO MANY stocks trading well below private market valuations.
But I guess with the speculation overall in the not to distant past its not
hard to believe.
I am feeling a bit more fear than ever before and as a result have been placing
smaller bets than I otherwise would.
But, in the past, buying when I was really fearful were the best buys.

One more thing about net-nets, they can turn into growth or low p/e stocks too.
So don't stick to closely to the 50% rule.
GIII & NICH are 2 that I was buying at much lower levels and have more than
tripled and still remain darn cheap. Sure, I have sold some, but not all. And
there are always trading opportunities too.

Speaking of trading opportunities, BONT was down to $2 today before rallying
big. I bought more at $2.15. Lots of book value, insider buying and the
reasonable prospect of 80 cents in earnings next year.

EBSC...only one small insider buy reported. Makes me worry about this one.

What do you think about HBI ? The market seems to think they arent going to
make it. Certainly most of their book & all of their NCA will be eaten up

I have EBSC as do (or did) several on this thread. And I agree it does not look

I've not liked HBI. Seemed like they were experimenting too much or too

But I have to defer to others here on the thread who know more about the

I didnt know J had so much in equity. Dang. Too bad they want to blow it on
internet nonsense.
Good news is..."At the Annual Meeting, Allan R. Tessler, Chairman and Chief
Executive
Officer of the Company, announced that he had purchased approximately 65,000
shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common
Stock") on or about December 5, 2000, and further announced that he may
continue
to purchase additional shares of Common Stock.
With respect to the Company's investment in InterWorld Corporation
("InterWorld"), Mr. Tessler indicated that the Company was in the process of
attempting to acquire InterWorld and would hope to complete an agreement soon."

Trouble is the volume was never high enough for 65k.

I continue to buy DIYH even though its no doubt in a death march.
The insiders continue to buy. There is a LOT of equity left to piss away. But
last quarter was pretty terrible from an ongoing operations standpoint.
I really dont see whats keeping them from closing more stores and soon.
I am hoping they are working on a deal for several of their properties. One
which they own outright was closed recently and for sale. (I expect a gain) and
another which was closed recently will be subleased and the income will flow
back to them because they had to write off the remaining lease term. Ideally
they will announce a deal with one party buying that location and maybe taking
over a few others after liquidation although thats wishful thinking on my part.
I have no illusions, its pretty much a real estate play now.
Sort of worried that management may have its head in the sand however.

I just keep buying (stupidly?) KDUS (now trading at 72 cents), the bulletin
board stock that has $1.90 or so cash/ per share, a 30% (not positive about
that percentage-might be diluted by other investments) interest in Axiom, a
privately held biotech company, current license fees of $100,000/yr., plus blue
sky for licenses/royalties from its other patents. The CEO and only employee,
Mr. Glass,(the company is a shell) is Carl Icahn's lawyer or main man, from
what I've heard. Carl owns about a quarter of KDUS.

There's over $20 mil in cash, so at, say, 5% interest/ yr., maybe Glass and the
accts. and lawyers won't have to go into principal to pay their salaries/fees
this year.

BMY owns/owned 2 mil shares, but have been selling. Why, I can't figure.
Capital losses to offset capital gains?

Maybe it's the bulletin board status that's a turn-off? Maybe it's the 23/32
price...or the obscene spread the market makers take? I'm not sure what the
catalyst is that takes the stock to where it should be, over $2/sh. Maybe
someone buys it out, although they're taking their sweet time? I just keep

The fate of the area's two HomeBase stores is unclear now that the retail chain

decorating.

HomeBase Inc. announced Dec. 5 that it will convert 62 of its HomeBase stores
to the House2Home format and close 22 others as part of a major turnaround bid.

So far HomeBase has revealed plans only for the first two phases of its
roll-out, covering 31 stores in Los Angeles. There, 18 stores will be
converted. There will be eight phases in all, spread over a year.

HomeBase has not revealed plans for its Rancho Cordova store or its Sacramento

HomeBase opened five House2Home test stores in different markets in Southern
California and Las Vegas in September. The company says it could return to
profitability as soon as the fourth quarter of next year.

Fred Andrews: re. PTV, CCK, SEE and pkg/container stocks: I'm looking at your
PTV again. I remember it from your postings on the spin-off thread.

The stock's now about 12 3/8, up about 25% from the time of your post(s) about
a year ago. The stock also signaled a buy - in hindsight - of course -g- in
hindsight - when it dropped to about 7 1/2 this year, because at that level it
equaled the price at which at least some insiders had their options priced.
Sorry I missed the signal and the stock.

What brings me to PTV is SEE and CCK. Sealed Air trades at a multiple that's
almost like a busted growth stock. On a p/e basis, to me, the stock is
growth-stock expensive - even though the stock price has already come down
substantially. In the recent past, there's not been much revenue growth.
(Nobody expects too much from packaging/container companies anyway.) So I can't
understand why the stock is still so expensively priced.

http://www.stocksheet.com/goto/?Ticker=see&B1=Enter

Even more perplexing, I can't fathom why the Davis Funds are so heavily
invested here. (I looked at SEE when I read somewhere that Chris Davis had
taken a big position in the stock. These Davis brothers are/have been EXCELLENT
investors.)

To me, SEE and PTV are comparable, but PTV is much less expensive. SEE has MUCH
less debt though, and that may be significant enough to make all the
difference. Both are about $2-3B in market cap. SEE has twice the EBITDA, but
at a casual look, I attribute that to PTV's expenses associated with becoming
an independent company. If PTV can earn the same margins as SEE, then PTV
should be a double from current price. I realize that to do this analysis
right, we ought to look at the different markets and businesses served by each
company - not all packaging and container markets are growing equally or
similarly profitable. PTV prides themselves - or so it appears - on their
innovative use of technology, so if they are aggressive and savvy in marketing
(as I would like to expect from a newly independent company), then they should
eventually, I guess, be similar to SEE. With its good ROE and a good (higher)
price/book.

Here's a comparison. (I included AMCR -- I follow it although it's difficult to
get much info. on this foreign co.)

http://www.quicken.com/investments/stats/?symbol=PTV+SEE+AMCR+CCK

OTOH. CCK. I've totally messed up with all these pkg/container companies. Just
very sad. What's the use of following or monitoring if I don't buy even one
when there's value? The value as mentioned here by others for example with CCK.
And Steve Emmerich's post suggesting I might/could/should/ reconsider and step
up to CCK at 5 (even though I didn't buy at 3) because CCK might still have
room to run -- he was right. Right about the stock, and right about my making a
classic error of not being willing to buy value just because the stock has come
up off its lows from a few days earlier. It's up now another 49% to 7 7/16. Not
a bad move in a week. And it might go further if there's a "January effect."
CCK may be the best bet still in this whole sector. Somehow, I'm more attracted
to PTV--. Either I must mentally reset regarding CCK (this is hard for me -g-)
and then take a small position, or else I will just have to get comfortable
with the idea that CCK is going to be one of those many companies I
coulda/shoulda/dint invest in and which got away from me.

Paul: re TXT and PTV. I did join you finally in TXT on Thursday, and was
pleased to see the action on Friday. Window dressing or nice bounce off of a
double bottom? I overcame my tremendous resistance to not getting the "bottom"
and put it in the IRA. Wanted to buy more in regular account, but am waiting
for a pullback or I've lost it forever. I find it so easy to leg in (usually in
thirds), but I am constitutionally incapable of chasing up. I have a ton of
PTV, having chased it down from that 10 area (back then) to 7 3/4. Stuck it in
a bunch of accounts at that price, so that it's balancing the LOR in the IRA.
The full measure of my confidence though, is whether I put it in the kids'
accounts. Did that in a roundabout way, as I added it to an account that
subsequently became an estate account. Full disclosure: I also have some shares
of PTV still at a loss, but because of my aggressive, sometimes foolhardy
averaging down, I have turned it into a winning position. Oh gosh, and I
doubled Thursday on that losing LOR, which Barbara Marcin (Gabelli funds?)
mentioned Friday night on Louis Bullheyser's Wall Street Week as one of her
year 2001 picks.

<<<I don't see how things could get much worse no matter what happens at the
DOJ and this despite declining PC and/or software sales...or am I wrong? Any
opinions out there?>>>

So far I don't see any evidence of "declining PC and/or software sales". For
some odd reason, in the middle of all the gloom and doom, I haven't seen a
single piece of editorial commentary on SAB 101 or the likelihood of it's
accounting for the majority of the recent tech warnings when combined with the
SEC fair disclosure rule.

For the Staff Accounting Bulletin 101 see:

http://www.sec.gov/rules/acctreps/sab101.htm

To understand why it's hitting channel stuffers in Q4 see SAB 101B:

http://www.sec.gov/rules/acctreps/sab101b1.htm

For years a lot of software companies, box makers, chip manufacturers, etc.
have used the channel to meet or
beat their numbers. A lot of investors have been mystified over the years to
find their favorite tech stock clobbered
once every 12-18 months when they are forced to clear the channel. The new
ruling will stop this questionable
practice by requiring companies to only count "sell through" as revenue. In the
long run, it's also likely to improve
margins as the typical scenario is to offer channel partners deep discounts at
the end of the quarter as an incentive
to take on the additional inventory.

Reuters would like everyone to believe the economy is causing the recent rash
of tech warnings and nothing could
be farther from the truth. The combination of SAB 101 and the implementation of
the "Fair Disclosure" rule (see:
http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7881.htm ) have changed a lot of things.
Probably for the better. Companies can
no longer give their favorite analyst guidance ahead of the rest of the market,
which has historically amounted to
legalized insider trading. What you're seeing right now is panic being spread
by the analyst community in order to
create buying opportunities for themselves. Since they can no longer depend on
insider trading to give themselves
an edge in the market, they now need to look for absurdly under valued
situations to leave plenty of room for
upside potential. Of course, cutting their ratings, or lowering estimates that
were too high in the first place in order to push the bottom a little lower
always helps too.

There was an interesting article in the WSJ Friday related to the performance
of value funds in 2000. From what I've seen, it's the usual reaction to a
market meltdown in over valued momentum plays.

I'm not sure if I can look at a stock trading at 25 times earnings as a value
play, but it's a lot better than MSFT trading at 80 times earnings. My opinion
is that there are a lot of companies right now trading at PEs well below 10, or
so far below book value, that they will double a lot sooner than will MSFT. One
thing I can say in Microsoft's favor is that SAB 101 didn't appear to have much
affect on earnings, which suggests to me a more ethical approach to revenue
recognition and channel distribution.

Those news agencies such as Reuters which have been hammering the market with
FUD about recession for the last three months strike me as being irresponsible
to a degree that defies reason. Since these are supposedly market savvy
organizations, it seems unlikely they are unaware of SAB 101 or its affect on
reported revenues. I've found Reuters to be a highly reliable contrarian
indicator of what to buy and what not to buy. If Reuters likes a sector, it's
probably time to exit any positions in that area. If Reuters hates a sector,
it's time to accumulate a position.

Bob,

If I'm reading SAB 101 correctly, I don't think it would apply to burial
contracts. Sort of along the lines that a person doesn't have to live in a
house in order to buy or sign a contract to buy real estate. The product has
basically been delivered to the end user and isn't available for sale to anyone
else.

I've been spot checking earnings warnings over the past several months, and
most of them seem to be related to channel issues or in some cases where
revenue should have been recognized on a percentage of completion basis rather
than all at once. I think most companies tend to put product into distribution
channels at a rate that matches sell through, but there are also quite a few
who abuse the practice. From what I've seen, it looks like it'll be a one
quarter event, then revenue numbers will move to something more reliable going
forward. I also think it will tend to cure some of the problems similar to what
disk drive manufacturers went through a few years ago and what PC manufactures
go through about once a year. At least it should take away some of the
incentive to over produce to the point that inventory gets too far ahead of
sell through.

TwoBear, shouldn't be too hard to set up such a portfolio for recent stocks
mentioned here. I'm attuned to the ones that I'm interested in, so there's LR,
GTSI, and BAMM that would be on my list that are recent. I don't have HBI, but
that's been recently posted on and a likely 3-fer.
Maybe TXT (with Fred Andrews and me and maybe one more????) If Blue Voodoo who
posted on KEM recently, actually bought, and if he could be considered a value
investor (only one post here, it seems), then KEM should be included --I &
Grommit have positions - although I'm just guessing Grommit's still in. (Aside:
apologies Grommit, others if I sound presumptuous: I just assume in this post
that value plays require time to work out, so buyers are holders-- of course I
have no idea of anybody's personal circumstances - i.e. sales made for tax
purposes, or to capture quick gains, or for better opportunities.)

I'm willing to bet we've got at least 3 people who are still in some stocks
mentioned last year that haven't been discussed here in a while - CMH, MAXS,
DNB, GMT, MCO. Maybe also SKO, GCI, WNC, ABS. Probably also EBSC - that's one -
maybe the only - of the few big losers (so far, imo). Twister's VCLK written up
by Mike Burry has at least three buyers here, I would guess. There was some
thread interest in MTW (Grommit and I had positions; I still do and I again
assume Grommit's still in.)

Plus there're all those home builder stocks (Horton?, Kaufman and Broad?,
Standard Pacific? And Huttig?? others?)that were talked about. And maybe the
bond insurers - MBIA and/or Ambac?? And I've possibly overlooked some of the
other recent picks by RJM, that might've got 3 thread buyers here.

Gee, it might be more difficult to keep such a list than I first believed. The
above stocks are just ones that I can recall readily, there must be more. Plus
they're mostly the one's I've been interested in, and so there's got to be
other stocks that other groups of three people have and that I've overlooked
here.

We could maybe simplify things by starting now only with the recent picks -
that'd give readers an idea of some of the stocks. But the performance takes
some time to develop, imo, so the portfolio performance record at year end
might not show a representative number of winners. Especially all those winners
which would not be included in the 2001 list that were picked in '98 or '99 or
'00 that had finally achieved fair value in 2001.

Need your ideas on this, TwoBear. (and other interested parties)
