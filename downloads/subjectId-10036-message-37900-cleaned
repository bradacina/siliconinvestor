As a DOD person, what I'm seeing is that you are correct in as much as it is
actually Government Contractors who are purchasing materials from HWG. The
contracts are largely pre-negotiated fixed price type and pose little risk for
HWG as the fabric supplier to prime contractors. They are also becoming larger
higher dollar value contracts with Buy American clauses. Ballistic resistant
vests for example are pretty special.

OT I made two bad mistakes this week in terms of investing. In one case I made
an intitial investment without enough due dilligence. In another I added to a
position again without doing enough due diligence checking for changes in the
situation. Now I am kicking myself. I attribute this to lack of an organized
method for reviewing materials. They were smaller positions and I didnt do
enough checking of facts vis a vis current prices and reading negative views of
the shares. I feel like Im spreading myself too thin in terms of owning so many
stocks, I just cant give them all the attention they need. Does anyone have a
specific methodology they would like to share as far as the due diligence they
go through and follow up?

EKS. Selling. As they say, there's more art to it than in the buying decision.

Here are some stocks I sold this year, and the reasons I sold. Not saying in
looking back now that the reasons were really the reasons -- possibly with me,
emotional selling at the time was a significant factor.

Gave up waiting: WNMLA, ROYL, RHJIF, NUHC, GNRG, DK, AMGN

Gave up -- unexpected corporate situation change: TTO, RIG, FUQI

Gave up -- lost confidence, told myself I saw better opp elsewhere in sector:
TPC, JNJ, COP, BK.

Turned into being a trading/gambling stock for me: XOM, TNP, AMR, VZ, VMI.
(Achh. Maybe I believed it was an investment when I made my first
buys...somehow that changed though.)

Stock drops. Forgot why I would own it: BR, SPAR, MON

Met my original valuation criteria reasons for buying, and I saw no compelling
reason to sell or buy at the price after that: BEN, HNZ, FTE, PNY. (Made
partial sales.)
Some preferred issues: yields okay, but limited price appreciation after
approaching call price. Sold positions.
LTC, AZN: (Out. Held through rise. Decided I don't know what I own at the
price. Sold.)
SKX: (Sold most. A net-net I kept after it hit price target. After becoming 6-7
bagger though, impatience/nerves set in.)

Fear of giving up gains(ABT, CONN) Fear of continued losses (either mine or the
company's): (BAX, MON). Fear of situation change (e.g. oil prices): APC,
COSWF,JBX

Received buyout offers: HDNG, HBRF, CDSCY, ACL etc.

LSBRX: My outsize bond portfolio position. Trimmed.

====================
I don't care about being stuck in an out-of-favor sector. For me, my situation,
I don't need to have every dollar in max alignment to make max gains. Rather,
I'm okay with having some money in a sector that goes nowhere. Which I view as
a big positive for me just if the stocks I have there don't lose money. Plus, I
figure sectors rotate, and out-of-favor can become more favorable.

I know going into net-nets I have to consider I might have to hold the stock
2-5 years. I tell myself I'm okay with 3 years. Five years...likely not. For
typical value plays, reversion-to-mean, etc. maybe 1.5 to 3 years is what I
guess I might have allow for holding. For investing in large-scale corporate
cultural change, my experience is it can take 8 years to complete, but I would
like to see positive stock results within about 3 years. For growth stocks
(e.g. Nestle, I guess), as I allude, the inheritors of my estate will perhaps
make the sell decision.
OTOH, I respond to the emotional aspects of being in the market, and if I
succumb, I can, will, and do sell.

My top 10-ish positions in no particular order: GPOR, COPJF, FR-J, IGK/ISF/IDG,
NRF-B, RINO, UEPS.

New positions: EBIX, HRBN, UVIC, FRX
Positions increased: RINO, NRF-A/B, NEWN, LTUS, IGK, MAIL, TXIC, NE, RIG, CF,
CEU, CSGH, FRX, GRVY, UEPS, NOK, GFRE, SPU, CPBY, GEOI, WH, CBEH, GILD
Positions reduced: GRMN, RIG
Positions eliminated: NBG-A, MUR

With a lot of volatility in past couple weeks, I average-increased a lot of
positions:
- Income (IGK, NRF-A/B). IGK dropped during Euro panic and subsequently
recovered. NRF-A/Bs are dropping presumably on risk avoidance.
- Chinese (RINO, NEWN, LTUS, TXIC, CEU, CSGH, GFRE, SPU, CPBY, WH, CBEH). So
far only WH has reported very bad results, but the company is also trading at
very cheap valuation. Others have not announced any bad news although dilution
(NEWN, GFRE), huge A/Rs (CPBY) and unclear sources of financing for expansion
(LTUS) have to be taken into account when investing. Some companies have not
reported 2010 Q1 or even 2009 annual results (TXIC) yet.
- Oil (NE, RIG - traded in and out due to oil spill news, GEOI, WH, CBEH).
After some consideration sold MUR and bought more GEOI instead.
- Other positions: MAIL, CF, GRVY, UEPS, NOK, GILD. Mostly no big news with old
(known) risks and possibilities.

I also established new positions in EBIX - Bruwin long-time favorite which is
trading somewhat cheap now. The attraction and issues were discussed in
Bruwin's thread ( http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26530489 ).
UVIC - microcap that moved from Canadian listing to OB board. Still somewhat
cheap based on past results although royalty expiration is coming in the
future. It seems that management is shareholder friendly. HRBN has reported
great results and I decided to dip a toe into the water. FRX is another
exploratory position that probably won't be increased. However, I decided to
watch it closer by being an owner of some shares.

In terms of sales, GRMN's issues have been discussed a lot. It is attractive if
someone decided to take it over, but overall GPS market is becoming very
competitive. RIG is also very cheap, but headline risk is getting worse so far.
NBG-A is not cheap enough for another bout of Greece issues. I decided that
MUR's refineries are not worth holding for me.

Yes, more details about this might be helpful, Madharry.

You say you made two bad mistakes this week, because you didn't do enough dd.
By bad mistakes, that would mean you lost money, I presume? So you bought two
stocks, they went down in value quickly after the purchases, you looked closer
and realized you didn't see the something that would cause the stocks to fall
further. Something that you could have anticipated if you had done more dd
beforehand? Two stocks both dropping suddenly for a specific reason--- I have
to assume you are looking at controversial stocks, maybe trying to catch
falling knife type stuff?

One thing is if you post your picks here or maybe on SI's stock-specific
threads before or after you buy, and ask for opinions on them, sometimes people
will reply and give an insight or observation or additional dd that can
influence your decision -- possibly prevent you from incurring losses. Just my
experience.

Re: Selling

Good overview. I still hold a few of those you sold. One of my best bets was
adding to my COP. My initial buy was 10/31/07 at $85.00! I added a few shares
with one buy in 2008 and seven more buys in 2009. It's now my No 1 position in
the portfolio. I initially bought because Buffet owned it and the Mc Dep report
had it as one of their most undervalued integrated oil plays. Then Buffet began
selling his position and then the 2009 crash. I peeled off some shares from XOM
and CVX during that period (lucky it was close to their highs) and moved the
money into COP. COP raised their dividend and this year sold some assets (some
oil sands property) that went to pay down debt. COP is now ranked as the No. 3
integrated oil company and my once loosing position has been averaged down to a
good core position (w/ low cost basis) that yields a pretty good stable
dividend with a growth kicker. It's still 40% undervalued according to the most
recent MC Dep report (New McDep report as of 3/30/2010 Lower ConocoPhillips NPV
to $95 from $105: http://www.mcdep.com/mr100330.pdf ).

Otherwise, my main criteria for keeping or selling (other than a lot of the
items you mentioned) is current PE and forward PE. I want <u>BOTH</u> to be
below the S&P consensus PE ( The normal PE ratio for the S&P 500 over the past
80 years is close to 15 -
http://seekingalpha.com/article/189705-s-p-500-a-20-rise-in-2010 ). I want to
see the forward PE dropping as revenues increase. PE's below 12-13 I will keep,
my holds should pay me some type of dividend (w/ few exceptions like FLR), LT
debt s/b no more than 3x revenues (my new Buffet rule) or it becomes a possible
sell and I want to see innovation and/or small divisions with extra ordinary
grow. This shows me that management encourages new business development (the
company is always evolving trying different things). Many times these small
divisions get pretty big, are spun off to the shareholders or sold and add
significant value to the company.

Finally, I want to see long term debt fall over time and look for the company
to use extra cash to buy up treasury stock from time to time.

For example E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Com (NYSE: DD) a new position I started
in 2008 ( a top 10 holding) is up 45% from my buys in 2008 but I think I will
still hold on. Forward PE falling now at 12.6, Qtrly revenue growth (YOY) up
22%, LT debt 2.6x revenues, 9 dividend increases over last 16 years and still
yields 4.3% (w/ falling payout ratio of 62%).

Yesterday they announced a minority stake in a Chinese chemical company (DuPont
to buy minority stake in Chinese chem maker - DuPont to buy minority stake in
Chinese chemical maker for an undisclosed sum
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/DuPont-to-buy-minority-stake-apf-3963158833.html?
=0&.v=1 ).

So, I can only conclude that DuPont's China strategy is still playing out. In
fact, they continue to invest in other local industry businesses which should
contribute to their future revenues.

My main reason for buying in 2008 was the expansion of a new manufacturing
facility in China for their new Solar Cell technology.

DuPont Apollo Ltd. Opens Thin-Film Photovoltaic Production Facility

http://www2.dupont.com/Photovoltaics/en_US/news_events/article20091117.html

From the article:"...China, Nov. 17, 2009 - DuPont Apollo Ltd., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of DuPont, announced the opening of its silicon based thin-film
photovoltaic module manufacturing facility...."

"...The 538,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility will have an annual capacity of
up to 50 megawatts with a thin-film-on-glass photovoltaic module production
line. Full-scale commercial production is targeted for the first quarter 2010.
In addition to providing innovative thin-film photovoltaic modules that are
fully International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) certified, DuPont Apollo
offers a total system solution focused on the China domestic market to help
safeguard customers’ long-term investments in renewable power generation...."

=================================================================

Selling strategies continue to be difficult for me. Do you peel off shares and
scale out of a position or just move on with an out right sale? I never want to
let the big bagger get away by selling way too early. However, there are
several times I have suffered the consequences for holding on too long when the
appropriate thing to have done was to close out the position and just hit the
sell button.

"Selling strategies continue to be difficult for me. Do you peel off shares and
scale out of a position or just move on with an out right sale?"

Tough for all of us. You may have heard this before from someplace...

a. I try to ask myself, if I did not already own the stock, would I buy it?
(although tax implications may impact the answer, there have been a few times
where I avoided a gain to save taxes, only to see the gain evaporate. Stupid!)

b. If I cannot decide to sell or not, sell 1/2 (or 1/3). At least you will be
1/2 right.

c. I sell stocks that have gone up easier than selling those that have dropped.
Mainly because I believe in the concept that undervalued stocks will recover.

d. Never look back.

But I seem to usually sell when something better comes along. For example I
have been frequently peeling off shares of GOV to buy other reits that have
lower PE and therefore higher upside potential (more price safety). OHI and MPW
come to mind. Also have been selling AHT-A and FR-K to buy OHI-D, and giving up
a bit of yield for a lot of safety.

Here's a puzzle. Sold my RIG in january, but kept DO. Kicking myself for not
selling DO on the rig sinking. But not really kicking myself because it made no
sense to sell because they claimed there was no oil leak. Unsure what to do
now.

FYI Bought more NXY on friday.

Yes, I almost always make partial sales rather than all-at-once exits --- with
stocks where I have more than exploratory positions. FMX, a few sales over
several years, and finally out after three more sales this year. I made nine
sales of ABT over three months this year before completely closing out my
holdings. GOV about nine sales over two months. Otoh though, there were three
sales of RIG over only about three days before completely exiting that one.

I usually do post my picks i didnt in this case because it was not clear that
they were value stocks. one i just bought on friday. it may still work out, i
just dont feel i did enough due diligence going in, and i didnt pick up that
there was a credit line modification since the information i based my buying
decision on was released. It also turns out that there are some credibility
issues regarding management. The bottom line is my decision to purchase was not
as well researched and thought out as I would have liked. Name of the company
is KSP its an MLP thats stopped paying a dividend. So the price is way down
from when it did pay a dividend. The hope is that the business improves enough
that they can resume paying dividends.

The other one I dont even want to go into as I got so much wrong about it that
its embarassing. For example, the release quoted various prices that were no
longer relevant as they had changed so rapidly, but i failed to verify the
prices at the time independent from the filing. The good news on that one is
that after i did more research the situation on it is not nearly as bleak as i
had feared, so I am hopeful that that one will work out pretty well over time.

However as a result of these missteps ive decided to develop a formal
worksheet/checklist to make sure that i cover all my bases before stepping in
like this again.

Hi Paul -

RE: My new Buffet rule. "LT debt s/b no more than 3x revenues (my new Buffet
rule)"

I recently finished reading his book titled "Warren BUFFET and the
Interpretation of Financial Statements - The Search for the Company with a
Durable Competitive Advantage" last month.
http://books.google.com/books?id=7iqO6rGdrAYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Warren+Buf

=result&resnum=2&ved=0CA4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false

He has a section in it regarding company debt.

Basically he prefers companies with little long term debt and discusses several
reasons why this can burden a company and their profitability.

As with any rule, there are exceptions but I wanted to make sure that my long
term holds reflected this criteria. Over on the "SI Fundamental Analysis" Board
there is a posting called the BUFFETT’S COMPANY ANALYSIS TEMPLATE. It
summarizes several of Buffets analysis criteria similar to what his book does
in much more detail.

http://siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=26423391

There is going to be swings from deflation to inflation with the huge amounts
of Global debit recently created (ie 1 Trillion backstop of the Euro last
week). A company with a large debt load could be significantly affected at the
margin with ever increasing interest rates. It's better to be safe and sell
those companies that utilize large amounts of debt (compared to their sales) to
grow their company. It's an added risk in this environment IMO that should be
avoided.

I now scan all my new buys and potential sells with this simple financial rule
- <u> "LT debt s/b no more than 3x revenues"</u>.

re Buffet rule - why would debt/ revenue ratio be a good indicator? I would
propose EBITDA/Debt ratio. Debt/revenue is misleading - you could get the same
ratio with an extremely low margin (wholesale) and an extremely high margin

all, while the former would sink.

Hello Madharry,

Well, I realize we're talking generalities here, but one thing that helps me is
to generally have the first position I take in a given stock be pretty small.
More of a tracking position. For me, that would be something ~ 1% of my
portfolio.

At this point, I'd have to have enough info for me to think that the stock
could substantially appreciate over the next year. Therefore, without a
position I have fear that I'm going to miss gains. But, I don't want to take a
position of too large of a size either because I may not know all of the issues
surrounding the stock. So, I take a position that is small, but enough to
affect my portfolio if the stock would make a big run, but where I'm almost
hoping that the stock goes down in the next 1-6 months so I could have a chance
to buy at a better price assuming I don't get negative information about the
stock in the meantime.

Once I have this tracking position, and I'm almost indifferent as to whether
the stock goes up or down in the short-term, then I can pay more attention to
the stock to see if I should add.

I think the tougher question is to decide when to add and commit more funds.
Sometimes I do this after a few months, sometimes after a year or so (in the
case of FVE recently, for example). I guess I basically just need to feel that
the stock is still seriously undervalued and I need to capitalize on that by
adding.

Not sure if this helps, but just my two cents.

Hi Spekulatius - My mistake on the Buffet rule. I should have stated "Net
earnings" rather than "Revenues".

Long Term Debt should be less than 3 x Annual NET EARNINGS, not Revenues

I was informed by an SI lurker that "Warren's historic purchases indicate that
on any given year the company should have sufficient Yearly NET EARNINGS to pay
off all of its long-term debt within a three to four year EARNINGS period.".

Using the 3x-4x Annual Net Earnings >= to LT Debt excludes even more of my
stock candidates.

A lot of my value companies still seem to have a much higher than acceptable
amount of debt. It's definitely a metric I am going to pay more attention to in
the future.

Your suggestion to look at the EBITDA/Debt ratio is a good one too.

Brings up what the main purpose of rules is. To find stocks? (Screen?) To value
stocks?

(Just rhetorical questions)

All rules have exceptions, as you say. Pabrai has written he has a checklist he
goes through for each stock he's considering buying, and no stock has yet got
positive checks on every item.

I just like to keep it simple, in order that I don't get constricted and either
find no stocks that meet requirements or else have to make a number of
judgments as to which requirements/when are okay to be violated. So something
like an encompassing "Buffett checklist" is not for me.

I'll not use debt/revenue as a screening requirement.
It's a positive though, as I've suggested here many times, that people judge
value in different ways and with different weightings. So that when several
people do agree on a stock as a value buy, and do buy it, then I can generally
conclude, it's likely to actually be a value (assuming it also meets my value
criteria -g-), given it's looked at from several perspectives.

I like low p/e for a value screening parameter. (Who doesn't?) I don't have an
arbitrary screening requirement (like your S&P p/e); I rather compare a stock
to itself over many years, and if I can, the particular company's p/e to the
sector p/e, both current and historical. That said, looking quickly over my
portfolios, I find most stocks well below 15 p/e. Fwiw, it looks like most p/e
> 15 are, for me, in these categories: limited partnerships, health care, money
managers, foreign banks, auto retailers, tech.

FVE...potential merger with SNH (I hold small position in FVE)...from their 8K:

May 12, 2010

TO: The Board of Directors
Five Star Quality Care, Inc.

FROM:
The Board of Trustees
Senior Housing Properties Trust

The purpose of this letter is to begin a dialogue between Five Star Quality
Care, Inc. (“FVE”) and Senior Housing Properties Trust (“SNH”).

As you know, FVE was formerly a 100% owned subsidiary of SNH which was
distributed to SNH shareholders on December 31, 2001. The primary motivation
for this distribution was the laws which then made it impossible for a real
estate investment trust (a “REIT”) to have the profits and losses of health
care property operations. For tax years beginning in 2009, these laws were
changed to permit REITs to receive the financial results of health care
facilities’ operations, as well as rents from those operations, provided these
results are received by a taxable REIT subsidiary (a “TRS”).

Also, as you know, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has recently
been enacted. We believe this new law will significantly change the marketplace
for healthcare services such as those provided at properties owned by SNH which
are leased by FVE, including possible reduced payment rates for Medicare and
Medicaid services.

Because of the aforesaid tax law changes and because of the uncertainties
created by recent changes in the market for healthcare services, including
expected Medicare and Medicaid rate changes, we believe now may be the right
time for SNH and FVE to consider (i) changing one or more of the existing
leases between SNH (as lessor) and FVE (as lessee) to a management arrangement
between an SNH owned TRS and FVE, (ii) possibly combining FVE into a SNH owned
TRS, or (iii) taking other actions to change the contractual arrangements
between SNH and FVE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We request that the FVE Board consider appointing a committee of FVE
Independent Directors to meet with a committee of the SNH’s Independent
Trustees to consider these matters further.

We look forward to your response.

DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS
Suggested (minimum) checklist for thoroughly researching a company:
o Annual reports / 10-K’s – five years (including those of competitors). Read
the footnotes.
o 10-Q’s and Proxy Statements – one year, including transcripts of earnings
calls (include those of competitors). Seeking Alpha is a good source of
transcripts.
o Build a 10-year spreadsheet on the company, by operating segment if
applicable. Don’t rely on third party sources for anything more than
preliminary research. Going to primary sources will not only ensure the data’s
accuracy, but also force you to think about the numbers and what they mean.
o All available relevant articles in the business trades and press. In addition
to the general Internet (Google, Bing, etc.), many libraries offer excellent
free online databases, such as Proquest.
o Build a database of all relevant private market transactions (minimum 5
years).
o Compare relevant valuation metrics for company to those of competitors (P/S,
P/B, P/E, EV/EBIT, EV/EBITA, P/(Owner Earnings). Include an analysis of any
industry specific metric, for example, ROA for banks.
o Study who owns the stock (and who doesn't). (You may be able to find
information on the company in reports and letters of quality institutional
investors that own the stock.) Are insiders buying or selling? Do they have
"skin in the game"? What about the directors?

These guys are pretty aggressive imo. they have bought quite a few assets (coal

Hi Spekulatius: One of the reasons I started to build a position in Nobel Group
was their large annual dividend. It appears they just pay it in extra shares
issued. I guess this works as long as they continue their double digit growth.

I do get charged by my broker a fixed flat fee of $15.00 each time I receive
new shares (ie buying new shares or receiving "script"). Therefore, I hope I
earn enough in new script to cover my brokerage fees.

Noble Group off 37%; trades ex-bonus, dividend
http://www.theedgesingapore.com/component/content/15766.html?task=view
Noble Group (N21.SG) gaps down at opening, last off 37% at 10-month low of

Still, pullback may be good time for investors hopeful of Noble's long-term
prospects to start accumulating as fundamentals remain sound, evident in recent

I won't cover the points I agree with. As I said before, there are a lot of
good questions in the list.

Things I disagree with - Part 1.

o What can go wrong?
o Where could I lose capital? What are my odds of losing capital?
o How might I lose my entire investment?

It might be possible to list "what can go wrong". Companies do that already in
their 10Ks. The problem is that most of the things are purely theoretical and
impossible to evaluate. The question of "What are my odds of losing capital?"
is pretty useless, because it implies that one can have some kind of
scientifically calculated probability of potential losses. In real world this
is impossible and IMHO an attempt of it is close to worthless. What are the
odds that tomorrow someone discovers that PG's (
http://www.pg.com/en_US/brands/index.shtml ) Pampers or Tampax lead to cancer
and the company goes BK in huge lawsuit? Is it really productive use of one's
time to consider that?

Sure, a rig explosion for RIG is a much higher probability than PGs cancerous
Tampax. But how much? 10 times? 100? 1000? 10000? Where would you draw a line?

This becomes even more complicated for multibrand/multisegment companies that
may be affected by laws, regulations, etc.

On the other hand, single brand/sector companies might be easier to analyze,
but the risk of a single product being found faulty or being sidelined by a
competitor is much higher too.

I would like to see someone produce a usable evaluation of some company using
the 3 questions above. I don't talk about evaluating close-to-basket-cases like
GM (last year), BAC/C (last year), where it's easy to say "omg, these guys are
close to BK, I could lose all my money if I invested, I'm not even gonna look
at them". I am talking about any company that is standing on solid footing with
no obvious BK in sight. Would you (or someone else) be able to produce useful
answers for the questions above for JNJ? EBIX? GEOI? or any companies from your
portfolio?

I once worked where we said we measured with a micrometer, marked with a piece
of chalk, then cut with an axe. For investing, I just start with the axe and
don't try to fine tune.

Let's look at the two most recent that I brought to the board:

EDAC...recent acquisitions should have a significant impact, but they appear to
have all been distress sales...if EDAC can't manage them better, I'd expect a
huge value/price drop, and I estimated this at 20% likelihood. I bet 30% that
there will be minor earnings from these, and 50% at the original EDAC's margins
which should result in a gain of 100% or so. What else may go wrong?...they may
be distracted by more acquisitions and lose focus. I'm watching this closely
and I'm more concerned now than when I originally posted, especially since I've
lost some measure of safety with the price increase.

GLUX...they are heavily dependent on government subsidies, and I gave these a
10% shot of being lost, and this would probably BK them. I think the other 90%
offers a gain of 50% or so in the next year. Average those out for an expected
gain of about 35%.

These are both NOT sure things, so they're the kind where you need to hold 20
or more to diversify, so I limit each to 2% of my portfolio.

OK, in terms of "starting with an axe and not fine tuning" I will agree that
these are somewhat useful questions. They become more useful the closer one
gets to distressed investing, where BK/major lawsuit/permanent impairment of
assets or business model are possible/likely. I'd lie if I said that I never
bought things in the distressed investing categories. I guess these questions
would be useful for me to mark something as distressed investment, not to
invest there OR invest and follow it more closely and not to get outsized
positions unless the issues can be clearly resolved.

My objections were mostly about using them as a "micrometer". :)

re Seth Klarman - i think a lot of things that he talks about are really fat

politician are likely to kick the can down the road, as long as the can allows
this to happen. Given the fact that most voters in the US are illiterate in
terms of finances, there is not real incentive to cut deficits. At one point,
we could end up in a runaway situation where things spiral out of control -
higher interest rates make it harder to pay for the public debt, which causes
higher interest rates - a positive feedback loop that will cause a significant
meltdown.

I think that risk is very real but we have a few years to go until then.

re Noble Group NOBGF - kind of volatile lately - trading at 1.17 today -10%.
From the news, it seems like the issue 6 new shares for every 11 old ones plus
a dividend. Excluding the dividend, that would mean that each new share is
worth 0.647x the old ones (11/17). It seems that the stock has trades
inefficient on the first ex day (too high) and now has fallen (as the whole
market did).

Has anyone run the valuation # (PE, P/B) for Noble? I know that the balance

Hi Spekulatius -
re Noble Group NOBGF

I originally bought shares in the company because of their diverse business
(many different logistic segments) located around the world. Only until
recently have they owned the resources they moved but rather added value
throughout the distribution chain by processing the commodities. To finance
many of their acquisitions they used equity and debt.

When the China sovereign fund made a 20 percent equity investment ( about $1B),
I increased my position. With these new monies, they have been buying the
"hard" natural resource assets (coal mine in Australia, farm land in Brazil)
and selling the commodities in China using long term contract commitments.

It's difficult to analyze their different business segments as their reports
are not very comprehensive, in foreign currencies and difficult to calculate
per share figures (they appear to have many different classes of stock).

When I reviewed their operations (about 8 months ago), their PE was around 10
and they had paid a dividend equivalent to 10% annually (paid in stock). Is
this a ponzi type scheme? Perhaps but their businesses are making money and
growing.

There is a small red flag as their class of stock has changed, dividends paid
in "script" and it's hard to view their long term history etc. My position is
small (less than 1% of portfolio) but I do like their main customer (China),
all the different business segments they operate and the huge sovereign fund
investor.

From Wikipedia - Nobel Group
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Group
"...Noble Group Limited (SGX: N21) is a global commodities trading/supply chain
manager of agricultural, industrial and energy products. Noble manages a
diversified portfolio of essential raw materials, integrating the sourcing,
marketing, processing, financing and transportation.

With 2008 revenues of US$36.1 billion, Noble continues its transition to owning
and managing more strategic assets, sourcing from low cost producers such as
Brazil, Australia and Indonesia and supplying to high growth demand markets
including China, India and the Middle East. Noble owns coal and iron ore mines,
grain crushing facilities, sugar and ethanol plants, vessels, ports and other
infrastructure.

In 2008, Noble debuted on the Fortune Global 500 (#349), was included in the
new 30 security Straits Times Index, gained a top ten placing in the ACCA/CFO
Asia "Regional Corporate Transparency Index (CTI)” and received a BBB- rating
(investment grade) from Fitch. Noble was placed on the Forbes Global 2000 and
Forbes Fab 50 while being included in the S&P Global Challengers and The
Asset's Best 60 Corporate Governance Award. Noble also received the Corporate
Governance Recognition Award: Classes Of 2006 - 2008 - by Corporate Governance
Asia and was chosen as one of FinanceAsia's Best Companies. In 2005, Noble
joined the MSCI Singapore Index. During this period, the Group was recognized
as one of BusinessWeek's Stars of Asia and a Best Employer by Hewitt
Associates.[citation needed]..."
===============================================================

Because the shares trade on the pink sheets, you can get inefficiencies. I use
my Ameritrade to buy shares. They charge a foreign company stock transfer fee
of $15/per trade along w/ their standard trading fee. Shares are bought on the
Singapore exchange and transferred to my Ameritrade account (that's the $15
fee). Through Schwab Global it's way too expensive almost 8% to buy 8% to sell
along with currency exchange fees (w/ minimum fee of $250/trade).

The annual stock dividend will be my first. I will know better how it worked
out when I can see the total payout and measure my net return based on my cost
basis (w/ fees). This is one you want to accumulate on significant dips and
sell in 3-4 years perhaps for a double, Yes, I have compared it to my BHP
(similar growth potential) but with that hazy Chinese accounting.

I'm partial to Bakken oil plays, and I favor MDU for a somewhat conservative
way to play the development of this area.

MDU has a subsidiary that acquires Bakken land, and explores for oil/gas there
and other areas. I hold several companies that do that.

However, what makes MDU more conservative (maybe) than other e&p companies with
Bakken properties or small-cap e&p's focused solely on Bakken, is that:

MDU has a natural gas pipeline network in the Bakken.

MDU has a construction business and an asphalt/aggregate/concrete business that
might, maybe, prosper with build-out of the Bakken, if that area does develop
the potential that maybe exists there.

MDU has utility operations (serves, according to Yahoo "... approximately
122,000 residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal electric customers
in 177 communities; and approximately 829,000 residential, commercial, and
industrial natural gas customers in 333 communities."

MDU is not only a Bakken play. It has operations in TX, CO, LA and offshore
GOM.

MDU provides me a dividend while waiting. $.63/$18.00 = 3.5%, at today's price.
"Dividend increased in November 2009, marking the 19th consecutive year of
dividend increases", according to MDU website.

With such great returns on equity and the way sales seem to be increasing, this

While the stock might meet some criteria for a value buy, given the recent drop

Ha! Yes, Madharry, it does seem to me like it's the best time this decade to
buy stocks.

(This decade started in January, right?)

As people avoid the stock market, and as market participants sell and go to
cash, it seems to me that many businesses will continue to deliver needed and
desirable goods and services to people in our industrialized countries and/or
in the growing emerging and frontier markets too. These companies, especially
the largest corporations, have talent and resources, and from what I read in
the media, pretty solid balance sheets (debt under control). And now these
companies seem to be selling at low prices. Low, relative to what they've sold
at previously.

While stock profits this year may have evaporated, the year isn't over yet.
Perhaps by December we may may recoup. I am hoping so, but fearful. Still, I
buy.

Very disheartening to me to see and hear of the fall and maybe break up or
break down of the Euro. Somehow, people and corporations will survive. I am
betting on it. And hoping of course that it's not surviving at a much lower
stock price level than we've been seeing.

Every day people go to work to improve their lives and that of their families.
And through that, improve the businesses that employ them. Given this, and
government policies (inflation/stimulus), we know that the market has an upward
bias.

The stock market seems to me to offer up some obviously good values now. That's
scary when it's obvious, because I've found what seems obvious to me is often
wrong. Nevertheless, I continue to buy.

My only thing on IDCC as i have looked at it further, it seems to be of course
priced in a range, and if it does not show an ability to grow out of it with
some solid year over year EPS %change it will probably be stuck in that range,
i am looking at the chart now and it does not pay a dividend, and this would
seem to expose it to some pressure if/when the market rolls over... sounds bad
until you look at the cash per share number, while the lack of dividend exposes
to pressure from the market IMHO, it will gain support at those key long term
levels where cash will keep it afloat even without a dividend yield to protect
it.

i want to know if it can get some actual tangible growth, not just the quick
glance cost cutting they seemed to have made in 2009, if not i would like it
between 19-21 possibly.

If i could project any long term EPS growth, it would be interesting to start
getting in, but i just dont see it.

I also wonder why they dont pay a dividend, and it doesn't seem like they are
spending dumping the cash on R&D

What in your opinion or others opinion to the possible risk to V? Regulation

V at quick glance just feels like no mans land at this price if your looking

But my years of experience ( i am a 21 year old college student haha jk

RE: Fluor Corporation Common Stock (NYSE: FLR)

Closed out my FLR position. Booked my profit (what's left of it -Ug!) and have
been using the proceeds to buy many other "new" value buys. Also peeled off
some shares of SHAW for same reason.

Better than equal chance of double dip recession IMO and time to take my
infrastructure "stimulus" stocks off the table (at least cut back
significantly). I did not want to lose my profit to date on these and with the
recent sell off, many more of my LT value buys are on sale again. Most are down
almost 10% and better yet, their relative PE's are now nicely in my BUY zone
(11 PE or less).

I am expecting a more sustained sell off in the next few trading days as we
test the S&P 500 200 day SMA. Eventually, we should end out the other side to
the upside again but this sell off needs to shake out more sellers. Generally
we over correct and I expect this time it will be no different.

I will be deploying new monies based on a new corollary theme in the NG sector
that I have been studying. The key to these value buys are companies that have
a better than average "low" debt profile, are committed to shareholder
dividends, can maintain their pricing power even in a low growth environment
and are the industry leader in their sector.

I also have one company in the group that should benefit from a lower and/or
falling EURO. It's time to look at investment themes that benefit from moderate
domestic GDP growth (limited expansion from stimulus monies), a falling EURO,
and sectors that are not impacted by new government regulations (ie. financial,
off shore drilling etc.).

Stay Tuned . . .

Well.... i agree with ya, but why on earth would V be bouncing on flailing
volume in the middle of a correction with so much risk surrounding a single
equity, not just market risk? its neither at a suitable value play or a
momentum play considering the 23% correction so quickly, or well the momentum
has come to a screaming hault, IMHO.

i dont mean to be general, but i dont know why its getting a bounce like it is
that is sustainable. When i think technical support these institutions are

re GS - I agree that book value should be a good point to start a position in
GS. I expect more bad new and potentially a criminal suit. I also expect the
reform package to have a significant impact on how entities like GS will
operate in the future.

I am sort of betting that bread and butter small banks will not only be
unscathed but profit from the large players being ham-stringed by legislation.
In addition they are cheap. I have sold some marginal bank stocks but added a
little here and there to higher quality names. I am surprised that those have
barely been affected at all during the recent selloff, I hoped for some
firesales but those did not happen. I think it's a great time to be in the
banking business when your house is in order. Lot's of opportunities to take
over weak competitors and/or expand while competition is retreating. I think we
may see a total of 1000 failed banks (or forced mergers, recapitalizations) out
of the almost 8000 banks in the US before the current crisis is over.

GS is absurdly cheap when you consider that they have billions under management
which at the time i think i calculated to be worth $16 a share easily. They
have demonstrated earnings power of $20 a year and probably will make at least
$5 for the qtr ending 6/30/10. Assuming the US govt doesnt cut off its nose to
spite its face, it will come to the realization that at this point in time the
last thing they need to do is pass regulations that will curtail lending and
stop the formation of new domestic businesses. I think there is a high
probability that within a year GS sells for close to $200. that would make it
around 10x earnings and 1.5 times adjusted capital. Alternatively we just slide
into a deep recession as credit markets seize, stock markets decline, and real
estate prices drop sharply as more and more banks get taken over by the fed.
while Obama and the incumbents go around pointing fingers at the financiers,

Madharry - just be careful with stock "rentals". ATPG is a great high octane
(beta) trading vehicle but this stuff can get crushed in an extended selloff
due to their immense debt load.

I actually traded GFRE a bit today and made some dime (sold out the position
bought earlier for a small profit). GFRE looks cheap and has a good balance
sheet now (net cash) but I am not convinced that they are doing well
operationally - the high bromide prices bailed them out last quarter but
production seemed rather anemic (although that seemed weather related). I am
suspicious of Chinese market overall, as I think there is a substantial risk of
a RE crash there.

My strategy has been to upgrade the quality of my portfolio with stalwarts
mostly with good dividend yields. I also own a bunch of small bank stocks as
well as insurers. I think all those groups will do well even in a slow economy.
I also think that those groups are cheap. I always keep at least 10% of my
portfolios in cash to snap up bargains.

GS is absurdly cheap only in the current framework. Teh current framework is
that they can borrow for almost nothing - their balance sheet is 880B -72B$ in
equity that is roughly 802B$ in liabilities. Even if you consider that 200B$ is
probably pass through they are currently able to borrow roughly 600B$ and paid
only 1.5B$ in interest.

This money is not coming from depositors, it's coming from FED's quasi
guaranteed interbank lending at libor for 0.6% interest rate currently. Would
you lend money to GS for 0.6% annually?

80% of GS revenues are coming from trading business (their own internal
proprietary trading and acting as a market maker for all sorts of things) and
the remaining 20% from asset management and investment banking.

Those trading business are profitable only when they are financed cheaply. For
example look at SRE energy and metal trading business they were making 20% on
equity but only when backing from RBS was available for the huge sums. Once RBS
bailed out, those very profitable business were sold (to another bank - JPM) at
book value and the rest is barely braking even. SRE is no lightweight
financially but they are BBB+ rated and would have to borrow LT money at 6%
probably. that would probably eat away most of the profit.

Anyways to get back to GS -their trading business has several hundred B$
financed with debt at 0.6% rates - what were GS profits, if the interest rate
were a more normal 5% (reasonable for an A-rated company). I am sure you can do
the math?

Will that happen? I don't know but the financial legislation will make it more
likely. but here is the other angle of that equation - all this financing at
Libor is short term and need to be rolled over daily or monthly. Now when
indeed criminal charges are pressed how many institutions will want to lent
them money for a measly 0.6%. many will not be allowed to do interbank lending
or other business because of their bylaws, others will decide that it's not
worth it. Without access to that cash, GS will be on life support within 2
weeks, I'd venture to guess. Then the FED will come in and do an AIG with them.
Could this happen? I think so. Is it likely? I think not - maybe a 10-20%
chance. i think a settlement is more likely but somehow In believe that GS will
not be left off the hook that easily (same may apply to MS).

Just something to think about over the weekend. Well I leave my GTC order open
for GS @125$ but I am aware of the risks.

GS: "GS is absurdly cheap when you consider that they have billions under
management..." I'm seeing $840B for assets under management (last q report),
and a GS market cap of $72B. Can't determine enterprise value from Yahoo's
numbers -- there's so much cash (pass-through stuff?) on the balance sheet
apparently. Anyway, aum/mkt cap = .086 = 8.6%, which to me seems high, although
perhaps not out of line for these financial conglomerates (vs. pure asset
managers).

I like GS for its brain power, its m&a strength, and its seeming to be a "go
to" company when large businesses want or need to do deals, restructurings,
etc. I also like its growth as measured by growth in stated bv. Negatives are
the complexity of the businesses and GS's bruised (or worse) reputation.
Further, the difficulty in assessing what affect the government regs will have
on GS. Plus perhaps also should be considered Spekulatius's point--assessing
how or if GS will sustain profits when interest rates increase on GS's borrowed
monies.

I dont look at that way at all paul. what i do is value those assets under
management at 2% giving it a value of $16 or so and then i added that to the
state book value of the the company which is a bit over $122 i think. By
comparison LM has enterprise value of $5bilion but negative tangible equity of
- $600 million. Im projecting that they will earn $5 for the next quarter and i
come up with my adjusted bv of $143. Despite all the current warts on GS this
is far and away the best company in its field, and buying it at book for is
like turning some of my money over to one of the best money managers to take
care of, thinking that its very likely they will continue to make 14-16% on
this money over time.

Now someone I know who is very smart just doesnt believe the book value that is
on GS's financial statement but he cant substantiate it. He just believe's that
its in GS's employees best interest to overstate book so that they can pull as
much employment compensation out of it.

P/e can be confusing unless the poster defines which p/e he is using, trailing,
current or forward:

he P/E ratio is equal to a stock's market capitalization divided by its
after-tax earnings over a 12-month period, usually the trailing period but
occasionally the current or forward period. The value is the same whether the
calculation is done for the whole company or on a per-share basis. The higher
the P/E ratio, the more the market is willing to pay for each dollar of annual
earnings. The last year's price/earnings ratio (P/E ratio) would be actual,
while current year and forward year price/earnings ratio (P/E ratio) would be
estimates, but in each case, the "P" in the equation is the current price.
Companies that are not currently profitable (that is, ones which have negative
earnings) don't have a P/E ratio at all. also called earnings multiple or
price/earnings ratio (P/E ratio).

re GS - Madharry, GS is not borrowing their short term funding from the FED, I
never said it that way. They are borrowing it via interbank lending from other
too big to fail institutions - I called it quasi guaranteed. This is made
easier because they are a bank holding now.

FWIW, the FDIC guaranteed LT debt was a great bargain for GS - they took it on
in the worst of the crisis - due to the FDIC guarantee they paid close to the
going rate for treasuries - a 1B$ gift annually.

Clarification -the 1.5B$ in interest for GS was quarterly, which makes it ~6B$
annually - not a bad rate to float ~600B$ in liabilities.

Just imagine for a while, GS had to pay 5% interest rates , that would make
30B$ /year! Their entire profit would be gone. That is probably not reasonable
since they have other low cost funding sources - the discount window (also run
by the Fed) etc. But still, without cheap money, they would have to liquidate a
huge amount of their trading operation and their profit would fall. They
probably would end up being 1/2 the size and half the profits and could return
some excessive funds to shareholders. We would end up with an investment bank
and asset managemer with a little gambling on the side. Now it's 80% gambling
and 2% other business, all financed by cheap taxpayer guarantees. Maybe they
can convert their gambling operation into a hedge fund in this case.

I'd guess if you buy for tangible book, you would be OK even in that latter
scenario.

Madharry - i knew that the interactive brokers margin rate would come up. the
problem with margin loans of course is that only liquid assets can be used and
you need to have a lot of equity 30% and that can be changed on a whimp).
Clearly GS could not finance itself through margin loans alone. Even the
discount window which is open to many institutions can only be used with very
high graded bonds (AA or better) as collateral, certainly derivatives priveat
equity holdings and other stuff would not apply.

I agree that the 5% number is high but not unreasonable so if non-liquid assets
needs to be financed with a 10:1 leverage long term.

Even a community bank cannot borrow at 1%, right now they pay more like 1.5%-2%
to their customers blended and they need to run branches, provide checking
services etc to their customers to get their deposits, while GS can borrow
apparently hundred of billions for 1% blended.

Anyways, I am not trying to be moralist here or bashing GS. I think the value
thesis is correct if things stay like they are, but I do not think that this is
a sure thing and neither is GS stock at this level.
