Paul, the way I valued HPQ a year ago was to look at Walter Hewlett's valuation
and divide by the combined share number. After the merger, HPQ price went below
my value for the printer division alone. Since then, cost-cutting at the
business has tracked pretty much as outlined by the pro-merger folks. I look at
the PC business as being a low-margin, or even profitless, operation that you
need to own to play the game. Right now a big issue seems to be the impact of
Dell's entering the printer market. While PC's are commodity products from
screwdriver shops, printers are not. HP's printers continue to produce a better
product. (Note, the ASIC's for HP come from Agilent.)

Having said all that, I'm no fan of Carley. I voted against her and most of the
directors recently. I voted for many of the proposals opposed by the BOD. I
threw in a vote against the auditors to send a message.

I sold some stock this year in the 20's. I hold a bunch more. (Some of which I
received from the MA of Indigo. IMHO, Indigo is a category killer. I hope HP
will achieve earnout from it.)

Wiesia, re margin on options. Since this is value thread I will be brief.
Margin at Brown is 10% of stock price(for stocks more than 10% out of the
money,otherwise 20%) plus proceeds of sale. A 4 dollar stock is 40 cents plus
proceeds which are already in your account.
In context of value investment I doubled down on dal Jan05/35 calls at .80.
From value perspective look at dal 10k,results of recent earnings report and
WSJ article which shows dal as highest salaries for attendants and pilots of
five major airlines. Sprinkle into this cocktail common sense about dal
competition which includes 2 major competitors relieved of debt thru
bankruptcy. My assessment is that dal will not triple in price in 21 months. If
I am correct I will earn 80 dollars on 115 dollars of margin. This to me is an
excellent value prospect.

wieslawa, I also have Ameritrade, and I also sell naked puts. For me, the key
on selling puts is to have enough general equity in stocks so margin is not an
issue. Then you can even take out the premium you receive - although you would
have to send it back plus more if the stock is put to you.

I took a look at RSLN and think I'll pass up because of the risk profile. RSLN
has a very good efficiency ratio but a low interest spread because it's into
commercial real estate and developers lending. Those business are high volume

Hi all,

I sold ANF today on the executive compensation announcement to Mr. Jeffries. I
find it excessive.

CX - did everyone see its Market Cap jump on Yahoo from $5B to $20B? Missed it?
Me too. :-)))) The market cap calculations for this baby are tough. If I
understand correctly, 3 CX shares compose one CPO. 5 CPOs compose 1 ADS. So the
market cap is 4.56B shares / 3 / 5 * dollar price per ADS. Which is ~$6B. Yahoo
lists 20B market cap, my broker had 90B market cap. Talk about good data on
foreign stocks. :-)

I read CX annual and it's as understandable as the paragraph I wrote above.
Which means that I don't understand it. I will hold it but not buy more.

Hi Paul,

I've been away for a month. In Italy and France. Oh, I love the french wine!
And I like their political stand on the war. And I walked in a peace rally in
Florence. And Italian wine is very good too. :o)

Anyway, to a less controversial subject. You asked of TJX. I own a small
amount, and am happy to hold it. Others in the sector - I bought more ROST
today. I own TGT. It's overprices compared to other fine deals, but it has
quality. I remember in the old days when everything was overvalued, we had to
fish among the real lesser known stocks. I longed for the day I could afford
quality name-brand companies.

I hold ANF, J Clarke's favorite of late. I hold S, sorry to say. I think it's a
good deal, but hope it's not a KMart in the making.

On POS -- I saw some postings. I followed this one for a long time and owned it
in the past. I like it, but not at this price. I agree Paul. There's other fish
in the sea.

One old favorite I looked at and and will buy tomorrow - HUG.

I noticed our CMH, which was a stock much spoken of here, has been acquired by
warren. I have a few shares which I bought half a year ago. Does anyone see a
replacement for those shares. I looked at CPJ, as a REIT, but did not like it.

Okay, my favorite. "Favorite" in the sense of I'm liking its potential most
given its current price. Not "favorite" in the sense of it's been a big winner
for me, and so I'm holding it and loving its price movement and its up chart.

First some disclaimers:

The way my mental makeup seems to be usually causes me to favor (i.e my
favorite stock) the last new stock I bought. I've looked at it, it's fresh in
my mind, I'm enthused or comfortable, I'm positive about the decision (haven't
got beat up in the stock yet), etc.

Secondly, my favorites when I try to identify such a priori (before anything
happens) don't seem to be the big winners for me. It's my impression that the
big winners when (if) they come, arrive as a surprise to me. Whether it's a
cigar-butt, a GARRP stock, a Buffett type, the stocks I like the most (my
favorites), seem to be eclipsed in performance by something else deep in the
bowels of my portfolio.

That all said, my favorite stock that imo is still in a buy range is NTZ.

NTZ: Earnings have fluctuated over past years. Company though has generally had
decent or good ROE on a growing book value.
Margins are being compressed now due to various factors (economy, Chinese
imports). I'm guessing earnings for '03 will be around $1.35 which would show a
higher p/e of about $8.78/$1.35 = 6.5

Yahoo currently shows '02 earnings of $1.84. I don't know where Yahoo is
getting this figure.
NTZ reported (3/24/03) '02 earnings of $1.58, or $1.53 excluding some
adjustments.

Thanks Paul. I got in this morning. I just could not resist. The furniture
business has been too good for me, as an investor, in the past. I made quite a
return on GBT.a (TSE) and learned by being a shareholder that there was a lot
of money to make in what looks like a boring industry.

As a retailer, GBT.a does not live on high margin returns, but management has
shown its superiority as an operator. What's amazing is that the business is
able to generate strong cash flow in good and bad economic climates.

I believe that Natuzzi is in the same league, in the manufacturing sector
however. Judging by what I have read so far, management is conservative, savvy
and very discipline. No matter the competition, it has built a strong brand and
should grow shareholder value in the future.

Of course, as usual, anything can happen, but at the current price I would say
that the risk is as low as it can get.

Thanks again for the tip.

Jurgis Bekepuris. Try the recliner! I tried one of these NTZ chairs at my

NTZ stock has a lot to recommend itself to value investors. In addition to good
current and historical numbers, you probably saw that several pro's have
positions in the stock - Tweedy Browne, Baron Asset, Baron Growth, Oakmark
International, Ruane Cunniff. (all per Yahoo). Likely you purchased your shares
at or below prices they paid. (Assuming they haven't strongly averaged down
recently, and assuming Yahoo data is current (ha!), and assuming these funds
are still NTZ holders- which they should be imo if they are value investors. )

Yahoo msg. board seems to have some sharp value investors who own NTZ and who
possess a strong analytical bent and are close followers of NTZ. I consider
that a positive, although of course, it doesn't mean that I or they or the
funds or anybody else will necessarily see profits from owning NTZ over a value
investor's time frame.

No matter how good things look there is that fickle finger of fate. So even
though NTZ is my favorite stock as of today, like you, it's "a very small
position" in a diversified portfolio.

I am seeing a revaluation upwards of meritorious small cap stocks. I think
there are three main reasons for this. All such stocks got indiscriminately
slaughtered in the bear market selloff - but not all such companies
fundamentals got killed. Second, very few small companies have defined benefit
pension plans, increased contributions to which will be hurting many big
companies' results for years to come. Last, a big company has a tough time
doing materially better than the industry in which it operates, because of its
size; small companies can operate in a niche that performs much differently

Most of my portfolio is based on that "phenomenon". Regardless where "the

Apart from a few genius managers, the only way to beat the indexes is not to

Non sequitur. :-) For me there is a HUGE "hold" zone between buys and sells.
I.e. where stocks offer <15%, but greater than 5-7% projected annual return.
They are not overpriced there, but they are not buys either. When they are all

Jeffbash, I noticed the same "small value stocks rally" phenomenon lately. It
usually indicate the end of stock market rally. Big stocks move up first, then
small ones. When the rising tide lifted all boats, next move is down. We could
still enjoy some more small stock jumps in the next couple weeks. This time
could be different - 3 years bear market is pretty significant, maybe this is
the big reversal, smart money lead the shifting from bonds to stocks.

Steve, I think you have to look at stock pricing in context. In my opinion,
just as in Spring 2000 a stock selling at half its high after the first selloff
was still far from cheap (but temporarily low enough to allow for a significant
rally for a time), a stock now selling for 2 to 3 times its low could still be
far from expensive (but temporarily high enough to allow for a significant
profittaking move at any time). The extreme bull/bear market highs/lows have
little bearing on the true value of most companies.

One non-value stock example is XICO, which I know exceptionally well. It should
never have gotten down to $2, as subsequent insider buying at $3 and $4 showed
insiders believed. The company has done exactly what they said they would do,
or better, fundamentals-wise for many quarters. Yet here the stock is at $6 and
the short position is the same as when it was $2. It is fairly valued now, but
would have to get to double digits to be overpriced - which puts it in a large
"hold" zone that Jurgis recently talked about.

You are welcome. I followed that board closely several years ago, and will even
take some credit for bringing it back to life after several months with no
posts. Then a few (maybe it was only one) obnoxious posters started posting
with statements that he NEVER had a losing trade, had a GUARANTEED system,
etc., etc., and I stopped following it.

If you do your own DD and can get past the obnoxiousness, then the board has
some good ideas. Seems like it is mostly penny stocks recently though.

---------------------------

I don't mind holding "dead money" stocks with their potential intact if the
alternative is having losing stocks on which one gives up hope of recovery. A
"no-gain" is better than "a loss".

In looking at the "opportunity cost" one endures by hanging on to a stock that
goes nowhere, sometimes one forgets that yes, the money could possibly be
employed better or for faster results elsewhere, but sometimes too, that
"elsewhere" opportunity turns into a loss. And in the past couple of years
there have been so many losing-stock opportunities.

Stock is in the housing sector. (Which has not been a popular investing arena

Seems reasonable to me that the stock might continue to trade within a 9-to-18

I do think OSTK is a value in the $7-8 region. The company has around $2 of
excess current assets sitting on its balance sheets (I'm using round numbers
here). Assuming conservative assumptions on revenue, you're buying at
significantly under a 1x P/S ratio. Given management's guidance on gross
margins, I think the stock is fairly valued, on the numbers, at that P/S ratio.

Revenues have been growing. I believe this is because OSTK has a compelling
Internet business model (one of the few). The Internet is a great place to sell
off overstocked items. OSTK reaps the benefits as other Internet retailers go
out of business.

Finally, take a look at management. This is probably one of those rare
companies where you can take what they say at face value. So, I don't expect
you'll find skeletons in the closet. I believe management when they say the
problems of Q1 are nonrecurring, and I appreciate the candor on why their
marketing program hit a speedbump.

Speaking of management candor, did anyone listen to the Steinway (LVB)

From:mikeslemmer
A few months ago I suggested people take a look at VCLK. This is a message to
let you folks know that I sold out my position, and to outline my reasons for
doing so:

1. The company is worth its cash of $2.90 per diluted share plus the value of
the underlying business. With revenues of approx. $1 per diluted share, an
estimated net profit margin (earning power) of 10% and a P/E of 15 on that
profit, you're left with $4.40 per share of value. Today the stock exceeded
that value.

2. As stated previously I am unhappy with management's recent decision to issue
itself large numbers of options at below-book-value prices. This anti-investor
decision leads me to question whether management is working for me or for
itself.

3. The company's revenues are growing slowly, and I doubt the pace will
accelerate. This is why I chose a P/E of 15 above. Should interest rates rise,
a P/E of 10 might be more justified, bringing the value down to $3.90. (P/E of
15 is a return of 6.66%. P/E of 10 is a return of 10%. As interest rates rise,
P/Es decline because investors would rather buy a treasury yielding 6% than a
stock with a 15 P/E)

4. The Internet advertising sector is "hot" with investors. Keep in mind that
investors held VCLK's stock price below cash for over 2 years, ending about
March 1. I find it likely that, once this sector rotates out of favor again,
I'll have an opportunity to buy back my shares in the $2.50-3.00 range.

5. The economy is not improving. Unemployment remains at 6%, the real estate
market is beginning to falter, the dollar is weak, and interest rates can't be
cut any more. It would take very little to make this summer a rerun of last
summer.

If anyone has any thoughts on my decision on VCLK I'd love to hear them.

mikeslemmer: Thanks for mentioning VCLK to the thread. It's turned out to be a
winner for those who bought and held.

We don't usually get infrequent posters coming back to detail their selling
decision, so that is much appreciated. Especially with VCLK, where I believe
several on the thread were buyers.

I've been been reducing my small VCLK position at prices of $3.73 and $3.95.

There's been a decent (imo) write-up which you've likely seen too of a Motley
Fool's decision to sell his VCLK shares.
Essentially, the man bought VCLK as a value stock (selling below cash), and
now, as the stock price has increased to and beyond cash value, the stock is
more a growth story. Which is a different and more dicey proposition.

And that's how I see it too. Your analysis provides the analytical support. I
might argue about the appropriate p/e for a company that could deliver
consistent 10% profit margins. (I could see a p/e higher than 15.) OTOH, I
don't know that VCLK can deliver as much as 10%. (Maybe it could, but I've no
facts in front of me.) No matter how I rearrange the numbers though, it's
easier for me to see the stock cycling down again rather that moving to even
higher levels from its current high. To me, the risk/reward favors selling.
That I will likely soon do with the remainder of my VCLK position.

Again, I appreciate your entry and exit VCLK posts,and congrats on a nice call
and having the patience to wait for those gains. Don't forget to post here with
your next stock idea!

out to be a heck of a bonanza. In the meantime the company is not far from
selling for cash so suddenly Apple becomes a value stock with a kicker.

Re: VCLK's net profitability...

I'm using a 10% estimate of post-tax conversion of revenues to profits for
VCLK. This is based on management's stated goal of 20% pre-tax profit margin,
minus taxes, minus a fudge factor.

Admittedly, this is a pretty decent profit margin and could argue for a higher
P/E ratio. But the key to producing that ratio is top-line growth, without
which you're left with around $0.10 per year of economic profits (assuming
management hits its target).

From listening to conference calls and conversations with management and other
employees over 2 years I've concluded that VCLK has a great commitment to
cost-cutting and creating profitability, but has less ability to increase its
revenue. While online advertising is growing as a sector, most of that growth
is in two areas in which VCLK doesn't participate: paid-search listings (a la
google) and name-brand portals/news sites (yahoo, cnn, etc.)

With its recent acquisitions of MPLX and BFRE, VCLK has also entered additional
markets which traditionally have lower margins -- ad serving is an example of
such a market. Ad serving has significant capital costs (and therefore
depreciation) associated with the server equipment required to actually serve
ads. This is DCLK's main business now, and management there is expecting
pre-tax margins significantly under VCLK's aim of 20%.

All of this leads me to believe that growth will be relatively slow and VCLK's
core business is best seen as an annuity. That's why I selected the 15 P/E
(with 10 being more rational should interest rates rise).

"Classic" Graham value plays require that the company not be persistently
losing money. I haven't looked at ALVR beyond seeing that it's in Israel -- too
much geopolitical risk there for my blood -- but if the company hasn't yet (i)
demonstrated its ability to turn a profit and (ii) demonstrated that its
current unprofitability is due to circumstances that will end relatively soon,
it's not a classic Graham 2/3 net-net.

I'll start small positions in a couple of stocks that still look attractive to
me, even though they've been moving up. FDP and FBR.

I feel like I'm chasing, but the stocks do seem to have some fundamental appeal
still (to me anyway). I suspect if there's a market stall, FDP and FBR might
drop, so I'll take small positions now and see what happens.

FDP. I'll buy on expectation that consensus earnings estimates are somewhere
near what will actually occur. That would give a very low p/e to the stock. I
would like to believe that people will continue to eat fruits/vegetables and
that Fresh Del Monte can and will be an ongoing profitable business. I don't
like the lawsuits or news reports of shady, sleazy dealings between the company
and large stockholders/founders who apparently own as much as 50% of the
company. I'm also suspicious of any company (FDP)that would be headquartered in
Coral Gables, Florida.

Also stepping up today for FBR, a Dale Baker pick. Company seems to have had
some good earning years with high ROE. I am attracted to the dividend (the
company turned itself into a REIT), and what seems to me to be the scrappy,
aggressiveness of the company. They operate in six industry (financial)
segments, and I like this diversification. Especially as some areas (e.g.
investment banking) have their cycle of good and bad years. I wouldn't like to
see FBR earnings fall much, because the div. gets axed (being a REIT), and the
stock will pay the price.

I recently began a position in GEG. The stock is cheap and they're in a sector
that stands to benefit directly from any recovery in our economy if one is in
the making. The stock has been moving up perhaps due to the huge short position
that seems to be in the process of covering.

low stock price a bargain now for patient investors.

I recall that I didn't like GEG's short public history (only two years), and
insider selling. I see that the insider selling is continuing. Strongly so, it
appears to me.

I'll pass on GEG. (Jmo here, and I've been wrong many, many times.)
The stock doesn't attract me on a fundamental basis (p/bk, p/e), I don't know

15 stocks you can buy for 'free'
Some companies have cash on hand that outweighs their market capitalization,
but even then, they're not always a good deal. Here's how to find the ones that
are.
By Michael Brush

If the market’s talking heads have your head spinning with their endless debate
about whether stocks are overvalued on false dreams of recovery, here's a
simple solution.

Try to put your money in businesses at the best possible valuation of all: for
free.

This is easier than you might think. Many companies are sitting on loads of
cash, in per-share amounts greater than what you might pay for their stocks,
for two simple reasons:

They raised a ton of money during the 1990s stock market bubble.

The companies are in now much-hated sectors like e-business,
business-to-consumer software or photonics -- remember those? These groups are
so despised that the market has pummeled their stocks down to a hat size or
less. And, more importantly, they’re trading at or below cash levels.

Consider Selectica (SLTC, news, msgs), a San Jose, Calif., company. Selectica
provides software that helps companies sell goods on the Internet or through
intranets, which are private networks connecting businesses. Its stock trades
for below $2.70. The company has $2.90 per share in cash. So, buying stock in
Selectica basically means you’re getting the business itself for free.Check out
your options.
Record low rates
could save you a bundle.

That’s not a bad deal, if you believe that sooner or later the economy will
pick up and demand is likely to return for this company, whose software is good
enough for blue-chip customers such as General Electric (GE, news, msgs), Dell
Computer (DELL, news, msgs), Cisco Systems (CSCO, news, msgs) and Aetna (AET,
news, msgs).

Digging up the picks
One of the trickiest things about investing in these kinds of companies is
actually finding them. Most are so small, they have no analyst coverage.

For help with the research, we turned to an old pro at the game: deep value
investor John Buckingham, who always has a portion of his portfolio at the Al
Frank Fund (VALUX) dedicated to what he likes to call “cash is king” stocks.
Buckingham also edits an investment newsletter called the Prudent Speculator,
ranked No. 1 by Hulbert Financial Digest.

Before we get to Buckingham’s short list of businesses selling on the cheap (if
not for free), here are two pointers he offers about investing in stocks like
these.

You have to buy many of them. At least seven will do, but 10 or more is even
better. The reason: A few will disappear, but others will go up enough to make
it all pay off. “Throw ‘em in your individual retirement account. Come back in
couple years, and one of them is going to be up 1,000%,” says Buckingham. “That
is all you need, if nine go to zero, to break even.” But with so much cash on
the balance sheet at these companies, seeing that many go to zero is unlikely.

Be patient. Be very patient. Expect to hold these stocks for the long term. But
if one happens to go up tenfold in 12 months, which can happen, be smart and
take some profits.
There are essentially three ways you will hit pay dirt with these stocks.
The hard way is to simply slog it out for the two or three years it takes for
business to improve.

If you’re a little luckier, a company’s industry sector will suddenly come into
style, giving your stock a jolt. Several months ago, for example, Buckingham
bought shares of SINA Corp. (SINA, news, msgs), a Chinese Internet stock, at
around $1.50 as part of his cash-is-king play. Then, a mini-mania for Chinese
portal stocks set in, SINA advanced more than sixfold, and Buckingham took some
profits at around $9. The stock was at $10.31 on Friday.

Management or some one else will see the value of shares trading under cash
value, and liquidate the company or make an offer.
With that in mind, here’s a short list of stocks trading at or near cash
levels.

Apple Computer
Before we get to the tiny cash-is-king plays, let’s start with one everyone
knows: Apple Computer (AAPL, news, msgs). This computer maker’s overhead is so
low, it’s built up a cash hoard (cash and short-term investments) of $4.53
billion. That’s worth $12.38 a share. So if you buy the stock at the recent
price of $13.40, you’re getting the computer business for just $1 per share.

But doesn’t it make sense that Apple’s business goes cheap? After all, demand
is sluggish in the education and the creative fields where Apple is popular,
and Apple’s been threatening to move into the risky entertainment business. “I
think Apple is an innovative company, and the sector will turn,” responds
Buckingham. “And I am in it for the long run.” But it's among the smaller,
lesser-known companies that you’ll get more bang for your buck, admits
Buckingham. Here’s a look at those plays.

Customer relations software
Net Perceptions (NETP, news, msgs). This tiny Minneapolis company jumped to
$1.50 per share from $1.30 in early February on news it had hired U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray to help it find a potential buyer or partner. Now at $1.45, its
shares still trade for far less than what might be a good starting point for a
buyout price, or $2.30 per share -- the amount of cash per share at the
company. Net Perceptions’ software is used to mine corporate databases to
improve marketing at companies including 3M (MMM, news, msgs) and J.C. Penney
(JCP, news, msgs).

Apropos Technology (APRS, news, msgs). At around $2 per share, the Oakbrook
Terrace, Ill., company trades 17% below its cash per share level of $2.41. So
if you buy Apropos stock, you’re getting its customer interaction management
software business plus 41 cents for free. Yes, that business is losing money.
But cost-cutting has reduced the cash burn rate to around $1.6 million per
quarter, leaving room for a turnaround -- or buyout -- before the money runs
out. Apropos software is used at Nokia (NOK, news, msgs), Kraft Foods (KFT,
news, msgs) and GE Capital, the finance division of General Electric (GE, news,
msgs).

Ascential Software (ASCL, news, msgs). This database management company trades
above cash levels of $2.65 per share. Its stock recently changed hands for
$3.80. But Buckingham still figures the Westborough, Mass. company’s a good buy
because the company should turn profitable by conservative accounting measures
later this year, and it has positive cash flow. The company’s database mining
software is used by JP Morgan Chase (JPM, news, msgs) and Scotts (SMG, news,
msgs), among others. The company expects at least 20% revenue growth this year.

A few dot-com survivors
Remember Boo.com and all the other high profile Internet business flameouts?
They’re long gone. But Buckingham reckons he’s found a handful of promising
businesses that ply their trade on the Internet and have enough cash to stick
around until times get better.

Keynote Systems (KEYN, news, msgs). This company, based in San Mateo, Calif.,
has a cash hoard of $8.80 per share if you take out lease obligations. And it
recently traded for around $9.50. So for 70 cents a share, you’re getting a
business that has positive operating cash flow and should be profitable by a
conservative accounting measure later this year. Keynote has a network of
computers around the world that constantly test the performance of commercial
Web sites.

Via Net.works (VNWI, news, msgs). At 75 cents a share, the company trades for
less than half its $1.62 in cash per share. The Reston, Va., provider of
Internet service to small businesses in Europe and the United States is burning
through $8 million per quarter. But it has around $96 million in cash, so it
should be able to last until the economy picks up.

Quotesmith.com (QUOT, news, msgs). The Darien, Ill., company, which offers
insurance quotes online and owns the Insure.com news site, recently traded for
$4, or well above cash levels of $3.32 per share. “But business prospects are
more promising, and it will be profitable in the not-to-distant future,” says
Buckingham.

FairMarket (FAIM, news, msgs). This Woburn, Mass., company has $2.08 per share
in cash but it recently traded for $1.60. It helps companies sell excess
inventory online, including through a partnership with eBay (EBAY, news, msgs).

Telecom and networking equipment
There’s little evidence capital spending at phone companies will pick up this
year. But sooner or later it will, and the following equipment suppliers have
enough cash -- and good enough technology -- to be around to benefit when that
happens, speculates Buckingham.

Avici Systems (AVCI, news, msgs). The manufacturer of routers has anywhere from
$6 to $10 per share in cash, depending on how you count some of its
investments. Yet the onetime telecom equipment high flier recently traded for
just $4. The North Billerica, Mass., company is burning through about $12
million per quarter but it has around $113 million in cash. Avici’s routers are
used in a form of broadband transmission known as Internet protocol (IP), which
is growing faster than other formats like frame relay or asynchronous transfer
mode, in part because IP is cheaper to manage.

“The bottom line is the Internet is still growing at a very significant rate,”
says Avici chief executive Steven Kaufman. “Carriers are looking to save money,
and best way is to consolidate around IP equipment.” He expects 10% revenue
growth next quarter, but won’t offer guidance beyond that because of
uncertainty about capital spending at the phone companies.

CoSine Communications (COSN, news, msgs). Trading at $5 a share, this company
looks like a bargain because it has about $8.25 in cash per share. The Redwood
City, Calif., company develops switches and software used in IP networks. It
burned through $11.2 million in the last quarter, but it has $102 million on
hand. CoSine popped to $6 from $4 on takeover rumors last December, offering a
taste of the potential profit in cash-is-king stocks if a buyout comes through.

New Focus (NUFO, news, msgs). The San Jose, Calif. company makes lasers used in
broadband transmission and research. It has about $4 in cash per share but
trades much lower at $3.15 per share. The company is burning about $5 million
per quarter and has a cash hoard of $258 million.

3Com (COMS, news, msgs). The network equipment maker, headquartered in Santa
Clara, Calif., holds around $4 in cash. It recently traded above $5. Up there,
it’s already closing in on Wall Street's 12-month price targets of around
$5.25. Plus, there has been lots of insider selling in the $4.80 to $5.10
range. So it might be better to wait for a pullback in this one.

Wireless equipment and services
Endwave (ENWV, news, msgs). This tiny company designs chips used to help
transmit cell phone conversations the long distances between wireless base
stations. It trades at just $1. But the Sunnyvale, Calif., company has an
impressive cash hoard of $3.30 per share. The good news for Endwave, says Chief
Executive Edward Keible, is that wireless equipment spending will pick up once
cell phone companies merge so that infrastructure costs can be spread out among
more customers. The bad news is that Wall Street doesn’t think that will play
out for two or three years.

“So we are going out and doing other things,” says Keible. That includes
designing chips used in satellite communications and defense electronics, like
the weapons firing systems on Apache helicopters. Keible thinks these efforts,
which now account for about 8% of revenue, will help his company produce
positive cash flow by the end of this year.

Aether Systems (AETH, news, msgs). The company markets software that can put
desktop applications onto wireless devices. It trades at just $3.50, even
though it has about $4 per share in cash. Its software is used in law
enforcement for writing reports, and at private sector firms like trucking
companies and office supplies stores to track shipping. The cash burn rate was
around $10 million last quarter, and the company, based in Owings Mills, Md.,
has around $169 million in cash.

Vyyo (VYYO, news, msgs). Tiny it is, with just 53 employees. Vyyo, makes
equipment used to deliver high-speed data via wireless connections to
businesses and homes, sells for just $2.50. But the Cupertino, Calif., company
has $5.79 in cash per share. Chairman and Chief Executive Davidi Gilo owns 43%
of the company.

Risky business
Even though all the cash at these companies seems to offer good protection,
remember that nothing can protect you from managers who decide to do dumb
things with the money.

Some may just use it all up before the company turns profitable. Another
classic mistake: Making stupid acquisitions. Apple and 3Com, for example, are
rumored to be on the prowl for acquisition targets, which elevates the risk of
owning shares in those companies.

“The downside risk is that the money can be spent,” says Buckingham. “It is not
really yours. But if you buy enough of these you are going to be very well
rewarded.”

For an added twist to the recent (recurring) discussion, we have on the meaning
one should derive from short selling of stocks:
http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=18901791

To summarize, the short selling may not be a red flag but management's reaction
may be. Specifically, if management reacts by 'attacking' the shorts (which
shareholders always seem to want) instead of just running the business, that
could be a bad sign. I don't know the original source of the study but it makes
sense to me.

For gamblers and other fearless people, I offer TCHC.

Perhaps though the appropriate word for buyers might be foolish.

Company again exceeds its earnings estimates and is selling at a low multiple
of forward earnings. (p/e about 7) It's their fifth consecutive record quarter.

We have here a small Florida insurance company (Being in Florida raises my
suspicions immediately.) controlled by one family. The company is apparently in
several ancillary businesses (e.g. tax preparation software) and seems to me to
be doing strange things as regards franchising some of their insurance sellers.
The stock's already had a good move. (a new high today at 14, up from lows this
year at 4.25)

I mention the stock here on the off chance this is a real company and real
business - hard to believe though they could be pricing their insurance right
and still be doing 33% ROE ($2 est. on $6 book value). But IF the performance
is real and somewhat sustainable - then the stock might be undervalued.

I have a very small position now which I intend to watch closely hoping I will
escape before any bad news spills out. (Although my record of stepping aside
other disasters is very poor)

Madharry: I don't think consideration of long-term resilience is at all idiotic
for a value investor. My short-term trade only came about because I got a big
pop real quick...the original rationale was that the problems were temporary
and the biz DID have longer term viability...I was prepared to be
patient...just didn't have to wait.
After I sold news came out that ACDO is suing E&Y for bad recievables
advice...This could produce countercharges and mudslinging that brings negative
scrutiny from shorts, journalists, analysts & regulators. Recent guidance
volatility adds to concerns...those who sold on the negative guidance got
screwed. So despite the view that this niche acute care model has legs, I'm
staying on the sidelines till the dust clears.

Started WEBX today @10.45. I like the video conferencing biz despite recent
disappointments. PEG is .66 if the growth projections [notoriously unreliable]
play out. NYT article today 'VIRTUAL TRAVEL GIVES THE AIRLINES REAL HEARTBURN'
highlights how many are turning to video conferencing in general and WEBX in
particular to avoid travel to SARS areas. This catalyst could change behavior
and hasten transition to more productive VC use going forward. WEBX is the
leader in Web conferencing...a more quick and dirty approach that the VC rooms
and equipment intensive approach that PLCM takes. A big negative is MSFT's
entry via purchase of Placeware. Another is high short position which may be
signaling issues I'm missing [I lean towards the camp that fundamental shorts
are real good at digging dirt on companies and their presence signals
underlying problems]. OTOH, with 50% of float short, they could fuel an advance
if wrong. Other negatives: Recent stalling in growth after the post-911
bubble/bounce [SARS induced demand hasn't hit results yet] and heavy option
compensation that turns recent earnings negative if factored in. This is a
small, highly speculative position more based on my enthusiasm [possibly
misplaced] in VC and interest in having a position in the web conferencing
leader than in this being a really cheap stock.

reduce travel, or conference calls eliminate SARS concerns for transnational

CVS - I've owned CVS before and bought back a few shares today, maybe yours.
I'm not hopping up and down over it, but I think the trend show promise of more
favorable announcements. And it's not exactly at the high price for the year.

I bought some OSIS. Without a lot of research, I think there possibilities here
and would like other opinions.

I have been checking in on OSIS - it certainly seems to be in a promising

the conference call or is the flat q to q revenue the main concern? There also
seems to be a huge short position (according to yahoo posters) which is also
somewhat of a concern - at least i would like to know the rationale of the

Even as 'Wallace and Grommit' were making opposite moves in CVS, I was selling
AAPL today while MadHarry was buying. I just think the spike is too much too
quick due in part to relief at no huge acquisition (yet?) but in part
over-reaction to modest initial success of music sales. One million songs at
about $ 0.34 each to AAPL isn't much revenue (I think royalties are 65 cents).
Granted in the long run, it could grow quite a bit but, in the short term, it's
a drop in the bucket. Like Wallace, I feel the market's moving too fast. I'll
watch for a pullback.

Yours sounds like a reasonable strategy.

I was just holding on to an old position that I've decided to get out of. I
didn't think the recent down spike would last and was holding on for a recovery
back to the mid-14 level when it just kept going.

I've been so busy with personal stuff and business that I haven't had time to
re-assess.

Glad to see the move (at long last) but, like you, I'm skeptical about its
endurance. For now, though, I'll ride along and see what happens.

Paul, Regarding redeploying...I don't really think of it that way. If the sold
positions come back in or look attractive, I might buy em back. Otherwise, when
I sniff out a bargain I go for it. I'm not uncomfortable holding cash, cause it
beats money down a rathole everyday.
I'm not finding a lot of easy money buys...on the contrary, most of what looks
cheap at first glance turns out to be cheap for good reason.
I view PLCM as cheaper than it looks because of the $5 a share in cash and what
I view as a temporary depression in earnings due to the shift in their business
model away from stocking distributors to direct physical distribution and
subsequent channel inventory liquidation...a process that's pretty much done,
combined with constrained capex at customers. WEBX is cheap if the growth comes
thru...the model appears scalable so a larger share will hit the bottom line
ath higher revenue levels. SARS looks to be only a catalyst with legs for
companies trading with Asia where ~90% of the cases are...China especially. But
there's a LOT of trade there and company's that get the hang of it will likely
use it elsewhere to enhance productivity...which is really the main driver for
VC.

One I've put back on my radar screen (I received a small IPO allocation, since

Excellent business to be in IMHO, results have exceeded expectations for
several quarters now.
Potential negatives are insider selling (can't blame them, that's one means of
getting paid), and talk of a secondary (although some speculate this won't
happen until prices are higher).
Unfortunately, stock price has jumped considerably lately, because of an
excellent quarterly report, as well as a rejuvenated market.
