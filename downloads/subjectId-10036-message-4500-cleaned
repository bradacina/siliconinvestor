Not to nit-pick but in regards to NH. <If it doesnt go up 10% this week, I need
to find another career>

I have enjoyed your picks (and reasons for them) . Please keep up the good work
and analysis. I am truly amazed that NH is as low as it is and the internets
(read fluffs) are as high as they are.

Any additional thoughts on NH. I got in at 19, and am thinking about buying
more if it continues south. My next buy point will be around 15 which at the
rate it is going should be there in about 2-3 weeks.

thanks

Re: NH, value investing

I bought in a small position at 23 and change. There was relative and absolute
value there by every measure I could find, both within the industry and
compared to the whole stock market. It fell through 23 support on high volume,
and has kept falling, along with the rest of the industry. I committed to
double my position at 60% of my original position. So that's about 14. I have
no illusions it won't get there.
I believe that as bad as the relative disparity between value investors and
go-go investors has been the last three years, it has increased an order of
magnitude since late Spring. Certainly a gut check for value investors
everywhere.

Seems to me that a lot of the bad news was known when it fell to 23. The stock
got punished twice - once in anticipation, and then again after the decreased
estimates were announced. I posted on my web site "look for flat sales in 1998"
back in May. You'd think Wall Street could have figured this out if I could.
But then, this scenario is so common that one of my rules is "wait for the
downgrades," and I didn't do that here. I think another factor here is the
general dichotomy in the market getting worse. It's one thing to be a value
stock, which should be avoided at all costs. But the earnings announcement got
most of the holdouts (who must've been braindead not to know it was coming) to
abandon ship. I think that the 4 years of outperformance by go go stocks is
finally getting to the big value managers. They're dumping value left and
right. Sogen's head hints at this. Heaven forbid their clients see that they
didn't see the value in Amazon.

In any case, I've got a small position in NH and will add to it when it makes
sense to. I'm sure it will recover with the sector, no sooner and no later. And
I'll sell no sooner.

Flyt makes an acquisition:

Monday July 27, 8:00 am Eastern Time
Company Press Release

Interactive Flight Technologies Inc. Announces Acquisition and Growth Strategy
and Elects New Director

PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 27, 1998--Interactive Flight Technologies Inc.
(NASDAQ:FLYT - news; ''IFT'') Monday announced that it has acquired the assets
and business of Johnny Valet Inc., a retail dry cleaning plant in San Diego,
for $800,000.

Johnny Valet had revenues of approximately $1.1 million for calendar 1997.

The acquisition represents IFT's initial foray into the dry cleaning business.
As previously announced, IFT had concluded that its current opportunities are
limited in the in-flight entertainment business.

As a result, IFT has been exploring various alternative business ventures that
could make use of the company's two primary assets, approximately $40 million
in cash and significant operating tax loss carry forward credits. The company
has concluded that the dry cleaning business represents an opportunity for
utilization of those assets.

The company believes that the highly fragmented dry-cleaning industry presents
an opportunity for consolidation. The vast majority of the existing dry
cleaners in the United States are owned by individuals, many of whom are a part
of the aging population in the United States. The company believes that these
''mom and pop'' business owners will increasingly turn to public consolidators
as their preferred exit strategy.

In addition, although many dry cleaning businesses produce significant and
reliable net income and cash flows, the company believes that professional
management, standard operating procedures, effective cash control, uniform site
and location criteria, as well as customer service training programs and brand
name marketing, can increase profits and cash flows. Finally, the economies of
scale can make improvements in marketing and advertising possible.

As a result of these conclusions, IFT is planning to pursue a strategy to start
or acquire a significant number of dry cleaning businesses in large population
centers of the United States. The company wants to be a major operator in each
geographical area in which it acquires or starts dry cleaning businesses and to
build a brand identity in each market area.

IFT intends to implement standardized management and operational programs
designed to result in greater customer efficiency, appeal and improved customer
service.

Michail Itkis, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of IFT
commented, ''We have done extensive analysis to identify an industry that would
make the best use of our resources. We believe that the dry cleaning business
is ready for consolidation and can benefit greatly from improved standard
operating procedures and controls.

''We intend to be aggressive in acquiring or starting dry cleaning operations
in major population centers. Our management has significant experience in the
service industry with multiple locations. At the next annual meeting, which is
scheduled for September 30, 1998 we will ask our shareholders to approve a
change in the company's name to IFT Holdings Inc., which will more accurately
reflect the anticipated nature of our business going forward.

''We will also ask our shareholders to approve a 5 to 1 reverse stock split
which should eliminate any concerns about our Nasdaq National Market listing
based on the trading price of our Class A common stock.''

Itkis added, ''Concerning our in-flight entertainment business, we are
continuing to perform under our contract and letters of intent with Swissair.

''We have completed, and Swissair has accepted, the majority of the software
upgrades that we were obligated to deliver and we are in the process of
delivering additional hardware upgrades that Swissair has ordered. However, the
company has continued to experience a lack of prospects beyond Swissair for
additional orders of its in-flight entertainment systems.''

Separately, IFT also announced the election of Gary E. Hirth to the board of
directors, effective July 22, 1998. Hirth is a practicing Certified Public
Accountant with his own firm focused on auditing, business management and
consulting, tax preparation and planning. Prior to starting his own firm in
1986, Hirth was director of finance for American Color Corp., a national
graphic arts company.

From 1980 to 1982 Hirth was controller of Agri-business Research and
Development Corp. and for the seven years prior was employed as an accountant
by a CPA firm. Hirth received his Bachelor of Science degree in accounting from
Arizona State University.

This press release includes forward-looking statements about the company that
are based on management's current expectations. Actual results may differ
materially as a result of any one or more of the risks identified below or in
the company's filings under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, including
without limitation, the inability of the company to locate, evaluate, purchase,
start or operate dry cleaning businesses, the inability of the company to
manage the hazardous waste issues associated with the dry cleaning business,
the difficulties in achieving any additional profits or revenues from operating
efficiencies or marketing in the dry cleaning business, potential cost overruns
in connection with the company's current and future in-flight entertainment
(''IFE'') systems contracts, failure of installed IFE systems to perform in
accordance with system specifications, the failure to execute definitive
agreements relating to the letters of intent with Swissair, the inability of
the company to convince airlines to purchase its IFE systems, the failure of
the company to secure sufficient financing to perform under any new airline
contracts or to pursue and acquire dry cleaning businesses, the impact of
competition and downward pricing pressures in the in-flight and dry cleaning
businesses, the effect of changing economic conditions in the airline and dry
cleaning businesses including changes in clothing styles and materials, the
inability of the company to address labor, management and collective bargaining
issues in the dry cleaning business, the impact of changes in customer patterns
regarding the use of dry cleaning services, the impact of any changes in
domestic and foreign regulatory environments, the company's inability to obtain
requisite government approvals, technology changes, currency fluctuations, and
the other risks and uncertainties detailed in the company's annual report on
Form 10-KSB and amendment No. 1 to the annual report on Form 10-KSB/A for the
fiscal year ended Oct. 31, 1997.

Speaking of exceptional managers. Gabelli has continued to add to

I think this is a promising strategy. FLYT has good upside in my opinion. The
reverse split is obviously not good.
But lets look at what we have here....
A company with roughly $40 million in CASH. Net book value (net CASH) of about
$1.90 per share. A whole heckuva lot of tax loss carryforwards to shield future
income.
Dry cleaning is a highly fragmented industry. Similar high growth fragmented
situations in the past include the funeral home, pawn shop & video rental
industries. One that DIDNT work out well was the buy here/pay here used car
business. (Urcarco)
Anyway, Dry cleaners are typically available for LESS than 4 times EBITDA
meaning the potential for a good return is apparent especially when one
considers that income will accumulate tax-free for a long time.
The downside from a book value perspective is there will be a good bit on
goodwill on the balance sheet since Dry cleaners dont have much in the way of
tangible assets. Obviously their biggest asset is their EBITDA.
So....I think the strategy has good if not exceptional long-term growth
potential. Indeed, the concept would seem to have investment merit even if
there were NO tax assets and if it were trading at net cash. Our margin of
safety is the HUGE discount to cash that the stock trades at. (Currently 75
cents bid)
One could make a case for this stock increasing 5-10 times in value over the
next 3-5 years. At the current price the downside is minimal.
Comments from value investors please !
I'm interested in ALL comments on the potential of the strategy as well as the
margin of safety the current price offers.
Does anyone know anything about the dry cleanin business ?

Any companies trading at near cash levels? Especially ones that have good

value and cash levels will sustain their value. I also want companies that have
good prospects and preferably profitable. The only companies I follow that I
see that is close is ASYT and AULT. The specialty chip makers such as OAKT,
SIII and TRID are below book value and OAKT trades at cash levels but those

Globaltech (GAI) trading slightly over cash and only 2x EBITDA and good
prospects/growth.

12.83mm shares x $9 share = $115mm mkt. cap - $70mm cash = $45mm business
value. Trailing EBITDA is $23mm, versus $8mm EBITDA previous year.

Taken public recently at $19/share by Furman Selz. Missed first Q out of the
gate, Wall St. has been mercilous. Sunbeam was a 30% customer - therein lies
the problem. Good news is that business ex. Sunbeam apparently growing 30%/40%,
and company growing enough around sunbeam to hold earnings flat as Sunbeam
business drops off. Eventually this issue worked through, and normalized growth
returns.

Globaltech is an orignal design manufacturer of consumer applience's for OEM's
(i.e. they design and manufacture things like breadmakers and foodsteamer's for
companies like Sunbeam, Moulinex, etc.). Globaltech has been growing so quickly
because located in China, so cost structure is 50% of domestic OEMs, and time
to market also much quicker with original design capability.

Seems like a compelling value.

2nd largest movie theater chain in puerto rico, the angelika film center (NYC

for basically nothing.

Cheaper way to play RDGE (and currently getting RDGE AT cash/share) is Craig
Corp (N-CRG) and its common preference stock (N-CRG.pr); where you get about
$0.50/crg share of Citadel holdings (A-CDL) and between .9 to 1.0 shares of
RDGE per CRG chare.

you'll have to read 10-K's, etc as company is limited in discussion with

Very perceptive post on AGCO/NH, and I also applaud the poster who had the
confidence to post GAI - that looks absolutely ghastly, which often is the key
to a spectacular investment.

Agco vs. New Holland. I've owned both of them institutionally. Agco was my
biggest mistake. The story looked so good a year ago at 31. Now their balance
sheet is a mess. They release earnings on Friday I believe. Wall Street is
going to be looking at the earnings number and the forecast. Ignore them. Look
at the balance sheet. If free cash flow is negative, stay away. If free cash
flow is positive (i.e., inventories down, receivables down), then I think you
may have a winner here. New Holland is a much more conservative investment, in
my view.

The catalyst for the ag stocks is a hypothetical, because the corn is still in
the ground. An August drought in the midwest would blow out the bear case by
raising corn prices and controlling inventories. So if you own these stocks,
and this is ironic, what you want to see is brown corn in Iowa and Nebraska
(Texas is already in a drought but the state's production of crops is
irrelevant). I have no idea whether this will happen or not, but you are
playing a probability game with these stocks as long as the corn is in the
ground.

o well publicized concern on newly built boats entering the Gulf of Mexico and
depressing rates
o their fleet is old ... supposedly newer builds can be run more efficiently
o they don't have much depreciation so earnings is pretty much cash flow
o the majority of the fleet is dedicated to/designed for the Gulf ... it can't

For thousands of stocks, the bear market has already arrived.

As of Tuesday night, the average New York Stock Exchange stock was down 24.3%
from its 52-week high. That's the biggest such decline since 1990, the last
official bear market, according to equity strategists at Salomon Smith Barney.
(A bear market is typically defined as a 20% or greater decline in the Dow
Jones Industrials.) More stocks have been making new lows than new highs most
days since late May.

On the Nasdaq Stock Market, the average stock has declined an even more
dramatic 35%. Indeed, fully 30% of Big Board stocks and 51% of Nasdaq stocks
are down 30% or more from their 52-week highs.[snip]

I couldn't agree more. The largest of large cap stocks are near their highs,
while everything I look at is down 30-50% from 52 week highs. But this is what
separates the investors from the traders. If you have a Buffett approach to
investing (and aren't managing $80 billion), you look at each investment as a
business. Would you buy the whole business for the market price? Remember,
under this approach you couldn't care less about the size of the company,
within reason (below $100 million, you're arguably playing a different game).
But don't bother with this approach if you are worried about what drives the
stock up tomorrow. If you're thinking that way, don't waste your time doing
research. Buy GE.

Take USEC for example. I make no promises that the stock is going to do
anything for six months until the market gets comfortable with the story. But
it is still an outstanding investment IMHO. Why now? Because in this market a
lot of these things that show no near-term catalysts do end up moving tomorrow.
Just take a look at Betz Dearborn today. A dog yesterday, a double today.

We are in a mania right now. A value investor has to fight the urge for greed
and absolutely cannot join the party now by investing in the big overvalued
names (MANY institutions which call themselves value investors are doing
exactly that, because their clients are demanding it - but the moment these
stocks crash, I think these "investors" will forget what they told their
managers to do - I really believe that that "value" "investors" throwing in the
towel under extreme pressure are driving this extreme divergence). The
alternatives as I see them are to get out alltogether, or to completely ignore
the crowd and buy what's cheap - not relatively cheap, but CHEAP, because,
amazingly, there are a lot of cheap stocks out there. But don't kid yourself.
If the big names crash 40%, you will lose a lot of money in the New Hollands
and the like no matter how cheap they look now. In the early 70s, the smaller
cheaper stocks actually lost a lot more than the "Nifty Fifty" in the bear
market. Personally, I am about 40% in cash and another 20% in high dividend
stocks (7%+ yield vs. 1.7% market dividends) because I do believe dividends and
cash are the only thing that will protect me when this bubble bursts. Will
net-nets hold their own in a bear market? I suspect they will, but I have no
historical analysis to back any reasoning up. Why should I think they will
trade rationally in a deep downturn when they are not trading rationally now?
Don't mean to scare you, but I think we are in Dutch tulip mode right now. And
that's not a response to the last two weeks. I did all my selling near the peak
of the market (though well off the peak of my investments.) Be afraid...be very
afraid.

James,

Well stated post, but I disagree that it's a time hoard cash. There are some
very good companies out there selling at bargain prices - based on old
fashioned financial value analysis.

IMO - When one can find well managed companies that can be bought with a
reasonable expectation that their operational profits (cash and BV growth) will
exceed 20% on the price, money is put to better use invested. We might not buy
these companies at the lows, will likely see some volatility, may take some
paper losses, and we'll have to constantly review their situation, but they'll
provide a much better return than sitting on cash.

I also believe it's a mistake to ignore the under $100M stocks as they may be
the $B stocks of tomorrow. IMO value and potential are much more important than
market cap or sales revs.

JMHO,

Hello Mike,

I don't currently have any $ in NH, but I am looking to possibly
invest there. Been looking over the investor packet that they
sent me, looks impressive for the most part. The thing that is
difficult for me to figure on NH is fair value. With little growth,
PE/growth rate doesn't work very well. I suppose I could assume
no EPS growth for the next few years and maybe assume that the
book value will increase with earnings? Any thoughts?

If I could invest anew, one of the first places I'd put it is
NH. Unfortunately, I'm fully invested in a lot of other stocks
that are also down 25% or so, so I can't. I envy you that you're discovering it
now. I must admit I am considering liquidating Timet to buy more NH and JOE.

Focus on the cash flows, and figure what those are worth to you
even with no growth. Discount them back to the present and you'll
see why it is a value. Don't forget to add in debt when comparing
the discounted value to the present value. The way it is now,
growth is gravy. I like Agco too, but NH is better for value investors due to
its more conservative balance sheet. There is a margin of safety. Also note
that these are cyclicals. But only
a Chinese devaluation could make Asia worse, and if NH is turning
in its current numbers during such a downturn, you gotta imagine
that when times are booming, NH will rock. Sweet gravy.

Good investing,

<<and if NH is turning

Mike, I agree that New Holland is a great long term investment at this
price, but this is certainly not a business in a downturn. Times are
booming now, and have been for the last three or four years. Earnings
are closer to a peak than a trough, and the fear in the sector is that
the peak is right now. Agco fell to 5 times earnings today. FIVE times!
What you need to think about with New Holland is the level of free cash
flow and the balance sheet. You know this business will make it through
the trough, and is likely to stay profitable. Also, New Holland's next
peak of earnings (if this is indeed the peak) will be higher than this
one - this is a cyclical grower. As Mike said, any growth is just gravy. You're
not even paying full value for the company's mid-cycle earnings power at this
price. I figure it this way. They're earning $2.50 now, and this company will
earn money in a trough. Figure 50 cents to be
conservative. Average the two and you get a buck fifty of "mid cycle
earnings". If you can buy a cyclical at 12 times mid cycle earnings,
that's not investment. That's theft. But you may have to wait through a three
year cycle to cash in.

RE:NH

Times are
booming now, and have been for the last three or four years.

You know NH better than me. Heck, you've sat down with their executives, which
I can't do. And I admit I have been early and wrong on these cyclicals, and
maybe I just need to be around long enough to see them cycle. So forgive my
obstinance.

Looks like North America and Brazil are the only ones going really right for
them as of last quarter, accounting for a little less than half of revenues.
Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa all down. In fact, Asia down 40%. Maybe not
as low as they can go but still down. It's not as if they are hitting on all
cylinders now as far as I can tell. Seems if they were hitting on all
cylinders, earnings and earnings growth would be much higher than they are now,
so I don't see this as peak earnings. Then again, I'm not looking at next year
as much as I am over the next 3-5 years.

They are moving to diversify and take some of the cyclicality out, both
geographically and in product lines. Investments in Turkey, Pakistan, Asia
recently. Not bad value investing mentality by the managers. Agricultural
equipment is their heritage obviously, but now they are growing light
industrial equipment at 20+% clip and construction equipment at a 10% clip to
offset massive agriculture's negative growth. The industrial and construction
equipment would be growing much faster if the developing world would cooperate
and get out of their recessions. The growth of the financing arm will also help
smooth out the cycles. None of this will help the current downturn, but it will
help over the long run for stock valuation
purposes.

And then I see how it gets its tentacles in every market, with near
worldwide coverage, if token in some countries. With smart acquisitions and
good management, I don't see why NH couldn't smooth out some of the coming bad
troughs simply by expanding in virgin markets like Poland or Pakistan. Again,
long-term, and not necessarily for this cycle, but it raises that mid-cycle
number.

It has the cash flow and balance sheet to show that it will be around to see
its plans implemented. Moreover, I don't see the current/near term downturn as
typical of a cyclical in that it is simply following the tragic shock to the
long-term upward-trending business cycle of its targeted high-growth countries,
and is not the result of boom years flooding the market with nearly new
machines that need to get old before the next wave of new purchases occurs.
Seems that many developing countries including Asia have the need, but the
currency crisis has dampened their ability to satisfy that need with NH product
or any product for that matter. When many of these countries recover, NH should
be there, with an expanded presence thanks to its investments now.

I don't see the managers doing anything I don't like, and with some developing
market recovery I can see the stock doubling in 3 years,
and probably much more than that in 5 years. And if CAT or whoever sees their
cash flow, balance sheet, and growth prospects as attractive, and Fiat wants to
sell, then maybe there will be a lesser return but on a shorter time frame. So
I'm buying more.

Maybe this will be the one that teaches me what the word cyclical means and
I'll lose my shirt. Until I know bettter, I'll continue to find companies like
this at this price very attractive.

Jim:

Why do you say " If you can buy a cyclical at 12 times mid cycle earnings,
that's not investment. That's theft. "

If you are intending to convey that buying a cyclical at 12 times mid-cycle
earnings is a good investment, I would like to hear more about why you think
so.

Does it mean that you think that, say, a 14x multiple for a company,in normal
times, growing at say, 10% annually, is a good deal?

Basically, I look at it this way:

Assume a 14x multiple with a 7% growth rate in earnings and a long-term 4%
inflation rate. For a long-term investment (eliminating taxes), I'd say my
money is growing at 7% per year the first year, and with the increase in 'real'
earnings, this 8% increases over time. I'll do a spreadsheet to get a 50 or 100
year IRR.

Compare this to an apartment building, which you can buy at 10x pretax earnings
and expect to grow, more or less, at inflation plus population growth, maybe
5.5%.

The risk of the company is doubtless much higher than that of the apartment
what with competition and obsolescence.

When I was buying mid-size businesses in the 1980's I pretty much got turned
off when the multiple exceeded 6x operating profit (not cash flow).

What is the long-term average multiple of earnings on Wall St.

Any reaction?

Nice post on NH, Mike. The CAT angle is intriguing. CAT wants to get into the
agriculture equipment business in a big way. But even if they can develop
product, they do not have ag dealers to distribute it. Buying NH would solve

for this - its just an idea some analysts have floated around.

KNTK - has been dropping with the market, is almost at net present value now at

IMO, a multiple of 12x to 16x assumes a reasonably rosy projection for
inflation, GDP growth and company growth beyond your ten year holding period.

If there is no expected real growth, than getting a 6% to 8% (inverse 12x -
16x) real return is not adequate, to my way of thinking. Expected real growth
could be thought of as the projected growth after inflation, risk adjusted.

Long, long term expected real growth is negative. Most businesses succumb to
the ravages of technological change and fresh competition, shrinking to nothing
in the fullness of time.

Of course, you intentionally stated your answer in terms of an exit multiple,
not a sensible valuation. And I agree with that outlook - one can defer exit if
the multiples are not there until such time as they are - assuming earnings can
hold on until that time.

These thoughts probably seem overly pessimistic to most investors today. We
have all become accustomed to 'reasonable' multiple being 15x to 20x. But even
this, IMO, is inflated unless future economic conditions turn out to be
extraordinarily good. Give me back my 8x to 12x. That's something I can chew
on.

Much of this thinking leads one to the net/net way of thinking, which is often
what this thread is all about - and for very good reason.

Jim, I am amazed and impressed by your ability to remain sensible and deaf to

Beats me. Paul, I'm leaving this morning for vacation out of state, so I will
be out of touch for a week. I think it is the current issue of Florida Trend.
It is possible that it was 1 or 2 months ago... but I still think it is the
current issue.

I'll have to wait until 8-10-98 before I can look into this any further. The
author suggested that St. Joe will not see any big profits from its real estate
development efforts for a good 3-5 years. Too much permitting approval to go
through. Plus, they are trying to convince people (retirees?) to move to the
Florida Panhandle - a place where retirees do not traditionally retire to.

I personally can speak to the permitting issues and the long lead time it takes
to get permits. I am a city planner in Florida and am well famililar with the
long lead times for the state's permitting process, particularly for
large-scale developments which are referred to under Florida Statutes as
Developments of Regional Impact. I am one of the bureaucrats that adds to the
long delays in permitting. Yes, it does take a good 18-24 months to go through
the DRI approval process. And that is just the conceptual process. After the
DRI is approved, the applicant still has to get engineering and construction
permits, which can take another 6-12 months.

Surprisingly, in most DRI projects I have reviewed, the applicant himself adds
to the lead time by a good 6-months. typically, they want to fight about every
little thing and drag out the process. If I were a developer in Florida, my #1
goal would be to get through the permitting process as quickly as possible. I
would agree to just about any condition or information request made of me
(unless I thought it was a project killer) so I could get on with construction.

Hopefully, the new CEO at St. Joe realizes this. However, there is an excellent
chance that he does not since he comes from Disney. When Florida allowed (?)
Disney into the state, they gave Uncle Walt a blank check and made his property
virtually immune from state laws. I'm not certain if Disney's Celebration even
went through the DRI process. Also, I'm not particularly impressed with what
(little) I've seen/heard of Celebration from a design standpoint. It
could/should have been better.

Paul,

I have been getting 'messages' and posts from others about recent losses in
this market - a market that the media hypes as 'booming' when in truth the only
ones booming are the Index stocks.

I am down 30% from my high and also questioning my ability. So I ask: Do I
trust my own judgement? I'm confident that my current holdings are priced under
value (I'm sure you are too). When they return to the levels I bought at, I'll
be back where I was and still be holding undervalued stocks (so will you). I
guess getting older has given me more patience and tolerance for situations
like this.

I'm a novice compared to you and many others on this thread, but I think all
will agree that we have a market based on speculation, not fundamentals. (Buy
because it's going up, sell because it's going down) The Index stocks are at
artificial highs, many small/mini caps selling well undervalue.

You're sitting at a BJ table and the guy next to you is hitting 16s, splitting
10s, doubling into Aces, and he's winning. At the same time you are playing
your conservative game and losing. Should you adopt his style of play? The

baffled, choose your word, that these are down 20-40% while "the market" is
still within 10% of its high. Perfectly good companies are being thrown away by
portfolio managers who think they have to get into the "perfomers" (GE, MSFT,
KO...the list is getting very narrow) A week ago it would have included PG. A
quarter ago it would have included MRK and G. Six months ago it would have
included K. Look at some charts on those. When a market gets narrower and
narrower, eventually everybody is investing in the same stocks, and then the
whole game goes poof.

My value investing firm has stayed the course religiously, and we were rewarded
for it by losing our three biggest clients in the last six months. And its not
just us. If you are an institutional value investor, your clients are demanding
that you make this stop - but going into cash or utilities is forbidden. So if
you are a profit maximizing human being, but are also scared to death, you sell
New Holland and buy GE, even though you know there is every possibility the
same client is going to be hammering you for that decision three months from

Pocket change into AEHCF - could return 5x in next few months
JWG (JWC) getting into buy range again - I like below 9.00
SWS a good buy near 21 - I look for return to highs soon
I've been buying HIHOF below 2.56, HIHWF @ .25

On market breadth or lack thereof: Was looking at a table of Sector and

500. (Relative Strength being the 12 mo price performance at June 30 relative
to the S & P).

Of 12 sectors, only 1 (Financial) exceeded the performance of the S & P. This
was by 2%. Several sectors underperformed by more than 20%. Health Care Rel
Strength of -28%, Technology -27%, Basic Materials -27%, and Energy -25%.

Of 102 industry groups, only 18 had a positive relative strength versus the
S&P, with most of these in the Services and Financial.

Agree about some of the information but since the stocks are in a downtrend -
presumably predicting a southern turn for the business, I would (and am)
waiting to add any.

My target is to triple my position when NH is in the 10-12 range. At the rate
it is going, it should be their pretty soon. At that range, the dividend will
start to kick in as a sort of security net.

Since this company doesnt (cant) buy back shares, the only choice it has to
increase stockholder value is to raise the dividend, short of that, wait for
the stock price drop to yield an attractive dividend

Hi James,

Just another note of encouragement. I too have been increasing my cash so I
feel pretty insulated from the "stealth bear" of the last few months. I
rationalize my envy of the high fliers by telling myself that those stocks are
not right for my temperament. But I think now is a good time to exercise those
value investing skills because IMHO the coming weeks will provide some very
nice bargains.

I am particularly watching for stocks paying relatively high dividends in case
the next upswing is slow to include value stocks. It is likely that the indices
will continue to enjoy the favor of the market considering the type of money
invested. Until we see retirement en masse or a spike in college admissions
then I think the current conditions may prevail.

Otherwise I am concentrating my overseas investments in Europe; waiting for
positive fundamental changes in Asia. (This could be my chance to get into
DSWLF though!) I sold off my TBR last week so I have no exposure to Lat. Am.
right now.

Here's the round-up:
TCOMA/TCIVA: trading stably in anticipation of the T merger.
TYC: my one growth stock; bear friendly businesses; accretive acquisitions;
excellent management.
CRUS: bought @ $9 :( was hoping it was a bargain way to play semiconductors and
set-top boxes. Nice product releases, new management, recent addition of
private investor with good reputation for increasing shareholder value.
However, no increase so far and recovery looks pretty far off.

These are just three and I will likely sell TCOMA/TCIVA soon. With a couple
others that leaves me roughly 75% cash right now (!). I have no regrets but,
unlike you, I don't have to answer to people who do not understand the danger
they are in.

Appreciate any comments, your opinion is always respected.

Ron, well, if we're in a bear market regarding value stocks--now might be the
time to buy. That's often (not always) been a good move. That's how I think the
world works (my weltanshauung= world view). I think it's time to do some
buying, and this is what I've done:

Adding to my position: LTV. Selling at year low, but imports are coming 'they'
say. Earnings are down. $5/sh in cash, selling for 7. 5/8. Good price to cash
flow. Entering new business (perhaps a catalyst eventually to move the stock)
Mentioned here before by somebody as an Al Frank favorite.

Adding to my position: Toys-R-Us (TOY). Stock hitting new lows. A Bill Miller
(Legg Mason) recommendation. Etoys is getting the internet media attention, but
TOY will be (is) there too. Earnings growth down from prior years, lots of
competition (Kmart/Wal-Mart). I've owned and followed TOY since '95. Sold most
earlier this year. Also still own CNS (Kaybee). Nice words by TOY
customers-stockholders on SI - TOY thread. New management could be catalyst to
propel stock (propel up I hope -g-).

Adding to my position: PFG @ 10+. I don't know what I am missing here, but
possibly something-- I can't see it or figure it. Stock at 10+, insider buys at
30, Swiss and investment mgmt firm taking a position at bv (which I figure is
maybe 18-20, somebody on Yahoo says 16), managers have committed to purchasing
shares for themselves in open market. (Maybe the agreement -Swiss/managers/etc.
is non binding. Investment is going to be 'up to' 75M. Maybe it will be
actually only .75M.) Stock offers a market equivalent yield. Profitable co.
Don't know what I don't know, so I keep buying: 13.3/4, 12+, 11+, and today
10+. It's going to be an outsize position in my portfolios-- I hate that -g-.

Adding to my position: WES. Bank specializing in mortgage servicing and
sub-prime auto loans (ugh!) But selling under bv. Largest and controlling
shareholder is CEO. Has cut faltering operations to improve profitablilty. At
11.1/2, I'm buying more. (Even though, as I've often stated, I've been mighty
wrong before on these co's which deal in sub-prime auto loans.)

Adding to my position: HOT. Humongous hotel operator. Great record past four
years. Looks like it's hit the wall now. 5% div. Bill Miller (Legg Mason)
recommendation. Also recommended (strongly, IMO) by hotel/gaming analyst on
Wall Street Week past Fri. (Oops sorry- that's useless info-- but just need to
pump my confidence up a little -g-)

Starting new position: Cooper Tire and Rubber (CTB). A me-too player in some
markets maybe, and the Asians will perhaps flood the tire market soon. Still, I
like my relative dividend model-- it puts me in these large cap ($1b+) stocks
when they are down, and gets me out too (well, sometimes...still holding JC
Penney at a diminishing profit. (Idea is to sell when div. is low -relative to
itself and market). CTB is a perfect model fit (Uh-oh. That could be a danger
with such a mechanical way of investing). 2.5% yield for CTB has in past 15
years signaled a VERY good buy point. I'll bet history repeats. So starting a
very small position.

Adding to new position: MMI as in June 29,1998 "MMI is One Cheap Stock" in
SmartMoney. Article says Tweedy Browne is buying. Insider buying too. Good rev
growth '93-'98, increasing divs., now selling slightly below bv. Medical
Malpractice Insurance ---- competitive biz. But.. Crimini... is there a dinky
insurance company below bv that I won't buy?

Adding to my position: Bristol-Myers Squibb(BMY). What can I say? The stock
market is the only place I know where, when the price of something doubles,
people think it's become a bargain. Sold some BMY at 44 (I thought it was fair
valued there---oops,ouch -g-),some at 88, and some at 98. Now buying back some
at 112. Yikes.

Adding to my 'ah screw it' stock. I like and use Earthlink. I like and use
Yahoo. My friends like and use AOL. Too bad I didn't take a flyer on these
stocks. Well, I like and use Silicon Investor. So 'ah screw it' -- I'm gonna
take a small taste of GNET (Go2Net).

That's about it for today. I'll probably have a bunch of buy orders tomorrow
for some other new positions (for example, maybe AMP??)as well as adds to
current.

Good investing! Paul.

Allen,

No where near Deswell's factory, not related to or similar to Deswell in any
way except that the Barrington handled both IPOs. The man was the CEO of a
Chinese company (AEHCF) and a high ranking member of the Communist Party. The
situation was due to mishandling by local authorities and has the attention of
Beijing - and Washington.

Deswell is a NASDAQ Holding Company operating out of HK with facilities in
China. Others with facilities in China include IBM, Motorola, Compaq, Chrysler,
McDonalds, etc.

To those considering Deswell - they are having their problems due the Asia
situation. I feel it to be an excellent company for long term, but there is
risk short term. The earnings report will be out in a few days and will be an
indicator of how well they are performing.

Jeffrey Bash: not sure if your comments about logic now of value investing
refers to my post or just that I am one above you on the thread. And certainly
some of my picks are not value stocks... heck, some of them aren't even logical
--g--.

I think I understand what you are saying, but it just doesn't work for me. If
we are in a bear market for small-cap or value stocks, then anyone who tries to
buy these at current prices is essentially trying to catch the falling knife.
Pretty straightforward to say... whoa.. let's see what tomorrow brings... these
stocks will continue to drop-- they've been dropping and they will continue to
drop.

My point is that with value stocks, I want to do what works. What is proven
academically and empirically. I summarize this -- rightly or wrongly -- as buy
value when you see value and you have a margin of safety. Not wait until I
"feel" like it can't get any worse, or there's a 10% retrenchment in the DOW,
or the internet stocks collapse, or interest rates drop/rise, or Elaine G. says
to buy, or Buffett says now, or the stock is at the lowest level it's been in
20 years. I recall no -- zero --mention of any type of timing mechanism -
associated with Buffett or Graham or some of the others.

I will try to buy value when I see it. In the short run stocks fluctuate. If
your name is SENIOR, or the name of some of the other guys on the thread, it
SURELY SEEMS LIKE and MAYBE IS TRUE, that stocks will go down after you buy
them. So prepare for it. Either set a mental sell stop, plan on buying more on
the way down (isn't that the Buffett way?), or just steel yourself. If one is
not going to buy in a bull market, and one also won't commit in a bear
market...man, that really limits opportunities IMO.

I have been in the position of watching many stocks wherein the odds favor
continuing decline. Like tomorrow... the stocks I am buying I expect to go
lower. (Why wouldn't they?--they've been steadily dropping.) Seemingly at the
bottom point in their fall, they seem to have the most likelihood of further
collapse (since all news is negative, none positive, can't see any progress).
Therefore the tendency is to refrain from buying and to miss the turn. I say,
it's much more profitable --maybe not so logical or so easy-- to BUY WHEN YOU
SEE VALUE and hold, through the (inevitable) continuing drop, then sell at the
fair value point. People who say, well, I'll just wait until it passes the low
point and it begins its rise... I find that these people either miss the rise
(it occurs too fast) or convince themselves that if they hold back, the stock
will drop back to its lows, or they just lose interest in the stock. Somehow or
another, IMO, they miss getting in and/or miss getting a gain.

Of course we're all different and have different ideas and outlooks and goals.
Someone posted here that some of these small/mid cap stocks are in the worst
bear market since 1990. So, for me I say ---no, now is not the time to go on
vacation... now is the time when the odds favor looking for, finding, and
buying these stocks. JMO. Paul Senior

Your approach is fine if you have unlimited capital. I think the odds favor a
big cap correction over a small cap advance. That will drag the value stocks
down more. Therefore, unless you are underinvested now, which I am not, the
odds favor being patient and doing nothing. I was an investor in 1973-74 and
what first appeared to be a value price often got cut by more than half before
it stopped going down.

Well of course no one has unlimited capital to invest. But, per T Rowe Price,
on his deathbed, per Forbes, and paraphrased by me: "Always keep some powder
dry". One plans to have capital always available. One trims outsize positions,
one takes gains in formerly undervalued stocks that have achieved fair value,
one prunes stocks that aren't working as envisioned. One funds IRAs, 401s.

I don't see the future as you envision it. So I don't see the odds as you do. I
try to pick these value stocks bottom up only without incorporating a macro
view. This is ala Graham I hope. Just trying to follow what's worked in the
past.

Saying that value stocks - already in a bear market-- will be dragged down even
further because big caps will decline-- yeah sure, I could see it. But where's
any evidence that it has happened before this way and/or that patience/doing
nothing is the optimum strategy therewith?

On Buffett and timing
I think timing is a big part of his method. I only skimmed a copy of
"Buffettology" in a book store, but I remember the analogy to shopping in a
hardware store. Many people can't resist buying something they see on sale,
even though they didn't know they needed it when they walked in. Buffett knows
what he wants when he goes in (companies worth owning for long periods), and
only buys if it is on sale.

Back on Buffett and timing: Maybe I/we need to clarify 'timing' more clearly.
Certainly to find and purchase bargains, timing is important. After all, you've
got to be in that hardware store at the right time to catch any bargains. Life
is about timing -- lots of us would agree to that. I'm saying I don't believe
these gurus' purchase points are timed based on the occurrence of exogenous
events. Which I analogize as: Maybe we go bargain hunting on blizzard days
because we know not many others are out there and that's when the best bargains
are found. But my opinion is that once a bargain is found... it should be
bought. Not waffled away by thinking 'oh well, the weather people say tomorrow
is going to be an even worse day, so don't buy until we go shopping tomorrow
for maybe even better bargains.'
Jeffrey Bash may be perfectly correct in that large caps will fall and bring
already-low small/mid caps down even further. And betting that way might work
out great. For me though, I just do not see any evidence that this logic is a
desirable way upon which to base investment decisions, or that is a way that
acknowledged professional value investors invest. JMO. Paul Senior

Wallace, my take on Ledsinger leaving The St. Joe Company (JOE) is that this is
good news and not bad news.

I think Rummell hired Ledsinger as a counterweight to Rummell's dynamic
personality, but I don't think he was all that great for the company. I do not
see any other evidence of turmoil at JOE, or any indication that their
direction has shifted.

I plan to purchase additional JOE. If shares actually crack 20, it would be an
opportunity to purchase JOE for about the same price as when Rummell first came
aboard. JOE is clearly a far stronger company today than it was before Rummell,
in my opinion.

It would be interesting to hear James' and Mike's view on JOE's current
valuation. They each posted very thorough analyses back when it was a clear
value stock. Later, as it rose to the mid-30's, James' wise counsel was that
JOE's price had risen rapidly, and the case for it as a value play was becoming
questionable. (I hope I am recalling this correctly).

It is also interesting to note that Florida East Coast Industries (FLA), the
railway 54% owned by JOE, has held it's own over recent months, while JOE's
share price has dropped sharply. Some of this may be because FLA is a more
straightforward business, whereas with JOE, much of the gains are well out in
the future.

FLA also happens to be installing fiber-optic cable/conduit along their
railroad right-of-way from Jacksonville to Miami, and has retained some rights
to the customer connections at the end of these cables, as I understand it.
While this begs the obvious joke about FLA being an internet stock, it may have
a significant impact in their future earnings. And what is good for FLA is good
for JOE.

Much of the buzz generated by JOE's pricey secondary offering a few months ago
has worn off, and people of may be dumping it in favor of shorter term
investments.

The big payoff from JOE will likely be several years in the future, as their
huge coastal Florida land holdings are developed. But it's hard to know how
fast they will develop momentum. Many of their current ventures offer quicker
payoff and appear to move that time frame forward. And they are sitting on
quite a pile of cash, recently made larger by the government purchases of their
sugar lands.

In summary, JOE remains a very long-term investment, and the price is dropping
back to value levels.

Re: JOE

I couldn't have been more wrong on this stock, or many of my others
for that matter. I thought that at $31 the market had recognized the management
changes and potential in St. Joe's land. I figured that with the land widely
recognized as worth at least $30/share, that Wall Street would not let St. Joe
get too much cheaper than that. I called it a margin of safety.

I did some pretty thorough valuation of its assets with conservative
numbers, and still came to at least $3B in assets. Yet here we are approaching
2/3 that. As a strict value player I should have waited for that 2/3 number.
James bought at 2/3 and sold at 4/3. He called
it right and made a lot of money. I called it wrong and have lost quite a lot
of money.

Today has been the worst day for my portfolio since at least 92. I'm down
nearly 4%, and this comes after a string of 1.x% daily losses.
In case anyone is noticing, USEC is down a point. Deswell is down to bid 12 7/8
- I'm rapidly approaching a 50% loss on a stock that was debt-free with a PE of
8.5 and a 4% dividend when I bought it. YPF, General Cigar, if I own it, it's
down.

Hard to figure, and hard to take. In fact, I feel not a little nausea
when I look at the dollar amount of my losses. Kudos to James and

Take a deep breath, Mike. This is a gut check for everybody. Our institutional

already lost our poor clients about $5 million. Does that make you feel better?
It really did seem like a good idea at the time...

I'm sure there are plenty of buy ideas out there, but one I actually bought
today is LaSalle Hotels (LHO). Busted REIT IPO taken public about three months
ago at 18. Its about $14 a share now. Pays a dividend of $1.50, for a 10.7%
yield. And there is really nothing wrong with it. Just a very unpopular sector
these days, and a small unknown name in that sector. But its properties are
decent quality and management is honest and has bought shares since the IPO. I
also believe that at some point in this decline people are going to start
thinking about dividends agin, then you'll see a REIT bounce. Otherwise, I just
bought 18 or 19 dollars worth of property at a 25% discount, and I get paid
10.7% to wait a while.

Well, its better thn yesterday. There are only 8700 points of downside left in

expensive market over the last year, buying value stocks close to intrinsic
value may have been my biggest mistake.

But no way can I sell now. Since I've got about 50% of the amount of my stock
portfolio in cash in my bank account, I'll probably start moving some of that
over into stocks to buy USU and TDW (and more
JOE <g>).

Good investing all,
Mike
